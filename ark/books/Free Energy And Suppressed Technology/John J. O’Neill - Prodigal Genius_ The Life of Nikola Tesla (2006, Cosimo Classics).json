The author was a Pulitzer Prize-winner and personal friend of Tesla, whoonce said the author understood him better than any man alive. It is reflectedwell in this highly detailed work. Much of the information in this book waspersonal and important, but might otherwise not have been known had O’Neill notdocumented it. The immense genius of Tesla resulted from a mind that could seean invention in 3-D, from every angle, within his mind before it was easilybuilt. His dimensions and part sizes were always perfect. He never tested parts;they always worked. Most of his inventions were electrical in nature, withdozens of his patents now being used around the world. Much is revealed onTesla’s eccentric personality, his competition with Thomas Edison, and how hemade his first million before the age of forty. Money was not important to him,however, nor was The Nobel Prize, which he refused to accept. It was always thescience that came first. Due to the author’s friendship with him, we are allowedan up close and intimate view into the mind of this genius inventor.Paul Tice"},{"pageContent":"CONTENTS image [images/00003.jpg]Title Page [index_split_000.html#filepos283]Copyright Page [index_split_001.html#filepos403]FIRST PARTLIGHT AND POWER [index_split_005.html#filepos5450]SECOND PARTFORTUNE AND FAME [index_split_008.html#filepos278063]THIRD PARTINTERNAL VIBRATION [index_split_011.html#filepos472263]FOURTH PARTSELF-MADE SUPERMAN [index_split_014.html#filepos573882]FIFTH PARTAFTERGLOW [index_split_017.html#filepos652985]ACKNOWLEDGMENTS [index_split_020.html#filepos745398]PARTIAL LIST OF TESLA PATENTS [index_split_021.html#filepos749667]"},{"pageContent":"FIRST PART [index_split_004.html#filepos4348] LIGHT AND POWER [index_split_004.html#filepos4348]"},{"pageContent":"ONEimage [images/00003.jpg] “SPECTACULAR” IS a mild word for describing the strange experiment with lifethat comprises the story of Nikola Tesla, and “amazing” fails to do adequatejustice to the results that burst from his experiences like an exploding rocket.It is the story of the dazzling scintillations of a superman who created a newworld; it is a story that condemns woman as an anchor of the flesh which retardsthe development of man and limits his accomplishment—and, paradoxically, provesthat even the most successful life, if it does not include a woman, is a dismalfailure.Even the gods of old, in the wildest imaginings of their worshipers, neverundertook such gigantic tasks of world-wide dimension as those which Teslaattempted and accomplished. On the basis of his hopes, his dreams, and hisachievements he rated the status of the Olympian gods, and the Greeks would haveso enshrined him. Little is the wonder that so-called practical men, with theirnoses stuck in profit-and-loss statements, did not understand him and thoughthim strange.The light of human progress is not a dim glow that gradually becomes moreluminous with time. The panorama of human evolution is illumined by suddenbursts of dazzling brilliance in intellectual accomplishments that throw theirbeams far ahead to give us a glimpse of the distant future, that we may morecorrectly guide our wavering steps today. Tesla, by virtue of the amazingdiscoveries and inventions which he showered on the world, becomes one of themost resplendent flashes that has ever brightened the scroll of humanadvancement.Tesla created the modern era; he was unquestionably one of the world’s greatestgeniuses, but he leaves no offspring, no legatees of his brilliant mind, whomight aid in administering that world; he created fortunes for multitudes ofothers but himself died penniless, spurning wealth that might be gained from hisdiscoveries. Even as he walked among the teeming millions of New York he becamea fabled individual who seemed to belong to the far-distant future or to havecome to us from the mystical realm of the gods, for he seemed to be an admixtureof a Jupiter or a Thor who hurled the shafts of lightning; an Ajax who defiedthe Jovian bolts; a Prometheus who transmuted energy into electricity to spreadover the earth; an Aurora who would light the skies as a terrestrial electriclamp; a Mazda who created a sun in a tube; a Hercules who shook the earth withhis mechanical vibrators; a Mercury who bridged the ambient realms of space withhis wireless waves—and a Hermes who gave birth to an electrical soul in theearth that set it pulsating from pole to pole.This spark of intellectual incandescence, in the form of a rare creative genius,shot like a meteor into the midst of human society in the latter decades of thepast century; and he lived almost until today. His name became synonymous withmagic in the intellectual, scientific, engineering and social worlds, and he wasrecognized as an inventor and discoverer of unrivaled greatness. He made theelectric current his slave. At a time when electricity was considered almost anoccult force, and was looked upon with terror-stricken awe and respect, Teslapenetrated deeply into its mysteries and performed so many marvelous feats withit that, to the world, he became a master magician with an unlimited repertoireof scientific legerdemain so spectactular that it made the accomplishments ofmost of the inventors of his day seem like the work of toy-tinkers.Tesla was an inventor, but he was much more than a producer of new devices: hewas a discoverer of new principles, opening many new empires of knowledge Whicheven today have been only partly explored. In a single mighty burst of inventionhe created the world of power of today; he brought into being our electricalpower era, the rock-bottom foundation on which the industrial system of theentire world is builded; he gave us our mass-production system, for without hismotors and currents it could not exist; he created the race of robots, theelectrical mechanical men that are replacing human labor; he gave us everyessential of modern radio; he invented the radar forty years before its use inWorld War II; he gave us our modern neon and other forms of gaseous-tubelighting; he gave us our fluorescent lighting; he gave us the high-frequencycurrents which are performing their electronic wonders throughout the industrialand medical worlds; he gave us remote control by wireless; he helped give usWorld War II, much against his will—for the misuse of his superpower system andhis robot controls in industry made it possible for politicians to haveavailable a tremendous surplus of power, production facilities, labor andmaterials, with which to indulge in the most frightful devastating war that themaniacal mind could conceive. And these discoveries are merely the inventionsmade by the master mind of Tesla which have thus far been utilized—scores ofothers remain still unused.Yet Tesla lived and labored to bring peace to the world. He dedicated his lifeto lifting the burdens from the shoulders of mankind; to bringing a new era ofpeace, plenty and happiness to the human race. Seeing the coming of World WarII, implemented and powered by his discoveries, he sought to prevent it; offeredthe world a device which he maintained would make any country, no matter howsmall, safe within its borders—and his offer was rejected.More important by far, however, than all his stupendously significant electricaldiscoveries is that supreme invention—Nikola Tesla the Superman—the humaninstrument which shoved the world forward with an accelerating lunge like anairplane cast into the sky from a catapult. Tesla, the scientist and inventor,was himself an invention, just as much as was his alternating-current systemthat put the world on a superpower basis.Tesla was a superman, a self-made superman, invented and designed specificallyto perform wonders; and he achieved them in a volume far beyond the capacity ofthe world to absorb. His life he designed on engineering principles to enablehim to serve as an automaton, with utmost efficiency, for the discovery andapplication of the forces of Nature to human welfare. To this end he sacrificedlove and pleasure, seeking satisfaction only in his accomplishments, andlimiting his body solely to serving as a tool of his technically creative mind.With our modern craze for division of labor and specialization of effort to gainefficiency of production in our industrial machine, one hesitates to think of afuture in which Tesla’s invention of the superman might be applied to the entirehuman race, with specialization designed for every individual from birth.The superman that Tesla designed was a scientific saint. The inventions thatthis scientific martyr produced were designed for the peace, happiness andsecurity of the human race, but they have been applied to create scarcity,depressions and devastating war. Suppose the superman invention were alsodeveloped and prostituted to the purposes of war-mongering politicians? Teslaglimpsed the possibilities and suggested the community life of the bee as athreat to our social structure unless the elements of individual and communitylives are properly directed and personal freedom protected.Tesla’s superman was a marvelously successful invention—for Tesla—which seemed,as far as the world could observe, to function satisfactorily. He eliminatedlove from his life; eliminated women even from his thoughts. He went beyondPlato, who conceived of a spiritual companionship between man and woman freefrom sexual desires; he eliminated even the spiritual companionship. He designedthe isolated life into which no woman and no man could enter; theself-sufficient individuality from which all sex considerations were completelyeliminated; the genius who would live entirely as a thinking and a workingmachine.Tesla’s superman invention was a producer of marvels, and be thought that hehad, by scientific methods, succeeded in eliminating love from his life. Thatabnormal life makes a fascinating experiment for the consideration of thephilosopher and psychologist, for he did not succeed in eliminating love. Itmanifested itself despite his conscientious efforts at suppression; and when itdid so it came in the, most fantastic form, providing a romance the like ofwhich is not recorded in the annals of human history.Tesla’s whole life seems unreal, as if he were a fabled creature of someOlympian world. A reporter, after writing a story of his discoveries andinventions, concluded, “His accomplishments seem like the dream of anintoxicated god.” It was Tesla’s invention of the polyphase alternating-currentsystem that was directly responsible for harnessing Niagara Falls and opened themodern electrical superpower era in which electricity is transported for hundredof miles, to operate the tens of thousands of mass-production factories ofindustrial systems. Every one of the tall Martian-like towers of the electricaltransmission lines that stalk across the earth, and whose wires carryelectricity to distant cities, is a monument to Tesla; every powerhouse, everydynamo and every motor that drives every machine in the country is a monument tohim.Superseding himself, he discovered the secret of transmitting electrical powerto the utmost ends of the earth without wires, and demonstrated his system bywhich useful amounts of power could be drawn from the earth anywhere merely bymaking a connection to the ground; he set the entire earth in electricalvibration with a generator which spouted lightning that rivaled the fieryartillery of the heavens. It was as a minor portion of this discovery that hecreated the modern radio system; he planned our broadcasting methods of today,forty years ago when others saw in wireless only the dot-dash messages thatmight save ships in distress.He produced lamps of greater brilliance and economy than those in common, usetoday; he invented the tube, fluorescent and wireless lamps which we nowconsider such up-to-the-minute developments; and he essayed to set the entireatmosphere of the earth aglow with his electric currents, to change our worldinto a single terrestrial lamp and to make the skies at night shine as does thesun by day.If other first-magnitude inventors and discoverers may be considered torches ofprogress, Tesla was a conflagration. He was the vehicle through which theblazing suns of a brighter tomorrow focused their incandescent beams on a worldthat was not prepared to receive their light. Nor is it remarkable that thisradiant personality should have led a strange and isolated life. The value ofhis contributions to society cannot be overrated. We can now analyze, to someextent, the personality that produced them. He stands as a synthetic genius, aself-made superman, the greatest invention of the greatest inventor of alltimes. But when we consider Tesla as a human being, apart from his charming andcaptivating social manners, it is hard to imagine a worse nightmare than a Worldinhabited entirely by geniuses.When Nature makes an experiment and achieves an improvement it is necessary thatit be accomplished in such a way that the progress will not be lost with theindividual but will be passed on to future generations. In man, this requires autilization of the social values of the race, co-operation of the individualwith his kind, that the improved status may be propagated and become a legacy ofall. Tesla intentionally engineered love and women out of his life, and while heachieved gigantic intellectual stature, he failed to achieve its perpetuationeither through his own progeny or through disciples. The superman he constructedwas not great enough to embrace a wife and continue to exist as such. The lovehe sought to suppress in his life, and which he thought was associated only withwomen, is a force which, in its various aspects, links together all members ofthe human race. In seeking to suppress this force entirely Tesla severed thebonds which might have brought to him the disciples who would, through otherchannels, have perpetuated the force of his prodigal genius. As a result, hesucceeded in imparting to the world only the smallest fraction of the creativeproducts of his synthetic superman.The creation of a superman as demonstrated by Tesla was a grand experiment inhuman evolution, well worthy of the giant intellect that grew out of it, but itdid not come up to Nature’s standards; and the experiment will have to be mademany times more before we learn how to create a super race with the minds ofTeslas that can tap the hidden treasury of Nature’s store of knowledge, yetendowed too with the vital power of love that will unlock forces, more powerfulthan any which we now glimpse, for advancing the status of the human race.THERE was no evidence whatever that a superman was being born when the stroke ofmidnight between July 9 and 10, in the year 1856, brought a son, Nikola, to thehome of the Rev. Milutin Tesla and Djouka, his wife, in the hamlet of Smiljan,in the Austro-Hungarian border province of Lika, now a part of Yugoslavia. Thefather of the new arrival, pastor of the village church, was a former student inan officers’training school who had rebelled against the restrictions of Armylife and turned to the ministry as the field in which he could moresatisfactorily express himself. The mother, although totally unable to read orwrite, was nevertheless an intellectually brilliant woman, who without the helpof literal aids became really well educated.Both father and mother contributed to the child a valuable heritage of culturedeveloped and passed on by ancestral families that had been community leadersfor many generations. The father came from a family that contributed sons inequal numbers to the Church and to the Army. The mother was a member of theMandich family whose sons, for generations without number, had, with very fewexceptions, become ministers of the Serbian Orthodox Church, and whose daughterswere chosen as wives by ministers.Djouka, the mother of Nikola Tesla (her given name in English translation wouldbe Georgina), was the eldest daughter in a family of seven children. Her father,like her husband, was a minister of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Her mother,after a period of failing eyesight, had become blind shortly after the seventhchild was born; so Djouka, the eldest daughter, at a tender age was compelled totake over the major share of her mother’s duties. This not alone prevented herfrom attending school: her work at home so completely consumed her time that shewas unable to acquire even the rudiments of reading and writing through homestudy. This was a strange situation in the cultured family of which she was amember. Tesla, however, always credited his unlettered mother rather than hiserudite father with being the source from which he inherited his inventiveability. She devised many household labor-saving instruments. She was, inaddition, a very practical individual, and her well-educated husband wisely leftin her hands all business matters involving both the church and his household.An unusually retentive memory served this remarkable woman as a good substitutefor literacy. As the family moved in cultured circles she absorbed by ear muchof the cultural riches of the community. She could repeat, without error oromission, thousands of verses of the national poetry of her country—the sagas ofthe Serbs—and could recite long passages from the Bible. She could narrate frommemory the entire poetical-philosophical work Gorski Venae (Mountain Wreath),written by Bishop Petrovich Njegosh. She also possessed artistic talent and aversatile dexterity in her fingers for expressing it. She earned wide famethroughout the countryside for her beautiful needlework. According to Tesla, sogreat were her dexterity and her patience that she could, when over sixty, usingonly her fingers, tie three knots in an eyelash.The remarkable abilities of this clever woman who had no formal education weretransmitted to her five children. The elder son, Dane Tesla, born seven yearsbefore Nikola, was the family favorite because of the promise of an outstandingcareer which his youthful cleverness indicated was in store for him. Heforeshadowed in his early years the strange manifestations which in hissurviving brother were a prelude to greatness.Tesla’s father started his career in the military service, a likely choice forthe son of an officer; but he apparently did not inherit his father’s liking forArmy life. So slight an incident as criticism for failure to keep his brassbuttons brightly polished caused him to leave military school. He was probablymore of a poet and philosopher than a soldier. He wrote poetry which waspublished in contemporary papers. He also wrote articles on current problemswhich he signed with a pseudonym, “Srbin Pravicich.” This, in Serb, means “Manof Justice.” He spoke, read and wrote Serbo-Croat, German and Italian. It wasprobably his interest in poetry and philosophy that caused him to be attractedto Djouka Mandich. She was twenty-five and Milutin was two years older. Hemarried her in 1847. His attraction to the daughter of a pastor probablyinfluenced his next choice of a career, for he then entered the ministry and wassoon ordained a priest.He was made pastor of the church at Senj, an important seaport with facilitiesfor a cultural life. He gave satisfaction, but apparently he achieved successamong his parishioners on the basis of a pleasing personality and anunderstanding of problems rather than by using any great erudition intheological and ecclesiastical matters.A few years after he was placed in charge of this parish, a new archbishop,elevated to head of the diocese, wished to survey the capabilities of thepriests in his charge and offered a prize for the best sermon preached on hisofficial visit. The Rev. Milutin Tesla was bubbling over, at the time, withinterest in labor as a major factor in social and economic problems. To preach asermon on this topic was, from the viewpoint of expediency, a totallyimpractical thing to do. Nobody, however, had ever accused the Rev. Mr. Tesla ofbeing practical, so doing the impractical thing was quite in harmony with hisnature. He chose the subject which held his greatest interest; and when thearchbishop arrived, he listened to a sermon on “Labor.”Months later Senj was surprised by an unanticipated visit from the archbishop,who announced that the Rev. Mr. Tesla had preached the best sermon, and awardedhim a red sash which he was privileged to wear on all occasions. Shortlyafterward he was made pastor at Smiljan, where his parish then embraced fortyhomes. He was later placed in charge of the much larger parish in the near-bycity of Gospic. His first three children, Milka, Dane and Angelina, were born atSenj. Nikola and his younger sister, Marica, were born at Smiljan.Tesla’s early environment, then, was that of an agricultural community in a highplateau region near the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea in the VelebitMountains, a part of the Alps, a mountain chain stretching from Switzerland toGreece. He did not see his first steam locomotive until he was in his ‘teens, sohis aptitude for mechanical matters did not grow out of his environment.Tesla’s homeland is today called Yugoslavia, a country whose name means “Land ofthe Southern Slavs.” It embraces several former separate countries, Serbia,Bosnia, Croatia, Montenegro, Dalmatia and also Slovenia. The Tesla and Mandichfamilies originally came from the western part of Serbia near Montenegro.Smiljan, the village where Tesla was born, is in the province of Lika, and atthe time of his birth this was a dependent province held by the Austro-HungarianEmpire as part of Croatia and Slovenia.Tesla’s surname dates back more than two and a half centuries. Before that timethe family name was Draganic (pronounced as if spelled Drag’-a-nitch). The nameTesla (pronounced as spelled, with equal emphasis on both syllables), in apurely literal sense, is a trade name like Smith, Wright or Carpenter. As acommon noun it describes a woodworking tool which, in English, is called an adz.This is an axe with a broad cutting blade at right angles to the handle, insteadof parallel as in the more familiar form. It is used in cutting large treetrunks into squared timbers. In the Serbo-Croat language, the name of the toolis tesla. There is a tradition in the Draganic family that the members of onebranch were given the nickname “Tesla” because of an inherited trait whichcaused practically all of them to have very large, broad and protruding frontteeth which greatly resembled the triangular blade of the adz.The name Draganic and derivatives of it appear frequently in other branches ofthe Tesla family as a given name. When used as a given name it is frequentlytranslated “Charlotte,” but as a generic term it holds the meaning “dear” and asa surname is translated “Darling.”The majority of Tesla’s ancestors for whom age records are available lived wellbeyond the average span of life for their times, but no definite record has beenfound of the ancestor who, Tesla claimed, lived to be one hundred and fortyyears of age. (His father died at the age of fifty-nine, and his mother atseventy-one.)Although many of Tesla’s ancestors were dark eyed, his eyes were a gray-blue. Heclaimed his eyes were originally darker, but that as a result of the excessiveuse of his brain their color changed. His mother’s eyes, however, were gray andso are those of some of his nephews. It is probable, therefore, that his grayeyes were inherited, rather than faded by excessive use of the brain.Tesla grew to be very tall and very slender—tallness was a family and a nationaltrait. When he attained full growth he was exactly two meters, or six feet twoand one-quarter inches tall. While his body was slender, it was built withinnormal proportions. His hands, however, and particularly his thumbs, seemedunusually long.NIKOLA’S older brother Dane was a brilliant boy and his parents gloried in theirgood fortune in being blessed with such a fine son. There was, however, adifference of seven years in the two boys’ ages, and since the elder brotherdied as the result of an accident at the age of twelve, when Nikola was but fiveyears old, a fair comparison of the two seems hardly possible. The loss of theirfirst-born son was a great blow to his mother and father; the grief and regretsof the family were manifest in idealizing his talents and predictingpossibilities of greatness he might have realized, and this situation was achallenge to Nikola in his youth.The superman Tesla developed out of the superboy Nikola. Forced to rise abovethe normal level by an urge to carry on for his dearly beloved departed brother,and also on his own account to exceed the great accomplishment his brother mighthave attained had he lived, he unconsciously drew upon strange resources within.The existence of these resources might have remained unsuspected for a lifetime,as happens with the run of individuals, if Nikola had not felt the necessity forcreating a larger sphere of life for himself.He was aware as a boy that he was not like other boys in his thoughts, in hisamusements and in his hobbies. He could do the things that other lads his ageusually do, and many things that they could not do. It was these latter thingsthat interested him most, and he could find no companions who would share hisenthusiasms for them. This situation caused him to isolate himself fromcontemporaries, and made him aware that he was destined for an unusual place ifnot great accomplishments in life. His boyish mind was continually exploringrealms which his years had not reached, and his boyhood attainments frequentlywere worthy of men of mature age.He had, of course, the usual experience of unusual incidents that fall to thelot of a small boy. One of the earliest events which Tesla recalled was a fallinto a tank of hot milk that was being scalded in the process used by thenatives of that region as a hygienic measure, anticipating the modern process ofpasteurizing.Shortly afterward he was accidentally locked in a remote mountain chapel whichwas visited only at widely separated intervals. He spent the night in the smallbuilding before his absence was discovered and his possible hiding placedetermined.Living close to Nature, with ample opportunity for observing the flight ofbirds, which has ever filled men with envy, he did what many another boy hasdone with the same results. An umbrella, plus imagination, offered to him acertain solution of the problem of free flight through the air. The roof of abarn was his launching platform. The umbrella was large, but its condition wasmuch the worse for many years of service; it turned inside out before the flightwas well started. No bones were broken, but he was badly shaken up and spent thenext six weeks in bed. Probably, though, he had better reason for making thisexperiment than most of the others who have tried it. He revealed thatpractically all his life he experienced a peculiar reaction when breathingdeeply. When he breathed deeply he was overcome by a feeling of lightness, as ifhis body had lost all weight; and he should, he concluded, be able to flythrough the air merely by his will to do so. He did not learn, in boyhood, thathe was unusual in this respect.One day when he was in his fifth year, one of his chums received a gift of afishing line, and all the boys in the group planned a fishing trip. On that dayhe was on the outs with his chums for some unremembered reason. As a result, hewas informed he could not join them. He was not permitted even to see thefishing line at close range. He had glimpsed, however, the general idea of ahook on the end of a string. In a short time he had fashioned his owninterpretation of a hook. The refinement of a barb had not occurred to him andhe also failed to evolve the theory of using bait when he went off on his ownfishing expedition. The baitless hook failed to attract any fish but, whiledangling in the air, much to Tesla’s surprise and satisfaction it snared a frogthat leaped at it. He came home with a bag of nearly two dozen frogs. It mayhave been a day on which the fish were not biting, but at any rate his chumscame home from the use of their new hook and line without any fish. His triumphwas complete. When he later revealed his technique, all the boys in theneighborhood copied his hook and method, and in a short time the frog populationof the region was greatly depleted.The contents of birds’ nests always excited Tesla’s curiosity. He rarelydisturbed their contents or occupants. On one occasion, however, he climbed arocky crag to investigate an eagle’s nest and took from it a baby eagle which hekept locked in a barn. A bird on the wing he considered fair prey for his slingshot, with which he was a star performer.About this time he became intrigued with a piece of hollow tube cut from a canegrowing in the neighborhood. This he played with until he had evolved a blow gunand later, by making a plunger and plugging one end of the tube with a wad ofwet hemp, a pop gun. He then undertook the making of larger pop guns, andcontrived one in which the end of the plunger was held against the chest and thetube pulled energetically toward the body. He engaged in the manufacture of thisarticle for his chums, as a five-year-old businessman. When a number of windowpanes happened to get broken accidentally by getting in the way of his hemp wad,his inventive proclivities in this field were quickly curbed by the destructionof the pop guns and the administration of the parental rod.Tesla started his formal education by attending the village school in Smiljanbefore he reached his fifth birthday. A few years later his father received hisappointment as pastor of a church in the near-by city of Gospic, so the familymoved there. This was a sad day for young Tesla. He had lived close to Nature,and loved the open country and the high mountains among which he had thus farspent all of his life. The sudden transition to the artificialities of the citywas a very definite shock to him. He was out of harmony with his newsurroundings.His advent into the city life of Gospic, at the age of seven, got off to anunfortunate start. As the new minister in town, his father was anxious to haveeverything move smoothly. Tesla was required to dress in his best clothes andattend the Sunday services. Naturally, he dreaded this ordeal and was very happywhen assigned the task of ringing the bell summoning the worshipers to theservice and announcing the close of the ceremonies. This gave him an opportunityto remain unseen in the belfry while the parishioners, their daughters and dudesons were arriving and departing.Thinking he had waited long enough after the close of the service for the churchto be cleared on this first Sunday, he came downstairs three steps at a time. Awealthy woman parishioner wearing a skirt with a long train that fashionablydragged along the ground, and who had come to the service with a retinue ofservants, remained after the other parishioners to have a talk with the newpastor. She was just making an impressive exit when Tesla’s final jump down thestairs landed him on the train, ripping this dignity-preserving appendage fromthe woman’s dress. Her mortification and rage and his father’s anger came uponhim simultaneously. Parishioners loitering outside rushed back to revel in thespectacle. Thereafter no one dared be pleasant to this youngster who had enragedthe wealthy dowager who domineered it over the social community. He waspractically ostracized by the parishioners, and continued so until he redeemedhimself in a spectacular manner.Tesla felt strange and defeated in his ignorance of city ways. He met thesituation first by avoidance. He did not care to leave his home. The boys of hisage were neatly dressed every day. There were dudes and he did not belong. Evenas a child Tesla was meticulously careful in dress. At the earliest moment,however, he would slip work clothes over his dress clothes and go wandering inthe woods or engage in mechanical work. He could not enjoy life if limited tothe activities in which he could engage while dressed up. Tesla, however,possessed ingenuity, and there was rarely a situation in which he was not ableto use it. He also possessed knowledge of the ways of Nature. These gave him adistinct superiority over the city boys.About a year after the family moved to Gospic a new fire company was organized.It was to be supplied with a pump which would replace the useful but inadequatebucket brigade. The members of the new organization obtained brightly coloreduniforms and practiced marching for parades. Eventually the new pump arrived. Itwas a man-power pump to be operated by sixteen men. A parade and demonstrationof the new apparatus was arranged. Almost everyone in Gospic turned out for theevent and followed to the river front for the pump demonstration. Tesla wasamong them. He paid no attention to the speeches but was all eyes for thebrightly painted apparatus. He did not know how it worked but would have lovedto take it apart and investigate the insides.The time for the demonstration came when the last speaker, finishing hisdedicatory address, gave the order to start the pumping operation that wouldsend a stream of water shooting skyward from the nozzle. The eight menregimented on either side of the pump bowed and rose in alternate unison as theyraised and lowered the bars that operated the pistons of the pump. But nothingelse happened, not a drop of water came from the nozzle!Officials of the fire company started feverishly to make adjustments and, aftereach attempt, set the sixteen men oscillating up and down at the pump handles,but each time without results. The lines of hose between the pump and the nozzlewere straightened out, they were disconnected from the pump and connected again.But no water came from the far end of the hose to reward the efforts of theperspiring firemen.Tesla was among the usual group of urchins that always manages to get inside thelines on such occasions. He tried to see everything that was going on from theclosest possible vantage point and undoubtedly got on the nerves of the vexedofficials when their repeated efforts were frustrated by continuous failures. Asone of the officials turned for the tenth time to vent his frustration on theurchins and order them away from his range of action, Tesla grabbed him by thearm.“I know what to do, Mister,” said Tesla. “You keep pumping.”Dashing for the river, Tesla peeled his clothes off quickly and dove into thewater. He swam to the suction hose that was supposed to draw the water supplyfrom the river. He found it kinked, so that no water could flow into it, andflattened by the vacuum created by the pumping. When he straightened out thekink, the water rushed into the line. The nozzlemen had stood at their post fora long time, receiving a continuous repetition of warnings to be prepared eachtime an adjustment was made, but, as nothing happened on these successiveoccasions, they had gradually relaxed their attention and were giving littlethought to the direction in which the nozzle was pointed. When the stream ofwater did shoot skyward, down it came on the assembled officials andtownspeople. This item of unexpected drama excited the crowd at the other end ofthe line near the pump, and to give vent to their joy they seized the scantilydressed Tesla, boosted him to the shoulders of a couple of the firemen, and leda procession around the town. The seven-year-old Tesla was the hero of the day.Later on Tesla, in explaining the incident, said that he had had not thefaintest idea of how the pump worked; but as he watched the men struggle withit, he got an intuitive flash of knowledge that told him to go to the hose inthe river. On looking back to that event, he said, he knew how Archimedes musthave felt when, after discovering the law of the displacement of water byfloating objects, he ran naked through the streets of Syracuse shouting“Eureka!”AT THE age of seven Tesla had tasted the pleasures of public acclaim for hisingenuity. And further, he had done something which the dudes, the boys of hisage in the city, could not do and which even their fathers could not do. He hadfound himself. He was now a hero, and it could be forgotten that he had jumpedon a woman’s skirt and ripped the train off.Tesla never lost an opportunity to hike through the near-by mountains where hecould again enjoy the pleasures of his earlier years spent so close to Nature.On these occasions he would often wonder if there was still operating a crudewater wheel which he made and installed, when he was less than five years old,across the mountain brook near his home in Smiljan.The wheel consisted of a not too well-smoothed disk cut from a tree trunk insome lumbering operations. Through its center he was able to cut a hole andforce into it a somewhat straight branch of a tree, the ends of which he restedin two sticks with crotches which he forced into the rock on either bank of thebrook. This arrangement permitted the lower part of the disk to dip in the waterand the current caused it to rotate. To the lad there was a great deal oforiginality employed in making this ancient device. The wheel wobbled a bit butto him it was a marvelous piece of construction, and he got no end of pleasureout of watching his water wheel obtain power from the brook.This experiment undoubtedly made a life-long impression on his young plasticmind and endowed him with the desire, ever afterward manifested in his work, ofobtaining power from Nature’s sources which are always being dissipated andalways being replenished.In this smooth-disk water wheel we find an early clue to his later invention ofthe smooth-disk turbine. In his later experience he discovered that all waterwheels have paddles—but his little water wheel had operated without paddles.Tesla’s first experiment in original methods of power production was made whenhe was nine years old. It demonstrated his ingenuity and originality, if nothingelse. It was a sixteen-bug-power engine. He took two thin sliver* of wood, asthick as a toothpick and several times as long, and glued them together in theform of a cross, so they looked like the arms of a windmill. At the point ofintersection they were glued to a spindle made of another thin sliver of wood.On this he slipped a very small pulley with about the diameter of a pea. A pieceof thread acting as a driving belt was slipped over this and also around thecircumference of a much larger but light pulley which was also mounted on a thinspindle. The power for this machine was furnished by sixteen May bugs (June bugsin the United States). He had collected a jar full of the insects, which werevery much of a pest in the neighborhood. With a little dab of glue four bugswere affixed, heading in the same direction, to each of the four arms of thewindmill arrangement. The bugs beat their wings, and if they had been free wouldhave flown away at high speed. They were, however, attached to the cross arms,so instead they pulled them around at high speed. These, being connected by thethread belt to the large pulley, caused the latter to turn at low speed; but itdeveloped, Tesla reports, a surprisingly large torque, or turning power.Proud of his bug-power motor and its continous operation—the bugs did not ceaseflying for hours—he called in one of the boys in the neighborhood to admire it.The lad was a son of ah Army officer. The visitor was amused for a short time bythe bug motor, until he spied the jar of still unused May bugs. Withouthesitation he opened the jar, fished out the bugs—and ate them. This sonauseated Tesla that he chased the boy out of the house and destroyed the bugmotor. For years he could not tolerate the sight of May bugs without a return ofthis unpleasant reaction.This event greatly annoyed Tesla because he had planned to add more spindles tothe shaft and stick on more fliers until he had more than aone-hundred-bug-power motor."},{"pageContent":"TWOimage [images/00003.jpg] TESLA’S years in school were more important for the activities in which heengaged in after-school hours than for what he learned in the classroom. At theage of ten, having finished his elementary studies in the Normal School, Teslaentered the college, called the Real Gymnasium, at Gospic. This was not anunusually early age to enter the Real Gymnasium, as that school corresponds moreto our grammar school and junior high school than to our college.One of the requirements, and one to which an unusually large percentage of theclass time was devoted throughout the four years, was freehand drawing. Tesladetested the subject almost to the point of open rebellion, and his marks wereaccordingly very low, but not entirely owing to a lack of ability.Tesla was left-handed as a boy, but later became ambidextrous. Left-handednesswas a definite handicap in the freehand-drawing studies, but he could have donemuch better work than he actually produced and would have gotten higher marks ifit were not for a piece of altruism in which he engaged. A student whom he couldexcel in drawing was striving hard for a scholarship. Were he to receive thelowest marks in freehand drawing, he would be unable to obtain the scholarship.Tesla sought to help his fellow student by intentionally getting the lowestrating in the small class.Mathematics was his favorite subject and he distinguished himself in that study.His unusual proficiency in this field was not considered a counterbalancingvirtue to make amends for his lack of enthusiasm for freehand drawing. A strangepower permitted him to perform unusual feats in mathematics. He possessed itfrom early boyhood, but had considered it a nuisance and tried to be rid of itbecause it seemed beyond his control.If he thought of an object it would appear before him exhibiting the appearanceof solidity and massiveness. So greatly did these visions possess the attributesof actual objects that it was usually difficult for him to distinguish betweenvision and reality. This abnormal faculty functioned in a very useful fashion inhis school work with mathematics.If he was given a problem in arithmetic or algebra, it was immaterial to himwhether he went to the blackboard to work it out or whether he remained in hisseat. His strange faculty permitted him to see a visioned blackboard on whichthe problem was written, and there appeared on this blackboard all of theoperations and symbols required in working out the solution. Each step appearedmuch more rapidly than he could work it out by hand on the actual slate. As aresult, he could give the solution almost as quickly as the whole problem wasstated.His teachers, at first, had some doubts about his honesty, thinking he hadworked out some clever deceit for getting the right answers. In due time theirskepticism was dispelled and they accepted him as a student who was unusuallyapt at mental arithmetic. He would not reveal this power to anyone and woulddiscuss it only with his mother, who in the past had encouraged him in hisefforts to banish it. Now that the power had demonstrated some definiteusefulness, though, he was not so anxious to be completely rid of it, butdesired to bring it under his complete control.Work that Tesla did outside school hours interested him much more than hisschool work. He was a rapid reader and had a memory that was retentive to thepoint, almost, of infallibility. He found it easy to acquire foreign languages.In addition to his native Serbo-Croat language he became proficient in the useof German, French and Italian. This opened to him great stores of knowledge towhich other students did not have access, yet this knowledge, apparently, was oflittle use to him in his school work. He was interested in things mechanical butthe school provided no manual training course. Nevertheless, he becameproficient in the working of wood and metals with tools and methods of his owncontriving.In the classroom of one of the upper grades of the Real Gymnasium models ofwater wheels were on exhibition. They were not working models but neverthelessthey aroused Tesla’s enthusiasm. They recalled to him the crude wheel he hadconstructed in the hills of Smiljan. He had seen pictures of the magnificentNiagara Falls. Coupling the power possibilities presented by the majesticwaterfalls and the intriguing possibilities he saw in the models of the waterwheels, he aroused in himself a passion to accomplish a grand achievement.Waxing eloquent on the subject, he told his father, “Some day I am going toAmerica and harness Niagara Falls to produce power.” Thirty years later he wasto see this prediction fulfilled.There were many books in his father’s library. The knowledge in those booksinterested him more than that which he received in school and he wished to spendhis evenings reading them. As in other matters, he carried this to an extreme,so his father forbade him to read them, fearing that he would ruin his eyes inthe poor light of tallow candles then used for illumination. Nikola sought tocircumvent this ruling by taking candles to his room and reading after he wassent to bed, but his violation of orders was soon discovered and the familycandle supply was hidden. Next he fashioned a candle mould out of a piece of tinand made his own candles. Then, by plugging the keyhole and the chinks aroundthe door, he was able to spend the night hours reading volumes purloined fromhis father’s bookshelves. Frequently, he said, he would read through the entirenight and feel none the worse for the loss of sleep. Eventual discovery,however, brought paternal discipline of a vigorous nature. He was about elevenyears old at this time.Like other boys of his age he played with bows and arrows. He made bigger bows,and better, straighter shooting arrows, and his marksmanship was excellent. Hewas not willing to stop at that point. He started building arbalists. Thesecould be described as bow-and-arrow guns. The bow is mounted on a frame and thestring pulled back and caught on a peg from which it is released by a trigger.The arrow is laid on the midpoint of the bow, its end against the taut string.The bow lies horizontal on the frame whereas in ordinary manual shooting the bowis held in vertical position. For this reason the device is sometimes called thecrossbow. In setting an arbalist the beam is placed against the abdomen and thestring pulled back with all possible force. Tesla did this so often, he said,that his skin at the point of pressure became calloused until it was more like acrocodile’s hide. When shot into the air the arrows from his arbalist were neverrecovered, for they went far out of sight. At close range they would passthrough a pine board an inch thick.Tesla got a thrill out of archery not experienced by other boys. He was, inimagination, riding those arrows which he shot out of sight into the blue vaultof the heavens. That sense of exhilaration he experienced when breathing deeplygave him such a feeling of lightness he convinced himself that in this state itwould be relatively easy for him to fly through the air if he only could devisesome mechanical aid that would launch. him and enable him to overcome what hethought was only a slight remaining weight in his body. His earlier disastrousjump from the barn roof had not disillusioned him. His conclusions were inkeeping with his sensations; but a twelve-year-old lad exploring this difficultfield alone cannot be condemned too severely for not discovering that our sensessometimes deceive us, or rather that we sometimes deceive ourselves ininterpreting what our senses tell us.In breathing deeply he was overventilating his lungs, taking out some of theresidual carbon dioxide which is chemical “ashes,” and largely inert, andreplacing it with air containing a mixture of equally inert nitrogen and veryactive oxygen. The latter being present in more than normal proportionsimmediately began to upset chemical balances throughout the body. The reactionon the brain produces a result which does not differ greatly from alcoholintoxication. A number of cults use this procedure to induce “mystical” or“occult” experiences. How was a twelve-year-old boy to know all these things? Hecould see that birds did an excellent job in flying. He was convinced that someday man would fly, and he wanted to produce the machine that would get him offthe ground and into the air.The big idea came to him when he learned about the vacuum—a space within acontainer from which all air had been exhausted. He learned that every objectexposed to the air was under a pressure of about fourteen pounds per squareinch, while in a vacuum objects were free of such pressure. He figured that apressure of fourteen pounds should turn a cylinder at high speed and he couldarrange to get advantage of such pressure by surrounding one half of a cylinderwith a vacuum and having the remaining half of its surface exposed to airpressure. He carefully built a box of wood. At one end was an opening into whicha cylinder was fitted with a very high order of accuracy, so that the box wouldbe airtight; and on one side of the cylinder the edge of the box made aright-angle contact. On the cylinder’s other side the box made a tangent, orflat, contact. This arrangement was made because he wanted the air pressure tobe exerted at a tangent to the surface of the cylinder—a situation that he knewwould be required in order to produce rotation. If he could get that cylinder torotate, all he would have to do in order to fly would be to attach a propellerto a shaft from the cylinder, strap the box to his body and obtain continuouspower from his vacuum box that would lift him through the air. His theory ofcourse was fallacious, but he had no means of knowing that at the time.The workmanship on this box was undoubtedly of a very high order, considering itwas made by a self-instructed twelve-year-old mechanic. When he connected hisvacuum pump, an ordinary air pump with its valves reversed, he found the box wasairtight, so he pulled out all the air, watching the cylinder intently whiledoing so. Nothing happened for many strokes of the pump except that it made hisback lame to pull the pump handle upward while he created the most “powerful”possible vacuum. He rested for a moment. He was breathing deeply from exertion,overventilating his lungs, and getting that joyous, dizzy, light-as-air feelingwhich was a highly satisfactory mental environment for his experiment.Suddenly the cylinder started to turn—slowly! His experiment was a success! Hisvacuum-power box was working! He would fly!Tesla was delirious with joy. He went into a state of ecstasy. There was no onewith whom he could share this joy, as he had taken no one into his confidence.It was his secret and he was forced to endure its joys alone. The cylindercontinued to turn slowly. It was no hallucination. It was real. It did not speedup, however, and this was disappointing. He had visualized it turning at atremendous speed but it was actually turning extremely slowly. His idea, atleast, he figured, was correct. With a little better workmanship, perhaps hecould make the cylinder turn faster. He stood spellbound watching it turn at asnail’s pace for less than half a minute—and then the cylinder stopped. Thatbroke the spell and ended for the time his mental air flights.He hunted for the trouble and quickly located what he was sure was the cause ofthe difficulty. Since the vacuum, he theorized, is the source of power, then, ifthe power stops, it must be because the vacuum is gone. His pump, he felt sure,must be leaking air. He pulled up the handle. It came up easily and that meantvery definitely he had lost the vacuum in the box. He again pumped out theair—and again when he reached a high vacuum the cylinder started to turn slowlyand continued to do so for a fraction of a minute. When it stopped he againpumped a vacuum and again the cylinder turned. This time he continued to operatethe pump and the cylinder continued to turn. He could keep it turning as long ashe desired by continuing to pump the vacuum.There was nothing wrong with his theory, as far as he could see. He went overthe pump very carefully, making improvements which would give him a high vacuum,and studied the valve to make that a better guard of the vacuum in the box. Heworked on the project for weeks but despite his best efforts he could get nobetter results than the slow movement of the cylinder.Finally the truth came to him in a flash—he was losing the vacuum in the boxbecause the air was leaking in around the cylinder on that side where the flatboard was tangent to the surface of the cylinder. As the air flowed into the boxit pulled the cylinder around with it very slowly. When the air stopped flowinginto the box the cylinder stopped turning. He knew now his theory was wrong. Hehad supposed that even with the vacuum being maintained, and no air leaking in,the air pressure would be exerted at a tangent to the surface of the cylinderand the pressure would produce motion in the same way as pushing on the rim of awheel will cause it to turn. He discovered later, however, that the air pressureis exerted at right angles to the surface of the cylinder at all points, likethe direction of the spokes of a wheel, and therefore it could not be used toproduce rotation in the way he planned.This experiment, nevertheless, was not a total loss, even though it greatlydisheartened him. The knowledge that the air leaking into a vacuum had actuallyproduced even a small amount of rotation in a cylinder remained with him and leddirectly, many years later, to his invention of the “Tesla turbine,” the steamengine that broke all records for horsepower developed per pound of weight—whathe called “a power house in a hat.”NATURE seemed to be constantly engaged in staging spectacular demonstrations foryoung Tesla, revealing to him samples of the secret of her mighty forces.Tesla was roaming in the mountains with some chums one winter day after a stormin which the snow fell moist and sticky. A small snowball rolled on the ground,quickly gathered more snow to itself and soon became a big one that was not tooeasy to move. Tiring of making snowmen and snow houses on level stretches ofground, the boys took to throwing snowballs down the sloping ground of themountain. Most of them were duds—that is, they got stalled in the soft snowbefore they accumulated additional volume. A few rolled a distance, grew largerand then bogged down and stopped. One, however, found just the right conditions;it rolled until it was a large ball and then spread out, rolling up the snow atthe sides as if it were rolling up a giant carpet, and then suddenly it turnedinto an avalanche. Soon an irresistible mass of snow was moving down, the steepslope. It stripped the mountainside clean of snow, trees, soil and everythingelse it could carry before it and with it. The great mass landed in the valleybelow with a thud that shook the mountain. The boys were frightened becausethere was snow above them on the mountain that might have been shaken into adownward slide, carrying them along buried in it.This event made a profound impression on Tesla and it dominated a great deal ofhis thinking in later life. He had witnessed a snowball weighing a few ouncesstarting an irresistible, devastating movement of thousands of tons of inertmatter. It convinced him that there are tremendous forces locked up in Naturethat can be released in gigantic amounts, for useful as well as destructivepurposes, by the employment of small trigger forces. He was always on thelookout for such triggers in his later experiments.Tesla even as a boy was an original thinker and he never hesitated to thinkthoughts on a grand scale, always carrying everything to its largest ultimatedimension as a means of exploring the cosmos. This is demonstrated by anotherevent that took place the following summer. He was wandering alone in themountains when storm clouds started to fill the sky. There was a flash oflightning and almost immediately a deluge of rain descended on him.There was implanted in his thirteen-year-old mind on that occasion a thoughtwhich he carried with him practically all his life. He saw the lightning flashand then saw the rain come down in torrents, so he reasoned that the lightningflash produced the downpour. The idea become firmly fixed in his mind thatelectricity controlled the rain, and that if one could produce lightning atwill, the weather would be brought under control. Then there would be no dryperiods in which crops would be ruined; deserts could be turned into vineyards,the food supply of the world would be greatly increased, and there would be nolack of food anywhere on the globe. Why could he not produce lightning?The observation and the conclusions drawn from it by young Tesla were worthy ofa more mature mind, and it would require a genius among the adults to haveevolved the project of controlling the world’s weather through such means. Therewas, however, a flaw in his observation. He saw the lightning come first and therain afterward. Further investigation would have revealed to him that the orderof events was reversed higher in the air. It was the rain that came first andthe lightning afterward up in the cloud. The lightning, however, arrived firstbecause it made the trip from the cloud in less than 1/100,000 of a second,while the raindrops required several seconds to fall to the ground.At this time there was planted in Tesla’s mind the seed of a project whichmatured more than thirty years later when, in the mountains of Colorado, heactually produced bolts of lightning, and planned later to use them to bringrain. He never succeeded in convincing the U. S. Patent Office of thepracticability of the rain-making plan.Tesla, as a boy, knew no limits to the universe of his thinking; and as a resulthe built an intellectual realm sufficiently large to provide ample space inwhich his more mature mind could operate without encountering retardingbarriers.TESLA finished his course at the Real Gymnasium in Gospic in 1870, at the age offourteen. He had distinguished himself as a scholar. In one grade, however, hismathematics professor gave him less than a passing mark for his year’s work.Tesla felt an injustice had been done him, so he went to the director of theschool and demanded that he be given the strictest kind of examination in thesubject. This was done in the presence of the director and the professor, andTesla passed it with an almost perfect mark.His fine work at school and the recognition by the townspeople that he possesseda broader scope of knowledge than any other youth in town led the trustees ofthe public library to ask him to classify the books in their possession and makea catalogue. He had already read most of the books in his father’s extensivelibrary, so he was pleased to have close access to a still larger collection andundertook the task with considerable enthusiasm. He had scarcely begun work onthis project when it was interrupted by a long intermittent illness. When hefelt too depressed to go to the library he had quantities of the books broughtto his home, and these he read while confined to his bed. His illness reached acritical stage and physicians gave up hope of saving his life.Tesla’s father knew that he was a delicate child and, having lost his other son,tried to throw every possible safeguard around this one. He was greatly pleasedover his son’s brilliant accomplishments in almost every activity in which heengaged, but he recognized as a danger to Nikola’s health the great intensitywith which he tackled projects. Nikola’s trend toward engineering was to him adangerous development, as he thought work in that field would make too heavydemands upon him, not only because of the nature of the work but in the extendedyears of study in which he would have to engage. If, however, the boy enteredthe ministry, it would not be necessary for him to extend his studies beyond theReal Gymnasium which he had just completed. For this reason his father favored acareer for him in the Church.Illness threw everything into a somber aspect. When the critical stage of hisillness was reached and his strength was at its lowest ebb, Nikola manifested noinclination to help himself get better by developing an enthusiasm for anything.It was in this stage of his illness that he glanced listlessly at one of thelibrary books. It was a volume by Mark Twain. The book held his interest andthen aroused his enthusiasm for life, enabling him to pass a crisis, and hishealth gradually returned to normal. Tesla credited the Mark Twain book withsaving his life, and when, years later, he met Twain, they became very closefriends.At the age of fifteen Tesla, in 1870, continued his studies at the Higher RealGymnasium, corresponding to our college, at Karlovac (Carlstadt) in Croatia. Hisattendance at this school was made possible by an invitation from a cousin ofhis father’s, married to a Col. Brankovic, whose home was in Karlovac, to comeand live with her and her husband, a retired Army officer, while attendingschool. His life there was none too happy. Scarcely had he arrived when hecontracted malaria from the mosquitoes in the Karlovac lowlands, and he wasnever free from the malady for years afterward.Tesla relates that he was hungry all during the three years he spent atKarlovac. There was plenty of deliciously prepared food in the home, but hisaunt held the theory that because his health seemed none too rugged he shouldnot eat heavy meals. Her husband, a gruff and rugged individual, when carving asecond helping for himself, would sometimes try to slip a healthy slice of meatonto Tesla’s plate; but the Colonel was always overruled by his wife, who wouldtake back the slice and carve one to the thinness of a sheet of paper, warningher husband, “Niko is delicate and we must be very careful not to overload hisstomach.”His studies at Karlovac interested him, however, and he completed the four-yearcourse in three years, tackling the school work with a dangerous enthusiasm,partly as an escape mechanism to divert his attention from the none too pleasingconditions where he was living. The lasting favorable impression which Teslacarried away from Karlovac concerned his professor of physics, a clever andoriginal experimenter, who amazed him with the feats he performed withlaboratory apparatus. He could not get enough of this course. He wanted todevote his whole time henceforth to electrical experimenting. He knew he wouldnot be satisfied in any other field. His mind was made up; he had selected hiscareer.His father wrote to him shortly before his graduation advising him not to returnhome when school was closed but to go on a long hunting trip. Tesla, however,was anxious to get home—to surprise his parents with the good news that he hadcompleted his work at the Higher Real Gymnasium a year ahead of schedule, and toannounce his decision to make the study of electricity his life work. Greatlyworried, his parents, who at that moment were making strenuous efforts toprotect his health, were doubly alarmed. First, there was his violation of theinstruction sent him not to return to Gospic. The reason for this advice theyhad not disclosed—an epidemic of cholera was raging. And second, there was hisdecision to enter on a career which they feared would make dangerous demands onhis delicate health. On returning home, he found his plan definitely opposed.This made him very unhappy. In addition, he would shortly have to face asituation which was even more repugnant than entering upon a career in theChurch, and that was the compulsory three-years’ service in the Army. Those twopowerful factors were operating against him and seeking to thwart him in hisburning desire to start immediately unraveling the mystery and harnessing thegreat power of electricity.Nothing, he thought, could exceed the difficulty of the predicament in which hefound himself. In this, however, he was mistaken, for he was soon to face a muchmore serious problem. On the very day after his arrival home, while these issueswere still red hot, he became ill with cholera. He had come home malnourishedbecause of the inadequate amount of food to which he had been limited and thestrain of his intense application to his studies. Besides, he was stillsuffering from malaria. Then came the cholera. Now all other problems becamesecondary to the immediate one of maintaining life itself against the deadlyscourge. His physical condition made the doctors despair of saving him.Nevertheless, he survived the crisis, but it left him in a thoroughly weakenedand run-down condition. For nine months he lay in bed almost a physical wreck.He had frequent sinking spells and from each successive one it seemed harder torally him.Life held no incentive for him. If he survived he would be forced to enter theArmy and, if nothing happened to prevent him from finishing that term ofsomething worse than slavery, he would be forced to study for the ministry. Hedid not care whether he survived or not. Left to his own decision, he would nothave rallied from earlier sinking spells; but the decision was not left to him.Some force stronger than his own consciousness carried him through, but it hadto succeed in spite of him and not because of any assistance he was giving. Thesinking spells came on with startling regularity, each one with increasingdepth. It seemed a miracle that he had come out of the last one, and now withless reserve strength he was sinking into another and edging rapidly intounconsciousness. His father entered his room and tried desperately to rouse himand stir him to a more cheerful and hopeful atitude in which he could helphimself and do more than the doctors could do for him, but without results.“I could—get well—if you—would let me—study—electrical—engineering,” said theprostrate young man in a hardly audible whisper. He had scarcely enough energyleft for even this effort; and having made the speech, he seemed to be droppingover the edge of nothingness. His father, bending intently over him and fearingthe end had come, seized him.“Nikola,” he commanded, “you cannot go. You must stay. You will be an engineer.Do you hear me? You will go to the best engineering school in the world and youwill be a great engineer. Nikola, you must come back, you must come back andbecome a great engineer.”The eyes of the prostrate figure opened slowly. Now there was a light shining inthe eyes where before they presented a deathlike glaze. The face moved a little,very little, but the slight change this movement made seemed to be in thedirection of a smile. It was a smile, a weak one, and he was able to keep hiseyes open although it was very apparently a struggle for him to do so.“Thank God!” said his father. “You heard me, Nikola. You will go to anengineering school and become a great engineer. Do you understand me?”There was not enough energy for voice but the smile became a little moredefinite.Another crisis in which he had escaped death by the narrowest margin had beenpassed. His rise out of this situation seemed almost miraculous. It seemed tohim, Tesla later related, that from that instant he felt as if he were drawingvital energy from his loved ones who surrounded him; and this he used to rallyhimself out of the shadow.He was again able to whisper. “I will get well,” he said weakly. He breatheddeeply, as deep as his frail tired frame would permit, of the oxygen which hehad found so stimulating in the past. It was the first time he had done so inthe nine months since he became ill. With each breath he felt reinvigorated. Heseemed to get stronger by the minute.In a very short time he was taking nourishment and within a week he was able tosit up. In a few days more he was on his feet. Life now would be glorious. Hewould be an electrical engineer. Everything he dreamed of would come true. Asthe days passed he recovered his strength at a remarkably rapid rate and hishearty appetite returned. It was now early summer. He would prepare himself toenter the fall term at an engineering school.But there was something he had forgotten, everyone in the family had forgotten,in the stress of his months of illness. It was now brought sharply to his andtheir attention. An Army summons—he must face three years’military servitude!Was his remarkable recovery to be ruined by this catastrophe, which seemed allthe worse now that his chosen career seemed otherwise nearer? Failure to respondto a military summons meant jail—and after that the service in addition. Howwould he solve this problem?There is no record of what took place. This spot in his career Tesla glossedover with the statement that his father considered it advisable for him to gooff on a year’s hunting expedition to recover his health. At any rate, Nikoladisappeared. He left with a hunting outfit and some books and paper. Where hespent the year, no one knows—probably at some hideaway in the mountains. In themeantime, he was a fugitive from Army service.For any ordinary individual this situation would be a most serious one. ForTesla it had all the gravity associated with ordinary cases, plus thecomplication that his family on his father’s side was a traditional militaryfamily whose members had won high rank and honors in Army activities, and manyof whom were now in the service of Austria-Hungary. For a member of that familyto become equivalent to a “draft dodger” and a “conscientious objector,” both,was a serious blow to its prestige, and could provoke a scandal if word of thesituation got into circulation. Tesla’s father used this circumstance and thefact of Nikola’s delicate health as talking points to induce his relatives inArmy positions to use their influence to enable his son to escape conscriptionand avoid punishment for failing to respond to the Army call. In this he wassuccessful, apparently, but required considerable time in which to make thearrangements.Hiding in the mountains and with a year’s time to kill, on this enforcedvacation Tesla was able to indulge in working out totally fantastic plans forsome gigantic projects. One of the plans was for the construction and operationof an under-ocean tube, connecting Europe and the United States, by which mailcould be transported in spherical containers moved through the tube by waterpressure. He discovered early in his calculations that the friction of the wateron the walls of the tube would require such a tremendous amount of power toovercome it that it made the project totally impracticable. Since, however, hewas working on the project entirely for his own amusement, he eliminatedfriction from the calculations and was then able to design a very interestingsystem of high-speed intercontinental mail delivery. The factor which made thisinteresting project impracticable—the drag of the water on the sides of thetube—Tesla was later to utilize when he invented his novel steam turbine.The other project with which he amused himself was drawn upon an even largerscale and required a still higher order of imagination. He conceived the projectof building a ring around the earth at the Equator, somewhat resembling therings around the planet Saturn. The earth ring, however, was to be a solidstructure whereas Saturn’s rings are made up of dust particles.Tesla loved to work with mathematics, and this project gave him an excellentopportunity to use all of the mathematical techniques available to him. The ringwhich Tesla planned was to be a rigid structure constructed on a gigantic systemof scaffolding extending completely around the earth. Once the ring wascomplete, the scaffolding was to be removed and the ring would stay suspended inspace and rotating at the same speed as the earth.Some use might be found for the project, Tesla said, if someone could find ameans of providing reactionary forces that could make the ring stand still withrespect to the earth while the latter whirled underneath it at a speed of 1,000miles per hour. This would provide a high-speed “moving” platform system oftransportation which would make it possible for a person to travel around theearth in a single day.In this project, he admitted, he encountered the same problem as did Archimedes,who said “Give me a fulcrum and a lever long enough and I will move the earth.”“The fulcrum in space on which to rest the lever was no more attainable than wasthe reactionary force needed to halt the spinning of the hypothetical ringaround the earth,” said Tesla. There were a number of other factors which hefound necessary to ignore in this project, but ignore them he did so that theywould not interfere with his mathematical practice and his cosmical engineeringplans.With his health regained, and the danger of punishment by the Army removed,Tesla returned to his home in Gospic to remain a short time before going toGrätz, where he was to study electrical engineering as his father had promisedhe could do. This marked the turning point in his life. Finished with boyhooddreams and play, he was now ready to settle down to his serious life work. Hehad played at being a god, not hesitating to plan refashioning the earth as aplanet. His life work was to produce accomplishments hardly less fantastic thanhis boyhood dreams.THREEimage [images/00003.jpg] TESLA entered manhood with a definite knowledge that nameless forces wereshaping for him an unrevealed destiny. It was a situation he had to feel ratherthan be able to identify and describe in words. His goal he could not see andthe course leading to it he could not discern. He knew very definitely the fieldin which he intended to spend his life, and using such physical laws as he knewhe decided to plan a life which, as an engineering project, would be operatedunder principles that would yield the highest index of efficiency. He did not,at this time, have a complete plan of life drawn up, but there were certainelements which he knew intuitively he would not include in his operations, so heavoided all activities and interests that would bring them in as complications.It was to be a single-purpose life, devoted entirely to science with noprovisions whatever for play or romance.It was with this philosophy of life that Tesla in 1875, at the age of 19, wentto Gratz, in Austria, to study electrical engineering at the PolytechnicInstitute. He intended henceforth to devote all his energies to mastering thatstrange, almost occult force, electricity, and to harness it for human welfare.His first effort to put this philosophy to a practical test almost resulted indisaster despite the fact that it worked successfully. Tesla completelyeliminated recreation and plunged into his studies with such enthusiasticdevotion that he allowed himself only four hours’rest, not all of which he spentin slumber. He would go to bed at eleven o’clock and read himself to sleep. Hewas up again in the small hours of the morning, tackling his studies.Under such a schedule he was able to pass, at the end of the first term, hisexaminations in nine subjects—nearly twice as many as were required. Hisdiligence greatly impressed the members of the faculty. The dean of thetechnical faculty wrote to Tesla’s father, “Your son is a star of first rank.”The strain, however, was affecting his health. He desired to make a spectacularshowing to demonstrate to his father in a practical way his appreciation of thepermission he gave to study engineering. When he returned to his home at the endof the school term with the highest marks that could be awarded in all thesubjects passed, he expected to be joyfully received by his father and praisedfor his good work. Instead, his parent showed only the slightest enthusiasm forhis accomplishment but a great deal of interest in his health, and criticizedNikola for endangering it after his earlier narrow escape from death. Unknown toTesla until several years afterward, the professor at the Polytechnic Institutehad written to his father early in the term, asking him to take his son out ofthe school, as he was in danger of killing himself through overwork.On his return to the Institute for the second year he decided to limit hisstudies to physics, mechanics and mathematics. This was fortunate because itgave him more time in which to handle a situation that arose later in hisstudies, and was to lead to his first and perhaps greatest invention.Early in his second year at the Institute there was received from Paris a pieceof electrical equipment, a Gramme machine, that could be used as either a dynamoor motor. If turned by mechanical power it would generate electricity, and ifsupplied with electricity it would operate as a motor and produce mechanicalpower. It was a direct-current machine.When Prof. Poeschl demonstrated the machine, Tesla was greatly impressed by itsperformance except in one respect—a great deal of sparking took place at thecommutator. Tesla stated his objections to this defect.“It is inherent in the nature of the machine,” replied Prof. Poeschl. “It may bereduced to a great extent, but as long as we use commutators it will always bepresent to some degree. As long as electricity flows in one direction, and aslong as a magnet has two poles each of which acts oppositely on the current, wewill have to use a commutator to change, at the right moment, the direction ofthe current in the rotating armature.”“That is obvious,” Tesla countered. “The machine is limited by the current used.I am suggesting that we get rid of the commutator entirely by using alternatingcurrent.”Long before the machine was received, Tesla had studied the theory of the dynamoand motor, and he was convinced that the whole system could be simplified insome way. The solution of the problem, however, evaded his grasp, nor was he atall sure the problem could be solved—until Prof. Poeschl gave his demonstration.The assurance then came to him like a commanding flash.The first sources of current were batteries which produced a small steady flow.When man sought to produce electricity from mechanical power, he sought to makethe same kind the batteries produced: a steady flow in one direction. The kindof current a dynamo would produce when coils of wire were whirled in a magneticfield was not this kind of current—it flowed first in one direction and then inthe other. The commutator was invented as a clever device for circumventing thisseeming handicap of artificial electricity and making the current come out in aone-directional flow.The flash that came to Tesla was to let the current come out of the dynamo withits alternating directions of flow, thus eliminating the commutator, and feedthis kind of current to the motors, thus eliminating the need in them forcommutators. Many another scientist had played with that idea long before itoccurred to Tesla, but in his case it came to him as such a vivid, illuminatingflash of understanding that he knew his visualization contained the correct andpractical answer. He saw both the motors and dynamos operating withoutcommutators, and doing so very efficiently. He did not, however, see theextremely important and essential details of how this desirable result could beaccomplished, but he felt an overpowering assurance that he could solve theproblem. It was for this reason that he stated his objections to the Grammemachine with a great deal of confidence to his professor. What he did not expectwas to draw a storm of criticism.Prof. Poeschl, however, deviated from his set program of lectures and devotedthe next one to Tesla’s objections. With methodical thoroughness he pickedTesla’s proposal apart and, disposing of one point after another, demonstratedits impractical nature so convincingly that he silenced even Tesla. He ended hislecture with the statement: “Mr. Tesla will accomplish great things, but hecertainly never will do this. It would be equivalent to converting a steadypulling force like gravity into rotary effort. It is a perpetual motion scheme,an impossible idea.”Tesla, although silenced temporarily, was not convinced. The professor had paidhim a nice compliment in devoting a whole lecture to his observation, but, as isso often the case, the compliment was loaded with what was expected by theprofessor to be a crushing defeat for the one whom he complimented. Tesla wasnevertheless greatly impressed by his authority; and for a while he weakened inhis belief that he had correctly understood his vision. It was as clear-cut anddefinite as the visualizations that came to him of the solutions of mathematicalproblems which he was always able to prove correct. But perhaps, after all, hewas in this case a victim of a self-induced hallucination. All other thingsProf. Poeschl taught were solidly founded on demonstrable fact, so perhaps histeacher was right in his objections to the alternating-current idea.Deep down in his innermost being, however, Tesla held firmly to the convictionthat his idea was a correct one. Criticism only temporarily submerged it, andsoon it came bobbing back to the surface of his thinking. He gradually convincedhimself that, contrary to his usual procedure, Prof. Poeschl had in this casedemonstrated merely that he did not know how to accomplish a given result, adeficiency which he shared with everyone else in the world, and therefore couldnot speak with authority on this subject. And, in addition, Tesla reasoned, theclosing remark with which Prof. Poeschl believed he had clinched hisargument—“It would be equivalent to converting a steady pulling force likegravity into a rotary effort”—was contradicted by Nature, for was not the steadypulling force of gravity making the moon revolve around the earth and the earthrevolve around the sun?“I could not demonstrate my belief at that time,” said Tesla, “but it came to methrough what I might call instinct, for lack of a better name. But instinct issomething which transcends knowledge. We undoubtedly have in our brains somefiner fibers which enable us to perceive truths which we could not attainthrough logical deductions, and which it would be futile to attempt to achievethrough any wilful effort of thinking.”His enthusiasm and confidence in himself restored, Tesla tackled the problemwith renewed vigor. His power of visualization—the ability to see as solidobjects before him the things that he conceived in his mind, and which he hadconsidered such a great annoyance in childhood—now proved to be of great aid tohim in trying to unravel this problem. He made an elastic rebound from theintellectual trouncing administered by his professor and was tackling theproblem in methodical fashion.In his mind he constructed one machine after another, and as he visioned thembefore him he could trace out with his finger the various circuits througharmature and field coils, and follow the course of the rapidly changingcurrents. But in no case did he produce the desired rotation. Practically allthe remainder of the term he spent on this problem. He had passed so manyexaminations during the first term that he had plenty of time to spend on thisproblem during the second.It seemed, however, that he was doomed to fail in this project, for at theterm’s end he was no nearer the solution than he was when he started. His pridehad been injured and he was fighting on the defensive side. He did not know thatthose seeming failures in his mental and laboratory experiments were to servelater as the raw material out of which yet another vision was to be created.A radical change had taken place in Tesla’s mode of life while at Gratz. Thefirst year he had acted like an intellectual glutton, overloading his mind andnearly wrecking his health in the process. In the second year he allowed moretime for digesting the mental food of which he was partaking, and permittedhimself more recreation. About this time Tesla took to card-playing as a meansof relaxation. His keen mental processes and highly developed powers ofdeduction enabled him to win more frequently than he lost. He never retained themoney he won but returned it to the losers at the end of the game. When he lost,however, this procedure was not reciprocated by the other players. He alsodeveloped a passion for billiards and chess, in both of which he becameremarkably proficient.The fondness for card-playing which Tesla developed at Gratz got him into anembarrassing situation. Toward the end of the term his father sent him money topay for his trip to Prague and for the expenses incident to enrolling as astudent at the university. Instead of going directly to Prague, Tesla returnedto Gospic for a visit to the family. Sitting in at a card game with some youthsof the city, Tesla found his usual luck had deserted him, and he lost the moneyset aside for his university expenses. He confessed to his mother what he haddone. She did not criticize him. Perhaps the fates were using this method forprotecting him from overwork that might ruin his health, she reasoned, since heneeded rest and relaxation. Losses of money were much easier to handle than lossof health. Borrowing some money from a friend, she gave it to Tesla with thewords, “Here you are. Satisfy yourself.” Returning to the game, he experienced achange in luck and came out of it not only with the money his mother had givenhim but practically all of the university-expense money he had previously lost.These winnings he did not return to the losers as was his previous custom. Hereturned home, gave his mother the money she had advanced him, and announcedthat he would never again indulge in card-playing.INSTEAD of going to the University of Prague in the fall of 1878 as he hadplanned, Tesla accepted a lucrative position that was offered him in a technicalestablishment at Maribor, near Gratz. He was paid sixty florins a month and aseparate bonus for the completed work, a very generous compensation comparedwith the prevailing wages. During this year Tesla lived very modestly and savedhis earnings.The money he had saved at Maribor enabled him to pay his way through a year atthe University of Prague, where he extended his studies in mathematics andphysics. He continued experimenting with the one big challengingalternating-current idea that was occupying his mind. He had explored,unsuccessfully, a large number of methods and, though his failures gave supportto Prof. Poeschl’s contention that he would never succeed, he was unwilling togive up his theory. He still had faith that he would find the solution of hisproblem. He knew electrical science was young and growing, and felt deep withinhis consciousness that he would make the important discovery that would greatlyexpand the infant science to the powerful giant of the future.It would have been a pleasure to Tesla to have continued his studies, but it nowwas necessary for him to make his own living. His father’s death, followingTesla’s graduation from the University at Prague, made it necessary for him tobe self-supporting. Now he needed a job. Europe was extending an enthusiasticreception to Alexander Graham Bell’s new American invention, the telephone, andTesla heard that a central station was to be installed in Budapest. The head ofthe enterprise was a friend of the family. The situation seemed a promising one.Without waiting to ascertain the situation in Budapest, Tesla, full of youthfulhope and the self-assurance which is typical of the untried graduate, traveledto that city, expecting to walk into an engineering position in the newtelephone project. He quickly discovered, on his arrival, that there was noposition open; nor could one be created for him, as the project was still in thediscussion stage.It was, however, urgently necessary, for financial reasons, that he secureimmediately a job of some kind. The best he could obtain was a much more modestone than he had anticipated. The salary was so microscopically small he wouldnever name the amount, but it was sufficient to enable him to avoid starvation.He was employed as draftsman by the Hungarian Government in its CentralTelegraph Office, which included the newly developing telephone in itsjurisdiction.It was not long before Tesla’s outstanding ability attracted the attention ofthe Inspector in Chief. Soon he was transferred to a more responsible positionin which he was engaged in designing and in making calculations and estimates inconnection with new telephone installations. When the new telephone exchange wasfinally started in Budapest in 1881, he was placed in charge of it.Tesla was very happy in his new position. At the age of twenty-five he was infull charge of an engineering enterprise. His inventive faculty was fullyoccupied and he made many improvements in telephone central-station apparatus.Here he made his first invention, then called a telephone repeater, oramplifier, but which today would be more descriptively called a loud speaker—anancestor of the sound producer now so common in the home radio set. Thisinvention was never patented and was never publicly described, but, Tesla laterdeclared, in its originality, design, performance and ingenuity it would make acreditable showing alongside his better-known creations that followed. His chiefinterest, however, was still the alternating-current motor problem whosesolution continued to elude him.Always an indefatigable worker, always using up his available energy with thegreatest number of activities he could crowd into a day, always rebellingbecause the days had too few hours in them and the hours too few minutes, andthe seconds that composed them were of too short duration, and always holdinghimself down to a five-hour period of rest with only two hours of that devotedto sleep, he continually used up his vital reserves and eventually had tobalance accounts with Nature. He was forced finally to discontinue work.The peculiar malady that now affected him was never diagnosed by the doctors whoattended him. It was, however, an experience that nearly cost him his life. Todoctors he appeared to be at death’s door. The strange manifestations heexhibited attracted the attention of a renowned physician, who declared medicalscience could do nothing to aid him. One of the symptoms of the illness was anacute sensitivity of all of the senseorgans. His senses had always beenextremely keen, but this sensitivity was now so tremendously exaggerated thatthe effects were a form of torture. The ticking of a watch three rooms awaysounded like the beat of hammers on an anvil. The vibration of ordinary citytraffic, when transmitted through a chair or bench, pounded through his body. Itwas necessary to place the legs of his bed on rubber pads to eliminate thevibrations. Ordinary speech sounded like thunderous pandemonium. The slightesttouch had the mental effect of a tremendous blow. A beam of sunlight shining onhim produced the effect of an internal explosion. In the dark he could sense anobject at a distance of a dozen feet by a peculiar creepy sensation in hisforehead. His whole body was constantly wracked by twitches and tremors. Hispulse, he said, would vary from a few feeble throbs per minute to more than onehundred and fifty.Throughout this mysterious illness he was fighting with powerful desire torecover his normal condition. He had before him a task he must accomplish—hemust attain the solution of the alternating-current motor problem. He feltintuitively during his months of torment that the solution was coming evernearer, and that he must live in order to be there when it crystallized out ofhis unconscious mind. During this period he was unable to concentrate on this orany other subject.Once the crisis was past and the symptoms diminished, improvement came rapidlyand with it the old urge to tackle problems. He could not give up his bigproblem. It had become a part of him. Working on it was no longer a matter ofchoice. He knew that if he stopped he would die, and he knew equally well thatif he failed he would perish. He was enmeshed in an invisible web of intangiblestructure that was tightening around him. The feeling that it was bringing thesolution nearer to him—just beyond his finger tips—was cause for both regret andrejoicing. That problem when solved would leave a tremendous vacancy in hislife, he feared.Yet in spite of his feeling of optimism it was still a tremendous problemwithout a solution.When the acute sensitivity reduced to normal, permitting him to resume work, helook a walk in the city park of Budapest with a former classmate, named Szigeti,one late afternoon in February, 1882. While a glorious sunset overspread the skywith a flamboyant splash of throbbing colors, Tesla engaged in one of hisfavorite hobbies—reciting poetry. As a youth he had memorized many volumes, andhe was now pleased to note that the terrific punishment his brain hadexperienced had not diminished his memory. One of the works which he couldrecite from beginning to end was Goethe’s Faust.The prismatic panorama which the sinking sun was painting in the sky remindedhim of some of Goethe’s beautiful lines: > > The glow retreats, done is the day of toil;> > > It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;> > > Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil,> > > Upon its track to follow, follow soaring….Tesla, tall, lean and gaunt, but with a fire in his eye that matched the flamingclouds of the heavens, waved his arms in the air and swayed his body as hevoiced the undulating lines. He faced the color drama of the sky as ifaddressing the red-glowing orb as it flung its amorphous masses of hue, tint andchrome across the domed vault of heaven.Suddenly the animated figure of Tesla snapped into a rigid pose as if he hadfallen into a trance. Szigeti spoke to him but got no answer. Again his wordswere ignored. The friend was about to seize the towering motionless figure andshake him into consciousness when instead Tesla spoke.“Watch me!” said Tesla, blurting out the words like a child bubbling over withemotion: “Watch me reverse it.” He was still gazing into the sun as if thatincandescent ball had thrown him into a hypnotic trance.Szigeti recalled the image from Goethe that Tesla had been reciting: “The glowretreats… It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring,” a poetic descriptionof the setting sun, and then his next words—“Watch me! Watch me reverse it.” DidTesla mean the sun? Did he mean that he could arrest the motion of the sun aboutto sink below the horizon, reverse its action and start it rising again towardthe zenith?“Let us sit and rest for a while,” said Szigeti. He turned him toward a bench,but Tesla was not to be moved.“Don’t you see it?” expostulated the excited Tesla. “See how smoothly it isrunning? Now I throw this switch—and I reverse it. See! It goes just as smoothlyin the opposite direction. Watch! I stop it. I start it. There is no sparking.There is nothing on it to spark.”“But I see nothing,” said Szigeti. “The sun is not sparking. Are you ill?”“You do not understand,” beamed the still excited Tesla, turning as if to bestowa benediction on his companion. “It is my alternating-current motor I am talkingabout. I have solved the problem. Can’t you see it right here in front of me,running almost silently? It is the rotating magnetic field that does it. See howthe magnetic field rotates and drags the armature around with it? Isn’t itbeautiful? Isn’t it sublime? Isn’t it simple? I have solved the problem. Now Ican die happy. But I must live, I must return to work and build the motor so Ican give it to the world. No more will men be slaves to hard tasks. My motorwill set them free, it will do the work of the world.”Szigeti now understood. Tesla had previously told him about his attempt to solvethe problem of an alternating-current motor, and he grasped the full meaning ofthe scientist’s words. Tesla had never told him, however, about his ability tovisualize objects which he conceived in his mind, so it was necessary to explainthe vision he saw, and that the solution had come to him suddenly while theywere admiring the sunset.Tesla was now a little more composed, but he was floating on air in a frenzy ofalmost religious ecstasy. He had been breathing deeply in his excitement, andthe overventilation of his lungs had produced a state of exhilaration.Picking up a twig, he used it as a scribe to draw a diagram on the dusty surfaceof the dirt walk. As he explained the technical principles of his discovery, hisfriend quickly grasped the beauty of his conception, and far into the night theyremained together discussing its possibilities.The conception of a rotating magnetic field was a majestically beautiful one. Itintroduced to the scientific world a new principle of sublime grandeur whosesimplicity and utility opened a vast new empire of useful applications. In itTesla had achieved the solution which his professor had declared was impossibleof attainment.Alternating-current motors had heretofore presented what seemed an insolubleproblem because the magnetic field produced by alternating currents changed asrapidly as the current. Instead of producing a turning force they churned upuseless vibration.Up to this time everyone who tried to make an alternating-current motor used asingle circuit, just as was in direct current. As a result the projected motorproved to be like a single-cylinder steam engine, stalled at dead center, at thetop or bottom of the stroke.What Tesla did was to use two circuits, each one carrying the same frequency ofalternating current, but in which the current waves were out of step with eachother. This was equivalent to adding to an engine a second cylinder. The pistonsin the two cylinders were connected to the shaft so that their cranks were at inangle to each other which caused them to reach the top or bottom of the strokeat different times. The two could never be on dead center at the same time. Ifone were on dead center, the other would be off and ready to start the engineturning with a power stroke.This analogy oversimplifies the situation, of course, for Tesla’s discovery wasmuch more far-reaching and fundamental. What Tesla had discovered was a means ofcreating a rotating magnetic eld, a magnetic whirlwind in space which possessedfantastically new and intriguing properties. It was an utterly new conception.In direct-current motors a fixed magnetic field was tricked by mechanical meansinto producing rotation in an armature by connecting successively through acommutator each of a series of coils arranged around the circumference of acylindrical armature. Tesla produced a field of force which rotated in space athigh speed and was able to lock tightly into its embrace an armature whichrequired no electrical connections. The rotating field possessed the property oftransferring wirelessly through space, by means of its lines of force, energy tothe simple closed circuit coils on the isolated armature which enabled it tobuild up its own magnetic field that locked itself into the rotating magneticwhirlwind produced by the field coils. The need for a commutator was completelyeliminated.Now that this magnificent solution of his most difficult scientific problem wasachieved, Tesla’s troubles were not over; they were just beginning; but, duringthe next two months, he was in a state of ecstatic pleasure playing with his newtoy. It was not necessary for him to construct models of copper and iron: in hismental workshop he constructed them in wide variety. A constant stream of newideas was continuously rushing through his mind. They came so fast, he said,that he could neither utilize nor record them all. In this short period heevolved every type of motor which was later associated with his name.He worked out the design of dynamos, motors, transformers and all other devicesfor a complete alternating-current system. He multiplied the effectiveness ofthe two-phase system by making it operate on three or more alternating currentssimultaneously. This was his famous polyphase power system.The mental constructs were built with meticulous care as concerned size,strength, design and material; and they were tested mentally, he maintained, byhaving them run for weeks—after which time he would examine them thoroughly forsigns of wear. Here was a most unusual mind being utilized in a most unusualway. If he at any time built a “mental machine,” his memory ever afterwardretained all of the details, even to the finest dimensions.THE state of supreme happiness which Tesla was enjoying was destined soon,however, to end. The telephone central station by which he was employed, andwhich was controlled by Puskas, that friend of the family, was sold. When Puskasreturned to Paris, he recommended Tesla for a job in the Paris establishmentwith which he was associated, and Tesla gladly followed up his opportunity.Paris, he reasoned, would be a wonderful springboard from which to catapult hisgreat invention on the world.The budding superman Tesla came to Paris light in baggage but with his headfilled to bursting with his wonderful discovery of the rotating magnetic fieldand scores of significant inventions based on it. If he had been a typicalinventor, he would have gone among people wearing a look indicating that he knewsomething important, but maintaining absolute secrecy concerning the nature ofhis inventions. He would be fearful that someone would steal his secret. ButTesla’s attitude was just the reverse of this. He had something to give to theworld and he wanted the world to know about it, the whole fascinating story withall the revealing technical details. He had not then learned, and never didlearn, the craft of being shrewd and cunning. His life plan was on a secularbasis. He cared less for the advantages of the passing moment, more for theultimate goal; and he wanted to give his newly discovered polyphase system ofalternating current to the human race that all men could benefit from it. Heknew there was a fortune in his invention. How he could extract this fortune hedid not know. He knew that there was a higher law of compensation under which hewould derive adequate benefits from the gift to the world of his discovery. Themethod by which this would work out did not interest him nearly so much as thenecessity for getting someone to listen to the details of his fascinatinginvention.Six feet two inches tall, slender, quiet of demeanor, meticulously neat indress, full of self-confidence, he carried himself with an air that shouted, “Idefy you to show me an electrical problem I can’t solve”—an attitude that wasconsistent with his twenty-five years, but also matched by his ability.Through Puskas’s letter of recommendation he obtained a position with theContinental Edison Company, a French company organized to make dynamos, motorsand install lighting systems under the Edison patents.He obtained quarters on the Boulevard St. Michel, but in the evenings visitedand dined at the best cafés as long as his salary lasted. He made contact withmany Americans engaged in electrical enterprises. Wherever he could get apatient ear, among those who had an understanding of electrical matters, hedescribed his alternating-current system of dynamos and motors.Did someone steal his invention? Not the slightest danger. He could not evengive it away. No one was even slightly interested. The closest approach to anibble was when Dr. Cunningham, an American, a foreman in the plant where Teslawas employed, suggested formation of a stock company.With his great alternating-current-system invention pounding at his brain anddemanding some way in which it could be developed, it was a hardship for him tobe forced to work all day on direct-current machines. Nowadays, though, hishealth was robust. He would arise shortly after five o’clock in the morning,walk to the Seine, swim for half an hour, and then walk to Ivry, near the gatesof Paris, where he was employed, a trip that required an hour of livelystepping. It was then half-past seven. The next hour he spent in eating a verysubstantial breakfast which never seemed sufficient to keep his appetite fromdeveloping into a disturbing factor long before noon.The work to which he was assigned at the Continental Edison Company factory wasof a variegated character, largely that of a junior engineer. In a short time hewas given a traveling assignment as a “trouble shooter” which required him tovisit electrical installations in various parts of France and Germany. Tesla didnot relish “trouble shooting” but he did a conscientious job and studiedintensely the difficulties he encountered at each powerhouse. He was soon ableto present a definite plan for improving the dynamos manufactured by hiscompany. He presented his suggestions and received permission to apply them tosome machines. When tested they were a complete success. He was then asked todesign automatic regulators, for which there was a great need. These too gave anexcellent performance.The company had been placed in an embarrassing position and was threatened withheavy loss through an accident at the railroad station in Strassburg in Alsace,then in Germany, where a powerhouse and electric lights had been installed. Atthe opening ceremony, at which Emperor William I was present, a short circuit inthe wiring caused an explosion that blew out one of the walls. The Germangovernment refused to accept the installation. Tesla was sent, early in 1883, toput the plant in working order and straighten out the situation. The technicalproblem presented no difficulties but he found it necessary to use a great dealof tact and good judgment in handling the mass of red tape extruded by theGerman government as precaution against further mishaps.Once he got the job well under way he gave some time to constructing an actualtwo-phase alternating-current motor embodying his rotary-magnetic-fielddiscovery. He had constructed so many in his mind since thatnever-to-be-forgotten day in Budapest when he made his great invention. He hadbrought materials with him from Paris for this purpose and found a machine shopnear the Strassburg station where he could do some of the work. He did not haveas much time available as he had expected, and, while he was a clever amateurmachinist, nevertheless the work took time. He was very fussy, making everypiece of metal exact in dimensions to better than the thousandth of an inch andthen carefully polishing it.Eventually there was a miscellaneous collection of parts in that Strassburgmachine shop. They had been constructed without the aid of working drawings.Tesla could project before his eyes a picture, complete in every detail, ofevery part of the machine. These pictures were more vivid than any blueprint andhe remembered exact dimensions which he had calculated mentally for each item.He did not have to test parts through partial assembly. He knew they would fit.From these parts Tesla quickly assembled a dynamo, to generate the two-phasealternating current which he needed to operate his alternating-current motor,and finally his new induction motor. There was no difference between the motorhe built and the one which he visualized. So real was the visualized one that ithad all the appearance of solidity. The one he built in the machine shoppresented no elements of novelty to him. It was exactly as he had visualized ita year before. He had mentally experimented with its exact counterpart and withmany variations of it during the months that had passed since the great visioncame to him while rhapsodizing the sunset sky in Budapest.The assembly completed, he started up his power generator. The time for thegreat final test of the validity of his theory had arrived. He would close aswitch and if the motor turned his theory would be proven correct. If nothinghappened, if the armature of his motor just stood still, but vibrated, histheory was not correct and he had been feeding his mind on hallucinations, basedon fantasy not on fact.He closed the switch. Instantly the armature turned, built up to full speed in aflash and then continued to operate in almost complete silence. He closed thereversing switch and the armature instantly stopped and as quickly startedturning in the opposite direction. This was complete vindication of his theory.In this experiment he had tested only his two-phase system; but he needed nolaboratory demonstration to convince him that his three-phase systems forgenerating electricity and for using this current for transmission and powerproduction would work even better, and that hit single-phase system would workalmost as well. With this working model he would now be able to convey to theminds of others the visions he had been treasuring for so long.This test meant much more to Tesla than just the successful completion of aninvention; it meant a triumph for his method of discovering new truths throughthe unique mental processes he used of visualizing constructs long before theywere produced from materials. From these results he drew an unbounded sense ofself-confidence; he could think and work his way to any goal he set.There was good reason for Tesla’s self-assurance. He had just passed histwenty-seventh birthday. It seemed to him only yesterday that Prof. Poeschl hadseemingly so completely vanquished him for saying that he could operate a motorby alternating current. Now he had demonstrably accomplished what the learnedprofessor said could never be done.TESLA now had available a completely novel type of electrical system utilizingalternating current, which was much more flexible and vastly more efficient thanthe direct-current system. But now that he had it, what could he do with it? Theexecutives of the Continental Edison Company by whom he was employed hadcontinually refused to listen to his alternating-current theories. He felt itwould be useless to try to interest them in even the working model. He had mademany friends during his stay in Strassburg, among them the Mayor of the city, M.Bauzin, who shared his enthusiasm about the commercial possibilities of the newsystem and hoped it would result in the establishment of a new industry thatwould bring fame and prosperity to his city.The Mayor brought together a number of wealthy Strass-burgers. To them the newmotor was shown in operation, and the new system and its possibilitiesdescribed, by both Tesla and the Mayor. The demonstration was a success from thetechnical viewpoint but otherwise a total loss. Not one member of the groupshowed the slightest interest. Tesla was dejected. It was beyond hiscomprehension that the greatest invention in electrical science, with unlimitedcommercial possibilities, should be rejected so completely.M. Bauzin assured him that he would undoubtedly receive a more satisfactoryreception for his invention in Paris. Delays of officialdom in finally acceptingthe completed installation at the Strassburg station, however, postponed hisreturn to Paris until the spring of 1884. Meanwhile, Tesla looked forward withpleasurable expectancy to a triumphant return to Paris. He had been promised asubstantial compensation if he was successful in handling the Strassburgassignment; also, that he would be similarly compensated for the improvements indesign of motors and dynamos, and for the automatic regulators for dynamos. Itwas possible that this would supply him with enough cash to build a full-sizedemonstration set for his polyphase alternating-current system, so that thetremendous advantages of his system over direct current could be shown inoperation. Then he would have no trouble raising the needed capital.When he got back to the company’s offices in Paris and asked for a settlement ofhis Strassburg and automatic-regulator accounts, he was given what in modernterminology is called the “runaround.” To use fictitious names, as Tesla toldthe story, the executive, Mr. Smith, who gave him the assignments, now told himhe had no jurisdiction over financial arrangements; that was all in the hands ofthe executive, Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown explained that he administered financialmatters but had no authority to initiate projects or to make payments other thanthose directed by the chief executive, Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones explained that suchmatters were in the hands of his department executives, and that he neverinterfered with their decisions, so Tesla must see the executive in charge oftechnical matters, Mr. Smith. Tesla traveled this vicious circle several timeswith the same result and finally gave up in disgust. He decided not to renew hisoffer of the alternating-current system nor to show his motor in operation, andresigned his position immediately.Tesla was undoubtedly entitled to an amount in excess of $25,000 for theregulators he designed and for his services in Strassburg. Had the executivesbeen endowed with even a smattering of horse sense, or the ordinary gardenvariety of honesty, they would have made an attempt to settle for $5,000, at theleast. Tesla, hard pressed for cash, would undoubtedly have accepted such anamount, although with a feeling that he was being cheated in a large way.Such an offer would probably have held Tesla on the payroll of the company andpreserved for it the possession of the world’s greatest inventor and one who atthe time had definitely demonstrated he was an extremely valuable employee.For a paltry few thousand dollars they lost not only a man who would have savedthem many times that amount every year, but they also lost an opportunity toobtain world control of the greatest and most profitable electrical inventionever made.One of the administrators of the company, Mr. Charles Batchellor, Manager of theWorks, who was a former assistant and close personal friend of Thomas A. Edison,urged Tesla to go to the United States and work with Edison. There he would havea chance to work on improvements to the Edison dynamos and motors. Tesla decidedto follow Mr. Batchellor’s suggestion. He sold his books and all other personalpossessions except a few articles which he expected to take with him. Heassembled his very limited financial resources, purchased tickets for hisrailroad trip and transatlantic journey to New York. His baggage consisted of asmall bundle of clothes carried under his arm and some other items stuffed intohis pockets.The final hours were busy ones and, as he was about to board the train, just asit was ready to pull out of the station, he discovered his package of baggagewas missing. Reaching quickly for his wallet, which contained his railroad andsteamship tickets and all his money, he was horrified to discover that that toowas missing. There was some loose change in his pocket, how much he did notknow—he did not have time to count it. His train was pulling out. What should hedo? If he missed this train, he would also miss the boat—but he could not rideon either without tickets. He ran alongside the moving train, trying to make uphis mind. His long legs enabled him to keep up with it without difficulty atfirst, but now it was gaining speed. He finally decided to jump aboard. Theloose change he discovered was sufficient to take care of the railroad fare,with a negligible remainder. He explained his situation to the skepticalsteamship officials and, when no one else showed up to claim his reservations onthe ship up to the time of sailing, he was permitted to embark.To one as fastidious as Tesla, a long steamship journey without adequateclothing was a trying experience. He had expected to encounter annoyances whengetting along with the minimum amount of clothing which he planned carrying withhim, but when even that limited layout was lost the annoyance became hardship.Coupled with this was the memory of disappointment and resentment over hisrecent experiences.The ship offered little to interest him. He explored it thoroughly and in doingso made some contacts with members of the ship’s company. There was unrest amongthe crew. There was unrest in Tesla also. He extended sympathy to members of thecrew in their claimed unjust treatment. The grievances affecting the crew hadbuilt up one of those situations in which a small spark can cause a largeexplosion. The spark flew somewhere on the ship while Tesla was below decks inthe crew’s quarters. The captain and officers got tough and, with some loyalmembers of the crew, decided to settle the trouble with belaying pins as clubs.It quickly because a battle royal. Tesla found himself in the middle of a fightin which when anyone saw a head he hit it.Had Tesla not been young as well as tall and strong, his useful career mighthave ended at this point He had long arms in proportion to his six feet twoinches of height. The fist at the end of his arm could reach as far as a club inthe hands of an adversary, and his height enabled him to tower over the otherfighters so his head was not easy to reach. He struck hard and often, neverknowing for or against which side he was fighting. He was on his feet when thefight was over, something which could not be said of a score of the crewmembers. The officers had subdued what they called a mutiny, but they toocarried indications that they had been through a battle. Tesla was definitelynot invited to sit at the captain’s table during the voyage.He spent the remainder of his journey nursing scores of bruises and sitting inmeditation at the stern of the ship, which too slowly made its way to New York.Soon he would set foot on the “land of golden promise” and meet the famous Mr.Edison. He was destined to learn that it was really a “land of goldenpromise”—but also to discover something that would open his eyes about thefulfillment of promises.FOURimage [images/00003.jpg] WHEN Tesla stepped out of the Immigration Office at Castle Garden, Manhattan, inthe summer of 1884, his possessions consisted of four cents, a book of his ownpoems, a couple of technical articles he had written, calculations for designinga flying machine, and some mathematical work done in an effort to solve anextremely difficult integral. He had Mr. Batchellor’s letter introducing him toMr. Edison, and the address of a friend. In this letter to Edison, Batchellorwrote: “I know two great men and you are one of them; the other is this youngman.”Lacking carfare, Tesla had to walk the several miles to his friend’s home. Thefirst person he spoke to, seeking traveling directions, was a policeman, a gruffindividual. The way he supplied the information suggested to Tesla that he waswilling to start a fight on the subject. Although Tesla spoke English very well,all he understood of the policeman’s lingo was the direction in which he pointedhis club.While walking in what he believed was the right direction, wondering how hewould be able to contrive a meal and lodgings out of four cents should he beunable to locate his friend, he passed a shop in which he could see a manworking on an electrical machine that seemed to him familiar. He entered just asthe man was about to give up as impossible the task of repairing the device.“Let me do it,” said Tesla, “I will make it operate.” And without more ado hetackled the job. It proved to be a difficult task but eventually the machine wasworking again.“I need a man like you to handle these blankety-blank foreign machines,” saidthe man. “Do you want a job?”Tesla thanked him and told him he was on his way to another job, whereupon theman handed him twenty dollars. Tesla had expected no compensation for doing whathe considered a slight favor, and said so, but the man insisted his work wasworth that much, and he was glad to pay it. Never was Tesla more thankful for awindfall. He was now assured of food and lodgings for the time being. With theaid of walking directions, this time more graciously given, he located hisfriend and was a guest at his home overnight. The next day he went to Edison’sNew York headquarters, then on South Fifth Avenue (now West Broadway).The introduction by Mr. Batchellor gave him ready access to Mr. Edison, who wasbusily engaged in problems in connection with his new generating station andelectric-light system—the former located in downtown Pearl Street and serving arelatively small radius of territory.Tesla was favorably impressed by Edison on their first meeting. He marveled thata man so limited in education could accomplish so much in so technical a fieldas electricity. It caused Tesla to wonder if all the time he had spent ingaining an education of very broad scope had not been wasted. Would he have beenfurther ahead if he had started his practical work on the basis of experience,as Edison had done? He definitely decided, however, before many days had passed,that the time and effort he had spent on his education constituted the wisestkind of an investment.Edison, for his part, was none too favorably impressed by Tesla. Edison was aninventor who got his results by trial-and-error methods. Tesla calculatedeverything mentally and solved his problems before doing any “work” on them. Asa result, the two great men spoke an entirely different technical language.There was one more very important difference. Edison belonged to thedirect-current and Tesla to the alternating-current school of thought. Theelectricians of that day could, and did, become highly emotional over theirdifferences of opinion on this subject. Discussions roused all the fervor of areligious or political debate, and everything unpleasant was associated with theadherents on the other side of the discussion. The least unpleasant thoughtapplied to an opponent was that he was of a low order of mentality. When Teslaenthusiastically described his polyphase system and told Edison he believedalternating current was the only practical kind of current to use in apower-and-lighting system, Edison laughed. Edison was using direct current inhis system. He told Tesla very bluntly he was not interested in alternatingcurrent; there was no future to it and anyone who dabbled in that field waswasting his time; and besides, it was a deadly current whereas direct currentwas safe. Tesla did not yield any ground in the discussion—nor could he make anyprogress in his effort to get Edison to listen to a presentation of hispolyphase power system. On technical grounds, they were worlds apart.Nevertheless, because of Batchellor’s statement on the valuable work he had doneon the Edison direct-current machines in Europe, Tesla was, without muchformality, given a job on Edison’s staff—doing minor routine work. A few weekslater he had an opportunity to demonstrate his ability. Edison had installed oneof his electric-light plana on the steamship Oregon, the fastest and mostup-to-date passenger ship of that time. The installation worked well for manymonths but finally both dynamos went out of commission. It was impossible toremove the dynamos and install new ones, so it was necessary to repair the oldones in some way—but this, Edison had been told, was impossible without takingthem to the shop. The scheduled sailing date of the ship had passed and Edisonwas being placed in an embarrassing position over the accumulating days of delaycaused by his machines.Edison asked Tesla if he would go to the ship and see what could be done aboutthe situation. This was in the afternoon. Taking such instruments as he thoughthe would need, Tesla went aboard the Oregon. He found that short circuits hadcaused some of the armature coils to be burned out; and open circuits haddeveloped elsewhere on the machines.Calling on members of the crew to assist him, Tesla worked through the night andby 4 A.M. had both machines running as well as they did the day they were newlyinstalled. Walking back to the shop on lower Fifth Avenue at 5 A.M., in the dimearly dawn he met a group of men just leaving. In it were Edison, Batchellor,who had returned from Paris in the meantime, and several others who had finishedtheir night’s work and were returning to their homes.“Here is our Parisian running around nights,” said Edison.“Am just coming back from the Oregon, “ Tesla replied. “Both machines areoperating.”Edison, amazed, shook his head and turned away without another word. Onrejoining the group he said to Batchellor, loud enough for the keen-eared Teslato hear him, “Batchellor, this is a damn good man.”Thereafter Tesla’s status on the staff was raised several levels and he wasgiven closer contact with design and operating problems. He found the workinteresting and applied himself to it more than eighteen hours a day, from 10:30 A.M. until 5 A.M., every day including Sundays. Edison, observing hisindustry, told him, “I have had many hard-working assistants but you take thecake.” Tesla observed many ways in which the dynamos could be improved in designto operate more efficiently. He outlined his plan to Edison, and stressed theincreased output and lower cost of operating that would result from the changeshe suggested. Edison, quick to appreciate the value of increased efficiency,replied, “There’s fifty thousand dollars in it for you if you can do it.”Tesla designed twenty-four types of dynamos, eliminating the long-core fieldmagnets then in use and substituting the more efficient short cores, andprovided some automatic controls, on which patents were taken out. Months later,when the task was finished, and some of the new machines built and tested andfound measuring up to his promises, Tesla asked to be paid the $50,000. Edisonreplied, “Tesla, you don’t understand our American humor.” Tesla was shocked todiscover that what he thought was a specific promise was being tossed asidemerely as a standard practical joke of the day. He received not a penny ofcompensation from the new designs and inventions, or for the tremendous amountof overtime, beyond the none too generous weekly pay. He resigned his jobimmediately. This was in the spring of 1885.In the period of less than a year which he spent with Edison, Tesla haddeveloped a good reputation in electrical circles; so when he was free he wasoffered an opportunity to capitalize on it. A group of promoters offered to forma company under his name. This looked like a possible chance to bring out hisalternating-current system, and he eagerly entered into the project. But when heurged his plan, the promoters informed him they were not interested inalternating current. What they wanted him to develop was a practical arc lightfor street and factory illumination. In about a year he developed the desiredlamp, took out several patents on his invention, and its manufacture and usewere under way.From a technical point of view the venture was a success, but Tesla himselfsuffered another painful financial experience in connection with it. He had beenpaid a comparatively small salary during the period of development. According tothe agreement, he was to receive his principal compensation in the form ofshares of stock in the company. He received a beautifully engraved stockcertificate, and then, by some manipulations he did not understand, he wasforced out of the company and aspersions were cast upon his ability as anengineer and an inventor. When he sought to convert the certificate into cash,he found that the shares of newly organized companies of undemonstrated power toearn dividends possess very slight value. His opinion of financial men in boththe Old World and the New was taking on a decidedly uncomplimentary bias.Now came the most unpleasant experience of Tesla’s life. He was without a sourceof income, and from the spring of 1886 to the spring of 1887 he was forced towork as a day laborer. “I lived,” he said, “through a year of terribleheartaches and bitter tears, my suffering being intensified by material want.”Business conditions were none too good in the country. Not only did he havedifficulty in getting anyone to listen to his alternating-current project, buteven in his effort to earn room and board as a laborer he had tremendouscompetition, and found it none too easy to secure the most menial tasks atalmost starvation wages. He would never discuss this period of his life,probably because it was so unpleasant that he banished all thoughts of it fromhis memory. Some electrial repair work and even ditch digging at $2 a day wereamong the jobs he tackled. He resented the utter waste of his abilities morethan the personal degradation involved. His education, he said, seemed amockery.During the winter of early 1887, while engaged in ditch digging, he attractedthe attention of the foreman of the gang who, too, was being forced bycircumstances to work below his accustomed level. The foreman was impressed byTesla’s story of his inventions and his great hopes for his alternating-currentsystem. Through this foreman, Tesla said, he was introduced to Mr. A. K. Brownof the Western Union Telegraph Company who put up some of his own money andinterested a friend in joining him in Tesla’s project.These two gentlemen organized and financed the Tesla Electric Company, and inApril, 1887, established a laboratory at 33-35 South Fifth Avenue (now WestBroadway), near Bleecker Street, not far from the shop of the Edison Company.Edison had turned down Tesla’s alternating-current idea—and now Tesla was hisneighbor with a laboratory of his own, starting to develop the competing idea.Within this small area was to be fought the great battle of the electricalindustry over the question of whether direct or alternating current should beused. Edison, already famous, was wholeheartedly committed to direct current;his powerhouses were operating in several cities and, in addition, he had thesupport of the famous financier, J. P. Morgan. Tesla, on the other hand, wasunknown and had only very modest financial support. The direct current wastechnically simple, whereas alternating current was technically complex. Teslaknew, however, that in these complexities were unlimited possibilities forusefulness.TESLA’S dark days were over. Yet he was soon to discover that the acceptance orrejection of the alternating-current system was not based on technical facts butupon financial considerations, emotional reactions and prejudices, and thathuman nature was a bigger factor than scientific truths. Nevertheless, in ashort time, he would see some of his greatest hopes and dreams realized, andsuccess in large measure reward his efforts.Once he had achieved something resembling fair conditions under which to carryon his work, the rising star of Tesla’s genius shot across the electricalheavens like a meteor. As soon as the newly organized Tesla Electric Companyopened its South Fifth Avenue laboratories he started the construction of avariety of pieces of dynamo electric machinery. It was not necessary for him todo any calculating, or work out blueprints. Everything was crystal clear in hismind down to the finest detail of each piece of apparatus. As a result he veryquickly produced the working units with which he demonstrated the principles ofhis polyphase alternating-current system. The single piece of apparatus he hadbuilt while in Strassburg, the first model of the induction motor, supplied thephysical proof he needed that all the remainder of his calculations werecorrect.The apparatuses built in his new laboratory were identical with those which heconceived during the two months in Budapest following the remarkable revelationof the principle of the revolving magnetic field. He did not make the slightestchange, he said, in the machines he had mentally constructed at that time. Whenthe machines were physically constructed not one of them failed to operate as hehad anticipated. Five years had elapsed since he evolved the designs. In themeantime he had not committed a line to paper—yet he had remembered perfectlyevery last detail.Tesla produced as rapidly as the machines could be constructed three completesystems of alternating-current machinery—for single-phase, two-phase andthree-phase currents—and made experiments with four-and six-phase currents. Ineach of the three principal systems he produced the dynamos for generating thecurrents, the motors for producing power from them and transformers for raisingand reducing the voltages, as well as a variety of devices for automaticallycontrolling the machinery. He not only produced the three systems but providedmethods by which they could be interconnected, and modifications providing avariety of means of using each of the systems. A few months after opening thelaboratory he submitted his two-phase motor to Prof. W. A. Anthony, of CornellUniversity, for testing. Prof. Anthony reported that it had an efficiency equalto that of the best direct-current motors.Tesla now not only constructed the machines which he visualized but he workedout the basic mathematical theory underlying all of the apparatus. Themathematical theory was so basic that it covered not only the principlesapplying to machinery for operation at 60 cycles per second, which is thefrequency now in standard use, but applied equally well to the whole range oflow-and high-frequency currents. With Edison direct current, it had not beenfound practicable to work with potentials higher than 220 volts on distributionsystems; but with alternating current it was possible to produce and transmitcurrents of many thousands of volts, thus permitting economical distribution,and these could be reduced to the lower voltages for customer use.Tesla sought to obtain a single patent covering the entire system and all of itsconstituent dynamos, transformers, distribution systems and motors. His patentattorneys, Duncan, Curtis & Page, filed the application for this patent October12, 1887, six months after the laboratory opened and five and a half years afterTesla had made his rotary magnetic-field invention.The Patent Office, however, objected to considering such an “omnibus”application and insisted it be broken down to seven separate inventions, withindividual applications filed on each. Two groups of separate applications werefiled, on November 30 and December 23 respectively. These inventions were sooriginal and covered such a virgin field of electrical science that theyencountered practically no difficulties in the Patent Office and within aboutsix months the patents were issued.*As a succession of fundamental patents started to issue from the Patent Officeto Tesla, the attention of the electrical engineering profession was drawn tothis practically unknown inventor. The significance of his epoch-makingdiscoveries was quickly grasped and he was invited to deliver a lecture beforethe American Institute of Electrical Engineers on May 16, 1888. This invitationwas evidence that he had “arrived.” Tesla accepted the invitation and put hiswhole heart into preparing the lecture which, he felt, would enable him to tellthe electrical world the magnificent story of his complete alternating-currentsystem and the tremendous advantages it possessed over direct current.This lecture became a classic of the electrical engineering field. In it Teslapresented the theory and practical application of alternating current to powerengineering. This, with his patents, described the foundation, in the matter ofcircuits, machines and operation, and theory, upon which almost the entireelectrical system of the country was established and is still operating today.No new development of anything even slightly approaching comparable magnitudehas been made in the field of electrical engineering down to the present time.Tesla’s lecture, and the inventions and discoveries which he included in it,established him before the electrical engineering profession as the father ofthe whole field of alternating-current power system, and the outstandinginventor in the electrical field.IT IS not easy to visualize the tremendous burst of electrical development andprogress that came out of Tesla’s laboratory in the few months after heestablished it. He produced a tidal wave of advancement which carried theelectrical world into the opening of the new power age in one grandsurge—although it took several years, naturally, for the commercial exploitationto get under way. The world of electrical engineering was amazed, bewildered andmystified by the host of discoveries thrown into its midst in rapid successionfrom the Tesla laboratory, and was filled with admiration for the prodigious newgenius who had flared up within its ranks.Tesla’s power system, employing high voltage for transmission, releasedelectrical powerhouses using direct current from functioning as purely localenterprises, capable of serving an area within a radius of one mile at the verymost. His motors used alternating current that could be economically transmittedhundreds of miles, and he provided an economical two-and three-phase system fortransmission lines.The stupendous changes which the Tesla alternating-current inventions anddiscoveries brought about in the electrical industry can be realized byconsidering the handicap under which the direct-current powerhouses of theEdison system had operated up to that time. Electricity was generated inpowerhouses by relatively small-size dynamos, and the current then distributedto customers over copper conductors laid in conduits under the streets. Some ofthe electrical energy fed into these conductors at the powerhouse did not arriveas electricity at the far end of the line but was converted along the route touseless heat by the resistance of the conductors.Electrical energy is composed of two factors, the current, or amount ofelectricity, and the voltage, or the pressure under which the current is moved.Resistance losses were undergone by the current regardless of the voltage. Oneampere of current experienced a definite loss caused by resistance and this losswas the same whether the pressure was 100, or 1,000 or 100,000 volts. If thecurrent value remained fixed, then the amount of energy transported over a wirevaried with the voltage. There is, for example, 100,000 times as much energytransported over a wire carrying a current of one ampere at 100,000 volts asthere is when the current is one ampere and the pressure is one volt.If the amount of current carried by a wire is doubled, the heat losses areincreased four fold; if the current is tripled, these losses are increased ninefold, and if the current is increased four fold, the losses rise sixteen fold.This situation put definite limits to the amount of current which could beloaded on to conductors.In addition there is an accompanying drop in pressure. In a half-mile-longconductor, of the size adopted and under the average currents carried, therewould be a drop of about 30 volts. To compensate for this, to some extent, thedynamos were designed to generate 120 volts instead of the standard 110 voltsfor which lamps were designed. Near the powerhouse the customers would getexcess voltage—and a half-mile away their current would be delivered at 90volts. The early Edison carbon lamps were none too brilliant at 110 volts andgave much less than satisfactory illumination at 90 volts.As a result of this situation the generation and distribution of direct electriccurrent became very much of a localized matter. The Edison powerhouse couldserve an area less than a mile in diameter. In order to give service to a largecity it would be necessary to have a powerhouse in every square mile, or evencloser if a uniformly satisfactory current were to be supplied. Outside largecities the situation became even more difficult. This was a severe handicap ifelectricity was to become the universal power source.Tesla’s alternating-current power system, which Edison so emphatically rejectedwhen it was offered to him, freed electricity from its bondage to localisolation. Not alone were his alternating-current motors more simple andflexible than the direct-current machines, but it Was possible by a highlyefficient method of using transformers, which consisted of two coils of wirearound an iron core, to step up the voltage and simultaneously step down thecurrent in a proportionate amount, or use the process in reverse. The amount ofenergy involved, however, would remain practically unchanged.Copper wire entails a heavy investment when it is bought by the mile. Thediameter of the wire sets the limit to the amount of current it will carry. Withthe Edison direct-current system there was no practical way for transforming anelectric current. The voltage remained fixed and when the current was increasedto the carrying capacity of the wire no further expansion was possible on thatcircuit.With the Tesla system the amount of energy a wire would transport would beincreased tremendously by increasing the voltage and letting the current remainfixed below the carrying limit of the circuit. A very small wire could carry athousand or more times as much electrical energy in the Tesla polyphasealternating system as it could in the Edison direct-current system.By using Tesla’s alternating-current system electricity could be deliveredeconomically at vast distances from the powerhouse. It would be possible, ifdesired, to burn coal at the mouth of a mine for generating electricity, anddeliver the current cheaply at distant cities, or to generate electricity wherewater power was available and transmit it to distant points where it could beused.Tesla rescued the electrical giant from the apron strings of the powerhouse andgave it geographical freedom, the opportunity to expand into the wide-openspaces and work its magic. He laid the foundation for our present superpowersystem. A development of such magnitude was bound to be loaded with dynamite,and action was sure to follow as soon as someone set a match to the fuse.* They were numbered 581,968; 581,969; 581,970; 582,279; 582,280; 382,281 and382,282. These covered his single and polyphase motors, his distribution systemand polyphase transformers. In April of the following year, 1888, he applied forand was later granted five more patents. which included the four- and three-wirethree-phase systems. These were numbered 390,413; 390,414; 390,415; 390,721; and390,820. Within the year he applied for and was granted eighteen more: 401, 520;405, 858; 405, 859; 416, 191; 416, 192; 416, 193; 416, 194; 416, 195; 418, 248;424, 036; 435, 700; 433, 701; 433, 702; 433; 703; 445; 207; 455, 067; 459, 772and 464, 666.FIVEimage [images/00003.jpg] TESLA’S spectacular lecture and demonstration before the American Institute ofElectrical Engineers in New York focused on his work the attention of theelectrical fraternity throughout the world. There was no doubt in the mind ofthe vast majority of electrical engineers that Tesla’s discoveries created a newepoch in the electrical industry. But what could be done about it? There werefew manufacturers who could take advantage of it. His discoveries were in thesame predicament as a ten-pound diamond. No one would question the value of thestone but who would be in a position to purchase it or make any use of it?Tesla had given no specific thought to commercializing his work at this time. Hewas in the midst of a program of experimental work which was far from completeand he desired to finish it before engaging in another line of activity. Heexpected that there would be no alternative to establishing his own company andengaging in the manufacture of his dynamos, motors and transformers. Such acourse would take him away from the original experimental work which greatlyfascinated him, and which he did not wish to interrupt, Commercializing hisinventions, therefore, was a problem that could be postponed, as far as he wasconcerned, at least as long as the present financing of his work continued.George Westinghouse, head of the Westinghouse Electric Company in Pittsburgh,was a man of vision. He was already famous as an inventor of numerous electricaldevices but principally for his air brake for trains, and had made a fortune outof the exploitation of his own inventions. He recognized the tremendouscommercial possibilities presented by Tesla’s discoveries and the vastsuperiority of the alternating-over the direct-current system. He was apractical man of business and was not limited in his choice between the twosystems.Edison, head of the Edison General Electric Company, on the other hand, wasunder a limitation. Edison’s invention was the incandescent electric lamp.Having developed this project, he was faced with finding some way to use itcommercially. In order to sell his lamps to the public it was necessary to makethe electricity available for lighting them. This necessitated the building ofpowerhouses and distribution systems. Another kind of electric lamp was alreadyavailable—the arc lamp—in which he was but slightly interested. The Edisonsystem powerhouses were standardized on low-voltage direct current. At that timedirect-current motors were in use, and most technical men believed it was not atall likely there would ever be a practical alternating-current motor. Thedirect-current system, therefore, offered a number of advantages of a practicalnature from Edison’s viewpoint.Westinghouse had no pet project comparable to the incandescent lamp around whichhe had to throw protecting conditions such as direct-current limitations, so hecould look at the Tesla alternating-current discoveries from an unbiased andpurely objective point of view. He reached his decision a month after Tesla’slecture. Having done this, he forwarded a brief note to Tesla, making anengagement to see him in the latter’s laboratory.The two inventors had not previously met but each of them was well acquaintedwith the other’s work. Westinghouse, born in 1846, was ten years older thanTesla. He was a short, stout, bearded, impressive-looking individual, and had ahabit of directness in conducting his affairs that amounted almost to bluntness.Tesla, thirty-two years old, was tall, dark, handsome, slender and suave. Theymade a strongly contrasting pair as they stood in Tesla’s laboratory, but theyhad three things in common: they both were inventors, engineers and lovedelectricity. Tesla had in his laboratory dynamos, transformers, and motors withwhich he could demonstrate his discoveries and models in actual operatingconditions. Here Westinghouse was right at home and quickly became completelysold on the inventor and his inventions.So favorably impressed was Westinghouse that he decided to act quickly. Thestory was related to the author by Tesla.“I will give you one million dollars cash for your alternating-current patents,plus royalty,” Westinghouse blurted at the startled Tesla. This tall, suavegentleman, however, gave no outward sign that he had almost been bowled over bysurprise.“If you will make the royalty one dollar per horsepower, I will accept theoffer,” Tesla replied.“A million cash, a dollar a horsepower royalty,” Westinghouse repeated.“That is acceptable,” said Tesla.“Sold,” said Westinghouse. “You will receive a check and a contract in a few.days.”Here was a case of two great men, each possessed with the power of seeingvisions of the future on a gigantic panorama, and each with complete faith inthe other, arranging a tremendous transaction with utter disregard of details.The amount involved was unquestionably a record one, for that time, for aninvention. While Tesla liked to think of his complete polyphase system as asingle invention, he was, nevertheless, selling about twenty inventions on whichpatents were already issued, and about as many more still to issue. With a totalof forty patents involved in the transaction, most of them strongly basic innature, he received, therefore, about $25,000 per patent. Westinghouse therebyobtained a record-breaking bargain by buying the patents in wholesalequantities.Westinghouse arranged with Tesla to come to Pittsburgh “at a high salary” for ayear, to act as consultant in the commercial application of his inventions. Thegenerous offer made by the Pittsburgh magnate for the purchase of his patentsmade it unnecessary for Tesla to have any more worries about having to devote amajor portion of his time to exploiting his inventions commercially through hisown company. He could afford, therefore, to give this year of his time.The apparatus which Tesla demonstrated to Westinghouse when the latter visitedhis laboratory, and which worked so beautifully, was designed for operation witha current of 60 cycles. Tesla’s investigation had demonstrated that this was thefrequency at which the greatest efficiency of operation could be achieved. Athigher frequencies there was a saving in the amount of iron required; but thedrop in efficiency, and design difficulties that developed, were not compensatedfor by the very small saving in cost of metal. At lower frequencies the amountof iron required increased, and the apparatus grew in size faster than increasedefficiency justified.Tesla went to Pittsburgh and expected to clear up all problems in less than ayear. Here, though, he encountered engineers who faced the problem of producinga motor with a design that would insure, first, certainty of smooth and reliableoperation; second, economy of operation; third, economy in use of materials;fourth, ease of manufacture; as well as other problems. Tesla had these problemsin mind but not with the urgency with which the engineers faced them. Inaddition he was quite adamant in the choice of 60 cycles as the standardfrequency for alternating current while engineers, who had experience on 133cycles, were not so sure that the lower frequency would be best for the Teslamotors. At any rate there was conflict between the inventor, interested mainlyin principles, and engineers interested in practical design problems. Verydefinite problems were encountered in making the Tesla motor work on asingle-phase current in small sizes. In this type of design, artifices had to beincorporated in the motor to achieve some of the characteristics of a two-phasecurrent from the single-phase current that was supplied to operate it.Tesla was thoroughly disgusted with the situation. He felt his advice concerninghis own invention was not being accepted, so he quit Pittsburgh. Westinghousewas sure the situation would work itself out. Seeking to persuade Tesla toremain, he offered him, Tesla revealed many years later, twenty-four thousanddollars a year, one third of the net income of the company and his ownlaboratory, if he would stay on and direct the development of his system. Tesla,now wealthy and anxious to return to original research, rejected the offer.Development work proceeded after Tesla left, and soon practical designs wereproduced for all sizes of motors and dynamos, and their manufacture started.Tesla was happy to note that the 60-cycle standard, his emphatic choice, butwhich had been questioned on the ground it was less practical in small units,had been adopted as the standard frequency.On returning to his New York laboratory, Tesla declared that he had not made asingle worth-while contribution to electrical science during the year he spentat Pittsburgh. “I was not free at Pittsburgh,” he explained; “I was dependentand could not work. To do creative work I must be completely free. When I becamefree of that situation ideas and inventions rushed through my brain like aNiagara.” During the following four years he devoted a large fraction of histime to further developments of his polyphase power system, and applied for, andwas granted, forty-five patents. Those granted in foreign countries would bringthe total to several times this number.THE ideas of the two giants among inventors—Edison and Tesla—were meeting inhead-on battle. Out of the laboratories of the two geniuses, within sight ofeach other in South Fifth Avenue in New York, had come world-shakingdevelopments.There had been considerable conflict between Edison, who adhered strictly todirect current, and those who supported the claims for alternating current. TheThomson-Houston Company and the Westinghouse Electric Company had extensivelydeveloped this field for series electric fighting and arc lighting before theTesla power system was developed. Edison had engaged in many tilts at thesecompetitor, attacking alternating current as unsafe because of the high voltagesused. The advent of the Tesla system added fuel to the fire.It was Tesla’s belief that when the New York State Prison authorities adoptedhigh-voltage alternating current for electrocution of condemned prisoners, theEdison interests had engineered the project to discredit alternating current.There is no doubt about the aid the prison authorities’choice gave thedirect-current group; but their decision was undoubtedly based on the fact thatdirect current could not, by any practical means, be produced at the highvoltages required, whereas alternating-current potentials could be very easilyincreased. Direct current is just as deadly, at the same voltage and amperage,as alternating current. In this “war of the currents,” however, as in otherwars, appeals to the emotions, instead of to simple facts, were the governinginfluences.The task of putting the United States on an electrical power basis—which is whatGeorge Westinghouse undertook when he began to exploit the Tesla patents—was agigantic one requiring not only engineering talent but capital. The WestinghouseElectric Company experienced a tremendous expansion in the volume of itsbusiness, but the upward surge came at a time when the country was going into astage of commercial and financial depression; and Westinghouse soon foundhimself in difficulties.This was, in addition, an era in which competing giant financial interests werebattling for control of the industrial structure of the country through controlof capital. It was a time of mergers, a period when the financial interests werebuilding larger units of production by uniting smaller companies in relatedfields, frequently forcing these combinations without regard to what the ownersof the companies desired.One merger, internally initiated and arranged by mutual consent, broughttogether the Thomson-Houston Company and the Edison General Electric Company,the two biggest competitors of Westinghouse Electric, to form the presentGeneral Electric Company. This was a challenge to competing financial interests.Westinghouse had expanded his business at a very rapid rate in exploiting theTesla patents. Because his financial structure thereby lost a certain amount offlexibility, he became vulnerable to financial operators and soon found himselfin the toils of a merger that involved uniting several other small companieswith his organization. Financial interests that had stepped into the situationdemanded that the Westinghouse Electric Company be reorganized as a step towardbringing about a merger with it of the U. S. Electric Company and theConsolidated Electric Light Company, the new unit to be known as theWestinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company.Before this reorganization would be consummated the finanrial advisers, instrategic positions, insisted that Westinghouse jettison some of his plans andprojects which they considered inadvisable or a detriment to getting the newcompany onto a new foundation that would be sounder from a financial point ofview.One of the requirements was that Westinghouse get rid of the contract with Teslacalling for royalty payments of $1 per horsepower on all alternating-currentarticles sold under his patents.* The financial advisers pointed out that if thebusiness which Westinghouse expected the company would do under the Teslapatents in the ensuing year was anywhere near as great as estimated, the amountto be paid out under this contract would be tremendous, totaling millions ofdollars; and this, at the time of reorganization, appeared a dangerous burden,imperiling the stability which they were trying to attain for the neworganization.Westinghouse strenuously objected to the procedure. This patent-royalty payment,he insisted, was in accordance with usual procedures and would not be a burdenon the company, as it was included in costs of production, was paid for by thecustomers, and did not come out of the company’s earnings. Westinghouse, himselfan inventor of first magnitude, had a strong sense of justice in his dealingswith inventors.The financial advisers, however, were not to be overruled. They nailedWestinghouse on the spot by insisting that the million dollars he had paid Teslawas more than adequate compensation for an invention, and that by making such anexorbitant payment he had imperiled the financial structure of his company andjeopardized his bankers’interest. Any further imperiling of the reorganizationby any effort to retain the royalty contract would, it was argued, result in thewithdrawing of support that would save the company.The situation boiled down to the common “Either-Or” technique.Westinghouse was required to handle the negotiations with Tesla. No situationcould be more embarrassing to him. Nevertheless, Westinghouse was a realistamong realists. He never hesitated to face facts squarely and with a bluntdirectness. “I will give you one million dollars cash for youralternating-current patents, plus royalty”: he had been both brief and bluntwhen he purchased the patents from Tesla. Now he was faced with the problem ofundoing the situation into which he had entered with such brevity. Then moneytalked and he held the money. Now Tesla held the dominant position; he held aperfectly valid contract worth many millions, and he could go to court to forcecompliance with its terms. Edison’s successful suit against infringers of hiselectric-light patent, bringing disaster to many companies that violated hispatent property rights, had caused the whole industrial world to hold a new andwholesome respect for patent rights.Westinghouse had no reason for believing that Tesla would show the slightestinclination to relinquish his contract or permit its terms to be changed toprovide a smaller rate of royalty. He knew that Tesla’s pride had been hurt bythe disagreement with the Pittsburgh engineers, and that he might not now be ina conciliatory mood. On the other hand, Westinghouse knew that he had succeededin having Tesla’s ideas adopted. His greatest comfort came from the fact that hehad entered into the contract with good faith—and with the same good faith hewas trying to handle a much less satisfactory situation. Perhaps he could offerTesla an executive position in the company in lieu of the contract. There wouldbe mutual advantages in such an arrangement.There is no means of fixing the definite value of the contract Tesla held. Hispatents covered every department of the new alternating-current power system,and royalties could be collected on powerhouse equipment and motors. At thattime the electric power industry had barely started; no one could look into thefuture and see the tremendous volume of business that would be developed. *It would be a tough job for any executive, no matter how shrewd or clever, totalk a man out of a contract that would net him many millions of dollars, orinduce him to accept a reduction in rates amounting to millions.Westinghouse called on Tesla, meeting him in the same South Fifth Avenuelaboratory where he had purchased the patents four years before. Withoutpreliminaries or apologies Westinghouse explained the situation.“Your decision,” said the Pittsburgh magnate, “determines the fate of theWestinghouse Company.”“Suppose I should refuse to give up my contract; what would you do then?” askedTesla.“In that event you would have to deal with the bankers, for I would no longerhave any power in the situation,” Westinghouse replied.“And if I give up the contract you will save your company and retain control soyou can proceed with your plans to give my polyphase system to the world?” Teslacontinued.“I believe your polyphase system is the greatest discovery in the field ofelectricity,” Westinghouse explained. “It was my efforts to give it to the worldthat brought on the present difficulty, but I intend to continue, no matter whathappens, to proceed with my original plans to put the country on analternating-current basis.”“Mr. Westinghouse,” said Tesla, drawing himself up to his full height of sixfeet two inches and beaming down on the Pittsburgh magnate who was himself a bigman, “you have been my friend, you believed in me when others had no faith; youwere brave enough to go ahead and pay me a million dollars when others lackedcourage; you supported me when even your own engineers lacked vision to see thebig things ahead that you and I saw; you have stood by me as a friend. Thebenefits that will come to civilization from my polyphase system mean more to methan the money involved. Mr. Westinghouse, you will save your company so thatyou can develop my inventions. Here is your contract and here is my contract—Iwill tear both of them to pieces and you will no longer have any troubles frommy royalties. Is that sufficient?”Matching his actions to his words Tesla tore up the contract and threw it in thewaste basket; and Westinghouse, thanks to Tesla’s magnificent gesture, was ableto return to Pittsburgh and use the facilities of the reorganized company, whichbecame the present Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, to make goodhis promise to Tesla to make his alternating-current system available to theworld.Probably nowhere in history is there recorded so magnificent a sacrifice tofriendship as that involved in Tesla’s stupendous gift to Westinghouse of $12,000,000 in unpaid royalties, although Westinghouse personally received onlyindirect benefits from it.It is also probable that the failure to pay Tesla these royalties resulted inone of the greatest handicaps to scientific and industrial progress which thehuman race has experienced. A few years later Tesla, still an intellectual giantfar from the peak of his greatest growth, still pouring forth a profusion ofinventions and discoveries of first magnitude, equal in importance to his firstefforts which put the world on an electrical power basis, found himself withoutfunds with which to develop his discoveries, with the result that many of themhave been lost.Nearly fifty years after this majestic relinquishment of wealth on the altar offriendship, during which time Tesla had had opportunity to see the United Statesand the world as a whole wax wealthy out of the power he had made available, hewas called on to respond, with a speech, to honorary citation by the Instituteof Immigrant Welfare. Tesla, then about eighty, was unable to appear in person.He had experienced decades of poverty in which he faced ridicule for his failureto develop inventions which he declared he had made, and had been forced to movefrequently from hotel to hotel, owing to inability to pay his bills. In spite ofthese experiences he developed no rancor toward Westinghouse in whose behalf hesacrificed his $12,000,000 in royalties. Instead, he retained his original warmfriendship. This is indicated by a statement in the speech he sent to theInstitute to be read at its dinner held in the Hotel Biltmore, May 12, 1938:“George Westinghouse was, in “my opinion, the only man on this globe who couldtake my alternating-current system under the circumstances then existing and winthe battle against prejudice and money power. He was a pioneer of imposingstature, one of the world’s true noblemen of whom America may well be proud andto whom humanity owes an immense debt of gratitude.”* No documentary evidence exists concerning this contract. The author locatedtwo sources of information. One was in complete agreement with the story hererelated. The other states that the million-dollar payment was advance royaltiesand Tesla so described it to him, declaring no further royalties were paid.* The latest data available indicate that in 1941 there was 162,000,000horsepower of electrical generating machinery in operation in the United States,practically all of it for alternating current. Assuming a uniform growth from1891 to 1941, the installed horsepower in 1905, when the first Tesla patentswould have expired, would have been about twenty million. This figure is,apparently, too high.According to a census of central stations in the United States conducted by T.Commerford Martin (Electrical World, March 14, 1914) the horsepower ofgenerators in operation in 1902 was 1, 620,000 and in 1907 the figure had risento 6, 900,000. On a pro rata, per-year basis, this would make the figure for1905, the year when Tesla’s first patents expired, 5,000,000. During this periodmany manufacturers who had been using steam power installed dynamos in theirfactories and operated isolated plants. These would not be included in thecentral-station figures and, if added, would bring the total horsepower toperhaps 7,000,000. Tesla would hare been entitled to $7,000,000 royalties onthis equipment, on the basis of his $1-per-horsepower arrangement. In additionhe would have been entitled to royalties on motors that used the power generatedby these dynamos. If only three quarters of the current generated were used forpower, this would have entitled him to additional royalties of $5,000,000, or atotal of $12,000,000.SIXimage [images/00003.jpg] WHEN Tesla left the Westinghouse plant at Pittsburgh in 1889 to return to hislaboratory in New York, he entered a new world. The magnificent polyphase systemwhich he had already produced was but a small sample of the greater wonders thatstill remained to be revealed, and he was anxious to start exploring the newrealm.He was not approaching an entirely unknown realm in which he would have to feelhis way in darkness in the hope of stumbling upon something of value, althoughanyone else at that time would have been in that position. On that fatefulafternoon in February in Budapest in 1882, when he was given the vision of therotating magnetic field, there had come with it an illumination that revealed tohim the whole cosmos, in its infinite variations and its myriad of forms ofmanifestations, as a symphony of alternating currents. For him, the harmonies ofthe universe were played on a scale of electrical vibrations of a vast range inoctaves. In one of the lower octaves was a single note, the 60-cycle-per-secondalternating current, and in one of the higher octaves was visible light with itsfrequency of billions of cycles per second.Tesla had in mind a course of experimentation in which he would explore thisregion of electrical vibration between his alternating current and light waves.He would increase the frequency of the alternating current through the unknownintervening regions. If one note in a lower octave produced such a magnificentinvention as the rotating magnetic field and the polyphase system, who couldimagine the glorious possibilities that lay hidden on other notes in higheroctaves? And there were thousands of octaves to be explored. He would constructan electrical harmonium by producing electrical vibrations in all frequencies,and study their characteristics. He would then, he hoped, be able to understandthe motif of the cosmic symphony of electrical vibrations that pervaded theentire universe.Tesla, at the age of thirty-three, was now wealthy. He had received $1,000,000from the Westinghouse Company for his first crop of inventions. Of this,$500,000 went to A. K. Brown and his associate who had financed his experiments.Still greater inventions were to follow. He would never need money. He would, hethen believed, have royalties in the millions from his alternating-currentpatents. He could spend as freely as he wished, penetrating the secrets ofNature and applying his discoveries to human welfare. It was his responsibilityto be so engaged. He knew he was gifted as no other man had been blessed withvision, talent and ability; and he in turn would endow the world with supernaltreasures of scientific knowledge which he would extract from the secretrecesses of the universe and, through the activities of his mighty mind,transform into agencies to brighten the lives, lighten the labors and increasethe happiness of the human race.Was he a superegoist in his attitude? If so, he was not activated by selfishmotives. To him it mattered not what he thought, so long as he remainedobjective in his thinking and his thoughts could be translated into demonstrablefacts. What if he did consider himself greater than other men: did not thisviewpoint conform to the facts? Suppose he did consider himself a man ofdestiny. Could he not bring evidence to support the contention? It was notnecessary for Tesla actually to see an event occur in order to enjoy itsrealization. Had he not as a youth declared that he would make a practicalalternating-current motor, only to be told by his professor that the goal wasimpossible of attainment—and had he not already accomplished this“impossibility”? Had he not taken the direct-current dynamos of Edison, whom allthe world looked upon as a great genius, and had he not greatly improved theirdesign and operation; and in addition, had he not produced a vastly superiorsystem for producing, distributing and using electricity? To all of theseinquiries Tesla could answer in the affirmative without going beyond the boundsof modesty concerning his achievements.His attitude was not that of an egoist. It was an attitude of supreme faith inhimself and in the vision that had been given him. To a man of ability, withsuch supreme faith in himself, and necessary financial resources to advance hispurposes, the world of accomplishments is without limits. This was the pictureof Tesla as he returned to his laboratory in lower Fifth Avenue, New York, inthe latter part of 1889.Tesla had studied a wide range of frequencies of alternating current in order toselect the frequency at which his polyphase system would operate mostefficiently. His calculations indicated important changes in characteristics andeffects as the frequency of the current was increased; and his observations withthe electrical machinery he built confirmed his calculations. He noted that eversmaller quantities of iron were required as the frequencies were increased, andhe now wished to explore the very high frequencies at which unusual effectsshould be produced without any iron in the magnetic circuit.When, back in Budapest following his rotating magnetic-field discovery, he hadplayed with mental calculations of the properties of alternating currents allthe way from the very lowest frequency up to that of light, no one had yetexplored this region. James Clerk Maxwell, at Cambridge University, England,had, however, nine years before, in 1873, published his beautiful presentationon an electromagnetic theory of light, and his equations indicated that therewas a vast range of electromagnetic vibrations above and below visiblelight—vibrations of much longer and much shorter wavelengths. While Tesla wasengaged in making models of his polyphase system in 1887, too, ProfessorHeinrich Hertz, in Germany, put the Maxwell theory to test in the range of wavesa few meters long. He was able to produce such waves by the spark discharge ofan induction coil, and was able to absorb such waves from space and change themback to a small spark at some distance from the coil.Hertz’s work gave support to Tesla’s theory that there was an interestingdiscovery to be made on almost every note of the whole gamut of vibrationsbetween the known ones of the electrical current and those of light. Tesla feltsure that if he could continually increase the frequency of electricalvibrations until they equaled that of light, he would be able to produce lightby a direct and highly efficient process instead of the extremely wastefulprocess used in the Edison incandescent lamp, in which the useful light waveswere a very small fraction of the wasted heat waves emitted in the process, andonly five per cent of the electrical energy was effectively utilized.Tesla started his investigations by building rotary alternating-current dynamoswith up to 384 magnetic poles, and with these devices he was able to generatecurrents up to 10,000 cycles per second. He found that these high-frequencycurrents presented many fascinating possibilities for even more efficient powertransmission than his very practical 60-cycle polyphase system. He thereforecarried on a parallel line of research into transformers for raising andlowering the voltage of such currents.High-frequency alternating-current dynamos, similar to those designed by Teslain 1890, were subsequently developed by F. W. Alexanderson into the high-powerwireless transmitters which put transatlantic wireless transmission, more thantwo decades later, on such a sound practical basis that the Government would notpermit control of it to go to a foreign country and preserved for the UnitedStates its predominant position in world wireless.The high-frequency current transformers which Tesla developed proved to bespectacular performers. They contained not a trace of iron; as a matter of fact,the presence of iron was found to interfere with their operation. They wereair-core transformers and consisted merely of concentric primary and secondarycoils. The voltages he was able to produce with these transformers, which becameknown as Tesla coils, were very high. In the early experiments he attainedpotentials that would spark across a couple of inches of air, but in a shorttime he made tremendous progress and was producing flaming discharges. Inworking with these voltages he encountered difficulties in insulating hisapparatus, and so he developed the technique that is now in universal use inhigh-tension apparatus: that of immersing the apparatus in oil and excluding allair from the coils, a discovery of great commercial importance.There was a limit, however, above which the use of rotary generators ofhigh-frequency currents was not practicable, so Tesla set about the task ofdeveloping a different type of generator. There was nothing novel about thebasic idea he employed. In rotary dynamos, current is generated by moving a wirein a circle past a number of magnetic poles in succession. The same effect canbe attained by moving the wire back and forth with an oscillating motion infront of one magnetic pole. No one, however, had as yet produced a practicalreciprocating dynamo. Tesla produced one that was extremely practical for hisparticular purpose; but otherwise it had little utility, and he later felt thathe could have employed much better the time he spent on it. It was an ingenioussingle-cylinder engine without valves, and could be operated by compressed airor steam. It was supplied with ports like a small two-cycle marine engine. A rodextended from the piston through the cylinder head at either end, and at eachend of the rods was attached a flat coil of wire which, by the reciprocatingaction of the piston, was caused to move back and forth through the field of anelectromagnet. The magnetic field through its cushioning effect served as aflywheel.Tesla was able to obtain a speed of 20,000 oscillations per minute, and tomaintain such a remarkable degree of constancy in operation that he proposed themaintenance of equally constant speed of operation for his 60-cycle polyphasesystem and the use of synchronous motors, geared down to the proper extent, asclocks which would furnish correct time wherever alternating current wasavailable. This proposal furnished the foundation for our modern electricclocks. As with many another of his practical and useful suggestions, he did nottake out a patent on the idea, and gained no financial advantage from it.IN WORKING with his polyphase system, Tesla gained a thorough understanding ofthe part played by the two factors, capacity and inductance, inalternating-current circuits; the former acting like a spring and the latterlike a storage tank. His calculations indicated that with currents ofsufficiently high frequency it would be possible to produce resonance withrelatively small values of inductance and capacity. Producing resonance istuning a circuit electrically. The mechanical effects analagous to electricalresonance are the causing of a pendulum to swing through a wide arc by giving ita series of very light but equally timed touches, or the destruction of a bridgeby soldiers marching in unison over it. Each small vibration re-enforces itspredecessors until tremendous effects are built up.In a tuned electrical circuit a condenser supplies the capacity and a coil ofwire supplies the inductance. A condenser ordinarily consists of two parallelmetal plates separated from each other a short distance by an insulatingmaterial. Each plate is connected to either end of the inductance coil. The sizeof the condenser and the coil is determined by the frequency of the current. Thecoil-condenser combination and the current are tuned to each other. The currentcan be pictured as flowing into the condenser until it is fully charged. It thenflows elastically into the inductance coil, which stores the energy by buildingup its magnetic field. When the current ceases to flow in the coil, the magneticfield collapses and gives back to the coil the energy previously used inbuilding up the magnetic field, thus causing a current to flow back into thecondenser to charge it up to overflowing again, so that it is ready to repeatthe process. This flow back and forth between the condenser and coil takes placein step with the periodic reversal of the alternating current which supplies theenergy when resonance is established. Each time it takes place, the chargingcurrent comes along at the right instant to give it a boost, so that theoscillations build up to tremendous values.Tesla, in discussing this plan of electrical tuning of circuits in a lecture,given several years later, said:The first question to answer then is whether pure resonance effects areproducible. Theory and experiment show that such is impossible in nature for, asthe oscillations become more vigorous, the losses in vibrating bodies andenvironing media rapidly increase, and necessarily check the vibrations, whichwould otherwise go on increasing forever. It is a fortunate circumstance thatpure resonance is not producible for, if it were, there is no telling whatdangers might lie in wait for the innocent experimenter. But, to a certaindegree, resonance is producible, the magnitude of the effects being limited bythe imperfect conductivity and imperfect elasticity of the media, or, generallystated, frictional losses. The smaller these losses the more striking are theeffects.Tesla applied the electrical tuning principles to his coils and discovered thathe was able to produce tremendous resonance effects and build up very highvoltages. The tuning principles he developed in 1890 are those which have madeour modern radio, and the development of the earlier art, “wireless,” possible.He had been working with, and demonstrating, these principles before others whoreceived credit had begun to learn the first lessons in electricity.Seeking a new source of high-frequency currents, higher than could be producedby any mechanical apparatus, Tesla made use of a discovery that had been madethe year in which he was born, by Lord Kelvin, in England, in 1856, and forwhich no use had thus far been found. Up to the time of Kelvin’s discovery ithad been believed that when a condenser was discharged the electricity flowedout of one plate into the other, like water being poured from a glass, thusestablishing equilibrium. Kelvin showed that the process was far moreinteresting and complex; that its action was like the bobbing up and down thattakes place when a weighted stretched spring is released. The electricity, heshowed, rushes from one plate into the other and then back again, the processcontinuing until all of the stored up energy is used up in overcoming frictionallosses. The back-and-forth surges take place at a tremendously high frequency,hundreds of millions a second.The combination of condenser discharges and tuned circuits opened a new realm inelectrical science as significant and as important as Tesla’s polyphase system.He worked out remarkably simple and automatic methods for charging thecondensers by low voltage (direct and alternating currents), and dischargingthem through his new air-core transformers, or Tesla coils, to produce currentsof enormously high voltages that oscillated at the tremendously high frequencyof the condenser discharge. The properties of these currents were unlikeanything that had been seen before. He was again pioneering in an entirely newfield, with tremendous possibilities. He labored feverishly in his laboratory;and as he lay in bed at night for his five-hours’ rest, which included two hoursof sleep, he formulated new experiments.Tesla announced the heating effect of high-frequency currents on the body in1890 and proposed their use as a therapeutic device. In this he was a pioneer,but soon had many imitators here and abroad who claimed to be originators. Hemade no effort to protect his discovery or prevent the pirating of hisinvention. When the same observation was made thirty-five years later inlaboratories using vacuum-tube oscillators as the source of the high-frequencycurrents, it was hailed as a new discovery and developed as a modern wonder.Tesla’s original discovery is, however, the basis of a vast array of very recentelectronic applications in which high-frequency currents are used to produceheat for industrial purposes.When he gave his first lecture on the subject before the American Institute ofElectrical Engineers at Columbia College, in May, 1891, he was able to producespark discharges five inches long, indicating a potential of about 100,000volts, but, more important, he was able to produce phenomena which includedelectrical sheets of flame, and a variety of new forms of illumination—electriclamps the like of which had never been seen before, nor dreamed of in thewildest imagination of any experimenter.This lecture produced a sensation in engineering circles. He was already famousin this field for the astounding revelations he had made before the sameorganization on that earlier occasion when he described his discovery of thepolyphase alternating-current system. That discovery was an intellectualaccomplishment of bewildering brilliance, made impressive by the tremendouscommercial importance of the discovery. The experiments with the high-frequencyand high-potential currents, however, were spectacular; the crackling of thehigh-voltage sparks, the flashing of the high-potential sheets of electricalflame; the brilliant bulbs and tubes of electrical fire, the amazing physicaleffects he produced with the new currents, made a profound emotional appeal tothe startled beholders.The man who could produce these two pioneering developments within two yearsmust be more than a genius! The news of his new accomplishment flashed quicklythroughout the world, and Tesla’s fame now rested on a double foundation.The world-wide fame that came to him at this time was unfortunate. Tesla wouldhave been entirely superhuman had he not derived a great deal of satisfactionout of the hero-worshiping adulation that now came to him. It was only fiveyears ago that he had been hungry and penniless in the streets of New York,competing with equally hungry hordes of unemployed for the few existent jobscalling for brute labor, while his head bulged with important inventions whichhe was anxious to give to the world. No one would listen to him then—and now theintellectual élite of the nation were honoring him as an unrivaled genius.TESLA was a spectacular figure in New York in 1891. A tall, dark, handsome,well-built individual who had a flair for wearing clothes that gave him an airof magnificence, who spoke perfect English but carried an atmosphere of Europeanculture which was worshiped at that time, he was an outstanding personality toall who beheld him. Hidden behind his quiet, self-effacing demeanor, and anextreme modesty that manifested itself as an exaggerated shyness, was the mindof a genius which had worked electrical wonders that fired the imagination ofall and exceeded the understanding of the vast majority of the population. Inaddition Tesla was a young man, not yet thirty-five, who had recently received amillion dollars and was a bachelor.A bachelor with a million dollars, culture and fame, could not avoid being ashining mark in New York in the early years of the gay nineties. Many were thedesigning matrons with marriageable daughters who cast envious eyes in thedirection of this eligible young man. The social leaders looked upon him as afascinating decoration for their salons. The big men of business looked upon himas a good man to know. The intellectuals of the day found his almostunbelievable accomplishments a source of inspiration.Except at formal dinners Tesla always dined alone, and never under anycircumstances would he dine with a woman at a two some dinner. No matter howmuch a woman might gush over him or strive to gain his favor, Tesla, in mostadamant fashion, maintained a thoroughly impersonal attitude. At theWaldorf-Astoria and at Delmonico’s he had particular tables which were alwaysreserved for him. They occupied secluded positions in the dining rooms becausewhen he entered either room he was the cynosure of all eyes and did not enjoybeing on exhibition.In spite of all of the adulation that was heaped upon him, Tesla had but onedesire—to continue his laboratory experiments undisturbed by outsidedistractions. There was a tremendous empire of new knowledge to be explored. Hewas fired with a potential of enthusiasm for the work that was as high as thevoltage of the currents with which he was working, and new ideas were coming tohim with almost the rapidity of the cycles in his high-frequency current.There were three broad fields in which he wished to develop applications whichwere now clearly outlined in his mind: a system of wireless power transmissionthat would excel his own polyphase system, a new type of illumination, and thewireless transmission of intelligence. He wished to work on them allsimultaneously. They were not separate and isolated subjects but all closelyintermeshed, all notes on that vast cosmic scale of vibration represented by hisbeloved alternating currents. He did not wish to play on one note at a time, aswould a violinist; he preferred to play as a pianist, striking many notes atonce and weaving them into beautiful chords. Were it possible to occupy theposition of leader and simultaneously play all of the instruments in a greatsymphony orchestra, he would have been still better pleased. The instruments inhis orchestra, however, would be electrical devices oscillating in tune withtheir energizing currents or with their environment. To the extent that he wasunable to realize his most expansive desires, he was under mental pressure thatdrove him to a working pace which no individual of ordinary strength couldwithstand without a resulting complete physical breakdown.The spectacular lecture and demonstration on high-frequency and high-potentialcurrents which he gave before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers inFebruary, 1891, at Columbia College, created as profound a sensation as did hisearlier one. Each opened an entirely new realm of scientific investigation andpractical discoveries. The discoveries contained in either lecture would havebeen sufficient to stand as the fruit of a lifetime’s work and bring lastingfame. Two such events in rapid succession seemed almost unbelievable—yet Teslaseemed to be scarcely well launched on his career, with more important workstill to come.Requests that he give lectures came from learned societies throughout thiscountry and Europe, but he begged to be excused because of the tremendouspressure on his time which his work entailed. Equally insistent were the socialdemands that were being made upon him. Social groups sought in every way tohonor him, and incidentally to shine in his reflected glory. Tesla was notvulnerable to the importunings of the socialites who sought him merely as ascintillating satellite, but the clever “lion hunters” of that day soondiscovered his Achilles’ heel—an intelligent interest in his accomplishments anda sympathetic ear for his dreams of wonders still to come.With this technique in successful operation, Tesla was captured and sooncompletely lionized. He was guest of honor at a continuous round of functionsand he met the social obligations involved in them by staging, in return,elaborate dinners at the Waldorf-Astoria followed by demonstration parties athis laboratory on South Fifth Avenue. Tesla never did a halfway job on anything.When he staged a dinner he left nothing to chance in the matter of cuisine,service and decorations. He sought rare fish and fowl, meats of surpassingexcellence, and choicest liquors and exquisite wines of the best vintages. Hisdinners were the talk of the town and having been a guest at a Tesla dinner wasa mark of social distinction, proof of membership in the inner group of theélite within Ward MacAllister’s “400.” At these dinners Tesla presided as a mostmeticulous host, or more accurately, as an old-world absolute monarch, for hewould sample all food brought to the dining room; and rarely did an event passwithout the grandiose host sending back some sauce or wine of unquestionedexcellence as unworthy of his guests.Following each of these meals Tesla would escort his guests to his laboratorybelow Washington Square; and here his demonstrations were even more spectacularthan his dinners. He had a flair for the dramatic; and the strange-lookingdevices with which his laboratory was furnished provided a grotesque and bizarrebackground for the fantastic displays of seemingly unearthly forces that withinvisible fingers set objects whirling, caused globes and tubes of variousshapes to glow resplendently in unfamiliar colors as if a section of a distantsun were suddenly transplanted into the darkened room, and crackling of fire andhissing sheets of flame to issue from monster coils to the accompaniment ofsulfurous fumes of ozone produced by the electrical discharges that suggestedthis magician’s chamber was connected directly with the seething vaults of hell.Nor was this illusion dispelled when Tesla would permit hundreds of thousands ofvolts of electricity to pan through his body and light a lamp or melt a wirewhich he held.The amazing feat of harmlessly passing through his body currents of tremendouslyhigh voltage and high frequency was one which Tesla evolved by his mentalexperiments long before he had an opportunity to test them in his laboratory.The low-frequency alternating currents, such as are now used on home-lightingcircuits, would, he knew from unpleasant experiences, produce a painful shock ifpassed through the body. When light waves impinged on the body, however, no suchpainful sensation was produced. The only difference between the electriccurrents and light waves, he reasoned, was a matter of frequency, the electriccurrents oscillating at the rate of 60 per second and the light waves atbillions per second.Somewhere between these two extremes the shock-producing property ofelectromagnetic vibrations must disappear; and he surmised the point would benear the lower end of the gap. Damage done to the body by electric shock hedivided into two factors, one—the destruction of tissues by the heating effectwhich increased or diminished as the amperage of the current was raised orlowered; and two—the sensation of acute pain which varied with the number ofalternations of the current, each alternation producing a single stimulus whichwas transmitted by the nerves as a pain.Nerves, he knew, could respond to stimuli up to a rate of about 700 per second,but were unable to transmit impulses received at a more rapid rate. In thisrespect they acted very much like the ear, which is unable to hear airvibrations above a frequency of about 15,000 per second, and the eye, which isblind to color vibrations of a frequency higher than that in violet light.When he constructed his high-frequency alternating-current dynamos, he hadfrequencies up to 20,000 per second with which to test his theory; and by fingertests across the terminals he was able to demonstrate that the nerves wereunable to perceive the individual vibrations at this rapid rate. The amperage,which carried the tissue-destroying power, was still too high in the output ofthese machines to pass safely through his body, even though the sensation ofpain was lacking.By passing these currents through his newly invented air-core transformers, hecould increase their voltage ten-thousand fold and reduce the amperageproportionately. The current density would thereby be reduced below the point atwhich it would injure tissues. He would then have a current which would notproduce sensation and would not harm the tissues. He cautiously tested thetheory by passing the currents through two fingers, then his arm, next from handto hand through his body and finally from his head to his feet. If a sparkjumped to or from his body, there was a pin-prick sensation at the point ofcontact, but this could be eliminated by holding a piece of metal to and fromwhich the spark could jump while the current passed through the tissues withoutproducing any sensation.The energy content of these currents, which is proportionate to the currentmultiplied by the voltage, could be very high and produce spectacular effectssuch as melting metal rods, exploding lead disks, and lighting incandescent orvacuum-tube lamps after passing painlessly through his body.The European scientific societies were persistent in their efforts to induceTesla to accept their invitations to lecture before them, and finally heacceded. He set extravagantly high standards for the contents of his lectures,and their preparation entailed a tremendous amount of labor. All of the materialhad to be entirely new. He would never repeat an experiment previouslypresented. Every technical statement had to be tested at least twenty times toinsure complete accuracy. His lectures would last two or three hours; and everyminute of the time was crowded with new and awe-inspiring demonstrations of hisconstant stream of discoveries. He used a great array of devices fashioned byhimself and built in his own laboratories to illustrate his talks. A Teslalecture, therefore, was an extremely important event in the scientific world anda most impressive occasion to those who were fortunate enough to be able toattend.Tesla arranged to give a lecture before the Institution of Electrical Engineersin London on February 3, 1892, and one before the International Society ofEngineers in Paris on February nineteenth. His decision to give the Europeanlectures was influenced to some extent by the fact that they would afford him anopportunity to visit his home in Gospic, for recent letters had indicated thathis mother’s health was failing.The lecture before the Institution of Electrical Engineers was a great success.English engineering journals, as will be seen, had been niggardly in extendingrecognition to Tesla for priority in the discovery of the rotating magneticfield, and had belittled the practical value of his polyphasealternating-current system, but in this attitude they were not representative ofthe great body of engineers, who were most generous in their praise andenthusiasm; and the attitude of the engineers was shared by the Englishscientists.When Tesla arrived in London he was entertained at many places by famous men. Atthe Royal Institution, where the immortal Michael Faraday had carried on hisfundamental researches in magnetism and electricity, Sir James Dewar, and acommittee of equally famous scientists, sought to prevail upon Tesla to repeathis lecture before that organization. Tesla could be plain stubborn in stickingto his plans, and in this case was exhibiting his usual firmness. The famousScottish scientist matched Tesla’s stubbornness with an equal persuasivepersistence. He escorted Tesla to Faraday’s chair, an almost sacred relic toEnglish science, seated him in this throne, and then brought out an almostequally precious heirloom, a portion of a bottle of whiskey, the remainder ofFaraday’s personal supply, untouched for nearly a quarter of a century. Out ofthis he poured a generous half glass for Tesla. Sir James won. Tesla relentedand gave the lecture the following evening.Lord Rayleigh, the eminent English physicist, was chairman of the meeting at theRoyal Institution, which was attended by the élite of the scientific world and agenerous representation of the nobility of the realm. Rayleigh, after witnessingthe performance of Tesla’s experiments, which were none the less awe inspiringto scientists than to laymen, showered words of praise on the inventor.Rayleigh declared that Tesla possessed a great gift for the discovery offundamental scientific principles, and urged that he concentrate his efforts onsome one big idea.Tesla, in his conversation after the meeting, disclaimed ability as a greatdiscoverer; but in this he was merely being modest, for he knew that he wasunique among men in his ability to discover fundamental truths. He did, however,give very serious consideration to Rayleigh’s suggestion that he concentrate onsome one big idea. It is doubtful, however, whether Rayleigh’s suggestion wasgood advice. Tesla’s mind had a range that was cosmic in magnitude and adjustedto broad slashing advances through unknown regions. Rayleigh’s advice was likesuggesting to an explorer who had unique ability for penetrating an unknowncontinent and opening it to civilization that he settle down and cultivate ahomestead, since that would give more definite and specific returns for effortsexpended.Two weeks later Tesla gave his scheduled lecture before the Physical Society inParis and repeated it before the International Society of Electrical Engineers.This was his second visit to Paris since he had quit his job with theContinental Edison Company in that city eight years before. Immediately afterleaving the Westinghouse Company in the autumn of 1889—at which time, too, hecompleted his U. S. citizenship requirements—he had made a brief visit to Paristo attend the International Exposition. In the meantime, the fame of hispolyphase system had spread to Europe; and to this was added the glory for hisspectacular work with the new high-frequency currents. He was given a hero’sreception in Paris, as well as in London.It would be interesting to know what thoughts passed through the minds of theexecutives of the Continental Edison Company as they observed the tremendouscontributions to science and industry by the engineer whose services they hadlost through their penny-wise tactics when they were offered in 1883, and couldundoubtedly have purchased for a relatively small amount, the polyphase systemfor which Westinghouse paid Tesla $1,000,000 five years later.A TESLA lecture was an avalanche of new and fascinating electrical knowledge. Hecompletely overwhelmed his listeners with a wealth of spectacular originalexperiments, and as a result almost every individual contribution lost itsidentity in the dazzling concentration of the whole galaxy of startlingdevelopments.In the 1892 lectures, entitled “Experiments with Alternating Currents of HighPotential and High Frequency,” Tesla described many of his discoveries which areonly coming into general use today and are being hailed as modern inventions.Among these are the “neon” and other gas-filled lamps, and phosphorescent lamps.Many of the discoveries described are still unutilized, including, as will beseen, the carbon or metallic-button incandescent lamp, requiring but a singlewire connection; and still others, which he later discovered, were richproducers of the mysterious X-rays.The transcript of these lectures runs to 40,000 words. Scores of pieces ofapparatus were used and usually several experiments were performed with each. Hedescribed “wireless” lamps, glowing glass tubes that required no wire connectionfor their operation. He described motors which operated on one wire, and“wireless” or “no wire” motors. But perhaps the most important development hedescribed was the sensitive electronic tube—the original of all our modern radioand other electronic tubes—which, he predicted, was the device that would permitreceiving wireless telegraph messages across the Atlantic. Of all thesediscoveries we shall presently have more to say in detail.It had been Tesla’s intention to make a short visit to his early home in Gospicwhen his lectures were out of the way, but circumstances forced him to make thetrip sooner than he expected. Returning to his hotel after delivering the secondParis lecture, he received word that his mother was gravely ill. He rushed tothe railroad station, arriving in time to board a train just about to pull out.He telegraphed ahead for special transportation facilities to shorten his trip,and succeeded in reaching Gospic in time to see his mother alive. He arrived inthe afternoon and she died that night.The great anxiety from which Tesla suffered during his sleepless rush from Paristo Gospic caused a patch of hair on the right side of his head to turn whiteover night. Within a month its jet black color was restored naturally.Almost immediately after his mother’s death, Tesla contracted an illness whichincapacitated him for many weeks. When he recovered, he visited his sisterMarica, in Plaski, for two weeks. From there he went to Belgrade, the capital ofSerbia, where he arrived in May and was received as a national hero.During the weeks of enforced physical inactivity imposed on him by his illness,Tesla took stock of himself and became thoroughly dissatisfied with the mannerin which he had been conducting his life. No human being could feel anything buta pleasurable reaction in response to the adulation that had been heaped uponhim during the past two years. Tesla, however, prided himself upon his wisdom inhaving so designed his life that he would not become a victim of humanfrailties, but would function far above the normal human level of physicallimitations and intellectual activities. Now Tesla saw, in retrospect, thatinsofar as he had adhered to his superman plan of life, he had succeeded inachieving his goal of producing the works of a superman at a rate whichastounded the world. When, however, he submitted to the first blandishments ofthe lion hunters after his New York lecture in May, 1891, he observed, socialactivities had cut into his available time and had interfered with his creativeactivities. He had let the “man magnificent” supersede his “superman,” and twoyears of valuable time had been largely lost. In addition, he had spent thattotally unproductive year at the Westinghouse plant. At the close of thatperiod, he had vowed he would never again work for anyone. He now vowed that hewould put an end to the vacuous social activities into which he had beeninveigled.It was not easy for Tesla to live up to his good resolutions, for his Europeantrip had greatly enhanced his fame and triumphant celebrations were scheduled onhis reappearance in New York. Nevertheless, he rejected all invitations. Hereturned to the Hotel Gerlach, where he lived a solitary existence. With apent-up reserve of physical energy owing to his long abstinence from his heavydaily routine of work, he plunged with great vigor into his new program whichwas to open up new and enchanting realms of scientific wonders.SEVENimage [images/00003.jpg] THE first public application of Tesla’s polyphase alternating-current system wasmade at the Chicago World’s Fair, the Columbian Exposition, which opened in 1893to celebrate the four-hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America. Thiswas the first world’s fair for which electric lighting was a possibility, andthe architects availed themselves of the opportunities it afforded for obtainingspectacular effects in illuminating the grounds and buildings at night, as wellas for interior lighting during the day. The Westinghouse Electric Companysecured the contract for installing all power and lighting equipment at theFair, and took full advantage of this opportunity to use the Tesla system anddemonstrate its great versatility. It supplied all the current used for lightingand power.While the Chicago World’s Fair was in reality a monument to Tesla, he had, inaddition, a personal exhibition in which he demonstrated his most recentinventions. One of his exhibits was a spinning egg, made of metal. The egg wasshown lying on top of a small velvet-covered circular platform. When Teslaclosed a switch the egg stood on its small end and rotated at a high speed as ifby magic. The “magic” phase of this feat appealed to a public which, however,grasped little of the explanation that it illustrated the principle of therotating magnetic field produced by the polyphase alternating currents. In otherof his exhibits, glass tubes suspended in space or held in his hands lighted upin an equally “magical” fashion.But his most spectacular feat was to let 1,000,000 volts pass through his body.This was alternating current of very high frequency as well as high voltage. Hehad discovered means of producing such currents. Eight years had passed sinceEdison, attacking high-voltage alternating current as deadly, had refused tobecome interested in Tesla’s polyphase system. Now the Tesla system wasproviding the electricity for the great world’s fair and the Edisondirect-current system was ignored. The final gesture of victory was for Tesla toanswer Edison’s charge that alternating current was deadly by passing thehighest voltage of it ever produced through his own body for many minuteswithout the slightest sign of harm. This bit of showmanship endeared Tesla tothe public and brought him a tremendous burst of world-wide fame. Unfortunately,however, it obscured his more important work with polyphase currents.The next great achievement to be attained by his polyphase system was theharnessing of Niagara Falls.* In 1886 a charter had been granted Cor developingpower at the Falls. The project made slow progress and was taken over by a NewYork group which organized the Cataract Construction Company, of which EdwardDean Adams was made president. Mr. Adams’ company desired to develop power onthe largest scale possible. The total energy supply available in the Falls hadbeen variously estimated from 4,000,000 to 9,000,000 horsepower. Mr. Adamsorganized the International Niagara Commission for the purpose of ascertainingthe best means of harnessing the Falls, and made Lord Kelvin, the famous Englishscientist, its chairman. A prize of $3,000 was offered for the most practicalplan submitted.Tesla had predicted nearly thirty years before, as a boy, that he would somedayharness Niagara Falls. Here was the opportunity. In the meantime, he had made itpossible to fulfil his boyhood boast by completing the series of inventionswhich made it possible to change the hydraulic power of the Falls intoelectrical energy.The prize-offer plan adopted by Mr. Adams did not, however, set well with Mr.Westinghouse when he was urged to submit a proposal. He replied, “These peopleare trying to get one hundred thousand dollars’ worth of information for threethousand dollars. When they are ready to talk business we will submit ourplans.” This adamant attitude of Westinghouse was one handicap for the Teslaalternating-current plan. The second big handicap was the fact that Lord Kelvinhad declared himself in favor of the use of direct current.About twenty plans were submitted in the contest but none of them was acceptedby the commission, and no prize was awarded. The big electrical companies,Westinghouse, Edison General Electric and Thomson-Houston, did not submit plans.This took place in 1890.Original developers of the Falls planned to use locally the mechanical powerprovided by water wheels; but the only practical plan was, clearly, thegeneration of electricity by dynamos driven by water wheels, and thedistribution of the current throughout the district. There was a good additionalmarket for it at Buffalo, a large industrial city about twenty-two milesdistant. There was always the hope, too, that the current could be transmittedto New York City and serve the rich intervening territory. If direct currentwere used, its transmission twenty-two miles to Buffalo was totally unfeasible.The Tesla alternating-current system, however, made the transmission to Buffaloextremely practicable and the delivery of the current to New York City apossibility.In due time the Cataract Construction Company decided that the hydroelectricsystem was the only feasible one, and proposals and bids were asked on a powersystem consisting of three generating units, each of 5,000 horsepower, from theWestinghouse Electric Company and the General Electric Company. Each onesubmitted a proposal to install a Tesla polyphase generating system. The GeneralElectric Company, successor to the Edison General Electric Company, having inthe meantime secured a license to use the Tesla patents, proposed to install athree-phase system, and Westinghouse a two-phase system. The first proposalconcerned the building of the powerhouse. A second proposal on which bids wereasked concerned the transmission line between Niagara Falls and Buffalo and adistribution system in the latter city.Bids were asked for early in 1893, and in October of that year Mr. Adamsannounced that the Westinghouse plan for the powerhouse and the General Electricplan for the transmission line were accepted. The latter included atransformation of the two-phase current from the generators into three-phasecurrent to be transmitted to Buffalo. This change indicated the flexibility ofthe Tesla polyphase system.Westinghouse completed the powerhouse and in 1895 it stood ready to deliver15,000 horsepower; the most gigantic piece of electrical engineering conceivedor accomplished up to that time. In 1896 General Electric completed thetransmission and distribution system, and electrical power extracted fromNiagara Falls, without in any way impairing the beauty of the spectacle theypresented, was delivered to industries through the Falls and Buffalo areas. Sosuccessful was this installation that the Westinghouse Company installed sevenadditional generating units, bringing the output to 50,000 horsepower. A secondequivalent powerhouse, also using alternating current, was later built by theGeneral Electric Company. Today, the powerhouses at Niagara Falls are linkeddirectly with the electric power system in New York City, all using the Teslasystem.Dr. Charles F. Scott, Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering at YaleUniversity, and former president of the American Institute of ElectricalEngineers, who was a Westinghouse engineer when that company was developing theTesla system, in a memorial review of Tesla’s accomplishments, * describes theNiagara development and its results:The simultaneous development of the Niagara project and the Tesla system was afortuitous coincidence. No adequate method of handling large power was availablein 1890; but while the hydraulic tunnel was under construction, the developmentof polyphase apparatus justified the official decision of May 6, 1893, fiveyears and five days after the issuing of Tesla’s patents, to use his system. Thepolyphase method brought success to the Niagara project; and reciprocallyNiagara brought immediate prestige to the new electric system.Power was delivered in August 1895 to the first customer, the PittsburghReduction Company (now Aluminum Company of America) for producing aluminum bythe Hall process, patented in the eventful year 1886….In 1896 transmission from Niagara Falls to Buffalo, 22 miles, was inaugurated.Compare this gigantic and universal system capable of uniting many power sourcesin a superpower system, with the multiplicity of Lilliputian “systems” whichpreviously supplied electrical service. As Mr. Adams aptly explained: “Formerlythe various kinds of current required by different kinds of lamps and motorswere generated locally; by the Niagara-Tesla system only one kind of current isgenerated, to be transmitted to places of use and then changed to the desiredform.”The Niagara demonstration of current for all purposes from large generators ledimmediately to similar power systems in New York City—for the elevated andstreet railways and for the subway; for steam railway electrification; and forthe Edison systems, either by operating substations for converting alternatingcurrent to direct current or by changing completely to A. C. service.The culminating year 1896 inaugurated two far reaching developments for theextension of polyphase power, one commercial and one engineering. By exchange ofpatent rights, the General Electric Company obtained license rights under Teslapatents, later made impregnable by nearly a score of court decisions. Also theParsons turbine, accompanied by its foremost engineer, was transplanted toAmerica and enabled George Westinghouse to bring to fruition by a new method theideal of his first patent, a “rotary steam engine.” The acme of thereciprocating engine came in the early 1900s; a century’s development producedthe great engines that drove 5,000 to 7,500 kilowatt alternators for New York’selevated and subway. But the rapidly growing steam turbine of different typessoon doomed the engine to obsolescence; single units with the capacity of ascore of the largest engines are now supplying power to the metropolis. Singlepowerhouses now supply more power than all of the thousands of central stationsand isolated plants of 1890.Prof. Scott concludes: “The evolution of electric power from the discovery ofFaraday in 1831 to the initial great installation of the Tesla polyphase systemin 1896 is undoubtedly the most tremendous event in all engineering history.”Lord Kelvin, who had originally favored direct current for Niagara, laterconceded, but only after the system was in operation, that alternating currenthad many more advantages for long-distance distribution systems, and declared,“Tesla has contributed more to electrical science than any man up to his time.”THERE should never have been the slightest shadow of doubt concerning the creditdue to Tesla not only for discovering the rotating magnetic field but also forinventing the first practical alternating-current motor, the polyphase system ofalternating currents, dynamos for generating them, a variety of motors forconverting the currents into power, a system of polyphase transformers forraising and lowering voltages, and economical methods for transmittingelectrical power for long distances. Nevertheless, credit for priority hasunjustly been given to and taken by others. Tesla succeeded in establishing hisclaims; but in the meantime, however, damage was done by raising these unfairclaims, and to this day the electrical engineering profession, and publicservice and major electrical industries, have never extended to Tesla the creditto which he is entitled. If they had done so, the name of Tesla would carry atleast as much fame as the names Edison and Westinghouse.Tesla, as we have seen, made his rotating magnetic field invention in 1882, andwithin two months evolved the complete power system, including all the apparatuswhich he later patented. In 1883 he described his invention to officials of theContinental Edison Company. In 1884 he demonstrated his motor to the mayor ofStrassburg and others. In this same year he described the invention to Thomas A.Edison. In 1885 he sought to have the promoters of the Tesla Arc Light Companydevelop his system. In 1887 he secured financial backing and built a series ofthe dynamos and motors which were tested by Prof. Anthony of Cornell University.On October 12, 1887, the first patent applications covering his basic inventionswere revealed to the Patent Office. The patents were granted on various dates inthe early months of 1888. On May 16, 1888, he presented a demonstration anddescription of his basic inventions before the American Institute of ElectricalEngineers in New York. So much for the record.The first complication arose when Prof. Galileo Ferraris, a physicist in theUniversity of Turin, presented a paper on “Rotazioni elettrodynamiche”(Electrodynamic Rotation) before the Turin Academy in March, 1888. This was sixyears after Tesla made his discovery, five years after he demonstrated his motorand six months after he had applied for patents on his system. Prof. Ferrarishad been carrying on researches in the field of optics. The problem thatparticularly interested him was polarized light. In this period it wasconsidered necessary to build mechanical models to demonstrate all scientificprinciples. It was not very difficult to devise models to demonstrate the natureof plane-polarized light, but circularly polarized light presented a moredifficult problem.Prof. Ferraris gave some thought to this problem in 1885, but made no progressuntil 1888 when he turned to alternating currents for a solution. In that periodlight was erroneously thought of as a continuously undulating wave in the ether.Prof. Ferraris took the continuously alternating current as an analogue of theplane-polarized light wave. For a mechanical analogue of the circularlypolarized light wave he visualized a second train of waves 90 degrees out ofstep with the first, giving a right-angle vector to the component that shouldmanifest itself by rotation. This paralleled the solution at which Tesla hadarrived six years earlier.In arranging a laboratory demonstration Prof. Ferraris used a copper cylindersuspended on a thread to represent the light waves, and caused two magneticfields to operate on it at right angles to each other. When the currents wereturned on, the cylinder rotated, wound up the thread on which it was suspendedand raised itself. This was an excellent model of rotary polarized light waves.The model bore no resemblance to a motor, nor did the Turin scientist have anyintention that it should be so considered. It was a laboratory demonstration inoptics, using an electrical analogy.Prof. Ferraris’ next experiment mounted the copper cylinder on a shaft anddivided each of his two coils into two parts, placing one on either side of thecopper cylinder. The device worked up to a speed of 900 revolutions perminute—and beyond this point lost power so rapidly it ceased to operateentirely. He tried iron cylinders but they did not work nearly so well as thecopper ones. Prof. Ferraris predicted no future for the device as a powersource, but he did predict if would find usefulness as the operating principlefor a meter for measuring current.Prof. Ferraris thus demonstrated that he failed by a wide margin to grasp theprinciple which Tesla developed. The Italian scientist found that the use of themagnetic iron cylinder interfered with the operations of his device, whereasTesla, following the correct theory, utilized iron cores for the magnetic fieldof his motor, used an iron armature, and obtained an efficiency of about 95 percent in his first motor, which had a rating of about a quarter horsepower. Theefficiency of Ferraris’device was less than 25 per cent.It was Prof. Ferraris’ belief that he had performed an important service toscience by demonstrating that the rotating magnetic field could not be used onany practical basis for producing mechanical power from alternating current. Henever deviated from this conclusion, nor did he ever claim that he hadanticipated Tesla’s discovery of a practical means for utilizing the rotatingfield for producing power. Knowing that his process was entirely different fromTesla’s, he never advanced a claim to independent discovery of thealternating-current motor. He even conceded that Tesla had arrived at hisdiscovery of the rotating magnetic field entirely independently of him, and thatTesla could not in any way have known of his work before publication.A description of Prof. Ferraris’ experiments, however, was published in TheElectrician, in London, May 25, 1888 (page 86). This was accompanied by thestatement:Whether the apparatus devised by Prof. Ferraris will lead to the discovery of analternating current motor is a question we do not pretend to prophesy, but asthe principle involved may also have other applications, notably in theconstruction of meters for measuring the supply of electricity…A year before this time Prof. Anthony had already tested Tesla’salternating-current motors in the United States and reported that they attainedan order of efficiency equal to that of direct-current motors; and Tesla’s U. S.patents had been publicly announced several months previously.It was obvious that the editors of this London publication were not keeping upto date on developments in the United States.Tesla responded quickly, informing the editors of their oversight and submittingan article describing his motors and the results obtained with them.No great enthusiasm was exhibited by the editors of The Electrician. Theyreceded to only the least possible extent from their stand in favor of Ferrarisby publishing an editorial note: *Our issue of the 25th of May contained an abstract of a paper by Prof. GalileoFerraris describing a method of producing a revolving resultant magnetic fieldby means of a pair of coils with the axes at right angles and traversed byalternating currents, and we drew attention to the possibility that theprinciple of the apparatus might be applied to the construction of analternating current motor. The paper by Mr. Nikola Tesla, which appears in ourcolumns this week, contains a description of such a motor, founded on exactlythe same principle.No attention was drawn to the fact that Ferraris had reached the conclusion thatthe principle could never be used for making a practical motor, whereas Teslahad produced such a motor.This attitude toward the American development did not disappear from the Londonengineering journals. Later the Electrical Review † published an editorial whichopened with the statement:For several years past, from the days of Prof. Ferraris’ investigations, whichwere followed by those of Tesla and Zipernowski and a host of imitators, we haveperiodically heard of the question of alternating current motors being solved.At this time the Westinghouse Company was already commercially exploiting thesuccessful and practical Tesla polyphase system in the United States. Not oneword of credit to Tesla appeared in the London engineering press.A letter of protest dated March 17, 1891, was forwarded by Tesla, and this waspublished some weeks later (p. 446) by the Review. He said in part:In all civilized countries patents have been obtained almost without a singlereference to anything which would have in the least degree rendered questionablethe novelty of the invention. The first published essay—an account of somelaboratory experiments by Prof. Ferraris—was published in Italy six or sevenmonths after the date of filing my application for the foundation patents…. Yetin your issue of March 6, I read: “For several years past, from the days ofProf. Ferraris’ investigations, which were followed by those of Tesla andZipernowski and a host of imitators, we have periodically heard of the questionof alternating current motors being solved.”No one can say that I have not been free in acknowledging the merit of Prof.Ferraris, and I hope that my statement of facts will not be misinterpreted. Evenif Prof. Ferraris’ essay would have anticipated the date of filing of myapplication, yet, in the opinion of all fair minded men, I would have beenentitled to the credit of having been the first to produce a practical motor;for Prof. Ferraris denies in his essay the value of the invention for thetransmission of power….Thus in the most essential features of the system—the generators with two orthree currents of differing phase, the three wire system, the closed coilarmature, the motors with direct current in the field, etc.,—I would standalone, even had Prof. Ferraris’essay been published many years ago….Most of these facts, if not all, are perfectly well known in England; yetaccording to some papers, one of the leading English electricians does nothesitate to say that I have worked in the direction indicated by Prof. Ferraris,and in your issue above referred to it seems I am called an imitator.Now, I ask you where is that well known English fairness. I am a pioneer and Iam called an imitator. I am hot an imitator. I produce original work or none atall.This letter was published; but the Electrical Review neither expressed regretfor the misstatement nor extended recognition to Tesla.Charles Proteus Steinmetz, later to achieve fame as the electrical wizard of theGeneral Electric Company, came to the support of Tesla. In a paper presentedbefore the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, he said: * “Ferrarisbuilt only a little toy, and his magnetic circuits, so far as I know, werecompleted in air, not in iron, though that hardly makes any difference.”Other American engineers likewise rallied to Tesla’s support.An industrial exposition, as already mentioned, was held at Frankfurt, Germany,in 1891. The United States Navy sent Carl Hering, an electrical engineer who haddone much writing for technical journals, as observer to report on anydevelopments that would be of interest to the Navy. Hering, unfortunately, hadnot informed himself of the inventions embodied in the Tesla patents beforegoing abroad.The outstanding new development at the Frankfurt exposition was the first publicapplication of Tesla’s system. The grounds and building were lighted byelectricity brought to the city by a long-distance transmission line over whichelectricity was carried from the hydroelectric station at Lauffen by three-phasealternating current carried at 30,000 volts. There was exhibited atwo-horsepower motor operated by the three-phase current.Hering recognized the significance of the new development, and sent backenthusiastic reports describing it as of German origin. In his article in theElectrical World (N.Y. ), he waxed enthusiastic about the work of DolivoDobrowolsky in designing the three-phase motor and its associated system,hailing it as an outstanding scientific discovery and of tremendous commercialimportance. The impression was given that all other inventors had missed themain point, and that Dobrowolsky had achieved the grand broad accomplishmentthat would set the pace for future power developments. Nor was Hering the onlyone to whom this impression was communicated.Ludwig Gutman, an American electrical engineer, a delegate to the FrankfurtElectrical Congress, in a paper on “The Inventor of the Rotary Field System.”delivered before that body, * slammed back at Dobrowolsky. He stated:As we have enjoyed in America several years’ experience with this systemrepresented by the Tesla motors I must oppose the assertion lately made by Herrvon Dobrowolsky at a meeting of the Electrotechnische Gesellschaft held here inFrankfurt. The gentleman said; “I believe I am able to assert that the motorproblem for large and small works has been by this completely solved.” Thisassertion goes most likely too for. The problem was already solved,theoretically and electrically, in 1889.Dobrowolsky, in a paper published in the Electrotechnische Zeitschrift (p.149-150; 1891), reduced his claim to that of having produced the first practicalalternating-current motor; and he asserted that in the Tesla two-phase motorthere were field pulsations amounting to 40 per cent, while in his three-phasemotor, in operation at the Frankfurt exposition, these were greatly reduced.Even this reduced claim of Dobrowolsky’s was quickly smashed. It drew fire froman American and an English source, and also from the chief engineer of theproject of which his motor was a part.Dr. Michael I. Pupin, of the Department of Engineering, Columbia University,analyzing Dobrowolsky’s claim, † demonstrated that he had failed to comprehendthe basic principles of the Tesla system, and that the three-phase system whichhe claimed as his own was included in Tesla’s inventions.C. E. L. Brown, the engineer in charge of the pioneering Lauffen-Frankfurt30,000-volt transmission system and its three-phase generating system, includingthe Dobrowolsky motor, settled definitely and completely the question of creditfor the whole system. In a letter published in the Electrical World (Nov. 7,1891), he concluded with the statement: “The three phase current as applied atFrankfurt is due to the labors of Mr. Tesla and will be found clearly specifiedin his patents.”Mr. Brown wrote letters to other technical publications to this same effect, andin them criticized Mr. Hering for failing to give Tesla his due credit, and fordiverting it to Dobrowolsky.These criticisms finally brought a response from Mr. Hering. This appeared inthe Electrical World, Feb. 6, 1892:As Mr. C. E. L. Brown, in communications to the Electrical World and otherjournals, seems determined to insist that I have neglected the work of Mr. Teslaon rotary current I wish to state there is no one more willing than myself togive Mr. Tesla due credit for his work, and I have always considered him to bean original inventor of the rotary field system and first to reduce it topractice, and I believe I so stated in my articles. If I have at any time failedto give him credit for the extent to which he developed it, it has been becauseMr. Tesla has been too modest (or perhaps prudent) to let the world know what hehas accomplished. When the articles which have caused this discussion were beingwritten Mr. Tesla’s patents were not accessible to me. Just where Mr.Dobrowolsky’s improvements begin I have not been able to ascertain….Dobrowolsky, though he may have been an independent inventor, admits Tesla’swork is prior to his…. The modesty of both of these gentlemen would, I feelsure, lead to a clear understanding. Regarding the subject of priority it may beof interest here to say that in a conversation with Prof. Ferraris last summerthat gentleman told me with very becoming modesty that, although he hadexperimented with the rotary field several years before Tesla’s work waspublished he did not think it was possible that Tesla could have known of hiswork and he therefore believed Tesla invented it entirely independently. He alsostated that Tesla developed it much further than he (Ferraris) did.Thus the scientists and engineers in the United States, Germany and Italy gaveTesla clear and unquestioned credit for being the sole inventor of themagnificent polyphase electrical system in all of its details. French andBritish journals then fell in line.Thus, by 1892, there was universal acclaim for Tesla as the unquestionedinventor of the alternating-current motor and the polyphase system inengineering circles. There was none, therefore, to dispute his claim or to seekto rob him of credit when his fame reached the public through the operation ofhis system at the World’s Fair in Chicago in 1893, and later when his systemmade possible the harnessing of Niagara Falls.In due time, however, there came many who claimed to have made improvements onTesla’s inventions; and widespread efforts were made to exploit these“improvements.” The Westing-house Company, now owners of the Tesla patents,undertook to defend the patents and to prosecute infringers. As a result abouttwenty suits were carried to the courts, and, in every one of them, decisionsgave a decisive victory to Tesla.A sample of the sweeping decisions that were handed down is that of JudgeTownsend in the United States Circuit Court of Connecticut in September, 1900,when, passing judgment on the first group of basic patents, he said in part:It remained to the genius of Tesla to capture the unruly, unrestrained andhitherto opposing elements in the field of nature and art and to harness them todraw the machines of man. It was he who first showed how to transform the toy ofArago into an engine of power; the “laboratory experiment” of Bailey into apractically successful motor; the indicator into a driver; he first conceivedthe idea that the very impediments of reversal in direction, thecontraindications of alternations might be transformed into power-producingrotations, a whirling field of force.What others looked upon as only invincible barriers, impassable currents andcontradictory forces he seized, and by harmonizing their directions utilized inpractical motors in distant cities the power of Niagara.The resentments and antagonisms engendered by the unvarying series of successfuldecisions caused individuals who were adversely affected to vent theirantagonisms on Tesla although he had not in ten years held any personalinterests in the patents.The situation that developed is well described by B. A. Behrend, latervice-president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers: *It is a peculiar trait of ignorant men to go always from one extreme to another,and those who were once the blind admirers of Mr. Tesla, exalting him to anextent which can be likened only to the infatuated praise bestowed on victims ofpopular admiration, are now eagerly engaged in his derision. There is somethingdeeply melancholy in the prospect, and I can never think of Nikola Tesla withoutwanning up to my subject and condemning the injustice and ingratitude which hehas received alike at the hands of the public and of the engineering profession.With the scientific and engineering worlds, and the courts, extending to him aclear title to the honor of being the great pioneer discoverer and inventor ofthe principles and machines that created the modern electrical system, Teslastands without a rival as the genius who gave the world the electrical power agethat made our mass-production industrial system possible. The name Tesla should,therefore, in all right and justice, be the most famous name in the engineeringworld today.* Before this was done, and even before the opening of the Chicago fair, thepracticability of his system was demonstrated in Europe; but this had beenundertaken without his knowledge. A practical test of the transmission ofpolyphase alternating currents at 30,000 volts was made between a hydroelectricstation at Lauffen and the City of Frankfurt, the current being used to furnishelectricity at a fair held at the latter city. This installation was built in1891. The current was used to light incandescent and arc lamps and also tooperate a Tesla motor.* Published In Electrical Engineering, August 1943, pp. 351-355.* Vol. XX, p. 165, June 15, 1888.† London: Vol. XXVIII, p. 291, March 6, 1891.* Transactions, A.

He made repeated experiments in working out the refinementof his principle of tuning circuits to resonance with each other. He built morethan one hundred coils covering a wide range of electrical tuningcharacteristics. He also built numerous oscillators for producing high-frequencycurrents, and condensers and inductances for tuning both sending and receivingcoils to any desired frequency or wavelength.He demonstrated that he could cause any one of hundreds of coils to respondselectively and powerfully to its particular wavelength emitted by an oscillatorwhile all others remained inert; but he discovered that tuned electrical coilshave, to a further extent, the same properties as tuned musical string, in thatthey vibrate not only to the fundamental note but also to a wide range of upper,and particularly lower, harmonics. This characteristic could be usefullyemployed in connection with the design of sending-and receiving-stationantennas, but it militated against the sharp, exclusive response tuning ofcoils. At close range, and with the powerful currents Tesla used in hislaboratory, the harmonics were a handicap—yet when greater distance separatedsending and receiving coils, this trouble became a minor one.It became obvious to Tesla that it was going to be difficult to arrange an earlydemonstration of his worldwide system of intelligence and of power, so heplanned a compromise system in which he would use a smaller central transmitterand smaller relay stations at certain distances.In an interview with Arthur Brisbane, the famous editor, Tesla announced in TheWorld of July 22, 1894, the certainty of his plans. He said:You would think me a dreamer and very far gone if I should tell you what Ireally hope for. But I can tell you that I look forward with absolute confidenceto sending messages through the earth without any wires. I have also great hopesof transmitting electric force in the same way without waste. Concerning thetransmission of messages through the earth I have no hesitation in predictingsuccess. I must first ascertain exactly how many vibrations to the second arecaused by disturbing the mass of electricity which the earth contains. Mymachine for transmitting must vibrate as often to put itself in accord with theelectricity in the earth.During the following winter he designed and built his transmitting station and areceiving station for this purpose. It worked well within the close range of thelaboratory and between points in the city. Like the artist who is never willingto declare a picture finished but must continue to apply an unending series ofslight improvements, Tesla continued to add refinements so that he would beassured of a perfect test in the spring, when he planned to take his receivingset up the Hudson River on a small boat to test its response at extendeddistances.With Tesla, as with Cæsar, though, came tragedy on the Ides of March. For Teslait was the unlucky 13th of March, 1895, when fire broke out during the night inthe lower part of the building in which his laboratory was located and sweptthrough the entire structure. The two floors on which his equipment was locateddropped to the basement, their entire contents destroyed. Not a single articlewas saved. The major portion of Tesla’s fortune was invested in the apparatus inthat building. He carried no insurance on it. The loss was total.The monetary loss was the least important factor in the shock which Teslasustained. The apparatus and the countless experiments in scores of subjectswith which they were associated were part of Tesla’s self. His work of alifetime was swept away. All of his records, papers, mementos, his famousWorld’s Fair exhibit were gone. His laboratory, in which he had demonstrated hiswonders to the élite and intelligentsia of New York, to the most famous men andwomen of the country and the world, was no more. And this tragedy had come justwhen he was ready to make his first distance demonstration of his wirelesssystem.Tesla was in a tough spot financially. The laboratory was the property of theTesla Electric Company, owned by Tesla and A. K. Brown who had, with anassociate, put up the funds to finance Tesla’s demonstration of his polyphasealternating-current system prior to its sale to Westinghouse for $1,000,000.Some of that money was divided as cash among the associates, as stated; and theremainder had gone into the laboratory for further developments. The resourcesof the company were now wiped out and Tesla’s individual resources were almostat the vanishing point. He was receiving some patent royalties from Germany onhis polyphase motors and dynamos. This income would be adequate to take care ofhis living expenses but not sufficient to enable him to maintain an experimentallaboratory.Mr. Adams, active head of the Morgan group that had developed the hydroelectricstation at Niagara Falls, using Tesla’s polyphase system, now came to theinventor’s rescue. He proposed and arranged for the formation of a new companywhich would finance the continuation of Tesla’s experiments, and he offered tosubscribe one hundred thousand dollars of the proposed half-million dollars ofcapital stock of the company.With this support Tesla proceeded to set up a new laboratory. He securedquarters at 46 East Houston Street, and started operations there in July, 1895,four months after his South Fifth Avenue laboratory had been destroyed.Adams paid forty thousand dollars as the first installment of his subscription.He took an active personal interest in Tesla’s work, and spent a great deal oftime in the laboratory. Knowing from the successful operation of the NiagaraFalls plant that Tesla, technically, was extremely practical, Adams was deeplyimpressed by the plans for wireless transmission of intelligence and of power.He declared he was willing to go still further than his original plan offinancial support, and he proposed that the plan include the taking in of hisson as an active partner in Tesla’s work.Such an arrangement would amount to an alliance for Tesla with the powerfulMorgan financial group. It was the support of J. P. Morgan that gave financialguidance to the formation of the General Electric Company and made possible thebuilding of the Waterside Station, the first big Edison powerhouse in New York,and it was a Morgan group that, by making possible the development of Niagara,had given the Tesla system a tremendous boost. The prestige that would come froma Morgan association would probably be even more potent than the actual monetaryaid involved. With this alliance Tesla’s financial future was assured. Therewould come to his aid, through it, the support of the world’s greatestorganizational genius and practical promotion powers. The tragedy of the firethat brought about this situation could yet prove a great blessing.Tesla made his decision. What influenced him to reach the determination thatguided him, no one ever learned. He rejected Mr. Adams’offer! From a practicalpoint of view there is no way of explaining his action. But no one could eversuccessfully demonstrate that Tesla was practical in a commercial and financialsense.With the forty thousand dollars that Adams subscribed, Tesla was able to keepactively engaged in research for about three years. He probably could havesecured subscriptions of many times that amount if he had been willing to putforth even a slight effort in that direction, but he was interested mainly ingetting his experiments well under way rather than worrying about futurefinancial needs. He had full faith that the future would bring him many millionsof dollars as a token of the many billions of value he would give it through hisinventions.It took Tesla about a year to get his laboratory equipped and to build an arrayof experimental apparatus. Almost nothing that he used could be purchased in themarket; everything had to be specially made by his workmen under his direction.In the spring of 1897 he was ready to make, on his wireless transmitter andreceiver, the distance tests which had been interrupted by the fire two yearsbefore.The success of these tests were announced by Tesla in an interview with arepresentative of the Electrical Review which was published in the issue of July9, 1897, of that of journal. It stated:Nearly every telegraphic inventor has for years dreamed in his waking hours ofthe possibility of communicating without wires. time to time there has appearedin the technical journals a reference to the experiments showing the almostuniversal belief among electricians that, some day, wires will be done awaywith. Experiments have been made attempting to prove the possibilities, but ithas remained for Mr. Nikola Tesla to advance a theory, and experimentally proveit, that wireless communication is a possibility and by no means a distantpossibility. Indeed, after six years of careful and conscientious work, Mr.Tesla has arrived at a stage where some insight into the future is possible.A representative of the Electrical Review receives the assurance personally fromMr. Tesla who, by the way, is nothing if not conservative, that electricalcommunication without wires is an accomplished fact and that the method employedand the principles involved have nothing in them to prevent messages beingtransmitted and intelligibly received between distant points. Already he hasconstructed both a transmitting apparatus and an electrical receiver which atdistant points is sensitive to the signals of the transmitter, regardless ofearth currents or points of the compass. And this has been done with asurprisingly small expenditure of energy.Naturally, Mr. Tesla is averse to explaining all details of his invention, butallows it to be understood that he avails himself of what, for the present, maybe termed the electrostatic equilibrium; that if this be disturbed at any pointon the earth the disturbance can with proper apparatus be distinguished at adistant point and thus the means of signalling and reading signals becomespracticable once the concrete instruments are available. Mr. Tesla announced hisbelief in the possibilities, but he did so after having satisfied himself byactual test of apparatus designed by him. Much work has yet to be done, and hehas since then given close attention and study to the problem.Details are not yet available, for obvious reasons, and we now merely chronicleMr. Tesla’s statement that he has really accomplished wireless communicationover reasonably long distances with small expenditure of energy and has only toperfect apparatus to go to any extent. Morse’s 40 mile experiment in the olddays was on a far less certain basis than the wireless possibilities of today.Tesla’s work with high frequency and high potential currents has been notable.As long ago as 1891 he foretold the present results, both as to vacuum tubelighting and intercommunication without wires. The former has in his handsassumed a condition capable of a public demonstration of the phenomena of theelectrostatic molecular forces. Numberless experiments were carried out, andfrom what then was a startling frequency of 10,000 per second Mr. Tesla hasadvanced to what now is a moderate rate at 2,000,000 oscillations per second.This announcement recorded the birth of modern radio—radio as it is in usetoday—born on a boat traveling up the Hudson River, carrying the receiving settwenty-five miles from the Houston Street laboratory, a distance which was asmall fraction of the range of the set but enough to demonstrate itscapabilities. Such an accomplishment was worthy of a flamboyant smashannouncement instead of Tesla’s very modest statement and the even moreconservative manner in which the Electrical Review treated the news. Tesla hadto protect not only his patent rights, which would be jeopardized by prematuredisclosure, but also had to be on guard against invention invaders and patentpirates, with whom he had previously had unpleasant experiences. The ElectricalReview, naturally enough, was fearful of the consequences of “sticking its neckout” by too enthusiastic a reception before full details were available.The fundamental patents on Tesla’s system were issued on September 2, 1897, justtwo months after his announcement.They are numbered 645, 576 and 649, 621. In these patents he describes all thefundamental features of the radio broadcasting and receiving circuits in usetoday. Once patent protection was secured, Tesla did not long delay in lettingthe public in on his discoveries. His presentation took the form of aspectacular demonstration at Madison Square Garden.WIRELESS transmission of intelligence is a modern satisfaction of one of theoldest cravings of man, who has always sought the annihilation of distance bycommunication through space without material linkage over the interveningexpanse. Early experimenters with the telephone, particularly, were enthusiasticseekers of a method of wireless electrical communication that would convey thevoice through space in the manner in which the air conducted sound. David EdwardHughes had noted, in 1879, that when an electric spark was produced anywhere inhis house he heard a noise in his telephone receiver. He traced the effect tothe action of the carbon granules in contact with a metal disk in his telephonetransmitter which acted as a detector of the space waves by sticking togetherslightly, reducing the resistance of the mass, and producing a click in thereceiver.Prof. A. E. Dolbear, of Tufts College, amplified this observation and set up, in1882, a demonstration set using the principle but eliminating the telephone set.He used a spark coil for creating waves and a mass of carbon granules fordetecting them. This is exactly the “wireless” system which Marconi “discovered”fourteen years later.Edison, engaged by the Western Union Telegraph Company to break the monopolywhich Bell held by his invention of the telephone, had succeeded, in 1885, insending a message from a moving train by “wireless.” A wire strung on the trainparalleling a telegraph wire strung on poles along the track made it possible tobridge the intervening few feet by an inductive effect—the same effect whichcauses annoyance by creating “cross talk,” or a mixing of conversations over twotelephone circuits located close to each other. W. M. Preece, in England, made asimilar experiment about the same time. The extremely short distances over whichsuch systems worked prevented them from having any practical usefulness.An entirely different type of wireless communication had been developed byAlexander Graham Bell in 1880 and 1881. This was given the name radiophone, butBell insisted on calling it the photophone. The photophone transmitted the voiceover a beam of light. The transmitter consisted of a very thin glass or micamirror, which could be vibrated by the voice. This reflected a beam of light,usually sunlight, to a distant receiving device. The simple receiver consistedof a chemist’s test tube, into which a selected material was placed. The top ofthe tube was closed by a cork through which two small rubber tubes wereinserted, the other ends being placed in the ears. A very great variety ofmaterials could be placed in the test tube as detectors. When the beam of light,vibrated by the voice, impinged on the material in the tube, an absorption ofheat took place which set the air in the tube in vibration, thus reproducing thevoice that was carried by the light beam. Bell also used selenium as a detector.It responded to the visible rays and produced an electrical effect. Theexperiments, obviously, were of little practical value as the basis for a systemof wireless communication.Michael Faraday, in London, had described in 1845 his theory of the relationshipbetween light and the electromagnetic lines of force; and in 1862 James ClerkMaxwell published an analysis of Faraday’s work which gave a mathematical basisfor the theory that light waves were electromagnetic in nature, and that it waspossible for such waves to exist very much shorter and very much longer than theknown wavelength of visible light. This was a challenge to scientists to provethe existence of such waves.Prof. Heinrich Hertz, at Bonn, Germany, from 1886 to 1888, undertook the searchfor the waves longer than light or heat. He produced them by the spark dischargeof an induction coil and recaptured them from space, at short distances, in theform of a tiny spark that jumped the gap in a slotted ring of wire. Sir OliverLodge, in England, was simultaneously seeking to measure equally smallelectrical waves in wire circuits.This, then, had been the situation in the scientific world when Tesla began hiswork in 1889. The plan for wireless communication which he presented in 1892 and1893, as will be described in a moment, shows how his magnificent concept andtremendously advanced knowledge towered mountain high over all contemporaries.When Tesla left the Westinghouse plant in the fall of 1889, he had immediatelyturned to the next phase of his development of the alternating-current field—anew system of distributing energy by means of high-frequency alternatingcurrents which would be a far more magnificent discovery than his polyphasesystem. Within the next two years he had explored the principles by which energycould be distributed broadcast without the use of wires, and these he haddemonstrated with powerful coils in his laboratory. The distribution ofintelligence, later called “wireless,” was but a single phase of the largerproject.Tesla described, in 1892, the first electronic tube designed for use as adetector in a radio system, and demonstrated its characteristics in his lecturesin London and Paris in February and March of that year. (The tube, however, hadbeen developed in 1890.) He described in February and March of the followingyear, 1893, his system of radio broadcasting, presenting its principles indetail, in lectures before the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia and at theconvention of the National Electric Light Association held in St. Louis.Tesla’s electronic tube, his 1890 invention, was the ancestor of the detectingand amplifying tubes in use today. His demonstration of this tube is a matter ofrecord in the archives of four societies before which he exhibited it inFebruary and March of 1892—the Institute of Electrical Engineers and the RoyalSociety of London and the Physical Society of France and the InternationalSociety of Electrical Engineers in Paris. He stated in these lectures:If there is any motion which is measurable going on in space, such a brush oughtto reveal it. It is, so to speak, a beam of light, friction-less, devoid ofinertia.I think it may find practical applications in telegraphy. With such a brush itwould be possible to send dispatches across the Atlantic, for instance, with anyspeed, since its-sensitiveness may be so great the slightest changes will affectit.The “brush” in Tesla’s tube was a beam of electrons. The electron, however, hadnot yet been discovered. Nevertheless, Tesla gave an accurate description of itsnature, demonstrating the remarkable accuracy of his interpretation of strangephenomena. So sensitive was this electronic beam that a small horseshoe magnetan inch wide at a distance of six feet caused movement of the electron beam ineither direction, depending on the position in which the magnet was held.If anyone approached the tube from a distance of many feet the beam, or brush,would swing to the opposite side of the tube. If one walked around the tube evenat a distance of ten feet, the beam would move likewise, keeping its center endalways pointed at the moving object. The slightest movement of a finger, or eventhe tensing of muscle, would bring a swinging response from the beam.In the same 1892 lecture in which he described this first electronic tube, Teslademonstrated lamps which were lighted without wire connections (wireless light)and also a motor which operated without wire connections to the energizing coils(wireless power); and he had again presented these developments at hisexhibition at the Chicago Columbian Exposition early inIt was with all this experience behind him, giving him full assurance that hissystem was entirely practical and operative, that Tesla presented at theFranklin Institute and at the convention of the National Electric LightAssociation in February and March, 1893, a very cautious and conservativestatement concerning his plan. Even at these 1893 lectures, Tesla could havestaged a demonstration of wireless transmission of intelligence by placing oneof his resonant coils, surmounted by one of his electronic “brush” tubes, or oneof his low-pressure air lamps, in the lecture hall and causing it to respond tosignals sent out by an energized coil of similar wavelength but located at aconsiderable distance from the building. The experiment was a standard procedurein his laboratory.This, however, would be a purely local effect, whereas his radio transmissionsystem was one planned on a world-wide basis, requiring much more powerfulapparatus than he had thus far built. To pass off a purely local effect as ademonstration of a world-wide system, even though the observed results wouldhave been identical, would have been a case of intellectual dishonesty to whichTesla would not stoop; yet this demonstration of wireless would have been morespectacular and powerful than any staged by any other inventor in more than ahalf-dozen years following.Describing his world-wide system at the 1893 National Electric Light Associationmeeting, he said:In connection with resonance effects and the problems of transmission of energyover a single conductor, which was previously considered, I would say a fewwords on a subject which constantly fills my thoughts, and which concerns thewelfare of all. I mean the transmission of intelligible signals, or, perhaps,even power, to any distance without the use of wires. I am becoming moreconvinced of the practicability of the scheme; and though I know full well thatthe great majority of scientific men will not believe that such results can bepractically and immediately realized, yet I think that all consider thedevelopments in recent years by a number of workers to have been such as toencourage thought and experiment in this direction. My conviction has grown sostrong that I no longer look upon the plan of energy or intelligencetransmission as a mere theoretical possibility, but as a serious problem inelectrical engineering, which must be carried out some day.The idea of transmitting intelligence without wires is the natural outcome ofthe most recent results of electrical investigations. Some enthusiasts haveexpressed their belief that telephony to any distance by induction through airis possible. I cannot stretch my imagination so far, but I do firmly believethat it is practical to disturb, by means of powerful machines, theelectrostatic conditions of the earth, and thus transmit intelligible signals,and, perhaps, power. In fact, what is there against carrying out such a scheme?We now know that electrical vibrations may be transmitted through a singleconductor. Why then not try to avail ourselves of the earth for this purpose? Weneed not be frightened by the idea of distance. To the weary wanderer countingthe mileposts, the earth may appear very large; but to the happiest of all men,the astronomer, who gazes at the heavens, and by their standards judges themagnitude of our globe, it appears very small. And so I think it must seem tothe electrician; for when he considers the speed with which an electricaldisturbance is propagated through the earth, all his ideas of distance mustcompletely vanish.A point of great importance would be first to know what is the capacity of theearth, and what charge does it contain if electrified. Though we have nopositive evidence of a charged body existing in space without other oppositelyelectrified bodies being near, there is a fair probability that the earth issuch a body, for by whatever process it was separated—and this is the acceptedview of its origin—it must have retained a charge, as occurs in all processes ofmechanical separation….If we can ever ascertain at what period the earth’s charge, when disturbed,oscillates, with respect to an oppositely charged system or known circuit, weshall know a fact possibly of the greatest importance to the welfare of thehuman race. I propose to seek for the period by means of an electricaloscillator or a source of alternating currents.One of the terminals of this source would be connected to the earth, as, forinstance, to the city water mains, the other to an insulated body of largesurface. It is possible that the outer conducting air strata or free spacecontains an opposite charge, and that, together with the earth, they form acondenser of large capacity. In such case the period of vibration may be verylow and an alternating dynamo machine might serve for the purpose of theexperiment. I would then transform the current to a potential as high as itwould be found possible, and connect the ends of the high tension secondary tothe ground and to the insulated body. By varying the frequency of the currentsand carefully observing the potential of the insulated body, and watching forthe disturbance at various neighboring points of the earth’s surface, resonancemight be detected.Should, as the majority of scientific men in all probability believe, the periodbe extremely small, then a dynamo machine would not do, and a proper electricaloscillator would have to be produced, and perhaps it might not be possible toobtain such rapid vibrations. But whether this be possible or not, and whetherthe earth contains a charge or not, and whatever may be its period of vibration,it is certainly possible—for of this we have daily evidence—to produce someelectrical disturbance sufficiently powerful to be perceptible by suitableinstruments at any point on the earth’s surface….Theoretically, then, it could not require a great amount of energy to produce adisturbance perceptible at a great distance, or even all over the surface of theglobe. Now, it is quite certain that at any point within a certain radius of thesources, a properly adjusted self induction and capacity device can be set inaction by resonance. But not only this can be done, but another source, s 1,similar to s, or any number of such sources, can be set to work in synchronismwith the latter, and the vibration thus intensified and spread over a largearea, or a flow of electricity produced to or from source s 1, if the same or ofopposite phase to the source s.I think that, beyond doubt, it is possible to operate electrical devices in acity, through the ground or pipe system, by resonance from an electricaloscillator located at a central point. But the practical solution of thisproblem would be of incomparably smaller benefit to man than the realization ofthe scheme of transmitting intelligence, or, perhaps, power, to any distancethrough the earth or environing medium. If this is at all possible, distancedoes not mean anything. Proper apparatus must first be produced, by means ofwhich the problem can be attacked, and I have devoted much thought to thissubject. I am firmly convinced it can be done, and I hope we shall live to seeit done.The lecture before the Franklin Institute contained a similar statement. Anadditional paragraph from it can be quoted:If by means of powerful machinery, rapid variations of the earth’s potentialwere produced, a grounded wire reaching up to some height would be traversed bya current which could be increased by connecting the free end of the wire to abody of some size…. The experiment, which would be of great scientific interest,would probably best succeed on a ship at sea. In this manner, even if it werenot possible to operate machinery, intelligence might be transmitted quitecertainly.Tesla thus presented in these lectures the principles which he had learned inhis laboratory experiments, during the previous three years, were necessary forsuccessful wireless communication.Several fundamental requirements were presented which will be understood by anynon-technical person who has had even slight experience with radio receivingsets: 1. An antenna, or aerial wire; 2. A ground connection; 3. An aerial-groundcircuit containing inductance and capacity; 4. Adjustable inductance andcapacity (for tuning); 5. Sending and receiving sets tuned to resonance witheach other; and 6. Electronic tube detectors. He had still earlier invented aloud speaker.These embody the fundamental principles of radio, and are used in every sendingand receiving set today.RADIO as it exists today is, therefore, the product of the genius of NikolaTesla. He is the original inventor of the system as a whole and of all theprincipal electrical components. The man who, next to Tesla, is entitled to thegreatest amount of credit is Sir Oliver Lodge, the great English scientist. EvenLodge, however, failed to grasp the fundamental picture that Tesla presented.Lodge, early in 1894, had put a Hertz spark gap in a copper cylinder open at oneend; and in this way he produced a beam of ultra-short-wave oscillations whichcould be transmitted in any direction. He did the same for the receiving set.Since the incoming waves could be received from only one direction, thisreceiving set was able to locate the direction from which the transmitted wavescame. With this set he completely anticipated Marconi by two years. In thesummer of that year, in a demonstratian before the British Association for theAdvancement of Science at Oxford, he sent Morse signals, with an improved set,between two buildings separated by several hundred feet.It is little wonder, then, that Marconi, who started his studies of wireless in1895, created no stir in the scientific circles in England when he came fromItaly to London in 1896 with a wireless set that in every essential feature wasthe same as that demonstrated by Lodge in 1894. He used a parabolic reflector,so his set was little more than an electrical searchlight. He did, however,bring an alternative feature to replace the parabolic beam reflector. This was aground connection and antenna, or aerial wire, for both sending and receivingset. This was exactly what Tesla had described in his plan published three yearsbefore.When Hertz made his experiments to demonstrate the identical nature of light andlonger electromagnetic waves, he intentionally sought to use the shortest wavesit was practicable to produce. They were measured in inches—much less than ayard long. They were entirely satisfactory for his experiment. When the wirelessexperimenters copied his methods they took over the short-wave plan without everasking a question as to what wavelength should be used for wirelesscommunication; the thought seems not to have dawned on them that there wereother wavelengths that could be produced and used—all except Tesla.Tesla took the trouble, with the spirit of a real scientist, to repeat exactlythe experiments of Hertz; and he published his results, stating that he found anumber of important differences and calling attention to the inadequacies ofHertz’s experimental methods.Having experimented with a wide gamut of wavelengths of high-frequency currentsand studied the properties of each section of the spectrum, he knew that theshort wavelengths were totally unsuitable for communication purposes. He knewthat the useful wavelengths ranged from 100 meters to many thousands of meters.He knew that the combination of induction coil and Hertz ball-type spark-gaposcillator could never have any practical usefulness in producing the kind ofelectrical pulsations required. Even with the highly efficient apparatusavailable today, scientists have been unable to use in communication (except forspecial purposes) the ultra-short waves which Tesla in his wisdom condemned andMarconi, owing to his inexperience, tried to use.The history of the succeeding years in wireless is the story of the failure ofthe short waves of Lodge and Marconi and their followers, and the shifting overto the longer waves described by Tesla; and the dropping of their crash methodof signaling and its replacement by the refined and highly efficient method oftuning to each other the sending and receiving stations by the methodsdiscovered by Tesla; and adoption of Tesla’s continuous waves.In addition, these groping workers saw in wireless only a point-to-point orstation-to-station method of signaling. None of them foresaw the broadcastingsystem which Tesla described in 1893. The system invented and discovered byTesla is the one in use today; but who ever heard anyone giving Tesla theslightest credit?NINEimage [images/00003.jpg] TESLA was prolific in opening up vast new empires of knowledge. He showered hisdiscoveries on the world at such a rapid rate and in such a nonchalant mannerthat he seems to have benumbed the minds of the scientists of his age. He wastoo busy to spend time developing the technical or commercial applications ofeach new discovery—there were too many other new and important revelationswithin his vision that must be brought to light. Discoveries were nothappenstance events to him. He visualized them far in advance of their unfoldingin the laboratory. He had a definite program of pioneering research in virginfields of investigation; and when this was accomplished he would, he felt, havea long lifetime still ahead of him in which he could return to the practicalutilization of those already revealed.Meanwhile, he had found a whole new world of interesting effects in thedischarges produced by his coils when energized with the currents of extremelyhigh frequency. He built larger and larger coils and experimented with a varietyof shapes as constructions. From the common cylindrical type of coil hedeveloped the cone-shaped coil, and this development he carried still further bydesigning the flat helix, or pancake-shaped coil.The extremely high-frequency currents furnished a mathematical paradise in whichTesla could develop his equations to his heart’s content. Through hismathematical abilities and his strange power of visualization he couldfrequently make, very quickly, whole series of discoveries that it took a longtime to catch up with in actual laboratory constructions. This was true of thephenomena of resonance, or tuned circuits.Because of their relatively short wavelength, it was comparatively easy to buildcondensers for tuning the circuits. When a circuit is tuned the electric currentthat flows in it oscillates rhythmically, just as does a musical string which,when struck or plucked, vibrates and builds up loops of even lengths withmotionless points between them. There may be only one of these loops, or therecan be many.Tesla did not invent the idea of electrical resonance. It was inherent in themathematical description of the condenser discharge as developed by Lord Kelvin,and in the physical nature of alternating currents; but Tesla changed it from aburied mathematical equation to sparking physical reality. It is the analogy ofacoustical resonance which is a natural property of matter. However, there wereno practical circuits in which resonance could manifest itself until Tesladeveloped alternating currents, particularly the high-frequency currents. He putthe matter’s touch to the research in this field by developing the principle ofresonance in individual circuits through adjustment of capacity and inductance;the amplification of effects by inductive coupling of two tuned circuits, andthe peculiar manifestations of resonance in a circuit tuned to a quarter of thewavelength of the energizing current. This latter development was a stroke ofpure genius.In the vibrating string, two loops measure a complete wavelength and one loopmeasures half a wavelength, since one of the loops is up when the other is down.Between the two loops is a nodal point which does not move. From the nodal pointto the top of a loop is a quarter wavelength. Taking the quarter wavelength as aunit, one end is motionless and the other end swings through the greatestamplitude of vibration.By tuning his coils to quarter wavelengths, one end of the coil, Tesla found,would be entirely inactive while the other end would swing through tremendouselectrical activity. Here was a unique situation, one end of a small coil inertand the other end spouting a flood of sparks of hundreds of thousands or evenmillions of volts. In a physical analogy it seemed like the Niagara Riverreaching the edge of the precipice—and then its waters shooting mountain high ina gigantic fountain instead of falling into the chasm.The quarter-wavelength coil is the electrical counterpart of the vibrating tineof the tuning fork, the ordinary clock pendulum, or the vibrating reed. Onceaccomplished, it was a simple thing—but its discovery was a work of genius. Itwas a development that could have come with certainty to a master mind workingon broad principles, as Tesla was doing all his life, and only by the mostimprobable chance to those who without illumination were tinkering with gadgetsand hoping to stumble on something out of which they could make a fortune.A high-voltage coil with one dead end greatly simplified many problems. One ofTesla’s big problems had been the finding of means to insulate the high-voltagesecondary coil of transformers from the low-voltage primary which energized it.Tesla’s discovery eliminated the voltage entirely from one end of the secondaryso it could be connected directly to the primary or to the ground, while theother end continued to spout its lightning. It was for utilizing this situationthat he developed the conical and pancake-shaped coils.Tesla’s laboratory was filled with a variety of coils. He discovered early inhis researches that while operating a coil of a given wavelength, other coils inthe laboratory, tuned either to this wavelength or one of its harmonics, wouldrespond sympathetically by spouting a crown of sparks although not connected inany way to the operating coil.Here was an example of transmission of energy to a distance through space. Itwas not necessary for Tesla to make a series of experiments to understand theimplications of this situation. He was never lost in a new territory which heopened. His mind rose to such heights of understanding that he could survey arevealed world in a glance.Tesla planned a spectacular demonstration of the new principle. He had hisworkmen string a wire on insulating supports on all four walls near the ceilingof the largest room in his laboratory. The wire was connected to one of hisoscillators.It was late at night when the installation was ready for the experiment. Inorder to make the test, Tesla prepared two tubes of glass about three feet longand a half-inch in diameter. He sealed one end of each, slightly evacuated theair from the tubes, and then sealed the Other ends.Tesla told the workmen he wanted the room completely darkened for the test, alllights out; and when he gave the signal he wanted the switch of his oscillatorclosed. “If my theory is correct,” he explained, “when you close the switchthese tubes will become swords of fire.”Walking to the middle of the room Tesla gave orders to turn out all lights. Thelaboratory was in pitch darkness. A workman stood with his hand on the switch ofthe oscillator.“Now!” shouted Tesla.Instantly the great room was flooded with brilliant but weird blue-white lightand the workmen beheld the tall, slim figure of Tesla in the middle of the roomwaving vigorously what looked like two flaming swords. The two glass tubesglowed with an unearthly radiance, and he would parry and thrust with them as ifhe were in a double fencing match.To the workmen in the laboratory, it was a common experience for Tesla toperform spectacular feats; but this went beyond all limits. He had previouslylighted his electric vacuum lamps but they were always connected to coils thatsupplied them with electricity. Now they lighted without being connected to anysource of electricity.This demonstration, made in 1890, led to Tesla’s adopting the technique as thepermanent method of lighting his laboratories. The loop around the ceiling wasalways energized; and if anyone wished a light at any position, it was onlynecessary to take a glass tube and place it in any convenient location.WHEN Tesla undertook the development of a new kind of electric light, he went tothe sun for his model. He saw in the photosphere, or outer gaseous layer of thesun, light being created by the vibration of molecules. That was the theory thenprevalent; and he sought to use the same method.In the tremendous burst of revelation which he received in the park at Budapestas he gazed into the flaming orb of the setting sun, there had flashed into hismind, as we have seen, not only the marvelous invention of the rotary magneticfield and the many uses of multiple alternating currents, but also the grandgeneralization that everything in Nature operated on the principle of vibrationsthat corresponded to alternating currents. The host of inventions anddiscoveries which he made in all succeeding years had their roots, too, in thatsublime experience.In the sun, it was believed, light was created when the molecules were vibratedby heat. Tesla sought to improve on this method by vibrating the molecules byelectrical forces. The sparks and electrical flames created by his high-voltagecoils were associated, he believed, with molecular vibrations in the air. If hecould bottle the gases of the air and set them in vibration electrically, theyshould produce light without heat, since the energy was supplied by coldelectric currents.Sir William Crookes, who, long before Edison, produced an incandescent electriclight by sealing an electrically heated wire in a vacuum tube, had carried outan extended series of experiments in conducting electricity through the gases inglass vessels under a variety of conditions ranging from atmospheric pressure tothe highest vacuum obtainable, and had produced some strange effects. Crookesused the high-voltage current produced by the old-fashioned induction coil.Tesla expected that when he bottled the strange effects he had observed with hiscurrents of extremely high frequency, he would produce manifestations radicallydifferent from those found by Crookes, or Geissler, who also worked in thisfield. In this he was not disappointed.Four types of an entirely new kind of electric light were produced by Tesla,using electrically activated molecules of gas: 1. Tubes in which a solid bodywas rendered incandescent; 2. Tubes in which phosphorescent and fluorescentmaterials were caused to luminesce; 3. Tubes in which rarefied gases becameluminous, and 4. Tubes in which luminosity was produced in gases at ordinarypressures.Like Crookes, Tesla passed his high-frequency currents through gases at allpressures, from lowest-pressure vacuum to normal atmospheric pressure, andobtained brilliant luminous effects exceeding anything previously attained. Hesubstituted for air in his tubes other gases, including mercury vapor, andobserved the peculiar color and other effects they yielded.Noting the variety of colors the various gases, and even air, showed underdifferent pressures, Tesla suspected that not all of the energy radiated wasgiven off as visible light, but that some of it emanated as black light. Testingthis hypothesis, he placed sulphide of zinc and other phosphorescent andfluorescent materials in his tubes and caused them to glow. In these experiments(they were made in 1889) Tesla laid the foundation for our most recentlydeveloped type of highly efficient lamps used in fluorescent lighting which aregenerally believed to have been invented in recent years. This system ofutilizing the wasted ultra-violet or invisible black light by changing it tovisible light by means of phosphorescent substances is Tesla’s invention.Roentgen was using similar tubes, but of plain glass and the fluorescentsubstance on a table in his laboratory when, a half-dozen years later, hediscovered X-rays. Tesla invented, also, the neon-tube type of lamp, and evenbent his tubes to form letters and geometrical shapes, as is done in neon-tubesigns. This is true in spite of some antecedent and concurrent laboratoryexperiments by Crookes and J. J. Thompson, neither of whom developed any lampsor practical applications.Tesla had discovered early in 1890 that his high-frequency currents hadproperties so different from the ordinary induction-coil, or spark-coil,currents, that he was able to light his tubes just as well, and sometimes evenbetter, with only one wire connecting them with the high-tension transformer,the return circuit being effected wirelessly through space.In working with types of lamps consisting of tubes in the center of which therewas a conducting wire, and with the tube filled with air under a partial vacuum,Tesla discovered that the gas would serve as a better conductor of thehigh-frequency current than the wire. From this observation he was able todevelop many spectacular experiments which appeared to violate the mostfundamental laws of electricity. He was able to short circuit lamps and otherapparatus with heavy bars of metal which, with ordinary currents, wouldcompletely deprive the devices of electricity so they would be unable tooperate. However, with his high-frequency currents, the lamps would light andthe devices operate just as if the short-circuiting bar were not present.One of his startling experiments consisted of placing a long glass tubepartially evacuated of its air inside a slightly longer copper tube with aclosed end. A slit was cut in the copper tube in its central section so the tubeinside would be seen. When the copper tube was connected in the high-frequencycircuit, the air in the tube was brilliantly illuminated; but no evidence couldbe found of any current flowing through the short-circuiting copper shell. Theelectricity preferred to pass through the glass tube, by induction, to theenclosed partially evacuated air, pass through the low-pressure air for the fulllength of the tube, and then pass out the other end by induction, rather thantraverse the complete metal path in the surrounding metal tube.We have then, [said Tesla], as far as we can now see, in the gas a conductorwhich is capable of transmitting electric impulses of any frequency which we maybe able to produce. Could the frequency be brought high enough, then a queersystem of distribution, which would be likely to interest gas companies, mightbe realized; metal pipes filled with gas—the metal being the insulator and thegas the conductor—supplying phosphorescent bulbs, or perhaps devices not yetinvented.This remarkable conductivity of gases, including the air, at low pressures,later led Tesla to suggest, in a published statement in 1914, a system oflighting on a terrestrial scale in which he proposed to treat the whole earth,with its surrounding atmosphere, as if it were a single lamp.The atmosphere is under the greatest pressure at the surface of the earth, owingto the weight of the overlying air. As we go higher in the air there areincreasing amounts below us and less above, so, the greater the elevation, thelower is the pressure of the air.At higher altitudes the gases in the atmosphere are in the same condition as theair in the partially evacuated tubes he prepared in his laboratory, Teslaexplained, and therefore it would serve as an excellent conductor ofhigh-frequency currents. The aurora borealis is a natural example of the effectTesla sought, and it is produced by Nature as Tesla planned; but this was notknown when he evolved his idea.The flow of a sufficient amount of the electricity in the right form through theupper regions of the atmosphere would cause the air to become luminous. Thewhole earth would be transformed into a giant lamp, with the night skycompletely illuminated. It would be unnecessary, he pointed out, to use anylamps along streets, roads or other outdoor areas, except during periods inwhich storms or low clouds prevailed. Ocean travel would be made safer and morepleasant, for the sky over the whole ocean would be illuminated, making thenight as bright as day.The methods by which Tesla intended to conduct his high-frequency currents tothe upper air have not been published. When he outlined the project, he statedthat the plan did not present any difficulties that could not be handled in apractical way. This meant that he had definite means for accomplishing hispurpose.The air, he stated, possesses a high degree of conductivity for high-frequencycurrents at an altitude of 35,000 feet, but could be used effectively at loweratitudes. The accuracy of Tesla’s prediction with respect to the conductivity ofthe upper air is attested by one of the problems encountered today in theoperation of airplanes at altitudes even lower than 25,000 feet. The ignitionsystem, carrying high-voltage currents to the spark plugs in the airplaneengines, which explodes the gas in the cylinders, has been giving trouble at thehigher altitudes because the electricity escapes with a great deal of freedominto the surrounding air. At lower altitudes the air is an excellent insulator,especially for direct current and low-frequency currents, but, as Tesladiscovered, at the higher altitudes where low pressures prevail it becomes anexcellent conductor for the high-frequency currents. The wires leading to sparkplugs become surrounded by a corona, or electrical halo, which indicates theescape of the current This interferes with the efficiency, if it does notentirely prevent the operation, of devices employing high-frequency orhigh-potential currents, such as radio apparatus. *This proposal by Tesla to transform the earth into a giant lamp was againreferred to by him in the twenties. At this time he was without funds forcarrying on experimental work, and, as he never announced details until after hehad tested them in practice, he withheld a disclosure of his methods. He washopeful, however, that he would soon secure money enough to permit him to testhis plan.The author bombarded Tesla with questions in an effort to learn the general planhe had in mind. Tesla was adamant. “If I should answer three more of yourquestions you would know as much about my plan as I do,” he replied.“Nevertheless, Dr. Tesla,” I replied, “I am going to outline in my article theonly plan that appears to me to be feasible under our known physical laws, andyou can deny or affirm it. Your molecular bombardment tubes are prolificproducers of ultra-violet and X-rays and could produce a powerful beam of thisradiation which would ionize the air through great distances. When these rayspass through the air they ionize it, making it a good conductor of electricityof all kinds at sufficiently high voltages. By producing such a beam on a highmountain and directing it upward this would provide a conducting path throughthe air to any height desired. You could then send your high-frequency currentsto the upper air without leaving the ground.”“If you publish that,” said Tesla, “it must appear as your plan, not mine.”The article was published with the foregoing speculation in it; but neitheraffirmation nor denial was forthcoming from the Inventor, and nothing more canbe said in its favor. Tesla may have had a simpler and more practical plan inmind.*There was one other plan which Tesla discussed on a number of occasions whenconsidering terrestrial electrical conditions, and which he may have had in mindin this connection. He pointed out that the earth is a good conductor ofelectricity and the upper air is also a good conductor, while the interveninglower stratum of air is an insulator for many kinds of current. This combinationprovides what is known as a condenser, a device which will store and dischargeelectricity. By charging the earth, the upper air would become charged byinduction. When our spinning earth was so transformed into a terrestrial Leydenjar, it could be alternately charged and discharged, so that a current wouldflow both in the upper air and in the ground, producing the electrical flowwhich would cause the upper air to become self-luminous. Tesla, however, neverbecame quite so specific in applying the condenser plan to this problem as thepreceding sentence indicates. His plan may still exist in his papers, which, atthe present writing, are sealed against inspection except by Governmentofficials.OUT of the almost empty space in a six-inch vacuum tube Tesla succeeded inextracting at least five epoch-making discoveries. Tesla’s lamp was moreprolific in producing wonders than the Aladdin’s lamp of the Arabian Nights. Hegave his “magic” lamp to science fifty years ago. This magic talisman wasTesla’s carbon-button lamp which, apart from the other discoveries that came ofit, was in itself, just as a lamp, a brilliant scientific discovery—and stillremains unused. Edison developed the practical incandescent filament electriclamp and was entitled to, and receives, a tremendous amount of credit for hisaccomplishment. Tesla invented an absolutely original type of lamp, theincandescent-button lamp, which gives twenty times as much light for the sameamount of current consumed; and his contribution remains practically unknown.The carbon-button type of lamp was described by Tesla in his lecture before theAmerican Institute of Engineers in New York in May, 1891, and furtherdevelopments were presented in the lectures which he gave in England and Francein February and March, 1892. In his New York lecture he said:Electrostatic effects are in many ways available for the production of light.For instance, we may place a body of some refractory material in a closed, andpreferably in a more or less air exhausted, globe, connect it to a source ofhigh, rapidly alternating potential, causing the molecules of the gas to strikeit many times a second at enormous speeds, and in this way, with trillions ofinvisible hammers, pound it until it gets incandescent. Or we may place a bodyin a very highly exhausted globe, and by employing very high frequencies andpotentials maintain it at any desired degree of incandescence.He made a vast number of experiments with this carbon-button lamp and gave adescription of the most significant ones in his lecture before the English andFrench scientific societies in the spring of 1892. It was, however, only one ofthe many new types of lamps and other important developments which he includedin this spectacular presentation of his work.The carbon-button lamps were of very simple construction. Basically theyconsisted of a spherical glass globe three to six inches in diameter, in thecenter of which was a piece of solid refractory material mounted on the end of awire which protruded through the globe and served as a single-wire connectionwith the source of high-frequency currents. The globe contained rarefied air.When the high-frequency current was connected with the lamp, molecules of theair in the globe, coming in contact with the central button, became charged andwere repelled at high velocity to the glass globe where they lost their chargeand were then repelled back at equally high velocity, striking the button.Millions of millions of such processes each second caused the button to becomeheated to incandescence.In these simple glass globes Tesla was able to produce extremely hightemperatures, the upper limit of which seemed to be determined by the amount ofcurrent used. He was able to vaporize carbon directly into a gas, observing thatthe liquid state was so unstable it could not exist. Zirconia, the mostheat-resistant substance known, could be melted instantly. He tried diamonds andrubies as buttons—and they too were vaporized. When using the device as a lampit was not his desire to melt the substances; but he always carried experimentsto their upper and lower limits. Carborundum, he observed, was so refractorythat it was possible when using buttons made of this material (calcium carbide)to run the lamps at higher current densities than was possible with othersubstances. Carborundum did not vaporize so readily, nor did it make deposits onthe inside of the globe.Tesla thus evolved a technique in operating the lamps whereby the incandescentbutton transferred its heat energy to the molecules of the very small amount ofgas in the tube so that they became a source of light, thus causing the lamps tofunction like the sun, the button being the massive body of the sun and thesurrounding gas like the photosphere, or atmospheric light-emitting layer, ofthat body.Tesla had a keen sense of dramatic values, but quite apart from this heundoubtedly enjoyed a unique satisfaction when he was able to light thisminiature sun in the currents that he passed through his body—high-frequencycurrents of hundreds of thousands of volts. With one hand grasping a terminal ofhis high-frequency transformer and the other holding aloft this bulb containingan incandescent miniature sun which he had created—posing like the Statue ofLiberty—he was able to make his new lamp radiate its brilliant illumination.Here, you might say. was the superman manifesting his ultramundaneaccomplishments. In addition, there was a satisfaction which was associatedpurely with the plane of ordinary mortals. Edison had laughed at his plan fordeveloping the alternating-current system, and had declared that these currentswere not only useless but deadly. Surely, this was an adequate answer; Teslawould let Nature make his replies.Observing this working model of the incandescent sun which he could hold in hishand, Tesla was quick to see many of the implications of its phenomena. Everyelectrical wave that surged through the tiny central bead caused a shower ofparticles to radiate from it at tremendous velocity and strike the surroundingglass globe, only to be reflected back to the bead. The sun, Tesla reasoned, isan incandescent body that carries a high electrical charge and it, too, willemit vast showers of tiny particles, each carrying great energy because of itsextremely high velocity. In the case of the sun, and other stars like it, therewas no glass globe to act as a barrier, so the showers of particles continuedout into the vast realms of surrounding space.All space was filled with these particles and they were continually bombardingthe earth, blasting matter wherever they struck, just as they did in his globes.He had seen this process take place in his globes, where the most refractorycarbon beads could be shattered into atomic dust by the bombardment of theelectrified particles.He sought to detect these particles striking the earth: one of themanifestations of this bombardment, he declared, was the aurora borealis. Therecords of the experimental methods by which he detected these rays are notavailable; but he published an announcement that he had detected them, measuredtheir energy, and found that they moved with tremendously high velocitiesimparted to them by the hundreds of millions of volts potential of the sun.Neither the scientists nor the general public in the early nineties were in amood for such fantastic figures, or for any claim that the earth was bombardedby such destructive rays. It would be describing the situation in veryconservative fashion to state that Tesla’s report was not taken seriously.When, however, the French physicist, Henri Becquerel, in 1896, discovered themysterious rays emitted by uranium, and subsequent investigations, culminatingwith the discovery by Pierre and Marie Curie, in Paris, of radium, whose atomswere exploding spontaneously without apparent cause, Tesla was able to point tohis cosmic rays as the simple cause of the radioactivity of radium, thorium,uranium and other substances. And he predicted that other substances would alsobe found to be made radioactive by bombardment with these rays. The victory forTesla, however, was only temporary, for the scientific world did not accept histheory. Nevertheless, Tesla was a better prophet than he knew, or anyone elsesuspected.Thirty years later Dr. Robert A. Millikan rediscovered these rays, believingthem to be vibratory in character like light, and was followed by Dr. Arthur H.Compton, who proved the existence of cosmic rays consisting of high-velocityparticles of matter, just as Tesla described them. They started by findingenergies of ten million volts; and today the energies are far up in the billionsand even trillions of electron volts. And these and other investigators describethese rays as shattering atoms of matter producing showers of débris—just asTesla predicted.In 1934, Frederick Joliot, son-in-law of the Curies, discovered that artificialradioactivity was produced in ordinary materials by bombarding them withparticles in just the manner which Tesla described. Joliot received the NobelPrize for his discovery; no one gives any credit to Tesla.Tesla’s molecular-bombardment lamp was the ancestor of another very moderndevelopment—the atom-smashing cyclotron. The cyclotron, developed by E. O.Lawrence, of the University of California, during the past twenty years, is adevice in which electrified particles are whirled in a magnetic field in acircular chamber until they reach a very high velocity, and are then led out ofthe chamber in a narrow stream. The giant machine, with a magnet as high as ahouse, partially completed at present writing, will emit so powerful a beam ofcharged particles that, according to Prof. Lawrence, if allowed to impinge on abuilding brick they will totally disintegrate it. The smaller models were usedto bombard a variety of substances to render them radioactive, to disintegratethem or transmute their atoms into those of other elements.The small glass globe, six inches or less in diameter, holding Tesla’smolecular-bombardment lamp produced exactly this same disintegrating effect onsolid matter, probably with a more intensified effect than any atom-smashingcyclotron now in existence—despite their tremendous size. (Even small ones weightwenty tons.)In describing one of the experiments with his lamp, one in which a ruby wasmounted in a carbon button, Tesla said:It was found, among other things, that in such cases, no matter where thebombardment began, just as soon as a high temperature was reached there wasgenerally one of the bodies which seemed to take most of the bombardment uponitself, the other, or others, being thereby relieved. This quality appeared todepend principally on the point of fusion, and on the facility with which thebody was “evaporated,” or, generally speaking, disintegrated—meaning by thelatter term not only the throwing off of atoms, but likewise of larger lumps.The observation made was in accordance with generally accepted notions. In ahighly exhausted bulb electricity is carried off from the electrode byindependent carriers, which are partly atoms, or molecules, of the residualatmosphere, and partly the atoms, molecules, or lumps thrown off from theelectrode. If the electrode is composed of bodies of different character, and ifone of these is more easily disintegrated than the others, most of theelectricity supplied is carried off from that body, which is then brought to ahigher temperature than the others, and this the more, as upon an increase ofthe temperature the body is still more easily disintegrated.Substances which resisted melting in temperatures attainable in laboratoryfurnaces of that day were easily disintegrated in Tesla’s simple-lampdisintegrator, which provided a powerful beam of disintegrating particles byhaving them concentrated from all directions by a spherical reflector (the globeof his lamp), a kind a three-dimension burning glass, but operating withelectrified particles instead of heat rays. It accomplished the same effect asthe heavy atom disintegrators of today, but much more efficiently in a globe solight in weight it almost floated off in air. Its simplicity and efficiency isfurther increased by the fact that it causes the substance that is beingdisintegrated to supply the particles by which the disintegration is effected.There is one more very modern discovery of great importance embodied in Tesla’smolecular-bombardment lamp—the point electron miscroscope, which providesmagnifications of a million diameters, or ten to twenty times more powerful thanthe better known electron microscope—which in turn is capable of magnificationsup to fifty times greater than the optical microscope.In the point electron microscope, electrified particles shoot out in straightlines from a tiny active spot on a piece of substance kept at a high potential,and reproduce on the spherical surface of a glass globe the pattern of themicroscopically small area from which the particles are issuing. The size of theglass sphere furnishes the only limit to the degree of magnification that can beobtained; the greater the radius, the greater the magnification. Since electronsare smaller than light waves, objects too small to be seen by light waves can betremendously enlarged by the patterns produced by the emitted electrons.Tesla produced on the surface of the spherical globe of his lamp phosphorescentimages of what was taking place on the disintegrating button when he usedextremely high vacuum. He described this effect in his lectures in the spring of1892, and his description will stand with hardly a change in a word for adescription of the million-magnification point electron microscope. Quoting fromhis lecture:To the eye the electrode appears uniformly brilliant, but there are upon itpoints constantly shifting and wandering about, of a temperature far above themean, and this materially hastens the process of deterioration…. Exhaust a bulbto a very high degree, so that with a fairly high potential the discharge cannotpass—that is, not a luminous one, for a weak invisible discharge occurs always,in all probability. Now raise slowly and carefully the potential, leaving theprimary current no more than for an instant. At a certain point, two, three orhalf a dozen phosphorescent spots will appear on the globe. These places of theglass are evidently more violently bombarded than the others, this being due tothe unevenly distributed electric density, necessitated, of course, by sharpprojections, or, generally speaking, irregularities of the electrode. But theluminous patches are constantly changing in position, which is especially wellobserved if one manages to produce very few, and this indicates that theconfiguration of the electrode is rapidly changing.It would be an act of simple justice if in the future scientists would extendcredit to Tesla for being the one who discovered the electron miscroscope. Thereis no reduction in the glory due him because he did not specifically describethe electron, then unknown, in its operations, but assumed the effect was due toelectrically charged atoms.When Tesla studied the performance of various models of this and his othergaseous lamps, he observed that the output of visible light changed undervarious operating conditions. He knew they gave off both visible and invisiblerays. He used a variety of phosphorescent and fluorescent substances fordetecting the ultra-violet or black light. Usually, the changes in the visibleand ultra-violet light about balanced each other; as one increased the otherdecreased, with the remainder of the energy accounted for by heat losses. In hismolecular-bombardment lamp he found, he reported in his 1892 lectures, “visiblelight, black light and a very special radiation.” He was experimenting with thisradiation which, he reported, produced shadowgraph pictures on plates in metalcontainers, in his laboratory when it was destroyed by fire in March, 1895.This “very special radiation” was not further described at that time inpublished articles; but when Prof. Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen, in Germany, inDecember, 1895, announced the discovery of X-rays, Tesla was able immediately toreproduce the same results by means of his “very special radiation,” indicatingthat these and X-rays had very similar properties although produced in somewhatdifferent ways. Immediately upon reading Roentgen’s announcement, Teslaforwarded to the German scientist shadowgraph pictures produced by his “veryspecial radiation.” Roentgen replied: “The pictures are very interesting. If youwould only be so kind as to disclose the manner in which you obtained them.”Tesla did not consider that this situation gave him any priority in thediscovery of X-rays, nor did he ever advance any claims; but he immediatelystarted an extensive series of investigations into their nature. While otherswere trying to coax out of the type of tube used by Roentgen enough X-rays totake shadow photographs through such thin structures as the hands and feet heldvery close to the bulb, Tesla was taking photographs through the skull at adistance of forty feet from the tube. He elsewhere described at this time anunidentified type of radiation coming from a spark gap, when a heavy current waspassed, that was not a transverse wave like light, or Hertzian waves, and couldnot be stopped by interposing metal plates.Tesla, thus, in one lecture reporting his investigations covering a period oftwo years, offered to the world—in addition to his new electric vacuum lamps,his highly efficient incandescent lamp, and his high-frequency andhigh-potential currents and apparatus—at least five outstanding scientificdiscoveries: 1. Cosmic rays; 2. Artificial radioactivity; 3. Disintegrating beamof electrified particles, or atom smasher; 4. Electron microscope; and 5. “Veryspecial radiation” (X-rays).At least four of these innovations, when “rediscovered” up to forty years later,won Nobel Prizes for others; and (Tesla’s name is never mentioned in connectionwith them.Yet Tesla’s lifetime work was hardly well started!* Since Tesla discovered that metal wires and rods which act as excellentconductors for direct and low-frequency currents can act as excellent insulatorsfor his high-frequency currents, it is obvious that the common suggestion madefor delivering a current to the upper air by means of metal cables suspendedfrom balloons is entirely impractical.* Since completing this volume the author has learned that Tesla planned toInstall a bank of powerful ultra-violet lamps on top of his. tower at Wardenciff(cf. p. 105), and had the upper platform designed to receive them.TENimage [images/00003.jpg] TESLA had a remarkable ability for carrying on simultaneously a number of widelydifferent lines of scientific research. While pursuing his studies ofhigh-frequency electrical oscillations with all of their ramifications fromvacuum lamps to radio, he was also investigating mechanical vibrations; and hehad a rare foresight into the many useful applications to which they could beput. and which have since been realized.Tesla never did things by halves. Almost everything he attempted went off like aflash of lightning with a very satisfactory resounding clap of thunderfollowing. Even when he did not so plan events, they appeared to fashionthemselves into spectacular climaxes. In 1896 while his fame was still on theascendant he planned a nice quiet little vibration experiment in his HoustonStreet laboratory. Since he had moved into these quarters in 1895, the place hadestablished a reputation for itself because of the peculiar noises and lightsthat emanated from it at all hours of the day and night, and because it wasconstantly being visited by the most famous people in the country.The quiet little vibration experiment produced an earthquake, a real earthquakein which people and buildings and everything in them got a more tremendousshaking than they did in any of the natural earthquakes that have visited themetropolis. In an area of a dozen square city blocks, occupied by hundreds ofbuildings housing tens of thousands of persons, there was a sudden roaring andshaking, shattering of panes of glass, breaking of steam, gas and water pipes.Pandemonium reigned as small objects danced around rooms, plaster descended fromwalls and ceilings, and pieces of machinery weighing tons were moved from theirbolted anchorages and shifted to awkward spots in factory lofts.“It was all caused, quite unexpectedly, by a little piece of apparatus you couldslip in your pocket,” said Tesla.The device that precipitated the sudden crisis had been used for a long time byTesla as a toy to amuse his friends. It was a mechanical oscillator, and wasused to produce vibrations. The motor-driven device that the barber straps onhis hand to give a patron an “electric massage” is a descendant of Tesla’smechanical oscillator. There is, of course, nothing electric about an “electricmassage” except the power used to produce vibrations which are transmittedthrough the barber’s fingers to the scalp.Tesla developed in the early nineties a mechanical-electrical oscillator for thegeneration of high-frequency alternating currents. The driving engine producedon a shaft simple reciprocating motion that was not changed to rotary motion.Mounted on either end of the shaft was a coil of many turns of wire that movedback and forth with high frequency between the poles of electromagnets, and inthis way generated high-frequency alternating currents.The engine was claimed by Tesla to have a very high efficiency compared to thecommon type of engine, which changed reciprocating to rotary motion by means ofa crank shaft. It had no valves or other moving parts, except the reciprocatingpiston with its attached shaft and coils, so that mechanical losses were verylow. It maintained such an extremely high order of constancy of speed, hestated, that the alternating current generated by the oscillator could be usedto drive clocks, without any pendulum or balance-wheel control mechanisms, andthey would keep time more accurately than the sun.This engine may have had industrial possibilities but Tesla was not interestedin them. To him it was just a convenient way of producing a high-frequencyalternating current constant in frequency and voltage, or mechanical vibrations,if used without the electrical parts. He operated the engine on compressed airand also by steam at 320 pounds and also at 80 pounds pressure.While perfecting this device, he had opportunity to observe interesting effectsproduced by vibration. These were objectionable in the engine when it was usedas a dynamo, so he adopted suitable measures to eliminate or suppress them. Thevibrations as such, however, interested him. Although they were detrimental tothe machine, he found their physiological effects were, at times, quitepleasant. Later he built a small mechanical oscillator driven by compressed airwhich was designed for no other purpose than to produce vibrations. He built aplatform insulated from the floor by rubber and cork. He then mounted theoscillator on the under side of the platform. The purpose of the rubber and corkunder the platform was to keep the vibrations from leaking into the building andthereby reducing the effect on the platform. Visitors found this vibratingplatform one of the most interesting of the great array of fascinating andfantastic exhibits with which he dazzled the society folk who flocked to hislaboratory.Great hopes were entertained by Tesla of applying these vibrations fortherapeutic and health-improving effects. He had opportunity to observe, throughhis own experience and that of his employees, that they produce some verydefinite physiological actions.Samuel Clemens, better known to the public as “Mark Twain,” and Tesla were closefriends. Clemens was a frequent visitor to the Tesla laboratory. Tesla had beenplaying with his vibratory mechanism for some time, and had learned a good dealabout the results that followed from varying doses of vibration, when oneevening Clemens dropped in.Clemens, on learning about the new mechanism, wanted to experience itsvitalizing vibrations. He stood on the platform while the oscillator set it intooperation. He was thrilled by the new experience. He was full of adjectives.“This gives you vigor and vitality,” he exclaimed. After he had been on theplatform for a while Tesla advised him: “You have had enough, Mr. Clemens. Youhad better come down now.”“Not by a jugful,” replied Clemens. “I am enjoying myself.”“But you had better come down, Mr. Clemens. It is best that you do so,” insistedTesla.“You couldn’t get me off this with a derrick,” laughed Clemens.“Remember, I am advising you, Mr. Clemens.”“I’m having the time of my life. I’m going to stay right up here and enjoymyself. Look here, Tesla, you don’t appreciate what a wonderful device you havehere to give a lift to tired humanity….” Clemens continued along this line forseveral minutes. Suddenly he stopped talking, bit his lower lip, straightenedhis body and stalked stiffly but suddenly from the platform.“Quick, Tesla! Where is it?” snapped Clemens, half begging, half demanding.“Right over here, through that little door in the corner,” said Tesla. “Andremember, Mr. Clemens, I advised you to come down some time ago,” he calledafter the rapidly moving figure.The laxative effect of the vibrator was an old story to the members of thelaboratory staff.Tesla pursued his studies of mechanical vibrations in many directions. This wasalmost a virgin field for scientific research. Scarcely any fundamental researchhad been done in the field since Pythagoras, twenty-five hundred years before,had established the science of music through his study of vibrating strings; andmany of the wonders with which Tesla had starded the world in the field ofhigh-frequency and high-potential currents had grown out of his simple secretfor tuning electrical circuits so that the electricity vibrated in resonancewith its circuit. He now visualized mechanical vibrations building up resonanceconditions in the same way, to produce effects of tremendous magnitude onphysical objects.In order to carry out what he expected to be some minor and very small-scaleexperiments, he screwed the base of one of his small mechanical oscillators toan iron supporting pillar in the middle of his laboratory and set it intooscillation. It had been his observation that it took some time to build up itsmaximum speed of vibration. The longer it operated the faster the tempo itattained. He had noticed that all objects did not respond in the same way tovibrations. One of the many objects around the laboratory would suddenly go intoviolent vibration as it came into resonance with the fundamental vibration ofthe oscillator or some harmonic of it. As the period of the oscillator changed,the first object would stop and some other object in resonance with the new ratewould start vibrating. The reason for this selective response was very clear toTesla, but he had never previously had the opportunity to observe the phenomenonon a really large scale.Tesla’s laboratory was on an upper floor of a loft building. It was on the northside of Houston Street, and the second house east of Mulberry Street. Aboutthree hundred feet south of Houston Street on the east side of Mulberry Streetwas the long, four-story red-brick building famous as Police Headquarters.Throughout the neighborhood there were many loft buildings ranging from five toten stories in height, occupied by factories of all kinds. Sandwiched betweenthem were the small narrow tenement houses of a densely packed Italianpopulation. A few blocks to the south was Chinatown, a few blocks to the westwas the garment-trades area, a short distance to the east was a densely crowdedtenement-house district.It was in this highly variegated neighborhood that Tesla unexpectedly staged aspectacular demonstration of the properties of sustained powerful vibrations.The surrounding population knew about Tesla’s laboratory, knew that it was aplace where strange, magical, mysterious events took place and where an equallystrange man was doing fearful and wonderful things with that tremendouslydangerous secret agent known as electricity. Tesla, they knew, was a man who wasto be both venerated and feared, and they did a much better job of fearing thanof venerating him.Quite unmindful of what anyone thought about him, Tesla carried on his vibrationand all other experiments. Just what experiment he had in mind on thisparticular morning will never be known. He busied himself with preparations forit while his oscillator on the supporting iron pillar of the structure keptbuilding up an ever higher frequency of vibrations. He noted that every now andthen some heavy piece of apparatus would vibrate sharply, the floor under himwould rumble for a second or two—that a window pane would sing audibly, andother similar transient events would happen—all of which was quite familiar tohim. These observations told him that his oscillator was tuning up nicely, andhe probably wondered why he had not tried it firmly attached to a solid buildingsupport before.Things were not going so well in the neighborhood, however. Down in PoliceHeadquarters in Mulberry Street the “cops” were quite familiar with strangesounds and lights coming from the Tesla laboratory. They could hear clearly thesharp snapping of the lightnings created by his coils. If anything queer washappening in the neighborhood, they knew that Tesla was in back of it in someway or other.On this particular morning the cops were surprised to feel the building rumblingunder their feet. Chairs moved across floors with no one near them. Objects onthe officers’desks danced about and the desks themselves moved. It must be anearthquake! It grew stronger. Chunks of plaster fell from the ceilings. A floodof water ran down one of the stairs from a broken pipe. The windows started tovibrate with a shrill note that grew more intense. Some of the windowsshattered.“That isn’t an earthquake,” shouted one of the officers, “it’s thatblankety-blank Tesla. Get up there quickly,” he called to a squad of men, “andstop him. Use force if you have to, but stop him. He’ll wreck the city.”The officers started on a run for the building around the corner. Pouring intothe streets were many scores of people excitedly leaving near-by tenement andfactory buildings, believing an earthquake had caused the smashing of windows,breaking of pipes, moving of furniture and the strange vibrations.Without waiting for the slow-pokey elevator, the cops rushed up the stairs—andas they did so they felt the building vibrate even more strongly than did policeheadquarters. There was a sense of impending doom—that the whole building woulddisintegrate—and their fears were not relieved by the sound of smashing glassand the queer roars and screams that came from the walls and floors.Could they reach Tesla’s laboratory in time to stop him? Or would the buildingtumble down on their heads and everyone in it be buried in the ruins, andprobably every building in the neighborhood? Maybe he was making the whole earthshake in this way! Would this madman be destroying the world? It was destroyedonce before by water. Maybe this time it would be destroyed by that agent of thedevil that they call electricity!Just as the cops rushed into Tesla’s laboratory to tackle—they knew not what—thevibrations stopped and they beheld a strange sight. They arrived just in time tosee the tall gaunt figure of the inventor swing a heavy sledge hammer andshatter a small iron contraption mounted on the post in the middle of the room.Pandemonium gave way to a deep, heavy silence.Tesla was the first to break the silence. Resting his sledge hammer against thepillar, he turned his tall, lean, coatless figure to the cops. He was alwaysself-possessed, always a commanding presence—an effect that could in no way beattributed to his slender build, but seemed more to emanate from his eyes.Bowing from the waist in his courtly manner, he addressed the policemen, whowere too out of breath to speak, and probably overawed into silence by theirfantastic experience.“Gentlemen,” he said, “I am sorry, but you are just a trifle too late to witnessmy experiment. I found it necessary to stop it suddenly and unexpectedly and inan unusual way just as you entered. If you will come around this evening I willhave another oscillator attached to this platform and each of you can stand onit. You will, I am sure, find it a most interesting and pleasurable experience.Now you must leave, for I have many things to do. Good day, gentlemen.”George Scherff, Tesla’s secretary, was standing near by when Tesla sodramatically smashed his earthquake maker. Tesla never told the story beyondthis point, and Mr. Scherff declares he does not recall what the response of thecops was. Imagination must furnish the finale to the story.At the moment, though, Tesla was quite sincere in his attitude. He had no ideaof what had happened elsewhere in the neighborhood as a result of hisexperiment, but the effect on his own laboratory had been sufficientlythreatening to cause him to halt it suddenly. When he learned the details,however, he was convinced that he was correct in his belief that the field ofmechanical vibrations was rich with opportunities for scientific investigation.We have no records available of any further major experiments with vibration inthat laboratory. Perhaps the Police and Building Departments had offered someemphatic suggestions to him concerning experiments of this nature.Tesla’s observations in this experiment were limited to what took place on thefloor of the building in which his laboratory was located, but apparently verylittle happened there until a great deal had happened elsewhere. The oscillatorwas firmly fixed to a supporting column and there were similar supportingcolumns directly under it on each floor down to the foundations. The vibrationswere transmitted through the columns to the ground. This section of the city isbuilt on deep sand that extends down some hundreds of feet before bed rock isreached. It is well known to seismologists that earthquake vibrations aretransmitted by sand with much greater intensity than they are by rock. Theground under the building and around it was, therefore, an excellent transmitterof mechanical vibrations, which spread out in all directions. They may havereached a mile or more. They were more intense, of course, near their source andbecame weaker as the distance increased. However, even weak vibrations that aresustained can build up surprisingly large effects when they are absorbed by anobject with which they are in resonance. A distant object in resonance can bethrown into strong vibration whereas a much nearer object not in resonance willbe left unaffected.It was this selective resonance that was, apparently, operating in Tesla’sexperiment. Buildings other than his own came into resonance with the increasingtempo of his oscillator long before his own building was affected. After thepandemonium was under way for some time elsewhere and the higher frequencieswere reached, his immediate surroundings started to come into, resonance.When resonance is reached the effects follow instantly and powerfully. Teslaknew this, so when he observed dangerous resonance effects developing in hisbuilding he realized he had to act fast. The oscillator was being operated bycompressed air supplied by a motor-driven compressor that fed the air into atank, where it was stored under pressure. Even if the motor were shut off, therewas plenty of air in the tank to keep the oscillator going for many minutes—andin that time the building could be completely wrecked and reduced to a pile ofdébris. With the vibrations reaching this dangerous amplitude, there was no timeto try to disconnect the vibrator from the air line or to do anything aboutreleasing the air from the tank. There was time for only one thing, and Tesladid that. He grabbed the near-by sledge hammer and took a mighty swing at theoscillator in hopes of putting it out of operation. He succeeded in his firstattempt.The device was made of cast iron and was of rugged construction. There were nodelicate parts that could be easily damaged. Tesla has never published adescription of the device, but its construction was principally that of a pistonwhich moved back and forth inside a cast-iron cylinder. The only way to stop itfrom operating was to smash the outer cylinder. Fortunately, that is whathappened from the first blow.As Tesla turned around after delivering this lucky blow and beheld the visitingpolicemen, he could not understand the reason for their visit. The dangerousvibrations had developed in his building only within the preceding minute, andthe policemen would not have had time to plan a visit in connection with them,he figured, so they must have come for some other less critical purpose, andtherefore he proposed to dismiss them until a more opportune moment.Tesla related this experience to me when I asked the inventor’s opinion of aplan that I had suggested some time previously to Elmer Sperry, Jr., son of thefamous inventor of many gyroscope devices. When a heavy gyroscope, such as isused in stabilizing ships, is forced to turn on its axis, it transmits apowerful downward thrust through the bearings in which the supporting gimbal ismounted. If a battery of such gyroscopes were mounted in regions where severeearthquakes take place it would transmit thrusts to the ground at equally timedintervals and build up resonance vibrations in the strata of the earth thatwould cause earthquake strains to be released while they were of smallmagnitude, thus producing very small earthquakes instead of letting the strainsbuild up to large magnitudes which, when they let go, would cause devastatingearthquakes.The idea made a strong appeal to Tesla; and in his discussion, after telling meof the experience here related, he further declared that he had so far developedhis study of vibrations that he could establish a new science of“telegeodynamics” which would deal not only with the transmission of powerfulimpulses through the earth to distant points to produce effects of largemagnitude—in addition, he could use the same principles to detect distantobjects. In the later thirties, before the outbreak of the war, he declared thathe could apply these principles for the detection of submarines or other shipsat a distance, even though they were lying at anchor and no engines operating onthem.His system of telegeodynamics, using mechanical vibrations, Tesla declared,would make it possible to determine the physical constant of the earth and tolocate ore deposits far beneath the surface. This latter prediction has sincebeen fulfilled, for many oil fields have been discovered by studying thevibrations reflected from sub-surface strata.“So powerful are the effects of the telegeodynamic oscillator,” said Tesla inreviewing the subject in the thirties, “that I could now go over to the EmpireState Building and reduce it to a tangled mass of wreckage in a very short time.I could accomplish this result with utmost certainty and without any difficultywhatever. I would use a small mechanical vibrating device, an engine so smallyou could slip it in your pocket. I could attach it to any part of the building,start it in operation, allow it twelve to thirteen minutes to come to fullresonance. The building would first respond with gentle tremors, and thevibrations would then become so powerful that the whole structure would go intoresonant oscillations of such great amplitude and power that rivets in the steelbeams would be loosened and sheared. The outer stone coating would be thrown offand then the skeleton steel structure would collapse in all its parts. It wouldtake about 2. 5 * horsepower to drive the oscillator to produce this effect.”TESLA developed his inventions to the point at which they were spectacularperformers before they were demonstrated to the public. When presented, theperformance always greatly exceeded the promise. This was the case with hisfirst public demonstration of “wireless,” but he complicated the situation bycoupling with his radio invention another new idea—the robot.Tesla staged his demonstration in the great auditorium of Madison Square Garden,then on the north side of Madison Square, in September, 1898, as part of thefirst annual Electrical Exhibition. He had a large tank built in the center ofthe arena and In this he placed an iron-hulled boat a few feet long, shaped likean ark, which he operated by remote control by means of his wireless system.Extending upward from the center of the roof of the boat was a slender metal roda few feet high which served as an antenna, or aerial, for receiving thewireless wave. Near the bow and stern were two small metal tubes about a foothigh surmounted by small electric lamps. The interior of the hull was packedwith a radio receiving set and a variety of motor-driven mechanisms which putinto effect the operating orders sent to the boat by wireless waves. There was amotor for propelling the boat and another motor for operating theservo-mechanism, or mechanical brain, that interpreted the orders coming fromthe wireless receiving set and translated them into mechanical motions, whichincluded steering the boat in any direction, making it stop, start, go forwardor backward, or light either lamp. The boat could thus be put through the mostcomplicated maneuvers.Anyone attending the exhibition could call the maneuver for the boat, and Tesla,with a few touches on a telegraph key, would cause the boat to respond. Hiscontrol point was at the far end of the great arena.The demonstration created a sensation and Tesla again was the popular hero. Itwas a front-page story in the newspapers. Everyone knew the accomplishment was awonderful one, but few grasped the significance of the event or the importanceof the fundamental discovery which it demonstrated. The basic aspects of theinvention were obscured by the glamor of the demonstration.The Spanish American War was under way. The success of the U. S. Navy indestroying the Spanish fleets was the leading topic of conversation. There wasresentment over the blowing up of the U. S. S. Maine in Havana Harbor. Tesla’sdemonstration fired the imagination of everyone because of its possibilities asa weapon in naval warfare.Waldemar Kaempffert, then a student in City College and now Science Editor ofthe New York Times, discussed its use as a weapon with Tesla.“I see,” said Kaempffert, “how you could load an even larger boat with a cargoof dynamite, cause it to ride submerged, and explode the dynamite whenever youwished by pressing the key just as easily as you can cause the light on the bowto shine, and blow up from a distance by wireless even the largest ofbattleships.” (Edison had earlier designed an electric torpedo which receivedits power by a cable that remained connected with the mother ship.)Tesla was patriotic, and was proud of his status, which he had acquired in 1889,as a citizen of the United States. He had offered his invention to theGovernment as a naval weapon, but at heart he was opposed to war.“You do not see there a wireless torpedo,” snapped back Tesla with fire flashingin his eyes, “you see there the first of a race of robots, mechanical men whichwill do the laborious work of the human race.”The “race of robots” was another of Tesla’s original and important contributionsto human welfare. It was one of the items of his colossal project for increasinghuman energy and improving the efficiency of its utilization. He visualized theapplication of the robot idea to warfare as well as to peaceful pursuits; andout of the broad principles enunciated, he developed an accurate picture ofwarfare as it is being carried on today with the use of giant machines asweapons—the robots he described.“This evolution,” he stated in an article in the Century Magazine of June, 1900,“will bring more and more into prominence a machine or mechanism with the fewestindividuals as an element of warfare…. Greatest possible speed and maximum rateof energy delivery by the war apparatus will be the main object. The loss oflife will become smaller….”Outlining the experiences that led him to design the robots, or automatons, ashe called them, Tesla stated:I have by every thought and act of mine, demonstrated, and do SO daily, to myabsolute satisfaction that I am an automaton endowed with power of movement,which merely responds to external stimuli beating upon my sense organs, andthinks and moves accordingly….With these experiences it was only natural that, long ago, I conceived the ideaof constructing an automaton which would mechanically represent me, and whichwould respond, as I do myself, but, of course, in a much more primitive manner,to external influences. Such an automaton evidently had to have motive power,organs for locomotion, directive organs, and one or more sensitive organs soadapted as to be excited by external stimuli.This machine would, I reasoned, perform its movements in the manner of a livingbeing, for it would have all of the chief elements of the same. There was stillthe capacity for growth, propagation, and, above all, the mind which would bewanting to make the model complete. But growth was not necessary in this casesince a machine could be manufactured full-grown, so to speak. As to capacityfor propagation, it could likewise be left out of consideration, for in themechanical model it merely signified a process of manufacture.Whether the automaton be of flesh and bone, or of wood and steel, matteredlittle, provided it could perform all the duties required of it like anintelligent being. To do so it would have to have an element corresponding tothe mind, which would effect the control of its movements and operations, andcause it to act, in any unforeseen case that might present itself, withknowledge, reason, judgement and experience. But this element I could easilyembody in it by conveying to it my own intelligence, my own understanding. Sothis invention was evolved, and so a new art came into existence, for which thename “telautomatics” has been suggested, which means the art of controlling themovements and operations of distant automatons.In order to give the automaton an individual identity it would be provided witha particular electrical tuning, Tesla explained, to which it alone would respondwhen waves of that particular frequency were sent from a control transmittingstation; and other automatons would remain inactive until their frequency wastransmitted. This was Tesla’s fundamental radio tuning invention, the need forwhich other radio inventors had not yet glimpsed although Tesla had described itpublicly a half-dozen years earlier.Tesla not only used in the control of his automaton the long waves now used inbroadcasting—which are very different from the short waves used by Marconi andall others; for those could be interfered with by the imposition of anintervening object—but he was explaining the use, through his system of tuning,of the spectrum of allocations for individual stations that now appears on thedials of radio receiving sets. He continued:By the simple means described the knowledge, experience, judgement—the mind, soto speak—of the distant operator were embodied in that machine, which was thusenabled to move and perform all of its operations with reason and intelligence.It behaved just like a blindfolded person obeying directions received throughthe ear.The automatons so far constructed had “borrowed minds,” so to speak, as eachformed merely part of the distant operator who conveyed to it his intelligentorders; but this art is only in the beginning.I purpose to show that, however impossible it may now seem, an automaton may becontrived which will have its “own mind,” and by this I mean that it will beable, independently of any operator, left entirely to itself, to perform, inresponse to external influences affecting its sensitive organs, a great varietyof acts and operations as if it had intelligence.It will be able to follow a course laid out or to obey orders given far inadvance; it will be capable of distinguishing between what it ought and oughtnot to do, and of making experiences or, otherwise stated, of recordingimpressions which will definitely affect its subsequent actions. In fact I havealready conceived such a plan.Although I evolved this invention many years ago and explained it to my visitorsvery frequently in my laboratory demonstrations, it was not until much later,long after I had perfected it, that it became known, when, naturally enough, itgave rise to much discussion and to sensational reports.But the true significance of this new art was not grasped by the majority, norwas the great force of the underlying principle recognized. As nearly as I couldjudge from the numerous comments which then appeared, the results I had obtainedwere considered as entirely impossible. Even the few who were disposed to admitthe practicability of the invention saw in it merely an automobile torpedo,which was to be used for the purpose of blowing up battleships, with doubtfulsuccess….But the art I have evolved does not contemplate merely the change of directionof a moving vessel; it affords means of absolutely controlling in every respect,all the innumerable translatory movements, as well as the operations of all theinternal organs, no matter how many, of an individualized automaton.Tesla, in an unpublished statement, prepared fifteen years later, recorded hisexperience in developing automata, and his unsuccessful effort to interest theWar Department, and likewise commercial concerns, in his wirelessly controlleddevices.The idea of constructing an automaton, to bear out my theory, presented itselfto me early but I did not begin active work until 1893, when I started mywireless investigations. During the succeeding two or three years, a number ofautomatic mechanisms, actuated from a distance by wireless control, wereconstructed by me and exhibited to visitors in my laboratory.In 1896, however, I designed a complete machine capable of a multitude ofoperations, but the consummation of my labors was delayed until later in 1897.This machine was illustrated and described in my article in the Century Magazineof June 1900, and other periodicals of that time and, when first shown in thebeginning of 1898, it created a sensation such as no other invention of mine hasever produced.In November 1898, a basic patent on the novel art was granted to me, but onlyafter the Examiner-in-Chief had come to New York and witnessed the performance,for what I claimed seemed unbelievable. I remember that when later I called onan official in Washington, with a view of offering the invention to theGovernment, he burst out in laughter upon my telling him what I hadaccomplished. Nobody thought then that there was the faintest prospect ofperfecting such a device.It is unfortunate that in this patent, following the advice of my attorneys, Iindicated the control as being effected through the medium of a single circuitand a well-known form of detector, for the reason that I had not yet securedprotection on my methods and apparatus for individualization. As a matter offact, my boats were controlled through the joint action of several circuits andinterference of every kind was excluded. Most generally I employed receivingcircuits in the form of loops, including condensers, because the discharges ofmy high tension transmitter ionized the air in the hall so that even a verysmall aerial would draw electricity from the surrounding atmosphere for hours.Just to give an idea, I found, for instance, that a bulb 12” in diameter, highlyexhausted, and with one single terminal to which a short wire was attached,would deliver well on to one thousand successive flashes before all charge ofthe air in the laboratory was neutralized. The loop form of receiver was notsensitive to such a disturbance and it is curious to note that it is becomingpopular at this late date. In reality it collects much less energy than theaerials or a long grounded wire, but it so happens that it does away with anumber of defects inherent to the present wireless devices.In demonstrating my invention before audiences, the visitors were requested toask any questions, however involved, and the automaton would answer them bysigns. This was considered magic at that time but was extremely simple, for itwas myself who gave the replies by means of the device.At the same period another larger telautomatic boat was constructed. It wascontrolled by loops having several turns placed in the hull, which was madeentirely water tight and capable of submergence. The apparatus was similar tothat used in the first with the exception of certain special features Iintroduced as, for example, incandescent lamps which afforded a visible evidenceof the proper functioning of the machine and served for other purposes.These automata, controlled within the range of vision of the operator, were,however, the first and rather crude steps in the evolution of the Art ofTelautomatics as I had conceived it. The next logical improvement was itsapplication to automatic mechanisms beyond the limits of vision and at greatdistances from the center of control, and I have ever since advocated theiremployments as instruments of warfare in preference to guns. The importance ofthis now seems to be recognized, if I am to judge from casual announcementsthrough the press of achievements which are said to be extraordinary but containno merit of novelty whatever.In an imperfect manner it is practicable, with the. existing wireless plants, tolaunch an aeroplane, have it follow a certain approximate course, and performsome operation at a distance of many hundreds of miles. A machine of this kindcan also be mechanically controlled in several ways and I have no doubt that itmay prove of some usefulness in war. But there are, to my best knowledge, noinstrumentalities in existence today with which such an object could beaccomplished in a precise manner. I have devoted years of study to this matterand have evolved means, making such and greater wonders easily realizable.As stated on a previous occasion, when I was a student at college I conceived aflying machine quite unlike the present ones. The underlying principle was soundbut could not be carried into practice for want of a prime-mover of sufficientlygreat activity. In recent years I have successfully solved this problem and amnow planning aerial machines devoid of sustaining planes, ailerons, propellersand other external attachments, which will be capable of immense speeds and arevery likely to furnish powerful arguments for peace in the near future. Such amachine, sustained and propelled entirely by reaction, can be controlled eithermechanically or by wireless energy. By installing proper plants it will bepracticable to project a missile of this kind into the air and drop it almost onthe very spot designated which may be thousands of miles away. But we are notgoing to stop at this.Tesla is here describing—nearly fifty years ago—the radio-controlled rocket,which is still a confidential development of World War II, and the rocket bombsused by the Germans to attack England. The rocket-type airship is a secret whichprobably died with Tesla, unless it is contained in his papers sealed by theGovernment at the time of his death. This, however, is unlikely, as Tesla, inorder to protect his secrets, did not commit his major inventions to paper, butdepended on an almost infallible memory for their preservation.“Telautomata,” he concluded, “will be ultimately produced, capable of acting asif possessed of their own intelligence and their advent will create arevolution. As early as 1898 I proposed to representatives of a largemanufacturing concern the construction and public exhibition of an automobilecarriage which, left to itself, would perform a great variety of operationsinvolving something akin to judgment. But my proposal was deemed chimerical atthat time and nothing came from it.”Tesla, at the Madison Square Garden demonstration in 1898 which lasted for aweek, presented to the world, then, two stupendous developments, either of whichalone would have been too gigantic to have been satisfactorily assimilated bythe public in a single presentation. Either one of the ideas dimmed the glory ofthe other.This first public demonstration of wireless, the forerunner of modern radio, inthe amazing stage of development to which Tesla carried it, at this early date,was too tremendous a project to be encompassed within a single dramatization. Inthe hands of a competent public-relations councillor, or publicity man, as hewas called in those days (but the employment of one was utterly abhorrent toTesla), this demonstration would have been limited to the wireless aspect alone,and would have included just a simple two-way sending-and-receiving set for thetransmission of messages by the Morse dots and dashes. Suitably dramatized, thiswould have been a sufficient thrill for one show. At a subsequent show he couldhave brought in the tuning demonstration which would have shown the selectiveresponse of each of a series of coils, indicated by his strange-lookingvacuum-tube lamps. The whole story of just the tuning of wireless circuits andstations to each other was too big for any one demonstration. An indication ofits possibilities was all the public could absorb.The robot, or automaton, idea was a new and an equally stupendous concept, thepossibilities of which were not lost, however, on clever inventors; for itbrought in the era of the modern labor-saving device—the mechanization ofindustry on a mass-production basis.Using the Tesla principles, John Hays Hammond, Jr. developed an electric dog, onwheels, that followed him like a live pup. It was motor operated and controlledby a light beam through selenium cells placed behind lenses used for eyes. Healso operated a yacht, entirely without a crew, which was sent out to sea fromBoston harbor and brought back to its wharf by wireless control.A manless airplane was developed toward the close of the First World War. Itrose from the ground, flew one hundred miles to a selected target, dropped itsbombs, and returned to its home airport, all by wireless control. It was alsodeveloped so that on a signal from a distant radio station the plane would riseinto the air, choose the proper direction, fly to a city hundreds of miles awayand set itself down in the airport at that city. This Tesla-type robot wasdeveloped in the plant of the Sperry Gyroscope Company, where Elmer Sperryinvented a host of amazing mechanical robots controlled by gyroscopes, such asthe automatic pilots for airplanes and for ships.All of the modern control devices using electronic tubes and electric eyes thatmake machines seem almost human and enable them to perform with superhumanactivity, dependability, accuracy and low cost, are children of Tesla’s robot,or automaton. The most recent development, in personalized form, was themechanical man, a metal human monster giant, that walked, talked, smoked acigarette, and obeyed spoken orders, in the exhibit of the Westinghouse Electricand Manufacturing Company at the New York World’s Fair. Robots have been used,as well, to operate hydroelectric powerhouses and isolated substations ofpowerhouses.In presenting this superabundance of scientific discovery in a singledemonstration, Tesla was manifesting the superman in an additional rôle thatpleased him greatly—that of the man. magnificent. He would astound the worldwith a superlative demonstration not only of the profundity of theaccomplishments of the superman, but, in addition, of the prolific nature of themind of the man magnificent who could shower on the world a superabundance ofscientific discoveries.* This figure may have been. 25 or 1. 5 horsepower. The notes are old andsomewhat indistinct. Memory favors the latter figure."},{"pageContent":"ELEVENimage [images/00003.jpg] TESLA was now ready for new worlds to conquer. After presenting to the publichis discoveries relating to wireless signaling or the transmission ofintelligence, as he called it, Tesla was anxious to get busy on the power phase:his projected world-wide distribution of power by wireless methods.Again Tesla was faced with a financial problem—or, to state the matter simply,he was broke. The $40,000 which was paid for the stock of the Nikola TeslaCompany by Adams had been spent. The company had no cash on hand; but it heldpatents worth many millions if they had been handled in a practical way. A giftof $10,000 from John Hays Hammond, the famous mining engineer, had financed thework leading up to the Madison Square Garden wireless and robot demonstration.Tesla had built ever larger and more powerful oscillators in his Houston Streetlaboratory. When he constructed one that produced 4,000,000 volts he reachedbeyond the limits in which high voltages could be handled within a citybuilding. The sparks jumped to the walls, floors and ceilings. He needed alarger open space. He wanted to build vastly larger coils. He dreamed of atremendous structure he would like to build somewhere in the open countryspaces. He felt certain his wireless patents would prove tremendously valuablein a short time, and he would then have all the money he needed to build hislaboratory. But he had already progressed to the point at which furtheradvancement demanded the use of such a building—and he was broke. A loan of$10,000 offered by his friend Crawford, of the dry goods firm of Simpson andCrawford, took care of immediate needs.Leonard E. Curtis, of the Colorado Springs Electric Company, a great admirer ofTesla, when he heard of Tesla’s plan to conduct experiments on a gigantic scale,invited him to locate his laboratory at Colorado Springs, where he would providehim with the necessary land and all the electric power he needed for his work.Col. John Jacob Astor, owner of the Waldorf-Astoria, held his famous dining-roomguest in the highest esteem as a personal friend, and kept in close touch withthe progress of his investigations. When he heard that his researches were beinghalted through lack of funds, he made available to Tesla the $30,000 he neededin order to take advantage of Curtis’ offer and build a temporary plant atColorado Springs. Tesla arrived in Colorado in May, 1899, bringing with him someof his laboratory workers, and accompanied by an engineering associate, FritzLowenstein.While Tesla was making experiments on natural lightning and other subjects inhis mountain laboratory, the construction work on his high-power transmittingapparatus was being rushed. He gave his personal supervision to even the finestdetails of every piece of apparatus. He was working in a virgin field. None hadgone before him to pave the way or gain experience that would be helpful to himin designing his experiments or his machines. He was entirely on his own,working without human guidance of any kind, exploring a field of knowledge farbeyond that which anyone else had reached. He had previously astounded the worldin developing a system of power transmission in which pressures of tens ofthousands of volts were used; now he was working with millions of volts, and noone knew what would happen when such tremendous potentials were produced. Hebelieved, however, that he would make his own magnificent polyphase systemobsolete by creating a better one.In about three months after his arrival at Colorado Springs the building withits fantastic shapes, towers and masts was completed, and the giant oscillatorwith which the principal experiment was to be made was ready for operation.The wild, rugged, mountainous terrain of Colorado, in which Tesla set up hislaboratory, is a natural generator of tremendous electrical activity, producinglightning discharges of a magnitude and intensity probably not equaled anywhereelse on earth. Overwhelming bolts from both earth and sky flashed withfrightening frequency during the almost daily lightning storms. Tesla made avery detailed study of natural lightning while his apparatus, which wouldimitate it, was being constructed. He learned a great deal about thecharacteristics of the various kinds of discharges.The gods of the natural lightning may have become a bit jealous of thisindividual who was undertaking to steal their thunder, as Prometheus had stolenfire, and sought to punish him by wrecking his fantastic looking structure. Itwas badly damaged, and narrowly escaped destruction, by a bolt of lightning, notone that made a direct hit but one that struck ten miles away.The blast hit the laboratory at the exact time, to the split second, that Teslapredicted it would. It was caused by a tidal wave of air coming from aparticular type of lightning discharge. Tesla tells the story in an unpublishedreport. He stated:I have had many opportunities for checking this value by observation ofexplosions and lightning discharges. An ideal case of this kind presented itselfat Colorado Springs in July 1899 while I was carring on tests with mybroadcasting power station which was the only wireless plant in existence atthat time.A heavy cloud had gathered over Pikes Peak range and suddenly lightning struckat a point just ten miles away. I timed the flash instantly and upon making aquick computation told my assistants that the tidal wave would arrive in 48. 5seconds. Exactly with the lapse of this time interval a terrific blow struck thebuilding which might have been thrown off the foundation had it not beenstrongly braced. All the windows on one side and a door were demolished and muchdamage done in the interior.Taking into account the energy of the electric discharge and its duration, aswell as that of an explosion, I estimated that the concussion was aboutequivalent to that which might have been produced at that distance by theignition of twelve tons of dynamite.The experimental station which Tesla erected was an almost square barnlikestructure nearly one hundred feet on each side. The sides were twenty-five feethigh, and from them the roof sloped upward toward the center. From the middle ofthe roof rose a skeleton pyramidal tower made of wood. The top of this tower wasnearly eighty feet above the ground. Extensions of the slanting roof beamsextended outward to the ground to serve as flying buttresses to reinforce thetower. Through the center of the tower extended a mast nearly two hundred feethigh, at the top of which was mounted a copper ball about three feet indiameter. The mast carried a heavy wire connecting the ball with the apparatusin the laboratory. The mast was arranged in sections so that it could bedisjointed and lowered.There were many pieces of apparatus in the building, and many forms and sizes ofhis Tesla coils, or high-frequency current transformers. The principal devicewas his “magnifying transmitter.” This was merely a very large Tesla coil. Acircular fence-like wall seventy-five feet in diameter was built in the largecentral room of the structure, and on this were wound the turns of the giantprimary coil of the magnifying transmitter. The secondary was a coil about tenfeet in diameter, of about seventy-five turns of wire wound on a cylindricalskeletonized framework of wood. It had a vertical length of about ten feet andwas mounted in the center of the room several feet above the floor. In thecenter of this coil was the bottom part of the mast. The roof above this portionof the room could be slid outward in two sections, so that no material camewithin a long distance of the mast and its wire conductor within the lower thirdof the distance above the ground.One of the first problems Tesla sought to solve when he began his researches inthe mountains of Colorado was whether the earth was an electrically chargedbody. Nature is usually very generous in her response when scientists ask her,in their experiments, questions of first magnitude. Tesla not only received avery satisfactory answer to his question but in addition a revelation oftremendous importance, an unveiling of a secret of Nature’s operations whichplaces in the hands of man a means of manipulating electrical forces on aterrestrial scale.It was desirable for Telsa to learn whether the earth was electrically chargedfor the same reason that a violinist would want to know whether the strings ofhis instrument lay loose and inert across the bridge or whether they were tenseand taut so that they would produce a musical note if plucked, or a footballplayer would want to know if the pigskin were inflated or limp.If the earth were uncharged, it would act as a vast sink into which electricitywould have to be flowed in tremendous amounts to bring it to the state in whichit could be made to vibrate electrically. An uncharged earth would somewhatcomplicate Tesla’s plans. He quickly discovered that the earth is charged to anextremely high potential and is provided with some kind of a mechanism formaintaining its voltage. It was while determining this fact that he made hissecond big discovery.Tesla made the first announcement of his discovery shortly after his return toNew York in an amazing article in the Century of June, 1900, but the story isbest told by Tesla in an article in the Electrical World and Engineer, May 5,1904:In the middle of June, while preparations for other work were going on, Iarranged one of my receiving transformers with the view of determining in anovel manner, experimentally, the electrical potential of the globe and studyingits periodic and casual fluctuations. This formed part of a plan carefullymapped out in advance.A highly sensitive, self restorative device, controlling a recording instrument,was included in the secondary circuit, while the primary was connected to theground and the secondary to an elevated terminal of adjustable capacity. Thevariations of electrical potential gave rise to electrical surgings in theprimary; these generated secondary currents, which in turn affected thesensitive device and recorder in proportion to their intensity.The earth was found to be, literally, alive with electrical vibrations, and soonI was deeply absorbed in this interesting investigation. No better opportunityfor such observations as I intended to make could be found anywhere.Colorado is a country famous for the natural displays of electric force. In thatdry and rarefied atmosphere the sun’s rays beat on objects with fierceintensity. I raised steam to a dangerous pressure, in barrels filled withconcentrated salt solution and the tinfoil coating of some of my elevatedterminals shrivelled in the fiery blaze. An experimental high tensiontransformer, carelessly exposed to the rays of the setting sun, had most of itsinsulating compound melted and was rendered useless.Aided by the dryness and rarefaction of the air, the water evaporates as in aboiler, and static electricity is generated in abundance. Lightning dischargesare, accordingly, very frequent and sometimes of inconceivable violence. On oneoccasion approximately 18,000 discharges occurred within two hours, and all inthe radius of certainly less than 50 kilometers [about 30 miles] from thelaboratory. Many of them resembled gigantic trees of fire with the trunks up ordown. I never saw fireballs, but as a compensation for my disappointment Isucceeded later in determining the mode of their formation and producing themartificially.In the latter part of the same month I noticed several times that my instrumentswere affected stronger by discharges taking place at great distances than bythose near by. This puzzled me very much. What was the cause? A number ofobservations proved that it could not be due to differences in the intensity ofindividual discharges and I readily ascertained that the phenomenon was not theresult of a varying relation between the periods of my receiving circuits andthose of the terrestrial disturbances.One night as I was walking home with an assistant, meditating over theseexperiences, I was suddenly staggered by a thought. Years ago when I wrote achapter of my lecture before the Franklin Institute and the National ElectricLight Association, it had presented itself to me, but I dismissed it as absurdand impossible. I banished it again. Nevertheless, my instinct was aroused andsomehow I felt that I was nearing a great revelation.It was on the 3rd of July [1899]—the date I shall never forget—when I obtainedthe first decisive experimental evidence of a truth of overwhelming importancefor the advancement of humanity.A dense mass of strongly charged clouds gathered in the west and toward eveninga violent storm broke loose which, after spending much of its fury in themountains, was driven away with great velocity over the plains. Heavy and longpersistent arcs formed almost in regular time intervals. My observations werenow greatly facilitated and rendered more accurate by the experiences alreadygained. I was able to handle my instruments quickly and I was prepared. Therecording apparatus being properly adjusted, its indications became fainter andfainter with increasing distance of the storm, until they ceased altogether.I was watching in eager expectation. Surely enough, in a little while theindications again began, grew stronger and stronger, and, after passing througha maximum, gradually decreased and ceased once more. Many times, in regularlyrecurring intervals, the same actions were repeated until the storm which, asevident from simple computations, was moving with nearly constant speed, hadretreated to a distance of about 300 kilometers [about 180 miles]. Nor did thesestrange actions stop then, but continued to manifest themselves withundiminished force.Subsequently similar observations were also made by my assistant, Mr. FritzLowenstein, and shortly afterward several admirable opportunities presentedthemselves which brought out, still more forcibly and unmistakably, the truenature of the wonderful phenomenon. No doubt whatever remained: I was observingstationary waves.As the source of the disturbances moved away the receiving circuit camesuccessively upon their nodes and loops. Impossible as it seemed, this planet,despite its vast extent, behaved like a conductor of limited dimensions. Thetremendous significance of this fact in the transmission of energy by my systemhad already become quite clear to me.Not only was it practicable to send telegraphic messages to any distance withoutwires, as I recognized long ago, but also to impress upon the entire globe thefaint modulations of the human voice, far more still, to transmit power, inunlimited amounts to any terrestrial distance and almost without loss.To get a more familiar picture of the problem that Tesla tackled in seeking todetermine if the earth were charged and if it could be set into electricalvibration, one can visualize the difference between a bath tub that is empty andone that contains water. The uncharged earth would be like an empty tub; thecharged earth like one containing water. It is easy to produce waves in the tubcontaining the water. By placing one’s hand in the water and moving it back andforth, lengthwise, a short distance at the right rhythm, the water is soonrushing back and forth in a wave whose amplitude grows at a tremendously rapidrate until, if the hand motion is continued, the water may splash as high as theceiling.The earth can be visualized as an extremely large container holding a fluid; andin the center is a small plunger arrangement which can be moved up and down ashort distance in the proper rhythm. The waves travel to the edge of thecontainer and are reflected back to the center, from which they again go outwardre-enforced by the movement of the plunger.The reaction between the outgoing and incoming waves, both in resonance with themedium in which they are traveling, causes stationary waves to be produced onthe water, the surface having the appearance of a single series of waves frozenin a fixed position.In Tesla’s experiments the lightning discharges that played the part of theplunger causing the waves were moving rapidly to the eastward, and they carriedthe whole series of fixed, or stationary, waves with them. The measuring deviceremained fixed so the wave series, with its loops and nodes, moved past it,causing the measured potentials to rise and fall.The experiment not only demonstrated that the earth was filled with electricity,but that this electricity could be disturbed so that rhythmic vibrations couldbe struck, resonance could be produced, causing effects of tremendous magnitude.Soldiers marching in unison across a bridge and wrecking it by the resultingvibration would again be a case in point.Tesla produced the spectacular effects of extremely high potentials and highfrequency by producing electrical resonance in his circuits—by tuning theelectricity—and now he had discovered that he would be able to produce, easily,the same effect in the earth as if it were a single condenser and coil combined,a pure electrical resonating unit, by charging and discharging it rhythmicallywith his high-frequency, high-potential oscillations.In this magnificent experiment Tesla the superman was at his best; the boldnessof his undertaking fired the imagination, and the success he achieved shouldhave earned for him undying fame.EVENTUALLY, the giant coils with their banks of condensers and other apparatusin the Colorado laboratory were ready for use in full-scale experiments. Everypiece of equipment was thoroughly inspected and tested by Tesla—and the momenthad finally arrived for the critical test of the highest voltage experiment thathad ever been made. He expected to top his own earlier records one hundred timesover, and to produce tens of thousands of times higher voltages than ever hadbeen produced in the high-voltage transmission lines at Niagara Falls.There was not the faintest shadow of doubt in Tesla’s mind as to whether hisgiant oscillator would work. He knew it would work, but he also knew that he wasgoing to produce millions of volts and tremendously heavy currents; and neitherhe nor anyone else knew how these terrific explosions of electrical energy wouldact. He knew that he had planned the experiment so that the first bolts ofman-made lightning ever created would shoot from the top of the 200-foot-tallmast.Tesla asked Kolman Czito, who had worked with him for many years in hislaboratories in New York, to preside at the switchboard through which currentwas brought into the laboratory from the powerhouse of the Colorado SpringsElectric Company by an overhead transmission line two miles long.“When I give you the word,” said Tesla to Czito, “you close the switch for onesecond—not longer.”The inventor took a position near the door of the laboratory from which he couldview the giant coil in the center of the great barnlike room—but not too closeto it, for a stray bolt of his own lightning might inflict a painful burn. Fromthe point where he stood he could look upward toward the open roof and see thethree-foot copper ball on top of the slender 200-foot mast that had its base inthe center of the cagelike secondary coil. A quick visual survey of thesituation, and Tesla gave the signal—“Now.”Czito jammed home the switch and as quickly pulled it out. In that briefinterval the secondary coil was crowned with a mass of hairlike electrical fire,there was a crackling sound in various parts of the room and a sharp snap faroverhead.“Fine,” said Tesla, “the experiment is working beautifully. We will try it againin exactly the same way. Now!”Again Czito jammed home the switch for a second and opened it. Again the plumesof electrical fire came from the coil, minor sparks crackled in all parts of thelaboratory and the very sharp snap came through the open roof from far overhead.“This time,” said Tesla, “I am going to watch the top of the mast from theoutside. When I give you the signal I want you to close the switch and leave itclosed until I give you the signal to open it.” So saying, he started for thenear-by open door.Reaching a point outside from which he could see the copper ball on top of theneedlelike mast, Tesla called through the door, “Czito, close the switch—Now!”Czito again jammed the switch closed and jumped back—but held his arm extendedto yank open the blades quickly should he receive an emergency signal. Nothingmuch had happened on the quick-contact closing, but now the apparatus would begiven an opportunity to build up its full strength and no one knew what toexpect. He knew that the apparatus would draw a very heavy current through aprimary coil that looked like a “short circuit,” and he knew that short circuitscould be very destructive if the current was allowed to continue to flow. Theswitchboard could become a scene of interesting activity if anything let go.Czito expected the quick flash and explosive blast of a short circuit a secondor two after the switch was closed. Several seconds passed with no shortcircuit.As soon as the switch was closed there came again the same crackling sound, thesame snap high in the air that he had heard before. Now it was followed by atremendous upsurge of sound. The crackling from the coil swelled into acrescendo of vicious snaps. From above the roof the original staccato snap wasfollowed by a sharper one—and by another that was like the report of a rifle.The next was still louder. They came closer together like the rattle of amachine gun. The bang high in the air became tremendously louder; it was now theroar of a cannon, with the discharges rapidly following each other as if agigantic artillery battle was taking place over the building. The sound wasterrifying and the thunder shook the building in most threatening fashion.There was a strange ghostly blue light in the great barnlike structure. Thecoils were flaming with masses of fiery hair. Everything in the building wasspouting needles of flame, and the place filled with the sulphurous odor ofozone, fumes of the sparks, which was all that was needed to complete theconviction that hell was breaking loose and belching into the building.As Czito stood near the switch he could feel and see the sparks jump from hisfingers, each pricking like a needle stuck into his flesh. He wondered if hewould be able to reach for the switch and turn off the power that was creatingthis electrical pandemonium—would the sparks become longer and more powerful ifhe approached the switch? Must this head-splitting racket go on forever? It’sgetting worse, that tremendous ear-wrecking bang, bang, bang overhead. Whydoesn’t Tesla stop it before it shakes down the building? Should he open theswitch of his own accord? Maybe Tesla has been hit, perhaps killed, and can’tgive orders to open the switch!It seemed to Czito that the demonstration had been going on for an hour but as amatter of fact it had lasted thus far for only a minute; nevertheless, atremendous amount of activity had been crowded into that short space of time.Outside stood Tesla, properly attired in cutaway coat and black derby hat forthe auspicious occasion, his slender six-foot-two figure bearing signs of closerelationship to the mastlike rod sticking out of his bizarre barnlike structure.His height was increased by a one-inch-thick layer of rubber on the soles andheels of his shoes, used as electrical insulation.As he gave the switch-closing “Now” signal to Czito, he turned his eyesheavenward to the ball on top of the mast. He had hardly spoken when he saw ashort hairlike spark dart from the ball. It was only about ten feet long, andthin. Before he had time to be pleased, there was a second and a third and afourth spark, each longer, brighter and bluer than its predecessor.“Ah!” ejaculated Tesla, forgetting to close his mouth that was widely opened fora shout. He clenched his hands for joy and raised them skyward toward the top ofthe mast.More sparks! Longer and longer! Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty,seventy, eighty feet. Brighter and bluer! Not threadlike sparks now but fingersof fire. Wriggling rods of flame that lashed viciously into the heavens. Thesparks were now as thick as his arm as they left the ball.Tesla’s eyes almost popped out of his head as he saw full-fledged bolts oflightning darting into the air, accompanied by a barrage of tremendous crashesof thunder. Those lightning bolts were now half again the length of thebuilding, more than 135 feet long, and the thunder was being heard in CrippleCreek fifteen miles away.Suddenly—silence!Tesla rushed into the building.“Czito! Czito! Czito! Why did you do that? I did not tell you to open theswitch. Close it again quickly!”Czito pointed at the switch. It was still closed. He then pointed at thevoltmeter and ammeter on the switchboard. The needles of both of them registeredzero.Tesla sized up the situation instantly. The incoming wires carrying power to thelaboratory were “dead.”“Czito,” he snapped, “call up the powerhouse quickly. They must not do that.They have cut off my power.”The telephone call was put through to the powerhouse. Tesla grabbed the phoneand shouted into it:“This is Nikola Tesla. You have cut off my power! You must give me back powerimmediately! You must not cut off my power.”“Cut off your power, nothing,” came the gruff reply from the other end of theline. “You’ve thrown a short circuit on our line with your blankety-blank-blankexperiments and wrecked our station. You’ve knocked our generator off the lineand she’s now on fire. You won’t get any more power!”Tesla had built his apparatus substantially, so that it would be able to carrythe tremendously heavy currents he expected to draw off the line. While his ownequipment was able to stand what amounted to a heavy short circuit, he hadoverloaded the generator at the Colorado Springs Electric Company powerhouse,which tried manfully to carry the added burden—but the heavy surge of currentwas too much for the dynamo that was not designed to stand such heavy overloads.Its wires became hotter and hotter, and finally the insulation took fire and thecopper wire in the armature coils melted like wax, opening its circuits so thatit ceased to generate electricity.The powerhouse had a second, standby, generator which was started up in a shorttime. Tesla was insistent that he be supplied with current from this machine assoon as it was running, but his demand was refused. In the future, he was told,he would be supplied with current from a dynamo operated independently from theone supplying the company’s regular customers. The independent dynamo, he wastold, would be the one that was already burned out—and he would get no serviceuntil it was repaired. Tesla offered to pay the cost of an extra-special rushjob on the repairs if he were permitted to handle the work. Alternating-currentdynamos were no mystery to him. Taking his workers from the laboratory to thepowerhouse he soon had the repair job under way, and in less than a week thedynamo was again operating.A LIGHTNING stroke produces its spectacular pyrotechnics and earth-vibratingeffects with less than a nickel’s worth of electricity—at a five-cent-a-kilowatthour rate, which is somewhat less than the average household rate for current.It consists of tremendously heavy currents, many thousands of amperes atmillions of volts, but it lasts only a few millionths of a second. If suppliedwith this “nickel’s worth” of current continuously, the lightning flash wouldlast indefinitely.Tesla, in his Colorado Springs laboratory, was pumping a steady flow of currentworth, at the above rate, about $15. 00 an hour into the earth. In an hour hecharged the earth with several hundred times as much electrical energy as iscontained in a single lightning stroke. Owing to resonance phenomena, he couldbuild up electrical effects in the earth greatly exceeding those of lightningsince it was only necessary, once resonance was established, to supply energyequal to frictional losses, in order to maintain this condition.In describing his work with the giant oscillator, Tesla, using conservativeestimates of his results, stated in his article in the Century Magazine of June,1900:However extraordinary the results shown may appear, they are but triflingcompared with those attainable by apparatus designed on these same principles. Ihave produced electrical discharges the actual path of which, from end to end,was probably more than 100 feet long; but it would not be difficult to reachlengths 100 times as great.I have produced electrical movements occurring at the rate of approximately100,000 horsepower, but rates of one, five or ten million horsepower. are easilypracticable. In these experiments effects were developed incomparably greaterthan ever produced by any human agencies, and yet these results are but anembryo of what is to be.The method used by Tesla to set the earth in electrical oscillation is theelectrical counterpart of the mechanical device previously described, theplunger bobbing up and down at the right rhythm that created the stationarywaves in the water.Tesla used a stream of electrons which were pumped into and drawn out of theearth at a rapid rhythmic rate. At the time the experiments were made, theelectron still was not known to be the fundamental atom of electricity, so theoperation was spoken of simply as the flow of electricity.The pumping operation was carried on at a rate of 150,000 oscillations persecond. These would produce electrical pulsations with a wavelength of 2,000meters (about 6, 600 feet).When the moving waves expanded outward from Colorado Springs, they traveled inall directions in ever increasing circles until they passed over the bulge ofthe earth, and then in ever smaller circles and with increasing intensityconverged on the diametrically opposite point of the earth, a trifle to the westof the two French islands, Amsterdam and St. Paul, in the area between theIndian and Antarctic Oceans midway between the southern tip of Africa and thesouthwest corner of Australia. Here a tremendous electrical south pole was builtup, marked by a wave of great amplitude that rose and fell in unison withTesla’s apparatus at its north pole in Colorado Springs. As this wave fell, itsent back an electrical echo which produced the same effect at Colorado Springs.Just as it arrived back at Colorado Springs, the oscillator was working to buildup a wave that would re-enforce it and send it back more powerfully than beforeto the antipode to repeat the performance.If there were no losses in this operation—if the earth were a perfect electricalconductor, and there were no other sources of resistance—this resonancephenomenon would build up to a destructive action of gigantic proportions, evenwith the charging source of only about 300 horsepower which Tesla used. Voltagesof gigantic magnitudes would be built up. Charged particles of matter would behurled outward from the earth with vast energies, and eventually even the solidmatter of the earth would be affected and the whole planet disintegrated. Pureresonance, however, is not attainable. Tesla frequently stressed the fortunatenature of this fact; for otherwise disastrous results could be produced by smallamounts of energy. The electrical resistance of the globe would prevent theattainment of pure resonance; but practical resonance can be attained withsafety by supplying continuously the amount of energy lost in resistance—andthis supplies perfect control of the situation.With the earth set in electrical oscillation, a source of energy is provided atall spots on the earth. This could be drawn off and made available for use by asuitable simple apparatus which would contain the same elements as the tuningunit in a radio set, but larger (a coil and a condenser), a ground connectionand metal rod as high as a cottage. Such a combination would absorb, at anypoint on the earth’s surface, energy from the waves rushing back and forthbetween the electrical north and south poles created by the Tesla oscillators.No other equipment would be needed to supply light to the home, provided withTesla’s simple vacuum-tube lamps, or to produce heating effects.*The apparatus that Tesla used to charge the earth is very simple in principle.In its elementary form it consists of a circuit containing a large coil andcondenser of the correct electrical dimensions to give it the desired frequencyof oscillation, a source of electric current for energizing the circuit, and astep-up transformer, also tuned, for increasing the voltage.The current of a few hundred volts obtained from the powerhouse was stepped upby an ordinary iron box transformer to more than 30,000 volts and at thispotential was fed into a condenser which, when filled, discharged into the coilconnected across its terminals. The rate of the back-and-forth surge of currentfrom condenser into coil and coil back to condenser, in endless repetition, isdetermined by the capacity of the condenser for holding current and the length,or inductance, of the coil through which the discharge must travel. An arcbetween the joint terminals of condenser and coil completed the free oscillatingpath of the high-frequency current.In an oscillating circuit the current is at zero value at the start of eachcycle, rises to a high value and drops to zero again at the end of each halfcycle. The voltage does the same. Both build up to high values at the midpointof each half cycle.The coil through which the current flows is surrounded by a magnetic fieldproduced by the current. With heavy current flows, these fields can become veryextensive and of high intensity, particularly at the midpoint in each halfcycle.The primary coil, or energizing circuit of Tesla’s oscillator, consisted of anumber of turns of heavy wire mounted on a circular fence eighty feet indiameter in the great hall of his laboratory. In the space within this fencedenclosure the magnetic field built up to a crescendo of intensity with each halfcycle of the current in the primary coil. As the magnetic circles of force movedto the center of the enclosure, they became more concentrated and built up ahigh density of energy in space in this region.Centered in this area was another coil perfectly tuned to vibrate electricallyin resonance with the crescendo of energy in which it was immersed 300,000 timesper second. This coil—about ten feet in diameter, consisting of nearly onehundred turns on a cagelike frame about ten feet high—in responding resonantly,built up potentials with maximum values of more than 100,000,000 volts. Noscientist has ever succeeded in building up currents with even one tenth of thispotential since that time.When the first surge of magnetic energy crashed into this coil, it caused adownward avalanche of electrons from the coil into the earth, thereby inflatingthe earth electrically and raising its potential. The next surge of magneticenergy was of the opposite polarity and caused a tidal wave of electrons fromthe earth to rush through the coil and upward to the terminal of the coil, whichwas the metal ball mounted on the mast 200 feet high.The downward flood of electrons was spread over the wide area of the earth butthe return upward flood was concentrated on a small metal ball on top of themast, upon which tremendously high potentials developed. The electrons on theball were under explosive electrical pressure and were forced to escape. Theymade a spearpoint of attack on the surrounding air, broke a small opening, andthrough this rushed uncounted billions of billions of electrons, their madstampede rendering their path through the air incandescent for a distance ofscores of feet—in other words, producing a flash of lightning.Having thus succeeded in making the earth oscillate as if it were a piece oflaboratory apparatus, Tesla would now proceed to test the practical applicationsof his unique method of worldwide power transmission.*THE full story of Tesla’s accomplishments at Colorado Springs has never beentold and never will be told. He carried the records, engraved on his almostinfallible memory, with him when he died. Fritz Lowenstein, a competentelectrical engineer, interested in high-frequency currents, was his assistant atColorado Springs. Tesla, however, took neither Lowenstein nor anyone else intohis confidence.It was not necessary for Tesla to write the detailed records of experimentswhich scientists and engineers make, as routine, of their laboratory tests. Hepossessed a most remarkable memory, supplemented by his strange power ofvisualizing again, in their full aspects of reality, any past events. He neededno reference books, for he could quickly derive any desired formula from basicconcepts; and he even carried a table of logarithms in his head. For thesereasons there is a great lack of written records on his experiments, and what isrecorded is mostly of a minor nature.Fundamental facts of great importance that he intended to develop later in apractical manner were stored in the archives of his mind to await the time whenhe would be able to present a practical working model of the inventions based onhis discoveries. He had no fear that he would be anticipated by others becausehe was so far in advance of his contemporaries that he could safely bide histime for developing his ideas.It was Tesla’s intention to make the development of his discoveries a one-manjob. He was completely confident, at this time, of his ability to live a centuryand a quarter, and to be actively engaged in creative experimental work up to atleast his one-hundredth birthday, at which time he would give serious thought tothe task of writing his biography and a complete record of his experimentalwork. Up to almost his eightieth year he adhered to this plan without doubt asto its ultimate consummation.As a result of this most unfortunate design, technical details are lackingconcerning the principal discoveries made at Colorado Springs. By piecingtogether the fragmentary material published in a number of publications,however, it appears evident that Tesla, in addition to experiments with hisgigantic current movements, as a means of establishing world-wide broadcasts andmaking a number of detectors for such use, tested his power-transmission systemat a distance of twenty-six miles from his laboratory and was able to light twohundred incandescent lamps, of the Edison type, with electrical energy extractedfrom the earth while his oscillator was operating. These lamps consumed aboutfifty watts each; and if two hundred were used in the test bank, the energyconsumed would be 10,000 watts, or approximately thirteen horsepower.Transmission of thirteen horsepower wirelessly through the earth for a distanceof twenty-six miles can be accepted as a very adequate demonstration of thepracticability of Tesla’s plan. He claimed an efficiency of higher than 95 percent for this method of energy transmission; so he could, undoubtedly, with a300 horsepower oscillator, operate more than a dozen such test demonstrationssimultaneously anywhere on the globe. With respect to the latter point hestated, “In this new system it matters little—in fact, almost nothing—whetherthe transmission is effected at a distance of a few miles, or of a few thousandmiles.”“While I have not as yet,” he stated in the Century article of June, 1900,“actually effected a transmission of a considerable amount of energy, such aswould be of industrial importance, to a great distance by this new method, Ihave operated several model plants under exactly the same conditions which willexist in a large plant of this kind, and the practicability of the system isthoroughly demonstrated.”Tesla was insistent, in his latter decades, on the existence, the actuality, theimportance and availability of many undisclosed discoveries which he made atColorado Springs. The author urged upon Tesla two or three times thedesirability of making a disclosure, against the ever present danger of anaccident that might cause them to be lost to the world; and when the inventorwas unimpressed by this possibility, he was asked to permit the author to dosomething that would bring about their practical development. Tesla wascourteously appreciative of the interest manifested, but he was very emphatic inhis insistence that he would handle his own affairs as he saw fit, and that heexpected shortly to have adequate funds to develop his inventions.TESLA returned to New York, in the fall of 1899, broke once more, but with theknowledge that his efforts had greatly enriched humanity with importantscientific discoveries. Yet even more important was the new attitude his workhad made possible: man had achieved a method through which he could control hisgigantic planet, could look upon this heavenly body from the godlike vantagepoint in which he could view it as a piece of laboratory apparatus to bemanipulated as he willed.The pictures which Tesla brought back to New York showing the giganticelectrical discharges from his oscillator, and the stories he related of hisexperiences, created a tremendous impression in his circle of friends. It wasthen that Robert Underwood Johnson, one of the editors of the Century Magazine,at whose home in Madison Avenue, in the exclusive Murray Hill section, Tesla wasa frequent and informal visitor, requested the inventor to write an articletelling of his accomplishments.When the article was written, Johnson returned it, telling Tesla he had served amess of cold philosophical stones instead of a dish of hot throbbing facts. Theinventor had made but scant reference to his recent astounding accomplishments,but developed instead a philosophical system in which the progress of humanitywas viewed as purely a mechanical process, activated by the sources of energyavailable. Three times the article went back to Tesla and was as many timesrewritten, despite the high literary quality of the work on each occasion.The article, which carried the title “The Problem of Increasing Human Energy,”created a sensation. Among those whose interest it aroused was J. PierpontMorgan—a most fortunate circumstance for Tesla. The great financier had a softspot for geniuses, and Tesla was a perfect example of the species.Morgan the financier was famous, but Morgan the philanthropist, a greaterpersonality, was to the general public non-existent, so carefully guardedagainst publicity were his benefactions. In this he was not always completelysuccessful for there are, of necessity, two parties to a beneficence, the giverand the receiver; and the pride and gratitude of the latter can develop into aweak spot in the shell of secrecy.Tesla was invited to Morgan’s home and quickly became a. favorite with thefamily. His record of accomplishment which promised still greater achievementsin the future, his pleasant personality, his high moral standards of conduct,his celibate manner of life and his manner of subordinating himself to his work,his boylike enthusiasm, were factors that caused him to be admired not only byMorgan but by all others who knew him well.Morgan made inquiries of Tesla concerning his financial structure. There were,in those days, a limited number of strong financial groups who were playing aterrestrial game of chess with the world’s economic resources; the discoveriesof a genius like Tesla might well have a profound effect on the destinies of oneor more of these groups, and it would be well for an operator in this field toknow more of the inventor’s commitments. Undoubtedly, it was a source ofsurprise and satisfaction to Morgan when he learned that Tesla was a loneoperator and now entirely without funds needed to carry on his researches.Morgan knew well the inestimable value of Tesla’s polyphase alternating-currentsystem. The Niagara development was a Morgan enterprise, and gigantic plans werebeing builded on its already proven success. The man who laid the scientific andengineering foundation for this new and profitable industrial electrical era wasbroke and engaged in developing a new source of power distribution. He hadsupplanted Edison’s half-mile power pygmy with a giant having a thousand-milerange, and now he was working on a system which experiments had shown coulddistribute power wirelessly to the ends of the earth with but a small fractionof the losses of the Edison system in distributing power by wire for half amile, and could even send current around the earth cheaper than his ownalternating-current system could distribute it at a distance of one hundredmiles. The ecolomic implications of this development staggered the imaginaion.What effect would it have on the chess game being played by the world’sfinancial groups?Would the new wireless-distribution-of-power system fit into the existingeconomic and financial structure? Could it be usefully applied withoutderangements of greater magnitude than the benefits it would produce? If it wereadopted for development, who would be best suited to control it? Could it becontrolled in a practical way when any spot on earth would be an outlet for anunlimited reservoir of power for anyone who cared to tap it with a simpledevice? How could compensation be collected for the service rendered?These were some of the most obvious aspects of Tesla’s world power system thatwould instantly present themselves to the practical mind of Morgan. In addition,Tesla was proposing a world-wide broadcasting system for distributing news,entertainment, knowledge, and a host of other interesting items. Morgan couldwell understand the practical aspects of wireless communication in which acharge could be made for transmitting messages from point to point, which was apart of the Tesla system—but, to the inventor’s way of thinking, only a minorpart compared to the more important broadcasting and power-distribution systems.A Morgan would understand that ingenious minds could work out some method forplacing such world-wide services on a practical profit-paying basis; but thiswhole new Tesla development had a fantastical aspect that was upsetting toso-called “practical” minds not accustomed to thinking first-magnitude thoughts.The new system might prove more important than the polyphase system which wentas a record-breaking bargain to Westinghouse for $1,000,000. Westinghouse wasthen the most powerful competitor of the Edison system which Morgan had backed,and particularly of the General Electric Company whose financing Morgan hadarranged. Although Westinghouse secured a monopoly, means were found for causinghim to share it, by a license agreement, with the General Electric Company, sothe Morgan company had equal opportunities to exploit the rich market.History might now be repeating itself with the same inventor, who now had ahypersuperpower system to supplant his own superpower system. In this caseMorgan could place himself in a position to seize the monopoly of world power.The group holding a monopoly control over such a system could develop it, or notdevelop it, as it saw fit; it could be developed to produce a profit bysupplanting or supplementing the satisfactory wire distribution system, or itcould be put on the shelf to prevent it from interfering with the existingsystem. A monopoly of it could prevent any other group from securing it andusing it as a club to force concessions from those controlling existingenterprises. Ownership of the Tesla world-power and world-broadcasting patentsmight well prove an extremely profitable investment even if a very high pricewere paid for them.But there was also a more subtle viewpoint. Without a strong backing by apowerful source of capital, a world-wide system such as Tesla proposed couldnever be brought into operating existence. If a powerful group had anopportunity to get in on the ground floor and secure monopoly control and failedto do so, and let it become apparent that this was done intentionally, theeffect of such a decision could easily result in scaring off any other groupsand effectually preventing anyone from ever backing the system.Morgan, however, in his contacts with Tesla, brought no commercial or practicalaspects into the situation. His interest was entirely that of a patron seekingto aid a genius to express his creative talents. He made gifts to Tesla to whichthere were no strings attached. The inventor could use the money as he saw fit.No definite information is available as to the amount of those contributions,but an authoritative source, close to Tesla, fixes the amount which he receivedwithin a very short period at $150,000. Later contributions, spread over a longperiod of years, are believed to have brought the total to double this amount.Tesla made no secret of Morgan’s support. He stated, in the article in theElectrical World and Engineer, published March 5, 1904, describing his wirelesspower work up to that time:“For a large part of the work which I have done so far I am indebted to thenoble generosity of Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan, which was all the more welcome andstimulating, as it was extended at a time when those, who have since promisedmost, were the greatest of doubters.”When Morgan made his first contribution, the rumor got into circulation that hewas financially interested in the enterprise upon which Tesla now embarked. Theresulting situation contained some elements of usefulness for Tesla because ofthe tremendous prestige of the financier. When, however, Tesla later foundhimself critically in need of funds, and it became apparent that Morgan was notfinancially involved in the project and apparently was not coming to the rescueof the inventor, then the reaction set in and the situation became distinctlyand definitely unsatisfactory.In 1900, however, Tesla had $150,000 on hand and a gigantic idea to be put intooperation. The world-shaking superman, riding his tidal wave of fame andpopularity, set to work.* For the operation of ordinary-type motors, a frequency changer would beneeded. Tesla, indeed, developed ironless motors that would operate onhigh-frequency currents, but they could not compete in efficiency with motorsoperated on low-frequency currents. Frequency transformation, however, is now avery practical operation.* In describing the mode of transmission of his oscillating currents through theearth, Tesla claimed the path of the discharge was from his station directlythrough the center of the earth and in a straight line to the antipode, thereturn being by the same route, and that the current on this straight-line pathtraveled at its normal velocity—the speed of light. This flow, he declared,produced an accompanying surface flow of current, which was in step at thestarting point and when they rejoined at the antipode; and this necessitatedhigher velocities in flowing over the surface of the earth. The surfacevelocities would be infinite at each of the antipodes, and would decreaserapidly until at the equatorial region of this axis it would travel at thenormal velocity of the currents.This theory is probably incorrect, the flow probably being confined to thesurface, and taking place at the normal velocity of the electric current; butthis, however, had no effect on the practical operation of Tesla’s oscillatorsin producing their earth-charging effect."},{"pageContent":"THIRD PART [index_split_004.html#filepos4666] INTERNAL VIBRATION [index_split_004.html#filepos4666]"},{"pageContent":"TWELVEimage [images/00003.jpg] THE year 1900 marked to Tesla not only the opening of a new century but also thebeginning of the world-superpower and radio-broadcasting era. With theencouragement of J. P. Morgan to spur him on—if he could accommodate any morespurring than his own inner drive furnished—and with $150,000 in cash from thesame source, he was set to embark upon a gigantic venture, the building of aworld wireless-power and a world broadcasting station.The cash on hand would be totally inadequate to finance the project tocompletion, but this did not deter him from making a start. He needed alaboratory both to replace the Houston Street establishment, which had becomeentirely inadequate, and to include equipment of the type employed at ColoradoSprings, but designed for use in the actual world-broadcasting process. Thelocation was determined as the result of an arrangement he made with James S.Warden, manager and director of the Suffolk County Land Company, a lawyer andbanker from the West who had acquired two thousand acres of land at Shoreham, inSuffolk County, Long Island, about sixty miles from New York. The land was madethe basis of a real-estate development under the name Wardencliff.Tesla visualized a power-and-broadcasting station which would employ thousandsof persons. He undertook the establishment, eventually, of a Radio City,something far more ambitious than the enterprise in Rockefeller Center in NewYork which bears this name today. Tesla planned to have all wavelength channelsbroadcast from a single station, a project which would have given him a completemonopoly of the radio-broadcasting business. What an opportunity near-sightedbusinessmen of his day overlooked in not getting in on his project! But in thatday Tesla was about the only one who visualized modern broadcasting. Everyoneelse visualized wireless as being useful only for sending telegraphiccommunications between ship and shore and across the ocean.Mr. Warden saw possibilities of a sort in Tesla’s plan, however, and offered hima tract of two hundred acres, of which twenty acres were cleared, for his powerstation, with the expectation that the two thousand men who would shortly beemployed in the station would build homes on convenient sites in the remainderof the 2,000-acre tract. Tesla accepted.Stanford White, the famous designer of many churches and other architecturalmonuments throughout the country, was one of Tesla’s friends. He now disclosedto the famous architect his vision of an industrial “city beautiful” and soughthis co-operation in realizing his dream. Mr. White was enthusiastic about theidea and, as his contribution to Tesla’s work, offered to underwrite the cost ofdesigning the strange tower the inventor sketched, and all of the architecturalwork involved in the general plan for the city. The actual work was done by W.D. Crow, of East Orange, N. J., one of Mr. White’s associates, who later becamefamous as a designer of hospitals and other institutional buildings.It was a fantastic-looking tower, with strange structural limitations, which Mr.Crow found himself designing. Tesla required a tower, about 154 feet high, tosupport at its peak a giant copper electrode 100 feet in diameter and shapedlike a gargantuan doughnut with a tubular diameter of twenty feet. (This waslater changed to a hemispherical electrode.)The tower would have to be a skeletonized structure, built almost entirely ofwood, metal to be reduced to an utter minimum and any metal fixtures employed tobe of copper. No engineering data were available on wood structures of thisheight and type. The structure Tesla required had a large amount of “sail area,”or surface exposed to wind, concentrated at the top, creating stresses that hadto be provided for in a tower that itself possessed only limited stability. Mr.Crow solved the engineering problems and then the equally difficult task ofincorporating esthetic qualities in such an edifice.When the design was completed another difficulty was encountered. None of thewell-known builders could be induced to undertake the task of erecting thetower. A competent framer, associated with Norcross Bros., who were a largecontracting firm in those days, finally took over the contract, although he,too, expressed fears that the winter gales might overturn the structure.* Thetower was completed in 1902, and with it a large low brick building more than100 feet square which would provide quarters for the powerhouse and laboratory.While the structures were being built, Tesla commuted every day from theWaldorf-Astoria to Wardencliff, arriving at the near-by Shoreham station shortlyafter eleven A.M. and remaining until three-thirty. He was always accompanied bya man servant, a Serbian, who carried a heavy hamper filled with food. When thelaboratory transferred from Houston Street was in full operation atWarden-cliff, Tesla rented the Bailey cottage near the Long Island Sound shoreand there made his home for a year.The heavy equipment, the dynamos and motors, that Tesla desired for his plantwere of an unusual design not produced by manufacturers, and he encountered manyvexatious delays in securing such material. He was able to carry on a wide rangeof high-frequency current and other experiments in his new laboratory, but theprincipal project, that of setting up the worldwide broadcasting station,lagged. Meanwhile, he had a number of glass blowers making tubes for use intransmitting and receiving his broadcast programs. This was a dozen years beforeDe Forest invented the form of radio tube now in general use. The secret ofTesla’s tubes died with him.Tesla seemed to be entirely fearless of his high-frequency currents of millionsof volts. He had, nevertheless, the greatest respect for the electric current inall forms, and was extremely careful in working on his apparatus. When workingon circuits that might come “alive,” he always worked with one hand in hispocket, using the other to manipulate tools. He insisted that all of his workersdo likewise when working on the 60-cycle low-frequency alternating-currentcircuits, whether the potential was 50,000 or 110 volts. This safeguard reducedthe possibility of a dangerous current finding a circuit through the arms acrossthe body, where there was chance that it might stop the action of the heart.In spite of the great care which he manifested in all of his experimental work,he had a narrow escape from losing his life at the Wardencliff plant. He wasmaking experiments on the properties of small-diameter jets of water moving athigh velocity and under very high pressures, of the order of 10,000 pounds persquare inch. Such a stream could be struck by a heavy iron bar without thestream being disrupted. The impinging bar would bounce back as if it had struckanother solid iron bar—a strange property for a mechanically weak substance likewater. The cylinder holding the water under high pressure was a heavy one madeof wrought iron. Tesla was unable to secure a wrought-iron cap for the uppersurface, so he used a heavier one of cast iron, a more brittle metal. One daywhen he raised the pressure to a point higher than he had previously used, thecylinder exploded. The cast-iron cap broke and a large fragment shot within afew inches of his face as it went on a slanting path upward and finally crashedthrough the roof. The high-pressure stream of water had peculiar destructiveeffects on anything with which it came in contact, even tough, strong metals.Tesla never revealed the purpose or the results of these high-pressureexperiments.Tesla’s insistence on the utmost neatness in his laboratory almost resulted in atragedy through a case of thoughtlessness on the part of an assistant.Arrangements were being made for installing a heavy piece of machinery which wasto be lag bolted to the thick concrete floor. Holes had been drilled in theconcrete. The plan called for pouring molten lead into these holes and screwingthe heavy bolts into the metal when it cooled. As soon as the holes weredrilled, a young assistant starting cleaning up the débris. He not only swept upthe stone chips and dust: he got a mop and thoroughly washed that area of thefloor, thoughtlessly letting some of the water get into the holes. He then driedthe floor. In the meantime Tesla and George Scherff, who was his financialsecretary but also served in any way in which he could be helpful, were meltingthe lead which would hold the lag screws in the holes in the floor. Scherff tookthe first large ladleful of lead from the furnace and started across thelaboratory to where the holes had been drilled, followed shortly by Teslabearing another ladle.Scherff bent down—and as he poured the hot liquid metal into one of the holes anexplosion followed instantly. The molten lead was blown upward into his face ina shower of searing hot drops of liquid metal. The water which the assistantused to swab the floor had settled into the holes and, when the melted lead comein contact with it, it was changed to steam which shot the lead out of the holelike a bullet out of the barrel of a rifle. Both men were showered with drops ofhot metal and dropped their ladles. Tesla, being several feet away, was onlyslightly injured; but Scherff was very seriously burned about the face andhands. Drops of the metal had struck his eyes and so severely burned them thatit was feared for a while that his sight could not be saved.However, despite the almost unlimited possibilities for accidents in connectionwith the vast variety of experiments which Tesla conducted in totally unexploredfields, using high voltages, high amperages, high pressures, high velocities andhigh temperatures, he went through his entire career with only one accident inwhich he suffered injury. In that a sharp instrument slipped, entered his palmand penetrated through the hand. The accident to Scherff was the only one inwhich a member of his staff was injured, with the exception of a young assistantwho developed X-ray burns. He had probably been exposed to the rays from one ofTesla’s tubes which, unknown to Tesla and everyone else, had been producing themeven before Roentgen announced their discovery. Tesla had given them anothername and had not fully investigated their properties. This was probably thefirst case of X-ray burns on record.Tesla was an indefatigable worker, and it was hard for him to understand whyothers were incapable of such feats of endurance as he was able to accomplish.He was willing to pay unusually high wages to workers who were willing to stickwith him on protracted tasks but never demanded that anyone work beyond areasonable day’s labor. On one occasion a piece of long-awaited equipmentarrived and Tesla was anxious to get it installed and operating as quickly aspossible. The electricians worked through twenty-four hours, stopping only formeals, and then for another twenty-four hours. The workers then dropped out, oneby one, picking out nooks in the building in which to sleep. While they tookfrom eight to twelve hours’ sleep, Tesla continued to work; and when they cameback to the job Tesla was still going strong and worked with them through histhird sleepless twenty-four-hour period. The men were then given several daysoff in which to rest up; but Tesla, apparently none the worse for hisseventy-two hours of toil, went through his next day of experiments,accomplishing a total of eighty-four hours without sleep or rest.The plant at Wardencliff was intended primarily for demonstrating theradio-broadcasting phase of his “World System”; the power-distribution stationwas to be built at Niagara Falls.Tesla at this time published a brochure on his “World System” which indicatesthe remarkable state of advancement he had projected in the wireless art, nowcalled radio, while other experimenters were struggling to acquire familiaritywith rudimentary devices. At that time, however, his promises seemed fantastic.The brochure contained the following description of his system and hisobjectives:The World System has resulted from a combination of several original discoveriesmade by the inventor in the course of long continued research andexperimentation. It makes possible not only the instantaneous and precisewireless transmission of any kind of signals, messages or characters, to allparts of the world, but also the interconnection of the existing telegraph,telephone, and other signal stations without any change in their presentequipment. By its means, for instance, a telephone subscriber here many call upany other subscriber on the Globe. An inexpensive receiver, not bigger than awatch, will enable him to listen anywhere, on land or sea, to a speechdelivered, or music played in some other place, however distant. These examplesare cited merely to give an idea of the possibilities of this great scientificadvance, which annihilates distance and makes that perfect conductor, the Earth,available for all the innumerable purposes which human ingenuity has found for aline wire. One far reaching result of this is that any device capable of beingoperated through one or more wires (at a distance obviously restricted) canlikewise be actuated, without artificial conductors and with the same facilityand accuracy, at distances to which there are no limits other than those imposedby the physical dimensions of the Globe. Thus, not only will entirely new fieldsfor commercial exploitation be opened up, by this ideal method of transmission,but the old ones vastly extended.The World System is based on the application of the following importantinventions and discoveries:1. The Tesla Transformer. This apparatus is, in the production of electricalvibrations, as revolutionary as gunpowder was in warfare. Currents many timesstronger than any ever generated in the usual Ways, and sparks over 100 feetlong have been produced by the inventor with an instrument of this kind.2. The Magnifying Transmitter. This is Tesla’s best invention—a peculiartransformer specially adapted to excite the Earth, which is in the transmissionof electrical energy what the telescope is in astronomical observation. By theuse of this marvelous device he has already set up electrical movements ofgreater intensity than those of lightning and passed a current, sufficient tolight more than 200 incandescent lamps, around the Globe.3. The Tesla Wireless System. This system comprises a number of improvements andis the only means known for transmitting economically electrical energy to adistance without wires. Careful tests and measurements in connection with anexperimental station of great activity, erected by the inventor in Colorado,have demonstrated that power in any desired amount can be conveyed clear acrossthe Globe if necessary, with a loss not exceeding a few per cent.4. The Art of Individualization. This invention of Tesla is to primitive tuningwhat refined language is to unarticulated expression. It makes possible thetransmission of signals or messages absolutely secret and exclusive both inactive and passive aspect, that is, non-interfering as well as non-interferable.Each signal is like an individual of unmistakable identity and there isvirtually no limit to the number of stations or instruments that can besimultaneously operated without the slightest mutual disturbance.5. The Terrestrial Stationary Waves. This wonderful discovery, popularlyexplained, means that the Earth is responsive to electrical vibrations ofdefinite pitch just as a tuning fork to certain waves of sound. These particularelectrical vibrations, capable of powerfully exciting the Globe, lend themselvesto innumerable uses of great importance commercially and in many other respects.The first World System power plant can be put in operation in nine months. Withthis power plant it will be practical to attain electrical activities up to tenmillion horsepower and it is designed to serve for as many technicalachievements as are possible without undue expense. Among these the followingmay be mentioned:1. Interconnection of the existing telegraph exchanges of offices all over theWorld;2. Establishment of a secret and non-interferable government telegraph service;3. Interconnection of all the present telephone exchanges or offices all overthe Globe;4. Universal distribution of general news, by telegraph or telephone, inconnection with the Press;5. Establishment of a World System of intelligence transmission for exclusiveprivate use;6. Interconnection and operation of all stock tickers of the world;7. Establishment of a world system of musical distribution, etc.;8. Universal registration of time by cheap clocks indicating the time withastronomical precision and requiring no attention whatever;9. Facsimile transmission of typed or handwritten characters, letters, checks,etc.;10. Establishment of a universal marine service enabling navigators of all shipsto steer perfectly without compass, to determine the exact location, hour andspeed, to prevent collisions and disasters, etc.;11. Inauguration of a system of world printing on land and sea;12. Reproduction anywhere in the world of photographic pictures and all kinds ofdrawings or records.Thus, more than forty years ago, Tesla planned to inaugurate every feature ofmodern radio, and several facilities which have not yet been developed. He wasto continue, for another twenty years, to be the only “wireless” inventor whohad yet visualized a broadcasting service.While at work on his Wardencliff radio-broadcasting plant, Tesla was alsoevolving plans for establishing his world power station at Niagara Falls. Sosure was he of the successful outcome of his efforts that he stated in anewspaper interview in 1903 that he would light the lamps of the cominginternational exposition in Paris with power wirelessly transmitted from theFalls. Circumstances, however, prevented him from making good this promise. Hisdifficulties and his plans were outlined in a statement published in theElectrical World and Engineer, March 5, 1904:The first of these central plants would have been already completed had it notbeen for unforeseen delays which, fortunately, have nothing to do with itspurely technical features. But this loss of time, while vexatious, may, afterall, prove to be a blessing in disguise. The best design of which I know hasbeen adopted, and the transmitter will emit a wave complex of a total maximumactivity of 10,000,000 horsepower, one percent of which is amply sufficient to“girdle the globe.” This enormous rate of energy delivery, approximately twicethat of the combined falls of Niagara, is obtainable only by the use of certainartifices, which I shall make known in due course.For a large part of the work which I have done so far I am indebted to the noblegenerosity of Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan, which was all the more welcome andstimulating, as it was extended at a time when those, who have since promisedmost, were the greatest of doubters. I have also to thank my friend StanfordWhite, for much unselfish and valuable assistance. This work is now faradvanced, and though the results may be tardy, they are sure to come.Meanwhile, the transmission of energy on an industrial scale is not beingneglected. The Canadian Niagara Power Company have offered me a splendidinducement, and next to achieving success for the sake of the art, it will giveme the greatest satisfaction to make their concession financially profitable tothem. In this first power plant, which I have been designing for a long time, Ipropose to distribute 10,000 horsepower under a tension of 10,000,000 volts,which I am now able to produce and handle with safety.This energy will be collected all over the globe preferably in small amounts,ranging from a fraction of one to a few horsepower. One of the chief uses willbe the illumination of isolated homes. It takes very little power to light adwelling with vacuum tubes operated by high frequency currents and in eachinstance a terminal a little above the roof will be sufficient. Another valuableapplication will be the driving of clocks and other such apparatus. These clockswill be exceedingly simple, will require absolutely no attention and willindicate rigorously correct time. The idea of impressing upon the earth Americantime is fascinating and very likely to become popular. There are innumerabledevices of all kinds which are either now employed or can be supplied and byoperating them in this manner I may be able to offer a great convenience to thewhole world with a plant of no more than 10,000 horsepower. The introduction ofthis system will give opportunities for invention and manufacture such as havenever presented themselves before.Knowing the far reaching importance of this first attempt and its effect uponfuture development, I shall proceed slowly and carefully. Experience has taughtme not to assign a term to enterprises the consummation of which is not whollydependent on my own abilities and exertions. But I am hopeful that these greatrealizations are not far off and I know that when this first work is completedthey will follow with mathematical certitude.When the great truth accidentally revealed and experimentally confirmed is fullyrecognized, that this planet, with all In appalling immensity, is to electriccurrent virtually no more than a small metal ball and that by this fact manypossibilities, each baffling the imagination and of incalculable consequence,are rendered absolutely sure of accomplishment; when the first plant isinaugurated, and it is shown that a telegraphic message, almost as secret andnon-interferable as a thought, can be transmitted to any terrestrial distance,the sound of the human voice, with all its intonations and inflections,faithfully and instantly reproduced at any point of the globe, the energy of awaterfall made available for supplying light, heat or motive power, anywhere—onsea, or land, or high in the air—humanity; will be like an ant heap stirred upwith a stick: See the excitement coming.The Niagara Falls plant was never built; and difficulties, soon enough, wereencountered at the Wardencliff plant not only in securing desired equipment butalso finances.Tesla’s greatest oversight was that he neglected to invent, so to speak, adevice for making the unlimited quantities of money that were necessary todevelop his other inventions. As we have seen, he was utterly lacking in thephase of personality that made possible the securing of financial returnsdirectly from his inventions. An individual with his ability could have mademillions out of each of a number of Tesla’s minor inventions. If he had takenthe trouble, for example, to collect annual royalties on twenty or moredifferent kinds of devices put out by as many manufacturers employing his Teslacoil for medical treatments, he would have had ample income to finance his WorldWireless System.His mind, however, was too fully occupied with fascinating scientific problems.He had, at times, nearly a score of highly skilled workmen constantly employedin his laboratory developing the electrical inventions he was continuing to makeat a rapid rate. Armed guards were always stationed around the laboratory toprevent spying on his inventions. His payroll was heavy, his bank balance becamedangerously low, but he was so immersed in his experimental work that hecontinuously put off the task of making an effort to repair his finances. Hesoon found himself facing judgments obtained by creditors on accounts upon whichhe could not make payments. He was forced, in 1905, to close the Wardenclifflaboratory.The fantastic tower in front of the laboratory was never completed. Thedoughnut-shaped copper electrode was never built because Tesla changed his mindand decided to have a copper hemisphere 100 feet in diameter and 50 feet highbuilt on top of the 154-foot cone-shaped tower. A skeleton framework for holdingthe hemispherical plates was built, but the copper sheeting was never applied toit. The 300-horsepower dynamos and the apparatus for operating the broadcastingstation were left intact, but they were eventually removed by the engineeringfirm that installed them and had not been paid.Tesla opened an office at 165 Broadway, in New York, where for a while he triedto contrive some means for reviving his project. Thomas Fortune Ryan, thewell-known financier, and H. O. Havemeyer, the leading sugar refiner, aided himwith contributions of $10,000 and $5,000 respectively. Instead of using these toopen another laboratory, he applied them to paying off the debts on his nowdefunct World Wireless System. He paid off every penny due to every creditor.When it became apparent that Tesla was in financial difficulties, many who hadassumed that Morgan was financially involved as an investor in his project weredisillusioned. When specific inquiries revealed that the great financier held nointerest whatever in the enterprise, the rumor got into circulation that Morganhad withdrawn his support; and when no reason for such action could be learnedthe rumor expanded to carry the story that Tesla’s system was impracticable. Asa matter of fact, Morgan continued to make generous personal contributions toTesla almost up to the time of his own death; and his son did so to a lesserextent for a short time.Tesla made no effort to combat the growing rumors.If Tesla could have tolerated a business manager, and had placed the developmentof his patents in the hands of a businessman, he could have established as earlyas 1896 a practical ship-to-shore, and probably a trans-oceanic wirelessservice; and these would have given him a monopoly in this field. He was askedto rig up a wireless set on a boat to report the progress of the internationalyacht race for Lloyds of London in 1896, but he refused the offer, which was alucrative one, on the grounds that he would not demonstrate his system publiclyon less than a world-wide basis because it could be confused with the amateurishefforts being made by other experimenters. If he had accepted this offer—and hecould have met the requirements without the least technical difficulty—heundoubtedly would have found his interests diverted to some extent into aprofitable commercial channel that might have made a vast, and favorable, changein the second half of his life.Tesla, however, could not be bothered with minor, even though profitable,projects. The superman, the man magnificent, was too strong in him. The man whohad put industry on an electrical power basis, the man who had set the wholeearth in vibration, could not fill a minor role of carrying messages for hire.He would function in his major capacity or not at all; he would be a Jupiter,never a Mercury.George Scherff, who was engaged by Tesla as bookkeeper and secretary when heopened his Houston Street laboratory, was a practical individual. He managed, asfar as was humanly possible, to keep the inventor disentangled in his contactswith the business world. The more he knew Tesla, the better he liked him; andthe more respect he had for his genius and his ability as an inventor, the morehe became conscious of the fact that this genius was totally lacking in businessability.Scherff was understandably distressed by a situation in which an enterprise wascontinuously spending money but never receiving any. He sought to protect as faras possible the $40,000 which Tesla received from Adams as an investment in theenterprise; and it was stretched to cover more than three years of greatactivity. Scherff wanted Tesla to work out plans for deriving an income from hisinventions. Each new development which Tesla produced was studied by Scherff andmade the basis for a plan for manufacture and sale of a device. Tesla uniformlyrejected all the suggestions. “This is all small-time stuff,” he would reply. “Icannot be bothered with it.”Even when it was pointed out to him that many manufacturers were using his Teslacoils, selling great numbers of them and making plenty of money out of them, hisinterest could not be aroused to enter this profitable field, nor to permitScherff to arrange to have a sideline set-up which could be conducted withoutinterfering with his research work. Nor could he be induced to bring suits toprotect his invention and seek to make the manufacturers pay him royalties. Headmitted, however, “If the manufacturers paid me twenty-five cents on each coilthey sold I would be a wealthy man.”When Lloyds of London made their request that he set up a wireless outfit on aboat and report the international yacht races of 1896, by his new wirelesssystem, and offered a generous honorarium, Scherff became insistent that theoffer be accepted; and he urged Tesla to drop all other work temporarily and usethe publicity he would get from the exploit as a means of floating a commercialcompany for transmitting wireless messages between ship and shore and across theocean, pointing out that money would be made both in manufacturing the apparatusand in transmitting messages. The company, Scherff suggested, could be operatedby managers to produce an income and Tesla could return to his work of makinginventions and always have plenty of money to pay for the cost of hisresearches.Scherff can look back today, as he sits on the porch of his Westchester home,and decide, through a retrospect of fifty years, that his plan was basicallysound, with the Radio Corporation of America, its extensive manufacturingfacilities and its worldwide communication system, its tremendous capital systemand earnings, as evidence in support of the claim.Tesla’s reply to the proposal was, as usual. “Mr. Scherff, that is small-timestuff. I cannot be bothered with it. Just wait until you see the magnificentinventions I am going to produce, and then we will all make millions.”Tesla’s millions never came. Scherff remained with him until the Wardenclifflaboratory closed, owing to the lack of income, which he had been trying tocircumvent. Scherff then established a lucrative connection with the UnionSulphur Co. but he still continued, without taking compensation, to give Teslaone day a week of his time and keep his business affairs disentangled as far aspossible. Tesla was meticulously careful about paying everyone who performed anyservice for him, but this was counterbalanced by an active faculty forcontracting bills without waiting to see if he had funds on hand to meet them.Money was an annoying anchor that always seemed to be dragging and hindering hisresearch activities—something that was too mundane to merit the time andattention he should be giving to more important things.Scherff, tight-lipped and businesslike, cannot be induced to talk of Tesla’saffairs. If he were, instead, a loquacious philosopher, he might be induced tosmile over the frailties of human nature, and the strange pranks which fate canplay on individuals, as he thinks of Tesla, who, on the basis of a singleinvention, might have become an individual Radio Corporation of America andfailed to do so, and who passed up equal chances on two hundred otherinventions, any one of which could have produced a fortune. And for contrast, hecan recall occasions in recent decades when it was necessary to make modestloans to the great Tesla to permit him to meet the need for current personalnecessities. But Scherff refuses to permit any close questions or discussionabout these incidents.*It stood, however, for a dozen years. When the Government, for militaryreasons, decided it was necessary to remove this conspicuous landmark during theFirst World War, heavy charges of dynamite were necessary in order to topple it,and even then it remained intact on the ground like a fallen Martian invader outof Wells’ War of the Worlds."},{"pageContent":"THIRTEENimage [images/00003.jpg] WHEN his World Wireless System project crashed, Tesla turned again to a projectto which he had given considerable thought at the time he was developing hispolyphase alternating-current system: that of developing a rotary engine whichwould be as far in advance of existing steam engines as his alternating-currentsystem was ahead of the direct-current system, and which could be used fordriving his dynamos.All of the steam engines in use in powerhouses at that time were of thereciprocating type; essentially the same as those developed by Newcomer andWatt, but larger in size, better in construction and more efficient inoperation.Tesla’s engine was of a different type—a turbine in which jets of steam injectedbetween a series of disks produced rotary motion at high velocity in thecylinder on which these disks were mounted. The steam entered at the outer edgeof the disks, pursued a spiral path of a dozen or more convolutions, and leftthe engine near the central shaft.When Tesla informed a friend in 1902 that he was working on an engine project,he declared he would produce an engine so small, simple and powerful that itwould be a “powerhouse in a hat.” The first model, which he made about 1906,fulfilled this promise. It was small enough to fit into the dome of a derby hat,measured a little more than six inches in its largest dimension, and developedthirty horsepower. The power-producing performance of this little engine vastlyexceeded that of every known kind of prime mover in use at that time. The engineweighed a little less than ten pounds. Its output was therefore three horsepowerper pound. The rotor weighed only a pound and a half, and its light weight andhigh power yield gave Tesla a slogan which he used on his letterheads andenvelopes—“Twenty horsepower per pound. ”There was nothing new, of course, in the basic idea of obtaining circular motiondirectly from a stream of moving fluid. Windmills and water wheels, devices asold as history, performed this feat. Hero, the Alexandrian writer, about 200B.C., described, if he did not invent, the first turbine. It consisted of ahollow sphere of metal mounted on an axle, with two tubes sticking out of thesphere at a tangent to its surface. When water was placed in the sphere and thedevice was suspended in a fire, the reaction of the steam coming out of thetubes caused the device to rotate.Tesla’s ingenious and original development of the turbine idea probably had itsorigin in that amusing and unsuccessful experiment he made when, as a boy, hetried to build a vacuum motor and observed its wooden cylinder turn slightly bythe drag of the air leaking into the vacuum chamber. Later, too, when as a youthhe fled to the mountains to escape military service and played with the idea oftransporting mail across the ocean through an underwater tube, through which ahollow sphere was to be carried by a rapidly moving stream of water, he haddiscovered that the friction of the water on the walls of the tube made the ideaimpracticable. The friction would slow down the velocity of the stream of waterso that excessive amounts of power would be required to move the water at adesired speed and pressure. Conversely, if the water moved at this speed, thefriction caused it to try to drag the enclosing tube along with it.It was this friction which Tesla now utilized in his turbine. A jet of steamrushing at high velocity between disks with a very small distance separatingthem was slowed down by the friction—but the disks, being capable of rotation,moved with increasing velocity until it was almost equal to that of the steam.In addition to the friction factor, there exists a peculiar attraction betweengases and metal surfaces; and this made it possible for the moving steam to gripthe metal of the disks more effectively and drag them around at high velocities.The first model which Tesla made in 1906 had twelve disks five inches indiameter. It was operated by compressed air, instead of steam, and attained aspeed of 20,000 revolutions per minute. It was Tesla’s intention eventually touse oil as fuel, burning it in a nozzle and taking advantage of the tremendousincrease in volume, in the change from a liquid to burned highly expanded gases,to turn the rotor. This would eliminate the use of boilers for generating steamand give the direct process proportional increased efficiency.Had Tesla proceeded with the development of his turbine in 1889 when he returnedfrom the Westinghouse plant, his turbine might perhaps have been the oneeventually developed to replace the slow, big, lumbering reciprocating enginesthen in use. The fifteen years, however, which he devoted to the development ofcurrents of high potential and high frequency, had entailed a delay which gaveopportunity for developers of other turbine ideas to advance their work to astage which now was effective in putting Tesla in the status of a very latestarter. In the meantime, turbines had been developed which were virtuallywindmills in a box. They consisted of rotors with small buckets or vanes aroundthe circumference which were struck by the incoming steam jet. They lacked thesimplicity of the Tesla turbine; but by the time Tesla introduced his type, theothers were well entrenched in the development stage.Tesla’s first tiny motor was built in 1906 by Julius C. Czito, who operated atAstoria, Long Island, a machine shop for making inventor’s models. He also builtthe subsequent 1911 and 1925 models of the turbine, and many other devices onwhich Tesla worked up to 1929. Mr. Czito’s father had been a member of Tesla’sstaff in the Houston Street laboratories, from 1892 to 1899, and at ColoradoSprings.Mr. Czito’s description of the first model is as follows:The rotor consisted of a stack of very thin disks six inches in diameter, madeof German silver. The disks were one thirty-second of an inch thick and wereseparated by spacers of the same metal and same thickness but of much smallerdiameter which were cut in the form of a cross with a circular center section.The extended arms served as ribs to brace the disks.There were eight disks and the edgewise face of the stack was only one-half inchacross. They were mounted on the center of a shaft about six inches long. Theshaft was nearly an inch in diameter in the mid section and was tapered in stepsto less than half an inch at the ends. The rotor was set in a casing made infour parts bolted together.The circular chamber where the rotor turned was accurately machined to allow aclearance of one sixty-fourth of an inch between the casing and the face of therotor. Mr. Tesla desired an almost touching fit between the rotor face and thecasing when the latter was turning. The large clearance was necessary becausethe rotor attained tremendously high speeds, averaging 35,000 revolutions perminute. At this speed the centrifugal force generated by the turning movementwas so great it appreciably stretched the metal in the rotating disks. Theirdiameter when turning at top speed was one thirty-second of an inch greater thanwhen they were standing still.A larger model was built by Tesla in 1910. It had disks twelve inches indiameter, and with a speed of 10,000 revolutions per minute it developed 100horsepower, indicating a greatly improved efficiency over the first model. Itdeveloped more than three times as much power at half the speed.During the following year, 1911, still further improvements were made. The diskswere reduced to a diameter of 9. 75 inches and the speed of operation was cutdown by ten per cent, to 9,000 revolutions per minute—and the power outputincreased by ten per cent, to 110 horsepower!Following this test, Tesla issued a statement in which he declared:I have developed 110 horsepower with disks nine and three quarter inches indiameter and making a thickness of about two inches. Under proper conditions theperformance might have been as much as 1,000 horsepower. In fact there is almostno limit to the mechanical performance of such a machine. This engine will workwith gas, as in the usual type of explosion engine used in automobiles andairplanes, even better than it did with steam. Tests which I have conducted haveshown that the rotary effort with gas is greater than with steam.Enthusiastic over the success of his smaller models of the turbine, operated oncompressed air, and to a more limited extent by direct combustion of gasoline,Tesla designed and built a larger, double unit, which he planned to test withsteam in the Waterside Station, the main powerhouse of the New York EdisonCompany.This was a station which had originally been designed to operate on thedirect-current system developed by Edison—but it was now operating throughout onTesla’s polyphase alternating-current system.Now Tesla, invading the Edison sanctum to test a new type of turbine which hehoped would replace the types in use, was definitely in enemy territory. Thefact that he had Morgan backing, and that the Edison Company was a “Morgancompany,” had no nullifying effect on the Edison-Tesla feud.This situation was not softened in any way by Tesla’s method of carrying on histests. Tesla was a confirmed “sun dodger”; he preferred to work at night ratherthan in the daytime. Powerhouses, not from choice but from necessity, have theirheaviest demands for current after sunset. The day load would be relativelylight; but as darkness approached, the dynamos started to groan under theincreasing night load. The services of the workers at the Waterside Station weremade available to Tesla for the setting up and tests of his turbine with theexpectation that the work would be done during the day when the tasks of theworkers were easiest.Tesla, however, would rarely show up until five o’clock in the afternoon, orlater, and would turn a deaf ear to the pleas of workers that he arrive earlier.He insisted that certain of the workers whom he favored remain after theirfive-o’clock quitting time on the day shift to work with him on an overtimebasis. Nor did he maintain a conciliatory attitude toward the engineering staffor the officials of the company. The attitudes, naturally, were mutual.The turbine Tesla built for this test had a rotor 18 inches in diameter whichturned at a speed of 9,000 revolutions per minute. It developed 200 horsepower.The overall dimensions of the engine were—three feet long, two feet wide and twofeet high. It weighed 400 pounds.Two such turbines were built and installed in a line on a single base. Theshafts of both were connected to a torque rod. Steam was fed to both engines sothat, if they were free to rotate, they would turn in opposite directions. Thepower developed was measured by the torque rod connected to the two opposingshafts.At a formal test, to which Tesla invited a great many guests, he issued astatement in which he said, as reported, in part:It should be noted that although the experimental plant develops 200 horsepowerwith 125 pounds at the supply pipe and free exhaust it could show an output of300 horsepower with full pressure of the supply circuit. If the turbine werecompounded and the exhaust were led to a low pressure unit carrying about threetimes the number of disks contained in the high pressure element, withconnection to a condenser affording 28. 5 to 29. 0 inches of vacuum the resultsobtained in the present high pressure machine indicate that the compounded unitwould give an output of 600 horsepower without great increase of dimensions.This estimate is very conservative.Tests have shown that when the turbine is running at 9,000 revolutions perminute under an inlet pressure of 125 pounds to the square inch and with freeexhaust 200 brake horsepower are developed. The consumption under theseconditions of maximum output is 38 pounds of saturated steam per horsepower perhour, a very high efficiency when we consider that the heat drop, measured bythermometers, is only 130 B. T. U. and that the energy transformation iseffected in one stage. Since three times the number of heat units are availablein a modern plant with superheat and high vacuum the utilization of thesefacilities would mean a consumption of less than 12 pounds per horsepower hourin such turbines adapted to take the full drop.Under certain conditions very high thermal efficiencies have been obtained whichdemonstrate that in large machines based on this principle steam consumptionwill be much lower and should approximate the theoretical minimum thus resultingin the nearly frictionless turbine transmitting almost the entire expansiveenergy of the steam to the shaft.It should be kept in mind that all of the turbines which Tesla built and testedwere single-stage engines, using about one-third of the energy of the steam. Inpractical use, they were intended to be installed with a second stage whichwould employ the remaining energy and increase the power output about two orthree fold. (The two types of turbines in common use each have a dozen and morestages within a single shell.)Some of the Edison electric camp, observing the torque-rod tests and apparentlynot understanding that in such a test the two rotors remain stationary—theiropposed pressures staging a tug of war measured as torque—circulated the storythat the turbine was a complete failure; that this turbine would not bepractical if its efficiency had been increased a thousand fold. It was storiessuch as these that contributed to the imputation that Tesla was an impracticalvisionary. The Tesla turbine, however, used as a single-stage engine,functioning as a pygmy power producer, in the form in which it was actuallytested, anticipated by more than twenty-five years a type of turbine which hasbeen installed in recent years in the Waterside Station. This is a very smallengine, with blades on its rotor, known as a “topping turbine,” which isinserted in the steam line between the boilers and the ordinary turbines. Steamof increased pressure is supplied, and the topping turbine skims this “cream”from the steam and exhausts steam that runs the other turbines in their normalway.The General Electric Company was developing the Curtis turbine at that time, andthe Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company was developing the Parsonsturbine; and neither company showed the slightest interest in Tesla’sdemonstration.Further development of his turbine on a larger scale would have required a largeamount of money and Tesla did not possess even a small amount.FINALLY he succeeded in interesting the Allis Chalmers Manufacturing Company ofMilwaukee, builders of reciprocating engines and turbines, and other heavymachinery. In typical Tesla fashion, though, he manifested in his negotiationssuch a lack of diplomacy and insight into human nature that he would have beenbetter off if he had completely failed to make any arrangements for exploitingthe turbine.Tesla, an engineer, ignored the engineers on the Allis Chalmers staff and wentdirectly to the president. While an engineering report was being prepared on hisproposal, he went to the Board of Directors and “sold” that body on his projectbefore the engineers had a chance to be heard. Three turbines were built. Two ofthem had twenty disks eighteen inches in diameter and were tested with steam ateighty pounds pressure. They developed at speeds of 12,000 and 10,000revolutions per minute, respectively, 200 horsepower. This was exactly the samepower output as had been achieved by Tesla’s 1911 model, which had disks of halfthis diameter and was operated at 9,000 revolutions under 125 pounds pressure. Amuch larger engine was tackled next. It had fifteen disks sixty inches indiameter, was designed to operate at 3, 600 revolutions per minute, and wasrated at 500 kilowatts capacity, or about 675 horsepower.Hans Dahlstrand, Consulting Engineer of the Steam Turbine Department, reports,in part:We also built a 500 kw steam turbine to operate at 3, 600 revolutions. Theturbine rotor consisted of fifteen disks 60 inches in diameter and one eighthinch thick. The disks were placed approximately one eighth inch apart. The unitwas tested by connecting to a generator. The maximum mechanical efficiencyobtained on this unit was approximately 38 per cent when operating at steampressure of approximately 80 pounds absolute and a back pressure ofapproximately 3 pounds absolute and 100 degrees F superheat at the inlet.When the steam pressure was increased above that given the mechanical efficiencydropped, consequently the design of these turbines was of such a nature that inorder to obtain maximum efficiency at high pressure, it would have beennecessary to have more than one turbine in series.The efficiency of the small turbine units compares with the efficiencyobtainable on small impulse turbines running at speeds where they can bedirectly connected to pumps and other machinery. It is obvious, therefore, thatthe small unit in order to obtain the same efficiency had to operate at from10,000 to 12,000 revolutions and it would have been necessary to providereduction gears between the steam turbine and the driven unit.Furthermore, the design of the Tesla turbine could not compete as far asmanufacturing costs with the smaller type of impulse units. It is alsoquestionable whether the rotor disks, because of light construction and highstress, would have lasted any length of time if operating continuously.The above remarks apply equally to the large turbine running at 3, 600revolutions. It was found when this unit was dismantled that the disks haddistorted to a great extent and the opinion was that these disks wouldultimately have failed if the unit had been operated for any length of time.The gas turbine was never constructed for the reason that the company was unableto obtain sufficient engineering information from Mr. Tesla indicating even anapproximate design that he had in mind.Tesla appears to have walked out on the tests at this stage. In Milwaukee,however, there was no George Westinghouse to save the situation. Later, duringthe twenties, the author asked Tesla why he had terminated his work with theAllis Chalmers Company. He replied: “They would not build the turbines as Iwished”; and he would not amplify the statement further.The Allis Chalmers Company later became the pioneer manufacturers of anothertype of gas turbine that has been in successful operation for years.While the Dahlstrand report may appear to be severely critical of the Teslaturbine and to reveal fundamental weaknesses in it not found in other turbines,such is not the case. The report is, in general, a fair presentation of theresults; and the description of apparent weaknesses merely offers from anotherviewpoint the facts which Tesla himself stated about the turbine in his earliertest—that when employed as a single-stage engine it uses only about a third ofthe energy of the steam, and that to utilize the remainder, it would have to becompounded with a second turbine.The reference to a centrifugal force of 70,000 pounds resulting from the highspeed of rotation of the rotor, causing damage to the disks, refers to a commonexperience with all types of turbines. This is made clear in a booklet on “TheStory of the Turbine,” issued during the past year by the General ElectricCompany, in which it is stated:It [the turbine] had to wait until engineers and scientists could developmaterials to withstand these pressures and speeds. For example, a single bucketin a modern turbine travelling at 600 miles per hour has a centrifugal force of90,000 pounds trying to pull it from its attachment on the bucket wheel andshaft….In this raging inferno the high pressure buckets at one end of the turbine runred hot while a few feet away the large buckets in the last stages run at 600miles per hour through a storm of tepid rain so fast that the drops of condensedsteam cut like a sand blast.Dahlstrand reported that difficulties were encountered in the Tesla turbine fromvibration, making it necessary to re-enforce the disks. That this difficulty iscommon to all turbines is further indicated by the General Electric booklet,which states:Vibration cracked buckets and wheels and wrecked turbines, sometimes within afew hours and sometimes after years of operation. This vibration was caused bytaking such terrific amounts of power from relatively light machinery—it somecases as much as 400 horsepower out of a bucket weighing but a pound or two….The major problems of the turbine are four—high temperatures, high pressures,high speeds and internal vibration. And their solution lies in engineering,research and manufacturing skill.These problems are still awaiting their final solution, even with themanufacturers who have been building turbines for forty years; and the fact thatthey were encountered in the Tesla turbine, and so reported, is not a finalcriticism of Tesla’s invention in the earliest stages of its development.There have been whisperings in engineering circles during the past year or twoto indicate a revival of interest in the Tesla turbine and the possibility thatthe makers of the Curtis and Parsons types may extend their lines to include theTesla type for joint operation with the others. The development of new alloys,which can now almost be made to order with desired qualities of mechanicalstability under conditions of high temperature and great stresses, is largelyresponsible for this turn of events.It is a possibility that if the Tesla turbine were constructed with the benefitof two or more stages, thus giving it the full operating range of either theCurtis or the Parsons turbine, and were built with the same benefits ofengineering skill and modern metallurgical developments as have been lavished onthese two turbines, the vastly greater simplicity of the Tesla turbine wouldenable it to manifest greater efficiencies of operation and economies ofconstruction.FOURTEENimage [images/00003.jpg] THE highest honor which the world can confer upon its scholars is the NobelPrize founded by Alfred B. Nobel, the Swedish scientist who gained his wealththrough the invention of dynamite. Five awards are made annually, and eachcarries an honorarium of about $40,000, in normal times.An announcement came from Sweden, in 1912, that Nikola Tesla and Thomas A.Edison had been chosen to share the 1912 award in physics. The awards, however,were never made; and the prize went instead to Gustav Dalen, a Swedishscientist.The full story of what took place is not known. The correspondence on thesubject Is not available. It is definitely established that Tesla refused toaccept the award. Tesla was very much in need of money at this time and the$20,000, which would have been his share of the divided award, would have aidedhim to continue his work. Other factors, however, had a more potent influence.Tesla made a very definite distinction between the inventor of useful appliancesand the discoverer of new principles. The discoverer of new principles, hestated in conversation with the author, is a pioneer who opens up new fields ofknowledge into which thousands of inventors flock to make commercialapplications of the newly revealed information. Tesla declared himself adiscoverer and Edison an inventor; and he held the view that placing the two inthe same category would completely destroy all sense of the relative value ofthe two accomplishments.It is quite probable that Tesla was also influenced by the fact that the NobelPrize in physics had been awarded to Marconi three years earlier, a situationthat greatly disappointed him. To have the award go first to Marconi, and thento be asked to share the award with Edison, was too great a derogation of therelative value of his work to the world for Tesla to bear without rebelling.Tesla was the first, and probably the only, scientist to refuse this famousprize.One of the highest honors in the engineering world, too, is the Edison Medal,founded by unnamed friends of Thomas A. Edison, and awarded each year by theAmerican Institute of Electrical Engineers, at its annual convention, foroutstanding contribution to electrical art and science. Usually, the recipientsare very happy to receive the award; but in 1917, when the committee voted topresent the medal to Tesla, a different situation developed.The chairman of the Edison Medal committee was B. A. Behrend, who had been oneof the first electrical engineers to grasp the tremendous significance ofTesla’s alternating-current discoveries and their far-reaching importance toevery department of the electrical industry. A few Outstanding engineers wereable, at the beginning, to understand the intricacies of new alternating-currentprocedures which Tesla’s discoveries made of immediate practical importance; butit was Behrend who developed a beautiful, simple mathematical technique, knownas the “circle diagram,” which made it possible to work out problems ofdesigning alternating-current machinery with great ease, and also to understandthe complex phenomena that were taking place within such devices. He publishedinnumerable articles on the subject in the technical journals and wrote thestandard textbook on the subject, The Induction Motor. Fame and fortune came toBehrend. He achieved recognition as one of the outstanding electrical engineers,and was later elected vice-president of the American Institute of ElectricalEngineers. So important was his work to the commercial world that he wasconsidered a probable recipient of the Edison Medal.Behrend had started publishing articles, on his circle diagram discovery in 1896but he did not meet Tesla until 1901, when Tesla required a particular type ofmotor for his World Wireless plant being built at Wardencliff, L. I., and thetask of designing it was assigned to the engineering department of amanufacturing company of which Behrend was in charge. After Tesla and Behrendmet, a very close personal friendship developed between the two men. Behrend wasone of the few who thoroughly understood Tesla’s work; and the inventor, lonelyin the absence of individuals with minds of his own caliber, greatly appreciatedBehrend’s friendship.Behrend believed, therefore, that he was rendering Tesla a token of his highestappreciation when he managed to maneuver the award of the Edison Medal to him;and he was quite happy to carry out the mission of bearing the good news to theinventor. The announcement, however, did not make Tesla happy. He did not wantthe Edison Medal, he would not receive it!Behrend, greatly surprised at Tesla’s rebuff, asked him if he would not explainthe situation that caused it.“Let us forget the whole matter, Mr. Behrend. I appreciate your good will andyour friendship but I desire you to return to the committee and request it tomake another selection for a recipient. It is nearly thirty years since Iannounced my rotating magnetic field and alternating-current system before theInstitute. I do not need its honors and someone else may find them useful.”It would have been impossible for Behrend to deny that the Institute had indeedfailed, over this long period, to honor the man whose discoveries wereresponsible for creating the jobs held by probably more than three quarters ofthe members of the Institute, while honors had been distributed to many othersfor relatively minor accomplishments. Still, using the privilege of friendship,Behrend pressed for a further explanation.“You propose,” Tesla replied, “to honor me with a medal which I could pin uponmy coat and strut for a vain hour before the members and guests of yourInstitute. You would bestow an outward semblance of honoring me but you woulddecorate my body and continue to let starve, for failure to supply recognition,my mind and its creative products which have supplied the foundation upon whichthe major portion of your Institute exists. And when you would go through thevacuous pantomine of honoring Tesla you would not be honoring Tesla but Edisonwho has previously shared unearned glory from every previous recipient of thismedal.”Behrend, however, after several visits, finally prevailed upon Tesla to acceptthe medal.Custom requires that the recipient of a medal deliver a formal address. On theoccasions, a quarter of a century earlier, when Tesla was invited to address theInstitute, he had had ample laboratory facilities, and had invested a great dealof time, effort, thought and money in the preparation of his lectures. For them,however, he was awarded no honors. Now he was without laboratory facilities andwithout adequate financial resources, although his more mature mind was asfilled with ideas and un-born inventions as it had ever been. He was notrequired to present a demonstration lecture. In this matter, however, Tesla wasa victim of his own past performances; and there was an expectancy that he wouldemerge from the comparative oblivion which had enshrouded him for more than adecade, and come, like a master magician, bearing some wondrous new gifts ofinvention to the world.Tesla attended some of the meetings of the convention, and Behrend, none toocertain about what the medalist might do, took him in tow following theafternoon session and escorted him to the Hotel St. Regis, where Tesla now madehis home, and where both donned their formal dress for the evening’s ceremonies.The first event on the evening’s program was a private dinner at theEngineers’Club, tendered by the Institute to the medalist, who was the guest ofhonor, and attended by previous recipients of the Edison Medal, as well asmembers of the committee and the officers of the Institute. It was a galaoccasion and represented an unusual concentration of the world’s greatestelectrical engineering talent. Tesla could be relied upon to lend brilliance toany such occasion, but, while his sparkling conversation added to the gayety ofthe group, he was distinctly ill at ease.The Engineers’ Club, on the south side of 40th Street, between Fifth and SixthAvenues, faces Bryant Park, the eastern third of which is occupied by theclassical building of the New York Public Library, facing Fifth Avenue from 40thto 42nd Streets. The United Engineering Societies Building, an imposingstructure on the north side of 39th, stands almost back-to-back with theEngineers’ Club. By stepping a few feet across an alley, it is possible to gofrom one building to the other.Following the dinner in the Engineers’ Club, the brilliant group at themedalist’s dinner made their way across the alley and proceeded through thecrowded lobby of the Engineering Societies Building, which was abuzz with themultitudinous activities associated with a convention. The party entered theelevators which carried them to the large auditorium on the fifth floor wherethe medal presentations Were to take place.The auditorium was crowded with an audience that had come largely from formaldinners held as part of the convention program. The floor and gallery werefilled to capacity. The buzz of animated conversation died down as there filedonto the stage the outstanding figures of the electrical world, in “tails” andwhite ties, who were to serve as the “wax works” of the ceremonies and to takesome part in the presentation.As the wax works took their previously assigned chairs, the stage was set forthe opening of the ceremonies. But the opening did not take place according toschedule. There was consternation in the group as it was discovered that thechair reserved for the chief participant in the event was empty.Tesla was missing!The side hall, leading off the stage, and the anterooms were searched, but therewas no sign of him. Members of the committee slipped out to retrace their stepsthrough the lobby and back to the Club dining room. A man as tall as Tesla couldnot be hidden in any group, yet there was not a sign of him in either building.The delay in opening the meeting in the auditorium was embarrassing—but theceremonies could not be started without Tesla, and where was he?It seemed hardly possible that an imposing figure like Tesla, his. heightexaggerated by the streamlined contours of his swallow-tailed formal eveningdress, and in the almost worshipful custody of a score of outstandingintellects, could vanish without any of them observing his going.Behrend rushed back from the Club to the auditorium, hopeful that Tesla hadpreceded him; but he found that such was not the case. All the washrooms in bothbuildings had been searched; he was concealed in none of them. No one couldoffer a theory to account for his disappearance.None but Behrend knew of Tesla’s aversion to accepting the Edison Medal, yeteven he had not the slightest knowledge of what had become of the famousinventor. He recalled noting the shadowy walks of Bryant Park opposite the Clubas he and Tesla stepped from the taxicab earlier in the evening, and he wonderedif Tesla had retreated there for some quiet meditation before the ceremony. Hehurried out of the Club.As Behrend stepped into Bryant Park, the last faint glimmerings of dusk werevisible in the high sky; but in the park the shades of night were gathering andhere and there could be heard the faint twitterings of birds. The twittering ofthe birds brought, like a flash, to Behrend’s mind the scene he had observed inTesla’s apartment at the Hotel St. Regis. In the room which Tesla had arrangedas a reading room and office was a roll-top desk, and on top of this were fourneat circular baskets, in two of which pigeons were nestled. Before they leftthe apartment Tesla went to the window, which was kept open at all times,whistled softly, and two more pigeons quickly flew into the room. Just beforeleaving for the dinner Tesla fed the pigeons, and having done so slipped a paperbag filled with something into his pocket. The possible significance of thislatter act did not occur to Behrend until he heard the twittering of the birdsin the park.With all possible speed Behrend rushed out of the park, down 40th Street towardFifth Avenue, and up the steps to the plaza of the Library. Here he beheld asight that amazed him almost beyond belief in what his eyes told him. Here wasthe missing man. He had recalled that Tesla regularly visited the Library, St.Patrick’s Cathedral, or other places to feed the pigeons.In the center of a large thin circle of observers stood the imposing figure ofTesla, wearing a crown of two pigeons on his head, his shoulders and armsfestooned with a dozen more, their white or pale-blue bodies making strongcontrast with his black suit and black hair, even in the dusk. On either of hisoutstretched hands was another bird, while seemingly hundreds more made a livingcarpet on the ground in front of him, hopping about and pecking at the bird seedhe had been scattering.It was Behrend’s impulse to rush in, shoo the birds away and, seizing themissing man, rush him back to the auditorium. Something caused him to halt. Suchan abrupt action seemed almost sacrilegious. As he hesitated momentarily, Teslacaught sight of him and slowly shifted the position of one hand to raise awarning finger. As he did so, however, he moved slowly toward Behrend; and as hecame close, some of the birds flew from Tesla’s shoulders to Behrend’s.Apparently sensing a disturbing situation, though, all the birds flew to theground.Appealing to Tesla not to let him down, nor to embarrass those who were waitingat, the meeting, Behrend prevailed upon the inventor to return to theauditorium. Little did Behrend know how much more the pigeons meant to Teslathan did the Edison Medal; and little could anyone have suspected the fantasticsecret in Tesla’s life, of which the outer manifestation was his faithfulfeeding of his feathered friends. To Behrend it was just another, and in thiscase very embarrassing, manifestation of the nonconformity of genius. Of this,more later.Returning to the auditorium, Behrend explained in a quick aside to the presidentthat Tesla had been temporarily ill, but that his condition was now quitesatisfactory. The opening of the meeting had been delayed about twenty minutes.In his presentation speech, Behrend pointed out that by an extraordinarycoincidence, it was exactly 29 years ago, to the very day and hour, that NikolaTesla presented his original description of his polyphase alternating-currentsystem. He added:Not since the appearance of Faraday’s “Experimental Researches in Electricity”has a great experimental truth been voiced so simply and so clearly as thisdescription of Mr. Tesla’s great discovery of the generation and utilization ofpolyphase alternating currents. He left nothing to be done by those who followedhim. His paper contained the skeleton even of the mathematical theory.Three years later, in 1891, there was given the first great demonstration, bySwiss engineers, of the transmission of power at 30,000 volts from Lauffen toFrankfort by means of Mr. Tesla’s system. A lew years later this was followed bythe development of the Cataract Construction Company, under the presidency ofour member, Mr. Edward D. Adams, and with the aid of the engineers of theWestinghouse Company. It is interesting to recall here tonight that in LordKelvin’s report to Mr. Adams, Lord Kelvin recommended the use of direct currentfor the development of power at Niagara Falls and for its transmission toBuffalo.The due appreciation or even enumeration of the results of Mr. Tesla’s inventionis neither practicable nor desirable at this moment. There is a time for allthings. Suffice it to say that, were we to seize and eliminate from ourindustrial world the results of Mr. Tesla’s work, the wheels of industry wouldcease to turn, our electric cars and trains would stop, our towns would be dark,our mills would be dead and idle. Yes, so far reaching is this work, that it hasbecome the warp and woof of industry…. His name marks an epoch in the advance ofelectrical science. From that work has sprung a revolution in the electricalart.We asked Mr. Tesla to accept this medal. We did not do this for the mere sake ofconferring a distinction, or of perpetuating a name; for so long as men occupythemselves with our industry, his work will be incorporated in the commonthought of our art, and the name of Tesla runs no more risk of oblivion thandoes that of Faraday, or that of Edison.Nor indeed does this Institute give this medal as evidence that Mr. Tesla’s workhas its official sanction. His work stands in no need of such sanction.No, Mr. Tesla, we beg you to cherish this medal as a symbol of our gratitude fora new creative thought, the powerful impetus, akin to revolution, which you havegiven to our art and to our science. You have lived to see the work of yourgenius established. What shall a man desire more than this? There rings out tous a paraphrase of Pope’s lines on Newton:> > “Nature and Nature’s laws lay hid in night:> > > “God said, Let Tesla be, and all was light.”> > No record remains of Tesla’s acceptance speech. He did not prepare a formaladdress. He had intended to make but a brief response, but instead he becameinvolved in anecdotal narration and a preview of the future of electricalscience which, in the absence of the limiting influence of a written copy,became quite lengthy.It is doubtful if anyone in the audience, or on the stage, grasped the fullsignificance of Behrend’s words when he said, “We asked Mr. Tesla to accept thismedal.” And fewer still were the members of the Institute who had any conceptionof the extent or importance of Tesla’s contribution to their science. His majorinventions had been announced thirty years before. The majority of the engineerspresent belonged to the younger generation; and they had been taught fromtextbooks that almost completely omitted mention of Tesla’s work.FIFTEENimage [images/00003.jpg] THE announcement by Tesla in his latter years that attracted the greatest amountof attention concerned his discovery of what has briefly, but not tooaccurately, been termed a death ray. Earlier reports had come from Europe of theinvention of death rays, beams of radiation that would cause airships on whichthey impinged to burst into flame, the steel bodies of tanks to melt and themachinery of ships to stop operating, but all gave indications of being part ofthe game of diplomatic buncombe.The prelude to Tesla’s death-ray announcement came several years in advance, inthe form of a declaration that he had made discoveries concerning a new form ofpower generation which, when applied, would make the largest existingturbine-dynamo units in the powerhouses look like pygmies. He made thisannouncement in interviews with the press in 1933, and declared that he was alsoworking on a new kind of generator for the production of radiation of all kindsand in the greatest intensities. He made similar announcements the followingyear.Both of these announcements were entitled to receive the most seriousconsideration, even though they were not accompanied by experimental evidence,and revealed no technical details.When Tesla was talking as a scientist he was opposed to wars on moral, economicand all practical and theoretical grounds. But, like most scientists, when hestopped thinking as a scientist and let his emotions rule his thoughts, he foundexceptions in which he felt some wars and situations were justifiable. As ascientist he was unwilling to have the discoveries of scientists applied to thepurposes of war makers, but when the emotional phase of his nature took theruling position he was willing to apply his genius to devising measures thatwould prevent wars by supplying protective devices.This attitude is exemplified in the following statement, which he had preparedin the twenties but did not publish:At present many of the ablest minds are trying to devise expedients forpreventing a repetition of the awful conflict which is only theoretically endedand the duration and main issues of which I correctly predicted in an articleprinted in the Sun of December so, 1914. The League is not a remedy but, on thecontrary, in the opinion of a number of competent men, may bring about resultsjust the opposite. It is particularly regrettable that a punitive policy wasadopted in framing the terms of peace because a few years hence it will bepossible for nations to fight without armies, ships or guns, by weapons far moreterrible, to the destructive action and range of which there is virtually nolimit. Any city at any distance whatsoever from the enemy can be destroyed byhim and no power on earth can stop him from doing so. If we want to avert animpending calamity and a state of things which may transform this globe into aninferno, we should push the development of flying machines and wirelesstransmission of energy without an instant’s delay and with all the power andresources of the nation.Tesla saw preventive possibilities in his new invention which embodied“death-ray” characteristics, and which was made several years after theforegoing statement was written. He saw it providing a curtain of protectionwhich any country, no matter how small, could use as a defense against invasion.While he might offer it as a defensive weapon, however, there would be nothingto stop military men from using it as a weapon of offense.Tesla never gave the slightest hint concerning the principles under which hisdevice operated.THERE are indications, at any rate, that Tesla was working on a high-potentialdirect-current system for generating and transmitting electricity to longdistances. Direct current at very high voltages can be transmitted much moreefficiently than alternating current. There has been no practical way ofgenerating direct current at high voltages. It was because of this that Tesla’spolyphase alternating-current system was adopted for our present nationwidesuperpower system, since it made the use of high voltages practicable. But,despite its efficiencies, it entailed certain losses which could be eliminatedif direct current of sufficiently high voltage could be obtained. Such a systemwould supersede his alternating-current system but not displace it.Direct current, perhaps at several million volts potential, would be used totransmit current for long distances, perhaps clear across the continent,providing a kind of express transmission system, to which the existingalternating-current system would be tied for local distribution. In addition tothe direct-current transmission system, he appears to have worked out ahigh-voltage direct-current generator and a new type of direct-current motorwhich would operate without a commutator.The inventions were starting to dam up in Tesla’s mind like water in a reservoirto which there was no outlet.Just as he developed his alternating-current system into the high-frequency,high-potential field of power distribution by wireless, which he demonstrated atColorado Springs, so he appears to have carried his direct-current systemforward and linked it with his alternating-current wireless distribution system,so that he could use both in a super-interlocking system. As this remainedunapplied, he further evolved it and produced a plan for operating with it whatappears to be a beam system of wireless transmission of energy which mightinvolve the use of a stream of particles such as are used in the atom-smashingcyclotron.As time passed from the latter twenties, through the latter thirties, the hintswhich Tesla would drop about his work became more complicated, and so ambiguousthat they aroused skepticism rather than respect. He would not reveal the natureof his discoveries until he had secured patents, and he would not apply forpatents until he had made actual working models, and he could not make theworking models because he had no money. Samuel Insull, the public utilitiesmagnate, had for many years made frequent and generous contributions to Tesla.They were usually applied to outstanding debts and were not large enough toenable him to engage in laboratory research work.Tesla, however, never exhibited the slightest outward sign of bitterness overthe situation. Instead, he always appeared in the rô1e of confirmed optimist,always maintaining a spirit of hopefulness that he Would achieve by his ownefforts the money he needed to carry out his elaborated plans. This is indicatedin a letter he wrote to B. A. Behrend, who had induced him to accept the EdisonMedal, and who was probably in his confidence to a greater extent than anyoneelse:“I am hard at work on those discoveries of mine, I told you about, from which Ihope to derive a sum in eight figures (not counting the cents, of course)enabling me to erect that wireless power plant at my own expense. And what Ishall accomplish by that other invention I came specially to see you about, I donot dare to tell you. This is stated in all seriousness.”The invention about which he dared not speak was probably his direct-currentgenerating and transmitting system.In an interview given in 1933, he said his power generator was of the simplestkind—just a big mass of steel, copper and aluminum, comprising a stationary anda routing part, peculiarly assembled. He was planning, he said, to generateelectricity and transmit it to a distance by his alternating system; but thedirect-current system could also be employed if the heretofore insuperabledifficulties of insulating the transmission line could be overcome.A year later he had developed the beam-transmission plan; and he made anambiguous statement concerning it which was reported in the press as news of a“death ray” since the description seemed to fit into the same mold as those wildand improbable statements that had come out of Europe some years before. Awriter in the New York World-Telegram described Tesla’s plan as “nebulous.” Thisdrew a reply from Tesla (July 24, 1934) in which the following paragraphsappeared:Still another item which has interested me is a report from Washington in theWorld Telegram of July 13, 1934, to the effect that scientists doubt the deathray effects. I am quite in agreement with these doubters and probably morepessimistic in this respect than anybody else, for I speak from long experience.Rays of the requisite energy cannot be produced, and, then again, theirintensity diminishes with the square of the distance. Not so the agent I employ,which will enable us to transmit to a distant point more energy than is possibleby any other kind of ray.We are all fallible, but as I examine the subject in the light of my presenttheoretical and experimental knowledge I am filled with deep convictions that Iam giving to the world something far beyond the wildest dreams of inventors ofall time.This is the first written statement by Tesla in which he mentions his “ray”; butI had, as already noted, obtained some confidential statements from him, duringthe preceding year or so, concerning results he hoped to achieve through his newdiscovery, the nature of which he kept as a well-protected secret. Three yearslater, in 1937, Tesla permitted me to write a news story for the New York HeraldTribune on his new power-and-ray discovery. In it I stressed the usefulness ofthe discovery for delivering power to ships tor travel across the ocean, thuseliminating the need for carrying fuel supplies, rather than its use as a weaponfor defense or offense.On this occasion I tried to get him to reveal some technical details, but hesuccessfully parried every question and gave no information beyond the statementthat the transmitting plant on shore was one which he would be able to erect ata cost of about $2,000,000, and the energy would be transmitted by a ray or beamof infinitesimally small cross section, one hundred thousandth of a centimeterin diameter. To other newspapers which copied my story he gave the figure as onemillionth of a square centimeter.Later, I wrote a somewhat critical review of his plan and sought to draw him outby reviewing the properties of electromagnetic radiation in all parts of thespectrum. Finding none that possessed any known characteristics needed to makehis ray practical, I also reviewed the properties of all known particles ofmatter, and stated that none of these would serve his purpose with the possibleexception of the unelectrified particle, the neutron. He made no revealingresponse to the article.At his birthday dinner in 1938, at the Hotel New Yorker, Tesla described brieflyhis combination wireless-power transmission and death ray, adding little to whathas already been stated; and in a later part of his speech he declared that hehad developed a method for interplanetary communication, in which he would beable to transmit not only communication signals of small strength but energiesinvolving thousands of horsepower.On this occasion I asked him if he would be specific concerning the effectsproduced, and whether they would be visible from the earth; for example—could heproduce an effect on the moon “\\ sufficiently large to be seen by an astronomerwatching the moon through a high-power telescope? To this he replied that hewould be able to produce in the dark region of the thin crescent new moon anincandescent spot that would glow like a bright star so that it could be seenwithout the aid of a telescope.It would appear probable that Tesla proposed to use for this purpose the beam hedescribed in connection with his wireless-power “death ray.” The limitation ofthe destructive effects of the beam, which he visualized as two hundred miles,was due to the fact that the beam had a straight-line trajectory. Tesla statedthat the curvature of the earth set a limit on the distance of operation, so thetwo-hundred-mile span of operation gave an indication of the greatest practicalheight of a tower from which the beam could be directed. He expected to usepotentials of about 50,000,000 volts in his system, but whether of direct oralternating current is unknown.The only written statement by Tesla on this subject is in his manuscript of thetalk which was delivered, in absentia, some months later before the Institute ofImmigrant Welfare in response to its honorary citation. In this was included thefollowing paragraph:“To go to another subject: I have devoted much of my time during the year pastto perfecting of a new small and compact apparatus by which energy inconsiderable amounts can now be flashed through interstellar space to anydistance without the slightest dispersion. I had in mind to confer with myfriend, George E. Hale, the great astronomer and solar expert, regarding thepossible use of this invention in connection with his own researches. In themeantime, however, I am expecting to put before the Institute of France anaccurate description of the device with data and calculations and claim thePierre Gutzman Prize of 100,000 francs for means of communication with otherworlds, feeling perfectly sure that it will be awarded to me. The money, ofcourse, is a trifling consideration, but for the great historical honor of beingthe first to achieve this miracle I would be almost willing to give my life.”"},{"pageContent":"FOURTH PART [index_split_004.html#filepos4827] SELF-MADE SUPERMAN [index_split_004.html#filepos4827]"},{"pageContent":"SIXTEENimage [images/00003.jpg] IT WAS during a period when he was most busily occupied with his experimentswith high-frequency and high-potential currents, from 1892 to 1894, that Teslahad found time to give serious thought to yet another type of problem, matterand energy; and from it he derived what he described as a new physicalprinciple. This he developed to the point at which he was able to propound a newdynamic theory of gravity.While this principle guided much of his thinking, he did not make anyannouncements concerning it until close to the end of his life. Such disclosuresas have been made, however, leave this much obvious: Tesla considered his theorywholly inconsistent with the theory of relativity, and with the modern theoryconcerning the structure of the atom and the mutual interconversion of matterand energy. Tesla continuously attacked the validity of Einstein’s work; anduntil two or three years before his death, he ridiculed the belief that energycould be obtained from matter.These antagonisms were most unfortunate, as they placed Tesla in conflict withmodern experimental physics. This was totally unnecessary, for Tesla couldundoubtedly have adhered to his principle and interpreted it so that it was notinconsistent with the modern theories. The antagonism was probably attributableto psychological factors rather than scientific inconsistencies.The only statement Tesla has made concerning his principle and his theory isthat contained in the lecture he prepared for delivery before the Institute ofImmigrant Welfare (May 12, 1938). In this he stated:During the succeeding two years [1893 and 1894] of intense concentration I wasfortunate enough to make two far reaching discoveries. The first was a dynamictheory of gravity, which I have worked but in all details and hope to give tothe world very soon. It explains the causes of this force and the motions ofheavenly bodies under its influence so satisfactorily that it will put an end toidle speculation and false conceptions, as that of curved space….Only the existence of a field of force can account for the motions of the bodiesas observed, and its assumption dispenses with space curvature. All literatureon this subject is futile and destined to oblivion. So are all attempts toexplain the workings of the universe without recognizing the existence of theether and the indispensable function it plays in the phenomena.My second discovery was of a physical truth of the greatest importance. As Ihave searched the entire scientific records in more than a half dozen languagesfor a long time without finding the least anticipation, I consider myself theoriginal discoverer of this truth, which can be expressed by the statement:There is no energy in matter other than that received from the environment.On my 79th birthday I made a brief reference to it, but its meaning andsignificance have become clearer to me since then. It applies rigorously tomolecules and atoms as well as to the largest heavenly bodies, and to all matterin the universe in any phase of its existence from its very formation to itsultimate disintegration.Tesla’s mind was inflexible in the matter of his attitude toward relativity andthe modern theories. Had he published his principle and theory of gravity at thebeginning of the century it would, without doubt, have then received veryserious consideration and perhaps general acceptance, although it is difficultto make an intelligent surmise without knowledge of his postulates. Ifpublished, it might have had some influence on Einstein’s thinking. The field offorce which Tesla mentions as being necessary to explain the movements of theplanets might have been his contribution to eliminating the need for the etherwhich was accomplished by Einstein’s theory. The two theories might have beenmerged, in which case there probably would have resulted a harmoniousdevelopment of the thinking of the two geniuses.In this latter case Tesla could very well have shaped his thinking to see aconsistency between his theory that there is no energy in matter other than thatreceived from its environment, and the modern viewpoint that all matter consistsof energy into which it is convertible; for when matter is converted to energy,the energy returns to the environment from whence it came when the particleswere formed.There appears to be a frustration involved in Tesla’s attitude which could havebeen resolved by early publication of his theory. If this had taken place,Tesla’s powerful intellect and his strange ability to solve problems would havebeen brought to bear on the problems of atomic physics and he, in turn, wouldhave received tremendous benefits from the application of the newer knowledge inthe fields in which he was supreme.Tesla’s ability to generate tremendously high voltages would have been of greatassistance in the task of “smashing the atom.” Other scientists, even today, arestruggling to produce currents with a potential of 5,000,000 volts, whereasTesla, forty years ago, had generated potentials of 135,000,000 volts.The inconsistency between Tesla’s principle and the picture of the atomconsisting of a small complex nucleus surrounded by planetary electrons—whichinconsistency was more existent in Tesla’s mind than in Nature—caused him todevelop an antagonism to all scientific developments which called for a picturethat differed from the billiard-ball type of atom in vogue in theeighteen-eighties. To him, a smashed atom was like a smashed billiard ball.The electron, however, had a real existence to Tesla. He accepted it as a kindof sub-atom, a fourth state of matter, as described by Sir William Crookes, whodiscovered it. Tesla visualized it as associated with but not a part of theatom. The electric charge it carried was entirely distinct from the electron.Electricity, to him, was a fluid much more highly attenuated than any known formof matter, and with highly specific properties of its own for which it was notdependent upon matter. The charge on the electron was due to a surface layer ofelectricity covering it, and it could receive many layers, giving it multiplechages, all of which could be dissipated. These statements were similar to thosewhich he had published a half-century before.According to the modern theory, on the other hand, the electrical nature of theelectron, described as its charge, is a characteristic inherent in the nature ofthe energy crystallized about a point which gives the electron its existence,and the electron is one of the particles, or units of energy, of which the atomis composed.In discussing articles by scientists in the field of atomic physics, Tesla wouldregister his protests that their theories were untenable and the claimsunfounded; and he was particularly emphatic when experiments in which energyemissions from atoms were recorded.“Atomic power is an illusion,” he frequently declared. He furnished severalwritten statements in which he said that with his currents of several millionvolts he had, countless times, smashed uncounted billions of atoms—and he knewthat no emission of energy accompanied the process.On one occasion Tesla took me to task rather severely for my failure to publishhis statements. I replied: “I withheld them in order to protect your reputation.You are making too great a virtue of consistency. It is not necessary that youadhere to the theories you held as a youth, and I am convinced that deep down inyour heart you hold newer theories that are in harmony with scientificdevelopments in other fields, but because you have disagreed with, and attacked,some modern theories you feel you must be consistent and attack them all. I amconvinced that in the development of your death-ray device your thinking wasalong the lines of the modern theory of the structure of the atom and the natureof matter and energy.”Tesla thereupon let me know in no uncertain terms that he held very definiteideas concerning efforts on the part of others to do his thinking for him. Thisconversation took place about 1935; and I did not hear from him for many months.I observed, however, that in his later conversations he was much less dogmaticconcerning modern theories, and a few years later he stated that he was planningan apparatus which would make possible a definite testing of the modern theoryof atomic structure, with the expectation that his new power system and energybeam would release atomic energy more effectively than any device then in use byphysicists.Having endorsed, finally, the belief that man will be able to smash, transmute,create or destroy atoms, and control vast amounts of energy, he waxed poetic onthe subject. He extended man’s control over atoms and energy to a cosmic scale,and saw him shaping the universe according to our desires. In an unpublishedarticle, entitled “Man’s Greatest Achievement,” he wrote:There manifests itself in the fully developed being—Man—a desire mysterious,inscrutable and irresistible: to imitate nature, to create, to work himself thewonders he perceives. Inspired to this task he searches, discovers and invents,designs and constructs, and covers with monuments of beauty, grandeur and awe,the star of his birth. He descends into the bowels of the globe to bring forthits hidden treasures and to unlock its immense imprisoned energies for his use.He invades the dark depths of the ocean and the azure regions of the sky. Hepeers into the innermost nooks and recesses of molecular structure and lays bareto his gaze worlds infinitely remote. He subdues and puts to his service thefierce, devastating spark of Prometheus, the titanic forces of the waterfall,the wind and the tide. He tames the thundering bolt of Jove and annihilates timeand space. He makes the great Sun itself his obedient toiling slave. Such is hispower and might that the heavens reverberate and the whole earth trembles by themere sound of his voice.What has the future in store for this strange being, born of a breath, ofperishable tissue, yet immortal, with his powers fearful and divine? What magicwill be wrought by him in the end? What is to be his greatest deed, his crowningachievement?Long ago he recognized that all perceptible matter comes from a primarysubstance, or a tenuity beyond conception, filling all space, the Akasa orluminiferous ether, which is acted upon by the life-giving Prana or creativeforce, calling into existence, in never ending cycles, all things and phenomena.The primary substance, thrown into infinitesimal whirls of prodigious velocity,becomes gross matter; the force subsiding, the motion ceases and matterdisappears, reverting to the primary substance.Can Man control this grandest, most awe-inspiring of all processes in nature?Can he harness her inexhaustible energies to perform all their functions at hisbidding, more still cause them to operate simply by the force of his will?If he could do this, he would have powers almost unlimited and supernatural. Athis command, with but a slight effort on his part, old worlds would disappearand new ones of his planning would spring into being. He could fix, solidify andpreserve the ethereal shapes of his imagining, the fleeting visions of hisdreams. He could express all the creations of his mind on any scale, in formsconcrete and imperishable. He could alter the size of this planet, control itsseasons, guide it along any path he might choose through the depths of theUniverse. He could cause planets to collide and produce his suns and stars, hisheat and light. He could originate and develop life in all its infinite forms.To create and to annihilate material substance, cause it to aggregate in formsaccording to his desire, would be the supreme manifestation of the power ofMan’s mind, his most complete triumph over the physical world, his crowningachievement, which would place him beside his Creator, make him fulfill hisultimate destiny.Tesla, in his eighties, was still manifesting the superman complex, and on evenmore elaborate a scale than when in his twenties. In his earlier dreams hisvisions were terrestrial, but in later life they were extended to embrace theentire universe.Even on the cosmic scale, however, Tesla spoke in terms of matter and energy.These two entities, according to his reasoning, were sufficient to explain allobserved phenomena, a situation which militated against the discovery of any newagencies.The civilizations of the ancient world knew nothing of electricity andmagnetism; the controlled manifestations of these two phases of a singleforce-entity have provided us with a new civilization and a new cultural outlookon life, as well as broadened horizons within the life sphere. There is noreason why we should not look forward to the discovery of new forces which areas different from electricity as electricity is from the winds of the air andthe waves of the ocean. If inadequate explanations of vital phenomena areaccepted as satisfactory, embracing extravagant extensions of known forces, theway is closed to the discovery of unknown forces and the opening of any newrealms of knowledge. This was the limitation which the science of the lastquarter of the past century placed upon itself; and Tesla’s philosophy was aproduct of that period. It was difficult for him to reshape it in his lateryears.THE memory departments of most individuals’brains are like office filingsystems, an excellent dumping ground for everything that comes along—but try tofind a filed item later. Tesla’s powers of memorizing were prodigious. A quickreading of a page gave him a permanent record of it; he could always recallbefore his eyes a photographic record of it to be read, and could study at hisconvenience. Study, for Tesla, was a far different process than for the averageperson. He had no need for a reference library; he could consult in his mind anypage of any textbook he had read, any formula, equation, or item in a table oflogarithms, and it would flash before his eyes. He could recite scores of books,complete from memory. The saving in time which this made possible in researchwork was tremendous.This strange faculty of vision was supernormal but entirely natural and was due,probably, to a structural characteristic in his brain which provided a directchannel between the memory and the visual areas of his cerebral hemispheres. Itprovided him with a very useful new sense.The human brain is made up of two sections, the right and left sides, each ofwhich, in some of its phases, is a complete brain; and both halves functiontogether as a single unit. There are many layers in the brain parallel with itssurface, each connected to the others by complex nerve fibers, like threadssewing together the layers of an onion. The outer layer seems to be directlyassociated with our consciousness. The surface is divided into specializedareas. There is a band across the mid-section of each hemisphere, from ear toear over the top of the brain, devoted to the senses, and here are separateareas for the sensory faculties—sight, hearing, taste, smell—while near by areregions for the motor or muscular activities of the various parts of the body.The back lobe of the brain appears to be the home of the memory and the frontlobe of some higher faculties of integration, the nature of which we do not asyet understand.In normal processes of seeing, the eye forms a picture of an object on theretina, a screen on the back of the eyeball. The retina is supplied withthousands of nerve endings all packed together like stalks of asparagus in abunch. The tip ends are provided with photosensitive processes, and when lightstrikes any one of them it transmits over the optic nerve a signal to the brainwhich is recorded as a visual response in the sight area of each half of thebrain. By co-operation of all the nerve endings, the complete picture seen istransmitted. The actual seeing, then, is done in the brain and not in the eye.When an object is seen by the brain, a record of that visual experience istransmitted from the sight area of the brain to the memory center in the backpart of the brain; and similar records are sent by all other sensory centers.Ordinarily this is a one-way process, the stimuli going in the direction of thememory and nothing coming back to the sensory area. If this were not so, oursense areas of the brain would be continuously re-enacting old experiences andmixing them with the new, incoming experiences, causing annoying confusion.The memory area contains a complete record of all sensory experiences we havehad. In our thinking processes we use some little-understood mechanism forconnecting together items stored in the memory area to produce usefulcombinations or relationships, or, in other words, new ideas. The memory appearsto function on a subconscious level but we seem to be able to activate fibersthat reach down to the desired strata at the right point to connect the memorylevel with the consciousness level. In this way we can recall experiences, butthis experience of memory is far different from the original experience of sightout of which the original memory record was made.If, however, in this process of recollection, the nerve fiber linking the sightarea of the brain and the memory area were to be activated, then we would seeagain by the sharp processes of vision the object which caused the memory recordwe are trying to recollect.The act of creative thinking seems to consist of assembling two or more memoryrecords of sensory experiences into a combination which possesses entirely newcharacteristics that were not apparent in the component parts. If the nervelinkage just referred to were to operate in a two-way process with the visualarea, then we would be able to see the new creation as if it were a reallyexisting object seen by the eye, although the whole operation was limited to thebrain.This process is hypothetically the one which took place in Tesla’s brain andgave him tremendously greater powers of creative work than are possible to theordinary individual. Was this conceivably a new invention made by Mother Natureand tried out by her on Tesla?Tesla himself never understood the neurological, or physiological, processesunderlying this strange faculty. To him it was an absolutely real experience tosee in front of him as solid objects the subjects of his creative thoughts. Hebelieved that the image of the thing he saw was sent back from the brain alongthe optic nerve to the eye, and that it existed as a picture on the retinawhere, by some suitable means, it could be seen by others—or that by means ofadequate amplifying devices, such as are used in television, it could beprojected on a screen. He even proposed such devices.*Tesla described his experience with this strange faculty in an interview with M.K. Wisehart, published under the title “Making Your Imagination Work for You” inthe American Magazine, April, 1921. He stated:During my boyhood I had suffered from a peculiar affliction due to theappearance of images, which were often accompanied by strong flashes of light.When a word was spoken, the image of the object designated would present itselfso vividly to my vision that I could not tell whether what I saw was real ornot…. Even though I reached out and passed my hand through it, the image wouldremain fixed in space.In trying to free myself from these tormenting appearances, I tried toconcentrate my thoughts on some peaceful, quieting scene I had witnessed. Thiswould give me momentary relief; but when I had done it two or three times theremedy would begin to lose its force. Then I began to take mental excursionsbeyond the small world of my actual knowlege. Day and night, in imagination, Iwent on journeys—saw new places, cities, countries, and all the time I triedhard to make these imaginary things very sharp and clear in my mind. I imaginedmyself living in countries I had never seen, and I made imaginary friends, whowere very dear to me and really seemed alive.This I did constantly until I was seventeen, when my thoughts turned seriouslyto invention. Then, to my delight, I found I could visualize with the greatestfacility. I needed no models, drawings, or experiments. I could picture them allin my mind….By that faculty of visualizing, which I learned in my boyish efforts to ridmyself of annoying images, I have evolved what is, I believe, a new method ofmaterializing inventive ideas and conceptions. It is a method which may be ofgreat usefulness to any imaginative man, whether he is an inventor, businessmanor artist.Some people, the moment they have a device to construct or any piece of work toperform, rush at it without adequate preparation, and immediately becomeengrossed in details, instead of the central idea. They may get results, butthey sacrifice quality.Here, in brief, is my own method: After experiencing a desire to invent aparticular thing, I may go on for months or years with the idea in the back ofmy head. Whenever I feel like it, I roam around in my imagination and thinkabout the problem without any deliberate concentration. This is a period ofincubation.Then follows a period of direct effort. I choose carefully the possiblesolutions of the problem. I am considering, and gradually center my mind on anarrowed field of investigation. Now, when I am deliberately thinking of theproblem in its specific features, I may begin to feel that I am going to get thesolution. And the wonderful thing is, that if I do feel this way, then I know Ihave really solved the problem and shall get what I am after.The feeling is as convincing to me as though I already had solved it. I havecome to the conclusion that at this stage the actual solution is in my mindsubconsciously, though it may be a long time before I am aware of itconsciously.Before I put a sketch on paper, the whole idea is worked out mentally. In mymind I change the construction, make improvements, and even operate the device.Without ever having drawn a sketch I can give the measurements of all parts toworkmen, and when completed all these parts will fit, just as certainly asthough I had made the actual drawings. It is immaterial to me whether I run mymachine in my mind or test it in my shop.The inventions I have conceived in this way have always worked. In thirty yearsthere has not been a single exception. My first electric motor, the vacuum tubewireless light, my turbine engine and many other devices have all been developedin exactly this way.That Tesla believed his mental visualizations brought images from his brain tothe back of his eye is indicated by some statements he made in his famouslecture before the National Electric Light Association convention at St. Louis,in March, 1893, when announcing his discovery of radio. These statements aboutvision had no relationship to the subject of the lecture, and the fact that heinterjected them indicated that his experiences with this strange power had apowerful influence on his inventive thinking. He said:It can be taken as a fact, which the theory of the action of the eye implies,that for each external impression, that is for each image produced on theretina, the ends of the visual nerves, concerned in the conveyance of theimpressions to the mind, must be under a peculiar stress or in a vibratorystate. It now does not seem improbable that, when by the power of thought animage is evoked, a distinct reflex action, no matter how weak, is exerted uponcertain ends of the visual nerves, and therefore upon the retina. Will it everbe within human power to analyze the condition of the retina, when disturbed bythought or reflex action, by the help of some optical or other means of suchsensitiveness that a clear idea of its state might be obtained? If this werepossible, then the problem of reading one’s thoughts with precision, like thecharacters of an open book, might be much easier to solve than many problemsbelonging to the domain of positive physical science, in the solution of whichmany, if not the majority, of scientific men implicitly believe.Helmholtz has shown that the fundi of the eye are themselves luminous, and hewas able to see in total darkness the movements of his arm by the light of hisown eyes. This is one of the most remarkable experiments recorded in the historyof science, and probably only a few men could satisfactorily repeat it, for itis very likely that the luminosity of the eyes is associated with uncommonactivity of the brain and great imaginative power. It is fluorescence of brainaction, as it were.Another fact having a bearing on this subject, which has probably been noted bymany, since it is stated in popular expressions, but which I cannot recollect tohave found chronicled as a positive result of observation is that, at times,when a sudden idea or image presents itself to the intellect, there is a painfulsensation of luminosity produced in the eye observed even in broad daylight.Forty years later Tesla was still interested in the possibility of capturing aphotographic record of thoughts. He stated in interviews that if his theory werecorrect—that thoughts are recorded on the retina—it should be possible tophotograph what is revealed on this screen in the eye, and project enlargedimages of it.There is nothing illogical about Tesla’s reasoning concerning his strangefaculty of visualizing and the possibility of finding a corresponding image onthe retina. There is a bare possibility that in an extreme case, as was his, areflex arc may have extended from the brain to the retina; but the probabilitythat it did not is stronger. If he had possessed the ability to take others intohis confidence in his experiments, he would have been able to stage some simpletests in the laboratory of an ophthalmologist which would have given him somedefinite experimental evidence to support or dispose of his theories, as far asphotographic thought images were concerned.ABOUT 1920 Tesla had prepared, although he never published, an announcement ofwhat he declared was “An Astounding Discovery.” It involved factors which hecalled “cosmic”; but it likewise presented situations which the practicers ofvoodoo in Hayti, and other intellectually unveneered portions of the human race,would receive with perfect understanding. Since Tesla, one of the most highlycivilized individuals, could evolve this conception, it is probable that othersupercultured individuals or groups could find it in harmony with their ideasand experiences.It involves, however, a situation in which the soulless “matter and energy”automaton (to which status we have seen Tesla relegate human beings) is able tojudge ethical values, and, like a pontiff presiding over a court of morals,inflict punishment for transgressions.Here is Tesla’s description of his “astounding discovery”:While I have failed to obtain any evidence in support of the contentions ofpsychologists and spiritualists, I have proved to my complete satisfaction theautomatism of life, not only through continuous observation of individualactions, but even more conclusively, through certain generalizations. Theseamount to a discovery which I consider of the greatest moment to human societyand on which I shall briefly dwell.I got the first inkling of this astounding truth when I was still a very youngman, but for many years I interpreted what I noted simply as coincidences.Namely, whenever either myself or a person to whom I was attached, or a cause towhich I was devoted, was hurt by others in a particular way, which might be bestpopularly characterized as the most unfair imaginable, I experienced a singularand undefinable pain which, for want of a better term, I have qualified as“cosmic,” and shortly thereafter, and invariably, those who have inflicted itcame to grief. After many such cases I confided this to a number of friends, whohad the opportunity to convince themselves of the truth of the theory which Ihave gradually formulated and which may be stated in the following words.Our bodies are of similar construction and exposed to the same externalinfluences. This results in likeness of response and concordance of the generalactivities on which all our social and other rules and laws are based. We areautomata entirely controlled by the forces of the medium, being tossed aboutlike corks on the surface of the water, but mistaking the resultant of theimpulses from the outside for free will.The movements and other actions we perform are always life-preservative andthough seemingly quite independent from one another, we are connected byinvisible links. So long as the organism is in perfect order it respondsaccurately to the agents that prompt it, but the moment there is somederangement in any individual, his self-preservative power is impaired.Everybody understands, of course, that if one becomes deaf, has his eyesightweakened, or his limbs injured, the chances for his continued existence arelessened. But this is also true, and perhaps more so, of certain defects in thebrain which deprive the automaton, more or less, of that vital quality and causeit to rush into destruction.A very sensitive and observant being, with his highly developed mechanism allintact, and acting with precision in obedience to the changing conditions of theenvironment, is endowed with a transcending mechanical sense, enabling him toevade perils too subtle to be directly perceived. When he comes in contact withothers whose controlling organs are radically faulty, the sense asserts itselfand he feels the “cosmic” pain.The truth of this has been borne out in hundreds of instances and I am invitingother students of nature to devote attention to this subject, believing that,through combined and systematic effort, results of incalculable value to theworld will be attained.Tesla’s uncommunicative nature concerning his own intimate experiences hasundoubtedly deprived the world of many interesting stories. He wasunquestionably an abnormal individual, and of a type that does have what areknown as “psychic experiences.” He was emphatic in his denial that he ever hadexperiences of that sort; yet he has related incidents that clearly belong inthe psychic category. He seemed to be fearful that an admission of psychicexperiences would cause him to be misunderstood as supporting spiritualism, ortheories that something operates in life other than matter and energy.Whenever he was asked for his philosophy of life, he would elaborate a theorythat the human body is a meat machine which responds to external forces.One evening in New York, as Tesla and the author sat in the lobby of the HotelGovernor Clinton, the inventor discussed his meat-machine theory. It was amaterialistic philosophy typical of the Victorian era. We are, he held, composedof only those things which are identified in the test tube and weighed in thebalance. We have only those properties which we receive from the atoms of whichour bodies are constructed. Our experiences, which we call life, are a complexmixture of the responses of our component atoms to the external forces of ourenvironment.Such a philosophy has the virtue of simplicity and brevity of presentation; andit lends itself readily to being propounded with a positiveness that reacts onthe propounder, and transforms his attitude into one of dogmatism in whichemphatically expressed opinion is often confused with and substituted forfactual evidence.“I don’t believe a word of your theory,” I replied to Tesla’s exposition, “and,thank God, I am convinced you don’t believe a word of it either. The strongestproof I have that your theory is totally inadequate is that Tesla exists. Underyour theory we could not have a Tesla. Tesla possesses a creative mind and, inhis accomplishments, stands high above all other men. If your theory werecorrect, we would either all be geniuses like Tesla or we would all be mentalmediocrities living in these meat machines you describe, all responding in thesame way to the uniform, inanimate and uncreative external forces.”“But we are all meat machines,” replied Tesla, “and it happens that I am a muchmore sensitive machine than other people and I receive impressions to which theyare inert, and I can both understand and interpret these impressions. I amsimply a finer automaton than others,” he insisted.“This difference, which you admit between yourself and others. Dr. Tesla,completely disproves your theory, from my viewpoint, “I responded. “Yoursensitiveness would be a purely random incident. In the integration of thisrandomness, with respect to all individuals, all of us would probably once,possibly very much more frequently, rise to the height of manifesting genius asyou have done all your life. Even though the strokes of genius would manifestintermittently, all such individuals would receive the permanent rating asgeniuses. Genius does not manifest, even intermittently, in all of us, so yourmeat-machine theory appears, to me, untenable. If you were really frank with me,you would tell me of many experiences you have had, strange experiences, thatyou could not explain, that do not fit into your meat-machine theory, and whichyou have been afraid to discuss with anyone for fear they would misunderstandyou and perhaps ridicule you. I, however, will not find these experiencesstrange and beyond understanding, and one of these days you will open up andtell me about them.”As happened whenever I disagreed with him, after that evening I did not seeTesla for a while. In due time, however, I had a great many telephoneconversations with him. Our discussion seemed to have brought about a change inhis attitude toward me; and the next time I saw him he confided, “Mr. O’Neill,you understand me better than anyone else in the world.” I mention this toindicate the correctness of my belief that there was another Tesla hidden withinthat synthetic individual, the superman, which Tesla sought to pass off on thepublic as his real self.I did not, at this time, know about Tesla’s “astounding discovery,” or of someof his experiences about which I later learned. Had I known of these, mydiscussion with him could have been more specific.* The apparent flaw in his reasoning followed on his mistake in thinking that hewas doing this supernormal seeing with his eye, whereas the process was confinedto his brain; and the reflex action from the memory centers stopped at thevisual centers instead of, as he believed, being continued forward through theoptical nerve to the retina."},{"pageContent":"SEVENTEENimage [images/00003.jpg] ALTHOUGH Tesla thoroughly disbelieved in psychical phenomena, as previouslyindicated, he had many experiences which belong in this category; and he neitherdiscredited nor disavowed their reality. Such paradoxes were common in allmatters concerning him.Tesla, for example, completely rejected telepathy as a phase of psychicalphenomena, but he was firmly convinced that mind could communicate directly withmind. When asked about his belief in telepathy by a newspaper reporter in theearly nineties, Tesla replied: “What is usually taken as evidence of theexistence of telepathy is mere coincidence. But the working of the human mindthrough observation and reason interests and amazes me.” And then he added theparadoxical statement: “Suppose I make up my mind to murder you. In an instantyou would know it. Now, isn’t that wonderful enough? By what process does themind get at all this?”Reduced to its simplest terms, this interview states: Psychical telepathy doesnot exist as a reality; but the transmission of thought from mind directly tomind is a wonderful phenomenon, worthy of scientific study.The paradox here is due to the fact that, at the period in which Tesla wasspeaking, all psychical phenomena were supposed to be mediated by theintervention of spirits, or souls of the departed. Such a theory had no place inTesla’s philosophy, since he did not believe in immortality and felt that hecould explain all phenomena in terms of matter and energy; and the spirit wassupposed to lie beyond both of these categories. Thinking, however, was,according to Tesla’s theories, something which resulted from the interaction ofmatter and energy in the brain; and as this process probably produced waves inthe ether, there was no reason why the waves sent out by one mind should not bereceived by another, with resulting transfer of thought.Tesla would not discuss anything bordering on psychical experiences outside thecircle of his relatives, however. On one occasion, though, he probably saved thelives of three of his friends through a premonition; and he related the incidentto his nephew, Sava N. Kosanovich, who thus retells it:“I heard from Tesla that he had premonitions. He explained this in a mechanicalway, saying he was a sensitive receiver that registers any disturbance. Hedeclared that each man is like an automaton which reacts to externalimpressions.“He told me of one instance in which he had held a big party here in New Yorkfor some of his friends who planned to take a certain train for Philadelphia. Hefelt a powerful urge not to let the friends depart as planned and forciblydetained them so that they missed the train on which they had planned to travel.This train met with an accident in which there were a large number ofcasualties. This happened sometime in the go’s.“When his sister Angelina was ill, and died, he sent a telegram in which hesaid: ‘I had a vision that Angelina was arising and disappearing. I sensed allis not well. ‘”Tesla himself tells a most remarkable story of two supernormal events, in anunpublished manuscript. It records a situation in which, owing to overwork, hisstrange phenomenon of visualization disappeared, or died, and was reborn. Incoming back, it grew up quickly by repeating the visualization of events, ofearliest childhood and successively re-enacting later events, until it broughthim to the actual moment and capped the climax by then presenting avisualization of an event that had not yet taken place.The story of this experience, as told by Tesla:I will tell of an extraordinary experience which may be of interest to studentsof psychology. I had produced a striking phenomenon with my grounded transmitterand was endeavoring to ascertain its true significance in relation to thecurrents propagated through the earth. It seemed a hopeless undertaking and (ormore than a year I worked unremittingly but in vain. This profound study soentirely absorbed me that I became forgetful of everything else, even of myundermined health. At last, as I was on the point of breaking down, natureapplied the preservative, inducing lethal sleep.Regaining my senses, I realized with consternation that I was unable tovisualize scenes from my life except those of infancy, the very first ones thathad entered my consciousness. Curiously enough, these appeared before my visionwith startling distinctness and afforded me welcome relief. Night after night,when retiring, I would think of them and more and more of my previous existencewas revealed. The image of my mother was always the principal figure in thespectacle that slowly unfolded, and a consuming desire to see her againgradually took possession of me.This feeling grew so strong that I resolved to drop all work and satisfy mylonging. But I found it too hard to break away from the laboratory and severalmonths elapsed during which I succeeded in reviving all the impressions of mypast life up to the spring of 1892.In the next picture that came out of the mist of oblivion, I saw myself at theHotel de la Paix in Paris just coming to from one of my peculiar sleeping spellscaused by prolonged exertion of the brain. Imagine the pain and distress I feltwhen it flashed upon my mind that a dispatch was handed to me at that verymoment bearing the sad news that my mother was dying.It was especially remarkable that all during this period of partiallyobliterated memory I was fully alive to everything touching on the subject of myresearch. I could recall the smallest details and the least insignificantobservations in my experiments and even recite pages of texts and complexmathematical formulae.This was a prevision of the event which took place immediately after his Parislecture, as described in an earlier chapter, in which he rushed home in time tosee his mother just before she died.The second incident also concerns the death of his mother, and is told inanother connection in the same manuscript. He states:For many years I have endeavored to solve the enigma of death and watchedeagerly for every kind of spiritual indication. But only once in the course ofmy existence have I had an experience which, momentarily, impressed my assupernatural. It was at the time of my mother’s death.I had become completely exhausted by pain and long vigilance and one night wascarried to a building about two blocks from our home. As I lay helpless there, Ithought that if my mother died while I was away from her bedside-she wouldsurely give me a sign.Two or three months before I was in London in company with my late friend, SirWilliam Crookes, when spiritualism was discussed and I was under full sway ofthese thoughts. I might not have paid attention to other men but was susceptibleto his arguments as it was his epochal work on radiant matter, which I had readas a student, that made me embrace the electrical career.I reflected that the conditions for a look into the beyond were most favorable,for my mother was a woman of genius and particularly excelling in the powers ofintuition. During the whole night every fiber of my brain was strained inexpectancy, but nothing happened until early in the morning when I fell into asleep or perhaps a swoon, and saw a cloud carrying angelic figures of marvelousbeauty, one of whom gazed upon me lovingly and gradually assumed the features ofmy mother. The apparition slowly floated across the room and vanished and I wasawakened by an indescribably sweet song of many voices. In that instant acertitude, which no words can express, came upon me that my mother had justdied. And that was true.I was unable to understand the tremendous weight of the painful knowledge Ireceived in advance and wrote a letter to Sir William Crookes while still underthe domination of these impressions and in poor bodily health.When I recovered I sought for a long time the external cause Of this strangemanifestation and to my great relief, I succeeded after many months of fruitlesseffort. I had seen the painting of a celebrated artist, representingallegorically one of the seasons in the form of a cloud with a group of angelswhich seem to actually float in the air, and this had struck me forcibly. It wasexactly the same that appeared in my dream with the exception of my mother’slikeness. The music came from the choir in the church nearby at the early massof Easter morning, explaining everything satisfactorily m conformity toscientific facts.This “scientific” explanation by Tesla is, of course, totally unscientific. Itignores the three principal facts: one, that he had what he identified at thetime as a supernormal experience that brought with it a certitude that wordscould not describe; two, that this experience conveyed a revelation of hismother’s death, which he understood as such; and, three, that the event tookplace at the exact time of her death. The mechanism by which the phenomenon wasproduced utilized the memories stored in Tesla’s mind (of the painting, forexample) as the vehicle by which the information could be presented to him inunderstandable, though symbolic, form. In addition, there was the premonitiongiven several months previously as the climax of an extended phenomenoninvolving his mother.Tesla’s efforts to explain away “scientifically” everything of a psychical orspiritual nature, and the inadequate explanations which were satisfactory to himfor this purpose, are an indication of a conflict that was taking place withinhim in an effort to reconcile the purely materialistic “matter and energy”superman, into which he fashioned himself, with the underlying individual intowhich was born a great capacity for manifesting a deep spiritual insight intolife, but which he suppressed.ONE of the strangest luncheon parties Tesla ever staged was that given by him toa prize fighter, Fritzie Zivic. It was served in one of the private dining roomsof the Hotel New Yorker in 1940. Fritzie Zivic was scheduled to take part in aprize fight at Madison Square Garden for the welterweight championship, and theluncheon was held at noon on the day of the battle.Fritzie was one of six brothers, all of whom were either professional prizefighters or wrestlers. They lived at Pittsburgh where their father conducted abeer saloon. They were all born in Pittsburgh, but were the sons of parents,natives of Yugoslavia, whose difficult-to-pronounce Slavonic name was shortenedto Zivic by the brothers for their professional activities.Tesla had all six of the brothers as his guests. The only other guests wereWilliam L. Laurence, science writer of the New York Times, and the author.Three very diferent types of individuals were gathered around the table. The sixfighting brothers were all fine physical specimens. They averaged medium heightbut their powerful, chunky bodies, deep chests and broad shoulders made themseem rather short. All Were clear eyed, had clear complexions and clean-cutfeatures, were conservatively dressed in sack suits, and wore white linencollars. The two newspapermen presented an appearance in strong contrast withthe fighters, and in contrast with all the others was Tesla. Laurence, with hisgreat mop of jet black hair combed straight back, looked more like a musician.Tesla was seated at the head of the table. At his right sat Fritzie and next tohim ranged three of his brothers; Opposite them sat two other brothers and Mr.Laurence. The author sat at the far end of the table.Tesla did not arrange one of his famous duck dinners for this occasion—he hadother plans. As soon as the party was seated, Tesla stood up. The broad, stockyFritzie looked like a pygmy by comparison. Tesla was attired in a light-weight,tight-fitting, black, single-breasted sack suit which made him look more slenderthan usual. He had lost considerable weight in the preceding year, and thisaccentuated the sharp, bony contour which his face had taken on in his latteryears. His face, of the ascetic type, now was crowned with thinning locks ofsilvery white hair. His long slender hands, delicately shaped, started to waveover the seated prize fighter, who smiled up at the strange figure toweringabove him.“I am ordering for you a nice thick beefsteak, two inches thick, so that youwill have plenty of strength tonight to win the championship by a…”The fighter had both hands up, trying to interrupt the gesticulating figure ofthe scientist.“No,” protested Fritzie, “I am in training and I cannot eat a steak today.”“You listen to me,” shouted the insistent voice of Tesla, whose swinging armsand swaying body made him appear to be going through the antics of a cheerleader at a football game. “I’ll tell you how to train. You will train onbeefsteak. I am going to get you a beefsteak two inches thick and dripping withblood so that you will be able to…”The five brothers now joined Fritzie in his protest.“He can’t eat beeksteak today. He would lose the fight, Dr. Tesla,” theychorused.“No, he won’t lose the fight,” shot back Tesla. “You must think of the heroes ofour national Serbian poetry. They were red-blooded men and mighty fighters. Youtoo must fight for the glory of Serbia, and you need beefsteak dripping in bloodto do it!”Tesla had worked himself into a fine frenzy and was waving his arms and punchinghis palms as if he were at the ringside at an exciting moment in the battle. Hisfrenzy was lost on Fritzie and his brother pugilists. They were unmoved. Fritziereplied:“I will win, Dr. Tesla. I will fight for the glory of Yugoslavia and when thereferee gives me the decision and I speak into the microphone I will also say Ifought for Dr. Tesla—but no beefsteak today, Dr. Tesla, please.”“All right, Fritzie, you can have whatever you want,” Tesla agreed, “but yourbrothers will have their beefsteak.”“No, Dr. Tesla,” replied the eldest brother, “if Fritzie cannot have beefsteakneither will we. We will eat whatever he eats.”Fritzie ordered scrambled eggs on toast, with bacon, and a glass of milk. Thefive brothers gave duplicate orders and the two newspapermen did likewise.Tesla laughed heartily. “So that is what you do your fighting on today,” he saidbetween chuckles.For himself, the blood-thirsty 83-year-old scientist ordered “A dish of hotmilk”; and on this diet he managed to summon a tremendous amount of energyduring the meal which he directed toward urging Fritzie to give his opponent“everything you’ve got” and “make it a knockout in the first round.”It was a strange dinner. Despite the greatly outnumbering pugilists with theirhard set faces and chunky powerful bodies, the thin, bony faced, sharp featured,almost emaciated scientist with his sunken eyes, and his thin, silky silverhair, easily dominated the scene. Everyone was at ease despite thebrothers’anticipation of Fritzie’s impending battle and Tesla’s enthusiasm. Yet,in spite of the fact that everyone was relaxed, there was an eerie kind oftenseness linking the peculiar assemblage. Once I became conscious of thesituation, I watched developments with interest. I had experienced suchconditions previously but never under such circumstances as these.Mr. Laurence, of the Times, was seated at my right. He began to act a bitrestless while only halfway through the meal. Several times he looked under thetable. He in turn rubbed his ankle, his knee, his calf. He shifted his position.He rubbed his elbow and later his forearm. I managed to catch his eye.“Anything bothering you, Bill?” I asked, knowing full well what was happening.“There is something strange going on here,” he replied.A couple of minutes later he again reached, and looked under the table.“Feel anything?” I asked.“Yes,” he replied, seemingly a bit worried. “Something hot is touching me atdifferent spots. I can feel the heat but I can’t see anything that is doing. it.Do you feel it, too?” he asked.“Don’t worry about it,” I assured him. “I know what it is, and will tell you allabout it later. Just make as close observations as you can now.”The phenomenon continued until the party broke up. On our way back to ouroffices, I explained to Mr. Laurence.“You have often laughed at me for my gullibility in accepting the reality of theso-called psychic experiences,” I said. “Now you have had one. As soon as thatluncheon got well under way, after Dr. Tesla’s fiery outburst had quieted down,I sensed a peculiar tenseness in the air around me. At times the atmosphereseemed webby to my face and hands, so I suspected something unusual mighthappen.“That gathering was a perfect set-up for a psychic séance, and if it was held inthe dark there is no telling what we might have observed. Here were sixpowerfully built men, closely en rapport with each other, all filled to thebursting point with vital energy waiting for an event that would release anemotional outburst. In addition, we had Dr. Tesla staging an emotional outburstthe like of which he probably never before exhibited throughout his life. He wassupercharged with a different kind of vital energy. Just visualize Dr. Tesla asa medium acting as a co-ordinator, in some unknown way, to release these pent-upstores of vital energy which, again in an unknown manner, organized channels ofconduction through which this energy was transferred from levels of highpotential to levels of lower potential.“In this case we were the levels of lower potential, for I had exactly the sameexperiences you had, with these energy-transfer channels in space making contactwith various parts of my body and producing areas in which I, too, experienced asensation of intense heat.“You have read reports of séances in which the sitters reported that theyexperienced cool breezes. In these situations the action is the reverse of whatwe experienced, for in the séances energy was being drawn from the sitters to beorganized by the so-called medium for the production of phenomena.“Some kind of highly attenuated energy-bearing fluid was, in our experiencetoday, drawn from the bodies of the fighters and fed into our bodies—and in theséances it is drawn from the bodies of the sitters and fed into that of themedium, or to a central collecting point. In a report which I have written on myséance observations, I have called this substance psynovial fluid, which ismerely a convenient abbreviation for new psychic fluid.“Now that you have had today’s experience, you will understand why a few yearsago I risked having Dr. Tesla figuratively massacre me when I told him he wasusing his meat-machine philosophy of human life to cover up a lot of strangeexperiences he has had, and about which he was afraid to talk….”ANOTHER strange supernormal experience came to Tesla a few days before he died,but he was probably totally unaware that the situation had any unusual aspects.Early one morning he called his favorite messenger boy, Kerrigan, gave him asealed envelope, and ordered him to deliver it as quickly as possible. It wasaddressed to “Mr. Samuel Clemens, 35 South Fifth Ave., New York City.”Kerrigan returned in a short time with the statement that he could not deliverthe message because the address was incorrect. There is no such street as SouthFifth Ave., the boy reported; and in the neighborhood of that number on FifthAve. no one by the name of Clemens could be located.Tesla became annoyed. He told Kerrigan: “Mr. Clemens is a very famous author whowrites under the name Mark Twain, and you should have no trouble locating him atthe address I gave you. He lives there.”Kerrigan reported to the manager of his office and told him of his difficulty.The manager told him: “Of course you couldn’t find South Fifth Avenue. Its namewas changed to West Broadway years ago, and you won’t be able to deliver amessage to Mark Twain because he has been dead for twenty-five years.”Armed with this information, Kerrigan returned to Tesla, and the receptionaccorded his announcements left him still further confused.“Don’t you dare to tell me that Mark Twain is dead,” said Tesla. “He was in myroom, here, last night. He sat in that chair and talked to me for an hour. He ishaving financial difficulties and needs my help. So you go right back to thataddress and deliver that envelope—and don’t come back until you have done so.”(The address to which he sent the messenger was that of Tesla’s firstlaboratory!)Kerrigan returned to his office. The envelope, not too well sealed, was openedin the hope it would give some clue as to how the message could be delivered.The envelope contained a blank sheet of paper wrapped around twenty $5 bills!When Kerrigan tried to return the money, Tesla told him, with great annoyance,either to deliver the money or keep it.The last two decades of Tesla’s life were filled with many embarrassingsituations concerning unpaid hotel bills, and it would seem that by some processof transference this situation was shifted to his perception of Mark Twain.In view of Tesla’s highly intensified abilities to see the subjects of histhoughts as materialized objects, the simpler theory would be that by his usualprocess he had summoned the vision of Mark Twain. Tesla and Mark Twain were verygood friends, and the inventor had every reason for knowing that theheavy-thinking humorist was dead. Such being the case, how was he able to forgethis death? An objective theory can be offered which may, or may not, contain thecorrect explanation.Tesla’s memory was filled with many recollections of Mark Twain, dating back tohis early youth when he credited the reading of one of the humorist’s books withhaving brought him out of a critical illness. Twenty years later, when Teslarelated this incident, the humorist was so deeply affected he wept. A closefriendship followed, filled with many pleasant incidents. Every incidentconcerning Mark Twain was laid down in Tesla’s memory. How these records arefiled in the brain we do not know, but we might assume, for the moment, that thearrangement is orderly enough, with the system based on a time sequence in whicheach successive incident is filed on an earlier one, the latest ones being ontop. When Tesla started the process of visualizing Mark Twain in his room (andit probably operated on a subconscious level), he penetrated through the stackof memory records until he reached one that was satisfactory, and thenconcentrated so heavy a flow of vital energy in carrying this to thevisualization center of his brain that it burned out, and destroyed, ornarcotized, all later memory records that lay above it. As a result, after thevisualization process was over, there was no record in Tesla’s memory files ofanything that happened in his relations with Mark Twain, following the pleasantrecord he had so strangely relived. All subsequent memory records were wipedout, including his memory of Mark Twain’s death. It would then be perfectlylogical for him to reach the conclusion that Mark Twain was still alivelSeveral versions of this story are in circulation. They all have in commonTesla’s belief that Mark Twain was still alive; that he himself had veryrecently been in communication with him, and sought to send him money to meet adifficult situation.PIRATED,* lied about, ignored, Tesla carried on his work during the latterdecades, always hoping that he would be able to arrange matters so that he wouldbe able to finance all the inventions he was treasuring in his mind. His pridewould not permit him to admit financial embarrassment. He was forced frequentlyto leave hotels because of unpaid bills. His friend, B. A. Behrend, author ofthe book, The Induction Motor, which had clarified Tesla’s theory for engineers,when visiting New York and finding the inventor moved from the hotel where helast found him, in each instance paid his bills, and caused Tesla’s held baggageto be forwarded to him.In the early thirties, when it seemed as if financial discouragements would“have him down,” Tesla, however, appeared as optimistic as ever. He declared:“It is impossible for anyone to gain any idea of the inspiration I gain from myapplied inventions which have become a matter of history, and of the force itsupplies to urge me forward to greater achievements. I continually experience aninexpressible satisfaction from the knowledge that my polyphase system is usedthroughout the world to lighten the burdens of mankind and increase comfort andhappiness, and that my wireless system, in all of its essential features, isemployed to render a service to and bring pleasure to people in all parts of theearth.”When his wireless-power system was mentioned, he exhibited no sign of resentmentover the collapse of his project but replied philosophically: “Perhaps I was alittle premature. We can get along without it as long as my polyphase systemcontinues to meet our needs. Just as soon as the need arises, however, I havethe system ready to be used with complete success.”On his eightieth birthday he was asked if he expected actually to construct andoperate his recently announced inventions, and in reply he quoted, in German, astanza from Goethe’s Faust: > > > The God that in my bosom lives> > > > > Can move my deepest inmost soul,> > > > > Power to all my thought he gives> > > > > But outside he has no control.> > > > It had been Tesla’s intention to write his autobiography. He desired to have thestory of his work recorded with a most meticulous regard for accuracy; and this,he felt, no one but himself could bring to it. He declared that he had nointention of starting work on this project until he had accomplished theapplication of all of his major discoveries. Several persons who proposedwriting his biography received only a refusal of the requested co-operation.Kenneth Swezey, a writer on scientific subjects, maintained close contact withTesla for a number of years, and it was expected that Tesla would co-operatewith him in such a project. Swezey assembled seventy letters from leadingscientists and engineers in all parts of the world as a surprise for Tesla onhis seventy-fifth birthday, at which time the letters, bound in a memorialvolume, were presented to him. These letters, reprinted in Yugoslavia, led tothe establishment of the Tesla Institute in that country. Swezey was engaged inwar work and expected, at the time of Tesla’s death, to enter the Navy;otherwise he might have undertaken the task of writing Tesla’s biography. Tesla,even up to his eighty-fourth year, expected to recover more robust health and tolive beyond the century mark. It is probable, therefore, that he had not startedwork on his autobiography. Whether or not any parts of it have been written isimpossible to ascertain at the present time. All Tesla’s records were sealed bythe Custodian of Alien Property, although Tesla was a citizen of the UnitedStates.During the last half-dozen years of his life, Tesla, happily, was supplied withenough money to meet his immediate needs, thanks to the payment to him of anhonorarium of $7, 200 a year, by the Yugoslav government, as patron of the TeslaInstitute, established in Belgrade.* Even with this income, however, and with avery limited range of activity (being confined largely to his room), during thelast two years Tesla still managed to fall behind in his hotel bill. This wasowing to his unlimited generosity. He was very generous in bestowing tips on allwho performed the slightest service for him, and in responding to the slightestsuggestion that anyone was in need of assistance.During the latter part of 1942 he spent most of the time in bed, mentally activebut physically weak. He permitted no visitors to come to his room, not evenclose associates of earlier years. He insisted to hotel employees that he wasnot ill and refused to listen to suggestions that he have a doctor visit him. Hegave orders that even hotel employees were not to enter his room unless hesummoned them.On January 5, Tuesday morning, he permitted the maid to come to his room, andthen gave orders to guard his room closely so that he would not be disturbed.This was done. It was not unusual for Tesla to give orders that he was not to bedisturbed for protracted periods. Early Friday morning (January 8) a maid with apremonition, risking his displeasure, entered Tesla’s room and found him dead.He looked peaceful, as if resting, with a suggestion of a smile on his gauntbony face. The superman died as he had lived—alone.THE police were notified that Tesla had died alone and without medicalattendance. The coroner declared his death due to natural causes incident tosenility; and that he had died on the night of Thursday, January 7, 1943, somehours before the maid entered the room. Operatives from the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation came and opened the safe in his room and took the papers itcontained, to examine them for a reported important secret invention of possibleuse in the war. The body was removed to Campbell’s Funeral Parlors at MadisonAvenue and 81st Street.Funeral services were held at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, on Tuesday,January 12, at 4 P.M. Bishop Manning offered the opening sentences of the BurialOffice and Final Prayer. Following the services, the body was removed toFern-cliff Cemetery at Ardsley, N.Y. , and was later cremated.* Dr. W. H. Eccles concludes an obituary memorial, in Nature (London), February13, 1943:—“Throughout his long life of 85 years Tesla seldom directed attentionto his own successes, never wrote up again his old work, and rarely claimedpriority though continually pirated. Such reserve is particularly striking in amind so rich in creative thought, so competent in practical achievement.”* The Society for the Foundation of the Tesla Institute at Belgrade wasorganized as Tesla neared his eightieth year. It enlisted support from thescholars, the government, commercial interests and the people as a whole. Fromthe government and private sources an endowment was subscribed which wasadequate to erect and equip a research laboratory and maintain it in operationas an institute. The Institute was opened in 1936, in commemoration of Tesla’seightieth anniversary. A week of observance was held throughout Yugoslavia andformal celebrations were held at Belgrade on May 26, 27 and 28, at Zagreb on May50, and at his native village, Smiljan, on June 2 and also on July 12."},{"pageContent":"FIFTH PART [index_split_004.html#filepos4989] AFTERGLOW [index_split_004.html#filepos4989]"},{"pageContent":"EIGHTEENimage [images/00003.jpg] DESPITE his celibate life, and his almost hermitlike existence in his ownintellectual sphere, Tesla was, in his social contacts, a charming individual.The year he had spent digging ditches and doing hard manual labor, when he couldget a job of any kind, and his experience during that time of sleeping in anyshelter he could obtain and eating any kind of food he could manage to secure,undoubtedly made a tremendous and lasting impression on him. The fact that hecould never be induced to discuss this period would so indicate. Yet it probablysoftened him in a beneficial way—by a going-through-the-mill process. But it hadbeen a grievous insult to his personality to be valued only for the brutestrength in his muscles; and this rankled ever after.Once he had obtained funds through the founding of his laboratory and the saleof his patents to Westinghouse, he thereafter maintained an almost princelystatus. He knew how to wear clothes to increase the impressiveness of hisappearance; his tallness gave him something of an advantage over others; hisobvious physical strength brought him a respect that forbade any invasion of hisattitude; his excellent English and the care he exercised to use the languagecorrectly, and his command of a half-dozen other languages, established him as ascholar; and the first batch of his alternating-current inventions created forhim in the mind of the public a reputation for outstanding scientificaccomplishment. The fact that he always spoke of the value of his inventions tothe world, and not of the greatness of his own accomplishment, endeared him toall who met him.When Tesla was riding a tidal wave of popularity during the nineties, he wasaverse to publicity; but frequently well-known writers for the newspapers wereable to break through the barriers and secure “feature” articles. An excellentdescription of him, keyed to the manner of the period, is contained in anarticle written by Franklin Chester, in the Citizen of August 22, 1897. Theportion referring to his personal appearance and activities follows:So far as personal appearance goes no one can look upon him without feeling hisforce. He is more than six feet tall and very slender. Yet he possesses greatphysical power. His hands are large, his thumbs abnormally long, and this is asign of great intelligence. His hair is black and straight, a deep Shiningblack. He brushes it sharply from over his ears, so that it makes a ridge withserrated edges.His cheekbones are high and prominent, the mark of the Slav: his skin is likemarble that age has given the first searing of yellow. His eyes are blue, deeplyset, and they burn like balls of fire. Those weird flashes of light he makeswith his instruments seem also to shoot from them. His head is wedge shaped. Hischin is almost a point.Never was a human being filled with loftier ideals. Never did a man labor soUnceasingly, so earnestly, so unselfishly for the benefit of the race. Tesla isnot rich. He does not trouble himself about money. Had he chosen to follow inthe footsteps of Edison he could be, perhaps, the richest man in the world, andTesla is just 40 years old.Tesla is, above all things, a serious man, undoubtedly the most serious man inNew York. Yet he has a keen sense of humor and the most beautiful manners. He isthe most genuinely modest of men. He knows no jealousy. He has never decried theaccomplishments of another, never refused credit.When he talks you listen. You do not know what he is saying, but it enthrallsyou. You feel the importance without understanding the meaning. He speaks theperfect English of a highly educated foreigner, without accent and withprecision. He speaks eight languages equally well.The daily life of this man has been the same, practically, ever since he hasbeen in New York. He lives in the Gerlach, a very quiet family hotel, in 27thstreet, between Broadway and Sixth avenue. He starts for his laboratory before 9o’clock in the morning, all day long he lives in his weird, uncanny world,reaching forth to capture new power to gain fresh knowledge.No stranger ever sees him at his work. No one knows of his assistants. At rareintervals he presents some experiments in his laboratory, and there is nosacrifice that thousands of people would not make to gain admission to these.Usually he works until 6 o’clock, but he may stay later. The absence of naturallight does not trouble him. Tesla makes sunlight in his workshop.At exactly 8 o’clock he enters the Waldorf. He is attired in irreproachableevening clothes. In the winter time he never wears an evening jacket, but alwaysthe coat with tails.He finishes his dinner at exactly 10 o’clock, and leaves his hotel, either to goto his rooms to study or to return to his laboratory to work through the night.Arthur Brisbane, who later became Hearst’s famous editor, interviewed Tesla andpublished in The World, August 22, 1894, the longest story he had written on afamous person. He declared Tesla “Our Foremost Electrician—Greater Even thanEdison,” and included the following description of him:He has eyes set very far back in his head. They are rather light. I asked himhow he could have such light eyes and be a Slav. He told me that his eyes wereonce much darker, but that using his mind a great deal had made them many shadeslighter. I have often heard it said that using the brain makes the eyes lighterin color. Tesla’s confirmation of the theory through his personal experience isimportant.He is very thin, is more than six feet tall, and weighs less than a hundred andforty pounds. He has very big hands. His thumbs are remarkably big, even forsuch big hands. They are extraordinarily big. This is a good sign. The thumb isthe intellectual part of the hand. The apes have very small thumbs. Study themand you will notice this.Nikola Tesla has a head that spreads out at the top like a fan. His head isshaped like a wedge. His chin is as pointed as an ice-pick. His mouth is toosmall. His chin, though not weak, is not strong enough. His face cannot bestudied and judged like the faces of other men, for he is not a worker inpractical fields. He lives his life up in the top of his head, where ideas areborn, and up there he has plenty of room. His hair is jet black and curly. Hestoops—most men do when they have no peacock blood in them. He lives inside ofhimself. He takes a profound interest in his own work. He has that supply ofself-love and self-confidence which usually goes with success. And he differsfrom most of the men who are written and talked about in the fact that he hassomething to tell.Tesla had, to be sure, a sense of humor and enjoyed putting over a subtle joke.Before the period in which he became a regular diner at the Waldorf-Astoria, hedined nightly at Delmonico’s, then the smartest hostelry in the city, and agathering place for “The 400.” Tesla was the most famous and spectacular figureamong the famous patrons of the famous place, but he always dined alone. Hecould never be induced to join other groups and never had a guest of his own.After dining he would always return to work at his laboratory.One evening some of his friends, believing that he was working too hard andshould get some relaxation, induced him to join them in a game of billiards.They assumed he had neglected to learn how to play games, so, on arriving at thebilliard room, they explained to him how to hold the cue, strike the balls, andother elements of the game. Tesla had not played billiards in a dozen years; butduring his second year at Gratz, when he was a year ahead in his studies andspent his evenings in the cafes, he had become an expert billiardist. When theexperts at Delmonico’s gave him preparatory instruction, he asked some “dumb”questions, and made some intentional miscues. Taking on one of the players andstill asking silly questions, he tried the most difficult way of making shots—todemonstrate his purely amateur status—and made them, to the amazement of theexperts. Several of them took him on that evening, and he defeated all of themwith badly unbalanced scores. He declared the new game give him a wonderfulopportunity to practice very abstract mathematical theories; and the experts atDelmonko’s spread stories about the wonderful accomplishment of Scientist Teslain mastering the game in a single evening and defeating the best players in thecity. The story got into the newspapers. Tesla refused to play any more,declaring he was in danger of becoming so enthusiastic over the game that itwould interfere with his researches.This same man magnificent who graced the Waldorf-Astoria and Delmonico’s was notaverse, however, to visiting the Bowery, which was but a block away from hisHouston Street laboratory. He repaired to a thirst-quenching emporium on thatthoroughfare one afternoon shortly after a denizen of the Bowery, Steve Brodie,had achieved fame by jumping, or at least claiming to have jumped, off theBrooklyn Bridge. As Tesla raised his glass of whiskey he said to the bartender:“You know what Steve said as he was about to jump off the bridge—‘Down hegoes’”; and with that he downed his liquor in a gulp.A near-by drinker, a little the worse for several, misunderstood Tesla’s remarkand got the impression he had heard Steve Brodie telling the final episode ofhis feat. He rushed up to Tesla to buy him a drink, and was joined by hisfriends. Tesla with a laugh shook them off and dashed out of the bar, while themisguided drinker started after him yelling, “Stop him, that’s Steve.” On thestreet the pedestrians misunderstood the thick-tongued drinker’s shout andjoined him in the chase, calling “Stop, thief!” Tesla’s long legs rendered him avaluable service and he got a lead on the crowd, dashed into an alley, over afence and climbed a fire escape on the back of his own building, reached hislaboratory through a window, quickly donned a blacksmith’s apron and startedhammering a bar of metal. His pursuers, however, failed to trace him.Tesla was idolized by the Serbians in New York. A great many of them could claimto be distant relatives through either the Tesla or Mandich side of the family,and those who could not claim this distinction revered him none the less,despite the fact he never accepted invitations to take part in their social orother functions.One day an excited Serbian, a laborer, came to his apartment at theWaldorf-Astoria to beg his aid. He had gotten into a fight and pummeled a fellowSerbian, who had sworn out a warrant for his arrest. The visitor did not haveany money but wanted to go to Chicago to escape arrest. Would Tesla please lendhim the money for his railroad fare?“So you assaulted a man and now want to run away to escape punishment,” saidTesla. “You may run away from the law but you are not going to escapepunishment; you are going to get it right now!” Seizing a cane and grasping theman by the back of the neck, he ran him around the room, beating the dust out ofthe seat of his trousers until the man cried for mercy.“Do you think you can be a better man in Chicago and keep out of fights?” Teslaasked him. The man was sure he could. He received the money for his railroadfare and a few dollars more.So great was Tesla’s popularity in the nineties that many persons came to dinein the Palm Room at the Waldorf just to catch a glimpse of the famous inventor.He arranged to leave his office at six, but just before leaving he wouldtelephone the order for his dinner to the headwaiter, always insisting that noneless could serve him. The meal was required to be ready at eight o’clock. In themeantime he would go to his room and array himself in formal eveningattire—white tie and tails. He dined alone, except on the rare occasions when hewould give a dinner to a group to meet his social obligations.Money was always a nuisance detail to Tesla. For about fifteen years, following1888, he always had all he needed to meet his obligations; and he lived well.After about 1902 his financial road became quite rocky—but his fame was greaterthan ever, and likewise the need for maintaining his standard of living if hewas to recoup his fortune. He continued to stage frequent large dinners at theWaldorf to repay his social obligations, and had difficulty in accustominghimself to a money deficiency. On one occasion, when a large party was assembledin a private dining room, the headwaiter whispered to him that a most excellentdinner was prepared and ready to serve as he had ordered it, but that the creditdepartment insisted it could not be served until he paid for it in advance. “GetMr. Morgan on the telephone in the manager’s office and I will be down thereimmediately,” Tesla fumed. In a short time a more-than-adequate check wasdelivered to Tesla by a messenger. Many such occasions are reported to havearisen, but were always straightened out in the manager’s office, usuallywithout any outside intervention.The closest approach to home life which Tesla enjoyed came to him through RobertUnderwood Johnson, diplomat and poet, and one of the editors of the CenturyMagazine, whose home was in Madison Avenue in the fashionable Murray Hilldistrict. Tesla and Johnson were very close friends. A love of poetry was one ofthe several interests they had in common. Johnson wrote, and published in theCentury, in April, 1895, a short poem on his visit to Tesla’s laboratory. Thisled to a co-operative enterprise in which he paraphrased many pieces of Serbianpoetry from literal translations made by Tesla, who could recite many thousandsof lines of such material from memory. About forty pages of these translations,with an introductory note by Tesla, appeared in the next edition of Poems byJohnson.Persons famous in all fields of activity were frequent guests in the Johnsonhome, and formal dinners were constantly being held for brilliant assemblages ofpersonalities. Tesla was present as frequently as he could be induced to come,but he preferred to avoid all formal dinners as much as possible. He was,however, a very frequent informal visitor, arriving unexpected, and often atmost unusual hours. It was not uncommon for Tesla to arrive at the Johnson homeafter midnight, after the family had retired, and for “Bob” and “Nick” to sit upfor hours reveling in the exchange of a magnificent array of ideas. (Johnson and“Willie” K. Vanderbilt, were, as has been noted, the only individuals who ratedthe exchange of first names with Tesla.)Tesla’s visits to the Johnson home were always many hours long. He would arrivein a hansom cab, which he always required to wait for him to return to his hotelonly a few blocks distant. The Johnson children learned to take advantage ofthis, and when he arrived early in the evening they would get his permission touse the cab for a drive through Central Park while he chatted at home.Tesla enjoyed the opera and at one time attended the performances quitefrequently. William K. Vanderbilt’s box was always available to him, as likewisewere those of many other patrons of the Metropolitan. He occasionally attendedthe theatre. His favorite actress was Elsie Ferguson who, he declared, knew howto dress and was the most graceful woman he had ever seen on the stage. Hegradually dropped both the theatre and opera in favor of the movies, but was aninfrequent attendant even at those. He would not witness a tragedy but enjoyedcomedy and the lighter aspects of entertainment.One of his close friends was Rear Admiral Richmond Pearson Hobson, the SpanishAmerican War hero. In later years, Hobson was the only person who was able tocajole Tesla into breaking a long vigil at his intellectual pursuits for asession at the movies.Tesla did not subscribe to any religion. Early in life he severed his relationswith the Church and did not accept its doctrines. At his seventy-fifth birthdaydinner he declared that that which is called the soul is merely one of thefunctions of the body, and that when the activities of the body cease, the soulceases to exist.IT IS difficult for a man to appear as a hero to his secretary, but to MissDorothy F. Skerritt, who served Tesla in this capacity for many years until heclosed his office when he was seventy, he remained a saintly superman. Herdescription of Tesla, at this age, records him as possessing the same magneticpersonality that so impressed writers thirty years earlier. She wrote:As one approached Mr. Tesla he beheld a tall, gaunt man. He appeared to be analmost divine being. When about 70 he stood erect, his extremely thin bodyimmaculately and simply attired in clothing of a subdued coloring. Neither scarfpin nor ring adorned him. His bushy black hair was parted in the middle andbrushed back briskly from his high broad forehead, deeply lined by his closeconcentration on scientific problems that stimulated and fascinated him. Fromunder protruding eyebrows his deepset, steel gray, soft, yet piercing eyes,seemed to read your innermost thoughts. As he waxed enthusiastic about fields toconquer and achievements to attain his face glowed with almost etherealradiance, and his listeners were transported from the commonplaces of today toimaginative realms of the future. His genial smile and nobility of bearingalways denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in hissoul.Until the last, Tesla was meticulously careful about his clothes. He knew how todress well and did so. He declared to a secretary, in 1910, that he was thebest-dressed man on Fifth Avenue and intended to maintain that standard. Thiswas not because of personal vanity. Neatness and fastidiousness in clothes wereentirely in harmony with every other phase of his personality. He did notmaintain a large wardrobe and he wore no jewelry of any kind. Good clothesfitted in very nicely with his courtly bearing. He observed, however, that inthe matter of clothes the world takes a man at his. own valuation, as expressedin his appearance, and frequently eases his way to his objective through smallcourtesies not extended to less prepossessing individuals.He was partial to the waisted coat. No matter what he wore, however, it carriedan air of quiet elegance. The only type of hat he wore was the black derby. Hecarried a cane and wore, usually, gray suède gloves.Tesla paid $2.50 a pair for his gloves, wore them for a week and then discardedthem even though they still appeared as fresh as when they came from the maker.He standardized his style of ties and always wore the four-in-hand. The designmotive was of minor importance but the colors were limited to a combination ofred and black. He purchased a new tie every week, paying always one dollar.Silk shirts, plain white, were the only kind Tesla would wear. As with otherarticles of his clothing, such as pajamas, his initials were always embroideredon the left chest.Handkerchiefs he purchased in large numbers because he never sent them to thelaundry. After their first use they were discarded. He liked a good quality oflinen and purchased a standard package brand. His collars were never laundered,either. He never wore one more than once.Tesla always wore high-laced shoes, except on formal occasions. He required along narrow shoe and insisted on a last that had a neatly tapered square-toeeffect. His shoes were undoubtedly made to order, for the tops extended halfwayup his calf, a style that could not be purchased in merchant shoe stores. Histallness in all probability made this additional support at the anklesdesirable.The single use of articles, such as handkerchiefs and collars, extended tonapkins. Tesla had a germ phobia, and it acted like so much sand in the socialmachinery of his life. He required that the table he used in the dining room ofhis hotel be not used by others. A fresh table cloth was required for everymeal. He also required that a stack of two dozen napkins be placed on the leftside of the table. As each item of silverware and each dish was brought tohim—and he required that they be sterilized by heat before leaving thekitchen—he would pick each one up, interposing a napkin between his hand and theutensil, and use another napkin to clean it. He could then drop both napkins onthe floor. Even for a simple meal, he usually ran through the full stock ofnapkins. Flies were his pet abomination. A fly alighting on his table wasadequate cause for removing everything from the table and making an entirely newstart with the meal.Tesla was fortunate in that the headwaiter at the Waldorf-Astoria, during theperiod he was living there, Mr. Peterson, was afterward headwaiter at the HotelPennsylvania, where he later lived for several years. A story was in circulationto the effect that both at the Waldorf and at the Pennsylvania a special chefwas employed to prepare Tesla’s meals, but Mr. Peterson states that this storywas untrue.In his earlier years, for dinner, he greatly enjoyed fine thick steaks,preferably the filet mignon, and it was not unusual for him to consume two orthree at a sitting. Later his preference turned to lamb, and he would frequentlyorder a roast saddle of it. While the saddle was usually large enough to serve aparty of several persons, as a rule he ate of it only the central portion of thetenderloin. A crown of baby lamb chops was another favorite dish. He alsorelished roast squab with nut stuffing. In fowl, however, his choice was roastduck. He required that it be roasted under a smothering of celery stalks. Thismethod of preparing the duck was of his own devising. He very often made it thecentral motif around which a dinner was designed when entertaining friends, andon such occasions he would go to the kitchen to superintend its preparation.Duck so prepared was nevertheless delicious. Of the duck he ate only the meat oneither side of the breast bone.With the passing decades, Tesla shifted away from a meat diet. He substitutedfish, always boiled, and finally eliminated the meat entirely. He later almostentirely eliminated the fish and lived on a vegetarian diet. Milk was his mainstandby, and toward the end of his life it was the principal item of diet,served warm.As a youth he drank a great deal of coffee, and, while he gradually became awarethat he suffered unfavorable influences from it, he found it a difficult habitto break. When he finally made the decision to drink no more of it, he adheredto his good intentions but was forced to recognize the fact that the desire forit remained. He combated this by ordering with each meal a pot of his favoritecoffee, and having a cup of it poured so that he would get the aroma. Itrequired ten years for the aroma of the coffee to transform itself into anuisance so that he felt secure In no longer having it served. Tea and cocoa healso considered injurious.He was a heavy smoker in his youth, mostly of cigars. A sister who seemedfatally ill, when he was in his early twenties, said she would try to get betterif he would give up smoking. He did so immediately. His sister recovered, and henever smoked again.Tesla drank whiskey, for this he considered a very beneficial source of energyand an invaluable means for prolonging life. It was responsible, he believed,for the longevity enjoyed by many of his ancestors. It would enable him, hedeclared early in the century, to live to one hundred and fifty. Whenprohibition came along with the First World War, he denounced it as anintolerable interference with the rights of citizens. Nevertheless, he promptlygave up the use of whiskey and all other beverages except milk and water. Hedeclared, however, that the elimination of whiskey would reduce his expectationof life to one hundred and thirty years.Stimulants were not necessary to help him to think, Tesla said. A brisk walk hefound much better as an aid for concentration. He seemed to be in a dream whenwalking. Even one whom he knew very well he would pass at close range and notsee, though he might appear to be looking directly at him. His thoughts wereusually miles away from where he was. It was this practice, apparently, whichwas responsible for the accident, in 1937, when he was struck and severelyinjured by a taxicab. As a matter of fact, he had stated in an interview twoyears earlier that he would probably be killed by a truck or taxicab whilejaywalking.Tesla’s weight, stripped, was 142 pounds, and, except during brief periods ofillness, hardly varied a pound from 1888 to about 1926, when he intentionallyreduced his weight five pounds.One of Tesla’s indulgences, over many years, was scalp massages. He would visita barbershop three times a week and have the barber rub his scalp for half anhour. He was insistent upon the barber placing a clean towel on his chair but,strangely enough, he did not object to the use of the shaving mug and brush.Tesla always claimed that he never slept more than two hours a night. Hisretiring time, he said, was five A.M., and he would arise at ten A.M. afterspending only two hours in sleep, three hours being too much. Once a year, headmitted, he would sleep for five hours—and that would result in building up atremendous reserve of energy. He never stopped working, he claimed, even whenasleep. Tesla laughed at Edison’s claim that he slept only four hours a night.It was a regular practice with Edison, he said, to sit down in his laboratoryand doze off into a three-hour nap about twice a day. It is possible that Tesla,too, obtained some sleep in a similar fashion, perhaps without being consciousof the fact. Hotel employees have related that it was quite common to see Teslastanding transfixed in his room for hours at a time, so oblivious to hissurroundings that they were able to work around his room without his being,apparently, aware of their presence.Tesla. always provided his office with a separate washroom which no one buthimself was permitted to use. He would wash his hands on the slightest pretext.When he did so, he required that his secretary hand him a freshly launderedtowel each time to dry them.He went to extremes to avoid shaking hands. He usually placed his hands behindhis back when anyone approached who he feared might make an effort to shakehands, and this frequently led to embarrassing moments. If by chance a visitorto his office should catch him off guard and shake his hand, Tesla was so upsetthat he would be unable to pay attention to the visitor’s mission and frequentlywould dismiss him before it was completely stated; and immediately he would rushto the washroom and scour his hands. Workmen eating their lunch with dirty handsalmost nauseated him.Pearls, too, were one of Tesla’s phobias. If a woman guest at a dinner party towhich he was invited wore pearls, he was unable to eat. Smooth round surfaces,in general, were an abomination to him; it had even taken him a long time tolearn to tolerate billiard balls.Tesla never knew the experience of having a headache. In spite of a number ofcases of serious illness, in his independent years he was never attended by adoctor.There were reasons for practically all of Tesla’s phobias, not all of themgenerally known. His germ phobia can be traced back to his two serious illnessesearly in life, both of which were probably cholera, a disease constantlyprevalent in his native land, caused by a germ transmitted by impure drinkingwater and by contact between individuals.Tesla was not oblivious of his idiosyncrasies; he was quite aware of them and ofthe friction which they caused in his daily life. They were an essential part ofhim, however, and he could no more have dispensed with them than he could hisright arm. They were probably one of the consequences of his solitary mode oflife or, possibly, a contributing cause of it.NINETEENimage [images/00003.jpg] TESLA’S mind always seemed to be under an explosive pressure. An avalanche ofideas was forever straining for release. He seemed to be unable to keep up withthe flood of his own thoughts. He never had sufficient facilities to keep hisaccomplishments equal to his projects. If he had an army of adequately trainedassistants, he would still be insufficiently equipped. As a result, thoseassociated with him always experienced a sense of “drive”; yet he was a mostgenerous employer both in the matter of wages paid and the number of hours ofwork required. He frequently demanded overtime work but always paid generouslyfor it.Nevertheless, Tesla was not an easy man to work for. He was most meticulouslyneat in his personal affairs and required all workers to be the same. He was anexcellent mechanic and set extremely high standards, by his own accomplishments,for all work done in his shops. He greatly admired cleverness in his assistants,frequently rewarding them with extra compensation for difficult jobs well done,but was extremely impatient with stupidity and carelessness.Although Tesla maintained a staff of draughtsmen, he never used them in his owndesign work on machines, and tolerated them only because of unavoidable contactswith other organizations. When having machines constructed for his own use, hewould give individual instruction on each part. The workman scheduled to do themachinework would be summoned to Tesla’s desk, where the inventor would make analmost microscopically small sketch in the middle of a large sheet of paper. Nomatter how detailed the piece of work, or its size, the sketch was always lessthan one inch in its largest dimensions. If Tesla made the slightest slip of thepencil in drawing the sketch, he would not make an erasure but would start overon another sheet of paper. All dimensions were given verbally. When the drawingwas finished, the workman was not permitted to take it with him to the shop toguide him in his work. Tesla would destroy the drawing and require the machinistto work from memory. Tesla depended entirely on his memory for all details, henever reduced his mentally completed plans to paper for guidance inconstruction—and he believed others could achieve this ability if they wouldmake sufficient effort. So he sought to force them to try by insisting on theirworking without drawings.All those who worked with Tesla greatly admired him for his remarkable abilityto keep track of a vast number of finest details concerning every phase of themany projects he had under way simultaneously. No employee was ever given anymore information than was absolutely essential for completing a project. No onewas ever told the purposes for which a machine or article was to be used. Teslaclaimed that Edison received more ideas from his associates than he contributed,so he himself bent over backward to avoid this situation. He felt that he wasthe richest man in the world in the matter of ideas and needed none from anyoneelse; and he intended to prevent all from contributing any.Tesla was probably very unfair to Edison in this respect. The two men wereentirely different and distinct types. Tesla was totally lacking in theuniversity type of mind; that is, the mind which is adapted to co-operate withothers in acquiring knowledge and conducting research. He could neither give norreceive, but was entirely adequate to his own requirements. Edison had more ofthe co-operative, or executive, type of mind. He was able to attract brilliantassociates and to delegate to them major portions of his inventive researchprojects. He had the ability to act as a catalyzer, to stimulate them tocreative mental activities, and thus multiply his own creative abilities. IfTesla had possessed this ability, his record of accomplishment would have beentremendously magnified.The inability to work with others, the inability to share his plans, was thegreatest handicap from which Tesla suffered. It completely isolated him from therest of the intellectual structure of his time and caused the world to lose avast amount of creative thought which he was unable to translate into completeinventions. It is a duty of a master to train pupils who will carry on afterhim—but Tesla refused to accept this responsibility. Had Tesla, in his mostactive period, associated with him a half-dozen brilliant young scientists, theywould have been in a position to link him with the engineering and scientificworlds from which, despite his eminence and his outstanding accomplishments, hewas to a great extent isolated because of his unusual personal characteristics.His fame was so secure that the success of his assistants could not havedetracted from it; but the master would have shone more brightly in thebrilliant accomplishments of his pupils. He might well have attracted somepractical young men who could have aided him by assuming the burden of makingpractical application of some of the minor but important inventions from whichhe could have earned sufficient profit to pay the cost of maintaining hislaboratories. Many scores of important inventions have undoubtedly been lost tothe world because of Tesla’s intellectual hermit characteristics. Undoubtedly,he indirectly inspired many young men to become inventors.Tesla responded powerfully to personal idiosyncrasies in individuals with whomhe worked. When his reaction was unfavorable, he was unable to tolerate thepresence of the person within eyeshot. When carrying on his experimental work atthe Allis Chalmers plant in Milwaukee, for example, he did not increase hispopularity by insisting that certain workers be dropped from the crew working onthe turbine because he did not like their looks. Since, as noted earlier, he hadalready antagonized the engineers in that plant by going over their heads to thepresident and board of directors, the turbine job went forward in something lessthan a co-operative atmosphere.Tesla was thoroughly impractical throughout, too, in handling money matters.When he was working on the Union Sulphur Company turbine project, a ship wasmade available for his use, free, during the day; but if he worked after sixP.M. it would cost him $20 per hour. He never showed up at the ship until sixo’clock. Every night, in addition, he had to hand out $10 for suppers for thecrew. In the course of a year these costs totaled about $12,000, which must havecut heavily into the retainer he received. Nor were these his only additionalexpenses. Almost every night he handed a $5 tip to his principal assistantsamong the crew, and once a week to all members of the crew. These manifestationsof generosity were not, of course, a total loss to Tesla; they might rather beclassed as necessities, for he was very dictatorial in directing his assistants.Inquiries among the employees at hotels where he lived revealed that he had areputation for acting in a most cavalier manner toward the servants. He wasalmost cruel in the manner in which he ordered them around, but would makeimmediate compensation by the generous tips he bestowed.He was always, however, very considerate of women, and even men, on his officestaff. If any one of them did an unusually fine piece of work, everyone on thestaff was informed of it. Criticism was always delivered privately to theindividual involved.Tesla had a standing rule that every messenger boy who came to his office was toreceive a tip of twenty-five cents, and he set aside a fund of $10 a week forthis purpose.If necessity required that he keep his staff of young women secretaries andtypists working overtime for several hours, he would provide them with a dinnerat Delmonico’s. He would hire a cab for the girls and would follow them inanother cab. After making arrangements to pay the bill, and paying the tip inadvance, he would leave.Tesla timed his arrival at the office so that he entered at the stroke of noon.He required that his secretary should be standing immediately inside the door toreceive him and take his hat, cane and gloves. His offices were opened by nineo’clock each morning, so all routine matters would be handled before hisarrival. Before Tesla arrived, all the shades in the office had to be drawn sothat no outdoor light was admitted and night conditions were simulated. Theinventor, as-remarked, was a “sun dodger.” He appeared to be at his best atnight and at some kind of disadvantage in daylight; at any rate, he preferredthe night for work and what he called his recreation.The only time Tesla would permit the shades of his office to be raised was whena lightning storm was raging. The various offices he leased faced on openspaces. The 8 West 40th Street office was on the south side of Bryant Park, inthe east end of which was the low-roofed structure that housed the New YorkPublic Library. From his windows on the twentieth floor, he could look beyondthe city roof scape below him and obtain a broad view of the sky.When the rumbles of distant thunder announced that the fireworks of the skywould presently be flashing, it was not only permissible to raise the shades—itwas obligatory. Tesla loved to watch lightning flash. The black mohair couchwould be drawn close to the windows so that he could lie on it, completelyrelaxed, while his vision commanded a full view of the northern or the westernsky. He was always talking to himself, but during a lightning storm he wouldbecome eloquent. His conversation on such occasions was never recorded. Hewished to be a lone observer of this gorgeous spectacle, and his secretarieswere quite willing that he should be so accommodated. By finger measurements andcounting seconds he was able to calculate the distance, length and voltage ofeach flash.How thrilled Tesla must have been by these tremendous sparks, many times longerthan he had been able to produce in his Colorado Springs laboratory! He hadsuccessfully imitated Nature’s electrical fireworks, but he had not as yetexceeded her performance.The ancient Romans sublimated their frustrations by the forces of Nature bycreating the mental concept of their mightiest god, Jupiter, as one endowed withthe power of creating lightning and hurling his bolts at earth. Tesla hadrefused to accept frustration; but, like the ancient Romans, he too set up amental concept, a superman not inferior to the Romans’ ruling god, who wouldcontrol the forces of Nature. Yes, Tesla thoroughly enjoyed a lightning storm.From his mohair couch, he used to applaud the lightning; he approved of it. Hemay even have been a little bit jealous.TESLA never married; no woman, with the exception of his mother and his sisters,ever shared the smallest fraction of his life. He idolized his mother andadmired his sisters for their intellectual accomplishments. One of his sisters,Marica, exhibited unusual ability as a mathematician and had greater abilitythan his own for memorizing long passages from books. He attributed to hismother most of his abilities as an inventor, and he continuously spoke in praiseof her ability to contrive useful gadgets for the household, often regrettingthat she had not been born into an environment in which she would have been ableto manifest to a larger world her many creative talents. He was not unaware ofthe values which a woman could bring into a man’s life, for he had ever beforehim the vast contributions which his mother made to his father’s welfare andhappiness. However, he lived instead a blueprint life, one which he had plannedin his early youth, one designed along engineering lines, with all of the timeand energies available to be directed to invention and none to be dissipated onemotional projects.From the romantic point of view, Tesla as a young man was not unattractive. Hewas too tall and slender to pose as the physical Adonis, but his otherqualifications more than compensated for this possible defect. He was handsomeof face had a magnetic personality, but was quiet, almost shy; he was softspoken, well educated and wore clothes well in spite of inadequate funds withwhich to keep up a wardrobe. However, he avoided romantic encounters, or anysituations that would lead up to them, just as assiduously as other young mensought them. He would not permit his thoughts to wander into romantic channels,and with thoughts successfully controlled, action control became a problem ofvanishing magnitude. He did not develop an antagonism to women; he solved theproblem, instead, by idealizing them.A typical instance of how he avoided romance is furnished by an incident thatoccurred in Paris when he returned to that city to give a lecture on hisalternating-current system after he had become world famous. His wonderfuldiscoveries were the principal topic of conversation of the day, and he was thecynosure of all eyes wherever he went. The situation was entirely pleasant toTesla. Less than ten years before, the executives the Continental EdisonCompany, in that city, had not alone rejected the alternating-current system hehad offered them but had cheated him of his just earnings. Now he was returningto that city after receiving recognition and wealth in the United States andfame throughout the world. He was in Paris as a returned hero and the world wasat his feet.As he sat in an outdoor café with a young male friend, amidst a chattering,fashionably dressed crowd, a graceful, gorgeously gowned young woman, with astylishly coiffured crown of red hair, whom he instantly recognized as SarahBernhardt, the famous French actress—the “divine Sarah”—swung close to his tableand when a few feet away very auspiciously dropped a tiny lace handkerchief.Tesla was on his feet in an instant. He recovered the handkerchief, and with hishat in his other hand, bowing low from the waist, he handed the wisp of lace tothe beautiful tragedienne, saying: “Madamoiselle, your handkerchief.” Withouteven an upward glance at her graciously smiling face, he returned to his chairand resumed his conversation about his experiments on a world wireless system ofpower transmission.When a newspaper reporter once asked Tesla why he had not married, his reply, ascontained in the published interview was:I have planned to devote my whole life to my work and for that reason I amdenied the love and companionship of a good woman; and more, too.I believe that a writer or a musician should marry. They gain inspiration thatleads to finer achievement.But an inventor has so intense a nature, with so much in it of wild, passionatequality that, in giving himself to a woman, he would give up everything, and sotake everything from his chosen field, It is a pity, too; sometimes we feel solonely.In my student days I have known what it was to pass forty-eight hours at astretch at a gaming table, undergoing intense emotion, that which most peoplebelieve is the strongest that can be known, but it is tame and insipid comparedwith that sublime moment when you see the labor of weeks fructify in asuccessful experiment that proves your theories….“Many times has Nikola Tesla known that supreme happiness,” said theinterviewer, “and he is likely to know it often again. It is impossible that hislife work can be finished at forty. It would seem that his powers are onlyreaching their maturity.”Tesla was not unappreciative of the activities of the many women who showed asincere interest in his welfare, and who tried to make life tolerable andpleasant for an obviously none-too-well-adjusted scientist projected into asocial world from which he would have been only too willing to escape. He spokeglowingly of the first Mrs. Clarence Mackay (née Duer), Mrs. Jordan L. Mott, andof the beauty of Lady Ribblesdale (the former Mrs. John Jacob Astor). He admiredthe energetic idealism of Miss Anne Morgan; but never was the situationbrightened by a single tint of romance.He was impressed by the tall, graceful and charming Miss Marguerite Merington, atalented pianist and writer on musical subjects, who was a frequent dinner guestat the Johnson home.“Why do you not wear diamonds and jewelry like other women?” Teslaundiplomatically asked Miss Merington, one evening.“It is not a matter of choice with me,” she replied, “but if I had enough moneyto load myself with diamonds I could think of better ways of spending it.”“What would you do with money if you had it?” the inventor continued.“I would prefer to purchase a home in the country, except that I would not enjoycommuting to the suburbs,” Miss Merington replied.“Ah! Miss Merington, when I start getting my millions I will solve that problem.I will buy a square block here in New York and build a villa for you in thecenter and plant trees all around it. Then you will have your country home andwill not have to leave the city.”Tesla was most generous in the distribution of his always still-to-be-gottenmillions; none of his friends would ever have lacked anything they desired if hehad had sufficient funds with which to satisfy their wishes. His promises,however, were always to be fulfilled—“When I start getting my millions. ”Tesla had, as might be expected, very definite ideas about how women shoulddress. He also had clear-cut ideas about the feminine figure. He disliked thebig “hefty” type and utterly detested fat women. The super-upholstered type,flashily dressed and heavily jeweled, that wasted time in hotel lobbies, werehis pet abomination. He liked women trim, slim, graceful and agile.One of his secretaries, well proportioned and a graceful blonde, wore to theoffice one day a dress that was in the very latest style. It was a summer dressmade from a pretty print. The prevailing style called for an extremely low waistline, well down on the hips, several inches below its natural location. Thisgave a relatively short skirt and from the neck to the hips the dress was almosta plain cylinder. The style was very new, and was enjoying an intense but briefwave of popularity. The secretary was an excellent seamstress and had made thedress herself, an accomplishment of which she was justly proud.Tesla summoned the secretary. She breezed into his sanctum not expecting, buthoping, that he would say something nice about her new dress.“Miss,” he said, “what is that you are wearing? You cannot wear that on thiserrand on which I wish you to go. I wished to have you take a note to a veryimportant banker down town, and what would he think if someone from my officeshould come to him wearing such a monstrosity of a gown? How can you be such aslave to fashion? Whatever the fashion designers say is the style you buy andwear. Miss, you have good sense and good taste, so why did you let the salesladyin the store force a dress like this on you? Now if you were also very cleverlike my sister who makes all her own dresses you would not be forced to wear anysuch abominable style as this, then you too could make your own clothes and youcould wear sensible gowns. You should always follow nature in the design of yourclothes. Do not let a style designer deform nature for you, for then you becomehideous instead of attractive. Now, Miss, you get into a cab, so not many peoplewill see you, and go to your home and get into a sensible dress and return assoon as you can so you can take this letter down town for me.”Tesla never addressed any of his woman employees by either their Christian namesor surnames. The only form of address he used to them was “Miss.” As he spokeit, it sounded like “Meese,” and he could make it very expressive. When headdressed the secretary wearing the gown of which he disapproved, it soundedlike “Meeeeeeesssse.” It could also be an abrupt, abbreviated expletive.When a young woman on his office staff left his employ to get married, Teslapreached this sermonette to the remaining members:“Do not marry too young. When you marry too young, men marry you mostly for yourbeauty and ten years later when your beauty is gone, they tire of you and becomeinterested in someone else.”Tesla’s attitude toward woman was paradoxical; he idealized woman—put her up ona pedestal—and yet he also viewed women in a purely objective and materialisticway, as if no spiritual concepts were involved in their make-up. This wasundoubtedly an outward expression of the conflict that was taking place withinhis own life, between the normal healthy attitude toward female companionship,and the coldly objective planning of his life under which he refused to sharethe smallest fraction of his life with any woman.Only the finest type of women could approach within friendship distance ofTesla, and such individuals were idealized by him without the least difficulty;he could desex them mentally so that the vector or emotional attraction waseliminated. To the remainder he did not bother to apply this process. They hadno attraction for him.Out of the welter of human affairs, however, he visioned the rising of asuperior breed of human beings, few in number but of vastly elevatedintellectual status, while the remainder of the race leveled itself on a merelyproductive and reproductive plane, which, however, could represent aconsiderable improvement over existing conditions. He sought to fashion anidealism out of purely materialistic concepts of human nature. This was ahold-over from the materialistic, agnostic views which were fashionable andprevalent among scientists in the formative period of his youth. This phase ofhis attitude was not particularly hard to break down in his latter years; butthe phase which represented an engineering approach to the solution of problemsof the human race was more firmly held, although he was willing to admit thatspiritual factors had a real existence and should be considered in suchplanning.His views concerning women received their only expression in published form inthe article written for Collier’s, in 1924, by John B. Kennedy, from aninterview with Tesla. On this occasion, he said:The struggle of the human female toward sex equality will end up in a new sexorder, with the females superior. The modern woman, who anticipates in merelysuperficial phenomenon the advancement of her sex, is but a surface symptom ofsomething deeper and more potent fomenting in the bosom of the race.It is not in the shallow physical imitation of the men that women will assertfirst their equality and later their superiority, but in the awakening of theintellect of women.But the female mind has demonstrated a capacity for all the mental acquirementsand achievements of men, and as generations ensue that capacity will beexpanded; the average woman will be as well educated as the average man, andthen better educated, for the dormant faculties of her brain will be stimulatedinto an activity that will be all the more intense because of centuries ofrepose. Women will ignore precedent and startle civilization with theirprogress.The acquisition of new fields of endeavor by women, their gradual usurpation ofleadership, will dull and finally dissipate feminine sensibilities, will chokethe maternal instinct so that marriage and motherhood may become abhorrent andhuman civilization draw closer and closer to the perfect civilization of thebee.The significance of this lies in the principle dominating the economy of thebee—the most highly organized and intelligently co-ordinated system of any formof non-rational animal life—the all governing supremacy of the instinct forimmortality which makes divinity out of motherhood.The center of all bee life is the queen. She dominates the hive, not throughhereditary right, for any egg may be hatched into a reigning queen, but becauseshe is the womb of the insect race.There are vast desexualized armies of workers whose sole aim and business inlife is hard work. It is the perfection of communism, of socialized,co-operative life wherein all things, including the young, are the commonproperty of all.Then there are the virgin bees, the princess bees, the females which areselected from the eggs of the queen when they are hatched and preserved in casean unfruitful queen should bring disappointment to the hive. And there are themale bees, few in number, unclean in habit, tolerated only because they arenecessary to mate with the queen….The queen returns to the hive, impregnated, carrying with her tens of thousandsof eggs—a future city of bees, and then begins the cycle of reproduction, theconcentration of the teeming life of the hive in unceasing work for the birth ofthe new generation.Imagination falters at the prospect of a human analogy to this mysterious andsuperbly dedicated civilization of the bee; but when we consider how the humaninstinct for race perpetuation dominates life in all its normal and exaggeratedand perverse manifestations, there is ironic justice in the possibility thatthis instinct, with the intellectual advance of women, may be finally expressedafter the manner of the bee, though it will take centuries to break down thehabits and customs of peoples that bar the way to such a simply andscientifically ordered civilization.If Tesla had been even half as well informed in the biological sciences as hewas in the physical sciences, he probably would not have seen a possiblesolution of human problems in the social structure adapted to the limitations ofan insect species which can never hope to utilize tools, and draw upon naturalforces vastly exceeding their own energy sources, to work out their destiny. Andmore important is the fact that the bees can never hope to use advancedintellectual powers to improve their biological status, as can the human race.With a better knowledge of biological sciences he might have discovered that thephysiological processes that control perpetuation of the individual areindissolubly linked to the processes that control the perpetuation of the race,and that by utilizing as much biological knowledge and spiritual insight, indesigning a superman, as he utilized materialistic engineering principles, hemight have designed himself as a more complete and potent superman, betteradjusted to merging his intellectual creations into the current life of the racethrough a better understanding of human affairs.Tesla tried to convince the world that he had succeeded in eliminating love andromance from his life; but he did not succeed. That failure (or perhaps fromanother aspect it was a success), is the story of the secret chapter of Tesla’slife.TWENTYimage [images/00003.jpg] THE most obvious outward characteristic of Tesla’s life was his proclivity forfeeding pigeons in public places. His friends knew he did it but never knew why.To the pedestrians on Fifth Avenue he was a familiar figure on the plazas of thePublic Library at 42nd Street and St. Patrick’s Cathedral at 50th Street. Whenhe appeared and sounded a low whistle, the blue and brown-and white-featheredflocks would appear from all directions, carpet the walks in front of him andeven perch upon him while he scattered bird seed or permitted them to feed fromhis hand.During the last three decades of his life, it is probable that not one out oftens of thousands who saw him knew who he was. His fame had died down and thegeneration that knew him well had passed on. Even when the newspapers, once ayear, would break out in headlines about Tesla and his latest predictionsconcerning scientific wonders to come, no one associated that name with theexcessively tall, very lean man, wearing clothes of a bygone era, who almostdaily appeared to feed his feathered friends. He was just one of the strangeindividuals of whom it takes a great many of varying types to make up a completepopulation of a great metropolis.When he started the practice, and no one knows just when that was, he was alwaysdressed in the height of fashion and some of the world’s most famous figurescould frequently be seen in his company and joining him in scattering the birdseed, but there came a time when he paid less attention to his clothes, andthose he wore became more and more old fashioned.Fifth Avenue after midnight is a far different thoroughfare than the busy arteryof human and vehicular traffic it is during the day. It is deserted. One canwalk for blocks and meet no one except a policeman. On several occasions theauthor, by chance, met Tesla on an after-midnight walk up Fifth Avenue, goingtoward the library. Usually Tesla was quite willing to have one walk with himand chat upon a street encounter during the day, but on these after-midnightoccasions he was definite about his desire to be left alone. “You will leave menow,” he would say, bringing an abrupt end to a conversation hardly begun. Thenatural assumption was that Tesla was engaged on a definite line of thought anddid not wish his mind to be diverted from its concentration on some knottyscientific problem. How far this was from the truth! And, as I learned muchlater, what a sacred significance these midnight pilgrimages to feed thepigeons—which would come to his call, even from their nocturnal roosts—had forhim!It was hard for almost everyone to understand why Tesla, engaged in momentousscientific developments, working twice as many hours as the average individual,could see his way clear to spend time scattering bird seed. The Herald. Tribune,in an editorial, once stated: “He would leave his experiments for a time andfeed the silly and inconsequential pigeons in Herald Square.”It was a routine procedure in Tesla’s office, however, for one of hissecretaries to go down town on a given day each week and purchase three poundseach of rape, hemp and canary seed. This was mixed in his office, and each dayhe took a small paper bag filled with the seed and started on his rounds.If, on any day, he was unable to make his pigeon-feeding rounds, he would call aWestern Union messenger boy, pay him his fee, plus a dollar tip, and send him tofeed the birds.In addition to feeding the birds in the streets, Tesla took care of pigeons inhis rooms in the various hotels in which he made his home. He usually had basketnests for from one to four pigeons in his room and kept a cask of seed on handto feed them. The window to the room in which he kept these nests was neverclosed.Tesla became quite ill in his 40th Street office, one day in 1921. He was unableto work and lay upon his couch. As the symptoms became more alarming and therewas a possibility that he might not be able to return to his room in the HotelSt. Regis, he summoned his secretary to give her an “important” message. As hespoke the important message, he required the secretary to repeat each phraseafter him to make sure that no errors would be made. This required repetitionwas a usual procedure with him; but in this case he was so ill, practicallyprostrate, that he seemed hardly to have energy enough to speak the message asingle time.“Miss,” he whispered, “Call Hotel St. Regis—”“Yes sir,” she responded, “Call Hotel St. Regis—”“Get the housekeeper on the fourteenth floor—”“Get the housekeeper on the fourteenth floor—”“Tell her to go to Mr. Tesla’s room—”“Tell her to go to Mr. Tesla’s room—”“And feed the pigeon today—”“And feed the pigeon today—”“The white female with touches of light gray in its wings—”“The white female with touches of light gray in its wings—”“And to continue doing this—”“And to continue doing this—”“Until she receives further orders from me—”“Until she receives further orders from me—”“There is plenty of feed in Mr. Tesla’s room.”“There is plenty of feed in Mr. Tesla’s room.”“Miss,” he pleaded, “this is very important. Will you repeat the whole messageto me so I can be sure you have it correct.”“Call Hotel St. Regis; get the housekeeper on the fourteenth floor. Tell her togo to Mr. Tesla’s room and feed the pigeon today, the white female with touchesof light gray on its wings, and continue doing this until she receives furtherorders from me. There is plenty of feed in Mr. Tesla’s room.”“Ah, yes,” said Tesla, his eyes brightening as he spoke, “the white one withtouches of light gray in its wings. And if I am not here tomorrow, you willrepeat that message then and every day until you get my further orders. Do itnow, Miss—it is very important.”Tesla’s orders, were always carried out to the letter and this one particularly,since he had placed such unusual emphasis on it. His secretary and the membersof his staff felt that his illness must be more serious than it seemed to be,since at a time when he had a great many very serious problems on his hands andhe appeared to be on the verge of a siege of illness, the more pressingsituations were completely forgotten and his only thought was of a pigeon. Hemust be delirious, so they thought.Some months later Tesla failed one day to show up at his office, and when hissecretary telephoned to his hotel, the inventor informed her that he was allright, but that his pigeon was ill and he dared not leave the room for fear shewould need him. He remained in his room for several days.About a year later Tesla came to his office earlier than usual one day, andapparently very much disturbed. He carried a small bundle in a tender manner onhis bent arm. He telephoned to Julius Czito, a machinist on whom he frequentlydepended to perform unusual tasks, and asked him to come to the office. Czitolived in the suburbs. He told him briefly that the bundle contained a pigeonthat had died in his room at the hotel, and that he desired to have it properlyburied on Czito’s property where the grave could be cared for. Czito, inrelating the incident years afterward, said he was tempted, on leaving theoffice, to drop the package in the first garbage can he found; but somethingcaused him to desist and he took it to his home. Before he could perform theburial, Tesla telephoned to his home and asked him to return the package thenext morning. How Tesla disposed of it is not known.In 1924 Tesla’s financial condition fell to a very low level. He was completelybroke. He was unable to pay his rent and there were some judgments against himfor other unpaid bills. A deputy sheriff appeared at his office one afternoon toseize everything in the office to satisfy a judgment. Tesla managed to talk thesheriff into delaying seizure. When the official had gone he took stock of hissituation. He had not paid his secretaries’wages for two weeks and he now owedthem for another fraction of a week. He was entirely without funds in the bank.A search of his safe disclosed that the only object of negotiable value was theheavy gold Edison Medal presented to him by the American Institute of ElectricalEngineers in 1917.“Miss, and Miss,” he said, addressing the secretaries. “This medal containsabout one hundred dollars’ worth of gold. I will have it cut in half and giveeach of you one-half, or one of you can take all of it and I will later pay theother.”The two young women, Miss Dorothy F. Skerritt and Miss Muriel Arbus, refused topermit him either to damage or part with the medal, and offered instead to aidhim with the meager amounts of cash they had in their purses, which offer herefused with thanks. (A few weeks later the girls received their back salaries,at $35 per week, and an additional two weeks’salary.)A search of the cash drawer revealed a little over $5. 00—all the money hepossessed.“Ah! Miss,” he said, “that will be enough to buy the bird seed. I am all out ofseed, so will you go down town in the morning and purchase some and deliver itto my hotel.”Again calling his trusted aide, Czito (whom he was forced to leave unpaid to theextent of $1, 100), he put up to him the problem of vacating the officeimmediately. Within a few hours the entire contents of the offices were storedin a near-by office building.A short time later he was forced to leave his apartment in the Hotel St. Regis.His bill had been unpaid for some time, but the immediate cause was associatedwith pigeons. He had been spending more time in his hotel room, which alsobecame his office, and devoted more time to feeding pigeons. Great flocks ofthem would come to his windows and into the rooms, and their dirt on the outsideof the building became a problem to the management and on the inside to themaids. He sought to solve the problem by putting the birds in a hamper andhaving George Scherff take them to his Westchester home. Three weeks later, whenfirst given their freedom, they returned, one making the trip in half an hour.Tesla was given his choice of ceasing to feed the pigeons or leaving the hotel.He left.He next made his home at the Hotel Pennsylvania. He remained there a few yearsand the same situation, both as to bills and pigeons, developed. He moved to theHotel Governor Clinton—and in about a year went through the same experience. Henext moved to the Hotel New Yorker, in 1933, where he spent the final ten yearsof his life.After midnight one night in the fall of 1937, Tesla started out from the HotelNew” Yorker to make his regular pilgrimage to the Cathedral and the Library tofeed the pigeons. In crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel anaccident happened, how is unknown. In spite of his agility, he was unable toavoid contact with a moving taxicab, and was thrown heavily to the ground. Heraised no question as to who was at fault, refused medical aid, and asked merelyto be taken to his hotel in another cab.Arriving at the hotel, he went to bed and had scarcely got under the covers whenhe telephoned for his favorite messenger boy, Kerrigan, from a near-by WesternUnion office, gave him the package of bird seed and directed him to complete thetask which he had started and the accident interrupted.The next day, when it was apparent that he would be unable to take his usualdaily walks for some time to come, he hired the messenger for six months to feedthe pigeons every day. Tesla’s back had been severely wrenched in the accident,and three ribs broken, but the full extent of his injuries will never be knownfor, in keeping with his almost lifelong custom, he refused to consult a doctor.Pneumonia developed but for this he also refused medical aid. He was bedriddenfor some months, and was unable to carry on his practice of feeding pigeons fromhis window; and soon they failed to come.In the spring of 1938 he was able to get up. He at once resumed hispigeon-feeding walks on a much more limited scale, but frequently had amessenger act for him.This devotion to his pigeon-feeding task seemed to everyone who knew him likenothing more than the hobby of an eccentric scientist, but if they could havelooked into Tesla’s heart, or read his mind, they would have discovered thatthey were witnessing the world’s most fantastic, yet tender and pathetic loveaffair.TESLA, as a self-made superman, suffered from the limitations of his maker.Endowed with an intelligence above the average in both quality and quantity, andwith some supernormal faculties, he was able to erect a superman higher instature than himself; but the greater height was attained by sacrificing otherdimensions, and in this diminution of breadth and thickness existed adeficiency.When he was a youth and his mind was in its most plastic and formative stage, headopted, as we have seen, the then prevalent agnostic and materialistic view oflife. Today science has emancipated itself from slavery to either anantagonistic mysticism or materialism, and is willing to consider both asharmonious parts of a comprehensive approach to the understanding of Nature, butis conscious, that it has not yet learned how to manipulate or control the moreintangible factors upon which the mystics have builded their structures ofknowledge. Vast realms of human experience have been rejected in all ages byscientists, of whatever name, who failed to fit them in logical arrangement intheir inadequate and too simplified natural philosophies. By rejecting thephenomena that lay beyond their intellectual abilities, the scientists andphilosophers did not eliminate them nor prevent their manifestations. Thephenomena so rejected, however, were given an academic home by the ecclesiasts,who accepted them without understanding, or hope of understanding, and thusincarcerated them in the foundation of the religious mysteries where they serveda useful purpose, for upon an unknown it is possible to build a greater unknown.The mystical experiences of the saints, of whatever faith, are demonstrations offorces which are natural functions of the phenomenon of life, expressed invarying degree in step with the expanding unfoldment of the individual toward anadvanced state of evolution.Tesla was an individual in an advanced state of development, and there came tohim experiences which he refused to accept as experiments; accepting thebenefits which came to him but rejecting the vehicle which transported them.This was true, far example, in the case of the burst of revelation which came tohim—revealing scores of tremendously valuable inventions—while he strolled inthe park at Budapest, and which differed only in degree and type, but not infundamental nature, from the blinding light which came to Saul on the road toDamascus, and to others to whom illumination has come by similar processes.His materialistic concepts made him intellectually blind to the strangephenomenon by which revelation, or illumination, had come to him, but made himmore keenly appreciative of the value of that which was revealed. It must not beunderstood that this revelation was a happenstance phenomenon of the moment, forTesla, endowed by Nature with an intellect capable of vast unfoldment, hadexerted almost superhuman efforts to achieve that which was revealed to him, andthe effort was not unassociated with the result.In a contrary direction, Tesla suppressed a tremendously large or importantrealm of his life by the planned elimination of love and romance from histhoughts and experience. Just as his efforts to discover the physical secrets ofNature built up forces that penetrated to the plane of revelation, so did hisequally tremendous effort to suppress love and romance build up forces, beyondhis control, that were operating to express themselves. There was a parallelsituation in his philosophy of natural phenomena, in that he suppressed allspiritual aspects of Nature and confined himself to the purely materialisticaspects.Two forces, one of love and romance in his personal nature, and the other thespiritual aspects of Nature in his philosophy, as applied to his work, wereincarcerated in a limbo of his personality, seeking an outlet into the paradiseof expression and manifestation. And they obtained that outlet, expressing theirnature by the form of the manifestation; but Tesla failed to recognize them.Tesla, rejecting the love of woman and thinking that he had engineered acomplete elimination of the problem of love, failed to excise from his naturethe capacity to love, and when this capacity expressed itself, it did so bydirecting its energies through a channel he left unguarded in planning theself-made superman.The manifestation of these united forces of love and spirituality resulted in afantastic situation, probably without parallel in human annals. Tesla told methe story; but if I did not have a witness who assured me that he heard exactlywhat I heard, I would have convinced myself that I had had nothing more tangiblethan a dream experience. It was the love story of Tesla’s life. In the story ofhis strange romance, I saw instantly the reason for those unremitting dailyjourneys to feed the pigeons, and those midnight pilgrimages when he wished tobe alone. I recalled those occasions when I had happened to meet him on desertedFifth Avenue and, when I spoke to him, he replied, “You will now leave me.” Hetold his story simply, briefly and without embellishments, but there was still asurging of emotion in his voice.“I have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them, for years; thousands of them,for who can tell—“But there was one pigeon, a beautiful bird, pure white with light gray tips onits wings; that one was different. It was a female. I would know that pigeonanywhere.“No matter where I was that pigeon would find me; when I wanted her I had onlyto wish and call her and she would come flying to me. She understood me and Iunderstood her.“I loved that pigeon.“Yes,” he replied to an unasked question. “Yes, I loved that pigeon, I loved heras a man loves a woman, and she loved me. When she was ill I knew, andunderstood; she came to my room and I stayed beside her for days. I nursed herback to health. That pigeon was the joy of my life. If she needed me, nothingelse mattered. As long as I had her, there was a purpose in my life.“Then one night as I was lying in my bed in the dark, solving problems, asusual, she flew in through the open window and stood on my desk. I knew shewanted me; she wanted to tell me something important so I got up and went toher.“As I looked at her I knew she wanted to tell me—she was dying. And then, as Igot her message, there came a light from her eyes—powerful beams of light.“Yes,” he continued, again answering an unasked question, “it was a real light,a powerful, dazzling, blinding light, a light more intense than I had everproduced by the most powerful lamps in my laboratory.“When that pigeon died, something went out of my life. Up to that time I knewwith a certainty that I would complete my work, no matter how ambitious myprogram, but when that something went out of my life I knew my life’s work wasfinished.“Yes, I have fed pigeons for years; I continue to feed them, thousands of them,for after all, who can tell—”There was nothing more to say. We parted in silence. The talk took place in acorner of the mezzanine in the Hotel New Yorker. I was accompanied by William L.Laurence, science writer of the New York Times. We walked several blocks onSeventh Avenue before we spoke.No longer was there any mystery to the midnight pilgrimages when he called thepigeons from their niches in the Gothic tracery of the Cathedral, or from underthe eaves of the Greek temple that houses the Library—pursuing, among thethousands of them… “For after all, who can tell…?”It is out of phenomena such as Tesla experienced when the dove flew out of themidnight darkness and into the blackness of his room and flooded it withblinding light, and the revelation that came to him out of the dazzling sun inthe park at Budapest, that the mysteries of religion are built. But hecomprehended them not; for, if he had not suppressed the rich mysticalinheritance of his ancestors that would have brought enlightenment, he wouldhave understood the symbolism of the Dove."},{"pageContent":"JOHN J.
