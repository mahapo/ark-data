We rep ort on the progress of a NASA-funded study being carried out at the Lo ckheed Martin Adv anced Technology Cen ter in Palo Alto and the California State Univ ersit y in Long Beac h to investigate the prop osed link between the zero-p oin t \feld of the quan tum vacuum and inertia. It is well kno wn that an accelerating observ er will exp erience a bath of radiation resulting from the quan tum vacuum whic h mimics that of a heat bath, the so-called Da vies- Unruh e\u000bect. We have further analyzed this problem of an accelerated object mo ving through the vacuum and have sho wn that the zero-p oin t \feld will yield a non-zero Poynting vector to an accelerating observ er. Scattering of this radiation by the quarks and electrons constituting matter would result in an acceleration-dep enden t reaction force that would app ear to be the origin of inertia of matter (Rueda and Haisc h 1998a, 1998b). In the subrelativistic case this inertia reaction force is exactly newtonian and in the relativistic case it exactly repro duces the well kno wn relativistic extension of Newton's Law. This analysis demonstrates then that both the ordinary , ~ F = m~a , and the relativistic forms of Newton's equation of motion ma y be deriv ed from Maxw ell's equations as applied to the electromagnetic zero-p oin t \feld. We exp ect to be able to extend this analysis in the future to more general versions of the quan tum vacuum than just the electromagnetic one discussed herein. BA CK GR OUND In July 1998 the Adv anced Concepts O\u000ece at JPL and the NASA O\u000ece of Space Science sponsored a four-da y workshop at Caltec h on \\Rob otic Interstellar Exploration in the Next Cen tury .\" The objectiv e was to bring together scien tists and engineers to surv ey the landscap e of possible ideas that could lead to unmanned missions beyond the Solar System beginning within a timeframe of 40 years. Missions to Kuip er Belt objects ( > 40 AU), the local interstellar medium beyond the heliopause ( > 150 AU), the Oort Cloud (10000 \u0000 50000 AU), and ultimately the nearest star system ( \u000b Cen tauri at 270000 AU) were considered. Presen t rocket tec hnology falls short of the necessary propulsion requiremen ts by orders of magnitude. Rad- ically new capabilities are needed, and one approac h is by extreme extrap olation of kno wn tec hnologies. Ideas presen ted at the workhop thus included: anti-matter initiated fusion; particle beams whic h could be accurately directed to a target vehicle at ligh t-y ear distances owing to nanotec hology navigation capabilities built into the particles themselv es; curren t-carrying tether arra ys 1000 by 1000 km in size that could gen- erate Loren tz forces by interaction with the interstellar magnetic \feld; laser-pushed ligh tsails that could be accurately poin ted and main tain collimation at stellar distances, etc. The extreme sizes of structures and the extreme tolerances required for suc h concepts is worrisome. Taking the laser-driv en sail as an example, let us assume that a mission prop elled by a 1 km diameter ligh tsail 1"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"is halfw ay (2 \u0002 10 13 km) to \u000b Cen tauri when a beam problem reac hes the vehicle. A one part in 10 13 misalignmen t of the laser which occurr ed 2 years previously back on earth is now reac hing the vehicle causing the beam to miss the ligh t sail. Owing to the speed-of-ligh t limitation, it will be another 2 years before any news of this transmitted by the spacecraft can reac h the earth. It will be yet another 2 years before the correction from earth will reac h the spacecraft. But by then the vehicle ma y have drifted out of its tra jectory su\u000ecien tly owing to the secular e\u000bects of interaction with the interstellar medium (or other causes) that it is still out of the beam. Indeed, any drift of the vehicle from a line-of-sigh t tra jectory will cause the same uncorrectible problem in the \frst place since there is no way to kno w where the vehicle is \\no w\" (in the sense of where the beam is supp osed to hit). This illustrates the inheren t problem of speed-of-ligh t caused time dela y in any feedbac k loop; it would be all too easy | in fact probably una voidable | to have a mission \\lost in space without a paddle\" due to the sligh test error using this propulsion mec hanism. An alternativ e approac h to extreme and perhaps unrealistic tec hnologies is to consider what kinds of new physics migh t leapfrog us beyond this: after all, no amoun t of money and energy exp ended on maximizing information transmission via 19th cen tury pony express couriers could approac h the amoun t and instan taneit y of information transmission by televison or the internet for example. In this case, the capabilities of \\new physics\" in electro dynamics utterly sup erseded mec hanics. Ob viously one would like new physics that will permit faster-than-ligh t ( v > c ) tra vel and pro vide access to unlimited energy . The v > c hop e cannot be encouraged, however, owing to the fundamen tal con\ricts it causes with resp ect to relativit y and causalit y. a Ho wever it does app ear that there ma y be the equiv alen t of other new physics lurking within the electro dynamics of the quan tum vacuum. At this time there are four possibilities relev ant to future propulsion tec hnology that have a su\u000ecien tly well- dev elop ed basis in quan tum vacuum physics so as to warran t further theoretical investigation: extraction of energy , generation of force, and manipulation of inertia and possibly even of gra vitation. The realization of any one of these would leapfr og beyond all other conc epts of interstel lar travel presente d at the workshop, and this was the topic of an invite d presentation at the Calte ch confer enc e by Haisch. THE ZER O-POINT FIELD OF THE QUANTUM VACUUM A NASA-funded researc h e\u000bort has been underw ay since 1996 at the Lo ckheed Martin Adv anced Technology Cen ter in Palo Alto and at the California State Univ ersit y in Long Beac h to explore the physics of the quan tum vacuum and its possible long-term poten tial applications. That e\u000bort is a follo w-on to previous work suggesting a relationship between the electromagnetic zero-p oin t \feld of the quan tum vacuum and inertia (Haisc h, Rueda and Putho\u000b, 1994). In the con ventional interpretation of quan tum theory , an electromagnetic zero-p oin t \feld arises as a con- sequence of the Heisen berg uncertain ty relation as applied to eac h mo de of the electromagnetic \feld. No oscillator can ever be brough t completely to rest due to quan tum \ructuations. The minim um energy for a mec hanical oscillator whose natural frequency is \u0017 is E = h\u0017= 2. Eac h mo de of the electromagnetic \feld also acts as an oscillator. Th us for any frequency , \u0017 , direction, ~ k , and polarization state, \u001b , there is a minim um energy of E = h\u0017= 2 in the electromagnetic \feld. Summing up all of these mo des, eac h with its E = h\u0017= 2 of energy , results in an electromagnetic ground state of energy that should permeate the entire univ erse: the a In a famous speec h in 1900, Lord Kelvin extolled the near completeness of physics (owing in no small measure, naturally , to his own Herculean e\u000borts) with only two dark clouds on the otherwise clear horizon: the blac kbody problem and the failure to detect the ether. At the momen t there is arguably a glimmering of two even smaller clouds on the horizon with resp ect to relativit y and causalit y that ma y ultimately poin t the way to some conceiv able v > c physics. With resp ect to relativit y, it would be surprising if the rest frame de\fned by the cosmic micro wave bac kground did not turn out to be someho w special after all, perhaps opening the door to non-Loren tzian space-time physics. With resp ect to causalit y, the cloud is even wispier. It is an enigma within an anomaly that there is some credible evidence for human extrasensory perception and that this perception of information app ears not to be dep enden t up on time, there apparen tly being no greater barrier to accessing future information than presen t information (Jahn et al. 1997). It would, of course, be unwise to mak e any interstellar plans on this basis. 2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"electromagnetic zero-p oin t \feld, or ZPF. (The term ZPF refers to either the zero-p oin t \felds or equiv alen tly zero-p oin t \ructuations of the electromagnetic quan tum vacuum; the term ZPE refers to the energy con ten t of the electromagnetic quan tum vacuum.) All other natural or arti\fcial electromagnetic radiation would sit on top of this very energetic ground state. The volumetric densit y of mo des between frequencies \u0017 and \u0017 + d\u0017 is giv en by the densit y of states function N \u0017 d\u0017 = (8 \u0019\u0017 2 =c 3 ) d\u0017 . Using this densit y of states function and the minim um energy , h\u0017= 2, that we call the zero-p oin t energy per state one can calculate the ZPF spectral energy densit y: \u001a ( \u0017 ) d\u0017 = 8 \u0019\u0017 2 c 3 h\u0017 2 d\u0017: (1) It is instructiv e to write the expression for zero-p oin t spectral energy densit y side by side with blac kbody radiation: \u001a ( \u0017;T ) d\u0017 = 8 \u0019\u0017 2 c 3 \u0012 h\u0017 e h\u0017=kT \u0000 1 + h\u0017 2 \u0013 d\u0017: (2) The \frst term (outside the paren theses) represen ts the mo de densit y, and the terms inside the paren theses are the average energy per mo de of thermal radiation at temp erature T plus the zero-p oin t energy , h\u0017= 2, whic h has no temp erature dep endence. Take away all thermal energy by formally letting T go to zero, and one is still left with the zero-p oin t term: the ground state of the electromagnetic quan tum vacuum. The laws of quan tum mec hanics as applied to electromagnetic radiation force the existence of a bac kground sea of zero-p oin t-\feld (ZPF) radiation. Zero-p oin t radiation is tak en to result from quan tum laws. It is traditionally assumed in quan tum theory , though, that the ZPF can for practical purp oses be ignored or subtracted away. The foundation of the discipline in physics kno wn as sto chastic electro dynamics (SED) is the exact opp osite (see e.g. de la Pe~ na and Cetto 1996 for a thorough review of SED). It is assumed in SED that the ZPF is as real as any other electromagnetic \feld. As to its origin, the assumption is that zero-p oin t radiation simply came with the Uni- verse. The justi\fcation for this is that if one assumes that all of space is \flled with ZPF radiation, a num ber of quan tum phenomena ma y be explained purely on the basis of classical physics including the presence of bac kground electromagnetic \ructuations pro vided by the ZPF. The Heisen berg uncertain ty relation, in this view, becomes then not a result of the existence of quan tum laws, but of the fact that there is a univ ersal perturbing ZPF acting on everything. The original motiv ation for dev eloping SED was to see whether the need for quan tum laws separate from classical physics could thus be obviated entirely . Philosophically , a univ erse \flled | for reasons unkno wn | with a ZPF but with only one set of physical laws (classical physics consisting of mec hanics and electro dynamics), would app ear to be on an equal footing with a univ erse governed | for reasons unkno wn | by two distinct physical laws (classical and quan tum). In terms of physics, though, SED and quan tum electro dynamics, QED, are not on an equal footing, since SED has been successful in pro viding a satisfactory alternativ e to only some quan tum phenomena (although this success does include a classical ZPF-based deriv ation of the all-imp ortan t blac kbody spectrum, cf. Bo yer 1984). Some of this is simply due to lac k of e\u000bort: The ratio of man-y ears dev oted to dev elopmen t of QED is sev eral orders of magnitude greater than the exp enditure so far on SED. There is disagreemen t about whether this zero-p oin t \feld should be regarded as real or virtual. A num ber of well-established phenomena suc h as the Casimir force and the Lam b shift are equally well explained in terms of either the action of a real ZPF or simply the quan tum \ructuations of particles. This parado x is discussed in some detail by Milonni (1988). It is clearly essen tial to determine how \\real\" the zero-p oin t \feld is. ENER GY EXTRA CTION FR OM THE QUANTUM VACUUM In the early part of this cen tury the disco very of radioactivit y seemed to violate the law of energy con- serv ation. Heat and radiation app eared to be con tin uously giv en o\u000b as if by a source of \\free energy\" in certain elemen ts (e.g. radium, uranium). The resolution came with the understanding that mass was being 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"con verted into energy via the E = mc 2 relationship of special relativit y in a pro cess of spontaneous deca y of unstable elemen ts, the naturally occuring radioisotop es. The low-lev el energy emitted by deca y of natural or arti\fcially-created radioisotop es is of limited use. Ho wever with the successful demonstration of \fssion in the 1940's, nuclear engineering became possible allo wing us to tap a much more powerful mo de of atomic energy release . Chemical energy pro duction, as in the burning of petroleum-based fuels or con ventional rocket propulsion, taps the energy in the orbital electrons of atoms. Atomic energy generation taps the binding energy of the nuclear constituen ts of atoms. Is it possible to tap yet a deep er (and poten tially much more powerful) source of energy: the ZPE of the electromagnetic quan tum vacuum? There are two issues that bear on this. It is often assumed that attempting to tap the energy of the vacuum must violate thermo dynamics. One cannot extract thermal energy from a reserv oir at temp erature, T 1 , if the environmen t is at temp erature, T 2 > T 1 . While it is true that the ZPE is the energy remaining when all energy sources have been remo ved and the temp erature reduced to T = 0 K, the ZPE is not a thermal reserv oir. It has very di\u000beren t characteristics than ordinary heat. The thermo dynamics of energy extraction from the quan tum vacuum have been analyzed by Cole and Putho\u000b (1993). They conclude as follo ws: Relativ ely recen t prop osals have been made in the literature for extracting energy and heat from electromagnetic zero-p oin t radiation via the use of the Casimir force. The basic thermo dynam- ics involv ed in these prop osals is analyzed and clari\fed here, with the conclusion that, yes, in principle, these prop osals are correct. Technological considerations for the actual application and use are not examined here, however. If the zero-p oin t \feld is a real electromagnetic ground state, then there is no inconsistency with presen t-da y physics in the possibilit y of tapping this energy . Indeed, it has been prop osed that certain astroph ysical pro cesses are driv en by the natural extraction of suc h energy (cf. Rueda, Haisc h and Cole 1995 and refer- ences therein) and an ideal exp erimen t has been prop osed by Forw ard (1984) that clearly demonstrates the conceptual possibilit y of extracting vacuum energy . A second poin t to consider is that the orbital energy of electrons and the E = mc 2 relationship itself ma y both ultimately be traceable to zero-p oin t energy . While limited so far to the single, simple case of the ground-state of hydrogen, the work of Bo yer (1975) and Putho\u000b (1987) suggests that electron energy lev els ma y be stabilized against radiativ e collapse by interaction with the quan tum vacuum. This would in principle link chemical energy to the energy of the ZPF. In his preliminary dev elopmen t of the Sakharo v conjecture on gra vit y as a ZPF-induced force, Putho\u000b (1989) suggests that the E = mc 2 relationship re\rects the kinetic energy of zitterb ewe gung (Sc hrodinger's term) whic h originates in the \ructuations induced by the ZPF on charged particles (quarks and electrons). In other words, instead of expressing a relationship between mass and energy , the E = mc 2 relationship tells us how much ZPF-driv en energy is asso ciated with a giv en particle. When this energy is lib erated it is thus not really a transformation of mass into energy , rather a release of zero-p oin t energy asso ciated with this quan tum motion kno wn as zitterb ewe gung . This would in principle link atomic energy to the energy of the ZPF. (An attempt at a classical visualization of this motion from the SED viewp oin t ma y be found in Rueda, 1993). If the above interpretations pro ve to be valid and it is ultimately the energy of the ZPF that is being tapp ed in chemical and atomic energy pro duction pro cesses, then it is not inconceiv able that other channels will be found to lib erate energy from the quan tum vacuum. Since the ZPF must be univ ersal, a propulsion driv e energized by the ZPF would have access to unlimited \\fuel\" anywhere ::: the ZPE thus pro viding the ultimate energy source. IN-SITU GENERA TION OF FOR CES The existence of the Casimir force | an attraction between unc harged conducting plates | is now well established. Measuremen ts by Lamoreaux (1997) are in agreemen t with theoretical predictions to within a few percen t. A particularly simple interpretation involving the ZPF was presen ted by Milonni, Co ok and Goggin (1988): 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"We calculate the vacuum-\feld radiation pressure on two parallel, perfectly conducting plates. The mo des outside the plates push the plates together, those con\fned between the plates push them apart, and the net e\u000bect is the well-kno wn Casimir force. In other words, the electromagnetic boundary conditions on the two plates exclude a certain amoun t of ZPF from the cavit y in between. This results in an overpressure from the ZPF outside, whic h then acts as a pressure on the plates. This is one interpretation: call it the ZPF radiation pressure mo del. It is also possible to interpret the force as \\a macroscopic manifestation of the retarded van der Waals force between two neutral polarizable particles\" (Milonni, Co ok and Goggin 1988), i.e. a quan tum e\u000bect involving the particles in the plates (see Milonni 1982). The speculation concerning propulsion is that the ZPF radiation pressure mo del of the Casimir force is physically correct and that it ma y be possible to construct some wall or cavit y that interacts with the ZPF di\u000beren tly on one side than on the other. If that were possible, one would have in e\u000bect a ZPF-sail that could pro vide a propulsiv e force anywhere in space. MODIFICA TION OF INER TIAL AND GRA VIT ATIONAL MASS The ultimate capabilit y enabling practical interstellar tra vel would be the abilit y to tap the energy of the vacuum while at the same time mo difying the inertia of the spacecraft. Reducing inertia of a spacecraft would allo w higher velo city for the same exp enditure of energy and more rapid acceleration without damage to the structure owing to the reduction of inertial forces. The absolute limit would be acceleration to velo city c \u0000 \u000f in time \u000e where both \u000f and \u000e approac h zero. Un til recen tly there was absolutely no basis in physics for even considering suc h a possibilit y. While suc h a possibilit y still app ears to be remote, there now does exist a basis in physics to at least begin to explore this concept. In 1994 Haisc h, Rueda and Putho\u000b published a pap er, \\Inertia as a zero-p oin t \feld Loren tz Force,\" in whic h a substan tiv e mathematical analysis indicated that the inertia of matter could be interpreted as an electromagnetic reaction force originating in the quan tum vacuum. This concept has now been redev elop ed by Rueda and Haisc h (1998a, 1998b) in a way that is both mathematically simpler while at the same time yielding a prop erly covarian t relativistic result. This is encouraging that we are on the righ t trac k. In a frame at rest or in uniform motion, the ZPF is uniform and isotropic. This is due to the Loren tz invariance of the ZPF spectrum. (The spectral cuto\u000b of the spectrum would not be Loren tz invarian t, but if the inertia interaction tak es place at a frequency or resonance far from the cuto\u000b, this would not matter.) Ho wever in an accelerated frame the ZPF becomes asymmetric. Rueda and Haisc h have sho wn that the Poynting vector | whic h characterizes the radiativ e energy \rux | becomes non-zero in an accelerating frame. If the quarks and electrons in matter undergoing acceleration scatter this ZPF \rux, a reaction force will arise that is prop ortional to accleration. This is prop osed to be the origin of inertia of matter. Inertia is not an innate property of matter; it is an acceler ation-dep endent ele ctr omagnetic reaction for ce. The principle of equiv alence mandates that gra vitational and inertial mass must be the same. Therefore, if inertial mass is electromagnetic in origin, then gra vitational mass must also be electromagnetic in some fashion. A preliminary dev elopmen t of a gra vitational analysis based on the electro dynamics of the ZPF has been made by Putho\u000b (1989). Subsequen t critiques have poin ted out some de\fciencies in this analysis. Nev ertheless, it is encouraging that the ZPF-related parameters that determine \\mass\" turn out to be iden tical in the inertia and gra vitation analyses (see App endix A in Haisc h, Rueda and Putho\u000b 1994). From this view, the ZPF acts as a mediator of a gra vitational force, but cannot itself gra vitate, hence would not result in an unacceptably large cosmological constan t (Haisc h and Rueda 1997). We now have a theoretical basis to explore the possibilit y that electro dynamics ma y be used to mo dify the quan tum vacuum in some way so as to alter inertia and/or gra vitation. It would be pruden t to con tin ue suc h investigations. 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ACKNO WLEDGMENTS We ackno wledge supp ort of NASA con tract NASW-5050 for this work.
