But why? What would be in it for you? Do you think it would help youmake more money? Make a name for yourself? Find love, happiness, or fulfillment?I’ve asked many people these questions and their answers are invariable. “Ofcourse it would.” The cultural correlation is undeniable: we’ve beenindoctrinated to believe that the higher the IQ, the more likely one is tosucceed in life. Hence, we assume that the scientists that win Nobel Prizes, thebusinesspeople that go from rags to millions, the authors that write runawaybestsellers, register in the highest ranges of IQ simply because they’reenjoying sweet successes.Well, a tremendous amount of research has been done into the scientificcorrelation between IQ and real-life success, and a very different picture hasemerged.IQ and success are related...to a point. Sure, someone with an IQ of 150 (a“genius” by all normal standards) is going to do much better in life thansomeone with an IQ of 80 (nearly “mentally disabled”). Similarly, a person withan IQ of 130 (“near genius”) has a significant upper hand in life when comparedto a person with an IQ of 100 (“average”).But here’s the catch: the relation between IQ and success follows the law ofdiminishing returns. That is, when you compare two people of relatively highIQs, you can no longer predict success by IQ alone. A scientist with an IQ of130 is just as likely to rise to the top of his discipline as one with an IQ of180.Dr. Liam Hudson, a British psychologist that headed up Cambridge’s Research Unitof Intellectual Development in the sixties, compared IQ to basketball. If you’refive foot five, your prospects of becoming even an NBA bench warmer areslim-to-none. The fact is if you’re less than six feet tall, you can pretty muchforget about your dreams to challenge King James in his court.Statistical data shows us that you have to be at least seventy-two inches tallto be allowed on the ride, and each inch you push over that is probably betterfor you. There comes a point, however, when height just doesn’t matter muchanymore. Just because someone is seven feet tall doesn’t mean he’s a betterplayer than someone who’s six foot six (Michael Jordan’s height). The point isyou only have to be tall enough to have a shot at the pros.The same pattern is true of intelligence and success in life. You only have tobe smart enough to fulfill the intellectual requirements for success. History’sgreatest achievers—practical, savvy people that did big things and changed theworld—are heralded as the greatest geniuses to ever have walked the earth, butwhile many of them had remarkably high IQs, many others were just smart enough.If we can’t explain their success in terms of IQ alone, what else did theypossess that allowed them to rise to such heights?Most people would answer along the lines of “extraordinary inherent talent.” Andthey would be wrong.- - -Call in the inspired bard, Demodocus.God has given the man the gift of song.That’s one of the many god-given gifts of characters in the Odyssey. We’velearned much since it was written—we’ve decoded human DNA and discovered ourplace in the universe—but we still marvel at the abilities of geniuses in thesame way as the ancient Greeks did.Whether we listen to a sonata of Beethoven’s, watch highlight reels of MichaelJordan, or learn a law of Newton’s, we view extraordinary human skills as giftsgranted by unknown forces for unknown reasons. Such an explanation isconvenient, but is it correct?For the last two centuries, behavioral scientists have studied that questionthrough focused research on great performers of all types: business managers,chess players, swimmers, surgeons, jet pilots, violinists, salespeople, writers,and many others. Their findings, numbering in the hundreds, have led toconclusions that fly straight in the teeth of what “everybody knows” aboutability.The studies conclusively disproved the notion that great performance stemsprimarily from a natural “gift” or talent. While some people display innatetalents for certain activities early on, amazingly average people have becomechampions in all manner of endeavors. Many such top performers overcame theiraverage—or even below-average—intellects and nonexistent aptitudes to developoutstanding abilities in disciplines such as chess, music, business, andmedicine.Examples of such remarkable transformations abound throughout history. HenryFord failed in business several times and was flat broke five times before hefounded the Ford Motor Company. In his youth, Thomas Edison’s teachers told himhe was “too stupid to learn anything.” Beethoven was so awkward on the violinthat his teachers believed him hopeless as a composer.The world of sports reveals similar findings. Many athletes viewed as superhumanin their abilities were found to have little or no inherent advantage over theirpeers when they first began their journeys to greatness. Michael Jordan didn’tmake his sophomore team because he was deemed too short and average to play atthat level. Stan Smith, a world-class tennis player and winner of Wimbledon, theU.S. Open, and eight Davis cups, was once rejected for the lowly position of aball boy because the event organizers felt he was too clumsy and uncoordinated.How do we explain such unintuitive findings?While many theories were put forth, there was one common factor that researchersrecognized in all great performers: they practiced so hard and intensely that ithurt.Ted Williams, a baseball legend considered the most “gifted” hitter of his time,was believed to have natural abilities far beyond ordinary men, includingeagle-like vision, extraordinary hand-eye coordination, and uncanny hittinginstincts. Williams later said that such stories were all “a lot of bull.” Hehad a much better explanation for his superior skills.Williams began his path to greatness at the age of seven, when he decided todedicate his entire life to one singular task: hitting a baseball as perfectlyas possible. Starting at that young age, Williams spent every free minute he hadat San Diego’s old North Park field hitting balls, every day, year after yearafter year. His childhood friends recall finding him on that field smashingballs with the outer shells completely beaten off, with a splintered bat, andwith blistered, bleeding hands. He would spend his lunch money to hire otherkids to shag his balls so he could hit as many as possible every day. When thecity turned off the field’s lights, he would go home and swing a rolled-upnewspaper in the mirror until he went to bed.This obsession continued throughout William’s entire professional career, andit’s no surprise that he excelled because of it. For “The Kid,” as he was known,greatness was a long, grueling process—not a gift from the beyond (a claim thathe found insulting).Studies of people with extraordinary abilities, like Ted Williams, have givenrise to what Swedish psychologist Dr. K Anders Ericsson called the “10,000 hour”rule. The rule’s premise is that, regardless of whether one has an innateaptitude for an activity or not, mastery of it takes around ten thousand hoursof focused, intentional practice. Analyzing the lives of geniuses in a widerange of intellectual, artistic, and athletic pursuits confirms this concept.From Mozart to Bobby Fischer to Bill Gates to the Beatles, their diversejourneys from nothing toward excellence in their respective fields shared acommon denominator: the accumulation of ten thousand hours of unwavering“exercise” of their crafts.To put that number in perspective, if you practiced an activity four hours perday, seven days per week, it would take you about seven years to reach tenthousand hours. That kind of dedication can only come from the heart—a true loveand passion for the activity.So, what does all this tell us? First, that the seed of greatness exists inevery human being. Whether it sprouts or not is our choice. Second, that thereare no such things as natural-born under- or overachievers—there are simplypeople that tap into their true potentials and people that don’t. What isgenerally recognized as “great talent” is, in almost all cases, nothing morethan the outward manifestations of an unwavering dedication to a process.Thus, the advice of “work toward your ten thousand hours” sounds completelyreasonable. Right? But there’s a problem. There are millions of people that workincredibly hard, yet have little success to show for it. Is ten thousand hourstoo simple of a prescription for greatness?Yes. It overlooks another aspect of great achievement that cannot be ignored:opportunities—conditions that often appear to be plain old dumb luck.- - -As Malcolm Gladwell explains in Outliers, in many ways, the opportunitiespresented to one are just as important to success as one’s own inherent talentsand willingness to put in thousands of hours of work. For instance, if yourdream is to become a professional athlete, it’s quite possible that you won’t beable to work hard enough to overcome a most devious obstacle: your birthday. Howcould that possibly be a hurdle?Easy. Most sports enforce age cut-offs—that is, the ages that determine whetheryou can play another year in your current age bracket as a “senior,” or whetheryou have to move up and be a “freshman” in the next.In Canadian junior hockey leagues, the age cutoff was formally January 1 (it’snow December 31). The closer your birthday was to January 2, the better. Why?Well, let’s say you were playing in the Bantam category, which is for childrenaged 13 – 14. If your birthday was in December, you were going to get two yearsof play at this level. You were going to turn fifteen and have to moveimmediately into the next category, Midget (which is for kids aged 15 – 16). Ifyour birthday was January 2, however, you’d get an entire additional year toplay in Bantam (and every other age group) because when the ages were checked onJanuary 1, you were still fourteen years old.An extra year of play against players younger than you is a huge advantage. Yourbody becomes bigger, stronger, and faster every day, giving you an opportunityto truly stand out from your birthday-handicapped peers. This extradevelopmental time predisposes you for selection onto more elite teams, which inturn leads to more ice time and better coaching, which advances your abilitieseven further.Sociologists call this phenomenon an “accumulative advantage.” For the eliteCanadian junior hockey leagues, the result of this advantage was that for manyyears, the distribution of birth dates for the top performing kids was heavilyweighted toward “first-quarter” babies—kids born between January and March.Whether we’re talking birthdays in sports, or the fact that Bill Gates justhappened to go to a high school that housed one of the most advanced computersof the time—a computer that most colleges didn’t even have—we can easily seethat being in the right place (physical, educational, societal, or otherwise) atthe right time can influence our destinies as much as anything else.Now, that doesn’t mean our fates are written in the stars. We can wholly controlour dedication to thousands of hours of study, training and work. And graspingopportunities is equally controllable. Sure, we may not be built for the NFL orKentucky Derby, but we’re surrounded by opportunities every day, everywhere wego. There is no shortage of problems to be solved, needs and desires to befulfilled, and innovative ways to help others.But there’s a catch. Most opportunities never announce themselves with trumpetsand confetti. They’re easily missed, mistaken, or squandered. They can be scary.And they never come with a 110% money-back guarantee. They’re often nothing morethan chances to improve on something other people are already doing.Opportunities are whispers, not foghorns.If we can’t hear their soft rhythms—if we are too busy rushing about, waitingfor thunderclaps of revelation, inspiration, and certainty—or if we can spotthem but can’t nurture them into real advantages, then we might as well be blindto them.This realization points us to the real heart and mystery of greatness. Justknowing that great achievers work very hard and take advantage of opportunitiesisn’t enough. Why do some people recognize, appreciate, and pursue opportunitieswith passion and determination, whereas others don’t? Why are some peoplewilling to push through hell and high water to win, whereas others quit earlyand easily? Are there practical answers to these questions, or are theyunsolvable enigmas of human psychology?Well, I believe there are very practical answers to what makes a genius tick. Ibelieve there are principles that we can isolate and use to better our ownlives. I believe that genius is a path that we can all take and derive muchbenefit, happiness, fulfillment, and success from...not a genetic windfall ordivine gift. Ultimately, this is the path to greatness.Not sure if you buy into that? Well, I wouldn’t either if I didn’t know aboutDr. Alfred Barrios.- - -Psychologist Dr. Alfred Barrios conducted research on the nature of genius inthe seventies. He set out to answer the same basic question I posed just a pageago: why do some people rise to greatness whereas others don’t?To look for an answer, he decided to analyze the lives of many of history’sgreatest geniuses. Were there patterns of circumstances, events, behaviors,attitudes, or ideas that could account for their success? Did the chronicles oftheir lives collectively hold the secrets to their greatness? He was going tofind out.He first noted and categorized a long list of factors outside of the geniuses’control. Things like lineage, birthright, geography, genetics, education,familial ties, upbringing, and unexpected windfalls. The more data heaccumulated and analyzed along this line, however, the more it looked like adead end. The backgrounds of our species’ greatest thinkers and achieversappeared infinitely varied. If there were patterns among the data, he couldn’tsee them.Barrios was undeterred and continued to study. Eventually, a different kind ofcommon denominator emerged, one that he found within each of the people hestudied. Barrios discovered that his subjects had each developed and routinelydisplayed a combination of very specific characteristics throughout their lives,and not just mildly but conspicuously.This character-driven idea fascinated Barrios. It suggested that genius is muchmore than high intelligence, innate talent, extraordinary work ethic, or uncannyluck, but rather a composite manifestation; a synthesis of very specific typesof worldviews and behaviors. The more he looked at data through this lens, themore things started to make sense.Barrios then wondered if anyone could operate at a genius level—and achievegenius-level greatness—simply by learning and adopting the same educated viewsand disciplined behaviors that so repeatedly characterized history’s greatestachievers.By the end of his research, Barrios had pieced together his “genius code”—aprofound insight into what really spawns greatness. He also concluded that wecould all indeed use his genius code as a roadmap to walk in the footsteps ofhistory’s brightest and boldest, thereby learning to operate at a genius level.An attractive concept, no doubt, but is it true?In this book, we will delve into a single characteristic of Barrios’ code:imagination. We will look at how it defined one of history’s greatest geniuses,Nikola Tesla, and how we can further develop it in ourselves.My proclamation is that while Barrios’ research may not be the end-all on thesubject, it certainly illuminates the path to greatness via a unique,accessible, and practical decoding of genius.This immediately involves us in a bigger picture question, too—one that’s deeplypenetrating and personal: why do we desire to heighten our genius and pursue thepath of greatness?We all face a fundamental choice in our lives. Do we take the path prescribed byour “now you’re supposed to” society, or do we take our own path toward the lifewe feel we ought to be living? Do we choose our life’s work based on the U.S.Department of Labor’s list of highest-paying jobs, or do we follow our bliss? Dowe heed the call to conformity, or the call to adventure?Every day we see how people have answered these questions, whether consciouslyor otherwise. We’re constantly confronted with the lazy, the apathetic, theimmoral, the indifferent, the irresponsible, and the disconnected—the signs of adecaying culture.“What does it all mean?” many wonder while chasing purposes they’re told areworthwhile, but which feel empty. “What is the purpose of this life?” humanshave wondered for millennia, contemplating how insignificant we are in the greatcosmic symphony.Well, as the preeminent mythologist Joseph Campbell said, deep down inside, wedon’t seek the meaning of life, but the experience of being alive. And that’swhat the nature of genius is ultimately about.It’s about how we can empower ourselves to bring true meaning to our lives andthe lives of others in ways most people would consider impossible. It’s aboutrising above a life of, as Thoreau said, “quiet desperation” that ends with oursongs still in our hearts, and experience the rapture of truly living. It’sabout saying yes to our adventures.We rely on geniuses to entertain us, educate us, lead us, and show us all whatour species is capable of. We rely on geniuses to give us smart phones, electriccars, cures for diseases, social networking sites, sublime art, world-classfood, and, indeed, the very fabric of our culture.If you’ve ever dreamed of playing a hand in the development of humankind, or ifyou just have a burning desire to improve one small aspect of it, then you havean adventure waiting.Will you take it?This book is your invitation."},{"pageContent":"IMAGINATION AND THE MAN WHO INVENTED THE 20TH CENTURY“Facts and ideas are dead in themselves and it is the imagination that giveslife to them.”-W. I. B. BeveridgeMany calls to adventure are puzzles waiting to be solved. Anyone can apply, butthe price of admission is paid in imagination. As journeys unfold, newchallenges arise and pressures mount. These successive tolls must too be paid increativity and ingenuity, as they were by history’s most imaginative minds.The only way that Jason can claim his rightful place as ruler of Iolcus, Greece,is by retrieving the fabled Golden Fleece from distant lands. The problem?Everyone considers the task impossible, fraught with terrifying perils certainto kill any man. Jason isn’t so sure. He assembles a mighty team of warriors—theArgonauts—and builds the largest ship ever constructed. He then figures out howto successfully navigate the legendary maze of crushing rocks known as theSymplegades, yoke fire-breathing, bronze-hoofed oxen, trick a mighty armyguarding the Fleece into ravaging itself to pieces, and drug a sleepless dragoninto its first slumber. Four months after departing, Jason returns with theFleece to take his throne.It’s the late 1800s. Anesthesia has just been introduced. Surgeries are on therise, but a disturbing number of patients are dying due to infection. JosephLister is determined to figure out why and what can be done about it. After muchresearch and thought, he concludes that Pasteur’s controversial germ theoryholds the key to the mystery. Killing germs in wounds with heat isn’t an option,however—a completely new method is required. Lister surmises that there may be achemical solution, and later that year, he reads in a newspaper that thetreatment of sewage with a chemical called carbolic acid reduced the incidenceof disease among the people and cattle of a nearby small English town. Listerfollows the lead and, in 1865, develops a successful method of applying carbolicacid to wounds to prevent infection. He continues to work along this line andestablishes antisepsis as a basic principle of surgery. Thanks to hisdiscoveries and innovations, amputations become less frequent, deaths due toinfection plummet, and new surgeries previously considered impossible are beingroutinely planned and executed.Andrew Carnegie is thirteen years old and changing spools of thread in a cottonmill twelve hours per day, six days per week. Two years later, he gets a job asa telegraph messenger for $2.50 per week, and he’s determined to advance throughthe company’s ranks despite his age. He quickly learns to distinguish thedifferent sounds of incoming telegraph signals, and then learns to translatethem by ear. Within a year, he’s promoted as an operator. By the time he’s inhis mid-twenties, he’s made a small fortune through shrewd investments inrailroad-related industries, and he’s working to repair and re-open rail andtelegraph lines vital to the Union’s war efforts against the Confederacy. Thewar impresses upon him the importance of manufacturing to the overall success ofthe American economy, which informs his shift of capital and interest toironworking. Over the next thirty years, Carnegie’s innovations set the standardfor cheap, efficient, and profitable mass production of steel, achievements thatforge the most extensive iron and steel operations ever owned by an individualin the United States.The philosopher Edmund Burke said “there is a boundary to men’s passions whenthey act from feelings; but none when they are under the influence ofimagination.” Imagination is the life force of the genius code. This forceamplifies and colors every other piece of the code, and unlocks our potentialfor understanding and ability. It’s no coincidence that geniuses not only dareto dream of the impossible for their work, but do the same for their lives.They’re audacious enough to think that they’re not just an ordinary player.Few stories better illustrate this than the life of the father of the modernworld, a man of legendary imaginative power and wonder.- - -Nikola Tesla strolled through the Varosliget city park of Budapest with afriend, reciting Goethe’s Faust, unaware that he was about to change the courseof history.The year was 1882. Only two years earlier, Edison had patented a system forelectricity distribution using direct current generators, which produced a flowof electricity in one direction. Edison’s breakthrough was a modern miracledespite having serious limitations. Namely, the generators had no efficient wayto change the voltage of direct current circuits, so generation plants couldonly serve customers within a two-mile radius. Thus, it was unlikely that thisform of electricity would ever be available in non-metropolitan areas.Tesla was admiring the prismatic rays of the Hungarian sunset when a visionstruck him. Following a blinding flash of light, he saw the complete workings ofa motor that used a rotating magnetic field to produce an electric current thatalternated its direction many times per second. He grabbed a stick anddiagrammed the motor in the sand while his friend watched, unsure of what tothink. After all, such a machine was theoretically impossible. In fact, sevenyears earlier, his professor at a college in Austria ridiculed him forsuggesting that direct current generators could be modified to produce anefficient alternating current. Tesla dropped out of college a year later, buthis imagination never quit.Shortly after his Varosliget park revelation, Tesla took the first step to makeit a reality: he relocated to Paris to work for the Continental Edison Companyinstalling lighting systems in commercial properties. His passion, however, wasdesigning improvements to the equipment brought overseas from Edison’s ideas. Ifhe could catch the attention of his superiors with his work, there was a chancehe could present his revolutionary motor and win funding and support. Tesla’saptitude for electrical engineering was quickly noticed, and several ideas ofhis were implemented to improve Edison’s direct current dynamos.A year later, Tesla was in Straasbourg, France to repair a railway lightingsystem. He made the necessary repairs, but that wasn’t all he did. He built thefirst prototype of his visionary alternating current motor, which worked exactlyas he had conceived it in his mind. His own miracle in-hand, Tesla immediatelycourted investors for his radical device. One by one, wealthy businessmen thatcouldn’t understand the device and didn’t see the commercial value in itrejected him. Tesla was undaunted. He concluded that the only way he couldrealize his motor was to meet the world’s greatest electrical engineer, ThomasEdison, directly.There’s a lesson here. In every field of human endeavor, the more visionary thework, the less likely it is to be quickly understood and embraced by lesserminds. For one reason or another, many people just “don’t get it.” Tesla tookthis in stride. As he saw it, he was offering an opportunity not only to make anuntold fortune, but to change the world forever. Instead of wasting time tryingto convince ignorant naysayers to see the forest for the trees, Tesla chose totake his work to another extraordinary mind who would, he assumed, immediatelyrecognize it for what it is.Later that month, Tesla arrived at the Straasbourg railway station to travel tothe harbor and board the ocean liner Saturnia, which would take him to New YorkCity—to Edison. His uncles had given him some money, and his boss had given hima letter of recommendation that read, “I know two great men and you are one ofthem; the other is this young man.”After almost missing his train, losing all his money along with his ticket,passport, and luggage, Tesla still managed to make it aboard the steamship. Amutiny broke out during the voyage, and he got caught in the middle of a battleroyale between crewmates. Tesla was arrested, pleaded innocence, and wasreleased, and finally arrived to New York City on June 6, 1884. He had nothingbut a few cents in his pocket, a few poems, calculations for a flying machine hedreamed of building one day, and the letter of recommendation. He went straightto meet his hero, Edison, and was starstruck. He briefly described theengineering work he had done for Edison’s company, and talked about his plansfor an alternating current motor.Direct current was barely a decade old when Tesla shook hands with Edison. Hisdistribution network in Manhattan was not only immensely profitable, but it wasthe only option if you wanted electricity. So, when Tesla explained thatalternating current would be the future of electricity, Edison dismissed it asfanciful and unnecessary. Direct current was getting the job done, people likedit, and it was making Edison and his financier, J.P. Morgan, exorbitant sums ofmoney. In Edison’s eyes, anything that challenged it was seen not as apraiseworthy advancement of science and industry, but a threat.Despite his monopolistic perspective, Edison liked Tesla and hired him on thespot to work with his electrical engineers. Tesla’s work began with simple taskssuch as repairing lighting systems, but within several months, he was one ofEdison’s most valuable engineers, and was solving some of the company’s mostdifficult problems. Edison referred to him as a “damn good man.”In 1885, Tesla informed Edison that he could greatly improve his direct currentgenerators by redesigning key elements. Edison thought it impossible andpromised Tesla $50,000 if he could deliver on his claims. Tesla workedtirelessly for the better part of a year to improve the generators, installingparts of his own design. Once completed, his generators were a vast improvementover Edison’s. They were far more efficient and durable, and thus far moreprofitable. Edison was thoroughly impressed, but when Tesla asked to be paid,Edison laughed and claimed he was only joking about the reward.“Tesla, you don’t understand our American humor,” he said. Instead, Edisonoffered Tesla a raise of $10 more per week, to be added to his current salary of$18 per week. Tesla was disgusted and immediately resigned. This was thebeginning of a lifelong feud between these two great inventors—one that Edisonwould later lament as his “greatest mistake.”Betrayed by men he trusted, Tesla found himself unemployed and in desperate needof work to survive. Ironically, he took a job as a ditch digger for an Edisoncompany, and was paid $2 per day. He described this time as one of “terribleheadaches and bitter tears,” a dark period so grim that he began to question thevalue of his education and knowledge. But despite his heartbreak, he continuedto expand on his designs for an alternating current system of generators,motors, and transformers, but lacked the money to build prototypes and apply forpatents.Word slowly spread among Manhattan’s elite that a man of incomparable genius wasdigging ditches to survive. Sensing an opportunity, a band of wealthy investorseventually approached Tesla to develop an improved system of arc lighting.Although it wasn’t the ideal opportunity for Tesla, it beat shoveling dirt.Plus, the group was willing to finance the Tesla Electric Company, so Teslaagreed. As the proud owner of a new company, he immersed himself in the ventureand developed a unique arc lamp of beautiful design and efficiency.Once the company became profitable, Tesla realized that he had been swindled.The vast majority of the earnings were going to the investors, and when he triedto interest them in financing his alternating current motor, they not onlyrejected his ideas but also ejected him from the company. Tesla was againdejected, unemployed, and broke. But his luck was about to change.Two men approached Tesla—Alfred Brown, director of Western Union, and CharlesPeck, a New York City attorney—in 1887 to learn more about his alternatingcurrent theories and designs. Tesla passionately described how the entire systemwould work, from generation to transmission. The men were impressed and agreedto invest in the project. They set up Tesla with a small laboratory close toEdison’s office, where he quickly developed all the necessary components for thesystem.“The motors I built there,” Tesla later said, “were exactly as I imagined them.I made no attempt to improve the design, but merely reproduced the pictures asthey appeared to my vision and the operation was always as expected.”In November 1887, Tesla filed for seven U.S. Patents for his inventions, whichwere so original that they were issued without challenge. These patentscomprised a complete system of generators, transformers, transmission lines,motors, and lighting. They would become the most valuable patents since thetelephone. In accordance with their agreement, Tesla split the ownership of thepatents on a fifty-fifty basis with his investors.Tesla had won the battle to produce his revolutionary alternating currentmotors, but the war was far from over.Word of the extraordinary patents reached the academic world. Tesla was sooninvited to lecture before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Hispresentations were lauded as visionary, breakthrough, and incredibly practical.Engineers around the world were abuzz, and this caught the attention of businessmagnate George Westinghouse, the inventor of railroad air brakes. He had a dreamof providing electricity throughout the entire United States, and he believedthat alternating current was the future of electrical generation andlong-distance transmission.Westinghouse visited Tesla’s lab and made an offer for his patents: $25,000 incash, $50,000 in stock in his company, and a royalty of $2.50 per horsepower ofalternating current motors sold. The terms were more than acceptable—if hismotors were going to be as successful as he and Westinghouse envisioned, theroyalties alone would make him one of the richest men in the world.Tesla happily accepted, spent half of his cash payment to construct a new lab,and oversaw the building and installation of alternating current systems acrossthe country. He also immediately began research into what he termed “radiantenergy.” His studies led him to discover what we now know as X-rays, and how touse them to produce radiographs. He didn’t make his discoveries widely known,however, which is why they would later be attributed to German physicistWillhelm Rontgen. X-rays were the first of several groundbreaking discoveries ofTesla’s that would wind up misattributed to others.Tesla was never one to chase recognition—he was after the pure thrill ofdiscovery and creation. His imagination was a factory with unlimited resources,and the world an exciting playground with unlimited possibilities. He wasexcited to see men like Rontgen pioneer new fields of understanding, and washappy that his work contributed to the rise of other great men.With Tesla’s electrical revolution poised to redefine the world of industrialdevelopment, Edison and Morgan launched a full-scale propaganda assault againstalternating current. Edison knew that direct current would have to stamp outalternating current to survive. More personally, he was heavily invested bothfinancially and emotionally in his direct current network of generators anddistribution lines.Edison declared publicly that alternating current delivered to a home would killa customer within six months. Leaflets about the dangers of alternating currentwere distributed. Lobbying efforts were made in New York to limit levels ofelectricity to 800 volts “as a matter of public safety,” which wouldconveniently make long-distance alternating current transmission impossible.Edison’s efforts then took a turn for the grisly. He began holding weekenddemonstrations of the hazards of Tesla’s work by electrocuting animals foundroaming the streets. He directed two technicians to do the same, including theexecution of cattle and horses. The morbid campaign climaxed in 1890 withEdison’s involvement in the use of a Westinghouse generator to execute aconvicted ax-murderer. The voltage to kill had been misjudged, leaving thecriminal badly injured, and the process had to be repeated. A journalistdescribed the event as an “awful spectacle, far worse than hanging.” Thetorturous method of execution was dubbed “Westinghousing,” and Morgan and Edisontried to popularize the term in the media.Disgusted by Edison’s shameless cruelty and dishonesty, Tesla began performingregular exhibitions of his technology in his laboratory in which he lightedlamps by allowing alternating current electricity to flow through his body.Public opinion swung to and fro, unsure of whom to believe.In this we can see the necessity of being willing to fight for your creations.Morgan and Edison weren’t satisfied with trying to ruin Tesla throughcapitalistic competition—they were resorting to outright depravity anddishonesty. Imagine the pressure Tesla faced: both the world’s most powerfulfinancier—one of the last enemies you’d want—and the world’s greatest inventorwere trying to draw a bead on him and pull the trigger. Most men would’vequietly resigned, or begged for scraps, but not Tesla.Ultimately, no amount of opposition could stifle Tesla’s creative powers.Enthused by his discoveries with X-rays, he devoted his energies to the realm ofhigh-frequency electricity. Two decades earlier, James Clerk Maxwell had provenmathematically that light was electromagnetic radiation—electricity that wasvibrating at an extremely high frequency. In 1888, Heinrich Hertz had confirmedthat an electric spark emits electromagnetic waves. Tesla knew that thisunexplored territory would yield astounding inventions—lights could glowbrighter, energy could be transmitted more efficiently and even pass through thebody harmlessly.The first milestone in this new research was Tesla’s invention of what becameknown as the “Tesla coil.” It was a device that took normalsixty-cycle-per-second alternating current electricity and stepped it up to anultra-high frequency of hundreds-of-thousands of cycles per second, andextremely high voltages. Tesla used his coil to invent the firsthigh-efficiency, high-frequency fluorescent lamp. This discovery pales incomparison to what he uncovered next, however.In 1891, in his New York City lab, Tesla proved that energy could be transmittedthrough the air by wirelessly lighting lamps. This discovery fascinated Tesla,sparking his lifelong obsession with wireless energy. He immediately envisioneda network of transmission stations that would provide free, wireless energy tonot only the United States, but the world.His coils helped him discover yet another phenomenon that would change theworld: radio waves. When Tesla tuned two coils to resonate at the samefrequency, he found that he could send and receive signals. He had accidentallybuilt the first radio transmitter and made the first transmissions, methods hewould patent within two years.Tesla’s continued research in the field of ultra-high-frequency energy led himto conclude that it was only a matter of time until science would discover averitable source of inexhaustible, free energy—a way to attach machinery to “thevery wheelwork of nature.”While Tesla had begun envisioning the dawn of an electrical era of unimaginablesophistication, he and Westinghouse still had to prove that alternating currentwas a worthy heir to direct current’s throne. The “War of the Currents” was at afever pitch. Edison’s gruesome stunts and vigorous propaganda campaign weredriving wave after wave of negative press, but alternating current won anopportunity to once and for all prove its value.The Westinghouse Corporation won a bid for illuminating the 1893 Chicago World’sFair, which was to be the first all-electric fair in history. The fair was alsoto be a celebration of the 400-year anniversary of Columbus’ discovery ofAmerica. Because of the efficiency of Tesla’s inventions, Westinghouse’sproposal was half of what Edison’s newly formed General Electric companyrequired for the job. Edison was furious that he lost the bid, and forbid theuse of his light bulbs in the fair. Westinghouse would use Tesla’s fluorescentbulbs instead, and Tesla even had the idea to bend the glass tubes and thusspell the names of famous scientists. Thus, the world’s first neon signs.On the evening of May 1, 1893, over 27 million people anxiously awaited to seethe future of electricity. When President Grover Cleveland pushed a button, over100,000 lamps, wired to 12 new thousand-horsepower alternating currentgenerators, turned night to day. Attendees looked on in awe, dubbing the wonderthe “City of Light.”During the fair, Tesla amazed the millions of fairgoers by allowing electricityto flow through his body to illuminate light bulbs. He also used his coils toshoot large, harmless lightning bolts into the crowd, frightening and delightingthe audience. He even demonstrated wireless energy by lighting lamps that had nowires.Within a week, the entire nation was raving about alternating current as thefuture of electricity. The fair was a debilitating blow to Edison’s directcurrent, and foreshadowed the coup de grace in the War of the Currents.Westinghouse was contacted late in 1893 by the Niagara Falls Commission, whichhad been charged with developing a power plant that would harness the force ofthe falls. The commission had solicited and rejected proposals from around theworld, reviewing schemes that ranged from using pneumatic pressure toconstructing bizarre devices of ropes, springs, and pulleys. Lord Kelvin, thefamous British physicist, headed the commission and, after inspecting Tesla’swork, was certain that the falls needed to produce alternating currentelectricity.It was a dream project for Tesla, and Westinghouse was awarded the contract.Construction began immediately, and Tesla would oversee it. Progress was slow.The project was perilous and fraught with setbacks, doubts, and financialcrises, despite having the backing of opulent financiers like J.P. Morgan, LordRothschild, John Jacob Astor, and W.K. Vanderbilt. After five years, the ventureapproached completion, but the investors were less than optimistic that theunproven and expensive machines would work. Tesla, however, assured them thatthey would work just as they did in his mind.A year later, the Niagara power plant was ready for operation. When the switchwas thrown, all worries and anxieties melted. The first power reached Buffalo atmidnight November 16, 1896, nearly 22 miles away. Plans were immediately set inmotion to power all of New York City with the station. Tesla was praisedworldwide as a hero, and was referred to as the “Wizard of the West.”Morgan, who controlled Edison’s direct current patents, was now fully convincedthat alternating current had defeated Edison’s work. He approached Westinghouseto strike a deal. Morgan didn’t care what kind of electricity was used in theworld, as long as he controlled it.One of Morgan’s managers, Charles Coffin, gloated to Westinghouse about howeasily Morgan had established Edison’s monopoly by bribing local politicians andinstalling systems that are too expensive to change. The same could be done forWestinghouse and alternating current, Coffin claimed. Westinghouse rebuffedMorgan’s offers and made it clear that their styles of business weren’tcompatible.Morgan retaliated with a strategy that would become one of his hallmarks. Hespread rumors to Wall Street that Westinghouse’s company was financiallyunstable, which dissuaded investors from giving Westinghouse the capital that heneeded to expand the production and installation of his alternating currentgenerators. Morgan then began an attack through stock manipulation, and moved togain control of The Westinghouse Corporation, and thus Tesla’s patents.By the end of 1897, Westinghouse was nearly bankrupt, and it looked as thoughMorgan would usurp everything that Tesla and Westinghouse had built together.Westinghouse owed Tesla over $1 million in royalties, an amount that grew daily.When Westinghouse described to Tesla the desperate situation, Tesla replied withthe following:“Mr. Westinghouse, you have been my friend, you believed in me when others hadno faith; you were brave enough to go ahead when others lacked courage; yousupported me when even your own engineers lacked vision. ... Here is yourcontract, and here is my contract. I will tear them both to pieces, and you willno longer have any troubles from my royalties.”In time, these royalties would’ve made Tesla the world’s first billionaire.Instead, they enabled Westinghouse to save his company. Tesla’s selflessness wasa testament not only to his generosity and goodwill, but his belief in hisability to continue to create his future. He was certain that his best workstill lay ahead of him, and that he would soon invent machines that would dwarfeverything that he had accomplished thus far.This is the beauty of imagination. An unexpected dead end in one journey ismerely an opportunity to set a new course for another. Losing what we have canonly do us real harm when we feel we can’t create it, or something equallyvaluable or compelling, again, and that ability resides squarely in ourimagination.“There is something within me that might be illusion as it is often the casewith young delighted people, but if I would be fortunate to achieve some of myideals, it would be on the behalf of the whole of humanity,” Tesla wrote.Tesla’s imagination inspired him to focus a large portion of his efforts onradio, high-frequency electricity, and radiation. He formulated principles thatled to the discovery of cosmic rays, and invented an “electric igniter,” orspark plug, for internal combustion engines.In 1898, Tesla announced his latest invention: a way to remotely controlmachines with radio technology. Skepticism was widely expressed and quicklydiffused thanks to his Madison Square Garden demonstration of remotely driving asmall metal boat through an indoor pond. Many spectators believed that he wassomehow controlling the boat with his mind.The brand new use of radio technology could be used for many things, Tesla said.He envisioned one or several operators directing scores of vessels or machinesthrough radio transmitters and receivers tuned to different frequencies. When aNew York Times writer suggested that Tesla’s discovery could be used in war tocreate a remote-controlled torpedo, Tesla quickly refuted him, “You do not seethere a wireless torpedo, you see there the first of a race of robots,mechanical men which will do the laborious work of the human race.”In his new Manhattan lab, funded meagerly by friends, Tesla’s wondrousimagination led him to research the resonant frequencies of the earth. Hemistakenly caused an earthquake that engulfed the surrounding city blocks,breaking windows and shaking the plaster off of the walls. He announced that hehad discovered how to turn the earth into a giant tuning fork, and that, intheory, the principles could shatter the Empire State Building or even possiblycause the earth to “split open like an apple.”Tesla then suspected that the upper atmosphere of the planet could be used totransmit electrical power great distances due to thinner, more conductive air.He decided that to fully explore these possibilities, he would need to establisha lab in relative seclusion so as to not endanger neighboring buildings andpeople.With money from his friend and patent lawyer, Leonard Curtis, and magnate JohnJacob Astor, Tesla and several assistants moved to Colorado Springs and beganbuilding a new experimental research station. He told local reporters that heintended to send a radio signal to Paris, but provided no details.While his lab was under construction, Tesla studied the phenomenon of lightning,and made what he considered his most important discovery to date. He found thatthe earth was “literally alive with electrical vibrations,” and that the entireplanet can be “thrown into vibration like a tuning fork.” Tesla was absolutelycertain that this phenomenon could be used to transmit unlimited electricalpower and telecommunication signals anywhere in the world with virtually nosignal loss or degradation.“When the great truth accidentally revealed and experimentally confirmed isfully recognized, that this planet, with all its appalling immensity, is toelectric currents virtually no more than a small metal ball and that by thisfact many possibilities, each baffling imagination and of incalculableconsequence, are rendered absolutely sure of accomplishment,” he wrote.Once completed, his new lab’s most prominent feature was a wooden tower thatstood over 80 feet tall and supported a 142-foot metal mast that was capped by alarge copper ball. Inside the tower was the world’s largest Tesla Coil, whichwas to be used to send powerful electrical surges into the earth.To further test his theory of the conductivity of the earth, Tesla needed tocreate electrical effects on the scale of lightning. The result was the creationof the world’s largest man-made lightning bolts, which shot out from his towerover 100 feet into the air, and which blew out the generator of the local powercompany. The experiment was a resounding success for Tesla; his lightning“flashed a current around the globe,” proving that he could indeed deliver powerto any point on the surface of the planet.For the next nine months, Tesla conducted a wide variety of experiments atColorado Springs. He wirelessly lit over 200 lamps from a distance of over 25miles, proving that electricity could be transmitted great distances through theair. Through the transmission of ultra-low-frequency signals through the spacebetween the surface of the earth and the ionosphere, he calculated that theresonant frequency of this area was approximately eight hertz—a discovery thatwas dismissed in his time but confirmed nearly 50 years later. His researchindicated that if he could send a charged beam of electricity about 50 milesinto the sky—into the ionosphere—that it could be carried around the world anddrawn upon for power.While working late one night, Tesla noticed that his powerful radio receiver waspicking up a strange, rhythmic signal for which he had no explanation. One thingwas certain: the pulses were not of natural origin. He concluded that they mustbe communications from the stars. When he revealed this incident, he was widelyridiculed for suggesting such “nonsense.”After Tesla left Colorado Springs in January 1900 to return to New York City, hewrote a sensational article for Century Magazine in which he eagerly describedhis plans for a future where we could tap the sun’s energy, control the weatherwith electricity, end war with machines that would make it an impossibility,wirelessly transmit power and radio signals around the entire globe, engage ininterplanetary communications, and even construct robotic “automatons” thatwould conduct themselves independent of operators. To many readers, this visionwas almost incomprehensible, but Tesla was fully convinced that it all—andmore—could be accomplished, and that he knew how.The article caught the attention of J.P. Morgan, who called on Tesla. Tesla metwith Morgan and explained that he could build a “world system” of wirelesscommunications to relay telephone signals, news, private messages, securemilitary communications, and even pictures to any point in the world. “Whenwireless is fully applied the earth will be converted into a huge brain, capableof response in every one of its parts,” Tesla promised.Morgan offered to fund the construction of the power plant and transmissiontower necessary to pursue Tesla’s fantastical claims. One would think that Teslawould balk at any offerings of Morgan’s as he clearly couldn’t be trusted—he wasone of the driving forces behind the propaganda used against Tesla in the War ofthe Currents. And just three years earlier, Morgan maneuvered to stealWestinghouse’s company, costing Tesla his lucrative royalty agreement.Nevertheless, Tesla chose to partner with Morgan, a decision that would prove tobe the biggest mistake of his life.Tesla calculated that he would need about $1 million to construct the powerstation and transmission equipment. Morgan offered $150,000 instead and, inexchange, wanted 51% ownership in all of Tesla’s existing and future patents andinventions relating to both electric lighting and wireless telegraphy ortelephony. Tesla accepted Morgan’s hard-fisted terms and went to workimmediately.Tesla acquired 200 acres on the cliffs of Long Island Sound and, in December1901, began construction on the project. The most prominent feature of theinstallation would be a 187-foot tower capped by a 55-ton steel sphere housing amassive Tesla Coil. Beneath the tower was to be a shaft that would plunge 120feet into the ground. Sixteen iron rods would be driven over 300 feet deeper forsending electrical currents deep into the earth. “It is necessary for themachine to get a grip of the earth, otherwise it cannot shake the earth,” Teslasaid. “It has to have a grip ... so that the whole of this globe can quiver.”Construction of the Wardenclyffe Tower, as it became known, was slow andexpensive. Delays in receiving equipment plagued Tesla due to the complicatedand unusual nature of his designs. In 1903, the tower structure was nearlycomplete, and the transmitter was operational. As testing began, residents inthe area reported seeing “all sorts of lightning” flashing from the tower’spoles, filling the air with “blinding streaks of electricity which seemed toshoot off into the darkness on some mysterious errand.”“As soon as it is completed, it will be possible for a business man in New Yorkto dictate instructions, and have them instantly appear in type at his office inLondon or elsewhere,” Tesla explained in an interview. “He will be able to callup, from his desk, and talk to any telephone subscriber on the globe, withoutany change whatever in the existing equipment. An inexpensive instrument, notbigger than a watch, will enable its bearer to hear anywhere, on sea or land,music or song, the speech of a political leader, the address of an eminent manof science, or the sermon of an eloquent clergyman, delivered in some otherplace, however distant. In the same manner any picture, character, drawing, orprint can be transferred from one to another place. Millions of such instrumentscan be operated from but one plant of this kind. More important than all ofthis, however, will be the transmission of power, without wires, which will beshown on a scale large enough to carry conviction.”Last-minute design changes were required, however, necessitating more money.Tesla had already obtained a second loan from Morgan, and when those funds ranout, he again approached the financier for additional capital. In an attempt toconvince the powerful Morgan to invest another large sum, Tesla explained thatthe tower could be used for more than transmitting radio signals—it could beused to saturate the entire globe with electricity harmless to living things sothat everyone could obtain usable power by simply sticking wires in the soil.Morgan considered Tesla’s words carefully and coldly replied, “If anyone candraw on the power, where do we put the meter?” He refused Tesla’s pleadings formore money, forcing Tesla to use his own funds, which he knew to be insufficientto complete the project. Undaunted, Tesla approached other potential investors,including John Jacob Astor, but nobody was interested in picking up a projectabandoned, and now condemned, by the most powerful man in America. Despite hiscontinued efforts, Tesla watched in horror as his Wardenclyffe dream began tofade.Only months later, in 1904, the U.S. Patent Office stripped Tesla of his radiopatents and awarded them to the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi, instead.Marconi had used radio technology pioneered by Tesla 11 years earlier totransmit the letter “s” in morse code over 2,000 miles, which gave him no claimto the patents, of course. What did give him claim, though? He had the financialbacking of Morgan, Edison, and steel baron Andrew Carnegie, all of whom heldsway in every level of government.By 1905, Tesla ran out of money and was forced to lay off the Wardenclyffeworkers and shut down the facility. Newspapers decried it as his “million dollarfolly,” to which Tesla responded, “It is a simple feat of scientific electricalengineering, only expensive ... blind, faint-hearted doubting world.”His malaise couldn’t snuff his imagination and love of his work, however. Herefocused his efforts on commercially viable machinery and—in 1906, on his 50thbirthday—presented a 200-horsepower bladeless turbine engine to the world. Hewas also contracted by the Waltham Watch Company to build the world’s first andonly air-friction speedometer, which he patented.Marconi was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1911 for his “achievements” in radio, andwas hailed as the “father of radio.” Tesla was infuriated and, in 1915, suedMarconi for infringement on his patents. He didn’t have the money to take on theflush Marconi, however, and the suit was dismissed. In the same year, it wasannounced that Tesla and Edison were potential laureates to share the NobelPrize of 1915. Both men refused to accept the award together, or separately ifthe other were to receive it first.A year later, Tesla was forced to declare bankruptcy due to back taxes owed,inciting the media to disparage him as a penniless wizard. Humiliated anddefeated, Tesla began to spend more time visiting the New York City parks,rescuing injured pigeons and nursing them back to health in his hotel room atthe Hotel New Yorker, where he lived. This fueled rumors that he had lost hismind, and that nothing more would come from his extraordinary genius. They werewrong.The New York Herald Tribune ran a story on October 15, 1911 called “Tesla’s NewMonarch of Machines.” In it, Tesla proclaimed that he was working on a flyingmachine that “will have neither wings or propellers” or any on-board source offuel, and that would resemble a gas stove in shape. Using the gyroscopic actionof an engine that Tesla had built, and assisted by devices that he was “notprepared to talk about,” the machine would be able to “move through the air inany direction with perfect safety, higher speeds than have yet been reached,regardless of weather and oblivious of ‘holes’ in the air.” Further, it would beable to “remain absolutely stationary in the air, even in a wind, for greatlength of time.”Allis Chalmers, an American manufacturing company, and the railway and lightingdivision of the Westinghouse Company contracted Tesla to build his flyingmachine, but the project never began for unknown reasons.After the outbreak of World War I, in 1917, the U.S. government was looking fora way to detect German U-boats and put Edison in charge of finding a workablemethod. It was Tesla, however, that proposed the use of radio waves to detectthe ships—the first description of radar. Edison rejected the idea as ludicrous,and the world had to wait nearly two decades before Emile Girardeau woulddevelop an obstacle-locating radio device “conceived according to the principlesstated by Tesla,” as he put it.Tesla spent the 1920s working as an engineering consultant, regularly findinghimself at odds with his employers due to the “impractical nature” of his plansand designs. In 1928, at the age of 72, he received his last patent, “ApparatusFor Aerial Transportation.” This was an ingeniously designed flying machine thatwas a hybrid of a helicopter and airplane. The vehicle would weigh 800 pounds,ascend vertically, and then rotate its engines to fly like an airplane. This wasthe predecessor of what we now know as the tiltrotor, or VSTOL (Vertical ShortTakeoff and Landing) plane. Unfortunately, Tesla lacked the funds to build aprototype.TIME Magazine featured Tesla on its cover for his 75th birthday, in 1931, andEinstein praised him as “an eminent pioneer in the realm of high frequencycurrents.” Later that year, Tesla announced that he was on the verge ofdiscovering an entirely new source of energy, and when the press asked him todescribe it, his reply was, “The idea first came upon me as a tremendousshock... I can only say at this time that it will come from an entirely new andunsuspected source.”The following year, the Pierce-Arrow automobile manufacturer and GeorgeWestinghouse commissioned Tesla to develop an electric motor to power a car. Themotor he built measured a mere 40 inches long and 30 inches across, and producedabout 80 horsepower. Under the hood was the engine: a small, 12-volt storagebattery and two thick wires that went from the motor to the dashboard.Tesla connected the wires to a small black box, which he had built the weekbefore with components he bought from a local radio shop. “We now have power,”he said. This mysterious device was used to rigorously test the car for eightdays, reaching speeds of 90 mph. He let nobody inspect the box, and crypticallysaid that it taps into a “mysterious radiation which comes out of the aether,”and that the energy is available in “limitless quantities.” The public respondedsuperstitiously with charges of “black magic” and alliances with sinister forcesof the universe. Affronted, he took his black box back with him to New York Cityand spoke nothing further of it.Meanwhile, Europe was again marching toward war. Tesla had long dreamed of a wayto make war technologically impossible. On July, 11 1934, the New York Times rana front-page headline that read, “TESLA, AT 78, BARES NEW ‘DEATH BEAM,’” anddescribed a new “teleforce” invention that would send “concentrated beams ofparticles through the free air, of such tremendous energy that they will bringdown a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 250 miles...” Tesla saidthat war would be unfeasible when every country had his “invisible Chinesewall.”The announcement generated considerable controversy, and Tesla was widelycriticized as a “mad scientist” whose sanity was slipping. Undaunted, heapproached J.P. Morgan Jr. in search of funding for a prototype, butunsurprisingly, Morgan Jr. wasn’t interested. Rumors spread that Tesla hadinterested the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Neville Chamberlain, but thisprospect evaporated when Chamberlain resigned from his position.Frustrated by the lack of interest in his “super weapon to end all war,” Teslasent detailed schematics to a number of Allied nations, including the UnitedStates, Canada, England, France, and the Soviet Union. None were willing to makethe investment required to build the device, but two years later, one stage ofthe plan was tested by the USSR. They sent Tesla a check for $25,000, gavelittle details of their experiment, and communicated nothing further.Tesla continued to work diligently, and in 1937, stated to the press that he hadcompleted a “dynamic theory of gravity,” and that he would hope to soon give itto the world. It would never be published. He also criticized Einstein’s theoryof relativity, calling it a “magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates,dazzles, and makes people blind to the underlying errors.”On January 5, 1943, Tesla placed a small “do not disturb” sign on his door inthe New Yorker Hotel. Two days later, the sign remained. The maid entered tofind him dead in his bed. He was 86 years old. Despite receiving over 800patents in his lifetime, and quite literally inventing the twentieth century, hedied penniless and alone. A medical examination determined a blood clot in hisheart was responsible for the death, and that there were no suspiciouscircumstances.When his cousin, Sava Kosanovic, arrived at his room the next morning, Tesla’sbody was already gone as were his effects. Papers and notebooks were missing,including a treasured black notebook that contained hundreds of pages oftechnical research notes. Two days later, the U.S. Office of Alien Propertyseized all of Tesla’s possessions, and his papers were declared top secret bythe War Department due to the nature of the inventions and patents.One year later, nearly three decades after Tesla began the fight, the U.S.Supreme Court confirmed that Marconi’s radio patents indeed infringed on Tesla’sand therefore declared Tesla as the true “father of radio.”- - -Einstein said that “imagination is more important than knowledge,” because“knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imaginationembraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.”All great geniuses are incredibly creative in their own ways. They’re able totake what is known, dream of new possibilities, and bring them into the world.Every mathematical enigma solved, every masterful symphony composed, everyrevolutionary machine invented, every brilliant philosophy penned, every greatcorporation built...they all sprang from a person with an extraordinaryimagination.Marcus Aurelius once said that a person’s life is “dyed with the color of hisimagination.” Your journey to greatness certainly will be too. Stop and thinkfor a second the frontiers that lie ahead for our species. The Earth has beenthoroughly conquered. The once radical philosophies of equality, tolerance, andindividualism are embraced by much of the civilized world. The secrets of theatom have given us the ability to extinguish every living thing on the planet.What is next? We look to the imagination of geniuses for the answers.What is imagination, though? Michelangelo said he saw angels in the marble andcarved until he set them free. Most of us regard creativity in the same way weregard that statement—as a mysterious gift that can’t be explained orcultivated. But we’re wrong. Like genius itself, creativity is a process, not aprovidence.THE SECRET TO CREATIVITYDylan’s Like a Rolling Stone. Shakespeare’s Hamlet. Bell’s telephone.Pythagoras’ theorem.How did they come up with such unique, profound ideas? Well, there’s an answer,and it’s probably not what you think.Steve Jobs said creativity is “just connecting things.”Salvador Dali said “those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.”Picasso said “good artists copy but great artists steal.”Mark Twain said “all ideas are second-hand, consciously and unconsciously drawnfrom a million outside sources.”No magnificent product of the imagination—whether a machine, painting, orphilosophy—was created in a complete vacuum. The invention of the telegraph tookthe efforts of a thousand, but the last man, who added that final inspiredtouch, got the credit.When you start viewing creativity as a process of combination, and imaginationas the ability to connect, stretch, and merge things in new ways, creativebrilliance becomes less mystifying. A creative genius is just better atconnecting the dots than others are.That’s why the coffee house in the Age of Enlightenment and the Parisian salonsof modernism were such engines of creativity; they were spaces where many peoplefrom many different backgrounds and areas of expertise came to swap, join, andborrow many different ideas.Don’t confuse creativity and imagination with “thinking” either. Ray Bradburysaid that thinking is the enemy of creativity because it’s self-conscious. Whenyou think you sit calmly and try to reason through something in a structured,logical way. Creativity dances to a different tune. Once you flip that switch,things get a bit chaotic. Ideas start buzzing. Images start popping into yourhead. Fragments of all kinds of data find their way into orbit. We’re pulled inone direction, then suddenly our instincts send us flying in another. Materialcollides and fuses, disappears and reappears. This chaos is essential to thecreative process. A breakthrough occurs when pieces happen to come together inunique and harmonic ways.“Our first endeavors are purely instinctive prompting of an imagination vividand undisciplined,” Tesla wrote. “As we grow older reason asserts itself and webecome more and more systematic and designing. But those early impulses, thoughnot immediately productive, are of the greatest moment and may shape our verydestinies.”There’s a catch to “combinatorial creativity,” though. Before you can connectdots, you need to have dots to connect. The more material you’re exposed to inthe world, the more grist you’ll have for your imagination mill. Tesla fullyimmersed himself in the world of electricity. He read hundreds of books. Heconducted thousands of experiments and took copious notes. The more varied yourknowledge and experiences are, the more likely you are to be able to create newassociations and fresh ideas.Your mind has an incredible ability to cross-pollinate—that is, to connectdisparate things to solve problems in unique ways or envision new creations.Einstein attributed many of his physics breakthroughs to his violin breaks,which he believed helped him connect ideas in very different ways.This brings us back to the beginning of the genius code: curiosity. It’s anessential part of becoming more creative. Expand your interests in life. Seekout new, interesting experiences, no matter how mundane or inconsequential theymight seem to others. Read books, watch documentaries, and discuss your ideaswith others. No subject, no matter how specialized or esoteric, is off limits.You never know where your imagination will find pieces for its puzzles.“The air is full of ideas,” Henry Ford said. “They are knocking you in the headall the time. You only have to know what you want, then forget it, and go aboutyour business. Suddenly, the idea will come through. It was there all the time.”By exposing yourself to an abundant variety of ideas, facts, art, and stories,and by pulling from your vast collection in many different ways—by entertainingany idea no matter how seemingly absurd—you can bring your imagination to life.And when you do, there’s no telling what new things you can bring into the worldand how it will change. Or, as Tesla put it, “A single ray of light from adistant star falling upon the eye of a tyrant in bygone times may have alteredthe course of his life, may have changed the destiny of nations, may havetransformed the surface of the globe; so intricate, so inconceivably complex arethe processes in Nature.”It takes curiosity to find your call to adventure, it takes courage to ventureinto the unknown, and it takes imagination to create your path. And to, likeTesla did, create it exactly as you envision it, no matter how much work ittakes, or how many people try to stop you.What ends will you work toward on your journey, and why? Where will you divergefrom the trails laid by people before you, and where will you go instead? Howwill you tackle problems faced by your predecessors, and what will you do thatthey didn’t? When will your eureka moments strike?A genius answers those questions audaciously and lavishly. She dares to imagineeverything and anything as possible, and carries our culture to worlds thatnever were. You can do the same."},{"pageContent":"WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEARN THE SECRETS OF MORE OF HISTORY'S GREATEST GENIUSES...ANDHOW YOU CAN JOIN THEM?If you’d like to know what some of history’s greatest thinkers and achievers canteach you about awakening your inner genius, and how to find, follow, andfulfill your journey to greatness, then you want to read Awakening Your InnerGenius today.image [../images/00001.jpeg]This book reveals things like... * How to view and deal with the world as Leonardo da Vinci did, and embrace the one trait that most accounted for his incredible genius and talents. * How Thomas Edison was able to go from a mischievous academically challenged kid to the world’s most successful inventor, and how you too can formulate and realize goals like he did. * The secret to Alexander the Great’s superhuman drive and work ethic, and how you can inspire yourself to pursue your own goals and dreams with the same vigor and tenacity. * What geniuses like Elizabeth I can teach you about the importance of individualism in your journey to greatness, and how to strengthen your will to break away from conventions, ignore the naysayers, and stay true to your vision and principles. * How Hippocrates’ epic quest to reform medicine in ancient Greece was fueled by his unparalleled judgment, and how you too can sharpen your ability to make the right decisions at the right times and thus move closer to your dreams, one good call at a time. * And much, much more...In this book you’re going to learn something most people will never know: Whatit really takes to find and follow your bliss, and how you can use the lessonspassed down to us by some of history’s greatest geniuses to systematically riseto top of your fields, activities, and endeavors.CLICK HERE TO VIEW THIS BOOK ON AMAZON.COM[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1938895150/?tag=wbpub-20]CLICK HERE TO VIEW THIS BOOK ON AMAZON.CO.UK[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Awakening-Your-Inner-Genius-ebook/dp/B00BERNZ4G/?tag=wbpub-21]"},{"pageContent":"BONUS BOOK: ALEXANDER THE GREAT: THE MACEDONIAN WHO CONQUERED THE WORLDIf you want to learn about one of history's greatest military commanders anduncover some of his secrets of drive--drive that enabled him and his small armyto first subdue all of Greece and then the mighty Persian Empire--then you wantto read this book.Alexander Small [../images/00002.jpeg]Some people like to think that geniuses are so inherently extraordinary thatthey navigate their journeys with clairvoyant ease.
