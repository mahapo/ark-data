It is an energy form which interacts with its physical environment in subtle but powerful ways and has the capacity to change the magnetic, optical, thermal, electrical, metabolic and chemical properties of its environment to varying degree. Different metaphysical disciplines, alternative health treatments and ZPE / FE / Quantum research scientists all work with the same background energy in various ways, and know it by various names*. With the advent of the internet and modern communications & data-processing capabilities, these related bodies of knowledge are converging towards a new level of understanding. *Orgone, Odic Force, Reiki, Prana, Chi, Aether, Etheric Energy, Bioenergy, Biomagnetism, Bioetheric Energy, Huna, Animal Magnetism, Soft Electrons / Negative Ion Clouds, Gravity Wave Effects, Cavity Structures Effect, Dark Matter, Zero Point Energy, Quanta, Bions, Radiesthesia, Radionics Astral Energy, 4th Dimensional Energy, Emotional Body Energy, Life Force, to name a few. Throughout this document it is referred to as orgone, bioenergy or radionics. Orgone Matrix Material is bioenergy-processing material. In simple terms, it both releases bioenergy when stimulated by conventional forms of energy, and has the capacity to change the bioenergy from one state to another. This makes it useful in a wide range of applications, including but not limited to alternative health / plant growth enhancement / radionics / traditional metaphysics. Applied Bioenergy Science is a rapidly expanding scientific field with significant and largely untapped potential for more ecologically sound, sustainable technologies and new industrial applications. Bioenergy fields interact with their environment. Some kinds of materials act to absorb and store bioenergy. This stored charge of energy manifests in subtle ways such as changes to the temperature, electromagnetic properties, or chemical composition of the material. Devices can be built which absorb and hold a high concentration of bioenergy. Other devices can be built which generate and emit bioenergy, or process bioenergy from one form to another. Devices which absorb and store this energy can be used to raise the overall energy field strength of land used for farming, resulting in healthier more robust animals and fuller, hardier, more disease-resistant plants. These kinds of devices can be simple, safe, user friendly, and have a blanket effect on the area in which they are positioned. You will learn how to make one kind of such device by the time you finish reading this book."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" - 3 - Bioenergy can produce an emotional response in many living organisms including humans. The response varies according to the specimen and the conditions. Devices which enhance the circulation of bioenergy and keep it in a healthy state tend to produce a favorable emotional response. Bioenergy fields can also carry information in the form of wave patterns. Bioenergy and magnetism are only slightly different forms of the same Aether. Aether is a cosmic omnipresent energy that is successively split down into a spectrum throughout material existence. Different ranges in the spectrum derived form Aether are manifest as matter and the electromagnetic spectrum. Bioenergy is part of the Electromagnetic spectrum. Bioenergy and the magnetic field generated by electrical current are close to each other in the spectrum and closely mutually influence each other. My research has led me to believe that Bioenergy is more magnetic than electrical in its nature and may indeed be simply a true form of what we partially conceive of as magnetism. Magnetic fields can carry information, radio waves are an example of this. When a wave carries information through a magnetic field it is called a radio transmission. When a wave carries information through a Bioenergy field it is called radionic data. Different kinds of materials and life forms are associated with different wave patterns . Devices which process this energy from one form to another can change the wave pattern. This has an impact on living organisms within the region. It demonstrates the potential to create an area hospitable to a specific living organism, or inhospitable to a pest plant, animal or fungus. Bioenergy wave patterns can have an adverse or beneficial impact on living organisms . This effect could be developed to produce a microclimate inhospitable to pests and nurturing to cultivated species, and eliminate the need for many conventional methods of dealing with pest infestations. Potentially, a virus could be selectively targeted and eradicated in populations of livestock the same as in acres of plants, with less adverse side effects. Dependency on expensive and toxic pharmaceuticals can at least be significantly reduced by more cost-effective bioenergy- based technology. Devices which both generate bioenergy and emit bioenergy wave patterns can be thought of as transmitting antennas , and the wave pattern is the signal to be transmitted. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" - 4 - Devices can be constructed to target one wave pattern with another. An example is to use the wave pattern of a pesticide for the first, and the wave pattern of a pest organism for the second. The effect produced is usually reported to be similar to exposing the pest to the actual pesticide, while having less or no impact on other life forms in the treated area compared to conventional methods. Devices could be built to cover a plot of land with the effects of a fungicide or herbicide, without having to spray the field. It is a well-established fact that Bioenergy can alter the flavor and subtle chemistry of water. This technology offers the potential to generate some or all of the effects of a chemical in a chemical process while reducing or eliminating the need for the chemical itself. Imagine that the Bioenergy wave pattern (radionic data) produced by a certain element from the periodic table is used as a signal and transmitted. To varying degree, the presence of that element appears to be “simulated” in the area covered by the effect. I theorize that a subtle projected image of an atom is produced which can, under correct circumstances, behave at least partially like a real atom in a chemical process. This application of bioenergy technology already enjoys considerable exposure in the alternative health > water treatment niche market on the internet. After reading this eBook, you will have the basic information required to make some simple bioenergy devices of your own without having to buy them from a vendor, or at least an idea of some intelligent questions to ask the vendor to determine the quality of the product. With further research into this aetherochemical effect, it is possible that many industrial dependencies on pharmaceuticals or petrochemicals could be reduced or eliminated. The potential industrial applications for this technology are virtually unlimited. Every day around the world a growing ever-growing number of people use radionics + homeopathy + ‘alternative’ energy methods for healing and other purposes. With the advent of Orgone Matrix Material, Radionics machines became much more powerful. ( http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=radionics+dowsing+psychotronic&meta =) Bioenergy fields are closely linked to weather patterns. They are affected by weather and have been repeatedly observed to manifest an effect on cloud and wind patterns by several independent researchers. Bioenergy technology also has potential applications in maintaining a microclimate . This application offers the potential to attract clouds or repel storms and has a large area of effect. Devices can be constructed to alter prevailing wind and weather patterns within a region. These are significant capabilities for responsible use, and they need to be more fully understood. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" - 5 - In nature, there are provisions for the Earth to ‘clean’ Bioenergy as it circulates . The friction of moving water over an irregular surface is one means that the planet uses to maintain its equilibrium with respect to Bioenergy fields. The discharge of energy during an electrical storm is another natural event that has the effect of creating a change to the surrounding bioenergy fields. The enhanced Bioenergy field strength in the air is something many people are able to ‘feel’ right before it rains. Here is a simple application of the ability to change bioenergy from one state to another using Orgone Matrix Material. You can build a “TB”. This is a device which effectively cleanses Bioenergy and causes it to circulate more freely. These devices have a more natural interface with the Earth than the artists conception of a large scale Bioenergy weather effect (of a kind documented now for about 70 years running without official recognition) depicted above. Insofar as their Bioenergy characteristics, TBs are safe for use by anyone, anywhere - in the opinion of the author. These both store a charge of Bioenergy and allow the energy to flow through them. The friction within them caused by metallic and organic components acts the same as the fiction of water over rock in a riverbed, and allows the Earths Bioenergy field to clear itself of accumulated toxicity and harmful wave patterns. If one of these devices is placed in an area of stagnant Bioenergy (DOR) the initial effects can be quite dramatic, though by no means is this always the case nor need it be. Sudden changes to the Bioenergy field conditions can produce sudden changes in weather such as the break of a drought or the cessation of a flood, unusual and friendly responses in wildlife, immediate cessation of long felt pains from RF toxicity-related issues, and many other effects have been observed while placing these devices in heavily congested / polluted areas. Whether the installation (often called “gifting”) is dramatic or not, the end result is that the device blends in with the Earth’s natural system of Bioenergy Fields, and their behavior is regulated by the natural cycles of the Earths Bioenergy field. This is why they do not come with a caution regarding responsible use as do many other more advanced bioenergy tools. You are not the one that controls this tool (TB / HHG), the earth’s natural energy field controls the device. The device changes its Bioenergy throughput in response to systemic conditions . It becomes part of the Earth Bioenergy “circulation system” and assists in cleaning the Bioenergy as it passes through. This effect is currently used by many persons around the world to provide a constant cleaning effect to the bioenergy fields in and around their homes. This is an important benefit, and one well within the reach of anyone on a modest income with basic handyman skills (or the desire to learn them). You do not have to be a Subtle energy experimenter to use TBs or HHGs, or to benefit from this amazingly simple piece of SOLID STATE QUANTUM FLUX TECHNOLOGY that you can make in your garage, in a few hours over the weekend. These things are easily made by anyone with basic handyman skills . A basic TB is a small (3 to 8 ounce volume), usually cylindrical or conical mass of a specific density of Orgone Matrix Material with a piece of quartz embedded in it. That’s it, in its most basic form."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" - 6 - Right now the Earth’s system of self-repair is severely taxed . TBs & similar devices offer a means of easing the strain placed on the Biosphere by environmental toxins and man made EMF pollution. The Bioenergy is constricted by the friction from the metal particles as it flows through the organic resin. The friction in the Orgone Matrix Material acts to substitute for the friction of moving water over a creek bed, and adds to the self- regulating capacity of the Earths Bioenergy System. Thousands of people from around the world have observed beneficial environmental changes to the areas where they have been using these devices. The author is most definitely among them in that respect, though perhaps not on all matters philosophical, political or religious. The fact of people from diverse backgrounds observing similar effects from these simple devices moves the concept of a Biological Animative “Life-Energy” out of the realm of mystery and myth and firmly into the zone of real and comprehensible natural law . There are several different names, grades and densities of this material, but they all have one thing in common . Orgone Matrix Materials are composed of a mixture of metallic particles suspended in an organic medium. There are a growing number of persons producing this material using the same basic concept. It is marketed under various trade names including Ergonite™ (from Wizzer’s Workshop http://www.littlemountainsmudge.com ). Ergonite, Orgonite, Orgo-tech, Orgontech, Orgonlite, Orgone Material, all various trade names / trademarks for the same material. Orgonite was the first name I heard of for the material, through a man named Karl Welz . He coined the term “Orgonite” back in the nineties and got a registered trademark for it recently. In the interim, the word Orgonite became a defacto generic name for the material, and remains the most common name for it today regardless of product names used by different manufacturers. About 3.5 years after I had started working with Orgone Matrix Material I was shown some small blue ceramic spheres about ¾” (19mm) diameter by Ian Lundgold ( http://www.mayanmajix.com/ ) . He got them from a source dating back to the 30s or 40s and they were reportedly based on the work of Wilhelm Reich http://www.wilhelmreichmuseum.org/ ). They were small cylinders of what I would call XHD (a very high density) Ergonite but the organic was clay instead of organic plastic resin. Even though I still feel that the stuff we are making now in the high densities is more potent per CC, it provides yet another confirmation of the theory behind Orgone Matrix Material. For the most part, Orgonite was first widely publicized by Karl Welz as an enhancement to Radionics systems, and then more widely publicized by Don Croft as a means of restoring natural energy & weather patterns and combating atmospheric pollution (see the section on chembusters and cloudbusters below ). In any case, these names refer to an orgone matrix material, as opposed to a layered orgone accumulator. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" - 7 - Orgone accumulators were invented by Wilhelm Reich about 70 years ago. Dr. Reich was able to condense Bioenergy to high levels within a container made of alternate layers of organic and metallic materials. He is also the man who named it “Orgone Energy” after becoming interested in it because of the emotional response and associated physiological changes it invoked in his patients. Later on, he was able to successfully treat cancer by exposing the subject to high concentrations of Bioenergy within his Orgone Accumulators (ORACs). They drew in energy from outside and concentrated it in a box. The box was made from many alternate layers of wood and metal (Organic and Metallic materials). To a degree, a piece of Orgone Matrix Material will act as an orgone accumulator in that it will attract orgone from the area around it, but with an added dimension . The added dimension is that it will process the orgone energy as it interacts with it, whereas an orgone accumulator more simply condenses orgone energy. Once it attracts and absorbs enough energy for the matrix to become active, it begins to release energy again, and the energy leaving draws more energy along behind it. From that point, whether it flows really fast or really slow, Bioenergy will keep flowing through the device more or less continually. One limitation of the ORAC is that it is highly sensitive to it’s environment , and most reputable persons using ORACs for therapy purposes take care to have the device located several miles away from any high levels of EM pollution. 60Hz electricity is known to produce wave patterns in Bioenergy that can be harmful. Today, some persons are beginning to make use of TB style devices in order to allow them to maintain a healthy Bioenergy field inside of their ORACs, and it is my hope that this trend will grow. It would allow for ORACs to be used in the average household without concern, making the ORAC a more practical means of health benefits, enhancing food or water or dealing with stress for the average person. Without a healthy local Bioenergy environment, there is the possibility that an ORAC can become ‘contaminated’ by DOR. DOR stands for Deadly Orgone Radiation, Bioenergy that is “flat-lined” by (often by over-stimulation via electrical power and communications systems) and has become stagnant. The HAARP project and other large weaponized EM / Scalar projects of similar nature, as well as “normal” side effects from electrical power and communications systems ( just go google “haarp” http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=haarp&meta = ) have created an environment where your personal Bioenergy fields and the Earth’s Bioenergy fields are under a constant onslaught. TBs can help to restore the balance of the Bioenergy fields in a localized area. One can purchase these devices from many online sources, but it is often more cost effective to make your own. You can make them for a cost of 0.50-2.00 CAD each depending on where you live (a/o MAR 2005) . There are many variations on the basic concept of suspending the metal within the organic resin . Many other substances can be added to the mixture to make it more potent, or to specialize it for different applications. Most of the people producing it wind up developing their own exact recipes, I use several different recipes for different applications. At the end of the day, the basic, fundamental ingredients of orgonite are metal particles and an organic medium to suspend them in, usually polyester “Fiberglass” resin. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" - 8 - Here’s a little about how it works : Organic substances attract Bioenergy and soak it up like a sponge, while metallic substances tend to repel it. Basically, Ergonite pulls in the Bioenergy, and while the energy is inside the device, The metal particles and organic resin both push and pull on it in all directions at the same time. This puts friction on the energy. The friction is great enough at many small points within the matrix to cause the energy to shift upwards in spectrum to Aether, so that it temporarily ceases to exist as a part of the electromagnetic spectrum. When the energy comes back out of the device, it collapses back into an organized, defined state and comes into existence as bioenergy / magnetism. Quantum physicists have discovered that subatomic particles pop in and out of existence as the shift state back and forth between the states of matter and Aether. The same effects take place with waved energies in the electromagnetic spectrum. Different forms of energy appear and disappear as they shift in spectrum back and forth between Aether and lower spectral forms of energy. In the case of a TB, because of the density, when the bioenergy appears again, it has lost the radionic data it was carrying, the wave patterns it was carrying. Those wave patterns are a large part of what makes the bioenergy “healthy” or “unhealthy” for you and other life forms. This same Aetheric flux within the Ergonite has the effect not only of changing Bioenergy from one form to another, but also the property of ‘generating’ Bioenergy when stimulated by other kinds of energy... like light, sound, physical motion, or electricity. Ergonite can change DOR (harmful Bioenergy) to OR (Healthy Bioenergy) . When energy percolates through the matrix, it is in effect reduced to its component polarities. It is then recombined and emitted. The act of being broken down into its positive and negative charges and recombined has the effect of restoring the orgone to a ‘base’ state. Unless a specific wave pattern is impressed on it within the device, it comes out of the Orgone Matrix Material as more or less undifferentiated Bioenergy. When the energy exits the material, the conditions which 'force' it to exist in an undefined state no longer exist, and so it collapses back into a defined state, and is 'colored' (impressed with a Bioenergy wave pattern) to varying degree by the exact composition of the matrix material. Many devices which employ Orgonite Matrix Material also function as Bioenergy Generators , But Ergonite does not actually generate Bioenergy, in the truest sense of the word. Ergonite, when excited with other forms of energy, both converts a portion of the energy used to excite it into bioenergy, and draws additional energy from the Aether, and releases it as Bioenergy. Having understood this, for practical intents and purposes, it can be said that Ergonite 'Generates Orgone’ on demand when excited by scalar waves, magnetic fields, heat, sound, light, electrical energy, kinetic energy, and bioenergy. TBs and HHGs - Devices that help to maintain your energy environment The HHG ('Holy hand grenade'-name inspired by Monty Python / inventor-Don Croft circa 2000, public domain) is a medium-sized device which attracts harmful Orgone energy, converts it to healthy Orgone energy, and emits it again as a flow of healthy orgone energy. This is different from other techniques and devices used up to until the early 2000s for dealing with inimical Bioenergy. Up until this point, many Orgone-based devices including the majority of those still reproduced today according to Wilhelm Reich’s specifications had the ability to block or collect harmful energy, but lacked the ability to convert it to healthy energy."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" - 9 - Ideally the HHG should be buried under a few inches of soil, or placed in a body of water . The Ergonite HHG will act to continuously clean the Orgone energy within a surprisingly large radius. There is a more pronounced effect right near the device, and many persons who consider themselves “insensitive” to subtle energy fields are able to sense the increased Bioenergy field density and flow surrounding the HHG or TB. But the effects are much broader when considered in a cumulative sense. Even if the “strong” part of the Bioenergy field from the HHG is only felt right up close to it, the EFFECTS of the HHG spread through the natural flow patterns of the background the surrounding area. The background energy field over most large cities, is analogous to a large closed room with stagnant and polluted air . In fact, that’s not really a metaphor. The air over most large human population centers IS stagnant and polluted, and so it should be no surprise that so are the Bioenergy Fields. I’m not picking on people who live in cities, my point is this: If you put a fan/filter combination in the room and wait a while, the air is cleaner than when you started, even though the fan cleans only a little air at a time. After a while, the effects add up. Every thing above about HHGs applies also to TBs. A TB (“Tower Buster” name in reference to HPRF and “Cell towers” / inventor - Don Croft circa 2000) does basically the same thing on a little bit smaller scale. A basic TB is a small (3 to 8 ounce volume, usually cylindrical or conical) mass of MHD Ergonite with a quartz piece embedded in it. A basic HHG is a little larger (8 to 32 ounce volume, usually conical or pyramidal) mass of orgonite with one large or several small (min volume ` 5 Cubic Centimeters) quartz pieces embedded in it. The original design was 5 DT Quartz Xtals, one on the vertical axis and four on the horizontal axis. The vertical xtal is near one end of the device (the small end of a cone or pyramid) , and the horizontal xtals are arranged radially, near the wide end of the device Think of them as air freshener for your aura. You can use the same basic device to enhance meditation , reduce stress or assist physical healing by strengthening and cleaning your body’s bioenergy fields. Hold it between the hands while meditating, or sit within a few feet of it. Many people now place them under their beds. Another popular use of them is in the home garden, to increase the overall vitality of plants growing within a few feet of the device. Here’s how to make them. If you don’t want to make your own, there are several online sources listed at the links page of Wizzer’s Workshop: http://www.littlemountainsmudge.com/links.htm Note: To make the right density of Orgone Matrix Material for basic HHGs and TBs you need to use metal particles that are between ~1/4” (6mm) x 1/4” (6mm) and ½” (12mm) x ½” (12mm) and have a bit of curvature. You should still be able to see a fair amount of open space (shoot for 50%) between the metal shavings when they are shaken together in a container. You can use any metal. Aluminum is fine. Gold is best. Use what is available to you. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" - 10 - Simple TB Instructions Item: Quantity per TB: - Low Quality Clear Quartz Crystal/Chunk, min volume 1 Cubic Centimeter - 1 - Polyester “Fiberglass” Resin & enough MEKP Catalyst to cure it - About 3 Ounces - Metal particles - About 3 Ounces of metal particles - Suitable container to use for a mold (small paper cup or old muffin tray) - 1 (min. volume about 3 ounces) 1 - Line the containers you will use for molds with a light coat of vegetable oil. This prevents the resin from sticking. Wipe the excess oil off with a brush or clean cloth. cover the surface of the mold evenly. 2 - Put about 1\" of metal particles in the bottom of each mold. 3. - Place the quartz crystal in each mold, using the metal shavings to hold it in position. put the crystal in the center of the mold, and if the crystal has a good point on it, most folks put the point towards what will be the top of the unit. 4. - Mix enough resin and catalyst to fill each mold level with the metal shavings you have placed in the bottom. Pour enough resin into each mold to cover the shavings. Make sure to mix the resin and catalyst well (mix for about 1 full minute) before you pour it into the molds. Allow the resin to run down into the metal shavings. Tap or shake the mold gently to release air bubbles. 5. - Add another inch or so of metal shavings to each container, enough to cover the crystal. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" - 11 - 6. - Mix and add enough catalyzed resin to cover the metal shavings in the molds. It will not harm the function of the device if some metal filings stick out the bottom, but it is a good idea to use enough resin to cover the shavings by about ¼ inch (6mm). Allow the resin to run down into the metal filings. Tap or shake the mold gently to release air bubbles. 7. - Allow the resin to cure. Keep it warm if possible, cure in a well-ventilated area, and if possible, expose the resin to sunlight while it is curing. 8. - Remove from the mold. That’s it! It may seem anticlimactic, but this is a simple, proven and reliable method of making Bioenergy-based tools to produce a beneficial change in your immediate surroundings. Just because the physics and metaphysics behind it are complex does not need that the device itself needs to be complicated. The above process can be easily modified to make an HHG as shown at left .

Links to more information on Wilhelm Reich and Orgone Energy: http://www.wilhelmreichmuseum.org/ http://www.orgone.org/ http://www.orgonelab.org/ To use one of these devices, simply place the device within the area you want to treat and leave it alone . If possible, it increases the effectiveness to put them into a body of water or bury them in the earth. It is not absolutely necessary to bury them or put them in water, but you should take it outside and let it sit on the ground for the night at least twice a year. Most folks who use them have a few in their homes, to provide a constant cleaning action for the orgone envelope in their living space. With the HHGs, it helps a bit to align the device with the magnetic field of the earth, so that one of the xtals in the base of the unit points north. People who are familiar with natural energy vortices, Curry and Hartman lines, Ley lines, and so forth have been using these devices to restore many of the earth's energy centers to healthy state. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" - 12 - Many of us have noticed beneficial changes in the emotional state and general behavior of people & animals within the effective range of such devices, whether they are aware of the devices presence or not. They are, in effect- getting the same sort of emotional healing and balancing (and in some cases the commensurate physical benefits) that one would expect from more traditional methods of life energy therapy such as reiki or dowsing or treatment with radionics or medical DOR Busters. For several years I used xtals for basic pain relief, and now most of the tools I use incorporate Ergonite in some way. Smaller versions of the TB - style device can be carried on your person in order to afford a constant cleaning action for your personal energy fields, and provide shielding against various forms of energy assault, ranging from conscious radionic attack to EM pollution. I have noticed that suspending water over the top of an HHG changes the flavor and sometimes the clarity of the water. Treatment time depends on water volume in proportion to available energy. The easiest way to do this is to make a disk-shaped TB and just set a glass food jar full of water on top of the TB. For ` 1 Quart / 1 L of water a treatment time of 3 to 4 hours ought to be enough. If you taste it and the water tastes worse than when you started, let it sit for a while longer and taste it again. It may get worse in taste temporarily during the first half of the treatment time. Generally I have been able to soften and sweeten water this way. It should taste sweet and you may experience a slight flush a few seconds after drinking the water. For this method of charging water with Bioenergy, you should not use water that was undrinkable before the charging treatment. The general consensus concerning the effects of these simple devices (Distilled from 3 years of observations and first-hand reports by 1500+ people from all over the world, communicating by a grapevine of chat rooms, message boards, and email) is distilled below in point form. ∑ Increases the body’s self-repair capacity in a physical sense ∑ Causes unresolved emotional issues to surface (sometimes in dreams) and be dealt with ∑ Causes an increase in the frequency of lucid dreaming & helps to deal with stress ∑ Increases overall vitality of plants in a small localized region ∑ Tends to stabilize or smooth out violent weather patterns in a larger localized region ∑ Decreases observable smog / chemtrails / whiteout, especially when used in conjunction with Chembusters and when devices are intelligently dispersed though a reasonably large geographical area. ∑ Occasional cleansing reactions, a short period wherein the body kicks out toxins, followed by a upswing in general vigor and energy ∑ Enhances Meditation "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" - 13 - There are several folks who find a TB to be useful in Reiki , Reflexology, Massage Therapy, Healing Hands, and other systems which effect healing by working with the human body's orgone energy fields. Unlike orgone accumulators, TBs and HHGs do not have to be carefully protected from EM pollution and DOR . Rather they convert DOR to a healthy state, so I think it is a good idea for most everyone to make at least one or two and put them near their homes. Every day, we all take a bath in more energy pollution than most folks care to think about. These devices have been repeatedly shown to have a localized beneficial effect on the life energy of almost any area. They have also been developed and adapted to many uses beyond the original purpose for them, which is to restore natural weather patterns to the environment around us by mitigating or nullifying the effects of harmful large scale electromagnetic technology. I have seen no evidence that HHGs or TBs will become saturated with DOR from prolonged exposure, but I have seen that such devices have a processing capacity, and that capacity may be exceeded. I have been able to deal with that in most cases by simply using more devices. The capacity of the device is determined by the mass of the device, (larger mass of Ergonite = more capacity) the way the internal components are assembled, and the composition of the Ergonite itself. The reason they work better when buried is that then they have a direct connection to the Bioenergy currents in the Earth and a solid electrical ground . The Bioenergy 'resistance' of air is higher than the orgone 'resistance' of earth. Therefore, when the energy flows through the HHG or TB, it can flow a little more quickly if it is buried, because it has a huge potential (the earth or the body of water) to which it is grounded. Even so, just tossing TBs into a problem area works fine in the short term. Good thing, because there are many places where burying them is impractical. If possible, toss them where they will land in water (best) or on earth, as opposed to pavement. Chembusters and Cloudbusters There is a lot of controversy on this subject now, and to be honest I consider it important to distinguish between a Croft-style Chembuster ( http://educate-yourself.org/ct/goodbyects10jan02.shtm ) and a Reich-style Cloud Buster ( http://www.orgone.org/IOOeng/cb.htm ). They are indeed different in function. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" - 14 - A Cloud Buster is a device invented by Wilhelm Reich about seventy years ago, and it uses orgone energy to influence weather patterns. It is basically an array of parallel pipes which are temporarily connected by means of rubber or other organic hoses to either an ORAC or a body of moving water. When the device is to be used it is assembled and then it is taken apart again when not in use. You need to know what you are doing to use a Cloud Buster. It relies on the circulation of orgone energy within the water bodies of the earth to process the orgone by virtue of the action of moving water over stone, this action takes place in riverbeds especially. A Chembuster is a slightly different device, which is based on the Cloud Buster in that it uses a parallel array of pipes to channel orgone energy, in order to affect the weather patterns in the area around it. The main difference between a Cloud Buster and a Chembuster are that a Chembuster has a ballast of Ergonite, while a Cloud Buster is grounded directly from the pipes to the earth, or water. And since Ergonite processes orgone energy instead of simply collecting it or moving it around, a Chembuster cleans the orgone as it passes through and tends to be controlled by the Earth’s natural Bioenergy fields the same as TBs and HHGs. You do not have to know what you are doing in order to use a chembuster, despite what some supposedly knowledgeable persons may say. Cloudbusters and Chembusters generally pull energy down from the atmosphere and channel it into the Earth . Under some conditions it is possible for both devices to work in the opposite direction and send orgone form the Earth into the atmosphere. In both cases, it is the changing orgone fields which affect weather patterns. I do not approve of novices using Reich-style Cloudbusters, but I do approve of just about anyone using Chembusters. This is because a Chembuster is a great deal more user-friendly than a Cloud Buster. A Cloud Buster, used carelessly, can cause tornadoes, imbalances in the earth's orgone fields, and torrential rains or severe droughts. It is nonetheless a very useful device, but one which requires knowledge both of meteorology and bioenergy dynamics in order to operate properly. The Chembuster, on the other hand, functions more like a 'safety release valve' between the earth and atmosphere, so that it becomes more active when there is a large unbalance in the ambient orgone fields and less active when the energy around it is in a balanced and healthy state. It is possible to further enhance the function of a Chembuster by grounding it to the earth. After experimenting with it for some time, I generally ground the orgonite base of my Chembuster instead of grounding the pipes, because if you ground the pipes, then the device will appear to work more rapidly, but what it is actually doing is dumping the excess energy into the ground rather than processing it. In my opinion, grounding the copper pipes directly is no better than a Reich style cloud buster. You can either attach a length of copper wire to the Ergonite, or just set the base into the soil a few inches.

MHD Ergonite offers just low enough orgone resistance to operate in a passive mode, but offers high enough orgone resistance to afford the 'scrubbing' action desired.

You can find more detailed information on making Ergonite at http://www.littlemountainsmudge.com/ebooks.htm If you are familiar with bioenergy and Ergonite already, you may know that exposing the Ergonite to a radionic wave pattern while the resin cures can increase the potency of the device. With MHD, this is not as important as with some other densities. For the purpose of simplicity, information on the charging / curing process is not included in this book, but is available from the link above. The fidelity of radionic data retention is much better with higher densities of Ergonite, though admittedly it can be also used to enhance the effectiveness of TBs. The reason for this decision is to underscore the point that one does not have to be a mental adept or alternative scientist to reap the benefits of these simple tools. Bioenergy Induced Micro-Crop Circle - Confirmation of subtle energy in action This was kind of an interesting thing that happened in the backyard a while ago... The same night as the 'meteor impact' of June 03 2004 near Washington state, this formation appeared in some grass in my backyard. It has the earmarks of the much larger and more well-know crop circles, such as bent but not broken nodes, grass which continues to grow, and a weaving pattern among the blades of grass which is complex enough it is difficult to photograph. The patch of grass that it appeared in is a patch of grass which I let grow instead of mowing. The pattern formed was a spiral vortex with the plants bending at the second and third nodes mostly. The spiral was interwoven in layers in the stalks of grass. It appeared in a spot where I had my chembuste r for about a year, I moved the chembuster to the other side of the yard a few months before the formation appeared. Large pic shows the way it looked when it first appeared. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" - 17 - I think that anytime an orgone field reaches sufficient strength and excitation, then there is a possibility for that field to be expressed in the plants DNA . I think that as the energy intensity in the earth's bioenergy and electromagnetic fields continues to build, more formations like this will be observed, if indeed they are not being already. Smaller pic shows some changes that appeared and some nodes. The nodes in the squared part of the formation appeared to keep bending over a period of several days. The initial spiral pattern formed overnight. Did you find this information Useful? You can make a donation by visiting www.littlemountainsmudge.com/info.htm I hope that you enjoyed this free eBook.
