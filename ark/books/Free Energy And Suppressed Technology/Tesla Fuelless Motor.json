NIKOLA T ESLA'S LATER ENE RGY GENE RATION DESIGNS Oliver Nich elson 333 North 760 East Am erican Fork, Utah 84003 USA Â© 1991 ABST RACT Ten years af ter patenting a successful m ethod fo r producing alternating cu rrent, Nikola Tesla claim ed the invention of an el ectrica l genera tor th at would not \"consum e any fuel.\" Such a generator w ould be its own prim e mover. Two of Te sla' s devices representing different stages in the developm ent of such a generator are identified. INTRODUCTION While in college Nikola Tesla claim ed it should be possible to operate an electrical m otor without sparking brushes. He was told by the professor th at such a m otor would require perpetual m otion and was therefore im pos sible. In the 1880' s he patent ed the alternating current generator, m otor, and transform er. During the 1890' s he intensively investigated other m ethods of power generation including a charged particle collector patented in 1901. W hen the New York Times in June of 1902 carried a story about an inventor w ho claim ed an electrical generator not requ irin g a prim e mover in the f orm of an external fuel supply, Tesla wrote a friend that he had already invented such a device. Fuelless electrical g eneration rais es the sam e objec tion of perpetual m otion as did the generator in use today w hen it was first proposed. Research Ni kola Tesla carried out dur ing his second creative period and the resulting devices that were the basis for his assertion of fuelless electrical generation will be ex amined. W hether Tes la's fuelless gen erato r was a \"perpe tual motion sche me\" of the sort his teacher warned him agains t, or a creative app lication of re cognized natural phenom ena will b e discussed. TESLA'S S TATEMENTS In The Brooklyn Eagle , Tesla announced, on July 10th, 1931, that \"I have harnessed the cosm ic rays and caused them to operate a m otive device.\" Later on in the sam e article he said that \"More than 25"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"years ago I began m y efforts to harness the co smic rays and I can now state that I have succeeded. \" In 1933, he m ade the sam e assertion in an article for the New York American , Nove mber 1st, under the lead in \"Device to Ha rness Cosm ic Energy Claim ed by Tesl a.\" Here he said: This new power for the driving of the world' s machinery will be derived from the energy which operates the universe, the cosm ic energy, whose central source for the earth is the sun and which is everywhere present in u nlim ited qua ntities. Dating back \"m ore than 25 years ago\" from 1933 would m ean that the device Tesla was speaking about m ust have been b uilt b efore 1 908. More p recis e inform ation is availab le th rou gh his correspond ence in th e Colum bia University Libr ary' s collection. W riting on June 10th , 1902 to his friend Robert U. Johnson, editor of Century Magazine, Tesla included a clipping from the previous day' s New Y ork Herald about a Clemente Figueras, a \"woods and forest engineer\" in Las Palm as, capital of the Canary Islands, who had invented a device for ge nerating electricity without burning fuel. W hat becam e of Figueras and hi s fuelle ss gene rator is not known, but this announcem ent in the paper prom pted Tesla, in hi s letter to Johnson, to claim he had already developed such a device and had rev ealed the underlying physical laws. IDENTIF YING THE INVENTION The device that, at first, seem s to best fit this description is found in Tesla' s patent for an \"Apparatus f or the Utilization of Radiant Energy, \" num ber 685,957, that was filed for on March 21, 1901 and granted on Novem ber 5, 1901. The concept behind the older technical language is a sim ple one. An insulated m etal pla te is put as high as possible into the air. Another m etal plate is put into the ground. A wire is run from the m etal plate to one side of a capacitor and a second wire goes from the ground plate to the othe r side of the capacitor. Then: The sun, as well as other sources of radiant ener gy, throw off m inute particles of m atter positively electrified, which, im pinging upon [the upper] plate, comm unicate continuously an electrical charge to the sam e. The opposite term inal of the conde nser being connected to ground, which m ay be considered as a vast reservoir of neg ative elec tricity, a f eeb le curr ent f lows continuo usly into the condenser and inasm uch as the part icles are ... charged to a very high potential, this charging of the condenser m ay continue, as I have actually obser ved, alm ost indefinitely, even to the point of rupturing the dielectric (1) . This seem s like a ve ry straigh tforwar d design and would seem to f ulfill his claim for having developed a fuelless generator powered by cosm ic ra ys, but in 1900 Tesla wrote what he considered his m ost importan t ar ticle in wh ich he describes a self-activati ng m achine that would draw power from the ambient m edium, a fuelless generator, th at is different from hi s Radiant Energy Device. Entitled \"The Problem of Increasing Hum an En ergy - Through the Use of the Sun,\" it was published by his friend Robert Johnson in The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine for June 1900 soon after T esla returned from Colorado Springs wh ere he had carried out an intensive series of experim ents from June 1899 until January of 1900.

He wrote that he first started thinking about de riving energy directly from the e nvironm ent when he was in Paris during 1883, but that he was unable to do m uch with the idea for seve ral years due to the commercial introdu ction of his altern ating cu rren t generators and m otors.

All the evidence ynamo as being Tesla' s fi rst design fo lectricity after being disconnected from an outside source of power. S Before going into the details of th is in g of r a ELF-SUSTAINING CURRE NT vention it would be worthwhile to have an idea of how any generator, even in theory, could be capable of producing a self-sustaining current. This has been rth-dynamo, c onveniently for this explanation, on the Faraday generator of a metal disk spinning over a bar m agnet placed at the edge of the disk. He notes, also, that the bar ire could not maintain a current for very long because the curren t indu ced in th e disk is so weak that it wou ld soon be d issipated by the resistance . would indeed yield a self-sustain ing current. W e could also make it work by spinning the disk very in p clearly explained by W alter M. Elsasser in a Scientific American article (May 1958) titled \"The Earth as a Dynam o.\" Elsasser m odels the ea magnet could be replaced by an electrom agnet which could get its power from the spinning disk by attaching one end of the el ectrom agnet' s wire to the outside of th e disk and the other end of the w to the m etal rod running thr ough the center of the disk. Elsasser then points out that an or dinary disk generator \" of the conductor [the disk].\" This conventional arrangem ent would not be an answer to \"how currents could be built up and perpetuated to m aintain the earth' s magnetic field.\" He does, though, propose three options in the dynam o model that would explain the earth' s persistent magnetism If we had a m aterial that could conduct electricity a thousand tim es better than copper, the system fast... a third way we could m ake such a dynam o se lf-sustaining ... is to in crease the size of the system : theo ry says th at the bigger w e m ake such a dynam o, t he better it will functio n. If we could build a coil-and-disk apparatus of this kind of scale of m any m iles, we would have no difficulty making the curren ts se lf-susta ining (6) . Tesla did not have a m aterial a thou s and times more conductive than copper, neither w as he able to spin a disk at the ultra-high speed s needed to produce such a current, nor did he plan on using a hat of Faraday in two m ajor ways. First, he used a m agnet that was bigger in diam eter than the disk so that the m agne t com pletely covered the disk. Second, he divided holly pass through the external circu it ... an d ... by far the greater p ortion of the curren t gen erated will n ot piece of rotating m etal several m iles in diam eter. What he did was to use energy that is usually wasted in a generator and turn it into a source of power. UNIPOLAR DYNAM O Tesla' s design varied from t the disk into sections with spiral curves radi ating out from the center to the outside edge. In the Far aday unipola r genera tor \" the curr ent,\" as Tesla no ted, \"set up will th eref ore not w appear externally...\" (7) By having the m agnet completely cover the disk, Tesla m ade use of the whole disk s urface in cu rrent gen eration instead o f only a sm all section d irectly adjacent to th e bar magnet, as happened in the Faraday device. This not only increases the amount of current gene rated,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"but, by making the current travel from the center to the outside edge, makes all of that current accessible to the external circuit. More importantly, these modificat ions on the Fa raday design eliminated one of the biggest problems in any physical system - the reaction to ev ery action. It is this reaction that works to re are disk cause the current to travel the full radius of the disk or, as in his alternative version of the generator, to make a fu ll trip around the outside edge of the disk. Because uce a entional direct current generators, the unipolar dynamo also functions as a motor if current is put into the disk while under the magnet, and this seems to be the last element that could d a generator and a motor disk are mounted in the magnetic enclosure. As the disks ga in speed, current is produced which, in turn, f eep nipolar dynamo operating after the powered start-up is speculation at this point, however two features of the generator are significant. First, when a e disk. e ore oing , riteria fo r a self-sustaining generator, the Tesla unipolar dynamo comes closest to satisfying the condition of a better electrical conductor. It is not that a new material is This t appears to be an ingenious feat of engineering that takes one of the basic principles of nature, an equal and opposite action for every action, and turns it, by the use of a novel circuit geometry, into a r eaction that is additive to the cancel out whatever effort goes into causing the original ac tion. In an electrical system if the two turns of wire wound next to each other and a current is sent thr ough the wire, the current passing through the first loop will set up a magnetic fi eld that will work against the current passing through the second loop. The spiral divisions in the the current is flowing in a large circle at the rim of the disk, the magnetic field created by the current not only does not work against the field ma gnet above the circular pl ate, as in conventional generators, but it actually reinforces the magnet. So as the disk cu ts the magnetic lin es to prod current, the current coming off of the disk strengthe ns the magnet, allowing it to produce even more current. Like conv make the device self-sustaining, th at is, capable of generating a current after being disconnecte from an outside source of moveme nt like falling water or steam. Rotation is started by, say, a motor powered by line current. Both reinforces the magnets, which cause more current to be generated. That current is, likely, first directed to the motor disk which increases the speed of the system. At a certain point the speed o the two disks is great enough that the magnetic field created by the cu rrent has the strength to k the dynamo/motor going by itself. What process might have kept the u resistive load, like a light bulb is added to the circuit, it lowers the voltage at the center of th This lower voltage at the center means that ther e is a greater difference in voltage between th center and the outside edge of the disk than th ere was before the light bulb was added. As the difference between the center and the outside incr eases, the dynamo works harder and makes m current. Second, yet more important, the dynamo takes either very little, or no energy to keep g because the current coming off the generator is doing double duty. The current makes the bulb glow but on its way from the generator to the filament in the bulb, it travels a path that adds to the momentum of the dynamo and, therefore, consum es energy at a very low rate. The process continues , it would seem, until heat losses in the filament equal the rotational energy of the generator's flywheel. In terms of Elsasser's c used, but a new geometry is applied so that the cu rrent does not create its own opposing forces. is similar, but not equivalent, to having a better conductor.

Instead of the opposite reaction slowing down the sy stem that created it, the reac adds energy to the system. Tesla, however, was not satisfied with his mechanical self-sustaining gene rator. The dynamo would provide the energy to run a s tion ingl e machine, but his vision was to light cities and in the 1900 Century magazine article he elaborated on the theory of such a machine. y that environment that has a lot of energy. In this case, energy would flow fr om the outside environment, the high energy source, ld Imagine, he suggested, an enclosed cylinder with a small hole in it near the bottom. Let us sa this cylinder, he added, contains very little energy but that it is placed in an through the small opening at the bott om of the cylinder, and into the cylinder where there is less energy. Also suppose that as the energy passing into the cylinder is converted into another form of energy as, for example, heat is converted into mechanical energy in a steam engine. If it were possible to artificially produce such a \"sink\" for the energy of the ambient medium then \"we shou be enabled to get at any poi nt of the globe a continuous supply of energy, day and night (8) .\" He continued, in the article, to elaborate on his energy pump but changed the image slightly. On the surface of the earth we are at a high energy level a nd can imagine ourselves at the botto m of a lake with the water surrounding us equal to the energy in the surrounding medium. If a \"sink\" for the of . He may be taken out of it without using any, or by using very little power (9) energy is to be created in the cylinder, it is necessa ry to replace the water that would flow into the tank with something much lighter than water. Th is could be done by pumping the water out of the cylinder, but when the water flowed back in, we would only be able to perform the same amount work with the inflowing water as we did when it was first pumped out. \"Consequently nothing would be gained in this double ope ration of first raising the water and then letting it fall down.\" Energy, though, can be converted into different forms as it passes from a higher to a lower state said, \"assume that the water, in its passage into the tank, is conv erted into something else, which .\" For example, if the w in, and yet the tank would remain entirely empty, the gase s formed escaping. We would thus produce, by n energy of the ambient medium is taken to be the water, oxygen and hydrogen making up the water are the other forms of energy into which it could change as it entered the cylinder. Corresponding to this ideal case, all the water flowing into the tank would be decomposed into oxygen and hydrogen ...and the result would be that the water would continually flo expending initially a certain amount of work to creat e a sink for...the water to flow in, a conditio enabling us to get any amount of energy without further effort (10) . Tesla recognized that no energy conversion system would be perfect, some water would always ge into the tank, but \"there will be less to pump out than flows in t n other words, less energy will be needed to maintain the initia l condition than is developed [by th e incoming water], and this is to , or , i say that some energy will be gained from the medium (11) .\" He found that this pumping could be done with a piston \"not connected to anything else, but was perfectly free to vibrate at an enormous rate (12) .\" This he was able to do with his \"mechanical oscillator,\" a steam-driven engine used for producing high frequenc y currents. The faster the pump not would work, the more efficient it would be at extracting energy from the cosmos. Research along this line culminated in the oscillator demonstrated at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. It was until much later, in the 1900 article, he revealed: \"On that occasion I exposed the principles of the mechanical oscillator, but the original purpose of this machine is explained here for the first time (13) .\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I T o i T f e e many tim es th e e the sam e size and with t was also in 1893 that esla applied for a paten t n an electrical coil s the most likely that candidate for a non- successo r of his energy Electro-m curious design because, mechanical extra ctor. his is his \"Coil f or unlike an ord orm, this one uses two wires laid ne nd of the first one connected to the beginn ing of the second one.

In the Century article Tesla com pares extracting energy fr om the environm ent to the work of oth scien tists who were, at that tim e, learning to condense atm ospheric gases into liquids. In particular he cited the work of a Dr. Karl Linde who had di scovered what Tesla descri bed as a \"self- wanting that energy was obtai nable from the m edium in the manner contemplated by m e (16) .\" What ties the Linde work with Tesla' s electrom agnet coil is that both of them used a double path for the m aterial they were w orking with.

Tesla' s intent was to condense the energy trapped between the earth and its upper atm osphere an turn it in to a n elec d to on volts.

With his prominent position in the world of scien ce at the time, it is curious why Tesla's invention was not commercialized or at leas t publicized more. Economics, not science, appear to period.

Tesla's patents for electrical generators and mo tors were granted in the late 1880's.
