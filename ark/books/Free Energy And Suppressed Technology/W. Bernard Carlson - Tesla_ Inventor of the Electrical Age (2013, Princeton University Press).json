Bernard.Tesla : inventor of the electrical age / W. Bernard Carlson. pages cmSummary: “Nikola Tesla was a major contributor to the electrical revolution thattransformed daily life at the turn of the twentieth century. His inventions,patents, and theoretical work formed the basis of modern AC electricity, andcontributed to the development of radio and television. Like his competitorThomas Edison, Tesla was one of America’s first celebrity scientists, enjoyingthe company of New York high society and dazzling the likes of Mark Twain withhis electrical demonstrations. An astute self-promoter and gifted showman, hecultivated a public image of the eccentric genius. Even at the end of his lifewhen he was living in poverty, Tesla still attracted reporters to his annualbirthday interview, regaling them with claims that he had invented aparticle-beam weapon capable of bringing down enemy aircraft. Plenty ofbiographies glamorize Tesla and his eccentricities, but until now none hascarefully examined what, how, and why he invented. In this groundbreaking book,W. Bernard Carlson demystifies the legendary inventor, placing him within thecultural and technological context of his time, and focusing on his inventionsthemselves as well as the creation and maintenance of his celebrity. Drawing onoriginal documents from Tesla’s private and public life, Carlson shows how hewas an “idealist” inventor who sought the perfect experimental realization of agreat idea or principle, and who skillfully sold his inventions to the publicthrough mythmaking and illusion. This major biography sheds new light on Tesla’svisionary approach to invention and the business strategies behind his mostimportant technological breakthroughs”—Provided by publisher.Summary: “This is a biography of one of the major 20th-century scientists,Nikola Tesla. It is interdisciplinary, containing accounts of U.S. manufacturingin the early 1900s and other contemporary cultural materials”— Provided bypublisher.Includes bibliographical references and index.ISBN 978-0-691-05776-7 (hardback : acid-free paper)1.

He had covered the mystery of Jack the Ripper inLondon, the Homestead Strike in Pittsburgh, and the first execution byelectrocution at Sing Sing. Brisbane had an eye for detail and could tell astory that would intrigue a hundred thousand readers. He would go on to edit theNew York Journal for William Randolph Hearst, help start the Spanish-AmericanWar, and define tabloid journalism.1 [029_BM029.xhtml#d232]Brisbane specialized in writing features for the World’s new Sunday edition, andhe had profiled prime ministers and popes, prizefighters and actresses. Nowpeople were telling him to do a story about an inventor, Nikola Tesla. His namewas on everyone’s lips: “Every scientist knows his work and every foolish personincluded in … New York society knows his face.” Not only would his inventions beused to generate electricity at the new plant under construction at NiagaraFalls, but Tesla had taken 250,000-volt shocks through his body to demonstratethe safety of alternating current (AC). During such demonstrations, Tesla became“a most radiant creature, with light flaming at every pore of his skin, from thetips of his fingers and from the end of every hair on his head” (Figure 0.1). Adozen reliable sources had told Brisbane that “there was not the slightest doubtabout his being a very great man.” “Our foremost electrician,” people said.“Greater than Edison.”2 [029_BM029.xhtml#d232a] Brisbane was curious. Who wasthis man? What made him tick? Could Tesla be made into a good story forthousands of readers?The reporter had heard that the Wizard frequently dined at the most fashionablerestaurant in Manhattan, Delmonico’s on Madison Square. Delmonico’s chefs hadinvented signature dishes such as Lobster Newberg, Chicken à la King, and BakedAlaska. But even more than the food, Delmonico’s was the hub of New Yorksociety, the place to see and be seen. This is where the old social aristocracy,Ward McAllister’s Four Hundred, dined alongside the nouveau riche of Wall Streetand the rising middle class. It was where balls and cotillions, poker games andstag parties, ladies’ luncheons and post-theater suppers were held. WithoutDelmonico’s, observed the New York Herald, “the whole social machinery ofentertaining would … come to a standstill.”3 [029_BM029.xhtml#d232b] Clearly,thought Brisbane, this Wizard had both ambition and style. What made him tick?image [Images/fm_01.jpg]FIGURE 0.1. “Showing the Inventor in the Effulgent Glory of Myriad Tongues ofElectric Flame After He Has Saturated Himself with Electricity.”From Arthur Brisbane, “Our Foremost Electrician,” New York World, 22 July 1894,in TC 9:44–48, on 46.Brisbane found Tesla at Delmonico’s late that summer evening, talking withCharles Delmonico, whose Swiss great-uncles had founded the restaurant in 1831.Having lived previously in Prague, Budapest, and Paris, Tesla found it easy tochat with the urbane Charley Delmonico. Most likely Tesla had put in a long dayat his downtown laboratory and had stopped by for his supper before going hometo his hotel, the Gerlach, around the corner.The reporter carefully took in the physical appearance of the Wizard:Nikola Tesla is almost the tallest, almost the thinnest and certainly the mostserious man who goes to Delmonico’s regularly.He has eyes set very far back in his head. They are rather light. I asked himhow he could have such light eyes and be a Slav. He told me that his eyes wereonce much darker, but that using his mind a great deal had made them many shadeslighter.…He is very thin, is more than six feet tall and weighs less than a hundred andforty pounds. He has very big hands. Many able men do—Lincoln is one instance.His thumbs are remarkably big, even for such big hands. They are extraordinarilybig. This is a good sign. The thumb is the intellectual part of the hand.…Nikola Tesla has a head that spreads out at the top like a fan. His head isshaped like a wedge. His chin is as pointed as an ice-pick. His mouth is toosmall. His chin, though not weak, is not strong enough.As he studied Tesla’s outward appearance, Brisbane began to assess hispsychological makeup:His face cannot be studied and judged like the faces of other men, for he is nota worker in practical fields. He lives his life up in the top of his head, whereideas are born, and up there he has plenty of room. His hair is jet black andcurly. He stoops—most men do when they have no peacock blood in them. He livesinside himself. He takes a profound interest in his own work. He has that supplyof self-love and self-confidence which usually goes with success. And he differsfrom most men who are written about and talked about in the fact that he hassomething to tell.Like other reporters, Brisbane collected the usual background facts—that Teslahad been born in 1856 to a Serbian family in Smiljan, a small mountain villageon the military frontier of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (in what is nowCroatia), that he had started inventing as a boy, and that he had studiedengineering at a school in Graz, Austria. Anxious to get ahead, Tesla hadimmigrated to America and arrived penniless in New York in 1884.It was Tesla’s meteoric rise since 1884 that made for great newspaper copy.After working briefly for Edison, Tesla had struck out on his own, set up alaboratory, and invented a new AC motor that used a rotating magnetic field.Even though Tesla tried to explain to Brisbane the principle behind the rotatingmagnetic field, the reporter had to conclude that it was “a thing which may bedescribed but not understood.” Instead, Brisbane highlighted how theentrepreneurs behind the massive hydroelectric project at Niagara had rejectedEdison’s direct current (DC) system and instead chosen Tesla’s ideas forgenerating and transmitting electric power by employing multiphase AC. Tesla’swork in power engineering was widely respected, but Brisbane might well haveadded that Tesla had lectured before distinguished scientific organizations andbeen awarded honorary degrees by Columbia and Yale. In ten short years, theinventor sitting in front of Brisbane had gone from being penniless and unknownto being America’s foremost inventor. Here was one of the great rags-to-richesstories.But what about the future, asked Brisbane, as the Wizard was only thirty-eightyears old. Ah, “the electricity of the future”—here was a topic Tesla loved todiscuss:When Mr. Tesla talks about the electrical problems upon which he is reallyworking he become[s] a most fascinating person. Not a single word that he sayscan be understood. He divides time up into billionths of seconds, and suppliespower enough from nothing to do all the work in the United States. He believesthat electricity will solve the labor problem.… It is certain, according to Mr.Tesla’s theories that the hard work of the future will be the pressing ofelectric buttons. A few centuries from now the criminal … will be sentenced topress fifteen electric buttons every day. His fellows, long since disused towork, will look upon his toil with pity and horror.Brisbane listened with rapt attention as Tesla described how he was perfectingnew electric lights using high-frequency AC to replace Edison’s incandescentlamps. “The present incandescent system, compared to the Tesla idea,” thoughtBrisbane, “is as primitive as an ox cart with two solid wooden wheels comparedto modern railroading.” The Wizard, though, was even more excited about hisideas for the wireless transmission of power and messages: “You may think me adreamer and very far gone,” he said, “if I should tell you what I really hopefor. But I can tell you that I look forward with absolute confidence to sendingmessages through the earth without any wires. I have also great hopes oftransmitting electric force in the same wave without waste. Concerning thetransmission of messages through the earth I have no hesitation in predictingsuccess.”For hours the reporter talked with the Wizard, as “all that he said wasinteresting, both the electrical things and the others.” Tesla spoke of hisSerbian background and his love of poetry. He told Brisbane that he valued hardwork but that marriage and love interfered with success. He didn’t believe inmental telepathy, or “psychical electricity,” but was fascinated by how thehuman mind works. “I talked with this Mr. Tesla of Smiljan,” wrote Brisbane,“until the feeble daylight found Mr. Delmonico’s scrub-ladies scrubbing hismarble floor.” They parted friends. Brisbane wrote a front-page story that madeTesla a household name and went on to become one of the most powerful newspapereditors in America.So what happened to the Wizard? Although he could not know it at the time, Teslawas at his zenith that summer in 1894. Over the previous ten years, he hadenjoyed a meteoric rise and was greatly admired by his fellow engineers andscientists. As the Electrical Engineer (London) proclaimed, “No man in our agehas achieved such a universal scientific reputation in a single stride as thisgifted young electrical engineer.”4 [029_BM029.xhtml#d233] Such brilliance, suchpromise; what happened?Over the following decade, 1894 to 1904, Tesla continued to invent, developing ahigh-frequency, high-voltage transformer (now known as a Tesla coil), newelectric lamps, a combination steam engine and electric generator, and a host ofother devices. Learning that Heinrich Hertz had detected invisibleelectromagnetic waves in 1885–86, Tesla was among the first to experiment withhow to use these waves to create new technology, including an amazingradio-controlled boat. Tesla’s grand dream, of course, was to transmit power andmessages through the earth, thus rendering obsolete the existing electrical,telephone, and telegraph networks. In pursuit of this dream, he builtexperimental stations in Colorado Springs and Wardenclyffe, Long Island, everconfident that his system was feasible and that millions of dollars would rollin. Although Tesla boldly predicted as early as 1899 that he would transmitmessages across the Atlantic, Guglielmo Marconi did it first in 1901, and soMarconi went into the history books as the inventor of radio. Between 1903 and1905, Tesla could no longer find backers for his inventions, he encounteredproblems with his equipment, and he ultimately suffered a nervous breakdown.Though he lived until 1943, by 1904 Tesla’s best days were behind him. AsLaurence A. Hawkins wrote in 1903, “Ten years ago, if public opinion in thiscountry had been required to name the electrician of greatest promise, theanswer would without doubt have been ‘Nikola Tesla.’ To-day his name provokes atbest a regret that so great a promise should have been unfulfilled.”5[029_BM029.xhtml#d234]In writing about Tesla, one must navigate between unfair criticism and excessiveenthusiasm. On the one hand, we can follow Hawkins’s lead and denigrate Teslafor not completing his inventions after 1894, especially his plan for wirelesspower. Surely someone so determined to pursue wireless power and challenge thestatus quo of big business and technological systems must have been either wrongor crazy. Yes, Tesla got it right with AC, but he sure got it wrong with radio,and that’s why Marconi beat him out. For me, this approach sets up a misleadingdichotomy: when inventors get it right, they are heralded as geniuses, and whenthey get it wrong, they must be insane.On the other hand, it’s easy to celebrate Tesla as a figure second only toLeonardo da Vinci in terms of technological virtuosity. Tesla has dedicated fanswho believe that he single-handedly invented electricity and electronics.6[029_BM029.xhtml#d235] As one fan stated on his webpage, “Tesla invented justabout everything. As you work on your computer, remember Tesla. His Tesla Coilsupplies the high voltage for the picture tube you use. The electricity for yourcomputer comes from a Tesla-designed AC generator, is sent through a Teslatransformer, and gets to your house through 3-phase Tesla power.”7[029_BM029.xhtml#d236] I agree wholeheartedly that we need to understand howTesla invented these key devices and that we should assess his role in theelectrical revolution that reshaped society between 1880 and 1920.8[029_BM029.xhtml#d237] But in doing so, we should be careful that we do notconvert Tesla into a “superman” with fantastic intellectual powers.9[029_BM029.xhtml#d238]Previous biographies of Tesla have tended to be celebratory.10[029_BM029.xhtml#d239] In this book, I want to strike a balance betweencelebrating and criticizing Tesla; as suggested, he had a spectacular ascent(1884–94) followed by an equally dramatic descent (1895–1905). The task for aTesla biographer is to piece together his life so that both the ascent anddescent make sense. Indeed, the factors that made for an individual’s successshould also explain that person’s failures. One measure of a good historicalexplanation is symmetry—that the framework used sheds light on both success andfailure.Moreover, while previous biographies have focused largely on Tesla’spersonality, this book seeks to take measure of both the man and his creativework. Throughout the book, I will seek to answer three basic questions: How didTesla invent? How did his inventions work? And what happened as he introducedhis inventions? To answer these questions, I will draw on Tesla’scorrespondence, business records, legal testimony, publications, and survivingartifacts. Some readers may be disappointed that their favorite Tesla story isnot here and that there may be more technical discussion than they would like.However, as a historian, I have to tell Tesla’s story based on the documents,not on the wishes and dreams we might like to project onto heroes like Tesla. Inmany ways, Brisbane had it right when he said that the purpose of his story was“to discover this great new electrician thoroughly; to interest Americans in[Tesla’s] personality so that they may study his future achievements with propercare.”CONCEPTS AND THEMESTo tell the story of Tesla’s dramatic rise and fall, then, we need a frameworkthat allows us to piece the story together. In particular, since Tesla was aninventor, we need a way to think about invention. From my perspective, it’s alltoo easy to associate invention with imponderables such as genius, mystery, andluck; in contrast, I view invention as a process that we can analyze andunderstand.11 [029_BM029.xhtml#d240]Invention refers to the activities by which individuals create new devices orprocesses that serve human needs and wishes. To do so, an inventor must ofteninvestigate phenomena in nature. In some cases, an inventor need only observenature closely to discover what will work, but in other cases, he or she musttease out new insights by experiment or ingenious manipulation. Because naturedoes not readily yield up her secrets, one could say that an inventor“negotiates” with nature.12 [029_BM029.xhtml#d241]At the same time, invention is not simply discovering how to make something; aninventor must also connect his or her invention with society. In somesituations, needs are well-known and society readily takes up a new invention.Since railroads in the mid-nineteenth century needed stronger rails and armieswanted stronger cannon barrels, there was a ready demand for Henry Bessemer’snew steel-making process in 1856. In other situations, though, there is nopreexisting need and an inventor must convince society of an invention’s value.For example, when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876, he foundfew people willing to buy it; indeed, it took the Bell Telephone Company decadesto convince Americans that every home should have a telephone. Bell and hissuccessor companies had to invent not only the telephone but also a marketingstrategy that reflected the interests of users. In this sense, inventors“negotiate” with society.13 [029_BM029.xhtml#d242]What makes invention interesting is that inventors stand astride the natural andsocial worlds. On the one hand, they must be willing to engage nature, to findout what will work; on the other hand, inventors must also interact withsociety, exchanging their inventions for money, fame, or resources. To succeed,inventors must be creative on both sides—in how they negotiate with both natureand society.In moving between nature and society, inventors develop their own worldview andcreative method, reflecting their personality, education, experience, andcontext. Inventors find their own ways to probe nature, fashion theirdiscoveries into working devices, and ultimately convince other people thattheir creation is useful or valuable. As Tesla’s story unfolds, you will seethat his approach was influenced by his religious background, his friends andbackers, and his problems with emotional depression. As Thomas Hughes hassuggested, inventors—like artists—evolve a unique style.14[029_BM029.xhtml#d243]Tesla’s style as an inventor can be described as a tension between ideal andillusion. I have borrowed this tension from the allegory of the cave found inThe Republic by Plato.15 [029_BM029.xhtml#d244] Plato developed this allegory toillustrate the difference between ignorance and enlightenment, between howordinary people and philosophers perceived the world and truth. To explain howordinary people had a limited understanding of the truth, Plato imagined a groupof individuals trapped in the cave who were shackled to chairs and their headslocked in braces so they could not turn around and see how light (or truth) cameinto the cave. Trapped in this way, they spent their lives debating theflickering shadows projected on the wall by people and things passing in frontof a fire behind them. For Plato, then, ordinary people could only deal withillusions. In contrast, the philosopher for Plato was like a prisoner who, freedfrom the shackles, came to understand that the shadows on the wall were notreality at all, as he could now perceive the true form of reality in the waythat the fire and the moving objects created the shadows. Plato’s philosopherscould look directly at the fire and even the sun outside the cave to know thetruth. Only philosophers, concluded Plato, could fathom universal truths,ideals.As we shall see, Tesla was like Plato’s philosopher, someone who chose to seekout and understand ideals. As Tesla told one biographer, he was inspired by asaying from Sir Isaac Newton: “I simply hold the thought steadily in my mind’seye until a clear light dawns upon me.”16 [029_BM029.xhtml#d245] In harnessingnature for his inventions, Tesla spent a great deal of time and energy trying todiscern the fundamental principle on which to base an invention and then workedto manifest that ideal as a working device. With his AC motor, the ideal was therotating magnetic field; similarly, the ideal of electromagnetic resonance laybehind his devices related to broadcasting electric power without wires.On several occasions, Tesla elaborated on his idealist approach to invention;here is how he described it to his fellow electrical engineers when he wasawarded the Edison Medal in 1917:I have unconsciously evolved what I consider a new method of materializinginventive concepts and ideas, which is exactly opposite to the purelyexperimental of which undoubtedly Edison is the greatest and most successfulexponent. The moment you construct a device to carry into practice a crude ideayou will find yourself inevitably engrossed with the details and defects of theapparatus. As you go on improving and reconstructing, your force ofconcentration diminishes and you lose sight of the great underlying principle.You obtain results, but at the sacrifice of quality.My method is different. I do not rush into constructive work. When I get anidea, I start right away to build it up in my mind. I change the structure, Imake improvements, I experiment, I run the device in my mind. It is absolutelythe same to me whether I operate my turbine in thought or test it actually in myshop. It makes no difference, the results are the same. In this way, you see, Ican rapidly develop and perfect an invention, without touching anything. When Ihave gone so far that I have put into the device every possible improvement Ican think of, that I can see no fault anywhere, I then construct this finalproduct of my brain. Every time my device works as I conceive it should and myexperiment comes out exactly as I plan it [emphasis added].17[029_BM029.xhtml#d246]I suspect that Tesla came to this idealist approach partly through his religiousbackground. As Chapter 1 [010_Chapter010.xhtml] will reveal, Tesla’s father anduncles were all priests in the Serbian Orthodox Church and Tesla absorbedsomething of that faith’s beliefs that through the Son of God, the Word orLogos, everything in Creation is endowed with an underlying principle.18[029_BM029.xhtml#d247] In this sense, Tesla was much like the great Britishscientist Michael Faraday, whose research in electricity and chemistry wasstrongly influenced by his religious beliefs; Faraday was a member of theSandemanian Church, a Christian sect founded in 1730 that gave Faraday a strongsense of the unity of God and nature.19 [029_BM029.xhtml#d248]In taking an idealist approach to invention, Tesla was exhibiting what theeconomist Joseph Schumpeter called subjective, as opposed to objective,rationality (see Chapter 2 [011_Chapter011.xhtml]). For Schumpeter, engineersand managers come up with incremental innovations by going out and assessingexisting needs whereas entrepreneurs and inventors introduce radical anddisruptive innovations by responding to ideas that come from within.20[029_BM029.xhtml#d249] With objective rationality, the individual shapes ideasin response to the outside world (the market) whereas with subjectiverationality, the individual reshapes the outside world to conform to his or herinternal ideas. With both the rotating magnetic field and electromagneticresonance, we will see that the ideals came from within and Tesla struggled toreorder the social world in order to make his inventions a reality.Tesla’s style as an idealist inventor was both similar to and different thanthat of other inventors. Tesla was very much like Alexander Graham Bell, whocalled himself a “theoretical inventor” since he preferred to edit and shapeinventions in his mind. In contrast, Thomas Edison was almost opposite in style,preferring to develop his ideas by physical means, either by sketching ormanipulating devices on the workbench.21 [029_BM029.xhtml#d250]Having identified the ideal behind an invention, Tesla was willing to write itup as an article or patent, and he took great delight in demonstrating it to thepublic. However, Tesla was not especially interested in the nitty-gritty work ofconverting his inventions into profitable products. Moreover, he was oftenfrustrated that ordinary people did not grasp the ideals underlying hisinventions, and so he resorted to illusions to convince them of the value of hiscreations. Tesla came to believe that along with identifying the ideal for aninvention, he also had to create the right illusion—about the exciting andrevolutionary changes that his invention would bring about for society. Throughdemonstrations, technical papers, and newspaper interviews, Tesla sought tocapture the imagination of the public as well as the entrepreneurs who wouldpurchase and develop his inventions. Illusions were the means by which Teslanegotiated with society and secured the resources he needed to convert hisideals into real machines.In using the term “illusion” here, I must emphasize that Tesla was notattempting to deceive potential backers by lying or giving them inaccurateinformation. Rather, the interaction between an inventor and his backers isanalogous to what takes place between an actor and the audience: the actor maysay certain things and make certain gestures, but it is the audience whointerprets the statements and gestures and shapes them into an impression. Indoing so, members of the audience merge what the performer offers with what theyknow from the larger culture.22 [029_BM029.xhtml#d251] In his public lectures,Tesla provided his audiences with just the right sort of information—a blend ofwizardry, scientific facts, and social commentary—such that they drew theconclusion that his invention would change the world. What Tesla did wasencourage people to see in his inventions whole new worlds of possibility. Infact, I would argue that all inventors and entrepreneurs have to generateillusions about their creations—that we can never know in advance what impact aninvention will have and so the discussion about a new technology often turns onillusion. As the science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke aptly noted, “Anysufficiently advanced technology will appear as magic.”23 [029_BM029.xhtml#d252]Inventors, then, succeed by harnessing nature in a new device and connectingthat device to people’s hopes and wishes. Many inventors and entrepreneursstrive to create the right illusion for untested technologies and novel businessplans, but Tesla was extraordinary in linking inventions and cultural wishes.24[029_BM029.xhtml#d253] What is unfortunate is that during the second decade ofhis career (1894–1904)—when he was at the height of his creative powers—Teslaconcentrated more on creating illusions than converting his ideals into workingmachines. Tesla’s story, as we shall see, was a struggle between ideal andillusion."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEAN IDEAL CHILDHOOD(1856–1878)Our first endeavors are purely instinctive, promptingsof an imagination vivid and undisciplined. As we growolder reason asserts itself and we become more and moresystematic and designing. But those early impulses,tho[ugh] not immediately productive, are of the greatestmoment and may shape our very destinies.NIKOLA TESLA, My Inventions (1919)Inventors must live with an exquisite tension. On the one hand, they must be intouch with their inner feelings, insights, and impulses—what Tesla calls the“promptings of an imagination vivid and undisciplined”—since these are often thesource of new ideas and inventions. On the other hand, inventors can convert aninsight into a practical invention only by connecting it to the larger world ofmarkets and needs, and they do this by systematic thinking and design. Inventorsmust merge the subjective (what they know from inside themselves) with theobjective (what they learn about the outside world).1 [029_BM029.xhtml#d254] Howdid Tesla learn in his childhood to cultivate his imagination and not let reasonoverwhelm it?We are able to investigate this overarching question about creative tensionbecause Tesla described his emotional and intellectual development in anautobiography he published in 1919.2 [029_BM029.xhtml#d255] But before we canexamine his inner life, we must begin by exploring where Tesla was born and whohis parents were.STRANGERS IN A STRANGE LANDNikola Tesla was born in 1856 in Smiljan in the province of Lika in what istoday Croatia. At that time, Croatia was the military frontier district of theAustro-Hungarian Empire and the area was sometimes referred to as the Krajina.Yet Tesla’s father, Milutin, and mother, Djuka, were both Serbs, and Serbia islocated farther south in the Balkans, in what was then the Ottoman Empire. Howwas it that the Tesla family was living in Croatia in the mid-nineteenthcentury? How did they cope with being strangers in a strange land?As the journalist Tim Judah has observed, “The Serbs [have] always been a peopleon the move.”3 [029_BM029.xhtml#d256] Descendants of the Slavs who migratedsouth from what is modern-day Germany and Poland, the Serbs have movedperiodically across the Balkan Peninsula, sometimes in search of better farmlandand sometimes in response to violence and invasion. During the height of theirpower in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the Ottoman Turks swept norththrough much of the Balkan Peninsula, displacing several Christian populations.The Turks pushed the Serbs from their homeland (now modern Serbia and part ofKosovo), with the result that some Serbs migrated to Croatia.4[029_BM029.xhtml#d257] Anxious to defend their Balkan frontier from the OttomanTurks, the Austrian authorities encouraged the Serbs to settle in Croatia andjoin the army since the Serbs were sworn enemies of the Turks. Unlike otherparts of the Austrian Empire, Croatia was firmly controlled by military officersand every twelfth male subject in the region was required to serve in the army.As a result, the Austrians came to regard Croatia as a source of troops that itused not only to protect their Balkan border but also to fight in other wars.5[029_BM029.xhtml#d258]Tesla’s ancestors migrated from Western Serbia to Lika in the 1690s. The Serbsstruggled to farm this hard land, which was mountainous and sparsely populated.According to Tesla, the soil was so rocky that the Likan Serbs were fond ofsaying “that when God distributed the rocks over the earth He carried them in asack, and that when he was above our land the sack broke.”6[029_BM029.xhtml#d259]The name Tesla, in Serbo-Croatian, has two meanings. Typically it refers to anadze or a small ax with a blade at right angles to the handle. However, it canalso be used to describe a person with protruding teeth, a facial characteristiccommon in the Tesla family.Tesla’s grandfather, also named Nikola, was born in 1789 in Lika. During hischildhood, Croatia was ceded by the Austrians to Napoleon and became part of theFrench empire as the Illyrian provinces.7 [029_BM029.xhtml#d260] Like otherLikan Serbs, grandfather Nikola pursued a military career; during the NapoleonicWars, he joined the French army, rose to the rank of sergeant, and married AnaKalinic, the daughter of a colonel.After Napoleon’s defeat in 1815, the Illyrian provinces reverted to the AustrianEmpire. To keep the Turks out and maintain tight control over the localpopulation of Croats and Serbs, the Austrians continued to operate the provinceas a military frontier. Although the official religion of the Austrian Empirewas Roman Catholic, the Austrians allowed the Serbs to have their own Orthodoxchurches in Croatia.In the years after the Napoleonic Wars, grandfather Nikola returned to Lika,where he made the transition from the French army to serving the AustrianEmpire. Nikola and Ana had two sons, Milutin (1819–79) and Josif, and threedaughters, Stanka, Janja, and one whose name has been lost. Both sons were firstsent to a German-language public school and then to the Austrian MilitaryOfficers’ Training School (probably the Theresian Military Academy in WienerNeustadt). Josif thrived in this environment and became a professor at amilitary academy in Austria. A skilled mathematician, Josif wrote severalstandard works on mathematics.8 [029_BM029.xhtml#d261]In contrast to his father and brother, Milutin did not find military life to hisliking. Following a reprimand at school for not keeping his brass buttonspolished, he quit and instead chose to become a priest in the Serbian OrthodoxChurch. Milutin enrolled in the Orthodox Seminary in Plaski and graduated in1845 as the top student in his class.In 1847, Milutin married Djuka (Georgina) Mandic (1822–92), thetwenty-five-year-old daughter of a priest, Nikola Mandic from Gracac. Just asthe Tesla family pursued military careers, so most of the men in the Mandic clanjoined the clergy; not only was Djuka’s father a priest but so were hergrandfather and brothers. Several of Djuka’s brothers were very successful;while brother Nikolai became the Archbishop of Sarajevo and Metropolitan of theSerbian Orthodox Church in Bosnia, Pajo rose to the rank of general-staffcolonel in the Austrian army, and Trifun became a well-known hotelier andlandowner.9 [029_BM029.xhtml#d262]Shortly after marrying Djuka, Milutin was assigned to a parish of fortyhouseholds in Senj on the Adriatic coast of Croatia. There, in a stony churchperched on a steep cliff, they made a home, and three children were born toDjuka: Dane (1848–63), Angelina (b. 1850), and Milka (b. 1852).At Senj, Milutin was expected to build up the congregation as well as representSerbs before “foreign and Catholic persons.” Tall and pale, Milutin had highcheekbones and a sparse beard, which gave him a serious visage (Figure 1.1[010_Chapter010.xhtml#fig1_1]). His congregation found him to be an energeticpreacher, and for his sermon “On Labor,” he was awarded the Red Sash by hisbishop. As an idealistic young priest, Milutin was willing to challenge theAustrian authorities. In 1848 he asked the local military commander to allowSerbian soldiers to attend Orthodox services on Sundays, but the Austriansrefused and insisted that the Serbs continue to attend Catholic mass.10[029_BM029.xhtml#d263]image [Images/PG_31_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 1.1. Tesla’s father, Milutin. From NTM. Perhaps reflecting his father’s experience in the Army of Napoleon, Milutin’sworldview combined progressive thought and nationalism. Throughout theterritories conquered by Napoleon, the French swept out old ideas aboutfeudalism and absolute monarchy, introduced science and rationality, promotededucation by setting up high schools (gymnasia), and stimulated ethnic groups todream of autonomy.11 [029_BM029.xhtml#d264] None of these ideas, of course,would have sat well with either the Austrians or the Ottoman Turks. Like othereducated Serbs in the mid-nineteenth century, Milutin believed that thecondition of Serbs would improve only if they were able to preserve theirtraditions and create their own nation separate from both the Austrians and theTurks. As Milutin wrote in an 1852 letter, “By God! Nothing is as sacred to meas my church and my forefathers’ law and custom, and nothing so precious asliberty, well-being and advancement of my people and my brothers, and for thesetwo, the church and the people, wherever I am, I’ll be ready to lay down mylife.”12 [029_BM029.xhtml#d265]But despite his zeal, Milutin found Senj to be a difficult assignment. Hissalary was barely enough to make ends meet and the damp seaside air affected hishealth. Consequently, Milutin requested a transfer, and in 1852 he was sent tothe church of St. Apostles Peter and Paul in Smiljan in Lika.Translated, Smiljan means “the place of sweet basil,” and the Tesla family foundthis village much more congenial. The parish of Saints Peter and Paul servedseventy to eighty households (about a thousand people) and consisted of a whitechurch located at the foot of the Bogdanic mountain, beside a running brookcalled Vaganac. Although picturesque, the church was isolated, with the nearestneighbors two miles away. Besides the church, there was a fine house for thefamily and an allotment of fertile farmland (Figure 1.2[010_Chapter010.xhtml#fig1_2]).13 [029_BM029.xhtml#d266] To permit Milutin totravel to families throughout the parish, a Turkish pasha from Bosnia presentedhim with a magnificent Arabian stallion as a reward for helping some localMuslims.14 [029_BM029.xhtml#d266a]image [Images/fm_02.jpg]FIGURE 1.2. Tesla’s birthplace in Smiljan Lika as it appeared in the 1930s. FromKSP, Smithsonian Institution. At Smiljan, Djuka had the resources to create a comfortable home for her family.“My mother was indefatigable,” remembered Tesla.She worked regularly from four o’clock in the morning till eleven in theevening. From four to breakfast time—six a.m.—while others slumbered, I neverclosed my eyes but watched my mother with intense pleasure as she attendedquickly—sometimes running—to her many self-imposed duties. She directed theservants to take care of all our domestic animals, she milked the cows, sheperformed all sorts of labor unassisted, set the table, prepared breakfast forthe whole household. Only when it was ready to be served did the rest of thefamily get up. After breakfast everybody followed my mother’s inspiring example.All did their work diligently, liked it, and so achieved a measure ofcontentment.15 [029_BM029.xhtml#d267]With the household in Djuka’s capable hands, Milutin’s health improved, and heresumed preaching with vigor. Milutin began assembling a library with volumes onreligion, mathematics, science, and literature in several languages. He recitedpoetry with ease and boasted that if a particular classic were lost, he couldrecover it from his memory. Milutin’s most prized possession was an edition ofthe Sluzhebnik or Serbian book of liturgy printed in Venice in 1519. Teslainherited this book from his father and carried it with him to America.16[029_BM029.xhtml#d268]Milutin also started writing articles for several Serbian newspapers andmagazines, including the Serbian Diary of Novi Sad, the Srbobran published inZagreb, and a Serbo-Dalmatian magazine from Zadar. Concerned that illiteracywould prevent the Serbs from making social and political progress, Milutincalled for a school where Serbs could be taught in their own language.17[029_BM029.xhtml#d269] Hence, Milutin was something of a reformer who soughtways to improve the daily life of the Serbian people.CHILD OF LIGHTIt was in these felicitous circumstances at Smiljan that Tesla was born atmidnight between the ninth and tenth of July 1856 (Old Style).18[029_BM029.xhtml#d270] Family legend has it that a violent thunderstorm wasraging at that moment, which frightened the village midwife. Fearful, themidwife said, “He’ll be a child of the storm.” In response, his mother replied,“No, of light.” Tesla was baptized at home on the day he was born, suggestingthat the family was concerned that he was weak as a newborn. As required byAustrian law, the infant was enlisted in the First Lika Regiment, the NinthMedak Company, headquartered in Raduč, with the expectation that he would servefrom age fifteen onward.19 [029_BM029.xhtml#d271] As a very young child, Teslaenjoyed playing with his older siblings as well as his younger sister Marica (b.1859). Together they would run around the churchyard or farmyard with thepigeons, chickens, geese, and sheep kept by the family.20 [029_BM029.xhtml#d272]But Tesla’s favorite companion was the family’s black cat, Macak. Macak followedyoung Nikola everywhere, and they spent many happy hours rolling on the grass.It was Macak the cat who introduced Tesla to electricity on a dry winterevening. “As I stroked Macak’s back,” he recalled, “I saw a miracle that made mespeechless with amazement. Macak’s back was a sheet of light and my handproduced a shower of sparks loud enough to be heard all over the house.”Curious, he asked his father what caused the sparks. Puzzled at first, Milutinfinally answered, “Well, this is nothing but electricity, the same thing you seethrough the trees in a storm.” His father’s answer, equating the sparks withlightning, fascinated the young boy. As Tesla continued to stroke Macak, hebegan to wonder, “Is nature a gigantic cat? If so, who strokes its back?” “Itcan only be God,” he concluded.This first observation was followed by yet another remarkable event. As the roomgrew darker and the candles were lit, Macak got up and took a few steps. “Heshook his paws as though he were treading on wet ground,” remembered Tesla in1939,I looked at him attentively. Did I see something or was it an illusion? Istrained my eyes and perceived distinctly that his body was surrounded by a halolike the aureola [sic] of a saint!I cannot exaggerate the effect of this marvelous night on my childishimagination. Day after day I have asked myself “what is electricity?” and foundno answer. Eighty years have gone by since that time and I still ask the samequestion, unable to answer it.21 [029_BM029.xhtml#d273]Just as legend has it that young James Watt was intrigued by how steam couldraise the lid of a kettle, so Macak the cat provided the initial inspiration forTesla to spend a lifetime studying electricity.AN ACTIVE IMAGINATIONAt an early age, Tesla began to tinker, inspired by his mother, Djuka. While thepeasants around her in Lika used crude tools that had remained unchanged forcenturies, Djuka fashioned better devices in order to run her householdefficiently. As her son fondly remembered,My mother was an inventor of the first order and would, I believe, have achievedgreat things had she not been so remote from modern life and its multifoldopportunities. She invented and constructed all kinds of tools and devices andwove the finest designs from thread which [sic] was spun by her.… She workedindefatigably, from break of day till late at night, and most of the wearingapparel and furnishings of the home was [sic] the product of her hands. When shewas past sixty, her fingers were still nimble enough to tie three knots in aneyelash.22 [029_BM029.xhtml#d274]Following his mother’s example, Tesla made things as a youngster. One earlyinvention involved an effort, as Tesla put it, “to harness the energies ofnature to the service of man.” Hoping to create a flying machine, Teslafashioned a spindle with four rotors on one end and a disk on the other.Intuitively he thought the spinning rotors might create enough lift to carry thewhole device into the air, much like a modern helicopter. To power the device,Tesla planned to fasten june bugs to the rotors until a strange boy, who was theson of a retired officer in the Austrian army, came along. Much to Tesla’sdisgust, the boy gobbled up the june bugs. Tesla abandoned the project andresolved never to touch another insect again in his life.23[029_BM029.xhtml#d275] This aborted flying machine was followed by othercreative endeavors. Like many a curious lad, Tesla took mechanical clocks apartonly to discover how much more difficult it was to put them back together. Hemade his own wooden sword and imagined himself a great Serbian warrior. “At thattime I was under the sway of the Serbian national poetry and full of admirationfor the feats of the heroes,” recalled Tesla. “I used to spend hours in mowingdown my enemies in the form of corn-stalks which ruined the crops and netted meseveral spankings from my mother.”24 [029_BM029.xhtml#d276]While on the outside Tesla appeared to be a typical happy boy, on the inside hispowerful imagination could at times be out of control. As he described in hisautobiography: “Up to the age of eight years, … [m]y feelings came in waves andsurges and vibrated unceasingly between extremes. My wishes were of consumingforce and like the heads of the hydra, they multiplied. I was opprest [sic] bythoughts of pain in life and death and religious fear. I was swayed bysuperstitious belief and lived in constant dread of the spirit of evil, ofghosts and ogres and other unholy monsters of the dark.”Even more disturbing, Tesla found it difficult to distinguish images fromreality:In my boyhood I suffered from a peculiar affliction due to the appearance ofimages, often accompanied by strong flashes of light, which marred the sight ofreal objects and interfered with my thought and action. They were pictures ofthings and scenes which I had really seen, never of those I imagined. When aword was spoken to me the image of the object it designated would present itselfvividly to my vision and sometimes I was quite unable to distinguish whetherwhat I saw was tangible or not. This caused me great discomfort and anxiety.…They seem to have been unique altho[ugh] I was probably predisposed as I knowthat my brother experienced a similar trouble.… They certainly were nothallucinations such as are produced in diseased and anguished minds, for inother respects I was normal and composed. To give an idea of my distress,suppose that I had witnest [sic] a funeral or some such nerve-racking spectacle.Then, inevitably, in the stillness of night, a vivid picture of the scene wouldthrust itself before my eyes and persist despite all my efforts to banish it.Sometimes it would even remain fixt [sic] in space tho[ugh] I pushed my handthr[ough] it.25 [029_BM029.xhtml#d277]Unable to control these images, Tesla felt weak and powerless.A DEATH IN THE FAMILYAdding to his emotional difficulties, Tesla lived in the shadow of his olderbrother, Dane, who was regarded by his parents as extraordinarily gifted. As theeldest son, Dane was expected to follow his father and uncles into the clergy.But in 1863, Dane was killed by his father’s high-spirited Arabian horse, andNikola, at the age of seven, was an eyewitness to the tragedy.26[029_BM029.xhtml#d278]Distraught by the loss of his favorite son, Milutin uprooted the family fromSmiljan and moved to the larger nearby town of Gospić, the county seat for theLika-Senj as well as an administrative center for the Austrian MilitaryFrontier.27 [029_BM029.xhtml#d279] There Milutin preached for the next sixteenyears under the onion-shaped dome of the Church of the Great Martyr George.Although he continued his pastoral duties and taught religion in the localschools, Milutin wrote fewer articles and embraced fewer causes. He developed“the odd habit of talking to himself and would often carry on an animatedconversation and indulge in heated argument,” changing his voice so that itsounded as if several different people were talking. Milutin never got over thedeath of Dane, and well before his time he came to be called “Old ManMilovan.”28 [029_BM029.xhtml#d280]For Tesla, both the death of his brother and the sudden move to Gospić weredeeply disturbing. He loved his home in the country and missed seeing theanimals in the farmyard. He had just finished his first year of school inSmiljan and was overwhelmed by the hurly-burly of the larger town. “In our newhouse I was but a prisoner,” he wrote, “watching the strange people I saw thruthe window blinds. My bashfulness was such that I would rather have faced aroaring lion than one of the city dudes who strolled about.”29[029_BM029.xhtml#d281] Tesla was so fond of his home village that when he filedhis first patents in America, he listed himself as from Smiljan in Lika, notGospić.The sudden death of his brother irrevocably altered Tesla’s relationship withhis parents, particularly with his father. Grieving for Dane, on whom they hadpinned all of their hopes, Milutin and Djuka were unable to appreciate thepromise of their other son. “Anything I did that was creditable merely caused myparents to feel their loss more keenly,” recalled Tesla. “So I grew up withlittle confidence in myself.” (Alexander Graham Bell’s family was deeplyaffected by the sudden death in 1870 of Bell’s older and younger brothers,Melville James and Ted; in this case, the Bell family came to together with highexpectations for the remaining son.)30 [029_BM029.xhtml#d282] Like manychildren, Tesla sought to win back the love of his parents by striving to beperfect. Hoping now that his second son would become a priest, Milutin drilledhim with “all sorts of exercises—as, guessing one another’s thoughts,discovering the defects of some form or expression, repeating long sentences orperforming mental calculations. These daily lessons were intended to strengthenmemory and reason and especially to develop the critical sense, and wereundoubtedly very beneficial.”31 [029_BM029.xhtml#d283] Yet as Tesla describedthem in his recollections, one senses that he performed as a duty to his father.About this time, Tesla discovered the pleasures of reading in his father’slibrary. But rather than being pleased that his second son had a passion forreading, Milutin was angered by it. “He did not permit it and would fly into arage when he caught me in the act,” explained Tesla. “He hid the candles when hefound that I was reading in secret. He did not want me to spoil my eyes.” Butthis did not stop Tesla, who surreptitiously obtained tallow and cast his owncandles. With these homemade candles he would read all night, often untildawn.32 [029_BM029.xhtml#d284]The worst moment with his father, however, came one Sunday when Tesla washelping in church by ringing the bells. As he recalled in his autobiography,“There was a wealthy lady in town, a good but pompous woman, who used to come tothe church gorgeously painted up and attired with an enormous train andattendants. One Sunday I had just finished ringing the bell in the belfry andrushed downstairs when this grand dame was sweeping out and I jumped on hertrain. It tore off with a ripping noise which sounded like a salvo of musketryfired by raw recruits. My father was livid with rage. He gave me a gentle slapon the cheek, the only corporal punishment he ever administered to me but Ialmost feel it now. The embarrassment and confusion that followed areindescribable.”33 [029_BM029.xhtml#d285]Unable to please his father, Tesla “contracted many strange likes, dislikes andhabits,” or what now might be called obsessions. He developed a violent aversionto earrings on women and pearls, although other jewelry was tolerable. Herefused to touch the hair of other people and was disturbed by smells such ascamphor. “When I drop little squares of paper in a dish filled with liquid, Ialways sense a peculiar and awful taste in my mouth,” he noted, and “I countedthe steps in my walks and calculated the cubical contents of soup plates, coffeecups and pieces of food—otherwise my meal was unenjoyable. All repeated acts oroperations I performed had to be divisible by three and if I mist [sic] I feltimpelled to do it all over again, even if it took hours.”34[029_BM029.xhtml#d286] These obsessions plagued Tesla throughout his life, andalthough he struggled to understand their cause, they undoubtedly interferedwith his relationships with other people.AN ACT OF WILLWith his parents distracted by grief over Dane and disappointed in him, Tesla asa boy “was compelled to concentrate attention upon myself” and becameintrospective. While he suffered at first, he soon discovered that being able tolook inside himself was a great blessing and a means to achievement.Looking inside himself, Tesla underwent a profound change when he was twelveyears old. In the course of his reading, he came across a Serbian translation ofa novel titled Abafi (1836) by the well-known Hungarian writer Miklós Jósika.Set in Jósika’s native Transylvania in the sixteenth century, this historicalnovel recounted the struggles of Prince Sigismund Báthory (1572–1613) as hedefended his principality against the Hungarians, Turks, and Austrians. Intothis setting—replete with “ruined castles, ancient customs, shining armour,Turkish pashas, and bold intrigues at court”—Jósika introduced a fictitiousyoung nobleman, Olivér Abafi, who emerges as the hero of the story. Abafi startsout as frivolous and unruly, but as the novel progresses, he grows in moralstature, eventually sacrificing himself for his prince and country. As onecontemporary reviewer observed, Jósika used Abafi to demonstrate how “a youngman absorbed by debauchery and love of pleasure, who, by firmness of will andenergy of resolution, exalts himself into one of the most respected andexemplary heroes of his country, that inflexibility of purpose can overcomeevery thing.”35 [029_BM029.xhtml#d287]Inspired by Abafi’s transformation, the novel awakened Tesla’s willpower and herealized that he could exercise control over his feelings. “At first myresolutions faded like snow in April,” he remembered, “but in a little while Iconquered my weakness and felt a pleasure I never knew before—that of doing as Iwilled. In the course of time this vigorous mental exercise became secondnature. At the outset my wishes had to be subdued but gradually desire and willgrew to be identical.”36 [029_BM029.xhtml#d288]As he developed his willpower, Tesla sought to control the visions that had beentroubling him. These visions, noted Tesla, “usually occurred when I found myselfin a dangerous or distressing situation, or when I was greatly exhilarated. Insome instances I have seen all the air around me filled with tongues of livingflame.” To banish these images when they tormented him, Tesla had tried toconcentrate on something else, but since he had seen little of the world, hesoon ran out of things to substitute. Now, however, he discovered that it wasbetter to work with the images, to let his imagination roam freely and thus tochannel them:Then I instinctively commenced to make excursions beyond the limits of the smallworld of which I had knowledge, and I saw new scenes. These were at first veryblurred and indistinct, and would flit away when I tried to concentrate myattention upon them, but by and by I succeeded in fixing them; they gained instrength and distinctness and finally assumed the concreteness of real things. Isoon discovered that my best comfort was attained if I simply went on in myvision farther and farther, getting new impressions all the time, and so I beganto travel—of course, in my mind. Every night (and sometimes during the day),when alone, I would start on my journeys—see new places, cities andcountries—live there, meet people and make friendships and acquaintances and,however unbelievable, it is a fact that they were just as dear to me as those inactual life and not a bit less intense in their manifestations.37[029_BM029.xhtml#d289]Although he did not realize it at the time, by developing his self-control andlearning to channel his powerful imagination, Tesla had begun to acquire themental skills that would serve him well as an inventor. Not only would he beable to freely explore new ideas in his mind, but he would also have thediscipline and concentration he would need to shape and mentally edit theseideas into actual devices (see Chapter 12 [021_Chapter021.xhtml]).38[029_BM029.xhtml#d290]Along with learning to channel the images, Tesla evolved his own rationalexplanation for them. He had noticed that frequently the troubling images seemedto come not from within himself but as a result of something he had seen out inthe world. At first he thought this might have been coincidental,but soon I convinced myself that it was not so. A visual impression, consciouslyor unconsciously received, invariably preceded the appearance of the image.Gradually the desire arose in me to find out, every time, what caused the imagesto appear, and the satisfaction of this desire soon became a necessity. The nextobservation I made was that, just as these images followed as a result ofsomething I had seen, so also the thoughts which I conceived were suggested inlike manner. Again, I experienced the same desire to locate the image whichcaused the thought, and this search for the original visual impression soon grewto be a second nature. My mind became automatic, as it were, and in the courseof years of continued, almost unconscious performance, I acquired the ability oflocating … instantly the visual impression which started the thought.Following these observations, Tesla decided that every thought or action that hetook could be attributed to some sort of external stimulation, be it somethinghe saw, heard, tasted, or touched. If this was true, he then concluded he was“an automaton endowed with power of movement, which merely responds to externalstimuli beating upon my sense organs, and thinks and acts and movesaccordingly.” Although flesh and blood, he was simply no more than a machinewhose output was determined by the inputs—a “meat machine,” as he once put it.39[029_BM029.xhtml#d291] Since this mechanistic view did away with the need forfree will or a soul, one wonders if Tesla ever discussed this theory with hisfather; such views would have certainly placed greater distance between Milutinand his son.As Tesla gained control of his inner life, he also began to look to the widerworld for approval and less to his father. This is illustrated by what happenedwhen the citizens of Gospić got a new fire engine. Under the leadership of ayoung merchant, the citizens had organized a fire department with uniforms and ared-and-black pumping engine. To demonstrate the engine, the fire departmentparaded proudly through the streets and down to the river. There, sixteenfiremen began to furiously pump the engine’s handles up and down, but no watercame out of the hose. As he watched the scene unfold, Tesla admitted that “Myknowledge of the mechanism was nil and I knew next to nothing of air pressure,but instinctively I felt for the suction hose in the water [i.e., the river] andfound that it had collapsed.” Recognizing that this blockage was causing theproblem, Tesla waded into the water and eliminated the kink in the input hose.Immediately the fire engine began to work and water gushed from the hose on theother end. Grateful that he had saved the day, the firemen hoisted Nikola ontheir shoulders and celebrated him as a hero. Here Tesla learned that solvingtechnical problems could lead to recognition and approval.40[029_BM029.xhtml#d292]EDUCATION AT THE GYMNASIAUpon arriving in Gospić, Tesla attended the local elementary or normal schoolfor three years. In one of the classrooms, he found demonstration models ofwaterwheels and turbines. Fascinated by these devices, Tesla duplicated severaland tested them in a local stream. Tesla proudly showed these wheels to one ofhis uncles, but this uncle did not appreciate the boy’s mechanical ingenuity andscolded him for wasting his time with such activities. Tesla neverthelesscontinued to think about turbines, and when he read a description of NiagaraFalls, he dreamed of using a giant wheel to capture the power of the falls. “Itold my uncle that I would go to America and carry out this scheme,” Teslarecalled, and “Thirty years later I saw my ideas carried out at Niagara” (seeChapter 9 [018_Chapter018.xhtml]).41 [029_BM029.xhtml#d293]At age ten, Tesla entered the Real Gymnasium in Gospić, the nineteenth-centuryequivalent of junior high school. Like his father and Uncle Josif, Teslaexcelled at mathematics. Taking advantage of his ability to visualize things inhis mind’s eye, he rapidly performed calculations that drew praise from hismathematics professor. But while he did well in mathematics, Tesla found therequired drawing class difficult. This was surprising because other members ofhis family could draw easily, and Tesla attributed his difficulty to hispreference for undisturbed thought. In addition, Tesla was also left-handed as ayoungster, which may have prevented him from being able to carry out theassignments since they were often designed for right-handed students. His gradesin drawing were so low that his father had to intercede with the schoolauthorities in order that Tesla might continue at the school. Hence it is notsurprising that Tesla avoided making drawings throughout his career as aninventor, even when they might have helped convey his ideas to other people.42[029_BM029.xhtml#d294]During his second year at the gymnasium in Gospić, Tesla became obsessed withcreating a flying machine. Often in his imagination he would journey to distantplaces by flying, but he did not know how it happened. Impressed with how thevacuum created inside the fire engine had been able to lift water from the riverand pump it under pressure into a hose, Tesla wrestled in his mind with a way tocombine a vacuum with the fact that the air on the atmosphere is under apressure of fourteen pounds per square inch.43 [029_BM029.xhtml#d295] Afterweeks of mental engineering, Tesla came up with a design which biographer JohnO’Neill described in the following way:He figured that a pressure of fourteen pounds should turn a cylinder at highspeed and he could arrange to get advantage of such pressure by surrounding onehalf of a cylinder with a vacuum and having the remaining half of its surfaceexposed to air pressure. He carefully built a box of wood. At one end was anopening into which a cylinder was fitted with a very high order of accuracy, sothat the box would be air-tight; and on one side of the cylinder the edge of thebox made a right-angle contact. On the cylinder’s other side the box made atangent, or flat, contact. This arrangement was made because he wanted the airpressure to be exerted at a tangent to the surface of the cylinder—a situationthat he knew would be required in order to produce rotation. If he could getthat cylinder to rotate, all he would have to do in order to fly would be toattach a propeller to a shaft from the cylinder, strap the box to his body andobtain continuous power from his vacuum box that would lift him through theair.44 [029_BM029.xhtml#d296]To test this idea, Tesla carefully constructed a wooden model. As he pumped theair out of the inside cylinder, the shaft turned slightly, making him deliriouswith joy. “Now I had something concrete,” he later wrote, “a flying machine withnothing more than a rotating shaft, flapping wings, and—a vacuum of unlimitedpower! From that time on I made my daily [imaginary] aerial excursions in avehicle of comfort and luxury as might have befitted King Solomon.” Of course,such a device would have been a perpetual motion machine, and years later Teslarealized that the atmospheric pressure acted at right angles to the surface ofthe cylinder and that the slight rotary effect he observed was due to a leak inhis apparatus. “Tho[ugh] this knowledge came gradually it gave me a painfulshock,” Tesla recalled, indicating that he had really hoped that he could buildan actual machine that would connect his dreams with reality.45[029_BM029.xhtml#d297]Tesla completed his studies at the gymnasium in Gospić in 1870, but just as hedid so, he “was prostrated with a dangerous illness or rather, a score of them,and my condition became so desperate that I was given up by physicians.”46[029_BM029.xhtml#d298] One wonders if these vague problems were related tooverly intense images since it is around this time (age twelve) that Teslaovercame them through a combination of willpower and learning to channel theimages.In recuperating from this illness, Tesla read constantly. Because of hisvoracious appetite for books, the local public library sent Tesla all thevolumes that had not been catalogued and allowed him to read and classify them.Among the new books that he encountered were several novels by Mark Twain. Teslafound them unlike anything he had read previously, “so captivating as to make meutterly forget my hopeless state.”47 [029_BM029.xhtml#d299] Years later Teslabecame friends with Twain, and when Tesla told him this story, Twain burst intotears.Once he regained his strength, Tesla resumed his studies at the higher RealGymnasium in Karlovac (or Carlstadt), Croatia. There Tesla stayed with hisfather’s sister, Stanka, and her husband, Colonel Bankovic, “an old war-horsehaving participated in many battles.” Located at the confluence of four rivers,Karlovac was low and marshy, and Tesla contracted malaria, which he treated withcopious amounts of quinine.Milutin had not wavered in his determination to have a son follow him into thepriesthood and sent his son to study in Karlovac so that he could prepare forthe seminary. While this prospect filled him with dread, Tesla found that he wasincreasingly attracted to physics, particularly to the study of electricity. AtKarlovac, his favorite teacher was the professor of physics, who illustrated hislectures with demonstration models, some of which were his own design. Amongthese, Tesla was captivated by the radiometer invented by the British scientistWilliam Crookes. Consisting of four tinfoil vanes on a pivot inside a vacuumbulb, Tesla was thrilled to see the vanes spin rapidly in bright light.Recalling his professor demonstrating this remarkable device, Tesla said, “It isimpossible for me to convey an adequate idea of the intensity of feeling Iexperienced in witnessing his exhibitions of these mysterious phenomena. Everyimpression produced a thousand echoes in my mind. I wanted to know more of thiswonderful force.” In response, he read everything he could find aboutelectricity and began experimenting with batteries, induction coils, andelectrostatic generators. Though he loved these investigations, Tesla knew thathis parents wanted him to go into the priesthood and so “resigned [myself] tothe inevitable with [an] aching heart.”48 [029_BM029.xhtml#d300]A FATHER’S PROMISEUpon completing his studies at Karlovac, Tesla intended to return home toGospić, but before he could do so, he received a message from his fatherinstructing him to go on a shooting expedition in the mountains. Since hisfather did not approve of hunting, these instructions puzzled Tesla and hedecided to ignore them and return home. There he discovered that the town was inthe grip of a cholera epidemic, which was why Milutin had suggested the huntingtrip. Upon arriving home, Tesla fell ill, and he struggled for nine months,bed-ridden and weak, to recover. His condition deteriorated, developing “intodropsy, pulmonary trouble, and all sorts of diseases until finally my coffin wasordered.”49 [029_BM029.xhtml#d301]During one particularly bad spell when it looked like Tesla was near death, hisfather rushed to his side and encouraged him to rally his strength. Looking upat his father’s pallid and anxious face, Tesla said, “Perhaps I may get well ifyou will let me study engineering.” Although it went against his wishes, Milutindid not want to lose another son. “You will go to the best technical institutionin the world,” his father solemnly promised, and Tesla “knew that he meant it. Aheavy weight was lifted from my mind.” On the strength of this promise, alongwith a little help from an herbal cure—“a bitter decoction of a peculiarbean”—Tesla came back to life “like another Lazarus to the utter amazement ofeverybody.”50 [029_BM029.xhtml#d302]Although Tesla was anxious to begin his engineering studies, he and his familynow faced another hurdle: Tesla had reached the age where, as a Serb living inthe Krajina, he was expected to serve in the Austrian army for three years.Although they might have been able to get him posted to one of hisbrother-in-law’s regiments, Milutin was concerned that his son was still notstrong enough to survive army life. Consequently, although avoiding conscriptionwas a serious offense, Milutin decided that Tesla should disappear from Gospićand hide in the mountains while he and his brothers came up with a plan for hisson’s future. For nine months, from the early fall of 1874 until the followingsummer, Tesla roamed in the mountains of Croatia, “loaded with a hunter’s outfitand a bundle of books.”51 [029_BM029.xhtml#d303]Tramping in the forest, Tesla grew stronger physically and mentally. As hehiked, he worked on several visionary inventions. For instance, he developed ascheme whereby he would ship letters and packages between continents via a pipeunder the ocean. The mail would be put into spherical containers and then shotthrough the pipe by means of hydraulic pressure. Although he carefully plannedhow his pumping plant could impart a high velocity to the water in the pipe, hefailed to realize that the higher the velocity of the fluid, the greater theresistance of the pipe walls to the fluid flow; as a result, he was forced toabandon this splendid idea.Another scheme involved building a ring around the Earth’s equator in order toimprove passenger travel. By applying the appropriate reactionary forces, Teslathought, the ring could be made stationary while Earth continued to rotate.People would then travel up to the ring, wait for their destination to appearbelow, and then drop back down to Earth. Tesla thought such a plan would enablepeople to travel about a thousand miles an hour, but he acknowledged that itwould be impossible to build the ring. As impractical as these schemes were,they reveal that Tesla from the start envisioned systems that embraced the wholeEarth, a theme that figures prominently in his work on wireless power.In conjuring up these schemes, Tesla realized the power of his ability togenerate mental images. Not only could he use his imagination to undertakefantastic journeys, but he could also direct this talent toward creating newmachines. “I observed to my delight that I could visualize with the greatestfacility,” he later claimed. “I needed no models, drawings or experiments. Icould picture them all as real in my mind.” Moreover, for Tesla, working withmental images meant that he could concentrate on identifying and exploring theideal behind an invention.52 [029_BM029.xhtml#d304]But how did Tesla know that it was important to seek out the ideal underlying aninvention? I suspect that this willingness to seek the ideal grew out of thereligious beliefs he acquired from his father and uncles in the Serbian OrthodoxChurch.Like all Christians, the Orthodox believe in the Trinity, that God is threepersons in one: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. As in Western Christianity,they further believe that through the Son, “the Word became flesh and dweltamong us” (John 1:14) and that through the Incarnation, Jesus lived on Earth anddied for our sins. However, in Orthodox Christianity, the fact that the Son ofGod is the Word takes on a deeper meaning; as Bishop Kallistos Ware explains,The second person of the Trinity is the Son of God, his “Word” or Logos.… He itis who was born on earth as man, from the Virgin Mary in the city of Bethlehem.But as Word or Logos he is also at work before the Incarnation. He is theprinciple of order and purpose that permeates all things, drawing them to unityin God, and so making the universe into a “cosmos,” a harmonious and integratedwhole. The Creator-Logos has imparted to each thing its own indwelling logos orinner principle, which makes that thing to be distinctly itself, and which atthe same time draws and directs that thing towards God. Our human task ascraftsmen or manufacturers is to discern this logos dwelling in each thing andto render it manifest; we seek not to dominate but to co-operate. 53[029_BM029.xhtml#d305]For Orthodox Christians, then, the material universe is not only orderly buteverything in it—natural and manmade—has an underlying divine principle, a logosthat can be discovered by humans. Indeed, one of the ways that humans can praiseGod—whether as craftsmen, manufacturers, or inventors—is to seek out the logosin all things. Hence, Orthodox beliefs about the Son of God as the Word or Logoswould have prompted Tesla to seek out the ideal in his inventions.To be sure, though Tesla later in life called himself a Christian, he does notappear to have gone to Orthodox Church or practiced his faith. However, thatdoes not mean his religious background had nothing to do with his approach toinvention. Indeed, growing up surrounded by Orthodox priests (his father anduncles), Tesla could not have helped but absorb some aspects of their worldview;his interest in finding an ideal underlying each invention is rooted in theirfaith.LESSONS FROM HOMEWhen Tesla returned to Gospić after this sojourn in the mountains, he learnedthat his father had kept his promise and had secured for him a scholarship fromthe Military Frontier Administration Authority (Grenzlandsverwaltungsbehoerde).The scholarship would pay 420 gulden a year for three years and would permitTesla to attend the Joanneum Polytechnic School in Graz, Austria. Uponcompletion of his studies, Tesla would owe the Military Authority eight years ofservice.54 [029_BM029.xhtml#d306]As Tesla prepared to leave Gospić to begin his studies in Graz, his motherpresented him with a shoulder bag that she had made. Colorful and beautifullyembroidered, the bag was typical of the textiles produced in Tesla’s homeprovince of Lika. Tesla treasured this bag and carried it with him throughouthis life.55 [029_BM029.xhtml#d307]Just as Tesla took this bag as a tangible remembrance of his family andhomeland, we can ask what intangible things he carried away as he left home forGraz. As Serbs living in the Austrian Military Frontier, his grandparents onboth sides had learned how to survive as strangers in a strange land; they hadlearned how to make their peace with the Austrian authorities by moving into theprofessions—the clergy and the military—that were open to them. We can see thatcoming from this background, Tesla would be well prepared to adapt to living inAmerica, that he would have the emotional and intellectual where-withal neededto move up quickly as an immigrant in New York in the 1880s. At the same time,one wonders if the experience of growing up in the “outside” group in Croatiaalso meant that Tesla learned to be careful and suspicious around strangers and,for that reason, often chose to keep to himself as an adult.From his mother and father, Tesla carried away traits that would serve him wellas an inventor. From his mother, he inherited not only mechanical ingenuity butalso an awareness of the satisfaction that came from creating useful things.Although his relationship with his father was strained, Tesla absorbed some ofhis father’s values as a social reformer. In particular, as he grew older, Teslabecame less interested in making money from his inventions and more concernedwith how they would help humanity. Much like his father, who hoped education andpolitical autonomy would improve the life of the Serbs, Tesla came to believethat his inventions—such as his radio-controlled boat and wireless power—wouldend war and usher in a new and prosperous age.But most of all from his childhood, Tesla came away with the intellectualabilities essential to invention. He had been born with an unusually powerfulvisual imagination—so powerful that at times he could not differentiate betweenimages and reality. As an adolescent, however, Tesla learned how to control thisimagination, to channel and direct it. At first he simply went on elaboratejourneys in his mind, but he gradually discovered that he could control hisimagination to envision new machines. To do so, Tesla learned that he had tostrike a balance between letting his imagination run wild and disciplining it sothat he could work out the details of a new machine. Drawing on his Orthodoxreligious background, too, he knew that there had to be an underlying principle,the ideal, behind an invention. Thrilled with how he could use his imaginationto find those principles and envision new technology, Tesla knew in his heartthat he wanted to be an inventor. Hence, as he slipped his peasant bag over hisshoulder and set out for Graz, Tesla left his home in Lika with the heritage,traits, and skills that would allow him to pursue his dream of being aninventor."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWODREAMING OF MOTORS(1878–1882)Tesla arrived in Graz in the fall of 1875 to begin his studies at the JoanneumPolytechnic School. The Joanneum was founded in 1811 as a gift from ArchdukeJohn to the counts of Styria (an Austrian province), and in 1864 it became aTechnische Hochschule. Along with institutes at Vienna, Prague, and Brno, theJoanneum was one of four schools in the Austrian Empire that offered engineeringdegrees.1 [029_BM029.xhtml#d308]Though the school offered a course of study in civil engineering, Teslainitially enrolled in mathematics and physics, with the intention of becoming aprofessor.2 [029_BM029.xhtml#d309] In so doing, he would have been following inthe footsteps of his Uncle Josif, and so Tesla may have chosen mathematics andphysics in order to please his father. Much as he wanted to support hisremaining son, Milutin probably found it hard to picture what Tesla would do asan engineer whereas being a professor or teacher of mathematics may have seemedlike a more plausible career.3 [029_BM029.xhtml#d310]AN INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRICITYAt the Joanneum, Tesla excelled at mathematics, but his favorite lectures weregiven by Professor Jacob Pöschl in physics. “Professor Pöschl,” recalled Tesla,“was peculiar; it was said of him that he wore the same coat for twenty years.But what he lacked in personal magnetism he made up in the perfection of hisexposition. I never saw him miss a word or gesture, and his demonstrations andexperiments came off with clocklike precision.”4 [029_BM029.xhtml#d311]Sitting in Pöschl’s lectures, Tesla was introduced in a systematic way toelectricity. If Pöschl was typical of other nineteenth-century lecturers inelectricity, he might well have provided a historical overview, beginning withthe ancient Greeks and progressing up to the latest developments with dynamosand electric lighting. In order to understand Tesla’s subsequent electricalinventions, let’s review the major topics just as Pöschl would have for Teslacirca 1876.Although the ancient Greeks were aware that static electricity could be producedby rubbing amber with silk, our modern understanding of electricity dates fromthe late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Several investigators—such asHenry Cavendish and Benjamin Franklin—systematically studied static electricity.These natural philosophers concentrated on how different bodies could beelectrically charged and sparks given off. In the early nineteenth century,electrical science expanded dramatically from the study of static charge toinvestigating what was then called dynamic electricity, or how charge could flowthrough a conductor. Building on the work of Luigi Galvani, Alessandro Voltademonstrated in 1800 how one could generate a flow of charge by alternatinglayers of two kinds of metal with papers soaked in acid. Known as a pile,Volta’s layers of metal and acid-soaked paper were the first electric battery.While chemists and philosophers energetically debated what caused electricity tobe produced in Volta’s pile, other scientists used it to conduct newexperiments.5 [029_BM029.xhtml#d312]Among these scientists was Hans Christian Oersted, who in 1820 discovered arelationship between electricity and magnetism. Oersted connected a wire to aVoltaic pile and then placed a magnetic compass under the wire. To Oersted’samazement, the compass needle was deflected only when he connected ordisconnected the wire from the pile. Oersted’s experiments were repeated byAndré-Marie Ampere, who established that it was a flow of charge—a current—thatwas interacting with the magnetism of the needle and causing motion. But whatwas the exact relationship between the current, magnetism, and motion?image [Images/PG_52_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 2.1. Faraday’s principle of electromagnetic induction.By moving the bar magnet in and out of the coil, Faraday was able to induce anelectrical current which would have caused the needles in the galvanometer toswing back and forth.From Hawkins Electrical Guide (New York: Theo. Audel, 1917), 1:131, fig. 130. In 1831, Michael Faraday answered this question. Using a donut-shaped coil ofwire and a bar magnet, Faraday demonstrated the laws of electromagneticinduction. Faraday showed that if one moved the magnet in and out of the donut,one could induce or generate a current in the donut coil. Conversely, if onesent a current through the coil, the magnet would move (Figure 2.1[011_Chapter011.xhtml#fig2_1]). However, to get either effect—to generatecurrent or produce motion—the configuration of the coil and the bar magnet hadto be at right angles with each other. In fact, the current induced would be ata third right angle, perpendicular to both the coil and the magnet. Engineerstoday refer to this as the right-hand rule (Figure 2.2[011_Chapter011.xhtml#fig2_2]).Faraday further realized the significance of Oersted’s observation that thecompass needle was deflected only when the current was turned on or off; whenthe current was passing steadily through the wire, there was no deflection.Faraday hypothesized that both the magnet and the electric coil were eachsurrounded by an electromagnetic field (often depicted as a series of forcelines) and that current or motion was produced when one of these fields waschanging. When one turned the current on or off in Oersted’s wire, one energizedor de-energized the field surrounding the wire, and this change interacted withthe magnetic field surrounding the compass needle, causing the needle to swing.As we shall see, this realization that a changing field can induce a current orproduce motion was essential for Tesla’s work on motors.image [Images/PG_52_img_1.jpg]FIGURE 2.2. Diagram illustrating the right-hand rule.Electrical engineers use this rule to remember how an electric current isinduced when a conductor is moved through a magnetic field. If a conductor (suchas the rod shown) moves in the direction of the thumb, it cuts the lines offorce of the magnetic field that are in the direction of the forefinger. Thecurrent produced will move in the conductor in the direction of the middlefinger.From Cyclopedia of Applied Electricity (1905), Part II, fig. 5, p. 9.During the middle decades of the nineteenth century, it proved difficult forscientists to fully appreciate the nuances of Faraday’s theory. However, bylooking at the small models that Faraday used to demonstrate his ideas,experimenters and instrument-makers quickly grasped the essence of his ideas andfashioned a variety of generators and motors. For these hands-on investigators,Faraday’s laws of electromagnetic induction boiled down to this: if one wantedto build an electric generator, then one moved a conductor through a magneticfield and a current was induced in the conductor. Likewise, if one wanted tomake an electric motor, then one used an electric current to produce anelectromagnetic field that would cause a magnet or conductor to move.6[029_BM029.xhtml#d313]In utilizing Faraday’s discoveries about induction, experimenters soon addedseveral new features to generators and motors. First, to generate electricity,they wanted to use rotary motion—from a hand crank or a steam engine.Conversely, they sought an electric motor that would use electric current toproduce rotary motion. Second, investigators came to desire electrical machinesthat either produced or consumed a current similar to that which came from abattery; they wanted to work with a current that possessed a steady voltage, orwhat is called direct current (DC). This fascination with DC may have beenfostered by the rapid development in the 1840s and 1850s of telegraph systemsthat sent signals by interrupting a direct current.To secure both of these features—rotary motion and direct current—electricalexperimenters utilized a commutator. In both generators and motors, there aregenerally two sets of electromagnetic coils: a fixed set known as the fieldcoils or the stator and a rotating set known as the rotor. A commutator issimply the device by which electric current moves into or out of the rotor.Introduced by Hippolyte Pixii in Paris in 1832, the commutator came to be anessential feature of DC motors and generators (Figure 2.3[011_Chapter011.xhtml#fig2_3]).image [Images/PG_54_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 2.3. Hippolyte Pixii’s magneto with the first commutator from 1832.The left image shows the magneto and the right image depicts the commutator indetail. To operate this magneto, one turned the crank in the bottom portion ofthe machine. This caused the horseshoe magnet to rotate underneath theelectromagnets at the top of the machine. As the horseshoe magnet moved, itsmagnetic field induced a current in the electromagnets. This current flowedthrough the wires on the vertical supports of the machine to the commutatorlocated on the shaft between the crank and the horseshoe magnet. The electriccurrent left the magneto via the two curly wires.As shown in the right image, the commutator was located on shaft A whichconnected the hand crank and gears on the bottom of the magneto with therotating magnet. The commutator consisted of two hollow cylindrical metal pieces(M1, M2) and four metal springs or brushes (F1, F2, f1, and f2). The pole piecesM1 and M2 were electrically insulated from each, as shown by the dark black linebetween them. S represents the current path of the two electromagnets at the topof the magneto while s represents the circuit outside the magneto.As shaft A rotated, the four brushes slid along the surface of the pole pieces.As the horseshoe magnet rotated, it induced a current in circuit S that wasdelivered to the commuatator via F1 and F2. The current leaving the magneto waspicked up by brushes f1 and f2. If the pole pieces M1 and M2 were properlypositioned on the shaft, then brushes f1 and f2 passed over the insulationbetween the pole pieces at exact moment when the direction of the current wasreversed in circuit S. In this way, the commutator converted the alternatingcurrent induced by horseshoe magnet in the electromagnets into a direct current.From Alfred Ritter von Urbanitzky, Electricity in the Service of Man (London,1886), figures 213 and 214 on pp. 228–229.image [Images/PG_55_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 2.4. Simplified view of an electric generator.N and S are magnetic poles of the stator. The rotor is shown as the square loopof wire attached to the shaft and crank. The commutator is the twohalf-cylinders located between the loop and the crank. If one turned the crank,the rotor would rotate through the magnetic field of the stator and analternating current would be induced in the rotor. This current would flow tothe commutator where it would be converted into a direct current.From S. P. Thompson, Dynamo-Electric Machinery, 3 ed. (1888), fig. 10 on p. 36.To understand how a commutator works, we need to look at the inner workings offirst a DC generator and then a motor (Figure 2.4[011_Chapter011.xhtml#fig2_4]). Following Faraday’s laws of electromagneticinduction, a generator produces current as the rotor spins and cuts across themagnetic field created by field coils. If we trace the path made by just oneloop in the rotor coil, we can see that when that loop swings down through themagnetic field it will induce a current that flows in one direction (asspecified by the right-hand rule in Figure 2.2 [011_Chapter011.xhtml#fig2_2]).Similarly, as the loop continues its rotation, it will then swing up through themagnetic field and induce a current that will flow in the opposite direction. Ifone wishes to utilize this alternating current (AC), then one simply connects anindividual slip ring to each end of the rotor loop and conducts the currents outof the generator. However, if like many nineteenth-century experimenters onewants a direct current, then one needs to collect all of the current flowing inone direction at one terminal of the generator and all of the current flowing inthe opposite direction at the other terminal. This is accomplished by placing onthe rotor shaft a commutator consisting of a metallic cylinder that is dividedinto segments insulated from each other (Figure 2.5[011_Chapter011.xhtml#fig2_5]). Stationary contacts or brushes rest on oppositesides of this cylinder and are positioned such that when the current generatedin the rotor reverses its direction, the connections with the brushes are alsoreversed and the current delivered by the generator is always in the samedirection.image [Images/PG_56_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 2.5. Simplified view of a commutator in an electric generator.The commutator consists of the four semi-circular pole pieces and the twohorizontal brushes. Normally, there would be insulation between the pole pieces,but it is not included in this diagram. In this view, the pole pieces areconnected to coils wound around a drum rotor. As the rotor rotates in a magneticfield (not shown), a current is induced in the coils and flows to the polepieces. The brushes, touching in the pole pieces, collect the current and carryit out of the generator.From S. P. Thompson, Dynamo-Electric Machinery, 3d ed. (1888), fig. 25 on p. 42.In a DC motor, a commutator works in much the same fashion but its job is todeliver current to the rotor. Through the commutator, we can imagine an electriccurrent flowing through a single loop in the rotor coil, and that currentcreates an electromagnetic field around that loop. At the same time, we can alsosend current through the field or stator coils of the motor and set up anotherelectromagnetic field. Now, if one can get the electromagnetic field surroundingthe rotor loop to be in the same direction as the field created by the statorcoils, then the two fields will push each other apart and cause the rotor toturn. (Recall that in magnets, opposite poles attract and similar poles repel.)However, as the loop swings around to the other side, it will need a currentflowing in an opposite direction in order to create a field that will berepulsed by the stator field. Hence, to get the rotor to rotate continuously, weneed to regularly reverse the current so that different portions of the rotorcoils will consistently have the proper field and be repulsed by the fieldcreated by stator coils. This current reversal is again provided by thecommutator, which functions as a rotary switch and sends current in theappropriate direction to each portion of the rotor coil.We have gone into some detail here about how commutators work in DC motors andgenerators because they are an essential element for rotating electricalmachines. Nonetheless, commutators were (and continue to be) the Achilles’ heelof DC machines; they were complicated to make and tended to wear out quickly.Commutators also often sparked if there was insufficient electrical insulationbetween the segments or if brushes were improperly adjusted and touched too manysegments at one time. As we shall see in a moment, Tesla decided early on thatcommutators were the central problem in electrical machinery and he set out toeliminate them.THE CHALLENGE OF SPARKING COMMUTATORSIt was during one of Pöschl’s lectures in 1876–77 that Tesla first confrontedthe challenge of developing an AC motor.7 [029_BM029.xhtml#d314] The school hadrecently acquired a Gramme generator or dynamo from Paris (Figure 2.6[011_Chapter011.xhtml#fig2_6]). Developed by Belgian instrument-maker Zenobe T.Gramme, this machine was exciting for electrical experimenters because itproduced a stronger and more steady direct current. By the end of the 1870s,Gramme dynamos were being used by several European inventors to power the firstcommercial arc-lighting systems.8 [029_BM029.xhtml#d315]Professor Pöschl used his new Gramme dynamo to teach his students aboutelectrical current. One popular use of the dynamo was demonstrating howelectricity could transmit power over a distance. This feature was firstrevealed at the International Exhibition in Vienna in 1873 by Hippolyte Fontaineof the Gramme Company. Fontaine used one Gramme dynamo to generate an electriccurrent that was then sent by wires to another dynamo, which served as a motor.9[029_BM029.xhtml#d316] Electricians were excited by this demonstration becauseit revealed the potential for using electric motors in factories andtransportation. Up to this point, electric motors had been limited because itwas believed they could only be powered by expensive batteries, but now Fontainehad shown that they could be run by dynamos. Moreover, Fontaine had demonstratedfor the first time that power could be transmitted from one place to anotherwithout having to use inefficient shafts, belts, or ropes to connect a steamengine with the machines. One could now have a system of power transmission inwhich one could generate electricity wherever convenient and then consume thepower wherever it was needed.image [Images/PG_58_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 2.6. Gramme generator for classroom demonstrations.From Alfred Ritter von Urbanitzky, Electricity in the Service of Man (London:Cassell, 1886), Fig. 232 on p. 251. To demonstrate the electrical transmission of power, Pöschl connected his Grammedynamo to a battery in order to run it as a motor.10 [029_BM029.xhtml#d317]Although one can run a DC generator as a motor, it does require carefuladjustment of the commutator brushes to prevent sparking. Pöschl had troubleadjusting the brushes on the Gramme dynamo, Tesla recalled: “While Prof. Pöschlwas making demonstrations, running the machine as a motor, the brushes gavetrouble, sparking badly, and I observed that it might be possible to operate amotor without these appliances. But he declared that it could not be done anddid me the honor of delivering a lecture on the subject, the conclusion of whichhe remarked: ‘Mr. Tesla may accomplish great things, but he certainly never willdo this. It would be equivalent to converting a steady pulling force, like thatof gravity, into a rotary effort. It is a perpetual motion scheme, an impossibleidea.’ ”11 [029_BM029.xhtml#d318]Although it may have been the good professor’s intent to prevent Tesla’scomments from distracting the other students from understanding how the motorworked, Pöschl used Tesla’s interruption to make a more general point.Nineteenth-century scientists and engineers were well aware that the rotarymotion needed to turn the machines of the Industrial Revolution was not readilyavailable in Nature. Many forces—such as gravity, magnetism, or electriccurrents—commonly manifest themselves as linear forces, in the sense that theyprovide pushes or pulls in a single direction. To secure the desired rotarymotion from these linear forces, one needed some sort of conversion device. Forexamples of these conversion devices, one need only look at how a waterwheeltransforms the linear flow of a river or how the crank and flywheel on a steamengine converts the back-and-forth motion of the piston into rotary motion. ForPöschl, the commutator served as a conversion device, converting the linearelectric current into a series of alternating pulses that caused the rotor torotate. Because these conversion devices always absorbed some of the energybeing converted from linear into rotary motion, Tesla’s idea of acommutator-less motor must have seemed to Pöschl that Tesla would be cheatingNature, and hence Pöschl derisively called it a perpetual motion scheme.Pöschl intended that his remarks should curb Tesla’s flights of fancy but theyinstead stoked the fires of ambition. In watching the brushes spark andlistening to Pöschl’s rebuke, Tesla sensed a challenge. “Instinct,” Tesla laterobserved, “is something which transcends knowledge. We have, undoubtedly,certain finer fibers that enable us to perceive truths when logical deduction,or any other willful effort of the brain is futile. For a time I wavered,imprest [sic] by the professor’s authority, but soon became convinced I wasright and undertook the task with all the fire and boundless confidence ofyouth.”12 [029_BM029.xhtml#d319]MENTAL ENGINEERING AN AC MOTORIn order to take up the challenge of building a spark-free motor, Teslaabandoned his plans to become a teacher and switched in his second year at theJoanneum to the engineering curriculum. As would have been typical forengineering schools in Europe and America in the late 1870s, this curriculumfocused not on electrical engineering but on civil engineering. When Tesla firstdescribed his education to reporters in the late 1880s, he stated that he hadbeen trained at the Joanneum as a civil engineer.13 [029_BM029.xhtml#d320]Though his engineering studies could have prompted Tesla to build a test modelof a motor and conduct experiments, he instead chose to investigate the problemin his imagination: “I started by first picturing in my mind a direct-currentmachine, running it and following the changing flow of the currents in therotor. Then I would imagine an alternator [an AC generator] and investigate theprocesses taking place in a similar manner. Next I would visualize systemscomprising motors and generators and operate them in various ways. The images Isaw were to me perfectly real and tangible.”14 [029_BM029.xhtml#d321]We see here that Tesla took two steps in conceptualizing his motor. First,although he started by thinking about a DC machine similar to the Gramme dynamo,he decided the solution would involve alternating current. One wonders why hemade this shift from DC to AC since most of the work being done in electricityin the late 1870s utilized direct current. In Paris, two electricians, PaulJablochkoff and Dieudonné François Lontin, were using AC to power several arclights on a single circuit, but it is not clear that Tesla would have knownabout their work as a student in Graz.15 [029_BM029.xhtml#d322]Instead of being inspired by existing machines, Tesla chose to use AC aftercarefully scrutinizing how a DC motor operated. As we discussed earlier, therotor in a DC motor turns because, at any given time, the current flowingthrough the rotor’s coils produces an electromagnetic field that opposes theelectromagnetic field set up by the stator coil. To keep the rotor rotating, thecommutator periodically reverses the current flowing through the rotor’swindings; just as a portion of the rotor rotates from one side of the stator’smagnetic field to the other, the commutator automatically reverses the currentso that the electromagnetic field in that portion of the rotor is repelled bythe stator field. Since the rotor’s field was regularly alternating in a motor,thought Tesla, why not use an alternating current, supplied from a generator, toproduce this field? By using AC, Tesla may have thought the commutator sparkingwould be reduced since the commutator would no longer need to reverse thecurrent it delivered to the rotor.Second, along with choosing to use AC in his motor, Tesla decided not to focuson just a motor but to “visualize systems comprising motors and generators.”Again, it is unclear how a second-year engineering student would know enough todo this in 1878. At that time, electrical inventors were building systems thatcombined dynamos and arc lights, but they did not describe what they were doingas designing systems. However, one can surmise that Tesla abstracted the idea oftreating the motor and generator as a system from what Pöschl may have toldTesla about the demonstration by Fontaine in Vienna. Fontaine had transmittedpower by linking a dynamo and motor together, and it was perhaps the challengeof linking these two devices that fascinated Tesla. Tesla was not interested inbuilding a motor that could be run by a battery; he wanted to create a motorthat could work efficiently with a generator. As we shall see, Tesla’s decisionto think in terms of systems meant that he was not locked into thinking aboutmotors in any particular way since he could manipulate not just parts of themotor but components of the system in which it resided. Thinking about the motoras part of a system proved to be central to his eventual success.But for all his mental manipulations, Tesla could not come up with a workablesystem. “I began to think about and to work on a machine made according to theidea that had occurred to me,” recalled Tesla. “Day and night, year after year,I worked incessantly.”16 [029_BM029.xhtml#d323]GROWING PAINSDuring his first year at the Joanneum, Tesla had been a diligent student. “I hadmade up my mind to give my parents a surprise,” wrote Tesla, “and during thewhole first year I regularly started my work at three o’clock in the morning andcontinued until eleven at night, no Sundays or holidays excepted. As most of myfellow-students took things easily, naturally enough I eclipsed all records. Inthe course of that year I past thru nine exams and the professors thought Ideserved more than the highest qualifications.”Armed with these flattering exam certificates, Tesla went home, excited to showhis father what he had accomplished. Milutin, however, criticized theseaccomplishments. “That almost killed my ambition,” said Tesla, but later, afterhis father had died, “I was pained to find a package of letters which theprofessors had written him to the effect that unless he took me away from theInstitution I would be killed thru overwork.” Frightened that he would lose hissecond son through overexertion, the father sought to dampen the young man’senthusiasm for study.17 [029_BM029.xhtml#d324]Milutin’s chastisement raised questions in Tesla’s mind as to whether there wasany emotional reward in studying so hard and that perhaps there was more to lifethan schoolwork. According to a former roommate, Kosta Kulišić, Tesla underwenta dramatic change in attitude toward the end of his second year at Graz. Oneday, Tesla encountered a member of one of the German cultural clubs who wasclearly jealous that a Serb was doing so well in his studies. Lightly tappingTesla on the shoulder with his cane, the German-speaking student said, “[W]hywaste time here; better go home and ‘warm the chair,’ so that profs can praiseyou even more.” In response to this challenge, Tesla did not go back to his roomto study but decided that he would show his fellow students that he couldcarouse just as well as they did. Tesla began hanging out with the otherstudents at the Botanical Gardens, where he stayed late smoking and drinkingcoffee to excess. He learned to play dominoes and chess and became anaccomplished billiards player. Most of all, though, he developed a passion forplaying cards and gambling. “To sit down to a game of cards,” Tesla later said,“was for me the quintessence of pleasure.”18 [029_BM029.xhtml#d325]Far more interested in carousing and gambling, Tesla returned to Graz in thefall of 1877 for a third year but stopped attending lectures, and universityrecords indicate that he was not registered for the spring of 1878. Thisundoubtedly contributed to the cancellation of his military scholarship. InSeptember 1878, Tesla wrote to a pro-Serbian newspaper in Novi Sad, the QueenBee, to ask for help in securing another scholarship in order that he mightcontinue his engineering studies in Vienna or Brno. Tesla told the newspaperthat he had to relinquish his military scholarship because of illness but thathe was now free “from that heavy obligation.” In terms of qualifications, Teslastated that he could now speak Italian, French, and English and he signed theletter “Nikola Tesla, technician.”19 [029_BM029.xhtml#d326]But the pro-Serbian group that published the Queen Bee turned down Tesla’srequest for a scholarship. Without telling his family, Tesla left Graz sometimein late 1878 and moved to Maribor in the Austrian province of Styria (todaySlovenia). Maribor was 45 miles (72 kilometers) from Graz and 185 miles (298kilometers) from his family in Gospić. In Maribor, Tesla found work as adraftsman in a tool and die shop run by a Master Drusko. In the evenings, Teslaspent his time in a pub called the Happy Peasant located near the train station.By chance, his old roommate Kulišić happened to pass through Maribor in January1879 and was surprised to find Tesla sitting in the Happy Peasant playing cardsfor money. Kulišić was relieved to find his friend alive as Tesla had been quitedepressed in Graz before he disappeared. When Kulišić asked him if he wanted togo back to Graz to complete his studies, Tesla responded coolly, “I like ithere; I work for an engineer, receive sixty forints a month, and can earn alittle more for every completed project.”20 [029_BM029.xhtml#d327]Kulišić left Tesla to his cards and engineering work but sent word to Tesla’sfamily in Gospić that Tesla was living in Maribor. In March 1879, Milutin wentto Maribor to plead with his son to come back and proposed that he might resumehis studies in Prague. Milutin was especially angry that his son had taken upgambling, an activity he regarded as a senseless waste of time and money. Whenconfronted by his father about his gambling, Tesla responded, “I can stopwhenever I please but is it worth while to give up that which I would purchasewith the joys of Paradise?” Tesla defied his father and refused to come home.Dejected, Milutin returned home and fell seriously ill.21 [029_BM029.xhtml#d328]A few weeks after his father’s visit, Tesla was arrested by the police inMaribor as a “vagrant” and deported to Gospić.22 [029_BM029.xhtml#d329]Heartbroken to see his son brought back by the police, Milutin passed away on 17April 1879 (Old Style) at the age of sixty. The next day, priests came from allover the region and gave Milutin a “funeral liturgy fit for a saint.”23[029_BM029.xhtml#d330]Not sure what to do, Tesla remained in Gospić after his father’s death andcontinued to gamble. Like his father, his mother, Djuka, was worried but sinceshe “knew that one’s salvation could only be brought about thru his ownefforts,” she took a different approach. One afternoon, when Tesla had lost allhis money but was still craving a game, she gave him a roll of bills, saying,“Go and enjoy yourself. The sooner you lose all we possess the better it willbe. I know that you will get over it.” In response to his mother, Tesla facedhis gambling addiction: “I conquered my passion then and there.… I not onlyvanquished but tore it from my heart so as not to leave even a trace ofdesire.”24 [029_BM029.xhtml#d331]Tesla eventually decided that he would honor his father’s wishes and go back toschool in Prague. To do so, he approached his maternal uncles, Petar and PavleMandic, who agreed to support him. Going to Prague made sense since Tesla hadnow decided to settle in Austria, and at the university in Prague he mightfurther study the languages he would need to make his way in the AustrianEmpire. In January 1880, Tesla moved to Prague to enroll in the Karl-FerdinandUniversity. Although he arrived too late to register for the spring term, hesigned up in the summer and attended lectures in mathematics, experimentalphysics, and philosophy.25 [029_BM029.xhtml#d332]Tesla also took a special course with Carl Stumpf titled “David Hume and theInvestigation of the Human Intellect.” Stumpf introduced Tesla to the concept ofthe mind as tabula rasa: that humans are born with a blank mind that is thenshaped through life by sensory perceptions. This corresponded to notions he hadalready started formulating about how his own imagination worked, and he wouldlater draw on Stumpf’s ideas to develop his automaton or radio-controlled boatin the 1890s (see Chapter 12 [021_Chapter021.xhtml]).26 [029_BM029.xhtml#d333]In Prague, Tesla continued to puzzle over the problem of making an electricmotor. “The atmosphere of that old and interesting city was favorable toinvention,” he remembered. “Hungry artists were plentiful and intelligentcompany could be found everywhere.”27 [029_BM029.xhtml#d334] Stimulated by thisenvironment, Tesla recalled, “I made a decided advance, which consisted indetaching the commutator from the machine and studying the phenomena in this newaspect, but still without result.”28 [029_BM029.xhtml#d335] His idea here was toplace the commutator on separate supports or arbors away from the frame of themotor, perhaps thinking that he could eliminate the sparking by increasing thedistance between the rotor and the commutator. Although this line of thinkingyielded no breakthrough, the process of envisioning these machines helped Teslaunderstand how motors worked. “Everyday I imagined arrangements on this planwithout result,” he noted, “but feeling that I was nearing a solution.”29[029_BM029.xhtml#d336]INSIGHT IN BUDAPESTWhile in Prague Tesla was supported by his maternal uncles, but they could notsupport him forever as a student. As one early biographical article put it, inPrague Tesla “began to feel the pinch, and to grow unfamiliar with the image ofFrancis Joseph the First,” the ruling Austrian emperor whose portrait appearedon the currency. Eventually, when the money from his uncles stopped arriving, he“became a very fair example of high thinking and plain living; but he made uphis mind to the struggle and determined to go through depending solely on hisown resources.”30 [029_BM029.xhtml#d337] In January 1881, Tesla left Prague andmoved to Budapest.Tesla chose Budapest because he had read in a Prague newspaper that TivadarPuskás had received permission from Thomas Edison to build a telephone exchangethere and that the project would be supervised by his brother, Ferenc. SinceFerenc had been a lieutenant in the Hussars, the light cavalry unit in which hisuncle Pavle served, Tesla asked his uncle to recommend him to Ferenc so that hecould get a job helping to build the new exchange.31 [029_BM029.xhtml#d338]The Puskás family was part of the Transylvanian nobility, and Tivadar hadstudied law and technical subjects as a young man. A promoter and entrepreneur,Tivadar had traveled to America looking for opportunities. After trying his handat gold mining in Colorado, he became interested in the telegraph andtelephone.32 [029_BM029.xhtml#d339] In 1877, Puskás visited Edison at Menlo Parkwhere he made quite an impression, arriving in a fancy carriage and flashing aroll of thousand-dollar bills. Edison took a liking to Puskás and showed him allof his current inventions, including the phonograph. Thrilled with everything hesaw, Puskás offered to take out patents in Europe for Edison’s telephone andphonograph at his own expense in return for a one-twentieth interest.33[029_BM029.xhtml#d340] With such a deal, one wonders whether Puskás was hustlingEdison or Edison was hustling Puskás. Puskás served as one of Edison’s agents inEurope for many years and was actively involved in promoting the telephone,phonograph, and electric light.Puskás proposed to Edison that he could establish telephone exchanges in majorEuropean cities. Up to this time, Edison and Alexander Graham Bell had beenmainly thinking about installing telephones on private lines to link twolocations, and Edison was intrigued by Puskás’s plan for an exchange in whichhundreds of subscribers could be connected with one another by means of aswitchboard.34 [029_BM029.xhtml#d341] With Edison’s blessing, Puskás set up atelephone exchange in Paris in 1879. Brother Ferenc helped with the Parisexchange and then traveled home to Budapest to establish an exchange there.But Ferenc Puskás was not able to hire Tesla at once. In all likelihood, it tookthe Puskás brothers some time to arrange the financing for the Budapestexchange. Instead, through the help of the Puskás brothers or other friends,Tesla was hired as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office of the Hungariangovernment. Although the weekly salary of five dollars was meager, the positiondid introduce Tesla to practical electrical work. “I soon won the interest ofthe Inspector-in-Chief,” Tesla later recalled, “and was thereafter employed oncalculations, designs, and estimates in connection with new installations.” YetTesla found much of the work boring, involving more routine drafting andcalculation than he liked. “By the time he had extracted several hundredthousand square and cube roots for the public benefit,” according to oneaccount, “the limitations, financial and otherwise, of the position had becomepainfully apparent.”35 [029_BM029.xhtml#d342]Dissatisfied with his position in the telegraph office, Tesla quit and decidedto concentrate on invention. Like many novice inventors, he was confident thathe could quickly develop a great invention that would support him. “He proceededat once to make inventions,” noted a later story, “but their value was visibleonly to the eye of faith and they brought no grist to the mill.”36[029_BM029.xhtml#d343] Frustrated, Tesla suffered a “complete breakdown of thenerves” and fell into a deep depression.37 [029_BM029.xhtml#d344]Convinced he was going to die, Tesla eventually recovered with the help of a newfriend, Anthony Szigeti. In Budapest, he came “in contact with a number of youngmen in whom I became interested. One of these was Mr. Sigety [sic], who was aremarkable specimen of humanity. A big head with an awful lump on one side and asallow complexion made him distinctly ugly, but from the neck down his bodymight have served for a statue of Apollo.” Szigeti “was an athlete ofextraordinary physical powers—one of the strongest men in Hungary. He dragged meout of the room and compelled me to make physical exercises … he saved mylife.”38 [029_BM029.xhtml#d345] Like Tesla, Szigeti enjoyed billiards, but hewas also interested in electrical matters and encouraged Tesla to continueconceptualizing his motor. With Szigeti’s help, Tesla gained[a] powerful desire to live and to continue the work.… My health returned andwith it the vigor of the mind.… When I undertook the task it was not with aresolve such as men often make. With me it was a sacred vow, a question of lifeand death. I knew that I would perish if I failed.… Back in the deep recesses ofthe brain was the solution, but I could not yet give it outward expression.39[029_BM029.xhtml#d346]To help Tesla recover his strength, Szigeti convinced Tesla to walk with himeach evening in the Városliget (City Park), and during these walks theydiscussed Tesla’s ideas for an improved motor. In his 1919 autobiography, Teslastated that the solution for his motor problem came to him during one of thesewalks as a Eureka moment:One afternoon, which is ever present in my recollection, I was enjoying a walkwith my friend in the City Park and reciting poetry. At that age I knew entirebooks by heart, word for word. One of these was Goethe’s “Faust.” The sun wasjust setting and reminded me of the glorious passage:The glow retreats, done is the day of toil;It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soilUpon its track to follow, follow soaring!A glorious dream! though now the glories fade.Alas the wings that lift the mind no aidOf wings to lift the body can bequeath me.As I uttered these inspiring words the idea came like a flash of lightning andin an instant the truth was revealed. I drew with a stick on the sand thediagrams shown six years later in my address before the American Institute ofElectrical Engineers [AIEE], and my companion understood them perfectly.40[029_BM029.xhtml#d347] The images were wonderfully sharp and clear and had thesolidity of metal and stone, so much so that I told him: “See my motor here;watch me reverse it.” I cannot begin to describe my emotions.41[029_BM029.xhtml#d348]Through Goethe’s imagery of the sun retreating and rushing forward and of theinvisible wings lifting the mind but not the body, Tesla envisioned the idea ofusing a rotating magnetic field in his motor.As dramatic as this story of sunsets and Goethe is, we must interpret thismoment carefully. Yes, it is the way that Tesla recounted the invention of hisAC motor in his 1919 autobiography, but in sworn patent testimony given in 1903,Tesla said nothing about having a Eureka moment with Szigeti in the park. From alegal standpoint, it would have been helpful to establish the moment ofinvention as taking place in 1882 since it would have buttressed Tesla’s claimsto have been the first to invent an AC motor.42 [029_BM029.xhtml#d349] Instead,Tesla’s patent testimony suggests that it took him time to work out all of hisideas. Moreover, given what Tesla seems to have known in 1882, it is not likelythat he understood in Budapest everything that he included in his 1888 AIEElecture.Nevertheless, it is clear that he had a major breakthrough in Budapest. Based onwhat he knew before Budapest and the experiments he did subsequently in 1883 and1887 (see Chapters 3 [012_Chapter012.xhtml] and 4 [013_Chapter013.xhtml]), hisbreakthrough consisted of three related insights. First, Tesla realized that hecould get the rotor in his motor to rotate not by delivering any current to itbut by taking advantage of induced eddy currents. Second, he realized that hecould induce the eddy currents in the rotor by creating a rotating magneticfield in the stator windings. And third, Tesla had a hunch that somehow therotating magnetic field could be produced using AC.To discuss these insights that Tesla had while walking in the park, it ishelpful to talk about a device frequently discussed in nineteenth-centuryelectricity texts, Arago’s wheel. Let me emphasize that there is no evidencethat Tesla knew about Arago’s wheel and used it in his thinking about motors,but this device can assist us in visualizing what Tesla accomplished inBudapest.43 [029_BM029.xhtml#d350]In 1824, the French scientist François Arago became fascinated by the curiousbehavior of a compass needle when one spun a copper disk underneath it. If thecopper disk was spun quickly enough, the compass needle not only stoppedpointing north but began to rotate as well (Figure 2.7[011_Chapter011.xhtml#fig2_7]). Shortly after Arago reported his discovery,Charles Babbage and Charles Herschel in England demonstrated the reversephenomenon: that if one rotated a horseshoe magnet underneath a pivoted copperdisk, the disk would spin. Natural philosophers were puzzled by Arago’s wheeland wondered about the relationship between magnetism and motion.image [Images/PG_69_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 2.7. Arago’s spinning disk (left) and Babbage and Hershel’s modification(right).From S. P. Thompson, Polyphase Electric Currents, 2 ed., (1900), figs. 315 and316 on p. 423. As with the puzzle of Oersted’s experiment, it was once again Faraday whoexplained the riddle of Arago’s wheel—its motion was caused by electromagneticinduction. By experiment, Faraday demonstrated that as the magnet rotatedunderneath the copper disk, the movement of the magnetic field induced swirls ofcurrent in the disk (Figure 2.8 [011_Chapter011.xhtml#fig2_8]). Calling themeddy currents, Faraday pointed out that these currents produced an electricfield opposite to the magnetic field, and as a result of this repulsion, thecopper disk moved.44 [029_BM029.xhtml#d351]Returning to Tesla, the first insight that he probably had in the park inBudapest was to realize that he did not have to deliver any current to the rotorin his motor. Just as eddy currents caused Arago’s copper disk to rotate, sothrough his own mental engineering Tesla realized that the magnetic field of thestator in his motor could induce eddy currents in the rotor and cause it torotate. Borrowing Goethe’s imagery, the induced currents were the invisiblewings that would lift the rotor and set it spinning.image [Images/PG_70_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 2.8. Eddy currents in a disk spinning in a magnetic field.From S. P. Thompson, Polyphase Electric Currents, 2d ed. (1900), fig. 319 on p.425.Since the currents would be induced in the rotor, there was no need to use acommutator to deliver currents to the rotor. Hence, he really could eliminatethe commutator and its sparking. Tesla’s decision not to feed currents into therotor was an important departure from prevailing practice since mostelectricians in the early 1880s assumed that one needed to have electromagnetsin both the rotor and stator in order to get a motor to produce any significantmechanical force or torque.45 [029_BM029.xhtml#d352]Once he knew that induced currents would cause the rotor to turn, Tesla camequickly to his second and most important insight: to produce currents in therotor, one needed a rotating magnetic field. Just as Babbage and Herschel hadrotated a horseshoe magnet underneath their copper disk, so Tesla now realizedthat the key to his motor would be to create a rotating magnetic field in thestator windings. As the magnetic field rotated around a copper disk rotor, itshould cause the disk to rotate.In arriving at this second insight, it is important to note that Tesla did so byreversing standard practice. Up to this time, most electrical experts haddesigned DC motors in which the magnetic field of the stator was kept constantand the magnetic poles in the rotor were changed by means of a commutator.Instead, Tesla chose to do the opposite: rather than changing the magnetic polesin the rotor, why not change the magnetic poles in the stator? Tesla saw that ifthe magnetic field in the stator rotated, it would induce an opposing magneticfield in the rotor and thus cause the rotor to turn. As we will see, thiswillingness to reverse standard practice—to be a maverick—was one of thehallmarks of Tesla’s style as an inventor.Unlike Babbage and Herschel, however, Tesla did not want to create a rotatingmagnetic field by mechanically turning a magnet underneath the rotor; aneffective motor converted electricity into motion, not motion into motion. Howthen could Tesla use an electric current to create a rotating magnetic field?This brings us to Tesla’s third insight in the park. Based on his extensivemental engineering, Tesla had a hunch that somehow one or more alternatingcurrents could be used to create a rotating magnetic field. If so, his thinkingwould have paralleled that of an English physicist, Walter Baily, who reportedin 1879 how he had used two electric currents to cause Arago’s wheel to rotate.Instead of a horseshoe magnet, Baily placed four electromagnets underneath hiscopper disk (see Figure 2.9 [011_Chapter011.xhtml#fig2_9]). Baily linked thecoils in series, joining one with the other diagonally across from it. He thenconnected each pair of electromagnets to a rotating switch that controlled thecurrent delivered from two separate batteries to the pairs of electromagnets. AsBaily rotated his switch, the electromagnets were sequentially energized tobecome either north or south magnetic poles, with the effect that the magneticfield underneath the copper disk rotated. As a scientist, Baily seems to havebeen satisfied to know that electric currents could be used to turn Arago’swheel, and he regarded his motor as a scientific toy.46 [029_BM029.xhtml#d353]Again, there is no evidence that Tesla knew about Baily’s motor when he was inBudapest in 1882. Rather, Baily’s motor helps us visualize the significantinsight that Tesla came to through his own mental engineering—that there must bea way to use one or more alternating currents to create a rotating magneticfield. Perhaps he came to this hunch about using alternating currents whilereflecting on Goethe’s imagery of the sun retreating and then rushing forward.Indeed, it is remarkable that Tesla came to this insight as a young man oftwenty-six using the power of his imagination and without reference to deviceslike Arago’s wheel and Baily’s motor.Thirty years later, when the patent litigation was all over and Tesla wroteabout the invention of his motor in Budapest, he insisted that the idea came tohim fully developed: “When an idea presents itself it is, as a rule, crude andimperfect. Birth, growth and development are phases normal and natural. It wasdifferent with my invention. In the very moment I became conscious of it, I sawit fully developed and perfected.… My imaginings were equivalent torealities.”47 [029_BM029.xhtml#d354]image [Images/PG_72_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 2.9. Baily’s electric motor, 1879.From S. P. Thompson, Polyphase Electric Currents, 2d ed., (1900), fig. 330 on p.438.However, despite these claims, it is not likely that Tesla understood everythingabout his AC motor at the time. In particular, he probably did not understandhow to actually use two or more alternating currents. Given that Tesla did nothave any firsthand experience building electrical machines before his walk inthe park, it is not likely that he would have known how to fashion a rotatingswitch such as Baily’s in order to control the current from two batteries.Equally important, I find it doubtful that Tesla—or any other electricalinventor, for that matter—understood in 1882 how several alternating currentswith different phases could create a rotating magnetic field.48[029_BM029.xhtml#d355] In many ways, the limits of Tesla’s breakthrough inBudapest only become clear when we examine closely the first motor that he builtin 1883 in Strasbourg (see Chapter 3 [012_Chapter012.xhtml]).Nonetheless, that walk in the park in Budapest was an intellectual turning pointfor Tesla. There, with Szigeti by his side, gazing into the sunset, Tesla didunderstand something about how a rotating magnetic field could be used in amotor. More than likely the vision was incomplete, but Tesla discerned enough toknow that he was on to something big. He had discovered the first grand ideal ofhis career and he fully intended to exploit it.The walk was an emotional turning point for Tesla, for he now knew his path. InBudapest, he had solved the problem posed by Pöschl’s sparking motor, and in sodoing, Tesla became convinced of his own creative powers. “I had carried outwhat I had undertaken and pictured myself achieving wealth and fame,” he laterwrote. “But more than all this was to me the revelation that I was an inventor.This was the one thing I wanted to be. Archimedes was my ideal. I [had] admiredthe works of artists, but to my mind, they were only shadows and semblances. Theinventor, I thought, gives to the world creations which are palpable, which liveand work.”49 [029_BM029.xhtml#d356]CREATIVE DESTRUCTION AND SUBJECTIVE RATIONALITYBefore we leave Tesla and Szigeti in the park, we should take a moment toreflect on the nature of Tesla’s insight that afternoon, not just from atechnical viewpoint but from a cognitive perspective as well. To do so we needto connect Tesla with the economist Joseph Schumpeter’s ideas about innovationand the creative destruction of capitalism.Schumpeter was fascinated by the role that innovation played in the moderneconomy, and he emphasized in his writings that there were two kinds ofinnovative activity. On the one hand, there are the creative responses ofentrepreneurs and inventors who introduce radically new products, processes, andservices and in so doing wreak the creative destruction that Schumpeter regardedas a central characteristic of capitalism. More recently, Clayton Christensenhas characterized Schumpeter’s creative responses as “disruptive innovations” inthe sense that selected firms sometimes pursue technologies that disrupt thepattern of established industries and alter the everyday life of consumers.50[029_BM029.xhtml#d357]On the other hand, there are the adaptive responses of managers and engineerswho undertake the steady and incremental work of establishing the corporatestructures, manufacturing procedures, and marketing plans that allow productsand services to be produced and consumed.51 [029_BM029.xhtml#d358] Clearly thesuccess of any economy—especially the United States in Tesla’s time, from 1870to 1920—has depended on getting the right mix of creative and adaptiveinnovations. Yet getting the right mix is neither automatic nor obvious, and soone of the great questions confronting historians of business and technology isunderstanding how creative and adaptive responses come together.Tesla’s creative insight in the park gives us an opportunity to develop a secondidea that Schumpeter had about innovation. He suggested that there were twokinds of thinking underlying the creative and adaptive responses ofentrepreneurs and managers, what he called two kinds of rationality. For thebusinessman or manager, there was objective rationality in the sense that themanager went out, looked at the market, measured demand, and acted accordingly;it was objective in the sense that the logic of what to do came from the world“out there.” In contrast, Schumpeter thought that entrepreneurs employedsubjective rationality; for them, the guiding logic came from within—from theirown thoughts, feelings, and wishes—and their actions were based on efforts toimpose this internal logic on the outside world.To explain subjective rationality, Schumpeter described a hypothetical encounterbetween a businessman and an efficiency engineer. Because the businessman paidattention to delivering what customers wanted, he had little interest in theengineer’s suggestions for improving the efficiency of his operation that werebased on theory and calculation. With his eye on the external signals from themarketplace, the businessman could not appreciate the internal logic of theengineer that drew on science and mathematics; at the same time, the engineerfailed to grasp the importance of consumer demand. “I mention this class ofcases,” Schumpeter concluded,not only because they are in themselves important and the source of muchinadequate interpretation, but also because at least the engineer’s rationalityis so excellent an example of subjective rationality and for the importance ofattending to it. [An] Engineer’s rationality turns on ends perceived with idealclearness. It goes about devising means by ideally rational and consciousefforts. It reacts promptly to a purely rational new impulse—e.g., a newcalculation published in a professional periodical. It is comparatively freefrom extraneous considerations. That is to say, it functions in a particular waybecause of the “conscious” quality of its intentional struggle forrationality.52 [029_BM029.xhtml#d359]In my view, one can easily substitute “inventor” for “engineer” in the abovequotation. Many inventors work from an internal logic that makes sense to themand they strive to manifest those internal ideas in terms of a new device.As Schumpeter rightly observes, we have not adequately interpreted the role thatsubjective rationality plays in economic life. Rather than trace how inventorsor entrepreneurs develop disruptive technologies, both scholars and laypeopleassume that the sources of new ideas are unknowable and we attribute them tointuition, genius, or “gut feelings.”However, Tesla’s career poses an opportunity to better understand what we meanby subjective rationality. Tesla’s vision of a rotating magnetic field came fromwithin himself, but it didn’t just come out of nowhere. Rather, the insight grewout of his ongoing mental engineering and was shaped by a rich stew of ideas,feelings, and impressions he had at the time. Maybe Schumpeter’sterm—rationality—isn’t the best word for it, but Tesla was doing some kind ofcognitive processing. But even more important, as we go forward with the story,we will see that what counts with subjective rationality is that inventors likeTesla come to believe in their ideas so strongly that they are willing torearrange the external world in order to make their ideals into reality. Inimposing their ideas on the world, inventors create the revolutionary technologythat unleashes the creative destruction of capitalism. But before that canhappen in Tesla’s case, he had to learn much more about the business ofelectrical technology."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREELEARNING BY DOING(1882–1886)ALTERNATING CURRENT AT GANZ AND COMPANYArmed with his insight about using a rotating magnetic field in his motor, Teslaresumed his mental engineering. “For a while,” he recalled fondly,I gave myself up entirely to the intense enjoyment of picturing machines anddevising new forms. It was a mental state of happiness about as complete as Ihave ever known in life. Ideas came in an uninterrupted stream and the onlydifficulty I had was to hold them fast. The pieces of apparatus I conceived wereto me absolutely real and tangible in every detail, even to the minutest marksand signs of wear. I delighted in imagining the motors constantly running, forin this way they presented to the mind’s eye a more fascinating sight. Whennatural inclination develops into passionate desire, one advances toward hisgoal in seven-league boots.1 [029_BM029.xhtml#d360]As Tesla enjoyed being in the creative flow of visualizing his ideal motor, hisefforts were greatly helped by what he learned about alternating current (AC)while working at or visiting the great manufacturing works of Ganz and Companyin Budapest in 1882.2 [029_BM029.xhtml#d361] Founded in 1844 by Abraham Ganz,this company had begun as an iron foundry specializing in wheels for railwaycars, cannons, and bullets. After Ganz’s death, the firm expanded into theproduction of water turbines and flour-processing equipment, and in 1878 itexpanded again into the new field of electric lighting. Under the direction ofKároly Zipernowsky, Ganz began building and installing systems that powered botharc and incandescent lamps. Hence, for a young man intrigued by electricity, theGanz works would have been an ideal place to work or just hang around.3[029_BM029.xhtml#d362]While Tesla was at the Ganz works, he noticed a broken ring transformer that layignored in one corner of the workshop. In all likelihood, this device had beenused to power arc lights in an AC series circuit. In a series circuit, if onelight failed, then all the lights went out; to overcome this problem, PaulJablochkoff had ingeniously installed a similar transformer in his lightingsystem in Paris so that power could be shunted around any defective lamp andkeep the other lamps burning. But while Jablochkoff had used a transformer withtwo coils wound around an iron cylinder, the broken transformer at Ganzconsisted of a large iron ring wound with two coils around either side.4[029_BM029.xhtml#d363] At some point, Zipernowsky and the other engineers atGanz began to study this ring transformer to figure out why it was not workingproperly. Over the next few years, investigations of devices like this ringtransformer led Zipernowsky, Ottó Bláthy, and Miksa Déri to develop one of thefirst AC power systems using transformers to distribute power over a wide area.(For further discussion, see Chapter 4 [013_Chapter013.xhtml].) Indeed, thefirst transformers installed in 1885 by Ganz and Company retained the ring shape(Figure 3.1 [012_Chapter012.xhtml#fig3_1]).But in 1882 Tesla did not know that Zipernowsky, Bláthy, and Déri would pioneerAC transmission. Instead, for Tesla the broken ring transformer was a wonderfuldevice to watch and ponder. While the ring was being powered by an AC generator,Tesla, in a moment of curiosity, placed a metal ball on the wooden surface onthe top of the ring transformer. To his delight, the ball began to spin whilethe current was being applied. As he watched the ball spin, Tesla deduced thatbecause the coils varied in their windings, they produced two differentalternating currents.5 [029_BM029.xhtml#d364] As we saw with Baily’s motor inthe last chapter, these two currents created a rotating magnetic field that inturn caused the ball to spin. Here was confirmation of the hunch Tesla had hadwhile walking in the park with Szigeti: that alternating current could createthe rotating magnetic field he wanted for his motor.image [Images/PG_78_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 3.1. First transformers developed by Zipernowsky, Bláthy, and Déri in1884–1885 in the Museum of Applied Arts, Budapest.Source: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ZBD.jpg.To be sure, the ball spinning on the top of the broken ring transformer did notreveal to Tesla how to control several alternating currents so that they createda rotating magnetic field; again, the spinning ball only confirmed that Tesla’sideal of the motor was possible. Tesla would spend the next five years acquiringthe knowledge and skill necessary to get electricity to do his bidding. But aswe shall see, during this time of learning, the spinning ball and ringtransformer became a key way that Tesla represented his ideal. Whenever hethought about or had the chance to experiment with his new motor, he would use asimilar ring wound with several coils and in the middle of the ring he wouldplace different metal objects hoping that they, too, would spin in the rotatingmagnetic field.6 [029_BM029.xhtml#d365]JOINING THE EDISON ORGANIZATION IN PARISTesla’s musings about spinning balls and rotating magnetic fields, however, cameto an abrupt halt when Ferenc Puskás was finally able to hire him to helpinstall the new telephone exchange. Tesla threw himself into improving theexchange and even developed a new telephone repeater or amplifier.7[029_BM029.xhtml#d366]Once the Budapest exchange was up and running, Ferenc Puskás sold it to localbusinessmen for a profit. While the Budapest exchange was being built TivadarPuskás had remained in Paris to help introduce Edison’s incandescent lightingsystem. Tivadar now invited Tesla and Szigeti to come to Paris and got them jobswith the Edison organization (Figure 3.2 [012_Chapter012.xhtml#fig3_2]).8[029_BM029.xhtml#d367]Because French law required that any inventions patented in France must also bemanufactured there, Edison had sent his closest associate, Charles Batchelor, toFrance in 1881 to organize a company for manufacturing and installing Edisonlighting systems. Imitating how the Edison lighting organization was structuredin America, Batchelor established three separate companies in France: theCompagnie Continentale Edison (which controlled the patents); the SociétéIndustrielle & Commerciale (which manufactured equipment); and the SociétéElectrique Edison (which installed the systems). To manufacture incandescentlamps and dynamos, Batchelor built a factory in Ivry, on the outskirts ofParis.9 [029_BM029.xhtml#d368] Tesla appears to have been employed primarily bythe Société Electrique Edison (SE Edison).10 [029_BM029.xhtml#d369]image [Images/PG_79_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 3.2. Tesla when he was in Paris, 1883. From NTM. Working at the Edison works in Ivry, Tesla acquired a great deal of practicalengineering knowledge about dynamos and motors. Up to this point, Tesla had donemostly mental engineering, visualizing in his mind how an AC motor might ideallywork. Now Tesla learned firsthand the problems of converting mental inventionsinto real machines. In order to create a working dynamo or motor, one had tothink carefully about the proper proportions for the rotor and stator coils; tosecure a particular current output, one had to plan the length and diameter ofthe coils, the gauge and number of turns of wire, and the speed by which themachine would rotate. In the early 1880s, none of this information had beencodified into formulae or design rules; rather, the design of electricalmachines was based on trial and error and craft knowledge. Working for theEdison organization, Tesla learned much of what was then known about dynamo andmotor design, and this knowledge put him in a position to start thinking aboutconverting his ideal motor into a real machine.While Tesla acquired engineering know-how from the Edison organization, he alsomade his own contribution to the company. Most of the Edison men had learnedabout electrical machines by working either in the telegraph industry or inmachine shops, and few had any formal schooling in science or mathematics.11[029_BM029.xhtml#d370] In contrast, Tesla had received a thorough education inphysics and mathematics at Graz, and the French manager of SE Edison, R. W.Picou, recognized Tesla’s ability to apply theory and make calculations. Shortlyafter joining the company, Tesla was put to work designing dynamos forincandescent lighting installations and was paid three hundred francs a month.12[029_BM029.xhtml#d371]While at the Edison works at Ivry, Tesla continued to think about his ideas fora motor. “We were together almost constantly in Paris in the year 1882,” Szigetilater testified, and “Mr. Tesla was much excited over the ideas which he thenhad of operating motors.”13 [029_BM029.xhtml#d372] One evening, he outlined hisplans for an AC motor to Szigeti and four or five Edison men by drawing diagramsin the dirt with a stick. Picking up on his insight in Budapest that severalalternating currents should be able to produce a rotating magnetic field, Tesladescribed to his Edison colleagues an elaborate system in which the generatorproduced three separate alternating currents that were delivered to the motorover six different wires (see Figure 3.3 [012_Chapter012.xhtml#fig3_3]). In hissubsequent patents and lectures, Tesla explained that these three alternatingcurrents would have to be out of phase with each other by 120° in order tocreate a rotating magnetic field, but there is nothing to indicate that heunderstood in 1882 the significance of having the currents out of phase. “Myidea,” Tesla explained, “was that the more wires I used the more perfect wouldbe the action of the motor.”14 [029_BM029.xhtml#d373]image [Images/PG_81_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 3.3. Diagram from later Tesla patent showing his system in which thegenerator produced three separate alternating currents that were delivered tothe motor over six different wires.Figure 13 in U.S. Patent 381,968, “Electric Magnetic Motor,” (granted 1 May1888).Tesla was disappointed that the Edison men were not impressed by his invention.From a commercial standpoint, they were probably not interested because they sawthe major opportunities in developing a system for electric lighting and nottransmitting power to run electric motors. It was only after 1886 that otherelectrical pioneers such as Frank Sprague were able to convince central stationengineers that they could provide electricity for both lighting and motors.15[029_BM029.xhtml#d374]But from a technical standpoint, Tesla’s six-wire scheme probably seemedwrongheaded to these men, not because it used AC but because it would use toomuch copper in the multiple wires. One of the major concerns faced by the Edisonorganization in the early 1880s was developing distribution systems that used aslittle copper as possible. Because the copper wiring was often the largest costin a new installation, Edison himself devoted substantial effort to evolvingmore economical wiring schemes. In the early 1880s, Edison introduced histhree-wire system to replace his feeder-and-main system. In contrast to Edison’sthree-wire system, Tesla’s proposed six-wire system probably looked uneconomicalin terms of the copper wiring it would require. Of course, electrical systemsusing AC can operate on higher voltages and hence have smaller conductors, butit is not clear that Tesla or the Edison men would have understood this in 1882.Only one Edison man, David Cunningham, a superintendent of the Edison LampWorks, showed any interest in Tesla’s invention. Edison had sent Cunninghamoverseas to help Batchelor install equipment at the International ElectricalExhibition in Paris in 1881, and Cunningham stayed on to supervise dynamobuilding at Ivry. Cunningham, Tesla recalled, “offered to form a stock company.The proposal seemed comical in the extreme. I did not have the faintestconception of what that meant except that it was an American way of doingthings.” Nothing came of the proposal, and in 1883 Tesla was sent by the companyto work as a troubleshooter at different lighting stations in France andGermany.16 [029_BM029.xhtml#d375]In between these traveling assignments, Tesla found time to develop an automaticregulator for the Edison dynamos, and his plan impressed Louis Rau, thepresident of SE Edison.17 [029_BM029.xhtml#d376] Consequently, when the companyneeded to send an expert to solve problems at a new station in Strasbourg inAlsace, it chose Tesla.A MOTOR IN STRASBOURGAt Strasbourg, SE Edison was attempting to install an incandescent lightingsystem in the new railroad station. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71,Strasbourg had changed from French to German hands. After the war, the GermanEmpire established its presence in Strasbourg by erecting a series ofsubstantial new public buildings, including a new central railroad station.18[029_BM029.xhtml#d377] According to Tesla, the German authorities were quiteupset with the Edison Company since the wiring in the plant had short-circuitedand blown out a large part of a wall during a visit to the train station byEmperor Wilhelm I.19 [029_BM029.xhtml#d377a] To placate the Germans, the companyneeded to send a German-speaking engineer to finish wiring the new plant. Givenhis language skills, Tesla was sent to Strasbourg in October 1883 to reinstallthe wiring and deal with the upset Germans. To help with this work, Teslabrought Szigeti with him as his assistant.20 [029_BM029.xhtml#d378]At Strasbourg, Tesla found that SE Edison was installing a large and ambitioussystem. The system consisted of four generators that powered twelve hundredlamps. In addition to the Edison equipment, the German electrical manufacturerSiemens & Halske was installing five DC generators and sixty arc lights. Thewiring for both the incandescent and arc lights was placed in undergroundconduits, and since this was a relatively new practice, it was probably thecause of the problems that Tesla had to solve.21 [029_BM029.xhtml#d379]Tesla was soon working night and day on the Edison system, but he found time toconduct experiments on his AC motor. Included in the railway station’selectrical powerhouse was a Siemens AC generator that had probably been used topower an earlier arc-lighting system with Jablochkoff candles.22[029_BM029.xhtml#d380] With Szigeti’s help, Tesla constructed a small motor thatcould be powered by the Siemens AC generator. Anxious to keep the motor asecret, Tesla and Szigeti tested it in a closet where they could tap the ACcircuit.23 [029_BM029.xhtml#d381]For this motor, Tesla made the stator by winding insulated wire around theoutside of an oblong brass ring (see Figure 3.4[012_Chapter012.xhtml#fig3_4]).24 [029_BM029.xhtml#d382] The stator’s windingswere connected to the Siemens generator. For the armature, Szigeti made afive-inch iron disk that was mounted on a horizontal axle.25[029_BM029.xhtml#d383] According to Tesla’s mental engineering, the AC from thegenerator should produce a rotating magnetic field in the stator. In turn, therotating field would induce currents in the disk; the induced currents would berepelled by the rotating field and thus the disk would rotate. “It was,” Teslaclaimed, “the simplest motor I could conceive of. As you see it had only onecircuit, and no windings on the armature or the fields. It was of marveloussimplicity.”26 [029_BM029.xhtml#d384]image [Images/PG_83_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 3.4. Diagram of AC motor that Tesla built in Strasbourg in 1882.This motor consisted of a disk-shaped iron rotor (D) that was mounted on ashaft. The stator (F, F) was two coils of insulated wire mounted on brass rings.Tesla connected the stator to an AC generator and he initially assumed that theAC would produce a rotating magnetic field and induce eddy currents in therotor. However, since the stator coils were wrapped around brass rings that didnot magnetize, Tesla was forced to jam a steel file in the coil [this would havebeen the equivalent of C or C’ in the diagram]. The AC then magnetized the fileand induced eddy currents in the disk; since the filed produced by the eddycurrents was in the opposite direction to the magnetic field in the file, thedisk rotated. Tesla patented a more elaborate version of this motor and thisdiagram is from that patent.See, NT, “Electro-Magnetic Motor,” US Patent 424,036 (filed 20 May 1889, granted24 March 1890).As simple as it was, this motor did not work when Tesla first tried it. When heheld the stator coil around the disk, the disk did not turn because he had woundthe stator coil around a brass core that could not be magnetized.27[029_BM029.xhtml#d385] To overcome this difficulty, Tesla jammed a steel file inthe coil. Now the alternating current produced a magnetic field in the steelfile that in turn induced currents in the iron disk. But still the disk did notrotate and so Tesla tried the file in different positions relative to the disk.Eventually he found a position where the magnetic field in the file and theinduced currents in the disk were in the same direction, so that they repelledeach other and caused the disk to slowly rotate. Tesla was thrilled to see thedisk turn: “I finally had the satisfaction of seeing rotation effected byalternating currents of different phase, and without sliding contacts orcommutator, as I had conceived a year before. It was an exquisite pleasure butnot to compare with the delirium of joy following the first revelation.”28[029_BM029.xhtml#d386]The Strasbourg motor was an important turning point for Tesla because this motortempered his idealized thinking with a strong dose of practicality. Prior tothis motor, Tesla had performed only mental engineering and had taken forgranted that what he could conjure in his mind’s eye could be easily made towork in the real world. In Strasbourg, Tesla realized for the first time thatmaterials count—the core of the stator needed to be made of iron or steel, notbrass. Even though he later insisted that he was able to design perfect machinesin his head that would then run flawlessly when built, it is clear that, likeall inventors, he ran into problems when it came time to convert his ideals intoworking devices.29 [029_BM029.xhtml#d387]While in Strasbourg, Tesla again tried to secure financial backing for hisinvention. Through his work at the Edison plant, Tesla became acquainted with M.Bauzin, a former mayor of the city. According to Tesla, Bauzin “conceived agreat attachment” for Tesla and consequently Tesla revealed to him that hepossessed “an invention which would revolutionize the dynamo-machine industry.”Bauzin consulted with a wealthy local businessman, Benjamin, but Benjamindeclined to invest in Tesla’s invention. Bauzin then offered to loan Teslatwenty-five thousand francs that Tesla could repay when he had succeeded inperfecting his motor. Tesla, however, wanted Bauzin to come in as his partner,probably in order to share in the long-term profits that Tesla hoped would comefrom the invention. Not knowing anything about electricity or inventions, Bauzindeclined to join Tesla as a partner, and so Tesla left Strasbourgdisappointed.30 [029_BM029.xhtml#d388]BACK TO PARIS, ON TO NEW YORKTesla returned to Paris in February 1884, expecting to receive a bonus from theEdison Company for solving the problems with the Strasbourg plant. Disappointedwhen this reward did not materialize, Tesla tried to interest a few Parisians insupporting the development of his motor, but again nothing came of this effort.However, Tesla’s work on improving dynamos had caught the eye of CharlesBatchelor, who had been head of the French Edison companies. In the spring of1884, Batchelor was recalled by Edison in order to manage the Edison MachineWorks in New York. Intent on improving the dynamos produced at the Edison works,Batchelor requested that Tesla come to America and continue his dynamo workthere. To help smooth his entry into the Edison organization in New York, Teslasecured a letter of introduction from Tivadar Puskás addressed to Edison, whichstated, “I know two great men and you are one of them; the other is this youngman.”31 [029_BM029.xhtml#d389]Tesla sailed to New York on the City of Richmond and arrived on 6 June 1884. Aswas the case with many immigrants, the customs officer had trouble understandingthe nervous young man in front of him, and he recorded Tesla as a native ofSweden when in all likelihood he had told the officer his birthplace wasSmiljan. Years later he recalled that process of formally entering the UnitedStates consisted of a clerk barking at him, “Kiss the Bible. Twenty cents!”32[029_BM029.xhtml#d390]Having lived in the cosmopolitan cities of Prague, Budapest, and Paris, Teslawas initially shocked by the crudeness and vulgarity of America. As he wrote inhis autobiography, “What I had left was beautiful, artistic, and fascinating inevery way; what I saw here was machined, rough, and unattractive. A burlypoliceman was twirling his stick which looked to me as big as a log. Iapproached him politely, with the request to direct me [to an address]. ‘Sixblocks down, then to the left,’ he said, with murder in his eyes. ‘Is thisAmerica?’ I asked myself in painful surprise. ‘It is a century behind Europe incivilization.’ ”33 [029_BM029.xhtml#d391]But Tesla did not dwell on the contrasts between Europe and America, for he wassoon busy making a place for himself in the New York Edison organization. Justas he had in Paris, he sought out work as a troubleshooter. The Edisonorganization had just installed two dynamos in the S.S. Oregon, which at thetime held the Blue Riband for being the fastest transatlantic passenger ship.Unfortunately the dynamos failed, delaying the ship from departing as scheduledfrom New York. Drawing on his experience troubleshooting lighting stations inEurope, Tesla volunteered to take a work crew to the Oregon and make the neededrepairs. Working through the night, Tesla and his crew put the dynamos back inorder; the Oregon departed New York on 7 June 1884, going on to set a new recordfor its eastbound run.34 [029_BM029.xhtml#d392]Upon returning to Edison’s offices in Manhattan at 5 a.m. the next morning,Tesla chanced to meet Edison, Batchelor, and a few other men who were just goinghome. According to Tesla, Edison said, “Here is our Parisian running around atnight.” In response, Tesla told Edison that he had just finished repairing thedynamos on the Oregon. Edison walked away in silence, but when he thought he wasout of Tesla’s earshot he remarked, “Batchellor [sic], this is a d—n good man.”Having impressed Edison, Tesla started work at the Edison Machine Works on 8June, only two days after arriving in America.35 [029_BM029.xhtml#d393]At the Edison Machine Works, Tesla set to work redesigning Edison’s long-leggedMary-Ann dynamos, replacing their long magnets with more efficient short-coredesigns. Tesla claimed that his improved dynamos produced three times as muchoutput using the same amount of iron. Although Tesla worked long hours at theMachine Works, from 10:30 in the morning until 5:00 the next morning, he tooktime to enjoy good meals and a game of billiards. Not knowing that Tesla hadplayed billiards as a student, Edison’s personal secretary, Alfred O. Tate,noted that “He played a beautiful game. He was not a high scorer but his cushionshots displayed skill equal to that of a professional exponent of this art.”36[029_BM029.xhtml#d394]While at the Edison Machine Works, Tesla continued to think about his AC motor,but he did not attempt to develop it. Perhaps recalling how the Edison men inParis had been indifferent to his ideas, Tesla chose to keep silent. On oneoccasion, Tesla almost told Edison about his motor. “It was on Coney Island,”Tesla recalled, “and just about as I was going to explain it to him, some onecame and shook hands with Edison. That evening, when I came home, I had a feverand my resolve rose up again not to speak freely about it to other people.”37[029_BM029.xhtml#d395]image [Images/PG_87_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 3.5. Group of men standing in front of the Edison Machine Works on GoerckStreet in New York around the time that Tesla worked there. Tesla is not in thegroup. From NTM. After working on the design of dynamos, Tesla was next asked to help develop anarc-lighting system. In the mid-1880s, the Edison organization was interested inhaving its own arc-lighting system in order to compete with its majorcompetitors, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, the Brush Electric LightCompany, and the United States Electric Lighting Company. These rivals had grownup manufacturing and installing arc lighting, and they then expanded theirproduct line by adding incandescent lighting systems. While Edison’sincandescent lighting system was suitable for lighting the interiors of homesand offices, it was not particularly effective for outside or street lighting.Consequently, as towns and cities set up new central stations for providingelectric lighting for both streets and homes, the Edison organization lostcontracts to Thomson-Houston or Brush since these firms could install both arcand incandescent lights.In response to this competitive need, Edison designed an arc lamp and filed apatent for it in June 1884. Tesla recalled that Edison gave him the basic planfor this arc-lighting system but left it up to him to work out the details.38[029_BM029.xhtml#d396] Tesla developed a complete system, and again he expectedto be handsomely rewarded for his efforts. However, once the system wascompleted, it was never put into use.In all likelihood, Edison and his company shelved the Tesla system for businessand technical reasons. At this time, the Edison organization was struggling withthe problem of marketing and installing central stations. The difficulty wasthat most of the new local utility companies that wished to purchase electriclighting systems lacked the capital to purchase the system and the technicalexpertise to install the equipment; in response, electrical manufacturersexperimented with various marketing schemes whereby they could help customersbuy their systems while minimizing their financial risk.39[029_BM029.xhtml#d397] After supervising the building of power stations throughthe Thomas A. Edison Construction Department (and losing money in the process),Edison decided in early 1885 to leave the problems of installing his system toothers. Consequently, his organization entered into an agreement with Edward H.Goff and the American Electric Manufacturing Company (AEM). Goff had made a namefor himself promoting and building arc-lighting stations, and he wished toexpand into the incandescent lighting market. The Edison organization and AEMstruck a deal whereby when AEM saw an opportunity to install an incandescentlighting system it would sell the local utility an Edison system; in return,when the Edison organization wanted to install an arc-lighting system, it woulduse the system invented by James J. Wood and owned by AEM.40[029_BM029.xhtml#d398] In negotiating with Goff, the Edison organization mayhave been able to use Tesla’s arc system and Edison’s arc-lighting patents asbargaining chips in order to negotiate favorable terms. Once this deal wentthrough, however, the Edison organization no longer had any need for the arcsystem developed by Tesla.A second reason why the Edison organization did not utilize Tesla’s arc-lightingsystem was that other engineers in the company had developed an incandescentlighting alternative. Called the municipal system, this alternative could beused for street lighting since it used larger incandescent lamps that wereplaced on a high-voltage series circuit.41 [029_BM029.xhtml#d399] Thus, when thearc-lighting project was shelved, Tesla went unrewarded and he quit in disgust.As his last notebook entry at Edison, he scrawled, “Good by [sic] to the EdisonMachine Works!” Altogether, Tesla worked for the Edison Machine Works in NewYork for six months.42 [029_BM029.xhtml#d400]ARC LIGHTING IN RAHWAYOnce again on his own, Tesla was not without resources. No sooner had Tesla leftthe Edison organization than he was approached by Benjamin A. Vail from Rahwayand Robert Lane, a businessman from East Orange, New Jersey. A descendant of anold Quaker family, Vail had studied at Haverford College and established a lawpractice in Rahway. Active in the state’s Republican Party, Vail served on theRahway town council in 1875 and was elected to both the New Jersey Assembly andSenate.43 [029_BM029.xhtml#d401] Excited by the prospects of electric lighting,Vail and Lane were keen to enter this new field. In December 1884, Vail and Lanehired Tesla and they organized the Tesla Electric Light and ManufacturingCompany. Although the company could issue stock for up to $300,000, it beganwith Vail subscribing $1,000 and another $4,000 from other investors inRahway.44 [029_BM029.xhtml#d402]Drawing on what he had learned while working for Edison, Tesla proposed thatthis company develop its own arc-lighting system. While we tend to assume thatthe electrical industry grew up around Edison’s incandescent lamp, in realitythe fastest-growing segment of the electrical industry in the mid-1880s was arclighting. According to one commentator, the number of arc lights installeddoubled every year between 1881 and 1885. Although the industry was dominated bythe Brush and Thomson-Houston companies, there were also numerous new, small,start-up companies; by 1886, there were at least forty firms manufacturingarc-lighting systems. Across the country, dozens of businessmen like Vail andLane were intrigued by the new electrical industry, and they established newcompanies to manufacture arc-lighting equipment.45 [029_BM029.xhtml#d403]To help his new company enter the arc-lighting field, in the spring of 1885Tesla prepared patent applications covering improvements in generators, arclamps, and regulators. While his arc lamp and regulator were similar to thoseinvented by Charles Brush and Elihu Thomson, his generator incorporated severalimprovements that reduced energy losses arising from heat and eddy currents.46[029_BM029.xhtml#d404] For help in filing these patents, Tesla turned to LemuelW. Serrell, Edison’s chief patent attorney in New York. While working on thesepatents applications, Tesla was paid $150 per month. Tesla contemplated tryingto convince Vail and Lane that he could develop other electrical inventions(such as his AC motor), but he soon realized that they were only interested inarc lighting (Figure 3.6 [012_Chapter012.xhtml#fig3_6]).Like other early arc-lighting entrepreneurs, Vail and Lane anticipated thatprofits could come from both manufacturing equipment and running lightingsystems. Consequently, they secured a corporate charter to permit them to doboth.47 [029_BM029.xhtml#d405] Through 1885, Tesla worked to both manufacturehis system and run it from a central station. Tesla was probably assisted bySzigeti as well as by a young man, Paul Noyes, whom he recruited from the GordonPress Works in Rahway.48 [029_BM029.xhtml#d406]By 1886, Tesla’s system was being used in Rahway to light some of the town’sstreets and several factories. The company received favorable notice from theNew York trade journal Electrical Review, which published a front-page featureabout the Tesla system in August 1886. In return, the Tesla company ranadvertisements in Electrical Review announcing “the most perfect Automatic,Self-regulating system of electric arc lighting yet produced.”49[029_BM029.xhtml#d407]image [Images/PG_90_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 3.6. Tesla in 1885.From KSP, Smithsonian Institution.As the patents for his arc-lighting system were granted, Tesla assigned them tothe Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company in return for stock shares.However, once the system was completed, Vail and Lane abandoned Tesla andcreated a new firm, the Union County Electric Light and Manufacturing Company.Perhaps Vail and Lane decided to exit the manufacturing side of the arc-lightingindustry because that side of the business was becoming both highly competitiveand capital intensive. By the end of the decade, the manufacture of arc-lightingequipment was dominated by a single firm, Thomson-Houston. Instead, Vail andLane chose to concentrate on operating as a lighting company for Rahway and thesurrounding county. In this situation, Tesla’s role as inventor was superfluoussince Vail and Lane did not need to improve the system in order to becompetitive in the utility business.50 [029_BM029.xhtml#d408] Having assignedthe patents to the company, Tesla was left in a position where he could nolonger use his own inventions. All he had to show for his efforts in Rahway was“a beautifully engraved certificate of stock of hypothetical value.”51[029_BM029.xhtml#d409]Abandoned by his business patrons in Rahway, Tesla fell on hard times and wasunable to find work as an engineer or inventor. After several jobs repairingelectrical equipment, he was reduced to working as a day laborer, diggingditches. “I lived through a year of terrible heartaches and bitter tears, mysuffering being intensified by material want,” Tesla recalled years later,feeling that “my high education in various branches of science, mechanics, andliterature were [sic] a mockery.”52 [029_BM029.xhtml#d410]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURMastering Alternating Current(1886–1888)A THERMOMAGNETIC MOTORIn the midst of hardship, Tesla mustered the energy needed to file a patentapplication for a thermomagnetic motor in March 1886. Just as his arc-lightinginventions saved him after he left Edison, so this new application helped himget back on his feet.It is likely that Tesla got to thinking about the relationship between magnetismand heat while working at the Edison Machine Works since Edison was thenexperimenting with a pyromagnetic generator that would directly produceelectricity from burning coal. In one dramatic experiment in 1884, Edison heatedcoal until it incandesced and then introduced a gas that he hoped would beionized by the glowing coal. Although Edison obtained a very strong current, thegas exploded and blew out his laboratory’s windows.1 [029_BM029.xhtml#d411]Perhaps taking heed of Edison’s disaster with overheated coal, Tesla initiallyfocused on the fact that iron magnets lose their magnetic strength when they areheated. To take advantage of this phenomenon, Tesla designed a small motorconsisting of a magnet, iron pivoting arm, spring, Bunsen burner, and flywheel(Figure 4.1 [013_Chapter013.xhtml#fig4_1]). At a normal temperature, the fixedmagnet was sufficiently strong to pull the pivot arm and compress the spring.However, when the pivot arm was pulled toward the fixed magnet, it came withinthe flame of the Bunsen burner. The flame heated the pivot arm and caused it tolose the magnetism induced in it by the fixed magnet. The force of thecompressed spring was now greater than the force of the magnetic field, causingthe pivot arm to swing away from the fixed magnet. Because the pivot arm wasconnected by a crank to the flywheel, the motion of the pivot arm caused theflywheel to turn. As the pivot arm swung out of the flame, it cooled and wasagain attracted to the magnet. Now the strength of the magnetic field wasgreater than the force of the spring, thus causing the pivot arm to swing backtoward the fixed magnet and the flame. In his patent application, Tesla outlinednot only the basic principle of this motor but also seven variations.2[029_BM029.xhtml#d412]image [Images/PG_93_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 4.1.

Martin, The Inventions, Researches, and Writings of Nikola Tesla, 2ded. (1894; reprinted 1995), Fig. 240 on p. 428.RESCUE BY PECK AND BROWNTesla’s thermoelectric motor patent proved to be a turning point in his careerbecause through it he met the men who would become his mentors while heperfected his AC motor. While digging ditches, Tesla told the foreman who hiredhim about his efforts at invention, and this foreman in turn introduced him toAlfred S. Brown (1836–1906).3 [029_BM029.xhtml#d413] Brown had entered thetelegraph service in 1855 and by 1875 had worked his way up to the position ofsuperintendent of Western Union’s New York Metropolitan District.4[029_BM029.xhtml#d414] Regarded as a “first class electrician and expert inunderground telegraph work,” Brown was responsible for supervising theinstallation of the cables connecting Western Union’s main office to the stockand commodity exchanges located in downtown Manhattan, and so it is entirelypossible that a foreman supervising ditchdigging for these underground cablescould have introduced Tesla to Brown.5 [029_BM029.xhtml#d415] As a seniorWestern Union manager, Brown had watched Edison demonstrate several of hisbreakthrough inventions, including his duplex (two-message), quadruplex(four-message), and improved telephone.6 [029_BM029.xhtml#d416] One indicationof Brown’s prominence in telegraph circles was that he served as a pallbearer atthe 1878 funeral of William Orton, the powerful president of Western Union.7[029_BM029.xhtml#d417] Based on his Western Union experience, Brown knew wellhow companies and individuals could use inventions to dramatically reshape anindustry.Sensing an opportunity with Tesla’s thermomagnetic motor but realizing that hewould need business expertise to turn this invention into a commercialproposition, Brown turned to Charles F. Peck (d. 1890). A lawyer from Englewood,New Jersey, Peck was interested in telegraph and electrical affairs, and hecounted another electrical inventor, William Stanley Jr., as a family friend.Peck had become involved with telegraphy in 1879 when he and John O. Evansinvestigated setting up a direct telegraph connection between Washington, D.C.,and Chicago. In the course of trying to establish this line, Peck discoveredthat there were banks and merchants who were interested in leasing dedicatedwires in order to conduct their business securely. To take advantage of thisdemand in telegraph leases, he and Evans organized the Mutual Union TelegraphCompany in 1880 with capital of $1.2 million to build lines between major citiesthat could provide this dedicated service. Evans was president of this newcompany while Peck served as secretary. Mutual Union built a new line betweenBoston and Washington and then promptly leased individual wires to a number ofparties. Peck and Evans realized a handsome profit from the sale of theseleases. Together they made a good team; as one historian of the telegraphindustry wrote, “Evans was vivacious, quick, adventurous. Mr. Peck was activeand cautious.”8 [029_BM029.xhtml#d418]But Peck and Evans soon realized that there were even greater profits to be madeby using Mutual Union to harass Western Union. Ever since it had become thedominant firm in the telegraph industry in the late 1860s, Western Union hadbeen confronted by the threat of a takeover by either the federal government orWall Street financiers. To fight off these threats, the president of WesternUnion, William Orton, skillfully used a mix of political lobbying, shrewd ratecutting, erecting lines along major railroad lines, and, above all, encouraginginventors such as Edison and Elisha Gray to develop more efficient telegraphinstruments. However, these tactics were not foolproof; if rival financierscould secure either patents for new inventions or new rights-of-way from therailroads, they could easily attack Western Union and attempt a hostiletakeover. Jay Gould pursued this strategy twice, first unsuccessfully in 1874–77and then successfully in 1879–81. “In each raid,” noted historian Richard R.John, Gould “mounted a political campaign to whittle away Western Union’s legalprerogatives, triggered wild swings in the market price of Western Union sharesin which he took advantage of advance information on market trends, and built upa rival telegraph corporation—Atlantic & Pacific in 1874, American Union in1879—that Western Union found it expedient to buy out.”9 [029_BM029.xhtml#d419]In 1881, just as Gould had done, Peck and Evans decided to scale up Mutual Unionto create their own rival telegraph network. Vowing to acquire “nine-tenths ofthe profitable telegraph business of the country,” Peck and Evans issued stockand bonds for $10 million, convinced Wall Street banker George F. Baker to jointhe enterprise, and started building new lines. They gained significant strengthwhen the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad leased its telegraph lines to Mutual Union.To supervise operations, Peck hired Brown away from Western Union to serve asMutual Union’s general manager. Anxious to have the latest technology, MutualUnion retained John Wright and John Longstreet as the company’s electricians andencouraged them to develop a stock ticker or printing telegraph. All of this wasdone so energetically that within two years, Mutual Union had over twenty-fivethousand miles of lines in twenty-two states. Mutual Union boasted that theannual earning capacity of the network would be $1.5 million and the probableyearly dividends would be 12%.10 [029_BM029.xhtml#d420]Gould was not about to have this upstart ruin Western Union, and hecounterattacked with the same tactics he had used in his raids on Western Union.Initially Gould purchased 30% of Mutual Union’s stock and proposed to Baker thatthey share control of the company. When Baker refused, Gould retaliated byentangling Mutual Union in a series of lawsuits. Mutual Union’s charter limitedits capitalization to $1.2 million, and so the $10 million stock-and-bond issuewas illegal. Prodded by Gould, angry investors demanded that the attorneygeneral of New York annul the company’s charter. (Disgusted, the attorneygeneral considered canceling the charter of both Mutual Union and WesternUnion.) Western Union sued Mutual Union for infringing on a patent it held forthe telegraph relay invented by Charles G. Page (discussed later in thischapter). Meanwhile, the Chicago city council refused to allow Mutual Union toerect poles in the streets, and Detroit threatened to do likewise. Overwhelmedby these events, Mutual Union’s president, Evans, died on Christmas Day 1881.11[029_BM029.xhtml#d421]But Peck knew that such troubles were all part of the game of harassing WesternUnion; one had to be patient and wait for Western Union to sue for peace.Eventually realizing that he could ill afford to have Mutual Union become therallying point for his enemies in the telegraph industry, Gould came to termswith Mutual Union in 1885. After much discussion, Western Union agreed to leaseMutual Union’s lines. The terms of the lease were that Western Union paid 1.5%per annum on $10 million of Mutual Union’s stock and the interest on $5 millionof bonds, for which $50,000 was allocated annually to a sinking fund. Under thisarrangement, Brown rejoined Western Union as a superintendent.12[029_BM029.xhtml#d422] Peck had beaten Gould at his own game and walked awaywith a fortune.Based on their experience with Mutual Union, Peck and Brown were ideally suitedto mentor Tesla in the world of promoting inventions. Working at the highestlevels of the telegraph industry, they had learned how to exploit technologicalinnovation to their advantage. They knew how to create companies, promote newtechnology, and leverage change. Peck and Brown identified for Tesla keyopportunities in the electrical industry and they positioned his inventions soas to receive significant publicity and financial reward. Tesla held both men inhigh regard, noting that “They were in all their dealings with me the finest andnoblest characters I have ever met in my life.”13 [029_BM029.xhtml#d423]Intrigued by Tesla’s thermomagnetic motor and several other ideas, Peck proposedin the fall of 1886 that he and Brown underwrite Tesla’s efforts to developthese inventions into practical devices. To permit Tesla to get started onperfecting his inventions, Peck and Brown rented a laboratory for him in lowerManhattan in the fall of 1886. They agreed to share any profits, with Teslareceiving a third, Peck and Brown splitting a third, and a third to bereinvested to develop future inventions. Peck and Brown covered all expensesrelated to securing patents and paid Tesla a monthly salary of $250. In April1887, Tesla, Peck, and Brown formed the Tesla Electric Company. And in May 1887,Szigeti came to New York to serve as Tesla’s assistant.14 [029_BM029.xhtml#d424]Tesla’s first laboratory was located in New York’s financial district. Thelaboratory was at 89 Liberty Street, just around the corner from the offices ofMutual Union at 120 Broadway. On the ground floor was the Globe Stationery &Printing Company, and Tesla occupied a room upstairs. The lab was furnished withonly a workbench, a stove, and a dynamo manufactured by Edward Weston. Toprovide power for the dynamo, Peck and Brown struck a deal with the printingcompany. Because Globe used its steam engine to run the presses during the day,the company could provide power at night to Tesla. As a result, Tesla got intothe habit of working on his inventions at night.15 [029_BM029.xhtml#d425]In his agreement with Peck and Brown, Tesla promised to develop severaldifferent inventions, not just the AC motor that he had long been dreamingabout. Consequently, Tesla initially set to work on the problems caused bycommutators in motors and dynamos. He had been thinking about commutators foryears, and though he preferred to eliminate them from electrical machinery, henonetheless came up with several improvements, including an AC motor with ashort-circuiting commutator and a dynamo commutator that reduced sparking.16[029_BM029.xhtml#d426]THE PYROMAGNETIC GENERATORWhile Tesla duly filed a patent for the dynamo commutator, Peck and Brown werefar more intrigued by his ideas about converting the heat from burning coaldirectly into electricity.17 [029_BM029.xhtml#d427] They were attracted to thisidea because they were broadly interested in energy. Well aware of the growingdemand in American industry for cheap power, Peck and Brown had been approachedpreviously by an engineer who proposed to generate steam based on temperaturedifferences in the ocean. In certain situations in the ocean, there can be asmuch as a 60° difference between the cold water in the depths and the warm waterat the surface. One way to take advantage of this temperature differential wasto employ the principle embodied in the cryophorus, a device developed by theEnglish scientist W. H. Wollaston. While studying the nature of heat, Wollastonhad connected two vessels by a tube and then pumped out all the air. In onevessel he placed water at room temperature while the other vessel was placed inan ice bath. Much to Wollaston’s surprise, the temperature differential betweenthe two vessels caused the water in the first vessel to become steam and movethrough the tube to the second vessel where it condensed. On the basis of thisidea, the engineer calculated for Peck and Brown how a large-scale system ofpipelines, pumps, engines, boilers, and condensers could be used to generate aseemingly inexhaustible supply of steam from the ocean, which could then bepiped to steam engines. Although Peck and Brown found this plan interesting,they were concerned that it would require a huge amount of capital to build theproposed pilot plant. At the same time, they wondered how to distribute all thepower that a huge steam plant might generate: how could the power be transmittedto numerous factories, shops, and homes?18 [029_BM029.xhtml#d428]Already interested in an ambitious plan like this ocean-steam idea, then, Peckand Brown were naturally drawn to Tesla’s ideas about converting the heat fromburning coal directly into electricity. The possibility of generatingelectricity directly from heat was highly appealing to inventors and investorsbecause of the cost and complexity of using steam engines and dynamos. Togenerate electricity in the 1880s (or even today), one had to burn coal, whichheated a boiler and produced steam. The steam was then utilized by an enginethat turned the dynamo. At each step in this system, energy was lost as wasteheat or friction. If one could eliminate all of these steps and go straight fromburning coal to electricity, one would then have an efficient invention thatwould be even more revolutionary than the dynamo. (Tesla returned to this ideaof increasing the efficient generation of electricity a few years later with hismechanical oscillator; see Chapter 10 [019_Chapter019.xhtml].)For his pyromagnetic generator, Tesla combined the principle that he hademployed in his thermomagnetic motor with Faraday’s law of electromagneticinduction. In the thermomagnetic motor, Tesla found that heating a magnet hadcaused its magnetic field to weaken or change. As Faraday had pointed out, as amagnetic field changes, it induces an electric current in a conductor locatedwithin the changing field. Hence, if one placed a conductor in the field of amagnet that was being alternately heated and cooled, a current would be inducedin the conductor.19 [029_BM029.xhtml#d428a]image [Images/PG_99_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 4.2. Tesla’s pyromagnetic generator from 1886–87.Key: Ahorseshoe-shaped magnet Bthermally insulated metal box Chollow iron tubes,inside B E’, Ftwo coils of wire Dfirebox which heated the iron tubes KboilerHpipe connecting the boiler to the core so that steam could circulate inside theiron tubes Vvalve controlling steam circulating in coreFrom TCM, The Inventions, Researches, and Writings of Nikola Tesla, 2d ed.(1894; reprinted 1995), Fig. 242 on p. 430.To combine these two principles into a practical pyromagnetic generator, Teslabegan with a large horseshoe-shaped magnet (Figure 4.2[013_Chapter013.xhtml#fig4_2]). Across the poles of this magnet, he placed aspecial core consisting of a thermally insulated metal box holding a number ofhollow iron tubes. Because the core sat on the horseshoe magnet, these irontubes were magnetized. Around the outside of the core were wound two coils ofwire. Underneath the center of the core was a firebox, which heated the irontubes, and above the core’s center was a boiler, which was connected by a pipeto the core so that steam could circulate inside the iron tubes. To control whenthe steam circulated in the core, Tesla placed a valve in the piping between theboiler and the core.20 [029_BM029.xhtml#d429]When operating, a coal fire in the firebox heated the iron tubes until they weredull red, about 600°C. At this temperature, the iron tubes would be demagnetizedand the changing magnetic field would induce a current in the coils. Next, thevalve was opened, and steam (which was 100°C) would circulate inside the tubesand lower their temperature. This cooling process permitted the magnetic fieldto be restored in the iron tubes, and again, the changing magnetic field wouldinduce another current in the coils. Since heating and cooling would inducecurrents moving in opposite directions, Tesla’s pyromagnetic generator producedalternating current.Tesla regarded this pyromagnetic generator as a “great invention” andenergetically worked on it from the fall of 1886 to the late summer of 1887.21[029_BM029.xhtml#d430] In all likelihood, he encountered problems in getting asufficient temperature differential between heating and cooling. In order togenerate a significant amount of electricity, the temperature of the core wouldhave to rise and fall dramatically; if the core retained its latent heat, thenlittle electricity would have been generated. Tesla did apply for a patent forthis invention, but it was not granted.Distressed that he was not able to perfect this invention, Tesla feared thatPeck and Brown might abandon him just as Vail and Lane had done in Rahway.However, Peck had ample confidence in Tesla and instead encouraged him to keepinventing. As it became clear that the pyromagnetic generator was not going towork, Tesla recalled, “I met Mr. Peck just at the door of the building in whichhe had his office, and he spoke to me in a very kind way and said, ‘Now do notbe discouraged that this great invention of yours is not panning out right; youmay bring it to a success after all. Perhaps it would be good if you wouldswitch to some other of your ideas and drop this for a while. I have had anexperience that this is a very good plan.’ I came back encouraged.”22[029_BM029.xhtml#d431]LEARNING TO USE TWO OUT-OF-PHASE CURRENTSTaking Peck’s advice, Tesla shifted his attention from the pyromagneticgenerator to electric motors. He now returned to the ideal that had come to himin Budapest five years earlier: a motor with a rotating magnetic field (seeChapter 2 [011_Chapter011.xhtml]). As a first step toward achieving this ideal,Tesla had to test his hunch that several alternating currents could produce arotating magnetic field. He had thought a great deal about how severalalternating currents might be combined, but he had never tried them in practice.Tesla began by modifying the Weston DC dynamo in the lab so that it couldproduce two, three, or four separate alternating currents.23[029_BM029.xhtml#d432] For his first experiments, he used a large laminated ringfor the stator, similar to the one in his Strasbourg motor. Rather than have asingle winding around the ring as he did at Strasbourg, Tesla now divided thewinding into four separate coils, one in each quadrant. Tesla had the ACgenerator deliver two separate currents to coils on opposite sides of the ring(Figure 4.3 [013_Chapter013.xhtml#fig4_3]). For the motor’s rotor, he balanced ashoe polish tin on a pin in the center of the ring. To Tesla’s delight, therotating magnetic field caused the tin can to spin.24 [029_BM029.xhtml#d433]With this motor, Tesla had finally figured out how to combine alternatingcurrents to create a rotating magnetic field in the motor’s stator. To do so,the currents delivered to each pair of coils had to be out of phase with oneanother. In the case of two currents, while one current was at its maximumpositive value, the other was at its maximum negative value. If one thinks ofthe alternating currents as sine waves, then one can say that these two currentsare said to be out of phase by 90°. Now understanding the importance of havingthe currents out of phase, Tesla could build a full-scale electric motor usingthe rotating magnetic field that he had envisioned in Budapest.THE RISE OF ALTERNATING CURRENT IN THE LATE 1880SThrilled with this breakthrough motor, Tesla invited Brown, his technicallyminded patron, to come and see a demonstration in the late summer of 1887. Butas Brown watched the tin can spin in this prototype, Tesla now faced thechallenge of convincing his patrons that his rotating magnetic field could beused as the basis of a practical, commercial AC motor. Why should they put moneyinto a spinning tin can? While it may seem obvious to us to develop an AC motor,it was not so to electrical experts in 1887. To understand why this was thecase, we need to discuss the situation in the electrical industry in themid-1880s.image [Images/PG_102_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 4.3. Tesla’s AC motor in 1887.Like most electrical engineers, Tesla used a combination of stationaryelectromagnetic coils (called the stator) and rotating electromagnetic coils(called the rotor) to convert motion into electric current and vice versa in hisgenerator and motor. Diagram (a) shows how Tesla used four wires (X1, X2, X3,X4) to connect his motor to an AC generator. As shown in the side view, thegenerator’s stator consisted of two coils (N, S) and its rotor consisted of twocoils mounted at right angles to each other. This generator produced twoseparate alternating currents that were delivered to the motor via two pairs ofslips rings. The two currents traveled to the motor over the four wires and eachcurrent energized one pair of coils in the motor’s stator (either AA or BB). Therotor in the motor is grey rectangle inside the four coils, but in his 1887experiments, he used a round shoe-polish tin. Diagram (b) shows how the twoseparate alternating currents (I, II) were 90 degrees out of phase with eachother, meaning that when one was at its maximum, the other was at zero. Theimages below the current graph show how the magnetic field in the motor’s statorrotated as the currents rose and fell over time, with the arrow marked N turningin a clockwise direction. As the magnetic field rotated in the motor, it inducedan opposing magnetic force in the rotor, causing the rotor to turn. Note thatthe rotor is shown in the motor in diagram (a) but is not included in thesmaller images in diagram (b), since it would be hard to show both the rotor andthe rotating magnetic field.On the one hand, Peck and Brown were probably comfortable with Teslainvestigating motors because of the growing discussion in electrical circlesabout using motors in central stations. In the mid-1880s, as the number ofcentral stations grew and the utility industry became more competitive, centralstation operators became interested in expanding their customer base by addingmotor service. While they would continue to provide electricity for lighting atnight, central station operators saw motors as the means by which they could nowsell power to factories and streetcar lines during the day. In response,electrical manufacturing firms added motors to their product lines, and by 1887there were fifteen firms in the field with a combined output of ten thousandmotors.25 [029_BM029.xhtml#d434] And if central stations could use motors todistribute power to factories, then perhaps a new efficient motor would allowPeck and Brown to distribute power from their ambitious ocean-steam scheme.26[029_BM029.xhtml#d435]On the other hand, Peck and Brown were highly suspicious of Tesla’s ideas aboutdeveloping an AC motor since nearly all of the central stations in the UnitedStates in the mid-1880s were using DC, not AC.27 [029_BM029.xhtml#d436] In thelate 1870s, a few electrical inventors in France—as well as Elihu Thomson inAmerica—had experimented with using AC in their arc-lighting systems.Alternating current was attractive to these inventors since it permitted them touse a rudimentary transformer in order to solve the basic problem of how to geta single dynamo to power several arc lights at once; this was what electriciansin the 1870s called the “subdivision of the electric light.” However, onceCharles Brush of Cleveland introduced his DC arc-lighting system with animproved dynamo and regulator, American electricians switched to developing DCsystems. Using DC, entrepreneurs were able to establish central stations for arcand incandescent lighting in dozens of American cities.28 [029_BM029.xhtml#d437]In Europe, though, AC was not forgotten, and inventors there improved thetransformer; by winding two different coils on a single iron core, they foundthey could raise or lower the voltage of alternating current, and they quicklystarted using this new device in a variety of ways. For instance, in London in1883, Lucien Gaulard and John Gibbs used one of the first transformers toconnect both arc and different incandescent lights in series to a single largegenerator.29 [029_BM029.xhtml#d438] About the same time in Budapest, theengineers Tesla had met at Ganz and Company—Zipernowski, Bláthy, and Déri(ZBD)—saw AC as a way of developing an incandescent lighting system that couldserve a wider area. By having their generator produce high-voltage AC, theyfound they could distribute power over longer distances using small copperwires. To protect customers from the high voltage, they used a transformer tostep down the voltage before the current came into homes and shops. Within a fewyears, the ZBD system was being used to light several European cities. Both theGaulard and Gibbs and ZBD systems employed single-phase AC since that was allthat was needed to secure the desired voltage change.30 [029_BM029.xhtml#d439]The work in Europe on AC transformers was quickly appreciated by astute Americanelectrical entrepreneurs. During a trip abroad in 1885, Charles Coffin ofThomson-Houston learned about the ZBD system and, upon his return, urged Thomsonto resume his work on AC. In 1886, Edison agents in Europe warned that they werecompeting against Ganz and Company for lighting contracts, and they convincedthe Edison organization to secure an option on the American patent rights forthe ZBD system.31 [029_BM029.xhtml#d440]But the American entrepreneur most intrigued by the AC transformer was GeorgeWestinghouse (1846–1914). Educated in his father’s machine shop in Schenectady,New York, Westinghouse possessed a unique mix of technical genius and businessacumen. Not only was Westinghouse able to develop air brakes and improved signalsystems for the railroads, he was equally skilled at running the companiesneeded to manufacture and market these innovations on a large scale. In 1884,Westinghouse became interested in electric lighting, initially as a way ofdiversifying his Union Switch and Signal Company. As a first step, Westinghousehired William Stanley Jr., who had patented an incandescent lamp andself-regulating dynamo.At first, Westinghouse simply intended to develop a DC system similar to that ofEdison, but in the spring of 1885 he became intrigued by Gaulard and Gibbs’s ACtransformer system after reading about it in the journal Engineering.32[029_BM029.xhtml#d441] Sensing that there would be limited returns fromdeveloping one more DC system, Westinghouse decided to strike out in an entirelynew direction. In particular, he suspected that AC could be used to establishcentral stations in municipalities that the Edison organization could not serve.Because of the high costs of its generators and copper distribution network, theEdison organization could sell systems only to towns and cities in which therewas a densely populated downtown; for an Edison central station to beprofitable, it needed to be located where it could serve dozens of homes andbusinesses. Westinghouse believed that with AC, one could achieve economies ofscale; by employing transformers, one could step up the voltage, distributepower across a wider region, and hence serve more customers. His AC system wouldbe designed to be profitable in towns and cities in which the population wasdispersed.Once he saw the potential for AC, Westinghouse moved decisively. He dispatchedan associate, Guido Pantaleoni, to Europe to secure an option on the Gaulard andGibbs system. In the summer of 1885, Westinghouse ordered several Gaulard andGibbs transformers shipped to his factory in Pittsburgh, and he asked Stanley todesign an AC incandescent lighting system.33 [029_BM029.xhtml#d442] Working in asmall laboratory in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, Stanley developed apractical design for a transformer and confirmed the idea that transformersshould be connected to the generator in parallel, not in series as Gaulard andGibbs had done. To demonstrate the value of his transformer, Stanley strungwires in trees along the streets of Great Barrington to deliver AC to homes andbusinesses in March 1886.34 [029_BM029.xhtml#d443] Building on Stanley’sdemonstration system, Westinghouse installed its first commercial AC system inBuffalo, New York, the following November. Determined to keep up withWestinghouse, Thomson-Houston installed an AC system at the Lynn Electric LightCompany in May 1887, and by year’s end, Thomson-Houston had installed anothertwenty-two systems.35 [029_BM029.xhtml#d444]The electrical engineering community followed with interest the rapiddevelopment of AC lighting systems during 1887. While AC transformers hadreceived only passing mention in Electrical World’s annual review of the stateof the art in January 1887, the journal regarded the development of lightingsystems using transformers as one of the most important breakthroughs in January1888.36 [029_BM029.xhtml#d445]The electrical fraternity was fascinated with AC, not because they were certainthat it was the technology of the future but because they saw a serious gapbetween the ideal and the real. Yes, ideally, AC should permit central stationsto distribute power to a larger number of customers, but realistically this hadyet to be achieved. As things stood by the end of 1887, AC presented both acommercial opportunity and significant technical problems and risks. Althoughtransformers could step the voltage up and down, engineers at Westinghouse andThomson-Houston found it difficult to design an efficient transformer. Othercritics were concerned about the costs of large AC power stations. Westinghouseclaimed that a major advantage of AC was that one could erect a large plant onthe outskirts of a city that could generate electricity cheaply. Familiar withthe difficulties of raising capital to build stations, both Edison and manycentral station operators believed that large AC plants would cost too muchmoney to build and the interest charges on the investment would eliminate anyoperating profits.37 [029_BM029.xhtml#d446]Yet another worry was safety. Edison and his associates had spent a great dealof time trying to identify better insulating materials for their low-voltagesystem, and they simply did not believe that Westinghouse could safely protectpeople from high-voltage shocks.38 [029_BM029.xhtml#d447] And finally, severalcommentators pointed out that the AC systems put forward by Westinghouse andThomson-Houston were not as convenient or versatile as the DC systems; bothcompanies lacked a meter for measuring how much electricity was used by eachindividual consumer as well as a motor for providing power to factories andstreetcars. After completing a thorough study of the pros and cons of AC, Edisonsummed up the problems with AC by remarking that it was simply “not worth theattention of practical men.”39 [029_BM029.xhtml#d448]THE EGG OF COLUMBUSPeck and Brown were well aware of these trends in the electrical industry. Theyknew that while there was growing interest in electric motors, no one was surethat the future belonged to AC. Hence, while Peck and Brown encouraged Tesla toinvestigate electric motors, they were not keen to have him work on an AC motor.AC, for all they knew, might just be a passing fad—interesting, yes, but toodifficult to perfect. Perhaps it would be better if Tesla focused on a DC motorfor which there was a ready market.After several discouraging conferences with Peck and Brown to discuss his plansfor an AC motor, Tesla realized that he needed a dramatic demonstration. It wasnot enough to show Brown a shoe polish tin spinning in a rotating magneticfield; Tesla needed to do something that would capture the imagination of hisbackers.Consequently, at their next meeting, Tesla asked Peck and Brown if they knew thestory of the egg of Columbus. According to legend, Christopher Columbus overcamehis critics in the Spanish court of Queen Isabella by challenging them tobalance an egg on its end. After the scoffers were unable to get the egg tobalance, Columbus made the egg stand upright by lightly cracking one end.Impressed that Columbus had outsmarted his critics, Isabella pawned her jewelsto finance Columbus’s ships.40 [029_BM029.xhtml#d449]When Peck and Brown acknowledged that they had heard the story, Tesla proposedthat he could make an egg stand on end without breaking the shell. If he couldgo one better than Columbus, would Peck and Brown be willing to underwrite hisAC experiments? “We have no crown jewels to pawn,” replied Peck, “but there area few ducats in our buckskins and we might help you to an extent.”41[029_BM029.xhtml#d450]To gain those ducats, Tesla fastened his four-coil magnet to the underside of awooden table and secured a copper-plated egg and several balls (Figure 4.4[013_Chapter013.xhtml#fig4_4]). When Peck and Brown next came to the laboratory,Tesla placed the copper egg on the tabletop and applied two out-of-phasecurrents to the magnet. To their astonishment, the egg stood on end, but Peckand Brown were stupefied when the egg and balls started spinning by themselveson the tabletop. While it looked like magic, Tesla quickly explained to Peck andBrown that the egg and balls were spinning because of the rotating magneticfield. Highly impressed by this demonstration, Peck and Brown became ardentsupporters of Tesla’s work on AC motors.image [Images/PG_107_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 4.4. Tesla’s egg of Columbus apparatus, circa 1887.From “Tesla’s Egg of Columbus,” Electrical Experimenter 6:774–75ff. (March1919), on p. 774.This episode taught Tesla that invention would require a degree of showmanshipin order to create the right illusion about his creations. People do not investin inventions built out of tin cans; they invest in projects that capture theirimagination. To draw people in, one often has to draw on metaphors, stories, andthemes that have power in a particular culture—that’s what Tesla did by invokingthe Columbus story. Once he drew them in, Tesla could then get Peck and Brown tothink about the commercial potential of his motor.MAKING POLYPHASE MOTORSOnce his egg of Columbus had convinced Peck and Brown, Tesla pushed ahead withmotors that utilized his rotating magnetic field. With Szigeti’s help, hefashioned two basic AC motors that he used in nearly all of his experiments in1887 and 1888. The first was an elaboration of the egg of Columbus apparatus,which consisted of a large laminated ring (the stator) with an iron disk (therotor) rotating in its center (Figure 4.5 [013_Chapter013.xhtml#fig4_5]).42[029_BM029.xhtml#d451] In the second motor, Tesla again used a laminated ringbut this time he placed four coils on projections inside the ring (Figure 4.6[013_Chapter013.xhtml#fig4_6]). In this second motor, Tesla tried severaldifferent rotors including both a disk and a drum-wound rotor.43[029_BM029.xhtml#d452] He found that both motor designs worked and that when hereversed the electrical connections, the motors changed directionsinstantaneously. Tesla was enormously pleased with these motors, since they“were exactly as I had imagined them. I made no attempt to improve the design,but merely reproduced the pictures as they appeared to my vision and theoperation was always as I expected.”44 [029_BM029.xhtml#d453]Because these motors used two or more alternating currents that were out ofphase with each other, Tesla referred to them as his polyphase motors. Tesla wasnot the only inventor working on AC motors at the time, but his polyphase motorswere significantly different from those developed by Elihu Thomson and otherrivals. First, Tesla kept his motor simple by concentrating on finding a way tomake the rotor turn by inducing eddy currents in it rather than by deliveringcurrents to it. Second, he developed the motor around a phenomenon that was notnecessarily apparent in nature, a rotating magnetic field. And third, unlike anyof his contemporaries, Tesla was willing to use several alternating currents tocreate the magnetic field.image [Images/PG_109_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 4.5. Tesla’s basic experimental arrangement for experimenting with ACmotors in the fall of 1887.On the left is the motor and on the right is the generator. The generatorproduced two separate AC currents, as shown by four slip rings on its rotorshaft. The motor consisted of stator in the form of a donut-shaped coil and arectangular-shaped steel rotor in the center of the donut coil. The stator hadfour separate coils that were connected in pairs to the generator. When the twocurrents produced by the generator were out of phase with each other by 90degrees, they produced a rotating magnetic field in the stator. This field, inturn, caused the rotor to spin on its pivot.From TCM, The Inventions, Researches, and Writings of Nikola Tesla, 2d ed.(1894; reprinted 1995), Fig. 9 on p. 16.By the end of 1887, Peck and Brown recognized that Tesla had invented aremarkable new AC motor and urged him to patent his ideas. Peck sent Tesla toconsult with the law firm of Duncan, Curtis, & Page. Peck had a high opinion ofthis firm and he assured Tesla that it would secure strong patents for hisinventions. At Duncan, Curtis, & Page, Tesla’s patent work was taken up by oneof the firm’s partners, Parker W. Page (1862–1937). Educated at Harvard, Pageprobably took a special interest in Tesla’s motors since his father, CharlesGrafton Page, had worked on electric motors—and even a full-scalebattery-powered locomotive—in the 1840s and 1850s. Moreover, patents werecentral to the Page family. Late in life, Charles Grafton Page secured a specialpatent from Congress covering the general form of an induction coil, and afterhis death, his widow, Priscilla, convinced Western Union to purchase the rightsto this patent for $25,000 plus royalties paid by licensees. Between hisfather’s work on electric motors and his mother’s success in selling ablockbuster patent to Western Union, Parker Page was the ideal attorney to workon Tesla’s motor patents.45 [029_BM029.xhtml#d454]image [Images/PG_110_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 4.6. Tesla motor built in 1887–88. From NTM. The offices of Duncan, Curtis, & Page were located at 120 Broadway, in the samebuilding as Peck’s office and just around the corner from Tesla’s lab on LibertyStreet. Tesla regularly visited Page’s office and brought Page sketches andtechnical descriptions of his ideas. Tesla carefully prepared his writtendescriptions in the form of technical reports not only because he consulted themwhile he was experimenting but because he was hoping to write a book titled “TheHistory of a Thousand and One Alternating Current Motors.” According to Page,Tesla emphasized broad principles in his descriptions, not specific motordesigns. Using Tesla’s reports and sketches, Page drafted patent applications,which Tesla then checked and revised.46 [029_BM029.xhtml#d455]Working together, Page and Tesla now faced a strategic decision: how should heprotect his invention? Up to this point, Tesla had followed the custom of mostinventors and filed patent applications covering the design of individualcomponents; for instance, with his arc-lighting system, he filed separateapplications for his dynamo, lamp, and regulator. However, for his polyphasemotor, Page and Tesla decided that a series of applications for individual motordesigns did not capture the essence of the invention. Since his student days,Tesla had been thinking about his motor in terms of a system and now he wantedto disclose his invention to the world as a system. Consequently, Page and Teslachose the bold strategy of filing applications claiming a system for usingpolyphase motors to transmit power.Convinced that his motor should be viewed as a complete system, Tesla thus fileda comprehensive patent application on 12 October 1887.47 [029_BM029.xhtml#d456]In this application, Tesla claimed not only the invention of a new AC motor butalso a new system of electrical power transmission. Anticipating that theexaminers in the Patent Office might not understand how his new motor worked,Tesla explained his theory as to how the rotating magnetic field caused therotor to rotate.During the fall, Tesla and Page followed up the broad application with four moresubmissions to the Patent Office that covered various ideas for motors datingback to his student days in Prague.48 [029_BM029.xhtml#d457] All of theseapplications, however, were regarded as too sweeping by the Patent Office; inparticular, the patent examiners did not want Tesla to claim both his motor andhis system of power transmission in the same patent. Consequently, in March1888, Page and Tesla were obliged to split three of the applications withseparate submissions for the motor and system designs. As a result, Tesla woundup with seven patents covering his polyphase ideas, and all were issued on 1 May1888.49 [029_BM029.xhtml#d458]A BIT MORE PRACTICAL: SPLIT-PHASE MOTORSTesla was quite proud of his polyphase motor and his ideas for powertransmission, and he poured a great deal of energy into writing these patentapplications. He was captivated by the ideal of developing complete systems fortransmitting electric power, systems in which the motor and generator werecarefully matched to each other. Tesla felt confident that by developing wholesystems he would be able to produce efficient motors and generators in the sensethat they would have the greatest possible output for their weight.50[029_BM029.xhtml#d459]But Brown, Tesla’s technically minded backer, was not entirely convinced thatthe systems approach was the best way to develop AC motors. Brown was troubledthat Tesla’s polyphase schemes required four or even six wires to run betweenthe generator and motor. Yes, the Brush arc-lighting installations in the late1870s had used four or more wires to connect the lamps and dynamo, but given thehigh cost of copper wiring, electrical engineers had shifted in the late 1880sto two-and three-wire schemes for electric lighting.51 [029_BM029.xhtml#d460]Tesla’s polyphase system simply did not match the two-wire AC systems currentlybeing built and operated by Westinghouse and Thomson-Houston. Because hispolyphase motors were designed to operate on four or six wires, it was notpossible to simply connect a Tesla polyphase motor to an existing electricalsystem. If a central station were to employ Tesla’s polyphase system, it wouldhave to start from scratch and install a special generator and wiring network.Hence, Tesla might think his polyphase system was ideal, but in Brown’s opinion,it had limited commercial potential.52 [029_BM029.xhtml#d461]In September 1887, just after Tesla demonstrated the shoe polish tin motor,Brown asked Tesla if he could design an AC motor that could work on existingsingle-phase AC circuits—a motor that would need only two wires to connect it tothe generator. Because he was caught up in creating his ideal for a polyphasesystem of power transmission, it had not occurred to Tesla that anyone wouldwant motors that would work on existing AC lines.53 [029_BM029.xhtml#d462]However, within a few days, Tesla started showing Brown motors that could run ontwo wires using single-phase AC. For these motors, Tesla split the incoming ACinto two branch circuits and then used several techniques to cause the currentin one branch to be out of phase relative to the other. To cause one current tobe out of phase, Tesla placed resistance coils, capacitors, and induction coilsin one branch of the circuit coming into the motor. Each of these circuits wasconnected to coils on opposite sides of the stator in the motor, and theout-of-phase currents created a rotating magnetic field. When Brown expressedconcern that extra devices such as resistance coils produced waste heat andlowered the efficiency of the motor, Tesla eliminated them by employing twokinds of wire in the stator coils. By using thick wire with a low resistance forone set of stator coils and fine wire with high resistance for the other set, heproduced two out-of-phase currents and hence a rotating magnetic field just likethe one in his polyphase motors.54 [029_BM029.xhtml#d463]Impressed with Tesla’s ability to generate a host of split-phase motors, Brownencouraged Tesla to prepare patent applications for all his ideas. With his eyeon developments in the electrical utility industry, Brown sensed that patentsfor AC motors that could be added to existing distribution networks would bevaluable. Tesla, however, disagreed with Brown, arguing that he needed to comeup with a split-phase design as efficient as his polyphase motors. Clearly Teslawas enamored with his ideal polyphase system and much more interested in howthis system could transmit power from one point to another. Tesla was confidentthat he could raise the efficiency of his split-phase motors, but until he didso, he would file patent applications only for his polyphase inventions. As aresult, Tesla decided not to file any applications for the split-phase motors hebuilt during the fall of 1887.55 [029_BM029.xhtml#d464]Consequently, for the next few months Tesla continued to prepare his polyphaseapplications and said nothing to his attorney, Page, about his split-phasemotors. In April 1888, though, Page asked Tesla about these motors. Whileworking with Tesla on an application for using a transformer to regulate thephase relationship between two currents, Page happened to inquire if the motordescribed in this application could run on two wires. When he answered yes,Tesla recalled that “Mr. Page looked at me in amazement and asked me to explainmore fully. I remember it very well, because it almost scared me to death.” Pagecouldn’t believe that Tesla was unaware of the growing demand for a practical ACmotor and that he had not bothered to disclose that he had invented a two-wiremotor. Meanwhile, Tesla was worried that if Page knew about his two-wiredesigns, Page would not take his polyphase system seriously. As Page recalled,Tesla had “purposely kept the knowledge of these [two-wire] motors from me forfear that if I knew that his polyphase motors could be run on a single circuitlike any other motors that I would not believe that the invention [i.e., thepolyphase system] amounted to anything, and would not, in consequence, draw goodclaims.”56 [029_BM029.xhtml#d465]Once he recovered his composure, Page set out to secure strong patents forTesla’s split-phase motors. The situation was complicated because the broadpolyphase applications in the Patent Office were ready to issue on 1 May 1888.Anticipating this, Page had been preparing applications for half-a-dozenadditional specific polyphase inventions, and he needed to file these remainingapplications before the broad patents issued.57 [029_BM029.xhtml#d466] If he didnot do so, the examiners could turn down the specific designs, arguing thatthese inventions were already covered by the broad patents. In addition, Pagehad filed patent applications in several foreign countries including England andGermany and was now worried because the foreign polyphase patents had to bebased on what was covered in the American patents. If Page revised the polyphaseapplications to include Tesla’s split-phase motors, he ran the risk ofsignificantly delaying the foreign patents. To sort out these complications,Page made a hasty trip to the Patent Office in Washington, and upon his return,he began drafting two-wire motor applications for Tesla to review.58[029_BM029.xhtml#d467]It would be easy to conclude from Tesla’s reluctance to patent his split-phasemotors that, like other inventors, Tesla tended to have a blind spot about thecommercial implications of his work. Elihu Thomson, for example, failed toappreciate fully the importance of developing a single-phase AC system usingtransformers and only filed patents in 1885 when prodded by his patron, CharlesA. Coffin.59 [029_BM029.xhtml#d468]However, this episode with the split-phase motors reveals an even strongercharacteristic of Tesla’s style as an inventor. Tesla was anxious to develop hispolyphase system because it embodied an ideal principle. Throughout his AC motorwork, he was enthralled by the symmetry of his AC system: just as severalalternating currents were produced as the rotor cut through the magnetic fieldof the generator, so multiphase alternating currents could produce motion in themotor by means of a rotating magnetic field. While Tesla could capture andutilize this ideal symmetry in his polyphase system, he could not do the samewith split-phase motors. Yes, he could split the current using a variety ofingenious tricks, but these tricks were not the same as employing a beautifulprinciple.As we shall see, over the course of Tesla’s career his strength was to identifya grand idea and to seek to develop a system around it. The difficulty with thisapproach was that it meant that Tesla expected businessmen and consumers toadjust to his systems—based on an ideal—rather than Tesla adjusting his systemsto the needs and wishes of society. In the case of his polyphase versussplit-phase motors, it meant that Tesla thought that society ought to adopt hisbeautiful polyphase system even if it meant replacing the existing two-wire,single-phase systems with the more expensive four-wire networks needed forpolyphase. Practical considerations and cost meant little to Tesla in comparisonto an ideal. Here Tesla was like Steve Jobs, who frequently exhorted hisengineers not to worry about costs but instead design “insanely great products”with new capabilities.60 [029_BM029.xhtml#d469]The result of this disagreement and confusion with Brown and Page was that Teslawound up securing two groups of patents: one set covered his ideas forpolyphase, multiwire motors and systems, while the second set covered the morepractical split-phase or two-wire motors. It was unfortunate that Tesla delayedfiling his split-phase applications because the delay weakened his priorityclaims and led to patent litigation that lasted for the next fifteen years. Yetas we shall see, by having patents covering both broad principles and practicaldesigns, Tesla gave his backers a strong hand to play in negotiating withelectrical manufacturers."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVESELLING THE MOTOR(1888–1889)FRAMING A BUSINESS STRATEGYProdded by Brown and Page, Tesla spent April and May 1888 working at a feverishpace. He now understood the necessity of testing and preparing patentapplications for as many split-phase motor designs as possible. “I made dailyexperiments,” he remembered, “and improvised … models from pieces of sheet ironand disks and rotors of various shapes placed in temporary bearings. I may havehad possibly 20 finished models that were complete, as nearly as I canrecollect.” As his experiments progressed, Tesla gave Page oral reports fromwhich Page prepared patent applications. Out of the plethora of experimentalmotors, Page and Tesla decided to concentrate on the most promising method, andthey initially filed applications covering a split-phase motor that had statorcoils wound with thick and thin wire (described in Chapter 4[013_Chapter013.xhtml]).1 [029_BM029.xhtml#d470]While Tesla was busy in the laboratory, Peck and Brown were not idle. As itbecame clear that Tesla had indeed come up with several promising AC motors,they began to think about how they could make money from Tesla’s inventions. AsPeck and Brown knew from their previous ventures, there were three basicstrategies they might follow. First, they could use the patents to create theirown new business to manufacture or use their inventions. Because patentsprevented others from manufacturing the product or using the process, theinventor earned a profit from his monopoly position. An example of this strategyis how George Eastman used his patented system of roll film to build up EastmanKodak beginning in the 1880s.2 [029_BM029.xhtml#d471]Second, inventors could grant licenses to an established manufacturer. Under thelicense, the manufacturer might be required to pay inventors royalties for eachitem manufactured. For instance, after securing a patent for a “road engine” in1895, George B. Selden collected from automakers a fee of $15 for eachautomobile manufactured in the United States. Selden was eventually defeated incourt in 1911 by Henry Ford.3 [029_BM029.xhtml#d472]And third, they could sell their patents outright to another entrepreneur orcompany. The inventor would realize an immediate profit and would avoid therisks of having to manufacture and market his invention. Elmer Sperry, forexample, developed an electrolytic process for making white lead in 1904 that hesold to the Hooker Electro-chemical Company.4 [029_BM029.xhtml#d473]For the most part, historians have concentrated on how inventors in thenineteenth century followed the first strategy, manufacture, largely becausethat strategy led to creation of long-enduring firms such as General Electric orEastman Kodak. However, for the average nineteenth-century inventor, thisstrategy was highly risky, capital intensive, and likely to pay off only overthe long run. Moreover, it required that the inventor master the intricacies ofmanufacturing and marketing, and many inventors lacked these business skills. Isuspect that some inventors decided to set up businesses for manufacturing orusing their inventions only after they had exhausted the possibilities forselling or licensing their patents. For instance, Bell and his backers initiallytried to sell the telephone patent to Western Union in 1876, and it was onlyafter Western Union declined to buy it that they set up the American BellTelephone Company and began building exchanges.5 [029_BM029.xhtml#d474]Given the risks associated with manufacturing, many nineteenth-century inventorspreferred to either sell or license their patents. During the 1870s, Munn &Company, the patent agency affiliated with Scientific American, urged itsinventor clients to pursue a licensing strategy.6 [029_BM029.xhtml#d475] Inparticular, licensing was seen as highly profitable since one could grant alarge number of licenses to different firms in different territories. With itsincandescent lighting system, the Edison Electric Light Company made a handsomeprofit by granting licenses to power companies in dozens of cities. As astrategy, though, licensing had a downside in that the inventor had to be evervigilant against competitors infringing his patents, lest the licensees losetheir monopoly position. By not aggressively defending its patents in themid-1880s, the Edison Electric Light Company inadvertently allowed severalcompetitors to spring up, and one of those competitors, the Thomson-HoustonElectric Company, eventually took over the Edison Company to form GeneralElectric in 1892.7 [029_BM029.xhtml#d476]It was within this context that Peck and Brown framed their business strategyfor Tesla’s inventions, which can be summed up as patent-promote-sell. As Teslacame up with new electrical inventions, he would patent them. His backersprovided the money necessary to cover laboratory expenses and patent fees. Oncehis inventions were patented, Tesla would then vigorously promote them throughinterviews, demonstrations, and lectures in order to attract businessmen. Toearn a profit on their investment, Peck and Brown then sought to sell or licensehis patents to either established manufacturers or other investors, who wouldset up new companies. Hence, the name of the game for Tesla and his backers wasnot manufacturing his inventions but rather selling or licensing them.The strategy of selling or licensing patents poses distinct challenges for theinventor and his backers. One has to know people who might be looking for newtechnology, then one has to generate interest and excitement in the patents thatare for sale, and finally one has to negotiate favorable terms. Thesenegotiations involve much bargaining since the seller (i.e., the inventor) asksthe highest possible price in order to recover the costs of developing theinvention while the buyer seeks to minimize his risk (How much will it cost toconvert the invention to a product? Will the product sell?) by keeping the pricelow. At the same time, the inventor also has to keep in mind that he may nothave the only patents for sale and that asking too high a price may send thebuyer to other inventors. Hence, to get the best possible price and not driveaway the buyer, the inventor and his backers may use all sorts of arguments topersuade the buyer that the invention in question is the best possible versionand offers the greatest potential. For the inventor and his backers, then,persuasion is essential for the risky business of selling or licensing patents.8[029_BM029.xhtml#d477]PROMOTING TESLA’S MOTORSHaving chosen patent-promote-sell as their strategy, Peck and Brown now had topromote Tesla’s inventions energetically but carefully. The right people—themanagers running electrical manufacturing companies—had to learn about hisinventions in the right way—scientifically and objectively. In the 1880s, dozensof inventors were turning out hundreds of electrical patents, many of which wereof little value. For instance, the Thomson-Houston Company was inundated withoffers of patents from inventors, including one for a dubious product called“electric water.”9 [029_BM029.xhtml#d478] Peck and Brown therefore had to charta course whereby they could capture the attention of electrical manufacturersand convince them of the commercial potential of Tesla’s patents. Just as Teslahad captured their imagination with the egg of Columbus, now Peck and Brown hadto engage the imagination of the electrical manufacturers.In framing their promotional efforts, Peck and Brown had to overcome Tesla’sobscurity. Since his arrival in America in 1884, Tesla had kept to himself andhad not joined any of the recently formed electrical organizations such as theAmerican Institute of Electrical Engineers, the National Electrical LightAssociation, or the Electrical Club of New York.10 [029_BM029.xhtml#d479] Asidefrom the several electricians he had met working in the middle ranks of theEdison organization, Tesla knew few people in the electrical engineeringcommunity. Not knowing anything about Tesla, the electrical fraternity mightwell wonder how a young man of thirty-two from a little-known part of easternEurope could have developed such a promising AC motor. Was it everything heclaimed it was?To get the right “buzz” going about Tesla’s motors, Peck and Brown sought theendorsement of an expert, Professor William Anthony. Educated at BrownUniversity and Yale’s Sheffield Scientific School, Anthony was an expert inelectricity and optics. From 1872 to 1887, he was Professor of Physics atCornell University. While at Cornell, Anthony had tested dynamos and establishedthe first electrical engineering program in the United States. Wishing toperfect his own electrical inventions, Anthony left Cornell in 1887 to becomethe electrician (the chief engineer) at the Mather Electric Company inManchester, Connecticut. Possessing both academic credentials and commercialexperience, Anthony must have seemed to Peck and Brown the ideal person toevaluate Tesla’s motors.11 [029_BM029.xhtml#d480]In March 1888, Peck and Brown sent Tesla to visit Professor Anthony inManchester. (Tesla made this trip just as the Great Blizzard of ’88 hit, and hewas trapped for several days in Manchester.) Tesla prepared two special motorsfor Anthony to test. Both were polyphase designs, not split-phase machines,since Peck and Brown were worried about revealing too much of what Tesla hadaccomplished. The tests went well, and Anthony concluded that Tesla’s AC motorswere as efficient as the DC motors currently available. Anthony was notespecially concerned that the polyphase motors would require four wires since heassumed they would be installed in special industrial situations where the needfor power would offset the cost of the extra wires.After conducting the tests, Anthony visited Tesla’s laboratory in New York.There Anthony and Tesla discussed specific design problems, such as how toconstruct a rotor that would respond best to eddy currents and the relationshipbetween the speed of the motor and the number of windings on the rotor. Awed byAnthony’s academic credentials, Tesla was reticent with the professor and triednot to disagree with him.12 [029_BM029.xhtml#d481]Anthony was highly impressed with Tesla’s inventions. As he wrote to Dugald C.Jackson, who was teaching electrical engineering at the University of Wisconsin,I [have] seen a system of alternating current motors in N.Y. that promised greatthings. I was called as an expert and was shown the machines under the pledge ofsecrecy as applications were still in the Patent Office.… I have seen such anarmature [i.e., rotor] weighing 12 pounds running at 3,000 [rpm], when one ofthe (ac) circuits was suddenly reversed, reverse its rotation so suddenly that Icould hardly see what did it. In all this you understand there is no commutator.The armatures have no connection with anything outside.…It was a wonderful result to me. Of course, it means two separate circuits from[the] generator and is not applicable to existing systems. But in the form ofmotor I first described, there is absolutely nothing like a commutator, the two(ac) chasing each other round the field do it all. There is nothing to wearexcept the two bearings.13 [029_BM029.xhtml#d482]Anthony not only spread news about Tesla’s motors among his fellow engineers butalso discussed Tesla’s achievements in a lecture he gave before the MIT Societyof Arts in Boston in May 1888.14 [029_BM029.xhtml#d483]After receiving Anthony’s favorable evaluation, Peck and Brown contacted thetechnical press. Knowing that the polyphase patents would issue on 1 May 1888,they invited editors from the electrical weeklies to visit the laboratory. Inthe closing weeks of April 1888, Tesla demonstrated his polyphase motor toCharles Price of the Electrical Review and Thomas Commerford Martin ofElectrical World. Both Price and Martin were favorably impressed, and Price rana story about Tesla’s motors just after the patents were issued.15[029_BM029.xhtml#d484]THE AIEE LECTUREThe centerpiece of the promotional campaign was Tesla’s lecture to the AmericanInstitute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) on 16 May 1888. Since Anthony was avice president and Martin a former president of the institute, they encouragedTesla to give a paper on his polyphase inventions. Exhausted and ill fromoverwork, Tesla initially declined to give the lecture. However, Anthony andMartin persisted, and Tesla wrote the lecture hastily the night before he gaveit.As props for the lecture, Tesla displayed the two motors that Anthony hadtested. In order that he could participate in the discussion following thepaper, Martin arranged not to chair the session (as he frequently did) butinstead asked Francis R. Upton, AIEE vice president and treasurer of the EdisonLamp Company, to preside.Tesla titled his AIEE lecture “A New System of Alternate Current Motors andTransformers.” Though his title was modest, he immediately made bold claims forpolyphase AC: “I now have the pleasure of bringing to your notice … a novelsystem of electric distribution and transmission of power by means of alternatecurrents … which I am confident will at once establish the superior adaptabilityof these currents to the transmission of power.” To support his claims, Teslabegan by using the step-by-step diagrams from his first polyphase patent toexplain how two separate alternating currents could create a rotating magneticfield. To convince his engineering audience that the rotating magnetic fieldexerted a uniform pull on the motor’s rotor, he offered a brief mathematicalanalysis of the forces involved. Tesla then described his basic polyphase motor,consisting of a ring with four separate coils for the stator and steel disk forthe rotor (see Figure 4.5 [013_Chapter013.xhtml#fig4_5]). This motor, heemphasized, could be readily reversed and was also synchronous (i.e., it ran atthe same speed as the generator). Anticipating that some might complain that hispolyphase motors could not be run on existing AC systems, Tesla argued that itwould be relatively simple to change the connections in the rotor coils and thearrangement of the slip rings so that the generators could produce severalalternating currents with the appropriate phase relation. Tesla also thoughtthat if power stations would install large multipolar generators (with 64 or 128coils in the rotor and stator), it would be relatively simple to design motorsto run at whatever speed was needed. (As we shall see in Chapter 9[018_Chapter018.xhtml], neither of these approaches was especially simple, andboth would require a great deal of engineering effort.)16 [029_BM029.xhtml#d485]Tesla’s lecture was followed by a discussion. To bolster Tesla’s presentation,Martin took to the floor and invited Anthony to report on the efficiency ofTesla’s motors. Emphasizing that the two motors he tested were of a smallexperimental type and that small motors tended to be less efficient than largeones, Anthony stated that Tesla’s polyphase motors had an efficiency of 50 to60%.17 [029_BM029.xhtml#d486]Anthony was followed by Elihu Thomson, who had been working on an AC motor since1884 in which he used a commutator to deliver AC to the rotor. By having thecommutator cut out different rotor coils at the right moment, Thomson was ableto set up a magnetic repulsive force between the rotor and the stator so thatthe rotor turned. Hoping to stake out the AC motor as his invention, Thomson hadgiven a paper before the AIEE in June 1887 in which he enunciated his principleof induction repulsion.18 [029_BM029.xhtml#d487] Now faced with Tesla’s claimsto having developed a practical AC motor, Thomson reminded the audience of hisown efforts and promised to report on his motor at a future meeting. In effect,Thomson was politely warning Tesla that he was not the only one working on ACmotors and that he could expect competition in the Patent Office and themarketplace. Though Tesla the newcomer was well aware of Thomson’s ability as aninventor, he did not back down but rather stood his ground. While acknowledgingThomson as “being foremost in his profession,” Tesla responded that he had builta motor like Thomson’s but had not pursued it because he was confident that thebest AC motor would be one without a commutator.19 [029_BM029.xhtml#d488]Thomson’s remarks notwithstanding, Tesla carried the day. At the conclusion ofthe meeting, Upton remarked from the chair, “I believe that this motor—Mr. Teslacan correct me if I am not right—is the first good alternating current motorthat has been put before the public anywhere—is that not so, Mr. Tesla?” Uptonthen announced that Tesla had invited the audience to come see the motors inoperation at the Liberty Street laboratory.20 [029_BM029.xhtml#d489]SELLING THE TESLA PATENTSTesla’s ideas captured the imagination of the electrical engineering communityand his lecture was reprinted by all of the major engineering journals. Inresponse to his paper, several electrical experts wrote letters to the editorcommenting on Tesla’s motor, and these, too, were reprinted. With his polyphasemotor having been “heralded in the papers as an advance in the art,” the stagewas now set for Peck and Brown to offer Tesla’s patents to the highest bidder.21[029_BM029.xhtml#d490]Tesla entrusted the negotiations related to selling his motor patents to Peckand Brown. Tesla initially hoped that they would sell his patents to the MatherElectric Company since Tesla liked Anthony and thought that he would be able toimprove his motor with Anthony’s help.22 [029_BM029.xhtml#d491] Peck and Browninvited Mather to bid on the patents, but at the same time they contacted otherelectrical manufacturers. In late April 1888, they offered the patents toThomson-Houston, and Charles A. Coffin asked Thomson to review them. Working onhis own AC motor and generally opposed to buying patents from outside inventors,Thomson recommended that Thomson-Houston not purchase the Tesla patents. Thomsonconsidered Tesla’s polyphase patents of such little value that they were notworth the required Patent Office fees.23 [029_BM029.xhtml#d492]Peck next approached the Westinghouse Electrical Manufacturing Company. As wehave seen, George Westinghouse was a latecomer to the electrical industry andhad decided to bet on AC rather than DC. Westinghouse and his associates knewthat they would only be able to convince central station utilities to purchasetheir AC equipment if they were able to offer their customers an AC motor.Hence, the Westinghouse Company was a very likely customer for Tesla’s patents.Westinghouse approached Peck about the Tesla patents in late May 1888 becausehis chief electrician, Oliver B. Shallenberger, had been investigating rotatingmagnetic fields on his own. In April 1888, Shallenberger had accidentallydropped a small coil spring on top of an electromagnet in an arc light poweredby AC. Surprised to see the spring rotating on its own, Shallenberger quicklyrealized that the changing magnetic field was causing it to turn. Shallenbergerrecognized that this phenomenon could be used to create a wattmeter and an ACmotor. Because the company had a greater need for a meter that could measurepower consumed by individual customers, Shallenberger concentrated on developingthe wattmeter rather than an AC motor.24 [029_BM029.xhtml#d493]While Shallenberger’s discovery initially caused jubilation among theWestinghouse engineers, their hopes were soon dashed when they learned thatShallenberger was not the first to discover the rotating magnetic field.25[029_BM029.xhtml#d494] Shallenberger had been beaten to this discovery by bothTesla and an Italian physicist, Galileo Ferraris. A few weeks afterShallenberger made his discovery with the spring, Westinghouse learned thatFerraris had also investigated how alternating current could create a rotatingmagnetic field. As part of his entrepreneurial style, Westinghouse regularlyscanned the engineering journals for developments that might enhance his controlof key technologies. In the course of his reading, Westinghouse spottedreferences in May 1888 to an article by Ferraris in the Proceedings of the RoyalAcademy of Sciences of Turin.26 [029_BM029.xhtml#d495]A professor of applied physics at the Royal Industrial Museum of Turin, Ferrarishad studied optics and took a special interest in mathematically analyzing thebehavior of light waves.27 [029_BM029.xhtml#d496] After testing the AC system ofGaulard and Gibbs at the 1884 International Electrical Exhibition in Turin,Ferraris decided to study transformers.28 [029_BM029.xhtml#d497] At this time,electrical investigators did not fully understand the relationship between theincoming (primary) current and the outgoing (secondary) current in transformers.Borrowing from his knowledge of mathematical optics, Ferraris theorized thatthere ought to be a phase difference of 90° between the primary and secondarycurrents in a transformer. He then hypothesized that if there was such a phasedifference, these two currents should produce circular motion, just as two lightwaves out of phase by 90° created circular interference patterns.29[029_BM029.xhtml#d498] To test this hypothesis, in 1885 Ferraris constructed anexperimental apparatus consisting of two coils placed at right angles to eachother (Figure 5.1 [014_Chapter014.xhtml#fig5_1]). Between the two coils, heplaced a small copper cylinder on a pivot, and when he connected the coils tothe primary and secondary of a Gaulard and Gibbs transformer, Ferraris foundthat the cylinder rotated. Ferraris was pleased that his apparatus confirmedthat there was a phase difference between the primary and secondary currents ina transformer, and he freely shared his results with other electricalinvestigators in conversation and correspondence.Ferraris did not publish the results of his 1885 experiments until 1888 and didso only after reading about Thomson’s induction repulsion motor. In his 1888paper, Ferraris reviewed his findings about the phase difference intransformers, commented on how his ideas could be used to cause Arago’s wheel torotate, and suggested that it might be possible to use his principle to developa wattmeter. He also reported on how he had created two out-of-phase currents byplacing an induction coil and a resistor in two branches of the circuit, thesame technique that Tesla had used in his split-phase motors in 1887.image [Images/PG_125_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 5.1. Ferraris’ AC motor circa 1885.From S. P. Thompson, Polyphase Electric Currents, 2d ed., (1900), figs. 332 and333 on p. 442.But most important, Ferraris discussed whether a rotating magnetic field couldbe used to create a practical motor. Ferraris had built a small motor with acopper cylinder for the rotor and had connected it to a dynamometer to measurehow much mechanical work the motor performed. In these tests, Ferrarisdiscovered that as the speed of the motor increased, the amount of workdecreased. Resorting again to mathematical physics, Ferraris determined that asthe motor’s speed increased, the induced currents in the copper cylinder creatednot only a magnetic field but also a great deal of waste heat. According toFerraris’s analysis, when the cylinder reached maximum speed, the inducedcurrents would produce equal amounts of mechanical work and heat, and, as aresult, the motor would become inefficient and start to slow down. Based on histests and mathematical analysis, Ferraris concluded “that an apparatus basedupon the principle [of a rotating magnetic field] … can have no importance as anindustrial motor.”30 [029_BM029.xhtml#d499]Over the years there has been ample debate over whether Tesla or Ferraris shouldbe recognized as the inventor of the AC induction motor.31[029_BM029.xhtml#d500] To some extent, the confusion was created early on by thefact that the first reports in English of Ferraris’s 1888 paper left out hisanalysis of the waste heat produced and thus created the impression that apractical motor would follow from his investigations.32 [029_BM029.xhtml#d501]But as we have seen, Ferraris drew exactly the opposite conclusion in his paper:he did not think that a practical motor could be developed using a rotatingmagnetic field. Instead, Ferraris should be credited with being the first toinvestigate how AC can create rotating magnetic fields. Even more important,Ferraris should be given credit for introducing the notion of phase indiscussing alternating current phenomena. Thanks to Ferraris’s mathematicalanalysis, electrical engineers were able to quickly grasp the ideas behind theAC motor and polyphase currents. Nevertheless, it was Tesla who built the firstpractical AC induction motor.Meanwhile, we need to get back to Westinghouse. Upon reading reports ofFerraris’s paper, Westinghouse decided that it would be best to secure anypatent rights that might emanate from Ferraris’s work. Hence, Westinghouse senthis associate, Pantaleoni, to Turin in order to purchase the American rights toFerraris’s ideas for $1,000.33 [029_BM029.xhtml#d502] Just as he had done a yearearlier in securing patent control over AC transformers, Westinghouse purchasedthe rights to Ferraris’s work to gain broad coverage in the area of AC motors.At the same time that Westinghouse was learning about Ferraris, Shallenbergerexpressed concern that the Tesla patents might prevent the company fromsuccessfully developing an AC motor. In response, Westinghouse dispatched HenryM. Byllesby, vice president of Westinghouse Electric, and Thomas B. Kerr,general counsel, to New York in late May 1888.Peck asked Tesla to demonstrate his polyphase motors for Byllesby and Kerr atthe Liberty Street lab, and Byllesby reported to Westinghouse that the motorsseemed to operate satisfactorily. Although Tesla offered an explanation of hismotor, Byllesby complained that “his description was not of a nature which I wasenabled, entirely, to comprehend.” Byllesby noted that Tesla’s motors requiredmore than two wires, indicating that Tesla and Peck chose to hold back and notreveal the split-phase designs; after all, why show the customer everything atonce? Overall, Byllesby was impressed, and he told Westinghouse that “Themotors, as far as I can judge from the examination which I was enabled to make,are a success.”Undoubtedly drawing on his experience with selling Mutual Union to Jay Gould,Peck knew that he would have to bluff in order to get the best possible dealwith Westinghouse. Consequently, when Byllesby and Kerr expressed an interest inbuying the patents for Westinghouse, Peck informed them that a San Franciscocapitalist had offered $200,000 plus a royalty of $2.50 per horsepower for eachmotor installed. “The terms, of course, are monstrous,” Byllesby toldWestinghouse, “and I so told them … I told them that there was no possibility ofour considering the matter seriously.… In order to avoid giving the impressionthat the matter was one which excited my curiosity I made my visit short.”34[029_BM029.xhtml#d503]Despite Peck’s high price, Byllesby and Kerr nonetheless recommended thatWestinghouse buy the Tesla patents in order to secure broad coverage of theprinciple of using rotating magnetic fields. However, in order to force Peck toaccept a lower price, Westinghouse decided to send his star inventors,Shallenberger and William Stanley Jr., to inspect Tesla’s work. Perhaps theycould persuade Tesla and Peck that Westinghouse was in a stronger technicalposition and that they should back down. Sending Shallenberger and Stanley tosee Tesla was a bit like Steve Jobs’s dealings with Xerox’s Palo Alto ResearchCenter (PARC) in 1979. Determined to have PARC scientists show him their newgraphical user interface, Jobs had arranged for Xerox’s venture capital divisionto invest in his fledging Apple Computer so that PARC would have to cooperate.Much as Xerox capital was the “muscle” needed to force PARC to “open the kimono”and reveal its secrets, so Shallenberger and Stanley were the Westinghouse“muscle.”35 [029_BM029.xhtml#d504]Shallenberger visited Tesla’s lab on 12 June 1888, and Tesla demonstrated hismotors operating on four wires. Shallenberger quickly recognized that not onlyhad Tesla discovered the idea of using a rotating magnetic field eight monthsbefore he had but Tesla had gone ahead and produced a motor using thisprinciple. Unable to shake Tesla and Peck, Shallenberger returned to Pittsburghand urged Westinghouse to buy the patents.36 [029_BM029.xhtml#d505]Shallenberger’s trip was followed by a visit from Stanley on 23 June. As we haveseen, Stanley had helped Westinghouse develop single-phase AC electric lightingby designing a practical transformer and confirming the idea that transformersshould be connected to the generator in parallel, not in series. WhileWestinghouse lawyers filed patents for Stanley’s transformer design, GeorgeWestinghouse decided that the principle of using transformers in parallel shouldbe included in a patent filed on behalf of Gaulard and Gibbs. This decisiongreatly annoyed Stanley, but he stayed with Westinghouse in order to participatein the development of AC. Regarding Westinghouse as a rascal, Stanley laterobserved that he took “the advice of my father who said it was better to helpout a rascal if your friends were with him than to try to punish him.”37[029_BM029.xhtml#d506]Stanley gained access to Tesla because his father was Peck’s neighbor inEnglewood, New Jersey. Consequently, Peck knew all about the younger Stanley’sproblems with Westinghouse. Knowing that Stanley Jr. was a pioneer in AC but hadquite an ego, Peck was worried that Stanley might well be working on his own ACmotor. As Tesla explained, “Mr. Peck thought that Mr. Stanley was a man whowould imagine that he had made the invention, and might possibly come inconflict with me.”38 [029_BM029.xhtml#d507] To deal with Stanley, Peck decidedto go on the offensive and instructed Tesla to show Stanley both the polyphaseand split-phase motors. By doing so, they should be able to counter any claimsby Stanley that he had invented a motor better than Tesla’s.Upon arriving at the Liberty Street lab, Stanley promptly announced that the“Westinghouse boys” had developed an AC motor and were ahead of Tesla. Ratherthan taking the bait, Tesla quietly asked Stanley if he would like to see hismotor run on two wires—the motor that Tesla and Peck had not shown to Byllesbyand Kerr.39 [029_BM029.xhtml#d508] Upon seeing this motor, Stanley had to admitthat Tesla was indeed ahead of the Westinghouse engineers. “As far as I knowevery form of motor proposed by Mr. Shallenberger or myself has been tried byMr. Tesla,” reported Stanley to Westinghouse. “Their motor is the best thing ofthe kind I have seen. I believe it more efficient than most DC motors. I alsobelieve it belongs to them.”40 [029_BM029.xhtml#d509]Peck kept up the pressure on Westinghouse, telling Stanley that he was justabout to sell the patents to another party. With that news, Westinghouse decidedthat they should not wait any longer, and Kerr, Byllesby, and Shallenbergernegotiated an agreement with Peck and Brown.41 [029_BM029.xhtml#d510] On 7 July1888, Peck and Brown agreed to sell the Tesla patents to Westinghouse for$25,000 in cash, $50,000 in notes, and a royalty of $2.50 per horsepower foreach motor. Westinghouse guaranteed that the royalties would be at least $5,000in the first year, $10,000 in the second year, and $15,000 in each succeedingyear. In addition, Peck and Brown were reimbursed by the Westinghouse Companyfor all of the expenses they incurred during the development of the motor.42[029_BM029.xhtml#d511] In round numbers, the agreement meant that Westinghousewould pay Tesla, Peck, and Brown $200,000 over a ten-year period. Over the lifeof the patents (seventeen years), Tesla and his backers stood to make at least$315,000. Although it was not specified in the contract, Tesla agreed to come toPittsburgh and share what he had learned about AC motors with the Westinghouseengineers.Tesla did not walk away from the Westinghouse deal with $200,000 in his pocketbut shared the proceeds with Peck and Brown. Since they had shrewdly handled thebusiness negotiations and assumed all of the financial risk in developing themotors, Tesla gave Peck and Brown five-ninths of the proceeds from the dealwhile retaining four-ninths for himself. In this way, Tesla acknowledged theessential role Peck and Brown had played in developing the AC motor.43[029_BM029.xhtml#d512]SOJOURN AT WESTINGHOUSETesla moved to Pittsburgh in July 1888 in order to put his AC motor designs intoproduction. While in Pittsburgh, Tesla left Szigeti in New York where hecontinued to work on several motor patents that Tesla had not assigned toWestinghouse.44 [029_BM029.xhtml#d513]During his time in Pittsburgh, Tesla worked closely with Shallenberger and theother Westinghouse boys, and he developed a great admiration for GeorgeWestinghouse. “I like to think of George Westinghouse,” wrote Tesla,as he appeared to me in 1888.… A powerful frame, well proportioned with everyjoint in working order, an eye as clear as a crystal, a quick and springystep—he presented a rare example of health and strength. Like a lion in a foresthe breathed deep and with delight the smoky air of his factories. Though justforty then he still had the enthusiasm of youth. Always smiling, affable andpolite, he stood in marked contrast to the rough and ready men I met. Not oneword which would have been objectionable, not a gesture which might haveoffended.… And yet no fiercer adversary than Westinghouse could have been foundwhen he was crossed. An athlete in ordinary life, he was transformed into agiant when confronted with difficulties which seemed insurmountable. He enjoyedthe struggle and never lost confidence. When others would give up in despair, hetriumphed. Had he been transferred to another planet with everything againsthim, he would have worked out his salvation.45 [029_BM029.xhtml#d514]Tesla initially worked on improving two polyphase motors that he brought withhim from New York, anticipating that Westinghouse would develop a whole newpolyphase system using four wires to connect the generators and motors. Sincehis motors worked best on low frequencies, Tesla set up his motors to run on 50cycles and he experimented with new transformer designs.46[029_BM029.xhtml#d515]Westinghouse, however, hoped that one of Tesla’s motor designs could be used topower streetcars and operate on existing single-phase, two-wire circuits. Atthat time, the Westinghouse systems were using 133 cycles so that consumerswould not complain about their incandescent lamps flickering. Even though hefelt his ideal motor was the polyphase version running on 50 cycles, Teslaagreed to work a split-phase version that could be put into production. To adapthis motor for this purpose, Tesla and the Westinghouse boys made several designchanges including increasing the amount of copper wire in the rotors as well asreplacing the wrought-iron cores of the rotor and stator with soft Bessemersteel. The change to steel cores alone doubled the work that a typical motorcould perform and the Westinghouse Company treated this discovery as a tradesecret it jealously guarded for years. Tesla also worked with the chiefWestinghouse designer, Albert Schmid, to develop a standard frame for the statorthat could be easily cast and machined. While working on these changes, Teslaprepared patents for Westinghouse, and in 1889 he filed fifteen applications; interms of patents, this was the most productive year in his career.47[029_BM029.xhtml#d516]On the basis of these design changes, the Westinghouse Company built between 500and 1,000 split-phase Tesla motors in early 1889, but it is not clear how manyof these motors were actually shipped. Rather than install them in streetcars,Westinghouse initially marketed them for use in mining machinery.48[029_BM029.xhtml#d517] The company, moreover, decided to use graphite bearingsin these motors, which Tesla thought would overheat and fail. When Westinghousedid not follow his advice and began shipping these motors, Tesla decided that itwas time to leave.Disappointed, Tesla left Westinghouse in August 1889 and traveled to Europe tosee the Paris Exposition. To continue the work on his AC motors, Teslarecommended that Westinghouse put the project in the hands of his assistant,Charles F. Scott. An engineering graduate of Ohio State University, Scott hadbegun simply oiling dynamos for Tesla, but the inventor was impressed by Scott’sdiligence and quick mind.49 [029_BM029.xhtml#d518] (We will return to the storyof Tesla’s motor at Westinghouse in Chapter 9 [018_Chapter018.xhtml].)A FEW THOUGHTS ON ILLUSIONTesla’s experience with the AC motor reveals the central role that illusionplays in the process of technological change. Tesla’s AC motor was not“automatically” adopted by Westinghouse and the electrical engineering communitysimply because it was technically superior to other electric motors; in fact,Tesla’s motor required several years of serious engineering before it could beused in industry. Rather, Tesla and his backers succeeded in promoting his motorbecause they created the right sort of illusions about it. Guided by Peck andBrown, Tesla filed the “right” patents, secured the “right” technicalendorsement from Professor Anthony, gave the “right” sort oflecture-demonstration before the AIEE, and generated the necessary publicity inthe technical press. Once they had the “buzz” going, Peck knew how to playWestinghouse and his associates in order to sell the patents at the highestpossible price. Clearly Tesla’s motor moved forward not through the disclosureof cold, hard facts but through the careful orchestration of selectedinformation and subtle suggestion.The story of Tesla and the electric motor suggests that we need to develop moresophisticated ways to think about business decisions and technological choices.In the course of making choices about uncertain technologies, inventors andentrepreneurs must often extrapolate from what they currently know abouttechnology and markets to what may happen in the future. From economists,historians have learned to talk about this situation in terms of boundedrationality and path dependency.50 [029_BM029.xhtml#d519] Such concepts havedone much to guide our efforts to understand how specific contextual factorsinfluence key decisions, yet these concepts fail to take into account the veryreal ways in which individuals such as Tesla and Peck consciously sought toframe technological decision making. By carefully shaping the discourse aboutTesla’s motor, they effectively altered the ways in which electrical engineersthought about motors in the utility industry and thus created a “space” forTesla’s invention. Time and time again, it isn’t what people say that counts buthow they are perceived by others. Illusions play a significant role in guidingour understanding of how the “real” world works."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXSEARCHING FOR A NEW IDEAL(1889–1891)By August 1889 Tesla had grown restless and was ready to leave Westinghouse. Hehad uncovered the perfect idea for an AC motor, and it was up to others to workout the details. He was ready to move on to fresh fields.Living off what he had earned at Westinghouse, Tesla traveled to Europe thatsummer as a member of the delegation from the American Institute of ElectricalEngineers to the Congrès International des Electriciens. This congress was beingheld in conjunction with the Exposition Universelle in Paris, and so Tesla wasable to review the numerous electrical exhibits as well as the unveiling of theEiffel Tower.1 [029_BM029.xhtml#d520] While there, Tesla witnessed ademonstration lecture of vibrating diaphragms by the young Norwegian physicistVilhelm Bjerknes. It is likely that Bjerknes introduced Tesla to the discoveryof electromagnetic waves by Heinrich Hertz. In 1887, Hertz reported that he haddetected the electromagnetic waves that James Clerk Maxwell had predicted in histheoretical work on electricity and magnetism. Bjerknes had come to Paris toattend Henri Poincaré’s lectures on electrodynamics and subsequently spent twoyears at the University of Bonn as Hertz’s assistant. Together, Hertz andBjerknes studied resonance in oscillatory circuits.2 [029_BM029.xhtml#d521]Exhausted from the mundane engineering work at Westinghouse, Tesla found Hertz’sdiscovery stimulating, “like ever so many refreshing berries found on the roadby a weary wanderer.” Electromagnetic waves seemed to Tesla to be a wide-openfield, and as he waxed poetic in 1899, “The journey is not finished yet, and thewanderer is well-nigh exhausted. He longs for more sweet berries, and anxiouslyasks, ‘Did anyone pass this road before?’ ”3 [029_BM029.xhtml#d522]During the months that he had been in Pittsburgh, Tesla had paid the rent forhis laboratory so that Szigeti had a place to continue testing devices forTesla. When Tesla returned to New York, he went to work in a new laboratory at175 Grand Street. This lab consisted of one room divided by partitions; Tesla’sbacker, Brown, complained that the space was too small for the work he thoughtneeded to be done. Along with moving his laboratory, Tesla also changed hisresidence to the Astor House on Broadway between Barclay and Vesey streets. An“old fashioned and conservative establishment,” the Astor was the leading hotelin downtown Manhattan.4 [029_BM029.xhtml#d523]To help with the experiments at Grand Street, Tesla assembled a small team ofcraftsmen. Along with a German American glassblower, David Hiergesell, Teslaemployed two mechanics, a Hungarian named Charles Leonhardt and F. W. Clark, whohad worked at the Brown & Sharpe Works. Tesla also hired Paul Noyes, who hadhelped with the arc-lighting system in Rahway.5 [029_BM029.xhtml#d524]The key person among those working at Grand Street was, of course, Szigeti.Szigeti had been with Tesla for nine years, having followed him from Budapest toParis, Strasbourg, and New York. Tesla valued Szigeti’s advice in thelaboratory: “He was,” Tesla explained, “a man who had a considerable amount ofingenuity and intelligence, and [had] been installing electrical apparatus for along time before he came to America. He was not exactly a theoretical man, asmyself, but he could understand every idea fully.” By now Szigeti was more thanjust a trusted employee; as Tesla said later, “So long as he was in my employ hewas, I may say, a very intimate friend of mine, and I treated him as well as Ipossibly could.”6 [029_BM029.xhtml#d525]During this time, Tesla continued to work with the Tesla Electric Company, thefirm organized by Peck and Brown. In March and April 1890, Tesla filed threeadditional patents on AC motors and assigned them to this company; these werethe last patents he assigned to the company and all subsequent motor patentswere held by Tesla himself.7 [029_BM029.xhtml#d525a] Unfortunately for Tesla,Peck fell ill and moved to Asheville, North Carolina, perhaps in the hope ofregaining his health. Peck died in the summer of 1890.8 [029_BM029.xhtml#d526]Although Tesla continued to consult Brown over the next few years, Brown couldnot provide the shrewd business judgment that Peck had contributed to Tesla’searly success with the AC motor.In search of a new field to explore in his Grand Street lab, Tesla took measureof the overall development of electrical science and technology. As he saw it,electrical research could move in three major directions: high voltages, heavycurrents, or high frequencies. As he observed, “There were the excessiveelectrical pressures of millions of volts, which opened up wonderfulpossibilities if producible in practical ways; there were the currents of manyhundreds of thousands of amperes, which appealed to the imagination by theirastonishing effects, and most interesting and inviting of all, there were thepowerful electrical vibrations with their mysterious actions at a distance.” Ofthese three, Tesla decided that the most promising was the least investigated,namely high-frequency phenomena. There he felt he might make a contribution notonly to technology but also to theoretical science. “What better work could onedo,” asked Tesla, “than inventing methods and devising means for enablingscientific men to push investigation far out into these practically unknownregions?”9 [029_BM029.xhtml#d527]In turning to high-frequency phenomena, Tesla could draw on machines that he hadalready begun to develop. Prior to going to Pittsburgh in 1888, he had startedto think about how to run his motors on the existing Westinghouse circuits,which used 133-cycle single-phase AC. At the same time, Tesla wanted to increasethe speed of his motors. To address these two issues, Tesla designed a new ACgenerator. To get higher frequencies, he increased the number of poles in thestator from four to twenty-four. Since his motors were synchronous—meaning theyran at the same speed as the alternator—Tesla had to design the new generator sothat it could turn at relatively high speeds. By increasing both the number ofpoles and the speed in this alternator, Tesla was able to generate currents at2,000 cycles per second.10 [029_BM029.xhtml#d528]But now at Grand Street, Tesla wondered what new inventions could be developedusing current with a frequency of 10,000 or 20,000 cycles per second. To reachthese frequencies, Tesla built several alternators in 1890 with hundreds ofelectromagnets in their rotor and stator. The form of these electromagnets hadto be carefully planned since the rapid reversal of the current generatedunwanted heat in their iron or steel cores; Tesla likened the struggle betweenmaximizing the current while minimizing the heat as “a thoroughly Wagnerianopera” in which the inventor struggled “to get from the Scylla to theCharybdis.”11 [029_BM029.xhtml#d529] In order to run these generators at speedsup to 20,000 rpm, Tesla made some of his rotors in the form of a spoked wheeland he tinkered with the bearings and other mechanical aspects. In this work,Tesla drew on the experience he had acquired in designing dynamos and motors atthe Edison Machine Works and Westinghouse.12 [029_BM029.xhtml#d530]Tesla used his high-frequency generators to investigate potential applicationsrelated to arc lights and power distribution. During the early 1890s, arclights, which were widely used for street lighting, could only be operated on DCcircuits; when operated with AC they created an annoying sizzling soundproportional to the frequency of the alternating current. However, whenhigh-frequency AC was used, the sizzle moved beyond the realm of ordinaryhearing and it became possible to operate arc lights on AC circuits. As aresult, Tesla patented his first high-frequency generator as a method foroperating arc lights.13 [029_BM029.xhtml#d531]INVENTING THE TESLA COILWhile developing his generators, Tesla repeated the experiments of Hertz withelectromagnetic waves, for in Paris he had “caught the fire of enthusiasm andfairly burned with desire to behold the miracle with my own eyes.”14[029_BM029.xhtml#d532] This enthusiasm led to one of his most famous inventions,the Tesla coil.In his classic experiments to generate and detect electromagnetic waves, Hertzused a powerful induction coil connected to a battery, a current interrupter,and a spark gap (Figure 6.1 [015_Chapter015.xhtml#fig6_1]). To appreciateHertz’s experiments, though, we first need to understand how this induction coilworked. Commonly known as a Ruhmkorff coil, the induction coil consisted of twowindings—one with thick wire and the other fine—that were carefully insulatedfrom each other using paraffin or gutta-percha and wound around a common ironcore. As in a transformer, the thick winding was known as the primary while thefine winding was the secondary. The battery and current interrupter wereconnected to the primary while the spark gap was connected to the secondary.image [Images/PG_137_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 6.1. Diagram of apparatus used by Hertz to study electromagnetic waves.Key: A induction coil with thick and fine windings B battery C key or currentinterrupter H spark gap L -loop of wire with gap that Hertz used to detect wavesFrom Hawkins Electrical Guide (New York: Theo. Audel, 1915), 9:2268, fig. 3104.As with a transformer, it was a change in the current that made the inductioncoil produce high-voltage sparks. Hence, whenever the current interrupter openedor closed the circuit, the amount of current flowing from the battery into theprimary changed and caused the electromagnetic field around the primary coil toexpand or contract. As the primary field changed, it induced a current in thesecondary coil. Because of the different thicknesses of wire, the secondary coilcould have many more turns than the primary coil, thus greatly increasing thevoltage of the current induced in the secondary. Because the voltage produced inthe secondary was so high, it could ionize the air in the spark gap, allowing aspark to jump between the terminals. Carefully constructed induction coils couldproduce sparks that could jump a sixteen-inch gap.15 [029_BM029.xhtml#d533]During the middle of the nineteenth century, physicists used induction coils togenerate large amounts of electrical charge in order to study electrostaticeffects.But now let us return to Hertz. Prior to 1887, he conducted several experimentswith an induction coil in which he generated a series of sparks in the secondarywhenever the current interrupter opened the primary circuit in his apparatus. Asthe eminent historian of radio Hugh Aitken reminds us, these sparks“represented, of course, a sudden rush of electrical current—precisely the kindof acceleration of current flow, that, according to Maxwell’s equations, wouldgenerate electromagnetic radiation.”16 [029_BM029.xhtml#d534] Hertz noticed thatwhenever the sparks were produced at the induction coil, he could also detectsparks elsewhere in his laboratory using a copper loop with a spark gap. Bycarefully proportioning the diameter of this loop and adjusting the brass ballson either side of the spark gap on the secondary, Hertz was able to show thathis apparatus was generating electromagnetic waves that moved through space andwere detected by his loop.17 [029_BM029.xhtml#d535]In 1890, Tesla repeated Hertz’s experiments and may well have been the firstresearcher in America to do so. Not satisfied with the apparatus Hertz had used,Tesla altered the experimental setup (Figure 6.2[015_Chapter015.xhtml#fig6_2]).18 [029_BM029.xhtml#d536] An obvious step was toreplace the mechanical current interrupter with his high-frequency generator.Rather than have the apparatus use the few hundred cycles per second produced bythe mechanical interrupter, why not use 10,000 to 20,000 cycles from hisalternator? Tesla soon discovered that as the frequency increased, so did theamount of heat generated that melted the paraffin or gutta-percha insulationbetween the primary and secondary inside the induction coil. To address thisproblem, Tesla made two changes. First, he got rid of the insulation and insteadwound his induction coils with an air gap between the primary and the secondary.Second, because the iron core in the induction coil became so hot, he redesignedhis version so that the iron core could be moved in and out of the primary coil.By moving the core, Tesla found that he could also adjust the inductance of theprimary.19 [029_BM029.xhtml#d537]image [Images/PG_138_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 6.2. Diagram of a Tesla coil. Tesla also encountered problems with the condenser or capacitor that wasfrequently used with induction coils. To increase the strength of the sparkproduced by the secondary, investigators (beginning with Armand Hippolyte Fizeauin 1853) typically placed a Leyden jar or capacitor in a shunt around the sparkgap of the secondary. With the rapid alternations from his high-frequencygenerator, Tesla found that this capacitor often counteracted theself-inductance of the secondary coil and burned out the coil. In response,Tesla moved the capacitor in his apparatus between the generator and theprimary. He also made this capacitor adjustable.20 [029_BM029.xhtml#d538]Tinkering with the arrangement of the capacitor and coils was quite natural forTesla; in developing his split-phase motors, he had used combinations ofinduction coils, resistors, and capacitors to split and give the incomingcurrent different phases.21 [029_BM029.xhtml#d539]Tesla now realized that by carefully adjusting the capacitor and induction coilit was possible to boost the frequency to even higher levels. Electricalscientists had initially assumed that when the capacitor discharged, theelectricity simply flowed from one plate to the other, much like water runningout of a reservoir. However, in 1856, the British physicist Sir William Thomsonproved mathematically that capacitor discharge was instead vibratory.22[029_BM029.xhtml#d540] Just as a vertical weighted spring bobs up and down whenreleased, the electrical charge surges back and forth between the plates in thecapacitor until the stored-up energy is dissipated and flows through the circuitin the form of a high-frequency current.23 [029_BM029.xhtml#d541]In order to take full advantage of the vibratory character of the capacitordischarge, Tesla next carefully adjusted the induction coil. Just as thecapacitor can be thought of as the electrical equivalent of a weighted spring,an induction coil can be seen as the equivalent of a pendulum. As an alternatingcurrent flows through the primary, the current induced in the secondary coiloscillates between a maximum and a minimum value, much like the bob on amechanical pendulum swings to and fro. Tesla now realized that if he could matcheach electrostatic discharge or “thrust” so that it coincided with each maximumof the induced current, he could increase the voltage of the current produced bythe induction coil. Just as one can keep a mechanical pendulum going longer bygiving it a little nudge just as it reaches one end of its swing, Tesla adjustedhis capacitor and induction coil so that each “thrust” came just as the currentin the induction coil reached its maximum. In doing so, Tesla was takingadvantage of the principle of resonance—that one portion of the circuit wouldreinforce another portion of the circuit and thus boost the output. By creatingresonance by adjusting the capacitor and the induction coil, Tesla was soon ableto produce a current that alternated up to thirty thousand times per second.24[029_BM029.xhtml#d542] Fascinated with how resonance could create such powerfuleffects, Tesla looked for other places where he could take advantage ofresonance, and it quickly became the new ideal guiding his efforts withhigh-frequency phenomena.By combining his understanding of the vibratory nature of capacitor dischargewith the principle of resonance, Tesla now had an invention that producedcurrents whose voltage and frequency were higher than those generated by othermachines. Tesla called this invention his oscillating transformer, but as itcame to be widely employed by other investigators, it became known as the Teslacoil. The oscillating transformer was fundamental for much of Tesla’s subsequentwork on wireless power, and he felt that it was one of his great discoveries. Ashe recalled later, “When in 1900 I obtained powerful discharges of 100 feet andflashed a current around the globe, I was reminded of the first tiny spark Iobserved in my Grand Street laboratory and was thrilled by sensations akin tothose I felt when I discovered the rotating magnetic field.”25[029_BM029.xhtml#d543]In using his high-frequency generator and oscillating transformer together,Tesla soon learned about the physiological effects of high-frequency currents.Early on in his experiments, he accidentally touched the terminals of anoscillating transformer and the high-frequency current passed through his body.Much to his surprise, he was not injured. Tesla realized that, as a consequenceof the self-induction of the coil and the high frequency, the current producedin the secondary coil had a high voltage but a small amperage. Moreover, as weknow today, currents in the radio frequency range travel along the surface ofthe human body and do not harm the nerves and internal organs for shortexposures. Based on his own experiences, Tesla concluded in February 1891 that“the higher the frequency the greater the amount of electrical energy which maybe passed through the body without serious discomfort.”26 [029_BM029.xhtml#d544]This conclusion had potential safety benefits since one way to avoid beingelectrocuted by high-voltage AC would be to increase the frequency used in theexisting distribution systems.27 [029_BM029.xhtml#d545] Long concerned about thesafety of AC, Tesla’s rival Elihu Thomson further investigated the physiologicaleffects of high-frequency current.28 [029_BM029.xhtml#d546] In the meantime,Tesla capitalized on the skin effect in his public demonstrations. It wasbecause of the skin effect that he was able to grasp one terminal of hishigh-frequency apparatus and take tens of thousands of volts through hisbody—enough energy to brilliantly illuminate a bulb or tube that he held in hishand.HERTZIAN WAVES OR ELECTROSTATIC THRUSTS?As Tesla developed his oscillating transformer, he was confronted with thequestion of how to utilize this new device. Clearly it lent itself to exploringthe waves discovered by Hertz, but how should he direct his investigations?While we now know that Hertzian waves can be used for radio communications, thisapplication was not obvious to Tesla or other early investigators. As with anynew phenomenon, there may be different paths by which investigators may exploitit, and the choice of path reflects the knowledge and interests of theinvestigators.29 [029_BM029.xhtml#d547]One path was to concentrate on the theoretical implications of Hertz’sdiscovery. In Britain, a number of physicists and engineers—Oliver Lodge, OliverHeaviside, and George Francis FitzGerald—studied Hertz’s experiments andundertook the mathematical analysis necessary to connect Hertz’s results withMaxwell’s theory. Calling themselves Maxwellians, this group was primarilyconcerned with advancing electromagnetic theory.30 [029_BM029.xhtml#d548] SinceMaxwell had emphasized that visible light and the new waves wereequivalent—varying only by wavelength—the Maxwellians initially conductedoptical experiments to see if the new waves behaved like light. For instance,they tried using lenses made out of different materials (both glass and bitumen)to focus the new waves in the manner of light waves. While one Maxwellian, JohnPerry, commented in 1890 on the possibility of using Hertzian waves forcommunication, the Maxwellians assumed that any communication system using thenew waves would function more like a system of flashing lights than like anelectric telegraph. Indeed, as Sungook Hong has noted, the Maxwellians were notinterested in existing telegraph practice in the early 1890s and hence notprepared to convert Hertz’s discovery into wireless telegraphy.31[029_BM029.xhtml#d549]Tesla followed the work of Hertz and the Maxwellians by reading the electricaljournals, but he possessed neither the inclination nor the expertise to becomeinvolved in the complex mathematical discussions of the Maxwellians. (Even Hertzhimself was slow to engage in these mathematical discussions, leading Heavisideto remark in 1889 that “I see that Hertz is not a Maxwellian though he islearning to be one.”)32 [029_BM029.xhtml#d550] Instead, Tesla’s path forwardfrom Hertz’s discovery was marked by two characteristics. First, he decided tofocus less on the electromagnetic waves and more on the electrostatic effectscreated by his apparatus. Second, as an ambitious inventor, Tesla sought toconvert this scientific discovery into promising new technology.When researchers start investigating new phenomena, they often begin by usingexisting experimental practices and then develop new techniques as they becomefamiliar with the phenomena. Hence, just as the Maxwellians had started byconducting optical experiments, Tesla began studying his new oscillatingtransformer by repeating the usual demonstrations performed with a Ruhmkorffcoil. Previous investigators had used the Ruhmkorff coil to study sparks and theeffects of electrical charge or what are called electrostatic effects.One popular demonstration performed with a Ruhmkorff coil was to use electricsparks to render gases incandescent. To conduct this experiment, investigatorsused special glass tubes from which most of the air had been evacuated. Known asGeissler tubes, they had two platinum electrodes, and when connected to aRuhmkorff coil, the high voltages caused the gas to ionize and becomeluminescent.33 [029_BM029.xhtml#d551] In his experiments with his oscillatingtransformer, Tesla connected his coil to a Geissler tube and found that the tubeglowed intensely around each terminal while the middle appeared comparativelydark. These dark spaces had been previously studied by the British chemist SirWilliam Crookes.34 [029_BM029.xhtml#d552]Working with Geissler tubes, Tesla then made an important discovery. When heattached the terminals of his oscillating transformer to two spheres, the sparkjumped at the point where the gap between the balls was the smallest and thenclimbed up the sides of the spheres, only to be extinguished at the top and tostart again at the closest point. Modern experimenters refer to thisdemonstration as Jacob’s Ladder, and it is often seen in the apparatus used bymad scientists in monster and science-fiction movies. However, what Tesla foundstartling was that whenever the spark generated by the coil wasextinguished—such as at the end of a climb between the spheres—Geissler tubeslying nearby were illuminated and extinguished in unison with the spark. He alsonoticed that the tubes did not light up when they were at right angles to theterminals of his induction coil; to be illuminated, the tubes needed to beparallel with the terminals and the spark. This suggested to Tesla that thetubes were lit up as a result of the electric field produced by the spark, notby electromagnetic waves; if the waves were causing the tube to glow, hereasoned, then the position would have not mattered. Tesla repeated theexperiment with vacuum tubes without any electrodes and was amazed to find thatthese, too, became illuminated.35 [029_BM029.xhtml#d553]These observations convinced Tesla that Hertz and the Maxwellians had beenmisled. While the Ruhmkorff coil built up large amounts of charge and generatedelectromagnetic waves, in Tesla’s view, most of the energy in the apparatus wentinto electrostatic effects and not electromagnetic waves. As far as he wasconcerned, the buildup of charge created an electrical field in the spacesurrounding the coil, and when the spark was extinguished, the voltage of thisfield soared, causing the Geissler tubes to glow. According to Tesla,electrostatic “thrusts,” not Hertzian waves, caused the tubes to glow.In his May 1891 lecture on high frequency phenomena (described in the nextchapter), Tesla made clear that he disagreed with Hertz and Lodge. “Many havebeen carried away by the enthusiasm and passion to discover, but in their zealto reach results some have been misled,” he wrote. “Starting with the idea ofproducing electro-magnetic waves, they turned their attention, perhaps too muchto the study of electro-magnetic effects, and neglected the study ofelectrostatic phenomena.… It has thus been thought—and I believe asserted—thatin such cases most of the energy is radiated into space. In the light of theexperiments, which I have described above, it will now not be thought so. I feelsafe in asserting, that … the amount of the directly radiated energy is verysmall.”36 [029_BM029.xhtml#d554]Given that we now accept the Maxwellian interpretation of electromagnetic wavesto be true—it is found in all physics and electrical engineering textbooks—itmay seem ridiculous that Tesla chose to challenge this interpretation. However,we should keep in mind several points. First, Tesla was following awell-established principle in science: one does not propose a new theory whenthe old theory seems to explain most of what is going on. Second, much of thepower of the interpretation put forward by the Maxwellians lay in their abilityto mathematically represent electromagnetic phenomena and to subsequently usemathematics to predict new phenomena. Tesla was not interested in thesemathematical endeavors, and, even more important, he was not persuaded by them.What counted for him were the phenomena he was able to produce and observe inhis laboratory.Indeed, having observed how his oscillating transmitter caused the Geisslertubes to glow, Tesla’s next step was to convert this phenomenon into an excitingdemonstration. During one all-night work session, he sent his men out at 3:00 amto get something to eat. When they returned, they found him standing in themiddle of the laboratory, holding a long glass tube in each hand and with noconnection to his high-frequency coil. “If my theory is correct,” Tesla toldthem, “when the switch is thrown in[,] these tubes will become swords of fire.”He then ordered the room darkened, the switch thrown, and instantly the glasstubes lit up brilliantly.“Under the influence of great exultation,” Tesla recalled, “I waved them incircles round and around my head. My men were actually scared, so new andwonderful was the spectacle. They had not known of my wireless light theory, andfor a moment they thought I was some kind of a magician or hypnotizer.” Withthat experiment, Tesla knew wireless lighting was a reality and that he had ademonstration that could capture the imagination of audiences and attract newinvestors.37 [029_BM029.xhtml#d555]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENA VERITABLE MAGICIAN(1891)At one bound, [Tesla has] placed himself abreast of suchmen as Edison, Brush, Elihu Thomson, and AlexanderGraham Bell. Yet only four or five years ago, after aperiod of struggle in France, this stripling from the dimmountain border-land of Austro-Hungary landed on ourshores, entirely unknown, and poor in everything savegenius and training, and courage.JOSEPH WETZLER in Harper’s Weekly, July 1891BROKEN CONTRACTS, BROKEN HEARTSDuring the winter of 1890–91, Tesla was probably thinking about how to generatepublic interest and financial support for his inventions because his majorpatron, Westinghouse, was in deep financial trouble. Thanks to the company’sinnovative AC product line, annual sales at Westinghouse had grown from $800,000in 1887 to $4.7 million in 1890.1 [029_BM029.xhtml#d556] As sales boomed,though, Westinghouse had to develop an engineering staff and enlarge hisfactories. At the same time, Westinghouse joined Edison General Electric andThomson-Houston in buying out smaller companies and engaging in vigorous patentlitigation. Westinghouse partly financed this expansion by advancing the company$1.2 million of his own money, but he also borrowed heavily. By mid-1890, thefirm was carrying an additional $3 million in short-term liabilities when itstotal assets were about $11 million and current assets were $2.5 million.Disaster struck in November 1890 when the failure of a major London brokeragehouse, Baring Brothers, set off a financial panic and prompted Westinghouse’screditors to call in their loans. The Westinghouse Company was forced intoreceivership, and George Westinghouse struggled over the next two years to savethe company. After failing to gain support from Pittsburgh bankers, Westinghouseturned to Wall Street banker August Belmont, who organized a committee ofpowerful investors to reorganize the company.2 [029_BM029.xhtml#d557]According to John O’Neill—Tesla’s biographer in the 1940s—the investors whobacked this financial reorganization insisted that if Westinghouse wanted toretain control of his company, he would have to terminate Tesla’s contract,which called for royalty payments of $2.50 per horsepower for each motorinstalled. O’Neill claimed that the investors insisted on terminating thecontract to avoid paying Tesla millions of dollars in royalties and that thismoney would have supported much of his subsequent research.3[029_BM029.xhtml#d558]However, viewed from the perspective of early 1891, it is not likely thatTesla’s royalty payments would not have been a major cost confronting thereorganized company. Based on the terms of the 1888 contract with Tesla, Peck,and Brown, Westinghouse would have paid $105,000 by 1891, with Tesla receivingabout $47,000. Because there were only a handful of AC power systems that couldemploy Tesla’s motors, Westinghouse had sold very few motors and had probablynot paid any significant royalties before 1891. Moreover, given thatWestinghouse engineers had not solved the technical difficulties related toTesla’s motor designs (see Chapter 10 [019_Chapter019.xhtml]), neitherWestinghouse nor the bankers had any reason to worry that Tesla’s royaltypayments might amount to millions of dollars.4 [029_BM029.xhtml#d559] Tesla’smotor did prove to be a commercial success in the late 1890s, but there was noway to anticipate this in early 1891.Instead, it is more likely that investors insisted that Westinghouse terminatethe contract with Tesla because they felt that Westinghouse had spent too muchmoney and energy on developing new technology. As one Pittsburgh bankercomplained, “Mr. Westinghouse wastes so much on experimentation, and pays soliberally for whatever he wishes in the way of service and patent rights, thatwe are taking a pretty large risk if we give him a free hand with the fund hehas asked us to raise. We ought to at least know what he is doing with ourmoney.”5 [029_BM029.xhtml#d560] At the same time, the investment committeeorganized by Belmont wanted more say in the affairs of the reorganizedWestinghouse Company. Viewing Westinghouse as “a bright & fertile mechanic” wholacked tact and an understanding of high finance, the bankers sought tocircumscribe his power.6 [029_BM029.xhtml#d561] Hence, the request to terminatehis contract with Tesla probably grew more out of a desire on the part of thebankers to rein in Westinghouse and less out of fear that Tesla’s royaltieswould run into the millions.Reluctantly, then, Westinghouse went to Tesla and asked him to give up thecontract and help him retain control of the company. According to O’Neill, Teslathen tore up the contract in a grand flourish, demonstrating his loyalty toWestinghouse.7 [029_BM029.xhtml#d562] Yet at the same time, Tesla may well havebeen thinking about his own future in terms of who would control his patents. IfTesla retained the contract, then he would be negotiating with the investorsinstead of Westinghouse, and they might not be so inclined to spend money todevelop or promote his inventions. O’Neill suggested that Tesla preferred tocontinue to deal with Westinghouse on an informal basis and trust that thePittsburgh magnate would continue to support him in some way. (For instance, seeChapter 14 [023_Chapter023.xhtml].) For Tesla, personal loyalty counted morethan a legal contract.8 [029_BM029.xhtml#d563]Around the time that he tore up his contract with Westinghouse, Tesla wasconfronted with an equally great personal disappointment. After having been withTesla for nine years, Szigeti left sometime in 1890 to develop what he thoughtwould be his own great invention: a new compass for steering ships. When Szigetireturned five or six months later, Tesla told him that his compass invention hadalready been developed by Sir William Thomson, and this prompted Szigeti toleave for a second time in 1891. Tesla thought that Szigeti went south thissecond time, perhaps to South America, to pursue another invention scheme.Deeply hurt that Szigeti had left him, Tesla testified twenty years later how “Iwould have much desired to see him, because I would have wanted him.”9[029_BM029.xhtml#d564] With Szigeti, we see that Tesla was attracted to men andsought to form intimate friendships with them; we will further explore thisfacet of Tesla’s life in Chapter 12 [021_Chapter021.xhtml].NEW LAMPS FOR THE WORLDIn the aftermath of losing Szigeti and tearing up his contract withWestinghouse, Tesla began working harder to develop and publicize what he hadlearned about the new realm of high-frequency phenomena. Tesla could no longercount on royalty income from Westinghouse and now had to generate interest inhis new inventions in order to attract investors. Pursuing the business strategyhe had learned from Peck of patent-promote-sell, Tesla filed patentapplications, published several articles in the electrical journals, and gave asecond major lecture during the first half of 1891.As he experimented with his oscillating transformer, Tesla applied hisdiscoveries about electrostatic “thrusts” to developing new forms of electriclighting. Somehow the electrostatic thrusts were transmitting power throughspace; how might he use these thrusts to create new inventions? Knowing as we dothat Marconi converted Hertz’s discoveries into wireless telegraphy, it may seempuzzling at first that Tesla would choose to concentrate on lighting and notcommunications. Yet this choice made sense on several levels. For years,scientists had been fascinated by how Geissler tubes converted electricity intolight without heat. Prior to the introduction of electric lighting, artificialillumination—from candles, oil lamps, or gas lights—had involved a flame and theproduction of heat; how was it that the Geissler tube avoided producing heat? Atthe same time, Maxwell had emphasized in his theory that light and electricitywere related; why not follow up this idea and look for ways to convertelectricity directly into light?Tesla’s first step in this direction was to follow up on the experiment in whicha thin insulated wire wriggled and glowed brilliantly when attached to oneterminal of his oscillating coil. For Tesla, the rapid movement and streams oflight in the wire were the result of electrostatic thrusts causing intensevibrations in the molecules of the wire. To better capture this intense action,Tesla placed a thin platinum wire inside an evacuated bulb and found that itspun around, creating a cone of illumination.Tesla knew that the platinum wire became incandescent not because the metalitself had a high resistance but because he was using a very thin wire. However,suspecting that he would get even better results using a high-resistancematerial, Tesla did what Edison had done in developing his incandescent lamp in1879 and substituted carbon for the platinum wire. Rather than use a filament(as Edison did in his lamp), Tesla fashioned the carbon into a small sphericalbutton that he placed at the end of one wire; when connected to one terminal ofhis oscillating transformer, the high-frequency, high-voltage current broughtthe button to incandescence and it threw off a bright light.10[029_BM029.xhtml#d565] To focus the light from the incandescent button, Teslaadded a metal reflector outside the lamp. Since this lamp needed to be connectedto the power source by only one wire—normally incandescent lamps required twowires—Tesla immediately saw that this carbon button lamp had commercialpotential since it would reduce the wiring needed for electric lighting by half,and he proceeded to patent several variations.11 [029_BM029.xhtml#d566]THE COLUMBIA COLLEGE LECTUREBy the spring of 1891, Tesla realized that all of his new devices—hishigh-frequency alternator, oscillating transformer, and new lamps—constituted atechnology platform from which he could make a series of bold claims: that Hertzand the Maxwellians were paying too much attention to electromagnetic waves,that high-frequency AC could be readily converted into light, and that he was onthe threshold of revolutionizing the electrical industry with his new lamps.Tesla reported his initial findings in the Electrical Engineer in February 1891and was immediately challenged in print by Elihu Thomson. He, too, was workingwith high-frequency currents, but his experiments were under 10,000 cycles andso Thomson did not always observe the same effects as Tesla did. Not willing torelinquish even the smallest amount of ground to the other, Tesla and Thomsonsparred with each other in a string of articles published in the electricaljournals through March and April 1891.12 [029_BM029.xhtml#d567]This sparring with Thomson must have revealed to Tesla that he would need tomake a dramatic move if he were going to establish himself as the leading expertinvestigating high-frequency phenomena. Perhaps because Thomson had given akeynote lecture on AC phenomena at the spring 1890 meeting of the AmericanInstitute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), Tesla decided to lecture again beforethe institute; just as he had introduced his rotating-field motor by presentingit to this group three years earlier, now Tesla would launch his ideas abouthigh-frequency AC by speaking before the institute. In all likelihood, he wasable to get on the spring 1891 program since William Anthony was serving asinstitute president and Tesla’s acquaintance T. C. Martin was serving as thechair of the institute’s Committee on Papers and Meetings.13[029_BM029.xhtml#d568]As he had done in 1888, Tesla made sure that he had protected his inventions byfiling applications prior to the lecture. In late April and early May, he filedtwo U.S. patent applications for high-frequency incandescent lighting, and onthe day before the lecture, he submitted patent applications for protection inBritain, France, Germany, and Belgium.14 [029_BM029.xhtml#d569]Tesla spoke on the evening of 20 May 1891 at Columbia College in New York in thelecture hall of Theodore W. Dwight, Dean of the Law School. Although anelectrical engineering department had been established in 1889 in the ColumbiaSchool of Mines, the department lacked its own classroom, but the two electricalengineering professors, Francis B. Crocker and Michael Pupin, were probablyanxious to attract attention to their new department by hosting Tesla’s lecture.To provide power, Tesla installed his high-frequency alternator in the college’selectrical workshop (a modest brick building nicknamed the “cowshed”) andpowered it by an electric motor; using a switch onstage, Tesla could adjust thespeed of the motor and hence control the frequency produced by his alternator(Figure 7.1 [016_Chapter016.xhtml#fig7_1]).15 [029_BM029.xhtml#d570]Speaking in “pure, nervous English” to a large and eager audience, Tesla beganby remarking that modern science had been able to make rapid progress byrecognizing the ether as the medium in which invisible waves travel but that theexact nature of electricity was still unknown. Tesla proposed that electrostaticphenomena might be considered as the ether under strain while dynamicelectricity or currents should be seen as “phenomena of ether in motion.”Alluding to the work of Hertz and Lodge, Tesla informed the audience that theluminous effects in Geissler tubes were caused not by electromagnetic waves butelectrostatic “thrusts.”16 [029_BM029.xhtml#d571]image [Images/PG_151_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 7.1. Circuit used by Tesla for his 1891 lecture at Columbia College. Thecapacitor, inductance, and transformer on the right constituted his oscillatingtransformer or Tesla Coil.Redrawn from NT, “The True Wireless,” Electrical Experimenter, May 1919, 28–30ff., on p. 29. To support these claims, Tesla provided a series of demonstrations. As heincreased the number of cycles delivered to his oscillating transformer, the arcbegan to “sing”—to emit a high-pitched note. Tesla then demonstrated how hiscoil could generate a variety of streamers, sparks, and electric flames. Next heshowed how high-frequency current could be used to light up Geissler tubes andhis new lamps.17 [029_BM029.xhtml#d572] “Here,” reported the Electrical Review,“Mr. Tesla seemed to act the part of a veritable magician. It seemed to makelittle difference whether the lamps were lying on the table or whether they wereconnected by one terminal to one pole of the coil, or whether the lecturer tooka lamp in each hand and held one to each pole of the coil, … in each and everycase the filaments were brought to incandescence, to the supreme delight of thespectators.”18 [029_BM029.xhtml#d573]To help the audience appreciate the full potential of high-frequency AC forelectric lighting, Tesla offered a breathtaking demonstration (Figure 7.2[016_Chapter016.xhtml#fig7_2]). Two large zinc sheets were suspended from theceiling about fifteen feet from each other and connected to the oscillatingtransformer. With the auditorium lights dimmed, Tesla took a long gas-filledtube in each hand and stepped between the two sheets. As he waved the slendertubes, they glowed, charged by an electrostatic field set up between the plates.As Tesla explained, high-frequency current now made it possible to have electriclighting without wires, to have lamps that could be moved freely around aroom.19 [029_BM029.xhtml#d574]image [Images/pg_152.jpg]FIGURE 7.2. Tesla demonstrating his wireless lamps before the American Instituteof Electrical Engineers in May 1891.From “Experiments with Alternate Currents of Very High Frequency and TheirApplication to Methods of Artificial Illumination,” Electrical World, 11 July1891, pp. 18–19 (TC 3:86–87).This demonstration created a sensation and was featured in all of the articlespublished about Tesla’s Columbia lecture. Enthralled with the idea ofillumination without heat or flames, Joseph Wetzler predicted in Harper’s Weeklythat Tesla’s lamps would “bring a fairy-land within our homes.” “It is difficultto appreciate what those strange phenomena meant at that time,” Tesla laterrecalled. “When my tubes were first publicly exhibited they were viewed with[an] amazement impossible to describe.”20 [029_BM029.xhtml#d574a]Lest the audience be concerned about the safety of the high-frequency currents,Tesla followed the wireless lighting demonstration with a physiologicalexperiment. Holding a brass ball to one terminal of the oscillating transformer,Tesla adjusted the potential of the coil so that a stream of light came out ofthe other terminal of the coil. Estimating the potential across the terminals tobe 250,000 volts, Tesla then brought a second brass ball to the other terminalof the coil and let the full current pass through him. Thanks to the skineffect, the current remained on the surface of his body and he was unharmed.21[029_BM029.xhtml#d574b] Tesla concluded the lecture—which had lasted for threehours—by remarking that he had conducted additional interesting experiments inhis laboratory but regretted that he could not show them since he had run out oftime. Ever the showman, Tesla knew the importance of always keeping the audiencehungry by promising them more.Like his 1888 lecture, the Columbia lecture was a great success. “All whoattended Mr. Tesla’s brilliant lecture on Wednesday evening,” noted theElectrical Review, “will remember that occasion as one of the scientific treatsof their lives.”22 [029_BM029.xhtml#d575] The lecture was reported in thetechnical press as well as the New York newspapers. The written version of thelecture—prepared in the weeks following the presentation—was widely reprintedand an excerpt appeared in Literary Digest.23 [029_BM029.xhtml#d576] For themost part, the press was excited not only by the sensational demonstrations butalso by the commercial potential of Tesla’s wireless electric lights. Hisexperiments with high frequencies seemed to show that AC was “the El Dorado ofthe electrician” whereby it would be possible to produce light efficiently andwithout losses from heat or flames.24 [029_BM029.xhtml#d577] “It is impossibleto read Mr. Tesla’s epoch making paper without admiration at the clearness ofview and ingenuity of mind exhibited throughout,” remarked the TelegraphicJournal and Electrical Review. “It would seem that we are at last fairlyprogressing towards a means of transforming energy into any form we wish withoutsuch a disastrous loss of availability as is now inevitable, and a large measureof the credit must be given to Mr. Tesla for helping so much forward to thisgreat end.”25 [029_BM029.xhtml#d578] Supremely confident of Tesla’s ability tomove from theory to practice, the Electrical Engineer chimed in, “With themethod now clearly pointed out, we believe that it will take but a comparativelyshort time to work out and present to the public the practical details necessaryfor the general application of such a system.”26 [029_BM029.xhtml#d579]Although the press was impressed with Tesla’s creative accomplishments, noteveryone in the electrical world was captivated by the way Tesla came across inprint. In particular, the English journal Industries took the inventor to task:“We think, however, that anyone who has read many of Mr. Tesla’s articles musthave difficulty in understanding the frequent vague and idiomatic statementswith which they abound. We do not think it too much to ask an electricianoccupying such a prominent position as Mr. Tesla has gained for himself inAmerica to omit passages that may detract from his reputation, and to allow usto admire him even more. If Mr. Tesla could keep phantom ideas about theelectromagnetic theory of light and Hertz and Dr. Lodge out of his work, we feelsure he would make his interesting experiments more clear.”27[029_BM029.xhtml#d580]Nevertheless, the Columbia lecture firmly established Tesla as one of theleading electrical inventors in America, and he had done so in a few short yearsafter landing in New York. “At one bound,” exulted Wetzler, Tesla “placedhimself abreast of such men as Edison, Brush, Elihu Thomson, and AlexanderGraham Bell. Yet only four or five years ago, after a period of struggle inFrance, this stripling from the dim mountain border-land of Austro-Hungarylanded on our shores, entirely unknown, and poor in everything save genius andtraining, and courage.”28 [029_BM029.xhtml#d581]Basking in the role of the poor immigrant who made good, Tesla decided it wastime for him to become an American citizen. In July 1891, he filed anapplication for naturalization in the Common Pleas Court of New York. As hisformer nationality he listed “Austrian,” but as his occupation he listed “civilengineer,” reflecting what he had studied in Graz.29 [029_BM029.xhtml#d582]Tesla had come a long way from his student days in Austria.BRINGING THE EARTH INTO HIS CIRCUITSWhile Tesla enjoyed the publicity following his Columbia lecture, he wasnonetheless determined to keep shaping his ideas into practical inventions. Hewas especially keen to follow up on the demonstration in which gas-filled tubesglowed when placed between two electrified plates. “That was an experiment whichcarried the whole world by storm,” Tesla recalled, “but to me it was the firstevidence that I was conveying energy to a distance, and it was a tremendous spurto my imagination.”30 [029_BM029.xhtml#d583]Through the summer and fall of 1891, Tesla began to scale up his demonstrationapparatus. Onstage he had used his high-frequency alternator and oscillatingtransformer to transmit energy between two plates separated by fifteen feet; howmuch farther might he be able to convey energy without wires? To find out, Teslasubstituted a large metal can for one plate and placed it on the roof of hisGrand Street lab (Figure 7.3 [016_Chapter016.xhtml#fig7_3]). In lieu of theother plate, Tesla connected his apparatus to the building’s water pipe systemto ground it. In configuring his system in this manner, Tesla may have beeninfluenced by a circuit patented in 1886 by Amos E. Dolbear of Tufts College; byconnecting one terminal of an induction coil to a large capacitor and groundingthe other terminal, Dolbear found that he was able to transmit telephone signalsfrom the college laboratory to his home nearby.31 [029_BM029.xhtml#d584] Ingrounding the circuit, Dolbear was using a technique already in common practicein telegraphy and telephony. First discovered by Carl August von Steinheil in1838, electricians had discovered that it was possible to operate a telegraphcircuit with one wire running between the transmitter and receiver and thenconnecting both devices to plates buried in the ground since the current couldmove through the Earth and hence complete the circuit.32 [029_BM029.xhtml#d585]With the can and Earth connected to the terminals of his high-frequencyapparatus, Tesla’s idea “was that I would disturb the electrical equilibrium inthe nearby portions of the earth, and the equilibrium being disturbed, thiscould then be utilized to bring into operation in any way some instrument.”33[029_BM029.xhtml#d586]image [Images/PG_155_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 7.3. Diagram showing how Tesla grounded his transmitter and receiver.In his 1916 testimony, Tesla reported that he used arrangements like this asearly as 1891. Tesla used a large metal can for the elevated capacity in thetransmitter.Redrawn from NT, “The True Wireless,” Electrical Experimenter, May 1919, 28–30ff., on p. 29.Just as he had carefully adjusted the components in his oscillating transformerin order to boost the voltage and frequency of the output (see Chapter 6[015_Chapter015.xhtml]), Tesla found that the elevated can did not providesufficient capacity to match the frequency of the generator. To remedy this, heintroduced an adjustable induction coil.34 [029_BM029.xhtml#d587] However, hedid not at this point think about adjusting the induction coils in thetransmitter and the receiver so that they would resonate at the same frequencyand hence be tuned (see Chapter 10 [019_Chapter019.xhtml]). Instead, Teslaadjusted the induction coil and capacitor so as to create a maximum electricalcurrent in the Earth and hence potentially illuminate as many wireless lamps aspossible.On the receiving end, Tesla tried a variety of lamps. As we have seen with theColumbia lecture, some lamps needed no wires and simply glowed, charged by theelectric field set up between the Earth and the can. Tesla also got good resultsconnecting the lamps to a plate or to the ground. These results gave him hopethat with the right lamp design, it should be possible to develop a wirelesslighting system that could compete with Edison’s incandescent lighting system.Consequently, Tesla kept his glassblower busy as he experimented with a widerange of lamps—some with filaments and others with carbon buttons.35[029_BM029.xhtml#d588]But as the inventor of an AC motor, he was also intent on transmitting power.Toward this end, Tesla returned to a motor reminiscent of his experiments inStrasbourg, one consisting of a copper disk placed next to the iron core of aninduction coil (see Figure 9.2). When powered by AC, the coil created a changingmagnetic field that induced eddy currents in the disk; since the eddy currentswere opposed to the magnetic field, they caused the disk to rotate.36[029_BM029.xhtml#d589] Tesla now found that it was possible to provide power tothis motor using a single wire connected to his oscillating transformer and asuspended plate. Here the circuit was completed by the electrical field set upbetween the metal can on the transmitter side and the plate on the motor side.Knowing that the motor needed to be connected to a large capacitor and that thehuman body offered a large capacitance, Tesla found that he could remove theplate and make the motor run simply by holding a wire connected to the motor.Pleased that he could make the motor run on a single wire, he experimentedfurther with a “no wire” motor in which the motor was connected to a plate andto the ground. Although Tesla could make the motor turn, the wirelessarrangement did not deliver as much energy as the single-wire connection.37[029_BM029.xhtml#d590]These experiments suggested to Tesla that he could transmit electricity forlight and power over a distance and that he might be able to eliminate all thecopper wires used in electric lighting, telegraph, and telephone systems.Thrilled with this possibility, Tesla sought to convey his vision to hisassistants. “They had seen me run the wire up the building, they had seen meoperate continuously with those machines,” Tesla testified later. “I had shownthem wonderful results, and had told them all the time that I was going totransmit energy without wire[s]—telephone, telegraph, run [street]cars andlights at any distance—and that these were the primary steps toward this end.How much these men could tell … I am unable to say; but, certainly, I had plentyof witnesses to follow my work, and to know what I had been doing.”38[029_BM029.xhtml#d591]These experiments from 1891 may look suspiciously like modern radio and maysuggest that Tesla invented radio before Marconi; indeed that was the argumentTesla tried to make years later through testimony and publications.39[029_BM029.xhtml#d592] Clearly Tesla was the first investigator ofelectromagnetic waves to appreciate the importance of grounding the transmitterand receiver, a fundamental insight that Marconi came to in 1895.40[029_BM029.xhtml#d593] Moreover, Tesla devised novel circuits using capacitorsand induction coils, and his circuits were subsequently used and modified byMarconi and other early radio researchers to perfect wireless telegraphy.But while he understood the significance of grounding for the exploitation ofelectromagnetic waves and devised several key circuits, we should note that,even at this early stage, Tesla was making choices that would lead him away fromwhat we commonly think of as radio. First and foremost, Tesla was notparticularly interested in creating a communications system. For him, the bigopportunity was not to imitate telegraph systems but develop the next generationof technology for delivering light and power; as we will see, it was Marconi whowanted to utilize electromagnetic waves to create a wireless alternative to thetelegraph. Second, though Tesla knew he was generating waves that radiatedthrough space, he was becoming much more curious about the current that passedthrough the ground; he was fascinated by having the Earth in his circuits. Andthird, though one can adjust either the capacitance or inductance of thecircuits, we see that Tesla was already concentrating on changing theinductance.Hence, rather than thinking about the history of radio as a race to a specificgoal, we should realize that a new discovery (like the existence ofelectromagnetic waves) does not have to lead to a single new technology (likewireless telegraphy). Instead, what makes the history of a technology like radiointeresting is that the same discovery can prompt different investigators topursue different paths. All too often, by focusing on Marconi’s commercialsuccess with wireless telegraphy, we overlook the diversity of approachespursued by rival inventors. In the chapters that follow we will see that Tesla’spersonality, skills, and insights led him to shape his 1891 experiments into atechnology that was distinctly different than the wireless telegraphy pursued byMarconi. As the poet Robert Frost said, “Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— /I took the one less traveled by, / And that has made all the difference.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTTAKING THE SHOW TO EUROPE(1891–1892)In the months following the Columbia lecture, Tesla tried to ignore the publicacclaim and concentrate on his high-frequency experiments. “When my tubes werefirst publicly exhibited they were viewed with [an] amazement impossible todescribe,” Tesla recalled. “From all parts of the world I received urgentinvitations and numerous honors and other flattering inducements were offered tome, which I declined.” With cans on the rooftop and grounded circuits, he wasgetting promising results and felt little desire to interrupt his labors. As theElectrical World observed in January 1892, “In his skillful hands theexperiments have extended far beyond their merely theoretical importance in thedirection of important practical applications.… Many of the practicaldifficulties that at first appeared have been overcome and we may ere long seethe results in commercial work.”1 [029_BM029.xhtml#d594]Yet developments in Europe soon drew Tesla out of the laboratory and back to thelecture hall. For several years, the electrical journals in Britain hadperiodically raised the question of whether Ferraris had developed a motor witha rotating field, and Tesla continued to insist that he had filed patents monthsbefore Ferraris had published his results (see Chapter 5[014_Chapter014.xhtml]). Meanwhile, a German engineer, F. A. Haselwander,claimed that he had invented a three-phase motor that delivered ten horsepowerin the summer of 1887. Haselwander did not get his motor to actually work until12 October 1887, which was a month after Tesla’s successful demonstration of hisrotating field using the shoe-polish tin. Equally, while Tesla promptly filedpatent applications in October 1887, Haselwander did not file an application forhis design until July 1888.2 [029_BM029.xhtml#d595]But even more worrisome for Tesla were events at the Electrotechnical Exhibitionin Frankfurt, Germany, in August and September 1891. Desiring to establish amunicipal electric power system and unable to determine the best system for itsneeds, the city of Frankfurt commissioned an electrical engineer, Oskar vonMiller, to organize an exhibition so that experts could study the state of theart.3 [029_BM029.xhtml#d596] Hoping to secure the Frankfurt contract, theleading electrical manufacturing firms exhibited at Frankfurt, and manycompanies emphasized their AC equipment in their displays.But in addition to the exhibits, von Miller also arranged for a spectaculardemonstration of the potential of polyphase AC for transmitting power over longdistances. Using a hydroelectric station he had set up at a cement plant inLauffen on the Neckar River, von Miller convinced the Imperial German PostalAuthority to build a high-voltage line to carry power 110 miles (175 kilometers)from Lauffen to Frankfurt. At Lauffen, the generators and transformers weredesigned by Charles E. L. Brown of the Swiss firm Oerlikon. At the Frankfurt endof the line, von Miller commissioned Michael von Dolivo-Dobrowolsky, the Russianchief engineer of Allgemeine Elektricitats-Gesellschaft of Berlin, to build themotors. Drawing on British patents he had filed in 1890 and 1891,Dolivo-Dobrowolsky used three-phase current but reduced the number of wiresneeded for his system. While Tesla’s most promising three-phase system requiredsix wires to run between the generator and motor, Dolivo-Dobrowolsky employed aY-connection (also known today as wye connection) that joined the three wirescoming out of the generator and transformers to a common grounded return andthus reduced the number of wires needed in his system. To differentiate hisideas from the existing single-phase and polyphase schemes, Dolivo-Dobrowolskycalled his system drehstrom, which means “rotary current” in German.4[029_BM029.xhtml#d597] Skeptical engineers expected the Lauffen-Frankfurt systemto be able to transmit only 50% of the power generated at Lauffen; they wereastounded when the system operated with an efficiency of 75%. Based on thecareful engineering work of von Miller, Brown, and Dolivo-Dobrowolsky, theLauffen-Frankfurt line demonstrated for the first time the full commercialpotential of polyphase AC.5 [029_BM029.xhtml#d598]Although the Lauffen-Frankfurt line confirmed his original ideas about the valueof polyphase current, Tesla was disturbed to see reports in the electricaljournals that gave credit to Brown and Dolivo-Dobrowolsky for the idea of usingthree-phase current. While Brown bluntly stated “The three-phase current asapplied at Frankfurt is due to the labors of Mr. Tesla, and will be foundclearly specified in his patents,” the patent situation in Europe was far fromclear.6 [029_BM029.xhtml#d599] In the course of developing the AC motor, Teslahad filed patent applications in several foreign countries including England andGermany, but he had neither issued any licenses to European manufacturers norenforced them by taking legal action against infringers.7 [029_BM029.xhtml#d600]“There is some ill feeling here,” reported Carl Hering from the FrankfurtExhibition, “as to who the inventor is of this system [i.e., three-phase AC] andwho has the right to use it, but it is quite likely that it originated in theUnited States and is public property here.”8 [029_BM029.xhtml#d601]Worried that he would not be recognized as the inventor of polyphase AC andanxious to solidify his patent position in Europe, Tesla decided to travel toEurope to lecture on his high-frequency research and look after his foreigninterests. Given that Westinghouse was no longer paying him any royalties, Teslaalso needed to generate income by licensing European electrical companies tomanufacture his motor. Sir William Crookes, the president of the Institution ofElectrical Engineers, had invited him to lecture in London, and Tesla had alsoreceived an invitation to speak in Paris before the Société de Physique and theSociété International des Electriciens.9 [029_BM029.xhtml#d602]After Paris, Tesla planned to visit his family in Croatia and Serbia. He wasespecially anxious to see his mother. As he recalled in his autobiography, hemissed her terribly but had found it too hard to break away from the laboratoryin order to travel home to see her. Now, however, “a consuming desire to see heragain gradually took possession of me. This feeling grew so strong that Iresolved to drop all work and satisfy my longing.”10 [029_BM029.xhtml#d603]Tesla sailed from New York on the Umbria on 16 January 1892 and arrived inEngland ten days later. In London, Sir William Preece, a distinguishedelectrician and head of the telegraph department of the British Post Office,invited Tesla to stay at his home.11 [029_BM029.xhtml#d604] Determined to“change the attitude of scientific men and engineers very considerably, both asregards the utilisation of rotary-current motors and as to the credit whichshould be given to this most interesting discovery,” Tesla met at once with areporter from the London Electrical Engineer. Three days after his arrival, thejournal ran a profile of Tesla that detailed how his research on AC motorspreceded the work of Ferraris, Haselwander, and Dolivo-Dobrowolsky. 12[029_BM029.xhtml#d605]To help set the stage for Tesla’s London lecture, Crookes published a highlyspeculative piece on electricity in the Fortnightly Review. Along withdiscussing how electricity might improve harvests, kill parasites, purifysewage, and control the weather, Crookes introduced general readers to thelatest discoveries made by Hertz, Lodge, and Tesla about electromagnetic waves.Like other British electrical scientists, Crookes likened Hertzian waves tolight and assumed that they would be manipulated using lenses. At the same time,he speculated about how these waves might be used for communications:Rays of light will not pierce through a wall, nor, as we know only too well,through a London fog. But the electrical vibrations of a yard or more inwave-length of which I have spoken will easily pierce such mediums, which tothem will be transparent. Here, then, is revealed the bewildering possibility oftelegraphy without wires, posts, cables, or any of our present costlyappliances. Granted a few reasonable postulates, the whole thing comes wellwithin the realms of possible fulfillment. At the present time experimentalistsare able to generate electrical waves of any desired wave-length from a few feetupwards, and to keep up a succession of such waves radiating into space in alldirections.… Also an experimentalist at a distance can receive some, if not all,of these rays on a properly-constituted instrument, and by concerted signalsmessages in the Morse code can thus pass from one operator to another.Crookes went into particular detail about Tesla’s experiments usinghigh-frequency AC to power lamps without using any wires, promising that homesmight soon be lighted with brilliant wireless lamps.13 [029_BM029.xhtml#d606]THE LONDON LECTURESThe stage thus set, Tesla lectured before the Institution of ElectricalEngineers on 3 February 1892. Anticipating a large turnout, the electricalengineers decided to hold the lecture not in their usual meeting place, theInstitution of Civil Engineers (which held four hundred), but the RoyalInstitution (which could accommodate eight hundred). In return for this favor,the managers of the Royal Institution asked that Tesla repeat his lecture thefollowing night for its members.14 [029_BM029.xhtml#d607]At first Tesla was reluctant to repeat the lecture, and it fell upon JamesDewar, the Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution, toconvince him to do so. “I was a man of firm resolve but succumbed easily to theforceful arguments of the great Scotchman,” recalled Tesla. “He pushed me into achair and poured out half a glass of a wonderful brown fluid which sparkled inall sorts of iridescent colors and tasted like nectar. ‘Now,’ said he, ‘you aresitting in Faraday’s chair and you are enjoying whiskey he used to drink.’ ”15[029_BM029.xhtml#d608] Honored, Tesla agreed to a second performance.It was not lost on Tesla that he would be lecturing on the same stage where inthe 1830s Faraday had introduced the fundamental principles of electromagneticinduction.16 [029_BM029.xhtml#d609] But as thrilling as it was, it must havealso been intimidating. The audience at Royal Institution lectures was anerudite group, and the meetings were both social as well as scientificoccasions. Evening dress was worn, and a substantial number of ladies oftenattended. The lecture hall was an amphitheater, with the seats rising steeply infront of the stage. Traditionally the lectures were expected to last only onehour, with no lengthy introductions or votes of thanks.17 [029_BM029.xhtml#d610]Before a packed audience that included the leading British electrical engineersand scientists in the front row, Tesla began by praising Crookes, telling theaudience that “what I have to tell you and to show you this evening concerns, ina large measure, that same vague world which Professor Crookes has so ablyexplored.” Tesla recalled that while in college he had read a paper in whichCrookes described his early experiments with radiant matter and that theseexperiments had made a deep impression on him.18 [029_BM029.xhtml#d611]Having invoked Crookes, Tesla proceeded with several brilliant demonstrations.Holding a long, evacuated glass tube in one hand, Tesla grasped one terminal ofhis oscillating transformer and the tube “glowed with a brilliant lambent flamefrom end to end, and recalled to every one the idea of the magician’s enchantedwand.” Standing on an insulated platform, he brought his body into contact withone terminal of his oscillating transformer and streams of light burst forthfrom the other terminal. Turning to the audience, Tesla asked, “Is thereanything more fascinating than the study of alternating currents?”19[029_BM029.xhtml#d612]Although the British journal Engineering grumbled that it was “a breach of thedramatic canons to start with an experiment of such brilliancy, and then todescend to others of less importance,” the audience loved it and broke intoapplause. Now fired up, Tesla used his coil to perform more wonders: six-inchsparks jumped between balls; two long wires, one foot apart and stretched acrossthe well of the theater, glowed blue along their entire length; and between twowire circles he created “a palpitating purple disk of great beauty.” In honor ofLord Kelvin, the prominent British physicist, Tesla used his coil to illuminatea sign that spelled out his common name, William Thomson (see Figure 8.1[017_Chapter017.xhtml#fig8_1]).20 [029_BM029.xhtml#d613]As Tesla “showed wonder after wonder,” reported a commentator in Nature, “theinterest of [the] audience deepened into enthusiasm.” Captivated by his modestyand charm, the audience ignored his “broken English and imperfect explanationsdid not detract from his success. His marvelous skill as an experimentalist wasevident and unmistakable.”21 [029_BM029.xhtml#d614]Tesla then showed the audience what he had observed about electric brushphenomena in evacuated bulbs with a single electrode inside. When powered by hishigh-frequency coil, a glowing discharge—called the brush—could be seen betweenthe electrode and the inside wall of the bulb. (Today we regard the brush to bea stream of electrons.) Tesla reported that he had noticed that the brush couldbe manipulated by a magnet and that it rotated in a clockwise direction as aresult of the earth’s magnetic field. Impressed with how the brush inside thebulb responded to slight electrical and magnetic changes, Tesla speculated thatit might “find practical applications in telegraphy. With such a brush it wouldbe possible to send dispatches across the Atlantic, for instance, with anyspeed, since its sensitiveness may be so great that the slightest changes willaffect it.”22 [029_BM029.xhtml#d615] Here Tesla was anticipating the firstelectronic vacuum tubes of Lee de Forest and J. A. Fleming that were usedfifteen years later to detect and amplify weak radio signals. However, to make apractical radio tube, de Forest and Fleming discovered that it was necessary touse several electrodes to manipulate and control the electron stream inside thetube.image [Images/PG_165_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 8.1. Apparatus used by Tesla in his 1892 London lecture to illuminate SirWilliam Thomson’s name.From NT, Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and HighFrequency (New York: McGraw Publishing Co., 1904; rep. Hollywood, Calif.:Angriff Press, 1986), fig. 9 on p. 27.But in the lecture, Tesla did not elaborate on this speculation and moved to atopic that intrigued him much more. “A most curious feature of alternatecurrents of high frequencies and potentials,” he told the audience, “is thatthey enable us to perform many experiments by the use of one wire only.” Teslathen demonstrated how his disk motor could be operated with one wire connectedto the transformer and another connected to a suspended plate, and he boldlyhypothesized how this motor could even be run without any wires, simply drawingpower from the atmosphere charged with electricity (Figure 8.2[017_Chapter017.xhtml#fig8_2]).23 [029_BM029.xhtml#d616]Tesla next showed a variety of single-wire lamps. These lamps consisted of atiny button of a high-resistance material such as carbon or carborundum that wasrendered incandescent when powered by a high-frequency power current. Oneobserver estimated that the lamps produced about five candlepower.24[029_BM029.xhtml#d616a] In showing his lamps, Tesla theorized about the causesof incandescence and phosphorescence, and he discussed Crookes’s notion ofradiant matter, but this theorizing was not central to the performance. As A. P.Trotter, editor of The Electrician, reminisced, “[Tesla] did not write and reada paper, nor did he give a lecture, and he was so occupied in waving longglowing electrodeless tubes in the air, and lighting up of ordinary incandescentlamps by a current taken through his body, that he had no time to explain ‘howit was done.’ Nor, I think, could he.”25 [029_BM029.xhtml#d616b]image [Images/PG_166.jpg]FIGURE 8.2. Single-wire motor demonstrated by Tesla in his 1892 London lecture.From NT, Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and HighFrequency (New York: McGraw Publishing Co., 1904; rep. Hollywood, Calif.:Angriff Press, 1986), fig. 17 on p. 55.Tesla then repeated his celebrated demonstration of placing a long tube betweentwo plates and invited the audience to imagine similar wireless lamps glowing intheir homes.26 [029_BM029.xhtml#d617] For his finale, Tesla topped thisdemonstration by introducing a new tube, which, like a Crookes radiometer,contained a tiny fan with mica blades. However, while the fan in a radiometerturns as a result of light hitting the blades, Tesla made his fan turn whenplaced in the electrostatic field between the two suspended plates. More than aglowing lamp, the tiny fan demonstrated to the audience the power being derivedfrom the electrostatic field. When shown the fan spinning as a result of theinvisible field, the audience was amazed. “The scientists,” recalled Tesla,“simply did not know where they were when they saw it.”27 [029_BM029.xhtml#d618]“For a full two hours,” noted the Electrical Engineer,Mr. Tesla kept his audience spellbound, with easy confidence and the most modestmanner possible displaying his experiments, and suggesting, one after another,outlooks for the practical application of his researches.… Even at the end, Mr.Tesla tantalisingly informed his listeners that he had shown them but one-thirdof what he was prepared to do, and the whole audience … remained in their seatsunwilling to disperse, insisting upon more, and Mr. Tesla had to deliver asupplementary lecture.28 [029_BM029.xhtml#d619]Although it was not customary, at the conclusion of the second performance atthe Royal Institution Lord Rayleigh, a prominent British physicist, insisted ongiving a vote of thanks to Tesla. Praising Tesla, Rayleigh remarked that “Mr.Tesla has not worked blindly or at random, but has been guided by the proper useof a scientific imagination. Without the use of such a guide we can scarcelyhope to do anything of real service. Mr. Tesla has the genius of a discoverer,and we may look forward to a long career of discovery for him.”29[029_BM029.xhtml#d620]Tesla took Rayleigh’s remarks as a great compliment and a source of inspiration.“Up to that time,” Tesla said, “I never realized that I possessed any particulargift of discovery but Lord Rayleigh, whom I always considered as an ideal man ofscience, had said so.” Tesla interpreted Rayleigh’s compliment in a particularway; if he was indeed destined not just to invent but to discover, Tesla feltthat henceforth “I should concentrate on some big idea.”30[029_BM029.xhtml#d621]In the week following Tesla’s lectures, the London press “was full of thrillingaccounts of this wizard who defied scientific explanation.” Anxious to know moreabout the man behind the magic, Trotter and several engineers organized aninformal dinner for Tesla. “We were all young and eager to know more of Tesla’sattractive personality,” Trotter recalled. Over dinner, Tesla delighted hisBritish hosts with humorous stories about life in America, including thefollowing: “I heard a noise, one morning, under the window of my room at theWestinghouse Works. I looked into the yard and found two boys quarreling. ‘Itold you.’ ‘You didn’t. You’re a liar.’ ‘I ain’t.’ ‘You’re a stinking littleliar, you know you never said it.’ ‘Yes, I did, you’ll find it in my BritishAssociation paper of last year!’ ”31 [029_BM029.xhtml#d622]Tesla’s lectures inspired one British engineer, J. A. Fleming, to photograph thesparks produced by an induction coil in order to determine whether the sparksdid indeed oscillate. Fleming invited Tesla to view the resulting photographsand congratulated him on his lectures. Calling the performances “a grandsuccess,” Fleming told Tesla “that no [one] can doubt your qualifications as amagician of the first order, viz the ‘Order of the flaming sword.’ ”32[029_BM029.xhtml#d623] (We will meet Fleming again in 1901 when he designed thetransmitter that Marconi used for his transatlantic tests.)During his stay in London, Tesla also spent time with Crookes. They conductedexperiments together, and Tesla wound a coil for him. They discussed the futureof electricity as well as Crookes’s interest in the occult and psychicalphenomena. Having read widely in “Spiritualism, Demonology, Witchcraft, AnimalMagnetism, Spiritual Theology, Magic, and Medical Psychology,” Crookes hadinvestigated séances and had come to believe there was some basis for the claimsmade by mediums of being able to contact the dead. Up to this time Tesla hadgiven little thought to such matters, but he was deeply impressed that a man ofscience such as Crookes took spiritualism so seriously.33 [029_BM029.xhtml#d624]BREAKDOWN ON THE CONTINENTFrom London, Tesla traveled on to Paris and booked a room in the Hotel de laPaix. On 19 February he gave a lecture before the Société de Physique and theSociété International des Electriciens (Figure 8.3[017_Chapter017.xhtml#fig8_3]).34 [029_BM029.xhtml#d625] Finding hisdemonstrations highly persuasive, the French electrician Édouard Hospitalierobserved, “The young scientist is … almost as a prophet. He introduces so muchwarmth and sincerity into his explanations and experiments that faith wins us,and despite ourselves, we believe that we are witnesses of the dawn of a nearbyrevolution in the present processes of illumination.” Just as in London, Tesla’sperformance generated a great deal of excitement and praise. “The French papersthis week are full of Mr. Tesla and his brilliant experiments,” reported theElectrical Review. “No man in our age has achieved such a universal scientificreputation in a single stride as this gifted young electrical engineer.”35[029_BM029.xhtml#d625a]image [Images/PG_169.jpg]FIGURE 8.3. “Paris—Mr. Tesla Lecturing before the French Physical Society andthe International Society of Electricians.”From “Mr. Tesla’s Experiments of Alternating Currents of Great Frequency,”Scientific American, 26 March 1892, p. 195.During his stay in Paris, Tesla encountered several dignitaries, including thephysicist André Blondel and Prince Albert of Belgium, who was interested inimproving the electrical power systems in his country. Intent on generating someincome from his foreign patents, Tesla met with representatives of Schneider &Co. of Creusot, France, and the Helios Company of Cologne, Germany, and licensedthese companies to manufacture his motors in France and Germany.36[029_BM029.xhtml#d625b]Tesla found all these activities—giving lectures, meeting important people,negotiating with businessmen—exciting yet stressful. While he was still inLondon, Crookes noticed that Tesla was nearing exhaustion; worried, he wroteTesla in Paris that “I hope you will get away to the mountains of your nativeland as soon as you can. You are suffering from over work, and if you do nottake care of yourself you will break down. Don’t answer this letter or see anyone but take the first train.”37 [029_BM029.xhtml#d626]But Crookes’s letter probably arrived too late, and Tesla was overtaken byexhaustion and depression. As often happened with his depressive bouts, Teslaretired to his hotel room to sleep. When he awoke, he was greeted by terriblenews about his mother, Djuka; as Tesla remembered, he was “just coming to fromone of my peculiar sleeping spells, which had been caused by prolonged exertionof the brain. Imagine the pain and distress I felt when it flashed upon my mindthat a dispatch was handed to me at that very moment bearing the sad news thatmy mother was dying.”38 [029_BM029.xhtml#d627]Tesla rushed from Paris to his family home in Gospić without stopping. His fearthat he would not arrive in time to see Djuka alive caused a patch of hair onthe right side of his head to turn white overnight. (Within a month it wasrestored to its original jet-black color.) When Tesla arrived at his mother’sside, she murmured to her only son, “You’ve arrived, Nidzo, my dear.”39[029_BM029.xhtml#d628]Over the next several weeks Tesla stood vigil by his mother’s bedside, only tosuffer a breakdown. As he recalled:I had become completely exhausted by pain and long vigilance, and one night wascarried to a building about two blocks from our home. As I lay helpless there, Ithought that if my mother died while I was away from her bedside she wouldsurely give me a sign.… [F]or my mother was a woman of genius and particularlyexcelling in the powers of intuition. During the whole night every fiber in mybrain was strained in expectancy, but nothing happened until early in themorning, when I fell in a sleep, or perhaps a swoon, and saw a cloud carryingangelic figures of marvelous beauty, one of whom gazed upon me lovingly andgradually assumed the features of my mother. The appearance slowly floatedacross the room and vanished, and I was awakened by an indescribably sweet songof many voices. In that instant a certitude, which no words can express, cameupon me that my mother had just died.40 [029_BM029.xhtml#d629] Deeply disturbed by this clairvoyant dream, Tesla immediately wrote Crookesabout it, as it seemed to confirm Crookes’s ideas about spiritualism. Teslapuzzled over this dream for years and eventually concluded that the music he hadheard was based on hearing a nearby church celebrating Easter mass on themorning his mother died. The angels were inspired by a painting by ArnoldBocklin depicting one of the seasons and showing a group of allegorical figureson a cloud; Tesla had seen this painting during a visit to Munich and it hadmade a deep impression on him as the figures seemed to be floating in the air.Thus he was able to explain “everything satisfactorily in conformity withscientific facts.”41 [029_BM029.xhtml#d630]Djuka was buried on Easter Sunday, beside her husband, in the Jasikovac cemeteryin Divoselo. As a sign of the deep involvement of the Tesla and Mandic familiesin the Serbian Orthodox Church, six priests officiated at the funeral. Teslaarranged for white obelisk headstones over the graves of his mother andfather.42 [029_BM029.xhtml#d631]Tesla remained in Gospić for the next six weeks, grieving with his family. “Idon’t have to tell you that I am very sad and holding myself with restraint,” hewrote Uncle Pajo in April 1892. “I was afraid of this event a while ago, but,the blow was heavy.”43 [029_BM029.xhtml#d632]As Tesla regained his strength, he journeyed across Croatia to Plaski to visithis sister Marica, to Varazdin to see Uncle Pajo, and to Zagreb where helectured at the university. From Zagreb, Tesla traveled to Budapest to meet withrepresentatives of the electrical manufacturing firm Ganz and Company.44[029_BM029.xhtml#d633] Along with learning about the firm’s current efforts tobuild a 1,000-horsepower alternator, Tesla negotiated a license so that Ganzcould manufacture his motors. Overall Tesla was quite pleased with how hispatent negotiations went, and he reported to Westinghouse that “The patents arein the hands of three of the most powerful companies who will cooperate and theyare earnest in their intention to push the manufacture. The introduction of themotor in Europe on an extensive scale will, no doubt, have a very favorableinfluence upon the value of my American patents which are owned by yourCompany.”45 [029_BM029.xhtml#d634]In May, Tesla went to Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, where he received ahero’s welcome. King Alexander I conferred on him the title of Grand Officer ofthe Order of St. Sava. The Serbian poet Jovan Jovanović Zmaj composed a poem,“Pozdrav Nikoli Tesli,” which he read at a ceremony honoring Tesla. In responseto these honors from his fellow Serbs, Tesla thanked the audience, expressingboth his ambition and his national pride: “[I]f I were to be sufficientlyfortunate to bring about at least some of my ideas it would be for the benefitof all humanity. If these hopes become one day a reality, my greatest joy wouldspring from the fact that this work would be the work of a Serb.”46[029_BM029.xhtml#d635]In returning to America from Serbia, Tesla traveled through Germany, stopping tosee the physicist Hermann von Helmholtz in Berlin and then on to Bonn to conferwith Hertz.47 [029_BM029.xhtml#d636] Tesla had repeated Hertz’s originalexperiments using his oscillating transformer, and while he felt that Hertz hadbeen correct in showing that electromagnetic waves were being propagated inspace, Tesla disagreed with Hertz about the form of the waves. In hisexperiments, Hertz had found the waves were transverse, meaning that thedisturbances are at right angles to the direction of propagation. (A familiarexample of transverse waves is the waves in the ocean.) To demonstrate this,Hertz had set up tests that showed that the waves could be reflected andinterfere with each other, thus revealing that electromagnetic waves were likelight. In replicating Hertz’s experiments, Tesla concluded that the waves heobserved were not transverse but longitudinal, in that the displacement isparallel to the direction of propagation. (A simple example of a longitudinalwave would be how a train moves backward—as the locomotive reverses, each carbumps the next so that a pulse moves through the string of cars.) For Tesla,electromagnetic waves were more like sound waves than light waves. If the newwaves were not transverse like light waves, then this meant that Hertz had notprovided the experimental proof for Maxwell’s theory. Needless to say, Tesla’sclaims would have been very troubling to Hertz, and as Tesla recalled, “Heseemed disappointed to such a degree that I regretted my trip and parted fromhim sorrowfully.” It is perhaps not surprising that there is no mention inHertz’s diary of meeting with Tesla.48 [029_BM029.xhtml#d637]Though the death of his mother made the latter portion of his trip to Europe “amost painful ordeal,” Tesla returned from Europe with a major insight. As wehave seen, he had left London challenged by Lord Rayleigh’s praise to focus hisefforts on one big idea, and this idea came to him while walking in themountains of his homeland. During this hike, a thunderstorm came up suddenly,but Tesla was able to find shelter before rain began. As he described in hisautobiography:[S]omehow the rain was delayed until all of a sudden, there was a lightningflash and a few moments after a deluge. This observation set me thinking. It wasmanifest that the two phenomena were closely related, as cause and effect, and alittle reflection led me to the conclusion that the electrical energy involvedin the precipitation was inconsiderable, the function of the lightning beingmuch like that of a sensitive trigger. Here was a stupendous possibility ofachievement. If we could produce electric effects of the required quality, thiswhole planet and the conditions of existence on it could be transformed.… Theconsummation [of this idea] depended on our ability to develop electric forcesof the order of those in nature. It seemed a hopeless undertaking, but I made upmy mind to try it and immediately on my return to the United States in thesummer of 1892, work was begun which was to me all the more attractive, becausea means of the same kind was necessary for the successful transmission of energywithout wires.Watching how the lightning seemed to cause the rain to start, Tesla wasfascinated by the notion of a “sensitive trigger”: that a small force, properlyapplied, could be used to harness tremendous forces in the earth. Recalling hisexperiments with grounding his oscillating transformer from the previous fall,Tesla now realized that if he could scale up his transformer, he might very wellhave the trigger needed to harness the Earth and “provide motive power inunlimited amounts.”49 [029_BM029.xhtml#d638] To Tesla, here was a challengeworthy of his talent and genius."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINEPUSHING ALTERNATING CURRENT IN AMERICA(1892–1893)Tesla sailed from Hamburg on the Augusta Victoria and arrived back in New Yorkon 27 August 1892.1 [029_BM029.xhtml#d639] Upon his return, he changed both hislaboratory and residence. He enlarged his laboratory by relocating from GrandStreet to 33–35 South Fifth Avenue (today LaGuardia Place) where he occupied thefourth floor in a nondescript factory building. Located just south of WashingtonSquare, his new laboratory was “in the heart of that picturesque neighborhoodknown as the French Quarter, teeming with cheap restaurants, wine shops, andweather-beaten tenements.” In late September, Tesla switched from the AstorHouse to the Gerlach Hotel on 27th Street, between Broadway and Sixth Avenue.Built in 1888 at a cost of $1 million, the Gerlach was an imposing eleven-storyfireproof building that featured elevators, electric lights, and severalsumptuous dining rooms.2 [029_BM029.xhtml#d640]With his return to New York, Tesla was keen to follow up on his new vision forhis high-frequency inventions, but he also felt the need to improve hispolyphase motors and do everything he could to convince Westinghouse to promotethem. Since Tesla had torn up his contract with Westinghouse, the company wasunder no obligation to work with him but Tesla was anxious to ensure that hispolyphase system was not ignored in the United States. Having talked with theengineers at Ganz and Company and other electrical firms in Europe, Tesla waswell aware that the Europeans were moving forward quickly with developingsystems for transmitting power using two- or three-phase current.When Tesla left Westinghouse in 1889, his former assistant, Charles Scott, wasgiven the task of continuing to develop marketable motors based on Tesla’spatents. However, before Scott and other engineers at Westinghouse could do so,the company went into receivership, and it took George Westinghouse the betterpart of 1890 and 1891 to secure new financing for the company (see Chapter 7[016_Chapter016.xhtml]).While they were waiting for the company’s financial situation to be resolved,Scott and his associates made several decisions about the frequency and phase offuture polyphase systems. Over the short term, they decided to build two-phasesystems using 60-cycle alternating current. By doing so, they would be able tocombine motor and lighting loads since they could split the two-phase currentinto two separate single-phase currents for lighting circuits and 60 cycleswould not produce a noticeable flicker in incandescent lamps. They planned tobuild three-phase, 30-cycle power systems later on that would be better suitedfor industrial applications. In particular, Scott found that it was possible toconnect two-phase generators with three-phase motors by using his special “T”transformer connection. As a result, it became possible to use three-phase,60-cycle AC to service both lighting and power loads in a single network.3[029_BM029.xhtml#d641]Such was the technical situation by the start of 1892 when, having finallystabilized the company, George Westinghouse was able to start thinking aboutwhat his company should do with AC. Although Westinghouse owned the Americanrights to Tesla’s patents for using polyphase AC, he was not, for most of 1892,particularly concerned with developing polyphase. Instead, he was much moreinterested in pursuing single-phase AC since there was a ready market forlighting systems using single-phase at 133 cycles.4 [029_BM029.xhtml#d642]The Westinghouse Company employed single-phase AC and Tesla’s split-phase motorsto make its first power transmission installation at the Telluride gold mine inColorado. Unable to secure power nearby, the mine owners had asked Westinghouseto install a turbine at a stream four miles away and erect a 3,000-volt AC powerline over the rugged terrain to a 100-horsepower motor at the mine. Reportingthat the Telluride system was delivering power with an efficiency of 83.5% atfull load, Scott proudly boasted that “work in this field is fast passing fromexperimental investigation into practical engineering.”5 But Telluride was onlyan isolated plant using single-phase AC to transmit power a few miles; comparedto the Lauffen-Frankfurt line and other work going on in Europe, Telluride wassmall potatoes.Instead of pursuing polyphase AC—which must have seemed promising butunproven—Westinghouse decided in the spring of 1892 to concentrate on promotingAC by going after the contract to provide electric lighting for the 1893 ChicagoWorld’s Fair. Westinghouse did so because he needed to do something dramatic toregain visibility as a major electrical manufacturer. Many people had assumedthat Westinghouse, having nearly gone under, would be a much smaller player inelectrical manufacturing. At the same time, Westinghouse now faced an evenlarger adversary since Edison General Electric and the Thomson-Houston ElectricCompany had merged in February 1892 to form General Electric (GE). In May 1892Westinghouse won the contract to provide electric lighting for the fair bysubstantially underbidding GE. Since the fair buildings were to be decoratedwith two hundred thousand incandescent lights, the fair was an ideal opportunityfor Westinghouse to demonstrate how AC could be used to power an entire city.6[029_BM029.xhtml#d643]But Westinghouse had made such a low bid that his engineers were forced todesign larger alternators and operate at higher voltages than previously used;as one history of the fair recounted,The Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co., having secured the contract tofurnish this immense service at a figure far below the cost, as such work hadalways been done, it became necessary to devise a system more economical and atthe same time more flexible. This was done. They devised and constructed in lessthan six months larger machines than had ever been built for this work before,and on radically different lines, embodying the principles of the alternatingsystem of transmission. By this system hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worthof copper wire were saved, as it was possible to send the current under highpressure [i.e., voltage] to its destination on small wires, and then transformit down to the point of utility.7 [029_BM029.xhtml#d644]Not only did Westinghouse have to worry about designing new equipment for thefair, he also had to come up with a new incandescent lamp. In October 1892,after a long legal battle, the courts upheld Edison’s original lamp patent andruled in favor of GE. In response, Westinghouse and his engineers designed a newstopper lamp that avoided the Edison patent. Though less efficient than theEdison lamp, this new design allowed Westinghouse to complete the installationat the Chicago World’s Fair.Consequently, when he arrived back in New York in late August 1892, Tesla foundthat Westinghouse was not giving much thought to promoting his motors orpolyphase system. Westinghouse was not opposed to polyphase, but it was not themost pressing technology to pursue at that moment. Concentrating on designingthe generating equipment and lamps needed to satisfy the lighting contract forthe fair, Westinghouse was not even thinking about an exhibit for the fair inwhich Tesla motors could be displayed.8 [029_BM029.xhtml#d645] Yet Tesla wasanxious to make sure that the best possible version of his motor was availablefor the fair. As Tesla told Westinghouse in mid-September:I intend myself to go to Pittsburgh this evening if I can manage to find time. Imust consult with Mr. Schmid [the general superintendent] about the speedycarrying out of some improvements on my … motors. It is necessary to bring themotor to high perfection before the exhibition as this is of prime importance.…Please [ask] your staff to aid me in all they can. My conviction is that a motorwithout brushes and commutator is the only form which is capable of permanentsuccess. To introduce other forms I consider a … waste of time and money.9[029_BM029.xhtml#d646]Knowing that the Telluride installation used only single-phase, Tesla wasconcerned with improving on his polyphase designs since he asked a few weekslater to borrow several transformers as well as an alternator that producedeither a two-or three-phase current.10 [029_BM029.xhtml#d647] Tesla probablyinvestigated how to patent around the Y-connection used by Dolivo-Dobrowolsky inthe generators and motors at Frankfurt. At the same time, Tesla also studied thetrade-offs between using two- or three-phase current. Although he had emphasizedthree-phase current in his patents, he had heard enough in discussions withEuropean engineers to realize that two-phase might be better in some situationsfor transmitting power.As he fretted over his polyphase motor and his relationship with Westinghouse,Tesla was approached by Henry Villard, a German financier who had helped funnelGerman capital into American railroads in the 1880s. He had been the drivingforce behind the consolidation of various Edison companies into Edison GeneralElectric in 1889. But in the negotiations leading to the formation of GE in1892, Villard was outmaneuvered by Charles Coffin of Thomson-Houston, and Coffinbecame president of GE.11 [029_BM029.xhtml#d648] Rebuffed but undaunted, Villardwas still determined to play a role in the electrical industry. In the fall of1892, Villard approached Tesla with some sort of scheme. Although thecorrespondence does not tell us, Villard’s scheme could have involved electricstreet railways, the promotion of Tesla’s polyphase system, or even aconsolidation of other electrical firms built around the WestinghouseCompany—all were ideas that Villard had considered over the previous few years.Whatever the scheme, it intrigued Tesla but it meant convincing Westinghouse tocome onboard. Tesla, however, was unable to persuade Westinghouse; as heexplained to Villard in October 1892:I have approached Mr. Westinghouse in a number of ways and endeavoured to get toan understanding with him in the sense of our last conversation. The results sofar have not been very promising and have impressed me that to follow up on thismatter would require more time than I am able to spare at present.Realizing this, and also considering carefully the chances and probabilities ofsuccess, I have concluded that I cannot associate myself with the undertakingyou contemplate. For the time being I am working on an invention which, if onlyin a measure successful would radically transform the present system of electriclighting, and the subject demands the concentration of all my energies.12[029_BM029.xhtml#d649]THE RACE FOR THE NIAGARA CONTRACTWestinghouse was indifferent to Villard’s scheme because as the fall of 1892progressed, he could see even greater opportunities taking shape. Along withlighting the upcoming World’s Fair in Chicago, Westinghouse decided to makeanother big move: to pursue the contract for the power equipment that would beused to harness Niagara Falls. As we shall see, the successful development ofpower at Niagara proved to be the turning point for Tesla’s polyphaseinventions.Thanks to geography and population, Niagara Falls was an ideal place to pursuethe development of power transmission. Connecting Lake Erie with Lake Ontario,the Niagara River carries the full flow from the upper Great Lakes as the watermakes it journey to the Atlantic Ocean via the St. Lawrence River. The fallsoccur where the bedrock beneath the river suddenly changes from hard to soft,and the river drops dramatically 160 feet. But rather than being isolated in thewilderness, Niagara Falls was located near much of the industrial population ofthe United States and Canada. In 1890, about one-fifth of all Americans livedwithin four hundred miles of Niagara Falls, and Buffalo, a city of 250,000, wastwenty miles to the south.13 [029_BM029.xhtml#d650] To the north, across theNiagara River, lay much of the population and industry of Canada in the provinceof Ontario.But while Niagara Falls held the promise of generating vast amounts of power,the scenic beauty of the cataract posed a challenge to those wishing to harnessthat power. In 1885, local industrialists on the American side dug a canal toprovide waterpower to several factories at the foot of the falls. Concerned,however, that such industrial development would spoil the beauty of the falls,the state of New York declared the remaining land near the falls to be a specialnature reservation. The effect of the reservation was to remove permanently fromuse the land that would have been ideal for a major industrial district. Unableto build factories right at the falls, industrialists now had to get around thereservation.In response, a civil engineer, Thomas Evershed, unveiled a plan in 1886 usingcanals, shafts, and a tunnel to divert water around the reservation. A broadcanal located a mile above the falls would bring water to a series of branchcanals that would power 238 separate waterwheels. After passing through awaterwheel, the water would then plunge down a 150-foot shaft to a 2.5-mile-longtailrace tunnel. Sloping under the town of Niagara Falls, this tunnel wouldcarry the water to the lower portion of the river.Although the tunnel would have to be cut through solid limestone, Evershed’sscheme captured the imagination of both local investors and William BirchRankine, a prominent New York City attorney. As a young man Rankine had clerkedfor a lawyer in Niagara Falls and became fascinated with the possibility ofharnessing the cataract.14 [029_BM029.xhtml#d651] Recognizing that Evershed’splan would cost millions, Rankine brought the idea to J. P. Morgan. AlthoughMorgan was willing to invest in the scheme, he told Rankine that the projectwould need a strong leader to serve as its promoter. Since the project wouldinvolve both finance and engineering, Morgan suggested a fellow Wall Streetbanker, Edward Dean Adams (1846–1931). “If you can get him,” Morgan toldRankine, “I’ll join you.”15 [029_BM029.xhtml#d652]A Boston Brahmin and an indirect descendant of two presidents, Adams had studiedengineering at Norwich University and MIT. He came to Wall Street in 1878,joining the investment house of Winslow, Lanier & Company. As one of his firstprojects, Adams helped organize the Northern Pacific Terminal Company and theSt. Paul & Northern Pacific Railway Company, and through this work he metVillard. Villard was the American representative of the Deutsche Bank, and whenVillard stepped down from this post in 1893 he was replaced by Adams; over thenext several decades, Adams was responsible for directing millions of Germanmarks into American railroads and industrial enterprises. Adams further made aname for himself by streamlining the finances of railroads and manufacturingcompanies. Impressed with his ability, Morgan frequently asked Adams toparticipate in industrial reorganizations. In 1896, Adams particularly endearedhimself to Morgan by getting the Deutsche Bank to underwrite a quarter of the$100 million that Morgan loaned to the U.S. Treasury in order to save the dollarfrom collapsing. His biographer summed up Adams’s character in the followingmanner: “In a cynical and materialistic age it is refreshing to find a businessman of this type—analytical, indefatigable and industrious, yet with all thegrace and refined culture of the aristocracies of old.”16 [029_BM029.xhtml#d653]Long interested in the commercial potential of electricity, Adams had been astockholder in the Edison Electric Light Company since 1878. Enthusiastic aboutthe possibilities for Niagara, Adams organized a syndicate of Wall Streetcapitalists who put up $2.63 million. Adams then formed the CataractConstruction Company to develop the power potential of the falls.17[029_BM029.xhtml#d654]As president of the Cataract Company, Adams made a key decision early on. Ratherthan utilize the power generated in new factories in the small town of NiagaraFalls, Adams thought the real opportunity lay in transmitting power to factoriesin Buffalo and other cities. At that time, Buffalo factories were using steamengines to generate 50,000 horsepower daily, so there was clearly a ready demandfor power in that city. Moreover, by utilizing the power away from NiagaraFalls, Adams would avoid the expense of the branch canals and numerous verticalshafts needed to connect the individual waterwheels with the tailrace tunnel. Asexciting as this idea was, it meant that Cataract would need to find a way totransmit large amounts of power over the twenty miles between Niagara andBuffalo.To determine the most efficient way to transmit power to Buffalo, Adamsconsulted first with Edison, who, not surprisingly, suggested using directcurrent. Adams turned next to Westinghouse. Because of the low price of coal inBuffalo, Westinghouse was dubious that electric power could compete with steampower in that city. Also aware that factory owners might balk at the cost ofreplacing their existing steam engines with electric motors, Westinghouserecommended transmitting power via a compressed-air pipeline. Westinghouse wasknowledgeable about compressed air since he used it in his railway air brakes,and he suggested to Adams that compressed air could power existing steamengines. In general, Westinghouse was concerned that Adams was underestimatingthe problems of finding enough customers for all the power generated by thefalls.18 [029_BM029.xhtml#d655]Faced with a medley of opinions about power transmission, Adams consulted withengineers in England, Germany, and Switzerland. In June 1890, Adams broughttogether the leading experts and established the International NiagaraCommission. The commission announced a contest to determine the best method forgenerating and transmitting power at Niagara and invited twenty-eight Europeanand American engineering firms to submit proposals. The commission offered$20,000 in prizes, with the top award being $3,000. Upon hearing of thecompetition, a Westinghouse engineer, Lewis B. Stillwell, was keen to enter andapproached his boss. Annoyed that the commission was fishing for majorinformation but offering such paltry rewards, Westinghouse refused toparticipate. “These people are trying to secure $100,000 worth of information byoffering prizes, the largest of which is $3000,” he growled. “When they areready to do business, we will show them how to do it.”19 [029_BM029.xhtml#d656]Westinghouse was right to be suspicious because although the commission receivedfourteen proposals, it deemed none satisfactory and awarded no first prize.Instead the commission mined the proposals for technical information andforwarded a series of recommendations to Adams. Using the tunnel that Cataracthad started digging in October 1890, the commission recommended that the companyplace several 5,000-horsepower turbines in the tunnel and connect them via150-foot-long shafts to power generators located at the surface in a centralpower house. The commission could not decide between compressed air orelectricity for transmission, but Adams chose to go with electricity because ofthe efficiencies demonstrated on the Lauffen-Frankfurt line. Determined to moveahead, in December 1891 Adams invited six electrical companies—Westinghouse,Thomson-Houston, Edison GE, and three Swiss firms—to provide estimates on theelectrical equipment needed at Niagara.In response to Cataract’s call for bids, the newly formed General Electricoffered a plan in the fall of 1892 that would provide DC for local industry inNiagara and AC transmission to Buffalo. Meanwhile, the Swiss firms—whichspecialized in designing hydroelectric plants—offered other schemes. Cataractrejected the Swiss proposals since American tariffs of 40% on imported machinerymade their plans prohibitively expensive. In addition, as Tesla pointed out toWestinghouse, the foreign firms could not bring polyphase equipment into theUnited States without infringing on his patents.20 [029_BM029.xhtml#d657]Having resisted getting drawn into the Niagara race for two years, Westinghousenow plunged into the fray. In December 1892, with Adams’s call for bids havingcome and gone, Westinghouse boldly announced that his company was ready toprovide polyphase equipment for Niagara. What gave Westinghouse confidence weredevelopments coming out of his engineering department. Continuing the work begunby Charles Scott to improve Tesla’s polyphase motors, Benjamin G. Lamme had comeup with new arrangements for the coils in the stator so that Tesla’s designs nowworked as well as Dolivo-Dobrolowsky’s drehstrom motors. In addition, tests ofthese new motors suggested a more efficient way of winding the rotor, leading towhat came to be the standard rotor design: the squirrel cage. And Lamme designeda new rotary converter; consisting of an electric motor and generator on asingle shaft, this machine could convert polyphase AC into either single-phaseAC or DC. Using a rotary converter, a power company could now use polyphase ACto transmit power over long distances and then convert the power so thatcustomers could use it with their existing single-phase AC or DC equipment.Westinghouse was quick to see that the rotary converter meant power companieswould be able to find customers for all the power that they could generate andtransmit.21 [029_BM029.xhtml#d658]These engineering developments meant that, for the first time, Westinghousecould make full use of Tesla’s AC polyphase motor, and the company beganemphasizing its ownership of the Tesla patents. In January 1893 the WestinghouseCompany issued a pamphlet that included the twenty-nine Tesla patents it owned.In part, the pamphlet highlighted the opportunity to use polyphase AC totransmit power from waterfalls to cities, but at the same time Westinghousewarned customers not to buy polyphase equipment from other manufacturers sincethey could be sued by Westinghouse for infringement.22 [029_BM029.xhtml#d659]Armed with these engineering developments and the Tesla patents, Westinghousenow energetically pursued the Niagara contract. In January 1893, Adams and hisassociates from Cataract visited the Westinghouse plant in Pittsburgh where theywere shown the latest equipment and preliminary plans. The following month,Adams made a similar tour of GE’s factories.SELLING ADAMS ON POLYPHASEBut Tesla was not satisfied to leave the choice of transmission system to benegotiated between Westinghouse and Adams. Recalling his childhood dream ofharnessing Niagara, Tesla was determined that his polyphase system should beused to transmit power. As he explained in 1917, “When I heard that suchauthorities as Lord Kelvin and Prof. W. C. Unwin had recommended—one thedirect-current system and the other the compressed air—for the transmission ofpower from Niagara Falls to Buffalo, I thought it dangerous to let the matter gofurther, and I went to see Mr. Adams.”23 [029_BM029.xhtml#d660] Tesla met withAdams and corresponded with him during the first few months of 1893.After meeting with Adams, Tesla reviewed plans for the powerhouse and suggestedthat Cataract should not run the turbines and generators at 150 rpm (assuggested by Unwin) but at 250 rpm (as recommended by Schmid at Westinghouse).Tesla argued against the lower speed since it would spoil the splendid view ofthe dynamos inside the powerhouse: “If you would reduce the speed it wouldnecessitate … that the diameter of the Dynamo be made considerably larger, whichwould leave still a smaller space between the wall and the machine, and this Ithink, with such magnificent machinery which will be viewed by Monarchs, wouldbe decidedly bad.”24 [029_BM029.xhtml#d661]Even though Adams was a close observer of the electrical industry, he quizzedTesla on developments in the field. For instance, Adams was puzzled by whyEuropean electrical firms had suddenly switched from pushing polyphase topromoting single-phase AC. Had not Oerlikon and AllgemeineElektricitats-Gesellschaft used polyphase at Frankfurt? For Tesla, the answerwas that his patents were now being used by the Helios Company in Germany to sueinfringers. “I have not the slightest doubt,” Tesla wrote Adams in February1893, “that all companies except Helios, who have acquired rights from myCompany, will have to stop the manufacture of [poly] phase motors. Proceedingsagainst infringers have been taken in the most energetic way by the Helios Co.It is for this reason that our enemies are driven to the single phase system andrapid changes of opinion.”25 [029_BM029.xhtml#d662]Finding Tesla’s responses useful, Adams asked him to review various articles onAC from electrical engineering journals. Tesla dismissed the plans proposed byothers as inefficient or impractical but regularly emphasized the virtues of hismotor. As he explained to Adams:[I]t is much easier to run [my] machine which has no commutator or brushes …than a direct current machine.… Not to speak of the advantages of the idealsimplicity of these machines affords ov[er] the long run.Under frequent conditions in practice it would be entirely impossible for anysystem to compete [with] this ideally simple one.… This is the third form of mymotor. This form has never been criticized by the adversaries of my system andfor a good reason, because it is the most efficient form of electric machinethat has been produced to this day. I have shown that in such machines underfavorable conditions an efficiency of 97% can be obtained.26[029_BM029.xhtml#d663]While Tesla saw his letters to Adams as an opportunity to advance his polyphasesystem, Adams viewed the correspondence as a way of getting inside information.By March 1893, Adams was growing especially concerned about the patentsituation. Although the Westinghouse Company was claiming that the Tesla patentsgave it exclusive control over polyphase AC, the situation was not necessarilythat clear. GE had been developing its own polyphase technology, drawing onElihu Thomson’s research and by purchasing AC patents from several inventorsincluding Charles S. Bradley. The ambiguity of the patent situation alarmed thechief patent attorney for Cataract, Frederick H. Betts, and he warned Adams inMarch 1893 that if he used the Tesla patents, Adams might find himself embroiledin patent litigation with GE.27 [029_BM029.xhtml#d664]To gain some perspective on the patent situation, Adams turned to Tesla. The dayafter Betts had warned Adams, Tesla provided Adams with his evaluation of theThomson and Bradley patents held by GE:The patent of Thomson … has absolutely nothing to do with my discovery of therotating magnetic field and the radically novel features of my system oftransmission of power disclosed in my foundation patents of 1888.…As to the Bradley patents … I would think it fair to all concerned that athorough examination be made to their history and bearing. Such [an]examination, which has been made by myself without the slightest prejudice, willconvince you that in the earliest patent there is not the least hint of a methodof transmission of power which would be novel.28 [029_BM029.xhtml#d665]While Adams was probably suspicious of Tesla’s claims to have reviewed Bradley’spatents “without the slightest prejudice,” the letter signaled to Adams thatTesla and Westinghouse believed that they had a strong legal position and thatthey would actively defend their patents.Adams was also wondering why Westinghouse was advocating a two-phase system andGE a three-phase system in plans submitted by each company in March 1893. In atwo-phase system, the generators produce two currents that are 90° out of phase,while in a three-phase system the generators produce three currents that are 60°out of phase. In either system, these currents would be transmitted overseparate circuits and then combined to run a motor at the point of use. Inresponse to Adams’s query, Tesla recommended two-phase. In his patents andpublications, Tesla had previously emphasized three-phase, largely because hehad found that three currents had produced a more uniform rotating magneticfield in his motors than two currents did. Because of his patents, Tesla had apersonal interest in advocating three-phase. Now, however, he told Adams thatthere were practical advantages to using two-phase. As Tesla pointed out, a keyadvantage for two-phase was that Westinghouse had found that each of the twocurrents could be separated and used to power single-phase incandescent lights.For Cataract, this meant that there would be yet another way of selling theenormous output of the new Niagara plant, and as a result, the company decidedultimately to go with two-phase current for local distribution and three-phasefor long-distance transmission.29 [029_BM029.xhtml#d666]But as he pumped Tesla for information about matters such as two-versusthree-phase systems, Adams was keeping his options open. As the official historyof the Niagara project noted, “[T]he type of current to be generated was leftuntil the last moment in order to have the guidance of the latest foreign andhome experience.” Much to Tesla’s dismay, Adams was still considering thepossibility of using DC since at 10,000–20,000 volts it is possible to transmitpower efficiently over a distance. Such a plan, which Adams sent to Tesla, wasbeing put forward by a “prominent advocate.” Adams may well have been swayed totake such a DC plan seriously since commission member Lord Kelvin was continuingto push for DC and Kelvin cabled Adams in May 1893, “Trust you avoid giganticmistake of adoption alternating current.”30 [029_BM029.xhtml#d667]For Tesla, it would be an even bigger mistake if Cataract adopted DC. Topersuade Adams of this, Tesla first argued that the generation and transmissionof electric power were fundamentally alternating:I hope that you are not seriously considering the statement of the “prominentadvocate.” To gain an idea of the infinite inexperience of the man and theabsurdity of his view you need only to realise that all power transmissions arealternating. The process in the direct system is this. We generate in themachine alternate currents—(this is true for any machine in use)—which wereclaim by means of the commutator and brushes. The direct currents which goover the line can not drive a motor, they must be again made alternating by thecommutator and brushes in the motor. Now what my system has offered was to doaway with the commutator and brushes both in the generator and motor, otherwisethe action is the same. This renders the system simpler, cheaper and moreefficient in general. But these are only incidental advantages. The chief gainconsists in these features: absolutely constant speed, facility of insulatingfor high voltage, easy conversion to any voltage, and facility of [unclear word]to the wires on all points along the route where energy is needed. Thesefeatures are practically unattainable in the direct system, especially whentransmissions at a great distance are contemplated. In fact I think that such ascheme if ever carried out could not help being a commercial and perhaps also atechnical failure. Of course with a sufficient outlay of capital any scheme,however absurd, can be carried out but the question here is to achieve apractical commercial success and the best and safest appliances should beemployed by all means.Next, drawing on his own practical experience, Tesla argued that a high-voltageDC system would encounter serious problems: it would require a great deal ofadditional insulation, it would be difficult to avoid current variations, andextra equipment (probably motor-generator sets) would be needed to adapt thecurrent to different lighting and power applications:I suppose very few engineers have wound direct current machines for 10,000volts. My experience with such machines which I constructed for certainexperimental purposes was that they invariably break down. The reason is thatowing to the presence of the commutator it is very difficult to insulate. It hasbeen found impracticable to operate successfully arc light machines (directbeyond 4000 volts and with 20,000 volts the difficulties are—figurativelyspeaking—25 times as great). When a very thick insulation is employed, themachine looses [sic] efficiency, and what is the worst, it becomes poorlyregulating and unfit for the purpose. The power you would furnish with suchmachines would be unavailable for many uses, for instance, electric lighting.There might be—and very likely would be—variations of 20%, and you can notafford 2–3%, for this would give you an unsatisfactory light and produceconsiderable variations in smaller machines. Suppose all difficulties of suchNature [were] overcome, one would still be very far from commercial success. Youwould not be able to carry out your plan of making connections along theroute,—at least it would be very difficult—and in such case you would have touse two machines in every place, for you could not expect to have two windingsin one machine, it would be impracticable and dangerous. The cost of maintenancewould be an important item. I think it fair to estimate that you could notpossibly operate such a system with adequate safety with double the outlay ofcapital—not to speak of some of the mentioned insuperable difficulties. Let the“prominent advocate” carry out such a system and he will receive the pay hedeserves.In closing, Tesla played to Adams’s dream of transmitting Niagara power not onlyto Buffalo but throughout New York State, even to New York City; Tesla remindedhim that he was aware of Adams’s “intended plans for the utilization of theenergy at much greater distance than Buffalo—and [it is] only that case I havebeen considering. With the alternate system you will have absolute,unquestionable success.”31 [029_BM029.xhtml#d668]In May 1893, Adams and the Cataract Company announced their decisions aboutwhich technology to use at Niagara. Swayed by Tesla’s arguments, Adams declaredthat Niagara would use two-phase AC.32 [029_BM029.xhtml#d669] And although hehad concluded that Westinghouse was better prepared to build the large-scaleequipment needed, Adams once again rejected both of the plans submitted by GEand Westinghouse. In part, this rejection was probably caused by the fact thatblueprints for Westinghouse designs had been discovered in GE’s engineeringoffices; with accusations of industrial espionage flying, Adams may have wantedto steer clear of both companies. But another reason for rejecting the plans wasthat another member of the Niagara Commission, Professor George Forbes, had beenformulating his own design for the generators, and he was agitating for Cataractto follow his plan.Still determined to land the Niagara contract, the Westinghouse Company pulledout all the stops at the Chicago World’s Fair during the summer of 1893 anddemonstrated a fully integrated AC system. At the fair, Tesla had his ownpersonal display that highlighted the magic and potential of AC by showing hisearly motors, egg of Columbus apparatus, oscillating transformer, and an arrayof his new lamps.33 [029_BM029.xhtml#d670] Tesla’s personal exhibit, though,helped draw visitors’ attention to all of the Westinghouse equipment being usedto power the fair. To supply power for all of the incandescent lighting at thefair, Westinghouse installed twenty-four 500-horsepower single-phase, 60-cyclegenerators. These generators were installed in pairs on single shafts so as toprovide two-phase AC for the Tesla motor circuits. To provide power for theirelectric railway, Westinghouse engineers used a rotary converter to change theAC into 500-volt DC. Transformers were also used in the network to step thevoltage up or down, as needed for different applications using Tesla motors. Thefirst installation to use alternating current to service both electric lightingand power applications, the Westinghouse display at the World’s Fair convincedelectrical engineers from both America and Europe that AC was here to stay.34[029_BM029.xhtml#d671]At the same time, Tesla continued his campaign with Adams on behalf of polyphaseAC; the result was that Adams awarded Westinghouse the contract for building thegenerators in October 1893. Once Forbes’s plans arrived at Westinghouse, theywere substantially revised by Lamme. To ensure that he could draw on both majorelectrical manufacturers in the future, Adams awarded another contract to GE forbuilding the twenty-mile transmission line from Niagara to Buffalo to GE. Eventhough they had to share the Niagara business with GE, it was not lost onWestinghouse executives that Tesla had helped them secure the business; as oneWestinghouse manager congratulated Tesla in November 1893, “It must certainly begratifying to you to think the largest water power in the world is to beutilized by a system which your ingenuity originated. Your successes aregradually pushing to the front.… Let the good work go on.”35[029_BM029.xhtml#d672]From 1893 to 1896, Adams and Rankine were deeply absorbed in supervising theconstruction of a powerhouse that would ultimately hold ten Westinghousegenerators, each rated at 5,000 horsepower. To design the building for thepowerhouse as well as several dozen houses for employees, Adams hired theprominent architect Stanford White. Since the new powerhouse would deliver fourtimes the amount of electricity than any previous power station, Adams andRankine began looking ahead to using polyphase current to distribute power overa wider region, first to other cities besides Buffalo in New York State, andthen even further afield. As Rankine proclaimed: “If it be practicable totransmit power at a commercial profit in these moderate quantities to Albany,the courage of the practical man will not halt there, but inclined to followingthe daring promise of Nikola Tesla, would be disposed to place 100,000horsepower on a wire and send it 450 miles to New York in one direction, and 500miles in the other to Chicago—and supply the wants of these greatcommunities.”36 [029_BM029.xhtml#d673] As we will see, Adams and Rankine weresufficiently impressed with Tesla’s technical prowess that they helped him setup a company for the promotion of his wireless-power inventions in 1895 (seeChapter 11 [020_Chapter020.xhtml]).The Niagara powerhouse began transmitting power to Buffalo in November 1896, andover the next decade Niagara power was running machines across New York State.Excited by the possibilities revealed by the Cataract Company, Rankine launcheda second company to build a similar power plant on the Canadian side of thefalls. As a result of the success of the Niagara Falls power plant, American andEuropean utilities shifted to polyphase AC; it now forms the standard currentdistributed in most parts of the world today.37 [029_BM029.xhtml#d674]Fascinated by the idea that the natural sublime of Niagara Falls had beensupplanted by the technological wonder of AC, American newspapers waxedeloquently about Niagara power and Tesla.38 [029_BM029.xhtml#d675] Quiteunderstandably people came to think that Tesla, working with the WestinghouseCompany, had designed this new system. Though Tesla did not design the systemused at Niagara, he nonetheless played a profound, but subtle, role inharnessing the falls. Having articulated the ideal of using polyphase AC totransmit significant amounts of power, Tesla took up the task of shaping thethinking of the key decision maker, Edward Dean Adams. Through his letters andmeetings with Adams, Tesla not only provided technical data but mobilized thebeliefs and values necessary for Adams to favor AC. Through his correspondenceand conversations with Adams, Tesla played a decisive role in getting AC used atNiagara and hence the world.Though the journalists did not necessarily know how hard Tesla had worked behindthe scenes to convince Adams to use polyphase AC, they did recognize that he hadintroduced into electrical engineering practice the fundamental idea of usingpolyphase AC to send large amounts of power over distances. Regarding theharnessing of Niagara as “the unrivalled engineering triumph of the nineteenthcentury,” the New York Times commented in July 1895 that[p]erhaps the most romantic part of the story of this great enterprise would bethe history of the career of the man above all men who made it possible … a manof humble birth, who has risen almost before he reached the fullness of manhoodto a place in the first rank of the world’s great scientists anddiscoverers—Nikola Tesla.…Even now the world is more apt to think of him as a producer of weirdexperimental effects than as a practical and useful inventor. Not so thescientific public or the business men. By the latter classes Tesla is properlyappreciated, honored, perhaps even envied. For he has given to the world acomplete solution of the problem which has taxed the brains and occupied thetime of the greatest electro-scientists of the last two decades—namely, thesuccessful adaption of electrical power transmitted over long distances.39[029_BM029.xhtml#d676]Thus the success of AC at Niagara played a major role in establishing Tesla’sreputation as one of America’s leading inventors. Building on his celebrity fromNiagara, the Wizard was now ready to introduce an even more remarkable powerdistribution system."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENWIRELESS LIGHTING AND THE OSCILLATOR(1893–1894)Through the winter of 1892–93, while he was corresponding with Adams aboutNiagara, Tesla was also working on his high-frequency apparatus. In doing so,several strands from his recent trip to Europe came together. Lord Rayleigh hadtold him that he was destined to discover great things, Sir William Crookes hadsuggested the possibility of using electromagnetic waves to transmit messages,and he had had a moment of insight during the thunderstorm that the forces ofthe Earth might somehow be harnessed. Weaving these strands together, Tesladecided to see if he could discover a way of using the Earth to transmit bothmessages and power.LECTURING IN PHILADELPHIA AND ST. LOUISBut before he could get too far along with new experiments, Tesla agreed tolecture again, first before the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia on 25February 1893 and again the following week at the National Electric LightAssociation in St. Louis. In this lecture, Tesla followed a strategy similar tothe one he employed in his performances in London and Paris, offering Americanaudiences both his philosophical musings on the relationship between electricityand light along with sensational demonstrations.1 [029_BM029.xhtml#d677]In St. Louis, Tesla lectured in the Exhibition Theater, which seated fourthousand, but the hall was packed to suffocation as another several thousandpeople crowded in, most of whom came hoping to see Tesla’s spectaculardemonstrations. The demand for seats was so great that tickets were beingscalped outside the hall for three to five dollars.2 [029_BM029.xhtml#d678]Tesla did not disappoint this huge crowd. In his first demonstrations he allowed200,000 volts to pass through his body; as he described in the publishedlecture:I now set the coil to work and approach the free terminal with a metallic object[most likely a ball] held in my hand, this simply to avoid burns. As I approachthe metallic object to a distance of eight or ten inches, a torrent of furioussparks breaks forth from the end of the secondary wire, which passes through therubber column. The sparks cease when the metal in my hand touches the wire. Myarm is now traversed by a powerful electric current, vibrating at about the rateof one million times a second. All around me the electrostatic force makesitself felt, and the air molecules and particles of dust flying about are actedupon and are hammering violently against my body. So great is this agitation ofparticles, that when the lights are turned out you may see streams of feeblelight appear on some parts of my body. When such a streamer breaks out on anypart of the body, it produces a sensation like the pricking of a needle. Werethe potentials sufficiently high and the frequency of the vibration rather low,the skin would probably be ruptured under the tremendous strain, and the bloodwould rush out with great force in the form of fine spray or jet so thin as tobe invisible.…I can now make these streams of light visible to all, by touching with themetallic object one of the terminals as before, and approaching my free hand tothe brass sphere [connected to the coil’s other terminal].… [T]he air … is moreviolently agitated, and you see streams of light now break forth from myfingertips and from the whole hand.… The streamers offer no particularinconvenience, except that in the ends of the finger tips a burning sensation isfelt.3 [029_BM029.xhtml#d679]In the rest of the lecture, Tesla reviewed systematically the different means bywhich electricity could produce light using effects based on electrostatics,impedance, resonance, and high frequencies. Waving differently shaped tubes inthe strong electromagnetic field created by his oscillating transformer, Teslaproduced “wonderfully beautiful effects … the light of the whirled tube beingmade to look like the white spokes of a wheel of glowing moonbeams.” Near theend of the performance, Tesla held up in his hand one of his phosphorescentbulbs and announced that he would illuminate this lamp by touching his otherhand to his oscillating transformer. When this lamp burst into light, recalledTesla, the audience was so startled that “there was a stampede in the two uppergalleries and they all rushed out. They thought it was some part of the devil’swork, and ran out. That was the way my experiments were received.”4[029_BM029.xhtml#d680]After the lecture, Tesla was mobbed in the lobby as several hundred of St.Louis’s leading citizens rushed up to greet him and vigorously shake his hand.Never a fan of crowds, Tesla found the whole episode overwhelming. As the NewYork Times reported, in St. Louis he “had expected a little gathering of expertelectricians, and though he went through the ordeal bravely, no power on earthwould induce him to try anything like it again.”5 [029_BM029.xhtml#d681]EXPERIMENTING WITH WIRELESS TRANSMISSIONAlthough Tesla’s 1893 lecture covered many of the same topics as his previouslectures, what was new was that Tesla outlined for the first time his hopes forwireless transmission, remarking thatI would say a few words on a subject which constantly fills my thoughts andwhich concerns the welfare of all. I mean the transmission of intelligiblesignals or perhaps even power to any distance without the use of wires.… Myconviction has grown so strong, that I no longer look upon this plan of energyor intelligence transmission as a mere theoretical possibility, but as a seriousproblem in electrical engineering, which must be carried out some day.… Someenthusiasts have expressed their belief that telephony to any distance byinduction through the air is possible. I cannot stretch my imagination so far,but I do firmly believe that it is practicable to disturb by means of powerfulmachines the electrostatic condition of the earth, and thus transmitintelligible signals or perhaps power. In fact, what is there against thecarrying out of such a scheme? We now know that electric vibration may betransmitted through a single conductor. Why then not try to avail ourselves ofthe earth for this purpose?6 [029_BM029.xhtml#d682]For Tesla, wireless transmission did not mean using the waves discovered byHertz but sending power through the earth. As we have seen, he had conductedexperiments that revealed how high-frequency currents could be used to powerlamps and motors that were connected to his oscillating transformer by only onewire. Since the Earth is a conductor, wondered Tesla, why not ground both thetransformer and the lamps and send the current through the earth? In doing so,he would be able to eliminate all of the expensive copper wiring that was beingused in the existing electrical networks.Tesla had intended to say much more about his ideas for harnessing the Earth andhad gone so far as to write up an extensive description of his plans for thewireless transmission of power and messages, boldly speculating on its futurepotential. However, at the last moment he cut his remarks, fearing that he mightscare off potential investors. As Tesla later explained, “I had prepared anelaborate chapter on my wireless system, dwelling on its variousinstrumentalities and future prospects, [but] Mr. Joseph Wetzler and otherfriends of mine emphatically protested against its publication on the groundthat such idle and far-fetched speculations would injure me in the opinion ofconservative business men. So it came that only a small part of what I hadintended to say was embodied in my address.”7 [029_BM029.xhtml#d683]While he was careful about what he said in public about transmitting messagesand power by disturbing the electrical condition of the earth, Teslanevertheless got busy in 1893 pursuing this dream. “A point of greatimportance,” wrote Tesla, “would be first to know what is the [electrical]capacity of the earth? and what charge does it contain if electrified?”8[029_BM029.xhtml#d684]To answer these questions, Tesla turned to his new ideal of resonance. Just asit was possible to produce a sound wave at exactly the right frequency so thatthe waves cause a glass goblet to resonate and then break, Tesla had found itpossible to generate electromagnetic waves at a particular frequency and to thencreate a receiving circuit that would respond—that is, resonate—with thatfrequency. To create tuned circuits, Tesla tinkered with various arrangements ofcoils and capacitors, matching the inductance and capacitance in the transmitterand receiver.9 [029_BM029.xhtml#d685]Using resonance, Tesla now set out to study how high-frequency currents traveledthrough the ground, and he returned to the apparatus he had put together in thefall of 1891 (see Figure 7.3 [016_Chapter016.xhtml#fig7_3]). Again, hishigh-frequency generator and oscillating transformer served as the transmitter.With one terminal of his oscillating transformer grounded to the water mains, heconnected the other terminal to “an insulated body of large surface” (what wewould call an antenna) on the roof of his laboratory downtown on South FifthAvenue. The receiver consisted of several capacitors and an electromagneticrelay. When the capacitors were adjusted to the frequency of the transmittedsignal, the relay caused a tightly stretched wire to vibrate and produce anaudible hum (Figure 10.1 [019_Chapter019.xhtml#fig10_1]). Tesla arranged thesecomponents into a wooden box so that he could carry the receiver tucked underhis arm.10 [029_BM029.xhtml#d686]With the transmitter running in his lab, Tesla carried the receiver throughoutManhattan, stopping periodically to ground the receiver and see if it would humand detect the oscillating current produced by the transmitter. He would oftentake the receiver uptown to the Gerlach Hotel and found that he could detect thecurrent there, about 1.3 miles (2.09 kilometers) from his lab.image [Images/pg_196.jpg]FIGURE 10.1. Receiver used by Tesla to detect electromagnetic waves in themid-1890s. From NTM. However, in transmitting between his lab and the Gerlach, Tesla becamefrustrated because he often detected no signal at his hotel even though thegenerator was running just fine at the lab. Tesla found that the generator didnot produce waves at a single frequency but instead at several frequencies. Inparticular, it did not produce oscillations with the same time period, and thismade it difficult to tune the receiver to the right frequency. This variation infrequency was caused by slight changes in the speed of the steam engine thatdrove the alternator.11 [029_BM029.xhtml#d687]THE OSCILLATORTo overcome this problem, Tesla designed a new AC generator. Rather thangenerate a current by having coils rotate through a magnetic field (as intypical electric generators), Tesla instead built a generator using thereciprocating (or to-and-fro motion) of a piston. His inspiration for this newgenerator dated back to 1884. Shortly after arriving in America, Tesla hadvisited the International Electrical Exhibition organized by the FranklinInstitute in Philadelphia. At the exhibition, he had played with a thick copperwasher with handles so that visitors could move the washer within a strongmagnetic field; because the field would induce eddy currents in the washer as itwas moved, the visitors would feel mechanical resistance to the way they weremanipulating the washer. In moving the washer through the field, Tesla realizedthat it would be possible to create a generator just by moving a conductor usingreciprocating motion.12 [029_BM029.xhtml#d688]To do so, Tesla combined a piston engine with generating coils and a magneticfield. As steam or compressed air drove the piston back and forth, a shaftconnected to the piston moved the generating coils through the magnetic field(see Figure 10.2 [019_Chapter019.xhtml#fig10_2]). By using high pressure andkeeping the stroke of the piston short, Tesla was able to move the coils farmore quickly than in a traditional rotating generator and hence produce currentswith higher frequencies than were previously possible. Moreover, theoscillations produced were completely isochronous, so much so that Tesla boastedthat they could be used to run a clock.13 [029_BM029.xhtml#d689] Tesla calledthis new machine his oscillator and he filed patent applications coveringseveral versions in August and December 1893. He unveiled this new invention ina lecture he gave at the Chicago World’s Fair.14 [029_BM029.xhtml#d690]image [Images/pg_198.jpg]FIGURE 10.2. Tesla’s oscillator, or combination steam engine and generator.This device consisted of three units: a generator at the top, an air spring inthe middle, and a steam engine at the bottom. All three units were connected tothe shaft that runs up the middle. When steam (or compressed air) was introducedinto the cylinder of the steam engine, a piston on the main shaft moved upwardand pushed a second wider piston, constituting an air spring. The air compressedbehind this wider piston created a cushion which eventually pushed back on bothpistons, thus reversing the motion of main shaft (center). As this shaft went upand down, it moved the coils of the generator in and out of an electromagneticfield, thus producing a current.From NT, “Electrical Generator,” US Patent 511,916 (filed 19 Aug. 1893, granted2 Jan. 1894).Tesla found that this new invention provided the precise oscillations he neededfor his high-frequency experiments, and he installed one in his South FifthAvenue laboratory that ran on 350 pounds of pressure. With this oscillator,Tesla could power fifty incandescent lamps, several arc lights, and a variety ofmotors, and he regularly showed it to visitors to the lab.15[029_BM029.xhtml#d691]Tesla, however, soon realized that his oscillator could also be promoted as asolution to the amount of energy wasted in electrical generating stations. Heestimated that barely 5% of the potential energy in coal was actually deliveredin the form of light or power to the consumer—the remaining 95% was lost due tothe thermal inefficiency of boilers and steam engines, mechanical losses arisingusing belts to connect engines and generators, and electrical losses ontransformers and distribution lines. While other inventors might work on raisingthe efficiency of each component in an electrical generating system, Teslapreferred to go to the heart of the matter and use as few components as possibleto convert steam into electricity. Hence in his oscillator, he strove toeliminate all the extra parts typically found in a steam engine—flywheels,control valves, and governors—so that the oscillator was “bared to the skin likea prize-fighter, every ounce counting.” Thanks to his oscillator, Teslapredicted that “we are going to have very shortly a means at hand of producingtwice as much electricity from coal as we can produce at the present time.”16[029_BM029.xhtml#d692]In making such a claim for his oscillator, Tesla was clearly hoping that he hadanother major invention that he could sell—that an entrepreneur would buy thepatents and develop the oscillator as a product in its own right. However, theengineering community was not necessarily impressed with Tesla’s oscillatorsince the most promising replacement for the reciprocating steam engine inelectrical generating plants were the steam turbines already being developed byCharles A. Parsons in England and Gustaf de Laval in Sweden.17[029_BM029.xhtml#d693] As rotating machines, these turbines could be directlycoupled to existing electric generators, they were probably more efficient thanTesla’s oscillator, and, most important, they could be scaled up to deliverpower to larger and larger generators. Although Tesla continued to promote hisoscillator over the next few years, he might well have heeded the advice of aprominent engineer at the Chicago World’s Fair; after hearing Tesla’s lecture onthe wonders of the oscillator, the engineer said to him, “Well, don’t you workon steam engines. You have done some work in electricity. If you stick to it youwill do some good work, but if you work on steam engines you are bound tofail.”18 [029_BM029.xhtml#d694]SPARK GAPS, STOMACH AILMENTS, AND ARTIFICIAL EARTHQUAKESAt the same time that he was working on the oscillator, Tesla conducted anotherset of experiments related to developing a lighting system. Prior to going toEurope, he had focused much of his high-frequency work on developing new bulbsto replace Edison’s inefficient incandescent lamps. To power these new lamps,Tesla planned to replace traditional AC transformers with his new oscillatingtransformer; in fact, the first patent showing his oscillating transformer wasfor a system of electric lighting.19 [029_BM029.xhtml#d695]But to create a functional lighting system, Tesla had to do something about thespark gap connected to the capacitors. In his oscillating transformer, the sparkgap played the vital role of serving as the release mechanism for thecapacitors. Initially the spark gap consisted of two polished brass balls placedclose to one another. At the start of a cycle of charging and discharging thecapacitors, no current could jump the gap between the balls and so electricalcharge accumulated in the capacitors. Once the charge was sufficiently high, thebuilt-up charge would ionize the air between the brass balls and a spark wouldjump across the gap. As the current rushed across the gap in the form of aspark, electromagnetic waves radiated from the circuit. Once the charge wasdepleted from the capacitors, the spark would be extinguished, and the cyclewould begin again. Of course, to produce waves with high frequency, thischarge-discharge cycle would occur thousands of times per second.As he studied the ordinary spark gap—like the one used by Hertz—Tesla realizedthat the train of electromagnetic waves produced by the transmitter was erraticbecause at times the air between the brass balls would remain ionized and acurrent would pass continuously in the form of an electric arc. This arcing wasundesirable because it meant that the current was flowing through the circuitinstead of building up in the capacitors. Hence, to create a more regular trainof waves—and even increase the frequency or number of waves produced—it wasnecessary to carefully control the conditions in the spark gap.20[029_BM029.xhtml#d696]To get a more regular train of electromagnetic waves from his transmitter, Teslatried a variety of devices in place of the spark gap. Since the spark could beextinguished when a strong permanent magnet was brought near it, he fashioned acontroller in which the spark gap was at right angles to a horseshoe magnet.Tesla next tried using several gaps between adjustable wheels (later known as aquenched spark gap). He experimented with replacing the air in the spark gapwith a gas such as hydrogen that would ionize easier and hence allow sparks tojump more frequently; later patented by the Danish wireless pioneer, ValdemarPoulsen, this design became known as the Poulsen arc.21 [029_BM029.xhtml#d697]Tesla also tried to regulate the waves produced by his transmitter by using amechanical oscillator that was similar to the combinationsteam-engine-and-electric-generator described above. In this device, heinitially employed very strong steel springs that required several tons of forceto compress, and he carefully delivered that force using a piston driven bysteam or compressed air. However, as he increased the steam or air pressure inorder to get high rates of vibration, Tesla found that the steel springs brokeand so he replaced them with an air spring in which the piston was driven backwhen a column of air was compressed and then released.22 [029_BM029.xhtml#d698](See Figure 11.2 [020_Chapter020.xhtml#fig11_2] for a more complete descriptionof how the air spring worked.)Although this mechanical oscillator was not particularly suited for regulatingthe transmitter in Tesla’s wireless lighting system, it nonetheless fascinatedhim. As he recalled in the 1930s,I had installed … one of my mechanical oscillators with the object of using itin the exact determination of various physical constants. The machine was boltedin a vertical position to a platform supported on elastic cushions and, whenoperated by compressed air, performed minute oscillations absolutelyisochronous, that is to say, consuming rigorously equal intervals of time.… Oneday, as I was making some observations, I stepped on the platform and thevibrations imparted to it by the machine were transmitted to my body. Thesensation experienced was as strange as agreeable, and I asked my assistants totry. They did so and were mystified and pleased like myself.Suddenly, however, Tesla and his assistants had to respond to a call fromnature: “[S]ome of us, who had stayed longer on the platform, felt anunspeakable and pressing necessity which had to be promptly satisfied,” namelythat they needed to rush to the bathroom and have a bowel movement. However,never one to miss a new opportunity, Tesla saw an application for his inventionhere, as he realized that the rapid oscillations were helping move food morequickly through the intestines and that the vibrating platform might serve tocure digestive ailments. “A stupendous truth dawned upon me” and as a result,“When I began to practice with my assistants MECHANICAL THERAPY we used tofinish our meals quickly and rush back to the laboratory. We suffered fromdyspepsia and various stomach troubles, biliousness, constipation, flatulenceand other disturbances, all natural results of such irregular habit. But afteronly a week of application, during which I improved the technique and myassistants learned how to take the treatment to their best advantage, all thoseforms of sickness disappeared as by enchantment and for nearly four years, whilethe machine was in use, we were all in excellent health.”23[029_BM029.xhtml#d699]Along with his assistants, Tesla also invited visitors to the laboratory to tryhis mechanical therapy, including Mark Twain. Tesla had read Twain’s booksgrowing up in Serbia, and he probably met Twain either dining at Delmonico’s orat his club, The Players (see Chapters 11 [020_Chapter020.xhtml] and 12[021_Chapter021.xhtml]).For his part, Twain was interested in Tesla as a result of his involvement withan inventor named James W. Paige, who developed an automatic typesettingmachine. Twain was fascinated by the possibility of a machine that could set thetype for books and newspapers and believed that the machine would be worthmillions. He had first heard about Paige’s invention in 1880, and he promptlyinvested $5,000 to develop it. By 1887 he had invested a total of $50,000 andwas pouring about $3,000 a month into the typesetter. But along with duplicatingthe actions of a human typesetter, Paige intended that his machine would bepowered by an electric motor, and he convinced Twain in 1887 to invest $1,000specifically in developing a motor. “We tried a direct current—& failed,” notedTwain. “We wanted to try an alternating current, but we lacked the apparatus.”Hence Twain was quite excited to learn that Tesla had perfected an AC motor, andhe had noted in his journal in November 1888, “I have just seen the drawings &description of an electrical machine lately patented by a Mr. Tesla, & sold tothe Westinghouse Company, which will revolutionize the whole electric businessof the world. It is the most valuable patent since the telephone. The drawings &description show that this is the very machine, in every detail which Paigeinvented nearly four years ago.”24 [029_BM029.xhtml#d700]Sometime in the early 1890s, Twain became a regular visitor to Tesla’s lab,where he tried Tesla’s mechanical cure. “He came to the laboratory in the worstshape suffering from a variety of distressing and dangerous ailments,” recalledTesla, “but in less than two months he regained his old vigor and ability ofenjoying life to the fullest extent.”25 [029_BM029.xhtml#d701]Tesla conducted another experiment with his mechanical oscillator a few yearslater at his laboratory on Houston Street in order to understand resonance, andthe result was an artificial earthquake. By now he had developed a much smallerversion that “you could put in your overcoat pocket.” “I was experimenting withvibrations,” he explained, andI had one of my machines going and I wanted to see if I could get it in tunewith the vibration of the building. I put it up notch after notch. There was apeculiar cracking sound.I asked my assistants where did the sound come from. They did not know. I putthe machine up a few more notches. There was a louder cracking sound. I knew Iwas approaching the vibration of the steel building. I pushed the machine alittle higher.Suddenly all the heavy machinery in the place was flying around. I grabbed ahammer and broke the machine. The building would have been down about our earsin another few minutes. Outside in the street there was pandemonium. The policeand ambulances arrived. I told my assistants to say nothing. We told the policeit must have been an earthquake. That’s all they ever knew about it.26[029_BM029.xhtml#d702]A SYSTEM FOR WIRELESS LIGHTINGBut while it was fun to play with the mechanical oscillator, it was not thesolution that Tesla needed in order to perfect his wireless lighting system.Consequently, in 1893, he devised yet another substitute for the spark gap byinserting a fan or turbine spinning between the terminals of the spark gap;sparks would jump between the stationary terminals and the turbine blades, andthe sparks would be shorter and quicker as a result of the turbine spinningrapidly. To minimize any chance of arcing between the blades and the terminals,Tesla immersed the entire spark gap in an oil tank; by pumping oil through thetank, the flow of the oil turned the turbine blades that interrupted the sparks.Using this circuit controller, Tesla was able to produce frequencies in therange of 30,000 to 80,000 cycles per second.27 [029_BM029.xhtml#d703]Tesla was quite proud of this new circuit controller, and he filed a patentapplication for it in August 1893. However, he did not appreciate its fullpotential for transmitting power and messages without wires until hedemonstrated it for the great German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz at theChicago World’s Fair. After showing him this invention and describing his hopesfor using it for wireless transmission, Tesla asked Helmholtz, “Excellency, doyou think that my plan is realizable?” to which the distinguished scientistreplied, “Why, certainly it is, but first you must produce the apparatus.”28[029_BM029.xhtml#d704]Encouraged by Helmholtz, Tesla redoubled his efforts to understand what wasoccurring as the capacitors in his oscillating transformer were rapidly chargedand discharged by the circuit controller. As he studied this phenomenon, Teslarealized that they functioned as the electrical analog to a pile driver. Just asmore energy is stored as the heavy weight in the pile driver is raised higherand higher, one can control the capacitors in order to store more energy witheach charge-and-discharge cycle. And just as one releases the pile driversuddenly so that it delivers all its stored-up energy with one downward blow,one can discharge a capacitor in a very short interval and deliver a tremendousamount of electrical energy. “For instance,” explained Tesla, “if the engine[used to power the AC generator] is of 200 horsepower, I take the energy out fora minute interval of time, at a rate of 5,000 to 6,000 horsepower, then I store[it] in a condenser and discharge the same at the rate of several millions ofhorsepower.”29 [029_BM029.xhtml#d705]To convey to visitors how much energy could be concentrated by the capacitors inhis oscillating transformer, Tesla would sometimes pass through his apparatusenergy at a rate of several thousand horsepower, put a piece of thick tinfoil ona stick, and approach it to that coil. The tinfoil would melt, and would notonly melt, but while it was still in that form, it would be evaporated and thewhole process took place in so small an interval of time that it was like acannon shot. Instantly, I put it there, there was an explosion. That was astriking experiment. It simply showed the power of the condenser [i.e.,capacitor], and at that time I was so reckless that in order to demonstrate tomy visitors that my theories were correct, I would stick my head into that coiland I was not hurt; but I would not do it now.30 [029_BM029.xhtml#d706]image [Images/pg_205.jpg]FIGURE 10.3. Circuit used by Tesla to deliver wireless power to his lamps in hisSouth Fifth Avenue laboratory circa 1894.In practice, the primary shown above was a thick cable around the perimeter ofthe main room and the secondary was the moveable coil shown in Figure 10.4[019_Chapter019.xhtml#fig10_4].Redrawn from NT, “True History of the Wireless,” p. 29.As Tesla came to appreciate how he could use his oscillating transformer toconcentrate power, he realized that he could now modify his distributioncircuits in order to transmit power across a room and light lamps without anywires. In his previous patents, Tesla had connected his oscillating transformerto a second transformer that in turn distributed the power to his lights. Butnow thanks to the increased concentration of power, he could separate the twowindings in this second transformer and transmit power between them even if theywere separated by ten or twenty feet (Figure 10.3[019_Chapter019.xhtml#fig10_3]).On the transmitting side of this new wireless lighting system, Tesla now usedhis oscillator to charge a bank of capacitors that in turn were connected to alarge cable that ran around the perimeter of the main hall (which was 40 × 80feet) of the lab. Effectively a coil with just one turn of wire, this largecable took the place of the primary winding of the old second transformer. Onthe receiving end, Tesla used a three-foot-tall coil in place of the secondarywinding of the old second transformer (Figure 10.4[019_Chapter019.xhtml#fig10_4]). Mounted on casters, this receiving coil couldbe rolled about the main hall to see where it worked best. Even more important,it could be adjusted so as to resonate to the frequency generated by thetransmitter. Instead of the energy being transmitted between two plates—as inhis lectures at Columbia and the Royal Institution—the energy now movedwirelessly between two coils.31 [029_BM029.xhtml#d707]image [Images/pg_206.jpg]FIGURE 10.4. The receiving coil for Tesla’s resonant transformer, as used in theSouth Fifth Avenue laboratory circa 1894.From TCM, “Tesla’s Oscillator and Other Inventions,” The Century Magazine49:916–33 (April 1895), Fig. 10.Tesla had this system perfected by February 1894 and showed it off inspectacular private demonstrations to friends, select professional groups, and afew journalists.32 [029_BM029.xhtml#d708] One of these lucky reporters describedhis experience in the following way:I glanced about in some bewilderment after hearing Mr. Tesla say that he had asurprise in store for me. Promptly suiting the action to the word, he called inseveral employees from the workshop and issued a succession of hurried orderswhich I followed but vaguely. Presently, however, the doors were shut and thecurtains drawn until every chink or crevice for the admission of light wasconcealed, and the laboratory was bathed in absolutely impenetrable gloom. Iawaited developments with intense interest.The next minute exquisitely beautiful luminous signs and devices of mysticorigin began to flash about me with startling frequency. Sometimes they seemediridescent, while again a dazzling white light prevailed.“Take hold,” said a voice, and I felt a sort of handle thrust into my hand. ThenI was gently led forward and told to wave it. On complying, I spelled the word“Welcome” flaming before my eyes. Unfortunately, I was totally unable at thetime to appreciate the kindly sentiment implied.A hand approached mine ere I had quite recovered, and I felt the tips of myfingers lightly brushed. Fancy my dire dismay when I immediately experienced anacute tingling sensation, accompanied by a brief pyrotechnic display that wassurprising to say the least. When the daylight as well as my equanimity was in ameasure restored, I learned something of the meaning of these wondrousexperiments, which may be said to foreshadow in a way the electric light of thefuture.33 [029_BM029.xhtml#d709]As the reporter subsequently learned, the “devices of mystic origin” he saw litup in the dark were but a sampling of the many lamps that Tesla had devised:some were tubes with gases at a low pressure and some had phosphorescentcoatings (like modern fluorescent tubes), but none had filaments (Figure 10.5[019_Chapter019.xhtml#fig10_5]). Tesla believed that the oscillations—or, as heoften said, the electrostatic “thrusts”—emanating from his transmitter loadedenergy onto the ether between the two coils. Because there were relatively fewgas molecules inside the tubes, the molecules were easily agitated by the“thrusts” and caused to glow. Since neither the transmitter nor the receivingcoil was grounded, the energy not through the Earth but rather by means of the“thrusts” or electromagnetic waves was moving through the ether.Lest one think that his wireless lighting scheme would work only with these newtubes, Tesla also demonstrated how ordinary incandescent lamps could be poweredby his apparatus. To do so, he connected a standard sixteen candlepower lamp tothe terminals of the resonating coil in the center of the room, and it waspowered wirelessly by energy generated by the transmitter (see Figure 10.4[019_Chapter019.xhtml#fig10_4]).In these increasingly elaborate demonstrations, Tesla was becoming more and moreconfident about the potential of his wireless lighting system and that it couldcompete with the reigning Edison incandescent system. Indeed, Tesla might wellhave been thinking about his wireless lighting system when he wrote to his unclein November 1893, “I have just completed a new invention that is great! Successis wonderful to me in every aspect except money. That will come soon.”34[029_BM029.xhtml#d710]image [Images/pg_208.jpg]FIGURE 10.5. “Three phosphorescent bulbs under test for actinic value,photographed by their own light.”From TCM, “Tesla’s Oscillator and Other Inventions,” The Century Magazine49:916–33 (April 1895), Fig. 5."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVENEFFORTSAT PROMOTION(1894–1895)It is difficult to give you an idea [of] how I am respectedhere in the scientific community.

Itwas now time to start promoting these inventions in order to attract newcustomers for the patents he had secured. Just as he had done with Peck andBrown five years earlier with the AC motor, Tesla set out to shape theexpectations—the illusions—that people would have for these new inventions. Todo so, Tesla decided that he needed to establish his reputation as a leadingelectrical inventor (Figure 11.1 [020_Chapter020.xhtml#fig11_1]).image [Images/pg_210.jpg]FIGURE 11.1. Tesla circa 1894–95. From NTM. It is easy to assume that reputations in technology and science growautomatically out of an individual’s accomplishments. However, reputations, likeeverything else in technology and science, are actively constructed byindividuals and groups. In particular, individuals draw on the resources oftheir time and place—their culture—to construct a reputation that makes themcredible.1 [029_BM029.xhtml#d711]During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, it was especially difficultto construct a credible reputation as an inventor or scientist in America. Inthe decades following the American Civil War, there was a tremendous sense ofuncertainty about professions and social roles—that anyone who wanted to be alawyer or doctor or engineer could simply announce that they were a practitionerin one of these fields and set up a business. No one was quite sure what therules were: Did one need a college degree or other credential? Should one belongto a professional organization? Did one need to publish papers or demonstratetheir expertise in some other way? What did it mean to be an authority and whatdid it mean to be famous?2 [029_BM029.xhtml#d712]To be sure, organizations in a variety of fields moved quickly to establishstandards and clarify the role of the professional in their discipline, but ittook from the 1870s to the 1910s for this work to be completed.3[029_BM029.xhtml#d713] In the meantime, in these fluid decades, individuals werefree to experiment with how they shaped their professional personae, drawing ondifferent elements of American culture.In this chapter we will look at how Tesla, with the help of his friends, shapedhis reputation. He now cultivated an image of being a brilliant, even eccentric,genius. Tesla delighted in showing off his wireless lamps, and after dinners atDelmonico’s he would invite celebrities to late-night demonstrations in hislaboratory. Just as newspaper reporters had covered Edison’s exploits at MenloPark in the 1870s, they flocked to Tesla’s laboratory in the 1890s to cover hissensational discoveries. Like Edison, Tesla delighted in telling lively storiesand promising great results for his inventions.T. C. MARTIN AND THE BOOKTesla’s efforts at promotion were strongly shaped by his friendship with ThomasCommerford Martin (1856–1924), the editor of Electrical Engineer, one of theleading weekly electrical journals. Martin functioned as Tesla’s publicitymanager in the mid-1890s and did more than anyone else to help Tesla establishhis reputation.Born in England, Martin spent part of his boyhood traveling aboard the massivesteamship Great Eastern while his father helped lay the transatlantic telegraphcable. After studying theology, Martin immigrated to the United States to workwith Edison at Menlo Park. Noticing that Martin had a gift for writing, Edisonencouraged the young Englishman to publish stories about the telephone andphonograph in the New York newspapers. In 1882 he became an editor at thetelegraph journal The Operator, which was soon renamed Electrical World. Alongwith his editorial work, Martin helped found the American Institute ofElectrical Engineering in 1884 and served as the institute’s president in1887–88.4 [029_BM029.xhtml#d714]As we have seen, Martin first became acquainted with Tesla’s work in April 1888when he was invited to see a demonstration of Tesla’s AC motor in the LibertyStreet laboratory (see Chapter 5 [014_Chapter014.xhtml]). A few weeks later, hearranged for Tesla to lecture before the AIEE. Knowing that AC motorsrepresented a breakthrough for the utility industry, Martin and his felloweditor Joseph Wetzler published a book in 1889 on the development of electricmotors.5 [029_BM029.xhtml#d715]Martin watched with interest the growing public excitement stimulated by Tesla’slectures on wireless lighting. In particular, Martin must have noticed thatprior to Tesla’s lecture before the National Electric Light Association (NELA)in St. Louis, a young entrepreneur had printed up extra copies of the NELAbulletin containing a biographical article on Tesla and that he sold fourthousand copies on the street before Tesla spoke. As the New York Heraldreported, this was “something unprecedented in the history of electricaljournalism.”6 [029_BM029.xhtml#d716] If a pamphlet had sold so well, why not abook about Tesla?Consequently, in the spring of 1893, Martin and Tesla started planning a bookthat would bring together Tesla’s lectures, a description of his inventions, anoutline of his work on high-frequency lighting, and a biographical sketch. Aftera nasty contract dispute with the publisher of Electrical World, Martin had leftin 1890 to edit the rival Electrical Engineer, and he undoubtedly hoped that theTesla book would help draw readers away from Electrical World and over to hispaper.7 [029_BM029.xhtml#d717] Although Tesla could rely on Martin as “one ofthe best writers in the technical field,” he found the process of composing abook in English to be difficult; nevertheless, he understood that the book wasessential to establishing his reputation. As he explained to a cousin back homein Serbia: “In addition to all my work, I am going to write a book. It is goingto be unusually evil [Tesla probably meant difficult or demanding]. I intend toannounce various apparatus and experiments that are going through my head aftersome years of work. I have compiled everything from what I have read inmagazines and what is new. It can hurt me or possibly help me. My ambition is tocome out not as a technician but as an inventor.”8 [029_BM029.xhtml#d718]Published under the title The Inventions, Researches, and Writings of NikolaTesla, the book appeared in January 1894. At Martin’s suggestion, it wasdedicated to Tesla’s fellow countrymen in eastern Europe. In its review, the NewYork Times noted that the assembly of the materials for the volume must havebeen “by no means [an] easy task” but that Tesla and Martin had successfullyaccomplished it.9 [029_BM029.xhtml#d719]Thrilled to have a book summarizing his work, Tesla eagerly sent copies to hisfamily in Serbia, friends, and his former associates at Westinghouse. Hoping tosell the book rather than give it way, Martin told Tesla that “[y]our request[for more free copies] is just too hard. It seems to me that the Pittsburghboys, if they love you, ought to be willing to blow a little money of their ownon the book.” Since Tesla was so keen to give out copies, Martin suggested that“[p]erhaps you would like to make us a bid on the whole edition.” Hoping to makeup the losses by selling Tesla’s signature, Martin closed by saying in jest,“When you write me, make it autographic as often as you can. People arebeginning to deplete my stock.”10 [029_BM029.xhtml#d720]The Inventions, Researches, and Writings proved popular. The first edition soldout within a month, a second edition by the end of 1894, and a third edition wasreleased in February 1895. It was favorably reviewed in Europe as well asAmerica, and a German edition appeared in 1895. While the book earned a tidy sumfor Martin, Tesla convinced his editor to lend him the proceeds from the bookbut he never repaid Martin. As a result, grumbled Martin decades later, “Twoyears of work went for nothing.”11 [029_BM029.xhtml#d721]Although Martin complained later, in 1894 he regarded Tesla as an up-and-comingscientific celebrity and did everything he could to help promote this newwizard. In February he escorted Tesla to the swanky New York apartment of GianniBettini, an early audiophile who had made several improvements to Edison’scylinder phonograph. Drawing on his social connections, Bettini recorded thevoices of opera singers, presidents, and popes, and Martin was anxious to haveTesla’s voice in Bettini’s collection.12 [029_BM029.xhtml#d722] Martin alsoarranged a sitting for Tesla before a sculptor named Wolff, and he put Tesla incontact with S. S. McClure, who was looking for contributors for the eponymousmagazine he had just started. Tesla and McClure dined together, and as Martinreported back to his protégé, McClure “knows now personally … that you are agreat man and a nice fellow.” Although McClure was keen for a contribution,Tesla declined: “Much as I would like to comply with your amiable request, Ifind it impossible at present, as every moment of my time is taken up by workwhich I must finish without delay.”13 [029_BM029.xhtml#d723]“THE FILIPOVS”: ROBERT AND KATHARINE JOHNSONBut the most important thing that Martin did for Tesla was introduce him toRobert Underwood Johnson (1853–1937) and his wife, Katharine (d. 1924) (Figures11.2 and 11.3), in the fall of 1893. Socially prominent and gracious, Robert andKatharine became the inventor’s closest friends.Born in Washington, D.C., Johnson grew up in Indiana. As a teenager, he workedas a telegraph operator and sometimes received messages from another operatornamed Thomas Edison. Johnson joined the staff of the popular magazine Scribner’sMonthly in 1873 and, on occasion, visited Edison at Menlo Park in order to coverhis inventions. In 1881, when Scribner’s became The Century Magazine, Johnsonwas named associate editor, and he served as chief editor from 1909 to 1913. Toboost The Century’s circulation, Johnson convinced Ulysses S. Grant to write aseries of articles about Civil War campaigns. With the help of Mark Twain, hethen convinced the general to write his memoirs, which subsequently became abestseller. Johnson married Katharine McMahon of Washington, D.C., in 1876,attracted to her red hair, Irish ancestry, and fiery personality.14[029_BM029.xhtml#d724]image [Images/pg_214.jpg]FIGURE 11.2. Robert Underwood Johnson and Tesla in the South Fifth Avenuelaboratory. From NTM. Tesla immediately hit it off with the Johnsons, and in December 1893 he invitedthem to join him at the premiere of Antonín Dvořák’s New World Symphony. “Uponreceipt of your first note,” wrote the Wizard to Robert, “I immediately securedthe best seats I could for Saturday. Nothing better than the 15th row! Verysorry, we shall have to use telescopes. But I think the better for Mrs.Johnson’s vivid imagination. Dinner at Delmonico’s.” Katharine reciprocated bysending Tesla flowers on 6 January, the day Orthodox Christians celebrateChristmas. “I have to thank Mrs. Johnson for the magnificent flowers,” Teslapenned Robert. “I have never as yet received flowers, and they produced upon mea curious effect.” In return, Tesla sent Katharine a Crookes radiometer that heregarded “from the scientific viewpoint [as] the most beautiful inventionmade.”15 [029_BM029.xhtml#d725]image [Images/pg_215.jpg]FIGURE 11.3. Katharine Johnson. From NTM. In the years that followed, the Johnsons regularly invited Tesla to dinners andparties at their townhouse at 327 Lexington Avenue. There, Tesla met a host ofsocial and intellectual luminaries including the sculptor August Saint-Gaudens,the naturalist John Muir, the children’s author Mary Mapes Dodge, the pianistIgnace Padrewski, and the writer Rudyard Kipling. At one soiree, an English ladyturned to the inventor and asked, “And you, Mr. Tesla, what do you do?” “Oh, Idabble a little in electricity,” responded Tesla. “Indeed,” came the reply.“Keep at it and don’t be discouraged. You may end by doing something someday.”16[029_BM029.xhtml#d726]Knowing that Johnson was a poet, Tesla recited Serbian poetry for him, includingJovan Jovanović Zmaj’s poem “Luka Filipov.” In this ballad, Zmaj recounts theheroic deeds of Luka and his death in an 1874 battle between the Serbs and theTurks. Enthralled, Johnson had Tesla prepare English translations of this andother poems by Zmaj for The Century and he included “Luka Filipov” in hisanthology, Songs of Liberty. Thereafter, Tesla always referred to Robert as Lukaand Katharine as Madame Filipov.17 [029_BM029.xhtml#d727]Since Tesla could not entertain the Filipovs in his bachelor quarters at theGerlach, he had them visit his laboratory on South Fifth instead. “We werefrequently invited to witness his experiments,” recalled Robert, in which“[l]ightning-like flashes of electrical fire of the length of fifteen feet werean every-day occurrence, and his tubes of electric light were used to makephotographs of many of his friends as a souvenir of their visits.”18[029_BM029.xhtml#d728] But rather than let the photographs just be souvenirs forfriends, wondered Johnson, why not have special pictures taken using one ofTesla’s inventions and publish them as a “first” in The Century? In particular,Johnson was intrigued by Tesla’s efforts to use “phosphorescent light”—what wewould now call fluorescent light—for photographic purposes (Figure 11.4[020_Chapter020.xhtml#fig11_4]).image [Images/pg_216.jpg]FIGURE 11.4. “First photograph ever taken by phosphorescent light. The face isthat of Mr. Tesla, and the source of the light is one of his phosphorescentbulbs. Time of exposure, eight minutes. Date of photograph January 1894.”From TCM, “Tesla’s Oscillator and Other Inventions,” The Century Magazine49:916–33 (April 1895), Fig. 3.Having just published a biographical sketch of Tesla written by Martin, Johnsonsuggested to Martin that he might write another story for The Century aboutTesla that would include portraits taken under this new light source.19[029_BM029.xhtml#d729] Martin readily agreed but recommended that they takeprecautions lest news of the photographs leaked out. “I will lock [them] up orput [them] in a safe deposit vault, if you wish until the hour of publication,”Martin told Johnson. “But I want to get one of the first as a historicalsouvenir.” Martin realized that the most likely source of a leak would be Teslahimself and that he would have to coach his protégé; as he wrote to Tesla, “Ithink that we ought to have a little talk about giving to the daily newspapers ahint that [you have] succeeded in taking photos by phosphorescence. It will leakout some hour and then someone … with customary arrogance [will place it] in thepapers.… [We need] to get our priorities established. I think R. U. Johnsonfeels the same way.”20 [029_BM029.xhtml#d730]Heeding Martin’s advice to keep quiet about the pictures, Tesla got to workpreparing the necessary electrical apparatus. As he wrote to Johnson in February1894,I have been hard at work to-day replaning and adjusting. I think we can makesome trials to-morrow.I have prepared a tube for you and expect that it will show up well.… We may tryto get a photo of the magnificent profile of Mr. Clemens. I have not yetcommunicated with the photographers because I have to try something in themorning. I shall immediately let them know if everything is all right. The besttime to come would be 4 PM.21 [029_BM029.xhtml#d731]The photographers were from Tonnele & Company who had done previous work for TheCentury.22 [029_BM029.xhtml#d732] Along with Mark Twain, Johnson invited theactor Joseph Jefferson and the novelist Francis Marion Crawford to pose in thephotographs.23 [029_BM029.xhtml#d733] Tesla had each guest participate byholding a large loop of wire in their hands. When the loop was placed over theresonating coil in the center of the laboratory (see Figure 10.4[019_Chapter019.xhtml#fig10_4]), enough current was wirelessly transmitted fromthe coil to the loop so as to illuminate two or three lamps placed between thevisitor’s hands (Figure 11.5 [020_Chapter020.xhtml#fig11_5]). “Strange as it mayseem,” observed Martin, “these currents, of a voltage one or two hundred timesas high as that employed in electrocution, do not inconvenience the experimenterin the slightest. The extremely high tension of the currents which Mr. Clemensis seen receiving prevents them from doing any harm to him.”24[029_BM029.xhtml#d734]When the prints came back from Tonnele, Tesla was thrilled with all of them, buthe especially liked one of Jefferson, finding it “simply immense. I mean the oneshowing him alone in the darkness. I think it is a [work] of art.” To celebratethis successful project, Katharine Johnson proposed a dinner at Delmonico’sbefore she and Robert left for summer vacation at the Hamptons on Long Island.While Tesla was becoming cautious about accepting every invitation that came hisway, he could not resist an evening with his favorite couple: “Even dining atDelmonico’s is too much of a high life for me and I fear that if I depart veryoften from my simple habits I shall come to grief. I had formed the firm resolvenot to accept any invitations, however tempting; but in this moment I rememberthat the pleasure of your company will soon be denied to me (as I am unable tofollow you to East Hampton where you intend camping out this summer)—anirresistible desire takes hold of me to become a participant of that dinner.”25[029_BM029.xhtml#d735] As they had planned, Johnson and Martin waited for theright moment to release the photographs, and they did not appear in The Centuryuntil April 1895.26 [029_BM029.xhtml#d736]image [Images/pg_218.jpg]FIGURE 11.5. Mark Twain in Tesla’s laboratory, 1894. Tesla is in the backgroundto the left.From TCM, “Tesla’s Oscillator and Other Inventions,” The Century Magazine49:916–33 (April 1895), Fig. 13.NEWSPAPER NOTORIETY AND HONORARY DEGREESThrough 1894, Tesla began to enjoy more newspaper coverage, most likely due tothe efforts of Martin and Johnson, who had connections at various papers. JamesGordon Bennett’s New York Herald had been covering Tesla’s exploits for severalyears, but the Wizard was now a subject of feature articles in Joseph Pulitzer’sNew York World (as recounted in the introduction), the New York Times, and theSavannah Morning News. Indeed, since Tesla was so popular, some reportersresorted to writing bogus stories without bothering to interview the inventor.“For example,” reported Martin, “one vivid young lady of the press, in heranxiety to be instructive, went so far as to depict herself undergoing abrilliant electrical ordeal that is possible only with the body entirely naked.”Such an episode, Martin assured his readers, had never happened and was highlyunlikely given how reticent Tesla was around women (see Chapter 12[021_Chapter021.xhtml]).27 [029_BM029.xhtml#d737]Illustrated with his portrait, these feature stories recounted Tesla’s earlyyears, described his physical appearance, and commented on his style ofinvention. In talking to reporters, Tesla was much like a modern-dayprofessional athlete who often tries to strike a balance between boasting abouthis or her ability (which is, after all, the purpose of the interview) anddisplaying some modesty about his accomplishments. “It is an embarrassment tome,” Tesla told one reporter, “that my work has attracted as much publicattention, not only because I believe that an earnest man who loves science morethan all should let his work speak for him … but because I am afraid that someof the scientists whose friendship I value very much suspect me of encouragingnewspaper notoriety.”28 [029_BM029.xhtml#d738]While his professional colleagues were undoubtedly suspicious that Tesla wascourting the press, they were nonetheless impressed with him as a pathfinder, assomeone who was challenging them to rethink the nature of electricity andpossible new applications. When the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia presentedTesla with the Elliott Cresson Gold Medal in 1893 for his work on new forms ofelectric lighting, it noted that he had “developed a new and very importantfield of research in that direction in which little had been done before, andone which opened the way to very valuable results, the most important of whichis … the rational generation of artificial or ‘cold light’ as it is oftencalled. Although he has not yet solved the problem from a commercial standpoint,he has … opened a probable way for the solution of this most important anddifficult problem.”29 [029_BM029.xhtml#d739]The Cresson Medal was followed by honorary degrees. Several universities wereanxious to recognize Tesla since he had been “covered with honors while inEngland and France” and it would be an embarrassment not to recognize “a man wholives under our very eyes.” One invitation came from the University of Nebraska,but Tesla was probably not interested in taking time away from his work to makethe long train trip from New York to Lincoln. “I have urged him to accept,”complained Martin to Johnson, and “I want you and Mrs. Johnson to bring yourinfluence on him also. Her spell is now a potent one, I fancy, with him, so faras any woman’s can be, next [to] his sisters.”30 [029_BM029.xhtml#d740]Although neither Martin nor Katharine could persuade Tesla to accept thehonorary degree from Nebraska, Robert did write on Tesla’s behalf to ColumbiaUniversity:I think it may truly be said that there are few men … whose work promised morefor the amelioration of the hard conditions of the poorer classes. Having seen agreat deal of Mr. Tesla during the last six months … I have never heard asubject of scientific [importance] mentioned in his presence upon which he didnot seem to be thoroughly well informed. As you undoubtedly know, he is on termsof intimate friendship with Crookes, Helmholtz, Lord Kelvin & others. Hertz washis friend.…As to his general culture, I may say that he knows the language and is widelyread in the best literature of Italy, Germany and France as well as much of theSlavic countries to say nothing of Greek and Latin. He is particularly fond ofpoetry and is always quoting Leopardi or Dante or Goethe or the Hungarians andRussians. I know of few men of such diversity of general culture or suchaccuracy of knowledge.Such a portrayal would have made Tesla’s father proud, and Johnson closed bydescribing Tesla’s character as “one of distinguished sweetness, sincerity,modesty, refinement, generosity, and force.” Convinced by Johnson’srecommendation, Columbia presented Tesla with an honorary doctorate in June1894, and this was followed by another from Yale University.31[029_BM029.xhtml#d741]PUTTING THE PATENTS UP FOR SALE: THE NIKOLA TESLA COMPANYWith growing coverage in both newspapers and the technical press as well asmedals and degrees to show off, it was time to take the next step in a promotionstrategy and form a company that would market and license his patents. To createthis company, Tesla turned to Edward Dean Adams. As we saw in Chapter 9[018_Chapter018.xhtml], Adams was the driving force behind the promotion ofhydroelectric power at Niagara. At a critical moment in 1893 when his companyhad to decide between using AC or DC for Niagara, Adams had followed Tesla’sadvice.After visiting the lab and seeing several demonstrations, Adams agreed topromote Tesla’s latest inventions, and together they launched the Nikola TeslaCompany in February 1895. Adams fancied himself as being eminently capable ofhelping Tesla; as his biographer gushed, the financier had assisted several“struggling geniuses who afterward saw [with] clearer eyes and performed withgreater zeal and skill because they took counsel with Edward Dean Adams.”32[029_BM029.xhtml#d742]Since this new company was going to promote not only Tesla’s recenthigh-frequency patents but also those assigned earlier to Peck and Brown, Adamsand Tesla included Alfred Brown as a director in the company. In addition, theyinvited another Niagara promoter, William Rankine, as well as Charles F. Coaneyof Summit, New Jersey, to serve as directors. Adams hoped that his son Ernest,who had just published a story about Tesla, would join the company after hefinished studying engineering at Yale.33 [029_BM029.xhtml#d743]The Nikola Tesla Company planned to “manufacture and sell machinery, generators,motors, electrical apparatus, etc.,” and the directors planned to issue stock tocapitalize it at $500,000.34 [029_BM029.xhtml#d744] If fully subscribed byinvestors, this level of capitalization would have certainly provided Tesla withthe funds he would need to develop his high-frequency inventions fully. However,it would not have been sufficient to undertake manufacturing on a commercialscale. Hence, despite the claim that it was going to manufacture electricalapparatus, it would appear that the Nikola Tesla Company was part of apromotion-oriented strategy. Once Tesla’s lighting system and oscillator hadbeen perfected, then either the patents or the entire company could be sold;this is what Tesla had done with the European rights to his motor patents in1892.35 [029_BM029.xhtml#d745] Although Adams eventually invested about $100,000in Tesla’s work, he most likely saw himself not as an investor but as apromoter—someone who made his fortune by combining Tesla’s technology and otherpeople’s money into an attractive enterprise.36 [029_BM029.xhtml#d746] This iswhat Adams’s career on Wall Street was all about—he was a master at reorganizingrailroads and other companies so that people would invest in them.Together, Tesla and Adams waited for other investors to join the Nikola TeslaCompany, but no one took up their offer. Why were there no takers for Tesla’sinventions circa 1895?In large measure, Tesla was stymied by business conditions. In the five yearsfollowing the Panic of 1893, the American economy was in a recession. During themid-1890s, neither the existing electrical manufacturers nor utility companieswere especially profitable.37 [029_BM029.xhtml#d747] If the companies usingEdison’s DC incandescent lighting system or Westinghouse’s AC power equipmentwere not earning money, why should investors take a chance on Tesla’snext-generation technology of high-frequency AC?While part of the problem was the recession, another part of the problem wasTesla himself. Having launched the Nikola Tesla Company for the purpose ofselling or licensing his inventions, the next step was to show that theseinventions could readily be converted into commercially feasible products. Inthis phase—commonly called development—the inventor has to know when to movefrom generating lots of alternative designs to focusing on perfecting the mostpromising version. In other words, the inventor needs to shift from divergent toconvergent thinking.38 [029_BM029.xhtml#d748] For both geniuses and meremortals, divergent thinking is much more fun than convergent thinking; it’s alot more enjoyable to dream up new alternatives than to face the difficultiesassociated with making a device reliable, efficient, and cost-effective.Tesla, I suspect, had a genuine problem making the shift from divergent toconvergent thinking. “A notable faculty of Tesla’s mind is that of rushingintuition,” observed one reporter. “You begin to state a question or propositionto him and before you have half formulated it he has suggested six ways ofdealing with it and ten of getting around it.”39 [029_BM029.xhtml#d749] In themid-1890s, Tesla seems to have put off doing the essential work of development.In his lectures, he was never satisfied with demonstrating just a few of themost promising versions of his lamps; he felt compelled to show a dozenvariations. Moreover, every few months Tesla would let reporters visit hislaboratory so they could write up his latest discovery. Tesla may very well havethought that sheer variety conveyed the power of his genius, but it actuallysent the wrong message to investors. If they were going to risk capital on aninventor and his patents, investors needed to feel confident that the inventorwas willing to get down to the nitty-gritty of creating a marketable product.Tesla’s business partners also had an impact on his failing to shift fromdivergent to convergent thinking at this point. In the development of the ACmotor, Tesla had relied heavily on Peck for guidance about how to patent,promote, and ultimately sell his invention. Unfortunately, Peck diedunexpectedly in 1890, just as Tesla was starting his work on high-frequency AC.While Tesla’s other early business partner, Brown, was involved with the NikolaTesla Company, he does not appear to have had any significant input into thedevelopment of Tesla’s later inventions. Both Adams and Rankine were certainlyastute businessmen, but they were extremely busy and their expertise was infinance, not patent strategy or engineering. Hence there was no one who couldhelp Tesla focus his work on a few select designs and then vigorously promotethose to investors and entrepreneurs.FROM WIRELESS LIGHTING TO RESONANT POWERIn response to the lack of interest by investors to his wireless lighting systemand his oscillator, Tesla began to rethink what he might do with high-frequencyAC. And rather than concentrate on developing one particular aspect, he decidedto expand the scope of his efforts: he would go from lighting a few rooms toambitiously powering the earth.Although visitors were astounded by his incredible demonstrations with thephosphorescent lamps and oscillating transformer, Tesla now started thinkingthat this apparatus did not represent the way forward. Here the illusions—thespecial effects—were distracting people from fully understanding the ideal thatwas evolving in Tesla’s mind. “They could not understand these manifestations ofenergy and thought that it was a genuine transmission of power,” Teslaexplained. “I told them that these phenomena were wonderful, but that a systemof transmission, based on the same principle, was absolutely worthless. It wastransmission by electromagnetic waves. The solution lay in a differentdirection.”40 [029_BM029.xhtml#d750]Practical problems prompted Tesla to reject the idea of transmitting power usingelectromagnetic waves through the ether or atmosphere. In the course of buildingresonating apparatus in his laboratory, he was frustrated by the challenge oftuning the transmitter and receiver to exactly the same frequency. “It would bewearisome,” observed Martin, “to dwell on the difficulty often experienced inestablishing the relation of ‘resonance,’ and the instantaneity with which itcan be disturbed.… This harmonizing is deftly accomplished by varying either ofthe two elements which chiefly govern the rapidity of vibration, viz., theso-called ‘capacity’ and the ‘self-induction’ [of the transmitting and receivingcircuits].… In very exact adjustments, minute changes will completely upset thebalance, and the very last straw of fine wire, for example in the induction-coilwhich gives the self-induction will break the spell.” Although Tesla “could pickup wire, coil it up, and tell what the vibration would be without any test,” thedifficulty of tuning the two circuits to respond to the same frequency suggestedto Tesla that it would not be easy to convert his laboratory demonstrationequipment into a reliable commercial system.41 [029_BM029.xhtml#d751]But from a theoretical standpoint, Tesla came to doubt the value ofelectromagnetic waves passing through the ether or atmosphere. Here he lookedmore closely at the experiments in which his transmitter was connected to anantenna and to the ground (see Chapter 10 [019_Chapter019.xhtml]). In his mind,two things happened as vibratory energy flowed through his transmitter:electromagnetic waves radiated out from the antenna and a current passed intothe ground. As Maxwell had argued, the new electromagnetic waves and light waveswere the same, and hence, like light, these waves propagated in straight lines.But this meant that the waves traveled into space in all directions and awayfrom the receiver. “That energy which goes out in the form of rays,” remarkedTesla, “is … unrecoverable, hopelessly lost. You can operate a little[receiving] instrument by catching a billionth part of it, but except this, allgoes out into space never to return.”42 [029_BM029.xhtml#d752] Because so muchof the energy was wasted by the electromagnetic waves, it made little sense toTesla to investigate them. (What Tesla did not know at the time was thatelectromagnetic waves propagate through the earth’s atmosphere by bouncing offof a layer of charged particles in the ionosphere known as theKennelly-Heaviside layer. This layer was predicted in 1902 and detected in1924.)Instead of worrying about electromagnetic waves, Tesla decided to focus on theground current produced by the transmitter. After all, Tesla’s flash of insightduring the thunderstorm in Serbia in 1892 had been to try and harness theelectrical forces in the earth. Why not, wondered Tesla, have the transmittersend waves of current through the Earth to a receiver and then useelectromagnetic waves in the atmosphere for the return circuit? (See Figure 11.6[020_Chapter020.xhtml#fig11_6].) By using the ground current in this way, Teslabelieved more energy could be sent from the transmitter to the receiver.In making this decision, we see Tesla thinking like a maverick since the otherearly wireless pioneers—Hertz, Lodge, and Marconi—focused on transmittingelectromagnetic waves through the air. When, on occasion, these pioneersgrounded their equipment, they gave little thought to what might be done withthe ground current.43 [029_BM029.xhtml#d753] Just as Tesla had invented hisrevolutionary AC motor by reversing standard practice, now with wireless powerhe looked to get ahead by inverting the roles played by electromagnetic wavesand the ground current in his high-frequency apparatus. Just as in an AC motorhe had decided to have the magnetic field change in the rotor rather than in thestator, now he decided that the ground current should transmit energy and theelectromagnetic waves should simply serve as the return needed to complete thecircuit.image [Images/pg_226.jpg]FIGURE 11.6. Tesla’s vision of transmitting wireless power contrasted with hiscontemporaries in the 1890s.Diagram (a) depicts how most early investigators (such as Marconi) thought thatwireless communication would work. They assumed that the transmitter wouldgenerate electromagnetic waves that would be sent through the air to thereceiver. The circuit would be completed because both the receiver andtransmitter were grounded, and a return current would travel from the receiverback to the transmitter. Diagram (b) shows Tesla’s vision in which thetransmitter sent an oscillating current through the earth’s crust to thereceiver. The circuit was then completed by having electromagnetic waves flowthrough the atmosphere from the receiver back to the transmitter. As we will seein Chapter 12 [021_Chapter021.xhtml], Tesla later decided that the circuit fromthe receiver to the transmitter was completed by assuming that an electriccurrent could be conducted through the upper atmosphere.Of course, in many modern applications of radio—such as FM or communicating withaircraft—the transmitter and receiver circuits do not need to be grounded. Ininsisting on a complete circuit through the Earth and returning through theatmosphere, Tesla reveals here that his thinking was based more onnineteenth-century practices in power and telegraphic engineering (whichemphasized complete circuits) and not on the electromagnetic theory then beingdeveloped by the Maxwellians (see Chapter 6 [015_Chapter015.xhtml]) that iswidely accepted today. Thinking like a maverick has advantages anddisadvantages.Having decided to maximize the ground current and minimize the electromagneticwaves radiating from his apparatus, Tesla now adjusted the basic elements in hiscircuits, the capacitance of the capacitors and the inductance produced by thecoils. In order to get a large ground current and minimum energy inelectromagnetic waves, Tesla found it best to use a very large inductance and avery small capacitance in his transmitting circuit.44 [029_BM029.xhtml#d754]In his first experiment with ground currents, Tesla used a tall, cone-shapedcoil powered by a high-frequency current from an alternator and a bank ofcondensers. While one terminal of the coil was grounded, the other was left freein space. When the power was turned on, marvelous “purple streamers ofelectricity [were] thus elicited from the earth and [poured] out to the ambientair” (Figure 11.7 [020_Chapter020.xhtml#fig11_7]).45 [029_BM029.xhtml#d755]But what caused this outpouring of electrical streamers? For Tesla, they wereevidence that he was tapping the earth’s electrical energy. If this was thecase, then rather than simply sending a current from one point to another on theearth’s surface, might it be possible to transmit power by using resonance? Bypumping electrical oscillations into the ground at the earth’s resonantfrequency, Tesla thought he might be able to broadcast power around the entireplanet. According to Martin, Tesla explained this grand vision by using a vividmetaphor: “With this coil [Tesla] does actually what one would be doing with apump forcing air into an elastic football. At each alternate stroke the ballwould expand and contract. But it is evident that such a ball, if filled withair, would, when suddenly expanded or contracted, vibrate at its own rate. Nowif the strokes of the pump be so timed that they are in harmony with theindividual vibrations of the ball, an intense vibration or surging will beobtained.”46 [029_BM029.xhtml#d756] Here Tesla realized the idea of a “sensitivetrigger” that had come to him during the thunderstorm: a small force, properlyapplied, could be used to harness the tremendous forces of the earth. Teslabelieved that he would not need to pump huge amounts of electrical energy intothe earth; only a small amount was needed, at the right frequency, to serve asthe trigger, and resonance would do the rest. With the whole Earth pulsing likehis metaphorical football, Tesla was confident that he could annihilate distanceand send power and messages around the world.image [Images/pg_228.jpg]FIGURE 11.7. “Tesla coil for ascertaining and discharging the electricity of theEarth.The Streamers at [the] top of the coil are of purple hue, and in form resemblefilaments of seaweed. The effect of mass being caused by prolonged exposure offlash-light negative.”From TCM, “Tesla’s Oscillator and Other Inventions,” The Century Magazine49:916–33 (April 1895), Fig. 15.For Tesla, it was a sublime moment to see the purple streamers coming off hiscoil, combining intellectual satisfaction with the opportunity to change humanexistence. “[O]ne can imagine the pleasure which the investigator [i.e., Tesla]feels when thus rewarded by unique phenomena,” wrote Martin.After searching with patient toil for two or three years after a resultcalculated in advance, he is compensated by being able to witness a mostmagnificent display of fiery streams and lightning discharges breaking out fromthe tip of the wire with the roar of a gas-well. Aside from their deepscientific import and their wondrous fascination as a spectacle, such effectspoint to many new realizations making for the higher welfare of the human race.The transmission of power and intelligence is but one thing: the modification ofclimatic conditions may be another. Perchance we shall “call up” Mars in thisway some day, the electrical charge of both planets being utilized in signals.47[029_BM029.xhtml#d757]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVELOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVES(1895–1898)ON THE EDGE AND INTO THE DEPRESSIONAs Tesla’s public persona grew during the 1890s, so did his social circle. Alongwith T. Commerford Martin and the Johnsons, he could now count on Mark Twain andJoseph Jefferson as friends, but another new acquaintance was the architectStanford White. The son of a Shakespeare scholar, White studied architectureunder Henry H. Richardson. In 1879 he joined Charles Follen McKim and WilliamRutherford Mead to form what became one of the most famous firms in Americanarchitectural history. Drawing on the Beaux Arts movement, McKim, Mead, andWhite designed many of the most important public buildings of their era. White’sown masterpieces included the Washington Square Arch, the second Madison SquareGarden, the Boston Public Library, and the restoration of the Rotunda at theUniversity of Virginia. White designed houses for the very rich that includednot only their “cottages” at Newport, Rhode Island, but also Fifth Avenuemansions of the Vanderbilts and Astors.1 [029_BM029.xhtml#d758]Another of White’s projects was the main power plant at Niagara, and so it islikely that Edward Dean Adams introduced White to Tesla. The architect and theinventor became good friends, and in 1894 White invited Tesla to join his club,The Players, on Gramercy Park. Founded by the actor Edwin Booth in 1888, ThePlayers combined people in the arts—actors, writers, sculptors, architects, andpainters—with bankers, lawyers, and businessmen. By having artists socializewith members of the business world, Booth hoped to raise the standing of thearts in New York society. When White moved to a townhouse on Gramercy Park in1892, The Players became his favorite club, and so it is not surprising thatWhite asked Tesla to join: “Will you not let me put you up for membership? It isan inexpensive club and the character of men I think you would like, and I knowit would give me the greatest pleasure to meet you there now and then.” Teslaimmediately accepted and White nominated him, telling the club that “NikolaTesla is one of the great geniuses and most remarkable men who have ever hadanything to do with electricity.”2 [029_BM029.xhtml#d759]The Players became a regular haunt for Tesla, and he would drop by to see MarkTwain, who was a member, as well as Joseph Jefferson, who succeeded Booth as theclub’s president. Tesla also continued to socialize with White; in February1895, for instance, White invited him “for a little supper for the artist, NedAbbey, in my room in the Tower.” A few weeks later, Tesla returned theinvitation by doing a demonstration in his South Fifth Avenue laboratory forWhite, his wife, and his son, Lawrence.3 [029_BM029.xhtml#d760]In visiting Tesla’s lab, White would have seen that the Wizard was engaged infour main lines of research. One was his oscillator (i.e., the combination steamengine and electric generator), which Tesla regarded “as a practically perfectedmachine, but which of course, suggests many new lines of thought every day.” Asecond was his new wireless lighting system while a third “was the transmissionof intelligence any distance without wires. A fourth, which is an ever presentproblem for every thinking electrician touches on the nature of electricity.”4[029_BM029.xhtml#d761]But in pursuing four lines of research at once, Tesla was wearing himself out,and during his visit in March 1895 White would have seen an overworked inventor.Interviewing Tesla about the same time, a reporter described him in thefollowing manner: “I was a trifle shocked the first time I saw Nikola Tesla ashe suddenly appeared before me … and sank into a chair seemingly in a state ofutter dejection. Tall, straight, gaunt, and sinewy of frame like a true Slav,with clear blue eyes and small, mobile mouth fringed with a boyish mustache, helooked younger than his thirty-seven years. But what arrested my attentionchiefly at the moment was the pallid, drawn, and haggard appearance of the face.While scanning it closely I plainly read a tale of overwork and of tremendousmental strain that must soon reach the limits of human endurance.”Tesla was aware that he should rest, but as he explained to the reporter, hecould not stop working: “I would like to talk with you, my dear sir, he said,but I feel far from well to-day. I am completely worn out, in fact, and yet Icannot stop my work. These experiments of mine are so important, so beautiful,so fascinating, that I can hardly tear myself away from them to eat, and when Itry to sleep I think about them constantly. I expect that I shall go on until Ibreak down altogether.”5 [029_BM029.xhtml#d762]It was in this manic state that Tesla received a terrible emotional blow. At2:30 a.m. on 13 March 1895, a fire broke out in the building containing hislaboratory. The fire gutted 33–35 South Fifth and Tesla lost everything. “In asingle night,” reported the New York Herald, “the fruits of ten years of toiland research were swept away. The web of a thousand wires which at his biddingthrilled with life had been twisted by fire into a tangled skein. Machines, tothe perfection of which he gave all that was best of a master mind are nowshapeless things, and vessels which contained the results of patient experimentare heaps of pot sherds.” Along with his apparatus, Tesla lost all his notes andpapers, as he had just brought them to the laboratory to start organizing them.Tesla estimated that he had invested $80,000 to $100,000 in the laboratory, and,regrettably, he had no fire insurance.6 [029_BM029.xhtml#d763]In response to the disaster, Tesla became severely depressed: “Utterlydisheartened and broken in spirit, Nicola Tesla, one of the world’s greatestelectricians, returned to his rooms in the Gerlach yesterday morning and took tohis bed. He has not risen since. He lies there, half sleeping, half waking. Heis completely prostrated.”7 [029_BM029.xhtml#d764] Knowing his delicate mentalstate, Tesla’s friends feared for his well-being. When she had not heard fromhim for several days, Katharine Johnson wrote, “Today with the deepeningrealization of this disaster and consequently with increasing anxiety for you,my dear friend, I am even poorer in tears, and they cannot be sent in letters.Why will you not come to us now—perhaps we might help you, we have so much togive in sympathy.”8 [029_BM029.xhtml#d765]The newspapers portrayed Tesla’s loss as having both personal and publicsignificance. As Charles A. Dana said in the New York Sun, “The destruction ofNIKOLA TESLA’S workshop, with its wonderful contents, is something more than aprivate calamity. It is a misfortune to the whole world. It is not in any degreean exaggeration to say that the men living at this time who are more importantto the human race than this young gentleman, can be counted on the fingers ofone hand; perhaps on the thumb of one hand.”9 [029_BM029.xhtml#d766]In the days after the fire, Tesla returned to the wreckage and set his men towork to salvage anything they could. To the reporters, he put on a brave face,but his heart was not in the work. A few nights later Tesla dropped into ThePlayers, where he found the usual gathering of actors, musicians, and artists.“With quick and kind sympathy,” reported the New York Times, the group“immediately organized an impromptu ‘benefit concert’ for his solegratification, with an aggregation of talent that, had the public only knownabout it, would have given a substantial endowment for his new laboratory.”10[029_BM029.xhtml#d767]Deep in depression, Tesla felt numb yet knew he had to find his own way out: “Ihave been overwhelmed with generosity and sympathy this week, and feel thiskindness deeply, even if I can make no response,” he told the Electrical Review.“But I must carve my way through or over the mountain suddenly planted in frontof me.”11 [029_BM029.xhtml#d768]Tesla’s way through the mountain was electrotherapy.12 [029_BM029.xhtml#d769]During his earliest work with high-frequency AC, Tesla had noted how suchcurrents affected the body, and during his spectacular demonstrations, he mayhave observed how shocks altered his mood. Moreover, there was a tradition inpopular medicine in mid-nineteenth-century America of using electric shocks fromRuhmkorff coils to treat a variety of ailments; Elihu Thomson’s father, forinstance, took shocks in the 1860s as a medical treatment.13[029_BM029.xhtml#d770]Over the next few months Tesla gave himself regular shocks, probably using oneof his oscillating coils, in order to keep “from sinking into a state ofmelancholia.” “I was so blue and discouraged in those days,” he later told areporter, “that I don’t believe I could have borne up but for the regularelectric treatment which I administered to myself. You see, electricity putsinto the tired body just what it most needs—life force, nerve force. It’s agreat doctor, I can tell you, perhaps the greatest of all doctors.”14[029_BM029.xhtml#d771]As he pulled out of his depression, Tesla put himself on a regular schedule,hoping to prevent a relapse. “He is a man of very regular habits,” noted the NewYork Sun, “wherein he differs from Edison, who works fifty or seventy-five hoursat a stretch, sometimes longer, when he has on hand something that interestshim. Tesla is up every morning at 61/2 o’clock. He has a lot of gymnasticexercises that he goes through with regularity. He has a light breakfast andthen he loses little time getting to his work. He takes an hour for his luncheonin the middle of the day and the afternoon is devoted to hard work. He usuallyworks until 8 o’clock in the evening, but often it is until midnight.”15[029_BM029.xhtml#d772]INVESTIGATING X-RAYSWith his depression finally waning, Tesla rented a new laboratory on two floorsof a building at 46 East Houston Street in July 1895 (Figure 12.1[021_Chapter021.xhtml#fig12_1]). There he employed “a clerk who attends tovisitors, keeps away cranks, keeps a scrapbook, and sees that everybody who hasreal business with the inventor is provided with the latest copy of somescientific paper until Mr. Tesla is disengaged. He also has a dozen or moremechanics who are as loyal to him as Edison’s men are to him; but the nature ofhis work and the magnitude of the problems he sets for himself to solve do notpermit their rendering him the same sort of assistance that the Wizard’s [i.e.,Edison’s] men furnish to their employer.”16 [029_BM029.xhtml#d773]Since he lost all his apparatus in the fire, Tesla took his efforts in newdirections. While he continued to promote wireless lighting and the oscillatorto potential investors, he now placed more effort on developing his ideas forthe wireless transmission of power as well as two new areas, X-rays and radiocontrol.Realizing that investors and manufacturers were not interested in licensing orbuying the patents for his system of wireless lighting (see Chapter 11[020_Chapter020.xhtml]), Tesla shifted from promoting an entire system toemphasizing components. Through 1895 and 1896, he redesigned his oscillatingtransformer (what others were now calling a Tesla coil) into a compact devicethat could take power from existing electrical circuits and step it up to a highvoltage and high frequency. Tesla then used this improved oscillatingtransformer to power a new vacuum tube lamp, which he claimed gave out morelight and was more efficient than Edison’s incandescent lamps or the gas-filledtubes then being touted by D. McFarlane Moore. To demonstrate the power of hisnew lamp, Tesla posed for a portrait that now required only a two-secondexposure from this new light source (Figure 12.2[021_Chapter021.xhtml#fig12_2]). Taken by Tonnele & Company, the portrait showsTesla reading Maxwell’s Scientific Papers while seated in a chair given to himby Edward Dean Adams; in the background was a large spiral coil that Tesla wasusing in his wireless power experiments.17 [029_BM029.xhtml#d774]image [Images/pg_235.jpg]FIGURE 12.1. Tesla’s laboratory at East Houston Street. Note that the largespiral coil is visible in the back of the room. From NTM.image [Images/pg_236.jpg]FIGURE 12.2. “Tesla in His Laboratory—Portrait Obtained by an Exposure of TwoSeconds to the Light of a Single Vacuum Tube without Electrodes, Having a Volumeof about 90 Cubic Inches, Giving Approximately a Light of 250Candle-Power—Photographed by Tonnele & Co.”From “Tesla’s Important Advances,” Electrical Review, 20 May 1896, 263 in TC11:68, NTM.As he was working on these two components, however, Tesla also became excitedabout the recent discovery of X-rays. His involvement with X-rays began with twomissed opportunities. At the end of 1894, Tesla decided to investigate whetherhis lamps affected photographic plates in the same way as light coming from thesun or other sources of illumination. To do so, he sought the assistance ofDickenson Alley, a photographer employed by Tonnele & Company. Over a period ofseveral months they tried a great variety of phosphorescent lamps, Crookestubes, and vacuum bulbs with different kinds of electrodes. Since this was not amajor project, Tesla and Alley worked on it periodically, and Alley stored spareglass photographic plates in a corner of the laboratory. However, they noticedthat the unexposed plates had “unaccountable marks and defects” indicating thatthey had somehow been spoiled. Tesla wondered, in passing, if the plates mighthave been affected by cathode rays, which were a stream of charged particlesthat passed between the electrodes in some of his vacuum tubes when a voltagewas applied across the electrodes. Tesla had recently read reports about how aHungarian student of Heinrich Hertz, Philipp Lenard, was getting interestingresults using tubes with an aluminum window that allowed the rays to pass out ofthe tube. However, before he could follow up on this hunch, the laboratory fireoccurred and depression kept Tesla from working.18 [029_BM029.xhtml#d775]The second missed opportunity came a few months later. In 1895, Tesla wasdiscussing these photographic experiments with Edward Ringwood Hewitt, who wasthe son of the mayor of New York, Abraham Hewitt, and the brother of PeterCooper Hewitt, who would invent the mercury vapor lamp in 1902. Through hisbrother’s research, Edward was familiar with Crookes tubes, and in the course ofconversation Tesla and Edward decided to try taking some photographs using thesetubes as the light source. Perhaps knowing that Mark Twain had posed for asimilar photograph (see Figure 11.5 [020_Chapter020.xhtml#fig11_5]), Hewittarranged for Twain to come to the lab. Because the light coming from the Crookestube was weak, Twain had to sit still for a fifteen-minute exposure with hishead supported by a headrest; to keep Twain amused during the sitting, Mrs.Hewitt read to him. A few days later, Hewitt checked to see how the portrait hadturned out, and Tesla reported that the experiment had failed as the glassphotographic plate had somehow been spoiled.19 [029_BM029.xhtml#d776]Hewitt let the matter drop until he heard a few months later about the discoveryof X-rays. X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation produced when a streamof fast electrons hits a metal target in an evacuated glass tube. Located beyondultraviolet light on the electromagnetic spectrum, they were discovered by theGerman physicist Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen. Like Lenard, Roentgen wasinvestigating cathode rays, and in November 1895 he was surprised to find that abarium platinocyanide screen fluoresced in the presence of a Crookes tubeenclosed in a lightproof cardboard shield. Roentgen deduced that thefluorescence was caused by invisible radiation, which he termed X Strahlen, orX-rays, to indicate their unknown nature. In exploring this new phenomenon, hefound that various materials were transparent to the rays but that photographicplates were sensitive to them. Roentgen combined these two observations to makea shadow-gram of the bones in his wife’s hand. Roentgen announced his discoveryat a meeting of the Physical-Medical Society of Wurzburg in December, and newsof Roentgen’s X-rays spread quickly. By 6 January 1896, the New York Sunreported that Roentgen had discovered “the light that never was,” which couldphotograph hidden things such as bones inside a body.20 [029_BM029.xhtml#d777]Upon reading about Roentgen’s discovery, Hewitt rushed to Tesla’s laboratory andbegged to see the photographic plate they had taken a few months earlier. AsHewitt recounted,[Tesla] brought it out of the dark room and held it up to the light. There I sawthe picture of the circle of the lens, with the adjusting screw at the side—alsoround dots, which represented the metal wood screws in the front of the woodencamera.Tesla gave one look. Then he slammed the plate on the floor, breaking it into athousand pieces, exclaiming, “Damned fool! I never saw it.”21[029_BM029.xhtml#d778]What Tesla and Hewitt had missed was that the Geissler tube had produced notonly visible light but also invisible radiation—X-rays—that had spoiled theplate before the cap had even been taken off the lens and the exposure begun.Mark Twain had sat still for nothing and Tesla had missed making a majorscientific discovery. “Too late,” Tesla lamented, “I realized that my guidingspirit had again prompted me and that I had failed to comprehend his mysterioussigns.”22 [029_BM029.xhtml#d779]Miffed that he had failed to notice X-rays first, Tesla sought to make up forlost time. As he told the New York Times a few weeks later, he began hisexperiments “within half an hour after the news of Prof. Roentgen’s discoverywas cabled to this country.” Just as he had done when he had learned of Hertz’sexperiments with electromagnetic waves, Tesla now repeated Roentgen’sexperiments. Quickly noticing that other researchers were limited in theirefforts by only using low-powered Ruhmkorff coils or electrostatic generators topower their tubes, Tesla began powering his tube using his new compactoscillating transformer. By taking advantage of the higher voltages andfrequencies generated by this device, Tesla was able to produce more powerfulX-rays than many of his contemporaries could. “I am producing shadows at adistance of 40 feet. I repeat 40 feet and even more,” reported Tesla in March1896.23 [029_BM029.xhtml#d780] During the next few months, Tesla kept hisglassblower busy as he experimented with dozens of different tubes andcorresponded with Hewitt about ways of testing them.24 [029_BM029.xhtml#d781]With his powerful apparatus, Tesla concentrated on making the best possibleimages—which he called shadowgraphs—of parts of the human body. One of his firstshadowgraphs was the right shoulder of a man, showing the ribs, shoulder bones,and bones of the upper arm. Another image was a picture of a foot with a shoeon, and “every fold of the leather, trousers, stocking, etc., is visible, whilethe flesh and bones stand out sharply” (Figure 12.3[021_Chapter021.xhtml#fig12_3]). Undoubtedly aware that Edison had seen only“curvilinear murkiness” when he X-rayed the brain for William Randolph Hearst’sNew York Journal, Tesla secured an outline of the skull by exposing his own headfor twenty to forty minutes. During the exposure, Tesla reported, “there is atendency to sleep and the time seems to pass away quickly. There is a generalsoothing effect, and I have felt a sensation of warmth in the upper part of thehead.”25 [029_BM029.xhtml#d782]image [Images/pg_239.jpg]FIGURE 12.3. Shadowgraph made by Tesla of a human foot in a shoe in 1896. FromNTM. Like other early investigators, Tesla initially regarded X-rays as benign.However, both he and his assistants soon experienced eyestrain, headaches, andburns on the skin of their hands. At first Tesla attributed these injuries tothe ozone produced when running the tubes at high voltages, but he came torealize that the rays themselves were causing damage. Tesla was particularlyupset when “a dear and zealous assistant” suffered severe burns on his abdomenafter being exposed for five minutes to an X-ray tube positioned eleven inchesfrom his body. “Fortunately,” Tesla reported, “frequent warm baths, freeapplication of vaseline, cleaning and general bodily care soon repaired theravages of the destructive agent, and I breathed again freely.” Nevertheless, inhis later papers on X-rays, he recommended using a grounded aluminum shieldaround the X-ray tube, that people avoid getting too close to the tube, and thatexposure times be limited.26 [029_BM029.xhtml#d783]Through 1896 Tesla produced a steady stream of reports on his X-ray research notfor his friend Martin’s Electrical Engineer but for the rival ElectricalReview.27 [029_BM029.xhtml#d784] However, Tesla’s interest in X-rays soon waned.Initially he took up this topic because, by drawing on the skill he had acquiredin manipulating Crookes tubes, he would either make a further scientificdiscovery or quickly develop a new product. To be sure, he insisted that hiscompact oscillating transformer was ideal for powering X-ray tubes, but he didnot come up with a commercially viable X-ray tube. Instead, the firms that wereable to develop X-ray products—either power sources or tubes—were those likeGeneral Electric that had expertise in manufacturing incandescent lamps or smallscientific-instrument manufacturers that had the distribution network to reachscientists and medical doctors.28 [029_BM029.xhtml#d785] Hence Tesla probablydropped X-ray research when it became clear that he could not compete with thecompanies that were moving into this new field.I also suspect that Tesla stopped experimenting with X-rays because they did notadvance his evolving interests in wireless transmission. Tesla probably checkedout X-rays to see if they could be useful for transmitting power in the waysthat he had started to think about before the fire (see Chapter 11[020_Chapter020.xhtml]), and he moved on to new topics when these experimentsdid not contribute anything new.DEVELOPING RADIO-CONTROLLED BOATSThough X-rays did not contribute to his thinking about wireless power, Tesla wasalready working on a new project that did: the development of radio-controlledautomatons. While we might call these devices robots (a term the Czech writerKarel Čapek introduced in 1920), Tesla coined his own word for this new field:telautomatics.29 [029_BM029.xhtml#d786]Tesla’s interest in automata dates back to his childhood. As a boy, he sufferedfrom nightmares that he overcame by developing his willpower. Struck by the factthat the frightening visions were often the result of some external stimuli thathe could identify, Tesla concluded that all thoughts and emotions were theresult of outside factors and that the human organism was no more than a“self-propelling machine, the motions of which are governed by impressionsreceived through the eye.” His efforts to understand and control his intensevisions, as he explained in his autobiography, “led me finally to recognise thatI was but an automaton devoid of free will in thought and action and merelyresponsible to the forces of the environment.”30 [029_BM029.xhtml#d787] But ifhe were merely an automaton, wondered Tesla, why not build one as well?“The idea of constructing an automaton, to bear out my theory, presented itselfto me early,” Tesla recalled, but he did not take it up in earnest until he hadbegun to perfect his wireless inventions and realized that his receivers couldserve as surrogates for the eye or other sensory organs. As he explained in1898, “Endeavoring to construct a mechanical model resembling in its essential,material features the human body, I was led to combine a controlling device, ororgan sensitive to certain waves, with a body provided with propelling anddirecting mechanism, and the rest naturally followed.”31 [029_BM029.xhtml#d788]Tesla began working on a remotely controlled device in 1892, which, like hiswireless lamps, was controlled by electrical induction. These early contrivanceswere destroyed in the fire at his laboratory, and so after moving to HoustonStreet he fashioned some new prototypes with which he was able to make “morestriking demonstrations, in many instances actually transmitting the wholemotive energy to the devices instead of simply controlling the same from [a]distance.” Unfortunately, there are no descriptions of these early prototypes.32[029_BM029.xhtml#d789]image [Images/pg_242.jpg]FIGURE 12.4. Diagram showing interior of Tesla’s first radio-controlled boat in1898.The boat received signals via the antenna (E′) that were delivered to thecoherer (c) just below the antenna. The signals were then processed by the diskmechanism in the stern, marked by (L). Depending on the number of times thesignal was interrupted, the disk (L) advanced a certain number of “clicks” whichin turn regulated the current delivered to the motor (F) that controlled therudder (F′). The boat was propelled by another motor (D) and the current to themotors was provided by storage batteries (E). The signal lamps are marked by qand the space marked B was where an explosive charge could be carried.From NT, “Method of and Apparatus for Controlling Mechanism of Moving Vessels orVehicles,” US Patent 613,809 (filed 1 July 1898, granted 8 Nov. 1898), Figure 2.In 1897 Tesla began building a test model with the help of one of hisassistants, Raphael Netter. While he anticipated that his control mechanismscould be used in any kind of vehicle or flying machine, he chose to build themodel in the form of a boat in response to the naval armaments race then underway.33 [029_BM029.xhtml#d790] In 1889 the dominant naval power, Britain, haddecided that it should build a new fleet of battleships superior to the combinedfleets of its rivals, France and Russia. As these three powers raced to buildnew ships, the United States, Germany, Spain, and Japan followed suit in orderto protect themselves.34 [029_BM029.xhtml#d791] Powered by new triple-expansionsteam engines and protected by hardened steel armor, this new generation ofbattleships carried main batteries of twelve-inch guns in turrets supported byadditional batteries of smaller guns. Fast, well-protected, and bristling withweapons, these new warships looked as if they were invincible.35[029_BM029.xhtml#d792]To attack these new battleships, Tesla designed an unmanned torpedo boat thatcould carry an explosive charge and be directed by electromagnetic signals(Figures 12.4 [021_Chapter021.xhtml#fig12_4] and 12.5[021_Chapter021.xhtml#fig12_5]). One visitor to the Houston Street laboratoryoffered the following description of the boat and how Tesla demonstrated it:Elevated on stocks on a table in the centre of the laboratory stood a model of ascrew-propelled craft, about four feet long and somewhat disproportionately wideand deep. Mr. Tesla explained that it was merely a working model which he hadmade in order to exhibit to President McKinley, and that no attempt had beenmade to follow the usual sharp lines of a torpedo boat. The deck was slightlyarched and surmounted by three slender standards, the centre one beingconsiderably higher than the other two, which carried small incandescent bulbs,a third bulb being fixed at the bow.The keel consisted of a massive copper plate, the propeller and rudder being intheir usual positions. Mr. Tesla explained that the boat contained thepropelling machinery, consisting of an electric motor actuated by a storagebattery in the hold, another motor to actuate the rudder and the delicatemechanism which performs the function of receiving through the central standardthe electric impulses sent through the atmosphere from the distant operatingstation, which set in motion the propelling and steering motors, and throughthem light or extinguish the electric bulbs and fire the exploding charge in thechamber of the bow in response to signals sent by the operator.image [Images/pg_244.jpg]FIGURE 12.5. Diagram showing Tesla’s radio-controlled boat and transmitter.S is a generator producing continuous electromagnetic waves and is connected toan antenna. To its left is the control box with a lever (T). This lever could berotated in one direction, making contact with contacts u, t’, u’, and t.From NT, “Method of and Apparatus for Controlling Mechanism of Moving Vessels orVehicles,” US Patent 613,809 (filed 1 July 1898, granted 8 Nov. 1898), Figure 9.“Now watch,” said the inventor, and going to a table on the other side of theroom on which lay a little switchbox, about five inches square, he gave thelever a sharp turn. Instantly the little bronze propeller began to revolve at afurious rate. “Now I will send the boat to starboard,” he said, and anotherquick movement of the lever sent the helm sharp over, and another movementturned it as rapidly back again. At another signal the screw stopped andreversed.36 [029_BM029.xhtml#d793]To control this boat, Tesla had the transmitter generate a continuouselectromagnetic wave at one frequency, which the boat detected using a cohererthat had been invented in 1890 by the French physicist Édouard Branly andsubsequently improved by Oliver Lodge. At the transmitter, Tesla could rotatethe lever, touching from one of four contacts; in doing so, he would interruptthe signal being sent to the boat. Inside the boat, these interruptions caused aspecial disk to rotate and engage different contacts on the surface of the disk,thus activating the rudder and the motor to the propeller (Figure 12.4[021_Chapter021.xhtml#fig12_4]). For instance, rotating the transmitter’s leverto a first contact might cause the rudder to turn right, moving it to the nextcontact would stop the rudder turning and start the propeller, and shifting thelever to the third contact would turn the propeller to the left. Because thecontacts controlling the rudder and propeller were placed in a specific sequenceon the disk, Tesla could not pick one function and directly execute it; instead,he had to move the lever from contact to contact in order to get the boat to dowhat he wanted. Hence, in the modern technical sense, Tesla’s first boat was not“remote-controlled” but “radio-controlled,” as the former term describessituations in which different signals are sent to execute different functions.37[029_BM029.xhtml#d794]Despite this distinction, Tesla’s radio-controlled boat was a remarkableachievement. Working around the limitation of sending signals at only onefrequency, Tesla came up with an ingenious electrome-chanical solution. Themechanism found in this invention is among the most sophisticated devices Teslacreated in his career. And up to 1897, no one had conceived of usingelectromagnetic waves to operate an unmanned vehicle; Tesla introduced the ideainto popular culture and engineering practice.38 [029_BM029.xhtml#d795]Tesla’s inspiration for this solution came from telegraphy. During the latenineteenth century, telegraphy was used not only for sending telegrams betweencities but also for requesting messenger boys, the police, or the firedepartment using what was called a district telegraph. Seeking a reliablemechanism for his boat, Tesla drew on the circuitry typically used in districtcall boxes:How such an apparently complicated mechanism can be operated and controlled at adistance of miles is no mystery. It is as simple as the messenger call [box] tobe found in almost any office. This is a little metal box with a lever on theoutside. By moving the crank to a certain point it gives vibrating sounds andsprings back into position, and its momentary buzzing calls a messenger. Butmove this same crank a third further around the dial and it buzzes still longer,and pretty soon a policeman appears, summoned by its mysterious call. Again,move the crank this time to the farthest limit of the circle and scarcely hasits more prolonged hum of recoil sounded when the city fire apparatus dashes upto your place at its call.Now, my device for controlling the motion of a distant submarine boat is exactlysimilar. Only I need no connecting wires between my switchboard and the distantsubmarine boat, for I make use of the now well-known principle of wirelesstelegraphy.39 [029_BM029.xhtml#d796]Confident that he had a great invention on his hands, Tesla began drafting apatent application for his radio-controlled boat in 1897. At the same time, hedelighted in demonstrating the boat in his laboratory “to visitors who neverceased to wonder at the performances.” According to one source, these visitorsincluded J. P. Morgan, William K. Vanderbilt, John Hays Hammond Sr., and CharlesCheever. These private demonstrations prompted one visitor, the successfulmining engineer John Hays Hammond, to invest $10,000 in the project.40[029_BM029.xhtml#d797]While Tesla was working on his radio-controlled boat, the United States declaredwar on Spain in April 1898, and consequently there was a great deal ofexcitement about new weapons for attacking battleships. Anxious to trade on thewartime hysteria, another wireless entrepreneur, W. J. Clarke of the UnitedStates Electrical Supply Company, arranged for a demonstration of his company’sequipment at the Electrical Exhibition taking place at Madison Square Garden inMay. His demonstration featured a radio-controlled underwater mine that couldblow up a ship. “By touching an instrument placed in the southern gallery [ofthe exhibition],” reported the New York Times, “a miniature Spanish cruiseranchored in the fountain lake on the lower floor, 90 feet away, was blown intothe air, together with a considerable quantity of water, which fell on those whowere not quick enough in getting out of the way.” This dramatic demonstrationproved to be popular, and Clarke was soon repeating it four times a day.41[029_BM029.xhtml#d798]As the war with Spain continued, Tesla finished and filed his patent applicationfor the boat in July 1898. Even though he had begun to develop more advancedcircuitry using “the joint action of several circuits” (discussed later in thechapter), Tesla’s attorney, Parker Page, advised him to emphasize how heemployed a single frequency since they had not yet drafted patents protectingthe more sophisticated circuits. Because the examiners in the Patent Officecould not believe what Tesla claimed in his application, the examiner-in-chiefcame to New York to see for himself how the boat operated. Satisfied, he letTesla’s patent for the boat issue in November 1898.42 [029_BM029.xhtml#d799]ABOLISHING WAR, ENDING A FRIENDSHIPWith a patent in hand, Tesla now cranked up the publicity, and stories soonappeared in the technical press and popular newspapers about hisradio-controlled boat (see Figure 13.11 [022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_11]). Ratherthan talk just about how his boat could destroy battleships, though, Teslaboldly insisted that his boat would bring about an end to war. As he told theNew York Herald,War will cease to be possible when all the world knows to-morrow that the mostfeeble of nations can supply itself immediately with a weapon which will renderits coast secure and its ports impregnable to the as-saults of the unitedarmadas of the world. Battle ships will cease to be built, and the mightiestarmorclads and the most tremendous artillery afloat will be of no more use thanso much scrap iron.…Imagine, if you can … what an irresistible instrument of destruction we have ina torpedo boat thus [remotely] controlled, which we can operate day or night onthe surface or below it, and from any distance that may be desired. A ship thusassailed would have no possibility of escape.…But I have no desire that my fame should rest on the invention of a merelydestructive device, no matter how terrible. I prefer to be remembered as theinventor who succeeded in abolishing war.43 [029_BM029.xhtml#d800]Tesla was confident that all nations—both feeble and mighty—would be interestedin his invention. As he informed Page in December 1898, “I have received from anumber of countries propositions for the rights on my invention for controllingthe movements and operation of bodies from a distance, and I am generallyrequested to name the price. In view of this it is very desirable for me thatthe patents for the chief European countries should be applied for withoutdelay.” Over the next year, Page filed patents on the radio-controlled boat inthirteen countries.44 [029_BM029.xhtml#d801]Hearing that Tesla was securing foreign patents for the boat, Mark Twain pennedhim a quick letter from Europe:Have you Austrian & English patents on that destructive terror which you havebeen inventing?—& if so, won’t you set a price upon them & commission me to sellthem? I know cabinet ministers of both countries—& of Germany, too; likewiseWilliam II.…Here in the hotel the other night when some interested men were discussing meansto persuade the nations to join with the Czar & disarm, I advised them to seeksomething more sure than disarmament by perishable paper contract—invite thegreat inventors to contrive something against which fleets and armies would behelpless & thus make war thenceforth impossible. I did not suspect that you werealready attending to that, & getting ready to introduce into the earth permanentpeace & disarmament in a practical & mandatory way.45 [029_BM029.xhtml#d802]While the Electrical Review predicted that Tesla’s radio-controlled boat wouldbecome one of the “most potent factors in the advance of civilisation ofmankind,” Tesla was surprised when this invention was sharply criticized by hisprofessional colleagues who failed to see its novelty or practicality. AsPrinceton’s professor of physics Cyrus F. Brackett complained, “There is nothingnew about this. The theory is perfect, but the application is absurd.… Do yousuppose that in the din of battle it would be possible to put into executionthose minute and carefully adjusted mechanical experiments, all of which arepre-supposed by his theory, which require the quiet of an uninterruptedlaboratory to work successfully?” More unkind words came from Amos Dolbear atTufts College: “The announcement is most amazing, and coming as it does fromTesla, scientists are all the more chary about accepting it. During the last sixyears he has made so many startling announcements and has performed so few ofhis promises that he is getting to be like the man who called ‘Wolf! wolf!’until no one listened to him. Mr. Tesla has failed so often before that there isno call to believe these things until he really does them. Meantime, we are allwaiting with much patience and without solicitude. We will believe them whenthey are done.”46 [029_BM029.xhtml#d803]But the harshest criticism came from his friend T. Commerford Martin at theElectrical Engineer. Worried that his journal was losing market share andundoubtedly upset that Tesla was now sending material to the rival ElectricalReview, Martin openly attacked Tesla in a November 1898 editorial.47[029_BM029.xhtml#d804] Not only had Tesla not finished up inventions such as thesteam-powered oscillator (which Martin now thought was destined for the scrapheap), Martin scornfully complained that there was nothing new in Tesla’sradio-controlled boat and that he had simply appropriated the idea from Clarke’sdemonstration: “Last spring the ability to explode floating torpedoes underships from a distance without any wires was brilliantly demonstrated at MadisonSquare Garden several times a day for a month. Taking that idea, Mr. Tesla hasapplied the same principle to the electro-mechanical steering of torpedoes.” Toadd injury to insult, Martin rushed into print, without Tesla’s permission, apaper he had recently given at the American Electro-Therapeutic Association.48[029_BM029.xhtml#d805]Tesla was furious that Martin published his paper but even more so that heimpugned his honesty. In response, Tesla called Martin’s attention not to hisaccomplishments but to his honor and academic degrees:Your editorial comment would not concern me in the least, were it not my duty totake note of it. On more than one occasion you have offended me, but in myqualities both as a Christian and philosopher I have always forgiven you andonly pitied you for your errors. This time, though, your offence is graver thanprevious ones, for you have dared to cast a shadow on my honor.No doubt you must have in your possession, from the illustrious men [i.e.,Brackett and Dolbear] whom you quote, tangible proofs in support of yourstatement reflecting on my honesty. Being a bearer of great honors from a numberof American universities, it is my duty, in view of the slur cast upon them, toexact from you that in your next issue you produce these, together with thisletter which in justice to myself, I am forwarding to other electrical journals.In the absence of such proofs, which would put me in the position to seekredress elsewhere, I require that, together with the preceding, you publishinstead a complete and humble apology for your insulting remark which reflectson me as well as on those who honor me.49 [029_BM029.xhtml#d806]In the next issue of Electrical Engineer, Martin published Tesla’s letter aswell as the “proofs” that Tesla had demanded. However, Martin opened with ahighly revealing comment:One of the foremost electrical inventors of this country, whose name is knownaround the world, has been kind enough to say that The Electrical Engineer madeMr. Tesla. This is an attribution that we naturally put aside, for it is a man’sown work that makes or unmakes him, but we do plead guilty to the fact that forthese ten years past we have done whatever mortals could do to bring Mr. Teslaforward and secure for him the recognition that was duly his. Not only in thecolumns of this and other journals, but in magazines and books we have strivenwith all the ability we possessed to explain Mr. Tesla’s ideas. The record isbefore all men. If there is a line or a word in it that seeks to do Mr. Tesla“serious injury,” who says we have ever in word or deed or thought tried to doMr. Tesla any sort of injury, lies.Within the last year or two Mr. Tesla has, it seems to us, gone far beyond thepossible in the ideas he has put forth, and he has to-day behind him a longtrail of beautiful but unfinished inventions. By mild criticism and milderbanter, not being able to lend Mr. Tesla the cordial support of earlier years ofreal achievement, we have only very lately endeavored to express our doubts andto urge him to the completion of some one of the many desirable or novel thingspromised. We believe this to be true friendship.50 [029_BM029.xhtml#d807]From Tesla’s perspective, however, constructive criticism was not something thathe wanted to hear from his friends, and as a result of this episode, Tesla andMartin went their separate ways.While he was feuding with Martin in the columns of the Electrical Engineer,Tesla had begun work on a second and larger (six-foot-long) radio-controlledboat. In particular, he had become worried about security—that his boat shouldrespond only to signals from his transmitter. Tesla came to this conclusion bythinking about the boat, the automaton, as being like a person:[T]he automaton should respond only to an individual call, as a person respondsto a name. Such considerations led me to conclude that the sensitive device ofthe machine should correspond to the ear rather than the eye of a human being,for in this case its actions could be controlled irrespective of interveningobstacles, regardless of its position relative to the distant controllingapparatus, and, last, but not least, it would remain deaf and unresponsive, likea faithful servant, to all calls but that of its master. And to get the servant to be faithful to his master, Tesla turned his attentionback to the problem of tuning: “I attained the result aimed at by means of anelectric circuit placed within the boat, and adjusted, or ‘tuned,’ exactly toelectrical vibrations of the proper kind transmitted to it from a distant‘electrical oscillator.’ This circuit, in responding, however feebly, to thetransmitted vibrations, affected magnets and other contrivances, through themedium of which were controlled the movements of the propeller and rudder, andalso the operations of numerous other appliances.”51 [029_BM029.xhtml#d808]But how was he going to make sure that his boat responded only to his signals?As a solution, Tesla borrowed an idea he had been using in his wireless lightingdemonstrations. Much to Tesla’s annoyance, visitors to Houston Street oftenpointed out that several lamps lit up even though he wanted only one lamp torespond to his oscillating transformer. To overcome this problem, Tesla had hisoscillator generate several different frequencies and then tuned the lamps sothat they had to receive a combination of two frequencies before they wouldlight up.52 [029_BM029.xhtml#d809]Tesla now applied this technique to his second boat, and in the laboratory hedevised several means for transmitting two signals to the boat:I did this in two ways: either by placing, in the inside of the boat, twocircuits which I tuned and combined so as to cause the operation of thecontrolling mechanism when both of these circuits were energized by theirrespective vibrations which were passed through the cables around the room[i.e., the primary of his oscillating transformer] … or, in another way, byusing two coils and connecting one end of each to the ground and the other to ametal plate or a bundle of wires [which would have functioned as two separateantennas] and then exciting them, either by means of the large coil in the formof a spiral [visible in Figures 12.1 [021_Chapter021.xhtml#fig12_1] and 12.2[021_Chapter021.xhtml#fig12_2]], … or by two circuits which were improvised oradopted for the experiment.53 [029_BM029.xhtml#d810]With this technique, Tesla realized that he was not limited to using just twofrequencies but that he could generate dozens of frequencies and use variouscombinations to individually control multiple vessels. Hence he envisioned thatone or several operators might simultaneously direct fifty or one hundredvessels through differently tuned transmitters and receivers.54[029_BM029.xhtml#d811]Although Tesla initially promised “to exhibit a model of a torpedo boat at the[upcoming] Paris Exposition and direct all its movements from my office in NewYork” (Figure 12.6 [021_Chapter021.xhtml#fig12_6]), he instead demonstrated thesecond boat to members of the Chicago Commercial Club in May 1899. When thedistinguished guests arrived to hear his lecture, they were startled to see anartificial lake in the middle of the auditorium, and in the lake was Tesla’sboat. Ever the master showman, Tesla invited the crowd to shout out questionsand his automaton would answer them by flashing its lights, shifting the rudder,or setting off exploding cartridges. “This was considered magic at the time,”Tesla recalled, “but was extremely simple, for it was myself who gave thereplies by means of the device.” In the lecture that followed, Tesla describedhow he had conceived of this automaton and emphasized its potential to abolishwar. Reflecting on the fact that the boat seemed almost to be alive, Teslaphilosophized at some length about the nature of human thought, life, anddeath.55 [029_BM029.xhtml#d812]image [Images/pg_252.jpg]FIGURE 12.6. Newspaper sketch showing how Tesla planned to demonstrate hisradio-controlled boat at the Paris Exposition.While Tesla (left) sent signals from his laboratory in New York, the audience(right) would watch the boat maneuver in a tank in Paris.From “Tesla Declares He Will Abolish War,” New York Herald, 8 Nov. 1898, in TC13:138–40, on 139.WHY DID TESLA NEVER MARRY?From 1896 to 1898, as Tesla threw himself into his work with X-rays and theradio-controlled boat, he still had bouts of melancholy. During a trip in July1896 to Niagara, Tesla told a reporter, “I came to Niagara Falls to inspect thegreat power plant and because I thought the change would bring me needed rest. Ihave been for some time in poor health, almost worn out, and I am now trying toget away from my work for a brief spell.”56 [029_BM029.xhtml#d813]A few weeks later, another reporter came upon Tesla slumped in a café at a latehour, looking haggard and tired (Figure 12.7 [021_Chapter021.xhtml#fig12_7]). “Iam afraid,” Tesla began, “that you won’t find me a pleasant companion tonight.The fact is, I was almost killed today.” Despite the precautions he took duringhis experiments, he had just received a shock of 3.5 million volts from one ofhis machines. “The spark jumped three feet through the air,” said Tesla, “andstruck me here on the right shoulder. I tell you it made me feel dizzy. If myassistant had not turned off the current instantly it might have been the end ofme. As it was, I have to show for it a queer mark on my right breast where thecurrent struck in and a burned heel in one of my socks where it left my body. Ofcourse the volume of current was exceedingly small, otherwise it must have beenfatal.”The reporter went on to ask Tesla if he was frequently depressed. “Perhaps notoften,” Tesla replied. “Every man of artistic temperament has relapsed from thegreat enthusiasms that buoy him up and sweep him forward. In the main my life isvery happy, happier than any life I can conceive of.” Tesla understood that somemelancholy was the price of experiencing the exhilaration of invention, and hetold his interviewer that “I do not think there is any thrill that can gothrough the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creationof the brain unfolding to success.… Such emotions make a man forget food, sleep,friends, love, everything.”image [Images/pg_254.jpg]FIGURE 12.7. Undated pencil sketch of Tesla at a café. From NTM.Finding Tesla in a receptive mood, the reporter followed up with a riskypersonal question. Knowing that Tesla was a bachelor, he asked the Wizard aboutmarriage. Was marriage suitable for persons of artistic temperament? Thinkingfor a moment, Tesla answered, “For an artist, yes; for a musician, yes; for awriter, yes; but for an inventor, no. The first three must gain inspiration froma woman’s influence and be led by their love to finer achievement, but aninventor has so intense a nature with so much in it of [a] wild, passionatequality, that in giving himself to a woman he might love, he would giveeverything, and so take everything from his chosen field. I do not think you canname many great inventions that have been made by married men [emphasis added].”After giving his answer, Tesla hesitated and concluded the interview, remarking,“It’s a pity too, for sometimes we feel so lonely.”57 [029_BM029.xhtml#d814]Over the next few weeks, both the tabloids and engineering papers puzzled overTesla’s explanation, as they thought it an “abnormal emotional condition” thathe did not wish to marry. Since then, Tesla’s biographers have continued towonder about the Wizard’s celibacy. “Tesla tried to convince the world that hehad succeeded in eliminating love and romance from his life,” noted biographerJohn O’Neill, “but he did not succeed. That failure … is the story of the secretchapter of Tesla’s life.”58 [029_BM029.xhtml#d815]Though we may never know exactly why Tesla never married, the existing sourcessuggest several possible explanations. The first is, quite simply, that Teslawas more attracted to men than women.With regard to women, it is clear that Tesla had a complex attitude toward them.At times, he put them on a pedestal, and in his later years he wrote populararticles suggesting that women might well be the superior sex. At other times hewas clearly shy, even fearful, around women, especially when he was a young man.As he told a Serbian reporter in 1927, “I have never touched a woman. As astudent, and while vacationing at my parents’ home in Lika, I fell in love withone girl. She was tall, beautiful, and had extraordinary understandable eyes.”Similarly, Martin intimated to Katharine Johnson in 1894 that he feared thatTesla “will go in the delusion that woman is generically a Delilah who wouldshear him of his locks. If you can manage it, I believe it would be a goodscheme to have that Doctor get hold of him.… My prescription is a weekly lecturefrom Mrs. RUJ.”59 [029_BM029.xhtml#d816]Mrs. RUJ seems to have had some positive impact on the Wizard, as he learned toenjoy interacting with society women at the Johnsons’ home and while out on thetown. Among the women with whom Tesla socialized with were Mrs. John JacobAstor, Mrs. Clarence McKay, the heiress Flora Dodge, Teddy Roosevelt’s sisterCorinne Robinson, and J. P. Morgan’s daughter Anne. Over time, Tesla becamesufficiently comfortable in talking to such women that he would approach themfor money to support his inventions (see Chapter 15 [024_Chapter024.xhtml]).Nevertheless, Tesla did not develop a deep relationship with any of these women.According to one female friend, the playwright Marguerite Merington, Tesla neverwent out with any women except for her, and one wonders if she might beboasting. As John O’Neill told Leland Anderson in the 1950s, “You can therefore,disregard any story you may hear from femmes that Tesla was interested in them.They were all double duds to him. He always treated them with the greatestrespect. He did, however, have a mother-fixation, a situation that is quiteunderstandable.”60 [029_BM029.xhtml#d817]In contrast to his relationships with women, Tesla was clearly attracted to men.As we saw earlier, Tesla found Anthony Szigeti to be physically attractive, theybecame close friends, and Szigeti followed Tesla from Budapest to Paris and onto New York. Sometime in 1891, Szigeti left and Tesla was deeply hurt. A fewyears later, Tesla befriended a young college graduate, Emile Smith, who wasinterested in engineering and seeking a position at the Westinghouse Company.Sadly, Smith died from typhoid fever only a few months after going toPittsburgh, and one of Tesla’s former colleagues wrote him about Smith, saying,“As he was a personal friend of yours I thought perhaps you would be interestedin hearing of his death.”61 [029_BM029.xhtml#d818]One wonders if Tesla’s attraction to men was merely platonic or if it wasphysical as well. The only evidence that speaks to this issue comes from a 1956conversation that Leland Anderson had with Richard C. Sogge, a longtime memberof the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Sogge was glad that theinstitute was celebrating the centennial of Tesla’s birth that year and toldAnderson, “You know, it’s a very good thing that the Institute is honoring Teslain this way—it will go a long way toward diminishing his reputation forvoyeurism which was embarrassing to the older members. The stories of Tesla’ssexual episodes were at one time the talk of the Institute, and we didn’t knowhow to deal with it if the matter should somehow become publicized. You must beaware, of course, that he never went out with women.… Anyway, the older membersof the Institute are dying off so those stories will also die out eventually.”62[029_BM029.xhtml#d819] Sogge’s remarks may help explain why Tesla’s involvementwith the AIEE declined in the 1890s. After being elected vice president in1892–93, Tesla did not become president. He was only recognized by the institutefor his contributions in 1917 when he was named a fellow and received the EdisonMedal.63 [029_BM029.xhtml#d820]In terms of looking for clues about homosexuality in historical documents, onehas to keep in mind differences in the way language was used in the nineteenthcentury and today. To be sure, men in Victorian America often developed closeemotional friendships, and sometimes used romantic and sexual language that intwenty-first-century America would be reserved for heterosexual relationships;for instance, Stanford White included explicit sexual language and anatomicaldrawings in his correspondence with the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. 64[029_BM029.xhtml#d821] Moreover, since sexual degeneracy, like poverty, wasviewed as proof that the poor were inferior, middle-class individuals werecareful not to reveal anything that could be construed as unusual about theirsexual conduct.65 [029_BM029.xhtml#d822] Consequently, it is not necessarilyeasy to know how to read the surviving documents for clues about Tesla’s sexualorientation. To be sure, there is nothing in the scant material relating toSzigeti that indicates whether he and Tesla were lovers.In contrast, the story is more complicated with another of Tesla’s male friends,Richmond Pearson Hobson (1870–1937) (Figure 12.8[021_Chapter021.xhtml#fig12_8]). Born in Alabama, Hobson attended the U.S. NavalAcademy at Annapolis, where he was an outstanding student. However, finding himheadstrong and righteous, his fellow midshipmen refused to speak to him duringhis last two years at the academy. After graduation, Hobson was selected tobecome a naval constructor and spent several years studying naval architecturein Europe.When the Spanish-American War broke out, Hobson was assigned to duty withAdmiral William T. Sampson on the New York, and they sailed to Cuba to engagethe Spanish fleet in Santiago harbor. Hoping to bottle up the Spanish warshipsin the harbor, Sampson decided in June 1898 to scuttle the collier Merrimac atthe mouth of the harbor, and Hobson volunteered to lead this suicide mission.Hobson and his crew did sink the Merrimac, but not quite in the right location,and they were subsequently captured by the Spanish. However, the sunken ship didforce the Spanish fleet to have to maneuver slowly out of the harbor, and a fewweeks later Sampson’s ships were able to destroy each Spanish warship as ittried to escape. The Spanish released Hobson in July, and he returned to Americawhere he was heralded by the press as a war hero.66 [029_BM029.xhtml#d823]image [Images/pg_257.jpg]FIGURE 12.8. Richmond P. Hobson.From http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/Images/h00001/h00127.jpg[http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/Images/h00001/h00127.jpg].Ever on the lookout for fresh material for The Century Magazine, RobertUnderwood Johnson contacted Hobson shortly after his return to convince him towrite a book about the Merrimac mission.67 [029_BM029.xhtml#d824] In August 1898Johnson wrote the young lieutenant, inviting him to lunch and to meet Tesla: “Doyou know Tesla? If not, would you not enjoy going to his laboratory tomorrowwith me? He is a charming fellow and of course you have much in common. He isone of my best friends.”68 [029_BM029.xhtml#d825]Johnson must have known that Tesla would be drawn to this handsome war hero.According to his wife, Grizelda, Hobson was[a]lways physically fit muscularly. Powerful sloping shoulders and arms tomatch, deep chested, flat abdomen, heavy thighs powerfully muscled, powerfulwell formed calves. Physical power showed through his clothes. One look at himwould have caused a fighter to hesitate to pick a fight with him. On the otherhand, the great intellect which showed in his face and head, combined with agentle friendliness of expression reflecting his real character were anythingbut invitations to fight. In a bathing suit he could have posed as “Tarzan.” Hisentire make-up was suggestive of controlled power, mental, physical andspiritual.69 [029_BM029.xhtml#d826]Over the next few months, Tesla had the opportunity to meet Hobson at dinnersand parties with the Johnsons. Tesla took a liking to this naval officer, and hewrote Johnson in jest, “Remember, Luka, Hobson does not belong to the Johnsonsexclusively. I shall avenge myself on Mme. Filipov by introducing him to Mme.Kussner and somebody will be forgotten.”70 [029_BM029.xhtml#d827]Still a commissioned officer, Hobson was assigned to duty in Hong Kong andManila in late 1898 and so Tesla did not see much of his new friend. Once Hobsonreturned to the United States in September 1900, he was assigned to the BrooklynNavy Yard and then the Navy Department in Washington. Frequently dining withmutual friends in New York, Hobson and Tesla grew close, as illustrated by anundated note from Hobson:My very dear Tesla:Thank you very much for your thoughtful and lovely note. I have engaged you fordinner tomorrow with the Van Beurens.… They are great friends of mine & mybrother. Dinner is down for 7.30.…Now, my dear fellow, if you are doing nothing for the next ¾ of an hour comeover for a short tete a tete—I feel I have not seen half enough of you on thisvisit and I have so much to talk with you about—But if you have to get up early, of course do not think about it—Devotedly yours,RichmondAnd to celebrate the first day of the twentieth century (then regarded to havebegun in 1901, not 1900), Tesla wrote to Hobson:My dear Hobson,This my first and heartiest greeting today is for you.On the new page of human history just opened, you have already written your namein imperishable characters.May the year have still greater opportunities and achievements in store for you.Hoping to grasp your head soon I remain with renewed goodwishes,Yours very sincerelyN TeslaTesla and Hobson continued to socialize with the Johnsons, and Tesla sent theirdaughter Agnes a New Year’s card playfully signed “Nikola Hobson.”71[029_BM029.xhtml#d828]Hobson did not hesitate to use his connections in the navy to help promote hisfriend’s radio-controlled boat. In May 1902, he recommended that the boat beincluded as part of the navy’s exhibit at the Pan American Exposition inBuffalo, and he urged Tesla to write to the navy as “I think this is a goodopportunity for bringing your patents to the attention of the Navy without theusual difficulties of formalities. I think these patents have great value forour Navy and country and therefore my dear Tesla, do not fail in this matter ofthe first step toward their introduction.” Hobson’s efforts to promote Tesla’sinvention were, unfortunately, to no avail; apparently the invention wasreviewed by several high-ranking officers but rejected because two of theofficers were engaged in a bitter personal feud.72 [029_BM029.xhtml#d829]Despite this disappointment, Hobson and Tesla remained close, illustrating howTesla was attracted to men and worked to develop an intimate friendship.AN INVENTOR’S INTENSE AND WILD NATURESo one answer for why Tesla never married was that he was more attracted to menthan women. If he was going to have an emotional relationship, then it was mostlikely going to be with a handsome fellow like Hobson. However, there is asecond answer that we also need to consider: marriage did not suit Tesla’sapproach to invention.To do so, let’s go back to that summer evening in the café with the reporter andtake Tesla at his word, that an inventor—at least like himself—“has so intense anature with so much in it of [a] wild, passionate quality.” Invention for Teslawas an intricate dance between rigorous thinking and a vivid imagination, andwhat made it intense and wild for him was moving back and forth between thinkingand dreaming.Tesla explained how thinking and dreaming were part of the creative process forhim in another interview he gave a few weeks later in the summer of 1896. Therehe offered an explanation of his creative process in the course of discussinghis ideas about the “transmission of sight by wire,” or what we might call cabletelevision. Tesla’s idea involved using a long series of tubes with mirrorsinside that would reflect the program from the source to the viewer. Thisinterview, however, is much more interesting for what it tells us about Tesla’scognitive style, and he began with a discussion of how an ideal—the fundamentalprinciple for an invention—evolved in his mind:I am now able to indicate, in a general way, how far I have gone toward thesolution of the problem. After many fruitless efforts, I have conceived of anidea. I have for a long time scrutinized it and found it agreed with all theestablished facts I knew, hence, as far as I was capable to decide it ispossible. Next I have examined the difficulties which I had to overcome incarrying the idea into practice and have found that they were not insuperable;hence my scheme is practicable. Then I have searched for means of carrying itout and close analysis of these has led me to the conviction that my idea willprobably be carried out.…I say that I conceived an idea. In reality I have conceived many, but for thebenefit of my fellow men and myself they will never be known. They were eitherfallacious or impracticable, products of a heated inventor’s imagination. Butthis particular idea is of a different kind.It withstood my critical examination for weeks, months, and years. Now whenthrough so long a time no flaw in an idea can be found, when through all thestages of excitation and subsequent relaxation it maintains its firm hold uponreason; when as the knowledge of the subject increases and the desire toaccomplish grows more intense by approach to realization, it returns after eachperiod of exhaustion with increased force then this idea is a truth. That is, itis a truth so far as the individual observer is concerned, for there is stillthe superior scrutiny of many [i.e., other experts] which may disclose errorswhich he [i.e., the inventor] was incapable of perceiving.It is important to note here that Tesla says what constitutes an “idea” (hisword) or an “ideal” (my word) is only true for him and that others may notunderstand the inventor’s idea and may criticize it. For an inventor like Tesla,the idea or ideal served as an organizing principle that he could use to shapeand guide his investigations.In the interview, Tesla warned that inventors and scientists should not rush toannounce their ideas; there might still be problems in how the idea should berealized and mistakes could be made. Instead, he suggested that the idea must beprocessed through the imagination, and he launched into an excursion revealinghow his imagination worked:Have you ever abandoned yourself to the rapture of contemplation of a world youyourself create? You want a palace, and there it stands built by architectsfiner than Michael Angelo [sic]—aye, even finer than my friends McKim, Mead &White. You fill it with marvelous paintings, and statuary and all kinds ofobjects of art. You summon fairies if you are fond of them. Now, perhaps, youwant to sit on a throne, and there is your throne, greater than that of GreatBritain! And all your subjects are around you—countless subjects. No fellows torun after you with a pistol, as fellows do after illustrious personages, likeWilliam and Nicholas or Li Hung Chang. And if they would, what do you care? Youstop their bullets in midair.Now you walk out in the streets of a wonderful city. Perchance it is one of mycities. Then you may see that all the streets and halls are lighted by mybeautiful phosphorescent tubes, that all the elevated railroads are propelled bymy motors, that all the traction companies’ trolleys are supplied by myoscillators, or else that my friends of the Cataract Construction Company aretransmitting all the power by my system from a far-off Niagara. And now,perhaps, you meet a tramp in the street and give him something. Five cents, youthink. No, sir; you give him not less than $5,000,000.Strangely, though, instead of collapsing at your generosity, he looks at you inan insolent way and turns the money in his hand and says contemptuously:—“Takeit back, you mean skinflint.” And then you throw down your royal insignia andyou begin to grapple with him. You are endowed with giant strength, and he is nofellow to fool with either. At any rate, the issue is uncertain. He may bestronger, and then, well—then you wake up, saved, but badly used up. If youdefeat him, then you recompense him royally by giving him your insignia and yourthrone, and you continue your adventurous voyage peacefully and contented.Suddenly you throw yourself in the roar of a battle, you cut and slash, and awhole army of noble knights flees before you. And now something rattles in thebushes, and you, who know no fear, you run away. Then you may witness a terriblyimpressive scene of years gone by. You witness the death of your father or yourmother, and you go through all the agonies again. You realize the immense gulfthat separates you from them. Then overwhelming desire takes hold of you to bewith them again. You know it is impossible to get them back; but never mind, youwill invent something, you will discover some force which will reunite thoseseparated molecules and make them form those lovely shapes so dear to you.And now suddenly there comes a revulsion, and you are throwing a stick at a catin a backyard. You miss it, too, aggravating circumstance. But years afterwardyou can tell the exact spot on the wall, you can tell every mark of the stick,and you see exactly how the cat’s fur was brushed one or the other way. So yourimagination leads you on, from sorrow to joy, from work to play, and all thisworld is ever present, ever ready for your pleasure and enlightenment, and atyour wish and command.73 [029_BM029.xhtml#d830]To develop an idea—such as the transmission of sight by wire—Tesla thus arguedthat one must complement rigorous analysis with exercising the imagination. Toinvent, one must be able to imagine the new device and a world within which itfits. Only by doing so can one perfect the invention and hone the ideal. At thesame time, the world of imagination can give rise to desires, wishes, andvisions—the illusions—that can be used to convince others to take up aninvention.For Tesla, then, invention required the inventor to have an intense and wildnature—intense in the sense that it required rigorous thinking to hone an ideal,wild in that one had to be able to freely engage and explore it in one’simagination. Both activities required solitude, and, consequently, marriagewould not necessarily suit an inventor like Tesla.Tesla may have come to the conclusion that an inventor needs solitude by drawingon his Orthodox religious background. To be able to discern the logos in thenatural and man-made worlds, one has to learn not to be distracted by thetemptations of life (see Chapter 1 [010_Chapter010.xhtml]). To be open to thelogos, one had to be willing to refine all of one’s faculties—mental, physical,and spiritual—so that one was as perfect an instrument as possible forexperiencing the Divine order. Perhaps for Tesla this preparation meanteschewing long-term commitments like marriage. Unlike Western Christianity whereone overcomes distractions and prepares for enlightenment through asceticism anda rejection of the body, the Orthodox tradition does not presume that such arigorous dichotomy of mind and spirit is necessarily required; rather,mindfulness can be achieved by living in the world and enjoying the materialcomforts as God’s gifts.74 [029_BM029.xhtml#d831] Hence Tesla’s spiritualpreparation did not mean a withdrawal from the good life of New York but acareful management of it so that it did not get in the way of his efforts tohone his rational and imaginative faculties to discern ideals.BECOMING UNSTUCK: SOLVING THE PUZZLE OF THE RETURN CIRCUITTesla relied on a combination of rigorous thinking and imagination to perfecthis ideas for wireless power transmission. As we saw in Chapter 11[020_Chapter020.xhtml], by early 1895 Tesla had arrived at a basic scheme fortransmitting power around the world without wires. Since electromagnetic wavestraveled in straight lines and only a small amount of power carried by them waslikely to reach the receiver, Tesla had decided to minimize the waves generatedby his apparatus and maximize the ground current that passed between histransmitter and receiver (see Figure 11.6 [020_Chapter020.xhtml#fig11_6]).Moreover, Tesla had hypothesized that if he could generate a ground current atthe resonant frequency of the earth, then the power produced by his transmittermight easily travel to receivers located around the world.Yet as promising as the idea of using ground current seemed, Tesla still had “toascertain the laws of propagation of currents through the earth and theatmosphere.”75 [029_BM029.xhtml#d832] Working with the transmitter in hisHouston Street lab, Tesla set out to determine how electrical oscillations weretransmitted through the Earth by once again carrying a small receiver aroundManhattan. These local tests, he reported, “enable[d] me to reduce thedetermination of the effects produced at a distance to simple formulae or rulesof electrodynamics. Having found these laws to be rigorously true in certainrespects, further trials of this kind became unnecessary, and the dominatingidea became to perfect a powerful transmitter.”76 [029_BM029.xhtml#d833]But while Tesla was pleased to find these formulae for ground transmission, hewas still puzzled by what happened in the atmosphere. Yes, he was confident thatground currents could carry power from a transmitter to a receiver, but whatcompleted the circuit from the receiver back to the transmitter? If one rejectedelectromagnetic waves as the means by which the circuit was completed in theatmosphere, then what made the system work?Here, circa 1896–97, Tesla was stuck; he didn’t have an answer. As he said inthe August 1896 interview discussed earlier, “Finally, after a long study,mostly experimental, of all the means and conditions, I have arrived at a fewprecise facts, enough elements involved in a practical demonstration, and—here Iam sticking, sticking since three years.”77 [029_BM029.xhtml#d834] There werethings he could do with wireless transmission, but he could not solve the puzzleof the return circuit.Patents filed in 1896 show that Tesla concentrated not on developing a systememploying ground currents but on improving his oscillator so that it could beused for wireless lighting and powering X-ray tubes. He also experimented with ahost of circuit interrupters in order to adjust the frequency by which he couldcharge and discharge the capacitors in his system.78 [029_BM029.xhtml#d835]Since several of these projects benefited by boosting the voltage of hishigh-frequency currents, Tesla continued to improve on his spiral coils made upof numerous turns of fine wire.79 [029_BM029.xhtml#d836] Using these spiralcoils, Tesla filed a patent in March 1897 for a new system for transmittingpower using one wire between the transmitter and the receiver (Figure 12.9[021_Chapter021.xhtml#fig12_9]). This system featured a transmitter andreceiver, both of which were essentially transformers. The transmitter employeda generator that produced high-frequency AC. Just as he had done in hisoscillator circuits (see Figure 10.3 [019_Chapter019.xhtml#fig10_3]), Tesla fedthis high-frequency current into the primary of the transformer, which consistedof a few turns of heavy cable. The secondary of the transformer on thetransmitting side was the spiral coil. By using a few turns of thick cable forthe primary and many turns of fine wire for the secondary in the transmitter,Tesla was able to step up the voltage to a very high level. While the terminalon the outside of the spiral coil was grounded, the terminal at the center ofthe coil was connected to a transmission line that carried the power to thereceiver. At the receiver, Tesla created a similar transformer, only this timethe spiral coil served as the primary and the heavy cable as the secondary. Thiscaused the voltage to be stepped down so that it could be used in ordinaryincandescent lamps and motors.80 [029_BM029.xhtml#d837]With the system configured in this manner, Tesla again took up the puzzle of thereturn circuit. How could he eliminate the wire connecting the transmitter andthe receiver to create a true wireless power system? To solve this puzzle, Teslawent back to thinking about why Crookes and Geissler tubes produce light whenconnected to an electrical source. While at atmospheric pressure, most gasesoppose the passage of electricity and function as an insulator; however, to makehis tubes light up, Crookes had evacuated most of the gas from the glass tubes.At low pressures, the gas glows when it is traversed by a high-voltage current.Reasoning by analogy, Tesla replaced the wire between the transmitter andreceiver with what was effectively a giant Crookes tube. In his Houston Streetlaboratory, he erected a fifty-foot glass pipe between his transmitter andreceiver (Figure 12.10 [021_Chapter021.xhtml#fig12_10]). Using a vacuum pump,Tesla lowered the pressure to 120–150 mm of mercury (the pressure of theatmosphere at an altitude of five miles) and discovered that he could create areturn circuit from the receiver back to the transmitter.81[029_BM029.xhtml#d838] While power moved from the transmitter to the receiverthrough the ground, Tesla hypothesized that a return circuit was created in theevacuated pipe since the rarefied air allowed the passage of a current from thereceiver back to the transmitter. Hence for Tesla, the secret to wirelesstransmission lay not with electromagnetic waves (i.e., radiation) passingthrough the atmosphere but that an oscillating current could be conductedthrough a gas at low pressure. “[T]he transmission of electrical energy,”declared Tesla in October 1898, “is one of true conduction, and is not to beconfounded with the phenomena of induction or of electrical radiation which haveheretofore been observed and experimented with.”82 [029_BM029.xhtml#d839] Inemphasizing that electrical oscillations moved through the atmosphere viaconduction, Tesla was again distancing himself from most other inventors andscientists who felt that Hertzian waves were a form of radiation moving throughthe ether.image [Images/pg_266.jpg]FIGURE 12.9.

On the left is Tesla’s transmitter and on the right is his receiver.Across the top is the fifty-foot glass pipe with reduced pressure. From NTM. What really excited Tesla about this experiment showing how oscillating currentscould move through gases at low pressures was that the process was so efficient;if the voltage and frequency were high enough and the atmospheric pressure lowenough, a great deal of power could be transmitted. For Tesla, “the discovery ofthese new properties of the atmosphere not only opened up the possibility oftransmitting, without wires, energy in large amounts, but, what was still moresignificant, it afforded the certitude that energy could be transmitted in thismanner economically. In this new system it matters little—in fact, almostnothing—whether the transmission is effected at a distance of a few miles or ofa few thousand miles.”83 [029_BM029.xhtml#d840] As we shall see, this beliefthat distance was irrelevant figured prominently in how Tesla interpreted theresults of the tests he subsequently conducted and the pronouncements he madeabout his system.If he could set up a return circuit in a nearly evacuated tube, Tesla nowreasoned that he could then do the same at high altitudes where the air wasthinner.84 [029_BM029.xhtml#d841] All that was now needed was to connect thespiral coils in the transmitter and receiver to balloons with a large metallicsurface area (Figure 12.11 [021_Chapter021.xhtml#fig12_11]). Floating high inthe air, these balloons would allow a current to pass from the receiver back tothe transmitter. To depict Tesla’s new wireless system, Pearson’s Magazine ranan illustration showing balloons floating over the skyline of a city (Figure12.12 [021_Chapter021.xhtml#fig12_12]).To avoid having balloons on mile-long tethers, Tesla believed that he could taketwo steps: first, raise the power of his system to millions of volts, andsecond, locate his transmitter and receivers on mountaintops. With regard to thefirst, Tesla began experimenting with increasing the power of his transmitter inthe Houston Street laboratory. Using a primary consisting of two turns of heavycable around the perimeter of the main workroom and his favorite spiral coil,Tesla was able to push the voltage up to 2.5 million volts and generatesixteen-foot sparks (Figure 12.13 [021_Chapter021.xhtml#fig12_13]). He furthertested the power of the system by taking a receiver out of the lab and travelingby boat up the Hudson River to West Point to see if he could pick uposcillations from his lab. Tesla found that he was able to detect oscillationsthirty miles from the lab. During this test, Tesla concentrated on seeing if hecould detect the continuous waves generated by his transmitter and he did notuse the signal to send a message by Morse code or voice.85[029_BM029.xhtml#d842]Although revealing, these experiments did not tell him where best to locate histransmitter; at what voltages and what altitudes would his system work? Whatwould it take to create “a transmitter of adequate power” that might “bridge thegreatest terrestrial distances”?86 [029_BM029.xhtml#d843] To answer thesequestions, Tesla realized that he would have to move beyond the confines of hisNew York laboratory and build a pilot plant.image [Images/pg_269.jpg]FIGURE 12.11.

FromNTM.COURTING JOHN JACOB ASTOR IVTo move beyond the limits of his New York lab and scale up his system, though,meant money. At first Tesla probably assumed that the funding would come throughthe Nikola Tesla Company that he had set up with Adams in 1895. Through thiscompany, Adams and Tesla had hoped to entice businessmen who would buy orlicense the patents for Tesla’s wireless lighting system and then put the systeminto production. Tesla would then be able to plow the profits from any deal intodeveloping his new inventions. But as we have seen, through the mid-1890s, Adamsand Tesla had no takers for this new venture (Chapter 11[020_Chapter020.xhtml]).Consequently, Tesla sought to raise the necessary funds in other ways. Alongwith demonstrating his new system in August 1898 for Prince Albert of Belgium(whom he met previously in Paris), Tesla secured a loan of $10,000 fromCrawford, a partner in the dry-goods firm of Simpson and Crawford.87[029_BM029.xhtml#d844] But Tesla set his sights on catching a big fish: ColonelJohn Jacob Astor IV (1864–1912), who had served with Teddy Roosevelt and theRough Riders in the Spanish-American War.The heir to a $100 million fortune, Colonel Astor was the great-grandson of JohnJacob Astor, who had become rich first in the fur trade and then in real estatein New York City. As one of the wealthiest families in America, the Astors ruledNew York society; indeed, the social elite in late nineteenth-century Americacame to be called the Four Hundred because that was supposedly the number ofguests who could fit into the ballroom in the New York home of Mrs. Astor, thecolonel’s mother. Educated at Harvard, Astor followed family tradition andinvested in Manhattan real estate. Envious of the success that his cousin,William Waldorf Astor, was having with a new hotel, the Waldorf, Astor built hisown luxury hotel next door in 1897 and named it the Astoria. The complex soonbecame known as the Waldorf-Astoria, and at the time, it was the largest hotelin the world.88 [029_BM029.xhtml#d845]But along with building a grand hotel, Astor was fascinated by science andtechnology. Working in a laboratory at Ferncliff, the family estate, Astortinkered with several inventions, including a bicycle brake, a “vibratorydisintegrator” used to produce gasoline from peat moss, and a pneumatic machinefor improving dirt roads. In 1894 he published a science-fiction novel, AJourney in Other Worlds, which described life in the year 2000 and travel toSaturn and Jupiter. In this novel, Astor speculated on new technologies such asa worldwide telephone network, solar power, and even a plan to modify theweather by adjusting the Earth’s axial tilt.89 [029_BM029.xhtml#d846] Clearly atechnological enthusiast, Astor must have seemed like a most promising patron toTesla.Astor was familiar with Tesla’s work since he was a director of the CataractConstruction Company, the firm that had built the Niagara power plant. Astorpresented Tesla with a copy of his novel in February 1895, and Tesla thanked himfor “an interesting and pleasant memento of our acquaintance.”90[029_BM029.xhtml#d847] In addition, Tesla dined regularly at Delmonico’s inorder to be seen by the rich and powerful of New York, and he may have met thecolonel over dinner. (A Journey in Other Worlds opens with a meeting atDelmonico’s of the Terrestrial Axis Straightening Company.) In the fall of 1898,Tesla moved to the Waldorf-Astoria, and that, too, might have given him accessto Astor.Tesla had invited Astor to buy shares in the Nikola Tesla Company in December1895, but Astor had shown no interest.91 [029_BM029.xhtml#d848] Now three yearslater, Tesla was determined to woo Astor and employed a rhetorical strategysimilar to the one he had used ten years earlier with Peck and the egg ofColumbus (see Chapter 4 [013_Chapter013.xhtml]). Like Columbus, Tesla was aboutto discover new worlds through his inventions, but just as Columbus had reliedon Queen Isabella, Tesla needed a strong patron as well. Tesla hoped that such arole would appeal to the colonel. “My dear Astor,” wrote Tesla in January 1899,It has always been my firm belief that you take a genuine, friendly interest inmyself personally as well as in my labors.… Now I ask you frankly, when I havefriend like J.J.A., a prince among wealthy men, a patriot ready to risk his lifefor his country, a man who means every word he says—who puts such a value on mylabors and who offers repeatedly to back me up—have I not a foundation forbelieving that he would stand by me when, after several years of hard work Ihave finally brought to commercial perfection some important inventions which,even at the most conservative estimate, must be valued at several milliondollars[?]Although Westinghouse had given him $500,000 for his AC polyphase system andAdams had invested $100,000 to develop “14 U.S. and as many foreign patents”related to his oscillator, Tesla explained, there was still a “powerful clique”who opposed him (although it is not clear who exactly made up this clique). “Andit is chiefly for this reason that I want a few friends, like yourself,” hecontinued, “to give me at this moment their valuable financial and moralsupport.”Having established that he was seeking Astor to be his patron, Tesla introducedhis marvelous inventions and how they stood to revolutionize the world. First,he extolled the virtues of his lighting system:I now produce a light superior by far to that of the incandescent lamp with onethird of the expenditure of energy, as my lamps will last forever, the cost ofmaintenance will be minute. The cost of copper which in the old system is a mostimportant item, is in mine reduced to a mere trifle, for I can run on a wiresufficient for one incandescent lamp more than 1000 of my own lamps, givingfully 5000 times as much light. Let me ask you, Colonel, how much is this aloneworth when you consider that there are hundreds of millions of dollars investedto-day in electric light in the various chief countries in which I have patentedmy inventions in this field?Tesla’s strategy was still to develop the patents for his lighting system to thepoint where they could be sold at a profit to companies that would in turn putthem into production. “Sooner or later,” he told Astor, “my system will bepurchased by the Whitney syndicate [which was developing electric streetrailways], G.E., or Westinghouse, for otherwise they will be driven out of themarket.”Next, Tesla took up all his other inventions:Then consider my oscillators and my system of transmitting power without wires,my method of directing the movement of bodies at a distance by wirelesstelegraphy, the manufactures of fertilizers and nitric acid from the air, theproduction of ozone … and many other important lines of manufacture as, forinstance cheap refrigeration and cheap manufacture of liquid air, etc.—and youwill see that, putting a fair estimate on all, I cannot offer to sell anyconsiderable amount of my property for less than $1000 a share. I am perfectlysure that I will be able to command that price as soon as some of my inventionsare on the market.To underline that his inventions were a sound investment, Tesla reminded Astorthat he had negotiated contracts with “the Creusot Works in France, the HeliosCompany in Germany, Ganz & Company in Austria, and other firms” for themanufacture of his motors. Tesla boasted that not only had his research in thepast “paid $1500 for every $100 invested, on average” but “I am fully confidentthat the property which I have now in my hands will pay much better than this.”Having whetted Astor’s appetite, Tesla moved in for the sale, inviting thecolonel to invest $100,000. “If you do not take that much interest you will putme at a great disadvantage,” Tesla wrote, and he hoped that if Astor came in, sowould the colonel’s associates, Clarence McKay and Darius Ogden Mills. Inclosing, Tesla reassured Astor that if “after six months you should have anyreason to be dissatisfied, it will be my first duty to satisfy you.”92[029_BM029.xhtml#d849]Within a few days of receiving this carefully crafted sales pitch, Astor signedan agreement with Tesla. Having “placed faith” in Astor, Tesla had bought upenough shares in the Nikola Tesla Company so as to have majority control,leaving Adams, Rankine, Brown, and Coaney with minority interests.93[029_BM029.xhtml#d850] In return for five hundred shares, Astor promised toinvest $100,000 and was made a director of the company. When all of the shareswere transferred to Astor, the colonel gave Tesla an initial payment of $30,000and then promptly left on a trip to Europe.94 [029_BM029.xhtml#d851]SPURRED ON BY MARCONIAlthough Astor was primarily interested in having Tesla perfect a lightingsystem using his oscillator and new lamps, Tesla paid little attention to hispatron’s wishes. Instead, Tesla used Astor’s support to pursue his vision ofwireless power.Tesla was now especially anxious to do so because he was becoming concernedabout what a young Italian, Guglielmo Marconi (1874–1937), was doing with hiswireless system. Like Tesla, Marconi had been fascinated by Hertz’s apparatusand began experimenting with it in the attic of his father’s house outsideBologna in 1894. From the start, Marconi sought to develop a system that couldsend telegraph messages, and he focused on increasing the distance over which hecould send them. In order to finance and promote his system, Marconi traveled toEngland in 1896 where he could take advantage of the business connections viahis mother’s family, the Jamesons, who were prominent in the whiskey and grainbusiness. Marconi steadily improved his apparatus, and by the fall of 1898 hecould send messages over distances of eighty to one hundred miles.95[029_BM029.xhtml#d852] Unlike Tesla, who demonstrated his apparatus privately tofriends and an occasional reporter, Marconi offered regular publicdemonstrations of his system.Impressed by these demonstrations, newspapers in England and America begantouting Marconi’s wireless telegraph as a breakthrough. This positive coverageof Marconi annoyed Tesla since from his perspective, Marconi had done nothingnew. As far back as 1890 Tesla had been experimenting with wireless apparatus,and in his 1893 lecture he had outlined how one could send messages over adistance. Careful to avoid using Marconi’s name, Tesla complained in theElectrical Review in January 1899 that “One can not help admiring the confidenceand self-possession of experimenters, who put forth carelessly such views andwho, with but a few days’, not say hours’, experience with a device, venturebefore scientific societies, apparently unmindful of the responsibility of sucha step, and advance their imperfect results and opinions hastily formed. Thesparks may be long and brilliant, the display interesting to witness, and theaudience may be delighted, but one must doubt the value of such demonstrations.”And Tesla could not resist poking fun at the modesty of Marconi’s apparatus.Unlike Tesla’s sophisticated and powerful system, his rival’s invention was “aworthless trap of interrupting currents, which usually consumes nine-tenths ofthe energy and is … just suitable for the amusement of small boys, who arebeginning their electrical experience with Leclanche batteries and $1.50induction coils.”96 [029_BM029.xhtml#d853]Although Tesla avoided mentioning Marconi in the Electrical Review, reporterssuspected that he was concerned about his young Italian rival. Indeed, thegossipy Town Topics poked fun at Tesla, taking the view that while Tesla wasmaking promises, Marconi was getting results:Tesla, America’s Own and Only Non-Inventing Inventor, the Scientist of theDelmonico Café and Waldorf-Astoria Palm Garden, has been at it again. This timethe news of young Marconi’s success in telegraphing through space fired Tesla tofeats hitherto undreamed of, and he filled columns in the Herald—which paper, Imuch fear me, inclines to help Tesla make a guy of himself—with profounddroolings about volts and resistances and circuits and ampères and things andthings. Tesla says he can do everything that Marconi has done. Of course, hedoesn’t really do them but that may be because he is afraid someone else mayfind out how they are done. He knows all about the theory and the practicalmachinery of Marconi’s messages through miles of space and could prove it too—ifold Bill Jones were alive. Indeed the actual results of the methods of the twoinventors show only this slight difference: Marconi telegraphs through space andTesla talks through space.97 [029_BM029.xhtml#d854]In March 1899, Marconi successfully sent a message across the English Channelfrom Wimereux in France to the South Foreland Light-house in England. Not to beoutdone, Tesla announced that he was prepared to send messages instantaneouslyaround the world. As he boasted in the New York Journal:The people of New York can have their private wireless communication withfriends and acquaintances in various parts of the world.It will be no great wonder to have a cable tower [with a balloon tethered to it]than it is now to have a telephone in your house.You will be able to send a 2,000 word dispatch from New York to London, Paris,Vienna, Constantinople, Bombay, Singapore, Tokio [sic] or Manila in less timethan it takes now to ring up “central.”98 [029_BM029.xhtml#d855]Having now promised worldwide wireless telegraphy, Tesla knew that he had todeliver results. To do so, he decided to use Astor’s money to build the pilotplant he needed to work out the operating details of his wireless system. Tobuild that plant, Tesla headed west to Colorado."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEENSTATIONARY WAVES(1899–1900)Everything you can imagine is real.PABLO PICASSOBy the spring of 1899, all the elements needed to realize his ideal wirelesspower system were falling into place for Tesla: he had perfected the circuitryneeded to create a powerful high-voltage, high-frequency transmitter, he haddiscovered how to tune his transmitter and receivers by adjusting thecapacitance and inductance, and he had become convinced that the atmospherecould serve as the return circuit for his system.Yet to make this system practical, several areas required further investigation.First he had “to ascertain the laws of propagation of currents through the earthand the atmosphere” to ensure that his system could send power or messages fromone point to another. Next Tesla sought “to develop a transmitter of greatpower,” meaning that he had to figure out how to build coils and capacitorscapable of working at millions of volts. And finally, knowing that he would needto deliver power or messages to specific users, Tesla sought to improve hismethods of tuning, or as he put it, “to perfect means for individualizing andisolating the energy transmitted.”1 [029_BM029.xhtml#d856]To address these challenges, Tesla decided to move beyond the confines of hislaboratory in New York City and relocated to Colorado Springs where he workedfrom May 1899 to January 1900. In Colorado, Tesla was at his peak as a creativeexperimenter, but overconfidence in the ideal system that he had been evolvingin his imagination got in the way of rigorously testing his ideas and collectingthe hard evidence he would need later to defend his patents and woo investors.Enamored of his ideal system, Tesla pounced on the first clues ofsuccess—illusions—rather than confront the problems and challenges thatinevitably come with moving an idea from the imagination to the material world.RELOCATING TO COLORADO SPRINGSLocated sixty-three miles south of Denver and at an elevation of six thousandfeet, Colorado Springs was founded in 1871 as a posh mountain resort (Figure13.1 [022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_1]). With its natural scenic beauty (Pike’sPeak is just west of town), high altitude, dry climate, and fluoride-richwaters, Colorado Springs attracted a well-to-do clientele seeking relief from avariety of ailments including tuberculosis. In addition to the well-heeledtourists, the nearby gold-mining districts of Cripple Creek and Victor produceda number of millionaires who built fine homes in Colorado Springs.2[029_BM029.xhtml#d857]image [Images/PG_279_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 13.1. Colorado Springs in the early twentieth century.From the postcard collection of Jane Carlson.One newspaper report suggests that Tesla had made a brief visit to ColoradoSprings in 1896 to conduct a few wireless experiments; the 1899 move came at therecommendation of Leonard E. Curtis, who had been a partner of Parker Page,Tesla’s patent attorney.3 [029_BM029.xhtml#d858] Curtis had moved to ColoradoSprings to regain his health and invited Tesla to come and conduct experimentsthere. In rural Colorado Springs, Tesla could erect a larger system than the onehe had in his New York laboratory and safely conduct experiments with highervoltages. “My coils [in New York] are producing 4,000,000 volts,” Tesla toldCurtis, and “sparks jumping from walls to ceilings are a fire hazard.” Moreover,by being in the mountains, Tesla could study how currents were conducted throughboth the earth’s crust and the atmosphere at high altitude.Attracted by the chance to work away from the press, Tesla accepted Curtis’sinvitation to relocate temporarily and outlined his needs: “This is a secrettest. I must have electrical power, water, and my own laboratory. I will need agood carpenter who will follow instructions. I am being financed for this byAstor, and also Crawford and Simpson. My work will be done late at night whenthe power load will be least.” Delighted to have Tesla visiting, Curtis arrangedfor Tesla to get free power from the local electrical utility, the El Paso PowerCompany.4 [029_BM029.xhtml#d859]Tesla traveled to Colorado Springs by way of Chicago, where he stopped tolecture before the Commercial Club, whose members constituted the Windy City’sbusiness elite. While the high point of the lecture was a demonstration of hisradio-controlled boat (see Chapter 12 [021_Chapter021.xhtml]), Tesla told hisaudience of his plans to broadcast power, signal Mars, and use electricity toconvert nitrogen in the atmosphere into fertilizer. Although the reporter fromthe Chicago Tribune was disappointed that Tesla delivered this lecture “in a lowvoice and a defective accent,” the reporter from the Times-Herald found himmesmerizing when interviewed one-on-one: “Tesla’s bright eyes glowed as he spokeof his ends in his work. Leaning forward, peering almost each moment into theeyes of his interviewer to make sure that his meaning had been understood, heproved a talker from whose train of reasoning there was no escape while a manwas under his influence.”In talking with the Times-Herald reporter, Tesla elaborated on his thoughtsabout interplanetary communication:Signaling to Mars? I have apparatus which can accomplish it beyond any question.If I should wish to send a signal to that planet I could be perfectly certainthat the electrical effects would be thrown exactly where I desire to havethem.… Further than that, I have an instrument by which I can receive withprecision any signal that might be made to this world from Mars. Of course thatis not the same as saying that I could establish communication with beings onMars, but if they should know that I was signaling them, and had intelligenceapproximately similar to ours, communication would not be impossible.Tesla used the Times-Herald interview to again position himself vis-à-visMarconi without mentioning his rival by name. While Marconi was pursuing mereapplications for money, Tesla argued that he was seeking the underlyingprinciples of this new branch of technology:What I am doing is to develop a new art. Is that not more important than theattempt to elaborate an old art in some of its phases? I want to go down toposterity as the founder of a new method of communication. I do not care forpractical results in the immediate present. Where I have time I stop to developthe application of the principles that I have announced, but that is part of thework which it is usually safe to leave to others. They will do it because thereis money in it. For myself I am content to find the new principles through theknowledge of which the applications become possible.5 [029_BM029.xhtml#d860]Leaving Chicago by train, Tesla arrived in Colorado Springs on 18 May 1899. Athis hotel, the Alta Vista, he was immediately accosted by a reporter who askedhim about his plans. “I propose to send a message from Pike’s Peak to Paris,”Tesla boldly replied. “I see no reason why I should keep the thing a secretlonger,” he continued. “I have been preparing for a long while to come here andcarry on these experiments which have been so much to me. I am here to work outa system of transmission at a distance. I propose to propogate [sic] electricaldisturbances without wires.”6 [029_BM029.xhtml#d861]To conduct these investigations, Tesla immediately began construction of anexperimental station on the eastern outskirts of town. Located on an emptypasture known as Knob Hill, the station was positioned between the State Deafand Blind Institute and the Printers’ Union Home (Figure 13.2[022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_2]). (Today this is the intersection of Kiowa andFoote streets.) From Knob Hill, Tesla had splendid views of Pike’s Peak to thewest and the rolling plains to the east.image [Images/PG_282_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 13.2. View of the experimental station from the Pike’s Peak side showingthe tower and retractable pole that Tesla added in September 1899. Tesla usedthe smaller tower and hanging ball to measure how capacitance varied withdistance from the earth. The building in the distance is the Union PrintersHome.Plate I, CSN, p. 299. From NTM.Built by a local carpenter, Joseph Dozier, the experimental station was asixty-by-seventy-foot wooden barn, consisting of one main room and two smalloffices on the front. Over the main room Tesla had Dozier fashion a roof thatcould be opened and closed, as well as a balcony for viewing the countryside.Though Tesla initially planned to use balloons to carry his aerials aloft, hesoon realized that existing balloons could not lift the weight of hundreds offeet of wire. Consequently, he devised a telescoping mast that could hoist athirty-inch copper-covered ball to a height of 142 feet. To stabilize the mast,Tesla added a twenty-five-foot tower to the roof of the station.Tesla was especially anxious to keep his work in the experimental stationsecret. Dozier had included a single window in the rear wall of the station, butlocal boys kept peeking through it so Tesla had it boarded up. To keep othercurious people away, Tesla ordered a fence be erected around the station, withsigns reading “KEEP OUT. GREAT DANGER.” One of Tesla’s assistants added a finalwarning at the door, which quoted Dante’s Inferno: “Abandon hope, all ye whoenter here.”7 [029_BM029.xhtml#d862]To equip his experimental station, Tesla turned to two assistants who came fromhis New York laboratory: Fritz Lowenstein (1874–1922) and an assistant namedWillie. A native of the Carlsbad region (today part of the Czech Republic),Lowenstein had studied engineering in Europe before immigrating to America in1899 and coming to work for Tesla. Tesla took an immediate liking to Lowensteinand was soon confiding in him, sharing key ideas about wireless power. Willie,in contrast, was a mechanic who worked for Tesla in his Houston Streetlaboratory. Willie proved to be a disappointment and was soon discharged; toreplace him, Tesla hired a local teenager, Richard B. Gregg, whose father knewCurtis. In the fall of 1899, Lowenstein left Colorado Springs and Tesla hadanother mechanic, Kolman Czito, come out from his New York laboratory to assistwith the experiments.8 [029_BM029.xhtml#d863]Under Tesla’s direction, Lowenstein and Gregg built an enormous magnifyingtransmitter. In the station’s main room, they constructed a circular wooden wallabout six feet high and 49.25 feet in diameter (see Figure 13.7[022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_7]). Around the top of this wall they wound twoturns of thick cable in order to create the primary winding of the transmitter.In the center of the room they built the secondary coil using a hundred turns offiner wire.9 [029_BM029.xhtml#d864] One end of this secondary coil could beconnected to either a spherical terminal inside the laboratory or the copperball atop the mast while the other end was grounded.To provide AC to the transmitter, Tesla tapped into the streetcar line thatstopped just at the edge of the Knob Hill prairie. He stepped up this 500-voltcurrent by employing a 50-kilowatt Westinghouse transformer that he rewound sothat it converted the incoming current to 20,000 or 40,000 volts.10[029_BM029.xhtml#d865] The transformer was connected to a large bank ofcapacitors that were automatically interrupted (and hence discharged) by amotorized breakwheel (Figure 13.3 [022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_3]). Rounding outthe equipment were several large coils that could be moved around the spacebetween the secondary and the primary.11 [029_BM029.xhtml#d866]image [Images/PG_284_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 13.3. Interior of the experimental station showing the components thatprovided power to the primary coil of the magnifying transmitter.In the front are the capacitors and behind them are the breakwheel andregulating coil. On the wall in back are the lightning arresters and theWestinghouse supply transformer is in the box on the wall to the left. FromPlate III, CSN, p. 301. From NTM.TAKING THE EARTH’S PULSEAs the experimental station took shape, Tesla came to appreciate not only thenatural beauty but also the scientific potential of Colorado Springs. “I had notbeen there but a few days,” he later wrote, “when I congratulated myself on thehappy choice and I began the task, for which I had long trained myself, with agrateful sense and full of inspiring hope.… To this was added the exhilaratinginfluence of a glorious climate and a singular sharpening of the senses. Inthose regions the organs undergo perceptible physical changes. The eyes assumean extraordinary limpidity, improving vision; the ears dry out and become moresusceptible to sound. Objects can be clearly distinguished there at [great]distances … [and] claps of thunder [can be heard] seven and eight hundredkilometers away.”12 [029_BM029.xhtml#d867]In late June and early July, as Lowenstein and Gregg continued to fit out thestation, Tesla began making observations in the clear, crisp environment. Sincehe intended to have his transmitter send currents through the Earth to areceiver some distance away, an immediate task was to study the earth’selectrical potential and note how it varied. Because the numerous systems in NewYork—for telegraphy, telephony, lighting, and transportation—produced too muchelectrical interference, Tesla had not been able to make any reliablemeasurements of whether the Earth possessed a natural electrical potential orcharge. If the Earth were uncharged, then Tesla would have to use his magnifyingtransmitter to introduce a tremendous amount of power in order to make the Earthvibrate electrically and transmit power over distances. To use the metaphor of afootball (discussed in Chapter 11 [020_Chapter020.xhtml]), an uncharged Earthwould be the same as a football with little or no air inside it. However, if theEarth already possessed an electric potential, then Tesla would only need to adda small amount of electricity in order to transmit power; a charged Earth wouldbe the equivalent of a fully inflated football.13 [029_BM029.xhtml#d868]To study the earth’s electrical potential, Tesla rigged up an instrumentcomposed of a coherer with an ink recorder. The coherer consisted of a glasstube filled with loose iron filings between two terminals; whenever the tubedetected a high voltage—such as from a spark or electromagnetic wave—the filingswould line up to create a conducting path between the terminals. Because thefilings tended to stay in position after detecting a signal, some experimentersadded a tiny hammer that would jar the filings loose; in his design, Tesla addeda clockwork that regularly rotated the coherer.14 [029_BM029.xhtml#d869]To increase the sensitivity of his coherer, Tesla placed it in the secondarycircuit of a transformer, while the primary of the transformer was connected tothe ground and an elevated terminal of adjustable capacity. This meant that anyvariations of the electrical potential in the Earth would give rise to electricsurgings in the primary winding, and these in turn would induce currents in thesecondary winding and hence in the instrument. Using this arrangement, Teslafound that “[t]he earth was … literally, alive with electrical vibrations, andsoon I was deeply absorbed in the interesting investigation.”15[029_BM029.xhtml#d870]Pleased to discover that the Earth did indeed have an electrical potential,Tesla next needed to know how electric currents flowed through the earth’scrust. To determine this, Tesla carefully monitored the vibrations with hisreceivers, and he soon noticed that his receivers were more strongly affected bylightning discharges taking place in far-off thunderstorms than they were bylightning from nearby storms; common sense would suggest that the more distantthe lightning discharge, the weaker the signal that would be picked up by thereceiver. “This puzzled me very much,” Tesla recalled. “What was the cause?”16[029_BM029.xhtml#d871]Tesla soon came up with a hunch. As he walked back to the hotel with Lowensteinone evening, he suddenly realized that the variations could be caused if thelightning bolts set up stationary waves in the earth’s crust. A stationary waveis created when two waves traveling in opposite directions add in phase tocreate a new single wave whose amplitude is stationary in time.17[029_BM029.xhtml#d872] A simple example of a stationary wave is what happenswhen one shakes one end of a string while its other end is fastened to a wall.As one vibrates the loose end, a wave travels along the string to the wall;there the wave is reflected back along the string. If one adjusts the incomingvibrations so as to be the resonant frequency of the string, then the two waveswill add together to create a single wave whose peaks and valleys appear to bestanding still. Just as mechanical vibrations can travel along a string, soOliver Lodge had demonstrated in 1887 that electromagnetic oscillations cantravel along a wire or conductor, be reflected at some point, and set up astationary wave.18 [029_BM029.xhtml#d873]In the case of the lightning discharges, Tesla surmised that the lightningstrokes set off an electromagnetic wave in the earth’s crust that reflected backon itself to create a stationary wave. While preparing his Franklin Institutelecture in 1893 Tesla had first thought that electromagnetic stationary wavesmight be set up in the earth, but at that time he “dismissed it as absurd andimpossible.” Now, in Colorado, noted Tesla, “my instinct was aroused and somehowI felt that I was nearing a great revelation.”19 [029_BM029.xhtml#d874]Tesla confirmed his hunch by tracking a spectacular thunderstorm on 3 July 1899.That evening, a violent storm broke loose in the mountains to the west, passedover Colorado Springs, and then moved quickly east onto the plains. According toTesla, the storm produced an “extraordinary display of lightning, no less than10–12 thousand discharges being witnessed inside of two hours. The flashing wasalmost continuous and even later in the night when the storm had abated 15–20discharges per minute were witnessed. Some of the discharges were of a wonderfulbrilliancy and showed often 10 or twice as many branches.”To measure these lightning discharges, Tesla connected his rotating coherer tothe ground and an elevated plate. To magnify any electrical effects transmittedthrough the ground, he inserted a capacitor between the coherer and the ground.And in order to record each lightning discharge, the coherer caused a telegraphrelay to sound. As he reported in his notes, “The relay was not adjusted verysensitively but it began to play, nevertheless, when the storm was still at adistance of about 80–100 miles, that is judging the distance by the velocity ofsound. As the storm got nearer the adjustment had to be rendered less and lesssensitive until the limit of the strength of the spring was reached, but eventhen it played at every discharge.”20 [029_BM029.xhtml#d875]As the storm passed overhead, Tesla quickly set up a second instrument. Anelectric doorbell was connected to the Earth and elevated terminal so that itrang in response to each lightning discharge. This arrangement was similar to alightning detector used by the Russian physicist Alexander Popov in 1895.21[029_BM029.xhtml#d876] To this instrument Tesla added a small spark gap that wasbridged by a bright spark whenever lightning occurred. To get a sense of thestrength of the current passing between the ground and the elevated plate, Teslaheld his hands across the gap and felt the shock that came with each lightningstroke.But “[a]s the storm receded,” noted Tesla, “the most interesting and valuableobservation was made.” As the storm continued east over the plains, Tesla turnedback to using his rotating coherer and relay. As he recorded in his notes:the instrument was again adjusted so as to be more sensitive and to respondreadily to every discharge which was seen or heard. It did so for a while, whenit stopped. It was thought that the lightning was now too far and it may havebeen about 50 miles away. All of a sudden the instrument began again to play,continuously increasing in strength, although the storm was moving away rapidly.After some time the indications again ceased but half an hour later theinstrument began to record again. When it once more ceased the adjustment wasrendered more delicate, in fact very considerably so, still the instrumentfailed to respond, but half an hour or so it again began to play and now thespring was tightened on the relay very much and still it indicated thedischarges. By this time the storm had moved away far out of sight. Byreadjusting the instrument and setting it again so as to be very sensitive,after some time it again began to play periodically. The storm was now at adistance of greater than 200 miles at least. Later in the evening repeatedly theinstrument played and ceased to play in intervals of nearly half an houralthough most of the horizon was clear by that time.22 [029_BM029.xhtml#d877]To explain why the signals started and stopped every half hour, Tesla concludedthat he was observing stationary electromagnetic waves. He reasoned that thelightning strokes set off an electromagnetic wave in the earth’s crust that thenreflected back on itself to create the stationary wave. Tesla was not certainwhere the waves were reflected. “It would be difficult to believe that they werereflected from the opposite point of the Earth’s surface, though it may bepossible,” he observed. “But I rather think that they are reflected from thepoint of the cloud where the conducting path began; in this case the point wherethe lightning struck the ground would be a nodal point.”23[029_BM029.xhtml#d878] Since this nodal point would change as the stormcontinued to move while Tesla’s receiver stayed in one place, the receiver wouldrespond periodically as a peak of the stationary wave passed through the groundunderneath the receiver.24 [029_BM029.xhtml#d879]As it turns out, it is possible to set up stationary electromagnetic waves, notnecessarily in the earth’s crust but between the ionosphere and the earth’ssurface in what is called the Schumann cavity. By using extremely low frequencywaves (ELF), the U.S. Navy discovered that stationary waves penetrate deep intothe ocean, making it possible to maintain radio contact with nuclear submarines.From the 1980s to 2004, the navy operated stations at Clam Lake, Wisconsin, andRepublic, Michigan, that transmitted ELF signals to submarines. To transmit ELFsignals, these stations required an underground antenna that extendedtwenty-eight miles.25 [029_BM029.xhtml#d880] The navy’s ELF project suggeststhat Tesla probably did detect stationary waves produced by lightning storms.His observations were based on actual physical phenomena.Tesla regarded the discovery of stationary electromagnetic waves to be “ofimmense importance,” for he now knew not only that the Earth was electricallycharged but how electromagnetic waves traveled through the earth. Prior to thisdiscovery, Tesla thought that the Earth might behave “like a vast reservoir orocean which, while it may be locally disturbed by a commotion of some kind,remains unresponsive and quiescent in a large part or as a whole.” In this case,electromagnetic waves—such as those produced by lightning—would travel for adistance and then simply peter out, much like the waves created when a stonedropped in the ocean are strong around the point where the stone hits the waterand then dissipate in concentric circles. However, the existence of stationarywaves suggested to Tesla that the Earth did not behave as an ocean when it cameto electromagnetic waves. “Impossible as it seem[s],” explained Tesla, “thisplanet, despite its vast extent, behave[s] like a conductor of limiteddimensions.” And if stationary waves could be set up by lightning, he concluded,then “it is now certain that they can be produced with an oscillator.”26[029_BM029.xhtml#d881] In subsequent experiments at Colorado Springs, Teslastrove to generate low-frequency waves to imitate those he had detected duringlightning storms.For Tesla, the discovery of stationary waves meant that his system would havefar greater reach than Marconi’s apparatus. Yes, Marconi had sent messagesacross the English Channel, but now Tesla felt he could transmit both messagesand power around the world. “Not only was it practicable to send telegraphicmessages to any distance without wires,” Tesla later wrote, “but also to impressupon the entire globe the faint modulations of the human voice, [and] far morestill, to transmit power, in unlimited amounts, to any terrestrial distance andalmost without loss.”27 [029_BM029.xhtml#d882]Not only did lightning storms allow Tesla to discover stationary waves, but hecontinued to track storms over the next few months to determine how far histransmitter should reach. “This I did,” he explained,by comparison with lightning discharges which occurred almost every day andwhich permitted me to determine the effect of my transmitter and to ascertainexperimentally the energy which it was capable of transmitting, as compared withthat energy which was transmitted from a certain great distance by a lightningdischarge. These I could follow up to distances of many hundreds of miles, and Icould at any time tell precisely how much of a fraction of a watt I would obtainwith my transmitter in a circuit situated at any point of the globe. The energyascertained by measurement agreed exactly with that determined by calculation.28[029_BM029.xhtml#d883]Here Tesla was reasoning by analogy. He would observe the movement of alightning storm, determine how far away it was, and measure with his instrumentshow the strength of the stationary waves varied with the distance. Tesla thenassumed that if a storm could transmit so much power over such-and-such adistance, there should be no problem in using his transmitter to send power overthe same distance. “With these stupendous possibilities in sight,” wrote Tesla,“I attacked vigorously the development of my magnifying transmitter, now,however, not so much with the original intention of producing one of greatpower, as with the object of learning how to construct the best one.”29[029_BM029.xhtml#d884] But before he took up this task, his instruments detectedanother interesting set of signals.AN INTERPLANETARY MESSAGE?Thrilled to have found that stationary electrical waves could be set up in theearth’s crust, Tesla continued to improve his instruments for detecting feebleelectrical disturbances as far away as 1,100 miles. In particular, Teslaconnected the coherer to a second oscillator that injected a radio frequency(RF) voltage into the circuit so that the coherer was highly charged and readyto go off in response to the smallest voltage change. With this injected RFvoltage, Tesla could connect a telephone receiver to the coherer circuit so thathe would hear a beep each time the coherer detected electromagneticoscillations.30 [029_BM029.xhtml#d885] In part, he did so thinking that such asensitive instrument might be used for tracking the speed and direction ofstorms. Aware that Britain, Germany, and the United States were building uptheir navies (see Chapter 12 [021_Chapter021.xhtml]), Tesla thought astorm-tracking device might be used by battleships to avoid bad weather.31[029_BM029.xhtml#d886]However, this highly sensitive receiver provoked another discovery. Working atnight, Tesla was amazed to detect weak oscillations consisting of regular beeps:first one, then two, and finally three beeps. “My first observations [of thesebeeps] positively terrified me,” Tesla recalled later, “as there was present inthem something mysterious, not to say supernatural.… I felt as though I werepresent at the birth of a new knowledge or the revelation of a great truth.”Puzzled that the beeps had “such a clear suggestion of number and order,” Teslaat first considered whether they were “electrical disturbances as are producedby the sun, Aurora Borealis and Earth currents, and I was as sure as I could beof any fact that these variations were due to none of these causes. The natureof my experiments precluded the possibility of the changes being produced byatmospheric disturbances.” Rejecting these possible solar or terrestrial causes,Tesla appears not to have been able to determine the cause of these unusualsignals while he was in Colorado. Over the next year or so (1899–1900) hecontinued to think about these unusual observations until “the thought flashedupon my mind that the disturbances I had observed might be due to an intelligentcontrol. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for meto think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantlygrowing on me that I have been the first to hear the greeting of one planet toanother.”32 [029_BM029.xhtml#d887] At the end of 1900 he concluded that thebeeps must indeed be from another planet, and he announced this conclusion in aletter to the American Red Cross in January 1901 (discussed in Chapter 14[023_Chapter023.xhtml]).In his earliest interviews about the beeps, Tesla insisted only that the signalswere extraterrestrial in nature, but reporters were quick to assume that thesignals must have come from Mars.33 [029_BM029.xhtml#d888] In studying Mars inthe late 1870s, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli hadobserved a network of long, straight paths or channels that he labeled “canali”on his maps of the red planet. Many people concluded that Schiaparelli’s canalscould not have been caused by natural forces and were an indication ofintelligent life on Mars. The idea that Mars was inhabited was advanced furtherby the American amateur astronomer Percival Lowell, who built an observatory inFlagstaff, Arizona, specifically to view the Martian canals. In his 1895 bookMars, Lowell argued that the planet was suffering from severe drought and thatthe canals were an ingenious response by Martians to direct water from the polarice caps to central parts of the planet.34 [029_BM029.xhtml#d889]Lowell’s ideas about intelligent life on Mars received wide circulation innewspapers and magazines, and Tesla was certainly aware of these theories. As wehave already seen, Martin had speculated in his 1895 article that Tesla’soscillator might be used to “call up” the Martians (see Chapter 11[020_Chapter020.xhtml]) and Tesla had elaborated on these possibilities whenlecturing in Chicago in May 1899.Although Tesla asked George Scherff to send him an astronomy book during thesummer of 1899, there is no mention of these extraterrestrial signals in thenotes he kept in Colorado. Consequently, Tesla’s biographers have puzzled overwhat he might have actually detected with his sensitive receiver. What couldTesla have heard with his receiver that he took to be a message from Mars?One explanation advanced by biographer Marc Seifer was that Tesla picked upsignals from tests Marconi was conducting with the British and French navies inJuly 1899.35 [029_BM029.xhtml#d890] The difficulty with this explanation is thatTesla’s receiver was not tuned to the frequencies being used by Marconi.According to Kenneth L. Corum and James F. Corum, while Marconi was transmittingat an RF frequency, Tesla’s receiver was set to detect very low frequency (VLF)waves in the 8 to 22 KHz range.36 [029_BM029.xhtml#d891] Tesla was working withwaves in this range because he believed that waves with a low frequency wouldpropagate more efficiently through the earth’s crust. Moreover, powered only bybatteries, Marconi’s transmitter in 1899 probably did not have sufficient powerto generate waves that could travel from England to Colorado. Indeed, totransmit across the Atlantic in 1901, Marconi had to develop a system consistingof a 25-horsepower steam engine driving an AC generator that produced 2,000volts that in turn was stepped up to 20,000 volts.37 [029_BM029.xhtml#d892]Rejecting the explanation that Tesla had simply picked up Marconi’s signals, theCorum brothers instead suggested that Tesla did indeed detect extraterrestrialradio signals. After establishing that Tesla’s receiver was operating in the VLFrange, the Corums investigated what sort of VLF signals might have been comingfrom space during the summer of 1899. As it turns out, one of Jupiter’s moons,Io, emits a 10 KHz signal as it passes through a torus of charged plasmaparticles that surrounds the planet (Figure 13.4[022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_4]). First detected in 1955, radio signals from Iooften come as a series of pulses. To test their explanation, the Corums rebuiltTesla’s receiver, used it during a Jovian radio storm in 1996, and recorded aseries of beeps similar to what Tesla reported hearing in 1899.image [Images/PG_293_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 13.4. Diagram showing how Jupiter’s moon Io passes through a torus ofcharged particles.Electromagnetic waves are generated as Io pushes charged particles throughJupiter’s magnetic field. Because Io’s rotational axis is not parallel to theaxis of Jupiter’s magnetic field, Io sweeps through stronger and weaker parts ofthe magnetic field, thus causing pulses in the generated waves.Adapted from http://physics.uoregon.edu/~jimbrau/BrauImNew/Chap11/FG11_20.jpg[http://physics.uoregon.edu/~jimbrau/BrauImNew/Chap11/FG11_20.jpg].Finally, to explain why Tesla associated these signals with Mars, the Corumsused astronomical software to determine where Jupiter and Mars would have beenin the night sky over Colorado Springs during the summer of 1899. With thissoftware, they found that on several nights in July 1899 Jupiter would haveemitted a signal for part of the evening but would have stopped just as Mars wassetting in the western sky. If Tesla had looked out the doors of theexperimental station as he heard the beeps stop, he would have seen Marsdisappear behind the mountains, making it easy for him to connect the red planetwith the cessation of the signals. Just as Tesla detected stationary waves setup in the Schumann cavity, the Corums argue that Tesla was again observing realphenomena.38 [029_BM029.xhtml#d893]RUNNING THE MAGNIFYING TRANSMITTERIn late July, as his assistants finished assembling the magnifying transmitter,Tesla shifted from listening to the Earth and sky to investigating how to bestoperate this big machine. In his laboratory on Houston Street, Tesla had beenable to reach 3 million volts and produce 16-foot discharges; with this largermagnifying transmitter in Colorado, he hoped to generate 50 million volts andproduce artificial lightning bolts between 50 and 100 feet long.39[029_BM029.xhtml#d894]For Tesla, a typical day at the experimental station began with a buggy ridefrom the Alta Vista Hotel out to Knob Hill. He would spend the morning in hisoffice in one corner of the lab, making calculations, planning the next round ofexperiments, and engaging Lowenstein in long discussions. At midday, Tesla andLowenstein enjoyed a lunch sent from the hotel. Since the El Paso ElectricCompany’s primary business was providing electric lighting, it probably did notrun its generators during the day, and hence Tesla had to wait until the powercame on in the late afternoon to begin his experiments with the magnifyingtransmitter.40 [029_BM029.xhtml#d895] When Tesla did throw the switch, histeenage assistant, Gregg, recalled that “enormous sparks would pour between theballs up high. Often the sparks were 15 or 20 feet long, just like lightning.They made a big crash that echoed inside the lab and could be heard from somedistance away.”41 [029_BM029.xhtml#d896]In operating the magnifying transmitter, Tesla sought to generate a powerfulcurrent that could be sent through the ground. To do so, he needed to push thevoltage up as high as possible and determine the optimal frequency fortransmitting through the earth. To raise the voltage and adjust the frequency,Tesla varied the values for each component that fed power to the primary loop ofthe magnifying transmitter (these components can be seen in Figure 13.3[022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_3]). At different times he raised the voltage comingin from the Westinghouse transformer, modified the speed of the breakwheel,which controlled the discharge of the capacitors, changed the size of capacitorsfeeding the primary coil, and sometimes used one or two windings in the primary(Figure 13.5 [022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_5]). In addition, Tesla experimentedwith the components inside the circular wall: here he tried several differentcoils for the secondary as well as “extra coils” that were placed in thetransmitter’s circuit in different ways. During the first months he was inColorado, both the secondary and the “extra” coil were located toward the centerof the fifty-foot circle, but in the last few months, Tesla created a newsecondary by winding twenty turns on the circular wall and instead located theextra coil in the center of the circle.42 [029_BM029.xhtml#d897]Tesla also varied the capacitance of the secondary circuit by connecting thesecondary and extra coil to different-sized copper-covered balls. To tune thesecondary circuit to the desired frequency, Tesla adjusted the height of thespherical terminal and soon found that he had to elevate the ball through thestation’s roof in order to tune the transmitter sharply. Consequently, inSeptember, he installed the telescoping flagpole that permitted him to raise theball up to 142 feet. During the fall months, Tesla carefully measured how thecapacitance of the secondary circuit varied the height of the ball.For the modern electrical engineer, accustomed to standard electronic componentseither on a circuit board or in a computer simulation, it is easy to vary thecomponents and play with different circuit configurations. However, for Teslaworking on the magnifying transmitter in 1899, we need to remember that therewere neither standard components nor any convenient instruments for measuringthe value of components like coils or capacitors. Each coil, as we havementioned, had to be carefully wound, measured, and then adjusted so that it hadthe necessary inductance. Moreover, given the voltages and frequencies thatTesla was after, many of these components were huge (as compared to modernelectronic devices) and could require days to modify. For instance, more thanonce, Tesla increased the size of the capacitors in the magnifying transmitter;to do so, his assistants had to build more tanks, fill them with a brinesolution, and then add the requisite number of glass bottles. To determine howmany dozen bottles—and whether they should be champagne bottles or those used tobottle water from nearby Manitou Springs—Tesla had to calculate the dielectricproperties for the shape of the bottle. Consequently, changes to the magnifyingtransmitter could take days to make.43 [029_BM029.xhtml#d898]image [Images/PG_296_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 13.5. Notebook sketch of circuit typically used by Tesla at ColoradoSprings.Key: W.T. Secondary of Westinghouse transformer L1, L2 inductance coils C1, C2capacitors P1, P2 primary winding of magnifying transmitter From NT, 17 August1899, CSN, NTM. To operate the magnifying transmitter, Tesla had to carefully tune all of thecoils—the primary, secondary, and extra—so that each resonated with thepreceding coil and hence stepped up the voltage in the manner he desired. At thesame time, to adjust the wavelength of the oscillations, Tesla discovered ageneral rule of thumb: the length of windings in the secondary or extra coilshould be one-quarter of the desired wavelength.44 [029_BM029.xhtml#d899]To estimate the voltage at which the magnifying transmitter was operating, Teslawould quickly open and close the switch feeding power to the primary side of thetransmitter; interrupting the current in this way caused huge sparks to fly offthe sphere connected to the secondary or extra coil. According to Tesla scholarand engineer Aleksandar Marincic, when the sparks reached two to four meters inlength, the transmitter was probably operating at two million volts, but beforelong Tesla was running the transmitter so that it produced streamers that jumpedacross sixteen-foot gaps. Because Tesla had calculated the dimensions of thebuilding as closely as possible to save money on construction, the streamerscame within six or seven inches from the sides of the building, and more thanonce these artificial lightning bolts set the station on fire.45[029_BM029.xhtml#d900]On one occasion Tesla was engulfed by high-voltage streamers while inside thecircular wall that held the primary coil of the transmitter. As he recalled,For handling the heavy currents, I had a special switch. It was hard to pull,and I had a spring arranged so that I could just touch the handle and it wouldsnap in. I sent one of my assistants down town and was experimenting alone. Ithrew up the switch and went behind the coil to examine something. While I wasthere the switch snapped in, when suddenly the whole room was filled withstreamers, and I had no way of getting out. I tried to break through the windowbut in vain as I had no tools, and there was nothing else to do than to throwmyself on my stomach and pass under [the streamers]. The primary carried 500,000volts, and I had to crawl through the narrow place [i.e., in the circular wall]with the streamers going. The nitrous acid was so strong I could hardly breathe.These streamers rapidly oxidize nitrogen because of their enormous surface,which makes up for what they lack in intensity. When I came to the narrow spacethey [i.e., the streamers] closed on my back. I got away and barely managed toopen the switch when the building began to burn. I grabbed a fire extinguisherand succeeded in smothering the fire.As frightening as this experience was, Tesla was nonetheless captivated by theforces with which he was wrestling. As he wrote to his friend Robert UnderwoodJohnson about his time at Colorado Springs, “I have had wonderful experienceshere, among other things, tamed a wild cat and am nothing but a mass of bleedingscratches. But in the scratches, Luka, there lies a mind. MIND.”46[029_BM029.xhtml#d901]While the streamers amply demonstrated the power of the transmitter, Teslagenerally avoided producing them not only for safety reasons but because theywasted the energy of the magnifying transmitter and prevented him fromefficiently transmitting power through the ground. As he explained, “Thestreamers, of course, cause frictional loss and thereby diminish the economy ofthe system and impair the quality of the results. They also cause a loss ofpressure just as leaks in air or water pipes.” According to Tesla coil builderRobert Hull, if we were to see the magnifying transmitter operating at night,lightning bolts would not be flying off the sphere elevated over the roof;instead, we would see a blue beam rising straight up over the station, theresult of a corona of fine streamers surrounding the mast and sphere. As Teslarecalled, “[A]t night, this antenna, when I turned on to the full current, wasilluminated all over and it was a marvelous sight.”47 [029_BM029.xhtml#d902]NAVAL OVERTURESEven as Tesla was deeply engaged with his experiments in Colorado, henonetheless kept an eye out for new sources of funding, and the military was onepotential patron. Not only was Marconi at this time busy cultivating contactswith several navies around the world, but as we have seen, Tesla’s friend Hobsonhad tried to interest American naval officers in Tesla’s radio-controlled boat.Yet Tesla’s biggest interaction with the U.S. Navy was via the Light-HouseBoard.Consisting of naval officers and civilian scientists, this board was responsiblefor maintaining the federal government’s lighthouses and other aids tonavigation. The board took a special interest in using new technology to improvenavigation; for instance, in 1886, it used electric lights to illuminate theStatue of Liberty so that it could serve as a landmark for ships sailing intoNew York Harbor.In May 1899, the Light-House Board asked Tesla if he could establish a system ofwireless telegraphy between the Nantucket Lightship and the shore sixty milesaway.48 [029_BM029.xhtml#d903] This lightship was the first landmark thattransatlantic ships encountered as they approached the coast of the UnitedStates, and it would be helpful to merchants and steamship companies to haveearly information about which ships were about to arrive in New York or otherports.49 [029_BM029.xhtml#d904] Tesla initially agreed to provide experimentalapparatus to test on the lightship, and he advised Scherff to push some workthrough the New York laboratory “as I am preparing myself for the plant atNantucket (for the government), and want to have as much work done as possiblebefore I return” from Colorado Springs.50 [029_BM029.xhtml#d905]Tesla’s relations with the Light-House Board soured within a few months,particularly when he discovered that his wireless apparatus was going to becompared with Marconi’s system. By September 1899, the newspapers were filledwith reports of Marconi’s imminent arrival in New York to cover the America’sCup race and the board became worried about rumors that Marconi would beconferring with the Army Signal Corps and not the navy. Fearful that it would besubject to criticism if it delayed adopting wireless technology, the board askedTesla to step up his efforts to install equipment on the Nantucket Lightship. Inits request, the board emphasized that it wished to work with Tesla, preferring“home to foreign talent,” but that “whatever is to be done should be donequickly.”51 [029_BM029.xhtml#d906]But Tesla did not respond quickly to this request, and after brooding for nearlytwo weeks, Tesla shot off an angry letter to the board. In his view, the boardshould not have to give him any special home advantage since he was the “firstpioneer” who had “laid down certain novel principles on ‘wireless telegraphy’ ”and was now busy perfecting devices based on these principles. As the pioneer inthis field, Tesla was bothered that people saw him as competing with the upstartMarconi, who possessed “more enterprise than knowledge and experience.” If hisequipment was going to be compared with that of Marconi, then Tesla would needthe money necessary to build apparatus that could be properly tested.Consequently, he now told the board: “When you first wrote me, not knowinganything of any competition, I persuaded myself that I might furnish yousomething intended only for temporary service and not free of defects, but nowthat a number of others are in the field, I would prefer to put out an outfitwhich will be able to stand crucial tests. But situated as I am [in ColoradoSprings], I could not possibly undertake such work unless you could give me anorder for, say, twelve sets at least, in which case I could devote myself to thetask of furnishing you the apparatus as speedily as possible.”52[029_BM029.xhtml#d907] The board declined to place this large order, Tesla andthe navy went their separate ways, and in 1902 the navy purchased its firstwireless equipment from several French and German companies.53[029_BM029.xhtml#d908]TUNING FOR “SECRECY, IMMUNITY, AND SELECTIVITY”In running the magnifying transmitter at Colorado Springs, Tesla devoted a greatdeal of effort to perfecting techniques for tuning that would provide “secrecy,immunity, and selectivity.”54 [029_BM029.xhtml#d909] To develop a large-scale,capital-intensive communications system, Tesla reasoned that it would benecessary to make messages secure and private. As he explained a few yearslater, while in Colorado he thought about sending messages across the ocean,“and the greater the distance the more important and the more essential … it wasto secure privacy and non-interference of messages; at small distance it doesnot matter so much whether the operation of a device is interfered with, butwhen costly apparatus, such as was necessary to employ in my contemplatedundertaking was used to produce effects at great distances, the value of a plantand of the whole investment would be destroyed if the messages could not be keptprivate.”55 [029_BM029.xhtml#d910]Though Marconi could send messages from his transmitter to a receiver in 1899,he could not protect his messages from interference from other transmittersoperating in the vicinity. For instance, during the 1901 America’s Cup race offNew York, Greenleaf Whittier Pickard of the American Wireless Telephone &Telegraph Company sent a series of ten-second transmissions that jammed thesignals being sent by Marconi and Lee de Forest as they tried to cover therace.56 [029_BM029.xhtml#d911] Equally, early users of radio were worried abouttheir messages being picked up by other receivers that might be listening, andthis was a serious problem for an army or navy using Marconi’s system to sendmessages since it meant that the enemy could intercept messages. And commercialusers of a wireless telegraph system would want to be sure that their messageswould be just as secure as telegrams sent over the existing wired network.To create a secure system in Colorado, Tesla built upon the work he had done inNew York using two frequencies with his second radio-controlled boat. As we sawpreviously, visitors to the Houston Street lab often noticed that several lampslit up at the same time when Tesla was transmitting power and that he overcamethis problem by tuning the lamps so that they had to receive a combination oftwo frequencies before they would light up.Drawing on this solution, Tesla evolved a general scheme for how to tune hiswireless circuits. Tesla was an avid reader of the English social scientistHerbert Spencer, and he was particularly taken with “Spencer’s clear andsuggestive exposition of the human nerve mechanism.” In his Principles ofPsychology, Spencer had puzzled over the question of how the brain with “alimited number of fibres and cells [can] become the seat of a relativelyunlimited number of perceptions.” Spencer proposed that the brain overcame thisproblem by having nerve fibers that were responsive not just to single impulsesbut to numerous and varied impulses. Spencer compared the nerves in the brain tokeys on a piano; though it had only a limited number of keys (each sounding itsown note), the piano could produce a large number of complex chords whenmultiple keys were depressed. Drawing on Spencer, Tesla observed that “We areable to receive numberless distinct impressions because the controlling nervefibres lend themselves to innumerable combinations, and we can distinguish anindividual from all others by reason of a great many characteristic featureswhich in no other individual exist.”57 [029_BM029.xhtml#d912]Inspired by Spencer, Tesla began thinking about his tuned circuits as nervestrands. If nerve strands responded to multiple combinations of impulses, whynot do the same with his transmitter and receiver? Instead of viewing the factthat the transmitter generated both a fundamental signal and harmonics as aproblem, why not design a receiver to detect the complex signals given off bythe transmitter? “In this reside both the essence and virtue of the invention,”explained Tesla. “The transmitter is not primitively characterized by a singlenote, or peculiarity, as heretofore, but represents a very complex andtherefore, unmistakable individuality, of which the receiver is the exactcounterpart, and only as such can it respond. To go a step further, I make theoperation of the receiving instrument dependent not only on a great number ofdistinctive elements in combination, but also on their order of succession and,if necessary, I go so far as to vary continuously the character of theindividual elements.”58 [029_BM029.xhtml#d913]Now in Colorado, Tesla was ready to test this idea and see if he could send andreceive signals employing a number of distinctive elements. For the transmitter,Tesla used the Westinghouse transformer and breakwheel to supply power not to asingle bank of capacitors but instead to two separate banks, each of which wasthen connected to one turn of the primary loop that ran around the fifty-footcircle in the station (Figure 13.6 [022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_6]). Inside thecircle, Tesla then had two separate secondary coils. Since each secondary coilwas wound with a different length of wire, each generated oscillations at adifferent frequency. Since the entire transmitter was grounded, bothoscillations were sent through the Earth (Figure 13.7[022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_7]).59 [029_BM029.xhtml#d914]On the receiving end, Tesla used a variety of arrangements involving one, two,or even more receivers. However, to test for security, he often used a receiverwith two separate circuits, each of which was tuned to detect one of the twofrequencies sent by his transmitter. In this arrangement, the telegraph sounderresponded only when it received signals from both detection circuits. By sendingand receiving two frequencies in this way, Tesla believed that his messageswould be secure and private.60 [029_BM029.xhtml#d915]As Tesla made progress with this new tuning technique, he began drafting apatent application and openly criticizing Marconi in newspaper interviews. InSeptember 1899, Marconi traveled to New York to use his system to providecoverage of the America’s Cup race. Tesla did not hesitate to point out that hisrival’s system could not overcome problems with interference but that his newsystem would; as he told reporters in Colorado Springs:image [Images/PG_303_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 13.6. Diagram of tuned circuit used byTesla in Colorado Springs.The source of high potential was the Westinghouse transformer and thebreak[wheel] is the same as the one shown in Figure 13.7[022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_7]. Note that the breakwheel is grounded. Just abovethe breakwheel are two capacitors of different sizes. These are connected to twocoils that are the two windings on the primary of the magnifying transmitter.The two other coils are the secondaries and they are shown in Figure 13.7[022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_7].From NT, 27 June 1899, Colorado Springs Notes p. 55. Diagram redrawn by theeditors.I hope within a week or two to announce to the world a system of wirelesstelegraphy that will be nearly perfect.…I will not disparage the Marconi system, but every system in use at the presenttime has a serious defect in that its action is disturbed by similar instrumentswithin a radius of a greater or less number of miles. Besides twelve words aminute seems to be a very fast time.With the system I have about completed I hope to attain by mechanical methods aspeed of fifteen hundred or two thousand words a minute, and further, to haveinstruments absolutely free from extraneous disturbances. I have succeeded ineliminating outside influences and can make instruments work free from anotheralmost within touch.Marconi’s experiments are interesting, but they are not new. I am glad they arebeing successfully employed in the yacht races, but it is by no means improbablethat before the next international race is pulled off, boats propelled bywireless power transmission will follow the races, and I hope the yachtsthemselves will have wireless telephones on board.61 [029_BM029.xhtml#d916]image [Images/PG_304_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 13.7. The magnifying transmitter with several secondary coils energizedby the primary coils on the circular wall. Since each secondary coil had adifferent number of turns, they produced two different wavelengths that weresent into the earth and transmitted to Tesla’s receiver.Plate V, CSN, p. 306. From NTM.TESTS AND WITNESSESAlthough he conducted some experiments using the magnifying transmitter to sendmessages, Tesla focused most of his attention on the problem of transmittingpower wirelessly, and he was gratified to discover that he could indeed sendoscillating currents through the ground. On 23 July 1899, he noted that horsesin the pasture near the experimental station were disturbed whenever themagnifying transmitter was run, presumably because their iron horseshoes pickedup the ground current. The next day, with the secondary coil of the transmittergrounded, he noticed that the lightning arresters on a separate grounded circuitsparked whenever the secondary coil discharged. “There was no other possible wayto explain the occurrence of these sparks,” wrote Tesla excitedly, “than toassume that the vibration was propagated through the ground and following theground wire at another place leaped into the line! This is certainlyextraordinary for it shows more and more clearly that the earth behaves simplyas an ordinary conductor and that it will be possible, with powerful apparatus,to produce the stationary waves which I have already observed in the displays ofatmospheric electricity.” Tesla noted that he detected the sparks sixty feetaway from the secondary coil; assuming that the magnifying transmitter wasalready operating at 10,000 volts, he calculated that it should be possible todetect these sparks 114 miles away.62 [029_BM029.xhtml#d917]Over the next few months, Tesla conducted additional tests to verify that hismagnifying transmitter was sending currents into the ground and that they couldbe detected. In August he tried “arrangements for telegraphy,” finding that“[t]he apparatus responded freely to [a] small pocket coil at a distance ofseveral feet with no capacity attached and no adjusted circuit. Consequentlywill go at great distance.” A few weeks later, he took a receiver outside andconnected it to an underground water pipe; at 250 feet from the station, he drewone-inch sparks, and at 400 feet he got half-inch sparks. On 11 September 1900,Tesla carried a receiver a mile away from the station, to nearby Prospect Lake,where he was able to measure that the magnifying transmitter was operating witha wavelength of about 4,000 feet.63 [029_BM029.xhtml#d918]In mid-December, as he was completing his experiments in Colorado, Teslaarranged for the photographer Dickenson Alley to come out from New York andphotograph his magnifying transmitter in action. (These photographs arediscussed more fully later.) As part of this series, Tesla had Alley makeseveral images of lamps lit by the oscillator outside the experimental station.For one image, Tesla placed three lamps on the ground and connected them to asquare of wire that was sixty-two feet on each side; this huge square picked upthe ground current from the oscillator and caused the bulbs to glow (Figure 13.8[022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_8]). Tesla reported that the bulbs were sixty feetfrom the secondary coil inside the station. In a second photograph takenoutside, Tesla connected an incandescent lamp between a large coil and theground and again the lamp glowed (Figure 13.9 [022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_9]).For this second image, Tesla did not indicate how far away the coil was from thetransmitter.64 [029_BM029.xhtml#d919]image [Images/PG_306_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 13.8. “Experiment to illustrate an inductive effect of an electricaloscillator of great power.”This photograph shows three incandescent lamps located in a field a shortdistance from Tesla’s experimental station. The lamps were connected to a largesquare loop of wire that detected ground currents sent out by the magnifyingtransmitterPlate XVII, CSN, p. 332. From NTM.These are the only experiments in Tesla’s published notes from Colorado in whichhe recorded the distance that energy was transmitted. Instead of observingreceivers operating in response to the transmitter at various distances, Teslarelied on calculations to evaluate the performance of the magnifyingtransmitter. “When the apparatus was in action,” he later explained, it wouldproduce “a current of many hundreds of amperes” that passed “away into the earthand creat[ed] a disturbance. I would measure the effects produced and calculatethe distance at which a certain amount of energy, necessary for the operation ofa receiving device, would be transmitted.”65 [029_BM029.xhtml#d920]image [Images/PG_307_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 13.9. “Experiment to illustrate the transmission of electrical energywithout wire.”Here Tesla placed a coil outside the laboratory with the lower end connected tothe ground and the upper end free. The lamp was lit by three turns of wire woundaround the lower end of the coil. Plate XXVI, CSN, 340. From NTM.In subsequent articles about his work in Colorado, Tesla emphasized that he hadproven that power could be transmitted through the earth, but he did not specifyin these reports how far power had been transmitted. While biographer JohnO’Neill claimed that Tesla lit two hundred incandescent lamps twenty-six milesfrom Colorado Springs, no evidence has been found to support this claim.66[029_BM029.xhtml#d921]One unusual aspect of the few distance tests that Tesla performed was that therewere no witnesses. Despite his frequent interactions with journalists in NewYork, Tesla avoided talking to reporters while he was hard at work in Colorado;hence contemporary newspaper accounts offer few clues as to what Tesla was doingwhile out West.67 [029_BM029.xhtml#d922] When asked during a deposition if hehad seen the receivers operating during transmission tests, his assistantLowenstein reported, “As to receiving apparatus, Mr. Tesla never charged me withexperimenting with it and always did that part himself whilst letting me operatethe transmitter.” According to Lowenstein,Mr. Tesla would at first go with the receiving apparatus in his room andexperiment there, while I was handling the oscillator. Then he would take, aftercertain accomplishments in the room, the whole set in portable boxes and gooutside of the building, leaving me instruction for continuously switching onand off in certain intervals. In these instances, I often ran to the door to seehim for a moment, and I saw that he went as far as, say, a thousand or twothousand feet. I could not watch him closely, as I had to stick to my switch,and so it came that sometimes when just looking out to see him for a moment Icouldn’t see him, and then I don’t know how far he went, but by the time he cameback again, being to my recollection not more than the forenoon or theafternoon, you may easily build an idea how far Mr. Tesla could have gone at thetime I was standing at the switch.68 [029_BM029.xhtml#d923]As a trained engineer, Lowenstein would have been an ideal witness, but sinceTesla insisted on having him operate the magnifying transmitter and not go withhim to see the receivers, Lowenstein could not report on how the transmissionexperiments turned out (Figure 13.10 [022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_10]).Moreover, Tesla and Lowenstein had a major disagreement, resulting inLowenstein’s leaving Colorado in September 1899 before Tesla undertook some ofthe major experiments with the magnifying transmitter. On the surface, it wouldappear that Lowenstein left because he found that the high altitude of ColoradoSprings made him ill and because he wanted to go back to Europe to marry hisfiancé. Tesla clearly regarded Lowenstein as more than a mere assistant; Tesladiscussed ideas with him, ate lunch and dinner with him, and spent evenings withhim back at the hotel.69 [029_BM029.xhtml#d924] Lowenstein may have been comingto be the sort of friend and confidante that Szigeti had been years earlier.However, Tesla found some letters that Lowenstein had written or received,prompting Tesla to conclude that Lowenstein was not the person that Teslathought he was. One possibility is that Tesla may have been attracted toLowenstein and was upset when he learned that Lowenstein wanted to get married.Tesla later forgave Lowenstein and employed him again for a few years beginningin 1902. Lowenstein subsequently started a company that built radio sets for theU.S. Navy during World War I. Nevertheless, whatever happened in ColoradoSprings made Tesla reluctant to use Lowenstein as a witness in legalproceedings.70 [029_BM029.xhtml#d925]image [Images/PG_309_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 13.10. Unidentified assistant [possibly Lowenstein?] at main power switchin the experimental station. From NTM. The lack of witnessed distance tests in Colorado Springs is puzzling, especiallygiven the fact that Marconi was regularly offering demonstrations of hiswireless system to reporters and potential investors. Years earlier, Tesla hadmade good use of both private and public demonstrations for his inventions. Withthe AC motor, Peck and Brown had sent him off to see Professor Anthony in orderto undertake rigorous tests and secure the endorsement of an expert. Similarly,Tesla had not hesitated in his public lectures in the early 1890s to showaudiences his wireless lighting systems. Why, then, in Colorado Springs, didTesla not undertake more extensive distance tests that would show that hissystem worked as well as Marconi’s? Given that his Colorado Springs notes reportsignals detected a mile from the station, why didn’t Tesla invite Lowenstein,reporters, or other witnesses to confirm that his receivers were detectingcurrents from the transmitter?This lack of witnessed distance tests can be explained on two levels: thetheoretical and the personal. From a theoretical standpoint, Tesla did notbelieve that such tests were necessary. Tesla had decided that stationary wavesin the earth, unlike ordinary Hertzian or light waves, did not lose energy asthey propagated; consequently, if they could be detected a short distance fromthe transmitter, these waves could be detected at any distance. Likewise, Teslaalso thought that in the return circuit through the atmosphere the process ofconduction was extremely efficient and that there would be minimal losses. Ifthere were no losses as the waves traveled from the transmitter to the receiverand back again, then any test detecting the waves—no matter how short thedistance—was sufficient for Tesla. Hence he concluded that “communicationwithout wires to any point of the globe is practicable … [and] would need nodemonstration.”71 [029_BM029.xhtml#d926]On a personal level, the lack of distance tests reflects Tesla’s approach toinvention. As a boy, Tesla had developed a powerful imagination, in which he wasable to picture all sorts of wondrous things. As an inventor, he had continuedto rely on his imagination to envision how new devices might work and to thenseek confirmation in selected experiments. Had he not pictured his AC motorfirst in Budapest, only to have it confirmed when he built prototypes inStrasbourg and New York? Was it not enough for Tesla to get a tin can to spin ina rotating magnetic field in 1887 in order for him to be convinced that his ideawas feasible? With wireless power, Tesla had spent years refining in his mindhow it would be possible to transmit energy through the earth. Supremelyconfident of his ability to imagine new technology, Tesla needed only a smallamount of confirmatory evidence from the world around him to convince him thatwhat he imagined was possible. Once he had detected stationary waves in theEarth and once he had detected sparks a mile away from his transmitter, Teslahad all the evidence he needed to be convinced that his system worked.As we shall see, the consequence of not performing additional distance tests ordemonstrating his system for witnesses was that Tesla was subsequentlyhard-pressed to convince others about the value of his system. Over the nextdecade, when testifying to defend his patents, Tesla was unable to provide harddata showing whether his system worked. He had only one witness, Lowenstein, whocould talk about Colorado Springs, but Lowenstein never saw what happened withthe receivers. Equally, Tesla had little to show potential investors; they hadto take Tesla’s word that the system was capable of transmitting messages andpower across the seas and around the world.PHOTOGRAPHING POWERRather than having people witness the performance of the magnifying transmitter,Tesla instead chose to rely on photography to document his work at ColoradoSprings; photographs were the illusion of choice. In the late fall, Teslatelegraphed Richard Watson Gilder, the editor-in-chief at The Century Magazine(and Robert Underwood Johnson’s boss): “Friendly motives prompt me to inquirewould it pay you to send [a] photographer here with [the] object of obtainingmaterial for illustrations to appear at your pleas[ur]e in Century my rightssubsequently reserved[?] If so would like very much getting Mr Alley of Tonnelebecause of familiarity skill and discretion[.] Would join you in expense as hemay do some work for me[? ] Kindly answer experimental station.”72[029_BM029.xhtml#d927]Gilder and Johnson readily agreed to share the costs and sent the artphotographer Dickenson Alley out from New York. Alley had helped test Tesla’slighting tubes in 1894 (see Chapter 12 [021_Chapter021.xhtml]) and had taken thephotographs that appeared in the Electrical Review in the spring of 1899. Overthe last two weeks of December 1899, Tesla and Alley created a remarkable seriesof sixty-eight photographs.73 [029_BM029.xhtml#d928]To create these images, Alley used 11 × 14-inch glass plates that were exposednot only by the giant streamers produced by the magnifying transmitter butsupplemented with illumination from an arc light or flash powder. Since powerfrom the local electrical company was still only available at night, Alley andTesla worked all night to set up the equipment for these pictures, which oftenmeant they did so in freezing conditions. With the wind whistling through thethin walls of the experimental station, Alley appears in several picturesbundled up in his heavy winter coat and hat.74 [029_BM029.xhtml#d929]image [Images/PG_312_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 13.11. “Discharge of ‘extra coil’ issuing from many wires fastened to thebrass ring” [on top of coil].Plate LIX, CSN, p. 366. From NTM.Tesla and Alley began by documenting how the experimental station looked outsideand inside (see Figures 13.2 [022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_2], 13.3[022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_3], and 13.7 [022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_7]).75[029_BM029.xhtml#d930] They next photographed the magnifying transmitteroperating at the normal level of excitation (see, e.g., Figure 13.7[022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_7]). To create various kinds of streamers, Teslaconnected the free terminal of the extra coil to different disks, balls, a ringwith protruding wires, as well as a fan of wires radiating out; at the sametime, Alley varied the position of the camera so as to capture the streamersfrom various angles (Figure 13.11 [022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_11]). In order togenerate streamers to photograph (remember that streamers represented wastedenergy and so Tesla generally tried to avoid producing them), he had hisassistant Czito quickly open and close the main power switch 50, 100, or 200times. In the course of these experiments, Tesla was delighted to see that histransmitter could throw off streamers that spanned straight-line distances of31–32 feet but whose curved path might be as long as 128 feet.76[029_BM029.xhtml#d931] One streamer managed to strike Alley and his camera inone corner of the station, as far away from the extra coil as possible.Thrilled, Tesla confidently predicted that with more copper wire in thetransmitter and a bigger building, he could have generated streamers with curvedtrajectories over 300 feet.Tesla and Alley created several images in which they each sat in a chair next tothe extra coil. Because it would have been far too dangerous for someone toactually sit through the electrical storm captured on camera, Alley used a bitof trick photography. “To give an idea of the magnitude of the discharge theexperimenter is sitting slightly behind the ‘extra coil,’ ” explained Tesla. “Idid not like this idea but some people find such photographs interesting. Ofcourse, the discharge was not playing when the experimenter was photographed, asmight be imagined! The streamers were first impressed upon the plate in dark orfeeble light, then the experimenter placed himself on the chair and an exposureto arc light was made and, finally, to bring out the features and other detail,a small flash powder was set off.”77 [029_BM029.xhtml#d932] Hence, by using adouble exposure on a single photographic plate, Alley created the memorablepicture of Tesla calmly reading while his magnifying transmitter let loose atorrent of streamers (Figure 13.12 [022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_12]).78[029_BM029.xhtml#d933]The inventor and photographer then experimented with how to capture the wirelesstransmission of power.79 [029_BM029.xhtml#d934] To do so, they concentrated onphotographing standard sixteen-candlepower incandescent lamps that wereconnected to a receiving coil and the ground in order to show that the lampswere lit up by power sent through the ground from the magnifying transmitter(see Figures 13.8 [022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_8] and 13.9[022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_9]). For the first batch of photographs, Tesla setup the lamps and receiving coil somewhere outside the experimental station sincehe knew that “[t]aken in this manner they would be undoubtedly much moreinteresting to scientific men.” For these images, Tesla carefully recorded manyof the operational details but not the distance between the lamps and thetransmitter. While these photographs typically show three or five lamps lit,Tesla estimated that he could easily light as many as sixty bulbs.80[029_BM029.xhtml#d935]image [Images/PG_314_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 13.12. Tesla seated in magnifying transmitter, with discharge passingfrom the secondary coil to another coil. This picture was a double exposure on asingle glass plate; Tesla was first photographed and then the magnifyingtransmitter was turned on.Plate XII, CSN, p. 322. From NTM.Indeed, suspecting that an increase in the capacitance in the receiving circuitwould require a ground current with a lower voltage, Tesla had Alley photographa second series of experiments inside the station while he varied thecapacitance of the receiving circuit by connecting bigger metal balls as well asthe telescoping flagpole. These tests confirmed his hypothesis about thecapacitance of the receiving circuit, leading Tesla to boldly predict that, atfull power, his magnifying transmitter could light over a thousand lamps.81[029_BM029.xhtml#d936]In the course of using the magnifying transmitter to light lamps outside thelaboratory, Tesla managed to short-circuit the generator at the power company’sstation and cut off power to the rest of Colorado Springs. The short circuit wascaused by the fact that Tesla was generating shorter waves than usual and thesewaves ruptured the insulation in the generator’s windings. Impressed by thepower of the short waves, he commented in his notes that they might well be usedfor sending signals over a thousand miles. To placate the local power companymanager, Tesla took his crew down to the station and repaired the damagedgenerator. Nevertheless, for the remaining time he was in Colorado, the powercompany supplied electricity to Tesla using a backup generator.82[029_BM029.xhtml#d937]It was also in the course of taking these photographs that Tesla encounteredfireballs or ball lightning produced by his magnifying transmitter. Along withthe electrical streamers, Tesla occasionally saw luminous spheres, about 1.5inches in diameter, which floated in the air for a few seconds. Fireballs suchas these had a long history in mythology but had also been reported in thescientific literature; for instance, while duplicating some of BenjaminFranklin’s experiments with lightning rods in 1753, Georg Richmann in St.Petersburg, Russia, was struck by a fireball that killed him, knocked out hisassistant, and tore a nearby door off its hinges.83 [029_BM029.xhtml#d938]As powerful as fireballs are, scientists still debate what causes them toappear.84 [029_BM029.xhtml#d939] While Tesla initially assumed that these weresome sort of optical illusion, he soon developed a scientific explanation fortheir appearance. “[T]he phenomenon of the fireball,” he wrote in his notes, “isproduced by the sudden heating, to a high incandescence of a mass of air orother gas as the case may be, by the passage of a powerful discharge.” Accordingto Tesla, when a powerful electrical discharge (like a streamer) passes throughthe air, it heats and expands the air in some places but leaves a partial vacuumin other places. The atmosphere naturally rushes in to fill this vacuum. If,however, one of these partial evacuated spaces—which takes the form of asphere—is struck by a second powerful streamer, then what little gas is in thepartial vacuum is brought to a very high incandescence. This glowing ball existsfor several seconds because it reaches a state of temporary equilibrium; asTesla wrote, “It can not cool down rapidly by expansion, as when the vacuousspace was being formed, nor can it give off much heat by convection.… All thesecauses cooperate in maintaining, for a comparatively long period of time, thegas confined in this space at an elevated temperature, in a state of highincandescence.”85 [029_BM029.xhtml#d940] Tesla also noted that more fireballsseemed to be created when the air surrounding the magnifying transmitter wasfilled with vaporized carbon, such as when the high voltages in the transmittercaused the rubber insulation to break down. Fascinated, Tesla promised in hisnotes to continue to study fireballs using a more powerful magnifyingtransmitter and more sensitive photographic plates.86 [029_BM029.xhtml#d941]Tesla was enthralled with the photographs that he and Alley took, finding themboth aesthetically and technologically pleasing. He felt that these imageseffectively represented the amount of power that he could generate andmanipulate with his magnifying transmitter. Over the next few years, Teslapresented copies of selected photographs to individuals whom he hoped wouldsupport his research. In reflecting on one of the experiments that Alley hadphotographed, Tesla noted a few days before leaving Colorado that “Nothing couldconvey a better idea of the tremendous activity of this apparatus and … showsthat one of the problems followed up here, that is the establishment ofcommunication with any point of the globe irrespective of distance, is very nearits practical solution.”87 [029_BM029.xhtml#d942]CONFIRMATION, NOT DISCONFIRMATIONTaken together, Tesla’s discovery of stationary waves, his detection ofinterplanetary messages, his puzzling indifference to distance tests, and hisuse of photography to document his work reveal a significant aspect of his styleas a mature inventor. At Colorado Springs, Tesla appears to have sought onlyevidence to confirm his hypotheses and not look for anything that mightdisconfirm his theories.Inventors, as well as scientists, are always looking for confirmatoryevidence—that the device or experiment actually works. Put more precisely, bothinventors and scientists are seeking proof that the ideas they have in theirminds are confirmed by the action of objects and forces in the material world.Because so few ideas readily match up with the material world, it isunderstandable that inventors and scientists often develop a confirmatory bias;they want to see their ideas succeed and hence they are quick to seize uponevidence that supports their idea. Such hope is essential to technological andscientific work, for without it inventors and scientists would lack the optimismto keep trying new things.Yet this hope must be complemented by a degree of tough-mindedness. Yes, anexperiment seems to show that a particular hypothesis is true, but then the taskfor the scientist is to eliminate all other hypotheses. To do so, the scientistand inventor often tries to disconfirm his or her hypothesis—to show that itdoesn’t work.88 [029_BM029.xhtml#d943] In invention, disconfirmation is perhapseven more important than it is in science. First, because an inventor ispromising patrons that his creation will work in certain ways and under certainconditions, he or she often has to “torture-test” an invention to establish whenit works and when it fails. Second, the failure of an invention often providesan inventor with valuable clues about how to improve a device. By studying how adevice fails, an inventor can identify ways needed to perfect an invention. AsEdison remarked when his phonograph emitted recorded speech for the first timein 1877, “I was always afraid of things that worked the first time”—he fearedthat without something going wrong, he would not know how to go forwardimproving the device.89 [029_BM029.xhtml#d944]But in contrast to Edison working on the phonograph, Tesla in Colorado Springsdid not seek to disconfirm his ideas about transmitting power and messagesthrough the Earth by using stationary waves. He did not, for instance,systematically eliminate all other explanations for why he heard the“one-two-three” beeps in his receiver. And Tesla did not measure directly howfar he could actually send power through the earth. Instead, anxious to see histheories about wireless power confirmed, he eagerly seized on the evidence thatsupported his ideas. He did not seek to disconfirm his ideas while at ColoradoSprings—to “torture-test” them so that he really knew where they did and did notwork. Didn’t Alley’s photographs reveal that he was controlling unbelievableamounts of power? This is not to say that what Tesla discovered in ColoradoSprings was “wrong” in some way; indeed, he was observing actual phenomena—likethe stationary waves created by lightning storms or the pulses emanating fromJupiter’s moon Io—during his stay there. What is significant—and ultimatelytragic—about his time in Colorado was that Tesla let a small amount ofconfirmatory evidence suffice when he needed to be open to the alternatives.High hopes and a small amount of confirmatory evidence created illusions in hismind."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEENWARDENCLYFFE(1900–1901)Satisfied in his own mind that power could be transmitted around the worldwithout wires, Tesla triumphantly returned to New York in January 1900. Withwireless power, Tesla was now at the same point he had been in 1887 with his ACmotor. In both cases he had observed phenomena he believed were ideal forshaping into major inventions. In 1887, he had just succeeded in getting a shoepolish tin to spin in a rotating magnetic field whereas in 1900, Tesla wasconvinced that he could set up stationary waves in the Earth and transmit powerand messages. It was now time to convert the phenomenon he had observed inColorado into a major invention, and to do so he needed to create a network ofpeople, ideas, money, and resources. It was time to implement the businessstrategy he had learned from Peck and Brown: secure strong patents, promote hiswork to build public interest, and then sell to the highest bidder. It was timeto talk about the potential of wireless power and get people excited.But would it all go well this time, just as it had in 1887? Would promotion leadto the money and ultimately to success for Tesla? To be sure, the situationconfronting Tesla in 1900 was different than it had been in 1887. Since Peck haddied ten years earlier, Tesla could no longer rely on him for advice, and he wasnot especially close to Edward Dean Adams, his patron since the mid-1890s. Whomight serve as his business mentor and patron? Could he count on John JacobAstor, who seemed interested in his work? Unlike his motor, did wireless powerhave a keystone component on which Tesla could focus his efforts and securestrong patent coverage? Indeed, wireless power was a system, and as such, Teslawould need not thousands of dollars (which had been sufficient for his work onthe motor) but hundreds of thousands to build a demonstration plant. Moreover,what kind of publicity should he pursue? Could Tesla work with the professionalelectrical engineering community, or should he take advantage of his celebrityin the popular press? And above all, in 1900, he had to deal with strong rivals;with the motor, Tesla had easily outmaneuvered Ferraris and Dolivo-Dobrowolsky,but with wireless technology, he was competing with Marconi, Reginald Fessenden,and Lee de Forest. Could Tesla assemble a network of ideas and resources fastenough that would allow him to beat these rivals? These were the challenges thatTesla would confront over the next five years.MAKING BOLD PLANSWhile he was glad to settle back into the luxurious Waldorf-Astoria Hotel afterhis stay in Colorado, Tesla was even more excited about getting back to hislaboratory on Houston Street and begin preparing patents. As a first step toprotecting his Colorado discoveries, Tesla drafted a patent that summarized howhis magnifying transmitter could create stationary waves in order to broadcastpower and messages through the earth. To illustrate the potential of thissystem, Tesla proposed an early form of radio navigation and described how hissystem could set up two stationary waves with different wavelengths that shipsat sea could detect and then use to calculate their position. Tesla was verypleased with this patent, recalled Scherff, and he regarded it as “one of thebest he had ever written.” Once this broad application was ready, Tesla thenprepared three more applications detailing his method of tuning using twodifferent signals (see Chapter 13 [022_Chapter022.xhtml]).1[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_1]As he was drafting his patent applications, Tesla also did not hesitate to tellthe world what he planned to do. He boldly repeated the goal that he had toldthe press when he had arrived in Colorado Springs in May 1899, that he wouldsend messages to Paris: “My experiments have been most successful, and I am nowconvinced that I shall be able to communicate by means of wireless telegraphynot only with Paris during the [upcoming] Exhibition [of 1900], but in a veryshort time with every city of the world.”2 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_2]When Tesla announced this ambitious plan to transmit messages across theAtlantic, his rival Marconi had only been able to send messages 86 miles and washoping to increase that distance to 150. Consequently, Marconi had “no belief inNicola Tesla’s promise to communicate across the Atlantic,” reported oneelectrical paper. “He believes that science, while gradually progressing, willbe unable to obtain such great results before the preliminary results have beensurmounted. Personally, he does not expect, yet, to girdle the Atlantic.”3[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_3]Ignoring Marconi, Tesla knew he would need to design and build a largercommercial plant to girdle the Atlantic and reach Paris. Borrowing a metaphorfrom Hobson, he explained, “The plant in Colorado was merely designed in thesame sense as a naval constructor designs first a small model to ascertain allthe quantities before he embarks on the construction of a big vessel.”4[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_4] Based on his experiments in the mountains, Tesla couldnow calculate the size of the components he needed in his system in order totransmit across the Atlantic.Since this system would require large-scale AC-generating equipment of the sortmanufactured by the Westinghouse Company, Tesla naturally turned to GeorgeWestinghouse for help. His success in Colorado, Tesla boasted to his old patron,“has been even greater than I anticipated, and among other things I haveabsolutely demonstrated the practicability of the establishment of telegraphiccommunication to any point of the globe.” But to move forward, he would need aWestinghouse steam engine and dynamo. Knowing the high cost of this equipmentand recognizing that there was at that moment a “panicky feeling all around” onWall Street, Tesla was worried that it would be difficult to raise the necessarycapital. Hence he asked Westinghouse “whether you would not meet me on some fairterms in furnishing me the machinery, retaining the ownership of the same andinteresting yourself to a certain extent” in the new enterprise? “I have been soenthused over the result achieved and have worked with such passion,” Teslaconfessed, “that I have neglected to make such provisions for money.… Being thuscompelled to borrow money I turn to you to ask whether your company will notadvance me say $6000 on the guarantee of my [motor] royalty rights from England,or if preferable whether they would buy outright my claims on the royalty for asum of $10,000.”5 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_5] Tesla explained that he preferred notto sell his rights since doing so might hurt his old partners Brown and Peck(presumably Peck’s widow), who owned five-ninths of the English rights.Though Westinghouse declined to take a stake in Tesla’s new enterprise, he didloan Tesla the money; doing so made sense since the loan was tied to the futurepurchase of Westinghouse equipment.6 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_6] At the same time,Westinghouse probably wanted to curry favor with Tesla since the company wasembroiled in a series of lawsuits over the validity of the Tesla motor patents,and it was counting on Tesla to testify as an expert witness in these cases.7[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_7]Along with asking Westinghouse for a loan, Tesla continued to court John JacobAstor. Though Astor had agreed to help finance Tesla’s experiments, he appearsto have made only one payment. During his time in Colorado, Tesla had anxiouslywaited for more money and regularly asked Scherff for news about “JJA.” FromColorado, he had sent Astor a set of the photographs showing the magnifyingoscillator in action.8 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_8] Now back in New York, Tesla sentthe colonel copies of his wireless patents and assured Astor that these patentsgave him an absolute monopoly on transmitting power and messages. Astor,however, had lost interest in Tesla and ignored his entreaties. Overall, Astorinvested only $30,000 in Tesla’s wireless experiments.9 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_9]COLD PHILOSOPHICAL STONES OR HOT THROBBING FACTS?Certain that other investors besides Westinghouse and Astor would flock to hismagnificent wireless plans, Tesla spurned the scientific press and insteadpromoted them in newspapers and popular magazines. In particular, he poured hisenergy into writing the article he had proposed in the fall of 1899 when he hadasked The Century Magazine to send Dickenson Alley to Colorado to photograph hiswork. Tesla presented a first version at the end of January at a dinner given bythe Johnsons, but since it was too short, the article could not be published inthe March or April issue of the magazine.10 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_10]Rather than focus the article on his recent accomplishments in Colorado, Teslabegan expanding it, determined to show how his inventions constituted a grandintellectual scheme. For years he had been pondering how his inventions wouldchange history, and he now decided that together they represented acomprehensive way of increasing the physical energy available to humanity. Thearticle in The Century was his chance to show the world the significance of hiswork. “I knew,” wrote Tesla with his usual confidence, “that the article wouldpass into history as I brought, for the first time, results before the worldwhich were far beyond anything that [had ever been] attempted before, either bymyself or others.”11 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_11]But as Tesla’s article grew voluminous, Johnson became worried that the Wizardwas serving up a mess of cold philosophical stones instead of a dish of hotthrobbing facts.12 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_12] “I just can’t see you misfire thistime,” wrote an anxious Johnson to Tesla. “Trust me in my knowledge of what thepublic is eager to have from you. Keep your philosophy for a philosophicaltreatise and give us something practical about the experiments themselves.” Inresponse, Tesla penned back, “Dear Robert, I heard you are not feeling well andhope that it is not my article that makes you sick.”13 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_13]The article went back and forth from author to editor, growing from four tosixteen chapters. To satisfy Johnson, Tesla added final sections highlightingwireless telegraphy and his plans for transmitting power. When it finallyappeared in the June issue of The Century Magazine, Tesla’s treatise had reachedthirty-six pages and was illustrated with photographs of electrical streamerspouring out of the magnifying transmitter as well as images of incandescentlamps sitting out in the Colorado countryside while being powered withoutwires.14 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_14] (The Century illustrations included Figures13.3 [022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_3], 13.7 [022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_7], 13.8[022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_8], and 13.9 [022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_9].)Titled “The Problem of Increasing Human Energy,” the article was Tesla’sinterpretation of the role of energy and technology in the course of humanhistory. In florid Victorian language, he began,Of all the endless variety of phenomena which nature presents to our senses,there is none that fills our mind with greater wonder than that inconceivablycomplex movement which … we designate as human life. Its mysterious origin isveiled in the forever impenetrable mist of the past, its character is renderedincomprehensible by its infinite intricacy, and its destination is hidden in theunfathomable depths of the future. Whence does it come? What is it? Whither doesit tend? are the great questions which the sages of all times have endeavored toanswer.15 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_15]Tesla was inspired to tackle such questions, having read John William Draper’sHistory of the Intellectual Development of Europe. Drawing on his study ofphysiology, Draper had sought to demonstrate “that civilization does not proceedin an arbitrary manner or by chance, but that it passes through a determinatesuccession of stages, and is a development according to law.” Determined to findthe laws guiding human progress, Tesla framed his approach in mechanical andmathematical terms. “Many a year,” Tesla explained, “I have thought andpondered, lost myself in speculations and theories, considering man as a massmoved by a force, viewing his inexplicable movement in the light of a mechanicalone, and applying the simple principles of mechanics to the analysis of thesame.”16 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_16]For his law guiding human development, Tesla proposed the equation E = mV2/2,where E was total human energy, m equaled the mass of humanity, and V was thevelocity of human change. While these terms were hypothetical, what counted forTesla were the relationships embodied in this equation. In particular, theequation suggested to Tesla that there were three ways that human energy mightbe enlarged: by increasing the human mass (i.e., improving society), byeliminating any forces retarding humanity, and by increasing the velocity (i.e.,the rate of progress). Tesla discussed each of these three approaches at somelength in the article.To increase human mass, Tesla argued that it was necessary to pay attention topublic health, education, and the availability of pure water and wholesome foodwhile suppressing gambling and smoking. He was especially concerned about thespeed and haste by which most city-dwellers experienced life. To improve waterpurification, Tesla advocated using the ozone produced by his electricaloscillators to kill germs. To expand the food supply, Tesla recommendedvegetarianism and described how electricity could be used to capture nitrogenfrom the atmosphere in order to create cheap fertilizer.17[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_17]Turning to the forces retarding the human mass, Tesla listed ignorance, deceit,and war. To eliminate war, Tesla described at length his radio-controlled boatand how he could use electromagnetic oscillations to give boats and otherdevices a “borrowed mind.” Representing the start of a new field, telautomatics,Tesla argued that the steady development of radio-controlled devices wouldresult in wars that were fought by machines with few human casualties. Theadvent of telautomatics, wrote Tesla, “introduces into warfare an element whichnever existed before—a fighting-machine without men as a means of attack anddefense. The continuous development in this direction must ultimately make war amere contest of machines without men and without loss of life—a condition whichwould have been impossible without this new departure, and which, in my opinion,must be reached as preliminary to permanent peace.”18 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_18]Indeed, Tesla believed that future wireless weapons would become so powerful anddangerous that humanity would be prompted to outlaw war.In order to increase the velocity of humanity—to speed up progress—Tesla wantedto harness greater amounts of energy. Arguing that nearly all of the energyavailable on Earth comes from the Sun, Tesla was confident that humanity couldtap vast amounts of the solar energy and turn it into cheap electricity. Amongthe many ways to produce electricity, Tesla discussed windmills, solar-poweredboilers, geothermal energy, hydroelectric plants, and ideal heat engines. Aselectric power became more plentiful, he believed that electricity couldrevolutionize the production of iron and steel since cheap power could be usedto break water down into hydrogen and oxygen, the hydrogen could be used as fuelin blast furnaces, and the oxygen could be sold as a byproduct. Tesla wasequally excited about the potential use of aluminum since it could be easilysmelted using electricity. Knowing that all of this cheap power would need to betransmitted efficiently, Tesla thus set the stage for introducing his plans forthe wireless transmission of energy. In the closing sections, he described hisdiscoveries in Colorado and how he anticipated that he could send both power andmessages around the world without losses. Absolutely convinced of the importanceof wireless power, Tesla concluded his Century article with a poetic flourishfrom Goethe:I can conceive of no [other] technical advance which would tend to unite thevarious elements of humanity more effectively than this one.… It would be thebest means of increasing the force accelerating the human mass.…I anticipate that [some people], unprepared for these results … will considerthem still far from practical application.… [Yet] the scientific man does notaim at an immediate result. He does not expect that his advanced ideas will bereadily taken up. His work is like that of the planter—for the future. His dutyis to lay the foundation for those who are to come, and point the way. He livesand labors and hopes with the poet who says:Daily work—my hands’ employment,To complete is pure enjoyment!Let, oh, let me never falter!No! there is no empty dreaming:Lo! these trees, but bare poles seeming,Yet will yield both food and shelter!19 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_19]Tesla’s article in The Century Magazine elicited great interest in the popularpress, and excerpts appeared in newspapers and magazines across Europe andAmerica during the summer of 1900.20 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_20] In the scientificcommunity, the article was, not surprisingly, greeted with skepticism; in aletter to Popular Science Monthly, “Physicist” growled that the public should beprotected from such wild speculation passing for scientific fact.”21[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_21]One trenchant response to The Century Magazine story came from Tesla’s formerfriend, T. Commerford Martin. Still angry with Tesla about their 1898 feud overthe radio-controlled boat and the publication of Tesla’s medical electricitypaper, Martin wrote to the editor of Science that “I have had so muchsatisfaction in the review and criticism recently published in Science, of Mr.Tesla’s magazine article on ‘Human Energy’ that I cannot avoid making publicacknowledgement of my appreciation of its justice and timeliness.” Martinobserved that the combination of decreasing publication costs and increasingcompetition among newspapers and magazines during the 1890s had resulted in thepublication of a great deal of sensational and unreliable scientific reporting.“Among many other evils growing out of … ‘Newspaper Science,’ ” warned Martin,“not the least is the manufacturing and maintaining of false reputations. Theconstant appearance of a name in connection with the development of a given art,science, discovery or invention makes an impression which is difficult todestroy, and this is true even among the most intelligent classes. To find whois really and truly eminent in any field of human activity one must go to thespecialists in that field. The popular verdict is more than likely to be wrongbecause it is based on fictitious, newspaper-created renown.”22[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_22]On the one hand, Martin’s remarks may seem disingenuous, given how hard he hadworked a decade earlier to build up Tesla’s reputation through strategicallyplaced stories and the publication of a book on Tesla. On the other hand, Martinsignals to us that the world of electrical technology in 1900 was vastlydifferent from that of 1890. To establish electricity as a legitimate commercialtechnology, it may have been acceptable in 1890 for practitioners like Tesla tomake all manner of bold claims; there was a naïve and democratic faith that thepublic and investors would be able to figure out on their own which claims weretrustworthy. In contrast, by 1900 the electrical industry was well establishedand worth tens of millions of dollars; hundreds of professional electricalengineers were in key positions in this industry. Determined to protect this newindustry and this new profession, leaders of electrical engineering now viewedthemselves as the gatekeepers—whom Martin referred to as the “specialists”—andalong with Martin, they were vitally aware that sensational newspaper sciencecould do more harm than good. The first decades of the twentieth century wouldbe the age of the professional expert whose authority was grounded in scientifictraining, professional affiliations, and hard evidence.23[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_23] As we shall see, over the next few years Tesla found itmore and more difficult to mobilize the evidence he needed to maintain hiscredibility with professional scientists and engineers.Tesla paid little heed to Martin’s concerns about the danger of using newspapersto create his reputation. Through the summer of 1900, he followed up thepublicity generated by the Century story with additional pronouncements. InAugust, newspapers reported that he was testing his oscillator on tuberculosispatients to see if the high frequencies could kill the bacteria causing thedisease. A few weeks later, Tesla announced that he had patented a newelectrical transmission cable that used ice to reduce power losses and that thisnew cable could permit power to be transmitted across the ocean from NiagaraFalls to London.24 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_24]THE WIZARD AND THE GREAT MANIn November 1900, Tesla got a lucky break. He was able to meet with the mostpowerful man on Wall Street, J. P. Morgan (1837–1913), and to convince Morgan toloan him $150,000 to support his wireless work.The son of a prominent financier, Morgan was educated in Boston and at theUniversity of Göttingen. He followed his father into banking, and in the 1870sMorgan drew on his father’s connections in London financial circles to securemuch-needed capital for American railroads. In the 1880s, as railroads engagedin cutthroat competition and bankrupted themselves, Morgan frequently stepped into refinance and reorganize these lines. In doing so, he protected theinvestments made by his firm (as well as those of his clients) by retaininglarge of blocks of stock and demanding seats on the boards of the railroads hereorganized. By the end of the century, Morgan controlled most of the railroadsoperating in the eastern portion of the United States. From railroads, Morganmoved into industrial mergers; in 1892, he assisted the Boston banker Henry LeeHigginson in combining the Thomson-Houston Electric Company and Edison GeneralElectric to form the General Electric Company. By the time Tesla met Morgan, hehad become the dominant figure in American capitalism.25[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_25]It is not entirely clear how Tesla came into contact with Morgan, but it mayhave been the result of Morgan and his partners developing an early interest inwireless telegraphy. As an avid yachtsman, Morgan probably became aware ofwireless technology during the 1899 America’s Cup races. During this race,Morgan was the commodore of the New York Yacht Club and the chief sponsor of thedefending yacht, Columbia. As we saw previously, Marconi came to New York inorder to demonstrate his wireless system by transmitting messages from the racesto reporters from the New York Herald. Just prior to the race, Edward C.Grenfell and Robert Gordon from Morgan’s London branch approached the directorsof Marconi’s company, the Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company, offering to buyMarconi’s American patents for 200,000 pounds.26 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_26] Aspart of the deal, the Morgan men insisted that it include “Ocean rights” thatthey could exercise “if ever Wireless telegraphy could communicate from Englandto New York.” The Marconi directors, however, were not satisfied with that priceand kept changing the terms of the deal; the Morgan representatives eventuallygave up in disgust.27 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_27]Unable to buy Marconi’s American patent, Morgan may very well have regardedTesla as an alternative way to investigate this new technology. Consequently,about a year later, Morgan met briefly with Tesla on 23 November and 7 December1900 at his home. During these meetings, Tesla introduced Morgan to his wirelesstechnology, boldly suggesting that it would replace both the telegraph and thetelephone. He proposed that he and Morgan form one or two companies to developwireless technology, insisting that Morgan take a controlling 51% share of thestock in these new ventures.28 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_28]But beyond broaching these ideas, Tesla appears to have kept these meetings withMorgan short, perhaps because he found it difficult to deal simultaneously withthe power of Morgan’s personality and Morgan’s large, deformed nose, which hadbeen scarred by rhinophyma and was covered with warts. With regard to Morgan’spowerful presence, Annette Markoe Schieffelin recalled that when he entered aroom “you felt something electric: he wasn’t a terribly large man but he had asimply tremendous effect—he was the king. He was it.” Likewise, the art dealerJames Henry Duveen described his first encounter with Morgan in the followingmanner: “I was unprepared for the meeting.… I had heard of a disfigurement, butwhat I saw upset me so thoroughly that for a moment I could not utter a word. IfI did not gasp I must have changed colour. Mr. Morgan noticed this, and hissmall, piercing eyes transfixed me with a malicious stare. I sensed that henoticed my feelings of pity, and for some time that seemed centuries, we stoodopposite each other without saying a word. I could not utter a sound, and whenat last I managed to open my mouth, I could produce only a raucous cough. Hegrunted.”29 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_29] Tesla would have been equally squeamishabout Morgan’s nose.Unable to make his case fully in person, Tesla followed up each encounter withletters. In the first, Tesla built a case for developing his wireless technologyby pointing out that it could compete effectively with the transatlantictelegraph cables. Knowing that Morgan relied on messages sent between his NewYork and London offices by undersea cable, Tesla reported that he was now ableto manipulate electrical pressures of a hundred million volts and hundreds ofthousands of horsepower of electrical energy so that it was no longer necessaryto rely on those “long and expensive cables” to send messages. Implicitly citingwhat he had learned by observing the stationary waves set up by thunderstorms inColorado, Tesla assured Morgan that “Long practical experience with apparatus ofthis kind and exact measurements embracing a range of nearly seven hundredmiles, enable me to construct plants for telegraphic communication across theAtlantic and, if need be, across the Pacific Ocean, with the fullest measure ofsuccess.” Referring to his work on tuning, he informed Morgan that he couldselectively operate “a great number of instruments without mutual interference,and can guarantee the absolute privacy of all messages.” Tesla estimated thatconstruction of two temporary stations for transmitting across the Atlanticwould cost $100,000 and require six to eight months of work. To span thePacific, Tesla would need $250,000 and he could accomplish that in a year. Butmost of all, he wanted to assure Morgan that he was willing to trust himcompletely. “Although the development of these inventions has consumed years ofeffort,” wrote Tesla, “knowing that I have to deal with a great man, I do nothesitate to leave the apportionment of my interest and compensation entirely toyour generosity [emphasis added].”30 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_30]In a second letter, Tesla discussed the patent situation. He had already securedbroad patents covering his inventions in America, Australia, and South Africa,and he was free to make new arrangements to exploit these patents. In responseto questions raised by Morgan concerning Marconi and other rivals, Tesla assuredthe Great Man that even though the British Post Office favored Marconi’stechnology, this nonetheless demonstrated that there was a potential market forwireless technology. Further, Tesla provided quotes from leading scientists—LordKelvin, Sir William Crookes, and Adolph Slaby—praising his previous inventionsand genius. Confident of his legal position, Tesla told Morgan that with “mypatents in this still virgin field, should you take hold of them, you willcommand a position which … will be legally stronger than that held by the ownersof Bell’s telephone inventions or by those of my own discoveries in powertransmission by alternating currents.”Just as he had done previously with both Peck and Astor, Tesla skillfully playedup the appeal of supporting a pioneer by providing both the money and businessacumen needed to convert his ideas into revolutionary new inventions. “Permit meto remind you,” said the Wizard to the financier,that had there been only faint-hearted and close-fisted people in the world,nothing great would ever have been done. Rafael [sic] could not have created hismarvels, Columbus could not have discovered America, the Atlantic cable couldnot have been laid. You, of all, should be the man to embark boldly on thisenterprise, only seemingly hazardous, prompted by superior insight as well asdesire to advance an art of inestimable value to mankind.Coming to the financial question –please remember: These inventions,—the resultsattainable only by their means—which now I alone am able to accomplish—in yourstrong hands, with your consummate knowledge and mastery of business—are worthan incalculable amount of money.Although I have expressed myself in my last letter, I will be more explicitrelative to my share and compensation. The control is yours, the larger part isyours. As to my interest—you know the value of discoveries and artisticcreations—your terms are mine.31 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_31]Anxious that he had not yet persuaded Morgan, Tesla drafted a third letter, tenpages long, but before he could send it he received word that the Great Man waswilling to support him.32 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_32] Thrilled, Tesla quicklypenned a note to Morgan on 12 December:How can I begin to thank you in the name of my profession and my own, greatgenerous man! My work will proclaim loudly your name to the world!You will soon see that not only am I capable of appreciating deeply the nobilityof your action, but also of making your primarily philanthropic investment wortha hundred times the sum you have put at my disposal in such a magnanimous andprincely way!33 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_33]Although Morgan nominally agreed to help Tesla in December 1900, they did notfinalize their agreement for two months, probably because Morgan was deeplyinvolved in negotiating the creation of United States Steel with AndrewCarnegie.34 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_34]In the meantime, Tesla used the occasion of the opening of the twentieth century(then regarded as starting on 1 January 1901) to announce that while he had beenin Colorado, he had received an interplanetary message (see Chapter 13[022_Chapter022.xhtml]). In response to an inquiry from the American Red Crossasking him what he considered the most important scientific development thatwould affect the new century, Tesla informed the group that the major challengeahead would be figuring out how humans could establish contact with otherworlds.35 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_35] The Wizard was careful not to claim that themessages he had detected had come from Mars, but enterprising reporters quicklyinterpreted his statements to mean that Tesla believed he had receivedemanations from the red planet. Tesla was roundly criticized by leadingscientists for making these claims, and one can only wonder what Morgan thoughtas these Martian reports turned up everywhere in newspapers and magazines.36[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_36] Was Tesla simply confident that Morgan was going tosupport him no matter what? Or was it that he could not resist an opportunity toput forward such a compelling illusion?While waiting for Morgan in the early weeks of 1901, Tesla sought to use theGreat Man’s endorsement to entice Astor to support his wireless lightinginventions. Since his return from Colorado, Tesla had been tinkering with hiswireless lamps that now took the form of a rectangular spiral of glass tubing.“Hearty wishes for the new Century,” wrote Tesla to Astor. “Mr. Morgan’sgenerous backing, for which I shall be grateful all my life[,] secures me mytriumphs in wireless telegraphy and telephony, but I am still unable to put mycompleted inventions on the market. I can hardly believe that you, my friendsince years, should hesitate to join me in introducing them which I can offeryou ten times better returns on your investment than anyone else.” Despite theirlong friendship and promises of huge profits, Astor was suspicious, having readin the newspapers that Marconi and others might have stronger patents in thewireless field than Tesla. “Do not be misled by what the papers say, Colonel,”replied Tesla. “I have the controlling rights. Why not come in with Mr. Morganand myself[?]” Still cautious, Astor declined any further involvement withTesla. To compensate for Astor’s withdrawal, Tesla promptly launched a newspaperblitz, emphasizing how his lamp produced an “artificial sunshine” that purifiedthe atmosphere, killed germs, and exerted “a “Soothing Effect Upon theNerves.”37 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_37]Unaware that Morgan was busy combining most of the steel industry into a single“billion dollar trust,” Tesla grew worried, as the weeks passed, that he had notheard from his new patron. Perhaps to force Morgan’s hand, Tesla began a newpublicity campaign for his wireless telegraph system in mid-February. Tesla toldreporters that his system was now complete and that he would be transmittingmessages across the oceans in eight months’ time. Further stories indicated thatTesla was thinking about locating his transmitting station on the New Jerseycoast and that he had dispatched an agent to look for a location for a receivingstation in Portugal. Although Tesla had not yet worked out the business details,reporters noted that he “was most enthusiastic in his veiled references to thefinancial assistance he has received.”38 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_38]Never a fan of the New York tabloids, Morgan was unimpressed with Tesla’snewspaper coverage and perhaps even annoyed.39 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_39] As theLiterary Digest noted, “The daily papers treat [Tesla’s] various pronunciamentoseach after its kind, the yellow journals with weird pictures and big headlines,the more serious ones with skeptical paragraphs.”40 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_40]However, as the negotiations with Andrew Carnegie and the other steel baronscame to a close, Morgan assigned one of his partners, Charles Steele, to workwith Tesla. Steele asked Tesla to draft a letter of agreement in which Morganwould advance funds to Tesla in return for a 51% share of Tesla’s wirelesspatents. No mention was made of forming any companies or sharing the stockbetween the Great Man and the inventor. Tesla readily assented to “sign anydocument approved by Mr. Morgan” but asked if the agreement could cover not onlythe development of wireless telegraphy but also his wireless lighting system.After meeting with Tesla again on 26 February, Morgan agreed to include lightingalong with wireless telegraphy in the agreement.41 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_41]Consequently, on 1 March 1901 Tesla submitted a letter to Morgan summarizingtheir arrangement. Having spent several years working to perfect an electriclighting system as well as investigating wireless telegraphy and telephony,Tesla wasanxious now to construct the apparatus necessary for putting my discoveries andinventions to practical use and for continuing my investigations on the subjectsnamed.For this I desire to procure the sum of [blank space] and I hereby agree that ifyou will advance such sum to me as hereinafter stated, I will assign to you aninterest of fifty-one percent in all of said patents and inventions, and also inany patents or inventions which I may hereafter secure.On 4 March—the day after the formation of United States Steel wasannounced—Morgan accepted Tesla’s letter and instructed Steele to insert$150,000 in the blank space in the letter.42 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_42]It is important to pause and consider what this agreement probably meant to eachman when it was signed. For Morgan, it was, as Tesla recalled later, “a simplesale”; in return for $150,000, Morgan was assigned 51% of Tesla’s patent rights.The amount involved was probably not significant for Morgan; in April 1901, hebought sight unseen the famous painting The Duchess of Devonshire by ThomasGainsborough for $150,000. A few months later he purchased Raphael’s altarpiece,Colonna Madonna, for $400,000, and after glancing at some architectural plans,he readily gave the Harvard Medical School $1 million for three buildings.43[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_43]While it is often assumed that Morgan invested in Tesla in order to gain controlof the future wireless industry (and hence protect his investments in theexisting wired telegraph and telephone networks) by taking preemptive control ofwireless technology, there is nothing to support this supposition. Indeed, ifthis had been the case, Morgan would most likely have waited until this industryhad further matured; for instance, he did not work with Higginson to formGeneral Electric until after others had invested heavily and built the Edisonand Thomson-Houston companies into thriving enterprises. Morgan made his moneynot by investing in high-tech startups but in consolidating and financingcompanies in growing, well-established industries.Instead, Morgan’s involvement was, as Tesla hinted in his 12 December 1900letter, largely “philanthropic.” Morgan periodically provided money to variousindividuals to advance artistic and scientific projects; for example, in 1902 hepaid for Bashford Dean to move from the American Museum of Natural History(where he had studied armor-plated fish from the Devonian era) to theMetropolitan Museum of Art so that he could catalogue a collection of medievalarmor.44 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_44] In all likelihood, Morgan saw Tesla as aninteresting artist or scholar and wireless telegraphy as a promising researchventure, and as such, Morgan was not especially worried about whether Tesla’sproject succeeded commercially.Although Tesla must have been delighted to secure $150,000 from Morgan, he didnot get everything that he wanted in this agreement. For Tesla, the agreementwas not supposed to be about selling his patent rights for $150,000 but aboutforming companies and establishing a partnership. In Tesla’s mind, while heprovided the technical wizardry, Morgan was supposed to deliver the financialgenius needed to make his wireless technology into a marvelous new business.What Tesla was probably hoping was that Morgan would take the place of Peck, hisold patron from the AC motor days—that Morgan would take the time to understandTesla’s dreams, nurture them, and help connect those dreams to practicalconcerns in the business world. At the time he signed the agreement, Tesla didnot complain to Morgan about their arrangement, either because he was tooexcited about getting the money or because he did not want to offend the GreatMan.45 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_45]Yet Tesla remained anxious about his relationship with Morgan. In acceptingMorgan’s terms, Tesla wrote to Steele in March 1901 that he hoped “that allmanner of conveying a wrong impression on Mr. Morgan is removed by his kindacceptance of my proposal” and “that in a time not distant I may be able toprove myself worthy of the confidence he has placed in me.”46[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_46]THE LABORATORY AT WARDENCLYFFEHaving secured funding from Morgan, Tesla eagerly set to work planning a newlaboratory for demonstrating his wireless telegraphy. To design this newlaboratory, Tesla turned to his friend Stanford White. White sketched animposing one-story brick building that was ninety-six feet square with a tallchimney in the center (Figure 14.1 [023_Chapter023.xhtml#fig14_1]). Though thebuilding was largely functional, White provided arched windows and decorated thechimney with a cast iron wellhead inspired by one that he had seen in Italy.White estimated that construction of the laboratory would cost about $14,000.47[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_47]With plans in hand, Tesla now had to choose where to build his new wirelessfacility. He flirted with the idea of locating this laboratory near NiagaraFalls in order to transmit the excess power generated there, but he soon focusedon picking a location on the Atlantic coast near New York City. As rumors spreadthat Tesla was going to break ground on a new lab, he was approached by James S.Warden, a lawyer and banker from Ohio who had relocated to Suffolk County on thenorth shore of Long Island. Believing that a real-estate boom would follow therecent extension of the Long Island Railroad’s Northern Branch from PortJefferson to Wading River, Warden had purchased 1,600 acres of farmland near thetiny village of Woodville Landing. Warden’s property was located sixty-fivemiles from New York City and could be reached by fast train in one-and-a-halfhours. Hoping that it might be attractive to New Yorkers as a summer retreat,Warden christened his property Wardenclyffe.image [Images/pg_335.jpg]FIGURE 14.1. Tesla’s laboratory at Wardenclyffe.Reproduced with permission from Christopher J. Bach, Architect.Anticipating that Tesla might employ between 2,000 and 2,500 workers, many ofwhom would need houses, Warden offered Tesla 200 acres for his laboratory acrossfrom the train station. Tesla accepted Warden’s offer in August 1901 and beganconstruction the following month. Tesla made regular trips out to the site,arriving by train at 11 am and staying until 3:30 pm, in order to superviseconstruction. On these inspection trips, he was frequently accompanied by aSerbian manservant who carried a hamper filled with food prepared by the chefsat the Waldorf-Astoria. Once construction was completed, Tesla stayed in arented cottage.48 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_48]Tesla divided the interior of his laboratory at Wardenclyffe into four largerooms: a machine shop, boiler room, engine and dynamo room, and electrical room.Located on the side of the building facing the railroad station, the machineshop was extensively equipped with a blacksmith’s forge, lathes, drill presses,a milling machine, and a planer (Figure 14.2 [023_Chapter023.xhtml#fig14_2]).Tesla installed these machine tools anticipating that he would need to fabricatemany of the components of his new system. In the boiler and engine rooms weretwo boilers that provided steam to a 400-horsepower Westinghouse reciprocatingsteam engine that was directly connected to a custom-designed dynamo. Inaddition, the engine room was equipped with another dynamo for lighting, an aircompressor, and water pumps. Surviving photographs indicate that there was abalcony level in the center of the building, above the machine shop. Inaddition, the photographs reveal that Tesla insisted not only on high-qualityapparatus but also on details such as handsome woodwork (Figure 14.3[023_Chapter023.xhtml#fig14_3]).image [Images/pg_336.jpg]FIGURE 14.2. The Machine Shop at Wardenclyffe.The balcony running across the center of the building can be seen on the upperleft side. From NTM.image [Images/pg_337.jpg]FIGURE 14.3. The Engine and Dynamo Room at Wardenclyffe showing ornate woodworkon the mercury interrupter and control panels.The Westinghouse dynamo can be seen in the back. The staircase probablyconnected to the gallery or balcony that ran across the center of the building.From NTM.By far the most prominent space inside the laboratory was the electrical roomthat ran across the back of the building, on the side closest to the tower(Figure 14.4 [023_Chapter023.xhtml#fig14_4]). Here the equipment included fourmassive Westinghouse transformers that could operate at 60,000 volts, four largecapacitors, a motorized mercury rectifier, and a specially built control unit,which, according to Tesla, could “give every imaginable regulation that I wantedin my measurements and control of energy.” In the center of the room, Tesladisplayed dozens of pieces of experimental apparatus.49 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_49]A key feature of Wardenclyffe was the large tower located 350 feet from thelaboratory building (Figure 14.5 [023_Chapter023.xhtml#fig14_5]). Tesla knewthat the range of the plant was proportional to the size of the tower and hencedependent on the amount of money available: “If your capitalists are willing togo deep into their pockets, you can put up a tremendous antenna because … as Ipointed out in 1893, … the effects will be proportionate to the capital investedin that part.”50 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_50]image [Images/pg_338.jpg]FIGURE 14.4. The Electrical Room at Wardenclyffe showing apparatus on display.From NTM. In planning the tower, Tesla had to take into account two factors: the amount ofelectrical energy that could be stored in the elevated terminal and the lengthof the waves he hoped to transmit through the ground. In Colorado, Tesla hadused wooden balls sheathed in metal as his elevated terminal. At Wardenclyffe,he now wanted to vastly increase the amount of energy stored in the elevatedterminal so that he could transmit power around the world. “Drawing on an oldtruth which [was] recognized 200 years ago” in electrical science, Tesla knewthat it is possible to store more electrical charge on a sphere than on othergeometrical shapes; consequently, he planned that the tower at Wardenclyffe becrowned with a metal terminal with as large a radius of curvature as possibleand then studded on the surface with numerous hemispheres.51[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_51] (See Figure 14.6 [023_Chapter023.xhtml#fig14_6] for oneversion with hemispherical studs.) Toward this end, his initial sketches fromMay 1901 show a curved, adjustable cupola in the shape of a mushroom (Figure14.7 [023_Chapter023.xhtml#fig14_7]).image [Images/pg_339.jpg]FIGURE 14.5. The laboratory and tower at Wardenclyffe.The tower was located 350 feet away from the laboratory since Tesla calculatedthat, at that distance, it was unlikely that an electrical streamer could leapfrom the tower to the lab. From NTM.In terms of the wavelength, Tesla had learned in Colorado that the length of theconductor in the secondary of his magnifying transmitter should be one-quarterof the wavelength that one wanted to generate. Since he initially wanted totransmit power using low-frequency long waves on the order of 2,400 feet, Teslacalculated that his secondary—which would be housed in the Wardenclyffetower—should be 600 feet and, in turn, that would be the height of the tower. At600 feet, Tesla’s proposed tower would be two-thirds the size of the EiffelTower, and White estimated that it could cost $450,000.52[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_52]Alarmed by how much his tower would cost, Tesla asked Morgan in September 1901for more money.53 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_53] Morgan, however, refused to lend anymore money, and Tesla was forced to scale back his design. “One thing iscertain,” wrote Tesla to White, “we cannot build that tower as outlined. Icannot tell you how sorry I am, for my calculations show, that with such astructure I could reach across the Pacific.”54 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_54]image [Images/pg_340.jpg]FIGURE 14.6. Patent diagram for the Wardenclyffe Tower showing one version ofthe elevated terminal as well as the circuitry Tesla planned to use.Key:D is donut-shaped terminal studded with hemispheres PG is a source of electric current (probably a capacitor)C is the primary coil of the magnifying transmitterA is the secondary coil of the magnifying transmitterB is another coil connected to secondary coil AE is the ground connection.Tesla did not build a terminal on top of his tower in the donut form shown herebut rather used this form in his patent “to illustrate the principles.” See NT,Radio Testimony, 145. From NT, “Apparatus for Transmitting Electrical Energy,”US Patent 1,119,732 (filed 18 Jan. 1902, granted 1 Dec. 1914).image [Images/pg_341.jpg]FIGURE 14.7. The tower at Wardenclyffe showing hemispherical terminal on top.From KSP, Smithsonian Institution. Although he considered using two or three smaller towers together, Tesla settledon a smaller design topped with a single large hemisphere fashioned out of steelgirders (Figure 14.7 [023_Chapter023.xhtml#fig14_7]). Tesla planned that thisterminal be covered with copper plates and perhaps again studded with smallerhemispheres. Although the shape of the terminal had changed, it still possesseda large radius of curvature, which Tesla believed would enable him “to producewith this small plant [at Wardenclyffe] many times the effect that could beproduced by an ordinary plant of a hundred times the size.”55[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_55]Construction of the tower at Wardenclyffe began in November 1901, andphotographs indicate that the structure was in place by September 1902. Teslawas not able to complete the tower as quickly as he would have liked becauseMorgan apparently delayed paying the final installment of $50,000 by twomonths.56 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_56]One of the challenges in building the tower was that no matter what the shape ofthe terminal on top, it was extremely heavy; the final hemispherical version was68 feet (20.7 meters) in diameter and weighed 55 tons. In addition to theweight, the terminal also had a large surface area so that it functioned like asail in response to the winds coming off Long Island Sound. To support theweight of the terminal and offset the forces of the wind meant building a largeand strong tower. To achieve this strength, White resorted to an octagonal formthat gradually tapered upward. Since the terminal had to be insulated from theground, the tower could not be constructed using iron or steel girders and Whiteinstead used unfinished pine timber. Top to bottom, the Wardenclyffe tower rose187 feet (57 meters) and could be seen from New Haven, Connecticut, across thesound.57 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_57]While the tower was certainly imposing—a reporter from the New York Times calledit “very ‘stagey’ and picturesque”—even more impressive were the well andtunnels beneath it.58 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_58] Because Tesla intended totransmit electric power through the ground, it was essential that his system“get a grip of the earth, otherwise it cannot shake the earth. It has to have agrip on the earth so that the whole of this globe can quiver, and to do that it[was] necessary to carry out a very expensive construction.”59[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_59] The ground connection in Colorado Springs had consistedof several metal plates buried in the ground outside; at Wardenclyffe, Tesladecided that he needed to make a stronger connection with the water table belowthe tower. To accomplish this, Tesla sank a ten-by-twelve foot well that wentdown 120 feet, well below the water table. To provide access to the well, therewas “a wooden affair very much like the companionway on an ocean steamer” at thebase of the tower and a circular staircase to the bottom.60[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_60]While one end of the magnifying transmitter’s secondary coil was connected tothe extra coil and then to the elevated terminal at the top of the tower, theother end of the transmitter’s secondary coil was grounded (see Figure 14.6[023_Chapter023.xhtml#fig14_6]). To make this ground connection between themagnifying transmitter at the base of the tower and the bottom of the well,Tesla placed “a big shaft again through which the current was to pass, and thisshaft was so figured in order to tell exactly where the nodal point is, so thatI could calculate every point of distance. For instance I could calculateexactly the size of the earth or the diameter of the earth and measure itexactly within four feet with that machine.”61 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_61]At the bottom of the well, Tesla completed the ground connection by linking themetal shaft that came down from the magnifying transmitter with an elaboratesystem of horizontal pipes. As he explained, “the real expensive work was toconnect that central part [i.e., the metal shaft] with the earth, and there Ihad special machines rigged up which would push the iron pipe, one length afteranother, and I pushed these iron pipes, I think sixteen of them, three hundredfeet, and then the current through these pipes takes hold of the earth.”62[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_62] Tesla used compressed air to drive these pipes into theearth, and so he placed a compressor in the laboratory’s engine room andtransmitted the compressed air out to the well via a special pipeline that ranalongside the electrical conduit.One newspaper reported that at the bottom of the well, Tesla planned to keep thewater warm, perhaps hoping that this would improve the connection with theearth.63 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_63] In addition, he had workmen dig fourstone-lined tunnels, each a hundred feet long, from the bottom of the well, eachof which gradually sloped upward to the surface. At the end of each tunnel therewas a brick igloo-like exit.64 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_64] It is not clear whatrole these tunnels played in Tesla’s overall plan.HOW DID TESLA THINK WARDENCLYFFE WOULD OPERATE?As construction continued at Wardenclyffe into 1902, Tesla began to see that thedevelopment of wireless power would involve several distinct steps. As heexplained to Morgan, these steps would consist of: “(1) the transmission ofminute amounts of energy and the production of feeble effects, barelyperceptible by sensitive devices; (2) the transmission of notable amounts ofenergy dispensing with the necessity of sensitive devices and enabling thepositive operation of any kind of apparatus requiring a small amount of power;and (3) the transmission of power in amounts of industrial significance. Withthe completion of my present undertaking the first step will be made.”65[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_65] So, given this development plan, how did Tesla plan touse Wardenclyffe to transmit power?Although Tesla left no complete description of how the Wardenclyffe stationoperated, all indications are that he planned to run the station in a mannersimilar to how he ran his system at Colorado Springs, which was based on theprinciples in the fundamental patents he had filed in 1897 (see Figure 12.11[021_Chapter021.xhtml#fig12_11]).66 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_66]At Wardenclyffe, the boilers produced steam for the Westinghouse combinationsteam engine and AC dynamo. Current from the dynamo was then stepped up to44,000 volts by the four transformers in the electrical room that were arrangedto deliver four-phase power. Tesla used this high-voltage current to charge fourlarge capacitors in the room, and he regulated the frequency of the current byusing several variable inductance coils, resistance boxes, and a largemercury-arc interrupter. With these controls, he could vary the frequency from200,000 down to 1,000 cycles per second, and he could produce a continuous trainof undamped waves.67 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_67]This high-voltage, high-frequency current was conducted out to the tower viacables in a special underground conduit. As shown in Figure 14.6[023_Chapter023.xhtml#fig14_6], Tesla installed his magnifying transmitter atthe base of the tower. Although the primary and secondary coils were smaller indiameter than their counterparts in Colorado, the extra coil appears to havebeen much longer. To connect the extra coil to the elevated terminal, Tesla useda large metal shaft. While he was primarily concerned with using the magnifyingtransmitter to broadcast power, Tesla could send telephone or telegraph messagesby connecting either a microphone or a telegraph key to the transmitter’sprimary coil “such that by speaking into it, or actuating it by hand orotherwise, variations in the intensity of the waves are produced.”68[029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_68] Tesla estimated that the Wardenclyffe magnifyingtransmitter generated 200 kilowatts.69 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_69]Operating at this level of power, Tesla hoped that the magnifying transmitterwould be able, via the well below the tower, to “get a grip of the earth” andset up a stationary current wave in the earth’s crust. To conduct these currentwaves from the secondary of the magnifying transmitter into the ground, Teslaused another large metal shaft that extended from the base of the tower to thebottom of the well, and from there, the waves traveled into the Earth via thesixteen horizontal pipes.Tesla believed that this current wave produced by his magnifying transmitterwould travel through the Earth to a point opposite Wardenclyffe and reflect backon itself; if this wave was at the resonant frequency of the earth, then thereflected wave would be in phase with the original wave and thus establish astationary wave. Based on measurements he made in Colorado, Tesla calculatedthat the lowest resonant frequency of the Earth was 6 Hz. Modern theory predictsthis frequency to be 10.5 Hz (neglecting losses), and actual measurements give aresonant peak at approximately 8 Hz, suggesting that Tesla was on the righttrack in terms of his calculations.70 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_70]With the Earth humming at its electromagnetic resonant frequency, Tesla believedthat power and messages could be picked up anywhere on the earth’s surface byconnecting a receiver to the ground. While energy moved from the magnifyingtransmitter to the receivers around the world via the stationary wave set up inthe earth, Tesla anticipated the circuit in his system would be completed byhaving elevated terminals of some sort on both the transmitter and receivers. Aswe have seen, the elevated terminal at Wardenclyffe was designed to hold anenormous amount of electrical charge. Prior to going to Colorado, Tesla insistedthat the return circuit involved a current moving through the atmosphere (seeChapter 12 [021_Chapter021.xhtml]), but while he was working at Wardenclyffe henever offered a clear explanation as to what kind of return electricalconnection he expected to make between the receiver and transmitter in order tocomplete the circuit. Drawing on ideas that Tesla later put forth concerningparticle beams (see Chapter 16 [025_Chapter025.xhtml]), some Tesla fans havespeculated that he created a return circuit by using either X-rays or a laser tocreate a conducting path from the Wardenclyffe tower to the ionosphere, notingthat there was a four-foot-wide hole in the top of the elevated terminal so thatTesla could have easily beamed the rays skyward.71 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_71]Meanwhile, other Tesla specialists have been able to transmit power through theEarth for short distances using magnifying transmitters, but they have not beenable to settle on an explanation for what happens in the return circuit that canbe related to modern electrodynamic theory.72 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_72]As his fundamental patents suggest, Tesla initially thought that the receiverwould need to be a tower similar in size to the transmitter (see Figure 12.11[021_Chapter021.xhtml#fig12_11]). However, at some point in his work atWardenclyffe, he decided that a large receiving tower was not necessary and thatmessages and power could be picked up by using smaller devices. Instead, he nowproposed that homes be fitted out with a ground connection and small elevatedterminal so that they could receive the power necessary to illuminate hisvacuum-tube lamps. He also designed a combination receiver and clock that wouldbe powered by wireless energy and hence receive a precise time signal, notingthat “[t]he idea of impressing upon the earth American time is fascinating andvery likely to become popular.”73 [029_BM029.xhtml#fnt_73]In many ways, Wardenclyffe was the fulfillment of Tesla’s dreams. For nearly adecade he had been planning in his imagination a system for broadcasting poweraround the world, and now that system was taking shape in the real world. Teslawas effectively assembling the network of people, ideas, money, and resourcesneeded to get ahead—and stay ahead—of Marconi.But would the system at Wardenclyffe actually work? To some extent, I don’tthink Tesla was at all worried as he had full confidence in his abilities as aninventor; if he could imagine Wardenclyffe working, then it was sure to work.Moreover, by the end of 1901, he had all the trappings—the illusions—of success.As long as he lived like a millionaire at the Waldorf, had the support of J. P.Morgan, got ample press coverage, and was building an impressive station, thenall would be right. The illusions confirmed the ideals that Tesla saw in hisimagination."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEENTHE DARK TOWER(1901–1905)To achieve a great result is one thing, to achieve it at theright moment is another.Tesla to J. P. Morgan, 13 Oct ober 1904Blindsided by Marconi,DOUBLE-CROSSED BY MARTINThrough the fall of 1901, as Tesla supervised construction of his laboratory andtower at Wardenclyffe, he was confident that he was close to success. As hegaily wrote to Katharine Johnson on 13 October 1901:13 is my lucky number and so I know you will comply with my wish … [for you to]come to the Waldorf. And if you do—when I transmit my wireless messages acrossseas and continents you will get the finest bonnet ever made [even] if it breaksme.…I have ordered a simple lunch and you must come en masse. We must exhibitHobson.… I know he likes me better than you.1 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_1]At the same time, Tesla assured Morgan that he was making progress. Summarizinghis work for the Great Man in November, he confidently stated that his latestpatents covered the production of “electrical effects of virtually unlimitedpower, not obtainable in any other ways heretofore known.” Moreover, his patentscovered techniques for highly efficient transmission. While other transmissionmethods suffered losses proportional to the square of the distance covered,Tesla claimed that his losses were significantly less and only in simpleproportion to the distance. “This feature alone,” reported Tesla, “bars allcompetition.”2 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_2]But the competition, namely Marconi, was hardly deterred by such claims. As wesaw in Chapter 12 [021_Chapter021.xhtml], Marconi had transmitted messagesacross the English Channel in March 1899, prompting Tesla to take up hisexperiments in Colorado Springs. Seven months later, Marconi had come to NewYork and used his apparatus to provide reports from the America’s Cup yachtraces, hoping to secure contracts from the New York newspapers or the U.S. Navy.Unsuccessful in getting a contract with the navy, Marconi returned to Englandand resumed work on increasing transmission distance as well as on developing away to tune his transmitters and receivers so that they operated on a particularfrequency. By early 1900 he could cover distances up to 185 miles, and hesecured a British patent (No. 7777 of 1900) for a system of using speciallywound jiggers (or coils) in his antenna circuits that permitted tuning.3[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_3]While Marconi publicly insisted that it was not yet possible to transmitmessages wirelessly across the Atlantic, privately he had decided that he shouldtry to achieve this goal as soon as possible. Marconi came to this decisionbecause he was worried about the situation of his business. Despite its bestefforts, Marconi’s Wireless Telegraph and Signal Company had yet to sign a majorcontract with the British or American navy, the Post Office, or the marineinsurance group, Lloyd’s of London. Though Marconi stock was being bid upspeculatively by London investors, the meager equipment sales nonetheless meantthat the company was running out of capital. To solve these problems, Marconiargued that what was needed was a dramatic demonstration of the potential of hiswireless system; if he could span the Atlantic, not only could his companyestablish a monopoly on ship-to-shore communications, it could also startcompeting with the profitable cable message business. Although the company’sdirectors initially objected to his bold plan, Marconi was able to convince themthat transatlantic communication was feasible, and in July 1900 the board ofdirectors gave him the go-ahead.To undertake the “great thing” (Marconi’s term for transmitting across theAtlantic), Marconi quietly established new stations.4 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_4] InEngland, he set up a station at Poldhu in Cornwall and in America he built astation on Cape Cod at South Wellfleet. At each station, he constructed a hugecircular antenna comprised of twenty two-hundred-foot masts. While scouting outlocations in Cape Cod in early 1901, Marconi heard rumors about Tesla’splans—perhaps that Tesla was getting support from Morgan—and this news promptedhim to step up his efforts.5 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_5]To span the Atlantic, Marconi realized that he needed to scale up his system,not only in terms of the size of the antenna arrays but the amount of poweremployed by the transmitter. Up to 1900, Marconi had relied on smalltransmitters that used induction coils and batteries; to reach across theAtlantic, however, he needed a much more powerful transmitter. To increase thepower, Marconi looked to the company’s new scientific consultant, John AmbroseFleming. The Pender Professor of Electrical Technology at University College,London, Fleming had met Tesla during his visit to London in 1892. Completelyfamiliar with power engineering, Fleming designed a transmitter with a25-kilowatt AC generator, 20,000-volt transformers, and high-tension capacitors.Not only was this electrical equipment similar in size to the apparatus Teslahad at Wardenclyffe, but Fleming arranged the circuit in a manner similar towhat Tesla used with his magnifying transmitter in both Colorado andWardenclyffe. Using this new system designed by Fleming, Marconi and hisassociates were able to generate at Poldhu foot-long sparks that were as thickas a man’s wrist.6 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_6]Fleming installed this new transmitter in August 1901, but before it could betested, gale-force winds blew down the antenna array in Poldhu. Marconi quicklyreplaced this array, but then another storm destroyed the antenna array on CapeCod. Still determined to conduct a transatlantic test, Marconi, George Kemp, andP. W. Paget sailed to St. John’s, Newfoundland, at the end of November. Marconichose St. John’s because it was the closest spot in North America to England(2,200 miles or 3,500 kilometers). Before leaving England, Marconi instructedthe operators at Poldhu to transmit “SSS” in Morse code between 3:00 and 6:00 pmeach day from 11 December on.Marconi and his associates arrived in St. John’s on 6 December 1901. Using anaerial suspended from a kite flying in a winter storm, both Marconi and Kempheard the “SSS” signal on 12 and 13 December while using a sensitive telephonereceiver. On 14 December, Marconi issued a press announcement, and hisachievement was extensively covered in the Sunday newspapers on the followingday.7 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_7]In the New York Times, news of Marconi’s transatlantic signals dominated thefront page. Calling his achievement “the most wonderful scientific developmentof recent times,” the paper included a biography of Marconi. Since Tesla had“hinted at the possibility of ‘telegraphing through the air and earth,’ ” thepaper asked Tesla for his impressions. Tesla not only reminded the paper that hehad discussed the possibility of wireless telegraphy years earlier but suggestedthat the transmission of power was much more important than being able to send afew short messages. To round out its coverage, the New York Times gave the lastword to T. C. Martin, who, as editor of Electrical World, could put Marconi’sachievement into context. Anxious to praise Marconi as the newest technologicalwunderkind, Martin noted that he was both surprised and pleased that Marconi hadsucceeded in spanning the Atlantic. With regard to his former friend Tesla,Martin pointed out that although Tesla had envisioned wireless telegraphy, heunfortunately had not been able to follow through and be the first to span theAtlantic. As Martin observed, “In a book which I published some eight years agoon Tesla’s work is embodied one of his lectures in which he gives wirelesstelegraphy considerable attention. He expressed his belief in the matter soclearly that he made up my mind for me. I am only sorry, therefore, that Mr.Tesla, who has given the matter so much thought and experimentation, and towhose initiative so much of the work is due, should not also have been able toaccomplish this wonderful feat.”8 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_8]Over the next several weeks, skeptics questioned whether Marconi had actuallyheard the three dots that made up an “S” in Morse code. As rival wirelessinventor Lee de Forest noted in his diary: “Signor Marconi has scored a shrewdcoup. Whether or not the three dots he heard came from England or, like thoseTesla heard, from Mars, if I am aught of a prophet we will hear of no moretrans-Atlantic messages for some time. In this art, as in all other inventions,advance will be by slow growth and evolution, not by magnificent bounds from 100to 2,000 miles.”9 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_9]Since Hertzian waves were supposed to travel in straight lines like light waves,wondered other scientists, how did the waves follow the curvature of the Earthand not just fly off into space? (We now attribute this to the fact that radiowaves bounce off the Heaviside-Kennelly layer in the ionosphere, but this layerwas not discovered until 1924.) Could Marconi and Kemp, anxious to hear thethree dots, have simply heard atmospheric crackling that they imagined to be thesignal from Poldhu? And note that there were no independent witnesses to theevent. The only two people to hear the signals were Marconi and his assistantKemp; indeed, the world had to accept Marconi’s word that he had heard a signalfrom across the Atlantic.10 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_10]But in spite of these doubts, Martin decided that Marconi was the man of thehour and that he should take “up the cudgels” on Marconi’s behalf and show thatMarconi was “not being a faker.” To do so, Martin arranged for the young Italianto be the guest of honor at the annual dinner of the American Institute ofElectrical Engineers (AIEE) on 13 January 1902. Having been president andtoastmaster at many AIEE events, Martin easily convinced the leadership of theinstitute to agree to honor Marconi. However, since not everyone believedMarconi’s claims, Martin found it difficult to get the engineering community tocome out for the dinner, and he was obliged to ask Elihu Thomson to lend hissupport to the event. As word spread that Thomson favored recognizing Marconi,Martin was able to fill the three hundred seats in the Astor Gallery of theWaldorf-Astoria Hotel.11 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_11]To make it a truly memorable evening, Martin worked to ensure that everythinghighlighted Marconi’s achievement. The menu featured sketches of Marconiantennas on two lighthouses, signaling “S” in three dots all the way across theocean. At either end of the ballroom were hung two large tablets with “Poldhu”and “St. John’s,” in letters formed of electric lamps. Connecting the twotablets was a wire on which were inserted clusters of three lamps at intervals,designed to represent the three dots flashed across the Atlantic, and theselamps were flashed periodically during dinner.12 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_12]Although Tesla resided at the Waldorf, he could not bring himself to attend thedinner honoring Marconi and chose to be out of town that night. Noting hisabsence, toastmaster Martin read a letter in which Tesla congratulated Marconibut conspicuously left out any mention that a message had been sent across theAtlantic.After reading a few more letters of congratulation, Martin invited Marconi toaddress the group. Marconi outlined the achievements of his system sofar—seventy ships equipped with wireless and twenty shore stations in England.He described his experiments in Newfoundland, including the problems he hadfaced with flying kites in the wintry weather. After mentioning that he hopedthat wireless telegraphy would allow for cheaper messages than the existingundersea cables, Marconi concluded by raising a glass and toasting theinstitute.Marconi’s speech was followed by remarks from Thomson and Professor MichaelPupin of Columbia University. Both men emphasized that although the proof forMarconi’s achievement was limited, they accepted Marconi at his word since theyknew and trusted him. As Pupin put it, “[I]n scientific work we never believeanything until we see a demonstration of it. I believe that Sig. Marconi hastransmitted the famous three dots across the Atlantic, but I must say that Ibelieve him because I know him personally. If I did not know him personally, Iwould not believe him, because the proof which Signor Marconi has furnished isnot sufficiently strong from a purely scientific point of view; but knowing himpersonally as I do, I believe his statement.” Pupin further offered an analysisof Marconi’s work with electromagnetic waves, combining physics, mathematics,and engineering. In doing so, he included a swipe at Tesla for his ideas abouttransmitting signals through the earth:I also heard a man say, “Years ago I thought of transmitting wireless signals bythe wobbling of the charge of the earth.” Well, any one of us can think ofschemes like that; any one of us who has had any experience in inventing canthink of schemes like that as fast as you can write them down, for anybody knowsyou can transmit electrical waves to any distance, that is, mathematically andphysically perhaps. But how about the engineering side of it? I said to thisman, “Give me an engineering specification of your apparatus by means of whichyou intend to wobble the charge of the earth, and then I will believe you; notbefore.”Now this is what Signor Marconi has done: He has written out a specification forsetting up apparatus and wobbling the charge of the earth and transmitting thesignals between wires.13 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_13]Thanks to Martin’s efforts, the AIEE dinner helped establish Marconi as theinventor of wireless telegraphy in the public mind. Nevertheless, knowing thathis transatlantic effort in Newfoundland was not sufficient proof, Marconiundertook a second demonstration to prove his system. In February 1902 he sailedfrom England to America on the passenger ship Philadelphia, which was fitted outwith a Marconi wireless system. During the crossing, Marconi periodicallyreceived Morse code messages from Poldhu, and he invited the ship’s captain andchief officer to listen to the messages and note on a nautical chart the timeand location where they heard the messages. Much more than the signal receivedat Newfoundland, this witnessed chart from the Philadelphia documented thatMarconi had a system that could transmit across the Atlantic.14[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_14]COUNTERING WITH “WORLD TELEGRAPHY”With the newspapers filled with stories about Marconi, Tesla could not resisttaking a poke at his rival in print. When a reporter from the New York Sun askedif there was any similarity between his system and that of Marconi, Tesla smiledand said, “I respect rigorously the rights of others, and when I give my systemto the world I shall ask the entire technical profession to point to any featureof my system … which is not of my own creation. I admire skill and enterprise,and my best wishes for success accompany those who sell ready made shoes; but Imyself prefer not to use them. They are cheap, but they raise corns andbunions.”15 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_15] In doing so, Tesla was taking the highground in that he would let his fellow experts decide who was the originalcreator of the new wireless technology. At the same time, the metaphor ofready-made shoes is revealing: not only did Tesla have higher standards thanMarconi (in real life, Tesla insisted on bespoke shoes), but he also suggestedthat Marconi’s choice of selling cheaper shoes would result in problems (i.e.,corns and bunions) for the user.But while he could poke fun at Marconi in the press, Tesla realized that heneeded to offer some explanation to Morgan. In early January 1902 Tesla wroteMorgan, beginning with an assessment of the equipment developed by Marconi withFleming’s help:I have carefully examined the records and find that, in what the Marconi-FlemingSyndicate are now using, not a vestige of their old patented apparatus is left.…All the essential elements of these [new] arrangements … are broadly anticipatedby my patents of 1896 and 1897.… They have adopted my resonating transmitterwhich magnifies enormously the currents conveyed, and in this connection mygrounded receiving circuit or “multiplier,” my transforming circuits at bothends, my “Tesla coil” and my modern type of the same, the “Tesla transformer,”my system of dependent tuned circuits and numerous minor improvements. Nothingcan be done just now, but as the water finds its level, so every one will gethis due.Rather than be defensive about Marconi, though, Tesla chose to be upbeat andbold. “I need not tell you,” he continued,that I have worked as hard as I have dared without collapsing. I have examinedand rejected hundreds of experiments aiming at improvement in every way and atthe attainment of the best result with the capital at command, and I am glad tosay, that by slow and steady advances I have managed to contrive a machine, withwhich I shall produce an electrical disturbance of sufficient intensity to beperceptible over the whole earth. It will be feeble at some places and I fear,unsuitable for practical use, but I am sure that, when my apparatus is … in [a]condition to deliver its maximum energy—at the rate of one millionhorse-power—with the first throw of the switch, I shall send a greeting to thewhole world, and for this great triumph I shall ever be grateful to you!16[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_16]But more than just send out a signal, Tesla now introduced Morgan to a newbusiness plan. Marconi might choose to cover yacht races and provideship-to-shore communications, but Tesla dismissed these applications asunprofitable and hardly worthy of support from a Great Man. Indeed, as he laterexplained to Morgan, “When I discovered, rather accidentally, that others … weresecretly employing [my apparatus], I found myself confronted with whollyunforeseen circumstances.… I could not develop the business slowly in agrocery-shop fashion. I could not report yacht races or signal incomingsteamers. There was no money in this. This was no business for a man in yourposition and importance.”17 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_17]Instead, Tesla proposed to Morgan a plan for a “World Telegraphy System” inwhich a number of transmitting stations would collect news and broadcast tocustomers via individual receivers. As he boasted to Morgan,The fundamental idea underlying this system is to employ a few power plants,preferably located near the large centers of civilization and each capable oftransmitting a message to the remotest regions of the globe. These plants are tobe connected by wires, cables and any other means with the civilized centersnearby, and as fast as they receive the news, they pour them [sic] into theground, through which they spread instantly. The whole earth is like a brain, asit were, and the capacity of this system is infinite, for the energy received onevery few square feet of ground is sufficient to operate an instrument, and thenumber of devices which can be so actuated is, for all practical purposesinfinite. You see, Mr. Morgan, the revolutionary character of this idea, itscivilizing potency, its tremendous money-making power.18 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_18]Although Tesla was certainly not thinking about the computers, software, andpacket-switching that were necessary to create the World Wide Web, hisfundamental idea that all news should be collected and disseminated around theworld is suggestive of the beliefs that came to underlie the World Wide Web inthe 1990s. “The World-Wide Web (W3),” noted media scholars Noah Wardrip-Fruinand Nick Montfort, “was developed to be a pool of human knowledge, which wouldallow collaborators in remote sites to share their ideas and all aspects of acommon project.”19 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_19]Tesla believed that he and Morgan would make money by manufacturing receivers,and he envisioned several versions. For instance, the receiver could be aprinter that would produce a newspaper for customers at home, and in so doinghis world telegraphy system would “do away not only with the cables but with thenewspapers also, for how can journals as present [continue to] exist wheneverybody can have a cheap machine printing its own news?” At the same time,Tesla was also developing a receiver with a loudspeaker that would permit him tospeak Morgan’s “name in a telephone, and it will be repeated loud everywhere inthe tone of my voice. This, I may tell you now, I have since long ago conceivedas a means of acquitting myself fittingly of my debt to you.”20[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_20]image [Images/PG_356_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 15.1. “Tesla’s Wireless Transmitting Tower, 185 feet high, atWardenclyffe, N. Y., from which the city of New York will be fed withelectricity, and by means of which the camperout [sic], the yachtsman and summerresort visitor will be able to communicate instantly with friends at home.”From “Tesla’s Tower,” New York American, 22 May 1904 in TC 17:11.But by far Tesla’s most imaginative idea for a receiver was a handheld deviceconnected to a vertical wire on a short pole or even a lady’s parasol so that itcould pick up voice messages anywhere in the world (Figure 15.1[024_Chapter024.xhtml#fig15_1]). As Tesla promised in 1904, “An inexpensivereceiver, not bigger than a watch, will enable him to listen anywhere, on landor sea, to a speech delivered, or music played in some other place, however,distant.”21 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_21] Here in the opening years of the twentiethcentury, we see Tesla conjuring up a vision of a device much like a transistorradio or cell phone, with the promise of providing instantaneous access toinformation anytime, anywhere.In dreaming of a receiver that would be used by everyone, Tesla was an earlyharbinger of the consumer culture of the twentieth century. As engineers andinventors perfected the machinery for the mass production of goods, astutemanagers realized that the challenge would be to stimulate demand for the hugevolume of goods produced. In other words, if they were going to take advantageof the economies of scale that came with mass production, industrialists wouldhave to create products that would be desired and used by millions of consumers.A classic example of a mass-produced product for this new consumer culture wasthe Model T; as Henry Ford explained, the Model T was intended to be “a motorcar for the great multitude … large enough for the family but small enough forthe individual to run and care for … so low in price that no man making a goodsalary will be unable to own one.”22 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_22] Just as Fordenvisioned everyone having a Model T, so Tesla believed that everyone would soonhave one of his wireless receivers.Viewed from the perspective of the twenty-first century, it may seem obviousthat a consumer culture would grow out of mass production and that a significantportion of the global economy would depend on the mass consumption of productslike cell phones, iPods, and laptop computers. Yet this consumer revolution wasnot entirely obvious in the opening years of the twentieth century and, indeed,must have looked alien to the leaders of industrial and producer culture. Forinstance, believing that money was to be made by selling inventions and machinesto companies and not to individual consumers, Edison found it difficult after1900 to understand how it was that the motion-picture industry was shifting awayfrom the improvement of cameras and projectors to the development of new typesof movies.23 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_23] Likewise, Morgan must have had a hard timemaking sense of Tesla’s vision of selling millions of receivers. Morgan had madehis money in developing the railroads and the steel industry—the very heart of aproducer culture. Much as he could never understand the rise of the automobileindustry (and hence never invested in it), it is likely that he had littleappreciation for Tesla’s vision of world telegraphy. Tesla was unfortunatelytrying to use a consumer-culture argument to convince someone steeped inproducer culture.As exciting as world telegraphy was to him, Tesla did not neglect his vision ofbroadcasting power since “the transmission of energy in appreciable amounts,enabling at any point of the globe the positive operation of innumerablecontrivances,” would have a tremendous effect on the advancement of humanity.While the potential of broadcasting power could be demonstrated with theWardenclyffe plant, large-scale transmission would require a bigger station,preferably located near a source of cheap electric power such as Niagara Falls.Of course Tesla would need more money, but once again, he was confident that thework could be done quickly. As he explained to Morgan, “To do this, a plant offive thousand horse-power would be needed. This power could be had at Niagara.…The preliminary work, the plans, estimates, options, etc.,—all the work onpaper, would not involve an expenditure of more than twenty-five thousanddollars. By the time my present plant is completed and I have madedemonstrations to your satisfaction, all this preparatory work could be doneand, if you should elect so, before the next winter the large plant could be putin operation.” Tesla felt strongly that a demonstration of the wirelesstransmission of power was the best way to respond to Marconi’s boldappropriation of his techniques; as he wrote to Morgan some months later, “Theonly way to fully protect myself was to develop apparatus of such power as toenable me to control effectively the vibrations throughout the globe.”24[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_24]Lest Morgan hesitate to support either world telegraphy or a new powertransmission station at Niagara, Tesla closed his January 1902 letter with anegotistical flourish, reminding the financier that he was dealing with a geniuswho brought about technological revolutions: “Now, Mr. Morgan, am I backed bythe greatest financier of all times? And shall I lose great triumphs and animmense fortune because I need a sum of money!! Is it not due to the honor ofthis country, that it be identified with this achievement[?] Have I notcontributed to its greatness and prestige and have my inventions not exircised[sic] a revolutionary effect upon its industries[?] These are not my claims, Mr.Morgan, only my credentials.”25 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_25]Tesla’s business proposals landed on Morgan’s desk just as he was enteringanother extremely busy period; as Henry Adams observed in April 1902, “PierpontMorgan … is carrying loads that [would] stagger the strongest nerves.” Duringthe first months of 1902, Morgan was organizing the International MercantileMarine, which brought together five transatlantic steamship lines to create afleet of 120 ships; it was Morgan’s hope that he could create rational order fortransatlantic shipping just as he had done for the railroads. From ships, Morganmoved to agricultural equipment, and in the summer of 1902 he and his partnersorganized International Harvester by merging the McCormick Harvesting MachineCompany with four other firms. In addition, Morgan found that his newly formedUnited States Steel was undercapitalized, and he spent much of the year tryingto raise funds for it.26 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_26]Morgan’s biggest headache in 1902, however, came from Washington. The previoussummer, Morgan had fought off a hostile takeover bid for the Northern PacificRailroad, and to prevent future raids he organized the Northern SecuritiesCompany. As a holding company, Northern Securities brought together the NorthernPacific, the Great Northern Railroad, and the Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy sothat these major trunk lines could coordinate operations. Because NorthernSecurities now controlled nearly all of the rail traffic from Minnesota toWashington State, its creation prompted a public outcry. In response, PresidentTheodore Roosevelt decided to go after Northern Securities in order todemonstrate that he wasn’t afraid to challenge big business.Since these projects demanded most of his attention, Morgan does not seem tohave been particularly concerned about Tesla. Indeed, the Great Man includedTesla as a guest at an extravagant luncheon honoring Prince Henry, the brotherof Kaiser Wilhelm II.27 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_27] In the meantime, Tesla pushedahead on his own. In February 1902 he hired Lowenstein back to help withWardenclyffe. To strengthen his patent portfolio, Tesla had his attorney ParkerPage vigorously pursue an interference case with Reginald Fessenden concerningTesla’s patent applications for tuning, and Tesla provided testimony during thesummer to support his case.28 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_28] He also started planning afactory at Wardenclyffe since it was “now imperative to provide facilities formanufacturing a great number of receiving apparatus.”29 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_29]Before leaving on his annual trip to Europe in April 1902, Morgan met with Teslaand told the Wizard that he did not want to get involved personally withbuilding a new transmission station at Niagara or a new factory formanufacturing receivers. However, although he did not want to invest his ownmoney, Morgan indicated that he would be willing to help Tesla raise money byreorganizing the Nikola Tesla Company and issuing new securities.30[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_30]In response to this “favorable answer received,” Tesla spent the summer of 1902working on two tasks. First, since Morgan would not support a new plant atNiagara, Tesla decided to push his system to see how much power he couldgenerate. To pursue this task, Tesla and his secretary, Scherff, moved out toWardenclyffe for the summer. “My efforts will be in large measure rewarded,” hereported back to Morgan, “for by straining every part of my machinery to theutmost I shall be able to reach what I consider almost the maximum possibleperformance with the power available—a rate of energy delivery of 10 millions ofhorsepower—more than twice that of the entire Fall of Niagara. Thus the wavesgenerated by my transmitter will be the greatest spontaneous manifestation ofenergy on Earth.”31 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_31]Pleased with the potential results of pushing Wardenclyffe to the limit (andthereby putting Marconi in his place), Tesla turned to identifying new potentialinvestors. Drawing on his contacts in the upper echelons of New York society,Tesla brought together a group of subscribers, “all people of high standing.”Knowing that Morgan wished to continue to keep his involvement a secret, Teslawas careful not to mention the Great Man to this group.32[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_32]In late September 1902, Tesla and Morgan met to map out a plan to raise capitalby creating a new company. Here Morgan was genuinely helping Tesla since thefundamental business of an investment banker is to organize companies and issuesecurities. Tesla’s new company was to be capitalized at $10 million and wouldissue $5 million in bonds, $2.5 million in preferred stock, and $2.5 million incommon stock. To secure the working capital needed to equip a new factory formanufacturing Tesla’s inventions (presumably receivers), 50% of the bond andstock issue would be offered for sale to outside investors. Another 40% of thebonds and stocks would be given to Tesla and his old associates in the NikolaTesla Company since the company had “incurred great expenses perfecting theinventions.” For his part, Tesla planned to sell some of his bonds in order torepay the $150,000 advanced by Morgan, but he also intended to give one-quarterof his interest to an associate (probably Lowenstein) “in whose ability andintegrity I believe, and who is to unite all of his energies with mine, to bringto the greatest possible success this undertaking, in which our honor will beengaged.” The remaining 10% of the new bonds and shares was to remain unissued,but Morgan thought that he should get one-third of these remaining securitiesfor the patents that had been assigned to him by Tesla. As it did with otherstock issues, J. P. Morgan & Company would presumably make its money by taking acommission on the bonds and shares it sold to outside investors.33[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_33]With this plan in place, Tesla resumed his efforts to secure money from the NewYork social elite. Offering shares at $175 each, he approached several prominentwomen, including Mary Mapes Dodge, Mrs. E. F. Winslow, and Caroline ClausenSchwarz, the wife of toy-store magnate, F.A.O. Schwarz. Unfortunately, Tesla gotfew takers among the elite, who seemed to have regarded investing in hisenterprise as a risky proposition. “I am tired of speaking to pusillanimouspeople,” fumed Tesla, “who become scared when I ask them to invest $5000 and getthe diarrhoea [sic] when I call for ten.”34 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_34]Unable to attract investors but determined to push ahead at Wardenclyffe, Teslaraised $33,000 by selling personal property and borrowed another $10,000 from abank in Port Jefferson, the next town over from Wardenclyffe. He also tappedScherff for small loans, which eventually amounted to thousands. Nevertheless,the bills continued to mount—Tesla owed Westinghouse $30,000 for equipment, hehad not paid the telephone company for running a special line out to thelaboratory, and James Warden was suing him for not paying the property taxes.Worried that news of his financial difficulties would scare off potentialinvestors, Tesla told Scherff to keep the reporters away.35[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_35]As his hopes for raising money by selling shares evaporated, Tesla blamed Morganfor his problems. Tesla felt that Morgan’s various ventures had createdturbulence on Wall Street and inflation generally. The stock market, respondingto a nationwide coal strike, was very jittery during the fall of 1902, promptingMorgan to join with other bankers to create a $50 million fund to shore up themarket in case of an emergency. In April 1903, the Federal Court of Appeals inSt. Paul ruled that Morgan’s Northern Securities Company was an illegalcombination, and this announcement nearly caused a panic on the New York StockExchange. Writing a week after this crisis on Wall Street, Tesla complained,“Mr. Morgan, you have raised great waves in the industrial world and some havestruck my little boat. Prices have gone up in consequence, twice, perhaps threetimes higher than they were and there were expensive delays, mostly as a resultof activities you excited.”36 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_36]Nevertheless, Tesla hoped the Great Man would bail him out. “Financially, I amin a dreadful fix,” he admitted to Morgan in early July 1903. “But if I cancomplete this work, I can readily show that by my wireless system power can betransmitted in any amount, to any desired distance and with high economy. Of thethree hundred horse-power developed by my oscillator on Long Island, two hundredand seventy-five,—perhaps a little more—can be recovered at the greatestdistance in Australia.” Knowing that the transmission of power through the Earthfrom New York to Australia sounded fantastic, Tesla assured Morgan that it was agamble worth taking since this breakthrough would transform the world and Teslapossessed full control of the invention: “If I had told you such as this before,you would have fired me out of your office. Now you see, Mr. Morgan, what I workfor. It means a great industrial revolution. It will be [the] one thing worthyof your attention, as I have always assured you. There is no incertitude aboutthis, it is an absolute. My patents confer a monopoly. Will you help me or letmy great work—almost complete—go to pots?”37 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_37]Although Morgan was immersed in reorganizing the International Merchant Marinetrust (which also had run into political and financial difficulties), he agreedto meet with Tesla. However, following this conference, Morgan decided that hewould no longer support Tesla. On 17 July 1903 he sent Tesla a terse note: “Ihave received your letter of 16th inst., and in reply would say that I shouldnot feel disposed at present to make any further advances.”38[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_38]Angry, Tesla expressed his frustration by cranking up the power at Wardenclyffeand hurling lightning bolts. As the New York Sun reported, Tesla’s neighborswitnessed “all sorts of lightning … from the tall tower.… For a time the air wasfilled with blinding streaks of electricity which seemed to shoot off into thedarkness on some mysterious errand. The display continued until after midnight.”When asked to explain these flashes, Tesla replied, “It is true that some ofthem have had to do with wireless telegraphy” and that if the local people “hadbeen awake instead of asleep, at other times [they] would have seen evenstranger things. Some day, but not at this time, I shall make an announcement ofsomething that I never once dreamed of.”39 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_39]THE WIRELESS SPECULATIVE BUBBLESo why did Morgan decide to stop supporting Tesla in 1903? If Morgan hadprovided the Wizard with perhaps another $100,000—the cost of one Old Masterpainting—Tesla could have tested his ideas, and the patents he had assigned toMorgan might have become highly valuable.40 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_40] Morgan couldhave profitably sold or licensed these patents to someone else who could exploitthis technology commercially.Morgan certainly did not need an elaborate reason for refusing to continue tosupport Tesla. He had already sunk $150,000 into the project and Tesla hadpromised in late 1900 to span the Atlantic in six to eight months and thePacific a year later. Two and a half years had now elapsed, Marconi hadtransmitted across the Atlantic, and Tesla had yet to provide any sort ofdemonstration of his system. Morgan could have easily concluded that Tesla wasnot a good risk.The explanation most frequently offered for Morgan’s decision to withdraw hissupport from Tesla was that Morgan had become concerned that Tesla had no planfor making money from wireless power and that he intended to give the power awayfor free. Perhaps the most colorful version of this story comes from AndrijaPuharich, an inventor and physician who conducted research in parapsychology:“Now, I always got this second hand; you won’t find it anywhere in print, butJack O’Neill gave me this information as the official biographer of NikolaTesla. He said that Bernard Baruch told J. P. Morgan, ‘Look, this guy is goingcrazy. What he is doing is, he wants to give free electrical power to everybodyand we can’t put meters on that. We are just going to go broke supporting thisguy.’ And suddenly, overnight, Tesla’s support was cut off, the work was neverfinished.”41 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_41] As we have seen, Tesla emphasized in hisletters to Morgan how he would use Wardenclyffe for communications and that heintended to make money by manufacturing and selling receivers. Though Tesla wasexcited about the prospect of transmitting power, his letters reveal that heknew that this was the harder idea to sell to Morgan.Instead, a more realistic explanation for Morgan’s withdrawal of support comesfrom Tesla himself. When testifying in 1916 about his wireless work, Teslarecalled that he had “excited the interest of a great man” and that he had begunmaking preparations “for a very big undertaking.” However, at the last minute,this patron had backed out, concerned that the wireless industry had entered a“phase of stock jobbing” or speculation. Consequently, the Great Man told Teslathat he “could not touch it with a 20-foot pole.” As we have seen, Teslareferred to Morgan as the Great Man in order to hide Morgan’s involvement.42[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_42]Indeed, there was a speculative bubble surrounding wireless in the first decadeof the twentieth century. As promising reports of Marconi’s demonstrationscirculated in 1900 and 1901, shady promoters such as G. P. Gehring and LancelotE. Pike turned from hawking questionable mining stocks to offering shares in newwireless companies. While Gehring bought up the rights to Amos Dolbear’stelephone patents from the 1880s to create the American Wireless Telephone andTelegraph Company, Pike promised quick money by buying stock in one of the manysubsidiaries of American Wireless. To give his scheme an air of credibility,Pike rented an elaborately furnished office in the same building in Manhattanthat housed the headquarters of the United States Steel Corporation, and thereany doubting investor could see the Dolbear instruments at work. Though Pikepromised to establish wireless service between New York and Philadelphia, henever bothered to do so and instead absconded with investors’ money.43[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_43]Pike’s shenanigans were only the opening round in the mania surroundingwireless, and far more worrisome for Tesla must have been the companies formedaround the inventions of Lee de Forest. The son of a Congregationalist ministerin Alabama, de Forest grew up determined to overcome his modest background.Following family tradition, he attended Yale. While studying physics there, deForest read Tesla’s biography and dreamed of becoming Tesla’s assistant. Withhelp from a classmate, Ernest K. Adams (the son of Edward Dean Adams), de Forestsecured an interview with Tesla in 1896, but Tesla turned him down. Undeterred,de Forest received his Ph.D. in 1899 (his dissertation was titled “TheReflection of Short Hertzian Waves from the Ends of Parallel Wires”), and heagain applied for a job in Tesla’s laboratory.44 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_44]After being turned down a second time by Tesla, de Forest started experimentingwhile working as a junior telephone engineer at Western Electric in Chicago.Since the filings in Marconi’s coherer had to be continually reset by tapping,de Forest worked on a detector that reset itself automatically. With the help oftwo colleagues in Chicago, de Forest invented an electrolytic responder in 1901,and he set out for New York to demonstrate his new invention during theAmerica’s Cup races and find financial backers.After being rejected by several investors, de Forest met Abraham S. White, apromoter who had made a fortune in real estate and hawking fireproof chemicals,in January 1902. White was clearly a master hustler, and one reporter describedhim thus: “White’s hair and mustache were flaming red; his eyes of china blue.He wore patent-leather shoes, a silk hat, a flower in his buttonhole, a handsomegold watch chain, a pear-shaped pearl scarfpin and a diamond ring that was nottoo big. He smoked corkscrew-shaped cigars which he handed out freely, was neverwithout a fat roll of $100 gold certificates, which he peeled off with the easyindifference of an actor handling stage money.”45 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_45]White was quick to appreciate the potential of de Forest’s responder andpromptly organized the American DeForest Wireless Telegraph Company. Capitalizedat $3 million, White served as president and de Forest as vice president andscientific director. To show off de Forest’s invention, White built a penthouselaboratory with glass walls on the roof of a building at 17 State Street at thefoot of Manhattan, a few blocks from Wall Street. Across New York harbor, asecond station was erected at the Castleton Hotel on Staten Island. Withpotential investors watching, de Forest would send and receive messages fromState Street to Staten Island, after which White would take the visitors tolunch. Over these meals, White would wax eloquent, sketching out for theinvestors a vision ofwireless stations all along the Eastern seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico, acrossthe continent from the snow-capped peaks of Alaska to Panama. Every ship thattouched American shores was to pay the De Forest Company tribute; the stationswere to compete with the telephone and telegraph. Wireless would span theAtlantic and Pacific and the cable would be supplanted.Subsidiary companies were to be established in Canada, England, Europe, Africa,the Orient, Australia, and South America. In reasonable time fifty suchsubsidiaries could be expected, all paying patent royalties to the Americanparent. Investors would buy millions of dollars of stock.…Warming up to his subject, White would take out a pencil and … calculate whatthe De Forest Company could earn in a year. Assuming only fifty ships equippedwith De Forest instruments in a year, at $5000 a ship, that was $250,000.Messages to and from these ships, another $250,000; transatlantic andtranspacific messages, together, $4,000,000 more. Then there were the “10,000islands in all the oceans”—what a blessing wireless would be to them! Addanother $500,000. Total, $5,000,000—that is, “conservatively speaking.”46[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_46]Enthralled by such prospects, investors snapped up de Forest stock, and Whiteproceeded to form subsidiary after subsidiary and to reorganize the parentcompany over and over, always inviting the current stockholders to be the firstto buy these new stock issues and thereby expand their holdings.47[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_47] White allowed de Forest to set up a laboratory and spendsome of the incoming cash on experiments. With this support, de Forest was ableto demonstrate his equipment to both the U.S. Army and Navy in 1903 and securecontracts from both branches.48 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_48]However, White reserved much of the income for continuing his promotionalefforts, which included a “wireless automobile” in February 1903. Equipped withde Forest transmitters, four of these vehicles cruised Wall Street, stoppingperiodically to collect stock prices from curb brokers that were thentransmitted to the brokerage houses as well as the offices of the Wall StreetJournal (see Figure 15.2 [024_Chapter024.xhtml#fig15_2]).49[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_49]Glancing out his office window, Morgan could not have failed to notice theDeForest Wireless automobiles creating a scene. Equally, his staff would haveundoubtedly kept him apprised of various speculative fads that came and wentamong investors. For Morgan, these fads were a nuisance since they revealed tothe public and the government the risky side of Wall Street. Such fads were aproblem not only because promoters such as Pike and White were raising morecapital than necessary and then not investing it in developing the company’sbusiness but also because stockholders were at risk of losing everything whenshares—purchased at premium prices—inevitably plummeted on the market. With theRoosevelt administration attacking Morgan’s Northern Securities Company andcomplaints about the shaky structure of International Mercantile Marine, Morganwould have hardly been in the mood in July 1903 to get further involved inTesla’s wireless venture. Morgan simply could not afford the risk of havinganything to do with these questionable activities in the emerging wirelessindustry. Given what White was doing with DeForest Wireless, we should not besurprised that Morgan would not want to touch Tesla’s venture with “a 20-footpole.”image [Images/PG_367_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 15.2. De Forest Wireless Automobile operating in the New York financialdistrict in 1903.From “A Perambulating Wireless Telegraph Plant,” Electrical World and Engineer,28 Feb. 1903, p. 374.Morgan withdrew his support of Tesla, then, not because he necessarily doubtedTesla but because he was disturbed by speculation in the wireless industry. Ineffect, what happened to Tesla at the critical moment in his wireless work wasthat he was penalized by the questionable behavior of other entrepreneurs in theindustry. To be sure, there may have been technical problems with what Tesla wastrying to do at Wardenclyffe (discussed later), but he never got the chance totackle these issues fully since the actions of shysters like Pike and Whitedenied him the capital he needed.SCRAMBLING FOR CASHAlthough Morgan was unwilling to invest any more of his own money in Tesla’sventure, he was not opposed to letting others invest in Wardenclyffe, providedthey put up new capital and he got what he thought was a reasonable portion ofany stock issued by the new company.50 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_50] Hence Tesla spentthe next two years cultivating other investors and looking for new ways to raisemoney to complete Wardenclyffe.In scrambling for cash Tesla was in a difficult spot, as the tide of publicopinion was now running against him. Over the previous fifteen years, Tesla hadbeen regarded as the great electrical wizard in the popular press. Whileprofessional engineers and scientists had deplored his frequent pronouncementsin the tabloids and periodically criticized his ideas, their views did not seemto affect Tesla’s celebrity. Now both the press and the scientific communityturned against Tesla. As Laurence A. Hawkins, an engineer later associated withGeneral Electric, wrote in 1903, “Ten years ago, if public opinion in thiscountry had been requested to name the electrician of greatest promise, theanswer would without doubt have been ‘Nikola Tesla.’ To-day his name provokes atbest a regret that so great a promise should have been unfulfilled. In ten yearsthe attitude of the scientific press has passed from admiring expectancy to goodnatured banter and at last [to] charitable silence.” Hawkins went on tochallenge Tesla’s claims of having invented the AC motor, listed everyunfulfilled prediction that Tesla had made in the 1890s, and provided ascorching critique of his 1901 Century article. For Hawkins, Tesla’s downfallwas ultimately caused by his weakness for publicity: “Not even the brilliancy of… his early work, not even the persistent efforts of powerful friends, moved bytheir commercial interests to magnify and exalt the value of his patentedinventions, could avert the discredit to his reputation as a scientist broughtupon himself by his wild struggles for notoriety. He has been condemned by hisown extravagant boasts.” Faced with this negative publicity, Tesla knew he hadto take bold steps to restore his credibility. “My enemies have been successfulin representing me as a poet and visionary,” Tesla admitted to Morgan, such“that it is absolutely imperative for me to put out something commercial withoutdelay.”51 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_51]As a first measure, Tesla sought to raise cash by developing other inventions.In the summer of 1903, he formed the Tesla Electric and Manufacturing Company inorder to produce small Tesla coils for use in scientific laboratories and topower X-ray tubes. With the company capitalized at $5 million, Tesla found itdifficult to attract investors and so this venture was put on hold. Teslacontinued to hope that he could make money from this invention, and in 1905 hetried partnering with Pearce, an electrical instrument manufacturer in Brooklyn,to produce coils for under $50. When this scheme foundered, Tesla designed asmall “ozonizer,” a portable ozone generator that could be used to sanitizerooms since the ozone killed germs. In addition, he also began working on a newform of steam turbine (see Chapter 16 [025_Chapter025.xhtml]).52[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_52]Since these inventions would take time to develop a cash flow, Tesla soughtshort-term financing through a loan from a bank in Serbia, assuming that hisfame in his home country would carry the day. However, news of Tesla’s patentlitigation involving the “lion-capitalists” of America made the Serbian bankersnervous and they declined his request. In giving Tesla this bad news, hismaternal uncle Petar Mandic wrote, “Dear Nikola! Don’t be discouraged at all;you are, thank God, young; you don’t have to bow to anyone or will not loseface.”53 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_53]Determined not to lose face, Tesla turned again to John Jacob Astor, who hadadvanced money for developing his ideas for wireless lighting. However, stillmiffed that Tesla had spent the advance not on lighting but on research atColorado Springs, Astor declined and wrote in October 1903, “While wishing youall possible luck, do not care to go into the company myself.”54[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_54]Tesla next cultivated the financier Thomas Fortune Ryan, who was regarded as“the most adroit, suave and noiseless man” on Wall Street. Born in ruralVirginia, Ryan had invested in rapid-transit companies in New York City as wellas tobacco companies in Virginia. In 1898, Ryan merged his tobacco interestswith James B. Duke’s American Tobacco to create the Tobacco Trust. Tesla askedRyan to invest $100,000 in Wardenclyffe, hoping that amount would “be sufficientto reach the first commercial results” and would “pave the way to other greatersuccesses.” Though interested, Ryan ultimately chose not to invest. “[A] Greatmany disappointments today!” Tesla remarked to Scherff in November 1903. “Iwonder how long this is going to keep on.”55 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_55]Undeterred by Ryan’s refusal, Tesla followed up on his idea to wirelesslytransmit power from Niagara and turned to his old business associate, William B.Rankine. Rankine had worked with Adams to establish Niagara power on theAmerican side of the falls, but in 1892 he founded a second company, CanadianNiagara Power, to harness the Canadian Horseshoe Falls. After years of wranglingwith the Canadian government, Rankine broke ground in 1901 on a20,000-horsepower hydroelectric plant that began delivering power in early 1905.However, since there was no local market for this additional power, Rankine andTesla began discussing the possibility of building a wireless station that couldtransmit up to 10,000 horsepower and presumably help Canadian Niagara Powerreach new customers. Tesla thought this new station would “offer a greatconvenience to the whole world” since the power could be used to operate clocksand stock tickers, each of which would consume only one-tenth of a horsepower.Tesla estimated that a commercial-scale station would cost $2 million, and heasked Morgan to invest $500,000. However, it is not clear how Tesla or Rankinewould have secured the remaining funds for this station.56[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_56]In the midst of this desperate search for funding, Tesla was cheered by visitswith his friend Richmond Hobson. Having resigned from the navy and planning torun for Congress, Hobson spent much of 1903 on a nationwide speaking tour.Realizing that a credible candidate had to be a married man, Hobson had beguncourting Grizelda Hull of Tuxedo Park, New York. Hobson’s courtship with MissHull was stormy; on the one hand, she idolized Hobson as a great war hero, buton the other hand, she regarded him as an insincere social butterfly.57[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_57] After seeing Miss Hull for a Christmas visit in 1903,Hobson was struggling with his feelings and so he went to visit his old friend.As he told Miss Hull,The day closed in homesickness till I went to see dear Tesla. He kissed me onthe cheek, as once before and when I left him at one o’clock last night, I feltprepared and ready for another year and for future years. When at one time Ireferred to the great and trying obstacles that he was fighting against he said,“Hobson, I wish they were a thousand times greater, my only fear is that thisworld can not make obstacles as great as I need and long to meet.”It made me feel ashamed of myself almost. You will never hear me refer toobstacles again, unless in a thought of impotence to get at them and in defianceof their magnitude.And now au revoir, Grizelda, (won’t you let me call you Grizelda?) I am shovingoff from shore. The horizon is misty[,] I can not see the land beyond. But mysoul is fortified.… I have been with you and with Tesla.58[029_BM029.xhtml#ch_58]Tesla, too, was fortified by his visit with Hobson (Figure 15.3[024_Chapter024.xhtml#fig15_3]). In early 1904 he produced an elaborateprospectus announcing “that in connection with the commercial introduction of myinventions, I shall render professional services in the general capacity ofconsulting electrician and engineer.” Working as a consulting engineer, Teslaboasted to Morgan that he could easily earn $50,000 a year. The prospectusincluded a list of Tesla’s patents, quotes from his lectures and articles, and aphotograph of Wardenclyffe (Figure 15.4 [024_Chapter024.xhtml#fig15_4]). Printedon vellum paper and tucked in an envelope bearing a large red wax seal with theinitials “N.T.,” this prospectus was regarded by the Electrical World as “amanifesto worthy of the original genius issuing it.” “It was hard work to get itup,” admitted Tesla to Scherff, but he hoped it would attract new investors.Tesla asked Robert and Katharine Johnson to give him “a list of people almost asprominent and influential as the Johnsons who desire to get into high society”so that he could send the prospectus to them. As splendid as this manifesto was,Tesla must have already been feeling discouraged, as he signed his note to theJohnsons, “Nikola Busted.”59 [029_BM029.xhtml#ch_59]image [Images/PG_371_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 15.3. Tesla in 1904. From NTM. And yet Tesla pressed on. To back up the prospectus, he gave several newspaperinterviews and published a description of his work at Colorado Springs. Much tothe Great Man’s chagrin, Tesla openly acknowledged in this story that he wasbeing supported by Morgan. He also announced his plans with the Canadian NiagaraPower Company to distribute the power. Ever enthusiastic about the potential forwireless power and messages, Tesla concluded by proclaiming: “[W]hen the firstplant is inaugurated and it is shown that a telegraphic message, almost assecret and non-interferable as a thought, can be transmitted to any terrestrialdistance, the sound of the human voice, with all its intonations andinflections, faithfully and instantly reproduced at any other point of theglobe, the energy of a waterfall made available for supplying light, heat ormotive power, anywhere—on sea, or land, or high in the air—humanity will be likean ant heap stirred up with a stick: See the excitement coming!”60[029_BM029.xhtml#d1003]image [Images/PG_372_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 15.4. First page of Tesla’s Prospectus, February 1904.From “A Striking Tesla Manifesto,” Electrical World 43:256 (6 Feb. 1904) in TC16:159.Such proclamations, though, did not stir up investors. In the spring of 1904,Tesla met with Charles A. Coffin, president of General Electric, and hisassociates, observing that “If they refuse, they are simply snoozers.” A fewweeks later, Tesla made a pitch to John Sanford Barnes, another Wall Streetfinancier and president of St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. A graduate of theNaval Academy at Annapolis, Barnes had served as a naval officer during theCivil War and gone on to write a book about torpedoes and submarine warfare.61[029_BM029.xhtml#d1004] Given Barnes’s interest in naval technology, Tesla mayhave met this potential investor while he was working on his radio-controlledboat. To entice Barnes, Tesla had his attorney Parker Page prepare a legalanalysis of his wireless patents, which emphasized that they gave broad controlof this technology and were easily worth $5 million. In spite of this patentanalysis, Barnes passed up the opportunity to invest in Wardenclyffe. “I swear,”growled Tesla to Scherff, “if I ever get out of this hole nobody will catch mewithout cash!”62 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1005]Through 1905, Tesla continued to seek out major investors for Wardenclyffe,including the banker Jacob Schiff, who had participated against Morgan in theraid on the Northern Pacific in 1901.63 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1006] To be sure, allthe individuals Tesla approached had the financial means to support him, but whydid they turn him down?Tesla looked like a bad risk because of the way he had structured the originaldeal with Morgan. (Recall that Tesla, not Morgan, had drafted the originalagreement.) In return for the $150,000, Tesla had assigned Morgan a 51% share ofhis wireless patents. While Tesla could certainly assign his remaining 49% ofthe patents to new investors and create a new company, the new company could notexercise its patent rights unless Morgan agreed to cooperate. (In order to gaina monopoly, the patents could only be developed by one company, not twocompeting companies.) Morgan consistently assured Tesla that he would cooperateprovided that the new investors put up fresh capital and that he got areasonable portion of any stock issued by the new company. Again, Morgan was notopposed to seeing Tesla’s inventions developed—he simply did not want to investany more of his own money. However, to new investors this looked like a lousydeal since they would be taking all of the risk (i.e., putting in new capitaland developing the company) while Morgan would enjoy substantial gains thanks tohis early investment of only $150,000. Why, the investors must have wondered,should they work so hard only to line Morgan’s pocket? Over and over, potentialinvestors asked Tesla, “If this is a good thing, why does not Morgan see youthrough?”64 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1007] Hence, no matter how hard he pitched thepotential of wireless power, Tesla could not convince new investors that thelong-term returns outweighed the short-term risks of setting up a new company.TURNING ON MORGANAs Tesla struggled to persuade new investors to join the Wardenclyffe venture,he bombarded Morgan with letters, alternating between demanding and pleading formore money. At times arrogant and other times groveling, Tesla admitted thatthese letters to the Great Man were often “written in moments of despondencywhen the pain [was] too hard to bear.”65 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1008]Tesla’s arguments in these letters took various forms. Sometimes he promisedMorgan fantastic returns on his investment; as he explained in September 1903,“If you will give me your earnest support in this you can have a greater incomethan Rockefeller from his oil-wells. And you will have at your mercy thecutthroats who are trying to undo your work and get your royal mantle. I onlyneed to complete this plant, Mr. Morgan, the rest will take care of itself.” Inother letters, he sought to convince Morgan by claiming that his wirelessinventions would revolutionize daily life:I have never attempted, Mr. Morgan, to tell you even a hundredth of what can bereadily accomplished by the use of certain principles I have discovered. If youwill imagine that I have found the stone of the philosophers, you will not befar from the truth. They will cause a revolution so great that almost all valueand all human relations will be profoundly [upended]. These new developments donot concern any country in particular, but the whole world and they are in linewith your own efforts. The commercial possibilities they offer are simplyinfinite, and you are the only man today who possesses the genius and power tocompel the universal adoption of these ideas and that is why I approached youtwo years ago.66 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1009]Failing that, Tesla sought Morgan’s sympathy. Hearing that Morgan was going tomeet with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Tesla wrote a long letter in October1904 that concluded: “Since a year, Mr. Morgan, there has been hardly a nightwhen my pillow is not bathed in tears, but you must not think me a weak man forthat. I am perfectly sure to finish my task, come what may. I am only sorry thatafter mastering the difficulties which seemed insuperable, and acquiring specialknowledge which I now alone possess, and which, if applied effectively, wouldadvance the world a century, I must see my work delayed.”67[029_BM029.xhtml#d1010]Morgan responded to this overture with a curt “No,” and Tesla began to show hisanger. Knowing that Morgan viewed himself as a devout Anglican, Tesla burst out:You are a man like Bismarck. Great but uncontrollable. I wrote purposefully lastweek hoping that your recent association [with the archbishop] might haverendered you more susceptible to a softer influence. But you are no Christian atall, you are a fanatic musoulman [i.e., a Muslim]. Once you say no, come whatmay, it is no.May the gravitation repel instead of attract, may right become wrong, everyconsideration no matter what it may be, must founder on the rock of your brutalresolve.…You let me struggle on, weakened by shrewd enemies, disheartened by doubtingfriends, financially exhausted, trying to overcome obstacles which you yourselfhave piled up before me.68 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1011]As Tesla’s anger grew, it came to be mixed up with superstition, saints, andsalvation. Writing on 14 December 1904, Tesla told Morgan,Owing to a habit contracted long ago in defiance of superstition, I prefer tomake important communications on Fridays and the 13th of each month, but myhouse is afire and I have not an hour to waste.I knew that you would refuse. What chance have I to land the biggest Wall Streetmonster with soul’s spider thread!Your letter reached me just on the day of my patron saint—the greatest ofall—St. Nikola. There was a silent agreement between St. Nikola and myself thatwe would stick to each other. He did well for a time, but during the last threeyears he has forgotten me,—as you have.You say that you have fulfilled your contract with me. You have not.I came to enlist your genius and power, not because of money. You should knowthat I have honored you in so doing as much as I have honored myself. You are abig man, but your work is wrought in passing form, mine is immortal. I came toyou with the greatest invention of all times. I have more creations named afterme than any man that has gone before not excepting Archimedes and Galileo—thegiants of invention. Six thousand million dollars are invested in enterprisesbased on my discoveries in the United States to-day. I could draw on you atsight for a million dollars if you were the Pierpont Morgan of old.When we entered our contract I furnished: 1) patent rights; 2) my ability as anengineer and electrician; 3) my good will. You were to furnish 1) money; 2) yourbusiness ability; 3) your good will. I assigned patent rights to you which inthe worst case are worth ten times your cash investment. You advanced the money,true, but even this first clause of our contract was violated. There was a delayof two months in furnishing the last $50,000—a delay which was fatal.I complied conscientiously with the second and third obligation[s]. You ignoredyours deliberately. Not only this, you discredited me.There is only one way to do [sic], Mr. Morgan. Give me the money to finish agreat work, which will advance the world a century and reflect honor on all thatcome after you. Or else make me a present and let me work out my salvation.69[029_BM029.xhtml#d1012]As the months went by and Tesla was unable to either attract new investors orconvince Morgan, Tesla succumbed to the ultimate delusion: that he was theinventor of the most important invention of all time. As he proclaimed to Morganin February 1905:Let me tell you once more. I have perfected the greatest invention of alltime—the transmission of electrical energy without wires to any distance, a workwhich has consumed 10 years of my life. It is the long sought stone of thephilosophers. I need to complete the plant I have constructed and in one bound,humanity will advance centuries.I am the only man on this earth to-day who has the peculiar knowledge andability to achieve this wonder and another one may not come in a hundred years.There has been a long and painful delay. My nerves are not of iron, and all thisknowledge and ability may be lost to the world. Help me to complete this work orelse remove the obstacles in my path.70 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1013]Despite his anger, Tesla never gave up hoping that Morgan would supportWardenclyffe. In the summer of 1905, Tesla told Scherff that he had a hunchMorgan would contact him when he returned from his annual trip to Europe, but ofcourse the Great Man did not call. Even as late as 1911 Tesla held out hope;writing to John Hays Hammond Jr. about a joint venture for a radio-controlledboat, Tesla said, “I have already interested a gentleman who signs himselfJ.P.M. in part of my wireless inventions and my friend Astor is now waiting forthe completion of my plant to go into the wireless power transmission businesswhich should be a colossal success.”71 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1014]IS THE EARTH LIKE A WATER BALLOON OR THE OC EAN?As Tesla struggled to find new investors and to persuade Morgan to support him,new problems kept cropping up. Along with the Port Jefferson Bank demanding loanpayments, James Warden took legal action for nonpayment of the mortgage on theWardenclyffe property. Meanwhile, a Wardenclyffe employee named Clark sued forback wages. In May 1905, after seventeen years (the regular life of a patent),Tesla’s AC motor patents expired; even though Tesla was no longer receivingroyalties from them, he may have felt some regret since these patentsrepresented a major contribution to society and industry. “The obstacles in myway,” confessed Tesla to Scherff, “are a regular hydra. Just as soon as I chopoff a head, two new ones grow.”72 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1015]As he wrestled with these problems, Tesla also received the upsetting news thatHobson was going to marry Grizelda. “Do you know, my dear Tesla,” wrote Hobson,“you are the very first person, outside of my family that I thought of and whilethe ceremonies will be simple, I wish to feel you present in standing close tome on this occasion so full of meaning in my life. Indeed, I would not feel theoccasion complete without you. You occupy one of the deepest chambers in myheart.”73 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1016]While Tesla was outwardly happy for Hobson and served as an usher at thewedding, inside he must have been deeply disappointed, for this marriage meantthat Hobson had chosen Grizelda over him. Although we will never know for surewhether Tesla and Hobson had a physical relationship, it is undeniable that theywere very close emotionally. Just as Szigeti had left him fifteen years earlier,now Tesla must have felt abandoned by Hobson. Tesla and Hobson remained friends,and in the 1930s they would periodically get together to see a movie and talkfor hours.74 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1017]Perhaps to ease this emotional blow, Tesla threw himself into his work. Duringthe summer of 1905, he and Scherff worked on making a strong electricalconnection between the magnifying transmitter and the Earth at the bottom of the120-foot well beneath the Wardenclyffe tower. This ground connection was the keyto the entire system since it was there that Tesla would deliver electricalenergy into the earth’s crust in order to set up stationary waves and broadcastpower around the world.As we have seen, Tesla planned to get a grip on the Earth by using sixteen pipesradiating out from the bottom of the well. To push these pipes three hundredfeet into the ground, he devised special machinery that used compressed air.However, this machinery presented all sorts of problems, and letters betweenTesla and Scherff indicate that they struggled to come up with reliable valvesand had to redesign parts of the machinery.These letters reveal Tesla wavering between optimism and great anxiety. Witheach small change, he was hopeful that “we shall get excellent results this timeand lay the foundation for a great success.” Here we see a familiar trait—thatTesla could see hope in the smallest pieces of evidence. But now there wasanxiety; as he confided to Scherff, “The troubles and dangers are at theirheight.… The Wardenclyffe specters are hounding me day and night.… When will itend?”75 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1018]But the problem was not simply the pipes; the real specter was how the Earthactually responds when electrical energy is pumped into it. Based on hisColorado experiments, Tesla assumed that the Earth behaved electrically as if itwere filled with an incompressible fluid; if one pumped this fluid into theEarth on one side, it would come gushing out of one-way valves on the other side(Figure 15.5 [024_Chapter024.xhtml#fig15_5]). Think of the Earth here as aballoon filled with water; if one pumped water into one side at the resonantfrequency of the balloon, then water would come squirting out the valves on theother side. Hence if the Earth was filled with an incompressible electricalfluid, it would indeed be possible to transmit electric power through the Earthwith minimal losses. Tesla would be right.76 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1019]image [Images/PG_379_img_0.jpg]FIGURE 15.5. Tesla’s vision of the earth as filled with an incompressible fluid.From NT, “Famous Scientific Illusions,” Electrical Experimenter, Feb. 1919, pp.692–694 ff.But what if this was not the case? What if the Earth behaved instead as if itwere filled with a compressible fluid? In this situation, then, Tesla might pumpelectrical energy into the ground and set up electrical waves, but these waveswould dissipate and eventually disappear. As an illustration, consider whathappens when a stone is dropped in the water at the edge of the ocean. Wavesripple out from the point at which the rock hits the water, but since the oceanis a compressible fluid, these waves do not travel continuously across the oceanto the other side. Unfortunately for Tesla, from an electrical standpoint, theEarth behaves as if it is filled with compressible fluid; it is more like anocean than a water balloon. Hence it is doubtful that electric power can betransmitted through the Earth in the way Tesla envisioned it.To be sure, there are individuals today investigating how Tesla’s ideas forwireless power may be made to work. One approach is to postulate that Tesla wasgenerating not only ordinary electromagnetic waves but other forms ofelectromagnetic radiation as well. In particular, some investigators argue thatMaxwell’s equations predict that a moving electrical charge produces a secondform of radiation popularly known as scalar waves that are longitudinal (just asTesla emphasized), do not dissipate, and travel faster than the speed of light.However, most physicists regard scalar waves as being experimentally unprovenand hence not part of accepted theory.77 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1020] While futureresearchers may prove that Tesla was on to something with wireless power, I amsiding with the physicists and take the view that there was a technical problemat Wardenclyffe, a disjuncture between what Tesla thought should happen and howthe Earth actually functions.DESCENT INTO DARKNESSTesla never gave up on his ideas about transmitting power through the earth, butthe fact that he could not get his ideas to square with reality during his timeat Wardenclyffe was deeply disturbing. Tesla was supremely confident in his ownpowers of discovery and invention; “my ideas are always rational,” he said inthe 1930s, “because I am an exceptionally accurate instrument of reception.”Indeed, as he told a reporter in 1904, he would go crazy if he doubted hisabilities.78 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1021] Moreover, because of his Orthodox religiousheritage and his faith in the rationality of science, Tesla firmly believed thatthere were fundamental truths that could be discovered about the natural world.Just as he had identified the ideal of the rotating magnetic field andmanifested it in the AC motor, Tesla believed that what he imagined abouttransmitting power through the Earth must be true; both were products of hismind. In this sense, Tesla was like the Nobel Prize–winning mathematician JohnNash; when asked how a rational mathematician could possibly believe thatextraterrestrials were sending him messages, Nash calmly explained that “theideas I had about supernatural beings came to me the same way that mymathematical ideas did. So I took them seriously.”79 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1022]Hence, when Tesla could not get Wardenclyffe to work the way he wanted, he musthave been confronted with a serious dilemma: either he was wrong or nature waswrong. Unable to accept either alternative, Tesla suffered a nervous breakdown.As he reported in his autobiography, “No subject to which I have ever devotedmyself has called for such concentration of mind and strained to so dangerous adegree the finest fibers of my brain as the system of which the MagnifyingTransmitter is the foundation.… Despite my rare physical endurance at thatperiod the abused nerves finally rebelled and I suffered a complete collapse,just as the consummation of the long and difficult task was almost in sight[emphasis added].”80 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1023]While Tesla was angry and depressed through 1904, the full breakdown came in thefall of 1905. In September, Tesla’s business associate, Rankine, died suddenlyat age forty-seven; Rankine had helped organize the Nikola Tesla Company in 1895and had been instrumental in Tesla’s attempted negotiations with CanadianNiagara Power. In October, feeling overwhelmed by the problems at Wardenclyffe,Tesla confessed to Scherff that “The troubles are so many that I am eager to seewhat solution the good Lord has provided for. This time he will have to sendSanta Claus with a full bundle.”81 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1024] In November, Teslathought that he had convinced Carnegie’s former partner, Henry Clay Frick, toinvest in wireless power, but Frick, Tesla, and Morgan were never able to agreeto terms.82 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1025] In December, Tesla admitted that he had beendangerously ill for the previous month and that it was as severe as the bout ofcholera he had suffered as a youth. On Christmas Eve, T. C. Martin dropped him anote: “I have been sorry to hear of your recent illness—well concealed from yourfriends and the public—and I am also very glad to hear of your recovery. Pleasestay well and strong.”83 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1026]Tesla’s mental collapse continued well into 1906; even in April, Scherff wroteto his boss, “I have received your letter and am very glad to know that you arevanquishing your illness. I have scarcely seen you so out of sorts as lastSunday, and I was frightened.”84 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1027]Throughout his life, Tesla was deeply interested in how the mind worked, and hesubsequently described his breakdown to the poet and journalist George SylvesterViereck, who published a popular book about Freudian psychoanalytical theory inthe 1920s.85 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1028] During his breakdown, Tesla explained toViereck, he wrestled in his dreams with traumatic events from his life. Many ofthese dreams involved his mother, but they began with a recollection of thedeath of his brother Dane or Daniel:On my slow return to the normal state of mind I experienced an exquisitelypainful longing after something undefinable. During the day I worked as usualand this feeling, though it persisted, was much less pronounced, but when Iretired the night, with its monstrous amplifications, made the suffering veryacute until it dawned upon me that my torture was due to a consuming desire tosee my mother.Thought of her led me to review my past life beginning with the earliestimpression of my childhood and I was dismayed to find that I could not recallclearly even her features except in one scene. It was a dismal night with rainfalling in torrents. My brother, a youth of eighteen and [an] intellectualgiant, had died. My mother came to my room, took me in her arms and whisperedalmost inaudibly: “Come and kiss Daniel.” I pressed my mouth against the icecold lips of my brother knowing only that something dreadful had happened. Mymother put me again to bed and lingering a little said with tears streaming:“God gave me one at midnight and at midnight he took away the other one.” Theremembrance was like an oasis in the wilderness kept alive by some strange prankof the brain in the midst of oblivion.My recollections came slowly gaining in clearness and after weeks of thinkingthe images appeared sharply defined and in a fullness of light which astonishedme. Uncovering more and more of my past life I came to review my Americanexperiences. In the meantime my craving had become almost unbearable and everynight my pillows were wet from tears.86 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1029]In the dreams that followed, Tesla relived the stress of lecturing in London andParis in 1892, his subsequent journey home to see his dying mother, and thevision he experienced at the moment of her passing (see Chapter 8[017_Chapter017.xhtml]). As he told Viereck, at the moment that he recalled thevision of his mother floating up to heaven on a cloud,a feeling of absolute certitude swept over me that my Mother was dead and, sureenough, a maid came running who brought the message. This knowledge gave me aterrific shock and suddenly I became aware that I was—in New York! My Mother haddied years before but I had forgotten it! How could this happen I asked myselfhorrified and bitterness, pain and shame overwhelmed me. My sufferings had beenreal though the events were but imaginary reflections of previous occurrences.What I experienced was not the awakening from a dream but the restoration of aparticular department of my consciousness.As always, Tesla refused to attribute these experiences to any psychic orspiritual causes and insisted they were the result of overwork and externalstimuli. As he explained to Viereck,I am proving constantly, by every thought and action of mine, that I am nothingmore than an automaton responding to external stimuli and passing through aninfinitude of different existence[s], from the cradle to the grave.The explanation of these mental phenomena is, after all, very simple. Throughlong concentration on a special subject certain fibers in my brain, for want ofblood supply and exercise, were benumbed and could no longer respond properly tooutside influences. With the diversion of my thoughts they were graduallyvivified and finally brought back to their normal condition.… The desire to seemy Mother was due to my examination of some artistic fabrics woven by herselfwhich had awakened in me tender memories shortly before I began to concentrate.“The practical lesson of all this,” Tesla said to Viereck in closing, “is tobeware of concentration and be content with mediocre achievement.”87[029_BM029.xhtml#d1030] Sadly, Tesla seems to have taken this lesson to heart,for after his breakdown in 1905 he never again attempted a project as ambitiousas wireless power at Wardenclyffe. While he lived another thirty-eight years,his career as a bold innovator had come to an end."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEENVISIONARY TO THE END(1905–1943)Life is a moderately good play with a badly written third act.TRUMAN CAPOTETesla lived well into the twentieth century and passed away at the age ofeighty-seven in 1943. He continued to invent, but as John G. Trump, an MITprofessor, observed after reviewing Tesla’s papers in 1943, “his thoughts andefforts during at least the past fifteen years were primarily of a speculative,philosophical and somewhat promotional character—often concerned with theproduction and wireless transmission of power—but did not include new soundworkable principles or methods for realising such results.”1[029_BM029.xhtml#d1031] Ideal and illusion continued to shape Tesla’s creativeapproach to the very end.BLADELESS TURBINESAs he recovered from his nervous breakdown in 1906, Tesla hoped that he couldresume work at Wardenclyffe. To raise the necessary funds, he shifted hiscreative efforts from electricity to mechanical engineering. In doing so, hetook up his old dream of flying.Tesla had dreamed of flying since he was a boy, and one of the applications heplanned to pursue once he had perfected his wireless power system was totransmit power to aircraft. As he explained in 1911, “Twenty years ago Ibelieved that I would be the first man to fly; that I was on track ofaccomplishing what no one else was anywhere near reaching.… My idea was a flyingmachine propelled by an electric motor, with power supplied by stations on theearth.”2 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1032]Because he was concentrating on an electrically powered aircraft, Tesla paidlittle attention to how inventors such as the Wright brothers were utilizinglightweight gasoline engines, which, in part, allowed them to fly their firstairplane in 1903.3 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1033] Realizing that both automobiles andaircraft would require lighter and more powerful engines, Tesla now turned toinvestigating bladeless turbines.Tesla conceived of the idea of a bladeless turbine by drawing an analogy withthe rotating magnetic field in his AC motor. Just as the rotating field“dragged” the rotor along in his motor, Tesla thought it should be possible tohave a fluid such as steam or compressed air drag a series of disks fastened tothe turbine’s shaft (Figure 16.1 [025_Chapter025.xhtml#fig16_1]). By positioningthe disks closely together and placing them at right angles to the flow, Teslafound that he could use the viscosity of the fluid to spin the disk stack. Allfluids have the property of viscosity, and fluids like molasses have highviscosity while gases like air have low values. Whatever their viscosity, allfluids “stick” to solid surfaces; that is, the molecules of the fluid directlyin contact with the surface move at the velocity of the solid surface. At thesame time, molecules that are farther away from the surface are slowed byviscous interaction with the molecules near the surface. This results in atransition layer between the “no-slip” surface and the “freestream” velocitythat is known as a boundary layer.Tesla found that he could take advantage of the “viscous shear” of the boundarylayer—that tension between the molecules freely flowing and those alreadysticking to the surface—to transfer energy from the flowing fluid to the diskstack, eliminating the need for complex blades. Instead, by carefully adjustingthe gap between the disks so that it matched the characteristics of theviscosity and velocity of the fluid used, Tesla hoped to create an efficientengine. In Tesla’s design, the fluid flow entered the periphery of the turbineand exited at the center shaft. As the fluid spiraled toward the center, energywas extracted from the flow to drag the disks and cause the shaft to turn. Teslafurther found that by reversing the flow so that fluid entered at the center andexited at the periphery, his turbine would also function as a pump or blower.4[029_BM029.xhtml#d1034]image [Images/pg_386.jpg]FIGURE 16.1. Tesla Turbine. In this design, steam or compressed air would beintroduced to either the valve on the top left or top right and thus cause thedisks to turn in one direction or the other.From NT, “Turbine,” US Patent No. 1,061,206 (filed 21 Oct. 1909, granted 6 May1913).Like his other inventions, the bladeless turbine was based on an ideal: that twobasic properties of any fluid—viscosity and adhesion—could be used to create theperfect engine. Using only simple disks instead of the complex blades found inthe axial turbines invented by Charles Parsons and Gustaf de Laval, Teslabelieved that his turbine would be cheaper to build and maintain. But even moreimportant, he was confident that his design would deliver more horsepower perpound of machine, allowing it to be used extensively in automobiles andaircraft. “I have accomplished what mechanical engineers have been dreamingabout ever since the invention of steam power,” crowed Tesla in 1911. “That isthe perfect rotary engine.”5 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1035]But just as it took Tesla years to go from the ideal of a rotating magneticfield to a functioning AC motor, the perfection of the bladeless turbineinvolved a great deal of careful engineering. Tesla soon found himself involvedin testing different configurations and materials for the disks in his turbine.Julius C. Czito (the son of Tesla’s longtime assistant Kolman Czito) built thefirst prototype in 1906 with eight disks, each six inches (15.2 centimeters) indiameter. The machine weighed less than 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) and developed30 horsepower. Tesla soon discovered that the rotor attained such high speeds—upto 35,000 revolutions per minute (rpm)—that the metal disks were stretched outof shape. In 1910 Czito built a larger model for Tesla with twelve-inch (30.5centimeters) disks and when they limited this machine to 10,000 rpm, itdeveloped 100 horsepower. In 1911 they built a third prototype with disks 9.75inches (24.8 centimeters) in diameter. Again they reduced the rpm to 9,000 andfound the power increased to 110 horsepower. Impressed with the amount of powerproduced relative to the size of the prototype, Tesla told reporters that histurbine represented “a powerhouse in a hat.”6 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1036]Following his usual strategy of patent-promote-sell, Tesla initially hoped thathe would be able to sell his turbine patents to a manufacturer and use the moneyto finish Wardenclyffe. In March 1909, Tesla pitched his turbine to John JacobAstor; once again, Astor refused to invest. Consequently, he set up the TeslaPropulsion Company with Joseph Hoadley and Walter H. Knight. Hoadley wasassociated with Alabama Consolidated Coal and Iron, which planned to installTesla pumps or air blowers for use in its blast furnaces. Tesla then filed twopatent applications—one for a pump, another for a turbine in October 1909.Confident of the potential success of this invention, Tesla rented an officesuite in the new Metropolitan Life Tower on Madison Square, then the tallestbuilding in the world.7 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1037]To show off the potential of this new invention, Tesla arranged to demonstratehis turbine at the Waterside Power Station of the New York Edison Company in1911–12. For these tests, Tesla built two turbines with 18-inch (45.7centimeters) disks, and each engine developed 200 horsepower at 9,000 rpm. Thesetwo turbines were installed on a single base with their shafts connected by atorque spring (Figure 16.2 [025_Chapter025.xhtml#fig16_2]). When steam was fedto the turbines, each would turn in an opposite direction and the torque springwould measure the power developed as the two turbines pushed against each other.Here the illusion that would illustrate the ideal was that the two engines wouldengage in a tug-of-war.image [Images/pg_388.jpg]FIGURE 16.2. Tesla’s turbine test apparatus at the Edison Waterside Station, NewYork in 1912. Note the light-colored torsion spring connecting the two engines.From Frank Parker Stockbridge, “The Tesla Turbine,” World’s Work 23 (1911–12):543–48.However, the engineers watching the test did not understand what Tesla was doingwith the torque spring and they expected to see the turbines turning; when theydid not see engine shafts turning, they concluded that the test was a failure.This time, the illusion backfired.8 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1038]When J. P. Morgan passed away in 1913, Tesla attended the Great Man’s funeral,and two months later he approached Morgan’s son Jack for support. Still dreamingof Wardenclyffe, Tesla hoped that Jack would invest in wireless power; however,when Jack showed no interest in that project, Tesla pitched his turbine plans.Willing to take a small risk, Jack loaned Tesla $20,000 in four $5,000installments. Using this money, Tesla tried selling his turbine idea to SigmundBergmann, an old colleague of Edison’s who had set up a large manufacturingoperation in Germany. Determined to keep up appearances, Tesla moved into newoffices in the Woolworth Building, which had replaced the Metropolitan LifeTower as the tallest building in the world (Figure 16.3[025_Chapter025.xhtml#fig16_3]). Unfortunately World War I broke out in 1914 andTesla was unable to consummate the deal with Bergmann in Germany. At the sametime, Jack Morgan lost interest in the project and became deeply involved inhelping the French and British finance the war.9 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1039]image [Images/pg_389.jpg]FIGURE 16.3. Tesla in his office in the Woolworth Building, circa 1916.From Deutsches Museum. Over the next ten years, Tesla worked on his turbine with engineers at PyleNational in Chicago, Allis-Chalmers in Milwaukee, and the Budd Company inPhiladelphia. They were unable to overcome the problem that Tesla had noticedearly on: speeds over 10,000 rpm placed incredible stresses on the thin disks inthe turbine, causing them to deform. Although Tesla searched for better steelalloys to use in his design, he was never able to find sufficiently strongmaterials.Moreover, Tesla’s turbine design seems to have fallen between two separate areasof industry. On the one hand, to develop it properly, Tesla needed theassistance of engineers at firms like Allis-Chalmers or General Electric wherethey specialized in making rotating machinery, but their expertise was primarilyin the area of axial turbines and not necessarily relevant to building a betterboundary-layer turbine such as Tesla’s. On the other hand, the major markets fora lightweight Tesla turbine would have been the automobile and aviationindustries, but these companies were focusing on the development ofhigh-performance piston engines and had little interest in tangling with aturbine engine.However, when used as a pump, Tesla’s design works remarkably well, and todaythe DiscFlo Corporation of Santee, California, manufactures pumps based onTesla’s ideas. In addition, Phoenix Navigation and Guidance Inc. (PNGinc), inMunising, Michigan, is experimenting with disk turbines using advanced materialssuch as carbon-fiber, titanium-impregnated plastic and Kevlar reinforcement intheir disks. And there is a devoted group of amateurs who continue to work withTesla’s ideas and share their results through the Tesla Engine BuildersAssociation.10 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1040]BANKRUPTCY AND OTHER DISAPPOINTMENTSUnable to find investors for his turbine after Jack Morgan, Tesla’s financesagain went into a tailspin. He was forced to give up his office in the WoolworthBuilding for more modest space at 5 West 40th Street. In 1916, New York Citytook him to court to collect $935 in back taxes, and Tesla had to admit that hisincome was only $350 to $400 a month, which was barely enough to cover hisexpenses. “How do you live?” the judge asked Tesla.“Mostly on credit,” he replied. “I have a bill at the Waldorf that I have notpaid for several years.”“Are there other judgments against you?”“Scores of them.”“Does anybody owe you any money?”“No sir.”“Have you any jewelry?”“No Sir; jewelry I abhor.”Tesla explained that he was still president and treasurer of the Nikola TeslaCompany but that 90% of the company’s stock had been pledged between 1898 and1902 to bankers, creditors, and friends. Although the company once had aportfolio of two hundred patents, most had expired. To keep the company going,Tesla had named two former employees, Fritz Lowenstein and Diaz Brutrago, asdirectors. After learning that he owned neither real estate nor an automobile,the court appointed a receiver to manage his affairs.11 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1041]In the midst of these financial troubles, Tesla had two incidents with majorscientific awards. In November 1915, the New York Times published an earlyreport that Tesla and Edison were going to share that year’s Nobel Prize inphysics; since Marconi had already won the prize in 1909, it seemed entirelyplausible that the two wizards would now be sharing the prize. Although he hadnot yet been officially notified, Tesla told the paper that “I have concludedthat the honor has been conferred on me in acknowledgement of a discoveryannounced a short time ago which concerns the transmission of electrical energywithout wires.” Unfortunately the New York Times was wrong and the 1915 NobelPrize in Physics was awarded to William H. Bragg and his son W. L. Bragg.Disappointed, Tesla rationalized his loss in a letter to his friend RobertUnderwood Johnson: “In a thousand years, there will be many recipients of theNobel Prize, but I have not less than four dozens of my creations identifiedwith my name in the technical literature. These are honors real and permanent,which are bestowed, not by a few who are apt to err, but by the whole worldwhich seldom makes a mistake.”12 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1042]A year later Tesla received happier news when he learned that the AmericanInstitute of Electrical Engineering (AIEE) wished to present him with itshighest honor, the Edison Medal. As noted earlier (Chapter 12[021_Chapter021.xhtml]), Tesla’s relationship with the institute may have beenstrained because members feared negative publicity if stories of Tesla’s sexualproclivities became public, with the likely result that Tesla seldomparticipated in institute affairs after serving as vice president in 1892–93.Though the award was announced in December 1916, the medal was not formallypresented to Tesla until May 1917, and the delay may well have been caused byTesla’s reluctance to accept the award for an organization from which he feltsocially ostracized. As he bitterly wrote to B. A. Behrend, the seniorWestinghouse engineer who had nominated him: “You propose to honor me with amedal which I could pin upon my coat and strut for a vain hour before themembers and guests of your Institute. You would bestow an outward semblance ofhonoring me but you would decorate my body and continue to let starve, forfailure to supply recognition, my mind and its creative products which havesupplied the foundation upon which the major portion of your Institute exists.And when you would through the vacuous pantomine [sic] of honoring Tesla youwould not be honoring Tesla but Edison who has previously shared unearned gloryfrom every previous recipient of this medal.”Behrend was able to persuade Tesla to accept the medal, but Tesla continued tohave mixed feelings. In May 1917 he attended the banquet at the Engineers’ Cluband was charming with his colleagues, but moments before the awards ceremony hedisappeared. Frantic, Behrend searched everywhere for Tesla, only to find him inBryant Park across the street from the club. There, Tesla was busy feeding thepigeons. When he was done, Tesla went with Behrend to the ceremony where he gavean inspiring speech recounting his early life and describing his creativeapproach.13 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1043]WIRELESS LITIGATION AND MINOR INVENTIONSIn the mid-1910s Tesla was as poor as he had been in the mid-1880s when he wasforced to dig ditches (see Chapter 4 [013_Chapter013.xhtml]). Yet, just as hedid thirty years earlier, Tesla turned to minor inventions to get himself out ofthe financial hole.First, he sought ways to earn something on his wireless patents. In 1903,anxious that the Germans had a strong company to challenge British Marconi,Kaiser Wilhelm II had encouraged all of the German wireless companies to cometogether as a single company, Gesellschaft für drahtlose Telegraphie SystemTelefunken. Further, to compete with Marconi in the American market, Telefunkenhad organized a subsidiary, the Atlantic Communication Company, around 1911, andthis company retained Tesla as a consultant; doing so made sense since yearsbefore one of Telefunken’s leading German researchers, Adolph Slaby, hadpublicly called Tesla the “father of the wireless” in order to needle Marconi.14[029_BM029.xhtml#d1044]When World War I broke out, the British navy immediately cut all of the underseatelegraph cables from Germany, and the only link between Germany and the UnitedStates were the stations Atlantic Communication had built at Sayville on LongIsland and the station at Tuckerton, New Jersey, set up by another Germancompany, HOMAG. Determined to force these stations to be closed so that it wouldhave full control over the information flowing from Europe to America about thewar, the British government asked American Marconi to sue Atlantic Communicationfor patent infringement in 1914. Both sides—the British and German governments,Marconi and Telefunken—recognized the stakes of this legal battle and brought intheir superstars; while Marconi traveled to New York, Telefunken sent twophysicists, Jonathan Zenneck and Ferdinand Braun (who had shared the 1909 NobelPrize with Marconi). In addition, Atlantic Communication retained the leadingAmerican patent counsel, Frederick P. Fish, to lead the defense team and itasked Tesla to serve as an expert witness. Consequently, from 1915 to 1917Telefunken paid Tesla about $1,000 a month. Relying on Tesla, Braun, andZenneck, Atlantic Communication made a strong case against Marconi, and in May1915 American Marconi asked for a postponement. The rationale given by theMarconi lawyers was that Italy had entered the war and that the Italians neededMarconi home in order to help with the war effort; one wonders if AmericanMarconi also saw the suit as a losing proposition.15 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1045]Emboldened by these legal developments, Tesla launched his own lawsuit againstMarconi for patent infringement in August 1915. In this case, Tesla challengedthe U.S. patent issued to Marconi in 1904; Tesla gave a substantial depositionin 1916 recounting in detail his wireless work. According to Tesla expert GaryPeterson, “Nothing significant resulted from this [case] until 1916 when theMarconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America itself sued the United States foralleged damages resulting from the use of wireless during WWI.” This case,American Marconi v. the United States, took decades to wind through the legalsystem but resulted in a 1935 ruling by the United States Court of Claims thatinvalidated the fundamental Marconi patent because it was anticipated by Teslaand other early inventors. This ruling was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in1943, and based on this ruling, many people feel that Tesla finally gained atleast a legal victory over Marconi.16 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1046]But since all this litigation did not produce any immediate income in the 1910s,Tesla used his turbine research to spin off several inventions. While performingtests on pumps, he had learned that as he decreased the space between the disksand the wall of the pump, the relationship between the fluid’s momentum and itsspeed changed from being a square to a linear function.17[029_BM029.xhtml#d1047] Drawing on this insight, Tesla patented improvements inautomobile speedometers, frequency meters, and flow meters.18[029_BM029.xhtml#d1048] Around 1918, Tesla licensed these patents to the WalthamWatch Company.19 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1049] Drawing on its manufacturing capabilityin making precision clocks and instruments, Waltham introduced a line of“scientifically built speedometers” that were installed in luxury automobilessuch as the Pierce-Arrow, Lincoln, and Rolls-Royce. In promoting itsspeedometers, Waltham Watch sometimes included Tesla’s name in advertisements.20[029_BM029.xhtml#d1050]In addition to developing a speedometer and other measuring instruments, Teslaused what he learned about capillary forces and surface tension in his turbinework to develop a new process for refining metals. Around 1930 he produced areport titled “Process of De-Gassifying, Refining, and Purifying Metals,” whichhe circulated to several companies including United States Steel. Tesla appearsto have licensed this process to the copper-mining giant American Smelting andRefining Company (today ASARCO).21 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1051]BIRTHDAY PARTIES FOR A RECLUSEThrough the 1920s, Tesla lived off these modest royalties. Nevertheless, hecontinued to encounter financial difficulties; for instance, after hiring anattorney, Ralph J. Hawkins, to help with some legal work, Tesla neglected to payhim fees amounting to $913, and Hawkins was obliged to take Tesla to court inJune 1925. Warned by Hugo Gernsbac, the editor of Electrical Experimenter, thatit might be highly embarrassing if became known that Tesla was nearly penniless,the Westinghouse Company reluctantly agreed in 1934 to put Tesla on the payrollas a “consulting engineer” and pay him a monthly pension of $125.22[029_BM029.xhtml#d1052]To supplement this income, Tesla wrote articles for popular magazines, and hisautobiography appeared in several installments in Gernsback’s ElectricalExperimenter in 1919. Ever the visionary, Tesla loved to speculate on newapplications of electricity and radio. For instance, in 1917 he described ascheme for detecting ships by training a powerful ray of short wave impulses atobjects and then picking up the reflection of the ray on a fluorescent screen;thus he anticipated radar that was subsequently developed in the 1930s usingmicrowave electronics. One early radar pioneer, Émile Girardeau, was inspired byTesla and recalled that his first system in France was “conceived according tothe principles stated by Tesla.”23 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1053]Shortly after World War I, Tesla was approached by a representative of the newlyformed Soviet Union. V. I. Lenin believed that electrification was essential forthe success of communism, and one of his slogans was “Communism is the Sovietpower plus electrification of the whole country.” Nationwide electrificationfigured prominently in GOELRO, a loose ten-year plan of industrialtransformation that Lenin introduced in 1920.24 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1054] HenceLenin was apparently interested in employing Tesla’s wireless power system todistribute electricity across the vast distances of the Soviet Union. As Teslareported in 1919, “only recently an odd looking gentleman called on me with theobject of enlisting my services in the construction of world transmitters insome distant land. ‘We have no money,’ he said, ‘but carloads of solid gold, andwe will give you a liberal amount.’ I told him that I wanted to see first whatwill be done with my inventions in America, and this ended the interview.”25[029_BM029.xhtml#d1055]Tesla never abandoned his dream of broadcasting power from Wardenclyffe, and formany years he struggled to hold off his creditors and retain control of theproperty. In 1904 Tesla had mortgaged Wardenclyffe to George C. Boldt, the ownerof the Waldorf-Astoria, so that he could continue living at the hotel. In 1917creditors tore down the tower for scrap metal, and in 1921 the courts awardedthe property to the Waldorf-Astoria as restitution for Tesla’s long-overduehotel bill.26 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1056]These disappointments depressed Tesla, and he became a recluse, spending much ofhis time walking the streets of Manhattan and feeding pigeons. He particularlyliked the pigeons in Bryant Park behind the New York Public Library, and todayone end of the park (at Sixth Avenue and West 40th Street) is officiallydesignated “Nikola Tesla Corner.” Tesla continued to live in hotel rooms, movingfrom one hotel to another when he could no longer pay the bill and aftercomplaints that he was keeping too many pigeons in his room.27[029_BM029.xhtml#d1057]To mark Tesla’s seventy-fifth birthday in 1931, Kenneth Swezey, a young sciencewriter, organized a special party for the Wizard. Swezey asked seventy prominentscientists and engineers from around the world to send letters ofcongratulations, which he presented to Tesla in a special volume. Included inthe volume were messages from Albert Einstein, Sir Oliver Lodge, Robert A.Millikan, Lee de Forest, and Vannevar Bush. The letters were reprinted inYugoslavia and prompted the establishment of the Nikola Tesla Institution inBelgrade. Time magazine ran a cover story in which the aging inventor held forthon his plans to disprove Einstein’s theory of relativity, on his belief thatsplitting atoms released no energy, and the importance of interplanetarycommunications.28 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1058]Enjoying the warmth of this publicity, Tesla subsequently held press conferenceseach year on his birthday (Figure 16.4 [025_Chapter025.xhtml#fig16_4]). At the1932 conference, he announced that he had a new motor that would work on cosmicrays. On his seventy-ninth birthday, he recounted how he had developed apocket-sized mechanical oscillator that could destroy the Empire State Building(see Chapter 10 [019_Chapter019.xhtml]). For his eightieth, Tesla informedreporters that he wiggled his toes several hundred times before bed as a way oftoning up his body so that he would live for 135 years.29[029_BM029.xhtml#d1059] And at the 1937 birthday celebration, Tesla waspresented with gold medals by the governments of Yugoslavia andCzechoslovakia.30 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1060] A reporter from the New YorkWorld-Telegram, though, perhaps best summarized these annual events when hedescribed the 1935 fete: “Twenty-odd newspapermen came away from his Hotel NewYorker birthday party yesterday, which lasted six hours, feeling hesitantly thatsomething was wrong either with the old man’s mind or else their own, for Dr.Tesla was serene in an old-fashioned Prince Albert and courtly in a way thatseems to have gone out of this world.”31 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1061]image [Images/pg_397.jpg]FIGURE 16.4. Tesla at his birthday interviews, 1935.From http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ww_teslab_pop.html[http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ww_teslab_pop.html].A PARTICLE BEAM WEAPON AND GLOBAL INTRIGUEWhile Tesla’s birthday predictions seemed simultaneously mundane and far-fetchedto reporters, the old illusionist succeeded in getting their attention at his1934 birthday press conference. During that interview, Tesla announced that hewas perfecting a particle beam weapon. As the New York Times explained, Teslanow claimed that he could “send concentrated beams of particles through the freeair, of such tremendous energy that they will bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemyairplanes at a distance of 250 miles from a defending nation’s border and willcause armies of millions to drop dead in their tracks.” Invoking the same themethat he had used in 1898 with his radio-controlled boat (see Chapter 12[021_Chapter021.xhtml]), Tesla promised that this new invention would abolishwar because this death beam “would surround each country like an invisibleChinese wall, only a million times more impenetrable. It would make every nationimpregnable against attack by airplanes or by large invading armies.”32[029_BM029.xhtml#d1062]Did Tesla actually design such a weapon? For many years, engineers and Teslafans did not know for sure, but in 1984 a paper surfaced that circulated amongTesla specialists and was later confirmed as genuine by the Tesla Museum inBelgrade. Titled “The New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energythrough Natural Media,” this paper outlined a system for accelerating minutetungsten or mercury particles to very high speeds. Still not convinced of theefficacy of Hertzian waves, Tesla insisted on using particles, not rays: “I wantto state explicitly that this invention of mine does not contemplate the use ofany so-called ‘death rays.’ Rays are not applicable because they cannot beproduced in requisite quantities and diminish rapidly in intensity withdistance.”33 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1063] In addition, Tesla undoubtedly wanted todistance himself from free-wheeling characters like Harry Grindell Matthews, whotold English newspapers in 1924 that he had developed a death ray that couldbring down airplanes but which he refused to demonstrate to skeptical Britishgovernment officials. In particular, the Air Ministry wanted Grindell Matthewsto prove that his ray could deliver enough power to kill the pilot in an enemyplane by making his blood boil.34 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1064]Rather than using rays, then, Tesla’s plan was to accelerate tiny mercuryparticles to a velocity forty-eight times the speed of sound. To energize theseparticles, Tesla proposed an electrostatic generator similar to Robert Van deGraaff’s design, but in place of a charge-carrying belt he would use acirculating stream of desiccated air propelled by a Tesla pump or blower throughhermetically sealed ductwork (Figure 16.5 [025_Chapter025.xhtml#fig16_5]). Thisstream of air would pass two discharge points where it would be ionized byhigh-voltage direct current. The ions would then be carried up by the airstreamwhere the charge would accumulate in a large spherical terminal similar to oneused on the top of the Wardenclyffe tower. To increase the electrical capacityof the spherical terminal, it was studded with evacuated glass bulbs, each ofwhich contained an umbrella-shaped electrode. “I am confident,” wrote Tesla,“that as much as one hundred million volts will be reached with such atransmitter providing a tool of inestimable value for practical purposes as wellas scientific research.”35 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1065]image [Images/pg_399.jpg]FIGURE 16.5.

From NTM. Inside the sphere, Tesla would maintain a high vacuum into which he wouldintroduce millions of tiny mercury particles. Although Tesla did not specifyexactly how it would happen, these particles would be charged to the same highvoltage of the whole sphere and then accelerated out of the sphere through aspecially designed projector (Figure 16.6 [025_Chapter025.xhtml#fig16_6]). Theprojector would shoot a single row of highly charged particles that woulddeliver prodigious amounts of energy over a great distance. Again, Teslaprovided no explanation as to how he would keep the particles in the beam fromscattering as they left the projector and headed toward a target.In certain ways, Tesla’s design for this beam weapon reflected the state of theart in high-voltage engineering. When evaluated in 1943 by John Trump, who hadearned his Ph.D. at MIT with van de Graaff, Trump noted, “The proposed schemebears some relation to present means for producing high-energy cathode rays bythe cooperative use of a high-voltage electrostatic generator and an evacuatedelectron acceleration tube.”Though the basic principle of using electrostatic forces to accelerate particlesis sound—it is used in multiple devices ranging from the picture tubes in oldertelevisions to the gigantic particle accelerators employed in nuclearphysics—Tesla’s description is not sufficiently detailed to conclude that hecould have actually built such a weapon. To quote Trump again, “Tesla’sdisclosures … would not enable the construction of workable combinations ofgenerator and tube even of limited power, though the general elements of such acombination are succinctly described.”In particular, modern particle accelerators use massive amounts of energy toimpart high velocities to subatomic particles such as electrons and protons, andit would take even more energy to accelerate the sort of macroscopic particlesthat Tesla had in mind in order to have them travel any distance. As Trumpconcluded, “It is well known … that such devices, while of scientific andmedical interest, are incapable of the transmission of large amounts of power innon-dispersed beams over long distances.”36 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1066]image [Images/pg_401.jpg]FIGURE 16.6. Diagrams showing the projector that Tesla planned to use to shoot astream of highly-charged mercury particles from his beam weapon.Source: NT, “The New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive EnergyThrough Natural Media,” Figs. 1 and 5. From NTM.Indeed, Paul Nahin argues that in order for Tesla’s particle beam weapon tosatisfy the British Air Ministry’s requirement of making even one pilot’s bloodboil, the beam would have to deliver over 36,960 watts of power. To destroy anarmy of one million soldiers—as Tesla claimed his weapon could do—one would need7.4 nuclear reactors each delivering 5,000 megawatts. Clearly the power requiredfor this weapon raises questions about its feasibility.37[029_BM029.xhtml#d1067]In spite of its impracticality, Tesla’s beam weapon generated a great deal ofpublicity when it was announced in 1934. Sensing an opportunity, Tesla contactedseveral governments and let a shady character, Titus deBobula, draw uparchitectural plans for what the new tower might look like. A Hungarianarchitect, deBobula met Tesla in New York in the 1890s when Tesla “took theyouth under his protection” and helped him book passage back to Hungary.DeBobula subsequently returned to America, married an heiress, and set up anarchitectural practice. However, Tesla and deBobula soon parted in 1935 whendeBobula tried to borrow money from Tesla and to get him involved in a dealselling arms to Paraguay. Nevertheless, some Tesla fans believe that deBobulahelped Tesla set up a secret laboratory underneath the 59th Street bridge inManhattan.38 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1068]Tesla pitched the particle beam weapon to Jack Morgan, who had previously loanedhim money to develop the turbine. As Tesla explained to Jack in November 1934:The flying machine has completely demoralized the world, so much that in somecities, as London and Paris, people are in moral fear from aerial bombing. Thenew means I have perfected afford absolute protection against this and otherforms of attack.You know how your father assisted me in the development of my wireless system.He did not get any returns but I am convinced that if he were living he would begratified by the knowledge that my inventions are universally applied. I stillgratefully remember your own support although the war deprived me of the successI had achieved.…These new discoveries, which I have carried out experimentally on a limitedscale, have created a profound impression. One of the most pressing problemsseems to be the protection of London and I am writing to some influentialfriends in England hoping that my plan will be adopted without delay. TheRussians are very anxious to render their borders safe against Japanese invasionand I have made them a proposal which is being seriously considered. I have manyadmirers there especially on account of the introduction of my alternatingsystem to an extent unprecedented. Some years ago Lenin made me twice insuccession very tempting offers to come to Russia but I could not tear myselffrom my laboratory work.Words cannot express how much I am aching for the same facilities which I thenhad at my disposal and for the opportunity of squaring my account with yourfather’s estate and yourself. I am no longer a dreamer but a practical man ofgreat experience gained in long and bitter trials. If I had now twenty fivethousand dollars to secure my property and make convincing demonstrations Icould acquire in a short time colossal wealth. Would you be willing to advanceme this sum if I pledged to you these inventions?39 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1069]Jack Morgan declined to underwrite Tesla’s work on the particle beam weapon, butTesla did not hesitate to use his particle beam in his ongoing financialskirmishes with the management of New York hotels. When the managers at theGovernor Clinton Hotel demanded that he pay his $400 bill, Tesla offered aworking model of his weapon to them as collateral. Since the model wassupposedly worth $10,000, the managers accepted Tesla’s offer and the oldgentleman signed a promissory note. However, when Tesla delivered the model tothe hotel clerk, he gravely warned that the box would detonate if opened by anunauthorized person; sufficiently frightened, the staff hid the model in thehotel’s backroom vault.40 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1070]In the meantime, several different countries expressed concern over and interestin his particle beam weapon. Hearing that Tesla might offer the weapon to theLeague of Nations in Geneva, Breckinridge Long, the U.S. ambassador to Italy,warned that “if Tesla should give the secret to Geneva, it would be in the handsof half a dozen governments in Europe and they would be using the beam insteadof guns to fight one another. If the United States Government should obtaincontrol of it, no other government would obtain it and the American governmentcould act as a guardian.”41 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1071] A career diplomat, Long hadworked with Woodrow Wilson to help establish the League, but the StateDepartment ignored his advice and assumed responsibility for Tesla’s weapon.Tesla next entered into negotiations with the Soviets. In April 1935 he signedan agreement with the Amtorg Trading Corporation. Founded by Armand Hammer in1924, Amtorg ostensibly coordinated trade between the United States and the USSRwhile collecting intelligence on American science and technology for the Sovietmilitary. In return for $25,000, Tesla agreed “to supply plans, specification,and complete information on a method and apparatus for producing high voltagesup to 50 million volts, for producing very small particles in a tube open toair, for increasing the charge of the particles to the full voltage of the highpotential terminal, and for projecting the particles to distances of a hundredmiles or more. The maximum speed of the particles was specified as not less than350 miles per second.” Soviet scientists and engineers studied Tesla’s plans andcorresponded with him further, but we do not know whether the Soviets testedsuch a device in the 1930s.42 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1072]While Tesla entered into an agreement with the Soviets, he also offered hisweapon to the British government under Neville Chamberlain for $30 million. Inthe mid-1930s, Chamberlain sought to create a stable Europe by adopting aconciliatory stance toward Adolf Hitler and Germany, and Chamberlain may havehoped that by acquiring (or even appearing to acquire) Tesla’s weapon he coulddeter any further aggressive moves by Hitler. Hence Tesla corresponded with theBritish government in 1936 and 1937, but in January 1938 the British politelydeclined to pursue the matter further.43 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1073]During the period in which he carried on these global negotiations, Teslaclaimed that spies tried to steal his plans for the particle beam weapon. Hisroom had been broken into and his papers examined, but the thieves leftempty-handed. The reason for this, explained the old man to O’Neill, was that hehad not committed any of the key details to paper but carried them around in hishead.44 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1074]Following the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Tesla made another attempt tointerest the U.S. government in funding his particle beam weapon. On hiseighty-fourth birthday in 1940, he announced that he was ready to work withWashington to introduce a new beam weapon, his “teleforce,” which was not basedon his wireless power inventions but on a new principle. As the Baltimore Sunreported,The beam, he said, would be only one hundred-millionth of a square centimeter indiameter and could be generated from a special plant that would cost no morethan $2,000,000 and would take only about three months to construct. A dozensuch plants, located at strategic positions along the coast, he said, would beenough to defend the country against all possible aerial attack.The beam would melt any [airplane’s] engine, whether Diesel or gasoline driven,and would also ignite any explosives aboard. No possible defense against itcould be devised, as it would be all-penetrating, he declared.Tesla informed the reporters that he was ready to go to work for the governmentat once and that he was in good health. However, should the government take uphis offer, he warned, “I would have to insist on one condition—I would notsuffer interference from any experts. They would have to trust me.” Notsurprisingly, Tesla did not hear back from federal officials. Although J. EdgarHoover at the FBI received a tip about Tesla’s latest plan, Hoover appears tohave been indifferent to the old Wizard’s predictions.45 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1075]A QUIET DEATH AND A FINAL ILLUSIONDespite Tesla’s claims that he was feeling well, by 1940 his health was indecline. Three years earlier, while taking his daily walk around Manhattan, hehad been hit by a taxi. Tesla refused medical treatment for his injuries and henever fully recovered. Tesla had always been particular about what he ate, butnow he insisted on a strict diet, first of boiled vegetables, then only warmmilk. Staff at the Hotel New Yorker described him as having “a vigoroustemperament and emphatic ideas about personal health,” which included keepingeveryone at least three feet away to avoid their germs. Worried about hishealth, the Nikola Tesla Institute in Yugoslavia arranged a monthly stipend of$600 beginning in 1939.46 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1076]By 1942, Tesla spent much of his time in bed, mentally active but physicallyweak. He was suffering from some senility; in July he sent a telegraph messengerboy to deliver $100 to Mark Twain (who had died in 1913) at 35 South FifthAvenue, the address of his old laboratory.47 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1077] Teslarefused to see most visitors, but at the behest of his nephew Sava Kosanović hemet with King Peter II, the exiled ruler of Yugoslavia. Tesla also spent sometime discussing his particle beam and other inventions with a young man fromKansas named Bloyce Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald had studied electrical engineeringand had corresponded with Tesla since 1935 about his own anti-tank gun; someTesla fans think that Fitzgerald was personally appointed by President Rooseveltto look after the ailing inventor.48 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1078]Tesla died quietly in his sleep on the night of 7 January 1943, and the causelisted on his death certificate was coronary thrombosis or heart attack. Hisfuneral took place on 12 January at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in NewYork, and like the funerals of his parents, the service was presided over byseveral priests prominent in the Serbian Orthodox Church. It was attended by anumber of scientific dignitaries and two thousand mourners. Among those at thefuneral was fellow radio pioneer Edwin Howard Armstrong, who commented, “Theworld, I think, will wait a long time for Nikola Tesla’s equal in achievementand imagination.”49 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1079]In the days that followed, condolences were received from the president andEleanor Roosevelt, Vice President Henry A. Wallace, and several Nobel Prizewinners. New York City mayor Fiorello LaGuardia offered a eulogy on the radio.Although it is not traditionally done in the Serbian Orthodox Church, Kosanovićdecided that Tesla’s remains should be cremated.50 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1080]In the weeks following Tesla’s death, the U.S. government became momentarilyworried about Tesla’s particle beam and hence the contents of his papers,setting off years of speculation that there was indeed a beam weapon and agovernment cover-up. 51 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1081] In the 1980s, under the Freedomof Information Act, the FBI released 250 pages of documents related to Tesla,and Tesla aficionados have combed these papers looking for a conspiracy. Myreading of these documents suggests a curious story of greed and bureaucraticpolitics but no conspiracy.On the morning after Tesla died, Kosanović went to Tesla’s room at the Hotel NewYorker, ostensibly to see if his uncle had left a will. Then director of theEastern and Central European Planning Board for the Balkans, Kosanović assumedthat, as Tesla’s nephew, he was the rightful heir to his uncle’s papers andbelongings. Kosanović was accompanied by his assistant, Charlotte Muzar,Bogoljub Jevtic, Boris Furlan, Kenneth Swezey, and radio historian George Clark.Since the safe was locked, Kosanović called in a locksmith to open it and changethe combination. In the presence of three assistant managers from the hotel,Kosanović and his group inspected the contents of the safe and found Tesla’sEdison Medal and a key ring. Kosanović removed a few photographs and the 1931volume of birthday letters and then shut the safe again.52[029_BM029.xhtml#d1082]While this was happening, Abraham N. Spanel informed Percy E. Foxworth in theFBI’s New York office that the bureau needed to check on Kosanović and Tesla’spapers. An entrepreneur, Spanel was born in Russia and immigrated to the UnitedStates when he was ten. In the 1930s, he built up the International LatexCorporation in Dover, Delaware, to manufacture Playtex girdles, brassieres,infant wear, and rubber gloves. A liberal Democrat, Spanel had close ties toVice President Henry A. Wallace, and Spanel was later accused by conservativesyndicated columnist Westbrook Pegler of being a communist. Spanel warnedFoxworth that Tesla supposedly had an intense dislike for his nephew, thatKosanović would make Tesla’s plans for a beam weapon available to the enemy, andthat one of Vice President Wallace’s aides had told him that the government wasvitally interested in Tesla’s papers.53 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1083]Spanel knew about Tesla’s weapon plans because he was acquainted with BloyceFitzgerald. Early in the war, Fitzgerald had lined up a deal to sell hisanti-tank gun to Remington Arms, but without telling Fitzgerald, Spanelconvinced Remington to renege on the deal. Instead, Spanel arranged forFitzgerald to develop the gun with the Higgins Boat Company in New Orleans inreturn for Spanel getting 80% of the profits. So why did Spanel go to the FBIabout the Tesla plans? My guess (and it’s only a guess) is that Spanel did notwant Kosanović to get the plans in the hope that Fitzgerald would gain access tothem so that he and Fitzgerald could then develop a weapon that they could sellto a military contractor.54 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1084]Spanel’s concerns paralleled what the FBI’s New York office had already beentold by Fitzgerald on 7 January 1943, and so Foxworth sent a teletype to theOffice of the Director of the FBI in Washington asking what steps should betaken. D. Milton Ladd, one of J. Edgar Hoover’s two assistant directors, tookthe view that Kosanović should not be trusted and suggested that the New Yorkoffice contact the New York State Attorney to see if Kosanović could be takeninto custody on a burglary charge. However, in the meantime, another FBI agent,L.M.C. Smith, contacted the Office of the Alien Property Custodian (OAPC); thisagency was interested in the case because even though Tesla was an Americancitizen, Kosanović was not, and hence the papers were now alien property andcould be confiscated by the government if necessary. As far as the FBI wasconcerned, letting the OAPC take over was a perfect solution—the papers wouldnot fall in Kosanović’s hands (whom the FBI did not like) and the FBI did nothave to get involved. As the other assistant FBI director, Edward A. Tamm,concluded, “L.M.C. Smith is handling this with [the] Alien Property Custodian sothere appears to be no need for us to mess around in it.”55[029_BM029.xhtml#d1085]Consequently, Walter C. Gorsuch of the OAPC went to the Hotel New Yorker andseized all of Tesla’s property in his bedroom and the adjoining storeroom.Consisting of two truckloads of material, this property was taken to theManhattan Storage Company where there were already eighty barrels and bundlesthat Tesla deposited nine to ten years earlier. To determine whether there wasanything vital to the war effort, the OAPC called in John G. Trump to examinethe papers. Working on radar at MIT’s Radiation Laboratory and an expert onhigh-voltage generators, Trump was well suited to undertake the review.56[029_BM029.xhtml#d1086] In addition to Trump, the OAPC allowed one of the topagents from Naval Intelligence, Willis De Vere George, to be present along withtwo enlisted men.57 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1087] On 26–27 January 1943, Trumpreviewed Tesla’s files while the navy personnel microfilmed the papers that theyfound interesting.After two days of rummaging through the papers at Manhattan Storage and findingnothing of interest, Trump decided that they should investigate the box thatTesla had left at the Governor Clinton Hotel. Arriving at the hotel, Trump andhis group were escorted to the back storeroom where the managers brought out thebox; recalling Tesla’s dire warnings that the box would explode if opened by anunauthorized individual, the managers promptly left the storeroom. The agentsaccompanying Trump also pulled back, leaving him to open the box alone.As Trump recalled, the box was wrapped in brown paper and tied with string. Ashe cut the string with his pocketknife, Trump thought that it was a lovely dayand that he ought to be outdoors enjoying the weather. Removing the paper, hesaw that the box was made of polished wood, typical of that used for the storageof a scientific instrument. Taking a deep breath, Trump lifted the hinged lid,only to discover that it contained an old resistance box, the kind used tomeasure resistance using the Wheatstone bridge technique. From beyond the grave,Tesla had pulled off one final illusion.58 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1088]On the basis of his review of the materials, Trump reported to OAPC that “it ismy considered opinion that there exist among Dr. Tesla’s papers and possessionsno scientific notes, descriptions of hitherto unrevealed methods or devices, oractual apparatus which could be of significant value to this country or whichconstitute a hazard in unfriendly hands. I can therefore see no technical ormilitary reason why further custody of the property should be retained.”Consequently, the OAPC released the papers to Kosanović.59[029_BM029.xhtml#d1089]Deeply embroiled in Yugoslav politics—at the outbreak of the war, Kosanović wasloyal to King Peter II, but at some point he switched his allegiance to the newleader, Marshall Tito—Kosanović was in no position to do anything with the Teslamaterials.60 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1090] However, no sooner had the OAPC releasedthe papers to Kosanović than the New York State Department of Taxation put themunder seal until Tesla’s back taxes were paid. Over the next seven years, thematerials stayed at the Manhattan Storage Company while Charlotte Muzar paid themonthly rent.61 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1091]In June 1946, Kosanović returned to America as the Yugoslav ambassador. Withfunds from either the Yugoslav government or the Tesla Institute, Kosanovićhired a lawyer, paid Tesla’s remaining bills and back taxes, and arranged forthe papers to be shipped from New York to a new museum being created inBelgrade. The papers arrived in the fall of 1951, and in February 1957 Muzarcarried Tesla’s ashes back to his home country. There they were placed in theTesla Museum in a spherical urn—Tesla’s favorite geometrical shape.62[029_BM029.xhtml#d1092]Although Tesla’s papers eventually went to Yugoslavia, that did not stopgovernment scientists from being interested in them. In October 1945, the FBIreceived a request from Bloyce Fitzgerald, who, while only a private in thearmy, was supposedly heading up a top-secret project at Wright Field in Dayton,Ohio. The project was to perfect Tesla’s “death ray,” which the Army regarded as“the only possible defense against the offensive use by another nation of theAtomic Bomb.” Fitzgerald wanted access to either the Tesla papers at theManhattan Storage Company or the microfilm made by Naval Intelligence; the FBIdeclined to assist him, saying in true bureaucratic fashion that it did not knowanything about a microfilm that might be held by another agency. According toone letter in the FOIA file, scientists from the navy and the Office StrategicServices may have spent a month going over the microfilm, presumably in the1940s. Over the next forty years, numerous individuals contacted the FBI aboutTesla’s papers, and the bureau’s standard reply was that it did not have them.As government scientists became interested in the 1970s in Tesla’s fireballs asa way of containing nuclear fusion, they again asked the FBI about the Teslamicrofilm; curiously, no one seems to know what had become of the microfilm. Inmy mind, the disappearance of the microfilm does not make a conspiracy and“prove” that the Tesla papers contained plans for a secret weapon; as one of myprofessors used to say, “Never assume a conspiracy when mere ineptitude willsuffice as an explanation.”63 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1093]During the cold war, both the United States and the Soviet Union investigatedparticle beam weapons at various times in the belief that they could be used todisable incoming nuclear missiles. Most notably, in 1977 the retired head of AirForce Intelligence, General George J. Keegan, claimed in Aviation Week & SpaceTechnology that the Soviets were building a large-scale charged particle beam atthe Semipalatinsk Test Site in northeast Kazakhstan.64 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1094]Although Keegan’s claims were roundly denied by President Jimmy Carter andscientific experts, fear of a possible “death beam gap” provided the politicalimpetus for a significant expansion of American research into space-based beamweapons.Under the direction of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA),work began on the ALPHA chemical laser project in 1978, the TALON GOLD targetingsystem in 1979, and the Large Optics Demonstration Experiment (LODE) in 1980.These programs formed the basis for the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) thatRonald Reagan announced publicly in 1983. In the 1980s, the Department ofDefense added several programs to SDI including X-ray and chemical lasers aswell as the neutral particle beam weapon; reminiscent of Tesla’s “Chinese Wall”claims, SDI weapons were intended to create a “curtain” that would destroyincoming enemy missiles. While this work was under way, government scientistsagain asked the FBI about Tesla’s papers, particularly since they believed thatthe Soviets had studied Tesla materials in Belgrade and that a review of anyTesla-related papers in the United States would provide insight into the Sovietbeam weapons program.65 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1095]After the fall of the Soviet Union, American weapons experts visited theSemipalatinsk Test Site, only to discover that the Soviets had not been workingon a beam weapon at all but on nuclear-powered rockets. This new informationfrom Semipalatinsk prompted John Pike of the Federation of American Scientiststo call Keegan’s claims of a Soviet particle beam weapon “one of the majorintelligence failures of the Cold War.”66 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1096] Since, inprinciple, a beam weapon is possible, the U.S. military may be continuing toinvestigate them; however, just as in Tesla’s time, these weapons will requireenormous amounts of energy and pose formidable problems in terms of keeping thebeam from dissipating.67 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1097]"},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUEI misunderstood Tesla. I think we all misunderstoodTesla. We thought he was a dreamer and visionary. Hedid dream and his dreams came true, he did have visionsbut they were of a real future, not an imaginary one.JOHN STONE STONE, 1915In the decades since his death, Tesla has enjoyed a curious legacy. On one hand,he is acknowledged by engineers for his contributions to alternating current(AC), and in 1956 “Tesla” was adopted as the name for the unit of measure forthe flux density of magnetic fields. On the other hand, thanks to the manycolorful predictions he made about his inventions, Tesla has become a figure inpopular culture. In these closing pages, I wish to reflect not only on Tesla asa cultural figure but, more important, on what we can learn from him about theinvention process and the role that innovation plays in the economy. In doingso, we are completing the task that Brisbane posed that summer night in 1894when he interviewed Tesla: that we should seek “to discover this great newelectrician thoroughly; to interest Americans in [Tesla’s] personality so thatthey may study his future achievements with proper care.”1[029_BM029.xhtml#d1098]TESLA IN POPULAR CULTUREUnlike his contemporaries Edison and Marconi, Tesla never made it into thehistory books of the second half of the twentieth century. To be sure, hisinvention of the AC motor and his pioneering work with electromagnetic wavescertainly warrant a spot for him in the general American historical narrative.Tesla is absent from the history books, in part, because he never created amajor eponymous corporation to manufacture his inventions; until the recentcreation of Tesla Motors, there has been no equivalent of Marconi Cable andWireless or Consolidated Edison. Rather than seek profits from manufacture, aswe have seen, Tesla preferred to pursue a strategy of patent-promote-sell. Hencethere was no large company like General Electric (who sees Edison as theirfounder) or the Radio Corporation of America (which was based on Marconi’spatents) that needed to put Tesla forward as a “founding father.” Westinghousemight have used Tesla in this manner, but Tesla’s ties were primarily withGeorge Westinghouse personally and not with the managers who ran the company foras long as it lasted in the twentieth century.But another reason that Tesla is not in the history books of the late twentiethcentury is that in cold war America he was not a useful figure. Unlike ThomasEdison or the Wright brothers, Tesla was not born in America and hence could notrepresent “Yankee ingenuity”—the popular notion that Americans by nature werepractical and technologically creative. Moreover, since most people assumed thatTesla was a mystic who did not use theoretical science to develop hisinventions, he could hardly be invoked by those apostles of modernity whobelieved that technology grew out of research performed by scientists inuniversity and corporate laboratories. And unlike Edison or Henry Ford, both ofwhom were seen as ordinary folk who understood the needs of the common man andin response created mass-produced goods such as automobiles, electric lights,and motion pictures, Tesla seemed effete, elitist, and, well, eccentric.2[029_BM029.xhtml#d1099] For the cold war establishment, then, Tesla was bestignored—a curious outsider who could be forgotten.3 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1100]But it was exactly his outsider status—his mystical qualities, his impracticalstreak, his rejection by establishment figures like Edison and Morgan—that madeTesla a hero of the counterculture. How could they not love all of Tesla’swonderful claims about free wireless power, talking to Mars, a race of robots,abolishing war, and death rays? Beginning in the 1950s, quirky individualsembraced Tesla, playing up his interest in interplanetary communications. Forinstance, Arthur H. Matthews claimed that he had worked with Tesla and that theWizard had taught him how to build a “Teslascope” in order to communicate withaliens on other planets. Matthews also reported that Tesla had been born onVenus and that he knew this because “Venusians” had told him so during a visitto his home in Canada. Not to be outdone, Margaret Storm published a bookprinted in green ink that stated that Tesla had come by spaceship from Venus,accompanied by his “Twin-Ray,” the white dove. Storm, too, had her own specialradio set to contact extraterrestrials.4 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1101]During the energy crisis of the 1970s, Tesla became a hero of the free-energymovement. Adherents in this movement believe that there is advancedtechnology—often based on Tesla’s ideas—that has not yet been adequately definedby conventional physics that can be used to access energy in the universe.Free-energy researchers take seriously Tesla’s slogan that humans should be ableto utilize energy by “attaching their machines to the very wheelwork ofnature.”5 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1102] Some members of this movement believe that acorporate conspiracy—dating back to Edison and J. P. Morgan—is what preventsimproved energy technology from being developed or adopted. One example ofTesla-inspired energy research was Robert Golka, who attempted from 1970 to 1988to re-create Tesla’s Colorado experiments in order to generate artificial balllightning. Along with other scientists, Golka believed that fireballs could beused to develop techniques for containing high-energy plasma and usher innuclear fusion.6 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1103]To draw together free-energy researchers and other individuals interested inTesla, scientists and community leaders in Colorado Springs organized the firstTesla Symposium in 1984. Over the next fourteen years, this group held annualmeetings, published proceedings, created a museum, and established theInternational Tesla Society. At one point the society boasted seven thousandmembers worldwide, but as a result of internal political struggles, it wentbankrupt in 1998. In the decade since, Tesla aficionados have found homes in theTesla Engine Builders Association, the Tesla Memorial Society of New York, andCameron B. Prince’s Tesla Universe website.7 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1104]Tesla has also been attractive to believers in New Age philosophy. As analternative subculture, New Age thinking has been described as “drawing on bothEastern and Western spiritual and metaphysical traditions and infusing them withinfluences from self-help and motivational psychology, holistic health,parapsychology, consciousness research and quantum physics.”8[029_BM029.xhtml#d1105] Given his personal charisma (tall, dark, handsome, andmysterious), his efforts to develop his willpower as a boy, and his supposedinterest in psychic phenomena (which I think ran counter to his materialist viewof cognition), it is not surprising that Tesla crops up across New Age sourcesand practices. As we have seen, his story is very much one of cultivating andperfecting his “intense and wild nature” (see Chapter 12[021_Chapter021.xhtml]), in which he learned how to invent drawing on both hisrational faculties as well as his imagination; indeed, much of Tesla’s tale canbe interpreted as spiritual enlightenment and personal development.9[029_BM029.xhtml#d1106]One manifestation of Tesla and New Age beliefs are the Purple Plates used byindividuals to channel positive energy to address physical and emotionalailments. The plates were introduced by Ralph Bergstresser, who knew Tesladuring the last six months of his life and subsequently developed the platesbased on one of Tesla’s patents.10 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1107] Reflecting a mix ofscientific and spiritual beliefs, one supplier of Purple Plates, the Swiss TeslaInstitute, describes how these aluminum plates possess a lattice structuredesigned “to oscillate at a frequency that resonates with the frequency of theearth’s own electromagnetic field that permeates the cavity between the earth’ssurface and the ionsphere. This field is known as the Schumann Resonance fieldand … is considered to be associated with the biofield (Chi or Qi, Prana, Orgon,etc.) containing all the essential information and energy necessary for theproper functioning, growth and evolution of any life form.”11[029_BM029.xhtml#d1108]Much of the New Age interest in Tesla reflects the fact that not everyone iscomfortable with the rationality of modern life, particularly the assumptionthat technological innovation is driven by the inexorable logic of either themarketplace or science. The standard explanation today for why a new technologyis introduced is that it is either a response to market demand or the result ofscientific discoveries. Although both of these factors contribute to technology,they are not necessarily meaningful to everyone; some people would like tobelieve that new technology should also reflect the values, dreams, and wishesof a culture. Technology is so important in our lives that, for some people, itcannot simply be boiled down to the impersonal forces of the marketplace or thelaboratory.For these folks, Tesla is a welcome alternative. He reveals that there is moreto technology than relentless economic or scientific rationality. Althougheducated in engineering, Tesla refused to be guided exclusively by the dictatesof either science or the marketplace. Instead his inventions came from withinhimself, and through his inventions he sought to order his own life and thelarger world around him. In this sense, Tesla was like an artist or a poet, andhis contemporaries certainly described him at times as such. Thus, for peoplewho do not want to see the world in exclusively rational terms, Tesla is theirman. To quote Hamlet: “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, thanare dreamt of in your philosophy” (Act 1, Scene 5).I am not suggesting that New Agers are setting up a dichotomy between thematerial and the spiritual, that technologists have no soul.12[029_BM029.xhtml#d1109] Rather, what some individuals hunger for is a culture inwhich the spiritual and the material are intertwined. Tesla, as a cultural hero,neatly eliminates this dichotomy: he created great technology by being in touchwith his inner self, and he reveals that one can weave together the spiritualand the material.Some corporations have recognized how Tesla represents a blending of thespiritual and material. This is the genius behind the marketing of the electricroadster manufactured by Tesla Motors: like their namesake, they have figuredout how to produce an automobile that simultaneously speaks to both the spirit,in the sense of being environmentally sound, as well as to people’smaterialistic side in the sense of being fast, cool, and high-tech. One catchyslogan on the company’s website proclaims “Zero emissions, zero guilt.” As oneTesla car fan wrote on a Tesla Motors’ blog in 2009, “I am tired of the Greenrevolution being all bean sprouts and bicycles. Hell, yeah, Tesla is Green witha bite.… [M]y philosophy [is that] you don’t have to wear Birkenstocks and eatnuts and berries and sit cross legged for hours and meditate.… A cleaner greenerworld doesn’t mean we need to devolve back to the middle ages.”13[029_BM029.xhtml#d1110]As a proponent of extraterrestrial life, hero of free energy, and New Age saint,Tesla has proven to be an intriguing character for popular culture. He bringstogether the spiritual and the material, he challenges the corporateestablishment, and he invites flights of imagination to new technology and newworlds. For all these reasons, though Tesla may be absent from the historybooks, he can be found everywhere in popular culture: as a hard-rock band, inHollywood movies such as The Prestige (2006), in novels such as The Invention ofEverything Else (2008), in plays and operas such as Jeff Stanley’s Tesla’sLetters, and even a character in video games such as Capcom Entertainment’s“Dark Void Saga.” As a spokesperson for Tesla Motors, observed, “You know you’vegone into mainstream pop glory when you’re in a videogame aimed at 18-year-oldboys.”14 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1111]TESLA AND DISRUPTIVE INNOVATIONBut more than being an attractive figure for American pop culture, Tesla offersinsight into the nature of technological innovation from which we can drawlessons relevant for today and tomorrow.At first glance, this may seem like a surprising claim since it would be easy todismiss Tesla as being sui generis—that he was a highly eccentric inventor whoworked over a hundred years ago—and so what could inventors, engineers, andentrepreneurs possibly learn from him? Innovation in the twenty-first century isall about a rapidly expanding scientific frontier, large collaborative teams,venture capital, and global markets. What could a flighty visionary like Teslateach us that is relevant to the modern economy?To respond to this challenge, we need to recall Schumpeter’s idea that economiesgrow as a result of two kinds of innovation (see Chapter 2[011_Chapter011.xhtml]). On one hand, there are the creative responses ofentrepreneurs and inventors who introduce new products, processes, and servicesand in so doing dramatically change everyday life and reorder the industrialworld; as Clayton Christensen has suggested, these can be called disruptiveinnovations.15 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1112] On the other hand, there are the adaptiveresponses of managers and engineers who undertake the steady and incrementalwork of establishing the corporate structures, manufacturing procedures, andmarketing plans that allow products and services to be produced and consumed.Clearly the success of any economy depends on getting the right mix ofdisruptive and adaptive innovations.Tesla introduced two disruptive innovations that changed the American economy atthe end of the nineteenth and the start of the twentieth century. His AC motorin the late 1880s made it desirable for electrical utilities to shift from DC toAC so that they could provide not only lighting service but power that could beused by industry and consumers. By expanding the services that electricalutilities could provide, AC power allowed them to increase the size of theirsystems, pursue economies of scale, and drive down the cost of electricity overthe long term. Equally important, Tesla introduced the idea of polyphase power;by distributing AC using either two or three phases, electrical utilities foundthat they were able to efficiently transmit more power over longer distances. Ina nutshell, Tesla’s AC inventions were essential to making electricity a servicethat could be mass-produced and mass-distributed; his inventions set the stagefor the ways in which we produce and consume electricity today. For all thesereasons modern versions of Tesla’s AC motors can be found running householdappliances, powering industrial machinery, and even keeping the hard disks oflaptop computers spinning.With wireless power, Tesla saw himself as launching a second electricalrevolution; with this technology, he was going to pull an end-run around theexisting wired networks being used for power, telephony, and telegraphy. As wehave seen, Tesla was unable to perfect his system because he could not raiseadditional funds after he lost Morgan’s support and because he could not come upwith a way to introduce electrical energy into the earth’s crust; consequently,Marconi’s ideas about wireless telegraphy were pursued by companies in Europeand America. However, one should also keep in mind that while Marconi worked outpoint-to-point wireless telegraphy, a host of other inventors—Lee de Forest,Reginald Fessenden, John Stone Stone, and Edwin H. Armstrong—contributed theinnovations needed to create broadcast radio. Radio was not invented by Marconi;it was the result of an evolutionary process involving a variety of people,including Tesla.16 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1113]Tesla played a crucial role in the evolution of radio in two ways. First, hecame up with key ideas and devices—the importance of grounding transmitters andreceivers, adjusting capacitance and inductance in order to tune devices, andthe Tesla coil—all of which were borrowed and adapted by other radio pioneers.As his rival A.P.M. Fleming observed in 1943, Tesla “produced almostincidentally a whole succession of apparatus which was employed successfully byother workers striving for less ambitious ends. Had his primary concentrationallowed him to pay more attention to the tools which his inventive geniusimprovised freely, then the great influence he had on radio development wouldhave been obvious to all.”17 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1114] Radios, televisions, andcellular phones today employ variations of Tesla’s ideas about tuning circuitsto resonate to particular frequencies.Second, Tesla was important to the evolution of radio because he inspired—indeedgalvanized—his rivals into action. Tesla was one of the first inventors toinvestigate electromagnetic waves, and as his contemporary John Stone Stoneemphasized, Tesla “did more to excite interest and create an intelligentunderstanding of these phenomena in the years 1891–1893 than any one else.”18[029_BM029.xhtml#d1115] As we have seen, Tesla was a genuine inspiration to deForest (though de Forest’s subsequent actions harmed Tesla’s efforts), andMarconi and his associates kept an eye on what Tesla was doing. At the veryleast, Tesla’s rivals in wireless had to figure out ways to get around hispatents, whether by creating alternatives or by fighting him in court.TESLA AND THE PROCESS OF INVENTIONJust as it is useful to look at what Tesla invented—AC motors and wirelesspower—it is even more important to look at how he invented such disruptivetechnologies. Both facets of his creative style—ideal and illusion—offerinsights for inventors, engineers, and entrepreneurs wishing to developsimilarly bold innovations. In engineering and business schools, students aretaught how to objectively analyze the performance of machines and systems,estimate consumer demand, and create new devices on the basis of what theymeasure—to create what Schumpeter called adaptive innovations. In contrast, whatdo we actually know—as historians, entrepreneurs, or policymakers—about theother of kind innovation, Schumpeter’s creative innovation or Christensen’sdisruptive innovation? Where do these innovations come from? Are disruptiveinnovations simply caused by mysterious, unknowable forces like genius and luck?How does one harness disruptive technology so that it has a positive impact on acompany, the economy, and society at large? These are the questions that Tesla’sstory answers.Tesla’s great strength was that he was willing to think like a maverick. Withhis motor, for instance, while most other investigators worried about changingthe direction of the magnetic poles in the rotor, Tesla instead figured out howto create a rotating magnetic field in the stator (see Chapter 2[011_Chapter011.xhtml]). If everyone knocks at the front door, Tesla issuggesting, then one way forward is to go around the house and see if there is aback door.To find that back door, though, one needs to cultivate an expansive imagination.One needs to be willing to go on extended flights of fancy, to conjure up notjust shadows but entire machines and whole societies. Not all of us are able toaccess our imagination to this level and create images with the visual claritythat Tesla did—let’s face it, he did have an unusual childhood in which he hadto develop his imagination—but we need to cultivate, or at least tolerate, broadexplorations via the imagination. If we don’t take chances in our imagination,how can we even begin to find the maverick ideas or ideals?Yet imagination is only half of the cognitive process as described by Tesla: itwas the “wild” side of an inventor’s nature, but there was also an “intense”side as well (see Chapter 13 [022_Chapter022.xhtml]). In spite of the vastpopular literature celebrating Eureka moments, Tesla found that an insight,intuition, or hunches had to be refined in the mind through rigorous thought andanalysis. Tesla spoke to this refining stage when he described his creativeprocess in 1921:Here in brief, is my own method: After experiencing a desire to invent aparticular thing, I may go on for months or years with the idea in the back ofmy head. Whenever I feel like it, I roam around in my imagination and thinkabout the problem without any deliberate concentration. This is a period ofincubation.Then follows the period of direct effort. I choose carefully the possiblesolutions of the problem I am considering, and gradually center my mind on anarrowed field of investigation [emphasis added]. Now, when I deliberately thinkof the problem in its specific features, I may begin to feel that I am going toget the solution. And the wonderful thing is that if I do feel this way, then Iknow I have really solved the problem and shall get what I am after.19[029_BM029.xhtml#d1116]One small but visible clue of Tesla’s intense analysis is that at his SouthFifth Avenue laboratory there was “a small black board which hangs on the walland bears evidence of hard usage. The black is worn from this board in severalspots, and the rest of it is covered with figures and cabalistic signs.”20[029_BM029.xhtml#d1117] Tesla wasn’t drawing fantasies on that board but usingwhat mathematics he knew to hone and sharpen an ideal as it took shape in hismind. For Tesla, then, an ideal did not appear suddenly full-blown but was theresult of two cognitive activities: roaming around the imagination and carefullyexamining possible solutions. Without these two activities working together, inexquisite tension, I suspect that Tesla would not have invented anything.In our thinking about innovation and design today, we tend to dichotomizeimagination and analysis. We assume that inventors work primarily with theimagination and that engineers rely on rigorous analytical techniques drawn fromscience and mathematics. Seldom do we admit that, for the development ofdisruptive technologies, both activities are needed in the right measure. Oneneeds to dream but one needs to critically assess one’s dreams in terms ofscientific theory as well as available materials and techniques.21[029_BM029.xhtml#d1118]While inventors must keep imagination and analysis in exquisite tension in theirown minds, backers and patrons also help them maintain a useful balance betweenthe two. Tesla was extremely fortunate in his AC work that he had Charles Peckand Alfred Brown as his backers. These men encouraged Tesla to pursue his ideasfor an AC motor, but at the same time they provided the young inventor withvaluable feedback about what might actually work and what would appeal to thebusinessmen who would invest in or buy his patents. Peck and Brown were the hardflint against which Tesla’s steel struck, from which the sparks of genius couldignite the fire of a breakthrough.For Tesla, one of the great “what-ifs” is what might have happened if Peck hadnot died in 1890. With Peck’s business savvy, would Tesla have had the guidanceneeded to shape his wireless power ideas into a strong set of patents that inturn could have been developed into a workable product or service? Would radiohave developed more along the lines of lighting and power applications asopposed to communications? Unfortunately Tesla’s later backers, Edward DeanAdams and J. P. Morgan, were not in a position to work as closely with him inshaping his inventions. Without someone like Peck to provide a mix ofencouragement and critical advice, Tesla became intoxicated by the beauty of hisideal for wireless power and was not inclined to adjust his ideal to suitpractical and business considerations.The lesson to be drawn from Tesla and Peck is that we need to understand andappreciate how inventors and entrepreneurs forge relationships that foster abalance between imagination and analysis: the businessperson “grounds” theinventor’s dreams in existing business practices and expectations but at thesame time the inventor “inspires” the businessperson to see new possibilities inthe technology. Alexander Graham Bell had this sort of relationship with hisfather-in-law, Gardiner Hubbard, as did Thomas Edison with William Orton ofWestern Union, but we should ask the same questions about the relationshipbetween steam-engine pioneers James Watt and Matthew Boulton or Steve Wozniakand Steve Jobs with Mike Markula in the early days of Apple Computer.22[029_BM029.xhtml#d1119] For ideas to become disruptive technology, inventorsmust balance imagination and analysis not only in their own minds but also inrelationships with their backers.In thinking about how inventors interact with their backers, it’s now time toturn from ideals to illusions. My impression is that even for an inventor likeTesla it can be very difficult to fully grasp an ideal; at any given moment, onecan visualize in the mind’s eye some facets of the ideal but not necessarily allof them. Inventors learn how to work around this difficulty and, indeed, to eventake advantage of the ambiguity in their mental models as they generatealternative designs.23 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1120] But in sharing an ideal withothers, inventors have to confront this problem head-on: if they cannot fullyaccess the ideal, how can they convey it to friends, patrons, patent examiners,and customers? In the case of Tesla, we have seen that he resorted to usingimages, metaphors, and stories—what I have called “illusions” throughout thisbook. Illusions are not deceptions but approximations. Illusions are how anideal escapes the mind of one individual and gets into the mind of anotherperson. No ideal, no idea, no invention goes anywhere unless one is willing totell a story about it, a story that another person finds interesting andpersuasive.24 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1121]One major turning point in Tesla’s life was converting his tin-can motor intothe egg of Columbus demonstration apparatus in 1887. The tin-can motor thrilledTesla because it was the physical realization of his ideal, but this motor meantnothing to Peck and Brown. For them to see something of the ideal, Tesla had toclothe it in the Columbus story and create a compelling vision for them. Withthe egg apparatus, Tesla created an illusion of possibility for his backers;yes, this motor could be something that the electrical industry will want. Inturn, Peck and Brown worked with Tesla to use patents, reports in the technicalpress, his lecture, and laboratory demonstrations to create more illusions, toeffectively link Tesla’s motor with the needs and goals in the electricalindustry at the time. Through this skillful promotion, Peck, Brown, and Teslagenerated excitement about the motor, so much so that they convincedWestinghouse to sign a lucrative contract.To a very real extent, promotion as a business strategy is all about the shrewduse of illusion. The promoter must get people excited, willing to invest, butnot suspicious. The invention must fall in a good spot on the spectrum betweenfeasible and improbable. If it’s entirely feasible, then the invention may notbe all that novel and hence not worth very much; equally, if the promoteroverstates the case and the invention looks too good to be true, then investorsmay regard it as too risky and not invest. Hence getting the illusionsright—exciting but feasible—was a real challenge for Tesla and his backers; asthey seek investors, contemporary inventors and entrepreneurs face the samechallenge.Within this context, it is obvious that inventors need to be not only monitoringwhat is happening in the technical realm but also keeping a finger on thecultural pulse: What excites people? What are the burning issues of the day?What needs or dreams do people have to which an invention might be connected?From this perspective, it makes sense that Tesla became friends with RobertUnderwood Johnson and Mark Twain, for they were both carefully observing howAmerican society was taking shape as it entered the twentieth century. Here I amreminded of one letter Tesla sent in 1899 from Colorado to Scherff in New York,asking what sort of stories were circulating in the daily papers; feelingisolated in the mountains, Tesla was hungry for the cultural themes he needed toshape illusions.25 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1122]For an inventor and his backers, illusions can be quite tricky since they needto figure out how big an illusion should be. Should they tie an invention to thespecific and immediate needs of an industry?26 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1123] Shouldthey claim that an invention will revolutionize the whole industry? Or shouldthey invoke broader cultural wishes? In the case of the motor, Tesla and hisbackers stayed close to the needs and expectations of the electrical industryand succeeded in landing the Westinghouse contract. As Tesla matured and wasinfluenced by his friends, however, he framed progressively grander illusionsfor his inventions—his radio-controlled boat would abolish war, his wirelesspower system would revolutionize communications and the whole of society, histurbine was “the perfect rotary engine.”One way of looking at these grandiose claims is that Tesla simply let success goto his head. Another view is that he allowed himself to be unduly influenced byhis friends in the press such as T. C. Martin and Johnson.27[029_BM029.xhtml#d1124] But we can also ask a counterfactual question: if Teslahad kept his illusions modest, would anyone have paid any attention to hisinventions in the mid-1890s? To some extent, Tesla was responding to his era’s“yellow journalism.” As the large New York tabloids vied for circulation in the1890s, they sought out stories with oversized claims, and with each successiveretelling the claims had to be further exaggerated.28 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1125]The scale of Tesla’s illusions is thus both a product of his personality as wellas the way that popular culture was then taking shape.TESLA AND THE CREATIVE URGEIdeal and illusion thus tell us a great deal about how an inventor invents,about the process of creating disruptive technologies. But we might alsoreasonably inquire about why an inventor invents. This is, after all, abiography, and you are entitled to ask about motivation.I am going to focus here not on what motivates creativity in all sorts ofindividuals but on the specific case that Tesla represents: why do individualsgo to the trouble of creating disruptive technologies? To develop a disruptivetechnology, one has to take significant chances, to pursue new devices andbusiness practices, and though the personal and financial rewards are sometimesgreat, there are no guarantees of success. It is very hard to tell at an earlystage which disruptive technology will take off and what constitutes the keyinnovation that an inventor or company may need to control in order to profitfrom the disruption. Consequently, it is not surprising that lots of talentedengineers and entrepreneurs choose the safer path of developing technology inresponse to existing market demand; there, one can calculate the odds andconvert the chances into manageable risks. More than once, Tesla toldinterviewers that he could have taken the safer path and made a fortunedeveloping several inventions for which there was an immediate demand, but hechose to go after the grander and more difficult challenges.One explanation that is frequently put forward to explain disruptive innovationsin a variety of fields is what might be termed the “outsider argument.”Individuals who are outside the established social, political, and economichierarchy choose to innovate sometimes in order to gain access to the hierarchy,sometimes to challenge the status quo, and sometimes to do both. As outsiders,these creative folks do not see things in the same way as people inside thehierarchy and they have little to risk and everything to gain by innovating.One can certainly apply the outsider argument to Tesla. While the electricalengineering community in late nineteenth-century America was made up mostly ofnative-born Protestant men of English, German, or Dutch ancestry, Tesla was aSlavic immigrant—a Serb—and his Orthodox religious background was distinctlydifferent from the prevalent American Protestantism. Equally, we have clues thathis heterosexual peers were uncomfortable with Tesla’s attraction to men. And aswe have seen, Tesla eschewed the emerging professional norms of writing up one’sresearch in scientific papers for the more spectacular practices of bold publicdemonstrations and lively newspaper interviews. One indication of how Tesla’scontemporaries perceived him as an outsider is the story that, shortly afterhiring Tesla, Edison asked if he really was a cannibal.29[029_BM029.xhtml#d1126]The outsider argument is helpful but it does not fully capture what was going onwith Tesla. Yes, Tesla was an outsider seeking a place in the electricalengineering profession and respectable New York society, but by 1894 when he wasinterviewed at Delmonico’s, he had achieved status and respectability. What madehim keep going after that? Have we fully captured what made him tick?Through his inventions, Tesla sought to reorder the world around him. With hisAC motor, Tesla fervently believed in the ideal of a rotating magnetic field,even if that ideal required going from two to four or even six wires, changingthe frequency in AC systems from 110 to 60 cycles, and even building entirelynew systems for generating and distributing two- or three-phase power. ForTesla, the ideal of the rotating magnetic field was so compelling that ratherthan having him adapt his ideal to the world, the world should be reordered tomake space for his ideal. In like manner, Tesla expected that people would findhis wireless power scheme so obviously wonderful that they would shift from theexisting wired systems to his new ideal.So how did Tesla develop this desire to reorder the world to suit his ideals?Why would he even believe that it was possible? I think this desire stems fromthe way he developed his imagination as a boy in order to cope with his fears.From childhood, Tesla was confronted with a frightening and disorderly world onseveral levels: as Serbs, his family and relatives were strangers in the strangeland of the Krajina, the Austrian Military Frontier; his family was traumatizedby the loss of the oldest son, Dane; and Tesla himself suffered from scaryimages and nightmares. As we have seen, Tesla coped with this disorder bydeveloping his willpower and applying it to his imagination. Rather than beingcontrolled by fearful images, Tesla as a boy learned to channel his imaginationin ways that permitted him to overcome the nightmares and go on pleasant mentaljourneys.As he gained mastery over his imagination, Tesla applied this new talent toinvention with significant emotional consequences, which brought him to anothermajor turning point in his life. Since he could fly in his imagination, hewondered why he could not fly in real life; thus when he was twelve heexperimented with creating a flying machine powered by a vacuum pump. Nothingthrilled Tesla more than seeing that homemade pump work, as even a slight motionconfirmed that what he had imagined could come true in the material world, thatthe imaginary and material realms were indeed connected. In other words, ifTesla could imagine an orderly world, then it ought to be possible to make thatorder manifest in the material realm. Here was a powerful incentive to invent.The discovery that order in the imagination could map onto material practiceswas reinforced by what Tesla absorbed about the logos from the Orthodox faith ofhis father, that the material universe is not only orderly but that everythingin it—natural and man-made—has an underlying principle that can be discovered byindividuals. From his religious background, then, Tesla learned that there wereideals that he should uncover and apply to the material world. Throughout hislife, he strove to refine all of his faculties—mental, physical, andspiritual—so that he was as perfect an instrument as possible for detectingthose ideals.This brings us back to Schumpeter’s notion of objective and subjectiverationality. The typical engineer and manager use objective rationality in thatthey rely on measurements from the outside world: order is “out there” and theyjust need to find the pattern. In contrast, for the inventor and entrepreneur,order comes from within and they seek to apply this order to the outside world.New ideas, new disruptive technology come about when inventors and entrepreneursseek to impose that internal order on the outside world. For subjectivethinkers, the arrow runs from the inside to the outside, exactly the opposite ofhow objective thinkers see the world. Tesla’s admirer Kenneth Swezey appreciatedthe difference between the objective and subjective when he wrote to Tesla in1924 that “I have seen the recognized engineers scoff at your ideas, and hint atan unbalanced state of mind—but a mind certainly has to be somewhat unbalancedto overcome the momentum of flighty enthusiasm or the inertia of destructiveconventionalism. These fellows are so well balanced that they can spin aroundand around and around at such a uniform and unwavering rate, that an eccentricmovement—the energy and power behind the birth of a new satellite [i.e., aninvention]—becomes impossible.”30 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1127]So why did Tesla seek to impose his internal ideals on the outside world? Whytake up this struggle? Though it is undoubtedly different for every inventor andentrepreneur, Tesla sought to reorder the world as a means of compensating forthe disorder he felt inside. While Tesla possessed a great confidence in his“intense and wild nature”—his analytical and imaginative powers—he may have feltdisordered inside throughout his adult life. As we have seen, he could be highlycharming and sociable one day, withdrawn and taciturn the next. Equally, Teslahad periods of great energy and enthusiasm followed by spells of depression. Andhowever one chooses to interpret Tesla’s attraction to men, his sexual feelingsmay very well have contributed to his internal confusion. Hence Tesla was drivento invent, to impose his ideals on the material world in response to feelingdisordered inside. If he could get the outside world to align with the idealsthat came from his mind, he would again have some evidence of meaning in theuniverse.With wireless power, Tesla was especially driven to impose his vision on thematerial world. He truly believed that he had discovered the penultimate idealor, as he once told J. P. Morgan, the philosopher’s stone. Based on theconfirmatory evidence he gathered while in Colorado, he was utterly convincedthat his system would work. In the years following, Tesla stopped worrying aboutthe validity of his ideal and instead focused on getting the illusions right. Aslong as he lived like a millionaire at the Waldorf, had the support of J. P.Morgan, received ample press coverage, and worked on an impressive station atWardenclyffe, all would be right. In the sense that a magician worries aboutcreating the right illusion in the mind of the audience, so, too, had Teslabecome something of a magician. Wardenclyffe had to work because he was neverwrong; what he saw in his mind’s eye had to map onto the world. But withWardenclyffe, illusions got ahead of the ideal, and Tesla suffered a nervousbreakdown when he was unable to grasp the disjuncture between how he thought hissystem should work versus how the Earth actually responds.For Tesla, his ability to uncover an ideal and to find the illusions necessaryto convey that ideal to others were his great strengths but also his greatestweaknesses. With the AC motor and other inventions, Tesla successfully balancedideal and illusion in his mind and in his interactions with society. Tragically,with wireless power, Tesla became intoxicated by the beauty of his ideal butdistracted by his illusions; he did not find a balance between the two. As Teslaonce remarked, “Our virtues and our failings are inseparable, like force andmatter. When they separate, man is no more.”31 [029_BM029.xhtml#d1128]At the height of the Wardenclyffe adventure, Tesla wrote Morgan that “[m]yenemies have been successful in representing me as a poet and visionary.”32[029_BM029.xhtml#d1129] In doing so, his enemies were accusing him of notsolving the business and technical problems related to this project, and perhapsthey were right. But we should not let their complaints keep us from seeing whatTesla teaches us about disruptive technology. Radically new technology comesfrom within, from a willingness to discern ideals and to connect them to theneeds and wishes of society. Tesla reminds us that like poets, technologistsneed to think hard but dream boldly. Only by doing both will we be able to usetechnology, as Tesla did, to create a little bit of heaven here on earth."},{"pageContent":"NOTE ON SOURCESOne of the great pleasures of writing about inventors is that one has theopportunity to work with a wide range of materials, everything from love lettersand diaries to notebooks, sketches, and models to business and legal records. Tocreate the portrait of Tesla presented in these pages I have woven thesematerials together, and here I want to highlight the most useful sources so thatfuture Tesla scholars will be able to have a running start for theirinvestigations.The El Dorado for future Tesla study is the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade,Serbia. As I recounted in Chapter 16 [025_Chapter025.xhtml], all of the materialconfiscated by the Office of Alien Property was given in 1951 to the people ofYugoslavia, who in turn created this museum. The collections include not only160,000 pages of correspondence and technical notes but also Tesla’s clothing,personal effects, and a few scientific artifacts. For a detailed description ofthe museum’s collections, consult Marija Sesic, ed., Nikola Tesla Museum,1952–2003 (Beograd: Nikola Tesla Museum, 2003). During two visits to the TeslaMuseum (1998 and 2006), I was able to work with Tesla’s scrapbooks, publishedlegal testimony, and personal library. Over the years, the museum has graciouslyshared documents and photographs with me, and I hope that the museum will beable to provide access in the future to more of its manuscript holdings.To complement what was available from the Tesla Museum, I consulted a variety ofarchives in the United States and Europe, and these are listed at the end ofthis section. I found much valuable material in the papers of Leland Andersonand Kenneth Swezey, both of whom spent decades locating Tesla-related materialin the course of writing articles about the Wizard; both gentlemen hoped towrite biographies of Tesla. In the 1960s, the Library of Congress hoped tosecure a complete microfilm of the Tesla Papers that had gone to Belgrade, butonly seven test reels were made by the Yugoslavian archivists. These reels,however, offer a rich trove of letters between Tesla and George Westinghouse, J.P. Morgan, Robert Underwood Johnson, George Scherff, and Mark Twain. Thecollection at Columbia University includes a large number of additional lettersexchanged between Tesla, Johnson, and Scherff. Another remarkable collection arethe letters sent by Tesla to Edward Dean Adams during the planning of theNiagara power system in 1893, and these are part of the Western New YorkCollection at National Grid. For information on Tesla’s particle beam weapon, Irelied on the FBI file that was released in the 1980s under the Freedom ofInformation Act; the version I used can be downloaded at http://www.scribd.com/[http://www.scribd.com/] under “Freedom of Information Act file for NikolaTesla, Federal Bureau of Investigation.” Complementing my research in thesemanuscript collections, the Henry Ford Museum and the Science Museum in Londonhold a number of Tesla-related motors.In writing about nineteenth-century inventors, one can fortunately rely onpatent-related materials to glean insight into the creative process. Inparticular, I was very lucky to find Tesla’s 1902 testimony about his work onalternating-current motors in the Tesla Museum. In addition, Leland Andersonpublished Tesla’s testimony related to a patent interference case with ReginaldFessenden, as well as Tesla’s 1916 testimony in a case with Marconi. Citationsto these three testimonies can be found in the notes. Copies of Tesla’s U.S.patents can be readily downloaded from Google Patents, but Jim Glenn published acomplete set (New York: Barnes & Noble, 1994). If one wishes to examine thelegal minutiae of Tesla’s patents, one should consult John T. Ratzlaff’s Dr.Nikola Tesla Selected Patent Wrappers from the National Archives, 4 vols.(Millbrae, CA: Tesla Book Company, 1980).Over the years, the Tesla Museum has published several volumes of primary-sourcematerial for Tesla. Of these, the most valuable is Tesla’s Colorado SpringsNotes (2008), and the museum also produced facsimile editions of earliernotebooks from his work in Strasbourg and at the Edison Machine Works; again,full citations for these notebooks can be found in the notes. Another importantprimary source is Tesla’s autobiography, which first appeared in 1919 but hassince been widely reprinted and published on the World Wide Web. The version Iused was edited by Ben Johnston (Williston, VT: Hart Brothers, 1982).Next to manuscript sources and patent testimony, the most valuable resource formy research was The Tesla Collection: A 23 Volume Full Text Periodical/NewspaperBibliography (New York: The Tesla Project, 1998) compiled by Iwona Vujovic, withsupport and encouragement from Dr. Ljubo Vujovic. As the title suggests, thiscollection contains thousands of articles related to Tesla, culled from dozensof American newspapers, magazines, and technical journals. It covers the years1886 to 1920 and, as near as I can tell, is comprehensive; there are very fewpublished items on Tesla that do not turn up in these twenty-three volumes. Theavailability of this published collection made an enormous difference in myresearch. Also helpful in terms of searching out Tesla-related materials was Dr.Nikola Tesla Bibliography, edited by John T. Ratzlaff and Leland I. Anderson(Palo Alto, CA: Ragusan Press, 1979).Like any other biographer, I have relied on published books about Tesla forsources and clues. As noted in Chapter 11 [020_Chapter020.xhtml], the firstbiography of Tesla appeared in 1894 and was prepared by his editor and friend,Thomas Commerford Martin (The Invention, Researches, and Writings of NikolaTesla [repr., New York: Barnes & Noble, 1995]). This first biography includesTesla’s famous lectures on the AC motor and early wireless work. In 1943, JohnO’Neill released a second biography, Prodigal Genius; O’Neill was the scienceeditor for the New York Tribune and a personal friend of Tesla. O’Neill chose toportray Tesla as a Nietzschean superman with incredible mystical powers. Whileuseful, Prodigal Genius is exasperating because, like many books on Tesla, itlacks footnotes. Margaret Cheney wrote two biographies, Tesla: Man Out of Time(1986) and with Robert Uth, Tesla: Master of Lightning (1999); both are goodpopular treatments of Tesla, and the latter is richly illustrated. In 1996, MarcJ. Seifer brought out Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla (New York:Birch Lane Press). Seifer uncovered new Tesla letters in various archives andhelpfully published many of them verbatim in his text. In Wizard, Seiferconcentrates on dramatically reconstructing Tesla’s relationships with prominentindividuals such as Robert and Katharine Johnson, Mark Twain, and John JacobAstor, J. P. Morgan. Dan Mrkich’s Nikola Tesla: The European Years (Ottawa:Commoners’ Publishing, 2004) provides fresh information about Tesla’s formativeyears but needs to be used carefully because it lacks footnotes. Finally, oneshould be warned that there are a host of additional popular Tesla biographiesand novels which are frequently based on O’Neill’s biography and which continueto propagate many misleading ideas about Tesla.ARCHIVAL COLLECTIONSAmerican Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, PAElihu Thomson PapersBakken Museum, Minneapolis, MNMiscellaneous manuscript collectionColumbia University Library, Rare Books and Manuscript Library, New York, NYNikola Tesla PapersDeutsches Museum, Munich, GermanyJonathan Zenneck PapersFederal Bureau of Investigation, Washington, DCFreedom of Information Act file on Nikola Tesla, available athttp://scribid.com [http://scribid.com]Harvard Business School, Baker Business Library, Boston, MAR.

Puskás was not the inventor of the telephoneexchange but one of several entrepreneurs to see its potential. The firsttelephone exchange was established in May 1877 by E. T. Holmes in Boston when headded telephones to his existing burglar alarm network. See Carlson, “TheTelephone as a Political Instrument,” 25–55, on 42.35 [011_Chapter011.xhtml#s342]. Quotes are from NT, My Inventions, 59 and Teslabiography, 1890. It is difficult to establish the exact sequence of events inBudapest, as Tesla offered several versions in his recollections. The sequencefollowed here comes from the Tesla biography, 1890 and 1915 AutobiographicalSketch, which is that Tesla first worked at the telegraph office and then hadhis Eureka moment. Alternatively, My Inventions (59, 65) suggests that Teslafell ill waiting for the position with Puskás’s telephone company and only wentto work as a draftsman in the government telegraph office after he had hisEureka moment in the park.36 [011_Chapter011.xhtml#s343].

NT, My Inventions, 60–61.40 [011_Chapter011.xhtml#s347]. In his 1903 patent testimony, Tesla made nomention of drawing diagrams in the sand for Szigeti in Budapest in 1882.However, he did recall that he drew diagrams in the dirt when he explained hismotor to several colleagues at the Edison Lamp Works outside Paris around 1883.41 [011_Chapter011.xhtml#s348]. NT, My Inventions, 61.42 [011_Chapter011.xhtml#s349]. Szigeti testified in 1889 that Tesla told himabout a polyphase motor in Paris in May 1882, but he said nothing about a Eurekamoment in Budapest. See Szigeti, 1889 deposition.43 [011_Chapter011.xhtml#s350]. To be sure, there is a strong resemblancebetween the copper disk in Arago’s device and the disk rotors used by Tesla inhis first motors, and this resemblance led one textbook author to conclude that“Tesla’s motor is a form of Arago’s experiment … in which a revolving magnetdraws round after it a conducting disc.” See G. C. Foster and E. Atkinson,Elementary Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism (London: Longman, Green, 1896),490.44 [011_Chapter011.xhtml#s351]. Silvanus P.

Indeed, as far as I can tell, the concept ofalternating currents being in or out of phase with each other did not appear inthe engineering literature until an 1883 paper by John Hopkinson in which hediscussed the problem of using several ac generators on a single circuit; see“Some Points in Electric Lighting,” in Original Papers by the Late JohnHopkinson, ed.

Mario heard the storyfrom his professor at the Vienna University of Technology, Johann Sahulka, whoin turn had learned the story when he met Tesla at the 1893 Chicago World’sFair. Neither Mario nor Sahulka could determine whether Tesla worked at Ganz orwas just a visitor.3 [012_Chapter012.xhtml#s362]. “Foundry Museum, Budapest,”http://sulinet.hu/oroksegtar/data/kulturalis_ertekek_a_vilagban/Visegradi_orszagok_technikai_2/pages/angol/003_mo_muszaki_muem_ii.htm[http://sulinet.hu/oroksegtar/data/kulturalis_ertekek_a_vilagban/Visegradi_orszagok_technikai_2/pages/angol/003_mo_muszaki_muem_ii.htm];“Ganz Works,” http://www.omikk.bme.hu/archivum/angol/htm/ganz.htm[http://www.omikk.bme.hu/archivum/angol/htm/ganz.htm].4 [012_Chapter012.xhtml#s363]. Carlson, Innovation as a Social Process, 88–91.5 [012_Chapter012.xhtml#s364]. Tesla later explained that the two differentcurrents would have been the result of the two coils having differentinductances, but it is doubtful that in 1882 Tesla fully understood the conceptof inductance. What is important here is that he recognized that somehow twodifferent alternating currents were producing a rotating magnetic field. SeeMario, “Historische Betrachtungen,” 7.6 [012_Chapter012.xhtml#s365]. In his patent testimony, Tesla never mentionedthis story about the ring transformer at Ganz because, in all likelihood, he wasanxious not to suggest to his opponents that he had learned anything about ACfrom the engineers at Ganz, lest it then be suggested that he had simplyappropriated the idea of using AC to create a rotating magnetic field from them.In my view—thanks to his ideal of a rotating magnetic field—Tesla was probablyone of the few people who could have looked at the ball spinning on top of thering transformer and envisioned a practical motor.7 [012_Chapter012.xhtml#s366]. “1890 Biographical Sketch.”8 [012_Chapter012.xhtml#s367].

A year later, Wetzler wrote, “Theprominent feature of the year in electric lighting is the number of systems ofdistribution by means of induction transformers which have been brought out orelaborated.

I am careful in using “radio” or “radio waves”since these terms were not introduced until much later. Édouard Branly was thefirst to use radio as a prefix in 1897 in “radioconductor,” his term for thecoherer he developed to detect electromagnetic waves. In 1907, Lee de Forestused the term “radio” to describe wireless telegraphy and the word wassubsequently adopted by the U.S. Navy so that it became common by the time ofthe first commercial broadcasts in the United States in the 1920s.30 [015_Chapter015.xhtml#s548].

In 1891, Columbia College had its campus on 49thStreet between Madison and Fourth avenues. From 1857 to 1891, while the LawSchool was nominally part of Columbia, it was single-handedly run by Dwight as aproprietary school; hence, in all descriptions of Tesla’s lecture, the locationis given as Professor Dwight’s room.

In November 1897, Roosevelt gave a speech at Delmonico’s before theSociety of Naval Architects calling for a stronger U.S. Navy. Moreover, Teslawas a friend of Roosevelt’s sister, Corinne Robinson, and we know Tesla metRoosevelt at least once in 1899; as he told Corinne, “It was a great privilegeto meet your brother and to listen to his enlightening conversation.” See“Roosevelt on the Navy,” New York Times, 13 November 1897 and NT to Mrs.Robinson, 6 March 1899, Corinne (Roosevelt) Robinson Papers, MS Am 1785 (1362),Houghton Library, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA.35 [021_Chapter021.xhtml#s792]. “Pre-dreadnought Battleship,”http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-dreadnought[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-dreadnought].36 [021_Chapter021.xhtml#s793]. “Tesla Declares He Will Abolish War,” New YorkHerald, 8 November 1898 in TC 13:138–40, on 139.37 [021_Chapter021.xhtml#s794]. I am grateful to Antonio Pérez Yuste for callingthis distinction to my attention.

Yuste (”Early Developments,” 186) notes thatMarconi used Hertzian waves in 1896 to ring a bell on his receiver and thatseveral British patents were filed in 1898 for the remote control of torpedoesand ships.39 [021_Chapter021.xhtml#s796].

While LelandAnderson thought that Tesla must have done private demonstrations at MadisonSquare Garden, the sources he cites could be interpreted as listing people whosaw demonstrations of the boat at the laboratory. See Anderson, Guided Weaponsand Computer Technology, 129. See also O’Neill, Prodigal Genius, 175.41 [021_Chapter021.xhtml#s798]. See Thomas H. White, “W. J.

Several biographies assume that Tesla must havedisplayed his boat at the Madison Square Garden exhibition, but like the expertsat the Tesla Museum, I have not been able to find any evidence to support thisassumption. Indeed, the description of the boat quoted in the text suggests thatalthough Tesla had a working prototype in his laboratory by November 1898, hedid not necessarily have a boat that could be operated in water at the time ofthe exhibition in May 1898.

Astronomers today believe that the canals onMars were a result of perceptual psychology and the limited resolution oftelescopes available in the late nineteenth century. Unable to get completelyclear images of the Martian surface, astronomers allowed their imaginations toconvert the blurry images they were seeing into straight lines or canals. For ahistory of the Martian canals, see William Sheehan, The Planet Mars (Tucson:University of Arizona Press, 1996), especially 71–77, as well as W. G.

Fleming, Principles of Electric Wave Telegraphy,451; Hong, Wireless, 58, 72–73.6 [024_Chapter024.xhtml#chp_6]. Sungook Hong argues that Marconi was only ableto transmit across the Atlantic because Fleming designed such a powerful system(Wireless, 53–88). Like Tesla, Fleming used a regular transformer to step up thecurrent and to charge a large capacitor. When this capacitor discharged, theoscillatory current was sent through a second transformer that functioned in amanner similar to Tesla’s magnifying transmitter. Unlike Tesla, who added anextra coil between the secondary of his magnifying transmitter and the elevatedterminal, Fleming instead added another capacitor and a final transformer thatstepped up the current before it went to the aerial. To get a sense of thesimilarity of the transmitting equipment at Poldhu and that used by Tesla atColorado Springs, compare the photo of the interior of the Poldhu station (Hong,Wireless, p. 75, fig. 3.6 [012_Chapter012.xhtml#fig3_6]) with the interior ofColorado Springs (Figure 13.3 [022_Chapter022.xhtml#fig13_3]).

First and foremost, I am grateful to the Alfred P. SloanFoundation for a research grant that covered two years of full-time research andwriting. At the foundation, Doron Weber early on recognized the need for areliable biography of Tesla and has waited patiently for me to produce thisvolume. At the University of Virginia, my work on Tesla has been supported by agrant from the Bankard Fund for Political Economy, by a Sesquicentennial Leaveunderwritten by my colleagues in the Department of Engineering and Society, aswell as by funds provided by the School of Engineering and Applied Science. Thefunds from the Engineering School allowed me to maintain the momentum I hadgained while working under the Sloan grant, and I am grateful to ProfessorIngrid Townsend and Dean Richard Miksad for arranging for this extra support. Inaddition, a last-minute grant from James Aylor, the dean of the School ofEngineering and Applied Science, University of Virginia, has underwritten theinclusion of the book’s illustrations in future paperback and digital editions.Over the years, I have had the opportunity to spend time at several institutionswhere I could concentrate exclusively on this project. In the winter of 1999, Iwas a visiting professor in the Science, Technology, and Society Program atStanford University, and my thanks to Tim Lenoir and Robert McGinn for arrangingthat visit. In the fall of 2005, the Lemelson Center for Invention andInnovation at the Smithsonian Instituion invited me to be a research fellow, andduring that stay I learned a great deal from Arthur Molella, Joyce Bedi, andMaggie Dennis. Also during the fall of 2005, I was a visitor at the Centre forthe History of Science, Technology, and Medicine at the University ofManchester; my thanks to John Harwood for arranging this visit as well as to myEnglish family in Lymm who took me in and kept me well fed. In the summer of2010, I had the good fortune to be a scholar in residence at the DeutschesMuseum in Munich where I finished a first draft of this book; my thanks toHelmuth Trischler and Andrea Walther for making that appointment possible.This book is based on research using documents and artifacts found in a largenumber of archives and museums. I have enumerated the full list of researchrepositories used in the Note on Sources, and here I want to acknowledge theinstitutions and individuals who have made a significant difference in my effortto find Tesla-related materials.At the head of this list must come the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade, Serbia,which holds all of the papers and material in Tesla’s possession when he died in1943. I have been the beneficiary of assistance and guidance from the staff ofthe Tesla Museum, especially several of its directors: Alexander Marincic,Branimir Jovanović, Marija Sesic, and Vladimir Jelenković have all encouraged mein my efforts to understand Tesla and provided me with a great deal of usefulinformation. Ivana Zoric, also on the staff of the Tesla Museum, has been agreat help in securing the photographs illustrating this book.Beyond the Tesla Museum, I am grateful for the assistance of several archivistsand curators, especially Sheldon Hochheiser at the IEEE Archives, Leonard deGraaf at the Edison National Historic Site, and Marc Greuther at the Henry FordMuseum and Greenfield Village. I also wish to thank Jill Jonnes for introducingme to Robert Dischner at National Grid USA, who in turn provided me with copiesof Tesla’s correspondence with Edward Dean Adams. In the early stages of theproject, I was lucky to have several capable research assistants, particularlyJohn Bozeman and Amie Loyer. For assistance with translating several Germansources, I am grateful to Ingrid Townsend and Arthur Byrne. And thanks to BillKelsh, Pam Lutz, and Adarsh Ramkrishnan for their help in preparing theillustrations.I also wish to acknowledge all of the important work that Leland Anderson hasdone in relation to finding and preserving materials relating to Tesla. For wellover fifty years, Leland has devoted much of his energy to ensuring that Teslais not forgotten, and I detected his quiet efforts working in the background asI used various archival collections and publications.As a historian, I have turned to several technical experts for help inunderstanding how Tesla’s inventions worked, and I am grateful for the advice Ihave received from Sean Grimes, Gary Peterson, Paul Nahin, Robert Ribando, DavidWunsch, and Antonio Pérez Yuste. I know that there are multiple opinionsconcerning how Tesla’s later inventions relating to broadcasting power worked(or failed to work), and I take full responsibility for the interpretationpresented here.At Princeton University Press, it has been my pleasure to have Ingrid Gnerlichas my editor; Ingrid was incredibly patient in waiting for this book to come tofruition and was always a source of good cheer and sound advice. Ingrid’sassistant, Eric Henney, was marvelous in helping me secure permission for all ofthe illustrations. Jennifer Backer did a superb job in copyediting themanuscript and Tobiah Waldron prepared the wonderful index. Debbie Tegarden hasprovided the expert skills needed to shepherd my manuscript through theproduction process, ensuring that all of the details have come together to makethis into a book that is a pleasure to read and to hold.Many friends and professional colleagues have listened to my presentations onTesla and offered valuable advice. These individuals include Margy Avery, WiebeBijker, Oskar Blumtritt, Paolo Brenni, Jack Brown, Lynn Burlingame, SusanDouglas, Robert Fox, Mike Gorman, Anna Guagnini, Vigen Guroian, Meg Graham, EricHintz, Jeff Hughes, Richard John, Ron Kline, John Krige, Gunther Luxbacher,Keith Nier, David Nye, Bryan Pfaffenberger, Trevor Pinch, Klaus Plitzner, StuartSammis, Alex Wellerstein, Karin Zachmann, and Olivier Zunz. Bernard S. Finn andMichael B. Schiffer reviewed the manuscript for Princeton University Press andprovided very helpful comments. My daughters, Julia and Rachel, grew uplistening to far too many dinnertime orations about Tesla, but they nonethelessregularly offered comments that kept me on that narrow path between scholarshipand crackpot ideas. And I am very grateful to one of my professors, RobertKohler, who reminded me at a critical point in the writing process not to pullany punches and to develop a thoughtful and compelling framework forunderstanding Tesla.This book is dedicated to two people who are very dear to me. Tom Hughes hasbeen a mentor, professionally and personally, for thirty years and taught memuch of what I know about inventors. Early on, he recognized the importance ofunderstanding Tesla’s work and pushed me hard to make this book happen. Finally,this book is also dedicated to my wife, Jane, who has played countless roles inthis book and in my life. For this book, she has been a sounding board fortheories, the organizer of research trips, and editor extraordinaire; in mylife, Jane has been—and always will be—that anchor of love and hope that keepsme going.
