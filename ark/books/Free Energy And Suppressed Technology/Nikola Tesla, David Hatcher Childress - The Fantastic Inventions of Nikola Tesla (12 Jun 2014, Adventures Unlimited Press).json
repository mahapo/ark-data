For a longtime the Slav people—who, after the battle of Kosovopjolje, in which the Turksdefeated the Serbians, retired to the confines of the present Montenegro,Dalmatia, Herzegovina and Bosnia, and \"Borderland\" of Austria— knew what it wasto deal, as our Western pioneers did, with foes ceaselessly fretting againsttheir frontier ; and the races of these countries, through their strenuousstruggle against the armies of the Crescent, have developed notable qualities ofbravery and sagacity, while maintaining a patriotism and independenceunsurpassed in any other nation.It was in this interesting border region, and from among these valiant Easternfolk, that Nikola Tesla was born in the year 1857, and the fact that he, to-day,finds himself in America and one of our foremost electricians, is strikingevidence of the extraordinary attractiveness alike of electrical pursuits and ofthe country where electricity enjoys its widest application.Mr. Tesla's native place was Smiljan, Lika, where his father was an eloquentclergyman of the Greek Church, in which, by the way, his family is stillprominently represented. His mother enjoyed great fame throughout thecountryside for her skill and originality in needlework, and doubtlesstransmitted her ingenuity to Nikola; though it naturally took another and moremasculine direction.The boy was early put to his books, and upon his father's removal to Gospic hespent four years in the public school, and later, three years in the RealSchool, as it is called. His escapades were such as most quickwitted boys gothrough, although he varied the programme on one occasion by getting imprisonedin a remote mountain chapel rarely visited for service; and on another occasionby falling headlong into a huge kettle of boiling milk, just drawn from thepaternal herds. A third curious episode was that connected with his efforts tofly when, attempting to navigate the air with the aid of an old umbrella, hehad, as might be expected, a very bad fall, and was laid up for six weeks.About this period he began to take delight in arithmetic and physics. One queernotion he had was to work out everything by three or the power of three. He wasnow sent to an aunt at Cartstatt, Croatia, to finish his studies in what isknown as the Higher Real School. It was there that, coming from the ruralfastnesses, he saw a steam engine for the first time with a pleasure that heremembers to this day. At Cartstatt he was so diligent as to compress the fouryears' course into three, and graduated in 1873. Returning home during anepidemic of cholera, he was stricken down by the disease and suffered soseriously from the consequences that his studies were interrupted for fully twoyears. But the time was not wasted, for he had become passionately fond ofexperimenting, and as much as his means and leisure permitted devoted hisenergies to electrical study and investigation. Up to this period it had beenhis father's intention to make a priest of him, and the idea hung over the youngphysicist like a very sword of Damocles. Finally he prevailed upon his worthybut reluctant sire to send him to Gratz in Austria to finish his studies at thePolytechnic School, and to prepare for work as professor of mathematics andphysics. At Gratz he saw and operated a Gramme machine for the first time, andwas so struck with the objections to the use of commutators and brushes that hemade up his mind there and then to remedy that defect in dynamo-electricmachines. In the second year of his course he abandoned the intention ofbecoming a teacher and took up the engineering curriculum. After three years ofabsence he returned home, sadly, to see his father die ; but, having resolved tosettle down in Austria, and recognizing the value of linguistic acquirements, hewent to Prague and then to Buda-Pesth with the view of mastering the languageshe deemed necessary. Up to this time he had never realized the enormoussacrifices that his parents had made in promoting his education, but he nowbegan to feel the pinch and to grow unfamiliar with the image of Francis JosephI. There was considerable lag between his dispatches and the correspondingremittance from home; and when the mathematical expression for the value of thelag assumed the shape of an eight laid flat on its back, Mr. Tesla became a veryfair example of high thinking and plain living, but he made up his mind to thestruggle and determined to go through depending solely on his own resources. Notdesiring the fame of a faster, he cast about for a livelihood, and through thehelp of friends he secured a berth as assistant in the engineering department ofthe government telegraphs. The salary was five dollars a week. This brought himinto direct contact with practical electrical work and ideas, but it is needlessto say that his means did not admit of much experimenting. By the time he hadextracted several hundred thousand square and cube roots for the public benefit,the limitations, financial and otherwise, of the position had become painfullyapparent, and he concluded that the best thing to do was to make a valuableinvention. He proceeded at once to make inventions, but their value was visibleonly to the eye of faith, and they brought no grist to the mill. Just at thistime the telephone made its appearance in Hungary, and the success of that greatinvention determined his career, hopeless as the profession had thus far seemedto him. He associated himself at once with telephonic work, and made varioustelephonic inventions, including an operative repeater; but it did not take himlong to discover that, being so remote from the scenes of electrical activity,he was apt to spend time on aims and results already reached by others, and tolose touch. Longing for new opportunities and anxious for the development ofwhich he felt himself possible, if once he could place himself within the genialand direct influences of the gulf streams of electrical thought, he broke awayfrom the ties and traditions of the past, and in 1881 made his way to Paris,Arriving in that city, the ardent young Likan obtained employment as anelectrical engineer with one of the largest electric lighting companies. Thenext year he went to Strasburg to install a plant, and on returning to Parissought to carry out a number of ideas that had now ripened into inventions.About this time, however, the remarkable-progress of America in electricalindustry attracted his attention, and once again staking everything on a singlethrow, he crossed the Atlantic.Mr. Tesla buckled down to work as soon as he landed on these shores, put hisbest thought and skill into it, and soon saw openings for his talent. In a shortwhile a proposition was made to him to start his own company, and, accepting theterms, he at once worked up a practical system of arc lighting, as well as apotential method of dynamo regulation, which in one form is now known as the \"third brush regulation.\" He also devised a thermo-magnetic motor and otherkindred devices, about which little was published, owing to legal complications.Early in 1887 the Tesla Electric Company of New York was formed, and not longafter that Mr. Tesla produced his admirable and epoch-marking motors formultiphase alternating currents, in which, going back to his ideas of long ago,he evolved machines having neither commutator nor brushes. It will be rememberedthat about the time that Mr. Tesla brought out his motors, and read histhoughtful paper before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers,Professor Ferraris, in Europe, published his discovery of principles analogousto those enunciated by Mr. Tesla. There is no doubt, however, that Mr. Tesla wasan independent inventor of this rotary field motor, for although anticipated indates by Ferraris, he could not have known about Ferraris' work as it had notbeen published. Professor Ferraris stated himself, with becoming modesty, thathe did not think Tesla could have known of his (Ferraris') experiments at thattime, and adds that he thinks Tesla was an independent and original inventor ofthis principle. With such an acknowledgment from Ferraris there can be littledoubt about Tesla's originality in this matter.Mr. Tesla's work in this field was wonderfully timely, and its worth waspromptly appreciated in various quarters. The Tesla patents were acquired by theWestinghouse Electric Company, who undertook to develop his motor and to applyit to work of different kinds. Its use in mining, and its employment inprinting, ventilation, etc., was described and illustrated in The ElectricalWorld some years ago. The immense stimulus that the announcement of Mr. Tesla'swork gave to the study of alternating current motors would, in itself, be enoughto stamp him as a leader. Mr. Tesla is only 35 years of age. He is tall andspare with a clean-cut, thin, refined face, and eyes that recall all the storiesone has read of keenness of vision and phenomenal ability to see through things.He is an omnivorous reader, who never forgets; and he possesses the peculiarfacility in languages that enables the least educated native of eastern Europeto talk and write in at least half a dozen tongues. A more congenial companioncannot be desired for the hours when one \"pours out heart affluence indiscursive talk,\" and when the conversation, dealing at first with things nearat hand and next to us, reaches out and rises to the greater questions of life,duty and destiny.In the year 1890 he severed his connection with the Westinghouse Company, sincewhich time he has devoted himself entirely to the study of alternating currentsof high frequencies and very high potentials, with which study he is at presentengaged. No comment is necessary on his interesting achievements in this field;the famous London lecture published in this volume is a proof in itself. Hisfirst lecture on his researches in this new branch of electricity, which he maybe said to have created, was delivered before the American Institute ofElectrical Engineers on May 20, 1891, and remains one of the most interestingpapers read before that society. It will be found reprinted in full in TheElectrical World, July 11, 1891. Its publication excited such interest abroadthat he received numerous requests from English and French electrical engineersand scientists to repeat it in those countries, the result of which has been theinteresting lecture published in this volume.The present lecture presupposes a knowledge of the former, but it may be readand understood by any one even though he has not read the earlier one. It formsa sort of continuation of the latter, and includes chiefly the results of hisresearches since that time.[../Images/main-4.jpg]A 1924 DESIGN FOR A CENTRIFUGAL SPACECRAFT LAUNCHER BY MARK P.

There are among you not a few who can lay better claim than myselfon any feature of merit which this work may contain. I need not mention manynames which are world-known names of those among you who are recognized as theleaders in this enchanting science ; but one, at least, I must mention—a namewhich could not be omitted in a demonstration of this kind. It is a nameassociated with the most beautiful invention ever made: it is Crookes!\"When I was at college, a good time ago, I read, in a translation (for then Iwas not familiar with your magnificent language), the description of hisexperiments on radiant matter. I read it only once in my life—that time—yetevery detail about that charming work I can remember this day. Few are thebooks, let me say, which can make such an impression upon the mind of a student.But if, on the present occasion, I mention this name as one of many yourinstitution can boast of, it is because I have more than one reason to do so.For what I have to tell you and to show you this evening concerns, in a largemeasure, that same vague world which Professor Crookes has so ably explored ;and, more than this, when I trace back the mental process which led me to theseadvances— which even by myself cannot be considered trifling, since they are soappreciated by you—I believe that their real origin, that which started me towork in this direction, and brought me to them, after a long period of constantthought, was that fascinating little book which I read many years ago.And now that I have made a feeble effort to express my homage and acknowledge myindebtedness to him and others among you, I will make a second effort, which Ihope you will not find so feeble as the first, to entertain you.Give me leave to introduce the subject in a few words.A short time ago I had the honor to bring before our American Institute ofElectrical Engineers1 some results then arrived at by me in a novel line ofwork. I need not assure you that the many evidences which I have received thatEnglish scientific men and engineers were interested in this work have been forme a great reward and encouragement. I will not dwell upon the experimentsalready described, except with the view of completing, or more clearlyexpressing, some ideas advanced by me before, and also with the view ofrendering the study here presented self-contained, and my remarks on the subjectof this evening's lecture consistent.1 FOR MR. TESLA'S AMERICAN LECTURE ON THIS SUBJECT SEE THE ELECTRICALWORLD OFJULY 11, 1891, AND FOR A REPORT OF HIS FRENCH LEE TORE SEE THEELECTRICAL WORLDOF MARCH 26, 1892.This investigation, then, it goes without saying, deals with alternatingcurrents, and, to be more precise, with alternating currents of high potentialand high frequency. Just in how much a very high frequency is essential for theproduction of the results presented is a question which, even with my presentexperience, would embarrass me to answer. Some of the experiments may beperformed with low frequencies; but very high frequencies are desirable, notonly on account of the many effects secured by their use, but also as aconvenient means of obtaining, in the induction apparatus employed, the highpotentials, which in their turn are necessary to the demonstration of most ofthe experiments here contemplated.Of the various branches of electrical investigation, perhaps the mostinteresting and immediately the most promising is that dealing with alternatingcurrents. The progress in this branch of applied science has been so great inrecent years that it justifies the most sanguine hopes. Hardly have we becomefamiliar with one fact, when novel experiences are met with and new avenues ofresearch are opened. Even at this hour possibilities not dreamed of before are,by the use of these currents, partly realized. As in nature all is ebb and tide,all is wave motion, so it seems that In all branches of industry alternatingcurrents—electric wave motion—will have the sway.One reason, perhaps, why this branch of science is being so rapidly developed isto be found in the interest which is attached to its experimental study. We winda simple ring of iron with coils ; we establish the connections to thegenerator, and with wonder and delight we note the effects of strange forceswhich we bring into play, which allow us to transform, to transmit and directenergy at will. \"We arrange the circuits properly, and we see the mass of ironand wires behave as though it were endowed with life, spinning a heavy armature,through invisible connections, with great speed and power—with the energypossibly conveyed from a great distance. We observe how the energy of analternating current traversing the wire manifests itself—not so much in the wireas in the surrounding space —in the most surprising manner, taking the forms ofheat, light, mechanical energy, and, most surprising of all, even chemicalaffinity. All these observations fascinate us, and fill us with an intensedesire to know more about the nature of these phenomena. Each day we go to ourwork in the hope of discovering,—in the hope that some one, no matter who, mayfind a solution of one of the pending great problems,—and each succeeding day wereturn to our task with renewed ardor; and even if we are unsuccessful, our workhas not been in vain, for in these strivings, in these efforts, we have foundhours of untold pleasure, and we have directed our energies to the benefit ofmankind.We may take—at random, if you choose—any of the many experiments which may beperformed with alternating currents; a few of which only, and by no means themost striking, form the subject of this evening's demonstration; they are allequally interesting, equally inciting to thought.Here is a simple glass tube from which the air has been partially exhausted. Itake hold of it; I bring my body in contact with a wire conveying alternatingcurrents of high potential, and the tube in my hand is brilliantly lighted. Inwhatever position I may put it, wherever I may move it in space, as far as I canreach, its soft, pleasing light persists with undiminished brightness.Here is an exhausted bulb suspended from a single wire. Standing on an insulatedsupport, I grasp it, and a platinum button mounted in it is brought to vividincandescence.Here, attached to a leading wire, is another bulb, winch, as I touch itsmetallic socket, is filled with magnificent colors of phosphorescent light.Here still another, which by my fingers' touch casts a shadow—the Crookesshadow, of the stem inside of it.Here, again, insulated as I stand on this platform, I bring my body in contactwith one of the terminals of the secondary of this induction coil—with the endof a wire many miles long—and you see streams of light break forth from itsdistant end, which is set in violent vibration.Here, once more, I attach these two plates of wire gauze to the terminals of thecoil, I set them a distance apart, and I set the coil to work. You may see asmall spark pass between the plates. I insert a thick plate of one of the bestdielectrics between them, and instead of rendering altogether impossible, as weare used to expect, I aid the passage of the discharge, which, as I insert theplate, merely changes in appearance and assumes the form of luminous streams.Is there, I ask, can there be, a more interesting study than that of alternatingcurrents? In all these investigations, in all these experiments, which are sovery, very interesting, for many years past—ever since the greatest experimenterwho lectured in this hall discovered its principle—we have had a steadycompanion, an appliance familiar to every one, a plaything once, a thing ofmomentous importance now— the induction coil. There is no dearer appliance tothe electrician. From the ablest among you, I dare say, down to theinexperienced student, to your lecturer, we all have passed many delightfulhours in experimenting with the induction coil. We have watched its play, andthought and pondered over the beautiful phenomena which it disclosed to ourravished eyes. So well known is this apparatus, so familiar are these phenomenato every one, that my courage nearly fails me when I think that I have venturedto address so able an audience that I have ventured to entertain you with thatsame old subject. Here in reality is the same apparatus, and here are the samephenomena, only the apparatus is operated somewhat differently, the phenomenaare presented in a different aspect. Some of the results we find as expected,others surprise us, but all captivate our attention, for in scientificinvestigation each novel result achieved may be the centre of a new departure,each novel fact learned may lead to important developments.Usually in operating an induction coil we have set up a vibration of moderatefrequency in the primary, either by means of an interrupter or break, or by theuse of an alternator. Earlier English investigators, to mention onlySpottiswoode and J. E. H. Gordon, have used a rapid break in connection with thecoil. Our knowledge and experience of to-day enables us to see clearly why thesecoils under the conditions of the tests did not disclose any, remarkablephenomena, and why able experimenters failed to perceive many of the curiouseffects which have since been observed.In the experiments such as performed this evening, we operate the coil eitherfrom a specially constructed alternator capable of giving many thousands ofreversals of current per second, or, by disruptively discharging a condenserthrough the primary, we set up a vibration in the secondary circuit of afrequency of many hundred thousand or millions per second, if we so desire; andin using either of these means we enter a field as yet unexplored.It is impossible to pursue an investigation in any novel line without finallymaking some interesting observation or learning some useful fact. That thisstatement is applicable to the subject of this lecture the many curious andunexpected phenomena which we observe afford a convincing proof. By way ofillustration, take for instance the most obvious phenomena, those of thedischarge of the induction coil.Here is a coil which is operated by currents vibrating with extreme rapidity,obtained by disruptively discharging a Leyden jar. It would not surprise astudent were the lecturer to say that the secondary of this coil consists of asmall length of comparatively stout wire; it would not surprise him were thelecturer to state that, in spite of this, the coil is capable of giving anypotential which the best insulation of the turns is able to withstand, butalthough he maybe prepared, and even be indifferent as to the anticipatedresult, yet the aspect of the discharge of the coil will surprise and interesthim. Every one is familiar with the discharge of an ordinary coil; it need notbe reproduced here. But, by way of contrast, here is a form of discharge of acoil, the primary current of which is vibrating several hundred thousand timesper second. The discharge of an ordinary coil appears as a simple line or bandof light. The discharge of this coil appears in the form of powerful brushes andluminous streams issuing from all points of the two straight wires attached tothe terminals of the secondary. (Fig. 1.)[../Images/main-27.png]FIG. 1.—DISCHARGE BETWEEN TWO WIRES WITH FREQUENCIES OF A FEW HUNDRED THOUSANDPER SECOND.Now compare this phenomenon which you have just witnessed with the discharge ofa Holtz or Wimshurst machine—that other interesting appliance so dear to theexperimenter. What a difference there is between these phenomena! And yet, had Imade the necessary arrangements—which could have been made easily, were it notthat they would interfere with other experiments—I could have produced with thiscoil sparks which, had I the coil hidden from your view and only two knobsexposed, even the keenest observer among you would find it difficult, if notimpossible, to distinguish from those of an influence or friction machine. Thismay be done in many ways—for instance, by operating the induction coil whichcharges the condenser from an alternating-current machine of very low frequency,and preferably adjusting the discharge circuit so that there are no oscillationsset up in it. \"We then obtain in the secondary circuit, if the knobs are of therequired size and properly set, a more or less rapid succession of sparks ofgreat intensity and small quantity, which possess the same brilliancy, and areaccompanied by the same sharp crackling sound, as those obtained from a frictionor influence machine.Another way is to pass through two primary circuits, having a common secondary,two currents of a slightly different period, which produce in the secondarycircuit sparks occurring at comparatively long intervals. But, even with themeans at hand this evening, I may succeed in imitating the spark of a Holtzmachine. For this purpose I establish between the terminals of the coil whichcharges the condenser a long, unsteady arc, which is periodically interrupted bythe upward current of air produced by it. To increase the current of air I placeon each side of the arc, close to it, a large plate of mica. The condensercharged from this coil discharges into the primary circuit of a second coilthrough a small air gap, which is necessary to produce a sudden rush of currentthrough the primary. The scheme of connections in the present experiment isindicated in Fig. 2.[../Images/main-28.jpg]FIG. 2.—IMITATING THE SPARK OF A-HOLTZ MACHINE.G is an ordinarily constructed alternator, supplying the primary P of aninduction coil, the secondary S of which charges the condensers or jars C C. Theterminals of the secondary are connected to the inside coatings of the jars, theouter coatings being connected to the ends of the primary pp of a secondinduction coil. This primary pp has a small air gap ab.The secondary s of this coil is provided with knobs or spheres K K of the propersize and set at a distance suitable for the experiment.A long arc is established between the terminals A B of the first induction coil.MM are the mica plates.Each time the arc is broken between A and B the jars are quickly charged anddischarged through the primary p p, producing a snapping spark between the knobsK K. Upon the arc forming between A and B the potential falls, and the jarscannot be charged to such high potential as to break through the air gap a buntil the arc is again broken by the draught.In this manner sudden impulses, at long intervals, are produced in the primary pp, which in the secondary s give a corresponding number of impulses of greatintensity. If the secondary knobs or spheres, K K, are of the proper size, thesparks show much resemblance to those of a Holtz machine.But these two effects, which to the eye appear so very different, are only twoof the many discharge phenomena. We only need to change the conditions of thetest, and again we make other observations of interest.When, instead of operating the induction coil as in the last two experiments, weoperate it from a high frequency alternator, as in the next experiment, asystematic study of the phenomena is rendered much more easy. In such case, invarying the strength and frequency of the currents through the primary, we mayobserve five distinct forms of discharge, which I have described in my formerpaper on the subject2 before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, May20, 1891.2 SEE THE ELECTRICAL WORLD, JULY 11, 1891.It would take too much time, and it would lead us too far from the subjectpresented this evening, to reproduce all these forms, but it seems to medesirable to show you one of them. It is a brush discharge, which is interestingin more than one respect. Viewed from a near position it resembles much a jet ofgas escaping under great pressure. We know that the phenomenon is due to theagitation of the molecules near the terminal, and we anticipate that some heatmust be developed by the impact of the molecules against the terminal or againsteach other. Indeed, we find that the brush is hot, and only a little thoughtleads us to the conclusion that, could we but reach sufficiently highfrequencies, we could produce a brush which would give intense light and heat,and which would resemble in every particular an ordinary flame, save, perhaps,that both phenomena might not be due to the same agent—save, perhaps, thatchemical affinity might not be electrical in its nature.As the production of heat and light is here due to the impact of the molecules,or atoms of air, or something else besides, and, as we can augment the energysimply by raising the potential, we might, even with frequencies obtained from adynamo machine, intensify the action to such a degree as to bring the terminalto melting heat. But with such low frequencies we would have to deal always withsomething of the nature of an electric current. If I approach a conductingobject to the brush, a thin little spark passes, yet, even with the frequenciesused this evening, the tendency to spark is not very great. So, for instance, ifI hold a metallic sphere at some distance above the terminal you may see thewhole space between the terminal and sphere illuminated by the streams withoutthe spark passing; and with the much higher frequencies obtainable by thedisruptive discharge of a condenser, were it not for the sudden impulses, whichare comparatively few in number, sparking would not occur even at very smalldistances. However, with incomparably higher frequencies, which we may yet findmeans to produce efficiently, and provided that electric impulses of such highfrequencies could be transmitted through a conductor, the electricalcharacteristics of the brush discharge would completely vanish-no spark wouldpass, no shock would be felt—yet we would still have to deal with an electricphenomenon, but in the broad, modern interpretation of the word. In my firstpaper before referred to I have pointed out the curious properties of the brush,and described the best manner of producing it, but I have thought it worth whileto endeavor to express myself more clearly in regard to this phenomenon, becauseof its absorbing interest.When a coil is operated with currents of very high frequency, beautiful brusheffects may be produced, even if the coil be of comparatively small dimensions.The experimenter may vary them in many ways, and, if it were nothing else, theyafford a pleasing sight. What adds to their interest is that they may beproduced with one single terminal as well as with two—in fact, often better withone than with two.But of all the discharge phenomena observed, the most pleasing to the eye, andthe most instructive, are those observed with a coil which is operated by meansof the disruptive discharge of a condenser. The power of the brushes, theabundance of the sparks, when the conditions' are patiently adjusted, is oftenamazing. With even a very small coil, if it be so well insulated as to stand adifference of potential of several thousand volts per turn, the sparks may be soabundant that the whole coil may appear a complete mass of fire.Curiously enough the sparks, when the terminals of the coil are set at aconsiderable distance, seem to dart in every possible direction as though theterminals were perfectly independent of each other. As the sparks would soondestroy the insulation it is necessary to prevent them. This is best done byimmersing the coil in a good liquid insulator, such as boiled-out oil. Immersionin a liquid may be considered almost an absolute necessity for the continued andsuccessful working of such a coil.It is of course out of the question, in an experimental lecture, with only a fewminutes at disposal for the performance of each experiment, to show thesedischarge phenomena to advantage, as to produce each phenomenon at its best avery careful adjustment is required. But even if imperfectly produced, as theyare likely to be this evening, they are sufficiently striking to interest anintelligent audience.Before showing some of these curious effects I must, for the sake ofcompleteness, give a short description of the coil and other apparatus used inthe experiments with the disruptive discharge this evening.It is contained in a box B (Fig. 3) of thick boards of hard wood, covered on theoutside with zinc sheet Z, which is carefully soldered all around. It might beadvisable, in a strictly scientific investigation, when accuracy is of greatimportance, to do away with the metal cover, as it might introduce many errors,principally on account of its complex action upon the coil, as a condenser ofvery small capacity and as an electrostatic and electromagnetic screen. When thecoil is used for such experiments as are here contemplated, the employment ofthe metal cover offers some practical advantages, but these are not ofsufficient importance to be dwelt upon.The coil should be placed symmetrically to the metal cover, and the spacebetween should, of course, not be too small, certainly not less than, say, fivecentimetres, but much more if possible; especially the two sides of the zincbox, which are at right angles to the axis of the coil, should be sufficientlyremote from the latter, as otherwise they might impair its action and be asource of loss.[../Images/main-29.png]The coil consists of two spools of hard rubber R R, held apart at a distance of10 centimetres by bolts c and nuts n, likewise of hard rubber. Each spoolcomprises a tube T of approximately 8 centimetres inside diameter, and 3millimetres thick, upon which are screwed two flanges F F 24 centimetres square,the space between the flanges being-about 3 centimetres. The secondary, S S, ofthe best gutta percha-covered wire, has 26 layers, 10 turns in each giving foreach half a total of 260 turns. The two halve are wound oppositely and connectedin series, the connection between both being made over the primary. Thisdisposition, besides being convenient, has the advantage that when the coil iswell balanced—that is, when both of its terminals T1 T1 are connected to bodiesor devices of equal capacity—there is not much danger of breaking through to theprimary, and the insulation between the primary and the secondary need not bethick. In using the coil it is advisable to attach to both terminals devices ofnearly equal capacity, as, when the capacity of the terminals is not equal,sparks will be apt to pass to the primary. To avoid this, the middle point ofthe secondary may be connected to the primary, but this is not alwayspracticable.The primary P P is wound in two parts, and oppositely, upon a wooden spool W,and the four ends are led out of the oil through hard rubber tubes t t. The endsof the secondary T1 T1 are also led out of the oil through rubber tubes t1 t1 ofgreat thickness. The primary and secondary layers are insulated by cotton cloth,the thickness of the insulation, of course, bearing some proportion to thedifference of potential between the turns of the different layers. Each half ofthe primary has four layers, 24 turns in each, this giving a total of 96 turns.When both the parts are connected in series, this gives a ratio of conversion ofabout 1:2.7, and with the primaries in multiple, 1:5.4; but in operating withvery rapidly alternating currents this ratio does not convey even an approximateidea of the ratio of the E. M. Fs. in the primary and secondary circuits. Thecoil is held in position in the oil on wooden supports, there being about 5centimetres thickness of oil all round. Where the oil is not specially needed,the space is filled with pieces of wood, and for this purpose principally thewooden box B surrounding the whole is used.The construction here shown is, of course, not the best on general principles,but I believe it is a good and convenient one for the production of effects inwhich an excessive potential and a very small current are needed.In connection with the coil I use either the ordinary form of discharger or amodified form. In the former I have introduced two changes which secure someadvantages, and which are obvious. If they are mentioned, it is only in the hopethat some experimenter may find them of use.[../Images/main-30.jpg]FIG 4. — ARRANGEMENT OF IMPROVED DISCHARGER AND MAGNET.One of the changes is that the adjustable knobs A and B (Fig. 4), of thedischarger are held in jaws of brass, J J, by spring pressure, this allowing ofturning them successively into different positions, and so doing away with thetedious process of frequent polishing up.The other change consists in the employment of a strong electromagnet NS, whichis placed with its axis at right angles to the line joining the knobs A and B,and produces a strong magnetic field between them. The pole pieces of the magnetare movable and properly formed so as to protrude between the brass knobs, inorder to make the field as intense as possible; but to prevent the dischargefrom jumping to the magnet the pole pieces are protected by a layer of mica, MM, of sufficient thickness. s1 s1 and s2 s2 are screws for fastening the wires.On each side one of the screws is for large and the other for small wires. L Lare screws for fixing in position the rods R R, which support the knobs.In another arrangement with the magnet I take the discharge between the roundedpole pieces themselves, which in such case are insulated and preferably providedwith polished brass caps.The employment of an intense magnetic field is of advantage principally when theinduction coil or transformer which charges the condenser is operated bycurrents of very low frequency. In such a case the number of the fundamentaldischarges between the knobs may be so small as to render the currents producedin the secondary unsuitable for many experiments. The intense magnetic fieldthen serves to blow out the arc between the knobs as soon as it is formed, andthe fundamental discharges occur in quicker succession.Instead of the magnet, a draught or blast of air may be employed with someadvantage. In this case the arc is preferably established between the knobs A B,in Fig. 2 (the knobs a b being generally joined, or entirely done away with), asin this disposition the arc is long and unsteady, and is easily affected by thedraught. When a magnet is employed to break the arc, it is better to choose theconnection indicated diagrammatically in Fig. 5 as in this case the currentsforming the arc are much more powerful, and the magnetic field exercises agreater influence. The use of the magnet permits, however, of the arc beingreplaced by a vacuum tube, but I have encountered great difficulties in workingwith an exhausted tube.[../Images/main-31.png]FIG. 5.—ARRANGEMENT WITH LOW-FREQUENCY ALTERNATOR AND IMPROVED DISCHARGER.The other form of discharger used in these and similar experiments is indicatedin Figs. 6 and 7.[../Images/main-32.png]FIG. 6.—DISCHARGER WITH MULTIPLE GAPS.It consists of a number of brass pieces c c (Fig. 6), each of which comprises aspherical middle portion m with an extension e below— which is merely used tofasten the piece in a lathe when polishing up the discharging surface—and acolumn above, which consists of a knurled flange f surmounted by a threaded steml carrying a nut n, by means of which a wire is fastened to the column. Theflange/ conveniently serves for holding the brass piece when fastening the wire,and also for turning it in any position when it becomes necessary to present afresh discharging surface. Two stout strips of hard rubber R R, with planedgrooves g g (Fig- 7) to fit the middle portion of the pieces c c, serve to clampthe latter and hold them firmly in position by means of two bolts C C (of whichonly one is shown) passing through the ends of the strips.[../Images/main-33.png]FIG. 7.—DISCHARGER WITH MULTIPLE GAPS.In the use of this kind of discharger I have found three principal advantagesover the ordinary form. First, the dielectric strength of a given total width ofair space is greater when a great many small air gaps are used instead of one,which permits of working with a smaller length of air gap, and that meanssmaller loss and less deterioration of the metal; secondly by reason ofsplitting the arc up into smaller arcs, the polished surfaces are made to lastmuch longer; and, thirdly, the apparatus affords some gauge in the experiments.I usually set the pieces by-putting between them sheets of uniform thickness ata certain very small distance which is known from the experiments of Sir WilliamThomson to require a certain electromotive force to be bridged by the spark.It should, of course, be remembered that the sparking distance is muchdiminished as the frequency is increased. By taking any number of spaces theexperimenter has a rough idea of the electromotive force, and he finds it easierto repeat an experiment, as he has not the trouble of setting the knobs againand again. With this kind of discharger I have been able to maintain anoscillating motion without any spark being visible with the naked eye betweenthe knobs, and they would not show a very appreciable rise in temperature. Thisform of discharge also lends itself to many arrangements of condensers andcircuits which are often very convenient and time-saving. I have used itpreferably in a disposition similar to that indicated in Fig. 2, when thecurrents forming the arc are small.I may here mention that I have also used dischargers with single or multiple airgaps, in which the discharge surfaces were rotated with great speed. Noparticular advantage was, however, gained by this method, except in cases wherethe currents from the condenser were large and the keeping cool of the surfaceswas necessary, and in cases when, the discharge not being oscillating of itself,the arc as soon as established was broken by the air current, thus starting thevibration at intervals in rapid succession. I have also used mechanicalinterrupters in many ways. To avoid the difficulties with frictional contacts,the preferred plan adopted was to establish the arc and rotate through it atgreat speed a rim of mica provided with many holes and fastened to a steelplate. It is understood, of course, that the employment of a magnet, aircurrent, or other interrupter, produces an effect worth noticing, unless theself-induction, capacity and resistance are so related that there areoscillations set up upon each interruption.I will now endeavor to show you some of the most noteworthy of these dischargephenomena.I have stretched across the room two ordinary cotton covered wires, each about 7metres in length. They are supported on insulating cords at a distance of about30 centimetres. I attach now to each of the terminals of the coil one of thewires and set the coil in action. Upon turning the lights off in the room yousee the wires strongly illuminated by the streams issuing abundantly from theirwhole surface in spite of the cotton covering, which may even be very thick.When the experiment is performed under good conditions, the light from the wiresis sufficiently intense to allow distinguishing the objects in a room. Toproduce the best result it is, of course, necessary to adjust carefully thecapacity of the jars, the arc between the knobs and the length of the wires. Myexperience is that calculation of the length of the wires leads, in such case,to no result whatever. The experimenter will do best to take the wires at thestart very long, and then adjust by cutting off first long pieces, and thensmaller and smaller ones as he approaches the right length.A convenient way is to use an oil condenser of very small capacity, consistingof two small adjustable metal plates, in connection with this and similarexperiments. In such case I take wires rather short and set at the beginning thecondenser plates at maximum distance. If the streams for the wires increase byapproach of the plates, the length of the wires is about right; if they diminishthe wires are too long for that frequency and potential. \"When a condenser isused in connection with experiments with such a coil, it should be an oilcondenser by all means, as in using an air condenser considerable energy mightbe wasted. The wires leading to the plates in the oil should be very thin,heavily coated with some insulating compound, and provided with a conductingcovering—this preferably extending under the surface of the oil. The conductingcover should not be too near the terminals, or ends, of the wire, as a parkwould be apt to jump from the wire to it. The conducting coating is used todiminish the air losses, in virtue of its action as an electrostatic screen. Asto the size of the vessel containing the oil and the size of the plates, theexperimenter gains at once an idea from a rough trial. The size of the plates inoil is, however, calculable, as the dielectric losses are very small.In the preceding experiment it is of considerable interest to know what relationthe quantity of the light emitted bears to the frequency and potential of theelectric impulses. My opinion is that the heat as well as light effects producedshould be proportionate, under otherwise equal conditions of test, to theproduct of frequency and square of potential, but the experimental verificationof the law, whatever it may be, would be exceedingly difficult. One thing iscertain, at any rate, and that is, that in augmenting the potential andfrequency we rapidly intensify the streams; and, though it may be very sanguine,it is surely not altogether hopeless to expect that we may succeed in producinga practical illuminant on these lines. We would then be simply using burners orflames, in which there would be no chemical process, no consumption of material,but merely a transfer of energy, and which would, in all probability emit morelight and less heat than ordinary flames. The luminous intensity of the streamsis, of course, considerably increased when they are focused upon a smallsurface. This may be shown by the following experiment: I attach to one of theterminals of the coil a wire w (Fig. 8), bent in a circle of about 30centimetres in diameter, and to the other terminal I fasten a small brass spheres, the surface of the wire being preferably equal to the surface of the sphere,and the centre of the latter being in a line at right angles to the plane of thewire circle and passing through its centre. When the discharge is establishedunder proper conditions, a luminous hollow cone is formed, and in the darkone-half of the brass sphere is strongly illuminated, as shown in the cut.[../Images/main-34.png]FIG. 8.—EFFECT PRODUCED BY CONCENTRATING STREAMS.By some artifice or other, it is easy to concentrate the streams upon smallsurfaces and to produce very strong light effects. Two thin wires may thus berendered intensely luminous.In order to intensify the streams the wires should be very thin and short; butas in this case their capacity would be generally too small for the coil—atleast, for such a one as the present—it is necessary to augment the capacity tothe required value, while, at the same time, the surface of the wires remainsvery small. This may be done in many ways.Here, for instance, I have two plates, R R, of hard rubber (Fig. 9), upon whichI have glued two very thin wires w w, so as to form a name. The wires may bebare or covered with the best insulation—it is immaterial for the success of theexperiment. Well insulated wires, if anything, are preferable. On the back ofeach plate, indicated by the shaded portion, is a tinfoil coating it.The plates are placed in line at a sufficient distance to prevent a sparkpassing from one to the other wire. The two tinfoil coatings I have joined by aconductor C, and the two wires I presently connect to the terminals of the coil.It is now easy, by varying the strength and frequency of the currents throughthe primary, to find a point at which the capacity of the system is best suitedto the conditions, and the wires become so strongly luminous that, when thelight in the room is turned off the name formed by them appears in brilliantletters.It is perhaps preferable to perform this experiment with a coil operated from analternator of high frequency, as then, owing to the harmonic rise and fall, thestreams are very uniform, though they are less abundant than when produced withsuch a coil as the present. This experiment, however, may be performed with lowfrequencies, but much less satisfactorily.[../Images/main-35.jpg]FIG. 9.—WIRES RENDERED INTENSELY LUMINOUS. FIG. 10.—LUMINOUS DISCS.When two wires, attached to the terminals of the coil, are set at the properdistance, the streams between them may be so intense as to produce a continuousluminous sheet. To show this phenomenon I have here two circles, C and c (Fig.10), of rather stout wire, one being about 80 centimetres and the other 30centimetres in diameter. To each of the terminals of the coil I attach one ofthe circles. The supporting wires are so bent that the circles may be placed inthe same plane, coinciding as nearly as possible. When the light in the room isturned off and the coil set to work, you see the whole space between the wiresuniformly filled with streams, forming a luminous disc, which could be seen froma considerable distance, such is the intensity of the streams. The outer circlecould have been much larger than the present one, in fact, with this coil I haveused much larger circles, and I have been able to produce a strongly luminoussheet, covering an area of more than one square metre, which is a remarkableeffect with this very small coil. To avoid uncertainty, the circle has beentaken smaller, and the area is now about 0.43 square metre.The frequency of the vibration, and the quickness of succession of the sparksbetween the knobs, affect to a marked degree the appearance of the streams. Whenthe frequency is very low, the air gives way in more or less the same manner, asby a steady difference of potential, and the streams consist of distinctthreads, generally mingled with thin sparks, which probably correspond to thesuccessive discharges occurring between the knobs. But when the frequency isextremely high, and the arc of the discharge produces a very loud but smoothsound—showing both that oscillation takes place and that the sparks succeed eachother with great rapidity—then the luminous streams formed are perfectlyuniform. To reach this result very small coils and jars of small capacity shouldbe used. I take two tubes of thick Bohemian glass, about 5 centimetres indiameter and 20 centimetres long. In each of the tubes I slip a primary of verythick copper wire. On the top of each tube I wind a secondary of much thinnergutta-percha covered wire. The two secondaries I connect in series, theprimaries preferably in multiple arc. The tubes are then placed in a large glassvessel, at a distance of 10 to 15 centimetres from each other, on insulatingsupports, and the vessel is filled with boiled-out oil, the oil reaching aboutan inch above the tubes. The free ends of the secondary are lifted out of theoil and placed parallel to each other at a distance of about 10 centimetres. Theends which are scraped should be dipped in the oil. Two four-pint jars joined inseries may be used to discharge through the primary. When the necessaryadjustments in the length and distance of the wires above the oil and in the arcof discharge are made, a luminous sheet is produced between the wires, which isperfectly smooth and textureless, like the ordinary discharge through amoderately exhausted tube.I have purposely dwelt upon this apparently insignificant experiment. In trialsof this kind the experimenter arrives at the startling conclusion that, to passordinary luminous discharges through gases, no particular degree of exhaustionis needed, but that the gas may be at ordinary or even greater pressure. Toaccomplish this, a very high frequency is essential; a high potential islikewise required, but this is a merely incidental necessity. These experimentsteach us that, in endeavoring to discover novel methods of producing light bythe agitation of atoms, or molecules, of a gas, we need not limit our researchto the vacuum tube, but may look forward quite seriously to the possibility ofobtaining the light effects without the use of any vessel whatever, with air atordinary pressure.Such discharges of very high frequency, which render luminous the air atordinary pressures, we have probably often occasion to witness in Nature. I haveno doubt that if, as many believe, the aurora borealis is produced by suddencosmic disturbances, such as eruptions at the sun's surface, which set theelectrostatic charge of the earth in an extremely rapid vibration, the red glowobserved is not confined to the upper rarefied strata of the air, but thedischarge traverses, by reason of its very high frequency, also the denseatmosphere in the form of a glow, such as we ordinarily produce in a slightlyexhausted tube. If the frequency were very low, or even more so, if the chargewere not at all vibrating, the dense air would break down as in a lightningdischarge. Indications of such breaking down of the lower dense strata of theair have been repeatedly observed at the occurrence of this marvelous phenomenon; but if it does occur, it can only be attributed to the fundamentaldisturbances, which are few in number, for the vibration produced by them wouldbe far too rapid to allow a disruptive break. It is the original and irregularimpulses which affect the instruments; the superimposed vibrations probably passunnoticed.\"When an ordinary low frequency discharge is passed through moderately rarefiedair, the air assumes a purplish hue. If by some means or other we increase theintensity of the molecular, or atomic, vibration, the gas changes to a whitecolor. A similar change occurs at ordinary pressures with electric impulses ofvery high frequency. If the molecules of the air around a wire are moderatelyagitated, the brush formed is reddish or violet; if the vibration is renderedsufficiently intense, the streams become white. We may accomplish this invarious ways. In the experiment before shown with the two wires across the room,I have endeavored to secure the result by pushing to a high value both thefrequency and potential; in the experiment with the thin wires glued on therubber plate I have concentrated the action upon a very small surface—in otherwords, I have worked with a great electric density.A most curious form of discharge is observed with such a coil when the frequencyand potential are pushed to the extreme limit. To perform the experiment, everypart of the coil should be heavily insulated, and only two small spheres—or,better still, two sharp-edged metal discs (d d, Fig. 11) of no more than a fewcentimetres in diameter— should be exposed to the air. The coil here used isimmersed in oil, and the ends of the secondary reaching out of the oil arecovered with an air-tight cover of hard rubber of great thickness. All cracks,if there are any, should be carefully stopped up, so that the brush dischargecannot form anywhere except on the small spheres or plates which are exposed tothe air. In this case, since there are no large plates or other bodies ofcapacity attached to the terminals, the coil is capable of an extremely rapidvibration. The potential may be raised by increasing, as far as the experimenterjudges proper, the rate of change of the primary current. With a coil not widelydiffering from the present, it is best to connect the two primaries in multiplearc; but if the secondary should have much greater number of turns the primariesshould preferably be used in series, as otherwise the vibration might be toofast for the secondary. It occurs under these conditions that misty whitestreams break forth from the edges of the discs and spread out phantom-like intospace. With this coil, when fairly well produced, they are about 25 to 30centimetres long. When the hand is held against them no sensation is produced,and a spark, causing a shock, jumps from the terminal only upon the hand beingbrought much nearer. If the oscillation of the primary current is renderedintermittent by some means or other there is a corresponding throbbing of thestreams, and now the hand or other conducting object may be brought in stillgreater proximity to the terminal without a spark being caused to jump.Among the many beautiful phenomena which may be produced with such a coil I havehere selected only those which appear to possess some features of novelty, andlead us to some conclusions of interest. One will not find it at all difficultto produce in the laboratory, by means of it, many other phenomena which appealto the eye even more than these here shown, but present no particular feature ofnovelty.Early experimenters describe the display of sparks produced by an ordinary largeinduction coil upon an insulating plate separating the terminals. Quite recentlySiemens performed some experiments in which fine effects were obtained, whichwere seen by many with interest. No doubt large coils, even if operated withcurrents of low frequencies, are capable of producing beautiful effects. But thelargest coil ever made could not, by far, equal the magnificent display ofstreams and sparks obtained from such a disruptive discharge coil when properlyadjusted. To give an idea, a coil such as the present one will cover easily aplate of 1 metre in diameter completely with the streams. The best way toperform such experiments is to take a very thin rubber or a glass plate and glueon one side of it a narrow ring of tinfoil of very large diameter, and on theother a circular washer, the centre of the latter coinciding with that of thering, and the surfaces of both being preferably equal, so as to keep the coilwell balanced. The washer and ring should be connected to the terminals byheavily insulated thin wires. It is easy in observing the effect of the capacityto produce a sheet of uniform streams, or a fine network of thin silverythreads, or a mass of loud brilliant sparks, which completely cover the plate.[../Images/main-36.png]FIG. 11.—PHANT OM STREAMS.Since I have advanced the idea of the conversion by means of the disruptivedischarge, in my paper before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers atthe beginning of the past year, the interest excited in it has beenconsiderable. It affords us a means for producing any potentials by the aid ofinexpensive coils operated from ordinary systems of distribution, and—what isperhaps more appreciated—it enables us to convert currents of any frequency intocurrents of any other lower or higher frequency. But its chief value willperhaps be found in the help which it will afford us in the investigations ofthe phenomena of phosphorescence, which a disruptive discharge coil is capableof exciting in innumerable cases where ordinary coils, even the largest, wouldutterly fail.Considering its probable uses for many practical purposes, and its possibleintroduction into laboratories for scientific research, a few additional remarksas to the construction of such a coil will perhaps not be found superfluous.It is, of course, absolutely necessary to employ in such a coil wires providedwith the best insulation.Good coils may be produced by employing wires covered with several layers ofcotton, boiling the coil a long time in pure wax, and cooling under moderatepressure. The advantage of such a coil is that it can be easily handled, but itcannot probably give as satisfactory results as a coil immersed in pure oil.Besides, it seems that the presence of a large body of wax affects the coildisadvantageously, whereas this does not seem to be the case with oil. Perhapsit is because the dielectric losses in the liquid are smaller.I have tried at first silk and cotton covered wires with oil immersion, but Ihave been gradually led to use guttapercha covered wires, which proved mostsatisfactory. Gutta-percha insulation adds, of course, to the capacity of thecoil, and this, especially if the coil be large, is a great disadvantage whenextreme frequencies are desired ; but, on the other hand, gutta-percha willwithstand much more than an equal thickness of oil, and this advantage should besecured at any price. Once the coil has been immersed, it should never be takenout of the oil for more than a few hours, else the gutta-percha will crack upand the coil will not be worth half as much as before. Gutta-percha is probablyslowly attacked by the oil, but after an immersion of eight to nine months Ihave found no ill effects.I have obtained in commerce two kinds of gutta-percha wire: in one theinsulation sticks tightly to the metal, in the other it does not. Unless aspecial method is followed to expel all air, it is much safer to use the firstkind. I wind the coil within an oil tank so that all interstices are filled upwith the oil. Between the layers I use cloth boiled out thoroughly in oil,calculating the thickness according to the difference of potential between theturns. There seems not to be a very great difference whatever kind of oil isused; I use paraffine or linseed oil.To exclude more perfectly the air, an excellent way to proceed, and easilypracticable with small coils, is the following : Construct a box of hard wood ofvery thick boards which have been for a long time boiled in oil. The boardsshould be so joined as to safely withstand the external air pressure. The coilbeing placed and fastened in position within the box, the latter is closed witha strong lid, and covered with closely fitting metal sheets, the joints of whichare soldered very carefully. On the top two small holes are drilled, passingthrough the metal sheet ana the wood, and in these holes two small glass tubesare inserted and the joints made air-tight. One of the tubes is connected to avacuum pump, and the other with a vessel containing a sufficient quantity ofboiled-out oil. The latter tube has a very small hole at the bottom, and isprovided with a stopcock. When a fairly good vacuum has been obtained, thestopcock is opened and the oil slowly fed in. Proceeding in this manner, it isimpossible that any big bubbles, which are the principal danger, should remainbetween the turns. The air is most completely excluded, probably better than byboiling out, which, however, when gutta-percha coated wires are used, is notpracticable.For the primaries I use ordinary line wire with a thick cotton coating. Strandsof very thin insulated wires properly interlaced would, of course, be the bestto employ for the primaries, but they are not to be had.In an experimental coil the size of the wires is not of great importance. In thecoil here used the primary is No. 12 and the secondary No. 24 Brown & Sharpegauge wire; but the sections may be varied considerably. It would only implydifferent adjustments ; the results aimed at would not be materially affected.I have dwelt at some length upon the various forms of brush discharge because,in studying them, we not only observe phenomena which please our eye, but alsoafford us food for thought, and lead us to conclusions of practical importance.In the use of alternating currents of very high tension, too much precautioncannot be taken to prevent the brush discharge. In a main conveying suchcurrents, in an induction coil or transformer, or in a condenser, the brushdischarge is a source of great danger to the insulation. In a condenserespecially the gaseous matter must be most carefully expelled, for in it thecharged surfaces are near each other, and if the potentials are high, just assure as a weight will fall if let go, so the insulation will give way if asingle gaseous bubble of some size be present, whereas, if all gaseous matterwere carefully excluded, the condenser would safely withstand a much higherdifference of potential. A main conveying alternating currents of very hightension may be injured merely by a blow hole or small crack in the insulation,the more so as a blowhole is apt to contain gas at low pressure; and as itappears almost impossible to completely obviate such little imperfections, I amled to believe that in our future distribution of electrical energy by currentsof very high tension liquid insulation will be used. The cost is a greatdrawback, but if we employ an oil as an insulator the distribution of electricalenergy with something like 100,000 volts, and even more, become, at least withhigher frequencies, so easy that they could be hardly called engineering feats.With oil insulation and alternate current motor's transmissions of power can beeffected with safety and upon an industrial basis at distances of as much as athousand miles.A peculiar property of oils, and liquid insulation in general, when subjected torapidly changing electric stresses, is to disperse any gaseous bubbles which maybe present, and diffuse them through its mass, generally long before anyinjurious break can occur. This feature may be easily observed with an ordinaryinduction coil by taking the primary out, plugging up the end of the tube uponwhich the secondary is wound, and filling it with some fairly transparentinsulator, such as paraffine oil. A primary of a diameter something like sixmillimetres smaller than the inside of the tube may be inserted in the oil. Whenthe coil is set to work one may see, looking from the top through the oil, manyluminous points—air bubbles which are caught by inserting the primary, and whichare rendered luminous in consequence of the violent bombardment. The occludedair, by its impact against the oil, heats it; the oil begins to circulate,carrying some of the air along with it, until the bubbles are dispersed and theluminous points disappear. In this manner, unless large bubbles are occluded insuch way that circulation is rendered impossible, a damaging break is averted,the only effect being a moderate warming up of the oil. If, instead of theliquid, a solid insulation, no matter how thick, were used, a breaking throughand injury of the apparatus would be inevitable.The exclusion of gaseous matter from any apparatus in which the dielectric issubjected to more or less rapidly changing electric forces is, however, not onlydesirable in order to avoid a possible injury of the apparatus, but also onaccount of economy. In a condenser, for instance, as long as only a solid oronly a liquid dielectric is used, the loss is small; but if a gas under ordinaryor small pressure be present the loss may be very great. Whatever the nature ofthe force acting in the dielectric may be, it seems that in a solid or liquidthe molecular displacement produced by the force is small: hence the product offorce and displacement is insignificant, unless the force be very great; but ina gas the displacement, and therefore this product, is considerable; themolecules are free to move, they reach high speeds, and the energy of theirimpact is lost in heat or otherwise. If the gas be strongly compressed, thedisplacement due to the force is made smaller, and the losses are reduced.In most of the succeeding experiments I prefer, chiefly on account of theregular and positive action, to employ the alternator before referred to. Thisis one of the several machines constructed by me for the purposes of theseinvestigations. It has 384 pole projections, and is capable of giving currentsof a frequency of about 10,000 per second. This machine has been illustrated andbriefly described in my first paper before the American Institute of ElectricalEngineers, May 20,1891, to which I have already referred. A more detaileddescription, sufficient to enable any engineer to build a similar machine, willbe found in several electrical journals of that period. The induction coilsoperated from the machine are rather small, containing from 5,000 to 15,000turns in the secondary. They are immersed in boiled-out linseed oil, containedin wooden boxes covered with zinc sheet.I have found it advantageous to reverse the usual position of the wires, and towind, in these coils, the primaries on the top; this allowing the use of a muchbigger primary, which, of course, reduces the danger of overheating andincreases the output of the coil. I make the primary on each side at least onecentimetre shorter than the secondary, to prevent the breaking through on theends, which would surely occur unless the insulation on the top of the secondarybe very thick, and this, of course, would be disadvantageous.When the primary is made movable, which is necessary in some experiments, andmany times convenient for the purposes of adjustment, I cover the secondary withwax, and turn it off in a lathe to a diameter slightly smaller than the insideof the primary coil. The latter I provide with a handle reaching out of the oil,which serves to shift it in any position along the secondary.I will now venture to make, in regard to the general manipulation of inductioncoils, a few observations bearing upon points which have not been fullyappreciated in earlier experiments with such coils, and are even now oftenoverlooked.The secondary of the coil possesses usually such a high self-induction that thecurrent through the wire is inappreciable, and may be so even when the terminalsare joined by a conductor of small resistance, If capacity is aided to theterminals, the self-induction is counteracted, and a stronger current is made toflow through the secondary, though its terminals are insulated from each other.To one entirely unacquainted with the properties of alternating currents nothingwill look more puzzling. This feature was illustrated in the experimentperformed at the beginning with the top plates of wire gauze attached to theterminals and the rubber plate. When the plates of wire gauze were closetogether, and a small arc passed between them, the arc prevented a strongcurrent from passing through the secondary, because it did away with thecapacity on the terminals; when the rubber plate was inserted between, thecapacity of the condenser formed counteracted the self-induction of thesecondary, a stronger current passed now, the coil performed more work, and thedischarge was by far more powerful.The first thing, then, in operating the induction coil is to combine capacitywith the secondary to overcome the selfinduction. If the frequencies andpotentials are very high gaseous matter should be carefully kept away from thecharged surfaces. If Leyden jars are used, they should be immersed in oil, asotherwise considerable dissipation may occur if the jars are greatly strained.When high frequencies are used, it is of equal importance to combine a condenserwith the primary. One may use a condenser connected to the ends of the primaryor to the terminals of the alternator, but the latter is not to be recommended,as the machine might be injured. The best way is undoubtedly to use thecondenser in series with the primary and with the alternator, and to adjust itscapacity so as to annul the self-induction of both the latter. The condensershould be adjustable by very small steps, and for a finer adjustment a small oilcondenser with movable plates may be used conveniently.I think it best at this juncture to bring before you a phenomenon, observed byme some time ago, which to the purely scientific investigator may perhaps appearmore interesting than any of the results which I have the privilege to presentto you this evening.It may be quite properly ranked among the brush phenomena—in fact, it is abrush, formed at, or near, a single terminal in high vacuum.In bulbs provided with a conducting terminal, though it be of aluminium, thebrush has but an ephemeral existence, and cannot, unfortunately, be indefinitelypreserved in its most sensitive state, even in a bulb devoid of any conductingelectrode. In studying the phenomenon, by all means a bulb having no leading-inwire should be used. I have found it best to use bulbs constructed as indicatedin Figs. 12 and 13.In Fig. 12 the bulb comprises an incandescent lamp globe L, in the neck of whichis sealed a barometer tube &, the end of which is blown out to form a smallsphere s. This sphere should be sealed as closely as possible in the centre ofthe large globe. Before sealing, a thin tube t, of aluminium sheet, may beslipped in the barometer tube, but it is not important to employ it.The small hollow sphere s is filled with some conducting powder, and a wire w iscemented in the neck for the purpose of connecting the conducting powder withthe generator. The construction shown in Fig. 13 was chosen in order to removefrom the brush any conducting body which might possibly affect it. The bulbconsists in this case of a lamp globe L, which has a neck n, provided with atube & and small sphere s, sealed to it, so that two entirely independentcompartments are formed, as indicated in the drawing. When the bulb is in use,the neck n is provided with a tinfoil coating\", which is connected to thegenerator and acts inductively upon the moderately rarefied and highlyconducting gas inclosed in the neck. From there the current passes through thetube b into the small sphere s, to act by induction upon the gas contained inthe globe L.It is of advantage to make the tube t very thick, the hole through it verysmall, and to blow the sphere s very thin. It is of the greatest importance thatthe sphere s be placed in the centre of the globe L.[../Images/main-37.jpg]FIG. 14.—FORMS AND PHASES OF THE ROTATING BRUSH."},{"pageContent":"Figs. 14, 15 and 16 indicate different forms, or stages, of the brush. Fig. 14shows the brush as it first appears in a bulb provided with a conductingterminal; but, as in such a bulb it very soon disappears—often after a fewminutes—I will confine myself to the description of the phenomenon as seen in abulb without conducting electrode. It is observed under the followingconditions:[../Images/main-38.png]THE ENTRANCE TO COLORADO SPRINGS LABORATORY IN THE EARLY PHASE OF DEVELOPMENTTESLA IS LOOKING THROUGH THE DOOR (TESLA’S OWN PHOTOGRAPH NOW AT THE NIKOLATESLA MUSEUM, BELGRADE)When the globe L (Figs. 12 and 13) is exhausted to a very high degree, generallythe bulb is not excited upon connecting the wire w (Fig. 12) or the tinfoilcoating of the bulb (Fig. 13) to the terminal of the induction coil. To exciteit, it is usually sufficient to grasp the globe L with the hand. An intensephosphorescence then spreads at first over the globe, but soon gives place to awhite, misty light. Shortly afterward one may notice that the luminosity isunevenly distributed in the globe, and after passing the current for some timethe bulb appears as in Fig. 15. From this stage the phenomenon will graduallypass to that indicated in Fig. 16, after some minutes, hours, days or weeks,according as the bulb is worked. Warming the bulb or increasing the potentialhastens the transit.[../Images/main-39.png]When the brush assumes the form indicated in Fig. 16, it may be brought to astate of extreme sensitiveness to electrostatic and magnetic influence. The bulbhanging straight down from a wire, and all objects being remote from it, theapproach of the observer at a few paces from the bulb will cause the brush tofly to the opposite side, and if he walks around the bulb it will always keep onthe opposite side. It may begin to spin around the terminal long before itreaches that sensitive stage. When it begins to turn around principally, butalso before, it is affected by a magnet, and at a certain stage it issusceptible to magnetic influence to an astonishing degree. A small permanentmagnet, with its poles at a distance of no more than two centimetres, willaffect it visibly at a distance of two metres, slowing down or accelerating therotation according to how it is held relatively to the brush. I think I haveobserved that at the stage when it is most sensitive to magnetic, it is not mostsensitive to electrostatic, influence. My explanation is, that the electrostaticattraction between the brush and the glass of the bulb, which retards therotation, grows much quicker than the magnetic influence when the intensity ofthe stream is increased.When the bulb hangs with the globe L down, the rotation is always clockwise. Inthe southern hemisphere it would occur in the opposite direction and on theequator, the brush should not turn at all. The rotation may be reversed by amagnet kept at some distance. The brush rotates best, seemingly, when it is atright angles to the lines of force of the earth. It very likely rotates, when atits maximum speed, in synchronism with the alternations, say 10,000 times asecond. The rotation can be slowed down or accelerated by the approach orreceding of the observer, or any conducting body, but it cannot be reversed byputting the bulb in any position. When it is in the state of the highestsensitiveness and the potential or frequency be varied the sensitiveness israpidly diminished. Changing either of these but little will generally stop therotation. The sensitiveness is likewise affected by the variations oftemperature. To attain great sensitiveness it is necessary to have the smallsphere s in the centre of the globe L, as otherwise the electrostatic action ofthe glass of the globe will tend to stop the rotation. The sphere s should besmall and of uniform thickness; any dissymmetry of course has the effect todiminish the sensitiveness.The fact that the brush rotates in a definite direction in a permanent magneticfield seems to show that in alternating currents of very high frequency thepositive and negative impulses are not equal, but that one always preponderatesover the other.Of course, this rotation in one direction may be due to the action of twoelements of the same current upon each other, or to the action of the fieldproduced by one of the elements upon the other, as in a series motor, withoutnecessarily one impulse being stronger than the other. The fact that the brushturns, as far as I could observe, in any position, would speak for this view. Insuch case it would turn at any point of the earth's surface. But, on the otherhand, it is then hard to explain why a permanent magnet should reverse therotation, and one must assume the preponderance of impulses of one kind.As to the causes of the formation of the brush or stream I think it is due tothe electrostatic action of the globe and the dissymmetry of the parts. If thesmall bulb s and the globe L were perfect concentric spheres, and the glassthroughout of the same thickness and quality, I think the brush would not form,as the tendency to pass would be equal on all sides. That the formation of thestream is due to an irregularity is apparent from the fact that it has thetendency to remain in one position, and rotation occurs most generally only whenit is brought out of this position by electrostatic or magnetic influence. Whenin an extremely sensitive state it rests in one position, most curiousexperiments may be performed with it. For instance, the experimenter may, byselecting a proper position, approach the hand at a certain considerabledistance to the bulb, and he may cause the brush to pass off by merelystiffening the muscles of the arm. When it begins to rotate slowly, and thehands are held at a proper distance, it is impossible to make even the slightestmotion without producing a visible effect upon the brush. A metal plateconnected to the other terminal of the coil affects it at a great distance,slowing down the rotation often to one turn a second.I am firmly convinced that such a brush, when we learn how to produce itproperly, will prove a valuable aid in the investigation of the nature of theforces acting in an electrostatic or magnetic field. If there is any motionwhich is measurable going on in the space, such a brush ought to reveal it. Itis, so to speak, a beam of light, frictionless, devoid of inertia.I think that it may find practical applications in telegraphy. With such a brushit would be possible to send dispatches across the Atlantic, for instance, withany speed, since its sensitiveness may be so great that the slightest changeswill affect it. If it were possible to make the stream more intense and verynarrow, its deflections could be easily photographed.I have been interested to find whether there is a rotation of the stream itself,or whether there is simply a stress traveling around in the bulb. For thispurpose I mounted a light mica fan so that its vanes were in the path of thebrush. If the stream itself was rotating the fan would be spun around. I couldproduce no distinct rotation of the fan, although I tried the experimentrepeatedly; but as the fan exerted a noticeable influence on the stream, and theapparent rotation of the latter was, in this case, never quite satisfactory, theexperiment did not appear to be conclusive.I have been unable to produce the phenomenon with the disruptive discharge coil,although every other of these phenomena can be well produced by it—many, infact, much better than with coils operated from an alternator. It may bepossible to produce the brush by impulses of one direction, or even by a steadypotential, in which case it would be still more sensitive to magnetic influence.In operating an induction coil with rapidly alternating currents, we realizewith astonishment, for the first time, the great importance of the relation ofcapacity, self-induction and frequency as regards the general result. Theeffects of capacity are the most striking, for in these experiments, since theself-induction and frequency both are high, the critical capacity is very small,and need be but slightly varied to produce a very considerable change. Theexperimenter may bring his body in contact with the terminals of the secondaryof the coil, or attach to one or both terminals insulated bodies of very smallbulk, such as bulbs, and he may produce a considerable rise or fall ofpotential, and greatly affect the flow of the current through the primary. Inthe experiment before shown, in which a brush appears at a wire attached to oneterminal, and the wire is vibrated when the experimenter brings his insulatedbody in contact with the other terminal of the coil, the sudden rise ofpotential was made evident.I may show you the behavior of the coil in another manner which possesses afeature of some interest. I have here a little light fan of aluminium sheet,fastened to a needle and arranged to rotate freely in a metal piece screwed toone of the terminals of the coil. When the coil is set to work, the molecules ofthe air are rhythmically attracted and repelled. As the force with which theyare repelled is greater than that with which they are attracted, it results thatthere is a repulsion exerted on the surfaces of the fan. If the fan were madesimply of a metal sheet, the repulsion would be equal on the opposite sides, andwould produce no effect. But if one of the opposing surfaces is screened, or if,generally speaking, the bombardment on this side is weakened in some way orother, there remains the repulsion exerted upon the other, and the fan is set inrotation. The screening is best effected by fastening upon one of the opposingsides of the fan insulated conducting coatings, or, if the fan is made in theshape of an ordinary propeller screw, by fastening on one side, and close to it,an insulated metal plate. The static screen may, however, be omitted, and simplya thickness of insulating material fastened to one of the sides of the fan.To show the behavior of the coil, the fan may be placed upon the terminal and itwill readily rotate when the coil is operated by currents of very highfrequency. With a steady potential, of course, and even with alternatingcurrents of very low frequency, it would not turn, because of the very slowexchange of air and, consequently, smaller bombardment; but in the latter caseit might turn if the potential were excessive. With a pin wheel, quite theopposite rule holds good ; it rotates best with a steady potential, and theeffort is the smaller the higher the frequency. Now, it is very easy to adjustthe conditions so that the potential is normally not sufficient to turn the fan,but that by connecting the other terminal of the coil with an insulated body itrises to a much greater value, so as to rotate the fan, and it is likewisepossible to stop the rotation by connecting to the terminal a body of differentsize, thereby diminishing the potential.Instead of using the fan in this experiment, we may use the \"electric\"radiometer with similar effect. But in this case it will be found that the vaneswill rotate only at high exhaustion or at ordinary pressures; they will notrotate at moderate pressures, when the air is highly conducting.This curious observation was made conjointly by Professor Crookes and myself. Iattribute the result to the high conductivity of the air, the molecules of whichthen do not act as independent carriers of electric charges, but act alltogether as a single conducting body. In such case, of course, if there is anyrepulsion at all of the molecules from the vanes, it must be very small. It ispossible, however, that the result is in part due to the fact that the greaterpart of the discharge passes from the leading-in wire through the highlyconducting gas, instead of passing off from the conducting vanes.In trying the preceding experiment with the electric radiometer the potentialshould not exceed a certain limit, as then the electrostatic attraction betweenthe vanes and the glass of the bulb may be so great as to stop the rotation.A most curious feature of alternate currents of high frequencies and potentialsis that they enable us to perform many experiments by the use of one wire only.In many respects this feature is of great interest.In a type of alternate current motor invented by me some years ago I producedrotation by inducing, by means of a single alternating current passed through amotor circuit, in the mass or other circuits of the motor, secondary currents,which, jointly with the primary or inducing current, created a moving field offorce. A simple but crude form of such a motor is obtained by winding upon aniron core a primary, and close to it a secondary coil, joining the ends of thelatter and placing a freely movable metal disc within the influence of the fieldproduced by both. The iron core is employed for obvious reasons, but it is notessential to the operation. To improve the motor, the iron core is made toencircle the armature. Again to improve, the secondary coil is made to overlappartly the primary, so that it cannot free itself from a strong inductive actionof the latter, repel its lines as it may. Once more to improve, the properdifference of phase is obtained between the primary and secondary currents by acondenser, selfinduction, resistance or equivalent windings.I had discovered, however, that rotation is produced by means of a single coiland core; my explanation of the phenomenon, and leading thought in trying theexperiment, being that there must be a true time lag in the magnetization of thecore. I remember the pleasure I had when, in the writings of Professor Ayrton,which came later to my hand, I found the idea of the time lag advocated. Whetherthere is a true time lag, or whether the retardation is due to eddy currentscirculating in minute paths, must remain an open question, but the fact is thata coil wound upon an iron core and traversed by an alternating current creates amoving field of force, capable of setting an armature in rotation. It is of someinterest, in conjunction with the historical Arago experiment, to mention thatin lag or phase motors I have produced rotation in the opposite direction to themoving field, which means that in that experiment the magnet may not rotate, ormay even rotate in the opposite direction to the moving disc. Here, then, is amotor (diagrammatically illustrated in Fig. 17), comprising a coil and ironcore, and a freely movable copper disc in proximity to the latter motor andgenerator being insulated in space. To produce rotation it is generally (but notabsolutely) necessary to connect the free end of the motor coil to an insulatedbody of some size. The experimenter's body is more than sufficient. If hetouches the free terminal with an object held in the hand, a current passesthrough the coil and the copper disc is set in rotation. If an exhausted tube isput in series with the coil, the tube lights brilliantly, showing the passage ofa strong current. Instead of the experimenter's body, a small metal sheetsuspended on a cord may be used with the same result. In this case the plateacts as a condenser in series with the coil. It counteracts the self-inductionof the latter and allows a strong current to pass. In such a combination, thegreater the self-induction of the coil the smaller need be the plate, and thismeans that a lower frequency, or eventually a lower potential, is required tooperate the motor. A single coil wound upon a core has a high selfinduction; forthis reason principally, this type of motor was chosen to perform theexperiment. Were a secondary closed coil wound upon the core, it would tend todiminish the self-induction, and then it would be necessary to employ a muchhigher frequency and potential. Neither would be advisable, for a higherpotential would endanger the insulation of the small primary coil, and a higherfrequency would result in a materially diminished torque.It should be remarked that when such a motor with a closed secondary is used, itis not at all easy to obtain rotation with excessive frequencies, as thesecondary cuts off almost completely the lines of the primary—and this, ofcourse, the more, the higher the frequency—and allows the passage of but aminute current. In such a case, unless the secondary is closed through acondenser, it is almost essential, in order to produce rotation, to make theprimary and secondary coils overlap each other more or less.But there is an additional feature of interest about this motor, namely, it is,not necessary to have even a single connection between the motor and generator,except, perhaps, through the ground; for not only is an insulated plate capableof giving off energy into space, but it is likewise capable of deriving it froman alternating electrostatic field, though in the latter case the availableenergy is much smaller. In this instance one of the motor terminals is connectedto the insulated plate or body located within the alternating electrostaticfield, and the other terminal preferably to the ground.To demonstrate a novel and interesting feature, I have, for a reason which Iwill explain, selected this type of motor. \"When the ends of the coil areconnected to the terminals of an alternator the disc is set in rotation. But itis not this experiment, now well known, which I desire to perform.[../Images/main-40.png]What I wish to show you is that this motor rotates with one single connectionbetween it and the generator; that is to say, one terminal of the motor isconnected to one terminal of the generator—in this case the secondary of ahigh-tension induction coil It is quite possible, however, that such \"no-wire\"motors, as they might be called, could be operated by conduction through therarefied air at considerable distances. Alternate currents, especially of highfrequencies, pass with astonishing freedom through even slightly rarefied gases.The upper strata of the air are rarefied. To reach a number of miles out intospace requires the overcoming of difficulties of a merely mechanical nature.There is no doubt that with the enormous potentials obtainable by the use ofhigh frequencies and oil insulation luminous discharges might be passed throughmany miles of rarefied air, and that, by thus directing the energy of manyhundreds or thousands of horse-power, motors or lamps might be operated atconsiderable distances from stationary sources. But such schemes are mentionedmerely as possibilities. We shall have no need to transmit power in tins way. Weshall have no need to transmit power at all. Ere many generations pass, ourmachinery will be driven by a power obtainable at any point of the universe.This idea is not novel. Men have been led to it long ago by instinct or reason.It has been expressed in many ways, and in many places, in the history of oldand new. We find it in the delightful myth of Antheus, who derives power fromthe earth; we find it among the subtle speculations of one of your splendidmathematicians, and in many hints and statements of thinkers of the presenttime. Throughout space there is energy. Is this energy static or kinetic? Ifstatic our hopes are in vain; if kinetic--and this we know it is, forcertain—then it is a mere question of time when men will succeed in attachingtheir machinery to the very wheelwork of nature. Of all, living or dead, Crookescame nearest to doing it. His radiometer will turn in the light of day and inthe darkness of the night; it will turn everywhere where there is heat, and heatis everywhere. But, unfortunately, this beautiful little machine, while it goesdown to posterity as the most interesting, must likewise be put on record as themost inefficient machine ever invented!The preceding experiment is only one of many equally interesting experimentswhich may be performed by the use of only one wire with alternate currents ofhigh potential and frequency. We may connect an insulated line to a source ofsuch currents, we may pass an inappreciable current over the line, and on anypoint of the same we are able to obtain a heavy current, capable of fusing athick copper wire. Or we may, by the help of some artifice, decompose a solutionin any electrolytic cell by connecting only one pole of the cell to the line orsource of energy. Or we may, by attaching to the line, or only bringing into itsvicinity, light up an incandescent lamp, an exhausted tube, or a phosphorescentbulb.However impracticable this plan of working may appear in many cases, itcertainly seems practicable, and even recommendable, in the production of light.A perfected lamp would require but little energy, and if wires were used at allwe ought to be able to supply that energy without a return wire.It is now a fact that a body may be rendered incandescent or phosphorescent bybringing it either in single contact or merely in the vicinity of a source ofelectric impulses of the proper character, and that m this manner a quantity oflight sufficient to afford a practical illuminant may be produced. It is,therefore, to say the least, worth while to attempt to determine the bestconditions and to invent the best appliances for attaining this object.Some experiences have already been gained in this direction, and I will dwell onthem briefly, in the hope that they might prove useful.The heating of a conducting body inclosed in a bulb, and connected to a sourceof rapidly alternating electric impulses, is dependent on so many things of adifferent nature, that it would be difficult to give a generally applicable ruleunder which the maximum heating occurs. As regards the size of the vessel, Ihave lately found that at ordinary or only slightly differing atmosphericpressures, when air is a good insulator, and hence practically the same amountof energy by a certain potential and frequency is given off from the body,whether the bulb be small or large, the body is brought to a higher temperatureif inclosed in a small bulb, because of the better confinement of heat in thiscase.At lower pressures, when air becomes more or less conducting, or if the air besufficiently warmed as to become conducting, the body is rendered more intenselyincandescent in a large bulb, obviously because, under otherwise equalconditions of test, more energy may be given off from the body when the bulb islarge.At very high degrees of exhaustion, when the matter in the bulb becomes\"radiant,\" a large bulb has still an advantage, but a comparatively slight one,over the small bulb.Finally, at excessively high degrees of exhaustion, which cannot be reachedexcept by the employment of special means, there seems to be, beyond a certainand rather small size of vessel, no perceptible difference in the heating.These observations were the result of a number of experiments, of which one,showing the effect of the size of the bulb at a high degree of exhaustion, maybe described and shown here, as it presents a feature of interest. Threespherical bulbs of 2 inches, 3 inches and 4 inches diameter were taken, and inthe centre of each was mounted an equal length of an ordinary incandescent lampfilament of uniform thickness. In each bulb the piece of filament was fastenedto the leading-in wire of platinum, contained in a glass stem sealed in thebulb; care being taken, of course, to make everything as nearly alike aspossible. On each glass stem in the inside of the bulb was slipped a highlypolished tube made of aluminium sheet, which fitted the stem and was held on itby spring pressure. The function of this aluminium tube will be explainedsubsequently. In each bulb an equal length of filament protruded above the metaltube. It is sufficient to say now that under these conditions equal lengths offilament of the same thickness—in other words, bodies of equal bulk—were broughtto incandescence. The three bulbs were sealed to a glass tube, which wasconnected to a Sprengel pump. When a high vacuum had been reached, the glasstube carrying the bulbs was sealed off. A current was then turned onsuccessively on each bulb, and it was found that the filaments came to about thesame brightness, and, if anything, the smallest bulb, which was placed midwaybetween the two larger ones, may have been slightly brighter. This result wasexpected, for when either of the bulbs was connected to the coil the luminosityspread through the other two, hence the three bulbs constituted really onevessel. When all the three bulbs were connected in multiple arc to the coil, inthe largest of them the filament glowed brightest, in the next smaller it was alittle less bright, and in the smallest it only came to redness. The bulbs werethen sealed off and separately tried. The brightness of the filaments was nowsuch as would have been expected on the supposition that the energy given offwas proportionate to the surface of the bulb, this surface in each caserepresenting one of the coatings of a condenser. Accordingly, there was lessdifference between the largest and the middle sized than between the latter andthe smallest bulb.An interesting observation was made in this experiment. The three bulbs weresuspended from a straight bare wire connected to a terminal of the coil, thelargest bulb being placed at the end of the wire, at some distance from it thesmallest bulb, and an equal distance from the latter the middle-sized one. Thecarbons glowed then in both the larger bulbs about as expected, but the smallestdid not get its share by far. This observation led me to exchange the positionof the bulbs, and I then observed that whichever of the bulbs was in the middleit was by far less bright than it was in any other position. This mystifyingresult was, of course, found to be due to the electrostatic action between thebulbs. When they were placed at a considerable distance, or when they wereattached to the corners of an equilateral triangle of copper wire, they glowedabout in the order determined by their surfaces.As to the shape of the vessel, it is also of some importance, especially at highdegrees of exhaustion. Of all the possible constructions, it seems that aspherical globe with the refractory body mounted in its centre is the best toemploy. In experience it has been demonstrated that in such a globe a refractorybody of a given bulk is more easily brought to incandescence than when otherwiseshaped bulbs are used. There is also an advantage in giving to the incandescentbody the shape of a sphere, for self-evident reasons. In any case the bodyshould be mounted in the centre, where the atoms rebounding from the glasscollide.This object is best attained in the spherical bulb; but it is also attained in acylindrical vessel with one or two straight filaments coinciding with its axis,and possibly also in parabolical or spherical bulbs with the refractory body orbodies placed in the focus or foci of the same; though the latter is notprobable, as the electrified atoms should in all cases rebound normally from thesurface they strike, unless the speed were excessive, in which case they wouldprobably follow the general law of reflection. No matter what shape the vesselmay have, if the exhaustion be low, a filament mounted in the globe is broughtto the same degree of incandescence in all parts; but if the exhaustion be highand the bulb be spherical or pear-shaped, as usual, focal points form and thefilament is heated to a higher degree at or near such points.To illustrate the effect, I have here two small bulbs which are alike, only oneis exhausted to a low and the other to a very high degree. When connected to thecoil, the filament in the former glows uniformly throughout all its length;whereas in the latter, that portion of the filament which is in the centre ofthe bulb glows far more intensely than the rest. A curious point is that thephenomenon occurs even if two filaments are mounted in a bulb, each beingconnected to one terminal of the coil, and, what is still more curious, if theybe very near together, provided the vacuum be very high. I noted in experimentswith such bulbs that the filaments would give way usually at a certain point,and in the first trials I attributed it to a defect in the carbon. But when thephenomenon occurred many times in succession I recognized its real cause.In order to bring a refractory body inclosed in a bulb to incandescence, it isdesirable, on account of economy, that all the energy supplied to the bulb fromthe source should reach without loss the body to be heated; from there, and fromnowhere else, it should be radiated. It is, of course, out of the question toreach this theoretical result, but it is possible by a proper construction ofthe illuminating device to approximate it more or less.For many reasons, the refractory body is placed in the centre of the bulb, andit is usually supported on a glass stem containing the leading-in wire. As thepotential of this wire is alternated, the rarefied gas surrounding the stem isacted upon inductively, and the glass stem is violently bombarded and heated. Inthis manner by far the greater portion of the energy supplied to thebulb—especially when exceedingly high frequencies are used—may be lost for thepurpose contemplated. To obviate this loss, or at least to reduce it to aminimum, I usually screen the rarefied gas surrounding the stem from theinductive action of the leading-in wire by providing the stem with a tube orcoating of conducting material. It seems beyond doubt that the best among metalsto employ for this purpose is aluminium, on account of its many remarkableproperties. Its only fault is that it is easily fusible, and, therefore, itsdistance from the incandescing body should be properly estimated. Usually, athin tube, of a diameter somewhat smaller than that of the glass stem, is madeof the finest aluminium sheet, and slipped on the stem. The tube is convenientlyprepared by wrapping around a rod fastened in a lathe a piece of aluminium sheetof the proper size, grasping the sheet firmly with clean, chamois leather orblotting paper, and spinning the rod very fast. The sheet is wound tightlyaround the rod, and a highly polished tube of one or three layers of the sheetis obtained. When slipped on the stem, the pressure is generally sufficient toprevent it from slipping off, but, for safety, the lower edge of the sheet maybe turned inside. The upper inside corner of the sheet—that is, the one which isnearest to the refractory incandescent body —should be cut out diagonally, as itoften happens that, in consequence of the intense heat, this corner turns towardthe inside and comes very near to, or in contact with, the wire, or filament,supporting the refractory body. The greater part of the energy supplied to thebulb is then used up in heating the metal tube, and the bulb is rendered uselessfor the purpose. The aluminium sheet should project above the glass stem more orless—one inch or so—or else, if the glass be too close to the incandescing body,it may be strongly heated and become more or less conducting, whereupon it maybe ruptured, or may, bv its conductivity, establish a good electrical connectionbetween the metal tube and the leading-in wire, in which case, again, most ofthe energy will be lost in heating the former. Perhaps the best way is to makethe top of the glass tube. for about an inch, of a much smaller diameter. Tostill further reduce the danger arising from the heating of the , glass stem,and also with the view of preventing an electric- ; al connection between themetal tube and the electrode, T preferably wrap the stem with several layers ofthin mica, which extends at least as far as the metal tube. In some bulbs I havealso used an outside insulating cover.The preceding remarks are only made to aid the experimenter in the first trials,for the difficulties which he encounters he may soon find means to overcome inhis own way.To illustrate the effect of the screen, and the advantage of using it, I havehere two bulbs of the same size, with their stems, leading-in wires andincandescent lamp filaments tied to the latter, as nearly alike as possible. Thestem of one bulb is provided with an aluminium tube, the stem of the other hasnone. Originally the two bulbs were joined by a tube which was connected to aSprengel pump. When a high vacuum had been reached, first the connecting tube,and then the bulbs, were sealed off; they are therefore of the same degree ofexhaustion. When they are separately connected to the coil giving a certainpotential, the carbon filament in the bulb provided with the aluminium screen isrendered highly incandescent, while the filament in the other bulb may, with thesame potential, not even come to redness, although in reality the latter bulbtakes generally more energy than the former. When they are both connectedtogether to the terminal, the difference is even more apparent, showing theimportance of the screening. The metal tube placed on the stem containing theleading-in wire performs really two distinct functions: First; it acts more orless as an electrostatic screen, thus economizing the energy supplied to thebulb; and, second, to whatever extent it may fail to act electrostatically, itacts mechanically, preventing the bombardment, and consequently intense heatingand possible deterioration of the slender support of the refractory incandescentbody, or of the glass stem containing the leading-in wire. I say slendersupport, for it is evident that in order to confine the heat more completely tothe incandescing body its support should be very thin, so as to carry away thesmallest possible amount of heat by conduction. Of all the supports used I havefound an ordinary incandescent lamp filament to be the best, principally becauseamong conductors it can withstand the highest degrees of heat.The effectiveness of the metal tube as an electrostatic screen depends largelyon the degree of exhaustion.At excessively high degrees of exhaustion—which are reached by using great careand special means in connection with the Sprengel pump—when the matter in theglobe is in the ultra-radiant state, it acts most perfectly. The shadow of theupper edge of the tube is then sharply defined upon the bulb.At a somewhat lower degree of exhaustion, which is about the ordinary\"non-striking\" vacuum, and generally as long as the matter moves predominantlyin straight lines, the screen still does well. In elucidation of the precedingremark it is necessary to state that what is a \"non-striking\" vacuum for a coiloperated, as ordinarily, by impulses, or currents, of low frequency, is not, byfar, so when the coil is operated by currents of very high frequency. In suchcase the discharge may pass with great freedom through the rarefied gas throughwhich a low-frequency discharge may not pass, even though the potential be muchhigher. At ordinary atmospheric pressures just the reverse rule holds good: thehigher the frequency, the less the spark discharge is able to jump between theterminals, especially if they are knobs or spheres of some size.Finally, at very low degrees of exhaustion, when the gas is well conducting, themetal tube not only does not act as an electrostatic screen, but even is adrawback, aiding to a considerable extent the dissipation of the energylaterally from the leading-in wire. This, of course, is to be expected. In thiscase, namely, the metal tube is in good electrical connection with theleading-in wire, and most of the bombardment is directed upon the tube. As longas the electrical connection is not good, the conducting tube is always of someadvantage, for although it may not greatly economize energy, still it protectsthe support of the refractory button, and is a means for concentrating moreenergy upon the same.To whatever extent the aluminium tube performs the function of a screen, itsusefulness is therefore limited to very high degrees of exhaustion when it isinsulated from the electrode—that is, when the gas as a whole is nonconducting.-and the molecules, or atoms, act as independent carriers of electric charges.In addition to acting as a more or less effective screen, in the true meaning ofthe word, the conducting tube or coating may also act, by reason of itsconductivity, as a sort of equalizer or dampener of the bombardment against thestem. To be explicit, I assume the action as follows: Suppose a rhythmicalbombardment to occur against the conducting tube by reason of its imperfectaction as a screen, it certainly must happen that some molecules, or atoms,strike the tube sooner than others. Those which come first in contact with itgive up their superfluous charge and the tube is electrified, theelectrification instantly spreading over its surface. But this must diminish theenergy lost in the bombardment for two reasons: first, the charge given up bythe atoms spreads over a great area, and hence the electric density at any pointis small, and the atoms are repelled with less energy than they would be if theywould strike against a good insulator; secondly, as the tube is electrified bythe atoms which first come in contact with it, the progress of the followingatoms against the tube is more or less checked by the repulsion which theelectrified tube must exert upon the similarly electrified atoms. This repulsionmay perhaps be sufficient to prevent a large portion of the atoms from strikingthe tube, but at any rate it must diminish the energy of their impact. It isclear that when the exhaustion is very low, and the rarefied gas wellconducting, neither of the above effects can occur, and, on the other hand, thefewer the atoms, with the greater freedom they move; in other words, the higherthe degree of exhaustion, up to a limit, the more telling will be both theeffects.What I have just said may afford an explanation of the phenomenon observed byProf. Crookes, namely, that a discharge through a bulb is established with muchgreater facility when an insulator than when a conductor is present in the same.In my opinion, the conductor acts as a dampener of the motion of the atoms inthe two ways pointed out; hence, to cause a visible discharge to pass throughthe bulb, a much higher potential is needed if a conductor, especially of muchsurface, be present. For the sake of clearness of some of the remarks beforemade, I must now refer to Figs. 18, 19 and 20, which illustrate variousarrangements with a type of bulb most generally used.[../Images/main-41.png]FIG. 18 - BULB WITH MICA TUBE AND ALUMINIUM SCREEN[../Images/main-42.png]FIG. 19 - IMPROVED BULBWITH SOCKET AND SCREENFig. 18 is a section through a spherical bulb L, with the glass stem s,containing the leading-in wire v, which has a lamp filament l fastened to it,serving to support the refractory button m in the centre. If is a sheet of thinmica wound in several layers around the stem s, and a is the aluminium tube.Fig. 19 illustrates such a bulb in a somewhat more advanced stage of perfection.A metallic tube S is fastened by means of some cement to the neck of the tube.In the tube is screwed a plug P, of insulating material, in the centre of whichis fastened a metallic terminal t, for the connection to the leading-in wire w.This terminal must be well insulated from the metal tube S, therefore, if thecement used is conducting— and most generally it is sufficiently so—the spacebetween the plug P and the neck of the bulb should be filled with some goodinsulating material, as mica powder.[../Images/main-43.jpg]FIG. 20 - BULB FOR EXPERIMENTS WITH CONDUCTING TUBEFig. 20 shows a bulb made for experimental purposes. In this bulb the aluminiumtube is provided with an external connection, which serves to investigate theeffect of the tube under various conditions. It is referred to chiefly tosuggest a line of experiment followed.Since the bombardment against the stem containing the leading-in wire is due tothe inductive action of the latter upon the rarefied gas, it is of advantage toreduce this action as far as practicable by employing a very thin wire,surrounded by a very thick insulation of glass or other material, and by makingthe wire passing through the rarefied gas as short as practicable. To combinethese features I employ a large tube T (Fig. 21), which protrudes into the bulbto some distance, and carries on the top a very short glass stem s, into whichis sealed the leading-in wire w, and I protect the top of the glass stem againstthe heat by a small, aluminium tube a and a layer of mica underneath the same,as usual. The wire w, passing through the large tube to the outside of the bulb,should be well insulated— with a glass tube, for instance—and the space betweenought to be filled out with some excellent insulator. Among many insulatingpowders I have tried, I have found that mica powder is the best to employ. Ifthis precaution is not taken, the tube T, protruding into the bulb, will surelybe cracked in consequence of the heating by the brushes which are apt to form inthe upper part of the tube, near the exhausted globe, especially if the vacuumbe excellent, and therefore the potential necessary to operate the lamp veryhigh.[../Images/main-44.jpg]FIG. 21 - IMPROVED BULB WITH NONCONDUCTING BUTTON[../Images/main-45.jpg]FIG. 22 - TYPE OF BULB WITHOUT LEADING-IN WIREFig. 22 illustrates a similar arrangement, with a large tube T protruding intothe part of the bulb containing the refractory button m. In this case the wireleading from the outside into the bulb is omitted, the energy required beingsupplied through condenser coatings C C The insulating packing P should in thisconstruction be tightly fitting to the glass, and rather wide, or otherwise thedischarge Bright avoid passing through the wire w, which connects the insidecondenser coating to the incandescent button m, The molecular bombardmentagainst the glass stem in the bulb is a source of great trouble. As illustrationI will cite a phenomenon only too frequently and unwillingly observed. A bulb,preferably a large one, may be taken, and a good conducting body, such as apiece of carbon, may be mounted in it upon a platinum wire sealed in the glassstem. The bulb may be exhausted to a fairly high degree, nearly to the pointwhen phosphorescence begins to appear.When the bulb is connected with the coil, the piece of carbon, if small, maybecome highly incandescent at first, but its brightness immediately diminishes,and then the discharge may break through the glass somewhere in the middle ofthe stem, in the form of bright sparks, in spite of the fact that the platinumwire is in good electrical connection with the rarefied gas through the piece ofcarbon or metal at the top. The first sparks are singularly bright, recallingthose drawn from a clear surface of mercury. But, as they heat the glassrapidly, they, of course, lose their brightness, and cease when the glass at theruptured place becomes incandescent, or generally sufficiently hot to conduct.When observed for the first time the phenomenon must appear very curious, andshows in a striking manner how radically different alternate currents, orimpulses, of high frequency behave, as compared with steady currents, orcurrents of low frequency. With such currents—namely, the latter—the phenomenonwould of course not occur. When frequencies such as are obtained by mechanicalmeans are used, I think that the rupture of the glass is more or less theconsequence of the bombardment, which warms it up and impairs its insulatingpower; but with frequencies obtainable with condensers I have no doubt that theglass may give way without previous heating. Although this appears most singularat first, it is in reality what we might expect to occur. The energy supplied tothe wire leading into the bulb is given off partly by direct action through thecarbon button, and partly by inductive action through the glass surrounding thewire. The case is thus analogous to that in which a condenser shunted by aconductor of low resistance is connected to a source of alternating currents. Aslong as the frequencies are low the conductor gets the most, and the condenseris perfectly safe; but when the frequency becomes excessive, the role of theconductor may become quite insignificant. In the latter case the difference ofpotential at the terminals of the condenser may become so great as to rupturethe dielectric, notwithstanding the fact that the terminals are joined by aconductor of low resistance.It is, of course, not necessary, when it is desired to produce the incandescenceof a body inclosed in a bulb by means of these currents, that the body should bea conductor, for even a perfect non-conductor may be quite as readily heated.For this purpose it is sufficient to surround a conducting electrode with anon-conducting material, as, for instance, in the bulb described before in Fig.21, in which a thin incandescent lamp filament is coated with a non-conductor,and supports a button of the same material on the top. At the start thebombardment goes on by inductive action through the non-conductor, until thesame is sufficiently heated to become conducting, when the bombardment continuesin the ordinary way.[../Images/main-46.png]FIG. 23.-EFFECT PRODUCED BY A RUBY DROP.A different arrangement used in some of the bulbs constructed is illustrated inFig. 23. In this instance a non-conductor m is mounted in a piece of common arclight carbon so as to project some small distance above the latter. The carbonpiece is connected to the leading-in wire passing through a glass stem, which iswrapped with several layers of mica. An aluminium tube a is employed as usualfor screening. It is so arranged that it reaches very nearly as high as thecarbon and only the non-conductor m projects a little above it. The bombardmentgoes at first against the upper surface of carbon, the lower parts beingprotected by the aluminium tube. As soon, however, as the nonconductor m isheated it is rendered good conducting, and then it becomes the centre of thebombardment, being most exposed to the same.I have also constructed during these experiments many such single-wire bulbswith or without internal electrode, in which the radiant matter was projectedagainst, or focused upon, the body to be rendered incandescent. Fig. 24illustrates one of the bulbs used. It consists of a spherical globe L, providedwith a long neck n, on the top, for increasing the action in some cases by theapplication of an external conducting coating. The globe L is blown out on thebottom into a very small bulb b, which serves to hold it firmly in a socket S ofinsulating material into which it is cemented. A fine lamp filament l, supportedon a wire w, passes through the centre of the globe L. The filament is renderedincandescent in the middle portion, where the bombardment proceeding from thelower inside surface of the globe is most intense. The lower portion of theglobe, as far as the socket S reaches, is rendered conducting, either by atinfoil coating or otherwise, and the external electrode is connected to aterminal of the coil.The arrangement diagrammatically indicated in Fig. 24 was found to be aninferior one when it was desired to render incandescent a filament or buttonsupported in the centre of the globe, but it was convenient when the object wasto excite phosphorescence.In many experiments in which bodies of a different kind were mounted in the bulbas, for instance, indicated in Fig. 23, some observations of interest were made.It was found, among other things, that in such cases, no matter where thebombardment began, just as soon as a high temperature was reached there wasgenerally one of the bodies which seemed to take most of the bombardment uponitself, the other, or others, being thereby relieved. This quality appeared todepend principally on the point of fusion, and on the facility with which thebody was \"evaporated,\" or, generally speaking, disintegrated—meaning by thelatter term not only the throwing off of atoms, but likewise of larger lumps.The observation made was in accordance with generally accepted notions. In ahighly exhausted bulb electricity is carried off from the electrode byindependent carriers, which are partly the atoms, or molecules, of the residualatmosphere, and partly the atoms, molecules, or lumps thrown off from theelectrode. If the electrode is composed of bodies of different character, and ifone of these is more easily disintegrated than the others, most of theelectricity supplied is carried off from that body, which is then brought to ahigher temperature than the others, and this the more, as upon an increase ofthe temperature the body is still more easily disintegrated.It seems to me quite probable that a similar process takes place in the bulbeven with a homogeneous electrode, and I think it to be the principal cause ofthe disintegration. There is bound to be some irregularity, even if the surfaceis highly polished, which, of course, is impossible with most of the refractorybodies employed as electrodes. Assume that a point of the electrode gets hotter,instantly most of the discharge passes through that point, and a minute patch isprobably fused and evaporated. It is now possible that in consequence of theviolent disintegration the spot attacked sinks in temperature, or that a counterforce is created, as in an arc; at any rate, the local tearing off meets withthe limitations incident to the experiment, whereupon the same process occurs onanother place. To the eye the electrode appears uniformly brilliant, but thereaxe upon it points constantly shifting and wandering around, of a temperaturefar above the mean, and this materially hastens the process of deterioration.That some such thing occurs, at least when the electrode is at a lowertemperature, sufficient experimental evidence can be obtained in the followingmanner : Exhaust a bulb to a very high degree, so that with a fairly highpotential the discharge cannot pass—that is, not a luminous one, for a weakinvisible discharge occurs always, in all probability. Now raise slowly andcarefully the potential, leaving the primary current on no more than for aninstant. At a certain point, two, three, or half a dozen phosphorescent spotswill appear on the globe. These places of the glass are evidently more violentlybombarded than others, this being due to the unevenly distributed electricdensity, necessitated, of course, by sharp projections, or, generally speaking,irregularities of the electrode. But the luminous patches are constantlychanging in position, which is especially well observable if one manages toproduce very few, and this indicates that the configuration of the electrode israpidly changing.From experiences of this kind I am led to infer that, in order to be mostdurable, the refractory button in the bulb should be in the form of a spherewith a highly polished surface. Such a small sphere could be manufactured from adiamond or some other crystal, but a better way would be to fuse, by theemployment of extreme degrees of temperature, some oxide—as, for instance,zirconia—into a small drop, and then keep it in the bulb at a temperaturesomewhat below its point of fusion.Interesting and useful results can no doubt be reached in the direction ofextreme degrees of heat. How can such high temperatures be arrived at? How arethe highest degrees of heat reached in nature? By the impact of stars, by highspeeds and collisions. In a collision any rate of heat generation may beattained. In a chemical process we are limited. When oxygen and hydrogencombine, they fall, metaphorically speaking, from a definite height. We cannotgo very far with a blast, nor by confining heat in a furnace, but in anexhausted bulb we can concentrate any amount of energy upon a minute button.Leaving practicability out of consideration, this, then, would be the meanswhich, in my opinion, would enable us to reach the highest temperature. But agreat difficulty when proceeding in this way is encountered, namely, in mostcases the body is carried off before it can fuse and form a drop. Thisdifficulty exists principally with an oxide such as zirconia, because it cannotbe compressed in so hard a cake that it would not be carried off quickly. Iendeavored repeatedly to fuse zirconia, placing it in a cup or arc light carbonas indicated in Fig. 23. It glowed with a most intense light, and the stream ofthe particles projected out of the carbon cup was of a vivid white; but whetherit was compressed in a cake or made into a paste with carbon, it was carried offbefore it could be fused. The carbon cup containing the zirconia had to bemounted very low in the neck of a large bulb, as the heating of the glass by theprojected particles of the oxide was so rapid that in the first trial the bulbwas cracked almost in an instant when the current was turned on. The heating ofthe glass by the projected particles was found to be always greater when thecarbon cup contained a body which was rapidly carried off—I presume because insuch cases, with the same potential, higher speeds were reached, and alsobecause, per unit of time, more matter was projected—that is, more particleswould strike the glass.The before-mentioned difficulty did not exist, however, when the body mounted inthe carbon cup offered great resistance to deterioration. For instance, when anoxide was first fused in an oxygen blast and then mounted in the bulb, it meltedvery readily into a drop.Generally during the process of fusion magnificent light effects were noted, ofwhich it would be difficult to give an adequate idea. Fig. 23 is intended toillustrate the effect observed with a ruby drop. -At first one may see a narrowfunnel of white light projected against the top of the globe, where it producesan irregularly outlined phosphorescent patch. When the point of the ruby fusesthe phosphorescence becomes very powerful; but as the atoms are projected withmuch greater speed from the surface of the drop, soon the glass gets hot and\"tired,\" and now only the outer edge of the patch glows. In this manner anintensely phosphorescent, sharply defined line, I, corresponding to the outlineof the drop, is produced, which spreads slowly over the globe as the drop getslarger. When the mass begins to boil, small bubbles and cavities are formed,which cause dark colored spots to sweep across the globe. The bulb may be turneddownward without fear of the drop falling off, as the mass possessesconsiderable viscosity. I may mention here another feature of some interest,which I believe to have noted in the course of these experiments, though theobservations do not amount to a certitude. It appeared that under the molecularimpact caused by the rapidly alternating potential the body was fused andmaintained in that state at a lower temperature in a highly exhausted bulb thanwas the case at normal pressure and application of heat in the ordinary way—that is, at least, judging from the quantity of the light emitted. One of theexperiments performed may be mentioned here by way of illustration. A smallpiece of pumice stone was stuck on a platinum wire, and first melted to it in agas burner. The wire was next placed between two pieces of charcoal and a burnerapplied so as to produce an intense heat, sufficient to melt down the pumicestone into a small glass-like button. The platinum wire had to be taken ofsufficient thickness to prevent its melting in the fire. While in the charcoalfire, or when held in a burner to get a better idea of the degree of heat, thebutton glowed with great brilliancy. The wire with the button was then mountedin a bulb, and upon exhausting the same to a high degree, the current was turnedon slowly so as to prevent the cracking of the button. The button was heated tothe point of fusion, and when it melted it did not, apparently, glow with thesame brilliancy as before, and this would indicate a lower temperature. Leavingout of consideration the observer's possible, and even probable, error, thequestion is, can a body under these conditions be brought from a solid to aliquid state with evolution of less light? When the potential of a body israpidly alternated it is certain that the structure is jarred. When thepotential is very high, although the vibrations may be few—say 20,000 persecond—the effect upon the structure may be considerable. Suppose, for example,that a ruby is melted into a drop by a steady application of energy. When itforms a drop it will emit visible and invisible waves, which will be in adefinite ratio, and to the eye the drop will appear to be of a certainbrilliancy. Next, suppose we diminish to any degree we choose the energysteadily supplied, and, instead, supply energy which rises and falls accordingto a certain law. Now, when the drop is formed, there will be emitted from itthree different kinds of vibrations—the ordinary visible, and two kinds ofinvisible waves : that is, the ordinary dark waves of all lengths, and, inaddition, waves of a well defined character. The latter would not exist by asteady supply of the energy; still they help to jar and loosen the structure. Ifthis really be the case, then the ruby drop will emit relatively less visibleand more invisible waves than before. Thus it would seem that when a platinumwire, for instance, is fused by currents alternating with extreme rapidity, itemits at the point of fusion less light and more invisible radiation than itdoes when melted by a steady current, though the total energy used up in theprocess of fusion is the same in both cases. Or, to cite another example, a lampfilament is not capable of withstanding as long with currents of extremefrequency as it does with steady currents, assuming that it be worked at thesame luminous intensity. This means that for rapidly alternating currents thefilament should be shorter and thicker. The higher the frequency—that is, thegreater the departure from the steady flow—the worse it would be for thefilament. But if the truth of this remark were demonstrated, it would beerroneous to conclude that such a refractory button as used in these bulbs wouldbe deteriorated quicker by currents of extremely high frequency than by steadyor low frequency currents. From experience I may say that just the oppositeholds good: the button withstands the bombardment better with currents of veryhigh frequency. But this is due to the fact that a high frequency dischargepasses through a rarefied gas with much greater freedom than a steady or lowfrequency discharge, and this will say that with the former we can work with alower potential or with a less violent impact. As long, then, as the gas is ofno consequence, a steady or low frequency current is better; but as soon as theaction of the gas is desired and important, high frequencies are preferable.In the course of these experiments a great many trials were made with all kindsof carbon buttons. Electrodes made of ordinary carbon buttons were decidedlymore durable when the buttons were obtained by the application of enormouspressure. Electrodes prepared by depositing carbon in well known ways did notshow up well; they blackened the globe very quickly. From many experiences Iconclude that lamp filaments obtained in this manner can be advantageously usedonly with low potentials and low frequency currents. Some kinds of carbonwithstand so well that, in order to bring them to the point of fusion, it isnecessary to employ very small buttons. In this case the observation is renderedvery difficult on account of the intense heat produced. Nevertheless there canbe no doubt that all kinds of carbon are fused under the molecular bombardment,but the liquid state must be one of great instability. Of all the bodies triedthere were two which withstood best—diamond and carborundum. These two showed upabout equally, but the latter was preferable, for many reasons. As it is morethan likely that this body is not yet generally known, I will venture to callyour attention to it.It has been recently produced by Mr. E. G. Acheson, of Monongahela City, Pa., U.S. A. It is intended to replace ordinary diamond powder for polishing preciousstones, etc., and I have been informed that it accomplishes this object quitesuccessfully. I do not know why the name \"carborundum\" has been given to it,unless there is something in the process of its manufacture which justifies thisselection. Through the kindness of the inventor, I obtained a short while agosome samples which I desired to test in regard to their qualities ofphosphorescence and capability of withstanding high degrees of heat.Carborundum can be obtained in two forms—in the form of \"crystals\" and ofpowder. The former appear to the naked eye dark colored, but are very brilliant;the latter is of nearly the same color as ordinary diamond powder, but very muchfiner. When viewed under a microscope the samples of crystals given to me didnot appear to have any definite form, but rather resembled pieces of broken upegg coal of fine quality. The majority were opaque, but there were some whichwere transparent and colored. The crystals are a kind of carbon containing someimpurities, they are extremely hard, and withstand for a long time even anoxygen blast. When the blast is directed against them they at first form a cakeof some compactness, probably in consequence of the fusion of impurities theycontain. The mass withstands for a very long time the blast without furtherfusion ; but a slow Carrying off, or burning, occurs, and, finally, a smallquantity of a glass-like residue is left, which, I suppose, is melted alumina.When compressed strongly they conduct very well, but not as well as ordinarycarbon. The powder, which is obtained from the crystals in some way, ispractically non-conducting. It affords a magnificent polishing material forstones.The time has been too short to make a satisfactory study of the properties ofthis product, but enough experience has been gained in a few weeks I haveexperimented upon it to say that it does possess some remarkable properties inmany respects. It withstands excessively high degrees of heat, it is littledeteriorated by molecular bombardment, and it does not blacken the globe asordinary carbon does. The only difficulty which I have found in its use inconnection with these experiments was to find some binding material which wouldresist the heat and the effect of the bombardment as successfully as carborundumitself does.I have here a number of bulbs which I have provided with buttons of carborundum.To make such a button of carborundum crystals I proceed in the following manner:I take an ordinary lamp filament and dip its point in tar, or some other thicksubstance or paint which maybe readily carbonized. I next pass the point of thefilament through the crystals, and then hold it vertically over a hot plate. Thetar softens and forms a drop on the point of the filament, the crystals adheringto the surface of the drop. By regulating the distance from the plate the tar isslowly dried out and the button becomes solid. I then once more dip the buttonin tar and hold it again over a plate until the tar is evaporated, leaving onlya hard mass which firmly binds the crystals. When a larger button is required Irepeat the process several times, and I generally also cover the filament acertain distance below the button with crystals. The button being mounted in abulb, when a good vacuum has been reached, first a weak and then a strongdischarge is passed through the bulb to carbonize the tar and expel all gases,and later it is brought to a very intense incandescence.When the powder is used I have found it best to proceed as follows: I make athick paint of carborundum and tar, and pass a lamp filament through the paint.Taking then most of the paint off by rubbing the filament against a piece ofchamois leather, I hold it over a hot plate until the tar evaporates and thecoating becomes firm. I repeat this process as many times as it is necessary toobtain a certain thickness of coating. On the point of the coated filament Iform a button in the same manner.There is no doubt that such a button—properly prepared under great pressure—ofcarborundum, especially of powder of the best quality, will withstand the effectof the bombardment fully as well as anything we know. The difficulty is that thebinding material gives way, and the carborundum is slowly thrown off after sometime. As it does not seem to blacken the globe in the least, it might be founduseful for coating the filaments of ordinary incandescent lamps, and I thinkthat it is even possible to produce thin threads or sticks of carborundum whichwill replace the ordinary filaments in an incandescent lamp. A carborundumcoating seems to be more durable than other coatings, not only because thecarborundum can withstand high degrees of heat, but also because it seems tounite with the carbon better than any other material I have tried. A coating ofzirconia or any other oxide, for instance, is far more quickly destroyed. Iprepared buttons of diamond dust in the same manner as of carborundum, and thesecame in durability nearest to those prepared of carborundum, but the bindingpaste- gave way much more quickly in the diamond buttons : this, however, Iattributed to the size and irregularity of the grains of the diamond.It was of interest to find whether carborundum possesses the quality ofphosphorescence. One is, of course, prepared to encounter two difficulties:first, as regards the rough product, the \"crystals,\" they are good conducting,and it is a fact that conductors do not phosphoresce ; second, the powder, beingexceedingly fine, would not be apt to exhibit very prominently this quality,since we know that when crystals, even such as diamond or ruby, are finelypowdered, they lose the property of phosphorescence to a considerable degree.The question presents itself here, can a conductor phosphoresce? What is therein such a body as a metal, for instance, that would deprive it of the quality ofphosphorescence, unless it is that property which characterizes it as aconductor? for it is a fact that most of the phosphorescent bodies lose thatquality when they are sufficiently heated to become more or less conducting.Then, if a metal be in a large measure, or perhaps entirely, deprived of thatproperty, it should be capable of phosphorescence. Therefore it is quitepossible that at some extremely high frequency when behaving practically as anon-conductor, a metal or any other conductor might exhibit the quality ofphosphorescence, even though it be entirely incapable of phosphorescing underthe impact of a low-frequency discharge. There is, however, another possible wayhow a conductor might at least appear to phosphoresce.Considerable doubt still exists as to what really is phosphorescence, and as towhether the various phenomena comprised under this head are due to the samecauses. Suppose that in an exhausted bulb, under the molecular impact, thesurface of a piece of metal or other conductor is rendered strongly luminous,but at the same time it is found that it remains comparatively cool, would notthis luminosity be called phosphorescence? Now such a result, theoretically atleast, is possible, for it is a mere question of potential or speed. Assume thepotential of the electrode, and consequently the speed of the projected atoms,to be sufficiently high, the surface of the metal piece against which the atomsare projected would be rendered highly incandescent, since the process of heatgeneration would be incomparably faster than that of radiating or conductingaway from the surface of the collision. In the eye of the observer a singleimpact of the atoms would cause an instantaneous flash, but if the impacts wererepeated with sufficient rapidity they would produce a continuous impressionupon his retina. To him then the surface of the metal would appear continuouslyincandescent and of constant luminous intensity, while in reality the lightwould be either intermittent or at least changing periodically in intensity. Themetal piece would rise in temperature until equilibrium was attained—that is,until the energy continuously radiated would equal that intermittently supplied.But the supplied energy might under such conditions not be sufficient to bringthe body to any more than a very moderate mean temperature, especially if thefrequency of the atomic impacts be very low— just enough that the fluctuation ofthe intensity of the light emitted could not be detected by the eye. The bodywould now, owing to the manner in which the energy is supplied, emit a stronglight, and yet be at a comparatively very low mean temperature. How could theobserver call the luminosity thus produced? Even if the analysis of the lightwould teach him something definite, still he would probably rank it under thephenomena of phosphorescence. It is conceivable that in such a way bothconducting and non-conducting bodies may be maintained at a certain luminousintensity, but the energy required would very greatly vary with the nature andproperties of the bodies. These and some foregoing remarks of a speculativenature were made merely to bring out curious features of alternate currents orelectric impulses. By their help we may cause a body to emit more light, whileat a certain mean temperature, than it would emit if brought to that temperatureby a steady supply; and, again, we may bring a body to the point of fusion, andcause it to emit less light than when fused by the application of energy inordinary ways. It all depends on how we supply the energy, and what kind ofvibrations we set up: in one case the vibrations are more, in the other less,adapted to affect our sense of vision.Some effects, which I had not observed before, obtained with carborundum in thefirst trials, I attributed to phosphorescence, but in subsequent experiments itappeared that it was devoid of that quality. The crystals possess a noteworthyfeature. In a bulb provided with a single electrode in the shape of a smallcircular metal disc, for instance, at a certain degree of exhaustion theelectrode is covered with a milky film, which is separated by a dark space fromthe glow filling the bulb. When the metal disc is covered with carborundumcrystals, the film is far more intense, and snow-white. This I found later to bemerely an effect of the bright surface of the crystals, for when an aluminiumelectrode was highly polished it exhibited more or less the same phenomenon. Imade a number of experiments with the samples of crystals obtained, principallybecause it would have been of special interest to find that they are capable ofphosphorescence, on account of their being conducting. I could not producephosphorescence distinctly, but I must remark that a decisive opinion cannot beformed until other experimenters have gone over the same ground.The powder behaved in some experiments as though it contained alumina, but itdid not exhibit with sufficient distinctness the red of the latter. Its deadcolor brightens considerably under the molecular impact, but I am now convincedit does not phosphoresce. Still, the tests with the powder are not conclusive,because powdered carborundum probably does not behave like a phosphorescentsulphide, for example, which could be finely powdered without impairing thephosphorescence, but rather like powdered ruby or diamond, and therefore itwould be necessary, in order to make a decisive test, to obtain it in a largelump and polish up the surface.If the carborundum proves useful in connection with these and similarexperiments, its chief value will be found in the production of coatings, thinconductors, buttons, or other electrodes capable of withstanding extremely highdegrees of heat.The production of a small electrode capable of withstanding enormoustemperatures I regard as of the greatest importance in. the manufacture oflight. It would enable us to obtain, by means of currents of very highfrequencies, certainly 20 times, if not more, the quantity of light which isobtained in the present incandescent lamp by the same expenditure of energy.This estimate may appear to many exaggerated, but in reality I think it is farfrom being so. As this statement might be misunderstood I think it necessary toexpose clearly the problem with which in this line of work we are confronted,and the manner in which, in my opinion, a solution will be arrived at.Anyone who begins a study of the problem will be apt to think that what iswanted in a lamp with an electrode is a very high degree of incandescence of theelectrode. There he will be mistaken. The high incandescence of the button is anecessary evil, but what is really wanted is the high incandescence of the gassurrounding the button. In other words, the problem in such a lamp is to bring amass of gas to the highest possible incandescence. The higher the incandescence,the quicker the mean vibration, the greater is the economy of the lightproduction. But to maintain a mass of gas at a high degree of incandescence in aglass vessel, it will always be necessary to keep the incandescent mass awayfrom the glass ; that is, to confine it as much as possible to the centralportion of the globe.In one of the experiments this evening a brush was produced at the end of awire. This brush was a flame, a source of heat and light. It did not emit muchperceptible heat, nor did it glow with an intense light; but is it the less aflame because it does not scorch my hand? Is it the less a flame because it doesnot hurt my eye by its brilliancy? The problem is precisely to produce in thebulb such a flame, much smaller in size, but incomparably more powerful. Werethere means at hand for producing electric impulses of a sufficiently highfrequency, and for transmitting them, the bulb could be done away with, unlessit were used to protect the electrode, or to economize the energy by confiningthe heat. But as such means are not at disposal, it becomes necessary to placethe terminal in a bulb ' and rarefy the air in the same. This is done merely toen- f able the apparatus to perform the work which it is not capable ofperforming at ordinary air pressure. In the bulb we are able to intensify theaction to any degree—so far that the brush emits a powerful light.The intensity of the light emitted depends principally on the frequency andpotential of the impulses, and on the electric density on the surface of theelectrode. It is of the greatest importance to employ the smallest possiblebutton, in order to push the density very far. Under the violent impact of themolecules of the gas surrounding it, the small electrode is of course brought toan extremely high temperature, but around it is a mass of highly incandescentgas, a flame photosphere, many hundred times the volume of the electrode. With adiamond, carborundum or zirconia button the photosphere can be as much as onethousand times the volume of the button. Without much reflecting one would thinkthat in pushing so far the incandescence of the electrode it would be instantlyvolatilized. But after a careful consideration he would find that,theoretically, it should not occur, and in this fact—which, however, isexperimentally demonstrated—lies principally the future value of such a lamp.At first, when the bombardment begins, most of the work is performed on thesurface of the button, but when a highly conducting photosphere is formed thebutton is comparatively relieved. The higher the incandescence of thephotosphere the more it approaches in conductivity to that of the electrode, andthe more, therefore, the solid and the gas form one conducting body. Theconsequence is that the further is forced the incandescence the more work,comparatively, is performed on the gas, and the less on the electrode. Theformation of a powerful photosphere is consequently the very means forprotecting the electrode, This protection, of course, is a relative one, and itshould not be thought that by pushing the incandescence higher the electrode isactually less deteriorated Still, theoretically, with extreme frequencies, thisresult must be reached, but probably at a temperature too high for most of therefractory bodies known. Given, then, an electrode which can withstand to a veryhigh limit the effect of the bombardment and outward strain, it would be safe nomatter how much it is forced beyond that limit. In an incandescent lamp quitedifferent considerations apply. There the gas is not at all concerned: the wholeof the work is performed on the filament; and the life of the lamp diminishes sorapidly with the increase of the degree of incandescence that economical reasonscompel us to work it at a low incandescence. But if an incandescent lamp isoperated with currents of very high frequency, the action of the gas cannot beneglected, and the rules for the most economical working must be considerablymodified.In order to bring such a lamp with one or two electrodes to a great perfection,it is necessary to employ impulses of very high frequency. The high frequencysecures, among others, two chief advantages, which have a most important bearingupon the economy of the light production. First, the deterioration of theelectrode is reduced by reason of the fact that we employ a great many smallimpacts, instead of a few violent ones, which shatter quickly the structure;secondly, the formation of a large photosphere is facilitated.In order to reduce the deterioration of the electrode to the minimum, it isdesirable that the vibration be harmonic, for any suddenness hastens the processof destruction. An electrode lasts much longer when kept at incandescence bycurrents, or impulses, obtained from a high-frequency alternator, which rise andfall more or less harmonically, than by impulses obtained from a disruptivedischarge coil. In the latter case there is no doubt that most of the damage isdone by the fundamental sudden discharges.One of the elements of loss in such a lamp is the bombardment of the globe. Asthe potential is very high, the molecules are projected with great speed ; theystrike the glass, and usually excite a strong phosphorescence. The effectproduced is very pretty, but for economical reasons it would be perhapspreferable to prevent, or at least reduce to the minimum, the bombardmentagainst the globe, as in such case it is, as a rule, not the object to excitephosphorescence, and as some loss of energy results from the bombardment. Thisloss in the bulb is principally dependent on the potential of the impulses andon the electric density on the surface of the electrode. In employing very highfrequencies the loss of energy by the bombardment is greatly reduced, for,first, the potential needed to perform a given amount of work is much smaller;and, secondly, by producing a highly conducting photosphere around theelectrode, the same result is obtained as though the electrode were much larger,which is equivalent to a smaller electric density. But be it by the diminutionof the maximum potential or of the density, the gain is effected in the samemanner, namely, by avoiding violent shocks, which strain the glass much beyondits limit of elasticity. If the frequency could be brought high enough the lossdue to the imperfect elasticity of the glass would be entirely negligible. Theloss due to bombardment of the globe may, however, be reduced by using twoelectrodes instead of one. In such case each of the electrodes may be connectedto one of the terminals; or else, if it is preferable to use only one wire, oneelectrode may be connected to one terminal and the other to the ground or to aninsulated body of some surface, as, for instance, a shade on the lamp. In thelatter case, unless some judgment is used, one of the electrodes might glow moreintensely than the other.But on the whole I find it preferable when using such high frequencies to employonly one electrode and one connecting wire. I am convinced that the illuminatingdevice of the near future will not require for its operation more than one lead,and, at any rate, it will have no leading-in wire, since the energy required canbe as well transmitted through the glass. In experimental bulbs the leading-inwire is most generally used on account of convenience, as in employing condensercoatings in the manner indicated in Fig. 22, for example, there is somedifficulty in fitting the parts, but these difficulties would not exist if agreat many bulbs were manufactured; otherwise the energy can be conveyed throughthe glass as well as through a wire, and with these high frequencies the lossesare very small. Such illuminating devices will necessarily involve the use ofvery high potentials, and this, in the eyes of practical men, might be anobjectionable feature. Yet, in reality, high potentials are not objectionable —certainly not in the least as far as the safety of the devices is concerned.There are two ways of rendering an electric appliance safe. One is to use lowpotentials, the other is to determine the dimensions of the apparatus so that itis safe no matter how high a potential is used. Of the two the latter seems tome the better way, for then the safety is absolute, unaffected by any possiblecombination of circumstances which might render even a low-potential appliancedangerous to life and property. But the practical conditions require not onlythe judicious determination of the dimensions of the apparatus ; they likewisenecessitate the employment of energy of the proper kind. It is easy, forinstance, to construct a transformer capable of giving, when operated from anordinary alternate current machine of low tension, say 50,000 volts, which mightbe required to light a highly exhausted phosphorescent tube, so that, in spiteof the high potential, it is perfectly safe, the shock from it producing noinconvenience. Still, such a transformer would be expensive, and in itselfinefficient; and, besides, what energy was obtained from it would not beeconomically used for the production of light. The economy demands theemployment of energy in the form of extremely rapid vibrations. The problem ofproducing light has been likened to that of maintaining a certain high-pitchnote by means of a bell. It should be said a barely audible note; and even thesewords would not express it, so wonderful is the sensitiveness of the eye. We maydeliver powerful blows at long intervals, waste a good deal of energy, and stillnot get what we want; or we may keep up the note by delivering frequent gentletaps, and get nearer to the object sought by the expenditure of much lessenergy. In the production of light, as far as the illuminating device isconcerned, there can be only one rule—that is, to use as high frequencies as canbe obtained; but the means for the production and conveyance of impulses of suchcharacter impose, at present at least, great limitations. Once it is decided touse very high frequencies, the return wire becomes unnecessary, and all theappliances are simplified. By the use of obvious means the same result isobtained as though the return wire were used. It is sufficient for this purposeto bring in contact with the bulb, or merely in the vicinity of the same, aninsulated body of some surface. The surface need, of course, be the smaller, thehigher the frequency and potential used, and necessarily, also, the higher theeconomy of the lamp or other device.This plan of working has been resorted to on several occasions this evening. So,for instance, when the incandescence of a button was produced by grasping thebulb with the hand, the body of the experimenter merely served to intensify theaction. The bulb used was similar to that illustrated in Fig. 19, and the coilwas excited to a small potential, not sufficient to bring the button toincandescence when the bulb was hanging from the wire; and incidentally, inorder to perform the experiment in a more suitable manner, the button was takenso large that a perceptible time had to elapse before, upon grasping the bulb,it could be rendered incandescent. The contact with the bulb was, of course,quite-unnecessary. It is easy, by using a rather large bulb with an exceedinglysmall electrode, to adjust the conditions so that the latter is brought tobright incandescence by the mere approach of the experimenter within a few feetof the bulb, and that the incandescence subsides upon his receding.In another experiment, when phosphorescence was excited, a similar bulb wasused. Here again, originally, the potential was not sufficient to excitephosphorescence until the action was intensified—in this case, however) topresent a different feature, by touching the socket with a metallic object heldin the hand. The electrode in the bulb was a carbon button so large that itcould not be brought to incandescence, and thereby spoil the effect produced byphosphorescence.Again, in another of the early experiments, a bulb was used as illustrated inFig. 13. In this instance, by touching the bulb with one or two fingers, one ortwo shadows of the stem inside were projected against the glass, the touch ofthe finger producing the same result as the application of an external negativeelectrode under ordinary circumstances.In all these experiments the action was intensified by augmenting the capacityat the end of the lead connected to the terminal. As a rule, it is not necessaryto resort to such means, and would be quite unnecessary with still higherfrequencies ; but when it is desired, the bulb, or tube, can be easily adaptedto the purpose.In Fig. 24, for example, an experimental bulb L is shown, which is provided witha neck n on the top for the application of an external tinfoil coating, whichmay be connected to a body of larger surface. Such a lamp as illustrated in Fig.25 may also be lighted by connecting the tinfoil coating on the neck n to theterminal, and the leading-in wire to to an insulated plate. If the bulb standsin a socket upright, as shown in the cut, a shade of conducting Material may beslipped in the neck n, and the action thus magnified.[../Images/main-47.png]FIG. 24.—BULB WITHOUT LEADING-IN WIRE, SHOWING EFFECT OF PROJECTED MATTER.[../Images/main-48.jpg]FIG 25 - IMPROVED EXPERIMENTAL BULB[../Images/main-49.png]FIG 26 - IMPROVED BULB WITH INTENSIFYING REFLECTORA more perfected arrangement used in some of these bulbs is illustrated in Fig.26. In this case the construction of the bulb is as shown and described before,when reference was made to Fig. 19. A zinc sheet Z, with a tubular extension T,is slipped over the metallic socket S. The bulb hangs downward from theterminal, the zinc sheet Z, performing the double office of intensifier andreflector. The reflector is separated from the terminal t by an extension of theinsulating plug P. A similar disposition with a phosphorescent tube isillustrated in Fig. 27. The tube T is prepared from two short tubes of adifferent diameter, which are sealed on the ends. On the lower end is placed anoutside conducting coating Q which connects to the wire w. The wire has a hookon the upper end for suspension, and passes through the centre of the insidetube, which is filled with some good and tightly packed insulator. On theoutside of the upper end of the tube T is another conducting coating C, uponwhich is slipped a metallic reflector Z, which should be separated by a thickinsulation from the end of wire w.[../Images/main-50.png]FIG. 27.-PHOSPHORESCENT TUBE WITH INTENSIFYING REFLECTOR.The economical use of such a reflector or intensifier would require that allenergy supplied to an air condenser should be recoverable, or, in other words,that there should not be any losses, neither in the gaseous medium nor throughits action elsewhere. This is far from being so, but, fortunately, the lossesmay be reduced to anything desired. A few remarks are necessary on this subject,in order to make the experiences gathered in the course of these investigationsperfectly clear.Suppose a small helix with many well insulated turns, as in experiment Fig. 17,has one of its ends connected to one of the terminals of the induction coil, andthe other to a metal plate, or, for the sake of simplicity, a sphere, insulatedin space. When the coil is set to work, the potential of the sphere isalternated, and the small helix now behaves as though its free end wereconnected to the other terminal of the induction coil. If an iron rod be heldwithin the small helix it is quickly brought to a high temperature, indicatingthe passage of a strong current through the helix. How does the insulated sphereact in this case?It can be a condenser, storing and returning the energy supplied to it, or itcan be a mere sink of energy, and the conditions of the experiment determinewhether it is more one or the other. The sphere being charged to a highpotential, it acts inductively upon the surrounding air, or whatever gaseousmedium there might be. The molecules, or atoms, which are near the sphere are ofcourse more attracted, and move through a greater distance than the fartherones. When the nearest molecules strike the sphere they are repelled, andcollisions occur at all distances within the inductive action of the sphere. Itis now clear that, if the potential be steady, but little loss of energy can becaused in this way, for the molecules which are nearest to the sphere, havinghad an additional charge imparted to them by contact, are not attracted untilthey have parted, if not with all, at least with most of the additional charge,which can be accomplished only after a great many collisions. From the fact thatwith a steady potential there is but little loss in dry air, one must come tosuch a conclusion. When the potential of the sphere, instead of being steady, isalternating, the conditions are entirely different. In this case a rhythmicalbombardment occurs, no matter whether the molecules after coming in contact withthe sphere lose the imparted charge or not; what is more, if the charge is notlost, the impacts are only the more violent. Still if the frequency of theimpulses be very small, the loss caused by the impacts and collisions would notbe serious unless the potential were excessive. But when extremely highfrequencies and more or less high potentials are used, the loss may be verygreat. The total energy lost per unit of time is proportionate to the product ofthe number of impacts per second, or the frequency and the energy lost in eachimpact. But the energy of an impact must be proportionate to the square of theelectric density of the sphere, since the charge imparted to the molecule isproportionate to that density. I conclude from this that the total energy lostmust be proportionate to the product of the frequency and the square of theelectric density ; but this law needs experimental confirmation. Assuming thepreceding considerations to be true, then, by rapidly alternating the potentialof a body immersed in an insulating gaseous medium, any amount of energy may bedissipated into space. Most of that energy then, I believe, is not dissipated inthe form of long ether waves, propagated to considerable distance, as is thoughtmost generally, but is consumed—in the case of an insulated sphere, forexample—in impact and collisional losses—that is, heat violations—on the surfaceand in the vicinity of the sphere. To reduce the dissipation it is necessary towork with a small electric density— the smaller the higher the frequency.But since, on the assumption before made, the loss is diminished with the squareof the density, and since currents of very high frequencies involve considerablewaste when transmitted through conductors, it follows that, on the whole, it isbetter to employ one wire than two. Therefore, if motors, lamps, or devices ofany kind are perfected, capable of being advantageously operated by currents ofextremely high frequency, economical reasons will make it advisable to use onlyone wire, especially if the distances are great.When energy is absorbed in a condenser the same behaves as though its capacitywere increased. Absorption always exists more or less, but generally it is smalland of no consequence as long as the frequencies are not very great. In usingextremely high frequencies, and, necessarily in such case, also high potentials,the absorption— or, what is here meant more particularly by this term, the lossof energy due to the presence of a gaseous medium—is an important factor to beconsidered, as the energy absorbed in the air condenser may be any fraction ofthe supplied energy. This would seem to make it very difficult to tell from themeasured or computed capacity of an air condenser its actual capacity orvibration period, especially if the condenser is of very small surface and ischarged to a very high potential. As many important results are dependent uponthe correctness of the estimation of the vibration period, this subject demandsthe most careful scrutiny of other investigators. To reduce the probable erroras much as possible in experiments of the kind alluded to, it is advisable touse spheres or plates of large surface, so as to make the density exceedinglysmall. Otherwise, when it is practicable, an oil condenser should be used inpreference. In oil or other liquid dielectrics there are seemingly no suchlosses as in gaseous media. It being impossible to exclude entirely the gas incondensers with solid dielectrics, such condensers should be immersed in oil,for economical reasons if nothing else; they can then be strained to the utmostand will remain cool. In Leyden jars the loss due to air is comparatively small,as the tinfoil coatings are large, close together, and the charged surfaces notdirectly exposed; but when the potentials are very high, the loss may be more orless considerable at, or near, the upper edge of the foil, where the air isprincipally acted upon. If the jar be immersed in boiled-out oil, it will becapable of performing four times the amount of work which it can for any lengthof time when used in the ordinary way, and the loss will be inappreciable.It should not be thought that the loss in heat in an air condenser isnecessarily associated with the formation of visible streams or brushes. If asmall electrode, inclosed in an unexhausted bulb, is connected to one of theterminals of the coil, streams can be seen to issue from the electrode and theair in the bulb is heated; if, instead of a small electrode, a large sphere isinclosed in the bulb, no streams are observed, still the air is heated.Nor should it be thought that the temperature of an air condenser would giveeven an approximate idea of the loss in heat incurred, as in such case heat mustbe given off much more quickly, since there is, in addition to the ordinaryradiation, a very active carrying away of heat by independent carriers going on,and since not only the apparatus, but the air at some distance from it is heatedin consequence of the collisions which must occur.Owing to this, in experiments with such a coil, a rise of temperature can bedistinctly observed only when the body connected to the coil is very small. Butwith apparatus on a larger scale, even a body of considerable bulk would beheated, as, for instance, the body of a person ; and I think that skilledphysicians might make observations of utility in such experiments, which, if theapparatus were judiciously designed, would not present the slightest danger.A question of some interest, principally to meteorologists, presents itselfhere. How does the earth behave? The earth is an air condenser, but is it aperfect or a very imperfect one—a mere sink of energy? There can be little doubtthat to such small disturbance as might be caused in an experiment the earthbehaves as an almost perfect condenser. But it might be different when itscharge is set in vibration by some sudden disturbance occurring in the heavens.In such case, as before stated, probably only little of the energy of thevibrations set up would be lost into space in the form of long ether radiations,but most of the energy, I think, would spend itself in molecular impacts andcollisions, and pass off into space in the form of short heat, and possiblylight, waves. As both the frequency of the vibrations of the charge and thepotential are in all probability excessive, the energy converted into heat maybe considerable. Since the density must be unevenly distributed, either inconsequence of the irregularity of the earth's surface, or on account of thecondition of the atmosphere in various places, the effect produced wouldaccordingly vary from place to place. Considerable variations in the temperatureand pressure of the atmosphere may in this manner be caused at any point of thesurface of the earth. The variations may be gradual or very sudden, according tothe nature of the general disturbance, and may produce rain and storms, orlocally modify the weather in any way. From the remarks before made one may seewhat an important factor of loss the air in the neighborhood of a chargedsurface becomes when the electric density is great and the frequency of theimpulses excessive. But the action as explained implies that the air isinsulating—that is that it is composed of independent carriers immersed in aninsulating medium. This is the case only when the air is at something likeordinary or greater, or at extremely small, pressure. When the air is slightlyrarefied and con ducting, then true conduction losses occur also. In such case,of course, considerable energy may be dissipated into space even with a steadypotential, or with impulses of low frequency, if the density is very great.When the gas is at very low pressure, an electrode is heated more because higherspeeds can be reached. If the gas around the electrode is strongly compressed,the displacements, and consequently the speeds, are very small, and the heatingis insignificant. But if in such case the frequency could be sufficientlyincreased, the electrode would be brought to a high temperature as well as ifthe gas were at very low pressure; in fact, exhausting the bulb is onlynecessary because we cannot produce (and possibly not convey) currents of therequired frequency.Returning to the subject of electrode lamps, it is obviously of advantage insuch a lamp to confine as much as possible the heat to the electrode bypreventing the circulation of the gas in the bulb. If a very small bulb betaken, it would confine the heat better than a large one, but it might not be ofsufficient capacity to be operated from the coil, or, if so, the glass might gettoo hot. A simple way to improve in this direction is to employ a globe of therequired size, but to place a small bulb, the diameter of which is properlyestimated, over the refractory button contained in the globe. This arrangementis illustrated in Fig. 28. The globe L has in this case a large neck n, allowingthe small bulb b to slip through. Otherwise the construction is the same asshown in Fig. 18, for example. The small bulb is conveniently supported upon thestem s, carrying the refractory button m. It is separated from the aluminiumtube a by several layers of mica M, in order to prevent the cracking of the neckby the rapid heating c f the aluminium tube upon a sudden turning on of thecurrent. The inside bulb should be as small as possible when it is desired toobtain light only by incandescence of the electrode. If it is desired to producephosphorescence, the bulb should be larger, else it would be apt to get too hot,and the phosphorescence would cease. In this arrangement usually only the smallbulb shows phosphorescence, as there is practically no bombardment against theouter globe. In some of these bulbs constructed as illustrated in Fig. 28 thesmall tube was coated with phosphorescent paint, and beautiful effects wereobtained. Instead of making the inside bulb large, in order to avoid undueheating, it answers the purpose to make the electrode m larger. In this case thebombardment is weakened by reason of the smaller electric density.Many bulbs were constructed on the plan illustrated in Fig. 29. Here a smallbulb b, containing the refractory button m, upon being exhausted to a very highdegree was sealed in a large globe L, which was then moderately exhausted andsealed off. The principal advantage of this construction was that it allowed ofreaching extremely high vacuum, and, at the same time use a large bulb. It wasfound, m the course of experiences with bulbs such as illustrated in Fig. 29,that it was well to make the stem s near the seal at e very thick, and theleading-in wire w thin, as it occurred sometimes that the stem at e was heatedand the bulb was cracked. Often the outer globe L was exhausted only just enoughto allow the discharge to pass through and the space between the bulbs appearedcrimson, producing a curious effect. In some cases, when the exhaustion in globeL was very low, and the air good conducting it was found necessary, in order tobring the button m to high incandescence, to place, preferably on the upper partof the neck of the globe, a tinfoil coating which was connected to an insulatedbody, to the ground, or to the other terminal of the coil, as the highlyconducting air weakened the effect somewhat, probably by being acted uponinductively from the wire w, where it entered the bulb at e. Anotherdifficulty—which, however, is always present when the refractory button ismounted in a very small bulb existed in the construction illustrated in Fig. 29,namely, the vacuum in the bulb b would be impaired in a comparatively shorttime."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/main-52.png]FIG. 28.—LAMP WITH AUXILIARY BULB FOR CONFINING THE ACTION TO THE CENTRE.The chief idea in the two last described constructions was to confine the heatto the central portion of the globe by preventing the exchange of air. Anadvantage is secured, but owing to the heating of the inside bulb and slowevaporation of the glass the vacuum is hard to maintain, even if theconstruction illustrated in Fig. 28 be chosen, in which both bulbs communicate.But by far the better way—the ideal way—would be to reach sufficiently highfrequencies. The higher the frequency the slower would be the exchange of theair, and I think that a frequency may be reached at which there would be noexchange whatever of the air molecules around the terminal. We would thenproduce a flame in which there would be no carrying away of material, and aqueer flame it would be, for it would be rigid! With such high frequencies theinertia of the particles would come into play. As the brush, or flame, wouldgain rigidity in virtue of the inertia of the particles, the exchange of thelatter would be prevented. This would necessarily occur, for, the number of theimpulses being augmented, the potential energy of each would diminish, so thatfinally only atomic vibrations could be set up, and the motion of translationthrough durable space would cease. Thus an ordinary gas burner connected to asource of rapidly alternating potential might have its efficiency augmented to acertain limit, and this for two reasons—because of the additional vibrationimparted, and because of a slowing down of the process of carrying off. But therenewal being rendered difficult, and renewal being necessary to maintain theburner, a continued increase of the frequency of the impulses, assuming theycould be transmitted to and impressed upon the flame, would result in the\"extinction\" of the latter, meaning by this term only the cessation of thechemical process.[../Images/main-51.png]FIG. 29.—LAMP WITH INDEPENDENT AUXILIARY BULB.I think, however, that in the case of an electrode immersed in a fluidinsulating medium, and surrounded by independent carriers of electric charges,which can be acted upon inductively, a sufficiently high frequency of theimpulses would probably result in a gravitation of the gas all around toward theelectrode. For this it would be only necessary to assume that the independentbodies are irregularly shaped; they would then turn toward the electrode theirside of the greatest electric density, and this would be a position in which thefluid resistance to approach would be smaller than that offered to the receding.The general opinion, I do not doubt, is that it is out of the question to reachany such frequencies as might—assuming some of the views before expressed to betrue— produce any of the results which I have pointed out as mere possibilities.This may be so, but in the course of these investigations, from the observationof many phenomena I have gained the conviction that these frequencies would bemuch lower than one is apt to estimate at first. In a flame we set up lightvibrations by causing molecules, or atoms, to collide.But what is the ratio of the frequency of the collisions and that of thevibrations set up? Certainly it must be incomparably smaller than that of theknocks of the bell and the sound vibrations, or that of the discharges and theoscillations of the condenser. We may cause the molecules of the gas to collideby the use of alternate electric impulses of high frequency, and so we mayimitate the process in a flame ; and from experiments with frequencies which weare now able to obtain, I think that the result is producible with impulseswhich are transmissible through a conductor.In connection with thoughts of a similar nature, it appeared to me of greatinterest to demonstrate the rigidity of a vibrating gaseous column. Althoughwith such low frequencies as, say 10,000 per second, which I was able to obtainwithout difficulty from a specially constructed alternator, the task lookeddiscouraging at first, I made a series of experiments. The trials with air atordinary pressure led to no result, but with air moderately rarefied I obtainwhat I think to be an unmistakable experimental evidence of the property soughtfor. As a result of this kind might lead able investigators to conclusions ofimportance I will describe one of the experiments performed.It is well known that when a tube is slightly exhausted the discharge may bepassed through it in the form of a thin luminous thread. When produced withcurrents of low frequency, obtained from a coil operated as usual, this threadis inert. If a magnet be approached to it, the part near the same is attractedor repelled, according to the direction of the lines of force of the magnet. Itoccurred to me that if such a thread would be produced with currents of veryhigh frequency, it should be more or less rigid, and as it was visible it couldbe easily studied. Accordingly I prepared a tube about 1 inch in diameter and 1metre long, with outside coating at each end. The tube was exhausted to a pointat which by a little working the thread discharge could be obtained. It must beremarked here that the general aspect of the tube, and the degree of exhaustion,are quite different than when ordinary low frequency currents are used. As itwas found preferable to work with one terminal, the tube prepared was suspendedfrom the end of a wire connected to the terminal, the tinfoil coating beingconnected to the wire, and to the lower coating sometimes- a small insulatedplate was attached. When the thread was formed it extended through the upperpart of the tube and lost itself in the lower end. If it possessed rigidity itresembled, not exactly an elastic cord stretched tight between two supports, buta cord suspended from a height with a small weight attached at the end. When thefinger or a magnet was approached to the upper end of the luminous thread, itcould be brought locally out of position by electrostatic or magnetic action;and when the disturbing object was very quickly removed, an analogous result wasproduced, as though a suspended cord would be displaced and quickly releasednear the point of suspension. In doing this the luminous thread was set invibration, and two very sharply marked nodes, and a third indistinct one, wereformed. The vibration, once set up, continued for fully eight minutes, dyinggradually out. The speed of the vibration often varied perceptibly, and it couldbe observed that the electrostatic attraction of the glass affected thevibrating thread; but it was clear that the electrostatic action was not thecause of the vibration, for the thread was most generally stationary, and couldalways be set in vibration by passing the finger quickly near the upper part ofthe tube. With a magnet the thread could be split in two and both partsvibrated. By approaching the hand to the lower coating of the tube, or insulatedplate if attached, the vibration was quickened; also, as far as I could see, byraising the potential or frequency. Thus, either increasing the frequency orpassing a stronger discharge of the same frequency corresponded to a tighteningof the cord. I did not obtain any experimental evidence with condenserdischarges. A luminous band excited in a bulb by repeated discharges of a Leydenjar must possess rigidity, and if deformed and suddenly released should vibrate.But probably the amount of vibrating matter is so small that in spite of theextreme speed the inertia cannot prominently assert itself. Besides, theobservation in such a case is rendered extremely difficult on account of thefundamental vibration.The demonstration of the fact—which still needs better experimentalconfirmation—that a vibrating gaseous column possesses rigidity, might greatlymodify the views of thinkers. When with low frequencies and insignificantpotentials indications of that property may be noted, how must a gaseous mediumbehave under the influence of enormous electrostatic stresses which may beactive in the interstellar space, and which may alternate with inconceivablerapidity? The existence of such an electrostatic, rhythmically throbbingforce—of a vibrating electrostatic field-would show a possible way how solidsmight have formed from the ultra-gaseous uterus, and how transverse and allkinds of vibrations may be transmitted through a gaseous medium filling allspace. Then, ether might be a true fluid, devoid of rigidity, and at rest, itbeing merely necessary as a connecting link to enable interaction. Whatdetermines the rigidity of a body? It must be the speed and the amount of movingmatter. In a gas the speed may be considerable, but the density is exceedinglysmall; in a liquid the speed would be likely to be small, though the density maybe considerable ; and in both cases the inertia resistance offered todisplacement is practically nil. But place a gaseous (or liquid) column in anintense, rapidly alternating electrostatic field, set the particles vibratingwith enormous speeds, then the inertia resistance asserts itself. A body mightmove with more or less freedom through the vibrating mass, but as a whole itwould be rigid.There is a subject which I must mention in connection with these experiments: itis that of high vacua. This is a subject the study of which is not onlyinteresting, but useful, for it may lead to results of great practicalimportance. In commercial apparatus, such as incandescent lamps, operated fromordinary systems of distribution, a much higher vacuum than obtained at presentwould not secure a very great advantage. In such a case the work is performed onthe filament and the gas is little concerned; the improvement, therefore, wouldbe but trifling. But when we begin to use very high frequencies and potentials,the action of the gas becomes all important, and the degree of exhaustionmaterially modifies the results. As long as ordinary coils, even very largeones, were used, the study of the subject was limited, because just at a pointwhen it became most interesting it had to be interrupted on account of the\"non-striking\" vacuum being reached. But presently we are able to obtain from asmall, disruptive discharge coil potentials much higher than even the largestcoil was capable of giving, and, what is more, we can make the potentialalternate with great rapidity. Both of these results enable us now to pass aluminous discharge through almost any vacua obtainable, and the field of ourinvestigations is greatly extended. Think we as we may, of all the possibledirections to develop a practical illuminant, the line of high vacua seems to bethe most promising at present. But to reach extreme vacua the appliances must bemuch more improved, and ultimate perfection will not be attained until we shallhave discarded the mechanical and perfected an electrical vacuum pump. Moleculesand atoms can be thrown out of a bulb under the action of an enormous potential:this will be the principle of the vacuum pump of the future. For the present, wemust secure the best results we can with mechanical appliances. In this respect,it might not be out of the way to say a few words about the method of, andapparatus for, producing excessively high degrees of exhaustion of which I haveavailed myself m the course of these investigations. It is very probable thatother experimenters have used similar arrangements; but as it is possible thatthere may be an item or interest in their description, a few remarks, which willrender this investigation more complete, might be permitted.[../Images/main-53.png]FIG. 30.—APPARATUS USED FOR OBTAINING HIGH DEGREES OF EXHAUSTION.The apparatus is illustrated in a drawing shown in Fig 80. S represents aSprengel pump, which has been specially constructed to better suit the workrequired. The stop-cock which is usually employed has been omitted, and insteadof it a hollow stopper s has been fitted in the neck of the reservoir R. Thisstopper has a small hole h, through which the mercury descends; the size of theoutlet o being properly determined with respect to the section of the fall tubet, which is sealed to the reservoir instead of being connected to it in theusual manner. This arrangement overcomes the imperfections and troubles whichoften arise from the use of the stopcock on the reservoir and the connection ofthe latter with the fall tube.The pump is connected through a U-shaped tube to a very large reservoir R1.Especial care was taken in fitting the grinding surfaces of the stoppers p andp1 and both of these and the mercury caps above them were made exceptionallylong. After the U-shaped tube was fitted and put in place, it was heated, so asto soften and take off the strain resulting from imperfect fitting. The U-shapedtube was provided with a stopcock C, and two ground connections g and g1—one fora small bulb b, usually containing caustic potash, and the other for thereceiver r, to be exhausted.The reservoir R1 was connected by means of a rubber tube to a slightly largerreservoir R2, each of the two reservoirs being provided with a stopcock C1 andC2, respectively. The reservoir R2 could be raised and lowered by a wheel andrack, and the range of its motion was so determined that when it was filled withmercury and the stopcock C2 closed, so as to form a Torricellian vacuum in itwhen raised, it could be lifted so high that the mercury in reservoir R1 wouldstand a little above stopcock C1; and when this stopcock was closed and thereservoir R descended, so as to form a Torricellian vacuum in reservoir R1 itcould be lowered so far as to completely empty the latter, the mercury fillingthe reservoir R2 up to a little above stopcock C2.The capacity of the pump and of the connections was taken as small as possiblerelatively to the volume of reservoir, R1 since, of course, the degree ofexhaustion depended upon the ratio of these quantities.With this apparatus I combined the usual means indicated by former experimentsfor the production of very high vacua. In most of the experiments it wasconvenient to use caustic potash. I may venture to say, in regard to its use,that much time is saved and a more perfect action of the pump insured by fusingand boiling the potash as soon as, or even before, the pump settles down. Ifthis course is not followed the sticks, as ordinarily employed, may givemoisture off at a certain very slow rate, and the pump may work for many hourswithout reaching a very high vacuum. The potash was heated either by a spiritlamp or by passing a discharge through it, or by passing a current through awire contained in it. The advantage in the latter case was that the heatingcould be more rapidly repeated.Generally the process of exhaustion was the following:— At the start, thestop-cocks C and C1 being open, and all other connections closed, the reservoirR2 was raised so far that the mercury filled the reservoir R1 and a part of thenarrow connecting U-shaped tube. When the pump was set to work, the mercurywould, of course, quickly rise in the tube, and reservoir R2 was lowered, theexperimenter keeping the mercury at about the same level. The reservoir R1 wasbalanced by a long spring which facilitated the operation, and the friction ofthe parts was generally sufficient to keep it almost in any position. When theSprengel pump had done its work, the reservoir R2 was further lowered and themercury descended in R1 and filled R2, whereupon stopcock C2 was closed. The airadhering to the walls of R1 and that absorbed by the mercury was carried off,and to free the mercury of all air the reservoir R2 was for a long time workedup and down. During this process some air, which would gather below stopcock C2,was expelled from R2 by lowering it far enough and opening the stopcock, closingthe latter again before raising the reservoir. When all the air had beenexpelled from the mercury, and no air would gather in R2 when it was lowered,the caustic potash was resorted to. The reservoir R2 was now again raised untilthe mercury in R1 stood above stopcock C1. The caustic potash was fused andboiled, and the moisture partly carried off by the pump and partly re-absorbed;and this process of heating and cooling was repeated many times, and each time,upon the moisture being absorbed or carried off, the reservoir R2 was for a longtime raised and lowered. In this manner all the moisture was carried off fromthe mercury, and both the reservoirs were in proper condition to be used. Thereservoir R2 was then again raised to the top, and the pump was kept working fora long time. When the highest vacuum obtainable with the pump had been reachedthe potash bulb was usually wrapped with cotton which was sprinkled with etherso as to keep the potash at a very low temperature, then the reservoir R2 waslowered, and upon reservoir R1 being emptied the receiver r was quickly sealedup.When a new bulb was put on, the mercury was always raised above stopcock C1which was closed, so as to always keep the mercury and both the reservoirs infine condition, and the mercury was never withdrawn from R except when the pumphad reached the highest degree of exhaustion. It is necessary to observe thisrule if it is desired to use the apparatus to advantage.By means of this arrangement I was able to proceed very quickly, and when theapparatus was in perfect order it was possible to reach the phosphorescent stagein a small bulb in less than 15 minutes, which is certainly very quick work fora small laboratory arrangement requiring all in all about 100 pounds of mercury.With ordinary small bulbs the ratio of the capacity of the pump, receiver, andconnections, and that of reservoir R was about 1-20, and the degrees ofexhaustion reached were necessarily very high, though I am unable to make aprecise and reliable statement how far the exhaustion was carried.What impresses the investigator most in the course of these experiences is thebehavior of gases when subjected to great rapidly alternating electrostaticstresses. But he must remain in doubt as to whether the effects observed are duewholly to the molecules, or atoms, of the gas which chemical analysis disclosesto us, or whether there enters into play another medium of a gaseous nature,comprising atoms, or molecules, immersed in a fluid pervading the space. Such amedium surely must exist, and I am convinced that, for instance, even if airwere absent, the surface and neighborhood of a body in space would be heated byrapidly alternating the potential of the body; but no such heating of thesurface or neighborhood could occur if all free atoms were removed and only ahomogeneous, incompressible, and elastic fluid—such as ether is supposed tobe—would remain, for then there would be no impacts, no collisions. In such acase, as far as the body itself is concerned, only frictional losses in theinside could occur.It is a striking fact that the discharge through a gas is established with everincreasing freedom as the frequency of the impulses is augmented. It behaves inthis respect quite contrarily to a metallic conductor. In the latter theimpedance enters prominently into play as the frequency is increased, but thegas acts much as a series of condensers would: the facility with which thedischarge passes through seems to depend on the rate of change of potential. Ifit act so, then in a vacuum tube even of great length, and no matter how strongthe current, self-induction could not assert itself to any appreciable degree.We have, then, as far as we can now see, in the gas a conductor which is capableof transmitting electric impulses of any frequency which we may be able toproduce. Could the frequency be brought high enough, then a queer system ofelectric distribution, which would be likely to interest gas companies, might berealized : metal pipes filled with gas—the metal being the insulator, the gasthe conductor— supplying phosphorescent bulbs, or perhaps devices as yetuninvented. It is certainly Possible to take a hollow core of copper, rarefy thegas in the same, and by passing impulses of sufficiently high frequency througha circuit around it, bring the gas inside to a high degree of incandescence; butas to the nature of the forces there would be considerable uncertainty, for itwould be doubtful whether with such impulses the copper core would act as astatic screen. Such paradoxes and apparent impossibilities we encounter at everystep in this line of work, and therein lies, to a great extent, the charm of thestudy.I have here a short and wide tube which is exhausted to a high degree andcovered with a substantial coating of bronze, the coating allowing barely thelight to shine through. A metallic clasp, with a hook for suspending the tube,is fastened around the middle portion of the latter, the clasp being in contactwith the bronze coating. I now want to light the gas inside by suspending thetube on a wire connected to the coil. Any one who would try the experiment forthe first time, not having any previous experience, would probably take care tobe quite alone when making the trial, for fear that he might become the joke ofhis assistants. Still, the bulb lights in spite of the metal coating, and thelight can be distinctly perceived through the latter. A long tube covered withaluminium bronze lights when held in one hand—the other touching the terminal ofthe coil—quite powerfully. It might be objected that the coatings are notsufficiently conducting ; still, even if they were highly resistant, they oughtto screen the gas. They certainly screen it perfectly in a condition of rest,but not by far perfectly when the charge is surging in the coating. But the lossof energy which occurs within the tube, notwithstanding the screen, isoccasioned principally by the presence of the gas. Were to take a large hollowmetallic sphere and fill it with a feet incompressible fluid dielectric, therewould be no loss inside of the sphere, and consequently the inside might beconsidered as perfectly screened, though the potential be very rapidlyalternating. Even were the sphere filled with oil, the loss would beincomparably smaller than when the fluid is replaced by a gas, for in the lattercase the force produces displacements; that means impact and collisions in theinside.No matter what the pressure of the gas may be, it becomes an important factor inthe heating of a conductor when the electric density is great and the frequencyvery high. That in the heating of conductors by lightning discharges air is anelement of great importance, is almost as certain as an experimental fact. I mayillustrate the action of the air by the following experiment: I take a shorttube which is exhausted to a moderate degree and has a platinum wire runningthrough the middle from one end to the other. I pass a steady or low frequencycurrent through the wire, and it is heated uniformly in all parts. The heatinghere is due to conduction, or frictional losses, and the gas around the wirehas—as far as we can see—no function to perform. But now let me pass suddendischarges, or a high frequency current, through the wire. Again the wire isheated, this time principally on the ends and least in the middle portion; andif the frequency of the impulses, or the rate of change, is high enough, thewire might as well be cut in the middle as not, for practically the heating isdue to the rarefied gas. Here the bright only act as a conductor of no impedancediverting the current from the wire as the impedance of the latter is enormouslyincreased, and merely heating the ends of the wire by reason of their resistanceto the passage of the discharge. But it is not at all necessary that the gas inthe tube should be conducting; it might be at an extremely low pressure, stillthe ends of the wire would be heated—as, however, is ascertained byexperience—only the two ends would in such case not be electrically connectedthrough the gaseous medium. Now what with these frequencies and potentialsoccurs in an exhausted tube occurs in the lightning discharges at ordinarypressure. We only need remember one of the facts arrived at in the course ofthese investigations, namely, that to impulses of very high frequency the gas atordinary pressure behaves much in the same manner as though it were atmoderately low pressure. I think that in lightning discharges frequently wiresor conducting objects are volatilized merely because air is present, and that,were the conductor immersed in an insulating liquid, it would be safe, for thenthe energy would have to spend itself somewhere else. From the behavior of gasesto sudden impulses of high potential I am led to conclude that there can be nosurer way of diverting a lightning discharge than by affording it a passagethrough a volume of gas, if such a thing can be done in a practical manner.There are two more features upon which I think it necessary to dwell inconnection with these experiments—the \"radiant state\" and the \"non-strikingvacuum.\"Any one who has studied Crookes' work must have received the impression that the\"radiant state\" is a property of the gas inseparably connected with an extremelyhigh degree of exhaustion. But it should be remembered that the phenomenaobserved in an exhausted vessel are limited to the character and capacity of theapparatus which is made use of. I think that in a bulb a molecule, or atom, doesnot precisely move in a straight line because it meets no obstacle, but becausethe velocity imparted to it is sufficient to propel it in a sensibly straightline. The mean free path is one thing, but the velocity—the energy associatedwith the moving body—is another, and under ordinary circumstances I believe thatit is a mere question of potential or speed. A disruptive discharge coil, whenthe potential is pushed very far, excites phosphorescence and projects shadows,at comparatively low degrees of exhaustion. In a lightning discharge, mattermoves in straight lines at ordinary pressure when the mean free path isexceedingly small, and frequently images of wires or other metallic objects havebeen produced by the particles thrown off in straight lines.[../Images/main-54.png]FIG. 31. -BULB SHOWING RADIANT LIME STREAM AT LOW EXHAUSTION.I have prepared a bulb to illustrate by an experiment the correctness of theseassertions. In a globe L (Fig. 31, I have mounted upon a lamp filament a pieceof lime l. The lamp filament is connected with a wire which leads into the bulb,and the general construction of the latter is as indicated in Fig. 19, beforedescribed. The bulb being suspended from a wire connected to the terminal of thecoil, and the latter being set to work, the lime piece l and the projectingparts of the filament are bombarded. The degree of exhaustion is just such thatwith the potential the coil is capable of giving phosphorescence of the glass isproduced, but disappears as soon as the vacuum is impaired. The lime containingmoisture, and moisture being given off as soon as heating occurs, thephosphorescence lasts only for a few moments. When the lime has beensufficiently heated, enough moisture has been given off to impair materially thevacuum of the bulb. As the bombardment goes on, one point of the lime piece ismore heated than other points, and the result is that finally practically allthe discharge passes through that point which is intensely heated, and a whitestream of lime particles (Fig. 31) then breaks forth from that point. Thisstream is composed of \"radiant\" matter, yet the degree of exhaustion is low. Butthe particles move in straight lines because the velocity imparted to them isgreat, and this is due to three causes—to the great electric density, the hightemperature of the small point, and the fact that the particles of the lime areeasily torn and thrown off—far more easily than those of carbon. Withfrequencies such as we are able to obtain, the particles are bodily thrown offand projected to a considerable distance; but with sufficiently high frequenciesno such thing would occur: in such case only a stress would spread or avibration would be propagated through the bulb. It would be out of the questionto reach any such frequency on the assumption that the atoms move with the speedof light; but I believe that such a thing is impossible; for this an enormouspotential would be required. With potentials which we are able to obtain, evenwith a disruptive discharge coil, the speed must be quite insignificant.As to the \"non-striking vacuum,\" the point to be noted is that it can occur onlywith low frequency impulses, and it is necessitated by the impossibility ofcarrying off enough energy with such impulses in high vacuum since the few atomswhich are around the terminal upon coming in contact with the same are repelledand kept at a distance for a comparatively long period of time, and not enoughwork can be performed to render the effect perceptible to the eye. If thedifference of potential between the terminals is raised, the dielectric breaksdown. But with very high frequency impulses there is no necessity for suchbreaking down, since any amount of work can be performed by continuallyagitating the atoms in the exhausted vessel, provided the frequency is highenough. It is easy to reach— even with frequencies obtained from an alternatoras here used— a stage at which the discharge does not pass between twoelectrodes in a narrow tube, each of these being connected to one of theterminals of the coil, but it is difficult to reach a point at which a luminousdischarge would not occur around each electrode.A thought which naturally presents itself in connection with high frequencycurrents, is to make use of their powerful electro-dynamic inductive action toproduce light effects in a sealed glass globe. The leading-in wire is one of thedefects of the present incandescent lamp, and if DO other improvement were made,that imperfection at least should be done away with. Following this thought, Ihave carried on experiments in various directions, of which some were indicatedin my former paper. I may here mention one or two more lines of experiment whichhave been followed up. Many bulbs were constructed as shown in Fig. 32 and Fig.33.[../Images/main-55.jpg]FIG 32 - ELECTRO DYNAMIC INDUCTION COIL[../Images/main-56.jpg]FIG 33. - ELECTRO DYNAMIC INDUCTION LAMPIn Fig. 32 a wide tube T was sealed to a smaller W-shaped tube U, ofphosphorescent glass. In the tube T was placed a coil C of aluminium wire, theends of which were provided with small spheres t and t1 of aluminium, andreached into the U tube. The tube T was slipped into a socket containing aprimary coil through which usually the discharges of Leyden jars were directed,and the rarefied gas in the small 17 tube was excited to strong luminosity bythe high-tension currents induced in the coil C. When Leyden jar discharges wereused to induce currents in the coil C, it was found necessary to pack the tube Ttightly with insulating powder, as a discharge would occur frequently betweenthe turns of the coil, especially when the primary was thick and the air gap,through which the jars discharged, large, and no little trouble was experiencedin this way.In Fig. 33 is illustrated another form of the bulb constructed. In this case atube T is sealed to a globe L. The tube contains a coil C, the ends of whichpass through two small glass tubes t and t1, which are sealed to the tube T. Tworefractory buttons m and mx are mounted on lamp filaments which are fastened tothe ends of the wires passing through the glass tubes t and t1. Generally inbulbs made on this plan the globe L communicated with the tube T. For thispurpose the ends of the small tubes t and t1 were just a trifle heated in theburner, merely to hold the wires, but not to interfere with the communication.The tube T, with the small tubes, wires through the same, and the refractorybuttons m and m1 , was first prepared, and then sealed to globe L, whereupon thecoil C was slipped in and the connections made to its ends. The tube was thenpacked with insulating powder, jamming the latter as tight as possible up tovery nearly the end, then it was closed and only a small hole left through whichthe remainder of the powder was introduced, and finally the end of the tube wasclosed. Usually in bulbs constructed as shown in Fig. 33 an aluminium tube a wasfastened to the upper end s of each of the tubes t and t1, in order to protectthat end against the heat. The buttons m and m1 could be brought to any degreeof incandescence by passing the discharges of Leyden jars around the coil C. Insuch bulbs with two buttons a very curious effect is produced by the formationof the shadows of each of the two buttons.Another line of experiment, which has been assiduously followed, was to induceby electro-dynamic induction a current or luminous discharge in an exhaustedtube or bulb. This matter has received such able treatment at the hands of Prof.J. J. Thomson that I could add but little to what he has made known, even had Imade it the special subject of this lecture. Still, since experiences in thisline have gradually led me to the present views and results, a few words must bedevoted here to this subject.It has occurred, no doubt, to many that as a vacuum tube is made longer theelectromotive force per unit length of the tube, necessary to pass a luminousdischarge through the latter, gets continually smaller; therefore, if theexhausted tube be made long enough, even with low frequencies a luminousdischarge could be induced in such a tube closed upon itself. Such a tube mightbe placed around a hall or on a ceiling, and at once a simple appliance capableof giving considerable light would be obtained. But this would be an appliancehard to manufacture and extremely unmanageable. It would not do to make the tubeup of small lengths, because there would be with ordinary frequenciesconsiderable loss in the coatings, and besides, if coatings were used, it wouldbe better to supply the current directly to the tube by connecting the coatingsto a transformer. But even if all objections of such nature were removed, still,with low frequencies the light conversion itself would be inefficient, as I havebefore stated. In using extremely high frequencies the length of thesecondary—in other words, the size of the vessel—can be reduced as far asdesired, and the efficiency of the light conversion is increased, provided thatmeans are invented for efficiently obtaining such high frequencies. Thus one isled, from theoretical and practical considerations, to the use of highfrequencies, and this means high electromotive forces and small currents in theprimary. When he works with condenser charges—and they are the only means up tothe present known for reaching these extreme frequencies—he gets toelectromotive forces of several thousands of volts per turn of the primary. Hecannot multiply the electro-dynamic inductive effect by taking more turns in theprimary, for ho arrives at the conclusion that the best way is to work with onesingle turn—though he must sometimes depart from this rule—and he must get alongwith whatever inductive effect he can obtain with one turn. But before he haslong experimented with the extreme frequencies required to set up in a smallbulb an electromotive force of several thousands of volts he realizes the greatimportance of electrostatic effects, and these effects grow relatively to theelectro-dynamic in significance as the frequency is increased.Now, if anything is desirable in this case, it is to increase the frequency, andthis would make it still worse for the electro-dynamic effects. On the otherhand, it is easy to exalt the electrostatic action as far as one likes by takingmore turns on the secondary, or combining self-induction and capacity to raisethe potential. It should also be remembered that, in reducing the current to thesmallest value and increasing the potential, the electric impulses of highfrequency can be more easily transmitted through a conductor.These and similar thoughts determined me to devote more attention to theelectrostatic phenomena, and to endeavor to produce potentials as high aspossible, and alternating as fast as they could be made to alternate. I thenfound that I could excite vacuum tubes at considerable distance from a conductorconnected to a properly constructed coil, and that I could, by converting theoscillatory current of a condenser to a higher potential, establishelectrostatic alternating fields which acted through the whole extent of a room,lighting up a tube no matter where it was held in space. I thought I recognizedthat I had made a step in advance, and I have persevered in this line; but Iwish to say that I share with all lovers of science and progress the one andonly desire—to reach a result of utility to men in any direction to whichthought or experiment may lead me. I think that this departure is the right one,for I cannot see, from the observation of the phenomena which manifestthemselves as the frequency is increased, what there would remain to act betweentwo circuits conveying, for instance, impulses of several hundred millions persecond, except electrostatic forces. Even with such trifling frequencies theenergy would be practically all potential, and my conviction has grown strongthat, to whatever kind of motion light may be due, it is produced by tremendouselectrostatic stresses vibrating with extreme rapidity.Of all these phenomena observed with currents, or electric impulses, of highfrequency, the most fascinating for an audience are certainly those which arenoted in an electrostatic field acting through considerable distance, and thebest an unskilled lecturer can do is to begin and finish with the exhibition ofthese singular effects. I take a tube in the hand and move it about, and it islighted wherever I may hold it; throughout space the invisible forces act. But Imay take another tube and it might not light, the vacuum being very high. Iexcite it by means of a disruptive discharge coil, and now it will light in theelectrostatic field. I may put it away for a few weeks or months, still itretains the faculty of being excited. What change have I produced in the tube inthe act of exciting it? If a motion imparted to the atoms, it is difficult toperceive how it can persist so long without being arrested by frictional losses; and if a strain exerted in the dielectric, such as a simple electrificationwould produce, it is easy to see how it may persist indefinitely, but verydifficult to understand why such a condition should aid the excitation when wehave to deal with potentials which are rapidly alternating. Since I haveexhibited these phenomena for the first time, I have obtained some otherinteresting effects. For instance, I have produced the incandescence of abutton, filament, or wire enclosed in a tube. To get to this result it wasnecessary to economize the energy which is obtained from the field and directmost of it on the small body to be rendered incandescent. At the beginning thetask appeared difficult, but the experiences gathered permitted me to reach theresult easily. In Fig. 34 and Fig. 35 two such tubes are illustrated which areprepared for the occasion. In Fig. 34 a short tube T1, sealed to another longtube T, is provided with a stem s, with a platinum wire sealed in the latter. Avery thin lamp filament I is fastened to this wire, and connection to theoutside is made through a thin copper wire w. The tube is provided with outsideand inside coatings. C and d respectively, and is filled as far as the coatingsreach with conducting, and the space above with insulating powder. Thesecoatings are merely used to enable me to perform two experiments with the tube—namely, to produce the effect desired either by direct connection of the body ofthe experimenter or of another body to the wire w, or by acting inductivelythrough the glass. The stem a is provided with an aluminium tube a, for purposesbefore explained, and only a small part of the filament reaches out of thistube. By holding the tube T1 anywhere in the electrostatic field the filament isrendered incandescent.A more interesting piece of apparatus is illustrated in Fig. 35. Theconstruction is the same as before, only instead of the lamp filament a smallplatinum wire p, sealed in a stem s, and bent above it in a circle, is connectedto the copper wire to, which is joined to an inside coating C A small stem st isprovided with a needle, on the point of which is arranged to rotate very freelya very light fan of mica v. To prevent the fan from falling out, a thin stem ofglass g is bent properly and fastened to the aluminium tube. When the glass tubeis held anywhere in the electrostatic field the platinum wire becomesincandescent, and the mica vanes are rotated very fast.Intense phosphorescence may be excited in a bulb by merely connecting it to aplate within the field, and the plate need not be any larger than an ordinarylamp shade. The phosphorescence excited with these currents is incomparably morepowerful than with ordinary apparatus. A small phosphorescent bulb, whenattached to a wire connected to a coil, emits sufficient light to allow readingordinary print at a distance of five to six paces. It was of interest to see howsome of the phosphorescent bulbs of Professor Crookes would behave with thesecurrents, and he has had the kindness to lend me a few for the occasion. Theeffects produced are magnificent, especially by the sulphide of calcium andsulphide of zinc. From the disruptive discharge coil they glow intensely merelyby holding them in the hand and connecting the body to the terminal of the coil.To whatever results investigations of this kind may lead, their chief interestlies for the present in the possibilities they offer for the production of anefficient illuminating device. In no branch of electric industry is an advancemore desired than in the manufacture of light. Every thinker, when consideringthe barbarous methods employed, the deplorable losses incurred in our bestsystems of light production, must have asked himself, What is likely to be thelight of the future? Is it to be an incandescent solid, as in the present lamp,or an incandescent gas, or a phosphorescent body, or something like a burner,but incomparably more efficient?[../Images/main-57.jpg]FIG 34. - TUBE WITH FILAMENT RENDERED INCADESCENT IN AN ELECTROSTATIC FIELD[../Images/main-58.jpg]FIG. 35. - CROOKES’ EXPERIMENT IN ELECTROSTATIC FIELDThere is little chance to perfect a gas burner; not, perhaps, because humaningenuity has been bent upon that problem for centuries without a radicaldeparture having been made—though this argument is not devoid of force— butbecause in a burner the higher vibrations can never be reached except by passingthrough all the low ones. For how is a flame produced unless by a fall of liftedweights.? Such process cannot be maintained without renewal, and renewal isrepeated passing from low to high vibrations. One way only seems to be open toimprove a burner, and that by trying to reach higher degrees of incandescence.Higher incandescence is equivalent to a quicker vibration that means more lightfrom the same material, and that again, means more economy. In this directionsome improvements have been made, but the progress is hampered by manylimitations. Discarding, then, the burner, there remain the three ways firstmentioned, which are essentially electrical.Suppose the light of the immediate future to be a solid rendered incandescent byelectricity. Would it not seem that it is better to employ a small button than afrail filament? From many considerations it certainly must be concluded that abutton is capable of a higher economy, assuming, of course, the difficultiesconnected with the operation of such a lamp to be effectively overcome. But tolight such a lamp we require a high potential and to get this economically wemust use high frequencies.Such considerations apply even more to the production of light by theincandescence of a gas, or by phosphorescence. In all cases we require highfrequencies and high potentials. These thoughts occurred to me a long time ago.Incidentally we gain, by the use of very high frequencies, many advantages, suchas a higher economy in the light production, the possibility of working with onelead, the possibility of doing away with the leading-in wire, etc. The questionis, how far can we go with frequencies? Ordinary conductors rapidly lose thefacility of transmitting electric impulses when the frequency is greatlyincreased. Assume the means for the production of impulses of very greatfrequency brought to the utmost perfection, every one will naturally ask how totransmit them when the necessity arises. In transmitting such impulses throughconductors we must remember that we have to deal with pressure and flow, in theordinary interpretation of these terms. Let the pressure increase to an enormousvalue, and let the flow correspondingly diminish, then such impulses—variationsmerely of pressure, as it were—can no doubt be transmitted through a wire evenif their frequency be many hundreds of millions per second. It would, of course,be out of question to transmit such impulses through a wire immersed in agaseous medium, even if the wire were provided with a thick and excellentinsulation for most of the energy would be lost in molecular bombardment andconsequent heating. The end of the wire connected to the source would be heated,and the remote end would receive but a trifling part of the energy supplied. Theprime necessity, then, if such electric impulses are to be used, is to findmeans to reduce as much as possible the dissipation.The first thought is, employ the thinnest possible wire surrounded by thethickest practicable insulation. The next thought is to employ electrostaticscreens. The insulation of the wire may be covered with a thin conductingcoating and the latter connected to the ground. But this would not do, as thenall the energy would pass through the conducting coating to the ground andnothing would get to the end of the wire. If a ground connection is made it canonly be made through a conductor offering an enormous impedance, or though acondenser of extremely small capacity. This, however, does not do away withother difficulties.If the wave length of the impulses is much smaller than the length of the wire,then corresponding short waves will be sent up in the conducting coating, and itwill be more or less the same as though the coating were directly connected toearth. It is therefore necessary to cut up the coating in sections much shorterthan the wavelength. Such an arrangement does not still afford a perfect screen,but it is ten thousand times better than none. I think it preferable to cut upthe conducting coating in small sections, even if the current waves be muchlonger than the coating.If a wire were provided with a perfect electrostatic screen, it would be thesame as though all objects were removed from it at infinite distance. Thecapacity would then be reduced to the capacity of the wire itself, which wouldbe very small. It would then be possible to send over the wire currentvibrations of very high frequencies at enormous distance without affectinggreatly the character of the vibrations. A perfect screen is of course out ofthe question, but I believe that with a screen such as I have just describedtelephony could be rendered practicable across the Atlantic. According to myideas, the guttapercha covered wire should be provided with a third conductingcoating subdivided in sections. On the top of this should be again placed alayer of gutta-percha and other insulation, and on the top of the whole thearmor. But such cables will not be constructed, for ere longintelligence—transmitted without wires—will throb through the earth like a pulsethrough a living organism. The wonder is that, with the present state ofknowledge and the experiences gained, no attempt is being made to disturb theelectrostatic or magnetic condition of the earth, and transmit, if nothing else,intelligence.It has been my chief aim in presenting these results to point out phenomena orfeatures of novelty, and to advance ideas which I am hopeful will serve asstarting points of new departures. It has been my chief desire this evening toentertain you with some novel experiments. Your applause, so frequently andgenerously accorded, has told me that I have succeeded.In conclusion, let me thank you most heartily for your kindness and attention,and assure you that the honor I have had in addressing such a distinguishedaudience, the pleasure I have had in presenting these results to a gathering ofso many able men—and among them also some of those in whose work for many yearspast I have found enlightenment and constant pleasure—I shall never forget.CHAPTER 4MORE PATENTS (1889-1900)[../Images/main-59.png][../Images/main-60.jpg][../Images/main-61.jpg][../Images/main-62.jpg][../Images/main-63.jpg][../Images/main-64.jpg][../Images/main-65.jpg][../Images/main-66.jpg][../Images/main-67.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5TRANSMISSION OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY WITHOUT WIRES(Communicated to the Thirtieth Anniversary Number of the Electrical World andEngineer, March 5, 1904.)BY NIKOLA TESLA.It is impossible to resist your courteous request extended on an occasion ofsuch moment in the life of your journal. Your letter has vivified the memory ofour beginning friendship, of the first imperfect attempts and undeservedsuccesses, of kindnesses and misunderstandings. It has brought painfully to mymind the greatness of early expectations, the quick flight of time, and alas thesmallness of realizations. The following lines which, but for your initiative,might not have been given to the world for a long time yet, are an offering inthe friendly spirit of old, and my best wishes for y6ur future success accompanythem.Towards the close of 1898 a systematic research, carried on for a number ofyears with the object of perfecting a method of transmission of electricalenergy through the natural medium, led me to recognize three importantnecessities: First, to develop a transmitter of great power; second, to perfectmeans for individualizing and isolating the energy transmitted; and, third, toascertain the laws of propagation of currents through the earth and theatmosphere. Various reasons, not the least of which was the help proffered by myfriend Leonard E. Curtis and the Colorado Springs Electric Company, determinedme to select for my experimental investigations the large plateau, two thousandmeters above sea-level, in the vicinity of that delightful resort, which Ireached late in May, 1899. I had not been there but a few days when Icongratulated myself on the happy choice and I began the task, for which I hadlong trained myself, with a grateful sense and full of inspiring hope. Theperfect purity of the air, the unequaled beauty of the sky, the imposing sightof a high mountain range, the quiet and restfulness of the place—all aroundcontributed to make the conditions for scientific observation ideal. To this wasadded the exhilarating influence of a glorious climate and a singular sharpeningof the senses. In those regions the organs undergo perceptible physical changes.The eyes assume an extraordinary limpidity, improving vision; the ears dry outand become more susceptible to sound. Objects can be clearly distinguished thereat distances such that I prefer to have them told by someone else, and I haveheard—this I can venture to vouch for—the claps of thunder seven and eighthundred kilometers away. I might have done better still, had it not been tediousto wait for the sounds to arrive, in definite intervals, as heralded preciselyby an electrical indicating apparatus— nearly an hour before.[../Images/main-68.jpg]EXPERIMENTAL LABORATORY, COLORADO SPRINGS.In the middle of June, while preparations for other work were going on, Iarranged one of my receiving transformers with the view of determining in anovel manner, experimentally, the electric potential of the globe and studyingits periodic and casual fluctuations. This formed part of a plan carefullymapped out in advance. A highly sensitive, self-restorative device, controllinga recording instrument, was included in the secondary circuit, while the primarywas connected to the ground and an elevated terminal of adjustable capacity. Thevariations of potential gave rise to electric surgings in the primary; thesegenerated secondary currents, which in turn affected the sensitive device andrecorder in proportion to their intensity. The earth was found to be, literally,alive with electrical vibrations, and soon I was deeply absorbed in thisinteresting investigation. No better opportunities for such observations as Iintended to make could be found anywhere. Colorado is a country famous for thenatural displays of electric force. In that dry and rarefied atmosphere thesun's rays beat the objects with fierce intensity. I raised steam, to adangerous pressure, in barrels filled with concentrated salt solution, and thetin-foil coatings of some of my elevated terminals shriveled up in the fieryblaze. An experimental high-tension former, carelessly exposed to the rays ofthe setting sun, had most of its insulating compound melted out and was rendereduseless. Aided by the dryness and rarefaction of the air, the water evaporatesas in a boiler, and static electricity is developed in abundance. Lightningdischarges are, accordingly, very frequent and sometimes of inconceivableviolence. On one occasion approximately twelve thousand discharges occurred intwo hours, and all in a radius of certainly less than fifty kilometers from thelaboratory. Many of them resembled gigantic trees of fire with the trunks up ordown. I never saw fire balls, but as a compensation for my disappointment Isucceeded later in determining the mode of their formation and producing themartificially.[../Images/main-69.jpg][../Images/main-70.png]TESLA'S TOWER AT WARDENCLYFFE FOR SENDING MESSAGES ACROSS THE ATLANTIC ANDELECTRICITY INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AS IT APPEARED IN 1904.[../Images/main-71.jpg]THE LETTERHEAD FOR HIS STATIONARY, PROMISING \"TEN MILLION HORSEPOWER\" OF\"ELECTRICAL OSCILLATOR ACTIVITY.\"In the latter part of the same month I noticed several times that my instrumentswere affected stronger by discharges taking place at great distances than bythose near by. This puzzled me very much. What was the cause? A number ofobservations proved that it could not be due to the differences in the intensityof the individual discharges, and I readily ascertained that the phenomenon wasnot the result of a varying relation between the periods of my receivingcircuits and those of the terrestrial disturbances. One night, as I was walkinghome with an assistant, meditating over these experiences, I was suddenlystaggered by a thought. Years ago, when I wrote a chapter of my lecture beforethe Franklin Institute and the National Electric Light Association, it hadpresented itself to me, but I had dismissed it as absurd and impossible. Ibanished it again. Nevertheless, my instinct was aroused and somehow I felt thatI was nearing a great revelation.It was on the third of July—the date I shall never forget— when I obtained thefirst decisive experimental evidence of a truth of overwhelming importance forthe advancement of humanity. A dense mass of strongly charged clouds gathered inthe west and towards the evening a violent storm broke loose which, afterspending much of its fury in the mountains, was driven away with great velocityover the plains. Heavy and long persisting arcs formed almost in regular timeintervals. My observations were now greatly facilitated and rendered moreaccurate by the experiences already gained. I was able to handle my instrumentsquickly and I was prepared. The recording apparatus being properly adjusted, itsindications became fainter and fainter with the increasing distance of thestorm, until they ceased altogether. I was watching in eager expectation. Surelyenough, in a little while the indications again began, grew stronger andstronger and, after passing through a maximum, gradually decreased and ceasedonce more. Many times, in regularly recurring intervals, the same actions wererepeated until the storm which, as evident from simple computations, was movingwith nearly constant speed, had retreated to a distance of about three hundredkilometers. Nor did these strange actions stop then, but continued to manifestthemselves with undiminished force. Subsequently, similar observations were alsomade by my assistant, Mr. Fritz Lowenstein, and shortly afterward severaladmirable opportunities presented themselves which brought out, still moreforcibly, and unmistakably, the true nature of the wonderful phenomenon. Nodoubt whatever remained: I was observing stationary waves.As the source of disturbances moved away the receiving circuit came successivelyupon their nodes and loops. Impossible as it seemed, this planet, despite itsvast extent, behaved like a conductor of limited dimensions. The tremendoussignificance of this fact in the transmission of energy by my system had alreadybecome quite clear to me. Not only was it practicable to send telegraphicmessages to any distance without wires, as I recognized long ago, but also toimpress upon the entire globe the faint modulations of the human voice, far morestill, to transmit power, in unlimited amounts, to any terrestrial distance andalmost without any loss.[../Images/main-72.jpg]EXPERIMENTAL LABORATORY, COLORADO SPRINGS.With these stupendous possibilities in sight, with the experimental evidencebefore me that their realization was henceforth merely a question of expertknowledge, patience and skill, I attacked vigorously the development of mymagnifying transmitter, now, however, not so much with the original intention ofproducing one of great power, as with the object of learning how to constructthe best one. This is, essentially, a circuit of very high self-induction andsmall resistance which in its arrangement, mode of excitation and action, may besaid to be the diametrical opposite of a transmitting circuit typical oftelegraphy by Hertzian or electromagnetic radiations. It is difficult to form anadequate idea of the marvelous power of this unique appliance, by the aid ofwhich the globe will be transformed. The electromagnetic radiations beingreduced to an insignificant quantity, and proper conditions of resonancemaintained, the circuit acts like an immense pendulum, storing indefinitely theenergy of the primary exciting impulses and impressions upon the earth and itsconducting atmosphere uniform harmonic oscillations of intensities which, asactual tests have shown, may be pushed so far as to surpass those attained inthe natural displays of static electricity.Simultaneously with these endeavors, the means of individualization andisolation were gradually improved. Great importance was attached to this, for itwas found that simple tuning was not sufficient to meet the vigorous practicalrequirements. The fundamental idea of employing a number of distinctiveelements, cooperatively associated, for the purpose of isolating energytransmitted, I trace directly to my perusal of Spencer's clear and suggestiveexposition of the human nerve mechanism. The influence of this principle on thetransmission of intelligence, and electrical energy in general, cannot as yet beestimated, for the art is still in the embryonic stage; but many thousands ofsimultaneous telegraphic and telephonic messages, through one single conductingchannel, natural or artificial, and without serious mutual interference, arecertainly practicable, while millions are possible. On the other hand, anydesired degree of individualization may be secured by the use of a great numberof co-operative elements and arbitrary variation of their distinctive featuresand order of succession. For obvious reasons, the principle will also bevaluable in the extension of the distance of transmission.Progress though of necessity slow was steady and sure, for the objects aimed atwere in a direction of my constant study and exercise. It is, therefore, notastonishing that before the end of 1899 I completed the task undertaken andreached the results which I have announced in my article in the Century Magazineof June, 1900, every word of which was carefully weighed.Much has already been done towards making my system commercially available, inthe transmission of energy in small amounts for specific purposes, as well as onan industrial scale. The results attained by me have made my scheme ofintelligence transmission, for which the name of \"World Telegraphy\" has beensuggested, easily realizable. It constitutes, I believe, in its principle ofoperation, means employed and capacities of application, a radical and fruitfuldeparture from what has been done heretofore. I have no doubt that it will provevery efficient in enlightening the masses, particularly in still uncivilizedcountries and less accessible regions, and that it will add materially togeneral safety, comfort and convenience, and maintenance of peaceful relations.It involves the employment of a number of plants, all of which are capable oftransmitting individualized signals to the uttermost confines of the earth. Eachof them will be preferably located near some important center of civilizationand the news it receives through any channel will be flashed to all points ofthe globe. A cheap and simple device, which might be carried in one's pocket,may then be set up somewhere on sea or land, and it will record the world's newsor such special messages as may be intended for it. Thus the entire earth willbe converted into a huge brain, as it were, capable of response in every one ofits parts. Since a single plant of but one hundred horse-power can operatehundreds of millions of instruments, the system will have a virtually infiniteworking capacity, and it must needs immensely facilitate and cheapen thetransmission of intelligence.The first of these central plants would have been already completed had it notbeen for unforeseen delays which, fortunately, have nothing to do with itspurely technical features. But this loss of time, while vexatious, may, afterall, prove to be a blessing in disguise. The best design of which I know hasbeen adopted, and the transmitter will emit a wave complex of a total maximumactivity of ten million horse-power, one per cent, of which is amply sufficientto \"girdle the globe.\" This enormous rate of energy delivery, approximatelytwice that of the combined falls of Niagara, is obtainable only by the use ofcertain artifices, which I shall make known in due course.For a large part of the work which I have done so far I am indebted to the noblegenerosity of Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan, which was all the more welcome andstimulating, as it was extended at a time when those, who have since promisedmost, were the greatest of doubters. I have also to thank my friend, StanfordWhite, for much unselfish and valuable assistance. This work is now faradvanced, and though the results may be tardy, they are sure to come.Meanwhile, the transmission of energy on an industrial scale is not beingneglected. The Canathan Niagara Power Company have offered me a splendidinducement, and next to achieving success for the sake of the art, it will giveme the greatest satisfaction to make their concession financially profitable tothem. In this first power plant, which I have been designing for a long time, Ipropose to distribute ten thousand horse-power under a tension of one hundredmillion volts, which I am now able to produce and handle with safety.[../Images/main-73.jpg]TESLA’S PERFECTED SYSTEM OF WIRELESS TRANSMISSION WITH FOUR TUNED CIRCUITS WASDESCRIBED IN U.S. PATENT NUMBERS 645,576 (MARCH 20, 1900) AND 649621 (MAY 15,1900).

One of its chief uses willbe the illumination of isolated homes. It takes very little power to light adwelling with vacuum tubes operated by high-frequency currents and in eachinstance a terminal a little above the roof will be sufficient. Another valuableapplication will be the driving of clocks and other such apparatus. These clockswill be exceedingly simple, will require absolutely no attention and willindicate rigorously correct time. The idea of impressing upon the earth Americantime is fascinating and very likely to become popular. There are innumerabledevices of all kinds which are either now employed or can be supplied, and byoperating them in this manner I may be able to offer a great convenience to thewhole world with a plant of no more than ten thousand horsepower. Theintroduction of this system will give opportunities for invention andmanufacture such as have never presented themselves before.Knowing the far-reaching importance of this first attempt and its effect uponfuture development, I shall proceed slowly and carefully. Experience has taughtme not to assign a term to enterprises the consummation of which is not whollydependent on my own abilities and exertions. But I am hopeful that these greatrealizations are not far off, and I know that when this first work is completedthey will follow with mathematical certitude.When the great truth accidentally revealed and experimentally confirmed is fullyrecognized, that this planet, with all its appalling immensity, is to electriccurrents virtually no more than a small metal ball and that by this fact manypossibilities, each baffling imagination and of incalculable consequence, arerendered absolutely sure of accomplishment; when the first plant is inauguratedand it is shown that a telegraphic message, almost as secret andnon-interferable as a thought, can be transmitted to any terrestrial distance,the sound of the human voice, with all its intonations and inflections,faithfully and instantly reproduced at any other point of the globe, the energyof a waterfall made available for supplying light, heat or motive power,anywhere—on sea, or land, or high in the air—humanity will be like an ant heapstirred up with a stick: See the excitement coming![../Images/main-77.jpg]THE ORIGINAL 1904 CAPTION TO THIS PHOTO READ: TESLA CENTRAL POWER PLANT,TRANSMITTING TOWER, AND LABORATORY FOR \"WORLD TELEGRAPHY,” WARDENCLYFFE, LONGISLAND.[../Images/main-78.jpg]IN A 1929 ARTICLE ON \"WORLD-WIDE TRANSMISSION OF ELECTRICAL SIGNALS, TESLAEXPLAINED HIS THEORY TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

In his lateryears, after the Wardencliff Tower project had been stopped by J.P. Morgan anddismantled under F.B.I. supervision, Tesla made little money from his projectsand in many cases did not even bother to seek patents. He was more interested inpublicity and became a favorite with newspaper reporters for his flamboyantdemonstrations, controversial predictions and incredible new inventions.On July 11, 1934, the New York Times ran a story which was headlined:TESLA AT 78 BARES NEW \"DEATH-BEAM,\"Invention Powerful Enough to Destroy 10,000 Planes 250 Miles Away,He Asserts.DEFENSIVE WEAPON ONLY.Scientist, in Interview, Tells of Apparatus That He Says Will Kill WithoutTrace.Tesla's death ray device was a kind of radio-wave-scalar weapon or what might becalled an ultra-sound gun. Tesla and death ray made quite a media splash at thetime. In the 1930's several Death Ray weapon films came out, including The DeathRay (1938) with Boris Karloff, and such serials as Flash Gordon and Radar MenFrom the Moon.In fact, the very first of the Max Fletcher Superman cartoons of the 1940'sfeatured Tesla in The Mad Scientist (Sept 1941) in which a crazed, eccentricscientist, obviously patterned after Tesla, battles Superman while he terrorizesNew York with his \"electrothenasia death ray.\" In the next cartoon, TheMechanical Monsters (Nov. 1941) Superman again battles Tesla, the mad scientistwho this time unleashes an army of robots on Manhattan. Superman battle Teslaand his Death Ray one last time in Magnetic Telescope (April 1942), where Teslais using a special magnetogravitic ray that pulls asteroids out of orbit andsends them crashing to earth. With Japateurs in September of 1942, the Supermancartoons turned toward War themes, featuring Japanese spies and to a lesserpart, Nazi agents.It is interesting to think of Tesla as the model for all the \"mad scientists\" ofcomic book and cinematic fiction.In the Spring of 1924 \"death rays,\" were the subject of many newspapers aroundthe world. Harry Grindell-Matthews of London lead the contenders in this earlyStar Wars race. The New York Times of May 21st had this report-Paris, May 20—Ifconfidence of Grindell Madiew (sic), inventor of the so-called 'diabolical ray,'in his discovery is justified it may become possible to put the whole of anenemy army out of action, destroy any force of airplanes attacking a city orparalyze any fleet venturing within a certain distance of the coast by invisiblerays.Grindell-Matthews stated mat his destructive rays would operate over a distanceof four miles and that the maximum distance for this type of weapon would beseven or eight miles. Tests have been reported where the ray has been used tostop the operation of automobiles by arresting the action of the magnetos, andan quantity of gunpowder is said to have been exploded by playing the beams onit from a distance of thirty six feet\" Grindell-Matthews was able, also, toelectrocute mice, shrivel plants, and light the wick of an oil lamp from thesame distance away.Sensing something of importance the New York Times copyrighted a story on May28th of 1924 on a ray-weapon developed by the Soviets. The story opened:\"News has leaked out from the Communist circles in Moscow that behind Trotsky'srecent war-like utterance lies an electromagnetic invention, by a Russianengineer named Grammachikoff for destroying airplanes.Tests of the destructive ray, the Times continued, had began the previous Augustwith the aid of German technical experts.A large, scale demonstration at Podosinsky Aerodrome near Moscow was sosuccessful that the revolutionary Military Council and the Political Bureaudecided to fund enough electronic anti-aircraft stations to protect sensitiveareas of Russia. Similar, but more powerful, stations were to be constructed todisable the electrical mechanisms of warships.The Commander of the Soviet Air Services, Rosenholtz, was so overwhelmed by theray weapon demonstration that he proposed \"to curtail the activity of the airfleet, because the invention rendered a large air fleet unnecessary for thepurpose of defense.\"Tesla appears to have been the renegade scientist, eccentric and brilliant.However, after his finances had been destroyed by Morgan, and indirectly byWestinghouse, Tesla was constantly broke. In lieu of money on rent, in the early1930's, Tesla gave the management of the Governor Clinton Hotel a supposedinvention of his to be used for collateral. He said that the device was verydangerous and worth $10,000. In 1943, an MIT scientist, working for the NationalDefense Research Committee (NDRC) and accompanied by the office of NavalIntelligence, John O. Trump, went to the hotel to retrieve the device, afterTesla's death.He was told that the invention could \"detonate if opened by an unauthorizedperson.\" Trump stated that he reflected momentarily upon his life before heopened the container. In his FBI report he stated\"Inside was a handsome wooden chest bound with brass... [containing] amultidecade resistance box of the type used for a Wheatstone bridge resistancemeasurements—a common standard item found in every electric laboratory beforethe turn of the century!\"According to Tesla researcher Dr. Marc Seifer, Tesla appears to have told bothhis pigeon caretaker and an army engineer named Fitzgerald, a friend of Tesla's,that he had built a working model of a Death Ray. Dr. Seifer says that a numberof people closely associated with Tesla would recount stories, circa 1918, ofTesla bouncing electronic beams off the moon. Seifer says that this is not aDeath Ray, but it certainly supports the hypothesis that the inventor createdworking models along those lines.According to Dr. Seifer, Tesla drew up \"artist conceptions\" in the mid-1930sthat were \"made of a building with a tower in the form of a cylinder 16.5 feetin diameter, 115 feet tall. The structure was capped at the top by a 10 meterdiameter sphere (covered with hemispheric shells as in the 1914 patent).\"Theinventor had also contacted people at Alcoa Aluminum throughout 1935 who were\"ready to start as soon as Tesla advanced the funds.\"Two years later, at the 81, the inventor stated at a luncheon attended byministers of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia that he had constructed a number ofbeam transmission devices including the death ray for protecting a country fromincoming invasions and a laser-like machine that could send impulses to the moonand other planets.According to Dr. Seifer, Tesla also said that he was going to take the death rayto a Geneva conference for world peace.; When pressed by the columnists to \"givea full description..., Dr. Tesla said..., \"But it is not an experiment... I havebuilt, demonstrated and used it Only a little time will pass before I can giveit to the world.\"Another Tesla scholar who believes that Tesla built a \"death ray\" is OliverNichelson, who has written quite a bit on Tesla, including an article entitled\"Nicola Tesla's Long Range Weapon\" (1989).Picking up the death ray stories on the wire services on the other side of theworld, the Colorado Springs Gazette, ran a local interest item on May 30th. Withthe headline: Tesla Discovered 'Death Ray' in Experiments He Made Here,\" thestory recounted, with a feeling of local pride, the inventor's 1899 researchesfinanced by John Jacob Astor.Tesla's Colorado Springs tests were well remembered by local residents. With a200 foot pole topped by a large copper sphere rising above his laboratory hegenerated potentials that discharged lightning bolts up to 135 feet long.Thunder from the released energy could be heard 15 miles away in Cripple CreekPeople walking along the streets were amazed to see sparks jumping between theirfeet and the ground, and flames of electricity would spring from a tap whenanyone turned them on for a drink of water. Light bulbs within 100 feet of theexperimental tower glowed when they were turned off. Horses at the livery stablereceived shocks through their metal shoes and bolted from the stalls. Eveninsects were affected: Butterflies became electrified and \"helplessly swirled incircles—their wings spouting blue halos of 'St. Elmo's Fire.'\"The most pronounced effect, and the one that captured the attention o death rayinventors, occurred at the Colorado Springs Electric Company generating station.One day while Tesla was conducting a high power test, the crackling from insidethe laboratory suddenly stopped. Bursting into the lab Tesla demanded to knowwhy his assistant had disconnected the coil. The assistant protested that hadnot anything. The power from the city's generator, the assistant said, must havequit When the angry Tesla telephoned the power company he received an equallyangry reply that the electric company had not cut the power, but that Tesla'sexperiment had destroyed the generator!According to Oliver Nichelson, Tesla explained to The Electrical Experimenter,in August of 19l7 what had happened. While running his transmitter at a powerlevel of \"several hundred kilowatts\" high frequency currents were set up in theelectric company's generators. These powerful currents \"caused heavy sparks tojump thru the winds and destroy the insulation.\" When the insulation failed, thegenerator shorted out and was destroyed.Some years later, 1935, he elaborated on the destructive potential of histransmitter in the February issue of Liberty magazine:\"My invention requires a large plant, but once it is established it will bepossible to destroy anything, men or machines, approaching within a radius of200 miles.\"He went on to make a distinction between his invention and those brought forwardby others. He claimed that his device did not use any so-called \"death rays\"because such radiation cannot be produced in large amounts and rapidly becomesweaker over distance. Here, he likely had in mind a Grindell-Matthews type ofdevice which, according to contemporary reports, used a powerful ultravioletbeam to make the air conducting so that high energy current could be directed tothe target The range of an ultra-violet searchlight would be much less than whatTesla was claiming. As he put it: \"all the energy of New York City(approximately two million horsepower [1.5 billion watts]) transformed into raysand projected twenty miles, would not kill a human being.\" On the contrary, hesaid:\"My apparatus projects particles which may be relatively large or of microscopicdimensions, enabling us to convey to a small area at a great distance trillionsof times more energy than is possible with rays of any kind. Many thousands ofhorsepower can be thus transmitted by a stream thinner than a hair, so thatnothing can resist.\"According to Oliver Nichelson, what Tesla had in mind with this defensive systemwas a large scale version of his Colorado Springs lightning bolt machine Asairplanes or ships entered the electric field of his charged tower, they wouldset up a conducting path for a stream of high energy particles that woulddestroy the intruder's electrical system.A drawback to having giant Tesla transmitters poised to shoot bolts of lightningat an enemy approaching the coasts is that they would have to be located in anuninhabited area equal to its circle of protection. Anyone stepping into thedefensive zone of the coils would be sensed as an intruder and struck down.Today, with the development of oil drilling platforms, this disadvantage mightbe overcome by locating the lightning defensive system at sea.As ominous as death ray and beam weapon technology will be for the future thereis another, more destructive, weapon system alluded to in Tesla's writings.According to Oliver Nichelson, when Tesla realized, as he pointed out in the1900 Century article, The Problem of Increasing Human Energy,\" that economicforces would not allow the development of a new type of electrical generatorable to supply power without burning fuel he \"was led to recognize [that] thetransmission of electrical energy to any distance through the media as by farthe best solution of the great problem of harnessing the sun's energy for theuse of man.'' His idea was that a relatively few generating plants located nearwaterfalls would supply his very high energy transmitters which, in turn, wouldsend power through the earth to be picked up wherever it was needed. The planwould require several of his transmitters to rhythmically pump huge amounts ofelectricity into the earth at pressures on the order of 100 million volts. Theearth would become like a huge ball inflated to a great electrical potential,but pulsing to Tesla's imposed beat.Receiving energy from this high pressure reservoir only would require a personto put a rod into the ground and connect it to a receiver operating in unisonwith the earth's electrical motion. As Tesla described it, \"the entire apparatusfor lighting the average country dwelling will contain no moving parts whatever,and could be readily carried about in a small valise.\"However, the difference between a current that can be used to run, say, a sewingmachine and a current used as a method of destruction, however, is a matter oftiming. If the amount of electricity used to run a sewing machine for an hour isreleased in a millionth of a second, it would have a very different, andnegative, effect on the sewing machine.Tesla said his transmitter could produce 100 million volts of pressure withcurrents up to 1000 amperes which is a power level of 100 billion watts. If itwas resonating at a radio frequency of 2 MHz, then the energy released duringone period of its oscillation would be 100,000,000,000,000,000 Joules of energy,or roughly the amount of energy released by the explosion of 10 megatons of TNT.Such a transmitter, would be capable of projecting the energy of a nuclearwarhead by radio. Any location in the world could be vaporized at the speed oflight.Not unexpectedly, many scientists doubted the technical feasibility of Tesla'swireless power transmission scheme whether for commercial or military purposes.The secret of how through- the-earth broadcast power was found not in thetheories of electrical engineering, but in the realm of high energy physics.Dr. Andrija Puharich, in 1976, was the first to point out that Tesla's powertransmission system could not be explained by the laws of classicalelectrodynamics, but, rather, in terms of relativistic transformations in highenergy fields. He noted that according to Dirac's theory of the electron, whenone of those particles encountered its oppositely charged member, a positron,the two particles would annihilate each other. Because energy can neither bedestroyed nor created the energy of the two former particles are transformedinto an electromagnetic wave. The opposite, of course, holds true. If there is astrong enough electric field, two opposite charges of electricity are formedwhere there was originally no charge at all. This type of transformation usuallytakes place near the intense field near an atomic nucleus, but it can alsomanifest without the aid of a nuclear catalyst if an electric field has enoughenergy. Puharich's involved mathematical treatment demonstrated that powerlevels in a Tesla transmitter were strong enough to cause such pair production.The mechanism of pair production offers a very attractive explanation for theground transmission of power. Ordinary electrical currents do not travel farthrough the earth. Dirt has a high resistance to electricity and quickly turnscurrents into heat energy that is wasted. With the pair production methodelectricity can be moved from one point to another without really having to pushthe physical particle through the earth - the transmitting source would create astrong field, and a particle would be created at the receiver.If the sending of currents through the earth is possible from the viewpoint ofmodern physics, the question remains of whether Tesla actually demonstrated theweapons application of his power transmitter or whether it remained anunrealized plan on the part of the inventor. Circumstantial evidence points tothere having been a test of this weapon.The clues are found in the chronology of Tesla's work and financial fortunesbetween 1900 and 1915.1900: Tesla returned from Colorado Springs after a series of important tests ofwireless power transmission. It was during these tests that his magnifyingtransmitter sent out waves of energy causing the destruction of the powercompany's generator.He received financial backing from J.Pierpont Morgan of $150,000 to build aradio transmitter for signaling Europe. With the first portion of the money heobtained 200 acres of land at Shoreham, Long Island and built an enormous tower187 feet tall topped with a 55 ton, 68 foot metal dome. He called the researchsite \"Wardenclyffe.\"As Tesla was just getting started, investors were rushing to buy stock offeredby the Marconi company. Supporters of the Marconi Company include his oldadversary Edison.On December 12th, Marconi sent the first transatlantic signal, the letter \"S\"from Cornwall, England to Newfoundland. He did this with, as the financiersnoted, equipment much less costly than that envisioned by Tesla.1902: Marconi is being hailed as a hero around the world while Tesla is seen asa shirker by the public for ignoring a call to jury duty in a murder case (hewas excused from duty because of his opposition to the death penalty).1903: When Morgan sent the balance of the $150,000, it would not cover theoutstanding balance Tesla owed on the Wardenclyffe construction. To encourage alarger investment in the face of Marconi's success, Tesla revealed to Morgan hisreal purpose was not to just send radio signals but the wireless transmission ofpower to any point on the planet. Morgan was uninterested and declined furtherfunding.A financial panic that Fall put an end to Tesla's hopes of financing by Morganor other wealthy industrialists. This left Tesla without money even to buy thecoal to fire the transmitter's electrical generators.1904: Tesla writes for the Electrical World, The Transmission of ElectricalEnergy Without Wires,'' noting that the globe, even with its great size,responds to electrical currents like a small metal ball.Tesla declares to the press the completion of Wardenclyffe.1904: The Colorado Springs power company sues for electricity used at thatexperimental station. Tesla's Colorado laboratory is torn down and is sold forlumber to pay the $180 judgment; his electrical equipment is put in storage.1905: Electrotherapeutic coils are manufactured at Wardenclyffe, for hospitalsand researchers to help pay bills.Tesla is sued by his lawyer for nonpayment of a loan. In an article, Teslacomments on Peary's expedition to the North Pole and tells of his, Tesla's,plans for energy transmission to any central point on the ground.Tesla is sued by C.J. Duffner, a caretaker at the experimental station inColorado Springs, for wages.1906: \"Left Property Here; Skips; Sheriffs Sale,\" was the headline in theColorado Springs Gazette for March 6di. Tesla's electrical equipment is sold topay judgment of $928.57.George Westinghouse, who bought Tesla's patents for alternating current motorsand generators in the 1880's, turns down the inventor's power transmissionproposal.Workers gradually stop coming to the Wardenclyffe laboratory when there are nofunds to pay them.1907: When commenting on the destruction of the French ship Iena, Tesla noted ina letter to the New York Times that he has built and tested remotely controlledtorpedoes, but that electrical waves would be more destructive. \"As toprojecting wave energy to any particular region of the globe... this can be doneby my devices,\" he wrote. Further, he claimed that \"the spot at which thedesired effect is to be produced can be calculated very closely, assuming theaccepted terrestrial measurements to be correct.\"1908: Tesla repeated the idea of destruction by electrical waves to thenewspaper on April 21st His letter to the editor stated, \"When I spoke of futurewarfare I meant that it should be conducted by direct application of electricalwaves without the use of aerial engines or other implements of destruction.\" Headded: This is not a dream. Even now wireless power plants could be constructedby which any region of the globe might be rendered uninhabitable withoutsubjecting the population of other parts to serious danger or inconvenience.\"1915: Again, in another letter to the editor, Tesla stated: \"It is perfectlypractical to transmit electrical energy without wires and produce destructiveeffects at a distance. I have already constructed a wireless transmitter whichmakes this possible... When unavoidable, the [transmitter] may be used todestroy property and life.\"Important to this chronology is the state of Tesla's mental health. Oneresearcher, Marc J. Seifer, a psychologist, believes Tesla suffered a nervousbreakdown catalyzed by the death of one the partners in the Tesla ElectricCompany and the shooting of Stanford White, the noted architect, who haddesigned Wardenclyffe. Seifer places this in 1906 and cites as evidence a letterfrom George Scherff, Tesla's secretary:Wardenclyffe, 4/10/1906 Dear Mr. Tesla:I have received your letter and am very glad to know you are vanquishing yourillness. I have scarcely ever seen you so out of sorts as last Sunday; and I wasfrightened.In the period from 1900 to 1910 Tesla's creative thrust was to establish hisPlan for wireless transmission of energy. Undercut by Marconi's accomplishment,beset by financial problems, and spurned by the scientific establishment Teslawas in a desperate situation by mid-decade. The strain became too great by 1906and he suffered an emotional collapse. In order to make a final effort to havehis grand scheme recognized, he may have tried one high power test of histransmitter to show off its destructive potential. This would have been in 1908.The Tunguska event took place on the morning of June 30th, 1908. An explosionestimated to be equivalent to 10-15 megatons of TNT flattened 500,000 acres ofpine forest near the Stony Tunguska River in central Siberia, Whole herds ofreindeer were destroyed. The explosion was heard over a radius of 620 miles.When an expedition was made to the area in 1927 to find evidence of themeteorite presumed to have caused the blast, no impact crater was found When theground was drilled for pieces of nickel, iron, or stone, the main constituentsof meteorites, none were found down to a depth of 118 feet.Many explanations have been given for the Tunguska event The officially acceptedversion is that a 100,000 ton fragment of Encke's Comet, composed mainly of dustand ice, entered the atmosphere at 62,000 m.p.h., heated up, and exploded overthe earth's surface creating a fireball and shock wave but no crater.Alternative versions of the disaster see a renegade mini-black hole or an alienspace ship crashing into the earth with the resulting release of energy.According to Oliver Nichelson, the historical facts point to the possibilitythat this event was caused by a test firing of Tesla's energy weapon.In 1907 and 1908, Tesla wrote about the destructive effects of his energytransmitter. His Wardenclyffe transmitter was much larger than the ColoradoSprings device that destroyed the power station's generator. His new transmitterwould be capable of effects many orders of magnitude greater than the Coloradodevice.In 1915, he said he had already built a transmitter that \"when unavoidable ...may be used to destroy property and life.\" Finally, a 1934 letter from Tesla toJ.P. Morgan, uncovered by Tesla biographer Margaret Cheney, seems toconclusively point to an energy weapon test In an effort to raise money for hisdefensive system he wrote:The flying machine has completely demoralized the world, so much so that in somecities, as London and Paris, people are in mortal fear from aerial bombing. Thenew means I have perfected affords absolute protection against this and otherforms of attack... These new discoveries I have carried out experimentally on alimited scale, created a profound impression (emphasis added).Again, the evidence is circumstantial but, to use the language of criminalinvestigation, Tesla had motive and means to be the cause of the Tunguska eventHe also seems to confess to such a test having taken place before 1915. Histransmitter could generate energy levels and frequencies that would release thedestructive force of 10 megatons, or more, of TNT. And the overlooked genius wasdesperate.The nature of the Tunguska event, also, is not inconsistent with what wouldhappen during the sudden release of wireless power. No fiery object was reportedin the skies at that time by professional or amateur astronomers as would beexpected when a 200,000,000 pound object enters the atmosphere. The sky glow inthe region, mentioned by some witnesses, just before the explosion may have comefrom the ground, as geological researchers discovered in the 1970's. Just beforean earthquake the stressed rock beneath the ground creates an electrical effectcausing the air to illuminate.According to Oliver Nichelson, if the explosion was caused by wireless energytransmission, either the geological stressing or the current itself would causean air glow. Finally, there is the absence of an impact crater. Because there isno material object to impact, an explosion caused by broadcast power would notleave a crater.Given Tesla's general pacifistic nature it is hard to understand why he wouldcarry out a test harmful to both animals and the people who herded the animalseven when he was in the grip of financial desperation. The answer is that heprobably intended no harm, but was aiming for a publicity coup and, literally,missed his target.At the end of 1908, the whole world was following the daring attempt of Peary toreach the North Pole. Peary claimed the Pole in the Spring of 1909, but thewinter before he had returned to the base at Ellesmere Island, about 700 milesfrom the Pole. If Tesla wanted the attention of the international press, fewthings would have been more impressive than the Peary expedition sending outWord of a cataclysmic explosion on the ice in the direction of the North Pole.Tesla, then, if he could not be hailed as the master creator that he was, couldbe seen as the master of a mysterious new force of destruction.The test, it seems, was not a complete success, says Nichelson. It must havebeen difficult controlling the vast amount of power in transmitter and guiding ^to the exact spot Tesla wanted. Alert, Canada on Ellesmere Island and theTunguska region are all on the same great circle line from Shoreham, LongIsland. Both are on a compass bearing of a little more than 2 degrees along aPolar path. The destructive electrical wave overshot its target.Whoever was privy to Tesla's energy weapon demonstration must have been dismayedeither because it missed the intended target and would be a threat t inhabitedregions of the planet, or because it worked too well in devastating such, alarge area at the mere throwing of a switch thousands of miles away. Whichevewas the case, Tesla never received the notoriety he sought for his powertransmitter.In 1915, the Wardenclyffe laboratory was deeded over to Waldorf- Astoria. Inc.in lieu of payment for Tesla's hotel bills. In 1917, Wardenclyffe was dynamitedon orders of the new owners to recover some money from the scran OliverNichelson's exotic theory may be pure fantasy, or perhaps, Nikola Tesla didshake the world in a way that has been kept secret for over 80 yearsToday, Stars Wars threatens to control the entire population of this planet fromearth orbit Tesla's death ray inventions can be utilized in a variety of ways-asscalar wave howitzers, world radar, earthquake contrivances, brain wavemanipulation, particle beam weapons, wave-train impulses, hand-held phasers andan infinite variety of more devices.On the good side of this technology, there is free energy and the use of TeslaShields, the forming of an energy shell around a city, community or installationthat is impenetrable. Blasts from a Tesla Howitzer could destroy thecommunications network of any major city with a well placed jolt of manymillions volts, and air strikes can be called in from space. The militaryapplications for many of Tesla's inventions are myriad, and so the need for acover-up of Tesla and his inventions would behoove the military industrialcomplex.[../Images/main-83.jpg]ABOVE & BELOW: TESLA’S DEATH RAY POPULARIZED IN A DRAWING FROM \"DIABOLICAL RAYS\"IN THE NOVEMBER, 1915 ISSUE OF POPULAR RADIO MAGAZINE.

It also is the story of a little-known butintensely bitter feud that pitted Edison and the fabulously wealthy financierJ.P. Morgan on one side and Tesla and his ally, the equally powerful GeorgeWestinghouse on the other. And, finally, it is a spy story.Many in the Tesla Society are convinced that foolish U.S. bureaucrats shippedthe secrets needed to build Star Wars that Tesla discovered tocommunist-controlled Yugoslavia shortly after World War II, thereby allowing theSoviets an enormous head start in the quest for a particle beam weapon that isdeemed essential to building any missile shield.In an interview between sessions at this August's Tesla symposium, Grotzexplained that Tesla was drawn to Colorado Springs because he needed both thedry climate and the furiously powerful lightning storms that so often cometumbling down the sides of Pikes Peak and Cheyenne Mountain.\"Tesla dreamed of supplying limitless amounts of power freely and equallyavailable to all persons on Earth,\" said Grotz.And he was convinced he could do so by broadcasting electrical power acrosslarge distances just as radio transmits far smaller amounts of energy, explainedGrotz.The same energy beams, of course, could be directed at the speed of light todestroy enemy planes and missiles as well as to supply electricity, he noted.Such investigations take one into the realm of the most complicated questionfacing science today, the so-called Unified Field Theory that Albert Einsteinhimself confessed was beyond his abilities, acknowledged Grotz, an engineer forthis Martin Marietta Aerospace company in Denver.Tesla believed that he could broadcast power by producing vibrations in theatmosphere that were perfectly in phase with the natural vibrations that existin thunderstorms, said Grotz.Then, anyone with a receiver could simply tap into broadcasts and acquireelectricity just as they receive radio or TV broadcasts.On a hilltop just where the prairies sweep up to the foot of the Rockies, Teslaerected a gigantic version of what is known as the Tesla Coil, a device thatproduces dramatic arcs of electricity by rapidly changing its resistance.Nearly every natural history museum and high school physics lab in the worldsports a Tesla Coil capable of making delighted students' hair stand on end orof arcing dramatic sparks from the fingertips of someone who, standing firmly ona rubber mat, holds the other hand over the coil's top.At the corner of Foote and Kowia streets in Colorado Springs, Tesla erected acoil 122 feet high. Tapping into the entire city electric system, the electricalgenius sent millions of volts of current into the structure and bolts ofman-made lightning leaped as much as 135 feet into the brooding sky to minglewith other bolts created in nature.The first time he threw the Switch, the entire city was blacked, tests createdartificial clouds around his installation and caused lights to burn as much as26 miles away, according to news reports of the time.The Colorado Springs artificial lightning bolts created during the single yearthat Tesla lived here, 1899-1900, have never been duplicated, said Grotz.The experiments established that lightning storms as they swooped down theRockies and then rumbled across the plains into Kansas were resonating at afrequency of 7.68 cycles per second.This natural phenomenon was rediscovered in the 1960s by researcher W.O.Schumann while working for the Navy on ways to broadcast nuclear war orders tosubmerged submarines, said Grotz.A paper widely circulated at the Tesla symposium called \"Star Wars Now! TheBohm-Aharonov Effect, Scalar Interferometry and Soviet Weaponization\" speculatesthat the mysterious clouds that frightened airline pilots were created whenenergy was drained from one area and transmitted to another using Teslaprinciples.The paper's author, T.E. Beaden, a retired Pentagon war games expert and activeconsulting engineer to the Defense Department, said the result of such energytransmissions is a \"cold explosion\" that could be enormously destructive.Noting that the cloud covered 150 miles, Beaden wrote, \"A single shot of such aweapon could almost instantly freeze every NATO soldier in that area into ablock of ice.\"Grotz acknowledged that much of the world's mainstream scientific communitydoubts the claims made by Tesla fans like himself and Beaden.\"But,\" he added, \"Tesla always was rejected by the establishment.\"After Tesla began building AC dynamos, motors and other devices with financialbacking from Westinghouse, Edison and his General Electric Company waged acampaign to discredit AC by emphasizing its dangers, according \"to Teslabiographer Margaret Cheney in her \"Tesla, Man Out of Time.\"Edison would force dogs and cats to stand on steel plates energized by ACcurrent and then throw a switch, electrocuting them. He called the process\"Westinghousing,\" Cheney wrote.Ultimately Tesla lost out to Edison and other foes, even though his AC powersystem prevailed.The visionary died in 1943 in a New York hotel room he shared with severalpigeons that he considered his only friends, the biographer said.After the war, Tesla's relatives in Yugoslavia petitioned Washington to receive17 trunks of papers and laboratory equipment that he had stored in a New Yorkgarage.In 1952 these items were sent to Belgrade where they are housed in a Teslamuseum.But, said Grotz, \"What do you suppose are the chances that everything was firstcopied by the KGB?\"\"In the USA we don't even give him credit for inventing the radio and the Sovietbloc is building Tesla museums,\" said the engineer.\"Why do they respect him so much?\"[../Images/main-92.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[../Images/main-93.jpg]OUR FUTURE MOTIVE POWERBY NIKOLA TESLADecember 1931Above and to the right, the arrangement of one of the great terrestrial-heatpower plants of the future.

As early as 1899, in the Colorado Springs tests, Teslasent electrical beams through the earth and lighted up light bulbs five milesaway.Tesla is credited with so many inventions, that one might begin to think that heinvented much of our modern technology. Tesla's battle for recognition as theinventor of the radio, a device still usually credited to Marconi, is familiarto most Tesla enthusiasts.Among the incredible inventions that Tesla actually conceived, frequentlypatented, were:The Electric SubmarineIn 1898 Tesla patented the Teleautomaton Boat, (#613,809) an electricallypowered submarine. This submarine would pick-up electricity that was beingbroadcast to it by a receiver. Power could also be stored in batteries and theelectric submarine could be operated by remote control.Tesla's VTOLHis design for a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft received itspatent on January 3, 1928. This was to become Tesla's last patented invention.After this, he no longer sought patents on any of his inventions.The Electro Dynamic Induction LampIn 1894, Tesla's Electro-Dynamic Induction Lamp was given US. patent 514. 170.The Electro-Dynamic Induction Lamp is a type of light bulb that is said to befar in advance than those currently available.The Bladeless Tesla TurbineThis bladeless turbine, patented in 1916 (#1,329,559), uses a series of rotatingdiscs to pump liquids or gases through a turbine engine. Hovercraft speed boats,or simple pumps can utilize the Bladeless Turbine. It is said to be the world'smost efficient engine, and is 20 times more efficient than a conventionalturbine, yet, it is still not in use today!Improved Unipolar GeneratorIn 1891, Tesla published an article in The Electrical Engineer (New York Sept.2,1891 about his improved version of the Unipolar Generator. His rotating discand opposing magnets has been copied by many \"magic-motor\" builders over theyears.Tesla's Mechanical OscillatorAn unusual and little-known device invented by Tesla was the MechanicalOscillator which compressed air until the oxygen became a liquid. It was builtin the form of an air cylinder and contained several chambers, each of whichsuccessively cools the air until it becomes liquid. Tesla stated that the devicewas highly efficient and could be used as a power generating system if magnetswere attached to the oscillating pistons. Tesla believed that an \"oxygen recyclesystem\" was a vast improvement to gasoline engines and intended to conductimportant experiments with LIQUID OXYGEN for new turbine engines capable ofdeveloping extraordinary power.Tesla's Ozone generatorTesla's ozone generator.

TESLA ONCE SAID IN 1933, WHEN 78 YEARS OLD, \"I EXPECT TOPHOTOGRAPH THOUGHTS... IN 1893, WHILE ENGAGED IN CERTAIN INVESTIGATIONS, IBECAME CONVINCED THAT A DEFINITE IMAGE FORMED IN THOUGHT, MUST BY REFLEX ACTION,PRODUCE A CORRESPONDING IMAGE ON THE RETINA, WHICH MIGHT BE READ BY A SUITABLEAPPARATUS. THIS BROUGHT ME TO MY SYSTEM OF TELEVISION WHICH I ANNOUNCED AT THATTIME... MY IDEA WAS TO EMPLOY AN ARTIFICIAL RETINA RECEIVING AN OBJECT OF THEIMAGE SEEN, AN OPTIC NERVE AND ANOTHER RETINA AT THE PLACE OF REPRODUCTION...BOTH BEING FASHIONED SOMEWHAT LIKE A CHECKERBOARD, WITH THE OPTIC NERVE BEING APART OF EARTH.\" TESLA MADE HIS TRANSITION BEFORE REVEALING TOO MANY DETAILS OFHIS INVENTION. THE ABOVE WERE TAKEN FROM A NEWSPAPER INTERVIEW THAT WAS RELEASEDTO WIRE SERVICES ON SEPTEMBER 10, 1933.Tesla's \"Thought Photography\" MachineThis was perhaps Nikola Tesla's most fantastic invention, a device forphotographing thought Tesla once said in 1933, when 78 years old, \"I expect tophotograph thoughts... In 1893, while engaged in certain investigations, becameconvinced that a definite image formed in thought, must by reflex action,produce a corresponding image on the retina, which might be read by a suitableapparatus. This brought me to my system of television which announced at thattime... My idea was to employ an artificial retina receiving an object of theimage seen, an optic nerve and another retina at the place of reproduction...both being fashioned somewhat like a checkerboard, with the optic nerve being apart of earth. \"Tesla made his transition before revealing to many details ofhis invention. The above were taken from a newspaper interview that was releasedto wire services on September 10, 1933.Anti-Gravity & the Wall of LightWhen matter is considered to be linked by electromagnetic wave propagations fromthe sun, manifesting as sunlight, then a literal Wall of Light can be created,and through this wall, all manifestations of time, space, gravity and matter canbe manipulated. The mystical Wall of Light, used frequently in Tesla references,and is the tide of a book about Tesla, is allegorical to columns of light in thesky, and to the manipulation of energy and matter.Tesla was unquestionably a visionary and a mystic. Anti-gravity airships weretypically depicted in illustrations of his interviews and advanced predictions.He often spoke of the coming world in which anti-gravity aircraft will carrycargo across the continent, drawing power from centrally located power stationsalong the earth grid.Tesla has been credited with several space drives, though plans that have beenpublished are dubious. In his mind he had no doubt created an electro-graviticcraft that would draw power from his Wardenclyffe Tower plant. Could such acraft have ever been built in secret? Tesla certainly had the plans for such acraft in his head—all he needed was a wealthy financier. Perhaps a JulesVerne-type character like Captain Nemo.It is interesting to note here that Tesla's electric submarine could also be theproto-design for the airship, as these cigar-shaped craft can allegedly gounderwater, and act as submarines, as well as airships.Teleportation and Time Travel DevicesTesla's Death Ray, a kind of radio-wave-scalar weapon or ultra-sound gun, wasthe stepping stone to more important inventions, like teleportation and TimeTravel devices. H.G. Wells had already popularized the idea, but Tesla may haveactually experimented with such devices.With such popular time-travel tales as The Philadelphia Experiment and TheMontauk Project, it would only seem natural that secret government research ontime-travel and teleportation would owe something to the work of Nikola Tesla.If Tesla was truly the genius that some believe he was, he could have made hisown time-machine and gone into the future, or maybe teleport himself to Mars.Perhaps he built a flying saucer and flew away, after cleverly faking his death.Tesla was like an odd-ball hero from the past. A literal Man Out of Time. He hadvisions of his inventions, even as a teenager.TESLA AND ATLANTISAccording to the Unarius Academy of San Diego, California, Nikola Tesla was thereincarnation of an Adantean engineer and inventor who was responsible for theenergy supply first used to power on a now destroyed island in the Atlantic.According to Unarius, from the great central pyramid in Atlantis, power beamswould be relayed from reflectors on mountaintops into the Afferent homes wherethese power beams would be converted into light, heat or even to cool the house.According to Unarius, a round glass globe or sphere about afoot in diameter wasfilled with certain rare gases that would fluoresce and give off a soft whitelight, just as does a modern fluorescent light. Heating or cooling was alsoquite simple: Air being made up of molecules of gases, each molecule composed ofa number of atoms. Electrical energy of a certain frequency was then radiatedthrough the air and converted into heat trough \"hysteresis\" in theelectromagnetic fields of the atoms.According to Unarms, the same proposition in reverse makes the air become cold.Similarly, the atmosphere on the earth is always converting certainelectromagnetic energy into heat. Speaking from the point of absolute zero (495degrees Fahrenheit), all air on the surface of the earth is comparatively warm,even at the poles.Cooling or heating the air at any given point means merely to decrease orincrease the \"electromagnetic hysteresis.\" As a definition for a Pabsthysteresis-synchronous motor, Unarius says that it is the \"inductive principleof cosmic hysteresis, and add that the reference to \"hysteresis\" is not theearth-electronics definition, but rather an electromagnetic conversion processwherein cyclic (4di dim.) waveform-structures are transformed into lower (3rddim.) waveform-structures.\"Minoan homes are used as an example, where it is said that a small object afootor so square sitting on the floor of any room could be both the heater and thecooler. It would, according to the dictates of a thermostat, radiate certainenergies into the room which would either slow down hysteresis and make the aircooler or speed up hysteresis and make the air warmer; a far different processthan our present-day crude, clumsy, inefficient and enormous heating and coolingsystems which must always either heat air in a furnace or cool it by means ofrefrigeration and, with a fan, blow it into the room through a large duct.The Adantean Power SystemTesla's Adantean power system, according to Unarius, was a huge rotatingsquirrel-cage generator turned by a motor was linked up to an electroniccomputer which was housed in a twenty-foot square metal box on the floor justabove the generator. This computer automatically made and broke connections—withbanks of power collector cells on the outside pyramid surface in such asequential manner that a tremendous oscillating voltage was built up. On theten-foot ball which stood atop the metal box, this oscillating electricitydischarged more than six hundred feet straight up to a similar metal ballhanging down from the pyramid apex on a long metal rod.Unarius compares the Atlantean-Tesla system to that of a 1900's scientist namedSteinmetz, a friend of Tesla's. Steinmetz hurled thunder-bolts from two largemetal spheres one hundred feet apart in a manner which is somehow strangelysimilar to the process used in the Atlantean Pyramid 16,000 years ago. Thisdischarge across the two metal balls served as a tank-circuit, as it is calledand again a similarity to our modern early-day wireless, a motor turning arimless rotary wheel from which protruded a number of spokes, actuallyelectrodes A the wheel rotated about 2,000 rpm (rotations per minute), asizzling white spark jumped from the spokes to another electrode placed aboutone-half inch away from the spokes. It was this spark-gap which created thenecessary high-intensity voltage.According to Unarius, on top of the Adantean pyramid was a fifty-foot metalcolumn, something like a thick flagpole, which terminated in a circular bank ofwhat looked like the spokes on a wheel. About ten feet long and sixteen inchesin diameter, these spokes protruded at a number of irregular intervals, each onecarefully sighted like a rifle, to a near or distant receiver. These spokes wereactually composed of an exotic mixture of metals and formed into a homogeneous,crystalline aggregate under extreme pressure and magnetic hysteresis. Each rodor spoke then contained billions of tiny crystals; each one pointed, so tospeak, toward the outside flat of the rod. They absorbed energy and like a boywho'd eaten too much watermelon, they reached certain capacity and dischargedtheir energy toward the outside end of the rod.The net total of these charge and discharge oscillations were on the order ofmillions of megacycles per second and as they functioned from the end of therod, a beam of pure coherent energy emerged—and at the rate of more than 186,000miles per second straight to a receiver, abeam of enormous power. How similar toour present first versions of the laser: A six-inch synthetic ruby rod, one inchin diameter and containing many chromium molecules; these chromium moleculeswere charged with electricity from an outside source of condenser banks andother associated equipment which generated a high-frequency impulse. As thechromium molecule atoms reached their saturation point, they discharged theirenergies which began to oscillate ping-pong fashion from each end of theoptically-ground and slivered ends of the rod. When this oscillating energyreached a certain point, it discharged through the more lightly silvered end ina single straight coherent beam of great intensity and power.The power beams which emerged from the Atlantis pyramid were intercepted bysimilar metallic rods of crystallized metal which, because they oscillated in asimilar manner an frequency, presented no resistance to the enormous power ofthe beam. The beam then traveled straight through the rod or was broken up andseparated into separate beams by a crystal prism, which again sent beamspulsating through crystalline rods and on a new tangent to another receiver.In utilizing these power beams in a dwelling, a metal ball fitted on top of ametal rod, like a small flagpole, contained a crystal of certain prismaticfigurations which directed the beam down through the hollow center of the rod toa disburser instrument which energized the entire house by means of induction sothat the round milky-white crystal globes would glow with light, motors turn,etc.The Generator-Oscillator BanksUnarius's technical description goes on to describe the generator-oscillatorhanks beneath the pyramid and the generation of the 'flame'. In the subterraneanchamber beneath the floor stood a motor-generator combination mounted on avertical shaft. This piece of machinery \"worked exactly similar to our presentday Pabst synchronous-hysteresis motor, that is, exactly in reverse to ordinarymotors which have a rotor rotating inside fixed stationary field coils. In thePabst motor, the rotor is stationary and the metal field terminals rotate aroundit, similar to a squirrel cage.The Adantean motor-generator combination works as follows: a hugeexternally-powered, (AC.) alternating current motor rotated the squirrel cagewhich was actually a large number of extremely powerful high-gauss,high-intensity magnets affixed to the metal frame which rotated around whatwould normally be the rotor which was made from a high-permeability, soft ironcore. Wound around a large number of these poles were almost countless thousandsof turns of insulated wire.\"These coils were, in turn, connected up to different banks of cells on theoutside skin surface of the pyramid. The sequence of this wiring was such, thatwhen the magnets turned around the rotor, the cells and the magnetic currents sogenerated were in extremely rapid sequence which built up an extremelyhigh-frequency oscillating voltage which discharged across the two balls which Idescribed previously. The purpose of this gap was to stabilize theseoscillations under resistive conditions in open air.\"Increasing the frequency increases the voltage or power which is why a laserbeam can pierce a diamond with less energy than would light a small flashlight.The energy from a five-foot long lightning bolt from a Tesla coil (500,000Cycles per second) is less than two millionths of all ampere and would causeonly a mild tingling sensation. A lightning bolt traveling from a cloud to theearth contains only enough energy to light a hundred-watt bulb for about thirtyseconds.\"According to Unarius, electronic scientists of today \"are still a bit mixed upon the proposition of voltage versus frequency. They string 1/2 inch thicklaminated cable across the countryside for hundreds of miles from tall steeltowers and push electricity through these cables in far-away cities at voltagesin excess of 300,000 and at only 60 cycles per second alternating frequency,whereas a small pencil-thin power beam oscillating at hundreds of millions oftimes per second could be reflected from tower to tower across country; one beamcarrying sufficient power to energize the largest city.\"Protective Metal HelmetsAccording to Unarius, and other esoteric groups that expound on ancient science,in ancient Egypt, Mexico, and other lands where there were pyramids theEgyptians and others tried to duplicate the round spoke-like wheel which glowedwith a blue-white corona and which shot beams of intense light in differentdirections. The Egyptians topped their stone pyramid with a large ball-likecontrivance covered with small plates of pure polished gold in a scale-likemanner; and as the earth turned, shafts of light were reflected in alldirections.Several thousands of years later, these metal balls with scales of gold haddisappeared, so had the alabaster white coating except for small sections nearthe top, in order to use the smaller surface stones in nearby cities forbuilding purposes.[../Images/main-97.jpg]The modern Egyptians wore in their temples and palaces a metallic headdress andwoven metal scafes interwoven with threads of gold which hung down over theirshoulders just as they did in the ancient Atlantis when, after the scientistshad gone, the Atlanteans started to worship the flame in the temple pyramid.Unarius mentions that the metallic headdress plus a metallic robe was necessaryto protect them from the strong electromagnetic field in the pyramid and throughvarious priesthoods the metallic headdress has arrived in our present moderntime in the form of a scarf worn by women in a Catholic church, or the uraeusworn by the priest.Here we see how the Egyptian gold headdress may have originated from the ancientAdantean power station engineers, and it is fascinating to note that thecelebrated Face On Mars is also wearing a similar protective helmet! Are thepyramids of Mars part of a similar Adantean Power system as Tesla was planningto build on earth? This brings us to the final mystery of Nikola Tesla: hisinvolvement with Guglielmo Marconi and the Pyramids of Mars.[../Images/main-98.jpg][../Images/main-99.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8THE LAST PATENTS (1913 TO 1928)[../Images/main-100.jpg][../Images/main-101.jpg]TESLA'S DESIGN OF A VERTICAL TAKEOFF AIRCRAFT.CHAPTER 9TESLA & THE PYRAMIDS OF MARSThe relationship between Tesla and Marconi is a fascinating study! While Teslahas become a popular figure to Revisionist Scientists in the last ten years,Marconi is still largely unknown and seen as an usurper of Tesla's inventions.Yet Guglielmo Marconi (1874-1937), was a brilliant scientist, and, in fact,Tesla's close friend.In the esoteric writing of the Latin countries, Marconi has achieved a nearlegendary status, much as Tesla has recently in the United States. But mostTesla students are unaware that Marconi was supposed to have founded a secrethigh-tech city in the remote southern jungles of Venezuela.The great Italian scientist Guglielmo Marconi was a former student of Tesla's.Marconi studied radio transmission theory with Tesla and made his first radiotransmission in 1895. Marconi was fascinated by the transmission of power, andin 1896 received a British patent and sent a signal nine miles across theBristol Channel. In 1899 he successfully setup a wireless station to communicatewith a French station 31 miles across the English Channel.It was thought that the curve of the earth's surface would limit radiotransmission to 200 miles at the most When, on December 11,1901, Marconitransmitted a signal from Poldhu, Cornwall, to St. John's Newfoundland, 2000miles away, he created a major sensation. For this Marconi replaced the wirereceiver with a coherer, a glass tube filled with iron filings, which couldconduct radio waves. At the time there was no scientific explanation for thisphenomena of long-distance transmission, and it was postulated that there was alayer in the upper atmosphere—the ionosphere—which reflected backelectromagnetic waves.MARCONI THE MYSTERIOUSMarconi was the son of a wealthy Italian landowner and an Irish mother Wheninterest in his first transmission in 1895 had not interested Italianauthorities, he had gone to Britain. The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company wasformed in London in 1896 and Marconi made millions off his inventions. Marconiand Tesla are both given credit for the invention of the radio Marconi'shistorical radio transmission utilized a Heinrich Hertz spark arrester a Popovantenna and an Edouard Bramely coherer for his simple device that was to go onto become the modern radio.Marconi was given the Noble Prize for Physics in 1909 jointly with KarlFerdinand Braun, who made important modification which considerably increasedthe range of the first Marconi transmitters.Like Tesla, Marconi was a mysterious man in his later years, and was known toperform experiments, including anti-gravity experiments, aboard his yachtElectra. Marconi's yacht was a floating superlaboratory, from which he sentsignals into space and lit lights in Australia in 1930. He did this with the aidof an Italian physicist named Landini by sending wave train signals through theearth, much as Tesla had done in Colorado Springs.In June of 1936 Marconi demonstrated to Italian Fascist dictator BenitoMussolini a wave gun device that could be used as a defensive weapon. In the1930's such devices were popularized as \"death rays\" as in a Boris Karloff filmof the same name. Marconi demonstrated the ray on a busy highway north of Milanone afternoon. Mussolini had asked his wife Rachele to also be on the highway atprecisely 3:30 in the afternoon. Marconi's device caused the electrical systemsin all the cars, including Rachele's, to malfunction for half an hour, while herchauffeur and other motorists checked their fuel pumps and spark plugs. At 3:35all the cars were able to start again. Rachele Mussolini later published thisaccount in her autobiography.Mussolini was quite pleased with Marconi's invention, however it is said thatPope Pius XI learned about the invention of the paralyzing rays and took stepsto have Mussolini stop Marconi's research. According to Marconi's followers,Marconi then took his yacht to South America in 1937, after faking his owndeath.THE SECRET CITY IN SOUTH AMERICAA number of European scientists were said to have gone with Marconi, includingLandini. In the 1937, the enigmatic Italian physicist and alchemist Fulcanelliwarned European physicists of the grave dangers of atomic weapons and thenmysteriously vanished a few years later. He is believed to have joined Marconi'ssecret group in South America.Ninety-eight scientists were said to have gone to South America where they builta city in an extinct volcanic cater in the southern jungles of Venezuela. Intheir secret city, financed by the great wealth they had created during theirlives, they continued Marconi's work on solar energy, cosmic energy andantigravity. They worked secretly and apart from the world's nations, buildingfree-energy motors and ultimately discoid aircraft with a form of gyroscopicanti-gravity. The community is said to be dedicated to universal peace and thecommon good of all mankind. Believing the rest of the world to be under thecontrol of energy companies, multi-national bankers and the military-industrialcomplex, they have remained isolated from the rest of the world, workingsubversively to foster peace and a clean, ecological technology on the world.We have information on this astonishing high-tech city from a number of sources.In the South America the story is a common subject among certain metaphysicalgroups. Says the French writer Robert Charroux in his book The Mysteries of theAndes, (1974, 1977, Avon Books) \"... the Ciudad Subterranean de los Andes, isdiscussed in private from Caracas to Santiago.\" Charroux goes on to tell thestory of Marconi and his secret city, plus the story of a Mexican journalistnamed Mario Rojas Avendaro who investigated the Ciudad Subterranean de los Andes(Underground City of the Andes) and concluded that it was a true story. Avendarowas contacted by man named Nacisso Genovese, who had been a student of Marconi'sand was a physics teacher at a High School in Baja, Mexico.Genovese was an Italian by origin and claimed to have lived for many years inthe Ciudad Subterranean de los Andes. Sometime in the late 1950s he wrote anobscure book entitled \"My Trip To Mars.\" Though the book was never published inEnglish, it did appear in various Spanish, Portuguese and Italian editions.TESLA TECHNOLOGYGenovese claimed that the city had been built with large financial resources,was underground and had better research facilities than any other researchfacility in the world (at mat time, at least). By 1946 the city already using apowerful collector of cosmic energy, the essential component of all matter,according to Marconi's theories, many of which he had derived from Tesla. \"In1952,\" according to Genovese, \"we traveled above all the seas and continents ina craft whose energy supply was continuous and practical inexhaustible. Itreached a speed of half a million miles an hour and withstood enormouspressures, near the limit of resistance of the alloys that composed it. Theproblem was to slow it down at just the right time.\"According to Genovese, the city is located at the bottom of a crater, is mostlyunderground and is entirely self-sufficient. The extinct volcano is covered inthick vegetation, is hundreds of miles from any roads, and is at thirteenthousand feet in the jungle mountains of the Amazon.The French author Charroux expressed surprise and disbelief to the statementthat the city was on a jungle covered mountain that was 13,000 feet high. Yet,the eastern side of Andean cordillera has many such mountains, from Venezuela toBolivia, spanning thousands of miles. Several such cities, and mountains, couldexist in this vast, unexplored, and perpetually cloud-covered region.Yet, a secret city in a jungle crater was the least of the claims. Genoveseclaimed that flights to the Moon and Mars were made in their \"flying saucers.\"He claimed that once the technology had been conquered, it was relatively simpleto make the trip to the Moon (a few hours) or Mars (several days). Genovese doesnot mention pyramids or what they did on Mars. Perhaps they created a Martianbase in one of the ancient, sand-blown pyramids of the Cydonia Region.There have been many reports of UFOs in South America, especially along the edgeof the mountainous jungles of the eastern Andes, from Bolivia to Venezuela. Isit possible that some of these UFOs are antigravity craft from the CiudadSubterranean de los Andes?In light of highly reliable sources who claim that a \"Last Battalion\" of Germansolders escaped via submarine in the last days of WWII to Antarctica and SouthAmerica, it is possible that the Germans may have high tech super cities in theremote jungles of South America as well.A number of military historians, such as Col. Howard Buechner, author of Secretsof the Holy Lance and Hitler's Ashes, maintain that the Germans had alreadycreated bases in Queen Maud Land, opposite South Africa during the war.Afterwards, German U-Boats, in some reports as many as 100, took importantscientists, aviators and politicians to the final fortress of Nazi Germany. Twoof these U-boats surrendered in Argentina three months after the war. In 1947,the U.S. Navy invaded Antarctica, mainly Queen Maud Land with Admiral Byrd incommand.The Americans were defeated and several jets from the four aircraft carrierswere said to have been shot down by discoid craft. The navy retreated and didnot return until 1957.According to the book, Chronicle of Akakor, a book first published in German bythe journalist Karl Brugger, a German battalion had taken refuge in anunderground city on the borders of Brazil and Peru. Brugger, a German journalistwho lived in Manaus, was assassinated in the Rio de Janeiro suburb of Ipanema in1981. His guide, Tatunca Nara, went on to become Jacques Cousteau's guide on theupper Amazon. In fact, photographs of Tatunca Nara appear in Cousteau's largecoffee-table book of color photographs called Cousteau's Amazon Journey. (Formore information on Tatunca Nara, Karl Brugger, Underground Cities and Germanssee Lost Cities & Ancient Mysteries of South America.)While the secret cities of South America manufacturing flying saucers andbattling the current powers of the world from their hidden jungle fortresses maysound too much like the plot of a James Bond movie, it appears to be based onfact!Based upon the above scenario, it may not be totally fantastic to suggest, assome authors have, that Tesla was picked up during the late 1930s by a flyingsaucer. Yet, it would not have been a flying saucer from another planet, but oneof Marconi's craft from the secret city in South America.In the most incredible scenario so-far, and one that may well be true, Tesla wasinduced to fake his own death, just as Marconi and many of the other scientistshad done, and was taken, by special discoid craft, to Marconi's high-techsuper-city. Away from the outside world, the military governments, the oilcompanies, the arms and aircraft manufacturers, Marconi and Tesla, bothsupposedly dead, continued their experiments, in an atmosphere conducive toscientific achievement.Who knows what they may have achieved? They were ten years ahead of the Germansand twenty years ahead of the Americans in their anti-gravity technology. Couldthey have developed discoid spacecraft in the early 1940s, and gone on to timetravel machines and hyperspace drives? Perhaps Marconi and Tesla went into thefuture, and have already returned to the past!Time Travel experiments, teleportation, pyramids on Mars, Armageddon and aneventual Golden Age on earth, may all have something to do with Tesla, Marconiand their suppressed inventions. While \"UFO experts\" and \"former intelligenceagents\" tell us that flying saucers are extraterrestrial and are being currentlyretro-engineered by military scientists, Tesla, Marconi and their friends may bewaiting for us at their space base at the pyramids and Face on Mars.Our government, Hollywood and the media have trained us to certain beliefs andprejudices that amazing technology must be from extraterrestrials visiting ourplanet.

He maintained by mortgaging the Wardenclyffeproperty and tower to the hotel and its owner, George C. Boldt. Since theanticipated income from the Wardenclyffe project of transmitting messages acrossthe Atlantic was unrealized, Tesla was unable to repay the mortgages. Action wastaken by the mortgagees in 1915 to foreclose on the property, and a bill of saleoffered to Lester S. Holmes, a developer. The property would be sold to Holmesand the tower would be destroyed so that property could be developed.Tesla appealed the foreclosure judgment, and the case was heard by the SupremeCourt of the State of New York, Suffolk County. Tesla lost the case on appeal.Following the judgment on April 20, 1922, Tesla vacated his suite at theWaldorf-Astoria and took up residence at the Hotel St Regis.Though the 313 page transcript document largely contains the various lawyersarguing about the legal instruments of mortgaging and foreclosure actions,portions of the testimony are interesting. During Tesla's testimony, he giveimportant information about the Wardenclyffe installation (transcript pages163-181). Next is a portion of Ezra C. Bingham's testimony, chief engineer forthe Waldorf-Astoria, in which he describes how the tower had been vandalized,and how poor the condition of the plant was (transcript pages 235-247).

No, counsel interrupted you intentionally in the middle of a sentence-Mr. Hawkins: That is not true, that I interrupted him intentionally.Mr. Fordham: Well, strike out the word intentionally. You interrupted him in themiddle of the sentence. He can say what he started to say about his memory inconnection with this transaction. The witness evidently thinks he does not needto pay any attention to what I say. Will your Honor kindly instruct the witnessto complete his answer.By the Referee:Q. Had you completed your answer? A. Yes, those were the parting words of Mr.Hutchins.By Mr. Hawkins:Q. As Mr. Fordham seems anxious to have you complete what you said, I heard whatyou said-Mr. Fordham: He says he has completed.A. Yes/in regard to the memory of the exact date, 1 say that I cannot exactlyremember the dates on account of concentration on some other work that I amdoing now, but I can easily ascertain all the dates from documents.Q. Now at the time that you delivered that document to Mr. Hutchins, I refer nowto the deed, will you please describe to the Court what there was upon theproperty?A. Upon the property?Q. Yes, described in the deed, which property is situated at Rocky PointMr. Fordham: That is objected to on the ground it is incompetent, immaterial andirrelevant at this point what there was on the property.The Referee: I will take it,Mr. Fordham: We exceptThe Referee: You mean structures, I suppose?Mr. Hawkins: Yes, absolutely. Improvements, I had in mind, if there were anybuild-ings there or structures.Q. Tell the Court what there was there.A. There was a brick building in which was located the power plant-Q. Please describe the size of the brick building.A. The building forms a square about one hundred by one hundred feet wide and itis one floor, rather high, with a roof covered with gravel, as they usually makethem. This building was divided inside in four compartments, two of which werevery large, one being the machine shop-Q. How large was that?A. That was one hundred feet by about thirty-five feet, I should say.Q. Now tell how big the other compartments were.A. The other one was about one hundred by thirty-five and then these other twosmaller ones where the engines were located on one side and the boilers on theother were about thirty by forty, thirty one way and forty the other.Q. I think you said the building was one story high?A. Yes.Q. It had one floor, did it?A. One floor, yes.Q. Further describe the building, if there is any further description, and tellthe Court whether there were any brick chimneys, outside chimneys?A. Oh yes, right in the center of the building rose the chimney.Q. How big was the chimney?A. The chimney was four by four feet; it was calculated to give the proper speedto the products of combustion under the boilers.Q. Of what was the chimney composed?A. Brick.Q. How high was the building?A. The building might have been, I think the extent of the walls on one side,the lowest part of the roof might have been something like twenty-eight feet, Iwould say.Q. Twenty-eight feet at the corners of the building?A. Yes.Q. And did it have a gable roof or a lantern roof?A. Yes, as you call it in English—how is this roof called?Q. I think it is a gable roof.A. Gable roof. The building was resting on cement foundations and there were theusual modern conveniences and-Q. Tell what you mean by the usual modern conveniences?A. I mean the channels for leading off the waste, the rain drips and all that,and then attached to it was, of course, the water pump that pumped the water forthe building.Mr. Fordham: I do not wish to interrupt counsel but what possible use can therebe in a detailed description of the building on this property?The Referee: I do not know at this time.Mr. Fordham: Neither do I. It does not seem to me that we should burden therecord indefinitely with these descriptive details.The Referee: I will let him describe them.Mr. Hawkins: It is a material part of the defense here.The Referee: Go ahead. I will take it.The Witness: I suppose what belongs to the buildings is the boiler plant, withtwo 300 horse power boilers on one side-Q. That was two 300-horse power?A. Two 300-horse power boilers, yes, and the pumps, injectors and otheraccessories, and then there were big water tanks that wore placed around thechimney so as to utilize some of the waste heat. These tanks had a capacity ofabout 16,000 gallons, if I am correct.Q. Of what were the tanks composed?A. Of quarter inch thick sheet steel, galvanized.Q. Those were all in one compartment, were they?A. They were around the chimney under the roof, and for this purpose the roomhad an extension upward there. This could be shown on a photograph if his Honorwishes to see the photograph.Q. Just a moment please. Now describe the other three compartments of thebuilding.A. Well, I have described the boiler plant Now right opposite to the boilerplant lengthwise was a corresponding compartment and therein were located theengines. Of these engines there was one 400-horse power Westinghousereciprocating engine, driving a directly connected dynamo which was speciallymade for my purposes. Then there was a 35-kilowatt Westinghouse outfit alsodriving the dynamo, which was for the purpose of lighting and other work, apermanent attachment to the building to furnish all conveniences. There was thena high pressure compressor which also formed an essential part of the equipment.And then there was a low pressure compressor or blower. Then there was a highpressure pump and a reciprocating low pressure pump. That was all-Q. Water pumps?A. Water pumps, yes. Those were all in that compartment, and of course thiscompartment also contained the switches and the switchboard and all that whichgoes with the equipment of the plant. Then there was a gallery on the top onwhich certain parts were placed and arranged that were needed daily in theoperation.Q. Those were parts of what?A. Well they were the tools, you know, that were needed in the plant.Q. Please describe another compartment.A. The compartment that was towards the railroad, that was the machine shop.Q. Which part of the building was that, the north, south, east or west?A. I cannot locate it-The Referee: The north side.The Witness: Towards the road, facing the road. That compartment was one hundredby thirty-five feet with a door in the middle and it contained I think eightlathes.The Referee: You are speaking now, when you said facing the road, that is on thesouth side, the travel road or-The Witness: Facing the railroad. It is just close on the railroad track, yourHonor, this building. That contained I think eight lathes ranging in swing fromeight inches to thirty-two, I believe. Then there was a milling machine andthere was a planer, and shaper, a spliner, a vertical machine for splining. Thenthere were three drills, one very large, another medium and a third quite smallone. Then there were four motors which operated the machinery. Also a grinderand an ordinary grindstone, a forge-Q. Blacksmith's forge?A. Yes, a blacksmith's forge. Then a special high temperature stove and theblower for the forge. Of course the shop was full of counter shafting and therewere a few special tools which suited certain purposes which I contemplatedthere. I cannot at present recall them exactly, but there were five or six ofthem.Q. Were those stationary tools or hand tools?A. No, -some of them were attachments to the ordinary lathes or millingmachines, suitable for certain work and others were of course portable.Q. Now have you described the four compartments of the building?A. No. Now the compartment opposite, that is facing further away from therailroad, which also was one hundred feet, the whole length of the building, byabout thirty-five, there is where the real expensive apparatus was located. Thatcontained also the desks and the office accessories. Shall 1 describe now thisone?Q. Yes, describe any stationary fixtures there were in this other compartment.A. Well, is machinery a stationary fixture? Q. Yes we call that a stationaryfixture. A. Right along the back wall that separated this compartment from therest of the building there were two special glass cases in which I kept thehistorical apparatus which was exhibited and described in my lectures andscientific articles. There were probably at least a thousand bulbs and tubeseach of which represented a certain phase of scientific development. Then close,beginning with these two glass cases, there were five large tanks. Four of thosecontained special transformers according to my design, made by the WestinghouseElectric Manufacturing Company. These were to transform the energy for theplant. They were about, I should say, seven feet high and about five by fivefeet each, and were filled with special oil which we call transformer oil, tostand an electric tension of 60,000 volts. Then besides these four tanks therewas another similar tank which was for special purposes, containing atransformer. Then there were two doors, one door that led to the othercompartment and the other one led in the closets, and between those two doorsthere was a space on which was placed my electric generating apparatus. Thisapparatus I used in ray laboratory demonstrations in two laboratories before,and I had also used it in the Colorado experiments where I erected a wirelessplant in 1889. That apparatus was precious because it could flash a messageacross the Atlantic, and yet it was built in 1894 or 1895. That is a complicatedand very expensive apparatus.Then beyond the door there were again four tanks, big tanks almost the same sizeasthose I described. These four tanks were to contain the condensers, what we callelectric condensers, which store the energy and then discharge and make it goaround the world. These condensers, some of them, were in an advanced state ofconstruction, two, I think, and the others were not. They were according to aprinciple of discovery. Then there was a very expensive piece of apparatus thatthe Westinghouse Company furnished me; only two of this kind of apparatus weremade by the Westinghouse Company, one for me and one for themselves. It wasdeveloped together by myself and their engineers. That was a steel tank whichcontained a very elaborate assemblage of coils, an elaborate regulatingapparatus, and it was intended to give every imaginable regulation that I wantedin my measurements and control of energy. Then on the last side, where I haddescribed the first four big tanks there was a special 100-horse power motor andthis motor was equipped with elaborate devices for rectifying the alternatingcurrents and then sending them into the condensers. On this apparatus alone Ispent thousands of dollars. The 100-horse power motor was specially constructedfor me by the Westinghouse Company, but the other parts were all made by myselfand that took a considerable portion of space there and it was a wonderful pieceof apparatus. I have photographs of these which will make this description veryclear.Then along the center of the room, I had a very precious piece of apparatus.That was a boat which was illustrative of my discovery of teletaumatics; that isa boat which was controlled without wire, which would do anything you wanted,but there was no connection. This boat was exhibited by me on many occasions.Q. The boat was not stationary, was it?A. It was stationary, yes, on the supports. It was stationary on the supportsbut as I say that boat was my wireless boat; that is a boat that you commandedit and it would perform as many evolutions as you wanted, by just commanding it.Q. Was that about all there was, generally speaking?A. Oh, no, nowhere near. Then there were on each side long specially made, howdo you call them, not desks or shelves, but closets, I might say, which werespecially made to contain the apparatus, because I had accumulated for yearshundreds of different kinds of appliances which stand for a certain principle,and this apparatus was stored in there, and on top of these I had again all fullof apparatus, each representing a different phase. And then on one side therewere the desks and then on the other side there were the drawing implements andtools. And then in the corner, when you looked at the railroad side, on theright side in the corner there was my testing room and that contained—there weretwo precious instruments among these that Lord Kelvin made especially for me. Hewas a great friend of mine. A device for measurement invented by him; it iscalled a breach; and another a voltmeter of his. Both of these things were givento me and prepared for me by his special instructions. There were a lot of otherinstruments, voltmeters, wattmeters, ampere meters; in that small space therewas a fortune in there.Mr. Fordham: The last, that there was a fortune in there, calls for a conclusionas to the salable value of the stuff and I think it should go out.The Referee: Yes, strike it out.Q. I think you said this building was constructed of brick, did you not?A. Yes.Q. How thick were the walls of it?A. That I cannot tell now exactly, but I should say about twelve inches.Q. It was more than one brick thick, at any rate?A. Oh, I should say so. I paid something-Q. I presume this building had windows in it?A. Oh yes there were large windows which were divided into panels.Q. And what were the window sash made of, metal or wood?A. Wood sashes.Q. I show you a document, Defendant's Exhibit C, and call your attention to thesignature on that document, and ask you if that is your signature?A. Yes sir, that is my signature.Q. Do you recognize the instrument?A. Yes sir, that was one of the-Q. That is the deed which you delivered, is it not? A. Yes.Q. I call your attention to the date of the deed, March 30, 1915.A. 1915?Q. Yes.A. Well that was—1915?Q. Yes.A. I was under the impression it was a little later.Q. Well that is the only deed which you delivered in the transaction to Mr.Holmes, is it not?A. Hutchins?Q. Hutchins, yes.A. So far as I know.Q. Then would you like to change your testimony when you said it was in 1917?The date of this in March 30. 1915.A. I have stated that I was not sure about the dates, but I could ascertain itexactly by looking at the documents.Q. Well there is the document.A. Well it must be so because it is there.Q. It is 1915 then instead of 1917?A. Yes, but my impression was that this was another attorney who had it firstand it was made to Mr. Hutchins later.Q. I do not know what you mean by saying it was made to Mr. Hutchins. Thegrantee in the deed is Lester K. Holmes.A. Yes, Lester S. Holmes.By the Referee:Q. The transaction you had was with Mr. Hutchins?A. Yes that is all.The Referee: I do not think there is any dispute about that.Mr. Fordham: There was only one, I understand. The witness does not claim therewere two, one in 1915 and another in 1917.The Witness: No.By Mr. Hawkins:Q. No there was only one and Mr. Holmes was the grantee in the deed which yougave to Mr. Hutchins, was he not?A. Yes, and I recall the transaction with Mr. Hutchins.Q. Were there any other structures upon the property aside from the building?By the Referee:Q. Did you read that paper at the time you executed it?A. Yes at the request of Mr. Hutchins.By Mr. Hawkins:Q. Were there any other structures upon the premises other than that brickfactory or laboratory which you have just described?A. Yes sir, there was the structure which in a certain sense was the mostimportant structure, because the power plant was only an accessory to it Thatwas the tower.Q. Please describe the tower as to dimensions and material and method ofconstruction and kind of construction?Mr. Fordham: We renew our objection, if the Court please. This is entirelyimmaterial, irrelevant and incompetent until after they have succeeded inestablishing their contention that the deed is a mortgage.The Referee: I will take it.Mr. Fordham: Exception.A. The tower was 187 feet high from the base to the top. It was built of specialtimber and it was built in such a way that every stick could be taken out at anytime and replaced if it was necessary. The design of the tower was a matter ofconsiderable difficulty. It was made in the shape of an octagon and pyramidalform for strength and was supporting what I have termed in my scientificarticles a terminal.By the Referee:Q. There was sort of a globe at the top?A. Yes. That, your Honor, was only the carrying out of a discovery I made thatany amount of electricity within reason could be stored provided you make it ofa certain shape. Electricians even today do not appreciate that yet. But thatconstruction enabled me to produce with this small plant many times the effectthat could be produced by an ordinary plant of a hundred times the size. Andthis globe, the framework, was all specially shaped, that is the girders had tobe bent in shape and it weighed about fifty-five tons.By Mr. Hawkins:Q. Of what was it constructed?A. Of steel, all the girders being specially bent into shape.Q. Was the tower that supported it entirely constructed of wood or partly steel?A. That part alone on top was of steel. The tower was all timbers and of coursethe timbers were held together by specially shaped steel plates.The Referee: Braces?The Witness: Yes, steel plates. I had to construct it this way for technicalreasons. The Referee: We are not interested in that.Q. Was the tower enclosed or open?A. The tower, at the time of the execution of this deed, was open, but I havephotographs to show how it looked exactly and how it would have looked finished.Q. After you delivered the deed was the tower ever enclosed?A. No, it was just open.Q. Now the dome or the terminal at the top, was that enclosed?A. No sir.Q. Never enclosed?A. Never enclosed, no.Q. Had that structure ever been completed?A. The structure so far, if I understand the terms right, yes, the structure wasall completed but the accessories were not placed on it yet, For instance thatglobe there was to be covered with specially pressed plates. These plates-Q. That had not been done, had it?A. That had not been done, although I had it. all prepared. I had preparedeverything, I had designed and prepared everything, but it was not done.Q. Was the structure of the tower in any manner connected with the brickbuilding or power plant?A. The tower was separate.Q. I understand, but was there any connection between them?A. There were of course two channels. One was for communicating, for bringinginto the tower compressed air and water and such things as I might have neededfor operations, and the other one was to bring in the electric mains.By the Referee:Q. In order to do that there was, as a matter of fact, was there not, awell-like shaft going down right in the middle of the tower into the ground somefifty or sixty feet?A. Yes. You see the underground work is one of the most expensive parts of thetower. In this system that I have invented it is necessary for the machine toget a grip of the earth, otherwise it cannot shake the earth. It has to have agrip on the earth so that the whole of this globe can quiver, and to do that itis necessary to carry out a very expensive construction. I had in fact inventedspecial machines. But I want to say this underground work belongs to the tower.By Mr. Hawkins:Q. Anything that was there, tell us about.A. There was, as your Honor states, a big shaft about ten by twelve feet goesdown about one hundred and twenty feet and this was first covered with timberand the inside with steel and in the center of this there was a winding stairsgoing down and in the center of the stairs there was a big shaft again throughwhich the current was to pass, and this shaft was so figured in order to tellexactly where the nodal point is, so that I could calculate every point ofdistance. For instance I could calculate exactly the size of the earth or thediameter of the earth and measure it exactly within four feet with that machine.Q. And that was a necessary appurtenance to your tower?A. Absolutely necessary. And then the real expensive work was to connect thatcentral part with the earth, and there I had special machines rigged up whichwould push the iron pipes, one length after another, and I pushed these ironpipes. I think sixteen of them, three hundred feet, and then the current throughthese pipes takes hold of the earth. Now that was a very expensive part of thework, but it does not show on the tower, but it belongs to the tower.By Mr. Fordham :Q. Was the hole really one hundred and twenty feet deep, did you say?A. Yes, you see the ground water on that place is about one hundred and twentyfeet. We are above the ground water about one hundred and twenty feet. In thewell we struck water at about eighty feet.By the Referee :Q. What you call the main water table? A. Yes the main well we struck at eightyfeet, but there we had to go deeper.By Mr. Hawkins:Q. Tell the Court generally, not in detail, the purpose of that tower and theequipment which you have described connected with it?Mr. Fordham: How is that material? The Referee: I will take it. Mr. Fordham: Weexcept.A. Well, the primary purpose of the tower, your Honor, was to telephone, to sendthe human voice and likeness around the globe.By the Referee:Q. Through the instrumentality of the earth.A. Through the instrumentality of the earth. That was my discovery that Iannounced in 1893, and now all the wireless plants are doing that. There is noother system being used. And the idea was to reproduce this apparatus and thenconnect it just with a central station and telephone office, so that you maypick up your telephone and if you wanted to talk to a telephone subscriber inAustralia you would simply call up that plant and the plant would connectimmediately with that subscriber, no matter where in the world, and you couldtalk to him. And I had contemplated to have press messages, stock notations,pictures for the press and these reproductions of signatures, checks andeverything transmitted from there throughout the world, but-liy Mr. Hawkins:Q. The purpose then briefly was for wireless communication to various parts ofthe world?A. Yes and the tower was so designed that I could apply to it any amount ofpower andI was planning to give a demonstration in the transmission of power which I haveso perfected that power can be transmitted clear across the globe with a loss ofnot more than five per cent, and that plant was to serve as a practicaldemonstration. And then I was going to interest people in a larger project andthe Niagara people had given me 10,000-horse power-Q. What do you mean by power, energy?A. Yes, power in any amount.Q. Were there any other structures upon the premises?A. No, just these two big structures.Q. I call your attention, Mr. Tesla, to Defendants Exhibit A which Icharacterize as a bill of sale and ask you to notice the signature there.A. That is my signature, sir.Q. Now the date of this document is the 30th day of March, 1915?A. Yes sir.Q. Is that the bill of sale that was delivered the same time the deed wasdelivered?A. Yes.Q. I do not wish to repeat this, but when you stated that that was also on orabout the early part of 1917 you had in mind this document which you deliveredin March, 1915?A. Yes, but what stands out in my mind strongest is the construction of thetower, and that is the reason I have that in mind, the construction of thetower.Q. Do you recall the testimony of Mr. Hutchins, that the Waldorf enteredpossession of the property?A. Of Hutchins?Q. Do you recall the testimony of Mr. Hutchins?A. Yes, I recall something of that which he suited.Q. And when was that done, in 1917, before or subsequent to the destruction ofthe tower?A. It was done some time before the actual destruction of the tower.Q. Do you recall when the tower was destroyed?A. It was about in 1917, as near as I can recall, but I can ascertain-Q. When was the tower erected?A. The tower was erected from 1901 to 1902.Q. What had you done to it to preserve it?A. I spent considerable money on it by painting all the metal parts over threetimes, I think, each time at a cost of about a thousand dollars.Q. Was there anything done to preserve the wooden portion of the structure?A. Oh yes, we carefully watched everything, and-Q. I know, but did you apply anything to it? A. No not to the wood.Q. Did not paint it?A. No. not the wood.Q. Had the wood been treated in any manner prior to being put in theconstruction, to preserve it?Mr. Fordham: How is this material, your Honor? All this detail of preliminarywork?The Referee: I want to give counsel much latitude, but I suggest, to be just asbrief as you can about itMr. Hawkins: Yes. My idea is this, if the wood had been creosoted or treated inany way to preserve it that was part of its value.Mr. Fordham: Not unless it could have been sold for more money. It is absolutelyimmaterial.The Referee: I will let him state if it had been treated.A. No, but it was the finest timber.Q. What was the timber? A. Pine.Q. What kind of pine?A. I cannot tell you, there are so many kinds of pine in America.The Referee : I think it was yellow pine. The Witness: I could ascertainexactly. The Referee: Timbers of that sort generally are.Q. Now prior to the time when the tower was taken down did you have aconversation with Mr. Hutchins concerning that?A. Concerning the tower?Q. Concerning the destruction of the tower?A. Concerning the destruction of the tower?Q. Yes.A. No. certainly not. He gave me a friendly assurance that nothing would be donein an unfriendly way.[../Images/main-109.jpg]The Referee: Overruled.Mr. Hawkins: Exception.Mr. Fordham: You may proceed, Mr. Bingham.A. What is the question again, please?The question was read as follows: Have you had any experience, and if so what,in the purchase and sale of machinery?A. Weil, I have not had any in a great many years no, sir. either directpurchase or selling.Q. Well, have you had any experience so that you are qualified to speak as tothe value of machinery?A. Only partially, I think.Q. I call your attention to the testimony of the defendant Tesla. which appearson pages 88 to 161 of the record here inclusive, at the hearing on January 26,1922, and ask you if you have read that testimony?A. Yes, sir, I read that whole paragraph through.Q. Are you acquainted with the premise referred to in the complaint in thisaction and the deed which is in evidence of the premises of the defendant Tesla?Mr. Hawkins: That is objected to as immaterial, irrelevant and incompetent.The Referee. Overruled.Mr. Hawkins: Exception.A. Yes, sir.Q. When did you first visit those premises?Mr. Hawkins: Same objection. The Referee: Same ruling. Mr. Hawkins: Exception.A. Well, it is hard for me to state just when I first-Q. (Interrupting.) Well, as near as you recall?A. I would say about 191.'}.Q. What was the occasion of your visit then?Mr. Hawkins: Same objection.The Referee: Same ruling.Mr. Hawkins: Exception.A. Mr. Boldt held a mortgage on this property and he sent me down there to checkup and go over the condition of it and see what condition it was in.Q. Yes; and how many times were you there?Mr. Hawkins: Same objection. The Referee: Same ruling. Mr. Hawkins: Exception.A. Oh, up until the time that I received that notice from Mr. Hutchins, Ipresume twenty times.Q. The notice to which you refer is the letter of July 10, 1915, of which I showyou a copy?Mr. Hawkins: Same objection.The Referee: Same ruling.Mr. Hawkins: Exception.A. Yes, sir.Q. You haven't the original letter in your possession, have you?A. No, sir; I have not.Q. This is a correct copy?A. Yes, sir.The Referee: May I see that, Mr. Fordham? I do not just bear it in mind.Mr. Fordham: Yes. I offer this letter in evidence.Mr. Hawkins: Objected to as incompetent irrelevant and immaterial and further onthe ground that it is a self-serving declaration: and I further object to itbecause it is not the original document.The Referee: I will take it.Mr. Hawkins: Exception.(Letter marked Plaintiffs’ Exhibit Xo. 8.Q. Mr. Bingham, between the time you first went there to the property in 1913and July 20, 1915, so far us you recall, how many visits did you make to theproperty?Mr. Hawkins: Same objection.The Referee: Same ruling.Mr. Hawkins: Exception.A. I could not say. I used to go there on an average of once or twice a month.Q. During that period?A. During that period.Q. Will you please fell the Court what you found on the property during thosevisits?Mr. Hawkins: Objected to as incompetent, immaterial and irrelevant and certainlycan have no bearing upon the question as to whether these instruments weredelivered as absolute conveyances or as security.The Referee: Overruled.Mr. Hawkins: Exception.A. The first time I went down there I found the windows—well, I should say therewas half a dozen of them that were wide open, and in the big room such as wasused for experimenting and things of that, kind there was probably a dozen orfifteen desks in there and a great many wardrobes, that is closets and things ofthat kind, and among them was a—what you would call a model submarine. Well,this place had practically been wrecked.Mr. Hawkins: I ask that be stricken out.The Referee: Yes, strike out the \"practically been wrecked.\" Just describe itscondition.A. There had been a desk that the drawers had been opened, pulled out and thrownon the floor and all the tops of the desks—they were roll-tops desks—they hadbeen ripped off and thrown on the floor, the doors were ripped off the closetsand the books and emit that was in there, I would say there was four truckloadsof that thrown all over this big room, and I came back and made a report to Mr.Holdt of the condition we found things.Mr. Hawkins: I ask that be stricken out.The Referee: No, the fact that he made a report, let it stand.Mr. Hawkins: Exception.A. (Continuing.) And in two or three days I took a couple of carpenters and wewent down there and nailed up the windows.Q. (Interrupting.) Well, Mr. Ringham, bear in mind the question I was askingyou; the first time you went there in 1913 you did not go down and nail upwindows, did you?A. I did in two or three days.Mr. Hawkins: Is the last part of that answer stricken out on ray motion? TheReferee: Yes.A. (Continuing.) And put in some light pieces of board, such as \"Compo\" boardwhere the glass was gone out, so as to kind of protect the place, as at hissuggestion he thought I better do that.Mr. Hawkins: I ask that be stricken out.The Referee: Strike out the last part.Mr. Hawkins: And also that they nailed up boards.The Referee: No, I will let that stand.Mr. Hawkins: Exception.Q. Proceed. What did you then discover?A. About two weeks later I went down again and I found these things all rippedopen again and the doors open, and I came hack and locked them up the best Icould and went over to see the station agent and they didn't know anything aboutwhat had happened or anything of that kind.Mr. Hawkins: I ask that be stricken out.The Referee: Granted.A. (Continuing.) And in the meantime there had been some of these desks that wasin there that was completely smashed up and taken away, I should say there wasabout half of them gone.Mr. Hawkins: I ask that be stricken out.The Referee: Denied.Mr. Hawkins: Exception.A. (Continuing.) And I went down, I would not say just how soon again, butprobably within a month because I had to go there that often, Mr. Holdt insistedon my going down there and keeping a check on itMr. Hawkins: I ask that be stricken out. The Referee: Strike that out.Q. You may say what you did? A. I continually kept going down there up until thetime I received this notice from Mr. Hutchins.Up until that time-The Referee (interrupting) : That is the exhibit that has just been offered.Mr. Fordham: Yes, Exhibit 8, dated July 20, 1915.Q. Proceed.A. Up until that time they had practically stripped the place of everything:they had stolen off all the railings and everything that might pertain to brassof any description, even the boiler feed pumps they had taken the tops off andtaken the valves and valve seats out; all the toilets, they had taken off thetoilets and taken all the lead pipe back of the toilet and everything that couldbe possibly sold that could be drawn in any kind of a wagon had been taken away,I suppose for junk, that is the only thing they could possibly use it for.Mr. Hawkins: I ask that be stricken out. The Referee: The supposition strikeout.A. (Continuing) The boilers were there, simply the headers and tubes; everythingthat pertained to them were gone, they had stolen and dragged away; the dynamoswere still there, the main part.Mr. Hawkins: I ask the part of the answer in effect had been stolen be strickenout.The Referee: Yes, the characterization stolen we will strike out. The fact thatthey were not there we will let stand.Q. Proceed.A. Well, that had been taken away.The Referee: Well, they were gone?The Witness: They were not taken for ornaments ; they were gone.The Referee: Yes.The Witness: The engines, the main part of the engines were there, that is thefoundation and the fly wheels, because they could not take them away; and someof the big part of the machinery, the different lathes and milling machines andthe main drill-press; all small lathes and motors and everything of that kindwere gone. What had become of them I could not say, but I would say they werestolen. And when I got this notice from Mr. Hutchins I went down then and gotthe notice the same as today. I made the signs up and went down tomorrow and putup the signs, and in about a week or ten days from then I took a couple of hacksand went down there and brought the big machinery awayQ. Just what did you bring away?A. I brought away a large drill-press, milling machine, planer and two lathes.Q. Do you know the value of those articles which you brought away?A. I do not know exactly the value of those things. I have everything yet at theWaldorf, with the exception of the milling machine.Q. Well, was the value a few hundred dollars or was it a great many thousand?Mr. Hawkins: That is objected to on the ground the witness is not qualified.The Referee: Objection sustained.Mr. Fordham: We except.Q. You have the things now, with the exception of the milling machine?A. I have, with the exception of the milling machine, yes, sir.Q. Do you know what became of that?Mr. Hawkins: That is objected to as immaterial.The Referee: Overruled.Mr. Hawkins: Exception.A. That was sold; I don't know just now who it was.Q. You don't know?A. No. but I could find out. I could look the book up and find out who did buyit, but I don't remember.Q. Do you know what was received for it?A. No, I do notQ. I show you Defendants' Exhibit A, a certain bill of sale, and call yourattention to the schedules setting forth the various items purporting to havebeen conveyed by that bill of sale, and ask you to look over those items and totell the Court what, if any of them, were on the property on July 20, 1915?Mr. Hawkins: That is objected to as incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial.The Referee: Overruled.Mr. Hawkins: Exception.A. You want me to start at the top of it?Q. Yes, and go right through it. if you please?A. No. Westinghouse Compound Engine was there.Q. What was its condition? Describe its condition.Mr. Hawkins: That is objected to as immaterial.The Referee: I will take it.Mr. Hawkins: Exception.A. The compound engine was there without any trimming, as I have stated before,everything was stripped.Q. Yes, but-A. (Interrupting.) There wasn't anything left on it.Q. Yes, but repeat your statement as it applies to each of those items?A. Both numbers, 1, the Westinghouse Alternating and the Westinghouse CompoundEngine were there, that is the bodies of the engine; and the direct connecteddouble current generator was there, the 25 kwt the 15 horsepower motor, and No.1 item here, 16235, was not there; the transformers were not there; the tank wasnot there; the truck was not there; Fairbanks Scale was not there;Laidlaw-Dunn-Gordon Pump was there, but the inside was out of it; WestinghouseElectric Motor was not there; milling machine was not there; lathe No. 1 was notthere, there was no tools of any description left there; the work benches werestill there, but nothing on them; vises were gone; Westinghouse Type C2-horsepower motor was gone; Westinghouse Type C inducting motor was gone;Westinghouse Type C 5-horsepower motor was gone; Westinghouse Motor aboutone-quarter horsepower was gone; the three lathes that he mentions here, onlytwo could have been there at most at that time, the two that I have; I don'tknow the names of them.Mr. Hawkins: I ask that be stricken out. Only two could have been there.The Referee: Well, you only got two, is that what you mean?The Witness: Yes, sir.Q. How many were there?A. I don't know how many there was, quite a good many the first time I looked inthere, but I know at the time we took possession from the time I went there,they were all carted away, some truck came in there for some place around thereone day it and I asked the agent there, and he said Mr. Tesla told thisfellow—he runs a garage over there — that he could have them and he took a lotof stuff of that class.Q. When was that?A. 1 think that was along about a year before 1 got that notice.Q. Proceed, please, with the other items.A. Planer made by the Headley people, I see no planer there; planer made byPedrick, no planers at all; no drill-press; that was gone; one large drill-pressthat I have; 36 lockers, they were all ripped to pieces; one testing fan motor-Q. Hawkins (interrupting) : I ask that be stricken out.The Referee: Denied.Mr. Hawkins: Exception.A. (Continuing.) That was gone; telephone and bell wire gone; quantity of leadcable gone; 4 radiators, they were gone; drills, bits, reamers, taps and alltools for milling machines and lathes at present time in storeroom locatedinside workshop, that was all gone; oil tanks, they were ripped up and theyevidently had torn them apart because they wanted to get something inside ofthem, either lead or copper, I don't know which.The Referee: Strike it out.Q. Leave out your conclusions about why they did it; what was the condition ofthem?A. Just ripped to pieces; all the meters and starting boxes and switches had allbeen stripped off, only the bare slates left there; 2 Babcock & Wilcox boilers,everything but the shell and tabes were gone, and feed pumps, just the housingwas left; one hand-The Referee (interrupting) : What do you mean by that?The Witness: Well, it is made out of cast iron, and the insides are brass, thatis the valve seats and valves, they are always brass. They had been taken out.One hand blacksmith's forge was gone; toilets, urinals, wash basins, all rippedto pieces; 7 rheostats, desks, safes, 3 meters, all those things were gone; oneset of storage batteries, tanks, submarine boat, Westinghouse Motor 28292,Westinghouse Motor Type C 5-horsepower No. 62320, Westinghouse Motor Type C5-horsepower No. 22070; 4 high-tension transformers in tanks and switchboards,wiring drums, drafting boards and tools all gone. Chairs, there was two or threeold chairs left there, was all; clocks, no clocks; radiators, no radiators atall.Q. What did you find the condition of the tower to be?Mr. Hawkins: I ask that the entire testimony of this witness concerning theitems mentioned in the Defendants' Exhibit A, I think it was, be stricken fromthe record as incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, especially because thattestimony bears no weight upon the question as to whether that bill of sale wasdelivered as a security or as an absolute conveyance.The Referee: Denied:Mr. Hawkins: Exception.Mr. Fordham: Read the last, question.The question was read by the stenographer.Mr. Hawkins: That is objected to as incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial.The Referee: I will let him describe what he found. Overruled.Mr. Hawkins: Exception.A. The tower was badly rotted, the main supports going up where the stairs were,the great big timbers were rotted out, they were half gone and it is a wonderthey could stand up.Mr. Hawkins: I move to strike that out.The Referee: Yes, the wonder they everMr. Hawkins: Yes.The Witness: The stairs leading up to the top of the ball were half rotted awayso that we could not get up to the ball. I wanted to see what the ball was madeout of and I took a man down there, a rigger, and lie went up about two-thirdsof the way, climbing up over it, and he was so afraid he came back.Mr. Hawkins: I ask that be stricken out.The Referee: That he was afraid and came back. yes. I will let the fact standthat he did not go on up.Mr. Hawkins: I ask the other be stricken out, that the rigger was sent up there.The Referee: Denied.Mr. Hawkins: Exception. And I also move that it be stricken out on the groundthat it is in no sense rebuttal.The Referee: Motion denied.Q. You may tell what the rigger did?A. This big ball on top of the tower, you could not tell what it was made outof. whether it was brass or steel, as the ends of the wires where it had beengrounded had rusted out and blown away, and there was a thousand and one littlewires sticking out in every direction, so you could not see what it was made upof.The Referee: You could not get up?The Witness: You could not get up. You could get up so you could see the fibresof everything up there, you could see it plain enough, but the tower was rottedin no end of places, it had never been taken care of, nothing had ever been doneto it.Mr. Hawkins: I ask that that be stricken outThe Referee: Yes. granted as to the last part.Mr. Fordham : What is granted?The Referee: He said nothing had been done to it.Mr. Hawkins: And I ask also that it be stricken out that the tower had not beentaken care of.The Referee: Granted. Describe its condition.Q. Yes, you may tell the condition of the tower, Mr. Ringham. Was the conditionsecure or insecure?A. Insecure. There was none of the woodwork that have ever been painted, allthat held it together was the big steel plates on the sides of it.Q. As I understood, you say the woodwork was badly rotted out?A. Rotted away, yes, sir.Q. So that the tower in that condition was a menace to anybody passing near it,in view of its insecurity?Mr. Hawkins: That is objected to as calling for a conclusion and a speculation.The Referee: I think so. Mr. Fordham : Not a speculation. The man is an expertin his own line.The Referee: Objection sustained.Mr. Hawkins: I ask that it be stricken out.The Referee: Stricken out.Q. Tell the Court from your own knowledge of structural materials, as anengineer, whether the tower was safe or unsafe, as you found it at that time?Mr. Hawkins: That is objected to.A. Absolutely unsafe.The Referee: Have you sufficiently qualifiedQ. (Interrupting.) Yes or no.Mr. Fordham: Just a moment If the Court please, I object to this on the groundthat no foundation has been laid to qualify this \"witness.The Referee: I will let him answer that question. Overruled.Mr. Fordham: Exception.A. Yes.Q. At that time, to what use could the property be put?Mr. Fordham: That is objected to, if the Court please, on the ground that itcalls for the conclusion of an expert witness, and that there has no foundationbeen laid to qualify Mr. Tesla as an expert on real property value[../Images/main-110.jpg]Mr. Hawkins: No, I have not asked him the value in that respect The Referee: Iwill take it Mr. Fordham : We except (The question was read.)A. The property was expressly built for the transmission of wireless impulses.The Referee: I do not think you understand the question, do you, Doctor? Thequestion was to what use it was fitted, is that right?Mr. Hawkins: Yes.Mr. Fordham: I move to strike out this answer.The Referee: Yes, strike it out.Mr. Hawkins: I will formally except.The Referee: I thought he misunderstood it.A. The use it was built-Q. (Interrupting.) No. Tell to what use it could be put at the time that deedwas made?A. At the time that deed was made it could have been lined as a receivingwireless station.The Referee: Yes.The Witness: Pardon me for adding, it could also have been made use of as atransmitting station, but not to the extent that it could in the fully developedplant.Q. But although it was not fully developed or permanently equipped, it could atthat time have been used as a transmitting station?A. Yes, sir.Q. And us a receiving station?A. As a receiving station.Q. And there is now a large station of a similar kind very near your premises atRocky Point, is there not?Mr. Fordham: That is objected to, if the Court please, as immaterial andirrelevant. The Referee: Overruled. Mr. Fordham: Exception.A. Yes, sir, there is, but it is of incomparably smaller power than mine.Q. Are you familiar with the equipment and structures for the purpose of thereceiving and transmission of wireless messages?A. Yes, sir, I am.Q. What has been your experience in that line, Doctor?A. I have worked for thirty years on the art and have given all of thefundamental principles to it; and during at least twenty years I have beenmaking apparatus of that kind and experimenting with it.Q. Have you been making apparatus of that kind for sale?A. Yes and no. 1 did attempt to start manufacturing several times, but could notfind sufficient encouragement, because at the time that I started the art wasnot sufficiently developed for the general public to have faith in it. I wasahead of the time, and that was the only reason why it was impracticable tostart manufacturing.Q. Have you invented and put on the market electrical apparatus for use inconnection with wireless operations?A. Yes, sir.Q. At the time the deed was given, what was the value of the premises at RockyPoint in their condition at that time for the purpose of wireless receiving andtransmitting uses?Mr. Fordham: I object to that, if the Court please, on the ground there is noproper foundation laid to qualify this witness to speak of the commercial orfinancial value of the property at that time or at any other time. As to thescientific value or possibilities of it, he has already been interrogated. Andit is objected to, if that is the point of the question, that is objected to onthe ground it is needless repetition.Mr. Hawkins: I submit, if your Honor please, the witness is qualified to answerthis specific question, and has shown it by his testimony here.The Referee: I don't understand, Mr. Hawkins. Are you asking him to testify asto the value of the land?Mr. Hawkins: No, sir; 1 am asking him to testify as to the value of the entirepremises, including the land and the buildings, but particularly the buildings.Mr. Fordham: Well, commercially and financially what is their value? And heknows nothing about it.The Referee: I will overrule your objection and take it.Mr. Fordhani: Well, we except, if the Court please. I particularly call yourHonor's attention to the fact that the testimony shows that the witness couldnot have known, because he had not been there for months before.The Referee: I will take it for what it is worth.Mr. Fordhani: We except.The Referee: Answer the question, Mr. Tesla, if you can.A. At the time the deed was given a fair estimate of the value of the propertywould have been something like $350,000, because the income-Q. Never mind all that, you have answered my question.The Referee: You mean by that, taking in the land and your scientificdevelopment on it?The Witness: No; I estimate it on the basis of earning power as a transmittingand receiving plant for the purpose for which it was made.The Referee: Had it ever earned anything at that time?The Witness: Yes, but because I was carrying on the plan which would ultimatelyhave yielded |25,000 a day income, but at that time-Q. (Interrupting.) Never mind, don't go on with that.Mr. Fordham: I move to strike out the answer on the ground that the witness'explanation shows he is not qualified to make an estimate, and that his estimateas made is not based on any sound financial or legal or other ground.The Referee: I am inclined to agree with you, but—I don't see, Mr. Hawkins, thatthat is admissible.Mr. Hawkins: I submit that that is admissible. The man shows he has worked inthat line of business for many years and knows the value of that equipment forthat purpose.The Referee: If you want it to stand, I will let it stand.Mr. Hawkins: Yes, sir I do.Mr. Fordham: We except.The Referee: The objection is overruled.Mr. Fordham: Our motion is denied to strike out?The Referee: Yes, motion denied.Mr. Fordham: We except.Q. Did that condition which you have just described, and those values, obtain atthe time the bill of sale was given?A. Oh, at the time the bill of sale was given the property was very much morevaluable, it was worth—it could have earned at least five times as much as theTuckerton plant on Long Island, and they had an income of something like fortythousand or fifty thousand dollars a year.The Referee: Well, it could have earned if it had been completed. Now, was it inthat position to earn?The Witness: I must explain it. If it had been completed, it could have earned$25,000 a day, but in that time in the state it was, if it had not been for mypushing the plant to come one hundred thousand or one hundred and twenty-fivethousand dollars a year.The Referee: What was it earning at that time?The Witness: It was earning nothing.Mr. Fordham: If the Court please, I move to strike out this last answer on theground that it is contradictory to former testimony, because it appears that thedeed and bill of sale were both given the same day, and it is impossible therecould have been a wide difference in value between the few minutes when the deedwas given and the bill of sale was given.The Referee: I will let it stand. The Witness: May I explain?Q. Yes, explain.A. Pardon me then, I did not understand the question. When I was asked when thedeed was given, I had in mind when I first placed the property with Mr. Boldt,that was the valuation at that time.Q. That was the first mortgage, wasn't it?A. Oh, at the time the deed was given, now I understand better. Yes, that was1915, the property was worth very much more because the art had been developed,the power stations had multiplied, the receivers had multiplied and where Iwould have had a hundred customers, then I would have thousands.Q. Doctor, when you speak of the value; at the time the bill of sale was given,do you mean the value at the time you first made a mortgage to Mr. Boldt?A. No, sir, I mean at the time that the deed was given, the property was worthmore than $350,000.Q. Yes, but what did you have in mind as the value when you spoke of the valueas of the time the bill of sale was given?A. I had in mind the value at the time I gave the mortgage to Mr. Boldt.Q. Yes, the first mortgage?A. Yes, the first mortgage.Q. Upon the property to Mr. Boldt?A. Yes, sir.Q. Doctor, the property was developed for the purpose and use of a commercialwireless station, was it not?A. Yes, sir.Q. And so far as you know, it had no particular value for any other purpose, didit?A. Yep, it might have been used for an electrical power plant for distribution.Q. Yes.A. In fact, the proposition was made to me at one time for that purpose.Q. But looking at the situation from the local real estate market, it had noparticular market value for any other purpose than that of wireless telegraphy,did it?A. It might have as a factory building.Q. But you are predicating your statement of values upon its uses for thepurposes of wireless telegraphy, are you not?A. For the purposes of the wireless art, yes.Q. Wireless art?A. Yes, in all its numerous applications.Q. Do you remember Mr. Bingham saying that he went down to the property?A. Yes, sir, I remember.Defendants’ Exhibit B.Know all Men by these Presents, That I, William N.
