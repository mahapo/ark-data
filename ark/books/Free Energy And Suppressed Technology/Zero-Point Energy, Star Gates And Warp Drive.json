It addresses and answers the following questions: Why classical curved spacetime at all? (Sakharov, 1967) What is the “dark energy” that is most of the mass of the universe invisible to electromagnetic detector s yet detectable gravitationally? Why is the universe’s expansion rate speeding up rather than slowing down? What is Kip Thorne’s “exotic matter” needed to keep traversable wormholes open? Is vacuum propulsion of unconventional flying objects 2 possible in principle? 3 In the course of answering these questions I derive the detailed nature of the coherence mechanism of the zero point energy vacuum fluctuations. What we have is an electrically neutral spin 0 Bose-Einstein condensate 4 of mainly virtual electron-positron pairs. I derive explicit formulas for the parameters of the effective potential of this condensed phase of quantum vacuum without which classical gravity could not even come into being. These formulas show implicitly how the quantum phase transition leading to inflation happens. They also suggest how to control the inflation process on a small scale. The implications of such a development are, of course, profound. ______________________________________________________________________ The first obvious fact from this book by K. A. Milton is that the widespread claim by the New Age “Cargo Cult” 5 Alternative Energy and UFO Disclosure Movement that the theories of Hal Puthoff mainly, also Bernie Haisch and Alfonso Rueda secondarily, are some kind of panacea breakthrough already here for world energy problems is “not even wrong” 6 without any scientific foundation. Casimir force effects are very tiny. Their most immediate applications would be to tiny nanometer scale machines. The UFO explanation by Eric Davis at MUFON 2001 is completely bogus, although the alleged phenomena cited in his paper may not be. 7   2 Book by Paul Hill a USG aeronautical e ngineer in 40’s and 50’s is reliable. 3 In the sense of Alcubierre’s warp drive on a free float timelike geodesic without harmful g-forces. 4 Classical curved spacetime is supported by a giant coherent quantum wave (or qubit field) inside the physical vacuum. 5 Richard Feynman’s famous talk at Cal Tech on “Cargo Cult Pseudoscience”. 6 Wolfgang Pauli’s nasty comment on bad physics. 7 http://198.63.56.18/pdf/davis_mufon2001.pdf"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Zero Point Energy by Jack Sarfatti, 3/23/2002, 3:53 PM, Page 3 of 32 Connection of zero point energy to intermolecular V an der W aals forces.

I solve this problem in this paper. I should give som e credit to Giovanni Modanese whose work with real superconductors, not the virtual one in the superfluid quantum vacuum , gave m e one of the key ideas for this solution. Another key idea was Hagen Kleinert’s “solid state” form alism for general relativity in term s of a “world crystal lattice” with curvature and torsion as string topological defects of disclination and dislocation respectively. I also should give credit to Hal Puthoff and Bernie Haisch whose suggestions on the zero point origin of inertia and gravity seem ed so silly and wrong headed to m e that I decided to solve the Sakharov problem that m otivated them correctly. Basically none of the Pundits, not just Hal and Bernie, had the correct qualitative picture of the actual quantum vacuum although fragm ents like QCD gluon condensates were in the air pointing in the right direction.

These ferm ions also have two spin states and the electron-positron com plex is described by a 4-com ponent Dirac spinor, which at low energies lim its to a 2-com ponent Pauli spinor describing only the electron. I m ean he re, of course, real quanta on the m ass shell! Is the virtual tachyon superfluid inside the physical quantum vacuum a com posite of virtual photons and virtual electron-positron pairs? First, what about virtual photons form ing Bo se-Einstein condensates, will that do? NO! Why? Because those are what real detect able classical near induction electric and magnetic fields from m otors and transform ers etc already are.

The electron quantum vacuum is an electrically neutral plasm a of locally random virtual electron- positron fluctuations.

This quintessent quantum spectral shift is a m uch bigger effect than one gets from the (G/c 4 )T μν term ! That' s what UFOs if real do! So they say. Note that Λ L p 2 = 1 - L p 3 | ψ | 2 Where | ψ | 2 = 10 99 Bose-Einstein condensed virtual electron-positron spin zero electrically neutral pairs per cubic centim eter.
