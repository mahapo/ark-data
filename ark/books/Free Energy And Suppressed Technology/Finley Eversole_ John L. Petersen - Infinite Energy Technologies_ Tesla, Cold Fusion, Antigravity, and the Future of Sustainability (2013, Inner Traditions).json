PetersenWe are living in unprecedented times, but, of course, everyone has said that atany given period in the past. Nevertheless, technically it’s true. Every year isa fresh, new one that might seem familiar, but essentially is not. Unless allchange could be eliminated, we’re necessarily producing new realities at everymoment that have never existed before.Parallels with historical times, at best, therefore, reflect only a very roughcongruity with an earlier time that certainly did not have the technology,communications, ideas, and values of the present. So, sure, these areunprecedented times.But in important ways, this time it is really unprecedented. There is alwayschange, but the rate of change that we are experiencing these days has neverbeen seen before—and it is accelerating exponentially. That means that ifpresent trends continue, every week or month or year going forward will producesignificantly more change than the previous one. Humans have never experiencedthis rate of change before.Let me give you an example. Futurist Ray Kurzweil, in his important book TheSingularity Is Near, cataloged the rate of technological change in manydifferent dimensions. His bottom-line assessment was that our present centurywill see one thousand times the technological change of the past century—duringwhich the automobile, airplane, Internet, and nuclear wars emerged.Transportation rates went from that limited by the gallop of a horse tochemically propelled spacecraft that traverse more than fifteen thousand milesin an hour. And, of course, we visited the moon.Now, think about what one thousand times that change would be. What kind of aworld might show up in one hundred years if we live through one thousand timesthe change of the twentieth century? Well, you can’t reasonably imagine it. Noone can. The implications are so great that you are immediately driven intoscience fiction land, where all of the current “experts” just dismiss you with awave of a hand.Try it. With two compounded orders of magnitude change over the period of acentury, you could literally find yourself in a place where humans didn’t eatfood or drink water (which would eliminate agriculture). They might be able toread minds telepathically and be able to visually read the energetic fields ofanyone they looked at—immediately knowing about the person’s past experiences,present feelings, and honesty of statements. Just that, of course, wouldeliminate all politicians and advertising!But maybe, as some sources seriously suggest, you could manifest physical thingsat will—just by focusing your mind. Think of what that would do to the notion ofeconomics as we know it. In this handful of future human characteristics, you’dalso be able to transport yourself wherever you wanted by thinking yourselfthere. In that world, no one would know what airplanes were.You might think that what I’ve just described is far-fetched, and if so, thenyou just made my point. Even though there are credible analysts and observerswho seriously propose that the above changes will happen in far less time than acentury, change of this sort is more than we can reasonably understand andvisualize. Just to parse it down to the next decade—seventy to eighty times thechange of the past century—boggles the mind!Well, it’s my business to think about these things, and even I have a hard timevisualizing how this all might turn out, just because it is so severe anddisruptive, but I can tell you a bit about what a revolution of this magnitudemeans.First of all, it means that we are in a transition to a new world—a newparadigm. All of this change has direction, and it is leading us to a new worldthat operates in very different ways.Second, in this kind of shift, things change fundamentally. We’re not talkingabout adjustments around the edge. The only way to support and sustain this rateof change is if there are extraordinary breakthroughs across almost every sectorof human activity.Already, for example, there are serious efforts afoot to make it possible tocontrol many processes with only your thoughts, and the ability to make physicalthings invisible has made great strides. In a very short time it will bepossible to capture, store, and search through everything you say in any public(or even private) environment and extract from it at will. As this booksuggests, unlimited energy and the control of gravity are both in the works.Third, the tempo accelerates—things change more quickly. The rate of change isincreasing, so bigger things are coming faster. And as they converge, theseextraordinary events and driving forces interact and cause chain reactions,generating unanticipated consequences. There’s a pretty good chance that theinventors of Facebook and Twitter didn’t think they were going to be part ofbringing down governments, and it’s certainly clear that most governments didn’tanticipate that this new technology might threaten their ability to govern.Fourth, much of the change will therefore be strange and unfamiliar. When veryrapid, profound, interconnected forces are all in play at the same time, theunanticipated consequences are likely to move quite quickly into threatening thehistorical and conventional understanding of how things work. Our situation isexacerbated by the fact that significant cosmic changes are influencing thebehavior of the sun and therefore major systems (like the climate) on ourplanet. These are contextual reorganizations that are so large and unprecedentedthat the underlying systems—agriculture, economy, government, and such—will notbe able to respond effectively.Because of that, human systems will have a hard time adapting to the change.Research has shown that civil and social systems (legal system, education,government, families, etc.) reconfigure themselves thousands of times slowerthan the rate of technological change that we are experiencing.Therefore, it is inevitable that the old systems will collapse. They will nothave the capability to change fast enough, and in some cases (like the globalfinancial system) have structurally run out of the ability to sustain the statusquo.So, lastly, a new paradigm will emerge from all of this upheaval that only seemschaotic because we’re in the middle of it. Something new will arise to fill thevacuum left by the implosion of the legacy systems. If history gives us anyindicator of what the new world will be, it is certain that it will be radicallydifferent from the world that we all now find familiar.So, what does that all mean relative to this book?In physical terms, there is no more fundamental and basic influence on the waywe live and behave than the availability and form of energy that we use. Everyaspect of our lives, food, clothing, shelter, and transportation—and thereforeevery derivative activity (work, government, recreation, etc.)—changes when theaffordable source of energy changes. The modern world has been directly enabledby the discovery, development, and availability of petroleum, for example. Whenthat era ends, many other ways of doing things will also necessarily end.Thomas Kuhn, influential philosopher of science, famously stated that newparadigms in science emerge only when the leadership of the old generation dies,leaving space for the emergence of the new ideas. What he was saying is that theincumbent system fights new ideas—regardless of whether it is a system ofscience, education, or spirituality. In all cases, the current generation hasvested interests (reputations, income streams, influence, etc.) in the presentway things operate. These individuals and organizations have devoted a greatdeal of time and wealth to building and shaping the present paradigm and wouldlose a great deal if their ideas, processes, investments, and infrastructurewere suddenly deemed obsolete. Like white corpuscles rushing to attack invadinggerms that are advancing through a break in the integrity of the skin, thosewith reputations and resources immediately respond to threatening new ideas thatcould potentially upset what they have worked so hard to put in place.But Kuhn was describing the dynamics of evolutionary change—change from within.What we’re experiencing is revolutionary change that is driven as much byuncontrollable externalities as by internal system dynamics. If rapid climatechange sweeps away the assumptions of the past, everyone will have to rethinkhow things are done. If we begin running out of oil, everyone will be in thebusiness of finding new energy sources. And similarly, if the financial systemcollapses of its own weight, space will quickly be made for new ideas, and theseare just conventional scenarios. If alien life comes by to introduce itself orsolar cosmic rays turn on strings of dormant human DNA, suddenly providing uswith radical new capabilities—well, all bets are off and new ideas will reallyprevail!That’s what I think is happening. We are fully into the most significant globalrevolution in the history of our species. We are about to watch our world turnsideways as the result of the collision of both conventional and unconventionalforces, and one big story in that shift will be energy. That’s why this book isimportant.In many cases, the new ideas that rise to fill the void produced by large-scalechange have their origins long before the environment finally presents theopening that allows their proliferation. (Interesting new ideas aboutalternative financial systems and economies, for example, are now being formedin anticipation of the collapse of the present financial system). More thanlikely, the system fights those insurgent concepts when they first show up,finding them threatening. Nevertheless, over the years some small groupscontinue to develop and refine the ideas, trying to ready them for an opening.The coming months and years are going to present such an opportunity.As mentioned earlier, the nature of this revolution is that there will bewidespread, fundamental breakthroughs. They are already happening in every areaof science, technology, and society. Ultimately, for the system to operate withsome stability, the big changes will migrate throughout the organism so thatthere is an internal consistency within the interface, communication, andoperation of the subsystems of the larger network. Finding that equilibrium isthe process that we will be experiencing during the near future. Asbreakthroughs happen in certain spaces, they will force other areas to operatedifferently. If they are unable to efficiently adapt, those threatenedinstitutions or ideas or processes will fail, and new ideas, institutions, andprocesses will show up that fulfill the required function (e.g. economy,government), but in a way that is necessarily compatible with the big, forcingchange that precipitated the whole thing.This book provides a perspective on how parts of the system will reconfigurethemselves in the near future. At the same time, it provides a window on thepast that made this future possible. It tells the stories of the iconic,out-of-the-box thinkers and inventors who first visualized this time when theirideas would be part of a revolution that would change the way many billions ofpeople think and live.I have been waiting for this book for a long time—a single source that wouldallow me to both learn about these amazing men who were plugged into who knowswhere and thought like no one else before or since and, at the same time, gain athoughtful, integrated perspective about how all of their amazing work could, infact, rapidly change the world in which we live. It is a primer on one of themost powerful collections of forces that are converging to enable the emergenceof a new world. It is very timely."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONFinley Eversole, Ph.D. Focused, determined, enlightened public opinion is the most potent force in theworld. It has no equal but has been little used.DJWHAL KHULDying civilisations are present in their final forms whilst new civilisationsare emerging; cycles come and go and in the going overlap.DJWHAL KHULOver the past hundred years, according to Thomas E. Bearden—a leading thinker inthe free-energy and antigravity fields—there have been at least seventysuccessfully working free-energy technologies that could have replaced our useof fossil fuels and nuclear energy, met the world’s energy needs, and given us apollution-free environment. Yet every one of these technologies has beensuppressed by the energy cartels, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. PatentOffice, the World Trade Organization, and businesses with vested economicinterests in maintaining the status quo.In addition to the alternative energy technologies discussed in this volume,there were others I would like to have included, but given the sorry history ofsuppression of free and low-cost energy solutions that could address our globalenergy needs far into the future, the inventors were fearful of the suppressionpublicity might bring to their work. Simply and succinctly stated, we know howto solve the world’s energy problems and could probably do so within ten totwenty years. But nothing is likely to be accomplished until the public iseducated and demands the application of new energy solutions—many of whichalready exist but are hidden away in “black” military and governmental programs.We’re told that the energy technology hidden in some of these programs is atleast one hundred years in advance of anything to which the public has access!Yet it is our money that has paid for these revolutionary energy technologies.They are rightfully ours!A civilization based on limited resources cannot endure. It is time we focusedon technologies that will give us access to the infinite energy hidden in natureand available to us everywhere on the planet. Wind and solar energy technologieshave their part to play, but just over the horizon are other, far less expensivetechnologies that do not depend on seasons and locations, do not scar theenvironment, and can meet all of humanity’s energy needs for as long as theEarth exists. The public needs to know of these technologies and demand thatthey be implemented.Using sound alone, the late-nineteenth-century Philadelphia inventor JohnWorrell Keely tapped into a limitless source of energy—apparently what we todaycall the zero point energy field. In the early twentieth century, Djwhal Khulmade the following prediction:The study of sound and the effect of sound . . . will put into man’s hands atremendous instrument in the world of creation. Through the use of sound thescientist of the future will bring about his results; through sound, a new fieldof discovery will open up; the sound which every form in all kingdoms of naturegives forth will be studied and known and changes will be brought about and newforms developed through its medium. One hint only may I give here and that is,that the release of energy in the atom is linked to this new coming science ofsound.This brings me to the next important point: we are now moving into the AquarianAge—a 2,100-year period during which a shared group consciousness and growingsense of our One Humanity will steadily replace the old “leader-and-followers”mentality of the Piscean Age we are rapidly leaving behind. The demand fordemocracy and freedom from dictators that gave birth to the Arab Spring and thegrowing demands for economic justice on the part of the Occupy Wall Streetmovement are examples of this emerging group consciousness. Increasingly,millions of human beings will together demand enlightened change, leading to thefreedom, justice, and welfare of all our fellow citizens on Earth.In addition to the Occupy Wall Street movement, with its demands for economicjustice, we are already seeing the Occupy movement spread to other areas ofconcern, such as the Occupy Our Food movement, demanding farmers’ rights andopposing the spread of dangerous genetically modified foods; the OccupyEducation movement, demanding improvements in our educational systems; and theOccupy Our Environment movement for environmental protection.With this volume, Infinite Energy Technologies, we’re calling for an Occupy OurEnergy Solutions movement to demand the research and application of new energytechnologies that can radically transform our global economy by providingeveryone on Earth with unlimited energy, drastically reduce global poverty andallow the rise of poor nations, protect our environment with pollution-freesources of energy, end political and military conflicts over limited resources,and bring about a world of peace, stability, and economic justice. All this ispossible but will only come about when enough people demand it.The emerging group consciousness we’ve seen in the Arab Spring and Occupymovements provides us with a first clear glimpse into the workings of auniversal law that will be increasingly employed by humanity during the comingage—an age I like to think of as the creative age as it will be an age ofcreative discoveries and creative outpourings unlike anything heretofore seen onEarth. No important field of human endeavor will be unaffected.Known to many as the law of invocation and evocation, what this law teaches usis that both Nature and Spirit respond to humanity only when we make demands onthem. When we seek to carry out our hopes and dreams and demand the best inourselves—and this applies equally to us as individuals and to humanity as awhole—a response will always be forthcoming, one that corresponds in nature andpotency to our demands. Where no demands are made, no responses are forthcoming.Because humanity is naturally invocative, when large numbers of people areunited in making the same demands, the potency of their united invocative appealis greatly magnified, and so are the results. This law is an example of theworking of the law of attraction. One law always holds true: like attracts like.This law of invocation and evocation is predicated on an equally fundamentaltruth: energy follows thought. I like to quote Oscar Wilde, who said, “To thinka thing is to cause it to begin to be.” The end of the cold war in 1991 providesa good example of this process. President Ronald Reagan took credit for endingthe cold war, attributing it to his massive U.S. military buildup, which theSoviet Union could not match. However, for three consecutive years prior to theend of the cold war, hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of people allacross the United States and in Europe met in groups on New Year’s Eve andprayed and meditated simultaneously, calling for an end to the cold war. I tookpart in one gathering in Atlanta and two in Milwaukee. All creative processesinvolve three stages or the interactions of three energies. Shortly after thethird gathering, in which the mass consciousness of hundreds of thousands ofmembers of the human family invoked an end to the war, it was suddenly over.Since like only gives birth to like, I’ve always believed it was this outpouringof a demand for peace by so many people on two continents, and not Reagan’smilitary buildup, that brought an end to the cold war.Here you have an example of group consciousness and the law of invocation andevocation at work. The Arab Spring and Occupy movements are the most recentexamples of the working of this law. As the law of invocation and evocation isbetter understood, it will be systematically employed by humanity at selecttimes of the year to effect positive global change along predetermined lines.Social media and the Internet will allow us to synchronize our efforts. Theresult will be a rapid acceleration of global change in line with the hopes andaspirations of all peoples. The more understanding we have of what’s possible,the more rapidly change will come—as with the solving of our energy problems.Our first requirement is knowledge, followed by the demand for these new energytechnologies. Once these criteria are employed, we can hope for rapid, positiveglobal change beneficial to everyone. The 99 percent can truly change the world!We only need to agree on what that vision of the world should be.A bird’s-eye overview of the chapters in this volume will aid prospectivereaders and users of Infinite Energy Technologies to quickly grasp its broad,innovative themes. Each author is a leading expert in his or her field. Thesolutions to major global problems presented here are not those with which youare likely familiar—those reported in the media and debated by politicians andbig business. In these chapters we are at the frontiers of thought, discovery,and invention.BACK TO THE FUTURE: THE LEGACY OF THE VISIONARIESThe next five chapters focus on five of the great geniuses of the world whocould have taken humanity much further into the future than we have chosen togo. Some of their work has been lost or ignored, much has been classified orsuppressed, and their names are all but forgotten in the annals of science. Bytaking another look at their legacies and restoring to them the stature theydeserve, we take a small step toward reclaiming our own dignity and recoveringthe greater destiny that they foresaw and wanted for humanity.Marc J. Seifer, in “Nikola Tesla,” shows us the mind of the extraordinary geniusto whom we owe most of the electrical inventions of the world we live in—evencell phones and the Internet. We will also read about the efforts made by hisenemies to subvert or claim credit for his world-transforming achievements whiledoing their best to remove his name from the historical records—and very nearlysucceeding.Theo Paijmans, in “John Worrell Keely,” provides a brief biography of thismysterious late-nineteenth-century Philadelphia inventor, the first pioneer offree energy and an explorer of the hidden power of music, said by some to havebeen hundreds or thousands of years ahead of his time. The author of the onlybiography of Keely, Paijmans updates his book here with new information andnewly discovered photos.Callum Coats, in “Viktor Schauberger,” gives us a fascinating study of the manysecrets of water uncovered by this Austrian water pioneer. These include thesignificance of water temperature, how flowing water behaves and why, theimplications of vortex motion for reengineering our world, and the damagingeffects of modern water engineering and water treatment on our environment andhealth.Gerry Vassilatos, in “Royal Raymond Rife,” tells the heartbreaking life story ofa gentle and brilliant man who found the cure to cancer and hundreds of otherdiseases, only to have his life’s work suppressed by the American MedicalAssociation and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. His work still hasrevolutionary implications for the future of human health without the use ofdrugs and surgery—hence its suppression.Jeane Manning, in “T. Townsend Brown,” introduces a physicist whosebreakthroughs with flying disc airfoils in the 1950s pointed to fuel-less spacetravel—this brilliant man’s gift to humanity. Instead, the antigravitytechnology known as electrogravitics was classified and hidden. We again havethe story of revolutionary advances in knowledge ignored and suppressed by thescientific establishment.INFINITE ENERGY: A NEW SCIENCE FOR A POLLUTION-FREE WORLDWhile public debate about alternative energy has focused primarily on wind andsolar power, far more dramatic and far-reaching solutions already exist or arein exploratory stages. The public knows little about these alternative energysources, which energy cartels and governments have intentionally and sometimesbrutally suppressed. These newer solutions, such as energy extracted from water,energy captured from the background energy of the cosmos (called zero pointenergy, the vacuum, or etheric energy), energy generated by magnetic fields,vortex energy, and cold fusion—while often defying the precepts of familiarphysics—offer far more complete and long-term solutions to our energy problems.And all are locally available and environmentally friendly, producing nopollution.Brian O’Leary, in “The Sustainable Technology Solution Revolution,” sees theroots of ecocide and genocide in the control of the economy by the power elite.He urges greater public knowledge of and support for free energy and clean watertechnologies, which could deliver far-reaching global changes very rapidly toour world. He also appeals for an Age of Wisdom to replace our current age ofgreed.Jeane Manning, in “Power for the People—from Water,” surveys the leadingbreakthrough technologies in the free-energy field based on extracting powerfrom water. Inventors and a few scientists are learning to release large amountsof useful energy from small volumes of water without radioactivity or otherpollutants. Some of these new systems can clean polluted waters while generatingelectric power.Steven Greer’s “Imagine a Free-Energy Future for All of Humanity” presents uswith evidence of what a real future for the Earth can look like with limitlessfree nonpolluting energy available at the location of use, giving humanity theability to end global poverty once and for all. He also points out thatantigravity technology, which already exists in publicly financed blackprograms, would make interstellar travel a reality for humanity.Theodore Loder, in “Energy Technologies for the Twenty-first Century,” reviewsmajor research into antigravity technology, including testimony from insiders tohighly secret military-industrial programs who say we already have advancedantigravity vehicles reverse-engineered from UFOs. Also citing zero point energyas a source of non-polluting energy that will permanently free humanity fromfossil fuels, he writes, “Because antigravity and its allied zero point energytechnologies potentially offer the world a future of unlimited, non-pollutingenergy it has been suppressed” because free energy is seen as a threat to theglobal economy (read, “the energy cartels”).John A. Thomas Jr. and John R. R. Searl, in “Harnessing Nature’s Free Energy,”detail the discovery and working of John’s Searl Effect Generator (SEG), aunique magnetic device that extracts free energy from space continuously,generating electricity. Since the 1950s, the SEG has awaited public demand forits use. At high speeds, it creates its own gravitational field and becomes agravity-free device usable for space travel.Edmund Storms, in “Cold Fusion,” tells us the reality of cold fusion has nowbeen established beyond a doubt and represents a new phenomenon in relation tothe chemical environment and nuclear reaction. Delays in research due to itsinitial rejection mean there are still problems to be solved, but cold fusionpromises to be a valuable source of low-cost energy in the future.Thomas Valone, in “Zero Point Energy Can Power the Future,” gives us a detailedscientific look at the current state of research into zero point energy as asource of free energy. Zero point energy, also known as the energy of the vacuumstate, is the background energy of the universe that, as Valone notes, “breatheslife into every atom, sustaining its size and shape and it certainly isrenewable.”Infinite Energy Technologies is what I hope will be the first in a series ofvolumes under my editorship that seek to bring before a larger public answersand solutions to many of our global problems in the areas of energy, theeconomy, the environment, health, food, agriculture, global change, and designsfor the future.Several well-known authors have been calling for “a new story” capable ofguiding humanity through the profound global transition we have entered,preparatory to the birth of a new age and civilization, a higher consciousness,and a deeper social interconnectedness. An essential part of this story for meis the Return of Prometheus and the liberating of the creative energies of thecoming age. As I glance into the future, I see ahead a long unfolding age ofcreative outpouring and accomplishment in every field of human endeavor,dwarfing in comparison all the great achievements of humanity’s past. In Greekmythology, Prometheus is said to have stolen fire from heaven as a gift tohumanity and, in so doing, given birth to human civilization and all the artsand sciences. For this crime against the gods, Prometheus was chained to a rockand made to suffer by having his liver devoured daily by an eagle. Eventually,however, a human hero—Hercules—succeeded against all odds in setting Prometheusfree. We’re never told what Prometheus did following his liberation.The myth of Prometheus is a fitting one for our time. Today, we can retell hisstory as that of a liberated and wiser Prometheus coming to the aid of asuffering, yet more evolved humanity. The new Prometheus is arriving just as thehuman family is entering a period of profound transformation, faced with criseson all sides and the need for a new awakening of its creative and spiritualpowers. It is such a time as ours that calls for Prometheus’ much-neededcreative fires. As we take charge of his divine fire, we are also called to theheroic and Herculean task of rebuilding civilization along new and wiser lines,inspired by a new vision of compassionate inclusiveness, which recognizes thathumanity is becoming and forevermore will be One Humanity—unified inconsciousness, though richly diverse in its creative contributions to therebirth of the world.Perhaps these new “fires of heaven” stand for the fires of freedom liberating usfrom false gods, outworn beliefs, and faltering institutions. They are above allfires of purification and transformation. Perhaps they also represent thediscovery of the new energies needed to rebuild the world that a more awakenedscience will increasingly unleash on Earth in the coming age. These Prometheanfires are a sacred trust, not to be exploited for selfish ends.This inflow of new creative fire means we can re-create our world based on awiser vision of what it means to be truly human. The liberation of the creativeimagination is an essential part of our “new story.” Infinite EnergyTechnologies picks up one thread of this story and gives us a glimpse intohumanity’s future. It offers us a new energy paradigm and a new vision of apollution-free world, if right choices are made. Our destiny depends on choosingwisely."},{"pageContent":"PART 1> Back to the Future> > image [images/9781594775093_03.jpg]> > THE LEGACY OF THE VISIONARIES> > The resistance to a new idea is in proportion to the idea’s importance.> > BRIAN O’LEARY> > Let the future tell the truth and evaluate each one according to his work and> accomplishments.

Seifer, Ph.D. The scientific breakthroughs of Albert Einstein, the inventions of Nikola Tesla,the great ventures of Andrew Carnegie’s U.S. Steel, and Sergey Brin’s Google,Inc.—all this was possible because of immigrants.PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, JULY 1, 2010The day when we shall know exactly what “electricity” is, will chronicle anevent probably greater, more important than any other recorded in the history ofthe human race. The time will come when the comfort, the very existence,perhaps, of man will depend upon that wonderful agent.NIKOLA TESLA, 1893Time makes more converts than reason.THOMAS PAINEOn July 10, 2006, the scientific community celebrated Nikola Tesla’s 150thbirthday with a special conference in Belgrade, Serbia, and a new Tesla statuedesigned by Les Drysdale. It was unveiled at Niagara Falls on the Canadian side,near Horseshoe Falls. Fifty years earlier, on Tesla’s 100th birthday, this greatSerbian inventor was posthumously awarded his finest honor when theInternational Electrotechnical Committee designated the name “tesla” as themeasure of magnetic flux density (MRIs are measured in teslas). From that pointon, Tesla could stand beside such other scientific giants as Ampere, Angstrom,Curie, Fermi, Hertz, Volta, and Watt.image [images/9781594775093_003.jpg]Figure 1.1. The Tesla statue at Niagara Falls, unveiled July 10, 2006TESLA’S EARLY LIFE IN CROATIANikola Tesla was born in 1856, in the heat of the summer during a lightningstorm, about twenty miles east of the Adriatic Sea in the small hamlet ofSmiljan in Croatia. Located along a great plane with the Dinaric Alps in thedistance, the Tesla home and nearby church sat against a large protective hill.This site enabled young Niko to view many lightning storms as they rode alongthe Alps or swept across the plain to engulf the hamlet.The son of a Serbian Orthodox priest, Tesla was the fourth of five children,three girls and two boys, with his brother Dane (pronounced “Dah-nay”), sevenyears older, being the oldest child. Tesla’s father was descended from militaryand clergymen, and his father’s brother was a mathematics professor; his mother,whose family name was Mandic, came from a more prominent family. Her maternalgrandfather was given the French Medal of Honor by Napoleon himself in 1811. Oneof her brothers was a field marshal in the imperial Austro-Hungarian Army, andshe had an Uncle Petar Mandic, who was the regional bishop of Bosnia.image [images/9781594775093_004.jpg]Figure 1.2. The home and farm in Smiljan where Tesla was bornGreat things were expected of the older brother, Dane, who, like young Niko, wasgifted with a photographic memory and great powers of visualization. A creek ranby their house and small farm, and Dane taught Niko how to build a water wheelin it. He also taught him how to shoot crows with a popgun. These two children’stoys would become the seeds of two of Tesla’s inventions: (a) the greathydroelectric turbines and power system that, even today, provide a vastpercentage of the clean, renewable electrical energy for the world, and (b)Tesla’s controversial particle beam gun, a secret weapon given to severalcountries, including the United States, just as World War II was beginning.In about 1861, a great tragedy befell the Tesla family when Dane died in anaccident with the family horse, an Arabian steed that had saved the father oneprevious winter in a run-in Mr. Tesla had with a pack of wolves. This eventcaused great upheaval within the family, so much so that they moved severalmiles away to the bustling town of Gospic, where Niko, now about five, couldbegin his schooling.This event was important for many reasons. It caused the family to move awayfrom their idyllic farm and probably created a rift in Tesla’s relationship withhis mother, who no doubt favored Dane for the simple reason that he was thefirst child, her first son, and a youngster she knew for seven long years beforeNiko was even born. Later in life, in 1899 when Tesla expressed great interestin contacting extraterrestrials, it is possible that subconsciously he was alsotrying to connect with his long-dead brother.Another important aspect about Dane’s death is the role of rumor anddisinformation in any discussion of Tesla’s life and impact on the world.Certain articles and biographies suggest that the five-year-old Niko pushed Danedown a staircase and thus killed him. It took me a while to track down thesource of this rumor. It came from Arthur Beckhard, a writer whose screenplaysincluded West Point of the Air, Our Little Girl, and Sky Parade. In 1959,Beckhard wrote the children’s biography Nikola Tesla: Electrical Genius(published by Messner Books), which included many vignettes that he simply madeup. However, this book filtered its way to the Tesla Museum in Yugoslavia, wherethe tale was picked up by Serbian writers, and that fictional source was used byother biographers and critical writers of Tesla who thought they had an insidescoop.TESLA’S BREAKTHROUGH WITH AC CURRENTIn 1878, Tesla attended the University of Graz in Austria, and two years later,the Charles-Ferdinand branch of the University of Prague in Bohemia, where, inboth schools, he took such courses as geometry, integral calculus, analyticalchemistry, machine construction, botany, wave theory, optics, philosophy,French, and English. At Graz, in a course on experimental physics, his teacherProfessor Poeschl presented a conundrum in electrical engineering thatdetermined his future. Poeschl showed the class an electrical turbine that useda commutator to change the naturally flowing alternating current at the sourceof power into direct current (DC), so that it could be transported down a wireto run a machine or light a lightbulb.Electrical lighting for factories and homes was in its infancy, but the directcurrent power distribution system, which had been in use about twenty years, washighly inefficient. The problem had to do with the mystery of electricity, whichby its nature was alternating, that is, it changed its direction of flow manytimes per second. Consider a river that is flowing downstream and then upstreamand then downstream many times per second. How does one make use of such unrulypower, that is, make the waterwheel go in one direction?The trick for making electricity go into a single direction had first beenaccomplished by William Sturgeon in 1832 with his invention of the commutator.This was a series of wire brushes with a small gap in the middle of them. Whenthe electricity was flowing downstream from the generator, it had the impetus tojump the gap to make it to the motor or lightbulb on the other side, and when itreversed its direction, nothing happened. In this way, the commutator captured aunidirectional flow, but it was highly inefficient.Tesla saw in an intuitive flash that the commutator could be removed and thealternating current harnessed in an unencumbered fashion. Tesla was an A+student, and Poeschl initially complimented the young man, but then essentiallyembarrassed him. “Tesla, you may do many things,” Poeschl said. “But this is aperpetual motion scheme, an impossible task.”1 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt1]Dropping out of school before graduation, Tesla would spend the next four yearsin a daily quest to solve this puzzle and prove Poeschl wrong.His first job was in Budapest as an electrical engineer for the Pukas brothers,associates of Thomas Edison. It was at this time, in 1882, that Tesla solved theproblem of removing the commutator with his first major invention, the rotatingmagnetic field. Shortly thereafter, Tesla worked at the Edison electricallighting plant in Paris and then, in 1884, moved to New York City to apprenticewith the Wizard of Menlo Park himself. Unfortunately, this union would only lasta year, in part because Edison was unwilling to try to understand Tesla’sinvention with alternating current. Tesla went out on his own, found newbackers, and soon sold his entire forty-patent AC polyphase electrical powerdistribution system to Westinghouse for five hundred thousand dollars, plusroyalties. Approximately half of this went to his partners.image [images/9781594775093_005.jpg]Figure 1.3. Follow the north poles (N). Each quadrant represents two circuitscatty-corner to each other. The north-south (N/S) pole in circuit 1 (top leftcorner to bottom right corner) starts to reverse itself by appearing in section2 as still N/S, in section 3 as 0/0 (because it is reversing), and then as S/Nin sections 4, 5, and 6 as it begins to reverse itself. The other circuit (topright to bottom left) is out of phase so that an armature attracted to the northpole (the arrow) will spin, thus producing the rotating magnetic field.TESLA’S CONTRIBUTIONS TO HYDROELECTRIC POWEREdison, and his competitors Elihu Thomson of the Thomson-Houston Company andGeorge Westinghouse, were dotting the landscape with coal-operated electricalpower stations at every other mile across cities and towns, because a mile wasas far as electricity could travel at that time. DC generators and competing ACgenerators, which also used commutators, could only be used for lighting homes,not for running electrical equipment, unless these generators were placed insideor right next to the actual factory.Before Tesla’s invention of the rotating magnetic field, all factories weresituated along rivers, but after Westinghouse purchased his patents in 1889,factories would soon be able to be located anywhere as long as a power linecould reach them. By setting up two or more electrical currents out of phasewith each other, Tesla made the commutator obsolete and eliminated the need forthe thousands of polluting coal-operated power stations. Tesla’s clean energyinvention was renewable because it ran on waterfalls. The full creation tookforty patents to describe and included the now ubiquitous induction motor. Thisfundamental creation, unchanged today, over one hundred years later has savedliterally billions and billions of man-hours because machines were able toreplace the work that man had done in the past. Tesla, in fact, realized this,and therefore predicted that with the advent of his induction motor and ACelectrical power distribution system, society would advance at a more rapid ratebecause humans could spend more time in study rather than in manual labor.With the present discussion of potentially resurrecting nuclear power, let’skeep in mind the comparisons between it and hydroelectric power. A clean energy,nonpolluting, renewable Tesla hydroelectric plant situated at Niagara Fallsprovides electricity to tens of millions of outlets, including homes, stores,factories, and streetlights hundreds of miles away. The power from Niagara Fallspowers and illuminates parts of Canada, large and small cities throughout Maine,Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, and evenPennsylvania, and also such great metropolises as Toronto, Montreal, Boston,Providence, Hartford, and New Haven. It also powers Manhattan and all of itsmajor boroughs such as Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Queens.Compare this to a nuclear power plant, which poses a tremendous safety threat:There is no place to store the spent radioactive material. There is also thepotential that an accident or terrorist act could wipe out thousands or millionsof people. Additionally, such a plant can only supply, at best, about a tenth ofwhat a hydroelectric plant can. Finally, one has the problem of radioactiveleakage, with its attendant risk of genetic mutations and cancer. The only goalof a nuclear power plant is simply to boil water to create steam—in other words,to simulate what a waterfall or hydroelectric system does naturally!TESLA’S IMPACT ON THE WORLDTesla spent his life seeking alternative forms of renewable energy sources andwrote several treatises on solar, tide, wind, and geothermal power. One of hismore creative ideas was based on W. H. Wellaston’s (1766–1828) invention of adual-exhausted bulb called a cryophoros, which allows liquids to boil at roomtemperature. Tesla’s plan, published in the article “Sea Power Plant Designed byTesla” in the New York Times on November 11, 1931, was to construct a giganticWellaston dual-bulb system in the oceans. Using the differences in temperaturebetween the surface and the great depths, a cycle of heat transfer would becreated inside large vacuum bulbs that would boil the oceans at low temperaturesso that the steam could be used to drive turbines to create electricity.In 1892 Tesla spoke before the Royal Society of London. Present were suchscientists as Sir William Crookes (inventor of the Crookes tube), J. J. Thomson(discoverer of the electron, winner of the Nobel Prize in 1906), Nobel nomineeOliver Heaviside, Sir John Ambrose Fleming, Sir James Dewar (inventor of thethermos bottle), Sir Oliver Lodge (inventor of wireless technology), LordRayleigh (winner of the Nobel Prize in 1904 for discovering argon), and LordKelvin, who said, “Tesla has contributed more to electrical science than any manup to his time.”2 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt2]Other Nobel laureates who were either influenced by Tesla or congratulated himin 1931 for his seventy-fifth birthday included Albert Einstein, Robert Millikan(who had attended Tesla’s 1891 Columbia University lecture), Arthur Compton (whoreceived the prize for his work in optics, X-rays, and high frequencyphenomena), and Ernest Rutherford (whose planetary model for the atom—with NielsBohr—is based on information from Tesla’s Royal Society talk and its relatedColumbia University lecture).3 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt3]This treatise of one hundred pages, which combined the 1891 Columbia Universityand 1892 Royal Society of London lectures, was published in the electricaljournals of the day, and in Tesla’s collected works published two years later byElectrical Engineer editor T. C. Martin.4 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt4] Duringthese lectures, Tesla likened “the infinitesimal world, with molecules and theiratoms spinning and moving in orbits” to “celestial bodies spinning with themether, or in other words, carrying with them static charges.”5[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt5]This model, through the work of Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr, would go on tobecome the standard for the atom and win for this duo a Nobel Prize, but Teslawould receive no credit. (One of Ernest Rutherford’s favorite books, as noted inOrrin Dunlap’s Radio’s 100 Men of Science,6 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt6] wasThe Researches, Writings, and Inventions of Nikola Tesla.) According toNobelPrize.org, Rutherford did much of his early work on “magnetic properties ofiron exposed to high-frequency oscillations,” precisely the kind of workinaugurated by Tesla in his early lectures in the 1890s. Further, Niels Bohrspoke in praise of Tesla at the 1956 centennial congress to celebrate Tesla’sbirth.7 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt7]Tesla has also been written out of books on the history of physics even thoughhis treatise became a standard, and his work became essential for the study ofmatter. (Super colliders rely heavily on the Tesla coil and other Teslatechnology.)As a finale to Tesla’s 1891–1893 electrical lectures, and as a way to tell theworld that alternating currents were perfectly safe if used correctly, Teslasent hundreds of thousands of volts through his own body to issue forth sparksfrom his fingertips and illuminate wireless cold lamps. Part of Tesla’s reasonfor sending electricity through his body was because Edison, still stuck indirect current, was engaged in a publicity campaign to suggest that AC was moredangerous. Edison even went so far as to talk New York State into instituting anelectric chair using AC current to put heinous criminals to death, or inEdison’s words, “to Westinghouse them.” As is well known, as part of thisnegative publicity campaign, Edison began electrocuting stray dogs and cats andeven a rogue elephant with the horrible Tesla/ Westinghouse currents.image [images/9781594775093_006.jpg]Figure 1.4. Tesla sending five hundred thousand volts through his body in 1898to illuminate a fluorescent tube. This photo was taken with a strobe as theinventor whipped the tube around.TESLA’S DEAL WITH WESTINGHOUSEWestinghouse was in a bind with his backers. At the time he purchased the TeslaAC polyphase system, Westinghouse had nearly one thousand profitable ACelectrical plants throughout urban America. Like his competitors, EdisonElectric, which used DC, and Thomson-Houston, which like Westinghouse used AC,Westinghouse still made use of a commutator. Thus, their plants could not powerhome appliances. They were used exclusively to illuminate homes or apartmentcomplexes within a radius of approximately twenty to twenty-five blocks, or onsite, to run equipment for a single factory. To change over to the Tesla systemwould mean scrapping all of these profitable stations. With his eye on thelarger picture, Tesla agreed to destroy the royalty clause of his contract ifWestinghouse committed himself to making the change. And that is what happened.Soon after, the Chicago World’s Fair of 1893 became the first metropolis to belit by the Tesla-Westinghouse AC Polyphase System.Once it became apparent how superior the Tesla system was, Westinghouse’scompetitors joined forces under the guidance of J. Pierpont Morgan (the mostpowerful financier of the day) to create General Electric. It was now the taskof Elihu Thomson and Charles Steinmetz to figure out a way to usurp the Teslainvention but do it in a manner that somehow did not look like piracy. (That’swhy Steinmetz would write textbooks on the invention but do it in a way thatleft out Tesla’s name.) Legal suits soon began and then continued to sap fundsfrom both camps. As the years went on, electrical engineering students, relyingon the textbooks of Steinmetz, would come to believe that he and not Tesla wasthe author of the AC polyphase system.image [images/9781594775093_007.jpg]Figure 1.5. Nikola Tesla, circa 1895This battle of the currents ended abruptly when Edison left his company to begina career in filmmaking. This occurred right before Tesla spoke at Niagara Fallsin 1897. Since the harnessing of the falls was such a huge endeavor,Westinghouse simply had to share the work with GE. Westinghouse obtained certaintrolley patents in return, and that’s how General Electric obtained access toTesla’s patents without paying the inventor a cent. At the same time, thecombination of these new train patents and the Tesla AC polyphase system allowedWestinghouse to launch an entirely new endeavor as well: the electric subway.Again working together with Morgan, this subway system was installed in New YorkCity right after the turn of the century, and again, Tesla received absolutelyno recompense.TESLA ACHIEVES GREATER RENOWNTesla was quite wealthy from the original deal with Westinghouse and thus in1897 was able to move into the Waldorf Astoria and to move his laboratory toHouston Street. It was at this time, during the height of the Gay Nineties, thatTesla befriended Robert Underwood Johnson, the editor of The Century magazine,and his alluring wife, Katharine. Introductions had been made by T. C. Martin,editor of both the prestigious Electrical World and the groundbreaking book TheResearches, Writings, and Inventions of Nikola Tesla.Through the Johnsons, Tesla met many of the greatest writers, artists, anddignitaries of the day, most of whom were invited back to the wizard’slaboratory, where he could display his latest creations. This group includedJohn Jacob Astor and his wife, Ava Willing, architect Stanford White, writersMark Twain and Rudyard Kipling, the conservationist John Muir, Teddy Rooseveltand his sister Mrs. Douglas Robinson (one of the founders of the MetropolitanMuseum of Art), Mary Mapes Dodge (author of Hans Brinker), the playwrightMarguerite Merrington, composer and conductor Anton Dvorak (who wrote the NewWorld Symphony at this time), and Ignace Paderewski (the most successful pianistof the day, and latter-day prime minister of Poland).In 1897, the Tesla hydroelectric system was installed at Niagara Falls, whereTesla spoke as the inventor. It is virtually unchanged today. During his NiagaraFalls speech, Tesla discussed his next invention, the transmission of electricalpower without wires. The seeds of this creation were displayed in highlypublicized lectures that Tesla gave throughout the early 1890s at the RoyalAcademies of Science in London and Paris and at electrical congresses in St.Louis, Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York. So astonishing were these lecturesthat thousands of people came to hear them.In 1891, speaking at Columbia University before such peers as Elihu Thomson(later head of General Electric), Alexander Graham Bell, Michael Pupin(professor of physics at Columbia), Robert Millikan (latter-day Nobel Prizewinner on his work with cosmic rays), and gyroscope inventor Elmer Sperry, Tesladisplayed his work in high-frequency phenomena. Tesla began his talk somewhatnervously, but gained momentum as it progressed: “Of all the forms of nature’simmeasurable, all-pervading energy, which ever and ever change and move, like asoul animates an innate universe, electricity and magnetism are perhaps the mostfascinating. . . . We know,” Tesla continued, “that [electricity] acts like anincompressible fluid; that there must be a constant quantity of it in nature;that it can neither be produced or destroyed . . . and that electric and etherphenomena are identical.”8 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt8] Having set the premisethat our world is immersed in a great sea of electricity, the wizard proceededto astound the audience with his myriad experiments.image [images/9781594775093_008.jpg]Figure 1.6. Mark Twain in Tesla’s laboratory, circa 1894At this time, Tesla also displayed his Tesla coil, which stepped up frequenciesto very-high voltages, precursors to both radio and television tubes, a buttonlamp that could disintegrate matter, and fluorescent and neon lights thatilluminated when the proper resonant frequency was generated. Before thismoment, the world was caught up in Heinreich Hertz’s wireless spark-gap device.This Hertzian apparatus was later advanced by Guglielmo Marconi to transmitMorse code over long distances. But the problems with this device werethreefold: it was next to impossible to establish separate channels, weatherconditions could easily interfere with transmissions, and complex forms ofinformation could not be transmitted.TESLA GOES WIRELESSOn the other hand, Tesla’s invention of continuous wave wireless communication,in combination with high-frequency phenomena, and aerial and tuned circuits, laythe groundwork for our modern age of cell phone technology, remote control,wireless transmission, and mass communication. In particular, Tesla’s use of theground connection paved the way for radio as well as wireless transmission oftext and pictures to newspapers and also TV transmission. His vacuum tube, whichresponded to wireless messages sent from distant places, was constructed onprinciples he learned from studying the human eye, as both eye and radio tuberesponded to signals sent from afar.In 1904, Arthur Korn, an electrical engineer from the University of Munich,gained the attention of the scientific community when he successfullytransmitted photographs sent along wire transmission lines from Munich toNuremburg. The ability to send such complex information by means of electricitywas, at the time, an astonishing accomplishment, and it was eclipsed just a fewyears later when Korn accomplished this without wires! By 1913, Korn was alsoable to send wireless photographs across the Atlantic. According to Korn, who isoften credited as the first inventor of the television tube, the apparatus used“Tesla currents.” In 1920, Tesla explained in an Electrical Review articletitled “The Art and Practice of Telephotography” that Korn’s tube, which wasbased on a tube Tesla displayed in the early 1890s, “is excited by ahigh-frequency current supplied from a Tesla transformer and may be flashed upmany thousand times per second,”9 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt9] therebyattaining the moving television image. That’s precisely how the TV tube works.(Philo Farnsworth, often credited as the inventor of the TV tube, was fourteenyears old in 1920.)Tesla’s work in wireless technology took a veritable quantum leap forward in1898, when he displayed his remote-controlled robotic boat, which he called the“telautomaton,” in the electrical journals and before the public at MadisonSquare Garden.Tesla realized that if, for instance, a remote-controlled torpedo were to belaunched, it would be a simple matter for the target ship to send out its ownsignal to cause the weapon to turn around and attack the hand that sent it.Having studied Herbert Spencer’s work on nerve conduction, Tesla got the idea ofcombining frequencies to send complex information along separate securechannels. For instance, say one only had ten wireless frequencies to work with(if we are talking about cell phones, this means that a manufacturer could onlycreate ten separate channels and thus be able to sell only ten separate cellphones). However, if combinations of frequencies were used, the amount ofpotential channels would increase in geometric proportions: combining twofrequencies would create ten times ten, or one hundred channels, threefrequencies, a thousand channels, and so on.This invention, which Tesla patented in 1901, became the basis for protectedprivacy communication and radio-guidance systems developed by his protégé JohnHays Hammond Jr., who called the invention Tesla’s “prophetic genius patent.” Bycombining frequencies, Tesla had set the stage for the age of cell phones,whereby a virtually unlimited number of individual wireless phone numbers couldbe set up.But the telautomaton was much more than this. Since the inventor could send asignal to the boat and the boat would respond, from Tesla’s point of view he hadcreated the first prototype of a thinking machine, the first of a new species onthe planet, “not made out of flesh and bones, but rather of wire and steel.”From the construction of Tesla’s telautomaton came such devices as the garagedoor opener, the wireless car-lock system, cell phone technology, encryptiondevices, the TV remote, wireless communication, radar, artificial intelligence,and robotics.image [images/9781594775093_009.jpg]Figure 1.7. Tesla’s remote-controlled robotic boat, displayed at Madison SquareGarden in 1898image [images/9781594775093_04.jpg]Having astonished the world in four separate areas: electrical powertransmission, fluorescent lighting, wireless communication, and robotics, andfunded by John Jacob Astor, Tesla set out in 1899 to Colorado Springs toexperiment with the transmission of electrical power to distant points withoutthe use of wires. His idea was simple: use the resonant frequency of the Earthitself as a carrier wave to distribute electrical power. Having constructed aprototype planet, Tesla calculated the length of his electrical frequencies andwhere the nodal points would be. At these junctions around the globe, theinventor hoped to eventually erect receiving towers. In that way, if, forinstance, a major wireless transmitter were put in at Niagara Falls, electricalpower could be transported through the Earth and the air to such distant placesas the Sahara Desert or the upcoming Paris Exposition that was planned for 1902.image [images/9781594775093_010.jpg]Figure 1.8. Tesla’s wireless transmission tower in Colorado SpringsTesla erected a two-hundred-foot-tall transmission tower in Colorado, and fromthis experimental station he created sixty-foot-long lightning bolts andmeasured the resonant frequency of the Earth. Tesla also claimed that hecircumscribed the Earth with his electrical waves, setting up a nodal point atthe antipode, which he calculated was in Australia. After tracking thunderstormsat distances of six hundred miles Tesla announced to the world in a Colliersarticle titled “Talking with the Planets” that he had received pulsedfrequencies from outer space. These, he speculated, came from intelligent beingsfrom some neighboring planet like Venus or Mars.A year later, Tesla returned to New York City and his home at the WaldorfAstoria. At this time, he formed a partnership with J. Pierpont Morgan so thathe could finance the creation of a wireless transmitter to send signals acrossthe Atlantic. Having leased a 1,800-acre tract out on Long Island from a Mr.Warden, Tesla called his planned radio city Wardenclyffe. His architect wasStanford White, who was the designer of the capitol building in Providence,Rhode Island; Rosecliffe Mansion and the Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport; theWashington Arch in Greenwich Village; Madison Square Garden in New York City(which was funded by Morgan); the Agricultural Building at the Chicago World’sFair; the Player’s Club in New York; and numerous other buildings.image [images/9781594775093_011.jpg]Figure 1.9. Political cartoon of J. Pierpont MorganMorgan had given the inventor $150,000 to complete the ninety-foot tower andlaboratory. But just as Morgan sailed for Europe for his annual extended stay,Tesla learned that Marconi was pirating his apparatus. Thus, unbeknownst to hisbenefactor, Tesla decided to double the size of the tower. His thinking was thatby doing this, not only could he send messages to Europe, but now he could reachthe whole world as well. Thus, when completed, instead of the revenues beingmerely doubled (because the costs had doubled), they would increase in geometricproportions because everybody on the planet would be tuned into his system.10[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt10]image [images/9781594775093_012.jpg]Figure 1.10. Guglielmo Marconi (fourth from left) with his wireless deviceMarconi’s success in transmitting a Morse-coded signal across the Atlantic in1901 captured the imagination of the world and hurt Tesla’s credibility withMorgan. Where Tesla was envisioning the transmission of voice, pictures, andpower, and the creation of an unlimited number of wireless channels (equivalentto today’s cell phone technology and achieved by using multiple frequencies),Marconi could only send pulsed signals on a very small number of channels andadmittedly had no understanding of selective tuning. There was no comparisonbetween the two inventions whatsoever from a technical point of view. However,Tesla’s ideas were so futuristic that Morgan simply couldn’t comprehend them.Stop and think for a moment yourself how our cell phones transmit voice andpictures through the air. Unless you really study the mechanism involved, itdoes indeed seem like magic. In a series of articles and in numerous letters,Tesla pleaded with Morgan to give him the funds to complete the tower andlaboratory.image [images/9781594775093_013.jpg]Figure 1.11. Franklin RooseveltTesla would later have another competitive brush with Marconi. When World War Iwas in full swing, Guglielmo Marconi chose that time to sue the U.S. Navy forpatent infringement for using his wireless apparatus. Assistant secretary of theU.S. Navy, Franklin Roosevelt, researched the problem and found that at the turnof the century Nikola Tesla had been negotiating with the U.S. Navy, via theLight House Board, to place his own wireless apparatus on naval vessels. Thiscorrespondence also explained that Tesla’s work predated and was superior to thework of Marconi. Thus, it established Tesla’s priority.Consequently in 1916, during the Marconi/U.S. Navy litigation, Roosevelt wrotethat, based on Tesla’s 1899 correspondence with the Light House Board, the U.S.government now had “suitable proof of priority of certain wireless usages byother than Marconi.”11 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt11] This was later used by theU.S. Supreme Court to rule in Tesla’s favor as the original inventor of theradio.12 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt12]THE FAR-REACHING EXTENT OF TESLA’S VISIONThe following quote is from a piece that Tesla published in 1904 in the journalElectrical World and Engineer. It is a splendid article that has pictures ofboth his magnificent wireless towers, which were erected in Colorado Springs andWardenclyffe on Long Island. The article was written specifically to explain toMorgan the inventor’s vast plan. Note how Tesla, in a sense, foresees whatbecame the Internet.[My] World Telegraphy System . . . involve[s] the employment of a number ofplants each of [which] will be preferably located near some important center ofcivilization, and the news it receives through any channel will be flashed toall points of the globe. A cheap and simple [pocket-sized] device may then beset up on land or sea, and it will record the world’s news or such specialmessage as may be intended for it. Thus the entire earth will be converted intoa huge brain, as it were, capable of response in every one of its parts. Such asingle plant . . . can operate hundreds of millions of instruments, the systemwill have a virtually infinite working capacity.Even today, Tesla’s understanding of the potential for world advancement andeven world peace through mass communication remains profound.A stock market crash and a series of arguments with Morgan that culminated in1906 destroyed all chances for the tower to be completed, and it was eventuallytorn down in 1917. The salvage was used as partial payment to the WaldorfAstoria for back rent owed.In 1908, there was a tremendous explosion in Tunguska, Siberia. An area the sizeof Rhode Island was obliterated. No one knows for sure what happened. Onecreative theory initiated by Tesla researcher Oliver Nicholsen suggests it wasTesla’s doing. Tesla did indeed state in 1915, in an article in the New YorkTimes, that his Wardenclyffe tower could be used as a massive Star Wars–likeweapon. Under the unlikely possibility that Tesla was responsible, he would havehad to have jury-rigged the tower, because Tesla’s generator at Wardenclyffe wasremoved in 1904 by the Westinghouse Company for lack of payment.image [images/9781594775093_014.jpg]Figure 1.12. Tesla’s world wireless system on Long Island, called WardenclyffeThe most likely hypothesis is that a comet or asteroid skimmed the Earth in thatarea and flattened out hamlets and towns and tens of thousands of trees. Thereis no crater and no residue from an extraterrestrial object, so a direct hit bya meteor can be discounted.Two years later, in 1910, already concerned with preserving the world’s reservesof petroleum, Tesla began work on his bladeless steam turbines, which he washoping would replace the gasoline engine in Henry Ford’s cars. This plan, whicheventually was partially funded by Morgan’s son, J. P. Morgan Jr., fell through,and Tesla also had a falling out with John Hays Hammond Jr., who wasconstructing radio-guided torpedoes for the United States, as well as for Germanand Japanese navies. Tesla did, however, in 1915, help the Germans constructtheir transatlantic wireless plants in Tuckertown, New Jersey, and Sayville,Long Island. (Once America entered the Great War, Tesla, as a patriot, severedall ties with the Germans.)image [images/9781594775093_015.jpg]Figure 1.13. Tesla’s tilt-rotor flivver plane paved the way for today’s Osprey,a $40-million military airplane that takes off like a helicopter and then flieslike a normal plane after the propeller is rotated 90° into the normal airplaneposition. Tesla’s patent application drawing (top left) was published in thenewspapers in the late 1920s.Tesla then began work on a variety of flying machines. These included ahovercraft and a reactive jet dirigible, which was an early prototype that ledto such airplanes as the vectored-thrust Harrier jet and the flying wing orstealth bomber. Tesla also patented a tilt-rotor aircraft that he called theflivver plane. This machine, which took off like a helicopter and then, afterrotating the propeller, flew like an airplane, evolved a half-century later intothe V-22 Osprey aircraft, a $40-million helicopter/ airplane that the militaryuses today. At the time (1920s and early ’30s), Tesla envisioned the vehiclecompeting with the automobile. Another feature of one of his airplanes was thatit had no fuel on board, but rather ran on an electric motor that derived itspower from ground transmitters.TESLA’S LATER INVENTIONSDuring the Roaring Twenties right into the time of the Great Depression, Teslabegan work on two top-secret devices. The first was an electric car, a PierceArrow, which derived its power from a distant source. In 1930, Tesla met withHeinreich Jebens, a former naval officer and current director of DeutschesErfinderhaus (the German Inventor’s House, an organization of 10,000 inventorsand researchers in Germany). Jebens was in the states to meet with Tom Edison.But a man on the ship coming over suggested he also contact Nikola Tesla.Arrangements were made and Tesla met Jebens at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel andthen took the German inventor up to Buffalo to see Tesla’s top-secret car underthe condition that Jebens “keep absolutely quite about this” and Jebens agreedto do so.From an e-mail that Jebens’s son sent to the author (on November 15, 2003) welearn that the car was “installed with an 80 HP-electric motor,” which replacedthe “fuel engine” and possessed a six-foot-tall aerial and also a groundconnection, which, perhaps, scraped the Earth as the car moved along. Teslaattached a converter box comprising a dozen radio tubes, “24 resistors anddiversified cables,” which, it must be assumed, derived power from a secrettransmitter he had to have set up at the power station at Niagara Falls. After“inserting two rods into the engine,” the car was ready to roll, achieving,according to Jebens, speeds in excess of ninety miles per hour. After the jaunt,Tesla directed their driver to return to the power station and “disconnect theconverter, which Tesla took back to New York.”13 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt13]The other secret invention involved the harnessing of cosmic rays, which weresomehow converted into electrical power. In his twilight years, Tesla wasparticularly cagey about the details of this invention. In a July 11, 1937,article in the New York Times titled “Dr. Tesla Predicts Linking Planets,” theinventor suggested this was “a different kind of energy than is commonlyemployed. . . . It travels through a channel of one-millionth of a centimeter.”The energy, which stemmed from cosmic rays coming from the sun and other stars,traveled at many times the speed of light. According to Tesla’s understanding,radioactivity was not due to the disintegration of the neutrons in the nucleusof such elements as radium or uranium, but rather, a release of cosmic energy“from all parts of the universe.”From this vantage point, radioactivity would be the end result of the inabilityof atoms of radioactive material to maintain their integrity. So, in a sense,they would be acting like a sieve to transfer cosmic energy into what we callradioactivity. Tesla thereby told the New York Times on February 6, 1932, that“if this cosmic radiation could be wholly intercepted, the radioactivity wouldcease.”14 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt14] If, indeed, matter is constantlyabsorbing ether to maintain the integrity or spin of the elementary particles,then radioactivity can now be looked at in an entirely different light. Thistheory also explains what Tesla called his dynamic theory of gravity in that theEarth is constantly absorbing energy or ether, and this is why light bendsaround large planetary and stellar bodies. Light is drawn in by the influx.This theory also addresses Einstein’s forty-year quest for Grand Unification,namely a way to combine gravity with electromagnetism, and explains, in itsfinal form, what physicists of today call the God particle, the particle thatgives matter its mass. According to Tesla’s view, as I explain in detail inTranscending the Speed of Light, it is not a “particle,” but rather an on-goingprocess of ether absorption that explains the concept behind the God particle.*1[9781594775093_ftn.xhtml#ft1]According to Tesla, by using a special tube, he would be able to capture andtransmit this unusual form of cosmic power to great distances, including tonearby planets.Tesla’s last great accomplishment, which he described as far back as 1915 butwhich he publicized in the 1930s, was often called the death ray. In actuality,it was a particle beam weapon that was based on principles found in the popgunthat he had used to shoot crows with when he was a child.image [images/9781594775093_016.jpg]Figure 1.14. Tesla’s idea of supplying wireless power to airplanes so that theywould run on electricity instead of petroleum is depicted in this futuristicdrawing (slightly modified) by science fiction artist Philip Paul from about1920.The idea was simple. Set up in an analogous way as a Van de Graaff generator,Tesla generated a belt of highly charged ions that circulated around the baseand tower of the machine. At the location where the barrel of the gun began, theinventor figured out a way to chip off small pieces of tungsten, which carriedthe same charge as the electronic belt. In this way, the individualized pelletswould be repelled out of the barrel at enormous velocities, much the same way acork would pop out of a pop gun. As World War II was brewing, it was Tesla’splan to provide these Star Wars–type weapons to all the allies, so that theirborders would become impregnable from Nazi invasion. Thus, there would never bewar again. Such was the mind of this great dreamer.Tesla’s life has always sparked the imagination of the novelist. He is oftendepicted in fictional form as a mad scientist, for instance, and has been citedas a part of the composite hero John Galt in Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged. Heappeared in stories in the science fiction magazines from the 1920s and ’30sproduced by his friend Hugo Gernsback, and also appears in James Redfield’s bookThe Tenth Insight, the sequel to The Celestine Prophecy, one of the mostsuccessful books ever published.image [images/9781594775093_017.jpg]Figure 1.15. Tesla in the 1930s explaining the machinations of his particle beamweapon to a reporter.In 2006 and 2007, Tesla was mentioned on such successful TV shows as Studio 60on NBC and on Fox, where the words “Tesla got robbed!” appeared on theblackboard behind actor Hugh Laurie, who plays the doctor on the very popularshow House. Photos of Tesla can be seen in such movies as Tucker, directed byFrancis Ford Coppola starring Jeff Bridges, and Antitrust with Tim Robbins.Tesla also appeared on-screen in 2007 in the movie The Prestige, about duelingmagicians from the turn of the twentieth century. Tesla was also assumed to bethe real life personality behind the character of the electrical savant in the1976 movie The Man Who Fell to Earth (which featured rock star David Bowie asthe titular extraterrestrial and was based on the book by Walter Tevis).Tesla’s greatest acclaim of recent days can be found in the automotive industry,with the new car called the Tesla Roadster. This electric car pays homage toTesla in that it is a real attempt to design a new clean energy technology. TheTesla Roadster is supported by former actor and California governor ArnoldSchwartzenegger, who owns one, actor George Clooney, who also drives one, andsuch young Silicon Valley billionaires as Jeffrey Skoll of eBay and the filmcompany Participant Media (producers of Syriana, An Inconvenient Truth, CharlieWilson’s War), Elon Musk of PayPal, SpaceX (the first privately owned spaceship) and founder of Tesla Motors, and Sergi Brin and Larry Page of Google, whoare all partners in the new Tesla automobile. Clearly, Silicon Valley recognizesTesla as the first inventor of what is now called green technology: the designof high-tech creations that are nonpolluting and environmentally friendly.TESLA’S GENIUS RESENTED BY PEERSScientists whose work is based on Tesla’s inventions include: Elihu Thomson, oneof the key founders of General Electric (GE), a company built on Tesla’s patentsfor electrical power distribution; Charles Steinmetz, known for his textbooks onthe AC Polyphase System, which brazenly leave out Tesla’s name; GeorgeWestinghouse, whose company, like GE, was built on Tesla’s alternating current(AC) invention (through the years, many Westinghouse biographers neatly removedor obscured Tesla’s role in the success of that great enterprise); Elmer Sperry,whose gyroscope is based entirely on Tesla’s invention of the rotating magneticfield; Guglielmo Marconi, who received a Nobel Prize for sending the firstwireless message across the Atlantic Ocean in 1901, and who admittedly used aTesla coil to achieve this end, although he claimed his work was not based onTesla’s; and Michael Pupin, a fellow Serb who taught physics for many years atColumbia University and who used other aspects of Tesla’s inventions to patent atraditional method of long-distance telephonic communication over wires.Pupin, who purposely kept Tesla’s name out of electrical engineering courses atColumbia University for decades, was given a Pulitzer Prize for writing FromImmigrant to Inventor, a book that, although discussing such things as theharnessing of Niagara Falls, goes out of its way to completely obliterateTesla’s role in the development of our modern electrical age. Instead, it placesmost of the credit on Pupin’s friend Elihu Thomson, who, along with Steinmetz,pirated Tesla’s apparatus before they legitimately obtained a license to use theAC polyphase system from the owner of the patents, George Westinghouse.Pupin’s animosity for Tesla and loyalty to Thomson and Marconi is well known.Pupin even went so far as to testify on Marconi’s behalf at the aforementionedtrial between Marconi and the United States Navy in 1915 whereby Marconi claimedthat the navy was pirating his wireless apparatus.One of the key sources for uncovering this blatant attempt to erase Tesla fromthe history books was Edwin Armstrong, inventor of AM and FM radio, a pallbearerat Tesla’s funeral in 1942 and a student of Pupin in or about 1912. Armstrong,whose favorite book was The Researches, Writings, and Inventions of NikolaTesla, said of his Columbia professor, “[Pupin] went so far as to say there wasvery little originality about Tesla.”15 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt15]In the case of Westinghouse, after Tesla’s patents lapsed, the Tesla motor andAC polyphase system came to be known as the Westinghouse motor and system. As Iexplain in my Tesla biography, Wizard, even at the Westinghouse Company, therewere many key individuals who did their best to obscure Tesla’s role in themassive success of the company. Frankly, had it not been for John O’Neill, areporter for the Herald Tribune who personally knew the inventor for forty yearsand whose biography on Tesla, Prodigal Genius, was published in 1944, Tesla’sname would have almost certainly completely disappeared from the history books.As unbelievable as it sounds, for decades, all the way through the 1970’s, theonly real way to obtain the O’Neill biography was through a UFO organization whodistributed the book. The lesson here is the importance of the individual, inTesla’s case, in making history, and in O’Neill’s case, of preserving it.All of this may seem tangential to a discussion of Tesla’s life story becausehis name has reappeared in a major way in books, movies, and on the Internet.But it is important for serious researchers to realize that ego battles,personality conflicts, and specifically, corporate and other financial interestsplay a key role in obscuring history and, ultimately, in this instance,thwarting the development of technology. Not only was radio and cell phonetechnology retarded by decades, the release of fluorescent lightbulbs was alsodelayed nearly a half-century because corporate powers that were backed by J. P.Morgan simply wanted society to spend more money in illuminating their homes andfactories with incandescent lights that expend most of their energy in heat, notlight, and that burn out after just a few months.Tesla invented cold fluorescent bulbs in 1898, yet they did not appear on themarket until the 1940s, and that was because large buildings simply had to usethem because the demand for electricity had grown so rapidly. In fact, we havefinally reached a stage whereby the Edison lightbulb may be phased outcompletely, to be replaced by Tesla fluorescent lights, which, for the lasthalf-century, have been the dominant way factories and buildings are lit. Also,where an Edison incandescent bulb may last a few months, a Tesla fluorescentbulb can last literally decades.ACCOLADES AWARDED TO TESLAIn 1893, Tesla was awarded the Elliott Cresson Gold Medal from the FranklinInstitute in Philadelphia. This was followed by the Edison Gold Medal given toTesla in 1917 and the John Scott Medal Award in 1934. Tesla was also awardedadvanced degrees and honorary doctorates from Columbia University and YaleUniversity in the United States, and from universities in Vienna, Bucharest,Zagreb, Belgrade, Prague, and Paris. In 1937 he was nominated for a Nobel Prize,in 1976 a statue of Tesla was erected on Goat Island at Niagara Falls on theU.S. side in Tesla’s honor, and in 2006, another statue of Tesla was erected bythe Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side.As the twentieth century ended, in 1999 Life magazine listed Nikola Tesla as oneof the one hundred most important individuals of the last one thousand years.His picture can be found on the equivalent of the one-dollar bill in Serbia andthere is a U.S. stamp that commemorates him. Tesla was one of our greatestvisionaries, very far in advance of his time. He remains as an inspiration tothe übergeeks of Silicon Valley today. A tremendous resurgence of interest inTesla has occurred because of the Internet, a global communication system verymuch in accord with his inventions and predictions.The scientific man does not aim at an immediate result. He does not expect thathis advanced ideas will be readily taken up. His work is like that of theplanter for the future. His duty is to lay foundation for those who are to come,and point the way. He lives and labors and hopes.NIKOLA TESLA, 1900"},{"pageContent":"2JOHN WORRELL KEELYFREE-ENERGY PIONEER—A NEW CHAPTERTheo Paijmans Let a note be struck on an instrument, and the faintest sound produces aneternal echo. A disturbance is created on the invisible waves of the shorelessocean of space, and the vibration is never wholly lost. Its energy being oncecarried from the world of matter into the immaterial world will live forever.H.-P. BLAVATSKYMy system, in every part and detail, both in the development of this power andin every branch of its utilization, is based and founded on sympatheticvibration.JOHN WORRELL KEELYINTRODUCTIONHe was the source of an endless series of controversies printed in newspapersworldwide during his career that spanned a quarter of a century. Many tens ofthousands of dollars were invested in his inventions. He won over the hearts andminds of even the most sceptical, cynical businessmen with spectaculardemonstrations. He built hundreds, some say two thousand, of the strangestengines the world has ever seen. He used a phraseology and terminology few couldunderstand. He claimed to have found a limitless source of energy locked up inthe grids of the atoms with which he could generate antigravity and disintegratematter. He was the subject of a ruthless exposé after his death. His secret—ifhe ever possessed one—was lost forever with his demise. All of his constructionssave one were lost forever too. There are no personal papers or accounts of hisresearch in existence, and it is doubtful that he actually wrote or assembledsuch papers at all.image [images/9781594775093_018.jpg]Figure 2.1. John Worrell Keely surrounded by his inventionsAll these aspects form but a part of what is still a complex enigma, more than acentury after his death. The name of this man was John Worrell Keely, and eventoday opinions on him are sharply divided. Charlatan or genius, avant-gardephilosopher or obfuscating swindler? It is a question that haunts us still. Instudying his exploits, each corner in his kaleidoscopic career holds a newsurprise. There is so much that is contradictory that the mind is constantlyswayed toward both ends of this spectrum by each turn we take in the study ofhis life and work. For instance, if he was a charlatan, why then were all thefunds he procured apparently invested in his researches and the construction ofhis engines? And if he was a mountebank, why does the only device that is withus today—an incomplete construction—still elicit admiration for the skill,refinement, and incredible workmanship that went into creating this apparatus?On the other hand, if Keely was truthful, why was he unable to produce a workingengine in the twenty-five or more years he was involved in his researches,notwithstanding his many promises to do so?image [images/9781594775093_019.jpg]Figure 2.2. Keely and his famous Dynasphereimage [images/9781594775093_020.jpg]Figure 2.3. Keely and friend with yet another of Keely’s marvelous inventionsSo who was Keely? Was he a self-made scientist operating on the absolute fringesof science, and did he discover by chance something so extraordinary that he wasunable, or was not allowed, to replicate it for the rest of his life, as somehave suggested? Or did he himself exert an influence over his devices, aninfluence that he himself may not have fully realized, one belonging more to therealm of the paranormal, as others have theorized?This is the enigma that is John Worrell Keely. Having written the only biographyof him, titled Free Energy Pioneer: John Worrell Keely, published in 1998 on thecentennial of his death and still in print, even I cannot answer all thesequestions with a ready response. Having no vested interest either way, myresearch then as now focuses primarily on reconstructing an accurate historicalpicture of Keely and his discoveries, something that was clearly lacking when mybiography appeared. Keely, I quickly found out when I started my research in theearly 1990s, was already the stuff of legend, of the folklore that clings to theborders of the history of Western technology and invention, with precious littlein the way of primary and original sources. I was able to remedy this situationwith my biography and correct many an error that had crept into the fiercedebate on what Keely had been and what he accomplished. Until invited to writethis essay, I never suspected to return to this topic—one I treated soexhaustively during the five years it took me in writing my book.The debate on Keely between his apologists and detractors rages on, now as itdid then, and I doubt we will soon see the end of it. This paper introducesKeely once again in the larger history of the search for free and alternativeenergy sources, with the benefit of introducing new and pertinent materials notknown or available to me at the time of the publication of my biography. Thisprompted me to write this paper, so those already familiar with my book and withKeely have new materials at their disposal. What this also means is that themystery of who Keely was, and precisely what influence his ideas have had inother fields, is still a valid subject for research, with the chance always ofuncovering new venues to explore. To those unfamiliar with Keely’s life and workI offer a detailed overview of one of the strangest careers in the nineteenthcentury. And perhaps one day, one of the readers of this paper may stumble onthe key that finally unlocks the secrets Keely took to his grave: access to thatfabulous force locked between the atoms of the ether, and thus usher in a newgolden age for mankind.KEELY’S LIFEBiographical information on Keely is fragmentary, sketchy, and sometimesconflicting. He was born September 3, 1837, either in Philadelphia in atwo-story frame house that stood on the corner of Jacoby and Cherry streets orin the old town of Chester, Pennsylvania. Sometimes his birth year is given as1827. Keely was twice married, the second time in 1887. He left no children. Hisfirst wife and only child had died many years before. Of his second wife, onlyher name, Anna Keely, is known. Keely died in Philadelphia on November 18, 1898.He was buried in the West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, where he hasplot number 313 in the River Section. His grave was unmarked for a century, asituation remedied by Dale Pond and others, who placed a gravestone on thecentennial anniversary of his death on November 18, 1998.His mother’s parents were of English and Swedish descent, his father’s of Germanand French descent. His father was an ironworker.Keely lost his parents in his infancy. His mother never recovered from hisbirth, and his father died before he was three years old. Keely had one brother,J. A. Keely. Since Keely was orphaned in early childhood, they were probablyseparated early. After his father died, Keely came to live with his grandmotherand an aunt, but his aunt passed away before he was sixteen, followed by hisgrandmother a year later. By then, Keely had already left school by the age oftwelve.Somewhere in these early childhood years Keely made his astonishing discoveryand decided to follow that path for the rest of his life. Although contemporarysources contradict each other in certain details, the consensus is that Keelyhad his moment of illumination while observing peculiar effects of sound oncertain objects. Keely too claimed that he started his researches in hischildhood, leading him to his discovery that would haunt him for the rest of hislife: “Before I had reached my tenth year, researching in the realm of acousticphysics had a perfect fascination for me; my whole organism seemed attuned as ifit were a harp of a thousand strings; set for the reception of all theconditions associated with sound force as a controlling medium, positive andnegative; and with an intensity of enjoyment not to be described.”1[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt16]Drawn as he was to this line of research at such an early age, an incidentseveral years later set him on the course that he decided to follow: “The firstmanifestation . . . when I was twelve years old drew my attention to thechannels in which I have since worked.”2 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt17] He nevertold what that manifestation, incident, or discovery exactly was.In his pre–motor fame days Keely held a number of jobs to sustain himself.Contemporary accounts have it that he was employed as a physician, a pharmacist,an upholsterer or a cabinetmaker, a plumber, a plater, and a mason. Onecontemporary source observed that during all this, “He had an inventive geniusand gave much more attention to mechanical problems than to his employment.”3[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt18]On only very rare moments Keely himself confided details of his early life to areporter, and we perceive a glimpse of what must have been a most unusual careerat times:Are you a spiritualist, Mr. Keely? I asked him. That is one of many liespropagated about me, he answered. It has been said I started life as a carpenter(though that is not a slander), but I didn’t: I never was a carpenter. Insteadof being a spiritualist myself, I once exposed spiritualistic mediums in St.Paul, Minn., in 1857, 1859, and 1861, and I was nearly run out of town for doingso. Everything their mediums did in the dark, I did in the light, and thatnaturally enraged them. I do not believe in Spiritualism or in anything of thekind. I am, I hope, a Christian, and a regular member of the Methodist Church. .. .4 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt19]There are claims that Keely actually created a number of curious devices orprototypes of engines very early on in his career. We have a description of whatmay be one of Keely’s very first devices, but unfortunately no date or timeperiod is given. This device “for noting the uniform force of sound vibrations”consisted of a steel bar set full of pins of various lengths, while his first“resonator” or “intensifier” consisted of a shingle screwed to two hollow woodentubes. Keely’s first rudimentary engine was also described as “a simple ring ofsteel with 300 pins set into it, and this first wheel ran in an open box, intoand through which an observer was free to look while the wheel was in motion.”5[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt20]In 1856 Keely was experimenting with a toy engine, the boiler of which was firedby a “burning fluid” lamp in his home on Fifth Street, Philadelphia. In 1863,Keely became employed as a furniture varnisher in the furniture shop of acertain Bennet C. Wilson. Wilson financed Keely’s experiments and provided andfurnished a place on Market Street in which he installed Keely. There Keelyexperimented “year after year” with an engine that he called a “reactingvibratory motor.” This led in 1869 to the construction of a device that can beconsidered the forerunner of his globe motor.Around 1874 Keely moved to a building at 1420 North Twentieth Street inPhiladelphia, where he established his workshop. It was a modest dwelling thathad been formerly used as a stable. Keely used the first floor as a generalstoreroom, where he also conducted his experiments. The second story consistedof three apartments, the first being the office of the inventor, the second theworkshop for his globe motor then in development, with an adjoining room. Hewould occupy this workshop till his death. Currently, the location where hislaboratory once stood is a parking lot. Nothing reminds one of the incrediblelife and career of one of the most enigmatic figures in the annals of free andalternative energy research. But here he would conduct his experiments, holdmany demonstrations, and astonish reporters and witnesses with glimpses of anutterly strange technology, such as a large device meant as an engine for anairship. But the practical applications of this technology, as always, werestill far away. This remained so till the day he died.Keely passed away on November 18, 1898, after having contracted a severe cold.His funeral services were held on November 23, and a large crowd turned out.Anna Keely placed a red heart near the coffin, one half to be buried with Keely,the other half to be taken home with her.During his life a Keely Motor Company was formed in order to fund his work.Stock worth tens of thousands of dollars was sold, but in the end thestockholders were left empty-handed as well. In his incredible career, Keelyinteracted with a host of remarkable historic figures. Thomas Edison and NikolaTesla turned down invitations to witness demonstrations of his engine. JohnJacob Astor invested in him. The founder of theosophy, Helena PetrovnaBlavatsky, wrote about him in her The Secret Doctrine, and after her, a host ofother theosophists did so too.Moreover, he met with a remarkable person who would not only become his moststaunch and trusted advocate, but owing to whom many of the connections abovecame about. She wrote many pamphlets and one book about Keely, and also aidedfinancially to sustain his incredible career. This was Mrs. Bloomfield-Moore,maiden name Clara Sophia Jessup (1824–1899). She supported Keely from 1882 tillthe end, something that is still slightly frowned upon by close family memberseven today. Yet Bloomfield-Moore was an extraordinary and highly intelligentwoman who developed a deep interest in matters scientific and occult. Shecorresponded with hundreds of scientists in all parts of the world, includingTesla, whom she met at least once, writer on the fourth dimension Charles HowardHinton, and early aviation pioneer Hiram Maxim. At one time she offeredfinancial support to Maxim if he would go to America to consult Keely and“become the custodian of the latter’s secret.”Around Bloomfield-Moore, we see a clustering of some of the most famous,wealthy, and influential persons of her day, such as her wealthy acquaintanceJohn Jacob Astor, who once was courted by Nikola Tesla to fund his research. Shealmost constantly remained in London after the death of her husband in 1878.Bloomfield-Moore was also presented to the court of Queen Victoria. Both herdaughters married nobility. One daughter married Swedish Baron Carl von Bildt,who at one time had been secretary of the Swedish Legation in Washington. Herother daughter, Ella, married Count Carl von Rosen, who was first chamberlainand master of ceremonies at the Court of Stockholm, Sweden. It was a son fromthis marriage, Count Eric von Rosen, who, as it was later claimed, allegedlysent unspecified materials pertaining to Keely—named “Keely’s secrets”—toSweden.But there was also another side to her complex character. She gained a mildreputation with the public for eccentricity, possibly because her London homewitnessed visits of those of the occult circles. Bloomfield-Moore’s writings inthemselves are remarkable for their deep esoteric knowledge, but she was not atheosophist herself, according to Count von Rosen, when he was asked thisobvious question: “No. She was interested in the study of theosophy as abroad-minded woman. She was interested speculatively, but did not believe init.”6 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt21]image [images/9781594775093_021.jpg]Figure 2.4. Count Eric von Rosen (1879–1948) as he was in 1919. It is said thathe sent “Keely’s secrets” to Stockholm in 1912. Von Rosen also wasbrother-in-law to Hermann Göring.Although not a theosophist, she developed a relationship with Blavatsky that isdescribed as “long” and “intimate,” and Blavatsky published excerpts of herwritings on Keely in The Secret Doctrine. As a rather interesting detail, butnot one without consequences as we shall see, a son of the marriage of herdaughter Ella, Count Eric von Rosen, had founded the Finnish Air Force in 1918by presenting the White Army its first airplane, a Thulin Parasol fighteraircraft. Count von Rosen, a noted archaeologist, had his arms painted on bothwings’ upper and lower surfaces of the aircraft presented. His arms were a blueswastika on a white background. He had seen these on rune stones in Gotlandwhile still at school.Bloomfield-Moore died only a few months after Keely, and her literary executor,science writer Henry Dam, said, “I knew that when Mr. Keely died she would notlive long. Her whole life was centered in his work to the exclusion of all otherinterests and hopes. She had the most profound faith that neither Mr. Keely orherself could die until the invention had succeeded. After receiving the cabledannouncement of Keely’s death she began to sink rapidly. Her ailment seemed moremental than physical.”7 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt22]A devastating exposé followed, initiated by Clarence Moore, who had alwaysopposed his mother’s backing of Keely. After Keely died, Moore and a number ofscientists entered his workshop, where, as published in the newspapers, theyfound hidden tubes, wires, and a motor in the basement. Their verdict wassimple: there was no mysterious force, and there never had been. All theseyears, Moore claimed, Keely had bamboozled his audiences by spinning his engineswith the help of these hidden tubes through which compressed air was pumped, andwith hidden levers, springs, and that machine in the basement.KEELY’S DISCOVERIESSince we have no detailed records by the hand of Keely himself, trying toestablish a coherent pattern in his researches and inventions is a dauntingtask. Although there is an abundance of contemporary sources, with recollectionsof persons who each gave their viewpoints and offered various statements on thematter, we still are faced with a jumble of dates, descriptions, andrecollections sometimes made years after their alleged occurrences and the factthat Keely suddenly and radically altered his line of research in the 1880s.Roughly speaking then, there were two periods in Keely’s researches andexperiments. The first period ran more or less from 1874, the year he started tooccupy his workshop, to 1882. This period may very well have started some yearsearlier, considering the various tales of prototype devices he had constructedas early as 1856 and possibly even before.It is also alleged that Keely’s motor began to attract attention as early as1865.8 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt23] Around 1871, Keely, again working toputting his discovery to practical, commercial use, announced his invention tothe public. Keely, or so it is said, placed an ad in a Philadelphia eveningpaper “relating to a new motor, or motive power, which he alleged he hadinvented or discovered and was prepared to exhibit.”9[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt24] This new motor was named the globe motor,presumably because it consisted of a hollow sphere that revolved at great speedand, as Keely declared, automatically. This first period was marked by theproduction of force, what was later called etheric vapor, by the disintegrationof water. This Keely accomplished with several of his engines, such as a deviceknown as his liberator, and we have several accounts that serve as anillustration of Keely’s experimental activities during that period. It wasexplained that the etheric vapor was obtained by letting the water into thedisintegrator or liberator at a certain pressure. Its aim was to disintegratewater into etheric vapor.In 1871 Keely pursued his investigations in an effort to work out thisdiscovery, using the two elements water and air in connection with soundvibrations. In 1872 Keely allegedly made his discovery of an energy that hecalled “the force” by accident while experimenting with vibrations. He then“imprisoned the ether” the same year and “commenced his experiments with etherin the winter on 1872–’73.”10 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt25] At first Keely hadno idea what he had found, as he readily admitted. It would take him twelveyears before he realized he had “imprisoned the ether.”Between 1871 and 1875, Keely also constructed six different devices. At thattime thirty-four documents were in existence relating to the transfer ofinterests in inventions that were called an independent flywheel, the hydropneumatic pulsating vacuo engine, the globe motor, the dissipating engine, themultiplicator or generator, and the automatic water lift. The first assignmentwas dated July 11, 1871, the last, February 15, 1875.11[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt26]Keely’s globe motor, although exhibited in operation around 1871, was neverpatented. What was found during an investigation in 1875 was “on record in LiberL, 18, page 370, of transfer of patents, U.S. Patent Office, an assignment ofthis so-called globe motor by Mr. Collier to the Keely Motor Company, thisassignment bearing date February 15, 1875, and being recorded May 8, 1875.”12[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt27] The patent office at that time also had anabstract of “all assignments, agreements, licenses, powers of attorney and otherinstruments in writing on record” in the name of John W. Keely since January 1,1871. However, there does exist a patent by Keely, granted August 15, 1871, forhis fly-wheel, an arrangement of gearing for causing a wheel to revolve at agreater speed than the shaft to which it is hung.13[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt28]In 1872 Keely constructed a new motor at his place in Market Street. This secondmotor was variously called the hydraulic motor, the hydro vacuo engine, thehydro pneumatic vacuum engine, and the hydro pneumatic pulsating vacuum engine.A New Yorker who claimed to have known him during that time later wrote, “I waswith him when the idea first entered his head that he could combine steam andwater to run an engine. At that time he made a crude machine, which he actuallyran for some time; and this was the model of thePneumatic-Pulsating-Vacuo-Engine. . . . In those days I have known him to selland pawn everything of value in his house to obtain means to continue hisinvestigation with the money thus acquired.”14 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt29]This model was subsequently located at 1010 Ogden Street in Philadelphia, whereKeely was then living as well. The model was described as an engine placed in abathtub and run by a stream of water that passed through a goose quill. Thisdevice “soon grew into the machine which he called a ‘generator,’ and which theworld named the Keely motor, and in which power was produced from the vibratoryqualities of water and air.”15 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt30] Elsewhere it isclaimed, though, that the generator not so much evolved out of his hydropneumatic pulsating vacuo engine, but that after its construction, Keely “took anew departure,” which culminated in the so-called Keely motor, or, as it hasbeen termed, “a dissipating engine and multiplicator and generator.”16[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt31]While working with his generator one day in 1873, Keely suddenly felt a coldvapor blow in his face. He tried to wipe away the moisture but was surprised tofind “there was none upon his countenance. The curious phenomenon of a vaporthat was absolutely dry caused him to take up a new line of experiment.”17[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt32] This mysterious vapor was described as “aheretofore unknown gaseous or vaporic substance,” and it was the power on whichthe generator—also termed the dissipator or the Keely motor—worked.18[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt33][Keely being] . . . a poor man, but, having a wonderful degree of naturalmechanical skill . . . devoted all his time for the past fourteen years toexperiments with water with a view of procuring a motive power from it. He wasengaged upon an idea of his own regarding the force of columns of water one daywhen he accidentally discovered the vapor which he has harnessed. He studied thesubject, ascertained how it was generated, learned its power, and thenceforthapplied himself solely to the perfection of this idea, working night and day fora number of years, until his efforts were crowned with success.19[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt34]Since the above quote is taken from an article written in 1875, this would implythat Keely was involved in this line of research since 1861.Elsewhere it is claimed that in 1873 Keely became known as the discoverer of anew power, “which he had not then been able to utilize, to operate machinery,but which could be supplied in limitless quantities at practically no cost. . .. He said himself that he made the discovery in 1872, but then had no idea ofits origin or laws. He gave no indication of its character, but kept the secretwithin his own breast until such time as patents could be secured.”20[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt35]Keely did attempt to secure a patent on his device. There exists a patentapplication by Keely that was filed on November 14, 1872, titled “Specificationdescribing a new and useful Hydro Vacuo Engine, invented by John W. Keely of theCity and County of Philadelphia and state of Pennsylvania.” Keely’s machine isdescribed as, “The end and design of the invention is an engine wherein theactuating power is produced by a vacuum in connection with water pressure.”21[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt36]Yet nothing came of his application. When information on this application wasgathered around 1875, a search of the records of the patent office brought tolight an abandoned application for a patent for the hydro-vacuo engine.. . . the said application having been filed November 14, 1872. . . . At therequest of the applicant’s attorney, a model was dispensed with by theauthorities in the first instance; but on November 26, 1872, a working model wasdemanded before the examination could be completed. Whenever an application fora patent is of doubtful practicability, or based on what is believed to be afallacy, it is the practice of the patent office authorities to demand a workingmodel, and to refuse to examine the case until the demand is complied with.Nothing was done in this case of Keely’s until March 20, 1874, when he appointedMr. J. Snowden Bell, now the mechanical associate of Mr. Collier, to prosecutethe application; but as two years elapsed without any action, the applicationwas thereby under the law abandoned.22 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt37]There are rumors of subsequent patents and the assignment of rights. Wilson forinstance claimed that Keely had assigned to him “one full half ownership” of theprinciples or machine that he built in 1869. The other rumors stem in allprobability from the 1871 patent, which was granted directly to the assignees,two unidentified persons who at first advanced money for the further developmentof the globe motor and the hydro-pneumatic-vacuo engine, or his patentapplication in 1872.A mysterious patent that Keely supposedly requested on November 26, 1873, and ofwhich it was remarked that the accompanying drawings “are now lost,” neverexisted. In contemporary sources there is no further reference to other patents.The machines that Keely built during his first period were of megalithicproportions, one weighing as much as twenty-two tons. Most were implemented bythe Atlantic Works and the Delaware Iron Works of Philadelphia. They werescrapped in turn as they were superseded by smaller, more sophisticated models.His generator of 1878 weighed about three tons and occupied a space five feetlong and high with a width of two feet. It contained small spherical chambers,“mathematically differentiated in size,” connected vertically by “tubularprocesses of iron, and irregularly by smaller ones of copper. One quart of waterfills all the chambers and tubes intended to be filled.”23[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt38]The generator, upright in position, had five distinct parts or columns, calledthe central column, two side columns, and the front and back stand-tubes. Thestand-tubes, although similar in appearance, were opposite in action. The twoside columns were alike. The central or main column was larger than the otherfour combined and was “more complex in structure.” Air was water-locked in someof the chambers and tubes, where “introductory impulses” were fed to the waterso that its equilibrium was disturbed. This disturbance was effected by themovement of an outside lever operating a four-way valve within. There were noother metallic movements inside except the working of three independent valves.The apparatus was therefore considered “practically without wear and not liableto get out of order.”24 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt39]The generator used but one quart of water to produce fifty-four thousand poundsof pressure per square inch. No heat, electricity, or chemicals were used, andit was claimed that output remained constant regardless of the work effected.The generator was one of two mechanisms Keely built during this period, theother being the engine. The generator produced the force that the engine used.These two devices were what is commonly referred to as the Keely motor. Thevaporic substance was the medium of the force that it carried.The second period in Keely’s researches ran from 1882 until Keely died. Keelyhad for ten years made demonstrations of the liberation of the energy he claimedto have discovered while experimenting with vibrations in 1872. But his effortsto construct an engine that he had promised the Keely Motor Company failed. Theexplanation on offer is that Keely was pursuing his researches on the line ofinvention instead of discovery, and all his thoughts were concentrated in thisdirection up to 1882. Frequently, in his constant failures to construct anengine that would keep up the rotary motion of the ether, explosions occurred,and Keely scrapped engine prototypes and sold their remains as old metal.In this period of constant frustration, Keely discovered a force derived fromthe vibration of an unknown fluid or substance, locked between the atoms of theether. This he called the vibratory force or the etheric force. It was thisforce that, according to Keely, was not like steam, electricity, compressed air,or galvanism. While, during the first period, Keely obtained his force throughthe disintegration of water, during the second period Keely developed his force“in the air, in a vacuum, in the ether itself,” or by the vibrating of hydrogen,which Keely first attempted around 1884 on the suggestion of Bloomfield-Moore.Up until 1888, Keely continued trying to construct a “perfect engine,” whichcould hold the ether in “a rotating ring of etheric force.” Toward the end of1888, Keely entirely abandoned his concept of the perfect machine. Up to thistime he practically built his research equipment himself. Around 1888, Keely wasto be provided with the best instruments opticians could build for him based onthe models or designs he furnished.During this second period the miniaturization of his engines continued for aconsiderable degree. From 1882 to 1884 the Generator was a structure six feetlong and correspondingly wide and high. A machine built in 1885 that he namedthe Liberator was somewhat smaller than “a lady’s round worktable.” Continuingon this path of miniaturization, Keely “within one year made such an astonishingprogress . . . as to combine the production of the power, and the operation ofthe cannon, his engine and his Disintegrator in a machine no larger than adinner plate, and only three or four inches in thickness. This instrument wascompleted in 1886.”25 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt40] When Keely beganexperimenting with his discovery of another principle—one of the reasons theKeely Motor Company took him to court, the others his failure to secure patentson his former discovery and his failure to construct a commercially succesfuldevice—his engines became even smaller in size, “and the size of the instrumentused now, ’88, for the same purposes is no larger than an old-fashioned silverwatch, such as we see in Museum collections.”26 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt41]In his productive career Keely built between 129 and two thousand experimentaldevices, but as far as is known, never once more than one of each. This enormousnumber was reached because of the special requirements that Keely had. Hisengines needed a perfect construction, and if a device possessed but one littleunevenness or imbalance, he considered the engine worthless, one of the reasonsfor this being that Keely worked with enormous pressure forces. In his searchfor perfection, vast sums of money were expended on machines that sometimeswould not even be used when ready. One device had cost $40,000, and when readywas rejected by Keely because he claimed there was “a flaw in it.” Keely“thought nothing of spending $20,000 for a piece of machinery, and a few weeksafterwards throwing it aside as useless.”27 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt42]Other devices were made of special metal alloys; his generator was made ofAustrian gun metal “in one solid piece.” It would hold about ten or twelvegallons of water and was four or five inches thick, made “to handle the veryheavy pressure of 20,000 to 30,000 pounds of vapor to the square inch.” Otherparts were made of welded iron “of great thickness and strength.” Then there wasthe adjusting of the machinery, which seems to have been a difficult affair“when it is considered that Keely experimented with 129 machines during hiscareer as an inventor, and that one after another of these was made to specialmeasurements, to be thrown into the scrap-pile. . . . Many of these machinescalled for the most delicate adjustment and the most consumate skill of theartisan.”28 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt43]image [images/9781594775093_022.jpg]Figure 2.5. This broken glass plate was discovered by Jeff Behary, hidden awayfor almost a century in Kinraide’s basement laboratory. As far as we know, thisis the last photo made of Keely’s globe motor.

Keely and colleagues at the height of his most inventive stageOf all the engines Keely built, photographic evidence exists of only a merefraction. The devices on these photos have such wonderful names as the compounddisintegrator, the vibratory globe machine, the resonator, the rotating globe,which worked through human magnetism, a number of vibratory discs, thespirophone, the pneumatic gun, the provisional engine, the globe motor, thevibrating planetary globe, the wave plates, the planetary system engine, theliberator, the vibrodyne or vibratory accumulator, the vibratory switch, and thesympathetic negative transmitter. It is the same with written descriptions ofhis devices. For these we have to rely largely on eyewitness accounts scatteredin contemporary newspapers.At the time of Keely’s death in 1898, a new engine was in its completion stage,which Keely expected to have in running order the following year. The machinehad the same shape as Keely’s globe motor, only larger. It was made out ofcopper with a globe about two feet in diameter and weighing seventy-five pounds.The final mechanism was three feet in diameter and built of decarbonized steel,weighing six hundred pounds. Its whereabouts—if it still exists—are currentlyunknown.NEW DEVELOPMENTSMore than half a century after Keely’s death and the ensuing tumult over hislegacy and his devastating exposé, Keely’s nephew was located and interviewed.He was an old man at that time and professed that he never had much confidencein Keely’s experiments, but he recalled how Bloomfield-Moore sent “many ofKeely’s secrets” to Count Eric von Rosen. He apparently sent this material toStockholm in 1912, and nothing more was heard of these “secrets.” Perhaps theseconsisted of the materials, mainly photographs of various engine-like deviceswith the handwriting of Bloomfield-Moore on several of them, which werepublished in 1972 in Sweden.Eric von Rosen was also to become brother-in-law to Hermann Göring when thesister of his wife married Göring. Göring, the World War I ace aviator, onceflew Eric von Rosen in bad weather from Stockholm to Rockelstad Castle. Due tothis bad weather Göring had to stay over. And while he noted a swastika over thehearth place, it was his meeting with his future wife, as she descended thestairs in that ancient castle, which connected him with a very secretivesisterhood, the Edelweiss Gesellschaft. There is a letter in existence whereGöring describes his feelings, seated in contemplation in the small chapel thatthis sisterhood had.Although this strange turn of events would have no place in the history ofKeely, it is well worth mentioning it for the following reason. In seeking toestablish what quarters upheld an interest in Keely’s discoveries even after hisexposé, ironically conducted by Bloomfield-Moore’s son Clarence, I found anintriguing allusion pertaining to certain experiments conducted in the ThirdReich. Briefly, the context of these experiments was the search for alternativemeans of creating fuel for the German war machine, as Germany had no oilreserves of its own. But it did have large quantities of coal. It used a processcalled the Fischer-Tropsch method to create oil from gas. But there is a hintthat there was another process in existence with which Nazi Germany wasallegedly able to refine oil into various usable components using certain soundwaves. Or so it was claimed by prisoner of war Josef Ernst to his Englishcaptors.The document in question, the British Intelligence Objectives SubcommitteeReport Number 142, reads in part, “Ernst claimed to have invented a process forthe separation of petrol from oil by the use of vibrations of audible frequency.This method was developed from the Kelly process in use in the U.S.A. The crudeoil is passed through glass tubes suspended above a plate of ‘pertinax,’ whichis caused to vibrate at frequencies on the Pythagoras tone-scale. The frequencyis altered according to the product required. . . . This process was operated atthe wells near Hamburg owned by the S.S. and many tons of petrol were produced.These factories were probably destroyed, but the apparatus is possibly in thesouth of Germany.”29 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt44] It is clear from thedescription that by “Kelly” John Keely is meant.So on one hand we have a direct connection between one of the future leaders ofthe infamous Third Reich and the one person alleged to have transported certainmaterials pertaining to Keely to Sweden.While there is no verifiable documentation at hand that would enable us toreconstruct without doubt the conduit through which information on Keelytraveled to the heart of the dark empire, if at all, we must bear in mind thatnews on Keely was published in nineteenth-century Germany as well. Thesecoincidences give food for thought and may merit a closer inspection into theirrationalist belief systems of Nazi Germany, especially in regards to the manyrumors about new and outré forms of technology said to have been in developmentthere. Be this as it may, the statement above by German prisoner of war JosefErnst is, to my mind, the only contemporary account of a technology either inuse or in development based on Keely’s discoveries, even long after he had beendiscarded by conventional science and he was delegated to the occult fringesassociated with theosophy. And even there the exposé by Clarence Moore causedsome uncomfortable mutterings.Then there is the subsequent fate of some of Keely’s engines, interwoven withthe strange story of Thomas Burton Kinraide of Jamaica Plain, Boston. The firstdirect reference to Kinraide—apart from appearing on the list of pallbearers atKeely’s funeral—appeared in the press eight days after Keely’s death.[Kinraide] . . . came on to Philadelphia after Mr. Keely died, was at the houseevery day between the death and the funeral; rode with Mrs. Keely in the samecarriage to the cemetery and returned with her to the house. . . . Several yearsago, it is said, he appeared at the Keely establishment and has been a constantvisitor and intimate of the family ever since. He remained on some of his visitsas long as four or five weeks, during which time he devoted day after day to thestudy of the Keely motor, remaining in the room with it for hours at a time.30[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt45]image [images/9781594775093_024.jpg]Figure 2.7. Thomas Burton Kinraide (1864– 1927), last inheritor of Keely’slegacy. Photo © Jeff Behary, c/o the Turn of the Century Electrotherapy MuseumA contemporary investigation into the background of this man yielded someintriguing details:It was discovered that he was a man of great wealth and lived in princelyfashion in the vicinity of Boston. It was also learned that he was a scientistwith theories of his own almost as remarkable as those advanced by Keely. LikeKeely, he pursued discovery on the tones of vibration, and in order to conductsome special experiments, he had a huge cave hewn out of the solid rock on hisestate, which he fitted up as a laboratory. During experiments, Kinraide hadsucceeded in obtaining rotary motion on the compass needle from vibrations.31[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt46]On December 28, 1898, Keely’s engines were shipped to Boston. But, contrary towhat has always been suggested by later researchers into this part of themystery, not all of Keely’s engines were to go to Kinraide’s laboratory:All the devices of the late John W. Keely that are held to be of importance inconnection with the experiments to be made by T. B. Kinraide, of Boston, will beshipped to-day, to be placed in his laboratory. The more delicate machines andparts have been in safe keeping in the vaults of the Land Title and TrustCompany, having been placed there shortly after the death of Mr. Keely. CharlesS. Hill, of Boston, attorney for Mrs. Keely, was in the city yesterday, and withMr. Kinraide supervised the work of moving the machines. . . . Mr. Hill saysthat the older machines and those which Mr. Kinraide believes will be of nopractical value in his work, will be stored by the Keely Motor Company in thiscity, and that a room will be rented for that purpose.32[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt47]Hill personally escorted Keely’s engines to Boston. Whatever was left of Keely’sengines at that time still must have been substantial since its inventory, filedon January 3, the same day Keely’s devices arrived in Boston, made a referenceto “fifteen pieces of experimental apparatus,” and a Boston newspaper wrote,“Twenty large packing cases have arrived here, containing the material part ofthe famous Keely motor. T. B. Kinraide, an inventor, ordered the boxes removedto his laboratory. There he will experiment in trying to supply whatever islacking in mechanism.”33 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt48]Interviewed by a reporter, Kinraide told him thathe had often talked with Mr. Keely on the principles of his invention. He neverfully explained the secret of his perpetual motion to me, said Mr. Kinraide, butI feel that I know more of the motor than any other man. Mr. Keely, after beingtaken ill, expressed the wish that I be allowed to carry out his inventions.Before the hour set for the interview had arrived the inventor was pastrecovery. It was, however, at Mr. Keely’s request and that of Mrs. Keely that Ihave consented to conduct these experiments.34 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt49]So Keely’s engines, which were already crated on December 20, were at this stagestored at two places: the contents of twenty large crates were on Kinraide’sestate on Jamaica Plain in the vicinity of Boston, where his laboratory wassituated, and in Philadelphia, where Keely’s “mechanical property” was removedand stored in a building on North Broad Street. Apart from the machinery thatwas moved to Boston, the “heavier apparatus” was relocated to a storehouse atBroad and Vine Streets, possibly the same storehouse on Broad Street. In a safedeposit vault of the Land Title and Trust Company were placed Keely’sdisintegrator and other “fine pieces of machinery,” his sensitized disks, wiresand other objects. Before being placed in the vault, the disintegrator made ashort stop at the Hotel Stratford, where it was examined by John J. Smith of theKeely Motor Company, Kinraide, and Hill.Perhaps a detailed inventory was made of the devices left at Keely’s death andshowing which devices Kinraide obtained, but if so, it has not survived. We aretherefore left with superficial descriptions that Kinraide obtained Keely’s“remarkable machines, vibrators, lever machine and others used by Keely.” It wassuggested that Kinraide also obtained Keely’s latest engine, work on which wasalmost finished at the time of his death. It resembled Keely’s globe motor butwas larger, with a two-foot copper globe weighing seventy-five pounds and themechanism made out of decarbonized steel weighing six hundred pounds.Then Clarence Moore once again made a detrimental statement. He told a reporterthatMr. T. B. Kinraide, of Jamaica Plain, Boston, on whom the mantle of Keely wassupposed to have fallen, and who actually did receive the Keely motor mechanismearly in January, admits that the motor was a fraud, that the machinery wasmoved by well-known forces, and that the duplication of Keely’s “demonstrations”is a simple matter. When Mr. Kinraide was reported, a short time ago, to havereturned the Keely motor machinery to Philadelphia, the inevitable conclusionwas forced on any one conversant with the history of the Keely motor that Mr.Kinraide, having discovered the nature of the fraud, washed his hands of thewhole affair. It seems however, that Mr. Kinraide did not send the apparatusback, but got to the heart of the delusion by a careful study of the motors inhand.35 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt50]According to an unnamed informant, during this “careful study” Kinraide hadfitted up the machine room in his cave at Jamaica Plain “almost exactly afterthe manner of Keely’s, suggesting that he had begun on the premise that he mustreproduce the whole thing if desirious of success.”36[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt51] Then, Kinraide had walked around the machines forsome time, and “at last he turned and smilingly remarked that he might excelKeely at his own trickery if he had the same fluency of words as the latter.”37[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt52] Kinraide had applied compressed air, hydraulicpressure, and a powerful spring, and even a magnet concealed in the wall. Thehydraulic pressure and compressed air came from “hidden sources.” With the helpof all this, Kinraide obtained the same results. “One of the most unique piecesof mechanism I found in Philadelphia,” Kinraide reportedly said, “was a spring,to wind which it is necessary to use a key as big as a crowbar.” With the properwinding the spring would be able to “run for three or four days” and producesenormous energy. Kinraide also showed how he could start the hydraulic andcompressed air pressure by picking up a violin, after which the “instrumentwheels began to revolve” because he touched “a bulb” hidden under the floor atthe same time.38 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt53]It took the unnamed informant nearly eight hours spent in Kinraide’s laboratory,“and when the Philadelphian emerged he was convinced that he had lost hisinvestment.”39 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt54] Kinraide repeated that those whowould produce evidence of being “victimized” could obtain an invitation forvisiting Kinraide’s laboratory and “see the whole thing disclosed.” Kinraiderefused entrance to reporters, “for it has been decreed that, as far as thepublic is concerned, the Keely affair can rest in peace and the Keely victimshave their sorrows to themselves.”40 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt55] So goes theClarence Moore report.Since publishing my research results in 1998, new information with a startlingoutcome in regard to Thomas Burton Kinraide has come to light. These newdiscoveries were made by Jeff Behary, owner and proprietor of The Turn of theCentury Electrotherapy Museum in Florida. I am happy to publish, in his ownwords, his quest for Thomas Burton Kinraide, his trek to his onetime residenceat Jamaica Plain, and the stunning treasure that he found hidden away, untouchedfor decades. The following words are Behary’s.JEFF BEHARY’S ACCOUNT OF THE HIDDEN TREASUREMy research of Thomas Burton Kinraide began around 1995. I had begun reading afascinating book called High-Frequency Currents by Frederick Finch Strong. Thisbook was unusual on many levels—its primary subject was the therapeutic use ofTesla coils. This book is filled with rare information, but one paragraph stoodout in my mind for no clear or apparent reason—a paragraph where Strongdescribes witnessing X rays of enormous power in Kinraide’s laboratory. Hestated that Kinraide was the first person to X-ray the entire human trunk, andthen went on to describe the apparatus. Strong was a curious man on many levels.He invented a form of vacuum electrode that later flooded the medical Tesla coilmarket and received no credit for it in time. A decade later, he decided towrite the history of Tesla coils and give himself his proper spot in thetimeline as it were. Had he not done this, the information would be lost today,not only of his work but his friends as well as competitors. It was an unusualthing to do, because the field itself was relatively new—he wrote the book in1908, and most of the subject matter was post-1896. But, as often is the case,the first decade of an invention’s existence is often the most important.Perhaps it was a realization that this great man Strong was first inspired bythis mysterious Kinraide fellow. I sought to find more on who Kinraide was,because on the pages that followed I saw a photo of Kinraide’s machine and thedescription was quite unusual as far as Tesla coils were concerned. It appearedon many levels to be an engineering marvel of its own right, and even theappearance was quite unlike the hundreds of similar apparatus that flooded themarket later on. This apparatus was unique, unusual, and by Strong’sdescription, efficient beyond imagination.For years I searched with little success. I was relentless, sometimes searchinguntil 2:00 a.m. in vain for information. It became an unusual obsession, analmost impossible quest. Finally, I decided to try and recreate Kinraide’sapparatus only from the brief description in Strong’s book. To my surprise, Ihad instant success with this unusual venture. I immediately posted photos to mywebsite, mainly in efforts to share the marvelous efficiency of my crude machineto my friends and colleagues. In the Tesla arena, this was virtually unchartedterritory—and that is always exciting. These were the days of dial-up modems,and in updating my site I would confirm the sending of everything before bed andsimply check everything upon waking up the next morning. It sometimes tookhours.I knew Kinraide was from Boston, in a small town, Jamaica Plain. That night, Idreamed that Rita and I traveled to Boston in search of Kinraide’s work. In mydream, we were on a bus and there were two laughing and giggling teenage girlssitting ahead of us. My wife and I were discussing the idea of opening a coffeeshop (which we had been discussing in real life). The girls turned around, andone looked me dead in the eye and said, “If you like coffee, go to the JuneBug!” I immediately awoke from the weird dream and stumbled into the other roomto check if the uploads worked. They were complete. It was around 2:30 a.m., andI decided to Google “June Bug Boston.” To my surprise, there was a coffee shopwith the name “June Bug Café” in Jamaica Plain. How unusual! I couldn’t believeit.The next day, I told my wife of the story, who rolled her eyes a bit at yetanother story of me and my Kinraide quest. I never forgot that dream. I refinedmy Kinraide invention and slowly incorporated other of his inventions into itsconstruction. The next reproduction of Kinraide’s invention was around a yearlater, and that night I didn’t have any strange dreams. But the next day, Ireceived a call out of the blue from Gerald Zeitlin, a retired anesthesiologistand historian, who introduced himself as standing by the grave of William JamesMorton in Forrest Hills Cemetery, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. I wasastonished. Morton was a friend of Strong and Kinraide’s. I asked Gerald if heknew the June Bug, and he laughed, remarking that it was a small shop down theroad. I instantly booked tickets to Boston. If the dream wasn’t a strange formof “sign,” the phone call definitely was. To wait a month for this travel wasagonizing, so I focused on building a small Kinraide invention to pass the time.The next day, I found a Kinraide patent for sale in England. I bought itimmediately and had it shipped airmail, international express. I had only twoweeks and feared I wouldn’t receive it in time. However, against all odds, itarrived in a few days. Written on the patent was Kinraide’s street address inJamaica Plain. I had not expected this, because in U.S. patents only the countywas required information. I Googled the address and found a phone number. Thepoor owner must have been bewildered to receive a call from a complete strangerregarding the man who built his home. “Kinraide built this house, but is a bitof a legend here. No one knew who he was.”image [images/9781594775093_025.jpg]Figure 2.8. Ravenscroft: the house of Kinraide, with a large laboratory in thebasement where Keely’s engines were shipped for experimentation. © Jeff Behary,c/o the Turn of the Century Electrotherapy MuseumHe was kind enough to grant me permission to visit his home. I was not expectingthe mansion that awaited me. Having said that, days before I called him just toconfirm when I could meet him. Unfortunately he was called out of town for afamily emergency, but he still granted me access to his beautiful house throughthe generous help of one of his employees. Once in the house, I was shown aroundtwenty-five rooms, but the most unusual was a hidden ballroom—a secret door towhich was a moving wall next to a large safe. The walls were all solid mahogany,and there were hunted taxidermy animals that Kinraide shot that looked partiallyalive, as if they were watching the inhabitants of the home. It was surreal.There were beautiful brass chandeliers that could be used as gas lights if thepower failed. The home was elegant beyond imagination. I asked to see thebasement. I was taken downstairs with Rita, and in the basement I noticed ablocked door that appeared as a small closet. I asked to see inside, and the manshowing us around remarked if we wanted in there I’d have to move the host ofitems that were blocking the entrance myself. I did so gladly, and on openingthe door noticed a stack of old windows and some wood. As I turned around inthis room, which was nearly black from the lack of lighting, I saw one wallappeared to go a bit farther than the outside would hint to. It was actuallymuch larger, and using the flash of my camera for eyes, I inched my way to whatseemed to be another room. It was! I saw an old radio, a large painted boardthat read “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star,” and stacks of mahogany. Then thereappeared to be crates of some kind. Still blind with only the camera flash forsight, I snapped photos and saw that the crates contained glass negatives. I wasalmost shaking as I removed one from the crate. The plates were of sparks, and Iknew that Kinraide made electrographs that, according to a top X-ray pioneer,“would have astonished Faraday beyond words.”Moments later I picked up a glass negative and saw the Keely motor. I was almostin tears. My wife, who for years had put up with my madness in this pointlessquest, was in tears when I showed her the photo. More than a decade of illogicalsearching was suddenly worthwhile. We managed to find an extension cord and hada single lamp. The rooms were blasted out of rock like tunnels in caves, andthey continued to circle around the basement. The next room contained theremains of Kinraide’s experiments that I read about in 1995, ten years prior.The room that followed contained more mysteries and treasures. I asked the manwho was helping us to call the owner of the home. I explained to him that Ifound hidden treasures beneath the house, and this complete stranger told methat my search was meant to be and to take them! It was approaching evening, andI asked if we could return the following day (Saturday) to pack up the items.The man agreed, and we went to dinner. It was the most exciting day of ourlives.However, that night at dinner, Rita remarked that I lost my wedding ring. Ilooked down and couldn’t believe it. The ring was normally so tight on my fingerI could only remove it after minutes of prying with soap and cursing at theabrasions of twisting and turning it over my knuckle. The ring was platinum, andmy wife spent quite a bit of money to obtain it. We couldn’t forget it amongstthe other treasures. So the next day, the man let us back in the basement andtold us he had to go and would be back in a few hours. My wife took a stroll tothe local post office to get a heap of priority mail boxes. I was alone in thehouse. In looking through some of the negatives, I noticed in the dim lightingof the room that there was handwriting on the moldy paper envelope that theywere contained in. I decided to walk outside to have a better look in the light.I took out the camera and decided to document a historic find of Kinraide’shandwriting. However, after the flash, I looked down to see the part of the wordI was trying to decipher was gone. Perhaps the fragile paper fell apart when Iwas walking? I retraced my steps carefully, and it was nowhere to be found. Iwas bewildered and frustrated at this; what’s the chance of finding an autographand then losing it! As I went back down to the basement, a large oil furnacethat was completely silent previously started to rumble and thunder and make alot of noise. I heard that they could be noisy, but didn’t imagine in this way.I then got a feeling as if I was being watched. Not the typical feeling though;this time every hair on the back of my neck stood up.I was actually afraid. I turned to look at the entrance of the rooms and sensedsomething or someone. I took a photo. I looked at the photo. At that point Ifroze in place and was shaking. I never saw such a shape in the tens ofthousands of photos I’ve taken before. It was as if something was sitting in thedoorway. I wondered if I was correct in my actions at the home. My wife returnedand found me in a state of fright. I only handed her the camera, and on seeingthe image she was amazed!The picture matched an electrical form that Kinraide called an “electricentity.” I also later learned it matched so-called orb photos, as well as dustparticles captured by flash photography. However, under the circumstances, thepremonition of fear leads me to believe that T. B. Kinraide wanted toacknowledge my presence. And then, typical of my wife, she remarked, “I don’tcare if there’s a ghost. You’re still finding your wedding ring!” The firstthought was to check where the coils were, as I had to dig a bit in the darkthrough wax and rosin to find them. We had no luck. But knowing of Kinraide’sfailed marriage, Rita exclaimed while digging, “I know your marriage wasn’tgood, but it doesn’t mean you can take our ring!” I took her picture.We never found the ring. We did pack thirty-two boxes and managed to ship themfrom the local post office. They were happy to see us leave after that! Thirtyof the thirty-two boxes arrived on Monday back in South Florida. Next to thestack of boxes, at around 3:30 p.m., I walked up to the front door and saw mywedding ring on the ground. Perhaps it fell out of one of them. Or maybe, justmaybe, Kinraide decided to give it back!Since then I returned to Ravenscroft once. I searched with Kinraide’sgranddaughter’s husband for signs of the Keely motor. We had little time, andthe frost on the ground made it hard to decipher what was under the frozendirt/rock/rotting leaves floor. We did find the original oil-filled X-ray coilthat Kinraide made the first intense X rays with, as mentioned in the Strongbook. Kinraide placed it in an oak box lined with copper. A curious chainassembly was also found inside this box, and after further inspection we foundthat he had been running the coil in the back of a Victorian toilet tank! Iguess if it was watertight, it would be oil-tight too! Plus he could “flush” theoil to change connections and fine-tune the coils before reinsulating with oil.History is stranger than fiction.In walking out, I found in the area where the original Keely negatives were asingle piece of torn paper with the words “Keely M . . .” written on top. Partof the original envelope that was rotting off of the negative I found two yearsearlier. I believe that Kinraide demonstrated the motor in the rooms I wasexploring. I personally believe that there were elements of fraud in Keely’smotor. Either way, I think it makes him one of the most interesting people inAmerican history. If he was a fraud, so be it, but a genius, well, there was noquestion. I am sure that any negative publicity that came out of this broughtKinraide much grief on many levels. Who would want to see a friend defamed, muchless be the one to have to deliver the news? Since the discovery of Kinraide’slab, I have learned countless things that should have been lost a century ago.The Keely motor is only one piece of the puzzle. In time, it might be surprisingwhat we find. If I hit the lottery for millions, I would offer every cent to buythat home. I would give up millions, even at the thought of remaining virtuallypenniless, just to pursue the dream that wasn’t pointless!And so, in closing with Jeff Behary’s remarkable account, we have taken thehistory of the Keely enigma one step further. We were able to uncover cryptictraces of what appears to have been a technological process in Nazi Germanybased on Keely’s discoveries, and we have been able to travel inside Kinraide’slaboratory—the final resting place of Keely’s mysterious engine. There is stillmuch to be uncovered, and who knows what the future has in store for us?image [images/9781594775093_026.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"3VIKTOR SCHAUBERGERA BRIEF OVERVIEW OF HIS THEORIES ON ENERGY, MOTION, AND WATERCallum Coats How could we have missed this universal machine? Why have we ignored the vortex,the workhorse of the universe?WILLIAM BAUMGARTNERVIKTOR SCHAUBERGER, THE MANThroughout recorded history humanity has been periodically uplifted by thecontributions of a few gifted and enlightened individuals whose teachings andphilosophies have gradually raised the level of human awareness, with Buddha,Jesus Christ, and the Prophet Mohammed being the most illustrious examples ofindividuals who have produced far-reaching changes in the consciousness ofhumanity. Lesser mortals have also played a vital role in this process, and theseeding of human consciousness with higher truths always seems to come at a timewhen humankind as a whole is ready to receive them.It is sometimes said these great teachers, themselves ardent students of Natureand the Divine, live ahead of their time. These exceptional individuals areindeed visionaries in the truest sense of the word, for they are endowed with afar higher sense of perception than their contemporaries. For their work anenormous dedication and courage is necessary. Historically—and ViktorSchauberger was no exception—the lives such individuals have led, or have had tolead, have been dogged with confrontation, difficulty, doubt, and the greatloneliness of the pathfinder. As pioneers, apart from breaking new ground, theyoften suffer great adversity in their encounter with the powerful opposition ofthose whose interests and beliefs are rigidly immured in the current status quo.image [images/9781594775093_027.jpg]Figure 3.1. Viktor Schauberger, Austrian Forester and Natural ScientistSchauberger’s life followed this same path, for in his life he too was met withderision, slander, and deceit in a long confrontation with the establishment inits various forms. More often than not his discoveries contradicted establishedtheory and in their flawless functioning and practical implementation seriouslythreatened the credibility and reputation of scientist and bureaucrat alike.Schauberger was a man of enormous strength of purpose, warm and encouraging,particularly to young people, in whom he took great interest, for he saw in themthe possibility of restoring a secure and bountiful future. But to those whoseview of life he considered irretrievably perverted, spiritually andintellectually, he was absolutely uncompromising, seeing them as obstacles inthe path of human evolution and the rehabilitation of the environment.There are many such individuals who have given themselves wholly to thebetterment of their fellow human beings. Without exception they were endowedwith extraordinary perceptive and intuitive abilities that afforded them freshinsights into the way the world functions, enabling them to understand phenomenahitherto inexplicable to their contemporaries. They were aware of anotherdimension of reality, one further dimension at least always being required tomake sense of the whole. Analogous to the third dimension that makes atwo-dimensional world understandable, this can be called the “dimension ofcomprehension.”Schauberger, some of whose penetrating insights into natural phenomena we willaddress here, was one of those rare human beings, those explorers in humanthought and endeavor whose chosen path was to throw light on the future. Inyears to come he will be acknowledged as one of the principal guiding spirits ofthe twenty-first century and beyond, who brought about a fundamental shift ofCopernican proportions in humankind’s appreciation of Nature and naturalenergies. Indeed, few have had Schauberger’s deep understanding of that livingsubstance so vital to all life processes—water, which he viewed as the blood ofMother Earth, for Schauberger saw the whole Earth as a living organism.Schauberger was born June 30, 1885, in the parish of Ulrichsberg, Upper Austria.He was descended from a long line of foresters who had devoted their lives tothe natural management and administration of the forest—a dedication mirrored intheir family motto: Fidus in silvis silentibus (“Faith in the silent forests”).With this as his background, and much against his father’s will, at the age ofeighteen he flatly refused to follow in the footsteps of his two elder brothersand attend university, having seen how university had affected his brothers’thinking. The main reason for his refusal was that he did not wish to have hisnatural way of thinking corrupted by people he considered totally alienated fromNature. He did not want to be forced to see things through jaundiced eyes, butthrough his own. As he later wrote, “The only possible outcome of the purelycategorizing compart-mentality, thrust upon us at school, is the loss of ourcreativity. People are losing their individuality, their ability to see thingsas they really are and thereby their connection with Nature. They are fastapproaching a state of equilibrium impossible in Nature, which must force theminto a total economic collapse, for no stable system of equilibrium exists.Therefore the principles upon which our actions are founded are invalid, becausethey operate within parameters that do not exist.”1[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt56]Endowed with an exceptional gift for accurate and intuitive observation,Schauberger was able to perceive the natural energies and other phenomenaoccurring in Nature, presently unrecognized by orthodox science. Leaving home,Schauberger spent a long period alone in the high, remote forest, contemplating,pondering, and observing the many subtle energetic processes taking place inNature’s laboratory, where still undisturbed by human hands. During this periodhe developed very profound and radical theories, later to be confirmedpractically, concerning water, the energies inherent in it, and its desirednatural form of motion. These eventually earned him the name Water Wizard.While Schauberger undoubtedly had a special talent for observation, apenetrating power of perception unsullied by preconceptions, he also developedwhat might be called an active consciousness, an ability to go beyond the merelyvisual in search of what lay behind a given phenomenon. This taught him a greatdeal, and how this ability gradually evolved he explained as follows:The Schaubergers’ principal preoccupation was directed towards the conservationof the forest and wild game, and even in earliest youth my fondest desire was tounderstand Nature and through such understanding to come closer to the truth; atruth that I was unable to discover either at school or in church.In this quest I was thus drawn time and time again up into the forest. I couldsit for hours on end and watch the water flowing by without ever becoming tiredor bored. At the time I was still unaware that in water the greatest secret layhidden. Nor did I know that water was the carrier of life or the ur-source*2[9781594775093_ftn.xhtml#ft2] of what we call consciousness. Without anypreconceptions, I simply let my gaze fall on the water as it flowed past. It wasonly years later that I came to realize that running water attracts ourconsciousnesses like a magnet and draws a small part of it along in its wake. Itis a force that can act so powerfully that one temporarily loses one’sconsciousness and involuntarily falls asleep.As time passed I began to play a game with water’s secret powers; I surrenderedmy so-called free consciousness and allowed the water to take possession of itfor a while. Little by little this game turned into a profoundly earnestendeavor, because I realized that one could detach one’s own consciousness fromthe body and attach it to that of the water.When my own consciousness was eventually returned to me, then the water’s mostdeeply concealed psyche often revealed the most extraordinary things to me. As aresult of this investigation a researcher was born, who could dispatch hisconsciousness on a voyage of discovery, as it were. In this way I was able toexperience things that had escaped other people’s notice, because they wereunaware that a human being is able to send forth his free conscious ness intothose places the eyes cannot see.By practicing this blind-folded vision, I eventually developed a bond withmysterious Nature, whose essential being I then slowly learnt to perceive andunderstand.2 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt57]These perceptions of truth presented Schauberger with considerable problems intranslating them into everyday language, for when it comes to transferringspiritual ideation into mundane word-pictures, enormous difficulties areencountered due to the limitations of language. In many instances, when he cameto describe these phenomena, he described them not in the conventionalterminology of physics, chemistry, or biology, but in his own words, for whichhe was greatly assisted by the structure of the German language, whichfacilitates the formation of new concepts through additive nouns. Despite this,and for lack of a suitable technical vocabulary, their interpretation andcomprehension is still sometimes extremely difficult, which in his writings hefreely admitted: “Few will understand the meaning of the above! Someindividuals, however, will obtain an indefinable inkling.”3[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt58] His oft-repeated dictum was “C2 —Comprehend andCopy Nature,” for only thus will humanity emerge from its presentcrisis-stricken condition.The vital development of a new technology, harmonious and conforming to Nature’slaws, demands a radical and fundamental change in our way of thinking and ourapproach to the interpretation of the established doctrines and facts ofphysics, chemistry, agriculture, forestry, and water management. As a pointer asto how such a new technology should come about, let me again quote Schauberger:“How else should it be done then?” was always the immediate question. The answeris simple: exactly in the opposite way that it is done today!However, before we can usefully address Schauberger’s theories, it is firstnecessary to discuss energy and movement for, contrary to the generally acceptedway of looking at things, in his view of life’s processes and their unfoldment,energy is primary and physical form is the secondary effect.WHAT IS ENERGY?What is the essential nature of energy? Where do we begin to search for theanswer to this age-old, deeply philosophical question? Surprisingly, despite allscientific investigation, nobody seems to have come up with a definitive answer!All we know are the ways in which energy manifests itself. We can see thatenergy is involved in flowing water and the formation and movement of clouds.But what is energy? What is its essence? What is this sublime process thatalways seems intimately connected with motion?There are many extremely high energies of which science is aware and canmeasure, but it cannot measure human energies such as thought, desire, love,enthusiasm, anger, and such, all of which are expressions of the human psycheand motivators to action. Many ancient cultures have known of other immateriallife energies, which they called, for example, chi, ka, prana, mana, archeus, orvis vitalis. As Schauberger often said, scientific thinking is an octave too lowand is unaware of what he called the fourth and fifth dimensions. As humanbeings we are immersed in a three-dimensional world, yet have an inkling of apossible fourth dimension we call time. What other dimensions may await ourdiscovery?The Creative Energy VortexIt is becoming more imperative that we understand how energy moves in order tocreate conditions in any future technology that faithfully emulate the naturalmovement of energy and Nature’s systems of motion, growth, and development. Inher systems involving dynamic energetic processes, she always appears to selecta spiral form of movement and its vortical derivatives, which are represented infigure 3.2 in both macrocosm, a galaxy, in this case overlaid by WalterSchauberger’s hyperbolic spiral, and microcosm, a DNA molecule.4[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt59]Since we still do not know what energy is, for the purposes of discussion,figure 3.3 represents a possible energy path. As energy moves along its desiredpath, it draws matter into its wake and forms the vessel through which it wantsto move. A river does exactly the same thing; the capillaries in our bodieslikewise. The blood is the external manifestation of an energy path. What we seeis the blood; we do not see the energy that moves it. The blood is all thatmatter that is too coarse to be taken to the energy’s final destination. Energytherefore creates the form of the path through which it wants to move and alongwhich it can move with the least resistance.image [images/9781594775093_028.jpg]Figure 3.2. In forming systems of dynamic energy, Nature always seems to selecta spiral form of movement, from the incredibly huge whirlpool of galaxies to theincredibly small spirals of DNA.image [images/9781594775093_029.jpg]Figure 3.3. The flow of energy determines its own path, and it draws matter toitself to form the vessel through which the energy flows.These unseen energies do not cease there, however, but serve to maintain theenergy of the organism in question, be it a tree, bacterium, or human being. Thephysically palpable aspect of these formative energies is what my mentor,Schauberger, termed “fecal matter.” By this he meant the deposition andsolidification of those energies too coarse to be carried farther down or up thevortical channel or pathway of the continuously vivifying and form-maintainingenergies. From a certain point of view, the human body could therefore be seenas a hollow energy path, a complex toroidal vortex for the transmutation ofmatter-energy into physical and intellectual activity.In Schauberger’s view the unseen vortical energies responsible for the growthand development of the tree, for example, stream upward far above the physicaltree itself and draw up its structure in their wake, the additional growthresulting from the accumulation and expulsion of further energetic detritus.The use of the word vortical in reference to the pathways of these formativeenergies relates to the fact that vortices have a cohering, energizing function.In their implosive outside-inward motion, they draw the various energeticfilaments together into closer harmonious association and thus maintain aconcentration in their concerted action to create the artifact in question.Depending on their frequency, there may be several such vortices emanating fromthe original vortical flow or life-stream, each being responsible for thecreation of a different aspect of the evolving form.In our physical world vortices and spirals are evident in both material andimmaterial form, and in their physical manifestation these energy vorticesdisplay the most exquisite mathematical perfection and symmetry, of whichseashells, flowers, and leaves are perhaps the most familiar examples. In termsof physical growth this motion can only be outward, as in the case of theseashells, for physical growth cannot occur in an inward direction, but onlyoutwardly. Immaterial growth, however, can take place in either direction, butin vortical systems, such as cyclones and those in water, the movement is fromthe outside inward, coupled with increasing density and velocity. While theimplosive vortex is the predominant one, Nature is never one-sided, andtherefore the opposite form exists and is implemented when required.Of their very nature these vortical systems are self-energizing, friction andimpedance reducing, self-organizing, spatially reducing, cooling, suctionincreasing, densifying and cohering, and silent. It is a form of motion thatSchauberger termed radial → axial (i.e., movement from the outside inward). Incontrast, all our current technical systems operate in the opposite direction(i.e., inside outward, or axially → radially). Such motion is coupled withincreasing pressure, friction, disintegration, and ultimately noise. Indeed itcould be said that the more noise a technical system makes, the more it isoperating against the laws of Nature. Such noise, however, has a debilitatingand disruptive, if not downright harmful, effect on all natural organisms forcedto endure it, including us.Continuing the above analogy of the vortical movement of energy, let us observejust how beautiful such a naturally structured vortex is (figure 3.4). Suchphenomena are not often observed. What a marvelous structure! It is nothandmade, but it is the path along which water likes to move.image [images/9781594775093_030.jpg]Figure 3.4. A photograph of the energy path of a naturally structured vortexNature’s workings could therefore be described not as “wheels within wheels” butas “whorls within whorls.” It is all the more extraordinary, therefore, thatdespite so much evidence of this vortical, cyclical, and helical movement, whichlies everywhere in Nature before our very eyes, science has never ascribed anyfundamental importance to it or tried to copy it. It has been too immersed inthe euclidean elements of mechanics with little knowledge or conception oforganics. We have never taken the time to understand it enough to be able toexploit it. It is high time we developed a technology whereby these processesare truly understood. This should be termed an ecotechnology rather than abiotechnology, the latter having been brought into disrepute through genemanipulation and experimentation. Perhaps “ec2otechnology” would be an evenbetter term as it embodies Schauberger’s concept of C2, signifying “Comprehendand Copy Nature.”The “Original” MotionIf one observes the universe as a whole, from big bang to black hole, as itwere, a form of motion is evident that Schauberger called“cycloid-spiralspace-curve motion.” He also referred to it as the “original”motion, not only in a primordial sense, but also as a “form-creating” dynamic.Shown in its quintessential, archetypal form in figure 3.5, which depicts thecreation of three successive universes, the cycloid-spiral-space-curve embodiesan initial out-breathing, centrifugal, curving expansion from a point, whichresults in the generation of countless individualities and energetic systems.Its culmination is an in-breathing, centripetal implosion whereby all that hasbeen created is concentrated once more into a point. The very word universesignifies a single curve (uni = one, versum = curve). The fact that theconfiguration of this curve may be a complex combination of descending andascending, involuting and convoluting, expanding and contracting spiralmovements does nothing to detract from its uniqueness or unit quality, sincefrom inception to culmination its path is continuous. It is an energy path, andthe essence of energy is ceaseless movement. In its eternal trajectory fromspirit to matter (outward breath) and from matter to spirit (inward breath), itpermeates all creation. It is all creation!image [images/9781594775093_031.jpg]Figure 3.5. Creative, formative motion according to Schauberger. The open,goal-oriented, structured, concentrated, intensifying, condensing, dynamic,self-organizing, self-divesting of the less valuable, rhythmical (cyclical),sinuous, pulsing, in-rolling centripetal (and out-rolling centrifugal) movementequals the cycloid-spiral-space-curve.Apart from its inherent pulsation, it would be impossible to break this eternalmovement down into discrete segments, for at the point where one portion of thissublime curve ceases, the next begins and cannot be defined mathematically,whatever the subjective view. Therefore this unique, primordial, creative curveembodies the unbroken path of evolution, of cyclical, pulsating out-foldment andin-foldment, as it spirals in and out of all the myriads of apparentlyinextricably interconnected and interdependent individual systems in the cosmos,tying and uniting all in one inscrutable Gordian knot.Even the tools of common language unwittingly allude to the character of thiscreative force and its dynamic spiral movement. When we “ex-spire,” we exit fromthis our “mortal coil.” When we are “in-spire-d,” we feel drawn to higherideals. Our “spir(e)it” is raised, and we are sucked into the upward spiral.Interestingly enough, the German word for the spinal column, the fundamentalsupporting structure of the human body, is Wirbelsäule, which translateddirectly into English means “spiral column.” Similarly each one of the vertebraeis referred to as a whirlpool or a vortex. Whereas we see it as a stiff, more orless rigid, physical structure, the Germans see it more as an energy path.Forms of MotionWhen we come to spiral-vortical motion itself—and Nature provides us withcountless examples—we can further subdivide it into another two forms. As shownin figure 3.6, axial → radial motion signifies an initial movement around acenter, which subsequently transfers to a radial movement toward the exterior;it is thus centrifugal, a movement from the inside outward.In Schauberger’s theories, also proven practically, with this form of movementthe resistance to motion increases by the square of the starting velocity. Inother words, if the radial distance from the center of rotation is 1 and theresistance is 1, when the radius is doubled (from 1 to 2), the resistance is (2squared = 4) quadrupled and the rotational period halved. If the radial distanceis 3, the resultant resistance is 32 (9) and the rotational velocity reduced toone-third, and so on. However, if the rotational velocity of such a centrifugalsystem is to be maintained at a constant level, then a continual, wasteful, andexpensive increase in the amount of input energy is required to overcome theresistance, and the whole system becomes less and less efficient. Not only this,but it creates discordant noise, and the more noise a device makes, the more itoperates against the laws of Nature.The dispersion of energy, therefore, is associated with noise or heat, as thecase may be. This is typical of our forms of technical movement, wherein thereis initially no motion at the center, but with increasing distance from thispoint, velocity and resistance also increase. The axial → radial centrifugalform of motion can thus be defined as divergent, decelerating, dissipating,structure loosening, disintegrating, destructive, and friction inducing. Whilethe destructive diffusion of energy results in noise, the creative concentrationof energy, however, is silent. Indeed, as Schauberger asserted on manyoccasions, “Everything that is natural is silent, simple and cheap.”5[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt60]Upon consideration, this statement is quite obvious. Think of all theconcentrated energy involved in the growth of the forest, for example, in allthe innumerable chemical and atomic interactions, which are none other thanenergetic processes, movements of creative energy. The silence of the forest isindicative of the extraordinary concentration of form-creating energy.Whereas our mechanical, technological systems of motion almost without exceptionare axial → radial and heat and friction inducing, Nature uses precisely theopposite form of movement. When Nature is moving dynamically, the slowestmovement occurs at the periphery and the fastest at the center. One only has toobserve the dynamics of a cyclone or a tornado. Her form of movement, therefore,is centripetal or radial → axial, moving from the outside inward with increasingvelocity, which acts to cool, to condense, and to structure.Radial → axial motion can therefore be defined as convergent, contracting,consolidating, creative, integrating, formative, and friction reducing. If thestarting radius is 1 and the initial resistance is 1 on an inwinding path, whenthe radius is halved, the resistance is (1/2)2 (= 1/4), and the rotationalperiodicity, frequency, or velocity is doubled. The dynamics of evolution musttherefore follow this centripetal, radial → axial path, for if the opposite werethe case, namely centrifugal, axial → radial motion, then all would have come toa stop almost before it started. With centrifugal acceleration, more power mustbe applied in order to accelerate or to maintain the same velocity. However, ifthe acceleration is centripetal, the velocity and energy increase automatically,producing a creative force, the upbuilding energies from which all life iscreated.As we are all becoming increasingly aware, our axial → radial technology and allits unnatural appurtenances, encompassing such effects as pollution, toxicwaste, monoculture, and artificial fertilization, to name a few, is reaching thepoint where it is threatening our very existence, creating a crisis of life anddeath.image [images/9781594775093_032.jpg]Figure 3.6. Schauberger’s concept of axial → radial motion denotes a movementfrom the center (the axis) outward toward the exterior of a vortex (the radius).Such movement is therefore centrifugal (i.e., from the inside outward).The Chinese word for crisis encompasses the two elements of “danger” and “opendoor.” Thus when danger confronts, a door opens to avoid it. This is where weare right now, and in preparation many alternate and Nature-friendlytechnologies are being quietly developed and can be implemented. Suchimplementation, however, will require a volte-face in humanity’s attitudes, notonly toward each other, but also in our interactions with Nature. Fundamental toany new and harmonious culture, however, is a reevaluation and a reverence forwater, whose natural movement embodies all the forms of motion described aboveand without which there would be no life at all. Thus it is to water that weshall now turn our attention.WATER—A LIVING SUBSTANCEWater! Where do we begin our quest in search of the true nature of thisremarkable substance, this wondrous, many-faceted jewel, which is both life andliquid? So primordial, primeval, and fundamental is the function of water thatit begs the question: Which came first, life or water? Thales of Miletus(640–546 BC) described water as the only true element from which all otherbodies are created, believing it to be the original substance of the cosmos. Itwas the only real substance because it was imbued with the quality of being.This view was firmly held by Schauberger, who also saw water as the “original”and “form-originating” substance created by the subtle energies called intobeing through the “original” motion of the Earth, itself the manifestation ofeven more sublime forces. Because it is the offspring or the “first born” ofthese energies, as he put it, he maintained and frequently asserted that wateris a living substance!Because he saw water as a living entity, Schauberger also saw it as theaccumulator and transformer of the energies originating from the Earth and thecosmos and, as such, as the foundation of all life processes and the majorcontributor to the conditions that make life possible. Not only that, he said,but once mature, water is a being invested with the power of extraordinarygiving and gives of itself to all things requiring life.The Upholder of the Cycles which supports the whole of Life, is water. In everydrop of water dwells a Deity, whom we all serve; there also dwells Life, theSoul of the “First” substance—water—whose boundaries and banks are thecapillaries that guide it and in which it circulates.VIKTOR SCHAUBERGER,OUR SENSELESS TOILWater is therefore a being that has life and death. With incorrect, ignoranthandling, however, it becomes diseased, imparting this condition to all otherorganisms, vegetable, animal, and human alike, causing their eventual physicaldecay and death, and in the case of human beings, their moral, mental, andspiritual deterioration as well. From this it can be seen just how vital it isthat water should be handled and stored in such a way as to avert suchpernicious repercussions. Rather than the nurturer and furtherer of all lifethat it should be, failure to perceive water as a living entity quicklytransforms it into a dangerous enemy, for when, in our ignorance of water’smanifold functions, we stop these cycles, we also stop life.As a liquid, water is described chemically as H2O and is a dipole moleculecomposed of two hydrogen atoms, each endowed with a positive charge, and oneoxygen atom possessing two negative charges. Water is no homogeneous substance,however, for it possesses other characteristics according to the medium or theorganism in which it resides and moves. As a molecule, water has anextraordinary capacity to combine with more elements and compounds than anyother molecule and in this regard could be described as the universal solvent.At a physical level water is to be found in three states of aggregation, solid(ice), liquid (water), and gas (water vapor), and in terms of its structure as aliquid it tends more to the crystalline, as it continually forms and reformsnodes of temporary crystallization.The Properties of WaterAnomaly PointThe anomalous expansion of water is also a factor of major importance. As aliquid, the behavior of water differs from all other fluids. While the latterbecome consistently and steadily denser with cooling, water alone, among allliquids, reaches its densest state at a temperature of +4° Celsius (39.2°Fahrenheit), below which it once more expands, eventually crystallizing as iceat 0°C. The temperature of +4°C is the so-called anomaly point or “point ofanomalous expansion,” which is decisive in terms of its potency and has a majorinfluence on its quality. At +4°C water attains its greatest density, its leastspatial volume, and is virtually incompressible (figure 3.7).If water’s temperature rises above +4°C, it expands. When it cools below thislevel it also begins to expand and becomes specifically lighter. This anomalousexpansion below +4°C is vital to the survival of fish life, for as water expandsand cools further it eventually crystallizes as ice at 0°C, providing afloating, insulating sheath that protects the aquatic life underneath from theharmful effects of severe external cold in winter.WATER—SOME IMPORTANT PHYSICAL FACTSWATER:a) Is specifically most dense at +4°C and at this temperature has its greatestenergetic content.b) Is chemically described as H2O with 2 positively charged hydrogen atoms and 1negatively charged oxygen atom.c) Has its lowest Specific Heat at +37.5°C, which has great significance forhuman beings with a normal temperature of +37°C in that it requires greateramounts of heat or cold to change the temperature of the blood, consisting of upto 90% water.d) Has a Dielectric Value of 81, which is 81 times greater than that of a vacuum(=1).e) 1mm3 of Pure Water (H2O) has an Electrical Resistance = to a 15,000,000 kmlong copper wire with a cross-section of 1mm2.f) Has as many varieties as there are humans, animals and plants.g) Is the BLOOD OF THE EARTH and performs the same functions in the Earth asdoes blood in animal life and sap in plants.h) There are two different TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS, which have a decisive effecton the action and energy of waterPOSITIVE Temperature Gradient (P.T.G.) = a motion of temperature toward +4°C.NEGATIVE Temperature Gradient (N.T.G.) = a motion of temperature away from +4°C.image [images/9781594775093_077.jpg]image [images/9781594775093_033.jpg]Figure 3.7. The physical attributes of waterAlso, +4°C is the temperature at which water has its highest energy content andis in what Schauberger called a state of “indifference.” In other words, when inits highest natural condition of health, vitality, and life-giving potential,water is at an internal state of energetic equilibrium and in a thermally andspatially neutral condition. Therefore if water’s health, energy, and life forceare to be maintained at the highest possible level, then certain precautionsmust be taken, for this anomalous condition is not only crucial to water’sdiverse functions, but also to Schauberger’s theories and their implementationwith regard to the temperature gradient to be elaborated later on.Dielectric ValueAnother important factor is water’s dielectric value. The base dielectric valuefor calculating all other values is based on the permittivity of a vacuum andhas a value of 1. Permittivity is the extent to which a substance can bepenetrated or traversed by an electric current or charge. The dielectric valueof pure water (distilled water) is 81 (= 92) and is therefore 81 times moreeffective as a charge separator than a vacuum and almost the highest dielectricvalue there is.Specific Heat and Thermal ConductivityA further life-giving property of water is its high specific heat and thermalconductivity, namely the ability and the rate at which it absorbs and releasesheat. According to H. L. Penman’s paper “The Water Cycle,” water has thegreatest specific heat known among liquids (= 1) and also has the greatestthermal conductivity of all liquids. “Its great specific heat means that, for agiven rate of energy input, the temperature of a given mass of water will risemore slowly than the temperature of any other material. Conversely, as energy isreleased its temperature will drop more slowly.”6 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt61]This means that a large input or extraction of heat energy is necessary to bringabout a change in density and temperature. The lowest point of the curve of thespecific heat values for water, however, lies at +37.5°C or 99.5°F (figure 3.7).How strange then, and how remarkable, that the lowest specific heat of this“inorganic” substance—water—lies but 0.5°C (0.9°F) above the normal +37°C(98.6°F) blood temperature of the most highly evolved of Nature’screatures—human beings—a temperature at which the greatest amount of heat orcold is required to change the water’s temperature. This property of water toresist rapid thermal change enables us, with blood composed of up to 90 percentwater, to survive in a relatively large range and fluctuation of temperaturesand still maintain our own internal bodily temperature. If the blood in ourbodies had a lower specific heat, they would heat up more rapidly and start todecompose, or quickly freeze if exposed to extreme cold.When our body temperature is +37°C (98.6°F) we do not have a “temperature” assuch. We are healthy and, recalling Schauberger’s view, are in an “indifferent”or “temperature-less” state. Just as good water is the preserver of our properbodily temperature, our anomaly point of greatest health and energy, so too doesit preserve this planet as a habitat for our continuing existence. Water in allits forms and qualities is thus the mediator of all life and deserving of thehighest focus of our esteem.Life is movement and is epitomized by water, which is in a constant state ofmotion and transformation, both externally and internally. Flowing as water,sap, and blood, this life molecule is the creator of the myriad life-forms onthis planet. How then could it ever be construed as lifeless in accordance withthe chemist’s clinical view of water, defined as the inorganic substance H2O?This cryptic appellation is a gross misrepresentation. Were water merely thesterile, distilled H2O as presently described by science, it would be poisonousto all living things. H2O or “juvenile water” is sterile, distilled water anddevoid of any so-called impurities. It has no developed character and qualities.As a young, immature, growing entity, it grasps like a baby at everything withinreach. It absorbs the characteristics and properties of whatever it comes intocontact with or has attracted to itself in order to grow to maturity. This“everything”—the “impurities”—takes the form of trace elements, minerals, salts,and even smells! Were we to drink pure H2O constantly, it would quickly leachout all our store of minerals and trace elements, debilitating and ultimatelykilling us. Like a growing child, juvenile water takes and does not give. Onlywhen mature—when suitably enriched with raw materials—is it in a position togive, to dispense itself freely and willingly, thus enabling the rest of life todevelop.Types of WaterBut what is this marvelous, colorless, tasteless, and odorless substance thatquenches our thirst like no other fluid? Did we but truly understand theessential nature of water—a living liquid—we would not treat it so churlishly,but would care for it as if our lives depended on it, which they clearly do.Apart from the actual treatment of water, which I’ll discuss later, certaintypes of water are more suitable for drinking than others, the following being ageneral classification to be read in conjunction with the table below.TABLE 3.1. QUALITIES OF DRINKING WATER WATER TYPE DESCRIPTION DRINKING QUALITYDistilled water Purest water—contains no other elements * Meteoric (rainwater)Contains some atmospheric gases—no minerals ** Juvenile (immature water)Contains few minerals or trace elements ** Surface water (dams, reservoirs,rivers) Contains some minerals and salts accumulated by contact with the soil *** Groundwater Contains a greater quantity of minerals, salts, etc. **** Truespring water High in dissolved carbons, carbonic acid, and minerals *****Artesian water Deep-lying water that may be fresh or saline and contains avariety of dissolved elements, suspensions, and gases VariableDistilled WaterThis is what is considered physically and chemically to be the purest form ofwater. Having no characteristics other than total purity, it has apre-programmed will to unite with or acquire, to extract or attract to itselfall the substances it needs to become mature water, and therefore absorbs andgrasps at everything within reach. Such water is really quite dangerous if drunkcontinuously long term. When distilled water is drunk it acts as a purgative,stripping the body of trace minerals and elements.Meteoric Water—rainwaterMeteoric water or rainwater, the purest naturally available water, noxiousatmospheric pollutants aside, is also unsuitable for drinking long term. It ismarginally better than distilled water and slightly richer in minerals, due tothe absorption of atmospheric gases and dust particles. As a living organism itis still in adolescence and needs to undergo certain ripening processes in orderto be able to be absorbed by the body and be beneficial to it.Juvenile WaterJuvenile water is immature water, but it is water coming from the ground. It hasnot matured properly on its passage through the ground. It emerges, perhaps inthe form of geysers, from quite a long way down. It has not yet resolved itselfinto a mature structure and is therefore still of poor quality. It contains afew minerals, some trace elements, and only small quantities of dissolvedcarbons, but again as drinking water it is not very high grade.Surface WaterSurface water, from dams, reservoirs, and the like, contains some minerals andsalts accumulated by contact with the soil and also from the atmosphere, butgenerally speaking it is not a very good quality water, partly because it hasalready been exposed to heavy oxygenation by being in contact with theatmosphere and has also been heated frequently by exposure to the sun, whichremoves a great deal of water’s character and energy.GroundwaterGroundwater is already much better, often expressing itself as a seepage spring.It is water emanating from lower levels that seeps to the surface after passagealong the top of an impervious stratum. It has a larger quota of dissolvedcarbons, which are the most important ingredient in high-quality water, apartfrom other trace salts.True SpringwaterTrue springwater—we shall explore the differences between a seepage spring and atrue spring later on—is very high in dissolved carbons and minerals and of thehighest possible quality. Its high state of health and vitality is affirmed byits shimmering, vibrant bluish color, which is not evident in inferior waters.Such water is ideal for drinking, if it can be obtained. Unfortunately there arenow very few true, high-quality springs left, due to the destruction of theenvironment.Artesian WatersApart from the above waters, there are artesian waters obtained from bores forwells, which are of unpredictable quality. At times they may be saline and atothers brackish or fresh. One can never be sure that well water will necessarilybe of drinking quality. Well water probably lies between groundwater and seepagespring water in terms of quality, but most probably can be likened to andclassified as groundwater. Once again it depends on how deep the well is andwhat stratum of water is tapped.But what are we actually given to drink? This subject of vital interest to usall, which so intimately affects our life, health, and well-being, will bediscussed later. Now we must turn our attention to the temperature gradient,which, after the anomaly point of +4°C, is the next most important factor inunderstanding water and its proper, naturalesque handling.OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE HEALTH OF WATERThe Temperature GradientApart from other factors (some cannot be defined quantitatively), encompassingsuch aspects as turbidity (opaqueness), impurity, and quality, the most crucialfactor affecting the health and energy of water is temperature, the variousaspects of which will be addressed in greater detail later. But first of all ageneral overview is in order.Conceived in the cool, dark cradle of the virgin forest, water ripens andmatures as it slowly mounts from the depths. On its upward way it gathers toitself trace elements and minerals. Only when it is ripe, and not before, willit emerge from the womb of the Earth as a spring. As a true spring, in contrastto a seepage spring, it has a water temperature of about +4°C (39.2°F). Here inthe cool, diffused light of the forest it begins its long, life-giving cycle asa sparkling, lively, translucent stream, bubbling, gurgling, whirling, andgyrating as it wends its way valley-ward. In its natural, self-cooling,spiraling, convoluting motion, water is able to maintain its vital innerenergies, health, and purity. In this way it acts as the conveyor of all thenecessary minerals, trace elements, and other subtle energies to the surroundingenvironment.Naturally flowing water seeks to flow in darkness or in the diffused light offorests and shaded streams, thus avoiding the damaging direct light of the sun.Under these conditions, even when cascading down in torrents, a stream will onlyrarely overflow its banks. Due to its correct natural motion, the faster itflows, the greater its carrying capacity and scouring ability and the more itdeepens its bed. This is due to the formation of in-winding, longitudinal, andboth clockwise and anti-clockwise alternating spiral vortices down the centralaxis of the current, which constantly cool and re-cool the water, maintaining itat a healthy temperature and leading to a faster, more laminar, spiral flow.image [images/9781594775093_034.jpg]Figure 3.8. The longitudinal vortex showing laminar flow about the central axis.The coldest water filaments are always closest to the central axis of flow.Thermal stratification occurs even with minimal differences in watertemperatures. The central core water is subjected to the least turbulence andaccelerates ahead, drawing the rest of the water-body in its wake.In the illustration above, the coldest water-filaments are always closest to thecentral axis of flow. Thermal stratification occurs even with minimaldifferences in water temperature. The central core water is subjected to theleast turbulence and accelerates ahead, drawing the rest of the water-body inits wake.To protect itself from the harmful effects of excess heat, water shields itselffrom the sun with overhanging vegetation, for with increasing heat and light itbegins to lose its vitality and health and its capacity to enliven and animatethe environment through which it passes. Ultimately becoming a broad river, thewater becomes more turbid, the content of suspended small-grain sediment andsilt increasing as it warms up, and its flow becoming slower and more sluggish.However, even this turbidity plays an important role, because it protects thedeeper water strata from the heating effect of the sun. Being in a denser state,the colder bottom strata retain the power to shift sediment of larger grain size(pebbles, gravel, etc.) from the center of the watercourse. In this way thedanger of flooding is reduced to a minimum. The spiral, vortical motionmentioned earlier, which eventually led Schauberger to the formation of histheories concerning implosion, creates the conditions where the germination ofharmful bacteria is inhibited and the water remains disease-free.In the form of the temperature gradient, the omission of temperature in allhydraulic calculation has resulted in the most devastating floods and theruination of almost all waterways. While flow velocity, shear force (sweepingforce), sediment load, turbidity, and viscosity, to name a few factors, aretaken into account in numerous formulae, the temperature gradient, whichsignificantly affects the function of all these different aspects, has so farbeen totally disregarded in the fields of river engineering, water supply, waterresources management, and the condition of water generally.Apart from variations in its content of organic matter, minerals, and salts—theso-called impurities—water has always been deemed a lifeless, inorganicsubstance. Therefore, except for certain defined water temperatures required forspecific purposes such as cooling and heating, the temperature or variations intemperature of any given water or body of water have hitherto been consideredtotally immaterial to the behavior of the water itself, since the measured rangeof these variations has generally been rated too small to be capable ofproducing any noteworthy effect.Schauberger defines the temperature gradient, of which there are two forms, asfollows:A positive temperature gradient exists when one of the following conditions ispresent: * The temperature of the water decreases and its density increases toward the anomaly point of +4°C. * The density and temperature increase from freezing and below toward +4°C. * Ground or water temperatures are cooler than air temperatures. * Ground temperatures are cooler than water temperatures.A negative temperature gradient exists when: * The movement of temperature is away from +4°C, either upward or downward, both of which signify a decrease in density and energy.In figure 3.7 the directions of movement of these two temperature conditions areshown as two curves delineating the variations of volume and density withtemperature. Here it can be seen how with cooling the volume decreases and thedensity increases, and vice versa with heating. A movement of temperature towardthe anomaly point of +4°C always involves a positive temperature gradient,whereas a movement in the opposite direction is indicative of a negativetemperature gradient.Both forms of temperature gradient are active simultaneously in nature, but forthere to be evolution instead of devolution, the positive temperature gradientmust predominate. On both upward and downward paths life emerges at theintersection of these two “temperaments,” as it were, each of which hasdifferent characteristics, properties, potentials, and opposite directions ofmovement or propagation.Whatever manifests itself as a result of the interaction of these mutuallyopposing essences depends on the relative proportions between them, which alsodetermines their point of intersection. For example, if the positive temperaturegradient is very powerful, then the effect of the reciprocally weaker negativetemperature gradient is beneficial and promotes the outbirth into physical formof the highest quality substances.Conversely, if the roles and ratios are reversed and the negative temperaturegradient is very dominant, then what unfolds as material substance is ofinferior worth. For evolution and growth to proceed with increasing quality,vitality, and health, which form is uppermost and at what level of reciprocitytheir interaction takes place is of absolutely crucial importance, for this notonly affects the movement of water, the movement of sap in plants, and the flowof blood in our veins, but also the configuration, structure, and quality of thechannels, ducts, and vessels surrounding and guiding them.As it flows, water acts completely differently according to whichevertemperature gradient is in force. In its concentrative, cooling, energizingfunction, the +4°C-approaching, positive temperature gradient has a formativeeffect. It is a process allowing living systems to be built up, since in waterit draws the ionized substances together into intimate and productive contact,for here the contained oxygen becomes passive and is easily bound by the coolcarbones,*3 [9781594775093_ftn.xhtml#ft3] thereby contributing beneficially tohealthy growth and development. The +4°C-deviating, negative temperaturegradient, on the other hand, has a disintegrative, debilitative function, forwith increasing warming the structure of a given body becomes more loosely knitwith a commensurate loss in cohering energy. In this case, due to the risingtemperatures, the oxygen becomes increasingly aggressive and reverses its roleas co-creator and benefactor, turning into a destroyer and fosterer of diseasesand pathogens.In all waters, forests, and other living organisms the temperature gradient isactive in both positive and negative forms. In the natural processes ofsynthesis and decomposition each has its special role to play in nature’s greatproduction, but each must enter on the stage of life at its appointed time. Thepositive temperature gradient, however, must play the principal role ifevolution is to unfold creatively.Temperature Gradients during FlowEver present, the temperature gradient is decisively active in the movement ofwater and the configuration of flow. Under natural conditions, when water flowsdown a gradient its flow is affected by a naturally occurring sequence ofpositive and negative temperature gradients, because in the course of flow thewater rhythmically heats up and cools down. How much it heats up, however, isdependent on the degree of friction with the riverbed, the external temperature,and the extent to which the water is directly exposed to the sun. It onlyrequires a very minute change in temperature for water to pick up, transport, ordeposit its sediment, and it is the type and duration of the temperaturegradient in force that determines which happens and for how long. A negativetemperature gradient causes the deposition of sediment, whereas a positivetemperature gradient ensures its removal. This pulsation or alternation can belikened to breathing, with a positive temperature gradient representing theinward breath, the absorbing, material-collecting movement, and the negativetemperature gradient representing the outward breath, where the energeticallytransformed matter is exhaled from the system and deposited.Apart from the general function of temperature gradients described above, inorder to explain the various aspects of temperature-related flow as clearly aspossible, each one will be dealt with individually, although by and large in anyriver or stream all of them are interactive in diverse combinations. Here it isimportant to understand that every particle of water is directly connected to aparticular velocity relative to its specific weight and temperature, aphenomenon described in great detail by Schauberger in his 1930–1931 treatise“Temperature and the Movement of Water.”7 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt62]To give some idea of what is here involved, a series of superimposed waterstrata with their respective temperatures is shown schematically in figure 3.9a,the coldest stratum flowing over the streambed. Here the velocity curve showsthe different distances traveled by the respective water strata in the sameperiod of time, as denoted by the length of the arrows. Relative to the upperstratum, the lowest stratum can be seen to flow far more rapidly due to itsgreater density and coolness.At the interface between these various strata, even though the temperaturedifferences may be minimal, there is nevertheless a difference in theirrelative, temperature-related velocities, the lower stratum sliding forwardslightly faster than its immediate upper neighbor. This slip creates a sort ofvacuity at the “end,” as it were, of the higher-lying stratum, into which thelower stratum rises. In the process vortices are formed at right angles to thecurrent, which rotate on a horizontal plane from the bottom upward, as shown infigure 3.9b. These mix the water but at the same time cool it, because the watertemperatures within the center of these vortices are identifiably cooler thanthose without, the uppermost vortex train manifesting itself as the familiarbackward-breaking ripples seen on rivers at the surface. This type of vortexalso distributes the lighter-weight sediment and the nutrient material carriedby the river from the center toward the sides, as shown in figure 3.9c.The movement of water can also be further categorized into laminar and turbulentflows, the simplest form of laminar flow being the one shown in figure 3.9a.Turbulence, however, can take the form of longitudinal or transverse vortices.As far as the latter are concerned there are two principal types: the firstoperates horizontally at right angles to the direction of flow as shown infigures 3.9b and 3.9c; the second, potentially the more harmful, also acts atright angles to the current, but on a vertical plane, and if too powerful, willgouge deep potholes or trenches in the riverbed, seriously dislocating thenatural flow. Temperature and the Movement of WaterEvery particle of water is connected to a particular velocity relative to itsspecific weight and specific temperature. When the critical velocity relative totemperature is exceeded, turbulence occurs, which is the NATURAL and AUTOMATICBRAKE in flowing water.image [images/9781594775093_035.jpg]Figure 3.9a. Laminar flow occurs when the internal variations in the watertemperature are at a minimum, thus reducing the differences between therespective flow-velocities; there is therefore no turbulence.image [images/9781594775093_036.jpg]Figure 3.9b. Turbulence in the form of horizontal vortex trains occurs whentemperature variations are more marked and the critical velocity of eachunderlying water stratum is exceeded. In the process of vortex formation, thewater is cooled, the flow becomes more laminar once more, and the flowaccelerates.image [images/9781594775093_037.jpg]Figure 3.9c. The horizontally acting, paired barrel-vortices transport sediment,suspended matter, and nutrients evenly over the whole channel bed. These aremost active at the location of fords.From this it becomes clear that in order to regulate a river naturally, andtherefore satisfactorily, it is very necessary to take the temperature gradientsand their alternating sequence into consideration. The variations in thetemperature of the water body as a whole and in its various parts are so subtle,lying perhaps within a range of 0.1°C to 2.0°C, that contemporary hydraulicengineering has so far never paid the slightest heed to them, the temperature ofthe water generally being deemed unimportant and immaterial in regard either tothe form or energy of the flow.In order to reduce the danger of flooding to a minimum it is therefore apparentthat the longer the reign of a positive temperature gradient can be preserved,the less likely a river is to flood, since only minor sediment deposition willoccur.The duration of the positive temperature gradient can be extended or it can berecreated where necessary (i.e., where excessive silt deposition occurs) throughthe replanting of trees. This is particularly important at the river bends,where the friction and therefore the warming tendencies are greatest. Species oftimber should be planted along the banks, which have a high evaporation rate. Inthe process of evaporation the sap in the tree is cooled, and because the rootsdevelop underneath the riverbed this cooling effect is also extended to theriverbed and thus to the water as well. Trees therefore act like a refrigeratorand help maintain the positive temperature gradient for a longer period.The key factors here in terms of land and water resources management are, first,never remove forests from the banks of a river; indeed a belt of trees of atleast five hundred to one thousand meters wide should be maintained along allriverbanks for the health of the river. Second, rivers flowing through cleared,barren countryside should be densely reforested on both banks in order to coolthe water. This will greatly assist in reestablishing healthy flow conditions,restoring the nutrient supply, and recharging the groundwater table through thereestablishment of a positive temperature gradient between the water and theground in its vicinity.The Formation of VorticesLongitudinal vortices, as the name suggests, are aligned parallel to the flowaxis of the channel. While these may constitute turbulence according to themeaning of the word, longitudinal vortices have an extremely beneficial functionand represent the structuring of those energies required to dislodge andtransport sediment, without which all channels will eventually silt up. At thesame time they are those vessels that create and enhance the immaterialenergies, soul, or psyche of a waterway.During flow healthy rivers have a natural sequence of clockwise-rotating(right-hand bends) and counterclockwise-rotating (left-hand bends) longitudinalvortices (figure 3.10). In this way the suspended and dissolved carbons, whichgenerally congregate along the banks and bed, are lifted toward the dissolvedoxygen, which, in all healthy streams, normally resides in the central flowaxis. These fructigenic*4 [9781594775093_ftn.xhtml#ft4] carbons react tocentripetence. In other words they become very active if moved centripetally,and in this condition are able to bind the fertilizing oxygen, which becomespassive with the cooling centripetence of the central vortical flow, but highlyactive with warming centrifugence. If the right proportion between centripetenceand centrifugence in the vital longitudinal vortices exists, the most productiveinteraction between the two opposing substances is also assured. Here theyinteract not only to increase the energies in the water, but also to augment itscarbonic acid content, which is one of the principal constituents of good water.Moreover they create conditions conducive to the propagation of bacteria andmicroorganisms beneficial to the environment through which the water passes. Asthe reflection of a primary energy path, the serpentine, meandering pattern ofbends in a river is a manifestation of the physical secondary effect. Apart fromlarge, immovable obstacles such as mountains and cliff faces, for example, thecourse of a river or stream always follows the path in which the energies in agiven situation like to move. In some instances it is difficult to say whetherthe topographical features of a landscape produced the form of the river orwhether the river gave rise to the landscape through which it flows (e.g., theGrand Canyon), so intimately connected are the two. Rivers are therefore themirrors of an unseen flow of energy.Although there are not many left, a naturally flowing river, undisturbed bymodern river engineering, only rarely if ever overflows its banks. In theircool, faster flow down the flow axis, longitudinal vortices clear the channelbed of sediment as well as deepen it, varying this capacity to suit the volumeof the discharge. These vortices are also thermally stratified in a laminarfashion. As an example, in figure 3.10 the central core water of such a vortexhas a temperature of +5.01°C, very dense and cold, and it moves faster than themore outlying water strata, which become progressively less dense as they warmtoward the outside.According to the Archimedean principle of the denser carrying the lighter, herethe densest core water carries the specifically lighter water, because in thisinwinding, centripetal, vortical movement the densest water has to flow down thevery center.Apart from cooling the river water, the other principal function of bothtransverse and longitudinal vortices in naturally flowing rivers and streams,through the generation of backward-breaking ripples (figure 3.9b), is to applythe automatic brake to the descending water. Without this naturally appliedbrake, the heavy masses of water would overaccelerate, rupture the riverbanks,and cause immense havoc. It is this aspect that forms the nub of Schauberger’sinitial treatise, “Turbulence,”8 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt63] deposited underseal by Professor Exner at the Austrian Academy of Science in 1930.image [images/9781594775093_038.jpg]Figure 3.10. In the natural flow of rivers, the sequence of longitudinalvortices will alternate between clockwise and counterclockwise rotations,creating a riverbed with alternating right-hand and left-hand turns,respectively.The location of this current crossover is where the river is shallowest andwhere it can most easily be forded. This point is the focus or target of whatSchauberger called the “energy-cannon” (figure 3.10). It is where the upbuildingimmaterial energies of the river are released into the environment, which, as aform of energy, are akin to the life-endowing, animalistic orgone energies ofWilhelm Reich. They are freed at this location, because all the energiesaccumulated in the previous inwinding, counterclockwise, longitudinal vortexhave to be released before the movement turns clockwise or vice versa. In otherwords the point has been reached where the energy concentration of the vortexculminates in a process akin to breathing. One cannot continually breathe in,and therefore the moment is reached where inhalation has to give way toexhalation, each of which is coupled with a different energy form and both ofwhich are necessary for life to continue.Since the flow velocity tends to decelerate here, fords are also the majordeposition zones for the river’s suspended nutrients and minerals and where theriver can transfer these to the environment. The bends on the other hand arewhere the rocks and stones are ground up and their pulverized substancestransported in the vortical flow for later deposition. These pebbles, boulders,and sediment, however, are not to be considered merely as inert matter, for inSchauberger’s view they constitute the river’s bread, its source of nourishmenton its journey to the sea.As stones are ground together, which can only occur if the water is cold, dense,and dynamic enough, small particles of the minerals they contain are releasedinto the water and partially or wholly dissolved, replacing those previouslylost through transfer to the surroundings. Not only are these trace elements andminerals released, but pure ionizing energy is released as well through thegeneration of the triboluminescence.*5 [9781594775093_ftn.xhtml#ft5]It is the energetic effects associated with triboluminescence that endow theflowing water with new and immaterial energies, enhancing its character andquality. This is yet another of the many ways in which a river constantlygenerates and regenerates its energies and vitality, while at the same timeimparting them and the necessary nutrients to the environment. If thetemperature gradient at the ford is positively related to the groundtemperatures, then these vital nutrients will be absorbed into the ground andthe groundwater table thereby recharged and enriched.A further point of interest in this regard is the origin of the fabled “gold ofthe Nibelungs,” the “Rhinegold” that supposedly lay on the bottom of the Rhinein days of yore and that gleamed during the hours of darkness. This legend isalso to be ascribed to the phenomenon of triboluminescence. About 200 to 250years ago no doubt the water of the Rhine was pure, clear, and translucentenough for people to observe what appeared to be the flashing of gold on theriverbed. Today, however, along with many other rivers, the Rhine is a thick,turbid, grey-green, muddy brew, its life force having been extinguished bymodern mechanistic methods of river engineering, so the “gold” can no longer beseen.DRINKING WATER SUPPLYThe Consequences of ChlorinationWater is the issue most crucial to all life on Earth. Water is the lifeblood ofour planet, the life-giving fluid in all organisms, plants, animals, and humanbeings alike, flowing as sap, lymph, or blood. Our very existence is thereforeintimately connected with the quality of water available to us. It is vital forour own lives and those of our children that we become seriously concerned notonly for the health, vitality, and quality of the water we drink, but also forthe source from whence it originates and the treatment it receives, for apartfrom our own consumption of it, this same water is also used to grow everythingwe eat. If we want to live in health and happiness, then the livingentity—water—should be highly revered and the greatest sensitive care should begiven to it.Today the drinking water supplied to almost all inhabitants of so-calledcivilized countries is chlorinated and sometimes even fluoridated. The purposeof this treatment is to sterilize the water, to free it of all noxiousmicroorganisms and pathogenic bacteria. Present methods of water treatment andreticulation kill water, however, and bad water or wrongly treated waterdebilitates, degrades, degenerates, and ultimately destroys those organismsconstantly forced to drink it. Science, however, completely overlooks the factthat water—as life carrier—is itself alive and needs to be kept in thiscondition if it is to fulfill its naturally ordained function, for asSchauberger has stated, “Science views the blood-building andcharacter-influencing UR-ORGANISM—‘WATER’ merely as a chemical compound andprovides millions of people with a liquid prepared from this point of view,which is everything but healthy water.”9 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt64]But what does modern, denaturized civilization care, as long as it receives asuitably hygienized, clear liquid to shower with and use to wash its dishes,clothes, and cars? Once down the drain in company with all manner of toxicchemicals and detergents, all is comfortingly out of sight and out of mind. Asproof of the efficacy of current disinfective practices, and in justification oftheir continuance, officialdom usually points out that such water-borne diseasesas cholera and typhoid are virtually unknown in all countries where the water ischlorinated.Thus reassured, the broad mass of the population blithely continues to bask inthe luxury of apparently disease-free water in complete ignorance of theperilous repercussions arising from its constant consumption, for what is neverstated in official explanations is the cumulative effect this treatment of waterhas on the organisms forced to drink it. What people do not know is thatalthough the chlorination of drinking and household water supplies ostensiblydisinfects them and removes the threat of waterborne diseases, it does so to thedetriment of the consumer.In its function of water sterilizer or disinfectant, chlorine eradicates alltypes of bacteria, beneficial and harmful alike, so that what arrives at the tapor faucet, while indeed free of every possible organism, is water that has beensterilized to death—in other words, a water corpse. More importantly and morealarmingly, however, it also disinfects the blood (up to 90 percent water) andin doing so kills off or seriously weakens many of the immunity-enhancingmicroorganisms resident in the body of those organisms forced to consume it.This eventually impairs their immune systems to such a degree that they are nolonger able to eject viruses, germs, and cancer cells, to which the respectivehost bodies ultimately fall victim. We therefore actually sterilize our bloodwhen we drink chlorinated water, readying ourselves for the onset of disease. Oflate there has been an alarming increase not only in hitherto unknown diseases,but in all forms of sickness, cancer in particular.In view of the fact that our body’s water content amounts to 45 liters and thatour daily consumption of water in one form or another is about 2.4 liters, justconsider table 3.2.TABLE 3.2. THE WATER CONTENT OF THE HUMAN BODY10 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt65]The blood plasma (main blood component) about 92% water The human fetus (ourgrowing physical vehicle) about 90% water The blood (life fluid and nutrientconveyor) up to 90% water The human brain cells (intellect, creativity,behavior) 85% water The kidneys (fluid processors and purifiers) 82% water Themuscles (prime movers of the body) average 75% water The body (our abode onEarth) 71% water The liver (metabolism regulator) 69% water The bones(structural support system) 22% water The body’s cell fluids (basis of growthand development) mainly waterJust imagine what effect the constant drinking of dead or diseased water has onall of these! What happens to the life force essential for healthy growth?And what are the effects of chlorination? Chlorine is not added to drinkingwater in vast quantities. On average, it is administered at about 10 parts permillion, provided always that the dispensing and metering equipment is properlymaintained and monitored. Malfunction, however, can never be ruled out, with theresult that over-chlorination may occur more frequently than we are led tobelieve.In the process chlorine replaces hydrogen, one of the key elements of the watermolecule and present in all carbohydrates and fats, both of which are essentialto metabolism in all organic life. One effect of this hydrogen replacement maywell be the removal of the hydrogen atoms in the fatty substances surroundingand enclosing the cells, the cell walls, which act as a dielectric membrane andconserve and separate the bioelectric charges responsible for the cells’ correctfunction.On the other hand, it (chlorine) may also create certain quantities ofhydrochloric acid in the blood itself, which as a digestive juice normallyresides safely confined within the walls of the stomach, and as a result may addto the overall acidity of the blood, thereby reducing the blood pH*6[9781594775093_ftn.xhtml#ft6] to levels below the normal, healthy level of 7. Asa powerful oxidant it also accelerates the metabolic processes of oxidation, onthe one hand creating additional heat and on the other consuming oxygen destinedfor other purposes, and if these occur above the naturally prescribed levels, inmost organisms it leads to premature aging.What more needs to be said, apart from the fact that all these abnormaloxidizing processes cause the dislocation of the natural energy flows in thebody, which in turn raises its general temperature, thus placing it in adisease-prone condition—disease after all being the way Nature removes allorganisms that are no longer healthy or viable in her scheme of things and thatstand in the path of evolutionary progress. In confirmation of chlorine’sdisease-causing function, a recent study found that in water purification it“produces by-products that cause 18 percent of rectal cancers and 9 percent ofbladder cancers.”11 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt66]But this is not where it all ends. Ultimately all these malpractices not onlyhave the direst consequences for the body, but also for its more immaterialattributes, and here we shall quote Schauberger once more: “A particular innertemperature produces a certain physical form which in turn generates the specialkind of immaterial energy we encounter in a more or less highly developed formas character. Hence the old saying ‘Mens sana in corpore sano’ (a healthy mindin a healthy body). If the composition of the basic substances of the bodyshould in any way be altered, then the metabolic basis for the further growth ofthe body must not only change, but its spiritual and intellectual growth andfurther development as well.”12 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt67]Schauberger saw the proper physical formation of the brain as being crucial towhat it produces in the way of concepts, ideas, and behavior, ethical andotherwise. The lower the quality of the physical structure, the more inferiorthe morals and ethics. In the same way that narrowly spaced annual rings oftrees produced high-quality, resonant timber, he saw the production of goodthoughts in harmony with nature and, in consequence, good character traits aspossible only with a well and healthily grown and developed brain withclose-knit windings.Unwholesome food, poor water, and the resultant slight overheating, in his view,gave rise to the formation of coarse convolutions in the brain’s overallstructure, creating a brain that was incapable of either functioning intuitivelyor of comprehending the subtleties of nature’s processes. It degenerated into anorgan able only to think logically, but never “biologically,” never with aliving logic aware of natural energetic interrelations and interdependencies.Such a brain could be likened to a poorly designed musical instrumentconstructed of inferior materials and thus unable to create truly harmonioussounds affecting the world harmoniously. There is plenty of evidence in supportof this, for daily we are made aware of the rise in mental afflictions,depression, dyslexia, irrational and brutal behavior, and hyperactivity, to namea few conditions that are affecting more and more people at an increasinglyyounger age.It is high time a thorough investigation and highly publicized public inquiryinto present methods of water purification be undertaken immediately by anindependent body of competent, unsubornable individuals. These should beselected from all branches of science and medicine, including so-calledalternative practitioners, whose expertise in some areas far exceeds those oforthodox disciplines. Should its publicized findings recommend the immediatecessation of current practices in water purification, then neither thegovernment nor the respective authorities should be able to continue to hoodwinkthe population, and they should be forced by the ballot box to take action andundertake the necessary and urgent remedial measures to give us healthy,life-giving water.The Storage of WaterWhether our water is commercially processed or we obtain it from naturalsources, we must care for the very limited stocks of water still available. Thismeans we must treat it in the way demonstrated to us by nature. First andforemost, water should be protected from sunlight and kept in the dark, farremoved from all sources of heat, light, and atmospheric influences. Ideally itshould be placed in opaque, porous containers, which on the one hand cut out alldirect light and heat, and on the other allow the water to breathe, which incommon with all other living things, it must do in order to stay alive andhealthy.The present system of bottling water in clear, transparent bottles, for example,detracts from the water’s quality because it is exposed to light and heat. Whena glass of good water is left out in the sun, little bubbles form on the glassas the carbonic acid, the principal ingredient of good water, is converted intocarbon dioxide through increased temperature and light. Like wine, water needsto be kept in the dark in an opaque bottle sealed with a breathing cork, and itis not without reason that good wine is matured in wooden casks.In terms of what we can achieve personally, we should at all times ensure thatour storage vessels, bottles, and tanks are thoroughly insulated so thecontained water is maintained at the coolest temperature possible underprevailing conditions. The materials most suited to this are natural stone,timber (wooden barrels), and terra-cotta. Perhaps more than any other material,terra-cotta has been used for this purpose for millennia. Terra-cotta exhibits aporosity particularly well suited to purposes of water storage. This is becauseit enables a very small percentage of the contained water to evaporate via thevessel walls.Evaporation is always associated with cooling (vaporization, releasing heat),and according to Walter Schauberger, if the porosity of the container iscorrect, for every 600th part of the contents evaporated, the contents will becooled by 1°C (1.8°F). Therefore, if such a vessel is positioned where there isa reasonable movement of air, the water will cool and approach its anomalypoint, its state of highest health and “indifference” at a temperature of +4°C(39.2°F).Another important factor is the actual shape of the container itself. Moststorage containers in use today take the form of cubes, rectangular volumes, orcylinders. While these are the shapes most easily and economically produced bytoday’s technology, they have certain drawbacks in terms of impeding naturalwater circulation and promoting water suffocation.Due to their rectangular shapes and/or right-angled corners, stagnant zones arecreated that provide a suitable environment for the propagation of pathogenicbacteria. And since the materials used are generally galvanized iron,fiberglass, concrete, or steel—all impervious materials—the contained water isunable to breathe adequately and suffocates as a result. In this debilitatedstate it becomes a water cadaver, quickly becomes diseased, and requires furtherdisinfection.Taking Schauberger’s maxim “Comprehend and Copy Nature” as our guide, we shouldtherefore make use of the shapes Nature herself selects to contain, guard, andmaintain life, in other words, eggs and their derivations. Should we now make astudy of those shapes nature chooses to propagate and maintain life, it soonbecomes apparent that the cubes and cylinders have no place in nature’s schemeof things. For the safe storage of her vital fluids and materials nature choseeggs and elongated egg shapes such grains and seeds, because she in her wisdomhad determined that these produce the optimal results.Compared with cubes and cylinders, as shown in figure 3.11, these shapes have nostagnant zones, no right-angled corners that inhibit flowing movement. Byplacing egg-shaped terra-cotta vessels in shaded areas, exposed to air movement,the evaporative cooling effect will be significantly enhanced. Since all naturalmovement of liquids and gases is triggered by differences in temperature, so tooinside the egg-shaped storage vessel, cyclical, spiral, vitalizing movement ofthe water will be induced. Movement is an expression of energy, and energy issynonymous with life. The external evaporation causes cooling of the outer wallsand the water in their immediate vicinity. Being cooler and therefore denser,water becomes specifically heavier and sinks down along the walls toward thebottom, at the same time forcing the water there to rise up the center and movetoward the outside walls. Continual repetition of this process results in theconstant circulation and cooling of the contents. As Lord Thurlow said, “Natureis always wise in every part.”image [images/9781594775093_039.jpg]Figure 3.11. To hold all-important water, Nature chooses egg-shaped or moreelongated seed-shaped containers, which do not have corners that form stagnantzones in which pathogenic bacteria can propagate.CONCLUSIONSIn light of these facts the task we presently face is monumental and fartranscends short-term economics, politics, and national self-interest. As afirst priority, a program of re-education about water and its essential natureshould be inaugurated globally, because the future of water is synonymous withour own. This task requires a committed cooperation from all concerned if thereis to be any chance of real success. Here there is no room for competitivebehavior or strategies for privatization and profit, for water is a substancenature has made freely available to all and it is our natural birthright. It isimperative that it be made clearly and irrefutably obvious to government thatall present economic policies, driven by finance and policies based on economicexpediency for short-term gain, will become purely academic and thereforewithout value or relevance unless the future of the two cornerstones of life onthis planet is first assured. Without clean, healthy water and an abundance ofthriving vegetation, no economy of any kind is sustainable. These are, and haveever been, the fundamental bases of existence and evolutionary development.Without them all unnatural economies are doomed and so too the countries andpeoples that espouse them. Life as we know it will be extinguished. It’s assimple as that!A long-term view is now the imperative of the hour, which means takingappropriate steps now to ensure success and stability in the mid-and long-termfuture. For this, as Schauberger sought to teach us, a new and far profounderknowledge of nature is necessary, so that whatever is implemented by way ofremedial measures will be in harmonious accordance with nature’s laws. As neverbefore, we now stand at a watershed and must all act together in consort, for weare, each one of us, inextricably interconnected with the whole, as soeloquently depicted by the great German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in thefollowing poem:All things into one are woven, each in each doth act and dwell,As cosmic forces, rising, falling, charging up this golden bell,With heaven-scented undulations, piercing Earth from power Sublime.Harmonious all and all resounding, fill they universe and time!Amidst life’s tides in raging motion, I ebb and flood—waft to and fro!Birth and grave, eternal ocean, ever-moving, transient flow.Such changing, vibrant animation, the very stuff of life is mine,Thus at the loom of time I sit and weave this living cloth divine.NEW ENERGY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF MAVERICK SCIENTISTSWe are entering a scientific age, but it will be a science which passes out ofthe impasse which it has now reached and which—having penetrated as it has intothe realm of the intangible—will begin to work far more subjectively thanheretofore. It will recognize the existence of senses which are super-sensoryand which are extensions of the five physical senses, and this will be forcedupon science because of the multitude of reliable people who will possess themand who can work and live in the worlds of the tangible and the intangiblesimultaneously. The mass of reputable testimony will prove incontrovertible. Themoment that the subjective world of causes is proven to exist (and this willcome through the indisputable evidence of man’s extended senses) science willenter into a new area; its focus of attention will change; the possibilities ofdiscovery will be immense and materialism (as that word is now understood) willvanish. Even the word “materialism” will become obsolete and men in the futurewill be amused at the limited vision of our modern world and wonder why wethought and felt as we did.DJWHAL KHULHow often in the past one hundred years has publicly funded institutionalscientific research resulted in major scientific and technical innovations? Andhow often have such discoveries come from the derided and ostracized loner inhis “skunk works”? Even a superficial review shows a massive trend in favor ofthe latter.Bell and the telephone; Parsons, Tesla, and the turbine; Edison and the electriclight and recorded sound; Marconi, Tesla, and radio; the Wright Brothers andflight; Carl Benz and the automobile; the Lumière brothers and cinema; OttoMergenthaler and the Linotype machine; Armon Strowger and the automatictelephone exchange; George Eastman and celluloid photographic film; Fritz Haber,the historian who taught himself chemistry and fixed atmospheric nitrogen;Wegener and continental drift; Pollen and automatic fire control; Baird andtelevision; Whittle and the jet engine; Chester Carlson and Xerography; Eckertand Mauchly and the commercial computer; Edwin Land and Polaroid photography;Christopher Cockerell and the hovercraft. Even where the innovator belongs to arecognized institution he or she is often a loner who achieves success byswimming against the currents of orthodoxy, like Alan Turning and the firstBritish computers, or even Watson and Crick, who had been told to drop theirstudy of DNA but continued it as “ bootleg” research.Of course, one can also compile a long and distinguished list of discoveries ininstitutional science, especially from the great universities like Oxford andCambridge and especially in important basic fields such as atomic physics andastronomy. But, somehow, it is difficult to draw up a list that carries quitethe same diversity, the same romantic air of excitement and innovation and onethat has so obviously influenced every single aspect of twentieth-century lifeso fundamentally. Anyone who switches on the electric light, turns on thetelevision, makes a phone call, watches a film, plays a record, takes aphotography, uses a personal computer, drives a car or travels by airplane hasthe lone eccentric to thank, not institutional science.RICHARD MILTON,ALTERNATIVE SCIENCE"},{"pageContent":"4ROYAL RAYMOND RIFETHE FATE OF COMPASSION AND THE CANCER CURE THAT WORKEDGerry VassilatosNOTE: This essay is an excerpt from the book Lost Science by Gerry Vassilatosand is reprinted by permission of Borderland Science Research Foundation(www.borderlands.com [http://www.borderlands.com]).The ages cannot kill a truth, and the first man who phrased it will find hisecho right down through the centuries.PAUL BRUNTONIn the 1930s and 1940s, Royal Raymond Rife revolutionized everything that hasbeen done before or since in high-resolution optical microscopy. . . . Heproduced direct, economical, electromagnetic cures of cancer, leukemia, andother such debilitating diseases. His work presages a future mankind could havehad, where most debilitating diseases were quickly and economically corrected,and where no poisonous drugs, violent nuclear irradiation, and harshchemotherapeutic “ burning” of the patient would be necessary. For such epochalwork, he was ostracized, essentially imprisoned in a medical treatment facility,broken, condemned, and rejected by his peers. His findings, though printed inreputable publications and journals, were discredited and ridiculed.THOMAS E. BEARDENLIGHTThere is a constant war being waged that most prefer to ignore. Living out ourdays in the joyous sunshine, we rarely choose to glimpse full-faced into thehorrid visage of disease as physicians so often do. Perhaps it is pain, perhapsfear. Despite our willful ignorance, hideous armadas of pathogens march throughall nations unhindered. These insidious enemies wage their continual war againstthe human condition, with a cruel and merciless deliberation.Pride and wealth cannot keep these legions away. They are deadly, having noconscience or allegiance. They are the universal enemy of humankind, arelentless foe. It is a wonder that nations have not surrendered their pettypersonal feuds long enough to recognize the common specter. Joining our bestforces to defeat this dread army long ago would have secured major victories forall of humanity.It has therefore fallen to the sensitive and impassioned few, armed with visionand swords of light. The independent medical crusaders enter the battle alone.Their names are seldom seen in major journals any longer. Their private researchforever dangles on gossamer threads of grants and endless bureaucraticlabyrinths. Yet these are the ones, the men and women who make the discoveriesfrom which cures are woven. Real cures.image [images/9781594775093_040.jpg]Figure 4.1. Royal Raymond Rife with one of his microscopesThey often live on shamefully minuscule budgets, preferring to pour theirpersonal funds into their work. They are the seekers. They are always close onthe brink of a possible new development. The important thing is that they areprepared, and they wait for the gracious and providential revelations on whichhumanity depends. Theirs is the excitement of the chase. Their quest is for “thebreakthrough.” They are the ones who fill little lab rooms, closet spaces thatline university hallways. Their intuitive vision has guided them into researchalleys that are too small for the big concerns of profiteering medical agendas.If these researchers are fortunate, they find an impassioned patron. Perhaps thepatron is a sensitive one, whose life has been touched by the sting of tragedy.Perhaps a loved one was lost. Perhaps also in the heat of that pain, therecognition came that gold must be transmuted by passion and devotion before itcan cure. These quiet ones who go about their work daily; they have devotedhearts and are driven on behalf of all who bear sorrow over what has been lost.There was one such man. His discovery gave eyes to the blind. He perfected ameans by which humanity’s enemies could be detected. His microscope couldoptically sight viruses, and sight them in their active state. And he developeda means by which a virus, any virus, could be eradicated with the flick of aswitch. His medical developments won him no reward or recompense because hisresearch did not fit the desired agenda.THE UNIVERSAL MICROSCOPEThere were predecessors to the prismatic marvel—the super microscope—of Dr. R.Raymond Rife, but no equals. Others had designed and used oil immersion lenses,dark-field illuminations, and deep ultraviolet light, each holding part of thesecret for optically magnifying infinitesimal objects. But the design that Rifedeveloped outpaced all of these.And yet it is doubtful whether you have ever heard Rife’s name. Reasons formass-forgetfulness run deep. Truths have been kept from you. Only a careful andrelentless study of the past will relinquish secrets purposefully and cunninglyburied. The information is safely nestled in dust-laden libraries that fewnowadays venture to peer into. Perhaps you will recognize why his name has beenblotted out of the historical records before we reach the end of this amazingbiography.Rife began as a research pathologist. A medical crusader of the very highestqualifications, his was a heart filled with but one goal: the eradication ofdisease. Rife recognized first and foremost that successful medicine relies onvision, on light. What we cannot see we cannot battle. An unseen foe isimpossible to destroy. Therefore his first quest was to secure a vastly improvedsystem of microscopy. Once he could see, once all could see, then the pursuit ofmedical knowledge could again move forward. An armada of equipped seers couldassail the foe on every shore.Rife’s study of microscopy detailed every component and premise that traditionhad presented to the twentieth century. The creation of a super microscope wouldrun counter to every physical law and restriction of the previous two centuries.Rife wanted to develop super microscopes capable of seeing viruses. His aim wasto chart and catalog them, understanding that they represented a deadly foe thatexceeded bacilli in their destructive assault on humanity. His quest now began.He reduced the fundamental premises by which microscope design had developed,analyzing each separate component and premise.FOCUSOptical designers had been adding ever more complex components to the designthat began with Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. Lenses were compounded to lenses,crowns were added to compounds, crowns were added to crowns—the complexity wasfrightful. Simplifying the problem necessarily led Rife back to the study ofoptical geometry and the comprehension of simple ray divergence.Rife thought on these ancient principles. An ideal magnifying system is ageometric construction of extreme simplicity. Diverging light rays can magnifyany object to any magnification. Given a strongly divergent light source and agreat enough distance, one can theoretically magnify the indivisible! This isthe principle that underlies projection microscopy. Rife realized that theprojection microscope represented the best and simplest means of magnifyinginfinitesimal objects. One simply needed to discover a means by which avanishingly small, brilliant radiant point could project divergent rays to thesurface of any material speck. No virus, however indistinct and cunning, couldhide from such an optical magnifier.The theoretical design of a microscope relies purely on geometric principles.Actual materialization of these principles requires material manipulations,since geometric rays and light rays are significantly distinct. What is amicroscope essentially? What is achieved in a microscope with light rays? Thenotion is quite simple. Take divergent rays from a vanishingly small point ofbrilliant emanations and allow them to pass through any spectrum, which is to beviewed. Light from this encounter is then made to diverge as far apart aspossible in a given space. Geometrically it is possible to divert rays from avanishingly small point out to an infinite distance.This geometric construction produces unlimited (ideal) magnifications.Provisions toward this ideal goal require that the point radiant source be tinyand brilliant enough, the specimen be close enough to the radiant point, and theimage diverging space be very long. The geometric divergence of the point lightsource is the magnification factor. But geometry is an idealized reality. Andideal geometry encounters significant frustrations when implementing light ininertial space.The most basic type of microscope is the projection microscope. It is thesimplest system employed to greatly magnify the most infinitesimal objects. Inthe more common version, light is made to pass through a tiny specimen. Lightfrom the specimen is forced to diverge across a long space by means of a verysmall focusing lens. Rays from this lens cross, diverging and expanding across along space. This widely divergent beam is then projected onto frosted glass. Theviewing of images derived through these means is indirect, but provides superiormagnifications with ultrahigh resolutions.Previously, laboratories required compact units capable of close personalmanipulations. The development of fine optical microscopes became frightfullycomplex when more powerful but compact models were required. The idea behind thecompact microscope is the physical compression of a lengthy projection to thelimited space of a compact tube, delivering the shrunken design to customers whowish to conserve space. The “problem” with compact optical microscopes lies inbending the necessary wide beam through a small space. The “trick” in a compoundmicroscope is to keep the image rays from diverging prematurely between lensstages.The long expansion space required for divergent beam magnification had to be“folded” and “convoluted” within imaging tubes. Large numbers of lensesperformed this duty. Being thus convoluted by lenses to achieve magnification,images produced by most expensive bench microscopes were inherently limited.Since the diverging image in these microscopes is “interrupted” within a greatlyshortened space by means of several optical stages, the microscopes cannotproduce great magnifications with either clarity or brilliance.Each optical stage continually bends the image until a tremendous effectivedivergence is achieved. The effects are dramatic, but the necessary stagesintroduce optical resistances by which magnifications are inherently limited.Fundamental problems with white light alone complicated the problems thatdesigners faced. Breaking into spectral components, each color refused to focusin exactly the same point. As a result, chromatic aberrations blurred everyimage.The light-crossing action of each lens brought widely diverging light beams intothe ocular lens. It was pivotal that these rays be parallel. Images lost most oftheir radiant power against the tube walls before arriving in the final ocular.Therefore more corrective lenses were added in the beam path to bend the lightback from the tube walls. Differences when light traveled between lenses and airintroduced more aberrations. Batteries of corrective lenses, crowns, andcomponents so loaded the light path with crystal that images lost their originalbrightness. These horrendous optical problems were never completely solved,despite the high cost of these instruments.All of these optical horrors were the result of an old tradition that compelleddesigners to maintain familiar outward forms. The projection microscope is sosimple and potent, one wonders why newer designs had not been developed with asmuch dedication and zeal. It was the outward form that compelled the convolutionof projection microscope simplicity, detracting from the excellence of magnifiedimages. What was really lacking in optical microscopy was the development oftrue, tiny radiant points of monochromatic light. These diverging ray sourcescould produce novel and economical projection microscopes.The numerous optical components of most excellent laboratory microscopes areconfigured to prevent image splitting, image incoherence, and other opticalaberrations. When light and glass are introduced the geometric ideal suddenlybecomes severely limited. The optical ideals fall short of the geometric ideal.Geometric rays do not fade with infinite distance. Light rays do. Geometric raysdo not blur at their edges with increasing divergence. Light rays do.Geometrically magnified lines do not diminish in their intensity. Light imagesdo. A successful optical approximation to the geometric ideal would produce asuperior microscope. Rife decided to manipulate all the possible variables inorder to approach, as closely as possible, each part of the ideal geometricconstruction. If such a feat could be accomplished, he would successfully bridgethe gap between optical and electron microscopy.POINTSTo be sure, numerous individuals had accidentally discovered enormousmagnification effects while experimenting in completely different fields ofstudy. A magnifying system that magnified much smaller infinitesimals thanviruses appeared in 1891. Nikola Tesla developed a remarkable carborundum-pointvacuum lamp and made an accidental observation that opened a new world of visionto science.Tesla began inventing single-wire vacuum lamps for purposes of illumination.These were large glass globes powered by very rapidly impulsed currents. Theimpulse currents made the single supported wires glow to white brilliance,melting them. Because they were impractical for public use, he sought toalleviate this condition by using special crystals, for which high meltingpoints were required. An assortment of such materials was poised at thesingle-wire termination. When electrified, they suddenly became radiant.His experiments included the use of diamonds, rubies, zircons, zirconia, carbon,and carborundum. He found it possible to blast the natural gems after a fewseconds of electrification. Before exploding, each of these crystallineterminations released puzzling patterns of light across the globe surface. Thissymmetrical pattern of points attracted Tesla’s attention. They appeared whenthe current was turned on for just an instant.Moreover, Tesla noticed that the brilliant fixed points of light remained infixed positions each time he applied the current. Equally astounding was thefact that each material portrayed distinctive point symmetries on the glassenclosure. The most resilient and successful crystalline material wascarborundum, which he ultimately adopted for practical use. This too gave itscharacteristic point symmetry across the globe.Tesla was not sure what he had discovered. He intuitively surmised that thesepoint patterns of light somehow revealed the crystalline structure of theexcited materials. He also used the geometrical construction to obtain hisdeductions. His thoughts turned to the internal crystal conditions. Aselectrically charged particles were propelled and ejected from the carborundum,they formed infinitesimal points that diverged and impacted the inside of theglobe housing the carborundum. These brilliant points of light were always ofthe same symmetry because the ejected particles were passing through a fixedgrating, a crystalline grating.He theorized that this fixed pattern represented the greatly magnifiedcrystalline symmetry. This simple apparatus was the world’s first point-electronmicroscope. The phenomenon responsible for the defined projection of crystallinespaces is referred to as field emission. The remarkable X-ray photography of Maxvon Laue already permitted the sighting of crystalline atoms. In this scheme athin crystal point was placed at a critical distance from an X-ray source.Entering and passing through the crystal slice, divergent X rays produced agreatly magnified image of crystal atoms on photographic negatives.The result of von Laue’s experiment was astonishing, but was a purely geometricconsequence. Divergent rays from a vanishingly small radiant point cantheoretically magnify equally small specks to immense size. But while both Teslaand von Laue produced wonderful results with particle-like emissions, thepractical achievement of these ideals was diminished when using optical lightrays.Emile Demoyens (in 1911) claimed to have seen extremely tiny mobile specks undera powerful optical microscope, but only at noon during the months of May, June,and July! Colleagues thought him quite mad, but Dr. Gaston Naessens hascomprehended why these specific time periods permitted such extreme viewing.During these seasonal times the noonday sunlight contains great amounts of deepultraviolet light. The shortened wavelengths provide a sudden optical boost,permitting the observation of specks that are normally invisible.Progress in optical science seemed limitless and free. It was anticipated thatno limit could bar humanity from viewing the very smallest constituents ofmatter. But when the physicist Ernst Abbe challenged the high hopes of opticalscience by imposing certain theoretical limits on optical resolution, all thesehopes seemed to dissolve. Abbe claimed that optical resolution depended entirelyon incident light wavelengths, the limit being one-third of the light wavelengthused to illumine the specimen. According to Abbe, the extreme ultraviolet lightof 0.4 microns wavelength could not be used to resolve the details of objectssmaller than 0.15 microns.This theoretical “death-knell” discouraged most optical designers of the time.He claimed that the resolution of optical microscopes was restricted from 1,600to 25 diameters and, because of this, developing newer optical microscopes was afutile pursuit. Since resolution is the ability of a magnifying instrument toidentify details and ultrafine levels of internal structure, the Abbe limitimposed a serious halt on the development of newer optical microscopes.Continual medical progress rides entirely on the excellence of its instruments.In the absence of new and excellent optical instruments of greater precision,medical progress grinds to a screaming halt. When this happens, in the absenceof “true” vision, academics write endless papers. True knowledge, reliant onvision and experimentation, is replaced by unfounded speculation.Others conceived of electron microscope designs, taking advantage of the Abberestriction for lucrative purposes. These developers were not good planners,failing to recognize that electron microscopy would place equally gravelimitations on biological researchers. Electron beams kill living matter, and bymagnifying images only after killing them, no living thing could ever beobserved in natural stages of activity through electron microscopy. But, ifmoney were to be made, then “all was possible.” Despite the protests ofqualified medical personnel, RCA continued its development with Vladimir Zworyknat their helm.Electron microscopy, rationally impelled by the Abbe limit, became the new goalof young financiers. Despite the protests of major researchers, RCA continuedits propaganda campaigns. This technological imposition, were it developed intoa marketable product line, would severely handicap the work of every medicalresearcher. Pathologists would be literally forced to accept the limitations ofthe anticipated electron microscope.Bracing themselves for the announcement of mass-produced electron microscopes,corporate researchers prepared themselves for the laboratory adaptations theywould be forced to adopt. Manuals were already being distributed. They would beunable to watch progressive activities in the boasted “highest magnificationsever achieved.” Before RCA reached the goal, however, others had alreadychallenged the capabilities of electron microscopy. The unexpected developmenttemporarily threw RCA off balance. The competitors had challenged the Abbe limitand seemed to be optically working their way into realms in which RCA hadclaimed “exclusive” rights.DEEP VIOLETVibrating above the deep ultraviolet range were the X rays of von Laue’sprojection microscope. But this realm was not good for pathologists since X rayswould only reveal the structure of crystalline substances. Some designers wentahead and built soft X-ray microscopes. These devices placed heavy requirementson the preparation of specimens. X rays passed right through specimens andkilled them if they were alive to begin with. The very best X-ray images of tinyspecimens required organism-killing metallic stains. Biologists needed to seetheir specimens in the living state.While engineers at RCA were scrambling to take the competitive edge and seizethe new market, several designers of ultramicroscopes began to successfullychallenge the Abbe limit. Ultramicroscopes constructed by Louis C. Graton andErnest B. Dane, Jr. (of Harvard University) succeeded in developing resolutionsof 6,000 diameters with magnifications of 50,000 diameters.Dr. Francis Lucas of Bell Telephone Labs developed a modified version of thissystem in which a maximum magnification of 60,000 diameters was developed. Notonly did this work significantly reduce the theoretical limits set by Abbe, butthe ultra-microscope that Lucas designed actually empowered Bell Labs to competewith RCA in the microscope field. Rife had previously achieved resolutions of6,000 diameters with magnifications of 50,000 diameters. And now, Rife believedhe had a means by which these preliminary feats could be greatly outperformed.The Abbe limit, a theoretically perfect expression, was dissolving before thenew empirical evidence.Of course, RCA ultimately outdid the propaganda campaign for their own electronmicroscope system, wiping out the optical systems of both Bell Labs and HarvardUniversity. Nevertheless, independent researchers preferred those ultravioletmicroscopes to any system that RCA could market. The ultraviolet microscopeswere attractive because they permitted life-active observations. Consequently,pathologists were not impressed by the extra magnifications of electronmicroscopy.OBJECTIVEUltraviolet light for ultra-microscopes is an absolute necessity. The successfuloperation of any such device depends on deep UV rays. Monochromatic ultravioletsources prevented many of the familiar optical aberrations common to opticalmicroscopy. Blurring and fringe degeneration when passing through the opticalresistance of lenses would be minimal. The ultraviolet source would also need tobe of the shortest possible wavelength in order to approach the geometric rayidea.All optical components in the ultra-microscope would then have to be composed ofpure quartz crystal in order to flawlessly transduce the deep ultraviolet rays.Even the specimen slides were made of thin quartz glass. The ultra-microscopesof Dane, Graton, and Lucas used as few lenses as possible, being virtually pureprojection microscopes.According to Lucas, resolution one-tenth of the illuminating light wavelengthwas obtained. This broke the so-called Abbe optical restrictions by an order of300 percent; the resolution was brought up to 0.05 microns. How was thispossible? Dane and Graton further stated that far greater resolution could beobtained through lenses than claimed by their manufacturers. The reason forthis? As long as the manufacturers had accepted the theoretical limits there wasno incentive toward progress in the field. No one bothered to find out!The ultra-microscopes demonstrated beyond question that lenses do in factsurpass theoretical limits. The manufacturers, eager to maintain credibility inthe academies, had simply endorsed whatever the physicists wrote. Equally assignificant was the fact that each of these ultramicroscopes did not require thefixing of specimens before viewing. The embodiment of each ultra-microscope gavenew drive to researchers who wished to see live pathological stages in tissuecultures. The systems were immediately demanded and obtained by numerous seriousresearch institutions on both sides of the Atlantic.Certain highly respected researchers came to believe that the most basic lawsconcerning physical light were fundamentally flawed. Perhaps light was of anentirely different nature than supposed. This, they mentioned, was why the Abbelimit was such a distorted mathematical expression. Light was not what thephysicists declared it to be. This is why Abbe’s assessment was so obviouslyflawed. But what other assumed truths were holding back fresh discovery?Empirical observations now replaced the theoretical piles with discoveries thatwere once termed “unlikely” by qualified authorities.When researchers realized the great cost that the Abbe limit had so long imposedon microscope designers, they began challenging every known theoretical limitpertaining to their fields of study. Every scientific premise was questionedduring the astounding decade of the 1930s. Every applicable optical rule wasagain subject to fresh questioning, which epitomized the spirit of the renewedscientific mind. New vision filled the researchers, challenging the inertialworld again. The most significant effect of these new ultra-microscopes was arenewed questioning process. Now pathologists and biologists alike were giveninstruments with which to peer into the most infinitesimal natural recesses.With the ability of medical researchers to look into the deepest pathogeniclairs, new cures for ancient maladies could be effected. The war was on, andfresh crusaders came to the battlefield armed with light. Curiously, the linesof battle brought two distinct groups to fight the same foe. Unfortunately, onegroup desired all the glory and crushed its more sensitive brothers.The Rockefeller Institute extended their campaign by highlighting the efficacyof electron microscopy, securing the sale of their new units. The RCA cash flowwas unrestricted now. Electron microscopy coupled its forces with thepharmacological industry, producing its line of allopathic medicines. Those whotook upon themselves the inquisitorial profession, rather than the profession oftruth, found themselves drowning in seas of new developments that theirbusiness-minded patrons wished to eradicate. Independent university researchersmaintained their poise as the prime recipients of fresh and astonishingdiscoveries that shook the medical world. This would not long be tolerated bythe growing pharmaceutical monopolies and trusts who wanted total domination ofthe field.“MAGNIFICANT”The encroaching economic depression of the time had crushed the generalpopulace. Rife had been designing and assembling ultraviolet precisionmicroscopes of superior quality from 1920 onward. He had planned to build a farsuperior instrument: the super microscope. The design was based on theoreticalconsiderations developed during his preliminary experimentation in optics. Nowthis work was abruptly terminated. Finding himself out of employment, Rifesought the ordinary work of those who are in need. Humbled and not proud, hetemporarily sought a salary in less intellectual venues.Hired as private chauffeur to Henry H. Timkin, a wealthy and philanthropic motormagnate, he gradually won both the respect and willing ear of his adventurousemployer. He could not keep his wonderful dream to himself. On long journeys toboring boardroom meetings, Timkin engaged Rife in detailed discussions on hismedical work. Rife eagerly entered these discussions with an enthralled candorthat caught his employer quite by surprise. The seriousness and integrity of theman did not catch Timkin by surprise. Timkin, recognizing quality when he heardit, listened.Rife’s great stature was not hidden, despite his humble position. And when hespoke of these designs and research goals, the very air began to brighten aroundhim! He mentioned regret at having to postpone his work, but was very sure thatall would turn out well. What he had shared with Timkin was enormous; it wasinspiration of the purest kind. When Timkin and his business partner HarryBridges realized exactly what Rife hoped to achieve, they made a resolutedecision to arrange financial support for the work at hand.Timkin and Bridges created an endowment fund to finance Rife and his astonishingresearch. Rife was delighted, delighted to tears. An emotional man, he promisedthat no one would be disappointed. He would work until he achieved success. Alaboratory was constructed on the Timkin estate grounds (Point Loma,California), and Rife set to work with a fury that surprised those who lovinglysurrounded him. Timkin and Bridges were taken aback by the rapidity with whichRife completed each design that he began. His efforts were relentless, a trueinspiration to the equally loving people who supported his research. It was veryapparent that the pensive and gentle doctor was serious in the extreme.Rife aggressively pursued and achieved what had not been done in the field ofultra-microscopy. His mind turned to the method he had conceived so many yearsbefore. The dream that Rife had originally received was now in view, that oflooking for more light. He decided to try filling the entire objective withcylindrically cut quartz prisms. There would be no difference in the refractiveindex from start to finish along the optical path. Quartz prisms would “openout” each ray convergence, maintaining strictly parallel ray cadence. Anincreased ray content being thus returned to the ocular, the image would bebrilliant in appearance and of high resolution.This configuration of quartz prisms caused the rays to “zigzag” in twenty-twolight bends. The internal optical path was entirely composed of twenty-twoquartz blocks, fitted snugly to lenses. Now, specimen-emergent light wouldlaunch out in parallel paths through quartz prisms, being magnified only whenthey reached each quartz lens. This optical tracking method would ensure thebrilliance of the emergent image.A second optical innovation was added to this brilliant configuration. Rifedecided to use a phenomenon by which strong specimen-entrant light stimulatesinternal fluorescence in the specimen. Pumping the specimen with brilliantultraviolet-rich light would shift the divergence point into the very heart ofthe specimen rather than beneath, forcing the specimen to radiate its ownbrilliant ultraviolet rays.Here was a true, vanishingly small radiant source with which to illuminate thespecimens: they themselves would become the radiant source! This concept wastruly sublime, since the very infinitesimal particles themselves were now madeto radiate brilliant and diverted rays. This scheme was truly original from thevery start. Rife then designed a system by which selected portions of theultraviolet spectrum could be split and directed into the specimen using apolarizer. Turning this component of the system would allow each specimen tobrightly fluoresce in its own absorption spectrum, the infinitesimal specksradiating their own maximum brilliance.Theoretically, it was possible to magnify these brilliant specular rays to anydegree. But a secondary monochromatic ultraviolet ray would perform an unheardof wonder. When combined with the brilliant internal fluorescence of thespecimen, this secondary ultraviolet addition would heterodyne the light. Thismeant that light pitches from the specimen would be raised far above theiroriginal values. At such short wavelengths, the resolving power of this devicewould be incredible.image [images/9781594775093_041.jpg]Figure 4.2. Privately funded during the Great Depression, Rife went to work ondesigns for what he called a “super microscope,” which used cylindrically cutquartz prisms along the ocular path to maintain a strictly parallel ray cadence,which resulted in greater brilliance and resolution in images.An additional monochromatic deep ultraviolet beam was mixed with the florescentradiance of spectrums, producing an astonishing visual sharpness of otherwiseinvisible objects. The illumination scheme and the tube-filled cluster of quartzprisms (designed to maintain the spectrum-emergent rays in absolute parallels)were now brought together. Rife claimed that these parallel lines were withinone wavelength of accuracy, an astonishing claim.He soon created a small ultra-microscope whose fundamental mode of operationviolated the supposed laws of optics. This design outperformed all previousultra-microscopes. So astonishing was this feat that the Franklin Institute, inrare form, published a long and detailed series of articles concerning thedevelopments of Rife. They were also given several of these units forpreservation, where they remain to this day.This microscope was different, totally different, because it could see virusesin their active stages (not only in their dormancy) with magnified clarity.Rife’s Prismatic Microscope surpassed the theoretical limits that were possiblefor optical microscopy in 1930, giving unheard of resolutions of 17,000diameters; three times the resolution developed by Lucas.The first Prismatic Microscope was a horizontal optical bench assembly, mountedon a massive pier. Fitted with the finest photographic instruments, Rife’smicroscope took breathtaking photographs at unheard of magnifications. Theresolution was so staggering that members of research institutions rushed towatch Rife’s demonstrations.His accomplishments were extolled by the entire medical establishment on bothsides of the Atlantic. An incredible number of professional researchpublications devoted lengthy articles to his achievements. His findings wereduplicated and reported by leading medical institutions whose names are wellknown, throwing into sharp relief our general lack of knowledge about his life’sstory.Rife, humble enough to have worked as a chauffeur, had been raised fromobscurity to fame, from shadows to light. The man’s genius was only equaled byhis upstanding character. The Timken family adored him. The Rife laboratory wascompletely equipped with the very finest apparatus money could buy. Rifemethodically undertook new research ventures. Incredible new biologicaldiscoveries followed him in every direction. Now, with this “ultravision,” hewas able to peer with his colleagues into dimensions unheard of. Thesediscoveries quite often challenged accepted biological and medical notions.Rife wanted to create an institute in which he could train younger specialistsin the operation of these wonderful ultra-microscopes. Mass production of thedevices would be ensured. They would become fixtures in every professionallaboratory. Money was not the aim of this research. Monies were already secured.Rife had a singular goal and demonstrated the passion associated with his quest.He developed seven different models of this initial projection-type PrismaticMicroscope in quick succession. The horizontal projection format was convertedto a more compact vertical orientation, serving the needs of pathologists andbiologists and practical laboratory settings. Several of these wonderfulprismatic models may be seen in the various archival films and photographs takenin Rife’s laboratories.If the Rife Prismatic Microscopes outperformed every standard laboratorymicroscope in being able to discern and photograph virus particles in theiractive state, the Universe Microscope surpassed all previous markers. In 1933the creation of the Universal Microscope accorded resolutions in an astoundingexcess of 31,000 diameters, with magnifications in excess of 60,000 diameters.image [images/9781594775093_042.jpg]Figure 4.3. Royal Rife’s Universal MicroscopeUsing technically precise photographic enlargement techniques, Rife was able toprovide 300,000-diameter magnifications. His calculations indicated that anultraoptical projection microscope giving clarified magnifications of 250,000diameters would be possible. After photographic enlargement, there would be nolimit to the optical viewing power unleashed for researchers.Rife had succeeded in breaking the “vision barrier.” Those familiar with opticsand attainable optical precision states claimed that magnification effects couldnot be obtained with ordinary principles of light. Beyond simple opticalparameters, other light energies become more active in such devices. Thefocusing process is radionic in effect, using the penetrating Od*7[9781594775093_ftn.xhtml#ft7] luminescence. The stimulation of special retinalmodes releases the anomalous perception with its reported ultraopticalmagnifications. Careful examination of the Rife Ultra-microscope reveals tubesfilled with quartz prisms, identical in basic use as the patented radionicanalyzers of T. G. Hieronymus (Lehr).Viruses remained absolutely invisible to the eye when cultures were searchedwith the then-standard Zeiss dark-field (oil-immersion) microscope. Rife’sPrismatic Microscopes were immediately obtained by Northwestern UniversityMedical School, the Mayo Foundation, the British Laboratory of TropicalMedicine, and other equally prestigious research groups. These models producedmagnification and resolution up to 18,000 diameters.A space composed of brilliant light, where mind-illuminating light merged withlight in the eyes, was now opened before him. Fields, all of light. The newvision would be unstoppable. No cloak of invisibility would protect the foe now.Soon everyone would see, and the armadas of death and shadow would bevanquished. The spoils of this war would flood humanity with indescribabletreasure. Light and life would again be unleashed in a world where shadow anddeath had reigned far too long. The immediate task of cataloging viral pathogenshad begun.QUESTWith the new Prismatic Microscope models, both Rife and Dr. A. I. Kendall(Northwestern University Medical School) were able to observe, demonstrate, andphotograph “filterable” pathogens (viruses) in 1931. Moreover, they were perhapsfirst to discern the transition of these bacilli from dormancy to activity overa specific period of time. Freshly made cultures were sampled at specificstages, revealing fixed periods of quiescence and activity.An initial tissue substrate was prepared in which bacillus typhosus wascultured. After several days’ growth, samples of this lethal culture werefiltered through a fine triple-zero Berkefeld “W” filter. This filtrationprocess was repeated ten times. When viewed under the best available laboratorymicroscopes a turbidity was seen, but no organisms whatsoever appeared.Under the Rife Prismatic Microscope, polarizer adjusted, the bacilli in thissample fluoresced with a bright turquoise blue coloration. Two forms wereobserved, taking the researchers by surprise. Long, relatively clear, andnonmotile bacilli were found alongside a great population of free-swimmingovoids, granules of high motility. The motile granules glowed in aself-florescent turquoise light at a magnification of 5,000 diameters.These motile forms were transferred to a second fresh substrate and allowed togrow for days. The same filtration process was performed. When sampled randomlyover a four-day period, the filtered specimen revealed something remarkable.Rife and Kendall observed relative quiescence, with bright turquoise ovoids atone end. The implication was enormous. Exact transition periods were thereforedetermined with precision and the entire process photographed through specialattachments designed by Rife.At specific intervals of activation, the clear bacilli discharged the turquoisemotile forms into the culture. These blue ovoids were the real cause of thedisease. The long and clear bacilli were only hosts. Transitions back and forth(between clear host-dormancy and motile turquoise granules) were observed andreported in the professional journals. These findings were corroborated first byDr. A. Foord, chief pathologist at Pasadena Hospital, and later confirmed andreported by Dr. E. C. Rosenow at the Mayo Foundation (in 1932). The RifePrismatic Microscope was quickly earning its reputation.Soon, other specimens were obtained and analyzed by the team. Activepoliomyelitis cultures were studied, the virus successfully isolated,identified, and photographed in 1932 by Rife and Kendall. In these culturesstreptococcus and motile blue forms resembling typhosus were recognized. Theselast reports were immediately transmitted to the Mayo Foundation and duplicatedby Dr. E. Rosenow. Dr. Karl Meyer (director of the Hooper Foundation for MedicalResearch, University of California) came to the Rife Research Laboratories withDr. Milbank Johnson, examining and corroborating the stated results. Theimpossible and anomalous became fact. Bacilli could act as virus carriers.Furthermore, poliomyelitis victims evidenced a startling degree of typhosus-likeassociated virus.Frightening implications came when comparisons between the Prismatic Microscopeand the Zeiss scopes were made. All of the previous studies made with Zeissscopes returned negative results. Such reports flooded the literature. Thefiltrates had been maintaining their cloak of invisibility for years.Professionals, bereft of this clarified vision, were concocting numerousspeculative explanations for the appearance of these disease states. The vacuumproduced by lack of visible evidence was producing erroneous theories. Manyhighly qualified persons, in absence of the foresight dictating that they shouldknow better, steadfastly maintained that victims of certain diseases weresuffering from internally developed conditions.The Rife ultramicroscope was about to trigger a war on viruses. Because of theself-fluorescent “staining” method, Rife observed live specimens exclusively, adistinguishing feature of his technology. The florescent coloration of eachpathogen was cataloged, a historic endeavor. Tuberculosis bacilli appearedemerald green, leprosy was ruby red, E. coli was mahogany colored—each one waswickedly deceptive in the pretty colors. The degree of precision demonstrated inRife’s catalogs bears the unmistakable mark of genius.We can view him at work in the archival movies. Photographic arrays of all kindsmay be seen in this footage, including that taken using the professional Scandia35 mm movie camera with which he made stop-action films of viral incubationperiods. Rife made sure to document every discovery. It was novel at the time todocument every image on movie film as well as in still shots. He methodicallywent through every possible pathogenic specimen, photographing the deadlyfamilies.The Prismatic Microscope was piercing into new shadows. Rife recognized unknownvirus species everywhere. And then he turned his vision into the deepest shadow.He looked at the dreaded disease: Cancer.In the absence of fact, in the absence of vision, researchers developedcontradictory theories concerning cancer and its development. Thesecontradictory theories were eventually codified in the professional literature,a self-neutralizing amalgam of conjecture. Researchers were forced to examinethe biochemical effects, and not the cause, of cancer. Most could not imaginewhat would drive cells into the bizarre and abnormal cycles common to cancertissues. There was certainly “no visible cause.”Rife began obtaining a wide variety of malignant tissues in 1931. The full powerrange of the first Prismatic Microscope was turned on these tissue samples witha vengeance. Rife was a master pathologist, one whose techniques could beobserved in his cinematic presentations. Was he seeing correctly? What werethese motile forms, glowing with a beautiful violet-red coloration? They movedswiftly through his field of view.Rife obtained increasingly diverse tumors from wider and more diverse clinicalsources. An amazing twenty thousand of these tissue samples were obtained andcultured. Incubating and culturing each of these required care and time.Absolutely sterile conditions were maintained. He employed several groups oflarge high-pressure steam autoclaves. No question of contamination could existin this setting. Specimens removed from these cultures were filtered throughunused triple-zero Berkefeld porcelain, mixed with triple-distilled water.Examination of each separate sample under the Prismatic Microscope revealed aconsistent truth. There they were again! Always the same violet-red presence. Hecalled it the BX virus, finding it present in every case of cancer in humans.Were these same violet-red motile forms the very cause of cancer? Colleagueswere able to verify these findings only when using his microscope. Both Rife andKendall successfully demonstrated the isolation of the BX virus to more thanfifty research pathologists associated with the most noteworthy institutions.Many writers of medical theory had already postulated that there were somecancer cases that were viral in origin, but they never cited that there areagencies universally causing the cancer; there was speculation, the endlesspapers, the lectures, the theories—talk and more talk. Rife saw the universalcalls of cancer. There, in full sight, was the positive proof. In case afterunmistakable case, Rife found the very same agency at work, and it was alwaysthe same violet-red motile forms. It mattered not where the tissue materialscame from. Independent acquisition of tissue samples were obtained by others whothen verified these findings in distant laboratories. They were using the RifePrismatic Microscopes.Rife succeeded in isolating the BX virus in 1931. He cultured this evil spawnand proceeded to demonstrate its incubation and activation periods. TransferringBX virus from culture to host, and from host to culture, all became routine. Onehundred and four separate transfers were successfully made with various BXstrains. Rife witnessed the appearance of another related viral cancer-causingstrain, the BY virus, found to be a much larger strain of the sarcoma group.Demonstration of the infection in an incubation process was subsequentlyaffirmed by other professionals.Rife assembled high-speed movie cameras in order to clock the periods of BXvirus activity. When the film ran out and was developed, he and all hiscolleagues could watch the deadly dance. He stepped back for a moment andsurveyed the photographic evidence, flickering on the wall. These wicked,damned, wiggling specks!Rife now watched in horror as the malignant act was revealed before his eyes athigh speed. BX virus infection required special “weakened” physiological states.Contracted as a flu-type infection, the virus incubated in its host physiologyfor a time. When specific detrimental physiochemical states were compounded, thevirus stirred into activity.Stimulating the rapid proliferation of cell division, the BX virus forced thehost body to manufacture the nuclear material needed in order to survive. Tumorswere found to be sites where BX viral colonies were rampant. Occasionally therewere persons who demonstrated spontaneous remissions. These were exceedinglyrare cases where antibodies actually drove off the attacking virus. Most personscould not summon this degree of response. Once the virus took control ofcellular integrity, death was imminent. There had to be a means for destroyingthis enemy. There had to be a light.BREAKTHROUGHOthers, working in distant laboratories, did not claim the same success. Whynot? Because, using the over-celebrated electron microscopes, they could not seewhat Rife saw. The truth regarding the BX virus was that electron microscopycould not image it at all. What had occurred in the other research labs becameclear again to the man with eyes to see.In preparing specimens for an electron microscope, technicians “kill” the tissuespecimens. The process involves placing the specimen in a high-vacuum chamber.Bombardment of the specimen with metal ions is the “staining” procedure. Thethin metal film then gets highly projected. The electron spray is directed intothis prepared specimen and is then magnified by successive intense magneticfield coils. At that point, images are watched on a phosphorescent screen orphotographed directly.Electron microscopy mishandled frail viruses. It mishandled the frail BX virus,destroying it during each preparation process. The same ritual was repeated ahundred times with the same negative results. Few of these technicians couldcomprehend why this virus did not appear on their viewing screens.Overconfidence in the RCA system blocked common reason. Electron microscopy doesnot resolve frail viruses because they are shattered and dissolve during thepreparation stage. Quite recently the search for the HIV virus evidencedfrustration again because of these inherent limitations of electron microscopy.The BX viruses cavorted and wiggled boldly before Rife’s eyes. But how todestroy them? To find an immunological tool for each of these represented anenormous task, a project that would take centuries. Humanity did not have thatmuch time to wait. No, some other, more universal means had to be developed bywhich this, and all of the other pathogenic forms, could be dissolved.Protozoa and bacteria of all kinds could be destroyed by exposing them tospecial ultraviolet spectra. Perhaps the BX virus would succumb to suchexposure. Rife had to know, and, to this end, he began a long and arduoussearch, looking for spectra that could destroy virus cultures.Rife discovered that deadly viruses actually thrived in the radiations ofspecific elements. Radium and cobalt-60 were the notable ones. Dormant virusesbecame virulent in these energetic emanations. The horror filled him again.Medical practice was attempting to cure cancer with these very radiations! Therehad to be some light spectra that destroyed the viral activity altogether. Hesearched through the periodic table. Electrified argon and neon also broughtintensified virulent activity from dormant cultures. He actually used argonlamps to grow virus-infected tissue cultures with greater rapidity. But therehad to be a spectral range that killed these terrible death agents.No light seemed to have any effect on their crystalline structures. This is whyit was possible for him to view viral activity under intense light in the firstplace!Then he thought of crystals. How would we destroy a crystal? What do chemicalsdo to germs—dissolve them, take them apart, shatter them?He had done this very thing in 1917 with protozoa and large bacteria. He knew itwas possible to shatter these kinds of pathogens by the application of a suddenelectrical impulse. His early attempts with small radio transmitters and simplermicroscopes had proved to be somewhat effective. He used Telefunken output tubesto produce the impulses. Operated by a small generator, this simple deviceprojected fifty radio-frequency watts to his samples.His original inspiration applied to larger pathogens. It therefore needed noexcessive frequency; shortwave was sufficient. It was certainly possible tointerpolate the necessarily superhigh resonant pitch needed to shatter anymicrobe. But viruses? How high would this pitch need to be? If not attainable,could he use some much lower harmonic of this fundamental at greater powerlevels? Could he find the lethal pitch for every found pathogen?Equipment was quickly assembled. He needed a generator of extremelyshort-duration electroimpulses. Direct current electrical “spikes” of quickduration, when applied to a gas-filled discharge tube, would project electricrays toward an infected site. The tube could not simply be a high vacuum. Thatwould release dangerously penetrating X rays. X rays would stimulate the BXstrain into increased activity. No, the projection tube required a very lightgas, one whose response was almost instantaneous. The gas Rife desired would beone whose mass would in no way interfere with the impulses.Hydrogen was used in special high-power thyratrons: quick-acting high-voltageswitches used in diathermy machines and (later) in radar systems. Old X-raytubes often failed in their operation because they became filled with hydrogenand helium mixtures. Such X-ray tubes were generally discarded. His newprojector was one such old X-ray tube. He tested its output, adjusting theexcitation circuit so as not to release even soft X rays. The tube glowed, agood sign. This meant that there was sufficient gas for the release ofelectrical rays. Rife set the polarity so the tube would pulsate electropositivespikes of a specific duration.Power was ready. Pathogens cavorted boldly in view. Poised at the PrismaticMicroscope, he fired the X-ray tube. Turning to the tuning dial near thespecimen, he would know the lethal pitch by watching the pathogens. When these“exploded” he would mark the setting. If this method worked, then he couldmethodically correlate each lethal pitch with its pathogen. Soon, a catalog oflethal pitches would be amassed. With this Rife could wage victorious warsagainst every disease in existence.Rife swept through the diathermy range, which he calculated should vibrate theseviruses to pieces. Empirical evidence always contradicted the theoretical. Quitebelow the calculated extreme frequencies, the BX virus suddenly dissolved. Heswitched off the transmitter and sat there quite amazed. The scene in themicroscope was unreal. Not a fraction of a second at the lethal pitch and thespecimen was reduced to a globular mass. The viruses were stuck together inshattered fragments! He had successfully “devitalized” them.Fine-tuned lethal frequencies now filled his catalog. With great precision Rifedetermined every lethal pitch as planned. Armaments of light against legions ofshadow. Analysis of the electropositive impulse showed that its radiance waspenetrating, intense, and unidirectional—more like invisible light rays of pureelectrical force. What then was this strange lightlike power? Experiments provedthat virus cultures were absolutely incapacitated, congealed, and destroyed bythe electropositive impulse. The power of an extreme form of light? Had suchlight ever been seen before?This energy had been accidentally generated in 1872 by Elihu Thomson and EdwinHouston, but they had generated electrical rays, not waves. Unidirectionalelectric impulses of great power radiated electric rays, not waves. These rayspenetrated all kinds of matter, stone and steel alike. The resultant sparkscould be drawn from every insulated metal object in the large building in whichthe experiment was performed.Later in that century, Nikola Tesla accidentally observed the same electric rayproduction. He studied the phenomenon exclusively, developing impulse generatorsand electric ray projectors. He referred to this phenomenon when speaking ofelectric rays that evidenced a light-like nature. Rife had rediscovered thisphenomenon. Tesla spoke of his own “millimeter rays,” mentioning their“bacteriocide” value.FORTRESSWhereas the destruction of virus cultures on a quartz slide was easilyaccomplished, the destruction of pathogen cultures in human hosts was not. Rayshad to penetrate through skin, musculature, and bone—which offered considerableresistance. Rays might lose their original accurate pitch in this transit,destroying the intended action altogether.Fortuitously and strangely, the pathogens were found to be some two thousandtimes weaker than body cells. This meant that pathogens could be destroyed bythe radiant impulse method without harming the patient. How sublime.Pathologists had treated microorganisms as chemical systems for a century,working overtime in order to find each specific chemical-dissolving agent.Rife’s method treated all germs as mechanical systems, dissolving them withvibrations.Rife himself had been exposed to the instantaneous blast without harm. Whenadjusting the rates to annihilate ordinary viral infections, he noticed that hebecame drowsy and tired for a few hours. Determining the cause of this as theresultant toxin release after infected agents were coagulated, he recognized theneed for a detoxifying agent. Physiology had to be prepared for the curativeimpulse. Exposure would release large amounts of toxic pathogen fragments intothe bloodstream all at once. The ray cure had to be metered in doses. Bodytissues had to be flooded with special fluid electrolytes to aid the enhancedand rapid elimination of toxins.To stimulate the deepest potential shattering action, the patient had to bebased in a “carrier field”: an electrical body permeation in which the impulselight rays would penetrate into and through every body cavity. Superficialexposures would not completely cure the patient. This light ray energy had topenetrate the body completely. Rife conceived a method whereby patients could beenveloped in a harmless body-permeating electric field of acoustic frequency,while the intense electroimpulses of short duration would be simultaneouslyprojected. In this manner, efficacious electroradiant impulses could shatterspecific pathogens throughout the infected body with no harm to the patient.Rife used two banks of oscillators with which to generate his primary andsecondary impulse fields. Acoustic generators supplied the primary field of“immersion.” A diathermy machine was coupled to a powerful transmittingamplifier to provide the shattering impulse. Two radiant energies were thusemployed to destroy pathogens in vivo.Rife discovered that virus cultures were not safe from the radiant impulses ofthe special ray tube. Fixed to the lethal pitch of the single pathogen, the rayswere unerring in their message. Selectivity was the hallmark of the Rifecurative method. Choosing the lethal pitch for one of these, the others wouldremain unharmed. The target, however, was utterly destroyed.Rife tested the lethal effective distance of his rays, determining the safeplacement of patients from the radiant source. Pathogen cultures did not seem“safe” anywhere near the device. Arranging the tube at one end of hislaboratory, Rife moved cultures away from the radiant tube in staggereddistances. In a final amazing experiment, he took cultures away from thelaboratory in sealed containers. It was found that radiant tube emanationsoperated effectively on viral cultures up to an eight-mile distance! Metalcabinets did not protect viral cultures from the deadly ray effects either,being ray conductive. Even when locked in aluminum cabinets, the entunedlight-like rays destroyed their pathogens wherever they were found.This represented a major medical discovery of greatest value to all humanity.This principle actually made curative broadcast possible. Entire populationscould be electrically “vaccinated” from single monitored sites. The worldpotential of this system was enormous. Now the outbreak of epidemics could becontrolled without the time-consuming need for individual inoculations. Theradiant lethal message would eradicate specific pathogens in a simple broadcast.The constant monitoring of socially prolific germ populations could bemaintained by continual public health broadcasts.CONQUESTHe ran his entire staff through varied frequency exposures. Infections of allkinds each dissolved before the ray. Rife was able to isolate the pathogens ofinfection and destroy them with the mere turn of the dial. The specificity ofthe Raytube device was so precise that singular germ strains could beindividually mass-targeted. People could be cured by the flick of a switch!Firing the tube in the lab provided a continual source of inoculation. After atime, so little toxicity was present in staff members’ bodies that the drowsyeffects were never again encountered. They did not contract any illnesses, noteven a cold.After a time, Rife rarely used gloves when handling the viral specimens.Furthermore, neither he nor his technicians ever contracted any of the diseaseshandled. The Raytube “inoculated” them all against every disease. He reportedthese findings to the community.Rife, a research pathologist, never used these devices in medical practice.Other physicians desired the units for their own purposes, recognizing thepotential for curing human suffering. Dr. Lee De Forest supervised the designand assembly of many oscillator components for the Rife system. W. D. Coolidge(General Electric) himself willingly sent Rice hundreds of X-ray tubes, whichwere altered with a mixture of hydrogen and helium by Rife and his technicians.These improved tubes were tested so that they would project only the desiredelectroimpulse rays.Hearing of these wonders, numerous physicians began requesting that smaller,more portable units be designed. Soon, Rife Raytube devices were being assembledand given to physicians for limited use in their practices. When properlyoperated, these devices returned successful reports, effecting completeeradications of infections and cures of various conditions. There were never anyadverse reports concerning the Rife Raytube instruments, nor would there be.The Rife frequency devices were bringing about a therapy revolution. Strepthroat*8 [9781594775093_ftn.xhtml#ft8] could be cured in an instantaneousexposure, seated in a physician’s office. A specially designed gargling solutionwas given to remove the resulting toxicity from the site.In 1934 Dr. Milbank Johnson, chief medical director of Pacific Mutual LifeInsurance Company, established a therapy center for cancer treatment in ScriptsCastle, San Diego. A staff was brought together from specific institutionsincluding Dr. G. Dock (professor of medicine, Tulane University), Dr. C. Fischer(Children’s Hospital, New York), Dr. W. Morrison (chief surgeon, Santa FeRailroad), Dr. R. Lounsberry, Dr. E. Copp, Dr. T. Burger, Dr. J. Heitger, Dr. O.C. Grunner (Archibald Cancer Research Committee, McGill University), and Dr. E.C. Rosenow (Mayo Clinic). Rife functioned as a general consultant in matters ofsystem therapy.Using a Rife Raytube system, the team received the cancer and tuberculosispatients. Fifteen cancer patients, each pronounced hopeless by medical experts,arrived at the clinic. Each evidenced progressive states of the disease. A fewpatients were ambulatory. Treatments with the Rife Raytube method were routinelyapplied. The dream was becoming real.Recognizing the critical condition of their patients, it was decided thatexposure time would be raised to three minutes in duration. It was discoveredthat exposure could not be repeated without long rest periods. These criticallyill patients could not withstand the extreme resultant toxicity released intothe system as the BX viruses were shattered. Emotional depression often resulteduntil the ray dose was safely analyzed. The team conferred hourly to assess theprogress of each patient. Excessive exposure to the rays could result in severelymphatic infections and blood poisoning. Therefore, three-minute treatmentswere repeated every third day, given that rest periods were necessary in orderfor blood detoxification to occur.Soon, the ray had done its work on the once-terminal victims. Constant blood andtissue samples revealed no BX viral presence in these now fortunate individuals.In sixty days’ treatment time, and after examination by several physicians, eachwas released as cured.The patients were under surveillance, and no relapses occurred. The treatmentwas revolutionary. The results were thrilling and complete. Moreover, they wereconfirmed by a special medical research committee of the University of SouthernCalifornia. Three more clinics were opened with Johnson as general medicalsupervisor. Other participating physicians included Dr. James Couche, Dr. ArthurYale, Dr. R. Haimer, and Dr. R. Stafford. Clinics were operated between 1934 and1938 and had such a remarkable number of cures that it is difficult to list themall without simply reprinting the Rife files. Each of these cases was sent outand corroborated by other (nonparticipating) physicians.In 1939 Rife was formally invited to address the Royal Society of Medicine,which had recently corroborated his findings. He was requested with greatenthusiasm to bring all possible films, slides, and apparatus. Dr. R. E. Seidelreported these findings and formally announced the Rife Raytube System therapyfor cancer in the Journal of the Franklin Institute.1[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt68]The formation of the Ray Beam Tube Corporation was announced, through whichseveral models would become available to the medical world within a short time.Highly skilled hospital staff members and leading physicians were very receptiveto the proliferation of this therapy. Here was a new means for controlling anderadicating any kind of disease by the flick of a switch. This therapy wouldinadvertently challenge pharmacological methods, raising human standards to anew and lofty height. The dream seemed ready to materialize.INQUISITIONRife found both himself and his staff members under a strange series of attacksby unknown agencies. During this time, and under very mysterious circumstances,Johnson was found dead in a hospital bed, after being admitted for a relativelyminor health problem. In 1939, the local chapter of the Medical Associationproceeded to bring Rife to the San Diego Superior Court, but lost their case.Rife could not be charged with malpractice, being a research pathologist anddesigner of medical instruments.This repugnant offense unmasked the heinous resentment behind which manypowerful individuals had previously been camouflaged. The court action itselfcaught Rife completely unawares. A visionary, his entire life had been dedicatedto humanity. Alleviating human suffering was his life’s goal. Here now wasstrange evidence that factions within the medical establishment were actuallymobilizing against proven therapeutic methods. Cancer itself and otherequivalent maladies were being cured. Why then the assault?Growing opposition from deeper factions of the Medical Association broughtpressure on staff members of the Rife Treatment Clinic. Threats and otherunprofessional pressure tactics forced members to leave the team in quicksuccession. In campaigns clearly waged to malign Rife and his findings, theMedical Association assailed remaining participants in the clinic until Rifestood alone.Deeper than the verbal show of malignancy by other colleagues was the horrifyingand insidious motivation, the implication behind the attack. Why would anyonewish to destroy such a great achievement? Who was betraying civilization in thiscrucial instance? Of all betrayals and of all personnel, who in the medicalprofession would seek the eradication of such monumental discoveries? Rife’smind reeled under the weight of these thoughts. This was no mere resistance to anew idea in a time of ignorance. Pasteur had experienced the same indignity. No.This was willful, calculated resistance taking place in what was an allegedlyenlightened time.Horribly shocked at the entire scenario, Rife literally became unhinged incourt. Trembling and weeping, he could not come to terms with the sheer hatredand vehemence exhibited by his antagonists. “Why . . . why are you doing this?”he repeated. The prosecution could not have produced a better effect. Seeingthis weakness as the very means by which to eradicate Rife and his discoveries,they continued to attack him openly. Calling him continually to the witnessstand, they succeeded in destroying this frail-hearted man of humble greatness.In short, the prosecution forced his total collapse.Dr. James Couche was compelled to desist operating Rife therapy clinics underthreat of malpractice. The American Medical Association ruled that no societymember who maintained the use of the Rife Raytube System would be permitted tocontinue medical practice in the United States. Morris Fishbein, a major AMAstockholder, treasurer, censor, controller, and editor of The Journal of theAmerican Medical Association, extended his legal arm to inform each member ofthe Rife team of the impending legal process. All Raytube units would berecalled, impounded, and destroyed by a federal court order, under penalty offines and imprisonment.LIGHTAll participants willingly returned their Rife units except Drs. James Coucheand Arthur Yale. These two surgeons later stated that for twenty-two years afterthis action, they continued to successfully treat and cure thousands of patientswith the Rife Raytube devices that they had secretly maintained. Yale publisheda large and concise chronological account of patients treated and cured in hispractice throughout that twenty-two year period. Notwithstanding the fact that60 percent of severe cancer cases brought to him were medically inoperative,incurable, and hopeless, Yale confirmed that all of these persons were stillalive and living happy, full lives.The Rife microscopes challenged RCA and its lucrative electron microscope. TheRife Raytube system replaced the highly lucrative pharmacological model then inoperation. Such developments did not inspire the entrenched corporations whowere making enormous amounts of money treating chronically ill patients. Rifedeveloped a therapeutic means that worked. This is all too evident by the rageof those who assailed him. Implicated in the suppression campaign were corporatetrusts and government agencies, including the FDA and the National Institute ofHealth.Systematic eradications like this one speak of social control on a vast andhideously deep-rooted scale. The notion that disease proliferation was permittedso that the moneyed interests of pharmaceutical companies could be pursuedunchecked is too terrible to consider. However, federal officers impounded theentire Rife laboratory all too late. Several faithful technicians had alreadypurloined every piece of the priceless equipment, taking laboratory componentsand valuable documents across the Mexico border, where they remain to this day.(John Crane, Rife’s partner and chief engineer, maintains the priceless surplusthere.)Fishbein, the editor and chief censor of the AMA, saw to it that Rife’s name wasstricken from all previous publications, that no professional journal would darepublish anything by Rife, and that no mention would ever be made of Rife’sachievements in formal proceedings.2 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt69] Fishbein’sactions, inescapably linked with the pharmaceutical trusts, were all tooconspicuous.Social control has become a dominant theme since the Second World War. Modifyingand regulating social thought through both legal and financial means has broughtnatural discoveries and true technological developments to a standstill.World-changing discoveries can be made but not proliferated. Cures for diseasescan be proven but not implemented.Has the world now entered a new barbaric and vulgar time where medical wondershave become a regulated property? The historical evidence would seem to say yes.Balancing profit against cost, it is clear that outright cures are far lessprofitable than exceedingly prolonged and profit-effective “treatments.”Is the honor once laid on the development of wondrous cures to be forevershunned and the cures themselves suppressed willy-nilly by corporate interests?Is compassion for suffering humanity and concern for the elevation of humanliving standards on a worldwide scale no longer a major medical imperative?In the past, medical discoveries were never questioned or resisted. They werealways looked on as absolutes: if a medical cure for disease was found, it wasembraced and implemented with miraculous providence. Not even the most ruthlessfinancier would have dared to interrupt the flow of medical discoveries in pasttimes.When the records are actually examined, we find a staggering disproportion. Howis it that medical research of the nineteenth century, not very well equipped orfunded, provided definitive cures that have become part of the establishedmedical landscape today, while contemporary medical research, better equippedand superfunded, has not produced a single cure of equal social importance inthe last forty years?Medical authorities have stated that “no means has been found by which virusesmay be destroyed.” Recent evaluations of “recaptured” Rife Raytube unitscontradict this statement. Rife treated germs as mechanical systems, notchemical systems. His essential discovery was that vibrations could killpathogens by the flick of a switch. As we have stated earlier, a single suchdevice could be easily tuned to destroy all deathly pathogens. His is the onlydevice that can destroy viruses.UCLA Medical Laboratories, Kalbfeld Lab, Palo Alto Detection Laboratory, and SanDiego Testing Laboratory had all stated that the Rife Raytube System wasabsolutely safe to use. The FDA went out of its way to publish and maintainfederally directed rulings on the Rife Raytube System, refusing to make furtherstatements concerning its historically proven effectiveness and thousands ofcured cancer cases.A great gathering of esteemed colleagues of the medical and research professionscame to honor and support Rife when the entire court affair was over. Friendswho had been too frightened to stand and fight at his side were now smiling,with their drinks elevated. But the man who was asked to stand and receive thehonors saw through the charades.The seer saw the thick shadows that enveloped the professionals and other dinnerguests. Armadas of pathogens were drumming their war drums again. Soon on themarch, they would devastate humanity once more. It seemed that not one of theesteemed guests cared.Rife developed and implemented a revolutionary cure for cancer and otherdiseases, something that no contemporary medical research group had been able todo, nor would be able to do, so great had the powers of suppression become inthat post–World War II era. The cheers and accolades rang on, and standingovations for Rife lasted for more than fifteen minutes. The now frail andghostlike discoverer, however, looked away—far off and away. He was searchingthrough the shadows, searching in his own darkness—for new light.image [images/9781594775093_043.jpg]Figure 4.4. Dr. Royal Raymond Rife at the San Diego Tribute on May 6, 1938"},{"pageContent":"5T. TOWNSEND BROWNTHE SUPPRESSION OF ANTIGRAVITY TECHNOLOGYJeane ManningT. Townsend Brown was jubilant when he returned from France in 1956. Thesoft-spoken scientist had a solid clue that could lead to fuel-less spacetravel. His saucer-shaped discs flew at speeds of up to several hundred milesper hour, with no moving parts. One thing he was certain of—the phenomenonshould be investigated by the best scientific institutions. Surely now thescience establishment would admit that he really had something. Although thetall, lean physicist—handsome, in a gangly way—was a humble man, even shy, heconfidently took his good news to a top-ranking officer he knew in Washington,D.C.“The experiments in Paris proved that the anomalous motion of my disc airfoilswas not all caused by ion wind.” The listener would hear Brown’s every word,because he took his time in getting words out. “They conclusively proved thatthe apparatus works even in high vacuum. Here’s the documentation . . .”Anomalous means “unusual”—a discovery that does not fit into the current box ofacknowledged science. In this case, the anomaly revealed a connection betweenelectricity and gravity.That year Interavia magazine reported that Brown’s discs reached speeds ofseveral hundred miles per hour when charged with several hundred thousand voltsof electricity. A wire running along the leading edge of each disc charged thatside with high positive voltage, and the trailing edge was wired for an oppositecharge. The high voltage ionized air around the disc, and a cloud of positiveions formed ahead of the craft and a cloud of negative ions behind.image [images/9781594775093_044.jpg]Figure 5.1. T. Townsend BrownThe apparatus was pulled along by its self-generated gravity field, like asurfer riding a wave. Fate magazine writer Gaston Burridge in 1958 alsodescribed Brown’s metal discs, some up to thirty inches in diameter by thattime. Because they needed a wire to supply electric charges, the discs weretethered by a wire to a Maypole-like mast. The double-saucer objects circled thepole with a slight humming sound. “In the dark they glow with an eerie lavenderlight.”Instead of congratulations on the French test results, at the Pentagon he againran into closed doors. Even his former classmate from officer candidates school,Admiral Hyman Rickover, discouraged Brown from continuing to explore thedogma-shattering discovery that the force of gravity could be tweaked or evenblanked out by the electrical force.“Townsend, I’m going to do you a favor and tell you, don’t take this work anyfurther. Drop it.”Was this advice given to Brown by a highly placed friend who knew that theUnited States military was already exploring electrogravitics? (Sleuthing byAmerican scientist Dr. Paul LaViolette uncovered a paper trail that led fromBrown’s early work, toward secret research by the military, and eventuallypointed to “black project” aircraft.)1 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt70]HARASSMENTWere the repeated break-ins into Brown’s laboratory meant to discourage him frompursuing his line of research?Brown didn’t quit, although by that time he and his family had spent nearly$250,000 of their own money on research. He had already put in more than thirtyyears seeking scientific explanations for the strange phenomena he witnessed inthe laboratory. He earlier called it electrogravitics, but later in his life,trying to get acknowledgement from establishment scientists, he stopped usingthe word electrogravitics and instead used the more accepted scientificterminology “stress in dielectrics.”No matter what his day job, the obsessed researcher experimented in his homelaboratory in his spare time. Above all he wanted to know, Why is thishappening? He was convinced that the coupling of the two forces—electricity andgravity—could be put to practical use.An arrogant academia ignored his findings. Given the cold-shoulder treatment bythe science establishment, Brown spent family savings and even personal foodmoney on laboratory supplies. Perhaps he would not have had the heart tocontinue his lonely research if he had known in 1956 that nearly thirty moreyears of hard work were ahead of him. He died in 1985 with the frustration ofhaving his findings still unaccepted.The last half of his career involved new twists. Instead of electrogravitics, atthe end of his life he was demonstrating “gravitoelectrics” and“petrovoltaics”—electricity from rocks. Brown’s many patents and findings rangedfrom an electrostatic motor to unusual high-fidelity speakers and electrostaticcooling, to lighter-than-air materials and advanced dielectrics. His name shouldbe recognized by students of science, but instead it has dropped into obscurity.Too late to comfort him, some leading-edge scientists of the mid1990sresurrected Brown’s papers, or what they could find of his papers.EXTRAORDINARY CURIOSITYThomas Townsend Brown was born March 18, 1905, to a prominent Zanesville, Ohio,family. The usual childlike “why?” questions came from young Townsend withextraordinary intensity. For example, his question, “Why do the [high voltage]electric wires sing?” led him later in life to an invention. His discovery ofelectrogravitics, on the other hand, came through an intuition. As a sixteenyear old, Brown had a hunch that the then-famous Coolidge X-ray tube might givea clue to spaceflight technology. His tests, to find a force in the raysthemselves that would move mass, led to a dead end. But in the meantime theobservant experimenter noticed that high voltages applied to the tube itselfcaused a very slight motion.Excited, he worked on increasing the effect. Before he graduated from highschool, he had an instrument he called a gravitator. “Wow,” the teenager mayhave thought. “Antigravity may be possible!” World-changing technologicaldiscoveries start with someone noticing a small effect and then amplifying it.Unsure of what to do next, the next year he started college at CaliforniaInstitute of Technology. Even then his sensitivity was evident, because he sawthe wisdom of going forward cautiously—first gaining respect from his professorsinstead of prematurely bragging about his discovery of a new electricalprinciple. He was respected as a promising student and an excellent laboratoryworker, but when he did tell his teachers about his discovery they were notinterested. He left school and joined the navy.Next he tried Kenyon College in Ohio. Again, no scientist would take hisdiscovery seriously. It went against what the professors had been taught;therefore it could not be.He finally found help at Denison University in Gambier, Ohio. Brown metprofessor of physics and astronomy Paul Alfred Biefeld, Ph.D., who was fromZurich, Switzerland, and had been a classmate of Albert Einstein. Biefeldencouraged Brown to experiment further, and together they developed theprinciple that is known in the unorthodox scientific literature as theBiefeld-Brown effect. It concerned the same notion that the teenager had seen onhis Coolidge tube—a highly charged electrical condenser moves toward itspositive pole and away from its negative pole. Brown’s gravitator measuredweight losses of up to 1 percent.(In 1974 researcher Oliver Nichelson pointed out to Brown that before 1918,Professor Francis E. Nipher of St. Louis discovered gravitational propulsion byelectrically charging lead balls, so the Brown-Biefeld effect could moreproperly be called the Nipher effect. However, Brown deserves credit for hissixty years of experimentation and developing further aspects of the principle.)Brown’s 1929 article for the publication Science and Inventions was titled,bluntly, “How I Control Gravity.” The science establishment still turned itsback. By then he had graduated from the university, married, and was workingunder Biefeld at Swazey Observatory.His career in the early 1930s also included a post at the Naval Research Lab inWashington, D.C., staff physicist for the navy’s International GravityExpedition to the West Indies, physicist for the Johnson-Smithsonian Deep SeaExpedition, soil engineer for a federal agency, and administrator with theFederal Communications Commission.As his country’s war effort escalated, he became a lieutenant in the NavyReserve and moved to Maryland as a materials engineer for the Martin AircraftCompany. Brown was then called into the Navy Bureau of Ships. He worked on howto degauss (erase magnetism from) ships to protect them from magnetic-fusemines, and his magnetic minefield detector saved many sailors’ lives.PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENTThe “Philadelphia Experiment” that Brown may or may not have joined in 1940 isdramatized in a popular movie as a military experiment in which United StatesNavy scientists tried to demagnetize a ship so that it would be invisible toradar. According to the account, the ship and its crew dematerialized andrematerialized—they became invisible and later returned from another dimension.Whatever the Project Invisibility experiment actually was, Brown was probably aninsider as the navy’s officer in charge of magnetic and acoustic mine-sweepingresearch and development. However, later in life, Brown was said to be mute onthe topic of the alleged Philadelphia Experiment, except for brief disclaimers.He told friend and entrepreneur Josh Reynolds of California, who madearrangements for Brown’s experiments in the early 1980s, that the movie and thecontroversial book The Philadelphia Experiment by William L. Moore and CharlesBerlitz were greatly inflated.2 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt71] He apparently didnot elaborate on that comment.Reynolds spoke on a panel discussion at a public conference (dedicated to Brown)in Philadelphia in 1994, along with highly credentialed physicist ElizabethRauscher, Ph.D. Rauscher theorized that the Philadelphia Experiment legend grewout of the fact that certain magnetic fields can in effect “degauss thebrain”—cause temporary memory loss. If the huge electrical coils involved indegaussing a ship were mistuned, the sailors could have felt that they “blinkedout of time and back into time.”Going back to 1942: Brown was made commanding officer of the navy’s radar schoolat Norfolk, Virginia. The next year he collapsed from nervous exhaustion andretired from the navy on doctors’ recommendations. More than his hard workcaused his health to break down; he had suffered years of deeply feltdisappointments because his life’s work—the gravitator—had not been recognizedby scientific institutions that could have investigated it. The finalprecipitating factor for his collapse was an incident involving one of his men.BREAK-IN AT PEARL HARBORAfter he recuperated for six months, Brown’s next job was as a radar consultantwith Lockheed-Vega. He later left the California aircraft corporation, moved toHawaii, and was a consultant at the navy yard at Pearl Harbor. An old friend whowas teaching calculus there had opened some doors, and in 1945 Browndemonstrated his latest flying tethered discs to a top military officer—AdmiralArthur W. Radford, commander in chief for the U.S. Pacific Fleet, who laterbecame joint chief of staff for President Dwight Eisenhower.Brown was treated with respect because of who he was, but again no one signed upto help investigate his discovery. His colleagues in the navy treated it lightlybecause it was anomalous.When he returned to his room after the Pearl Harbor demonstration, however, theroom had been broken into and his notebooks were gone. A day or so later, asReynolds remembers Brown’s account of the incident, “They came to him and said,‘We have your work; you’ll get it back.’ A couple of days later they gave himback his books and said, ‘We’re not interested.’”Why? Brown was given the answer that the effect was a result of ion propulsion,or electric wind, and therefore could not be used in a vacuum such as outerspace. The Earth’s atmosphere can be rich in ions (electrically chargedparticles), but a vacuum is not.He was disgruntled, but not stopped. Later a study funded by a French governmentagency would prove the effect was not caused by “electric wind.” But even beforethat, Brown knew that it would take an electric hurricane to create the liftingforce he saw in his experiments.Project Winterhaven was his own effort to further electrogravitic research. Hebegan the project in 1952 in Cleveland, Ohio. Although he demonstratedtwo-foot-diameter disk-shaped transducers that reached a speed of seventeen feetper second when electrically energized, he was again met with lack of interest.Alone in his enthusiasm, he watched the craft fly in a twenty-foot-diametercircle around a pole. According to the known laws of science, this should not behappening. And he went on to make other spectacular demonstrations.When La Societe Nationale de Construction Aeronautique Sud Quest (SNCASO) inFrance offered him funding, he went to France and built better devices and hadthem properly tested as well. Those tests convinced his backers that it could bea feasible drive system for outer space, he told Reynolds. SNCASO merged withSud Est in 1956 and funding was cut, so Brown had to return to the UnitedStates.Brown was eager to show the French documentation to all those officials who hadraised the wall of indifference in the past. But after his discouraging visit toWashington, D.C., in 1956 and what felt like a put-down from Rickover, heapparently decided, “If the military isn’t interested, the aerospace companiesmight be.”Friends say it did not occur to Brown to ask if the defense industry was alreadyworking on electrogravitics, unknown to him. In 1953 he had flown saucer-shapeddevices three feet in diameter in a demonstration for some air force officialsand men from major aerospace companies. Energized with high voltage, theywhizzed around the fifty-foot-diameter course so fast that the reports of thetest were stamped “classified.”Independent researcher Paul LaViolette, Ph.D., traces the path that theseimpressive results led to—toward the Pentagon, the military hub of the UnitedStates. In the early 1990s LaViolette wrote, “A recently declassified Air Forceintelligence report indicates that by September of 1954 the Pentagon hadlaunched a program to develop a manned antigravity craft of the sort suggestedin Project Winterhaven.”Meanwhile, Brown went practically door-to-door in Los Angeles to try to rousesome interest in his work. One day he returned to his laboratory to find it hadbeen broken into and many of his belongings were missing.CHARACTER ASSASSINATIONThen the nasty rumors started. They were the type of rumors that can discredit aman’s character, upset his wife and children, and overall cause deep distress toa sensitive man.Another tragedy in Brown’s life was the sudden death of his friend and helpfulsupporter Agnew Bahnson, who funded him to do antigravity research anddevelopment beginning in 1957 in North Carolina. Did they make too muchprogress? In 1964 Bahnson, an experienced pilot, mysteriously flew into electricwires and crashed. Bahnson’s heirs dissolved the project.The authors of the book The Philadelphia Experiment wrote that in spite of hisnumerous patents and demonstrations given to governmental and corporate groups,success eluded Brown. “Such interest as he was able to generate seemed to meltaway almost as fast as it developed—almost as if someone . . . was workingagainst him.”Today’s researchers looking at Brown’s life have noticed that he went intosemiretirement sometime in the 1960s. Thomas Valone of Washington, D.C., whocompiled a book on Brown’s work in 1994, speculates that the work was classifiedand Brown was bought off or somehow persuaded to stop promotingelectrogravitics. Valone told the April 1994 meeting in Philadelphia thatLaViolette’s detective work sheds new light on what happened to Brown in the1950s. The speculation of these scientists is that “this project was taken overby the military, worked on for 40 years, and we now have a craft that’s flyingaround.” Valone speculates that Brown was debriefed and told what he could talkabout.From the later 1960s to 1985, Brown turned his attention to other relatedresearch. He mainly did basic research to try to understand strange effects hesaw. As did fellow inventor T. H. Moray, Brown had decided that waves comingfrom outer space are not only detectable on Earth, but they also build up acharge in a properly built device. Instead of making increasingly complexdevices, however, Brown, toward the end of his life (this was in the 1980s), wasgetting a charge—voltage to be exact—out of rocks and sand. It was all in searchfor answers.If his work had been accepted instead of suppressed by seeming disinterest, hewould be known to science students. His work would fill more than one sciencebook; an encyclopedia set could easily be filled with Brown’s experiments anddiscoveries.For example, his childhood fascination with the singing wires led him toinvestigate how to modulate ionized air like that which had carried thehigh-voltage current. Could this be used for high-fidelity sound systems?Eventually he did invent rich-sounding Ion Plasma Speakers, which incidentallyhad a built-in “fac”—a cool breeze of health-enhancing negative ions. Would thisdiscovery have been commercialized if his main interest, electrogravitics, hadnot been suppressed by ignorance or been co-opted?He searched for better dielectrics, endlessly trying new combinations. (Adielectric is any material that opposes the flow of electric current while atthe same time having the ability to store electrical energy.) This search ledhim to study, when working with Bahnson, the lighter-than-air fine sand incertain dry riverbeds that could be used to make advanced materials.The anomalous sands were first discovered by his hero Charles Brush early in thelast century. Brush also found that certain materials fell slower in a vacuumchamber than others. He called it gravitational retardation and said they wereslightly more interactive with gravity. These materials also spontaneouslydemonstrated heat. Brush believed that the “etheric gravitational wave”interacted with some materials more richly than with others. Brush’s findingswere swept under the rug of the science establishment.Brown followed his idol’s lead and did basic research in a number of areas,including gravito-electrics—how neutrinos or gravitons or whatever they are, areconverted into electricity. This led him to conduct experiments in variouslocations, from the ocean to the bottom of the Berkeley mine shaft.When Reynolds became interested in Brown’s work in the last five years of theinventor’s life, Brown was able to do the work he loved the most—petrovoltaics.No one else was putting electrodes on rocks to measure the minute voltages ofelectricity that the rocks somehow soaked up from the cosmos. Brown and Reynoldsmade artificial rocks to see what various materials could do and how long theywould put out a charge.Their efforts in a number of areas led toward what they called a “forever readybattery”—a penny-sized piece of rock that put out a tiny amount of voltageindefinitely because they had learned how to “soup up” the effect. After Browndied, Reynolds carried on the research until funding ran out. He estimated thatit would have taken up to $10 million of advanced molecular engineering researchto take the discovery to another stage of development. The high-power version ofthe battery remains on paper—only theory until developed further.This discovery alone should have put Brown into science history books. In allhis years of experiments with the periodic variations in the strip-chartrecordings of the output from the materials, he found that the patterns had arelationship to the position of the stars. And orientation toward the center ofthe universe seemed to make a difference too. This resulted in furtherunconventional thinking on Brown’s part, which only made him more of an outcastin the world of sanctioned science.While he was coming up with the cosmic findings, the military researchers had adifferent agenda. One of the reports dug up by LaViolette came from a Londonthink tank called Aviation Studies International Ltd. In 1956 the think tankwrote a classified “confidential” survey of work done in electrogravitics.LaViolette says the only original copy of the document, called Report 13, wasfound in the stacks at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base technical library inDayton, Ohio. It is not listed in the library’s computer.Excerpts from Report 13 paint a picture of heavy secrecy. A 1954 segment saysthat the infant science of electrogravitation may have been a field where notonly the methods are secret, but also the ideas themselves are a secret.“Nothing therefore can be discussed freely at the moment.” A further reportpredicted bluntly that electrogravitics, like other advanced sciences, would bedeveloped as a weapon.A couple of months later, another now-declassified Aviation Studies report saidit looked like the Pentagon was ready to sponsor electrogravitic propulsiondevices and that the first disc should be finished by 1960. The reportanticipated that it would take the decade of the ’60s to develop it properly,“even though some combat things might be available ten years from now.” Defensecontractors began to line up, as well as universities who get grants from theU.S. Department of Defense.After he came across Report 13, LaViolette put his knowledge of physics to workand began to piece together a picture of what may have happened in the previousthirty years. It includes “black projects”—work that the military deems to be sotop secret that it is kept strictly under wraps, so much so that even Congressdoes not get reports about its funding.image [images/9781594775093_045.jpg]Figure 5.2.

Their description of the B-2gave LaViolette and others a number of clues about the bomber—softening of thesonic boom as Brown had talked about in the 1950s, a dielectric flying wing, acharged leading edge, ions dumped into the exhaust stream, and other clues. TheB-2 seems to be a culmination of many of Brown’s observations made more thanforty years ago.Brown fought an uphill battle all his adult life, at great cost to himself andto family life. His cause included getting the science of advanced propulsionout into public domain, not hidden behind the Secrecy Act of 1951 and a wall ofclassified documents.

The author passed away on July 29, 2011.I am giving this talk as if it were my last. I join the Earth and her abundantbut dying life in an eleventh-hour appeal to stop the attack on all of us byhuman greed and aggression.Like many of my friends and relatives, I grew up believing in the Americandream. In my first thirty years, spanning the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, Ibelieved that if someone had a better idea to benefit humanity and theenvironment, it would be responsibly researched and implemented with the supportof a benevolent government and corporate system eager to help, to improve thingsfor us all.And so as a youth I jumped at the opportunity to serve as an Eagle Scout, Apolloastronaut, and Cornell professor. I was motivated to contribute my talents tonational and global goals, only faintly aware of the growing human attack on theenvironment.How naive I was. After all these years I realize more than ever that unless wequickly find ways to innovate ourselves out of the mess we have created, theworld will continue to be mismanaged to the point of extinction of our ownspecies and many others. Energy production continues to be controlled bycorporations motivated solely by profit for their shareholders rather than theEarth. As a result, the Earth is becoming irreversibly polluted by theextraction and burning of dirty resources including oil and coal while othernon-contaminating options are ignored or suppressed. We ignore innovation at ourrisk and peril.I am now appealing to those of you with resources to team up with those of uswith specialized knowledge to bring forward commonsense, cooperative, ethical,clean breakthrough technologies—or else our civilization and most of nature aswe know it are doomed.Earlier this year I turned seventy, and my life ever since has been filled withchallenge and opportunity, which also reflects the condition of our world. InAugust alone I lost a sister and suffered a major heart attack that landed me inan intensive care unit in a hospital. This year feels like an initiation intotrue elderhood, with its possibly imminent physical mortality along with aheightened sense of maturity and responsibility.CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITYSince 1940 we have globally increased our energy use five times, our water usefour times, our population three times, and we have more than half depleted ouroil, freshwater, topsoil, and wood resources. I think we can all agree that weare on a disastrous course unless we change our ways.In 2010 alone, we are witnessing Jim Garrison’s “climate shock” of extremeweather events, the biggest oil spill ever, dying oceans and rain forests,melting ice caps and glaciers, increasing military and “security” expenditures,and a corrupt financial system—all controlled by corporations and governmentsthat have yet to demonstrate they really care about the environment.We must change this!I believe technology can change our course dramatically, but we must overcomethe resistance of vested interests so that we can allow technology theopportunity to accomplish this. Over the past twenty years, I have seen numerousdemonstrations of concepts of clean breakthrough energy, water purification, andecosystem restorations that appear to be miraculous, but are in fact very realand practical. Hard as it may be to accept, these miraculous inventions havebeen denied and suppressed by our mainstream culture. We have been silenced bythe tyranny of vested interests.How did we get into this mess in the first place?According to Daniel Quinn in his historically prescient novel Ishmael,civilization originated and became corrupted about ten thousand years ago inwhat was formerly Mesopotamia when agriculture was discovered and organizationsbegan to spread with the seizure of land and the exploitation of resources. Andso began the new culture of the “Takers.” Through his main character, Ishmael,Quinn wrote: “The disaster occurred ten thousand years ago when the people ofthe [emerging] culture said, ‘We’re as wise as the gods and can rule the worldas well as they.’ When they took into their own hands the power of life anddeath over the world, their doom was assured. . . . Takers will never give uptheir tyranny over the world, no matter how bad things get . . . they’ve alwaysbelieved that what they were doing was right—and therefore to be done at anycost whatever. . . . Everyone has to be forced to live like the Takers, becausethe Takers had the one right way.”1 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt72]And thus the indigenous cultures were forced to become the Leavers, as theyretreated from Mother Culture. Most of the original cultures have sadly beenexterminated by the Taker aggressors.More recently, the oil-propelled Industrial Revolution has only exacerbated theaggression. The Industrial Revolution became the Agricultural Revolution onsteroids.Only 150 years ago, oil was discovered, marking a second epochal change in humanhistory. The discovery of oil has led to the great riches of a new industrialcivilization fueled by petroleum, much of which can be found in and within a fewhundred kilometers of Kuwait.This oil-rich land provided the first fertility after the global ice age. Tenmillennia later, it became a principal provider of the abundant energy needed togrow our cities and industries into unimaginably powerful and nowworld-threatening proportions.Through the years, the human hierarchies and empires grew to enormous andunwieldy sizes, and the wealth of the few began to flourish during this pastcentury, in large part from oil drilling and consumption.We now need a third revolution, a sustainable technology solution revolution,and may it begin to thrive once again in the cradle of civilization. Now, in theyear 2010, we sit poised on either the verge of extinction or else on anunprecedented revolution in innovation and consciousness that could just give usthe chance we need for our survival—if this can be ethically, responsibly, andconsciously implemented. Call the new revolution whatever you’d like.I often call the coming paradigm shift a “turquoise revolution,” symbolizing anewly unified and healed Earth with pure oceans, land, and air.2[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt73] Turquoise combines the best of Gunter Pauli’snature-friendly blue economy,3 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt74] the prospects ofbreakthrough clean energy, and the green thinking of the deep ecology movement.Most of us can agree that the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions havecreated both great civilizations and great riches alongside great poverty, theinequalities of which contribute immeasurably to the destruction of our preciousenvironment.We need to undo ten thousand years of tyranny and transform our Taker-dominatedculture into a Giver-dominated culture. But where are the Givers, where can wefind those of us who really care about our future? How can the few Takers with aconscience transform themselves to Givers?The first step in such a process is to let go of our fears and become aware ofthe magnificent things that are possible. When we do that we begin to realizethat there are many innovative solutions available. The problem is that theyseem so elusive. A juggernaut of industrial tyranny is cutting us off from thesesolutions, and the majority of people go along with the charade. Whether it’sour land, water, food, oil, wood, metals, or money, the grab is on.But there’s a missing piece in this puzzle. Those who have correctly pointed outour dilemma almost universally refuse to acknowledge the true possibilities thatlie ahead. The missing piece is that we can uncover the truth about innovativetechnologies and then convince key people to make the wise choice of trulysustainable technologies free of vested interests and promotional biases.Ironically, those of us who should know better—the scientists,environmentalists, political progressives, academics, and media—still join theherd of Takers in not even acknowledging the possibility that our energy couldbe clean, cheap, safe, abundant, and decentralized. So we become unwittingallies with the powerful elite and miss the greatest opportunity we couldpossibly imagine to resolve our dilemma.In a recent published essay [Infinite Energy magazine, September/ October 2010],I urge the scientists, environmentalists, and progressives among us to be amongthe first to embrace the possibility of producing free energy and otherbreakthrough clean technologies. I consider myself a member of all threecommunities, whose critiques are spot-on but whose solutions are too little, toolate. Buckminster Fuller said: “There is only one revolution tolerable to allmen, all societies, all political systems: revolution by design and invention.”So far, I have received little response from my scientific, environmental, andprogressive colleagues to my pleas to consider the possibility of an energysolution revolution. Perhaps now, however, as more and more of us become awareof the environmental devastation wrought by BP’s Gulf of Mexico ecodisaster,Pakistan’s floods, and Russia’s fires, we may reach a tipping point in ourefforts to awaken to deeper solutions.BREAKTHROUGH GREEN INNOVATIONThere’s a lot of talk about green technology solving our climate and otherenvironmental problems. But what is green technology? Is it the water- andfuel-intensive green revolution of monocultures wracked by fertilizers andpesticides? Biofuel plantations that destroy our forests and soil and take foodfrom the mouths of the hungry? Nuclear power, fossil fuel power, and hydropowerplants involving massive grid systems? Geoengineering? Even the seeminglyrenewable but materials-intensive windmill and solar farms producingintermittent electricity and hydrogen to fuel our fleets?My radical viewpoint is that none of the above measures will prove to be nearlyenough to solve our collective dilemma after we factor in the full life-cycleenvironmental costs.To cocreate a truly sustainable future, we will need to design new technologies,especially energy technologies, from the ground up. Fortunately, there existhundreds of proofs of concepts of new energy devices, ranging from energy fromthe vacuum (zero point), cold fusion, and special hydrogen and watertechnologies, and energy from the thermal environment.4[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt75]All these approaches deserve our closest consideration, research, anddevelopment, but sadly the powers-that-be have suppressed these initiativesbecause free energy threatens the continuing viability of existing energyapproaches. Consideration of free energy has been quashed from all discussion,either because of disbelief or fear of disrupting the status quo. “Status quo isa multidimensional tapestry of what has been and will never be again. And is,ipso facto, no longer existent.” Not that we should drop everything we’re doingin the near term to improve efforts toward sustainability. I’m a dedicatedadvocate of small-is-beautiful and the brilliant work of Gunter Pauli, JohnTodd, and others in sustainable biosystems that work with, rather than against,nature. Ongoing research and development of some of these bridge innovationswill become absolutely essential in the choices we need to make.Whether it’s an oil, mining, logging, water, agribusiness, or pharmaceuticalcompany coming into the Amazon or Arctic, a missionary or bank incursion intoindigenous lands, a gringo coming to the South to become a land developer forshort-term profit, the suppression and hijacking of miracle breakthroughs likeauthentic cures for cancer or research on free energy, political or financialmanipulation of vulnerable nations with resources, or a coup d’état,assassination, or military attack, the story is always the same: the Takers runthe show. We’ve been “hoodwinked” says whistleblower-author John Perkins.5[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt76] Almost all of us are unaware of how serious thesituation has become and how ignorant we are of new possibilities.The key to understanding the roots of our destructive way is to understand thepractice of economics. The “dismal science” of Thomas Carlyle has incorporatedarbitrary standards that favor the rich and externalize environmental costs.Under these rules the BP oil explosion in the Gulf of Mexico could be consideredan economic success (more jobs, more profits for some, higher GDP) but notaccounted for as an environmental catastrophe.I am deeply saddened by our unwillingness to halt our predatory environmentaldestruction. I often feel I need an ecopsychologist to plumb the depths of myown grief about what’s happening so quickly to our planet.6[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt77]I often feel angry, depressed, betrayed, guilty, and fearful about what ourspecies is doing to itself and its surroundings—all because of the bankruptvalues of current corporate and political policies. The industrial age iscrashing down all around us, and no publicly understood strategy for our futurepresently exists. Most of us don’t even know it’s happening.But, just as the agricultural age replaced the Neolithic age and the industrialage replaced the agricultural age, another age, perhaps the age of wisdom, isurgently required to replace our current age of greed if we are to survive. Wecannot go on like this or allow the ecocide to continue. It’s time for those ofus who are consciously evolving to take a stand on behalf of life, to say“enough!” and demand real change and action—not in ten or twenty years, but hereand now.Waiting in the wings is a cadre of enlightened, practical visionaries ready tomove forward with countless clean innovations. We should begin to providesanctuary for true innovators so that they can conduct their research anddevelopment in peace and help us cocreate a much better world. These unsungpioneers deserve our financial and emotional support.A change in consciousness has become absolutely necessary. Our greatestobstacles are social and political, not technical. There are many good ideas outthere waiting for their opportunity, ideas that have sometimes been violentlysuppressed at the technology-development stage because of the greed, avarice,and addiction to power of the vested interests. It is time for the many toreceive the benefits of abundant sources of energy rather than the few at theexpense of the many.It’s time to ask how we, as a civilization, can best embrace sustain-abilitywhile minimizing disruptions during the transition period. We all need to becomeeducated about what’s possible and then create teams of passionate ecoscientistsand engineers to fulfill our collective mandate for clean energy, clean water,sustainable agriculture, forestry and oceans, and the protection of the naturalworld and its biodiversity.FIVE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION REVOLUTIONS“Necessity is the mother of invention.” We need new clean technologies to matchthe boldness of our goal to cocreate a truly sustainable future. We can developthem if we just give them a chance. I foresee at least the following revolutionscoming out of the work being proposed at the launch of initiatives like theExemplar Zero Initiative.7 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt78]An Energy Solution RevolutionTime and again, I’ve seen demonstrations of proofs-of-concept of numerousbreakthrough energy technologies, many of which, if properly developed, couldsolve the energy crisis very soon and eliminate most causes of climate changeand rampant pollution.8 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt79] These technologiesinclude: (1) energy from the vacuum extracted by electromagnetic devices(sometimes called zero point, etheric, space, free, over-unity energy), (2) coldfusion or low-temperature nonradioactive nuclear reactions, (3) advancedhydrogen and water chemistries, and (4) energy from the thermal environment.Yet, as a culture, we’ve repeatedly rejected this possibility by not supportingthe research; in fact, this research has been violently suppressed.This situation is the most bizarre conundrum of our time as we continue toneglect even thinking about something that could save us from our collectivefolly. Consciously or unconsciously, the controlling elite are committinggenocide and ecocide, while the rest of us reject the most potent and effectivemeans of preventing these unpardonable acts. We must now demand research,development, and assessments of many technologies in order for us to be able tolaunch a viable program that truly benefits all humanity. According toBuckminster Fuller, “People should think things out fresh and not just acceptconventional terms and the conventional way of doing things.”This new energy program should mirror John Kennedy’s vision to place a man onthe moon. Where are the John Kennedys of today? Perhaps some of you may feel thestirrings in your souls for greatness and bold action that our time requires.Take a moment and imagine a world of free energy—no more extraction and burningof dirty fuels, no more grid systems, vastly reduced air, water, and landpollution, no more murderous trillion-dollar wars for oil. Imagine holding aten-kilowatt power pack in your hand that could power your home or transport youto work. Is this an impossible dream? Actually, from what I’ve seen and learnedover many years, this future is highly likely if we will only give it a chance.Imagine in your daily lives no longer having to pay for an electric or heatingor cooling bill or for “filling ’er up” when you want to drive or fly anywhereor ship anything anywhere. Imagine having unlimited, safe, fresh drinking waterworldwide from the cheap desalination of seawater. Imagine a world without bigpower plants and huge dams but rather an elegant decentralized system ofdistributed power reducing our cost of living by 30 percent or more. Imagineending poverty worldwide from this one revolutionary development—free energy—andthus fulfilling the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals. Again, somewords of wisdom from Buckminster Fuller: “I am glad I have lived long enough tosee this! It is simply wonderful! I hope and pray that you will live long enoughto see the principle upon which this marvelous artifact is based become the newenergy source for all the passengers on Spaceship Earth.”9[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt80]It’s logical that energy companies earning hundreds of millions of dollars a daywould try to maintain their income streams for as long as possible and wring outevery drop of oil before changing course. So it’s up to the most enlightenedleaders of nations and companies as well as the rest of us to awaken to thepossibility of a clean and sustainable future through free energy and otherbreakthrough technologies. We must compel the largest companies and countries tomake ethical and responsible choices that are no longer predicated on industrialself-interest but rather in the interest of life itself. Bucky Fuller again: “Weare not going to be able to operate our Spaceship Earth successfully nor formuch longer unless we see it as a whole spaceship and our fate as common. It hasto be everybody or nobody.”A Water Solution RevolutionWater is the wondrous substance on which we each rely for our survival.Sometimes called the oil of the twenty-first century, water is declining rapidlyin both quantity and quality. Instead of keeping water pure to ensure our healthand the health of the planet, we have treated our bodies and waterways as toxicdumping grounds.Pure water is the bridge to higher consciousness within and around us.10[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt81] Recent research suggests that we can healourselves and our planet through the medium of water (which could be consideredan essential blue element to our green thinking). As hard as it may be for manyof us to imagine, much less believe, researchers, including the late RustrumRoy, Marcel Vogel, William Tiller, Patrick Flanagan, and Masaru Emoto, havedemonstrated that we can purify and energize water, both inside and outsideourselves, through positive intention, visualization, and the vortex science ofViktor Schauberger and others.The wondrous relationship between consciousness and water suggests that we arefar more intimately connected to our world and one another than we ever dreamtof in the old mechanistic paradigm. This is the world we’ve inherited, the worldwe can reinherit in a new way, if we can openly discuss what it will take torestore what we have so badly abused. If we are to achieve the immediate goal ofsustainability, radical innovations in design using nature as a template mustbecome our first priority.A Localized, Sustainable Natural Systems Agriculture/Forestry/Water/Energy/Waste Management/Economics RevolutionSeveral innovations enable us to create true sustainability at a local level inbalance with nature by conserving and reusing water, topsoil, energy, wastemanagement, and ecological construction. These plus increasing the use of rawand organic foods, permaculture, herbal medicine, ecological economics, and thepractice of vegetarian lifestyles all add to a sustainable mix that canstrengthen communities. Ongoing research on the state of the art of thesemethods, independent of fossil fuels and other unsustainable practices, shouldbecome the very foundation for creating locally vibrant communities andbioregions with strength and sovereignty, while contributing to the globalcommons as well.A Biosphere Solution RevolutionWe not only need to sustain our local communities, we must also preserve whatland, water, and air is still intact, and we need to restore damaged ecosystemsworldwide. Research shows that these areas could be brought back into theirformer pristine state with the return of flora, fauna, rich soil, and freshwaterthrough careful planning as applied to the area to be restored.11[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt82] Environmental writer Eugene Linden wrote:Peter Raven, director of the Missouri Botanical Garden, predicts that during thenext three decades man will drive an average of 100 species to extinction everyday. Extinction is part of evolution, but the present rate is at least 1,000times the pace that has prevailed since prehistory.Even the mass extinctions 65 million years ago that killed off the dinosaurs andcountless other species did not significantly affect flowering plants, accordingto Harvard biologist E. O. Wilson. But these plant species are disappearing now,and people, not comets or volcanoes, are the angels of destruction. Moreover,the Earth is suffering the decline of entire ecosystems—the nurseries of newlife forms. For that reason, Wilson deems this crisis the “death of birth.”British ecologist Norman Myers has called it the “greatest single setback tolife’s abundance and diversity since the first flickerings of life almost 4billion years ago.”12 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt83]Restoration of the biosphere is a third mission-critical goal. We will need toleave undeveloped lands alone, use state-of-the art methods in restoring damagedecosystems to their former pristine state, and develop local organicagricultural methods, standards, and certifications that are truly sustainable.We could create an Earth Corps to restore ecosystems and provide jobs to thosewho lose them as a result of the transition to a new culture, the funding forwhich could derive from reduced military budgets and from taxes on pollution.And we could employ Colonel Jim Channon’s vision for a First Earth Battalionthat uses the army to restore the land, the navy to restore the oceans, and theair force to restore the air.Ongoing Protected Research and Development CentersWe will need to have cooperative international networks of innovators and localteams working at protected centers to research, assess, develop, test, andevaluate the long list of sustainable technologies that can replace our toxicmanufacturing waste streams.So, what if some breakthrough technologies don’t work or turn out to havenegative environmental impact? No problem, we just continue researching others.There are literally hundreds of basic ideas and thousands of pathways to achievesuccess. Again quoting Fuller: “There is no such thing as a failed experiment,only experiments with unexpected outcomes. I only learn what to do when I havefailures.” You don’t even have to believe in free energy to embrace itspossibility!That’s what R and D is all about—to invest in many parallel technologies atvarious stages of development in an iterative, integrated effort to guide us tothe best choices based on health and environmental friendliness and not onimmediate profits or promotional biases toward particular systems.New Design ImperativeImagine a decision-making process that places people and the planet beforeprofits and asks if a potential project enhances life, and only if the answer tothat question is yes does the project proceed to evaluate the economics. If itharms people or the environment, it is dead in its tracks. Contrast that withthe normal way of evaluating a project that simply says, “This will makebillions, let’s go!” We live with the many negative consequences of not thinkingabout consequences. A new life-enhancing design imperative must become the norm.I like Buckminster Fuller’s expanded definition of a designer: “A designer is anemerging synthesis of artist, inventor, mechanic, objective economist andevolutionary strategist” and “Design science is more than the application ofengineering and technology. It is more than a plan or a design. Design sciencemeans the total responsibility and capability for development, production, anddistribution—of not just a product—but a total service system on a worldwidebasis.”My experience in the aerospace community has taught me that the first step inany design process is identifying the design requirements. Here I think most ofus agree that the overriding requirement in any significant design for ourfuture is true sustainability.This initiative will need quality teamwork as in the Apollo program. In the longrun, establishing properly managed R and D and technology assessment centerswould lower the risk of prematurely picking technologies that wouldn’t work inthe long run, like internal combustion engines, nuclear power plants, gridsystems, biofuel plantations, huge dams, and other approaches that someday willbecome obsolete.Can we abuse free energy and other breakthroughs like we have abused so manyothers like nuclear energy? Of course, we can. But we don’t have to if we designand implement our systems wisely with true sustainability rather than profit andvested power as our central criterion and focus.Earlier in 2010, seven of us gathered at Montesueños, the conferencebed-and-breakfast retreat center my wife and I built in Ecuador, to help beginthe process. Called the Global Innovation Alliance (GIA), we are beginning tofocus on integrating truly sustainable technologies.The GIA is an international nonprofit network of like-minded, competent, andvisionary innovators inventing, advancing, and integrating sustainabletechnologies to facilitate independence from oil. We are a global organizationseeking truly sustainable, exportable, and scalable solutions at fundamentallevels, free of vested interests.We seek to develop sanctuaries that would support and protect the R and D ofinnovative systems that are self-sustaining in energy, water, waste management,and agriculture, both near-term and longer-term. We are facilitators,integrators, and assessors of misplaced resources, ameliorating existingtechnologies and designing solutions that provide a generous return oninvestment for every passenger on Spaceship Earth.Our mission as described by Buckminster Fuller is “the effective application ofthe principles of science to the conscious design of our total environment inorder to help make the Earth’s finite resources meet the needs of all humanitywithout disrupting the ecological processes of the planet.”The basket of technologies contained in the Exemplar Zero Initiative representsone beginning of what we need to do. They remind us that many cutting-edgeinnovations, of which the vast majority of us may be unaware, can change theworld very soon. I also envision that once developed, these innovations will bejoined by many other technologies that can be integrated and become mature withtime as the R-and-D process and assessments take place.Here I must interject a note of caution. For over one hundred years, since thetime of Nikola Tesla, free energy and other disruptive technologies have beenconsistently and sometimes violently suppressed by a system that favors thepowerful, who gladly support research on weapons and dirty energy. The brilliantscientist-author-inventor David Yurth put the situation this way: “The mostdangerous of all human undertakings is the practice of science without aconscience. If we do not care for all living things on the planet, we cannotpretend to be genuinely motivated to problem solving.”13[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt84]And the converse is also true: the most dangerous of all human undertakings at apersonal level is the practice of science with a conscience. Whether it’s thecorrupt patent system, the unfavorable investment attitudes about putting moneyon the line for perceived “risky” development, inventor naiveté about how thereal world works, the overall ridicule foisted on these initiatives by skepticalbut uninformed scientists, or the theft or burial of the intellectual propertyby large corporations or governments beholden to the status quo, history hasconsistently shown that almost every time a promising but disruptivebreakthrough technology has made progress, the effort has been sabotaged.14[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt85] In the case of free energy technologies, thesuppression has been complete.So any radical, new sustainable technology development will need to have theunanimous, transparent, and cooperative support of new creative partnershipsbetween governments, entrepreneurs, and protected research teams. “Whenindividuals join in a cooperative venture, the power generated far exceeds whatthey could have accomplished acting individually.”Likewise, any aspiring Bill Gates for free energy will need to have his owncontrol and money agendas filtered out of the planning. Huge growth, profits,and wealth should not be a part of our quest. Fuller once again: “I learned veryearly and painfully that you have to decide at the outset whether you are tryingto make money or to make sense, as they are mutually exclusive.”Truly sustainable technology development needs to be shared with the world, andyet the intellectual property of the inventor needs to be protected andrewarded. This blend is a tall order in a capitalistic world where moneyedinterests would like to breed more money—for themselves. Open sourcing,government support, and private donations motivated more by altruism than profitwill need to be the new standard we all should strive for."},{"pageContent":"7POWER FOR THE PEOPLE—FROM WATERJeane ManningWe inhabitants of this planet have made huge mistakes. The good news is that wecould turn the situation around by cooperating—with each other and with the restof the natural world. For perspective, we could begin by viewing the scene froma distance.Earth is a blue jewel in our solar system—the water-rich planet. A closer viewreveals abuse of that priceless water. Oil blackens ocean beaches. Aging barrelsof radioactive waste leak into ground and ocean waters. Coal mining blastsmountaintop springs and water-enlivening forests into oblivion. Hydro damscreate stagnant lakes on previously healthy rivers, and methane mining harmsother streams. Supplies of drinking water shrink, and much of this is caused bythe dominant energy technologies.Wiser beings viewing Earth might wonder, “Will the inhabitants of this planetuse their emerging crises as springboards for cooperative actions? Will theyunite to shift to energy technologies that are in harmony with nature? Will theyemploy the harmonious technologies to restore watersheds, cleanse rivers andoceans, and ultimately create a higher civilization?”It’s possible. Authors in this anthology point out various paths the humanfamily can take toward environmental stewardship and a more caring society. Somecontributors see the need for a new source of energy beyond the standardalternatives. Some find that individual inventors and independent researchgroups around our world have made the breakthroughs that could replace coal,oil, and uranium. This chapter introduces water-related breakthroughs. Theyrange in size from Blue Energy Canada’s hydroturbine tidal-power bridges down tothe injecting of water vapor into a car engine. Some innovations swirl waterinto the form of an inward-spiraling vortex—nature’s choice for anenergy-tapping motion—and some similarly involve imploding bubbles in water torelease powerful energies. A few types of the inventions could clean up pollutedwater at the same time as providing electric power.Humankind knows how to harness fire, wind, sun, and the strongest forces innature. Will the next leap forward use the power of water? That question isposed by the BlackLight Power website (www.blacklightpower.com[http://www.blacklightpower.com]). It describes a novel hydrogen-related energythat’s cheap, abundant, and generates no pollution or greenhouse gases. A videoon the site says our prosperity is limited only by our ambition. We can keep ourworld, oceans, rivers, and the air we breathe clean by using “energy made righthere at home—or anywhere in the world.” This chapter concludes with good newsabout that BlackLight process and about global cooperation among new-energyactivists, but first will look at other water-related discoveries down throughhistory.DAWNING OF THE AGE OF AQUAThe urge to solve humankind’s energy-generating problems is felt by innovatorsaround the planet. Thousands of videos and forums on the Internet share researchand homegrown experiments. Before the Internet and its open sourcing ofknowledge, lone inventors tried to single-handedly save us from our dependenceon dirty fuels. And long before hippies saw the dawning of an Age of Aquarius, afew individuals discovered that water is a key to independence.James Robey of Kentucky compiled a history titled Water Car: How to Turn Waterinto Fuel. It begins with the Swiss-German physician Paracelsus about fivehundred years ago noticing that a flammable gas formed when iron reacted with acertain acid added to water. In his era the pace of discoveries was slow.Centuries passed until an eighteenth-century British scientist had the resourcesand patience to isolate what he called “inflammable air” and prove it is aseparate element. When the gas burned, water formed again. He figured out thatwater is made from two parts of hydrogen and one of oxygen. A British team wasalso first to perform electrolysis of water. They used a new invention, thebattery, passing its electric current through water to produce hydrogen andoxygen, which appear as tiny bubbles rising out of the water.Isaac de Rivaz of Switzerland, first to patent an internal combustion engine,powered his clunky vehicle on hydrogen from water. It took the wrong path; fuelwas not created on demand, but instead hydrogen was dangerously stored in a tankbefore being released by hand into a fiveinch-diameter cylinder and sparked. His1805 car lurched forward fifteen feet every five seconds. There was room forimprovement, but the car’s exhaust was clean.Michael Faraday was a British scientist who said, “Nothing is too wonderful tobe true.” Unfortunately some of today’s experts use his fame dogmatically tojustify a narrower viewpoint. In 1834 Faraday’s experiments proved a certainlimit to the efficiency of electrolysis. The amount of hydrogen and oxygenoutput from Faraday-type electrolysis is a set proportion; nearly fourkilowatt-hours of electricity is needed to produce one cubic meter of hydrogen.Twenty-first-century experts invoke “Faraday’s law” to shut the door on maverickexperimenters’ claims of superefficient electrolysis.Faraday’s formula does hold true for the usual electrolysis experiment using“brute force” direct current. You can’t run a generator on water by burning thehydrogen gas put out by a standard electrolyzer (the apparatus that useselectricity to break apart water). It takes too much electricity to produce thegas, so burning won’t ever produce enough heat to be converted to that muchelectrical energy. Such a system couldn’t power a generator or vehicle. However,not everyone builds things the usual way. And not everyone breaks up water withthe sledgehammer approach of a heavy flow of electrical current. Instead,approaches that require less electricity can be used to separate hydrogen atomsfrom water molecules. Those who are doing “non-Faraday electrolysis” range frombackyard tinkerers to highly educated maverick scientists who may have anunderstanding of atoms that is advanced beyond mainstream science.In 1872 acoustic researcher John Worrell Keely of Philadelphia (please seechapter 2) reportedly demonstrated the use of multiple sound vibrations to breakwater apart. Could a combination of tones from three tuning forks produce musicthat causes hydrogen atoms to dance their way out of the water molecule? Keelysaid he had indeed found the resonant frequency of water. Many of Keely’sdiscoveries, prototypes, and papers disappeared after his death.In Dallas, Texas, more than a century after Faraday, Henry Garrett’s inventionturned water into fuel on demand under a car’s hood. He had previously inventedthe emergency dispatch radio, which he gave to Dallas without cost, and createdhis city’s first automatic traffic signal. Garrett and his son Charles worked ontheir electrolytic carburetor for eight years before Charles patented it in1935. Newspaper articles said it substituted water for gasoline and that Garrettclaimed cooler motor operation, instantaneous starting in any weather,elimination of fire hazards, and full power and speed. Was Garrett a con man, asdebunkers claim? There’s no evidence for that charge, says Robey.Robey dug into Dallas newspapers and other archives and found Garrett to havebeen a gifted technician and upstanding public servant who donated much time andmany of his assets to help others. Robey wonders why the Garretts’ inventionwasn’t used by any car manufacturer or offered as a retrofit device. “Maybe itwas a few local oilmen who convinced them to just drop the thing . . .”Meanwhile in Bolivia, Francisco Pacheco’s fascination with anelectricity-generating fish led him to an invention that produced fuel fromwater efficiently. The U.S. vice president at the time, Henry Wallace, took agoodwill tour of South America, met Pacheco, and saw the potential for hisinvention to replace gasoline diverted to fight World War II. Wallace invitedhim to immigrate, so Pacheco moved to New Jersey. By the time Pacheco consulteda lawyer about patenting his invention, however, Americans were getting amplesupplies of gasoline. Few worried about pollution. Pacheco was advised to wait.Family and job responsibilities took his attention for nearly thirty yearsbefore he began demonstrating how he could power engines and a home with hisdevice. It produced hydrogen as needed—by an interaction of salt water,magnesium, electricity, and carbon. He also ran a boat on seawater. In 1992 hissecond patent described a process that needed no electricity. Despite his manyefforts to get fair publicity and to reach decision makers, his discoveries wereignored.Andrija Puharich was a medical doctor whose technical brilliance led him to alsoearn a Ph.D. in physics and thirty patents on his inventions. After studying thefamed inventor Nikola Tesla’s findings about electrical resonance, Puharichtuned into the resonant frequencies of water molecules to loosen the bondsbetween hydrogen and oxygen. His friends claim he traveled thousands of milesthrough Mexico and the United States in a motor home powered by hydrogen splitfrom water, created on demand in the vehicle. The legend includes a trip througha mountain pass where he melted snow water to fill his fuel tank. Puharich’sbrilliance didn’t settle into a business groove, so his invention didn’t make itto the marketplace. Instead he turned his attention to understanding the natureof consciousness.Puharich and Pacheco are dead, but other inventors continue. In the Philippines,engineer Daniel Dingel says that in the past forty years he has converted morethan a hundred cars to run on water, using seawater as the electrolyticsolution. Textbooks say it is impossible to get a car battery to put out enoughelectrical power to do what Dingle claims to be doing. Skeptics point to slighttraces of carbon found in his car’s exhaust. However the traces don’t prove heis using some hydrocarbon fuel. Instead, that carbon could have arrived in theair intake from smoggy, sooty city air. Old videos show him running a ToyotaCorolla car with his small hydrogen reactor hooked up to its engine. Dingle wastold that his country’s government, deep in debt, could not support his effortsbecause that government has been instructed to avoid competing with the WorldBank’s energy interests—oil.NEW WATER SCIENCE FROM RUSSIAHighly educated but underemployed Russian scientists are often ahead with futurescience despite financial challenges. Philipp Kanarev, Ph.D., a physicist, adistinguished professor, and the head of the Theoretical Mechanics Department atKuban State Agrarian University, has at times done his own experiments withoutthe benefit of basic comforts such as heat in his laboratory. Kanarev writesabout how today’s energy technologies cause ecosystems to deteriorate, but headds that the deterioration can be halted by using water as an energy source.Kanarev says his water plasma electrolysis method is the most efficient way toget cheap hydrogen from water. Unfortunately, his 1987 report about his methodwas kept away from the news media or public scientific journals for yearsafterward; the military-industrial complex in the Soviet Union classified thereport. He focused at that time on using his device for purifying anddisinfecting water. That focus changed after Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmannannounced in 1989 that they had achieved excess energy output during a type ofelectrolysis (see chapter 11, “Cold Fusion,” by Edmund Storms).That “tabletop fusion” announcement renewed research efforts behind the formerIron Curtain as well as in the West. As a result, in 1996 some of Kanarev’scolleagues publicly announced the excess energy output from their plasmaprocess, the next year they applied for a patent, then a full team of Russianscientists tested the device. In recent years it has been measured releasing upto ten times more hydrogen than ordinary electrolysis.Various new-energy inventions mimic aspects of how nature works, in contrast toinsensitive-to-nature old-energy systems. Kanarev observed that the wayhumankind has been creating megawatt or gigawatt energy systems is inefficient;it’s uneconomical to use processes that operate continuously. Instead, hesuggested copying the principle used by “the main natural motor—the heart of theman and the animals.”If a heart operates one-third of the time and rests two-thirds, its pulsationscan be described as an impulse process. Taking that impulse principle intoelectrolysis means employing work-and-rest cycles (pulses) instead of acontinuous flow of electricity. Kanarev and his colleagues found that when watermolecules are shaken apart by electric pulses at frequencies that match thesubstance’s natural resonant frequencies, the atoms’ outermost electrons absorbenergy from the surrounding space—the background energy of the universe. Perhapsthis explains why Kanarev’s “plasma electrolysis” can output ten times morehydrogen than Faraday’s law allows.Kanarev concludes that modern physics and chemistry fail to do electrolysisefficiently because textbooks are based on mistaken ideas about the orbitalmotion of electrons in atoms. He writes new textbooks based on emerging sciencethat goes beyond the mainstream worldview.WATERFALL, HURRICANE, DAM-BLAST FREE ENERGYMeanwhile in the United States another well-credentialed and dignifiedphysicist, Peter Graneau, also authors books about new scientific understandingsand unlimited renewable energy from ordinary water. In an editorial in theMay/June 2010 issue of Infinite Energy magazine, he says the most promisingtechnology of a new clean-energy source is that of liberating hydrogen-bondenergy from ordinary water at its normal temperatures.Graneau’s series of experiments, begun in the 1980s at Massachusetts Instituteof Technology, led to his learning that anomalous energy and force can come fromexploding water.He did experiments described as water arcs, in which a high-voltage electricalspark (like a short piece of lightning) sets up mechanical tension in a columnof water. The stress breaks the liquid into droplets of fog, and the liberatedenergy—previously involved in bonding molecules together—accelerates thedroplets into a powerful explosion, reaching speeds as fast as one thousandmeters per second. From a thimbleful of water, the water explodes with a forcethat cuts neat holes in quarter-inch-thick aluminum plate. More kinetic (motion)energy comes out of the water explosion than was put in through the electricity.Strangely the water does not get hot. It takes far less electricity to liberateabundant energy by breaking water apart that way than it does to heat water tothe boiling point to create steam for driving a turbine.Noting that people must be baffled by why the news media and the U.S. Departmentof Energy are silent about the promising discoveries, Graneau explained that thewall of silence probably rises from a misunderstanding of the basics of waterscience. Chemists know about the bonds between hydrogen molecules in water, butdon’t yet know that the bonds can be ruptured with mechanical tension, veryefficiently, and that the freed bond energy can be captured in various ways.Graneau said, “We are very familiar with thermochemistry and electrochemistry,but mechanical chemistry is new to most of us.”Could the water arc be scaled up to a size that would rival the output ofnuclear or coal-burning power stations? Perhaps not easily; Graneau figured thatdesigning a multitude of electric-arc accelerators to power a gigawatt electricpower generating station is too complex, so he looked for a more practical wayto free the internal energy in water. He looked to nature—water breaking apartas it hits rocks on the bottom of a waterfall. Something anomalous happens thereto accelerate a film of water.Searching the scientific literature, he found no insight on what happens tohydrogen bonds when water crashes onto a hard surface, changes direction ninetydegrees, and speeds outward along the surface increasingly faster. Whatevercauses that acceleration could point toward a more continuous and massiverupture of hydrogen bonds, Graneau realized. Drag forces could be breaking thebonds in water as it flows radially from the waterfall impact, just as thoseforces do in a hurricane when it contacts the ocean surface and released energyself-intensifies the hurricane. A similar release may be accelerating the flowsideways from under waterfalls.Graneau then realized that an innovative turbine system that breaks bondsbetween water molecules as well as converts the energy of falling water intoelectricity would be simpler to design than scaled-up water-arc technology.Other scientists would also have to do and share experiments about what happenswhen a fall of water hits a horizontal surface and sideways expansion of a thinlayer of water accelerates. The data could be put to significant use. Graneauenvisions that the power of that acceleration could be gathered by blowing itinto a spiral blade structure of an innovatively shaped surrounding turbine. Asmall model of what Graneau calls a “spider turbine” was photographed for anearlier issue of Infinite Energy.In the same May/June 2010 issue of Infinite Energy as Graneau’s editorial,mechanical engineering expert Farzan Amini in Iran revealed other aspects of thepower of water—pulsating helical vortex action in water and low-energy nuclearreactions (LENR, previously called cold fusion). To imagine what a helicalvortex looks like, think of the DNA double-helix spiral. Amini’s conclusions arereinforced by his analysis of a 2009 explosion at a hydroelectric plant inRussia. The blast resulted from hydrogen bonds having been broken, freeinghydrogen, which ignited. Multiple miniature explosions could have been ignitedby friction or by hydrogen contacting a violent plasma jet or an electric field.Explosive forces were more energetic than could be handled by a defectiveturbine whose bolts were loosening. The spinning turbine rose up and destroyedmachinery while pressurized falling water continued to flood the room.Why should we nontechnical people care what caused an explosion that broughtdown a hydroelectric plant’s turbine hall ceiling? The answer has to do with thepotential for a better way to generate electricity, because a gigantic increasein the amount of energy occurred accidentally in one of that dam’s 156-tonturbines. If such forces were deliberately created and harnessed safely in powergenerating stations, there would be no excuse for building coal-burning powerstations—or eight-hundred-foot-high dams.The forces could be harnessed without destroying things. The Sayano-Shushenskayaexplosion in Russia (referenced above) involved vibration of faulty equipmentresulting in resonance that amplified the vortex power and pulsations beingcreated in swirling water. Jets of hydrogen plasma were then created, electronscaptured, and hydrogen bonds broken. Engineers try to avoid these conditions,but Amini says hydro turbines can act as a reactor for the vorticity and LENRprocess. Being a respectable engineer, he avoids speculating on what dramaticenergy abundance would mean for people’s lives.On a smaller scale, an engineer in the United States learned how toconstructively harness a destructive force—the “water hammer” of common oldhousehold plumbing. Shock waves cause pipes to loudly rattle and knock whenpressure inside suddenly changes. Industrial heating engineer James Griggsgrasped such a pipe one day, felt the significant heat, and realized that theproblem could be a solution—a new source of power. He developed, inside a metaldrum, a rotating device whose indentations created shock waves that releasedheat into the churning liquid. The heat released represented at least 30 percentmore energy than was used to electrically rotate the apparatus. It’s not enoughto make sufficient steam for turbines that make electricity, but enough to fireup the skeptics. They can’t argue with success, however. The Hydrosonic Pump issold as industrial-sized boilers that don’t require any fuel to be burned inorder to make steam or to heat liquids. Around the city of Atlanta, Georgia,public buildings have been using the device to save about a third of theirheating costs. Customers include a fire station, a dry cleaning plant, agymnasium, and the Atlanta Police Department.Skeptics cite the physics law of conservation of energy, which says you alwayshave to lose energy and can’t gain more than you put into something. That lawwas written when the steam engine was first studied. It is always valid in aclosed system in which every input can be measured, but what if the implodingbubbles in Griggs’s and other people’s inventions are tapping into thebackground energy of the universe? Kanarev, for instance, told me that hisplasma electrolysis system seems to involve input from what was once called theaether. Flawed experiments early in the twentieth century were cited byphysicists as disproving the existence of such a nonmaterial field, butdissident scientists, including Tesla, have shown evidence of it all along,although not in the static form that the nineteenth century worldview described.Back in the former Soviet Union other scientists have looked at vortex processesand imploding bubbles as a better way to generate electricity. The late A. I.Koldamasov’s device vibrates a mix of waters through a special material toproduce heat energy in more abundance than the energy that powers theoscillator. The device was reported to put out forty kilowatts of heat energywith only two kilowatts of electrical input.Vladimir Vysdotskii, a scientist with Kiev National Shevchenko University in theUkraine, and colleagues are continuing with a similar invention involving thecavitation (violent caving-in or implosion) of tiny bubbles formed infast-moving jets of water. He sees it as one of the possible ways to develop newenergy technology.The most passionate pioneer of vortex power was Austrian forester ViktorSchauberger (see chapter 3, “Viktor Schauberger” by Callum Coats). He used hisknowledge of nature’s energy-gathering movements and built environmentallyfriendly energy machines. Throughout his life Schauberger was an extraordinarilykeen observer of water’s ways in pristine ecosystems. Watching a babblingmountain stream, for instance, he noticed that each time it encounters a rockthe water whirls and draws in air. The water breathes. In the spiraling ofwater, he recognized a basic movement of nature. He also noticed how turbulenceplays its role in what becomes a pattern of natural self-organization—a stable,pulsating structure of water can be created out of swirling chaos. InSchauberger’s view, Nature is there for us to understand and then copy.Schauberger built technical devices aimed at imitating those spinning movementsof water that create special results. He built special twisted pipes thatencouraged water or air to swirl and accelerate from suction, not rely onpressure. He made a home-appliance-sized power converter using vortex power.Today’s experimenters find it very difficult to reproduce his power generator.His grandson Jorg Schauberger advises researchers to develop their own ideas fora future of working with nature. The Schauberger message is “C2 —Comprehend andCopy Nature.”Today’s dominant energy technologies do everything the wrong way, according toSchauberger’s view. Instead of nature’s creative motions—inward-spiraling,implosion- or suction-based, quiet, cooling, self-organizing vortices—the energytechnologies that rule the world use pressure, explosions, heating, or burningand involve noise resulting from friction. No wonder people believe thattechnologies always create problems. They might consider that the type oftechnologies creates such messes and that visionaries such as Schaubergerpointed in a different direction.MORE WATER-AS-FUEL HEROESAs with Garrett and Puharich, Stanley Meyer was an American who drove avehicle—in his case a modified dune buggy—running on water alone. He usedhydrogen jolted out of water with the aid of resonance and a complex of relateddiscoveries such as how to fracture hydrogen gas by ionization. Meyer said hisprocess made the gas become very powerful, so a reduced amount could do morework than hydrogen from traditional electrolysis. This fits with otherresearchers’ claims of beneficially enriching the gas with electrons.To many clean-energy researchers around the world Meyer is a hero, but tojubilant skeptics he was declared a fraud after a court ruling in 1996. Thiswriter knew Meyer, however, and knew that what Meyer told the court was true ashe saw it and that he could have lost his opportunity to patent parts of hisinvention if he revealed its secrets to the court. The patent office was at thetime investigating his technology, as were the U.S. Department of Energy and hiscountry’s military. Also, court-appointed expert witnesses who declared that hisinvention couldn’t work may have well been experts in standard electrolysis, butnot experts in what he was actually doing.Meyer carried on his work even after the court ruling. Two years later he was ata restaurant celebrating a promise of funding when he jumped up from the table,rushed outside declaring that he had been poisoned, and died in the parking lot.More recently, television station engineer John Kanzius learned how to use radiofrequencies to release a combustible fuel from salt water. Henry Garrett, Meyer,Kanzius, and others had no qualms about violating Faraday’s laws. Now they havejoined Faraday by having left this physical realm and could be exchangingknowledge in an inventors’ heaven. The Stan Meyer whom I knew would be tellingFaraday, “You’re a genius, Mike, but you didn’t have the benefit of modernelectronics. If you had had my voltage-intensifier circuit, society would’vebeen running cars and generators on water long ago.”If Faraday were alive today, would he tell experimenters that their results aretoo good to be true and that they should give up trying? With his enthusiasm fordiscovery, it is likely Faraday instead would join the twenty-first-centurymaverick engineers who are producing hydrogen gases seven or ten times moreefficiently than his nineteenth-century experiments predicted. The emergingscience of super-efficient electrolysis promises a clean fuel produced at thepoint and time where it is needed. One of the leaders of the hydrogen-from-waterexperimenters’ movement, Bob Boyce, says, “Water can be transformed into aperfect energy carrier. It is abundant, non-polluting and is eternal in nature.. . . After using it to gain a benefit of increased combustion efficiency andreduced emissions, we release it as clean water vapor where it will be recycledby nature. Hard to beat!”OPEN SOURCINGBoyce generously shared the technical how-to details of his own water-as-fueladventures and helped other hobbyists on the Internet. That type of sharing,called open sourcing, is becoming widespread. George Wiseman in western Canadawas an early adopter of a “no-patent policy.” Instead of patenting hisfuel-efficiency discoveries, he wrote how-to books. Buyers of his books weregrateful and corresponded with him about their own experiences with hisinventions. The next version of each of Wiseman’s books contains updatedinformation, and the devices are improved as a result of his readers’ feedback.Boyce’s story illustrates why some new-energy researchers become suspicious ofthe business-as-usual approach. He had worked in broadcast engineering and otherelectronics, so when he lived in southern Florida he opened an electronicsbusiness with a machine shop behind it. There he worked on racing boat enginesand did jobs for local minisub researchers who were building drone boats for thegovernment. In 1988, his business began sponsoring a small-boat race team, whichled him to experimenting with running the boats on hydrogen. Boyce wasseparating the hydrogen from water “on the fly”—on demand in the boat asneeded—but he had never heard of Puharich, Meyer, or any other of hispredecessors. At first he built fairly conventional electrolyzers. They wereinefficient, but electricity consumption wasn’t a big problem since races wereover quickly and batteries recharged.His anomalous breakthrough was an accident. While his two boats were in racingevents, a strange coincidence caught his attention. One of his boats would leapforward with unprecedented thrust whenever its engine ran in a certainrevolutions-per-minute (rpm) range. The burst of power was as if a turbochargerhad kicked in. Boyce began monitoring the boat’s electrical system and noticedthat at those engine speeds a particular electrical waveform always appeared onthe monitoring equipment. Later, he learned that the waveform was caused byelectrical shorting within the boat engine’s alternator.Boat racers welcome a burst of horsepower from an engine, if they know how tocontrol it. Boyce learned that at a specific frequency range the electrolyzersuddenly bubbled out an overpowering amount of hydrogen gas. But how could herecreate that strange and beneficial result in other electrolyzers and at allengine speeds—and reliably? This mystery intrigued Boyce so much that he becamemore interested in research than racing.Eventually he learned that recreating the effect didn’t require a faultyalternator. Instead, he could artificially induce the specific waveform. Withsignal generators, audio transformers, and amplifiers imitating that electricalsignal, Boyce made test systems to reproduce the excess-hydrogen effect. Thesuperimposed electrical frequencies seemed to cause the resonance effect inwater molecules. Boyce began to understand why hydrogen and oxygen had separatedeasily whenever that waveform showed up on a scope.RESONANCE UNLOCKS WATER MOLECULESResonance is well known to musicians. When a musical instrument makes a tone ata certain frequency of vibrations, an instrument across the room picks up thevibration if one of its strings is tuned to that pitch. Another analogy forresonance is pushing a child on a swing. Small pushes, correctly timed,gradually result in impressive swinging. Similarly, sound vibrations or tinypulses of voltage, if timed correctly, could do more work than comparativelymassive amounts of electricity.Because resonance can tear something apart, long columns of soldiers marchingover a bridge break step so materials in the bridge don’t resonate with theirrhythmic steps and begin to fall apart. At an atomic level, when a substance isshaken rhythmically at a frequency that entrains its atomic structure, theresonating movements build up, and bonds between atoms may be more likely tobreak apart. Making use of resonance is one way that water-as-fuel experimentshave moved beyond Faraday’s electrolysis.Another question Boyce encountered had to do with the type of hydrogen beingreleased from water in his experiments. The common form of hydrogen is calleddiatomic—two atoms bound together. It seemed that an abundance of the formcalled monoatomic—singleatom hydrogen—was involved after he began makingelectrolytic cells with special geometries and roughing the steel plates tocreate more surface area.Unknown to Boyce, there were similarities between the boxed arrays of parallelstainless steel squares he was putting together and what a scientist namedWilliam Rhodes had patented. Also unknown to Boyce, a Bulgarian immigrant inAustralia, Yull Brown, had learned that similar apparatus did indeed release aspecial mix of gases.Even without resonance effects, Boyce could double the output efficiency thatFaraday had declared as the limit. What was in the special mixture? Boycediscovered that with the right frequencies, his electrolyzer could generatemonoatomic as well as normal hydrogen and oxygen. When those unusual single-atomforms of hydrogen and oxygen recombined, they produced about four times theenergy output of normal hydrogen and oxygen molecules. The output was stimulatedinto even higher efficiency by the multiple harmonic resonances that helped“tickle” water molecules apart. Boyce described the process as anelectrochemical reaction, but the mixture of gases held even more mysteries thanhe knew at the time.With an old Chrysler automobile hoisted on a jack stand in his shop, Boyce begantesting how well a car engine ran on his hydrogen mixture. He knew how muchhorsepower was put out by the engine when standard processes created hydrogengas, and now he was quadrupling its energy output. The strange gas mixturecontaining mono-atomic hydrogen behaves like hydrogen, he learned, but it alsobehaves better. It apparently contains more energy.CRIMINALS HALT PROGRESSBoyce hadn’t tried to market his breakthrough, but troubles began for him afterhe converted the Chrysler to run on hydrogen. He never had the chance to roadtest the system, because suddenly his shop became a target for criminals whobroke into the building. They only vandalized or stole equipment related to thehydrogen project. The thieves took his electronics control unit and smashed thehydrolysis chamber containing the steel plates.Boyce rebuilt a Plexiglas box and replaced the stolen electronics. However, henever finished the second unit for his engine because his shop was broken intoagain. Thieves stole his second prototype and an inverter he had modified. Theysmashed the last remaining Plexiglas box on his bench. Boyce gave up.Walking away from the investment of time and money was wrenching. He had spentmany thousands of dollars on materials and machining. Boyce later suspected thatone of his hired workers might have leaked information to someone who then triedto either steal the technology or stop Boyce from working on it. He convertedthe boat engines back to using ordinary racing fuel and sold his race boats. Ina final break-in, no damage was done inside his shop; apparently the criminalscould see he was no longer experimenting with water as fuel. Boyce retired in1991.Eventually Boyce learned that what he had stumbled on had already beendiscovered and was known as Brown’s gas, HHO, or hydroxyl. Ruggero Santilli hasa related gaseous fuel he calls magnegas. The process of making it can result inthe cleanup of sewage waters and liquid industrial wastes.Many experimenters want to learn how to run a car solely on water, and they tryto replicate Meyer’s invention. Some others are using plans given out by PaulPantone and injecting water vapor into lawn mower engines. A few mavericks aretweaking those instructions in order to run a stationary electric generator onwater. The largest of such international subcultures of experimenters is the“hydroxy booster” community, perhaps because the project looks easier than acompletely water-powered engine. Hydroxy gas is a nickname for oxyhydrogen, atwo-to-one mix of hydrogen and oxygen gases produced from the electrolysis ofwater. The hydroxy experimenters’ usual priority is to boost miles-per-gallonfor a car, truck, or motorcycle. Improving exhaust emissions happens at the sametime.RHODES’S, BROWN’S, OR HYDROXY GASRhodes was first to patent a process for making oxyhydrogen, but Brown was firstto point out its unusual properties. As a result, the name Brown’s gas is widelyused. Progressing further in understanding the gas, Wiseman gives talks aboutelectrically expanded water. Companies such as his Eagle Research sell equipmentand the plans for making electrolyzers.Builders of hydroxy boosters have up to now been outsiders. Their credibilitywas shredded when a television documentary exposed the peddling of an overhypedelectrolysis system and the public received the impression that the entire fieldof endeavor was fraudulent. On a separate television program, an entertainingduo ridiculed the field by humorously demonstrating a poorly built electrolysisunit. The televised gadget even lacked safety features such as theflashback-arresting bubbler that responsible builders include when they build aunit. The unspoken take-away message: “Hydroxy boosters are unsafe, ineffective,and a joke.”However, neither program contacted any of the many builders of successfulprojects. Meanwhile the builders report hydroxy boosters producing as much assixteen liters of nonpolluting gas per hour, using a fraction of the electricitythat science books say is needed.If the experimenters are indeed running engines on hydrogen or boosting mileagewith hydrogen, something impossible is happening. Some of the hydroxy boosteroutputs are said to exceed Faraday’s limit by seven, ten, and even a hundredtimes. Who is correct?Science writer Moray King stands in the middle of the controversy and declaresthat both sides are talking past each other. He says each is speaking about adifferent reality. * Skeptics are correct in citing Faraday and the laws of thermodynamics. * At the same time, hydroxy booster builders and replicators of Meyer’s water fuel cell are correct in citing the excess power output that they see. * Neither side is fully correct. Neither should be talking about power from hydrogen because, surprisingly, hydrogen is not the source of excess power in these inventions, King says.King, author of Tapping the Zero-Point Energy and other books, backs up hisconclusions with hundreds of references to peer-reviewed science journals. Heconcludes that “charged water clusters” are responsible for the anomalousresults and possibly for tapping into the background energy of the universe.Meyer once told me the background energy surrounding and permeating us—whetherit’s called aether or zero point energy—was the ultimate source of the excesspower converted by his own invention.The hydroxy community wants academics to research their field. They welcomedChris Eckman, an Idaho State University graduate student of nuclear engineering,when he stepped outside academia one summer weekend to attend an ExtraOrdinaryTechnology Conference in Utah. There he heard differing definitions of Brown’sgas, so he returned to school and analyzed and experimented with the mysteriousgas for two years. He shared his results with the next such conference—as aspeaker at the age of twenty-four. Eckman’s surprising findings included thefinding that Brown’s gas is not made of hydrogen—whether single-atom or two-atommolecules. Instead it is a gaseous form of water with excess electrons.It’s time to solve these water-related mysteries—for clean energy technologies.Working outside of military research facilities and corporate laboratories thatdon’t intend to freely share their discoveries with the peoples of the world,those who are developing the most potentially world-changing energy science areoften self-funded. To buy electronic parts, materials, and machining, theseindividuals may spend their savings and sink into credit card debt, then borrowfrom family and friends. Just as the personal-computer revolution began ingarage workshops, much of the energy revolution is homegrown. At this time alarge part of it is a grassroots movement, seeded by shared ideas and spreadingover the Internet. Venture capitalists are willing to step in when an inventionhas gone through all the prototype stages to the completion and certifiedtesting of a commercial product, but are not willing to fund theresearch-and-development stages.ORDINARY WATER, “GREATER THAN FIRE”There are exceptions to that widespread picture of inventors who lack fundingand a team of scientists to further develop their energy breakthroughs. Dr.Randell Mills of Princeton, New Jersey, stands out as exceptional. He has amedical degree from Harvard University and studied electrical engineering atMassachusetts Institute of Technology. Mills and his colleagues have had morethan eighty peer-reviewed science papers published about his new chemicalprocess that releases energy from hydrogen atoms without combustion and withoutany harmful radiation.As this is written, Mills’s company, BlackLight Power Inc., has signed anothercommercial agreement, this time licensing an Italian energy provider to use theBlackLight process to make heat. That abundant heat can be turned intoelectricity. Mills has a further invention that bypasses the heat phase; theprocess goes directly to electricity.BlackLight Power’s tag line is “Greater than Fire.” The company says its newenergy source means efficient generators of electricity could be built in anysize. The power density of the process competes with that of coal and nuclearfission, so the company says its energy source, when in the future placed intobuyers’ hands by licensees, can be used for affordable heating and electricitygeneration and in powering vehicles.How did he leap from inventing for the medical field to saving the world fromfuel pollution? Mathematics was the bridge; Mills developed his own unifiedphysics theory. To test his theory’s predictions, he experimented with ordinarywater and a catalyst. Water is made of molecules that each bind an oxygen atomwith two hydrogen atoms. His theory predicted that a hydrogen atom’s electronorbit could be tightened, forming a smaller atom that he calls a “hydrino.”(Other private laboratories more recently getting similar results call theirprocess “fractional hydrogen” and seek other theories to explain it.)Although Mills’ theory is controversial, his experiments are successful and havebeen replicated by independent laboratories. A Rowan University team found thathis heated-hydrogen-and-catalyst reaction produces far more heat than theirchemists can account for with standard chemistry.By-products of the BlackLight process are: * Novel hydrogen compounds that are being made into useful new materials. Perhaps such discoveries will prevent the need for mining certain metals from the Earth. * A stable hydrino gas. Highly buoyant, it floats harmlessly up through the atmosphere to space if released.Since the process releases about two hundred times more energy than comes fromburning an equal amount of hydrogen gas, very little water is needed to providethe hydrogen. The company says only one-millionth of a liter of water per secondis needed per kilowatt of electric power. This means the system may beself-contained except for replacing the hydrogen consumed to make hydrinos.DIRECT-TO-ELECTRICITY IS GAME-CHANGINGThe company’s new way to develop power by the reaction of hydrogen to formhydrinos is more efficient and cost effective. BlackLight’s technology, calledCatalyst-Induced-Hydrino-Transition (CIHT), is a unique electrochemical cellthat goes directly to electricity. Capital costs are projected to be only abouttwo percent of the cost of building conventional power systems. Fossil fuel andnuclear power plants rely on generating heat to create steam that turnsturbines. The new electrochemical cell is described as suitable for generatingpower at any scale—small appliance to large power plant. Mills pictures aconcept electric car whose drive train would be powered by an onboard processwithout turbines or heat engines.Instead of the expensive standard version of a hydrogen economy—one thatrequires government subsidies—will we instead enjoy a low-impactfractional-hydrogen economy? Mills’s invention if brought to market would makehydrogen pipelines, fueling stations, and storage tanks obsolete. BlackLightPower products and other emerging inventions also eliminate the need for costlyhydrogen fuel cells.The financial weight and political power of the dominant energy industriesdiscourage some energy innovators but haven’t stopped Mills. Inventors hearstories about opposition to some energy innovators’ efforts. Mills however doesnot report having suffered the physical harassment that some inventors haveendured. Opposition came instead in the form of public ridicule from a sectorthat relies on government grants. For instance, one physicist connected to thehot-fusion research establishment declared that science already knows everythingabout the hydrogen atom. Mills didn’t waste his time arguing with such critics.More seriously, however, at a point when patenting was crucial to gettinginvestors there was evidence of behind-the-scenes interference with Mills’spatent application.The inventive doctor found ways to get money for his energy research. SinceMills’s mathematics solves equations for figuring out the physical structure ofelectrons in atoms and molecules, a subsidiary of BlackLight is selling aseparate product that does not threaten the energy establishment. Biological andindustrial scientists buy the company’s software product to map properties ofvarious metals and chemicals.Meanwhile, BlackLight Power plans to license its heat-producing energy process.Licensees might retrofit existing power plants or hire architects, engineeringfirms, and equipment manufacturers to build large or small power plants.WHERE CAN THE HUMAN FAMILY GO WITH THIS?There are more breakthrough water-and-energy technologies than one chapter cancover. For instance, cleaning up polluted rivers can be done by a ready-to-useVapor Condensation Distillation unit developed by a California man, StephanSears. His company’s plans include solving water problems in undevelopedcountries where groundwater, rivers, lakes, or wells have been polluted.Technically it would be easy—combining the unit with a small photovoltaic (solarcell) panel, small windmill, or a run-of-the-river turbine that generateselectricity. Only a small fraction of the electricity is needed to run the waterdistillation process; the unit uses very little power because it recycles itsheat and has other exceptionally efficient features.Many of the researchers look for grassroots support as the way to get theirinnovations into the marketplace. The people of Earth are a superpowerthemselves, if united.The alternative to worldwide cooperation is grim—segments of the human familyeach allowing their national leaders to use the fact of water shortages tojustify continued warring over scarce resources. The public can insist on theseoutside-the-box breakthroughs. Currently government agencies buy onlypolitically safe research—lesser advances that don’t really threaten the oilindustry. The public could be asking, “Why do we allow technicians to dig anddrill into our planet for black fuels? Don’t they know what can be done withjust a bucket of precious water? They could be powering or heating whatever isneeded, without burning anything.”THE GATEWAY TO INFINITE ENERGYA new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and makingthem see the light, but rather because its opponents die, and a new generationgrows up that is familiar with it.MAX PLANCKElectric power is everywhere present in unlimited quantities and can drive theworld’s machinery without the need of coal, oil, gas, or any other of the commonfuels.NIKOLA TESLAFollowing the decimation of Tesla around the turn of the century, similartactics have continued against follow-on inventors who discovered overunitysystems and attempted to complete them and bring them to market. The suppressioncontinues to this day, as can be attested by several living overunity inventorsand inventor groups. For more than a century there has indeed been a giant,unwritten conspiracy of some of the most powerful cartels on Earth, to continuethe curtailment of the electrical engineering model and practice, and tocontinue to suppress overunity inventions and inventors.More than a century ago and along with its very birthing, our “modern” classicalelectrodynamics and electrical engineering science was deliberately mutilatedand crippled, specifically so that COP > 1.0 and self-powering electricalsystems—asymmetrically powering loads extracted from “ free EM wind energyflows” from the vacuum/space itself—would never be known or developed by ourelectrical engineers. . . . It has directly prevented struggling nations havingno oil or gas resources from achieving a modern economy (which is based on cheapenergy). This has left those nations impoverished, with their peoples starvingand miserable and disease-wracked. Hundreds of millions of deaths fromstarvation and disease have resulted worldwide. It has “welded into our mindsand our very brains” the mistaken notion that—other than a wee bit of windpower, water power, and solar power—we can only have “energy from consumption offuel.”Our electrical engineers and scientists today are totally unaware that everygenerator already pours out more than a trillion times as much EM energy flowfrom the vacuum, as is in the mechanical energy flow we input to the generatorshaft.THOMAS E. BEARDENThe release of the energy of the atom is as yet in an extremely embryonic stage;humanity little knows the extent or the nature of the energies which have beentapped and released. There are many types of atoms, constituting the “worldsubstance”; each can release its own type of force; this is one of the secretswhich the new age will in time reveal. . . . I would call your attention to thewords, “the liberation of energy.” It is liberation which is the keynote of thenew era, just as it has ever been the keynote of the spiritually orientedaspirant. . . . This liberating energy will usher in the new civilization, thenew and better world and the finer, more spiritual conditions. The highestdreams of those who love their fellowmen can become practical possibilitiesthrough the right use of this liberated energy, if the real values are taught,emphasized and applied to daily living.DJWHAL KHUL"},{"pageContent":"8IMAGINE A FREE-ENERGY FUTURE FOR ALL OF HUMANITYSteven M. Greer, M.D. At no time, when the astronauts were in space were they alone: there was aconstant surveillance by UFOs.SCOTT CARPENTER, U.S. ASTRONAUTTHE FOURTH MAN IN SPACEIn the councils of Government, we must guard against the acquisition ofunwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the Military IndustrialComplex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, andwill persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger ourliberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only analert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the hugeindustrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goalsso that security and liberty may prosper together.PRESIDENT DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, 1961image [images/9781594775093_04.jpg]Technological progress in the areas of advanced physics and electromagneticsystems, if appropriately supported, will enable humanity to live on the Earthwith a minimal footprint with genuine long-term sustain-ability. For over onehundred years, these advanced concepts in energy generation have either beenignored or actively suppressed due to the power of fossil-fuel-based economicand industrial interests.Imagine a world where every home and village has its own clean source ofelectrical energy, free from the cost of fossil fuels, nuclear power, or acentralized electric grid. Imagine every means of transportation running off ofclean power plants, using no source of fuel and creating no pollution.Imagine the developing world blossoming with these new technologies and theequatorial rain forests protected from slash-and-burn subsistence farming andlogging.Imagine all intercity transportation moving above the ground and the millions ofacres now paved over with highways freed for productive agriculture andrecreation.Imagine all manufacturing being clean-fuel sourced, using no-cost or low-costenergy.Imagine the possibility of 100 percent recycling because the energy cost oftransporting recycled materials, processing them, and scrubbing pollution out ofthe air and water approaches zero.Make no mistake, the changes would be immense. Yet we have these technologiestoday, hidden away in ultrasecret military-industrial programs, paid for by thetaxpayers, yet of which the public knows nothing. What ethic can justify suchsecrecy in today’s world?To understand where we are going we need to take a look at the history of “freeenergy.”OUR COSMIC NEIGHBORHOODFor most people, the question of whether or not we are alone in the universe isa mere philosophical musing—something of academic interest but of no practicalimportance. Even evidence that we are currently being visited by nonhumanadvanced life-forms seems to many to be an irrelevancy in a world of globalwarming, crushing poverty, and the threat of war. In the face of real challengesto the long-term human future, the question of UFOs, extraterrestrials, andsecret government projects is a mere sideshow, right? Wrong! Catastrophicallywrong.The evidence and testimony presented in the following pages establishes thefollowing: * That we are indeed being visited by advanced extraterrestrial civilizations and have been for some time * That this is the most classified, compartmentalized program within the United States and many other countries * That these projects have, as warned in 1961 by President Eisenhower, escaped legal oversight and control in the United States, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere * That advanced spacecraft of extraterrestrial origin, called extraterrestrial vehicles (ETVs) by some intelligence agencies, have been downed, retrieved, and studied since at least the 1940s and possibly as early as the 1930s * That significant technological breakthroughs in energy generation and propulsion have resulted from the study of these objects (and from related human innovations dating as far back as the time of Nicola Tesla) and that these technologies use a new physics not requiring the burning of fossil fuels or ionizing radiation to generate unlimited amounts of energy * That classified, above-top-secret projects possess fully operational antigravity propulsion devices and new energy–generation systems that, if declassified and put into peaceful uses, would empower a new human civilization without want, poverty, or environmental damage.Those who doubt these assertions should carefully read my book, Disclosure,1[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt86] which includes the testimony of dozens ofmilitary and government witnesses whose statements clearly establish thesefacts. Given the vast and profound implications of these statements, whether oneaccepts or doubts them, all must demand that Congressional hearings be convenedto get to the truth of this matter. For nothing less than the human future hangsin the balance.IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ENVIRONMENTI have identified insiders and scientists who can prove, in open Congressionalhearings, that we do in fact possess classified energy-generation andantigravity propulsion systems capable of completely and permanently replacingall forms of currently used energy-generation and transportation systems. Thesedevices access the ambient electromagnetic and so-called zero point energystates to produce vast amounts of energy without any pollution. Such systemsessentially generate energy by tapping into the ever-present quantum vacuumenergy state—the baseline energy from which all energy and matter is fluxing.All matter and energy is supported by this baseline energy state, and it can betapped through unique electromagnetic circuits and configurations to generatehuge amounts of energy from space-time all around us. These are not perpetualmotion machines, nor do they violate the laws of thermodynamics—they merely tapan ambient energy field all around us to generate energy.This means that such systems do not require fuel to burn or atoms to split orfuse. They do not require central power plants, transmission lines, and therelated multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure required to electrify and powerremote areas of India, China, Africa, and Latin America. These systems are sitespecific: they can be set up at any location and generate energy. Essentiallythis constitutes the definitive solution to the vast majority of environmentalproblems facing our world.The environmental benefits of such a discovery can hardly be overstated, but abrief list includes: * The elimination of oil, coal, and gas as sources of energy generation, thus the elimination of air and water pollution related to the transport and use of these fuels. Oil spills, global warming, illnesses from air pollution, acid rain, and other ramifications can and must be ended within ten to twenty years. * Resource depletion and geopolitical tensions arising from competition for fossil fuel resources will end. * Traditional technologies exist today to scrub manufacturing effluent to zero or near-zero emissions for both air and water, but they use a great deal of energy and thus are considered too costly to fully use. Moreover, since they are energy intensive, and our energy systems today create most of the air pollution in the world, a point of diminishing return for the environment is reached quickly. That equation is dramatically changed when industries are able to tap vast amounts of free energy (there is no fuel to pay for—only the device, which is no more costly than other generators), and those systems create no pollution. * Energy-intensive recycling efforts will be able to reach full application since the energy needed to process solid waste will again be free and abundant. * Agriculture, which is currently very energy dependent and polluting, can be transformed to use clean, nonpolluting sources of energy. * Desertification can be reversed and world agriculture empowered by using desalinization plants, which are currently very energy intensive and expensive but will become cost efficient once able to use these new, nonpolluting energy systems. * Air travel, trucking, and intercity transportation systems will be replaced with new energy and propulsion technologies (antigravity systems allow for silent above-surface movement). No pollution will be generated, and costs will decrease substantially since the energy expenses will be negligible. Additionally, mass transportation in urban areas can use these systems to provide silent, efficient intracity movement. * Noise pollution from jets, trucks, and other modes of transportation will be eliminated by the use of these silent devices. * Public utilities will not be needed since each home, office, and factory will have a self-contained device able to generate whatever energy is needed. This means unsightly transmission lines that are subject to storm damage and power interruption will be a thing of the past. Underground gas pipelines, which frequently rupture or leak and damage Earth and water resources, will not be needed at all. * Nuclear power plants will be decommissioned, and the technologies needed to clean up such sites will be available. Classified technologies do exist to neutralize nuclear waste.Utopia? No, because human society will always be imperfect but perhaps not asdysfunctional as it is today. These technologies are real. Antigravity is areality, and so is free-energy generation. This is not a fantasy or a hoax. Donot believe those who say that this is not possible: they are the intellectualdescendants of those who said the Wright brothers would never fly.Current human civilization has reached the point of being able to commit“planeticide”: the killing of an entire world. We can and we must do better.These technologies exist, and every single person who is concerned about theenvironment and the human future should call for urgent hearings to allow thesetechnologies to be disclosed and declassified and safely applied.IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIETY AND WORLD POVERTYFrom the above, it is obvious that these technologies that are currentlyclassified would enable human civilization to achieve true sustainability. Ofcourse, in the near term, we are talking about the greatest social, economic,and technological revolution in human history—bar none. I will not minimize theworld-encompassing changes that would inevitably attend such disclosures. Havingdealt with this issue for much of my adult life, I am acutely aware of howimmense these changes will be.Aside from the singular realization that Homo sapiens are not the only—or mostadvanced—creatures in the universe, the release of these secret technologieswill present humanity with the most profound choices and opportunities in knownhistory. If we do nothing, our civilization will collapse environmentally,economically, geopolitically, and socially. In ten to twenty years, fossil fueland oil demand will outstrip supply significantly—and then it is the Mad Maxscenario where everyone is warring over the last barrel of oil. It is likelythat this geopolitical and social collapse will precede any environmentalcatastrophe.The disclosure of these new technologies will give us a new, sustainablecivilization. World poverty will be eliminated within our lifetimes. With theadvent of these new energy and propulsion systems, no place on Earth will needto suffer from want. Even the deserts will bloom . . .Once abundant and nearly free energy is available in impoverished areas foragriculture, transportation, construction, manufacturing, and electrification,there is no limit to what humanity can achieve. It is ridiculous—obsceneeven—that mind-boggling poverty and famine exist in the world while we sit onclassified technologies that could completely reverse this situation. So why notrelease these technologies now? The social, economic, and geopolitical order ofthe world would be greatly altered. Every deep insider with whom I have met hasemphasized that this would be the greatest change in known human history. Thematter is so highly classified not because it is so silly, but because itsimplications are so profound and far reaching. By nature, those who control suchprojects do not like change. And here we are talking about the biggest economic,technological, social, and geopolitical change in known human history. Hence,the status quo is maintained, even as our civilization hurtles toward oblivion.But by this argument, we would have never had the Industrial Revolution, and theLuddites would have reigned supreme to this day.An international effort to minimize disruption to the economy and to ease thetransition to this new social and economic reality is needed. We can do this,and we must do this. Special interests in certain oil, energy, and economicsectors need to be reined in and at the same time treated compassionately:nobody likes to see their power and empire crumble. Nations very dependent onthe sale of oil and gas will need help diversifying, stabilizing, andtransitioning to a new economic order.The United States, Europe, China, and Japan will need to adjust to a newgeopolitical reality as well: as currently poor but populous countriesdramatically develop technologically and economically, they will demand—and willget—a meaningful seat at the international table. And this is as it should be.But the international community will need to put in place safeguards to preventsuch potential geopolitical rapprochement between the first and third worldsfrom devolving into bellicose and disruptive behavior on the part of nations,now or in the future.The United States in particular will need to lead through strength but avoid thecurrent trend toward domination. Leadership and domination are not the same, andthe sooner we learn the difference the better off the world will be. There canbe international leadership without domination and hegemony, and the UnitedStates needs to realize these distinctions if it is to provide much-neededleadership on this issue.These technologies, because they will literally and figuratively decentralizepower, will enable the billions living in misery and poverty to enter a world ofnew abundance. And with economic and technological development, education willrise and birthrates will fall. It is well known that as societies become moreeducated, prosperous, and technologically advanced—and women take anincreasingly equal role in society—the birthrate falls and populationstabilizes. This is a good thing for world civilization and the future ofhumanity.With each village cleanly electrified, agriculture empowered with clean and freeenergy, and transportation costs lowered, poverty will dramatically fall in theworld. If we act now, we could effectively eliminate all poverty in the world aswe know it today. We only need the courage to accept these changes and thewisdom to steer humanity safely and peacefully into a new time.IMPLICATIONS FOR WORLD PEACE AND SECURITYA good many years ago, I was discussing this subject with the former chairman ofthe Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, the late Senator Claiborne Pell. Heexplained to me that he had been in Congress since the 1950s but had never beenbriefed on this subject. I told him that the nature of these black projects hasresulted in most of our leaders being left out of any decision making on thissubject, and what a shame this is. I said, “Senator Pell, all that time you werechairman of Foreign Relations, you were deprived of the opportunity to deal withthe ultimate foreign relations challenge,” and I pointed to the stars above ourheads. He said, “You know, Dr. Greer, I am afraid that you are right.”It is true that our great diplomats and wise elders, such as Senator Pell,President Jimmy Carter, and other international leaders, have been specificallyand deliberately prevented from having access to or control over this subject.This is a direct threat to world peace. In the vacuum of secrecy, operativessupervised by neither the people, the people’s representatives, the UnitedNations (UN), nor any other legitimate entity have taken actions that directlythreaten world peace.For instance, testimony corroborated by multiple military witnesses who did notknow one another and who had no opportunity for collusion has shown that theUnited States and other countries have engaged ETVs in armed attack, in somecases leading to the downing of these vehicles. As I said to Mrs. Boutros Ghali,wife of the then-secretary general of the UN, if there is even a 10 percentchance that this is true, then this constitutes the gravest threat to worldpeace in human history.Having personally interviewed numerous credible military and aerospace officialswith direct knowledge of such actions, I am certain that we have done this. Why?Because these unknown vehicles have traversed our airspace without ourpermission and because we wanted to acquire their technology. Nobody hasasserted that there is an actual threat to humanity from these objects: it seemsto me that any civilization capable of routine interstellar travel couldterminate our civilization in a nanosecond if that was their intent. That we arestill breathing the free air of Earth is abundant testimony to the nonhostilenature of these ET civilizations.We have also been informed that the so-called Star Wars (or National MissileDefense System) effort has really been a cover for black project deployment ofweapon systems to track, target, and destroy ETVs as they approach Earth orenter Earth’s atmosphere. No less a figure than Werner Von Braun warned on hisdeathbed of both the reality and the madness of such a scheme, apparently to noavail, according to Carol Rosin, his former spokesperson.Well, unless we change directions we are likely to end up where we are going.With the types of weapons currently in the covert arsenal—weapons more fearsomeeven than thermonuclear devices—there is no possibility of a survivableconflict. Yet in the darkness of secrecy, actions have been taken on behalf ofevery human that may endanger our future. Only a full, honest disclosure willcorrect this situation. It is not possible for me to convey in words the urgencyof this disclosure.For ten years I worked as an emergency room doctor and saw how every possibleobject can be used as a weapon. Every technology, unless guided by wisdom and adesire for that good and peaceful future—the only future possible—will be usedfor conflict. Those responsible for super-secret projects who answer to nolegally constituted body—not the UN, not the U.S. Congress, not the BritishParliament—must not be allowed to continue to act in this way on behalf ofhumanity.One of the greatest dangers of extreme secrecy is that it creates a hermeticallysealed, closed system impervious to the free and open exchange of ideas. In suchan environment, it is easy to see how grave mistakes can be made. For instance,the testimony I’ve gathered shows that these ETVs became very prominent after wedeveloped our first nuclear weapon and began to go into space. There weremultiple events—corroborated by numerous credible military officials—of theseobjects hovering over and even neutralizing intercontinental ballistic missilesites.A closed military view of this might be to take offense, engage incountermeasures, and attempt to down such objects. In fact, this would be thenormal response. But what if these ET civilizations were simply saying, “Pleasedo not destroy your beautiful world—and know this: we will not let you go intospace with such madness and threaten others?” An event showing concern and evena larger cosmic wisdom could be construed over and over again as an act ofaggression. Such misunderstandings and myopia are the stuff wars are made of.Whatever our perceptions of these visitors, there is no chance thatmisunderstandings can be resolved through violent engagement. To contemplatesuch madness is to contemplate the termination of human civilization.It is time for our wise elders and our levelheaded diplomats—men and women ofthe caliber of Senator Pell—to be put in charge of these weighty matters. Toleave this in the hands of a clique of unelected, self-appointed, andunaccountable officials in covert operations is the greatest threat to U.Snational security and world security in history. Eisenhower was right, butnobody was listening.In light of testimony showing that covert actions have been taken that involvedviolent engagement of these visitors, it is imperative that the internationalcommunity in general and the U.S. Congress and president in particular do thefollowing: * Convene hearings to assess the risks to national and international security posed by the current covert management of the subject * Enforce an immediate ban on weapons in space and specifically ban the targeting of any extraterrestrial objects since such actions are unwarranted and could endanger the whole of humanity * Develop a special diplomatic unit to interface with these extraterrestrial civilizations and to foster communication and peaceful relations * Develop a suitably empowered and open international oversight group to manage human-extraterrestrial relations and ensure peaceful and mutually beneficial interactions * Support international institutions that can ensure the peaceful use of those new technologies related to advanced energy and propulsion systems.In addition to the above, a less obvious—but perhaps equally pressing—threat toworld peace arises from the fact that the covert control of this subject hasresulted in the world being deprived of the new energy and propulsiontechnologies discussed earlier.World poverty and a widening gap between rich and poor are serious threats toworld peace and would be corrected by the disclosure and peaceful application ofthese technologies. The real threat of war over a shrinking supply of fossilfuels in the next ten to twenty years further underscores the need for thisdisclosure. What happens when the 4 billion people living in poverty want cars,electricity, and other modern conveniences—all of which depend on fossil fuels?To any thinking person, it is obvious we must transition quickly to the use ofthese now-classified technologies; they are powerful solutions already sittingon a shelf.Of course, a number of insiders have pointed out that these technologies are notyour grandfather’s Oldsmobile: they are technological advances that, like anyother, could be put to violent uses by terrorists, bellicose nations, andmadmen. Here we enter a catch-22: if these technologies are not forthcomingsoon, we will face a certain meltdown in human civilization and the environment,but if disclosed, immensely powerful new technologies will be out there forpossible destructive uses.In the near term, it is prudent to view humanity as likely to use any newtechnology violently. This means that international agencies must be created toensure—and enforce—the exclusively peaceful use of such devices. Thetechnologies exist today to link every such device to a Global PositioningSystem (GPS) monitor that could be used to disable or render useless any devicetampered with or used for anything but peaceful power generation and propulsion.These technologies should be regulated and monitored. And the internationalcommunity must mature to a level of competence to ensure their exclusivelypeaceful use. Any other use should be met with overwhelming resistance by everyother nation on Earth.Such a pact is the necessary next step. Maybe someday, humanity will live inpeace without the need for such controls, but for now the situation is like thatof chained dogs: some strong leashes are warranted and I believe are essential.It is also essential that such concerns not be a rationale for further delayingthe disclosure of these technologies. We have the knowledge and means to ensuretheir safe and peaceful use, and these must be applied soon if we are to avoidfurther degradation of the environment and an escalation of world poverty andconflict.In the final analysis then, we are faced with a social and spiritual crisis thattranscends any technological or scientific challenge. The technologicalsolutions exist, but do we possess the will, wisdom, and courage to apply themfor the common good? The more one contemplates this matter, the more it isobvious we have but one possible future: peace for man, peace on Earth, andpeace in space—a universal peace, wisely enforced. For every other path trulyleads to ruin.This then is the greatest challenge of the current era. Can our spiritual andsocial resources rise to this challenge? Nothing less than the destiny of thehuman race hangs in the balance."},{"pageContent":"9ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURYTheodore C.

CLARKEFollowing is a review of the development of antigravity research in the UnitedStates that notes how research activity seemed to disappear by the mid-1950s. Itthen addresses recently reported scientific findings and witness testimoniesthat show us this research and technology are alive and well and very advanced.The revelations of findings in this area will dramatically alter ourtwentieth-century view of physics and technology and must be considered inplanning for both energy and transportation needs in the twenty-first century.HISTORICAL BACKGROUNDTownsend Brown’s Technology of Electrogravitics 1 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt87]In the mid-1920s Townsend Brown (see chapter 5, “T. Townsend Brown” by JeaneManning) discovered that electric charge and gravitational mass are coupled.2[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt88] He found that when a capacitor is charged to ahigh voltage, it has a tendency to move toward its positive pole. His findings,which became known as the Biefeld-Brown effect, were opposed byconventional-minded physicists of his time.The Pearl Harbor DemonstrationAround 1953, Brown conducted a demonstration for military top brass. He flew apair of three-foot-diameter discs around a fifty-foot course tethered to acentral pole. Energized with 150,000 volts and emitting ions from their leadingedge, they attained speeds of several hundred miles per hour. The subject wasthereafter classified.Project WinterhavenBrown submitted a proposal to the Pentagon for the development of a Mach 3disc-shaped electrogravitic fighter craft. Drawings of its basic design areshown in one of his patents. They are essentially large-scale versions of histethered test discs.REVIEW OF ISSUES FROM THE 1950SOnce Brown’s findings became well known, some scientists began to openly speakabout the flying technology of UFOs, which had been observed extensively sincethe 1940s. None other than Professor Hermann Oberth, considered by some to beone of the fathers of the space age, who later worked in the United States withrenowned rocket scientist Werner von Braun, the Army Ballistic Missile Agency,and NASA, stated the following in 1954: “It is my thesis that flying saucers arereal and that they are space ships from another solar system.” Perhaps of moreinterest to our present discussion on propulsion, he then stated, “They areflying by the means of artificial fields of gravity. . . . They producehigh-tension electric charges in order to push the air out of their paths, so itdoes not start glowing, and strong magnetic fields to influence the ionized airat higher altitudes. First, this would explain their luminosity. . . . Secondly,it would explain the noiselessness of UFO flight. . . .3[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt89]We now know he was fundamentally correct in his assessment.In 1956, a British research company, Aviation Studies (International) Ltd.,published a classified report on electrogravitics systems examining variousaspects of gravity control. They summarized the pioneering work of TownsendBrown and then described the use of electrogravitic thrust as follows: “Theessence of electrogravitics thrust is the use of a very strong positive chargeon one side of the vehicle and a negative on the other. The core of the motor isa condenser and the ability of the condenser to hold its charge (the K-number)is the yardstick of performance. With air as 1, current dielectrical materialscan yield 6 and use of barium aluminate can raise this considerably, bariumtitanium oxide (a baked ceramic) can offer 6,000 and there is a promise of30,000, which would be sufficient for supersonic speed.”4[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt90]In one of their conclusions, based on Brown’s work, they suggested,“Electrostatic energy sufficient to produce a Mach 3 fighter is possible withmegavolt energies and a k of over 10,000.”5 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt91]In spite of Brown’s solid research, they later stated, “One of the difficultiesin 1954 and 1955 was to get aviation to take electrogravitics seriously. Thename alone was enough to put people off.”6 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt92] Itseems that is as true today as it was in the 1950s.A report by another British company, Gravity Rand Ltd., in 1956, agrees withthis assessment and states, “To assert electrogravitics is nonsense is as unrealas to say it is practically extant. Management should be careful of men in theiremploy with a closed mind or even partially closed mind on the subject.”7[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt93]However, a trade press magazine, The Aviation Report, made numerous referencesto antigravity projects and listed many of the companies pursuing research inthis area. Quotes from The Aviation Report listed in the Aviation Studies(International) Ltd. report8 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt94] are suggestive ofwhat was going on behind the scenes.In 1954 they predicted, “Progress has been slow. But indications are now thatthe Pentagon is ready to sponsor a range of devices to help further knowledge. .. . Tentative targets now being set anticipate that the first disk should becomplete before 1960 and it would take the whole of the ’sixties to develop itproperly, even though some combat things might be available ten years fromnow.”9 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt95]During this time period many of the major defense and technology companies werecited as either having research projects or activities in this new field. Forexample, “Companies studying the implications of gravitics are said, in a newstatement, to include Glenn Martin, Convair, Sperry-Rand, and Sikorsky, Bell,Lear Inc. and Clark Electronics. Other companies who have previously evincedinterest include Lockheed, Douglas and Hiller.”10 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt96]Other of these reports mentions AT&T, General Electric, as well asCurtiss-Wright, Boeing, and North American as having groups studyingelectrogravitics.During the same time period, the Gravity Rand report notes, “Already companiesare specializing in evolution of particular components of an electograviticsdisk.”11 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt97]However, in the area of predictions, The Aviation Report stated the followingbased on an extrapolation of technology development: “Thus this century will bedivided into two parts—almost to the day. The first half belonged to the WrightBrothers who foresaw nearly all the basic issues in which gravity was the bitterfoe. In part of the second half, gravity will be the great provider. Electricalenergy, rather irrelevant for propulsion in the first half becomes a kind ofcatalyst to motion in the second half of the century.”12[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt98]Looking back it is easy to say they missed the mark. Did they really miss it bya half a century? Reading through these reports it is quite obvious that therewas much interest in antigravity among a number of very high-profile companies,as well as in the Department of Defense. What happened to this interest, and whywas it all down-played during the following four-plus decades? After all, Brownhad shown there is a demonstrable connection between high-voltage fields andgravity. Why has it taken until the 1990s for more than just a few scientists tolook at these results and publish on them in the open literature? A review ofrecent statements by former military personnel and civilians connected to covertprojects begins to shed light on research activity in these areas over the lasthalf-century. And it appears there had been significant breakthroughs duringthis time period, well shielded from both the scientific and public eye.RECENT SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENTSIn this section we consider developments in the antigravity field since the late1980s and why the confluence of scientific findings and the testimony ofwitnesses associated with the military and covert groups indicate that a gravitysolution with technological implications has been found.Although general relativity has not been able to explain Brown’s electrograviticobservations, or any other antigravity phenomenon, the recent physicsmethodology of quantum electrodynamics (QED) appears to offer the theoreticalframework to explain electrogravitic coupling. Recent papers by members of theInstitute for Advanced Study Alpha Foundation are putting a solid theoreticalfoundation onto the antigravity effects within the theory of electrodynamics andinclude papers by Myron W. Evans13 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt99] and P. K.Anastasovski et al.14 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt100]Earlier, in a 1994 breakthrough paper, Alcubierre showed that superluminal spacetravel is, in principle, physically possible and will not violate the tenets ofthe theory of relativity.15 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt101] Harold Puthoff lateranalyzed these findings in light of the present SETI (Search forExtraterrestrial Intelligence) paradigms that insist that we could not bevisited by extraterrestrial civilizations because of the speed-of-lightlimitations dictated by the general relativity theory.16[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt102] He suggests that superluminal travel is indeedpossible. This leads to reduced-time interstellar travel and the possibility ofextraterrestrial visitation, which our limited understanding of physics andscientific arrogance has “forbidden” in some sectors for most of the twentiethcentury.The second aspect of these physics findings deals with the zero point orvacuum-state energy shown by the Casimir effect,17[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt103] which predicts that two metal plates closetogether attract each other due to imbalance in the quantum fluctuations. Theimplications of this zero point or vacuum-state energy are tremendous and aredescribed in several papers by Puthoff,18 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt104]starting during the late 1980s. Bearden and colleagues have also writtenextensively on the theoretical physics of zero point energy19[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt105] and additionally have described varioustechnological means of extracting this energy (for example see the recent paperby Anastasosvki et al.).20 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt106] A theoretical book onzero point energy (and antigravity) was published by Bearden in 2002.21[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt107] There is significant evidence that scientistssince Tesla have known about this energy, but that its existence and potentialuse have been discouraged and indeed suppressed over the past half-century ormore.22 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt108]The coupling of the electrogravitic phenomena observations and the zero pointenergy findings is leading to a new understanding of both the nature of matterand of gravity. This is just now being discussed in scientific journals (thoughsome evidence suggests it has been understood for decades within the blackproject covert community). The question that is being addressed is, What keepsthe universe running? Or more specifically, where do electrons get their energyto keep spinning around atoms? As electrons change state they absorb or releaseenergy, and where does it come from? The simplistic answer is that it is comingfrom the vacuum state. Puthoff describes the process as follows: “I discoveredthat you can consider the electron as continually radiating away its energy aspredicted by classical theory, but simultaneously absorbing a compensatingamount of energy from the ever-present sea of zero point energy in which theatom is immersed. An equilibrium between these two processes leads to thecorrect values for the parameters that define the lowest energy, or ground-stateorbit (see “Why atoms don’t collapse,” New Scientist, July 1987). Thus there isa dynamic equilibrium in which the zero-point energy stabilizes the electron ina set ground-state orbit. It seems that the very stability of matter itselfappears to depend on an underlying sea of electromagnetic zero-point energy.”23[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt109]Furthermore, it appears that it is the spinning of electrons that providesinertia and mass to atoms. These theories, linking electron spin, zero pointenergy, mass, and inertia, have been presented in a number of recent papers,such as those by Haisch and colleagues, and provide us with a possibleexplanation of the Biefeld-Brown effect.24 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt110] Itappears that an intense voltage field creates an electromagnetic barrier thatblocks the atomic structure of an atom from interacting with the zero pointfield. This slows down the electrons, reducing their gyroscopic effect, and thusreducing atomic mass and inertia, making them easier to move around.EVIDENCE OF EXTENSIVE ANTIGRAVITY TECHNOLOGYThe B-2 Advanced Technology BomberIn 1993, Paul LaViolette wrote a paper25 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt111]discussing the B-2 bomber and speculating on its probable antigravity propulsionsystem, based on a solid understanding of electrogravitics,26[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt112] the aircraft’s design, and the materials used inits manufacture. It appears the craft is using a sophisticated form of theantigravity principles first described by Brown. Support for this thesis camefrom Aviation Week and Space Technology (March 9, 1992), which reported that theB-2 bomber electrostatically charges its leading edge and its exhaust stream.Their information had come from a small group of former black project researchscientists and engineers, suggesting the B-2 uses antigravity technology. Thisinformation was supported by Bob Oechsler, an ex-NASA mission specialist who hadpublicly made a similar claim in 1990. These findings support the contentionthat there have been major developments in the area of antigravity propulsionthat are presently being applied in advanced aircraft.LaViolette later states the obvious—that “the commercial airline industry coulddramatically benefit with this technology which would not only substantiallyincrease the miles per gallon fuel efficiency of jet airliners, but would alsopermit high-speed flight that would dramatically cut flight time.”27[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt113]THE DISCLOSURE PROJECT WITNESSESOn May 9, 2001, a private organization, the Disclosure Project,28[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt114] held a press conference at the National PressClub in Washington, D.C. (see chapter 8, “Imagine a Free Energy Future for Allof Humanity” by Steven M. Greer, M.D.). They presented nearly two dozenwitnesses including retired army, navy, and air force personnel, a top FAAofficial, members of various intelligence organizations including the CIA andNRO, and industry personnel, all of whom who had witnessed UFO events or hadinside knowledge of government or industrial activities in this area. They alsoproduced a briefing document29 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt115] for members ofthe press and Congress and a book30 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt116] thatincludes the testimony of nearly seventy such witnesses from a pool of hundreds.Although they all spoke of the reality of the UFO phenomena, many also spoke ofcovert projects dealing with antigravity, zero point energy technologies, anddevelopment of alien reproduction vehicles (ARVs) by U.S. black project andcovert interests. The following excerpted quotes from these witnesses supportthe above contentions.Dan Morris is a retired air force career master sergeant who was involved in theextraterrestrial projects for many years. After leaving the air force, he wasrecruited into the supersecret National Reconnaissance Organization (NRO),during which time he worked specifically on extraterrestrial-connectedoperations. He had a cosmic top-secret clearance (thirty-eight levels above topsecret), which, he states, no U.S. president, to his knowledge, has ever held.“UFOs are both extraterrestrial and manmade. Well, the guys that were doing theUFOs, they weren’t sleeping, and Townsend Brown was one of our guys who wasalmost up with the Germans. So we had a problem. We had to keep TownsendBrown—what he was doing on anti-gravity electromagnetic propulsion secret.” Hethen describes a type of zero point energy device.“Well, if you have one of these units that’s about sixteen inches long and abouteight inches high and about ten inches wide, then you don’t need to plug intothe local electric company. These devices burn nothing. No pollution. It neverwears out, because there are no moving parts. What moves are electrons, in thegravity field, in the electronic field, and they turn in opposite directions,okay?”31 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt117]“Dr. B.” (name withheld since he still works in this area) is a scientist andengineer who has worked on top-secret projects almost all his life. Over theyears he has directly worked on or had involvement with such projects involvingantigravity, chemical warfare, secure telemetry and communications, extremelyhigh-energy space-based laser systems, and electromagnetic pulse technology.“Anti-gravity. As a matter of fact, I used to go out to the Hughes in Malibu.They had a big think tank up there. Big anti-gravity projects; I used to talk tothem out there. I’d give them ideas, because they bought all my equipment. Butthe American public will never, never hear about that. . . . This flying dischas a little plutonium reactor in it, which creates electricity, which drivesthese anti-gravity plates. We also have the next level of propulsion, it iscalled virtual field, which are called hydrodynamic waves.”32[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt118]Captain Bill Uhouse served ten years in the Marine Corps as a fighter pilot andfour years with the air force at Wright-Patterson AFB as a civilian doing flighttesting of exotic experimental aircraft. Later, for the next thirty years, heworked for defense contractors as an engineer of antigravity propulsion systems,on flight simulators for exotic aircraft—and on actual flying discs.“I don’t think any flying disc simulators went into operation until the early1960s—around 1962 or 1963. The reason why I am saying this is because thesimulator wasn’t actually functional until around 1958. The simulator that theyused was for the extraterrestrial craft they had, which is a 30-meter one thatcrashed in Kingman, Arizona, back in 1953 or 1952.“We operated it with six large capacitors that were charged with a million voltseach, so there were six million volts in those capacitors. . . . There weren’tany windows. The only way we had any visibility at all was done with cameras orvideo-type devices. . . . Over the last 40 years or so, not counting thesimulators—I’m talking about actual craft—there are probably two or three-dozen,and various sizes that we built.”33 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt119]“A. H.,” formerly of Boeing Aerospace, is a person who has gained significantinformation from inside the UFO extraterrestrial groups within our government,military, and civilian companies. He has friends at the NSA, CIA, NASA, JPL,ONI, NRO, Area 51, the air force, Northrup, Boeing, and others.“Most of the craft operate on antigravity and electrogravitic propulsion. We arejust about at the conclusion state right now regarding antigravity. I would giveit maybe about 15 years and we will have cars that will levitate using this typeof technology. We’re doing it up at Area 51 right now. That’s some of the stuffthat my buddy worked on up at Area 51 with Northrup, who lives now in Pahrump,Nevada. We’re flying antigravity vehicles up there and in Utah right now.”34[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt120]Lieutenant Colonel John Williams entered the air force in 1964 and became arescue helicopter pilot in Vietnam. He has an electrical engineering degree andwas in charge of all the construction projects for the Military Air Command.During his time in the military he knew that there was a facility inside ofNorton Air Force Base in California that no one was to know about.“There was one facility at Norton Air Force Base that was close hold—not eventhe wing commander there could know what was going on. During that time periodit was always rumored by the pilots that that was a cover for in fact thelocation of one UFO craft.”35 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt121]Note that all he knew was of the rumor; however, it is confirmed by the nexttestimony, which also confirms some of the comments made by Captain Uhouse.Mark McCandlish is an accomplished aerospace illustrator and has worked for manyof the top aerospace corporations in the United States. A colleague, with whomhe studied, has been inside a facility at Norton Air Force Base, where hewitnessed alien reproduction vehicles, or ARVs, that were fully operational andhovering. He states that the United States not only has operational antigravitypropulsion devices, but we have had them for many, many years, and they havebeen developed through the study, in part, of extraterrestrial vehicles over thepast fifty years.The colleague, Brad Sorensen, told him of visiting the “Big Hangar” during anair show at Norton Air Force Base on November 12, 1988, and how he had seenflying saucers in this hangar. “There were three flying saucers floating off thefloor—no cables suspended from the ceiling holding them up, no landing gearunderneath—just floating, hovering above the floor. He said that the smallestwas somewhat bell-shaped. They were all identical in shape and proportion,except that there were three different sizes. They had little exhibits with avideotape running, showing the smallest of the three vehicles sitting out in thedesert, presumably over a dry lakebed, some place like Area 51. It showed thisvehicle making three little quick, hopping motions; then [it] acceleratedstraight up and out of sight, completely disappearing from view in just a coupleof seconds—no sound, no sonic boom—nothing.“Well, this craft was what they called the Alien Reproduction Vehicle; it wasalso nicknamed the Flux Liner. This antigravity propulsion system—this flyingsaucer—was one of three that were in this hangar at Norton Air Force Base. [Its]synthetic vision system [used] the same kind of technology as the gun slavingsystem they have in the Apache helicopter: if [the pilot] wants to look behindhim, he can pick a view in that direction, and the cameras slew in pairs. [Thepilot] has a little screen in front of his helmet, and it gives him analternating view. He [also] has a little set of glasses that he wears—in fact,you can actually buy a 3-D viewing system for your video camera now that doesthis same thing—so when he looks around, he has a perfect 3-D view of theoutside, but no windows. So, why do they have no windows? Well, it’s probablybecause the voltages that we’re talking about [being] used in this system wereprobably something between, say, half a million and a million volts ofelectricity.” Brad Sorensen stated that at the ARV display, “a three stargeneral said that these vehicles were capable of doing light speed or better.”36[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt122]All of these witness testimonies do not prove the existence of a successful U.S.covert program in antigravity technologies. Only the demonstration of such craftcoupled with the accompanying government and technical specification documentswould “prove” this. However, these testimonies, coupled with information fromother substantial sources such as Nick Cook’s 2002 book mentioned below,strongly support this contention.THE HUNT FOR ZERO POINTThe Hunt for Zero Point37 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt123] contains some of thestrongest evidence yet for major efforts and successes in the field ofantigravity technology. The author, Nick Cook, who for the past fifteen yearshas been the aviation editor and aerospace consultant for Jane’s Defense Weekly,spent the last ten years collecting information for the book. This includedarchival research on Nazi Germany’s antigravity technology and interviews withtop officials at NASA, the Pentagon, and secret defense installations. He showsthat America has cracked the gravity code and classified the information at thehighest security levels. Because antigravity and its allied zero point energytechnologies potentially offer the world a future of unlimited, nonpollutingenergy it has been suppressed because of the “huge economic threat.” Hisfindings support those reported by many of the Disclosure Project witnessescited above.ANTIGRAVITY TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATIONSAlthough Brown reported many of his findings nearly a half-century ago, otherexperimenters have just recently begun to reproduce his work and report on it inthe open literature and on the Web. For example, Davenport published the resultsof his work in 1995 supporting the findings of Brown,38[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt124] while Bahder and Fazi in 2002 described theirassessment of the forces associated with an asymmetric capacitor.39[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt125] Transdimensional Technologies40[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt126] in the United States and JLN Labs41[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt127] in France have posted on the web: diagrams, webvideos, and data on their versions of antigravity “Lifters” based on anextension of Brown’s work. It is a sad commentary on this whole area of researchto see that public science is requiring us to demonstrate principles that weredemonstrated nearly fifty years ago.There have also been a number of other demonstrations of antigravity phenomenaby researchers throughout the world. This includes the work of Brazilian physicsprofessor Fran De Aquino and such devices as the Searl electrogravity disc, thePodkletnov gravity shield and Project Greenglow, the Zinsser kineto-baric fieldpropulsion, and the Woodward field thrust experiments on piezoelectrics. All ofthese are described in more detail by Greer and Loder.42[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt128]IMPLICATIONS OF THIS RESEARCH * Antigravity and zero point energy research and their applications are finally being addressed by some of the open scientific community. This means there will have to be a rewriting of textbooks in this area so our new generation of students can apply this “new knowledge.” Its application will lead to major breakthroughs in transportation technologies both Earthside and in outer space. The implications are that we have the potential for human exploration of our solar system and beyond, if we have the will, within our lifetimes. It also means that the majority of twentieth-century space technology will be obsolete and may in fact already be so. * The zero point or vacuum-state energy source is seen as a totally nonpolluting energy source, which has the potential to replace all the fossil fuels on this planet. It also will provide the energy needed for long-range space flights. This means that fuel cells and solar cells in common use today for space-flight energy applications will only be needed until we transition to these new energy technologies. * Based on an analysis of trends in antigravity research over the last half-century and the information provided by numerous witnesses, it appears there is both good and bad news. The good news is that it appears that we (at least covert projects) have already developed the theories of antigravity and additionally have developed working spacecraft based on these principles. The bad news is that these technologies have been developed for at least several decades, at the public’s expense, and that humankind has been deprived of these technologies, while continuing to waste energy using less efficient and pollution-enhancing technologies. * Supporting this contention is the following quote from Ben Rich, former head of the Lockheed Skunk Works. Just prior to his death, he stated to a small group after a lecture, “We already have the means to travel among the stars, but these technologies are locked up in black projects and it would take an act of God to ever get them out to benefit humanity.” He further went on to say, “Anything you can imagine we already know how to do.”43 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt129] These are strong words from a knowledgeable deep insider and words that support what a number of the witnesses stated as well. * As the reality of this knowledge begins to be understood, there will be an outcry among space scientists not on the inside for release of these technologies to allow all of us to explore space. There will be major changes in the way NASA does its business, though predicting these changes is difficult. * Not only has space exploration in the public sector suffered, but our planet’s environment has suffered as well. As this knowledge begins to sink in, there will be an outcry among all concerned citizens on this planet for release of these technologies to allow all of us to reduce and ultimately eliminate global warming and environmental pollution, which so threaten our way of life. These technologies will not only affect space travel technologies, but will also have a profound effect on transportation and energy production on the Earth’s surface.In conclusion, we might consider the observation made by Halton Arp: “We arecertainly not at the end of science. Most probably we are just at thebeginning!”44 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt130]A FREE-ENERGY WORLDI believe we need a completely new macroeconomic paradigm. My vision is thateach home and business would have a new-energy-generation system integral to thesite and that the energy would be, indeed, free.The grid—even the proposed “smart” grid—is anything but smart, but is prone tofailure, storms, and outages. We need to move to a paradigm where energy isgenerated where it is used. Once the device is in place, it would be free.Impoverished areas and peoples should have such systems heavily subsidized orgifted to them. It is for this reason that we should have a charitable trust toensure that whatever benefits come from any such new invention, that theproceeds go back to benefit humanity and the needy. Anyone not in agreement withthis overarching vision is not allowed to be on our board.My vision is also to engineer such systems so they last at least one hundredyears—eliminating the current paradigm of throwaway devices (lightbulbs, cars,computers, appliances, and the like—all deliberately designed to fail in a shorttime to churn up more replacement revenue).Eventually, we will move to applications of the technology so that everymanufactured item that uses energy will have a free-energy generator withinit—this is completely feasible. At that point, homes and buildings will not evenneed electrical wiring, saving huge amounts in building costs—and lives—byeliminating electrical fires and electrocutions.The costs of manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and otherenergy-intensive industries will plummet. Eventually we will move to aless-than-twenty-hour workweek with full employment and abundant leisure time topursue health, recreation, education, and spiritual development and higherstates of consciousness.The current economic macroeconomic system is, in effect, undeclared economicslavery and must be abolished, just as actual slavery was abolished in the1800s.That’s the view as I see it.Note that currently all the “new-energy” proposals so much in fashion now are,in fact, a fraud: centralized utilities using multibillion-dollar wind, solar,and similar old technologies—all so it can be controlled and metered by the GEsof this world. Absurd.Of course, decentralizing the macroeconomy and creating abundance for all whodwell on Earth is precisely what the “controllers” wish to avoid: they likebeing masters of the universe. But it is time for change. And it will be thegreatest change in known, recorded human history.THE UNIVERSE AS ENERGY SOURCEEnergy is a snowflake, a flower, a leaf. It is atoms and molecules, DNA and allthe rest. It is the giant redwood and the gentle violet. It is ice-crystals onthe window pane, the wonderfully intricate tapestry of tissues and cells inliving creatures. It is the cycle of the seasons, the span of a life, the rhythmof the planets. It is the hazy calmness of a summer’s day, the power of thehurricane, the crush of a great ocean breaker. It is the gentle flame of acandle, the explosion of a supernova. We cannot escape from energy. . . . It isboth the information content and the carrier wave. We are embodied in energy. .. . It is this intrinsic oneness within the many which is the essence ofcausality.JOHN DAVIDSONThere is really nothing sacrosanct about the physicist’s present interpretationof Nature. We are all free to think things out for ourselves and we can exploreour own ideals without being obliged to conform to the pattern already set byothers. If we are able to fashion the basic structure of Nature we cannot betimid in the approach we take. . . . We should not invent a pattern ofscientific behavior and expect Nature to conform. We should perceive Nature’sown pattern.HAROLD ASPDENThe implosion motor, however, is centripetally operated. It produces its owndriving source through the diamagnetic use of water and air. It does not requireany other fuel such as coal, oil, uranium or energy derived from atomicsplitting, since it can produce its own energy (atomic power) by biologicalmeans in unlimited amounts—almost without cost.OLOF ALEXANDERSSONLooking at things from first principles, we have to understand that motion isthe essence of manifestation. Everything we perceive is an energy dance. At thephysical level, this subatomic dance is spun out on the energy of space or thevacuum state energy field. And the nature of the motion of the spending,whirling energy vortices which we call subatomic particles is of the utmostimportance, for it is a pattern which gives rise to all the microscopic forms weperceive with our senses and allied instrumentation.JOHN DAVIDSONWe have no means of getting hold of the ether mechanically; we cannot grasp itor move it in the ordinary way: we can only get it electrically. We arestraining the ether when we charge a body with electricity; it tries to recover,it has the power to recoil.SIR OLIVER LODGEOrthodox scientists have never looked for a way to engineer the vacuum, becausethey have not realized that it is composed of pure massless charge.THOMAS E. BEARDENA prerequisite for solving our self-created environmental planetary mess is aworld view that must bear some relationship to the highest spiritual reality.Without this, there is no basis upon which to determine our actions, nointuitive comprehension of natural law, no rationale for unselfish behavior.JOHN DAVIDSON"},{"pageContent":"10HARNESSING NATURE’S FREE ENERGYTHE SEARL EFFECT GENERATORJohn R. R. Searl and John A. Thomas Jr. I think it is possible to utilize magnetism as an energy-source. But we scienceidiots cannot do that; this has to come from the outside.WERNER HEISENBERGIf the incredibly powerful invisible background is the ultimate origin of spinand therefore of magnetism, then a self-running magnetic motor can’t be accusedof violating any laws of physics.JEANE MANNING AND JOEL GARBONTHE SEARL EFFECT: A DEFINITIONAn effect based on magnetic fields that generates a continual motion of magneticrollers around magnetized rings (also called plates), producing electric energywith no apparent input from outside, and, under certain conditions, creates anantigravity effect that can be used for propulsion. Side effects includenegative ionization of the surrounding air and a cooling of temperature aroundthe device when in operation.JOHN SEARL—AN INTRODUCTIONJohn A. ThomasThe young John Searl met with a hard life. He was taken from his mother, who wasdeemed unfit to care for him, and placed in an orphanage. From there he wasplaced in foster homes, where he was physically beaten on numerous occasions. Hehad no formal education as a child, but during these years he had a series ofrecurring dreams. These dreams came twice a year in pairs—first one, then theother—always the same dreams. They recurred from the ages of four and one-halfto ten. The dreams were frightening and left a lasting impression on him. He hadno idea what they meant, if anything. But they were destined to provide the keysto his life’s work.Searl later discovered a mathematical function called the law of the square(referencing numbers, not the shape). He was immediately drawn to this idea,questioning its significance and how it was used. The more he studied, the morehe discovered.BACKGROUND ON THE LAW OF THE SQUARESThe history of magic or Latin squares dates back thousands of years to the timeof the pyramids of ancient Egypt, and possibly back to the first Chinesedynasties. The Chinese still use magic squares to cut and trim bonsai trees tothe correct mathematical ratios of nature. When these laws are understood, onecan make a case that the universe exists and acts according to precisemathematical laws.The law of the squares, or magic squares, is an old technology that experienceda rebirth after Searl discovered the matrix has three-dimensional propertiesthat can be used to model the quantum energy states of mass in space-time.There are three groups of squares, and there can be no others. Group one squaresconsist of all odd numbers. Group two is composed of even numbers divisible byfour. The remaining even numbers not divisible by four are in group three.When the correct matrix of random numbers produces the same line value whensummed up vertically, horizontally, and diagonally, then you have the law of thesquares—a law as valid as the law of conservation in physics, which says energycan be neither created nor destroyed but can be converted from one state toanother.image [images/9781594775093_046.jpg]Figure 10.1. An example of the law of the squares.Searl has written many books on the subject, including The Law of the Squares,and has used these mathematical matrixes and their laws to construct his SearlEffect Generator (SEG).For an SEG to work effectively, the various magnetic elements must be of aspecific nature, weight, and dimension, and must be configured in a way thatmeets the requirements of the law of the squares.THE LAW OF THE SQUARESJohn R. R. SearlThe law of the squares states that all things in the universe have two primestates—opposing states with one having a greater value than the other—and that adivision separates these two states. In my books are hundreds of examples, butlet us here take the case of Homo sapiens—you and me—and see how the law of thesquares applies: 1. Nonexperts represent the higher value. 2. Experts represent the lower value. 3. Between these two states there is a thin dividing line of inventors. 4. The nonexperts live in the present, not the yesterdays or the tomorrows. 5. The experts do not live in the present but the past, be it the past of five or a thousand years ago. 6. The inventors live in the tomorrow, for they create the future that is to be. Without inventors there would be no tomorrows, merely a continuation of todays, unchanging except for a change of seasons.Inventors are accused of living in a world of fantasy, while so-called expertsclaim to live in the world of reality—ironically, the very world born of thefantasy of inventors who suffered and struggled to create the present realitythat the experts now claim as their own.Before anyone can conceive an idea leading to a new invention, a number oftriggers have to be in place: 1. The mind must be free of all conventional brainwashing so the subconscious can communicate freely with the conscious mind. The data stored between these two states can then be activated in response to the correct input or sensory stimulus. 2. The brain must also possess a wealth of information either brought in at birth or acquired over time. 3. Once the correct triggers have been stimulated so the conscious or subconscious mind can start searching and assembling a dream or thought pattern, data make their way into the conscious mind and impress the inventor with the possibilities of some new creation. In the words of Louis Pasteur, “Fortune favors the prepared mind.” 4. Wholly original creations are rare because all inventors rely on discoveries and inventions of the past, a past often extending back into the night of time. 5. My work is based on the success of hundreds of inventors before me; my work merely extends their work. Others invented the materials, tools, and equipment that make it possible for me to create. 6. Within nature’s laws nothing is impossible except as the mind makes it so. It is the human mind—yours and mine—that has delayed and still delays progress toward a better world than the one we have today. 7. In my case, the subconscious assembled an extremely simple game that strangely contains the mathematics required to achieve the technology that led to the creation of the Searl Effect Generator and the Inverse-Gravitational Vehicle. 8. I was blessed with these discoveries, which contain so much information on science and technology. Like Austrian water pioneer Viktor Schauberger, lack of formal education preserved my native curiosity. 9. The device is basically a linear motor riding on a magnetic bearing; in reality there are three such units in one body. 10. Its characteristics are similar to that of an autotransformer—again, three such devices in one body. 11. The inner unit generates its own output, which feeds into the second unit, which also generates its own much higher output, vastly boosted by the input of the first unit. The second unit’s output then feeds into the third unit, which is also generating a much larger output, again greatly increased by the input from the second unit. 12. Every operation of the SEG follows Newton’s laws precisely. Experts who claim my work is “impossible” are merely protecting the status quo and their own egos. Ever since Cremonini and Libri refused to look through Galileo’s telescope, the experts of each generation have resisted new discoveries. It is the same story today. 13. Not only is there a problem with designing and testing the specialized equipment needed for this research, but opposition also comes from those who function out of ignorance or greed. To seek new solutions by following the same old tried and failed paths is what we call neurotic behavior. But for these frailties of human nature, my technology would have reached the marketplace as far back as 1968 or again in 2003. 14. Today, for the fifth time, efforts are being made to move this technology, but cost is the greatest problem and increases each year it takes to reach the marketplace. There is also another problem affecting delay, and that is that I have to live and maintain a job in order to survive while covering my developmental costs out of pocket. These problems lead to time delays, but I am absolutely dedicated to the survival and triumph of the SEG, with its enormous benefits for humanity. 15. This world is dying from pollution for which this technology offers a solution no other known technology presently offers. Yet this technology is ignored because it poses a challenge to the immense wealth tied up in existing fossil fuel and related industries. The only thing keeping my SEG out of the marketplace is greed, while humanity suffers and the planet, with its many magnificent species, heads toward extinction. 16. Were a technology such as my SEG, with its capacity to extract energy from the creative vacuum, in the marketplace, it would slowly bring an end to hurricanes such as those experienced along the coastline of the United States, which will also reach Canada and even the United Kingdom if global warming is allowed to increase. 17. You may wonder if the SEG output is direct current or alternating current. It is an alternating current of very high voltage that must be passed through a step-down transformer for the voltage required, like all other power systems available today; current is proportional to the voltage. 18. Rare earth elements play an important part in the success of the SEG’s operation. The one that has become the keystone of my work is neodymium (Nd), because everyone wants to follow the same one I originally used in 1946. It is far from the best, but it is the first choice for cost and availability. 19. One major problem is that it loses electrons to the air. As such it will oxidize in air. This can be prevented by the following means: a. Keep it in argon while not in use, which is the better choice, or in oil, which is the choice I do not prefer. b. Or mix in another rare earth element that does not lose electrons to the air; that will block the Nd from losing electrons. c. As you move up the element chart there are better options to use. Also it makes the SEG smaller for the same output. 20. Experts have always declared humanity’s advances “impossible”—electricity, the automobile, the airplane, the telephone, television, space travel. The great advances of the world are always brought about by men and women of vision who live in a world of fantasy, for they alone are capable of the free thinking by which progress is achieved and humanity’s knowledge is advanced. 21. All human achievements originate in the world of fantasy and existed there before making their appearance on Earth, and all inventions of the future will begin there as well. But before any new invention can be brought forth from the world of fantasy into the world of reality, some ingenious person must attune to it. That action requires a set of triggers in a precise order of events. Then and only then will such products become available to mankind. 22. Though the SEG is a marvelous device that can help reduce pollution problems and global warming and give plants and animals a chance to survive, it first requires everyone to care and help clean up this planet that we’ve made such a mess of due to our lack of knowledge and understanding. It requires that we replant the trees that in our ignorance we have cut down. Otherwise hurricanes and tornados will only increase. It takes about thirty years for a tree to become fully functioning in its duty cycle in reducing global warming. Clearly, we need to begin a massive replacement task to rebalance nature to our advantage. 23. If you truly care about your children’s health and welfare, you must act today and help solve these problems. I invite you to assist me in my efforts to get this SEG technology out into the world. This isn’t about me. It’s about saving our planet before it’s too late!THE SEARL EFFECT TECHNOLOGYJohn A. ThomasThe Searl Effect Technology promises to be one of mankind’s greatest inventionsand a door into a new world of boundless possibilities. It could place Searl inthe annals of history, but his one desire is to see his technology fullyimplemented as soon as possible for the benefit of the Earth’s people andenvironment.image [images/9781594775093_047.jpg]Figure 10.2. Searl technology has all the hallmarks of a world-class solutionfor today’s energy needs. We expect it to be one of the dominant forms of energyproduction of the future.The story of his hardships and persecution is a long one. Long after most menwould have given in to the gambit of the big business monopolies, the misleadinggovernment officials, and the pathological skeptics sponsored to promotedisinformation against alternative energy solutions, Searl steadfastly remainswith us today, courageously willing to offer his solution to our planet incrisis.The SEG is a revolutionary device that generates electricity with no apparentinput from the outside and is capable of supplying electrical power. It produceseconomically sustainable clean energy with no reliance on fossil fuels such asoil or natural gas. However, the development and implementation of thisrevolutionary invention has encountered a great deal of resistance over manyyears because of the obvious economic repercussions to big oil industries and tocentralized energy distribution monopolies that have entrenched themselvesdeeply within governments and industry.If the people of the world should choose to support Searl’s final mission andadopt his technology, we could eliminate air pollution, solve our looming energycrisis, and support unprecedented economic growth. Anything that can be runelectrically can be driven by an SEG with no pollution and no use of fuel ascommonly known.How much longer will we allow the corruption and greed of the privileged few toblind us to the opportunity to heal our Mother Earth and advance ustechnologically? We hear about massive destruction of tropical rain forests andgrowing deserts around the world. We also hear about pollution going into ourair, rivers, lakes, and seas. Now, the polar ice caps are receding, with agrowing ozone hole over them. Also, 2012 proved to be the warmest year on recordsince global temperature records began being kept. All this is making itincreasingly self-evident that the environment is being compromised ominously byhuman activity. This may be our last chance to make a transition to a betterworld.These ecological problems may seem far from our everyday life as most things maystill seem normal to us on a day-by-day basis. But we might just wake up one dayto the fact that we are too late to repair the damage done to our environment.THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF A SEARL EFFECT GENERATORAn SEG consists of a series of three rings and rollers that go around thoserings. The first ring contains twelve rollers; this is equivalent to having atwelve-cycle or twelve-phase linear motor. A linear motor will not operate onless than twelve phases. There are many other correlations one can make, butthis works along with the laws of Nature. There can be more than twelve rollers,but no less. Each roller consists of eight separate stacked segments heldtogether magnetically.The SEG is made using Square 4. You must pick a line of Square 4 that you wantto use. The numbers of each line add up to the same total. Choose one of theselines to use for building. The numbers represent the weight of each of theelements used. Square 4 can be raised to your desired mass and weight by raisingthe level of the Square 4. The final number must be that of weight.The rollers revolve around the plates that form the rings, but they do not touchthem.There is a center element and then three other elements going out from thecentral core of each roller. The plates will have the same center element on theinner side and the lightest element on the outside.image [images/9781594775093_048.jpg]Figure 10.3. In an SEG, the number of rollers on each ring is different—thenumber increases by ten rollers for each successive ring. All of theconstruction details are based on the law of the squares.image [images/9781594775093_049.jpg]Figure 10.4. Forces acting on the rollerThe amount and weight of each element is determined by the level of the Square 4used. The numbers of the square represent the weight of each element. Thelargest number is the rare earth element. The second highest number is themagnetic layer. The third highest number is the conductive layer, and thesmallest number is nylon 66.Nylon 66 is the element Searl chose to use because it has a high negativecontent and also has a double bond configuration. The nylon is used as asemiconductor in a diode. What you have here is basically a solid state device.image [images/9781594775093_050.jpg]Figure 10.5. Coils collect energyThe electrons are given off from the center element (which is neodymium) andtravel out through the other elements. If the nylon had not been there, the SEGwould act like a pulsed laser and one pulse would go out, stop, build up, andanother pulse would go out. But the nylon acts as a control gate; the controlgate gives you an even flow of electrons throughout the SEG. The next layer outis the magnetic layer. This layer should contain a substance that will readilymagnetize. The specifics of this layer will be discussed next. The third orouter layer is the conductive layer. This is the discharge point of thegenerator, and the electrons are picked up by C coils around the generator. Theoutput of the generator is high voltage AC, which is then transformed to suityour needs.THE IMPRESSED MAGNETIC FIELDSThe rollers have a primary north and south pole, as do the plates (large rings)in this case. There’s a primary north and south pole on the rollers and aprimary north and south pole on the plates. Obviously the north pole of theroller will be attracted to the south pole of the plate.Ordinarily they would clamp right on and not be able to move, especially beingmade with neodymium. But there’s a secondary field impressed on these magnetsusing an AC component. By impressing an AC magnetic field on the roller, Searlwas able to create the demonstration bar and two rollers. The rollers wouldrotate completely around the bar, even around a 90-degree angle, because of theway the fields were impressed on the magnets.One of the marvelous things about the SEG is that none of its parts touch. Thereis no friction whatsoever. The rollers float on the magnetic field because ofthe AC component impressed on them and will not fly off because of the DCcomponent impressed on them. They travel around the first ring at about 250miles per hour. In each successive ring moving outward, the rollers’ speedincreases by two and one-half times.ELEMENT SELECTIONThe choosing of the elements is of primary importance, obviously. If one looksat the periodic table of elements, one notices that the atomic structure of eachelement is illustrated. Searl discovered that most of the elements that workbest are hexagonal, excluding iron. He uses them in conjunction with thehexagonal configuration in order to pick the correct and most efficient way todevelop the desired effect.The specific powders of elements are carefully weighed. These elements have tobe of a specific grain size, atomic weight, and exact dimensions and puttogether in a way that meets the requirements of the law of squares.These elements are chosen according to the law of the squares and employed sothat the heaviest atomic element is at the center and the atomic weights lessenas the elements progress outward. The center element Searl has used since hisfirst SEG is neodymium, which is element number 60. Modern science has justdiscovered that neodymium is good for making magnets. Searl has been using itsince 1946!RECOVERING THE DREAMVarious people in history have claimed to have generated what the scientificcommunity calls free energy. And many of them have claimed to have producedantigravity devices and craft. Today, most of them are dead. We’re trying toretrace their endeavors to rediscover their technology. Most of these inventorswere very secretive to prevent their inventions being stolen or falling into thewrong hands. Their motives are understandable. The result is that theirtechnology and inventions were lost.These great inventors include Nikola Tesla, John Keely, Viktor Schauberger, OtisCarr, and perhaps others of whom I’m unaware. I come across people almost dailywho say they have free-energy devices that work. Searl has kept many aspects ofhis technology secret for the same reasons Keely, Tesla, and others did. He hasbeen wrongfully imprisoned and had all of his equipment and papers destroyed,almost burying the Searl technology.But Searl is not to be stopped. He is strong willed and dedicated to using histechnology to create a better world for humanity. He has released this work inthe form of books titled The Law of the Squares so it cannot be destroyed again.I’ve asked people, What would you give to be able to talk to Nikola Tesla orJohn Worrell Keely? I’d give a lot to talk to Tesla, Keely, or many others. Whatmarvelous new inventions might they come up with in light of our moderndiscoveries? Take Tesla today and show him the transistor; what do you thinkhe’d come up with given his past demonstrations of inventive and visionarypowers?Did Keely really conquer gravity using sound waves through sympatheticvibrations? Did Schauberger really create a gravity field using vortexicalaction in liquids? Did Carr have special windings in his craft that allowed himto generate voltage needed for antigravity? These questions may never beanswered except by diligent research and experimentation, and even then it maytake years.Searl is alive today and wants to give his technology to the world. Will we waittoo long to accept it? Will we waste our time scoffing and trying to disprovehis technology, as has been done with others in the past? Will we turn a blindeye to his attempt to move us into the future, as we did with Tesla—all so wecan hold on to the past?I say we must not—dare not—turn blind eyes. We’re looking for the visionaries oftoday to move us ahead while there is still time to save the people of thisplanet. We no longer have the luxury of saying, “Someday someone else will doit.” We’ve severely damaged our atmosphere. We’re depleting our naturalresources. We’re cutting down our rain forests at an alarming rate. We hearabout these things and feel we can do nothing, but real answers do exist, hereand now.We can do something about these problems if we choose to act before it’s toolate and the technology is lost once again. When we look at the big picture ofthe Earth and what we’ve done to our atmosphere, soil, and water, we realizethere is only a minute amount of time left before action comes too late. Somecities are almost unlivable now because of smog. Searl’s technology could dosomething about that. And that’s why I’m involved with it."},{"pageContent":"11COLD FUSIONTHE END TO CONVENTIONAL ENERGY AND THE START OF SOCIAL REORGANIZATIONEdmund Storms, Ph.D. The field of study called cold fusion was born de novo. It did not emerge from arecognized body of continuing scientific research. It was not an extension ofongoing scholarship. No precursors puzzled the world’s scientific laboratories.More dramatically, it threatened the canons of nuclear physics. This birth willprove unique in the annals of science.CHARLES G. BEAUDETTEIt is really quite amazing by what margins competent but conservative scientistsand engineers can miss the mark, when they start with the preconceived idea thatwhat they are investigating is impossible. When this happens, the mostwell-informed men become blinded by their prejudices and are unable to see whatlies directly ahead of them.ARTHUR C. CLARKEOne of the problems the fusioneers have had is that their experiments last farlonger than the media’s attention span.THE ECONOMIST, SEPTEMBER 30, 1989WHAT MAKES THE SAGA OF COLD FUSION WORTH YOUR TIME?How is it possible for one of the most important discoveries of the twentiethcentury to be systematically rejected by the scientific establishment and somegovernments for twenty years? This discovery claimed that nuclear reactionscould be made to occur in solid materials and these reactions could produceuseful heat without harmful radiation. A typical scientist asking this questionwould answer that the reason is obvious—because the claim is wrong and based onbad science. If bad science were the answer, why would scientists in majorlaboratories in more than eight countries continue to study the effect? Whywould scientific papers continue to be written and published? Why wouldrespected authors write articles and books supporting the claims?Unfortunately, this type of uninformed rejection is not unique, and manyexamples have occurred during the past decades and centuries. The present debateabout global warming is the most recent example, while the rejection ofGalileo’s ideas about the sun and planets is a famous example from the past. Butwe are now living in modern times when new insights are commonplace and when theopen-minded ideal of science should be taken for granted—or should it? Perhapsthe treatment given to cold fusion shows we were too hasty in thinking scienceor public awareness had actually changed over the years. Perhaps the averagehuman mind is incapable of objective evaluation of new ideas, even when thatperson is trained in science. Or has an objective evaluation of Nature failed atall levels, especially in the United States? These questions add to theimportance of understanding the history and reality of cold fusion.For twenty years, a small minority of scientists accepted the possibility, atthe risk of their reputations and jobs, that cold fusion was a real phenomenon.What made them different from the skeptics who risked nothing by theirrejection? To make matters worse, in many cases simple rejection was not enough.The skeptics also made sure the claim became an allegory for bad science. As aresult, if a lazy writer wanted an example of pathological science, he had onlyto use the claim for cold fusion as an example of how science can go astray. Useof this approach might be forgiven as normal incompetence, except for oneimportant fact.Cold fusion has the potential to completely reorganize society—an importancethat does not tolerate ignorance or incompetence. Therefore, understanding theconsequences of this energy source is essential before it gains widespread use.Equally important is understanding why such universal rejection was so widelyaccepted. Hopefully, similar mistakes might be prevented in the future.Cold fusion has important benefits as well as some handicaps. Let’s start withthe advantages. The resulting energy involves no gas emission or radioactiveby-products. Once cold fusion is adopted, global warming resulting fromatmospheric CO2 (carbon dioxide) and CH4 (methane) can be a concern of the past.Even if a reduction in atmospheric CO2 does not stop global warming, a greatdeal of energy will be required to build protection for countries that will beexposed to the rising oceans and that will need to rebuild after the damageproduced by severe weather we can expect in the future. This energy source willbe especially important as conventional sources become increasingly expensivedue to growing demand and dwindling supplies.These are the major advantages, but several problems also exist. The process isnot easy to initiate on purpose. Skeptics use this lack of reproducibility toreject the whole idea. This difficulty occurs because an unknown process startsthe nuclear reactions in an unknown special material that is created mostly bychance. The challenge now is to identify how this special material is formed anddeliberately make large quantities.Although temperatures as high as 450°C using fused-salt electrolysis1[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt131] have produced excess heat and helium, thissuccess has been difficult to replicate and the lifetime of the process might beshort. Temperatures at the boiling point of water2,[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt132] 3, [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt133] 4[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt134] have also produced successful results, but thistemperature is not ideal although it can be useful. Until the special materialrequired to initiate the nuclear effect can be made in large amounts withreliability, the engineering problems will remain unsolved. Nevertheless, theadvantages and need are so great that this phenomenon is worth exploring inspite of a few potential problems. A rational person has to ask, “With theworldwide interest in finding energy sources that can stop global warming sointense, why is this obvious potential energy source ignored?”A BRIEF HISTORY OF COLD FUSIONI learned of this discovery while working at the Los Alamos National Laboratory(LANL) in 1989, and I continued to investigate the claim in my own laboratoryafter retiring from LANL. In addition, I published dozens of papers and reviews,including a book describing all the reported observations up to 2007.5[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt135] What I’m about to describe is not based onincomplete knowledge or popular opinion.Anyone reading newspapers twenty years ago anywhere in the world will rememberProfessor Martin Fleischmann (then head of the Department of Electrochemistry atthe University of Southampton) and Professor Stanley Pons (then chairman of theChemistry Department at the University of Utah).6[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt136] In March of 1989, these two chemists announcedan incredible discovery. They claimed to cause a heat-producing nuclear reactionusing conditions considered to be impossible. Nevertheless, initially the mediapromoted the idea of cheap energy made by a process so simple any high-schoolgraduate could make it work. The energy needs of the world would be solved by aprocess called cold fusion, so the story went.This energy was claimed to result from two deuterons, an isotope of hydrogenpresent in all water, fusing to produce a huge amount of energy and severalother elements, all in a simple electrolytic cell. The expensive, long-promised,and largely unsuccessful effort using high-temperature plasma, called hotfusion, would no longer be necessary. The use of oil and coal, sources ofpollution and environmental problems, would be a concern for history toevaluate. Initially, these claims were exciting, but they quickly became toohard for many people to believe when replication turned out not to be as easy aspromised and the consequences of the claims sank in. The threat to thehot-fusion program and the oil industry became all too obvious. Besides, no onecould explain how such a process could actually work. These two issues combinedto produce a perfect storm of rejection.Very soon after the announcement, several books were written describing thewhole idea as pathological science. These books laid the groundwork forrejection, along with help from several respected scientific publications, asthe following examples show. Gary Taubes7 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt137] is ascience writer who was intent on promoting his hopefully popular book called BadScience: The Short Life and Weird Times of Cold Fusion. To help the process, hecreated a totally unsupported scandal about data being falsified at Texas A&MUniversity.8 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt138] The publication Science supportedthis spurious accusation without apologies or explanation, even after the claimwas shown to be false.9 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt139] As a result, reputationswere damaged while misinformation spread to a growing number of scientists. JohnHuizenga, a respected scientist chosen by the U.S. government to evaluate thesubject, showed his skepticism in his book, Cold Fusion: The Scientific Fiascoof the Century, published in 1992.10 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt140] Thewell-known scientific journal Nature helped promote this attitude, thanks to itseditor at the time, John Maddox.11 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt141] Frank Close,another respected scientist, added to the climate of rejection with the book TooHot to Handle.12 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt142] In contrast, a balanced andhonest book by Eugene Mallove titled Fire from Ice: Searching for the Truthbehind the Cold Fusion Furor was largely ignored.13[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt143] Many more books14,[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt144] 15, [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt145] 16,[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt146] 17, [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt147] 18,[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt148] 19, [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt149] 20,[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt150] 21, [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt151] 22,[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt152] 23, [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt153] 24[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt154] have been written over the years, manysupporting the original claims for unusual nuclear reactions while takingdifferent points of view. The Discovery Channel, the History Channel, and 60Minutes produced accurate and supportive program segments. Gradually, popularopinion is moving in favor of cold fusion, but not before twenty years waswasted in active rejection.Influential individuals also played important roles. Douglas Morrison25[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt155]added to the general rejection by writing aregular newsletter from his post at CERN (European Organization for NuclearResearch). He maintained his negative attitude until his death, even though heattended conferences about the subject and talked to many researchers. To hiscredit, he gave an informed evaluation, but one based on a deeply held certaintythat a claim for such a nuclear reaction was completely wrong. In contrast,Robert Park apparently made no effort to understand the subject and occasionallyrejects the idea by ridicule in his popular weekly newsletter.26,[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt156] 27 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt157] Nathan Lewis,a professor at the California Institute of Technology at the time, used a flawedand failed attempt at replication to fan the growing antagonism among physicistsat an early American Physics Society meeting in Baltimore.28[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt158]This set the stage for rejection by the general physics community. Other lessvisible individuals took turns rejecting the idea, a process that continues tothis day, but with less frequency. I mention these few examples to show howhubris and the arrogant certainty of certain individuals can influence the viewof reality accepted by a large number of people—even scientists. This is not tosay that skepticism is unimportant. Some claims and ideas are worthy ofrejection. It’s the intensity of the rejection that causes trouble, especiallywhen such enthusiasm is based largely on ignorance. Such ignorance concerningcold fusion is no longer excusable thanks to accurate information now availableon the Internet. (Please see this chapter’s listings in the Additional Resourcessection for more information.)To my knowledge, none of the people who were publicly outspoken in theirrejection of the claims have changed their minds based on the new and morecomplete information. Skepticism seems to be a one-way process that never admitsof being wrong.Much skepticism was fueled by a lack of theory to explain the observations andan apparent conflict with accepted theories. Apparently, professional scientistsneed to be reminded that theory should not be substituted for reality, only usedas a temporary and imperfect map. A hundred years hence, theories we presentlytake for granted will look simpleminded—just as theories accepted a hundredyears ago now look to us. All new ideas may seem to be improbable when based oncurrently accepted models, but such is the nature of new ideas. People forgetthat our presently accepted ideas were once new and initially rejected. Thesolution is patience rather than dogmatic rejection when new ideas are proposed.The debate ended as far as the U.S. government was concerned, in 1990, with awidely circulated report from the Energy Research Advisory Panel.29[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt159] Its rush to judgment was made before the claimscould be properly explored. Even worse, the group was cochaired by JohnHuizenga, whose bias was later revealed in his book. The other cochair, JohnRamsey, forced adoption of a more objective conclusion only by threatening toresign. Nevertheless, cold fusion was officially accepted as nonsense. From thattime, no government or corporate support for research would be forthcoming inthe United States. All patents that went through the nuclear division of theU.S. patent office were routinely rejected regardless of objective evidence.Nevertheless, patents were obtainable in other countries. Sorting out the manyapplications will be a major headache once our government accepts thephenomenon. Eneco, a company created to advance the field, spent over 1 milliondollars in a futile effort to have the original Fleischmann-Pons patent andother patents granted in the United States. Partly as a result, the companyrecently went bankrupt, with a total loss to its courageous investors. Thisrejection by the U.S. government continued until recent times, with a fewexceptions. The Department of Energy even made a second review in 2004 and cameto the same but less extreme position.30, [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt160] 31[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt161] In contrast, the U.S. Navy and the DefenseAdvanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) have both shown independent judgment.Only recently has the U.S. government shown modest interest even as work inother countries has accelerated. Once again, we need to ask why the U.S.government would reject a potentially ideal energy source whose benefits to itscitizens could be huge. Perhaps a lack of benefit to the oil and coal industriessuggests an answer.Scientific journals are essential to science because they allow a free flow ofinformation, the lifeblood of advances in knowledge. Most scientists will notaccept information that has not been reviewed by their peers and made availablein one of these sources. Presumably, they don’t view themselves as capable ofdetermining whether information is believable without such certification. Mostconventional journals would not accept a paper supporting cold fusion becausethe editors and peer reviewers thought “the evidence is not compelling,” asphysicists like to say. A few reviewers were less polite. Of course, papersshowing why the effect could not possibly work or that showed a failure toreplicate results were published. One important exception was Fusion Technologyunder the editorship of George Miley, of the University of Illinois, whopersisted despite many efforts to have him fired because of his open-mindedapproach to the subject.This lack of access to most scientific journals stopped new information fromchanging the initial negative impression about cold fusion. As a result, popularopinion split into two camps—those who accepted the initial negative responseand never looked back and those who continued to do research and shareinformation. If a person was identified as a believer, no evidence from thatperson would be accepted by a skeptic. Apparently, believers were considered tooirrational and blinded by their beliefs to be taken seriously by a normalperson. Consequently, the “believers” used the Internet to communicate and heldregular conferences in various countries. These conferences began in Salt LakeCity in 1990 with the First International Conference on Cold Fusion (ICCF-1).Each subsequent conference was held in a different city and often in a differentcountry.The Fifteenth International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science(ICCF-15) was held in Rome, Italy, in 2009, under the sponsorship of the Italianscientific societies and the Italian National Agency for New Technologies(ENEA), a government run laboratory. Most of the published proceedings areavailable and contain a treasure trove of information. A few other conferenceson the subject are regularly held in Italy, Russia, and Japan, independent ofthe ICCF series. These meetings allow exchanges of information and a way forpapers to be made available in published proceedings without interference fromthe general negative attitude. Recently, papers have been presented at regularAmerican Physical Society and American Chemical Society conferences and havebeen published in the American Chemical Society and American Institute ofPhysics symposium series. An online peer-reviewed journal called Journal ofCondensed Matter Nuclear Science, with Jean-Paul Biberian of the Université dela Méditerranée in France as editor, is currently accepting papers on thesubject. As a result, facts are gradually seeping into the consciousness ofmainstream science.A few countries did not stop exploring cold fusion after the general rejection,and some individuals in the United States continued research in private oruniversity laboratories using their own money or support from a few wealthyfriends. The Japanese government supported a large program, New Hydrogen Energy,designed to determine whether the effect had commercial application, andTechnova in Japan supported ongoing work by Fleischmann and Pons in France.Later, Japanese companies supported important work by Michael McKubre at SRIInternational in the United States when other resources failed. Although theseefforts eventually terminated, the information and experience gained fertilizedongoing work at several universities and companies in Japan. Work in Italy alsogradually grew into a large program supported by the major scientific societies.Studies are also underway and growing in China and Russia. Even the U.S.government is showing a long-delayed interest. Unfortunately, this increasedawareness is coming at a time when financial support for new ideas, howeverimportant, is harder to find. For example, although a company in Israel hasreported success in making energy with increased reproducibility, it hasrecently lost its funding.32 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt162]HOW DOES FUSION WORK?What is this strange effect that has caused so much controversy? An answerrequires some background and technical information I will try to provide.Nuclear interaction between nuclei is prevented because all nuclei repel eachother, thanks to each having a positive charge. This creates what is called theCoulomb barrier to direct nuclei interaction. The larger the atomic number, thegreater is the charge and the barrier. The three isotopes of hydrogen (protium,deuterium, and tritium) have the smallest barrier, each with a charge of 1. Thisrelatively small barrier gives hydrogen nuclei an advantage in entering intonuclear reactions with each other or with more highly charged nuclei. Reactionscan be made to occur between nuclei if they are caused to smack into each otherwith enough force. This force can be applied either by heating them to a veryhigh temperature in plasma (over 1 million degrees) or accelerating them invarious ways. This method is called hot fusion. The resulting reaction generatestritium and neutrons, both of which are dangerous and make the apparatusradioactive, hence expensive to repair.In contrast, cold fusion uses solid materials containing deuterium as theenvironment in which the nuclear reactions can occur. This allows fusion andother nuclear reactions to be initiated at room temperature without extra energybeing necessary. However, special solid materials are needed that,unfortunately, are created at the present time by lucky chance. Work is underwayto identify these materials and purposefully make them in large amounts. Thismethod generates mostly helium, identical to the gas used in balloons, withoutsignificant radioactivity. Furthermore, the process is easy and safe to study,an advantage I personally appreciate.WHAT IS THE STATUS OF HOT FUSION AND OTHER ENERGY SOURCES?The conventional method, called hot fusion, has been explored for the last sixtyyears and has consumed at least 25 billion dollars in 2009 dollars, withoutproducing any useful energy. Lots of energy is generated, but not enough to runthe huge machine and have any left over. In fact, even if current problems weresolved, the machine probably would be too complex and expensive to producepractical power. A picture of the last version, scheduled for construction inFrance, is shown in figure 11.1. Even this research tool is proving to be tooexpensive, leaving further construction in doubt.33,[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt163] 34 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt164] Forcomparison, a photo of Fleischmann and Pons holding one of their cold fusioncells is shown in figure 11.2. Both of these devices are used only for research,requiring much larger versions, in both cases, to generate commercial power.Nevertheless, at this stage, the study of cold fusion is obviously much lessexpensive than further exploration of hot fusion.Unfortunately, without this or a similar substitute for conventional but limitedenergy sources, future civilization is doomed to a much lower standard of livingas these sources run out. This realization encouraged the study of hot fusionover the years despite repeated failure to live up to its promise. Time has nowrun out, and we can no longer wait for hot fusion to succeed. It is now time forPlan B.image [images/9781594775093_051.jpg]Figure 11.1. One version of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor(ITER) hot fusion energy generator. Note the size of a person (circled).Additional large equipment required to run the machine is not shown.image [images/9781594775093_052.jpg]Figure 11.2. Stanley Pons (left) and Martin Fleischmann (right), with their coldfusion cells.For many people Plan B is large-scale development of solar and wind power. Thesesources are quite practical in certain locations, but the power density is low,requiring the use of large tracts of land, sometimes well away from where thepower is needed. In addition, they are not constant sources, frequentlyrequiring backup systems to be constructed at additional expense. A complex andsometimes fragile power distribution system is also required, called the grid. Amore concentrated and reliable source of power is needed. Conventional fissionreactors are such a source, but these are based on splitting uranium into twosmaller parts. Uranium has several disadvantages: the supply is limited, miningproduces local environmental deterioration, the nuclear reactors producedangerous radioactive products requiring long-term storage, and the technologyhas a small but important risk of failure. Furthermore, such reactors can makeplutonium for use in nuclear weapons. Clearly, a better Plan B is needed.WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF COLD FUSION?Cold fusion has the potential to provide energy for many centuries withouttaking over the landscape, as is required for solar or wind power, and withoutthe environmental damage caused by uranium- or carbon-based power. It is safeand cannot be used directly as a weapon. In fact, it is so safe an energygenerator could be placed in each home, eliminating the need for our presentcomplex electrical grid system with its susceptibility to storm-related andother power failures. No more blackouts! The active component, which isdeuterium, can be extracted from any water source very simply and withoutharmful consequences. Heavy water (D2O), which is the form of water containingdeuterium, is presently extracted from ordinary water in large amounts and usedas a cooling fluid in certain fission reactors. This liquid can be purchasedfrom any chemical supply company for about fifty cents per gram in small amountsand for much less in large amounts. It is not dangerous, radioactive, orcontrolled by the government, as is uranium. In short, the source of this energyis as benign as a cup of tea.HOW IS COLD FUSION PRODUCED?Four methods have been found to initiate the fusion reaction using very simpleapparatus. The original method explored by Fleischmann and Pons usedelectrolysis to implant deuterium into a palladium cathode, with many variationsof this method being explored by other people. In this case, electrolysisinvolves passing a current through heavy water between two electrodes, one ofwhich is made of palladium. Deuterium is released at the palladium electrode,where it reacts with the metal to form a palladium-deuterium compound. When thequantity of deuterium becomes sufficiently large, the nuclear reaction starts.Achieving the very high deuterium concentration is the main problem in gettingthe process to work. A typical cell used to measure power production is shown infigure 11.3.image [images/9781594775093_053.jpg]Figure 11.3. Drawing of a calorimeter cell used by Michael McKubre andcolleagues at SRI International. The size is similar to the device held byStanley Pons in figure 11.1.Most of the time nothing special happens, but occasionally significant extraheat is produced when special palladium is used. This power frequently lastslong enough to accumulate more energy than could result from any known chemicalreaction. Hundreds of examples have now been published, some giving power atover one hundred watts from a sample of palladium no larger than a dime in areaand total weight. Eventually, this heat was found to relate almost exactly tothe amount of helium expected to be produced by the d + d = He fusion reaction.In addition, radiation of various kinds is detected that can only result fromnuclear reactions and cannot be mistaken as error. Fortunately, this radiationcannot escape from the device. Work is presently underway to fully characterizethis radiation in order to identify the nuclear process.Work in Russia by Alexander Karabut and coworkers focused on creating adischarge in deuterium gas using no more than a few thousand volts, much too lowto produce significant hot fusion.35 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt165] A nuclearreaction is created on the cathode, resulting in extra heat, helium, and modestradiation. Tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, can also be produced thisway, as discovered by Thomas Claytor and coworkers at LANL, when special cathodematerial is used.36 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt166] This method is moreefficient than hot fusion because it uses much less energy to initiate thefusion process and it results in a benign collection of nuclear products. Animportant advantage is the absence of neutrons, which are dangerous andinconvenient. In other words, the brute force method of using very hightemperatures in plasma is not required when the right conditions are createdusing a special metal after it is reacted with deuterium.We have an interesting situation. Great effort is made during hot fusion toisolate the plasma from the metal walls using complex and very energy-intensivemagnetic fields. Otherwise the walls would be destroyed and the plasma would bedegraded. Both the plasma and the magnetic fields use massive amounts of energysupplied by a complex machine. In contrast, after implanting deuterium in aspecial solid at room temperature, cold fusion achieves the same effect moreefficiently using a simpler machine and produces no radioactive by-product. Inother words, hot fusion avoids the involvement of a solid while cold fusionwelcomes its use.Other methods have greater potential for producing commercial power. Deuteriumcan also be implanted in a solid using sound. When intense sound waves passthrough a liquid, they generate bubbles that repeatedly collapse and reform.When a bubble collapses on a metal surface, a plasma of ions is injected intothe metal at each collapse cycle. This injection of ions produces effectssimilar to those produced when ions are injected by electrolysis or gasdischarge. Rodger W. Stringham has explored this method and found evidence forextra heat and helium production when the liquid is heavy water.37[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt167] This method is in sharp contrast to thedifficult and seldom successful sonofusion or sonoluminescence method. In thatmethod, energy is concentrated within a bubble as it collapses within a liquid,resulting in a burst of light just before it disappears. Various people tried toproduce hot fusion this way and succeeded mainly in creating a controversy.38,[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt168] 39, [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt169] 40[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt170] Once again, the attempt made to use highenergy—brute force—in plasma produces nothing of value. Once again, injectingdeuterium into a solid worked much better.Finally, a method discovered in Japan by Professor Yoshiaki Arata has potentialto produce commercial power with the greatest ease.41,[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt171] 42 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt172] He found thatnano-sized palladium powder or certain alloys of palladium can initiate thefusion reaction if the powder is simply exposed to pressurized deuterium gas.Unfortunately, only a fraction of the material has this ability. The challengenow is to find out where in the sample this special material is located anddetermine its characteristics. In fact, such finely divided material can beidentified as being present during all successful occasions when each of themethods is used. This realization provides one more insight into what makes suchreactions possible.In addition to fusion, other nuclear reactions, called transmutation, are foundto happen at the same time as fusion. This discovery opens a whole newphenomenon of which hundreds of examples have been published. For example,Yasuhiro Iwamura and his coworkers at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan wereable to convert barium into samarium by adding a cluster of six deuterons to thebarium nucleus.43, [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt173] 44[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt174] This process took place in alternating layers ofpalladium and calcium oxide while deuterium was diffusing through the sandwich.The barium had been deposited on the surface, where the transmutation reactionwas observed using X-ray analysis and changes in isotopic composition. Themethod and evidence are too complex to discuss here, but you can be sure thisamazing result has been explored very carefully using very modern methods byseveral other laboratories.This is not the only example of such reactions. Workers in many laboratorieshave reported similar transmutation reactions many times using various targetnuclei to produce a variety of other elements. An example is shown in figure11.4. The platinum (Pt) noted on the figure is not a transmutation productbecause it readily transfers from the platinum anode. In contrast, the otherelements are not expected to be present in the cell. These reactions typicallycreate elements heavier than the palladium target (Pd), but on occasionfragments of these elements are also detected, especially iron (Fe) and titanium(Ti), as seen on the figure.Errors produced by contamination, that is elements that were previously present,and faulty analysis are real but have been carefully evaluated and reduced to aminimum. For hydrogen to enter the nucleus of such highly charged nuclei meansan unknown process must hide the charge on the hydrogen nuclei. Understandinghow this can happen is the essence of the problem cold fusion faces on its pathto acceptance and application.image [images/9781594775093_054.jpg]Figure 11.4. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis of a palladiumrod before and after electrolysis and production of extra energyFor readers predisposed to open-mindedness, you might be interested to knownuclear reactions have also been found to occur in biological life-forms, asfirst documented by C. Louis Kervran over thirty years ago. His claim wasuniversally rejected, and only now has evidence been published to show he wascorrect.45, [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt175] 46 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt176]Recently, H. Komaki in Japan studied a variety of single-celled organisms grownin cultures that were missing certain elements needed for life.47[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt177] The living cells were able to form elements theyneeded to grow using other elements that were present in the culture. These newelements were formed by means of the same type of transmutation reaction foundto occur in cold fusion studies. Vladimir Vysotskii and coworkers, in a seriesof papers48 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt178] and in a book,49[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt179] described how they were able to convertmanganese (Mn55) into iron (Fe57) using bacteria grown in heavy water (D2O)containing manganese sulphate (MnSO4). They used the Mossbauer effect to followthe gradual growth of iron. The Mossbauer effect is sensitive only to thepresence of iron, which leaves very little room for other explanations. Theyfound iron did not form when normal water was used, and it was also absent whenmanganese was absent. Workers in the Ukraine have been exploring this process inorder to convert radioactive elements into stable elements without waiting forthem to become stable by normal radioactive decay.50[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt180] In other words, we may now have a method to getrid of all radioactive contamination created by conventional nuclear reactorsengaged in energy production or from nuclear accidents. If you think theseclaims impossible, may I suggest you read the sources before jumping to hastyconclusions?HOW CAN COLD FUSION BE EXPLAINED?People like explanations, and scientists are especially interested in knowinghow something works before they will fully accept its reality. A wide assortmentof explanations for cold fusion have been proposed, far too many to discusshere. Different branches of science take different approaches when evaluatingobservations. For example, physicists tend to apply mathematical models to idealmaterials. When explaining cold fusion, they use the rules and mathematics ofquantum mechanics to focus energy on the nuclear process or to modify therelationship between nuclei within a perfect arrangement of atoms. Unfortunatelyfor this approach, the atoms are never arranged perfectly and frequently theenvironment is a complex mixture of different elements. A few explanations evenpropose neutrons are involved because this particle can enter a nucleus withoutexperiencing a barrier, thanks to the absence of a nuclear charge. Mostexplanations are useless because they ignore many observed behaviors andrequirements other fields of science impose.I would like to summarize my approach. Everyone agrees energy is required toovercome the Coulomb barrier. This energy must come from the surroundingenvironment. This environment consists of electrons and nuclei arranged in avery definite but perhaps imperfect structure. The energy in this environment isbeing used by the atoms to create this environment and its associatedproperties, and is not available to do anything else. Any change in this energywould change the atomic arrangement and its properties.In other words, Nature arranges the atoms in materials with the greatest economypossible, leaving no energy left over. As Henri Louis Le Chatelier observed,Nature tries to undo any change we attempt to make and always uses the leastpossible energy. Therefore, energy cannot be spontaneously concentrated exceptin small amounts caused by random variations within the structure. Even if anovel process were to concentrate energy, it would cause chemical and physicalchanges in the structure before it could reach levels required to initiate anuclear reaction. Therefore, an energy-concentrating process, or one thatrearranges electrons, cannot work no matter how quantum mechanics is applied.This conclusion has to be an essential part of any explanation for cold fusion.The process must start with the release of energy. This release must involve aprocess that could occur but is blocked by an energy barrier. Many suchprocesses are present in ordinary materials. For example, many materials willreact with oxygen and burn, a process that is prevented by an energy barrier. Inthe case of cold fusion, the process must be sensitive to a rare condition in asolid and produce a reaction product that is able to initiate a nuclearreaction.We now know that this process must produce a cluster of deuterons. What processcan be proposed to have such a requirement? At this point the explanationrequires the existence of a structure not known to science, but hinted at by theproperties of the Rydberg molecule51, [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt181] 52,[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt182] 53 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt183] and theproposed hydrino.54 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt184] Another way of saying thisis to state that a two-step process is required. The first step is a chemicalone and produces a cluster of deuterons in which the nuclear charge is hidden.This structure is able to cause a nuclear reaction as the second step. Bothprocesses release energy. Over four hundred years ago, alchemists called thisunusual nuclear-initiating material the philosopher’s stone. Looks like historymay once again be repeating itself.Considerable imagination is being applied to explain these unexpected nuclearreactions. In the process, a new window into understanding nuclear interactionis being once again opened. Perhaps efforts to understand cold fusion willcreate a whole new field of science. This field is now called condensed matternuclear science, but the name will no doubt change once again as new insightsneed to be described more exactly.WHAT ARE THE DISADVANTAGES OF COLD FUSION?Why did cold fusion cause such a negative reaction? The rational reason is thatthis energy source has the potential to be a very disruptive technology. It putsat risk all other sources of energy because of its low cost, simple design, andlack of harmful by-products. Imagine having an energy generator in every homeable to provide all the energy needed by the household, including energy for theplug-in auto. The grid would be obsolete, along with the large number ofcoal-burning power plants. If the transition were not done properly, a lot ofpeople would lose their jobs and even more people would go broke.Government regulators in the United States and in some other countries wouldregulate a slow introduction, but what about third-world countries? Many poorcountries could quickly have abundant and cheap power available, allowing themto manufacture products at a much lower price. Society would change rapidly,some aspects for the better, while some groups would lose in the process. Tomake the situation worse, people will apply this new energy source to war.Battlefield lasers would become practical more quickly, with deadly consequencesto any army that does not have the technology. Consequently, society had betterunderstand this energy source and apply it with caution because no amount ofskepticism or government ignorance will stop the eventual application and theeasily foreseen consequences.CONCLUSIONSTo summarize, an entirely new phenomenon relating a chemical environment to anuclear reaction has been discovered and rejected prematurely based onself-interest and hubris in some countries and not in others. This process hasthe potential to become an ideal energy source for centuries. However, thetwenty-year delay in exploring the phenomenon leaves many important questionsunanswered. Nevertheless, enough is now known to prove the reality of the effectbut not enough to know how to make power at commercial levels with reliability.The phenomenon has opened new fields of science and technology with unimaginableconsequences.The issue at this time is not whether cold fusion is real or not—its reality hasbeen established beyond doubt. The problem is one of being able to apply theright tools to discover the nature of the material that initiates the nuclearprocess. These tools are available, but they are too expensive to be used at thepresent time without more financial support. Very little progress can beexpected until the necessary resources are made available. The progress tocivilization that new forms of energy offer outweighs the short-term problems offreeing our planet from the destructive effects of current fuel technologies,and they deserve the funding necessary for their development.GLOSSARYAlpha radiation: Emission of a helium nucleus.Anode: Positive electrode during electrolysis.Calorimeter: A device for measuring heat energy.Cathode: Negative electrode during electrolysis.CERN: The European Organization for Nuclear Research.

No one thought it possible for ZPE to offer a source ofunlimited energy for homes, cars, and space travel. Some “experts” still sayzero point energy can do nothing useful. The experimental evidence, however, nowincontrovertibly shows that ZPE is present in measurable quantities in coils andsemiconductors. Furthermore, ZPE can be turned on and off and produce anattractive or repulsive force in one direction, besides moving electrons tocreate electricity flow in a circuit and rectified in semiconductor diodes. Allof these discoveries have been made and published only in the past few years,which indicates that the future energy trend is toward ZPE power.image [images/9781594775093_055.jpg]Figure 12.1. Spiral design for a vacuum fluctuation batteryZero point energy is the sea of energy that pervades all of space and everyatom, often called the physical vacuum. Furthermore, it is estimated to exceednuclear energy densities. But what is it really? It is the nonthermal, “kineticenergy retained by the molecules of a substance at a temperature of absolutezero.”1 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt185] Still, most people maintain their doubtas to whether it can be found to be useful for human energy needs. This includesthe U.S. Department of Energy “Ask a Scientist” official website. Afifteen-year-old submitted a question, “Would Zero-Point Energy be a bettersource of power than Antimatter?” The answers include phrases like “a lousysource of energy,” “no idea how to do this,” “I can’t imagine how it could bepractical,” and “no way to extract the zero point energy from a molecule inorder to use it.”2 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt186]image [images/9781594775093_056.jpg]Figure 12.2. Casimir cavityLooking for a source of ZPE, quantum mechanics tells us, “It is possible to geta fair estimate of the zero point energy using the uncertainty principle alone.”The intimate connection of the average value of ZPE (= ½ hf, where h is Planck’sconstant) to the uncertainty principle is an intellectually satisfying discoveryin the Appendix of the book Zero Point Energy: The Fuel of the Future, by thisauthor.3 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt187]Regarding energy extraction from ZPE, the first barrier to resolve is the hotlycontested question of whether the zero point field (ZPF) is conservative.(Unlike politics, conservative fields in physics are those that conserve energy,thus obeying the first law of thermodynamics.) If ZPE is not conservative, thenwe can extract “an infinite amount of energy” from the vacuum, according to thelate Dr. Robert Forward. However, if it is proven that the ZPF is a conservativefield, we can still extract energy from it. It is just that we would have to putenergy in and store it somehow to get it out again, like Forward’s invention(figure 12.1). “It does reflect work done by the ZPF on matter.”4[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt188]The evidence so far is in favor of a nonconservative ZPF, with arguments stillraging on both sides. In addition, the capability of ZPF storage and retrievalhas convincingly been presented by Forward with his ZPE corkscrew charge devicehe called a vacuum fluctuation battery.5 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt189] Anarticle titled “Energy Unlimited” was published a few years ago when ProfessorJordan Maclay from the University of Illinois received a NASA grant to try toextract ZPE from elongated, oscillating, tiny metal boxes.6[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt190] A physics journal article points out, “Vacuumfluctuations remain a matter of debate, mainly because their energy is infinite.More strikingly, their energy per unit volume is infinite.”7[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt191] Interestingly, this fact has createdintellectual difficulties among physicists that have only been artificiallyeliminated: “Problems with the infinite energy of vacuum fluctuations has led tothe view that vacuum energy may be forced to vanish by definition . . . [from]the need to regularize the infinite energy-momentum tensor.” However, this quickfix causes even more complications. “This procedure gives rise to ambiguitiesand anomalies, which lead to a breakdown at the quantum level of usual symmetryproperties of the energy-momentum tensor.”8 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt192]WHY ATOMS DON’T COLLAPSETo understand how fundamentally real ZPE is for sustaining our reality, it isworthwhile noting that ZPE is fundamentally responsible for atomic stability,much like an “atomic Casimir effect,” according to Margaret Hawton.9[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt193] When I spoke with Dr. Harold Puthoff, from theInstitute for Advanced Studies in Austin, Texas, he described his plans, alongwith Dr. Eric Davis, for measuring the electron levels of a hydrogen atom whileit is in a Casimir cavity (figure 12.2). Puthoff proposed years ago that ZPEdetermines the ground state of hydrogen in the journal Physical Review.Recently, he arranged access to the facilities for testing his theory in aCasimir cavity that restricts the range of frequencies of ZPE around thehydrogen atoms.10 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt194] According to Puthoff, thisshould show depressed or lowered electron levels as a result of less vacuumfluctuation activity of virtual particles that normally supports each electronlevel, in the same way that restricted virtual particle density inside a Casimircavity causes the Casimir force to push inward.A classic New Scientist journal article, with the same article title as thissection, describes this phenomenon in more glorious detail. Zero point energystabilizes the electron in a set ground-state orbit. It seems that the verystability of matter itself appears to depend on an underlying sea ofelectromagnetic zero point energy.11 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt195]LIMITATIONS ON ZERO POINT ENERGYWhile the facts support an unlimited energy plenum for the quantum vacuum, thearguments still support conservative, “right-wing physics.” The actual estimatesof energy density of even the limited ZPF (bounded by a maximum frequency)however are very impressive. For example, if we presume that the minimumpossible wavelength is limited to the size of the proton, Nobel Prize–winningphysicist Dr. Richard Feynman calculated that the energy density of the ZPFwould be ten raised to the 108th power joules per cubic centimeter (10108 J/cc)!Today, physicists want to look at even smaller vibration units like subatomicparticles and so on. This makes the ZPF energy density escalate even more. Incomparison, if we convert energy to mass using E = mc2, we find that theequivalent “mass density” of the ZPF is ten to the ninety-fourth power grams percubic centimeter (1094 g/cc). Compare that with typical nuclear densities of tento the fourteenth power grams per cubic centimeter (1014 g/cc).12[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt196] Therefore, gram for gram, ZPE offers almost tento the eightieth times more energy for the same amount of space as nuclearreactors. Assuming they have the same efficiency, one ZPE engine equals 1080nukes. It can be concluded that empty space contains more energy than matterdoes, for the same volume, even if we convert all of the matter into energy.In a Los Alamos Laboratory, the Casimir force from ZPE was measured (in 1997)for the first time with conductive plates and found to be within 5 percentagreement with theory.13 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt197] At AT&T Bell Labs,Federico Capasso designed a special semiconductor device that will only allowelectrons to resonantly tunnel to the other side of a semiconductor layerbecause of the presence of zero point energy.14 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt198]Zero point energy has been offered as a power source for the advanced energy andpropulsion systems the government supposedly has in classified programs, to“produce vast amounts of energy without any pollution.”15[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt199]New Scientist reported on NASA’s Breakthrough Propulsion Physics First Projectaward to Illinois Professor Jordan Maclay “to study the energy of a vacuum.”16[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt200] In Europe, the University of Leicester, in theVirtual Microscopy Centre and the Nanoscale Interfaces Centre, has put theuniversity in a key position to take a lead in Casimir force measurements innovel geometries. It led to the 2005 award of an €800,000 grant (NANOCASE) fromthe European framework 6 NEST (New and Emerging Science and Technology) programto lead a consortium from three countries (United Kingdom, France, and Sweden).The program will use the ultra-high-vacuum atomic force microscope installed inthe Physics and Astronomy Department under Dr. Chris Binns to makevery-high-precision Casimir force measurements in nonsimple cavities and assessthe utility of the force in providing a method for contactless transmission innanomachines.17 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt201] The NANOCASE grant is thelargest ZPE grant issued in the world so far.image [images/9781594775093_057.jpg]Figure 12.3. Nanoscale seesaw powered by ZPE. Source: Science magazine.THE CONVERSION OF ZPENow to explore the theme of this article, it is argued that the practicalmethods for converting ZPE to electricity are finally emerging. Localized ordistributed electrical energy generation, as a result, looks much more promisingthan ever before. In 2001, Popular Mechanics featured an article talking aboutputting “free energy to work” while moving a nanoscale seesaw (figure 12.3),which activates the Casimir force at distances less than one micron (1,000nm).18 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt202] In 1998, a physicist formerly with theJet Propulsion Laboratory, Fabrizio Pinto (who also worked with Robert Forward),invented and patented a nanoscale ZPE engine that obeys the laws ofthermodynamics and pumps electrons, with the help of a tiny microlaser, justlike an electrical generator. The effect of the microlaser pulses, whichmomentarily radically alters the Casimir force in the engine cavity, far exceedsthe power input.In the event of no other alternative explanations, one should conclude thatmajor technological advances in the area of endless, byproduct-free, free-energyproduction could be achieved.19 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt203]Pinto’s accomplishment has brought much-needed legitimacy to the ZPE conversionarena by proving thermodynamically that electricity generation is the outcome.While presenting his keynote address at the 2006 Second International Conferenceon Future Energy in Washington D.C.,20 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt204] Pintosurprised the audience with details proving that the vacuum has “pressure,density, and substance.” He also emphasized the fact that the vacuum can movephysical objects, such as with the Casimir force. Pinto provoked the issue byasking, “Is empty space really worth nothing?”21 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt205]When a gamma ray decays to a positron and an electron in Wilson cloud chamberexperiments, the tracks left by the particle and antiparticle are clearly seenas they move away from each other with oppositely spinning paths.22[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt206] Yet, the great quantum physicist Paul Diracexplains that in those days, people were very reluctant to postulate theexistence of a new particle, even though they had seen it in the lab.image [images/9781594775093_058.jpg]Figure 12.4. Casimir engineimage [images/9781594775093_059.jpg]Figure 12.5. Electrically rectifying diodes come in nano-size (thin film) andpico-size (molecular).image [images/9781594775093_060.jpg]Figure 12.6. Drawing from Air Force ZPE Patent 5,590,031 by Dr. Frank MeadWhen asked, “Why had experimenters never observed these antiparticles in cloudchambers?” Dirac’s response was that a bias existed against new particles. Thisis very much like the present situation with ZPE. Physicists acknowledge thetheory, publish papers on the subject, with an exponentially increasing numberof papers devoted to the Casimir effect,23 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt207] andstill do not solve the energy crisis. However, the U.S. Air Force patented asimple method for resonantly amplifying certain ZPE frequencies. Dr. Frank Meadproposed resonant dielectric spheres that create lowered beat frequencies thatmay be able to be rectified and perhaps charge a battery (figure 12.6).ZPE research shows today that vacuum fluctuations are present even insemiconductors, coils, and diodes. This is a new direction for development thathas been discovered, which offers hope for a solid-state ZPE generator in everyhome, car, plane, and spaceship. The future will be much more stable, even withenvironmental disasters, since the electricity will not fail along with anyother calamity. The practical devices that have a demonstrated ability forconverting the ZPE non-thermal noise into useful electrical generation usesemiconductors, coils, or diodes, with diodes being the most convenient.SOLID-STATE DIODESIn 1994, J. Smoliner reported, for the first time, resonant tunneling whileapplying no voltage at all to the one-dimensional quantum wells that his teamhad created. They used “anharmonic oscillation” to substitute for zero pointenergy, which they ignored “for simplicity,” though it was powering thetunneling of their electrons in each well. Figure 12.7 shows the remarkableachievement, where the electrons prefer a zero voltage bias for the bestresults.24 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt208]The argument that Zero Point Energy: The Fuel of the Future makes is that thereexists a class of diodes (rectifiers) that operate at “zero bias” (no voltageapplied to make them work) and up into microwave frequencies that are suitablefor generating trickle currents from the zero point energy quantum vacuumbecause of natural nonthermal electrical fluctuations (Johnson noise).image [images/9781594775093_061.jpg]Figure 12.7. Chart from a German research project showing an electron tunnelingthrough a barrier at zero bias voltageFurthermore, there are peer-reviewed journal articles that also show tunnelingat zero voltage (zero bias). Several microwave diodes in the book excerpt alsoexhibit this feature. However, you have to appreciate that the noise level (1/fnoise or Johnson noise) is where ZPE manifests. (See Practical Conversion ofZero-Point Energy: Feasibility Study of the Extraction of Zero-Point Energy fromthe Quantum Vacuum for the Performance of Useful Work for a more rigoroustreatment).25 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt209] Nature has also been helpful sinceJohnson noise in the diode is also generated at the junction itself andtherefore requires no minimum signal to initiate the conduction in onedirection.SUBSTANTIVE EXPERIMENTSThe following U.S. patents are the most significant in ZPE research: Rectifyingthermal electric noise by Charles Brown, Patent 3,890,161, and Patent 4,704,622by Capasso, which actually acknowledge ZPE for their functional nature.Metal-insulator-metal nanodiodes probably will be a popular brand for ZPE usagewith millipore sheet assembly, as Brown suggests.These diodes demonstrate substantive, greater-than-uncertainty generation ofenergy from ZPE. In fact, simple coils do as well, according to the publishedarticles by Roger H. Koch and colleagues.26 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt210] In aseries of experiments from 1980 to 1982, Koch measured voltage fluctuations inresistive wire circuits that are induced by the ZPF. The Koch result is strikingconfirmation of the reality of the ZPF and proves that the ZPF can do real work(creating electricity). Although the Koch experiment detected miniscule amountsof ZPF energy, it shows the principle of ZPF energy circuit effects to be validand opens the door to consideration of means to extract useful amounts ofenergy.Davis and Professor Christian Beck overseas finally woke up to the multiplepapers that Koch published. Davis announced his efforts to obtain Lockheed moneyto fund a replication of Koch’s work.27 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt211] Beckwrote a book on ZPE after he published a paper about dark energy beingmeasurable in the laboratory.28 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt212]Pinto in 1999 and others like the Brown patent make reasonable calculations ofthe predicted energy density of an array of vacuum engines and ZPE diodes, whichare about one kilowatt per square meter and conservatively reach estimates ofhundreds of kilowatts per cubic meter for stacked arrays.CUSTOM-MADE ZERO BIAS DIODESOther diodes that exhibit the ability to rectify electromotive force (EMF)energy include the class of “backward diodes” that operate with zero bias (noexternal power supply input). (See U.S. Patent 6,635,907, Type II interbandheterostructure backward diodes, and also U.S. Patent 6,870,417, Circuit forloss-less diode equivalent.) These have been used in microwave detection fordecades and have never been tested for nonthermal zero point energy fluctuationconversion. There is every reason to presume they include such ZPE radiationconversion in their everyday operation but it is unnoticed with other EMFenergy, being so much larger in amplitude. U.S. Patent 6,635,907 from HRLLaboratories describes a diode with a very desirable, “highly nonlinear portionof the I-V curve near zero bias.” These diodes produce a significant current ofelectrons when microwaves in the gigahertz range are present. Another example isU.S. Patent 5,930,133 from Toshiba, titled Rectifying device for achieving highpower efficiency. They use a tunnel diode in the backward mode so that “theturn-on voltage is zero.” Could there be a better device for small-voltage ZPEfluctuations that don’t like to jump big barriers?A completely passive, unamplified zero bias diode converter/detector formillimeter (GHz) waves was developed by HRL Laboratories in 2006 under a DefenseAdvanced Research Projects Agency contract, using an Sb-based “backward tunneldiode.” It is reported to be a “true zero-bias diode” that does not havesignificant 1/f noise when it is unamplified. It was developed for a “fieldradiometer” to “collect thermally radiated power” (in other words, “nightvision”). The diode array mounting allows a feed from a horn antenna, whichfunctions as a passive concentrating amplifier. The important clue is the “noiseequivalent power” of 1.1 pW per root hertz (picowatts are a trillionth of awatt) and the “noise equivalent temperature difference” of 10K, which indicate asensitivity to Johnson noise, the source of which is ZPE. Perhaps HRLLaboratories will consider adapting the invention for passive zero point energygeneration.29 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt213]Another invention developed in 2005 by the University of California, SantaBarbara, is the “semimetal-semiconductor rectifier” for similar applications, torival the metal-semiconductor (Schottky) diodes that are more commonly known formicrowave detection. These zero bias diodes can operate at room temperature andhave a noise equivalent power of about 0.1 pW but a high “RF-to-DC currentresponsivity” of about 8 A/W (amperes per watt). Most importantly, the inventorsclaim that the new diodes are about 20 dB more sensitive than the best availablezero bias diodes from Hewlett-Packard.30 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt214]There also have been other inventions such as “single electron transistors” thatalso have “the highest signal-to-noise ratio” near zero bias. Furthermore,“ultrasensitive” devices that convert radio frequencies have been invented thatoperate at outer space temperatures (three degrees above zero point: 3°K). Thesedevices are tiny nanotech devices, so it is possible that lots of them could beassembled in parallel (such as an array) to produce ZPE electricity withsignificant power density.31 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt215]MOLECULAR REFRIGERATORSNonthermal ZPE is known to work even at temperatures near zero degrees Kelvin,affecting every particle kinetically in the same manner as thermal energy.Liquid helium stays liquid at microdegrees above absolute zero for this reason.Furthermore, it is well understood that a proposed design for a zero bias dioderectifier circuit that generates electricity from ZPE will also rectify andconvert thermal noise as well. In other words, heat is absorbed and also addspower to these proposed ZPE converters, which cools the space around them.Environmentally, in this age of global warming, what better device to have inevery home and business than a solid-state, self-sustaining refrigeration unitthat generates electricity? That is exactly what has been independentlydiscovered in the molecular arena by Professor Chris Van den Broeck from HasseltUniversity in Belgium.32 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt216] Figure 12.8 is from hisPhysical Review Letters article that shows how such molecules will work. Hedescribes them as a paddlewheel type of model (figure 12.8a), which the realmolecular machine simulates (figure 12.8b). The exciting prediction is that asmall thermal gradient will cause them to work or a mechanical force (0.1piconewtons) will tend to create refrigeration. Thus, molecular refrigeratorsand solid-state ZPE diodes work in the same manner.image [images/9781594775093_062.jpg]Figure 12.8. Molecular refrigerators that transfer heat to rotational energywill also convert ZPE.MOVEMENT FROM NOTHINGEmpty space can set objects in motion, a physicist claims.33[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt217] Motion can be conjured out of thin air,according to a physicist in Israel. Alexander Feigel of the Weizmann Instituteof Science in Rehovot says that objects can achieve speeds of severalcentimeters an hour by getting a push from the empty space of a vacuum.34[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt218]His theory and experiment offer a possible explanation for the acceleratedexpansion of distant galaxies, as well as the motion of fluids.35[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt219] Furthermore, Feigel’s discovery opens the way toharness virtual particles to do useful work by creating propulsion.image [images/9781594775093_063.jpg]Figure 12.9. My lecture slide explaining the Feigel discovery that ZPEconservation of energy can include a propulsive force in the presence of astatic magnetic and electric fieldADDITIONAL ZPE CONVERSION METHODSAnother interesting experiment is the Casimir effect at macroscopic distances,which proposes observing the Casimir force at a distance of a few centimetersusing confocal optical resonators within the sensitivity of laboratoryinstruments.36 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt220] This experiment makes themicroscopic Casimir effect observable and greatly enhanced. Then, any othermodes of conversion for the Casimir force should very well be improved.In general, many of the experimental journal articles refer to vacuum effects ona cavity that is created with two or more surfaces. Cavity quantumelectrodynamics (QED) is a science unto itself. “Small cavities suppress atomictransitions; slightly larger ones, however, can enhance them. When the size ofthe cavity surrounding an excited atom is increased to the point where itmatches the wavelength of the photon that the atom would naturally emit,vacuum-field fluctuations at that wavelength flood the cavity and becomestronger than they would be in free space.”37 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt221]It is also possible to perform the opposite feat. “Pressing zero-point energyout of a spatial region can be used to temporarily increase the Casimirforce.”38 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt222] The materials used for the cavitywalls are also important. It is well known that the attractive Casimir force isobtained from highly reflective surfaces. However, a repulsive Casimir force maybe obtained by considering a cavity built with a dielectric and a magneticplate. The product r of the two reflection amplitudes is indeed negative in thiscase, so that the force is repulsive.”39 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt223] Forparallel plates in general, a “magnetic field inhibits the Casimir effect.”40[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt224] Just these tools alone are probably sufficientto build a simple but effective ZPE transducer. For example, if Forward’scorkscrew ZPE battery (figure 12.1) was oscillated periodically within a cavitywhere the ZPE was pressed out and the Casimir force was increased during onehalf of the cycle, the spring would tend to attract and force electrons out ofthe battery by electrostatic repulsion. Then, during the second half of thecycle, electrons would be drawn back into the battery as the spring relaxed,with the Casimir force decreasing. A simple diode rectifier with zero biasvoltage in the external circuit will rectify this alternating current (AC) andproduce usable electricity. Of course, efficiency calculations and measurementsare needed to ensure the overunity production of energy that costs less toproduce than the energy generated.Forward, who passed away in 2002, said:Before I wrote the paper everyone said that it was impossible to extract energyfrom the vacuum. After I wrote the paper, everyone had to acknowledge that youcould extract energy from the vacuum, but began to quibble about the details.The spiral design won’t work very efficiently. . . . The amount of energyextracted is extremely small. . . . You are really getting the energy from thesurface energy of the aluminum, not the vacuum. . . . Even if it workedperfectly, it would be no better per pound than a regular battery. . . . Energyextraction from the vacuum is a conservative process, you have to put as muchenergy into making the leaves of aluminum as you will ever get out of thebattery. . . . Yes, it is very likely that the vacuum field is a conservativeone, like gravity. But, no one has proved it yet. In fact, there is anexperiment mentioned in my Mass Modification paper (military report on aproposed experiment for an antiproton in a vacuum chamber), which can check onthat.The amount of energy you can get out of my aluminum foil battery is limited tothe total surface energy of all the foils. For foils that one can think ofmaking that are thick enough to reflect ultraviolet light so the Casimirattraction effect works, say 20-nm (70 atoms) thick, then the maximum amount ofenergy you get out per pound of aluminum is considerably less than that of abattery. To get up to chemical energies, you will have to accrete individualatoms using the van der Waals force, which is the Casimir force for single atomsinstead of conducting plates. My advice is to accept the fact that the vacuumfield is probably conservative and invent the vacuum equivalent of thehydroturbine generator in a dam. 41 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt225]To me this was very interesting advice, for someone like me just starting out invacuum engineering in the 1990s. Forward is probably the first physicist to giveconsiderable thought to the subject of this book, so he deserves somerecognition for being a pioneer of ZPE applications. As it turns out, the spiraldesign is more of a battery than a generator. Also, the mounting evidence forthe ZPF is weighing heavily in favor of being a nonconservative field. Thismeans the experts are finding more ways to extract energy from ZPE withoutputting energy in first.CASIMIR ENGINEThe Casimir force presents a fascinating exhibition of the power of the ZPF,offering about one atmosphere of pressure when plates are less than one micronapart. As is the case with magnetism today, it has not been immediately obvious,until recently, how a directed Casimir force might be cyclically controlled todo work. The optically controlled vacuum energy transducer of figure 12.4,however, proposed by Pinto presents a powerful theoretical invention for rapidlychanging the Casimir force by a quantum surface effect, excited by photons, tocomplete an engine cycle and thus transfer a few electrons. The convincing partof Pinto’s invention is the quantum mechanics and thermodynamics that he bringsto the analysis, offering a conclusive engine for free energy production.Pinto’s company, Interstellar Technologies Corporation(www.Interstellartechcorp.com [http://www.Interstellartechcorp.com]), isdedicated to “turning quantum vacuum engineering into a commercially viableactivity.”42 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt226]image [images/9781594775093_064.jpg]Figure 12.10. Microdisk one micron in diameterPinto uses mechanical forces from the Casimir effect and a change of the surfacedielectric properties to intimately control the abundance of virtual particles.Basically, it is an optically controlled vacuum energy transducer. A movingcantilever or membrane is proposed to cyclically change the active volume of thechamber as it generates electricity with a thermodynamic engine cycle. Theinvention proposes to use the Casimir force to power the microcantilever beamproduced with standard micromachining technology. The silicon structure may alsoinclude a microbridge or micromembrane instead, all of which have a naturaloscillation frequency on the order of a free-carrier lifetime in the samematerial.The invention is based on the cyclic manipulation of the dimensions of theCasimir cavity created between the cantilever and the substrate. Thesemiconducting membrane is the cantilever, which could be on the order of 50 to100 microns in size, with a few-micron thickness in order to obtain a resonantfrequency in the range of 10 kHz, for example.Two monochromatic lasers are turned on, thereby increasing the Casimir force byoptically changing the dielectric properties of the cantilever. There is afrequency dependence of a dielectric constant that can vary with frequency by afew orders of magnitude, but inversely proportional to the frequency. This meansthat as the frequency goes up, the dielectric constant may go down.Pinto’s proactive approach is to excite a particular frequency mode in thecavity. In doing so, an applied electrostatic charge increases as the cantileveris pulled toward the adjacent substrate by the Casimir force. Bending thecharged cantilever on a nanoscale, the Casimir attractive force is theoreticallybalanced with opposing electrostatic forces, in the same way as Forward’s“parking ramp,” seen in other chapters.Analysis of the Casimir engine cycle (see ZeroPoint Energy: Fuel of the Futurefor analysis) demonstrates its departure from hydroelectric, gaseous, orgravitational systems. For example, the Casimir pressure always acts opposite tothe gas pressure of classical thermodynamics and the energy transfer that causesdielectric surface changes “does not flow to the virtual photon gas.” Alteringphysical parameters of the device, therefore, can change the total work done bythe Casimir force, in contrast to gravitational or hydroelectric systems. Uniqueto the quantum world, the type of surface and its variation with opticalirradiation is a key to the transducer operation. Normally, changing thereflectivity of a surface will affect the radiation pressure on the surface butnot the energy density of the real photons. However, in the Casimir force case,Pinto explains, “The normalized energy density of the radiation field of virtualphotons is drastically affected by the dielectric properties of all mediainvolved via the source-free Maxwell equations.”Specifically, Pinto discovered that the absolute value of the vacuum energy canchange “just by causing energy to flow from a location to another inside thevolume V.” This finding predicts a major breakthrough in use of a quantumprinciple to create a transducer of vacuum energy. Some concerns are usuallyraised, as mentioned previously, with whether the vacuum energy is conserved. Inquantum systems, if the parameters (boundary conditions) are held constant, theCasimir force is strictly conservative in the classical sense, according toPinto. “When they are changed, however, it is possible to identify closed pathsalong which the total work done by this force does not vanish.”To conclude the energy production analysis, it is noted by Pinto that 10,000cycles per second are taken as a performance limit. Taking the lower estimate of100 erg/cm2 per cycle, power or “wattage” is calculated to be about 1 kW/m2,which is about the same as photovoltaic energy production. However, thisinvention will work twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week and is notdependent on the sun. The single cantilever transducer is expected to produceabout 0.5 nW and establish a millivolt across a kilo-ohm load, which is stillfairly robust for such a tiny machine.The basis of the dielectric formula starts with Pinto’s analysis that the Drudemodel of electrical conductivity is dependent on the mean electron energy andestimated to be in the range of submillimeter wavelengths. The Drude model,though classical in nature, is often used for comparison purposes in Casimircalculations. The detailed analysis by Pinto shows that carrier concentrationsand resistivity contribute to the estimate of the total dielectric permittivityfunction value, which is frequency dependent. The frequency dependence is ofincreasing concern for investigations into the Casimir effects on dielectrics. Ahigher-frequency laser may have significantly different effects than an infraredlaser, for example.Another suggested improvement to the original invention could involve afemtosecond or attosecond pulse from a disk-shaped semiconductor microlaser,such as those developed by Bell Laboratories (figure 12.10). The microlasercould be used in close proximity to the cantilever assembly. Such microlaserstructures, called microdisk lasers, measuring 2 microns across and 100 nmthick, have been shown to produce coherent light radially. An optimum choice oflaser frequency would be to tune it to the impurity ionization energy of thesemiconductor cantilever. In this example, the size would be approximatelycorrect for the micron-sized Casimir cavity, according to the research that Ihave done investigating this invention.Pinto chooses to neglect any temperature effects on the dielectric permittivity.However, since then, the effect of finite temperature has been found to beintimately related to the cavity edge choices that can cause the Casimir energyto be positive or negative. Therefore, the contribution of temperature varianceand optimization of the operating temperature seems to have become a parameterthat should not be ignored. Also supporting this view is the evidence that thedielectric permittivity has been found to also depend on the derivative of thedielectric permittivity with respect to temperature.The microfabrication task for the Casimir engine includes mounting microlasersinside the Casimir cavity and ensuring that an extended or continuous 10-KHzrepetition rate is possible with a moving cantilever by addressing the expectedlifespan. It is worth mentioning in support of Pinto that similar cantilevers,made from silicon of the same micron size, with only one support end, nowoperate in many new automobiles as acceleration and crash sensors, without highfailure rates. The energy production rate for the Casimir engine is predicted tobe fairly robust (0.5 nW per cell or 1 kW/m2), which could motivate a dedicatedresearch and development project in the future. However, the Casimir engineproject of Pinto’s appears to be a million-dollar investment at best, which isto be expected for something so revolutionary. Pinto’s business plan probablyaddresses the full-scale production costs and projected payback.Using some of the latest cavity QED techniques, such as mirrors, resonantfrequencies of the cavity vs. the gas molecules, quantum coherence, vibratingcavity photon emission, rapid change of refractive index, spatial squeezing,cantilever deflection enhancement by stress, and optimized Casimir cavitygeometry design, the Pinto invention may be improved substantially. The processof laser irradiation of the cavity, for example, could easily be replaced withone of the above-mentioned quantum techniques for achieving the same variabledielectric and Casimir force effect, with less hardware involved. At the presentstage of theoretical development, the Pinto device receives a moderate rating offeasibility. Its overall energy quality rating, in my opinion, is very high.WHAT LIES BENEATH THE VOID—NANOCASE PROJECTA cursory summary of some of the physics behind the ZPE effects is now presentedfor the nontechnical audience. A more detailed, rigorous review is to be foundin my feasibility study called Practical Conversion of Zero-Point Energy(available from Amazon). Let’s begin with a look at a British development calledNANOCASE that supports ZPE research on a very significant budget scale. Itsimply looks for better measurements of the Casimir force (see next section,“Casimir Force”), which is a start in the right direction. Professor Chris Binns(physics and astronomy) at the University of Leicester received European fundingin 2005 for an exciting project to measure the force of zero point energy.The e-bulletin story from the United Kingdom on NANOCASE and Binn has thesubtitle “Exciting Project Connected to the ‘Zero- Point Energy’ of Space.”While NANOCASE is the largest ZPE grant so far, the details of the Casimirforce, including its positive-to-negative force reversal, have already beenworked out by Dr. Jordan Maclay with a NASA grant years ago (discussed in detailin the book Zero Point Energy: The Fuel of the Future). It is true that thereplication and verification of previously theorized results will advance thisscience, even if only by a snail’s pace.image [images/9781594775093_065.jpg]Figure 12.11. Lecture slide explaining the million-dollar grant for zero pointenergy researchCASIMIR FORCEIt is only appropriate and fitting that the actual simple-but-elegant equationfor the Casimir force is also included (figure 12.12). It depends on threeconstants (Planck’s constant, pi, and the speed of light, where h = h/2) and, ofcourse, the distance L between the plates. There are very few relationships innature that depend on the fourth power, but here we see one. This causes all ofthe problems of stiction, with such a dramatic increase in the force as theseparation distance L gets really tiny. However, the gecko is happy since thiseffect lets him stick to any surface (even the Science Channel recently showed alive gecko in a lab and a close-up of the tiny hairs on its feet, which theyrelated to van der Waals forces).image [images/9781594775093_066.jpg]Figure 12.12. The Casimir force equation producing attractionZERO POINT ENERGY BASICSMax Planck, a Nobel Prize winner, corrected his mistake by introducing a secondradiation law that made all the difference in the world. Seen in all of itsglory in figure 12.13, the important point for nonspecialists is the circledquantity ½ hf. This is the mysterious average of zero point energy when lookedat with quantum mechanics. I say “mysterious” because it is exactly half of whatphysicists normally call a quantum. For example, Planck’s quantum frequencyequation, E = hf, gives a clear indication of the quantum units of hf that arepresent in an atom (with any multiples also allowed by the same equation).However, this is nature that determined the average, and it is also proven orderived from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.image [images/9781594775093_067.jpg]Figure 12.13. Max Planck’s second radiation law that ushered in the modern ageof zero point energy, exactly matching the “ black body radiation curve”ORDER OUT OF CHAOSMankind has spent a century nurturing the dead remains of dinosaur fossils forfuel and also reaping the archetypal baggage associated with such morbidnecrophilia. Now that we are realizing our actions will seriously impact theplanetary inhabitants for another century to come, it is time to look to a morevital energy source. As an alternative, it can be argued that ZPE is a livingenergy in the broad sense of the word. The ZPF breathes life into every atom,sustaining its size and shape, and it certainly is renewable. Further insightscan be gained from the chaotic activity that is at the core of the ZPF. Studyingchaos theory, one learns about “strange attractors,” “islands of stability,” and“order out of chaos.” In fact, the Nobel Prize winner Ilya Prigogine wrote abook with the title Order Out of Chaos, which is an excellent discourse on thetopic of this section.43 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt227] When faced withnonlinear chaotic systems like the ZPF, Prigogine makes the case that suchsystems will often find stability “far from equilibrium.” With such acounter-intuitive notion, supported by many specific examples in nature,Prigogine explains the title of his book by saying,“At all levels, be it the level of macroscopic physics, the level offluctuations, or the microscopic level, nonequilibrium is the source of order.Nonequilibrium brings ‘order out of chaos.’”44 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt228]He also delves into an excellent discussion of entropy and the second law ofthermodynamics. Prigogine also explains irreversibility with a rediscovery ofthe fluctuation-dissipation theorem, without apparently knowing about H. B.Callen’s earlier publication. “Intrinsic irreversibility is the strongestproperty: it implies randomness and instability.”45[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt229] Thus we have another fundamental description ofZPE from chaos theory, which also includes a description of the amplification offluctuations as well.46 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt230] Extracting energy fromZPE has just become easier, in so many ways, so that our future will be muchbrighter and offer much more freedom for everyone.CONCLUSIONSRecently, a single nanowire of silicon 300 nm wide has been proven by CharlesLieber from Harvard University to absorb light and create electricity. Inresponse, Phaedon Avouris, a fellow at IBM Research, said, “There has been a lotof talk recently about making independent nanomachines and nanosystems. Theissue has always been, how are you going to power them? If you want to have anindependent nanosystem that’s self-contained, that’s not plugged into a centralpower supply, then you need something like this.”47[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt231] The same can be said for zero point energyconverters, which surprisingly work best and with the most power density, as Dr.Frank Mead pointed out, when made very small.GLOSSARYFollowing are terms that are used throughout the article:Casimir force: A force attributed to zero point energy fluctuations that isusually attractive and measured between two parallel plates or any two parallelsurfaces that come closer than 1 micron apart (1 millionth of a meter). It isthe force that keeps a gecko attached to a wall and most insects as well.Diodes: The solid-state device that is able to send electrical current in onedirection only (DC), even if the input is AC electricity, accomplishing“rectification” of the input.Energy: The capacity for doing work. Equal to power exerted over time (e.g.,kilo-watt-hours). It can exist in linear or rotational form and is quantized inthe ultimate part. It may be conserved or not conserved, depending on the systemconsidered. Mostly, all terrestrial manifestations can be traced to solarorigin, except for zero point energy.Lamb shift: A shift (increase) in the energy levels of an atom, regarded as aStark effect due to the presence of the zero point field. Its explanation markedthe beginning of modern quantum electrodynamics.Nanoscale: A small scale of measurement related to nanotechnology (10-9 meters)that is a thousand times smaller than a micron and a source of great innovationtoday in machines and materials (e.g., carbon nanotubes).Planck’s constant: The fundamental basis of quantum mechanics that provides themeasure of a quantum (h = 6.6 Ã— 10-34 joule-seconds); it is also the ratio ofthe energy to the frequency of a photon.Quantum electrodynamics: The quantum theory of light as electromagneticradiation, in wave and particle form, as it interacts with matter. Abbreviated“QED.”Quantum vacuum: A characterization of empty space by which physical particlesare unmanifested or stored in negative energy states. Also called the physicalvacuum.Uncertainty principle: The rule or law that limits the precision of a pair ofphysical measurements in complementary fashion (e.g., the position and momentum,or the energy and time), forming the basis for zero point energy.Virtual particles: Physically real particles emerging from the quantum vacuumfor a short time, determined by the uncertainty principle. This can be a photonor other particle in an intermediate state that, in quantum mechanics(Heisenberg notation), appears in matrix elements connecting initial and finalstates. Energy is not conserved in the transition to or from the intermediatestate. Also known as a virtual quantum.Zero point energy: The nonthermal, ubiquitous kinetic energy (averaging 1/2 hf)that is manifested even at zero degrees Kelvin, abbreviated as “ZPE.” Alsocalled vacuum fluctuations, zero point vibration, residual energy, quantumoscillations, the vacuum electromagnetic field, virtual particle flux, and,recently, dark energy.Zitterbewegung: An oscillatory motion of an electron, exhibited mainly when itpenetrates a voltage potential, with frequency greater than 1,021 Hz. It can beassociated with pair production (electron-positron) when the energy of thepotential exceeds 2 mc2 (m = electron mass). Also generalized to represent therapid oscillations associated with zero point energy."},{"pageContent":"AFTERWORDBrian O’Leary, Ph.D.EDITOR’S NOTE: Many of us have profoundly felt the loss of Brian O’Leary and hispassionate voice on behalf of new energy technologies and the role they can playin radically transforming our planet, halting environmental pollution, andallowing the rise of poor nations who, without access to free energy, havelittle hope of escaping poverty. Although Brian and I never met, I’ve missed ourmany e-mail exchanges on a wide range of shared interests. It seems appropriateto end Infinite Energy Technologies with Brian’s wise counsel. May we all heedhis words. —Finley Eversole, Ph.D.SUPPORT IS NEEDED—NOT DENIAL AND SUPPRESSIONSay you felt that practical free energy might be possible—and you don’t have tobe a believer at the outset—would you support the R and D, would you ignore it,or would you want to suppress it in order to protect your own current interests?Are you ready to let go of the past and join the dedicated evolutionary energyteam? Are you ready to become a hero who might risk wealth and reputation? Thechoice is yours. And make no mistake, you will choose either by your action orinaction. This is your moment of choice.I am happy to see Mongolia and other nations committing to socially andenvironmentally sustainable programs like the Exemplar Zero Initiative. The truepurpose of governments should be to protect and enhance the lives of theirpeople and ecosystems, to support buen vivir (good living) for generations tocome.The global economic and political landscape is shifting rapidly into a moremultipolar world as the one remaining superpower, the United States, declinesunder its own economic weight and its overextended military hegemony.There is good news and bad news about this development. On the one hand,nations, regions, and municipalities now have the opportunity to become moreindependent from international corporate and governmental pressures throughsustainable innovation. On the other hand, the temptation to allow multinationalcorporations to exploit nonrenewable resources for export becomes ever greateras developing countries seek short-term economic gain so they can service debtsand enhance infrastructure and social programs.1 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt232]This approach is a losing proposition in the long run. What happens when ourresources and ecosystems are depleted in the wake of such shortsighted thinking?Unfortunately, most corporations and governments measure their performance basedon quarterly profits and the terms of elective political office and not onlong-term time horizons like the Native Americans’ planning seven generationsahead.A prime example of this dynamic is Ecuador, where I live. The story of Ecuadoris the familiar story of numerous countries that have depended on the temporaryexport of oil, gas, minerals, and lumber to sustain their economies.Chevron-Texaco is responsible for leaving behind massive and devastating amountsof toxic waste in the Ecuadorian Amazon, resulting in what is the largestenvironmental lawsuit in world history, with claims of $27 billion in damagesfor the diseases and wrongful deaths of thousands of people living in the area.2[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt233] The threat to the environment posed by imminentoil drilling in the western Amazon region is extremely serious and widespread,with over one hundred leased “oil blocks” embracing much of the rain forests ofEcuador, Peru, Colombia, Brazil, and Bolivia.3 [9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt234]To its credit, the government of Ecuador proposed keeping the oil in the groundin one oil block in the biodiverse rain forest of Yasuni National Park if theinternational community were to match funds to cover potential lost revenues.4[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt235] That’s a good start, but it isn’t enough. Eightypercent of the Ecuadorian and Peruvian Amazon is earmarked for oil and gasdrilling, with associated road building and deforestation.Currently, one-third of Ecuador’s total revenues come from petroleum exports.Some of us are proposing that these revenues be replaced by income from newenergy technologies, sustainable agriculture, medicinal herbs from the rainforest, innovative water treatment, ecotourism, health tourism, and theacquisition of conservation land trusts through carbon credits and gifts.5[9781594775093_nts.xhtml#nt236]We firmly believe that an open acceptance of innovation has the potential togenerate sufficient income so that Ecuador can leave the rain forest and itsindigenous peoples alone while creating economic sovereignty for itself. Wepropose that innovation sanctuaries be established, protected by the government,to allow researchers and entrepreneurs to do the necessary R and D on theirtechnologies, the most promising of which would be implemented.The biggest global challenge we face is to cocreate from an altruisticperspective those social, political, and economic systems to foster the neededsystemic changes in our governments and corporations. So far, we’ve been fallingway short of the mark in all respects.But we’re going to need resources to begin the task.This is an invitation to those of you who feel the call to redirect yourabundant resources accumulated from an oil economy to alternative energy andother solutions that are truly clean and sustainable, to put your petrodollarsto work, and to make your great-grandchildren proud of you. As Nelson Mandelasaid: “Sometimes it falls upon a generation to be great.”Ours is the generation that must be great.Make no mistake: we’re in the midst of an evolution of consciousness. We cancocreate a planet that works for everyone. We can redirect success from profitand pollution to true sustainability. We can reactivate an eden in which our newfertile crescents and restored ecosystems grow and grow while we give back tothe Earth rather than take from it.Technology can provide elegant answers to our desperate quandary, but the Takerculture has effectively blocked these solutions because of the greed of the fewand the ignorance of the many, and so we find ourselves on a sinking ship. We’vebeen denying the best possibilities because of economic self-interest, the fearof the unknown, and a fundamental reluctance to embrace bold new possibilitiesthat await us if only we have a closer look.Will we collectively shift the paradigm by introducing clean breakthroughenergy, pure and abundant water, and the best quality of life for all of us?It’s up to each of you to choose to do so fearlessly with love and compassionfor all creation. You are the answer to the question. You are the points ofconscious evolution.I’d like to leave you with a quotation from what you can gather is one of mytrue heroes, Buckminster Fuller: “If the success or failure of this planet, andof human beings, depended on how I am and what I do, how would I be? What wouldI do?”"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX ATHE FOUR OCCUPATIONS OF PLANET EARTHTom EngelhardtNOTE: This article was previously published on December 19, 2011, on theTomDispatch blog and is reprinted by permission of the author. All rights arereserved.On the streets of Moscow in the tens of thousands, the protesters chanted, “Weexist!” Taking into account the comments of statesmen, scientists, politicians,military officials, bankers, artists, all the important and attended-to figureson this planet, nothing caught the year more strikingly than those two wordsshouted by massed Russian demonstrators.“We exist!” Think of it as a simple statement of fact, an implicit demand to betaken seriously (or else), and undoubtedly an expression of wonder, verging on aquestion: “We exist?”And who could blame them for shouting it? Or for the wonder? How miraculous itwas. Yet another country long immersed in a kind of popular silence suddenlyfinds voice, and the demonstrators promptly declare themselves not about toleave the stage when the day—and the demonstration—ends. Who guessed beforehandthat perhaps fifty thousand Muscovites would turn out to protest a riggedelectoral process in a suddenly restive country, along with crowds in St.Petersburg, Tomsk, and elsewhere from the south to Siberia?In Tahrir Square in Cairo, they swore, “This time we’re here to stay!”Everywhere this year, it seemed that they—“we”—were here to stay. In New YorkCity, when forced out of Zuccotti Park by the police, protesters returnedcarrying signs that said, “You cannot evict an idea whose time has come.”And so it seems, globally speaking. Tunis, Cairo, Madrid, Madison, New York,Santiago, Homs. So many cities, towns, places. London, Sana’a, Athens, Oakland,Berlin, Rabat, Boston, Vancouver . . . it could take your breath away. And asfor the places that aren’t yet bubbling—Japan, China, and elsewhere—watch out in2012 because, let’s face it, “we exist.”Everywhere, the “we” couldn’t be broader, often remarkably, even strategically,more ill defined; 99 percent of humanity contains so many potentiallyconflicting strains of thought and being: liberals and fundamentalists,left-wing radicals and right-wing nationalists, the middle class and thedismally poor, pensioners and high-school students. But the “we” couldn’t bemore real.This “we” is something that hasn’t been seen on this planet for a long time, andperhaps never quite so globally. And here’s what should take your breath away,and that of the other 1 percent, too: “we” were never supposed to exist.Everyone, even “we,” counted us out.Until last December, when a young Tunisian vegetable vendor set himself alightto protest his own humiliation, that “we” seemed to consist of the nonactors ofthe twenty-first century and much of the previous one as well. We’re talkingabout all those shunted aside, whose lives only weeks, months, or, at most, ayear ago, simply didn’t matter—all those the powerful absolutely knew they couldride roughshod over as they solidified their control of the planet’s wealth,resources, property, as, in fact, they drove this planet down.For them, “we” was just a mass of subprime humanity that hardly existed. So ofall the statements of 2011, the simplest of them—“We exist!”—has been by far themost powerful.NAME OF THE YEAR: OCCUPY WALL STREETEvery year since 1927, when it chose Charles Lindbergh for his famed flightacross the Atlantic, Time magazine has picked a “man” (even when, on rareoccasions, it was a woman like Queen Elizabeth II) or, after 1999, a “person” ofthe year (though sometimes it’s been an inanimate object like “the computer” ora group or an idea). If you want a gauge of how “we” have changed the globalconversation in just months, those in the running this year included “Arab youthprotestors,” “Anonymous,” “the 99 percent,” and “the 1 percent.” Admittedly, sowere Kim Kardashian, Casey Anthony, Michele Bachmann, Kate Middleton, and RupertMurdoch. In the end, the magazine’s winner of 2011 was “the protester.”How could it have been otherwise? We exist—and even Time knows it. From Tunis inJanuary to Moscow in December this has been, day by day, week by week, month bymonth, the year of the protester. Those looking back may see clues to what wasto come in isolated eruptions like the suppressed green movement in Iran orunder-the-radar civic activism emerging in Russia. Nonetheless, protest, when itarrived, seemed to come out of the blue. Unpredicted and unprepared for, theyoung (followed by the middle-aged and the old) took to the streets of citiesaround the globe and simply refused to go home, even when the police arrived,even when the thugs arrived, even when the army arrived, even when the pepperspraying, the arrests, the wounds, the deaths began and didn’t stop.And by the way, if “we exist” is the signature statement of 2011, the name ofthe year would have to be Occupy Wall Street. Forget the fact that the placeoccupied, Zuccotti Park, wasn’t on Wall Street but two blocks away and that,compared to Tahrir Square or Moscow’s thoroughfares, it was one of the smallestplots of protest land on the planet. It didn’t matter.The phrase was blowback of the first order. It was payback, too. Those threewords instantly turned the history of the last two decades upside down andhelped establish the protesters of 2011 as the third of the four great planetaryoccupations of our era.Previously, “occupations” had been relatively local affairs. You occupied acountry (“the occupation of Japan”), usually a defeated or conquered one. But inour own time, if it were left to me, I’d tell the history of humanity,American-style, as the story of four occupations, each global in nature.THE FIRST OCCUPATIONIn the 1990s, the financial types of our world set out to “occupy the wealth,”planetarily speaking. These were, of course, the globalists, now better known asthe neoliberals, and they were determined to “open” markets everywhere. Theywere out, as Thomas Friedman put it (though he hardly meant it quite this way),to flatten the Earth, which turned out to be a violent proposition.The neoliberals were let loose to do their damnedest in the good times of thepost–Cold War Clinton years. They wanted to apply a kind of American economicclout that they thought would never end to the organization of the planet. Theybelieved the United States to be the economic superpower of the ages, and theyhad their own dreamy version of what an economic Pax Americana would be like.Privatization was the name of the game, and their version of shock-and-awetactics involved calling in institutions like the International Monetary Fund to“discipline” developing countries into a profitable kind of poverty and misery.In the end, gleefully slicing and dicing subprime mortgages, they“financialized” the world and so drove a hole through it. They were our economicjihadis, and in the great meltdown of 2008, they deep-sixed the world economythey had helped “unify.” In the process, by increasing the gap between thesuperrich and everyone else, they helped create the 1 percent and the 99 percentin the United States and globally, preparing the ground for the protests tofollow.THE SECOND OCCUPATIONIf the first occupation drove an economic stake through the heart of the planet,the second did a similar thing militarily. In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the“unilateralists” of the Bush administration staked their own claim to a globaloccupation at the point of a cruise missile. Romantics all when it came to theU.S. military and what it could do, they invaded Iraq, determined to garrisonthe oil heartlands of the planet. It was going to be “shock and awe” and“mission accomplished” all the way. What they had in mind was a militarizedversion of an “occupy the wealth” scheme. Their urge to privatize even extendedto the military itself, and when they invaded, in their baggage train came cronycorporations ready to feast.Once upon a time, Americans knew that only the monstrous enemy—most recentlythat “evil empire,” the Soviet Union—could dream of world conquest andoccupation. That was, by nature, what evil monsters did. Until 2001, when itturned out to be quite okay for the good guys of planet Earth to think alongexactly the same lines.The invasion of Iraq, that “cakewalk,” was meant to establish amultigenerational foothold in the greater Middle East, including permanent basesgarrisoned with thirty thousand to forty thousand American troops, and that wasto be just the beginning of a chain reaction. Soon enough Syria and Iran wouldbow down before U.S. power or, if they refused, would go down anyway thanks toAmerican techno-might. In the end, the lands of the greater Middle East wouldfall into line (with the help of Washington’s proxy in the region, Israel).And since there was no other nation or bloc of nations with anything like suchmilitary power, nor would any be allowed to arise, the result—and they weren’tshy about this—would be a global Pax Americana and a domestic Pax Republicanamore or less till the end of time. As the “sole superpower” or even“hyperpower,” Washington would, in other words, occupy the planet.Of course, Iraq and Afghanistan were also more traditional occupations. InBaghdad, for instance, American Consul L. Paul Bremer III issued Order 17, whichessentially granted to every foreigner connected with the occupation enterprisethe full freedom of the land, not to be interfered with in any way by Iraqis orany Iraqi political or legal institutions. This included “freedom of movementwithout delay throughout Iraq,” and neither their vessels, vehicles, noraircraft were to be “subject to registration, licensing, or inspection by the[Iraqi] Government.” Nor in traveling would any foreign diplomat, soldier,consultant, or security guard, or any of their vehicles, vessels, or planes besubject to “dues, tolls, or charges, including landing and parking fees.” Andthat was only the beginning.Order 17, which read like an edict plucked directly from a nineteenth-centurycolonial setting, caught the local hubris of those privatizing occupiers.All of this proved to be fantasy bordering on delusion, and it didn’t take longfor that to become apparent. In fact, the utter failure of the unilateralistscame home to roost in the form of a status of forces (SOFA) agreement with Iraqiauthorities that promised to end the U.S. garrisoning of the country not in 2030or 2050, but in 2011. And the Bush administration felt forced to agree to it in2008, the same year that the economic unilateralists were facing the endgame oftheir dreams of global domination.In that year, the neoliberal effort to privatize the planet went down in flames,along with Lehman Brothers, all those subprime mortgages and derivatives, and awhole host of banks and financial outfits rescued from the trash bin of historyby the U.S. Treasury. Talk about giving the phrase “creative destruction” thedarkest meaning possible: the two waves of American unilateralists nearly tookdown the planet.They let loose demons of every sort, even as they ensured that the world’s firstexperience of a sole superpower would prove short indeed. Heap onto the rubblethey left behind the global disaster of rising prices for the basics—food andfuel—and you have a situation so combustible that no one should have beensurprised when a single Tunisian match set it aflame.The first two failed occupations plunged the planet into chaos and misery, evenas they paved the way, in a thoroughly unintended fashion, for an Arab Springready to take on the Middle East’s 1 percent.Note as well that, as their policies went to hell in a handbasket, the first andsecond set of occupiers walked off with their treasure and their selves intact.Neither the bankers nor the militarists went to jail, not a one of them. Theyhad made out like bandits and continue to do so. They took home theirmulti-million-dollar bonuses. They kept their yachts, mansions, and (untaxed)private jets. They took with them the ability to sign million-dollar contractsfor bestselling memoirs and to go on the lecture circuit at $100,000 to $150,000a pop. They had, in the case of the second occupation, quite literally gottenaway with murder (and torture and kidnapping, etc.). In the process, the miseryof the 99 percent had been immeasurably increased.THE THIRD OCCUPATIONThe most significant and surprising thing the first two globalizing occupationsdid, however, was to globalize protest. Together they created the basis, in pureiniquity and inequity, in dead bodies and bruised lives, for Tahrir Square andOccupy Wall Street. Their failures set the stage for something new in the world.The result was a Chalmers Johnson–style case of blowback, the spirit of whichwas caught in the protesters’ appropriation of the very word occupy. There was asense out there that they had occupied us long and disastrously enough. It wastime for us to occupy them, and so our own parks, squares, streets, towns,cities, and countries.The urge to right things is, in fact, a powerful one. Gene Turitz, a friend ofmine who took part in the demonstrations that briefly shut down the port ofOakland, California, recently wrote me the following about the experience. Itcatches something of the mood of this moment:The mayor of Oakland, a former progressive, blasted the economic violence thatwas being perpetrated by the Occupy movement shutting down the port. No wordabout the economic violence of banks stealing people’s homes throughforeclosures, or the economic violence of [sports] team owners demanding thecity build new stadiums for their teams or they will move to another city, or ofcorporations threatening to move if this or that is not done for them. That’sjust the way things are done. You do not want the “violence” of thousands ofpeople peacefully showing that things must change to make their lives better.Or in two words: we exist! And possibly in the nick of time.THE FOURTH OCCUPATIONThis is both the newest and oldest of occupations. I’m speaking about humanity’soccupation of Earth. In recent centuries, can there be any question that we’vebeen hard on this planet, exploiting it for everything it’s worth? Our excusewas that we genuinely didn’t know better, at least when it came to climatechange, that we just didn’t understand what kind of long-term harm the burningof fossil fuels could do. Now, of course, we know. Those who don’t are either indenial or simply couldn’t care less.And here’s just a taste of what we do know about how the fourth occupation isaffecting the planet: Thirteen of the warmest years since record keeping beganhave occurred in the last fifteen years. In 2010, historically staggeringamounts of carbon dioxide were sent into the atmosphere (“the biggest jump everseen in global warming gases”). Extreme weather was, well, remarkably extreme in2011—torrid droughts, massive fires, vast floods—and in the Arctic, ice is nowmelting at unprecedented rates, which will mean future sea-level rises that willthreaten low-lying areas of the planet. And as for that temperature, well, it’sgoing to keep going up, uncomfortably so.Potentially, this is the monster blowback story of all time.And here’s just a taste of what we know about business as usual on this planet:If we rely on the previous occupiers and their ilk to save us, then it’s goingto be a long, dismal wait. Don’t count on energy giants like Exxon or BP ortheir lobbyists and the politicians they influence to stop climate change. Afterall, none of them are going to be alive to see a far less habitable planet, sowhat do they care? Torrid zones are so then, profit sheets and bonuses are sonow, which means: don’t count on the 1 percent to give a damn.If it were up to them—a few outliers among them excepted—we could probablysimply write the Earth off as a future friendly place for us. And the planetwouldn’t care. Give it one hundred thousand, 10 million, 100 million years, andit’ll get itself back in shape with plenty of life-forms to go around.We’re such ephemeral creatures with such brief life spans. It’s hard for us tothink even in the sort of modestly long-range way that climate change demands.So thank your lucky stars that the first- and second-wave occupiers created athird payback occupation they never imagined possible. And thank your luckystars that movements to occupy our planet in a new way and turn back the globalwarmers are slowly rising as well.Like the attempted occupations of the global economy and the greater MiddleEast, each spurred by a sense of greed that went beyond all bounds, theoccupation of our planet is guaranteed to create its own oppositional forces,and not just in the natural world either. They are perhaps already emergingalong with the Arab Spring, the European summer, and the American fall, not tospeak of the Russian winter. And when they’re here—as the fifth occupation ofplanet Earth—when they stand their ground and chant, “We exist!” in anger,strength, and wonder, maybe then we can really tackle climate change and hope itisn’t too late.Maybe the fifth occupation is the one we’re waiting for—and don’t for a seconddoubt that it will come. It’s already on its way."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX BEVIDENCE OF COSMIC COMMUNITYFinley Eversole, Ph.D. PART I. DISINFORMATION ABOUT ETsI know for sure we’re not alone in the universe.

I can now reveal that every day, in the USA, ourradar instruments capture objects of form and composition unknown to us. Andthere are thousands of witness reports and a quantity of documents to provethis, but nobody wants to make them public.MAJOR GORDON COOPER,U.S. ASTRONAUTIt is a truth the entire world has to be informed about, and that truth is thatman is not alone.SERGEANT CLIFFORD STONE,U.S. EXTRATERRESTRIAL RETRIEVAL TEAMCampaigns of disinformation dating back to the 1940s have been employed bygovernments and the media to cover up one of the most significant events of ourtime—the recognition that humanity is not alone in the universe. Theimplications are profound and far-reaching. It may be worth noting that,contrary to media and mythic portrayals, there has never been a single incidentof ET hostility toward Earth or its peoples. But they do seem concerned that wemay destroy ourselves.We already know that “black” military-governmental-industrial-intelligenceprograms have advanced energy and propulsion technologies reverse-engineeredfrom downed ET craft and that these technologies would end forever our relianceon environmentally destructive fossil fuels and nuclear energy. The microchip,which gave us the PC, Internet, cell phone, and many other advances, is but oneof several examples of reverse-engineered ET technology already in use. Giventhe severity of our energy and environmental problems, one must ask why thistechnology remains secret.In an era when humans have traveled in space, why should we doubt that otherself-conscious intelligent beings, perhaps far more advanced technologically andspiritually than ourselves, have also done so? And what are the amazing cropcircles appearing all over the world, distinguished by brilliant geometric andastronomical messages, if not “calling cards” from our cosmic cousins—messagessaying, “We are here to help if you will accept it.”As Steven Greer says:The recognition that mankind is one, that race, nationality, gender, religionand so on are secondary to our shared humanness, may well be the crowningachievement of the 20th century. . . . Our deepest point of unity transcendsrace, culture, gender, profession, life roles, even level of intelligence oremotional make-up, since all these attributes vary widely among people. Rather,the foundation of human oneness is consciousness itself. . . . All other humanqualities arise from this mother of all attributes. . . . The finest, mostenduring and transcendent foundation on which human unity is based then isconsciousness itself; for we are all sentient beings, conscious, self-aware andintelligent. No matter how diverse two people or two cultures may be, thisfoundation of consciousness will enable unity to prevail, as it is the simplestyet most profound common ground which all humans share.The term Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI), so curiously nondescript,wonderfully lends itself to these concepts of unity. Regardless of planet, starsystem or galaxy of origin, and no matter how diverse, ETs are essentiallyintelligent, conscious, sentient beings. We are, essentially, one. On thisbasis, we may speak of one people inhabiting one universe, just as we nowenvision one people as children of one planet. Differences are always a matterof degree, but true unity established in consciousness is absolute. . . . Forthere is one universe inhabited by one people, and we are they.REFERENCESBooks and PeriodicalsBamford, James. The Puzzle Palace: A Report on America’s Most Secret Agency.Penguin, 1983.______.

CROP CIRCLES—COSMIC ART God geometrizes.PLATO Why is the art world unmoved? This must surely be the most astonishing body ofearth art in history. Why has academia not taken note of the numerological andgeometrical skills demonstrated here? Why has the media not remarked on theperseverance and proficiency of this team of gifted operators?MICHAEL GLICKMAN,ARCHITECTFor me, it was immediately and ineluctably clear that these beautiful and joyouscreations not only transcend our ordinary understanding of the material world,but confront our sense of the spiritual, too.MIKE LEIGH,FILM DIRECTORAny member of the press or public who still views crop circles as man-madehoaxes either has not studied the phenomenon or must wonder why some of the mostbrilliant and creative minds on the planet are not teaching in our colleges anduniversities. Apart from the incredible beauty of the designs, their amazinggeometry, profound global symbolism, scientific and mathematical revelations,and the stunning speed with which they often appear (within fifteen minutes orless), there is the fact that plant stems are never broken and seeds from cropswithin crop circles germinate significantly faster and yield 61 percent moreharvest. This is no ordinary phenomenon. No human has yet been able to produce a“genuine” crop circle in the presence of onlookers or the media. Crop circles,or “agriglyphs,” are the work of a superior, moral, and compassionateintelligence that seems to want to communicate with humanity.The continued appearance of crop circles year after year in more than seventycountries—now numbering several thousand—and their increasing richness of designshould tell us we are not dealing with a handful of pranksters. Somethingsignificant is taking place. Perhaps these designs—impressed in the plant lifeof Mother Nature—are also meant to call us back to the Earth at a time whenenvironmental problems threaten the life of humanity and allied kingdoms.Contempt prior to examination is the death of knowledge. There is a wisdom herewe ought not ignore.image [images/9781594775093_068.jpg]Julia Set crop circle, at Milk Hill, UK, is over eight hundred feet in diameter,contains 409 individual circles, and made its appearance during one of therainiest nights of the year.

In 1992, then-UN Secretary GeneralBoutros Boutros-Ghali brought the matter to the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, butit was felt that the time was not yet ripe for such a declaration. In 1994,Maurice Strong, chairman of the Earth Summit, and Mikhail Gorbachev, workingthrough the Earth Council and Green Cross International respectively, restartedthe Earth Charter as a civil society initiative with the help of the governmentof the Netherlands.The Earth Charter is an international declaration of fundamental values andprinciples considered useful by its supporters for building a just, sustainable,and peaceful global society in the twenty-first century. Created by a globalconsultation process, and endorsed by organizations representing millions ofpeople, the Charter “seeks to inspire in all peoples a sense of globalinterdependence and shared responsibility for the well-being of the humanfamily, the greater community of life, and future generations.” It calls uponhumanity to cooperate in creating a global partnership based on the EarthCharter’s ethical vision encompassing environmental protection, human rights,equitable human development, and peace among all peoples.The Earth Charter Initiative exists to promote the Charter.PREAMBLEWe stand at a critical moment in Earth’s history, a time when humanity mustchoose its future. As the world becomes increasingly interdependent and fragile,the future at once holds great peril and great promise. To move forward we mustrecognize that in the midst of a magnificent diversity of cultures and lifeforms we are one human family and one Earth community with a common destiny. Wemust join together to bring forth a sustainable global society founded onrespect for nature, universal human rights, economic justice, and a culture ofpeace. Towards this end, it is imperative that we, the peoples of Earth, declareour responsibility to one another, to the greater community of life, and tofuture generations.EARTH, OUR HOMEHumanity is part of a vast evolving universe. Earth, our home, is alive with aunique community of life. The forces of nature make existence a demanding anduncertain adventure, but Earth has provided the conditions essential to life’sevolution. The resilience of the community of life and the well-being ofhumanity depend upon preserving a healthy biosphere with all its ecologicalsystems, a rich variety of plants and animals, fertile soils, pure waters, andclean air. The global environment with its finite resources is a common concernof all peoples. The protection of Earth’s vitality, diversity, and beauty is asacred trust.THE GLOBAL SITUATIONThe dominant patterns of production and consumption are causing environmentaldevastation, the depletion of resources, and a massive extinction of species.Communities are being undermined. The benefits of development are not sharedequitably and the gap between rich and poor is widening. Injustice, poverty,ignorance, and violent conflict are widespread and the cause of great suffering.An unprecedented rise in human population has overburdened ecological and socialsystems. The foundations of global security are threatened. These trends areperilous—but not inevitable.THE CHALLENGES AHEADThe choice is ours: form a global partnership to care for Earth and one anotheror risk the destruction of ourselves and the diversity of life. Fundamentalchanges are needed in our values, institutions, and ways of living. We mustrealize that when basic needs have been met, human development is primarilyabout being more, not having more. We have the knowledge and technology toprovide for all and to reduce our impacts on the environment. The emergence of aglobal civil society is creating new opportunities to build a democratic andhumane world. Our environmental, economic, political, social, and spiritualchallenges are interconnected, and together we can forge inclusive solutions.UNIVERSAL RESPONSIBILITYTo realize these aspirations, we must decide to live with a sense of universalresponsibility, identifying ourselves with the whole Earth community as well asour local communities. We are at once citizens of different nations and of oneworld in which the local and global are linked. Everyone shares responsibilityfor the present and future wellbeing of the human family and the larger livingworld. The spirit of human solidarity and kinship with all life is strengthenedwhen we live with reverence for the mystery of being, gratitude for the gift oflife, and humility regarding the human place in nature.We urgently need a shared vision of basic values to provide an ethicalfoundation for the emerging world community. Therefore, together in hope weaffirm the following interdependent principles for a sustainable way of life asa common standard by which the conduct of all individuals, organizations,businesses, governments, and transnational institutions is to be guided andassessed.PRINCIPLESI.

To fulfill thispromise, we must commit ourselves to adopt and promote the values and objectivesof the Charter.This requires a change of mind and heart. It requires a new sense of globalinterdependence and universal responsibility. We must imaginatively develop andapply the vision of a sustainable way of life locally, nationally, regionally,and globally. Our cultural diversity is a precious heritage and differentcultures will find their own distinctive ways to realize the vision. We mustdeepen and expand the global dialogue that generated the Earth Charter, for wehave much to learn from the ongoing collaborative search for truth and wisdom.Life often involves tensions between important values. This can mean difficultchoices. However, we must find ways to harmonize diversity with unity, theexercise of freedom with the common good, short-term objectives with long-termgoals. Every individual, family, organization, and community has a vital role toplay. The arts, sciences, religions, educational institutions, media,businesses, nongovernmental organizations, and governments are all called tooffer creative leadership. The partnership of government, civil society, andbusiness is essential for effective governance.In order to build a sustainable global community, the nations of the world mustrenew their commitment to the United Nations, fulfill their obligations underexisting international agreements, and support the implementation of EarthCharter principles with an international legally binding instrument onenvironment and development.Let ours be a time remembered for the awakening of a new reverence for life, thefirm resolve to achieve sustainability, the quickening of the struggle forjustice and peace, and the joyful celebration of life."},{"pageContent":"FOOTNOTES *1 [9781594775093_c01.xhtml#fr1] See chapters 4 and 5 in my book Transcendingthe Speed of Light (Inner Traditions, 2008), for a comprehensive explanation viaTesla’s theory of what Einstein called Grand Unification, which is directlylinked to what today is called the God particle, or Higgs boson, the supposedparticle that gives matter its mass.*2 [9781594775093_c03.xhtml#fr2] In Schauberger’s writings in German, the prefixUr is often separated from the rest of the word by a hyphen (e.g., Ur-sache inlieu of Ursache, when normally it would be joined). By this he intends to placea particular emphasis on the prefix, thus endowing it with a more profoundmeaning than the merely superficial. This prefix belongs not only to the Germanlanguage, but in former times also to the English, a usage that has now lapsed.According to the Oxford English Dictionary, ur denotes “primitive,” “original,”and “earliest,” giving such examples as “ur-Shakespeare” or “ur-origin.” Thisbegins to get to the root of Schauberger’s use of it and the deeper significancehe placed on it. If one expands on the interpretation given in the OxfordEnglish Dictionary, then the concepts of “primordial,” “primeval,” “primal,”“fundamental,” “elementary,” and “of first principle” come to mind, whichfurther encompass such meanings as pertaining to the first age of the world orof anything ancient; pertaining to or existing from the earliest beginnings;constituting the earliest beginning or starting point, from which something elseis derived, developed, or depends; applying to parts or structures in theirearliest or rudimentary stage; and the first or earliest formed in the course ofgrowth. To this can be added the concept of an “ur-condition” or “ur-state” ofextremely high potential or potency, a latent evolutionary ripeness, which giventhe correct impulse can unloose all of Nature’s innate creative forces.*3 [9781594775093_c03.xhtml#fr3] Carbones are principally those basic elementsand raw materials of carbonous nature, although the term also includes all theelements of the chemist and physicist with the exclusion of oxygen and hydrogen.They are what Schauberger called “mother-substances,” as they form the matrixfrom which all life is created.*4 [9781594775093_c03.xhtml#fr4] Fructigenic is a term of Schauberger’sdescribing the higher subtle energies responsible for increasing the fecundityor capacity for fructification and fertilization of and by living things.*5 [9781594775093_c03.xhtml#fr5] Triboluminescence is an internal glow orluminescence produced when two or more crystalline rocks of similar compositionare rubbed hard together or struck against one another, and it is attributed tothe energy given off by the electrons contained in the rocks as they return froma pressure-induced, excited state to their rest orbits. As a phenomenon it canoccur both in air and under water.*6 [9781594775093_c03.xhtml#fr6] pH is the measure of the hydrogen-ionconcentration in a given substance and indicates the degree of acidity oralkalinity. Pure water and human blood both have a neutral pH of 7. Above a pHvalue of 7 alkalinity increases; below it acidity increases.*7 [9781594775093_c04.xhtml#fr7] Od refers to the Odic forces studied by WilhelmReich. His work was suppressed in the early twentieth century but is making acomeback in several fields, from healing to free-energy technology.*8 [9781594775093_c04.xhtml#fr8] It was from strep throat, easily curable today,that George Washington died after a life of surviving war, dysentery, influenza,malaria, mumps, pleurisy, pneumonia, rickets, smallpox, staph infections,tuberculosis, and typhoid fever.*9 [9781594775093_c05.xhtml#fr9] Richard Boylan claims the B-2 stealth bomberoperates largely by using antigravity technology for its propulsion system, butthis information has never been disclosed to the general public, which believethe bomber relies on conventional fuel sources.
