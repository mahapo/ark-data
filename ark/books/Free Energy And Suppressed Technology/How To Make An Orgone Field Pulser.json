It is to be understood by the reader that in this bo oklet, “bioenergy” refers to an omnipresent background energy form which is generally found in highe r concentration within living organisms. This energy is known by various names such as Orgone, R eiki energy, Bioenergy, Biomagnetic Energy, Odic force, Prana, Chi, Etheric energy, and Ae ther, to name a few. It is a biological animative energy which has magnetic, thermal, wave, f luidic and optical properties. It is a form of energy which is capable of influencing its environment in subtle but powerful ways. It causes changes ranging from subtle chemical or magnetic effect s through to marked emotional responses in living organisms under some conditions. This is still a growing science. Personally, it is my view that acknowledging this energ y form and understanding it more fully is in the best interest of humankind, and it is to that en d that I offer this and other information on the subject. The experimenter (that would be you, dear re ader) assumes responsibility for any consequences which arise from the construction of this e xperimental device and/or its use. The device illustrated here is a versatile and power ful bioenergy tool which both generates and modulates life energy. When combined with an audio feed from an audio reco rding or the sound card of a PC, it demonstrates many of the cap abilities of much more complex and expensive frequency therapy devices (like “rife” mac hines). It also has applications in radionics, providing both an amplified output for ra dionics circuits, and (via the mobius coil) a means of modulating the bioenergy discharged with rad ionic information. It can be used as a standalone device or in conjunction with existing radio nics machines. The OFP is a design I have had consistently good feed back with over several years. The design has gone through successive stages of development and adaptation. In this booklet, I have adapted the design to be made from readily availabl e materials. The design does not depend on precise geometry, pleasant appearance, or even that t he materials used be exactly as depicted (even though I would suggest that they should be, un til you have at least built one as depicted before making changes to the design). As long as the same basic parts are put together in the same way, it will work. The quality of workmanship and materials, as well as the care put into the construction, do of course have an effect on the finis hed product. In simple terms, this device makes use of the fluid ch aracteristics of bioenergy, and also makes use of the wave properties of bioenergy. It is an Ae ther vortex chamber (created by the mobius coil) surrounded by a casing of Bioenergy- generating m aterial. The result is that you have a stream of Bioenergy coming out of the device, and the stream of Bioenergy carries a wave pattern determined by the signal used to drive the co il. You will get this effect even if you just cast a coil inside of a rough chunk of Ergonite (my name fo r the bioenergy-generating material). Even when there is no current going through the coil there is still a smaller vortex generated by the coil. The pulser design as offered here is the result of several years R&D and it is my hope that you will find the information useful and comprehensible. My contact information is included at the end of this booklet, and I welcome your feedback. This book is partially the result of requests via ema il for more information on how to build this device. If you have just bought this book but have nev er heard of Orgone Energy before, then there are several free articles with basic informatio n available for download from http://www.littlemountainsmudge.com/info.htm and links to other informational resources that should help to fill in the blanks. Sincerely, Jon Logan"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Selecting a Crystal At the core of the OFP is a mobius coil with a quartz cor e. Selecting a suitable piece of quartz is the first step. The mass of the quartz is more important than the quality. That is not to say that the quality of the crysta l is unimportant, rather that a large enough crystal of relatively poor quality will wo rk much better than a beautiful water-clear crystal which is too small. If you are a person who already uses crystals because of their bioenergy properties, then you can select one that you like. If you are not familiar with the use of quartz as a bioenergy lens, then it does not matter that you have any special crystal. It matters that the crystal you use be about 4.5 cubic inches in volume or more. I generally use crystals between 6 and 12 cubic inches in volume. Cracks, inclusions, chips and so forth in the crystal will not stop it from working. In short, the better the crystal quality, the more efficiently the quartz core will wor k. But any quartz will work, and it is important that it t he crystal be large enough. If you are going to go to all the trouble of making this device, you may as well use a big enough piece of quartz or you will be wasting the effort. The crystal can have one point or two points. It does not have to be perfectly shaped or symmetrical. You could also use a cut prism, cylinde r or obelisk of quartz. You could also use Smoky Quartz, Amethyst, Rose Quar tz or Citrine, since all of these minerals are basically quartz with a very small amount of metal included in the crystal structure. The metal changes the co lor of the quartz to give it a yellow, brown, red or purple color. Most people are able to find natural quartz crystal fo r sale either on the internet or through the mail. I generally use medium quality, d ouble-terminated clear quartz crystals which measure about 4 inches x 2 inches x 1. 5 inches. The design depends on there being a mass of quartz of suffici ent volume (4.5 cubic inches or more) inside the coil. So if you are not a “ crystal person” then don’t worry about it, we are working with physics here (meta- physics, that is) and not with any individual persons belief system. Just get your han ds on a chunk of quartz that is big enough, and it will work. You can get quality crystals from http://www.thecrystalman.com/index.htm And more quartz vendors are listed on this page: http://www.littlemountainsmudge.com/links.htm"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Supplement If for some reason you are unable to find the required quartz crystal, you could use the white variety of landscaping quartz known as “qua rtzite”, but since it is of lower quality than the clear quartz crystals, you should use a mass of at least ten cubic inches if you elect to use Quartzite. Another less efficient but workable method of getting the required crystal mass is to take powdered quartz and mix it with just enough plastic casting resin to hold it together. Use polyester (fiberglass) resin or acrylic (craft) resin. Cast it in the shape of a simple cylinder, and make it about 10 cubic inches in volume or more. It will not work as well as a nice quartz crystal, but it will work. You can get landscaping quartz (white rocks for putting in your garden) from the hardware stor e. You can get sandblasting quartz grit (available where welding or a uto body supplies are sold) and reduce it to a powder. You can reduce either one o f these products to a fine powder with a setup like in the picture above. Wear a d ust mask, goggles and gloves, because quartz slivers are very sharp, just like glass. You could use a length of PVC plastic pipe as the mold to make your own “reconstituted” quartz. Use piece of 2 inch diameter pip e about 5 inches long. Brush the inside of the pipe with vegetable oil or pet roleum jelly for a mold release agent. Get some tape and cover one end of the pipe. Mix the resin and catalyst and then mix in the crystal powder until the mix ture is thick like oatmeal. Stand the pipe on the closed end and pour the mixture into the open end. Shake it to release air bubbles. If at all possible, expose th e mixture to sunlight or bright moonlight while the plastic resin is setting up. It will most likely come out opaque and either a milky white or a pastel color derived from the color of the plastic resin. If you are going to use this method, it may be wo rthwhile to use acrylic resin instead of polyester, but either will work. This method of making a “faux crystal” from quartz powde r will work, but not as well as an actual crystal, and it really is better to use e ven a low quality chunk of actual quartz crystal if at all possible."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Making the Mobius Coil Once you have selected the crystal you are going to use, the next thing to do is make a Mobius Coil to fit it. First - Make yourself a \"mobius Cable\" to wind the coil from. While you can wind a mobius coil from single strands of wire, it certainly seems to be a lot more potent when you use a cable made in the manner described here to wind the coil from. Take a length of wire, and double it back on itself twice as shown to the right. Pull a little slack out at the ends of the wire; this will be the leads of the coil when it is finished. You should leave yourself at least 6\" for leads; you can always trim the leads to the required length when the coil is finished. It is much easier t o use a drill to twist the wires than doing it by hand. I generally run the drill in reverse to twis t the cable. For making the OFP, I recommend using the solid copper wire with lacquer insulation co mmonly called “magnet wire” in North America. It is called this because they use it to make e lectromagnets, not because it is magnetic. If you can’t get this kind of wire, then use any wire between 20 and 14 AWG. Myself, I generally use #18 AWG copper wire with inverter-duty lacquer ins ulation. If you are using wire that is not solid but rather composed of many filaments, then be more careful when you twist it, especially if it is # 20 AWG or smaller. In my opinion, solid copp er wire is much better but any wire that is insulated will work. Also, it does not have to come o ut so the spiral is exactly 45 degrees, but get it as close as you can. Not shown in the picture above is how to fit the cabl e end into the drill. Before inserting the cable end into the drill to twist it, fold the leads back s o that they point towards the end of the cable opposite the end with the leads. Then wrap a few tu rns of electrical tape around the wires to protect them from the drill. Use about 5 or 6 turns of electrical tape. This provides a cushion so that when you tighten the drill chuck on the wires, it will not scrape off the insulation. While working with the coil in this and subsequent steps to building the OFP, be careful not to scrape the insulation off the wires, or the coil will short out and not work. While you are twisting the cable, keep just enough ten sion on it to keep it from bunching up. Don’t pull too hard on the wire as you twist it, or you wil l get knots. If you break the wires by twisting it too tightly, start over again, don’t try to repair it . Fortunately, wire is something that is not terrib ly expensive in most countries. For those of you in indu strialized nations, you can generally purchase magnet wire as described above from electric al supply contractors, or the shops where they repair large electric motors. Most major cities have a shop that does electrical coil windings for large motors, and they will often spool you off a few pounds for your “hobby project”. Otherwise, go to radio shack and get what wire they ha ve. You need about 30 feet of # 18 AWG to make a coil of appropriate size for the OFP."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Mobius Coil Winding - Series Quadrifilar Cable with Helical Twist / Toroidal Coil Winding. 1. - Starting with the end of the mobius cable which does not have the leads, make a loop in the clockwise direction just a little larger than the size yo u want the hole in the center of your finished coil to be. 2. - When you complete the first wrap, feed the wire thro ugh the center of the circle so it wraps around itself in the clockwise direction as shown. Use a little glue (hot melt glue works well for this because it sets up in minutes) to hold the wire in pl ace where it crosses over itself. It should be glue that is flexible when dry . Put the glue right where the little black arrow is pointing, in the picture below. 3. - Resume winding the wire around the circle in the clo ckwise direction again. 4. - Go around the circle about one third of the way, and feed the cable around the center again, just like in step 3. Go around the circle another th ird of the way, and do the same thing again. You should have 3 wraps through the center of the coi l for each time you go around the circle formed by the coil. Try to keep it neat and even, but d on’t worry if it doesn’t come out a perfect circle. If you get the spacing of these first 3 nodes even, then the coil will come out more even. Try to get the 3 nodes to form an equilateral triang le. 5. - Continue this way, repeating step 4, until you have used up all of the cable. As shown, stay on the same side of the previous wrap with each new revolution. The 'knots' will run together."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" When you are finished, use a little glue to hold th e end of the cable in place. The coil should look like this when you are finished. Hopefully, the pictures will be of more use to you than the words, as it is really quite simple to do, just a little cumbersome to try and explain in words. Basically, you just keep looping the cable through the center as you go around the circle. With a little practice, you will find that the windings form a pattern, and i f you make a mistake it will be obvious as it does not fit the pattern. You should measure the diameter of the crystal you wish to use, and start with a circle about 15% larger than the diameter of the crystal. It is also a good idea to make a coil for practice before you make the one you will use in the pulser. It does not have to look pretty; it has to be a big knot of wire which is all twisted up in a spiral pattern. That way, the entire length of wire is conti nually crossing over itself at roughly 90 degrees . The wraps on one side of the cable cross over the wrap s on the other side of the cable at 90 degrees. This is wha t causes it to generate scalar wave patterns when you put an electric current thro ugh it."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Mounting the Coil Well, now you should have a crystal and a coil. The next thing to do is mount the coil on the crystal. Test fit it first. If you find that the coil is too tight for the crystal, then make another coil a little bit larger, or unwind the coil and rewind it a little larger. Do not try to force the coil onto the crystal, or you will scratch off the insulation and have to start over again anyway. The coil can be a little too large for the crystal and it will not hurt anything. You should arrange it so that the coil sits about one t hird of the way along the length of the crystal. Instead of placing the coil at the center of the length of the crystal, place it about one third of the way along the length of the crystal. Put it closest to the end without a point if you are using a single terminate crystal, or closest to the end which you have decided will be the “bottom” if you are using a double terminated crystal. In any case, the crystal has to go through the hole in the center of the coil. Once you have a good fit, fasten the coil securely in place with good glue. You can use either hot melt glue (the heavy duty kind is best, the kind that is yellow and not whi te) or silicone glue, or vinyl glue like “Goop®” or “Shoe Goo®” brands. For this par t I usually use heavy duty hot melt glue with a glue gun. The advantage to usin g hot melt glue is that it sets up very quickly, and you don’t have to wait hours or days fo r it to set up. With silicone or vinyl glue, Support the work in place so it cannot move, apply the glue, and let it sit for at least twenty four hours before continuing the work. A simple way to hold the coil in place, if you wish, is to tack it with hot melt glue (even the cheap white kind) and then apply silicone or vinyl glue over the hot melt glue. This produces a durable and flexible joint. For people who live in extremely hot climates, I would suggest this as hot melt glue may soften up and release if it gets too hot. This is not so much a problem with the hig h-temperature, heavy duty hot melt glue as it is with the low-temperature “ econo” or “regular” grade of hot melt glue."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Once you have mounted the coil on the crystal, now you are ready to add the color filter. This is an optional step, but part of the way I do it and therefore part of these plans. What we are doing here is simply “coloring” the energy that will come out of the quartz with the energy signature of another mineral. I generally use kyanite for this. You could use other mine rals, or you could leave it out entirely. Three small slivers of kyanite are attache d to one side of the coil, usually the ‘bottom side’ but either side can be used. T he three slivers of kyanite are arranged so that they form a triangle. They go ri ght where the crystal meets the coil. Since a quartz crystal has 6 sixes, just put on e sliver of kyanite on every other side of the crystal. Fasten them in place with a l ittle glue. Wind the coil leads up so they won’t get in your way. (above pic from a different project but shows kyanite) The Reflector The next step is to make the reflector. This is basically a metal container that goes around the outside of the coil and crystal assembly. T here are several different workable methods of procuring a suitable ref lector. On the next page, there is a graphic that can be printed off and used as a template to cut the reflector with metal shears (“tin snips”) from thin alum inum flashing. You can find this thin aluminum flashing at most hardware stores. If you have it, you can also use steel or galvanized steel or thin copper. Generally, aluminum is more easily found and economical, and it more than suffices. Resize the graphic if necessary, print it out on a sheet of paper, and cut around the outside edges of the black shape. Lay the paper template down on the aluminum flashing, working on a smooth firm surface. Hold the template firmly in place or secure it with a little tape. Trace around the outside edges to mark the outline on the metal. If you print it out on thick card stock, then you can use a scribe or a sharp nail to scratch the outline into the flashing. Otherwise, print it out on regular paper and carefully trace the outline onto the flashing with an HB pencil or a thin point felt pen. Once you have the outline transferred to the aluminum flashing, carefully cut it out with the metal shears. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Template for reflector Cut around outside edges Bend along white lines"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Supplement Although the plans here depict a reflector made from t he template provided, you could alternately use the optical reflector from a large flashlight, if you can find one at least 3 inches in diameter. If you are unable t o find the aluminum flashing and the shears to cut it, then you could substitute a sma ll food can like those generally used for canned tuna. These cans measure roughl y 1.5 inches x 3.5 inches and are easily found almost anywhere. You would ne ed to cut a hole about 1 inch diameter, centered in the bottom of the can. Alternately, you could cut the top off a plastic pop bottle and coat the outsid e of the pop bottle top with aluminum tape or metal spray paint. It is more impor tant that the coil be surrounded with a covering of metal than that the meta l covering be of any particular shape. Bend along the white dotted lines to form the metal cutout into the shape shown in the picture. You will wind up with a hexagonal reflector with a small hole at the narrow end. Bend the tabs around the outside of the metal cutout up, so that they form sides for the reflector. Do the best that you can to get it neat, but again what matters here is that you have a metal enclosure for the coil and crystal. It does not have to be pretty. The enclosure should have a small hole at the end where the “bottom” of the crysta l goes, and a wider opening at the end with the “top” of the crystal. Now you are ready to mount the coil inside the reflect or. Adjust the reflector so that it best fits the crystal and coil. Do not worry if t he edges of all the tabs do not meet, you are going to wrap it with aluminum tape so that there will be an unbroken metal covering around the outside of the whol e crystal and coil assembly. Once you have the reflector arranged to fit the coil and crystal, tack it in place with a little hot melt glue. Tack each of the six flat inner sides of the reflector to the coil. Do them one at a time, and as you do them, h old each one in place so that it lines up reasonably well. Do your best to get the axis of the crystal centered within the axis of the reflector."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Cut about an inch of plastic tubing. Slide the coil leads through it, so that it forms a sleeve around the coil leads. Feed the ends of the leads through the tubing. Slide the tubing all the way up the leads until it butts against the coil. This is to protect the coil leads where they pass between the sharp edges of the metal reflector. You will have one seam on the reflector that joins the whole thing together. On this seam, at the place where the angles forming the base of the reflector meet the side of the reflector, bend the sharp edges of the metal back a little so that they cannot scrape the insulat ion off the coil leads. Fit the coil leads, inside their protective sleeve of plastic tubing, into this opening. Secure both the coil leads and the seam on the reflector with a little aluminum tape. By this point you should have the coil tacked in place within the reflector. Now wrap the outside of the reflector with at least 2 layers of aluminum tape. Leave just a little of the metal flashing exposed at the “bottom” of the reflector, and cover the rest of the outside surface of the reflector with aluminum tape. Line the edges and seams of the reflector up as best you can while you are doing this. Make sure that all the seams are covere d with at least 2 layers of aluminum tape. Supplement If you cannot find aluminum auto body tape, then use fi rst a layer of masking tape to hold the metal flashing in the correct shape, and then a double layer of aluminum foil over the masking tape. Then wrap on anot her good layer of masking tape to hold the aluminum foil in place. It r eally is better to use aluminum tape or another metallic tape. In industrial ized nations, you can generally find aluminum auto body repair tape in larg e hardware stores or in painter’s supply stores. http://doityourself.com/ "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Now set the reflector in a jar or cup to hold it vert ical, so that the exposed end of the crystal points upward. Use either heavy duty hot melt g lue, silicone glue or vinyl glue to fix the coil and reflector permanently t ogether. Use a generous amount of glue, because you don’t want it to fall out later on. If it does, you will be unable to get at it to fix it, and the whole project will be a waste. Ask me how I know that ;) I generally use “high temperature” aka “h eavy duty” hot melt glue, and I use about 2 ½ to 3 sticks of glue for each coil / r eflector assembly. Whatever glue is used, cover the entire side of the coil that you can see when looking down into the reflector. Make sure that the gl ue is firmly worked into the crevices of the coil, and touches both the sides of the cr ystal and the inner sides of the reflector. Use a layer of glue a good ¼ inch thi ck. Set the reflector assembly aside for the moment and let the glue dry. Output Expansion Chamber This step is to make a chamber that adjoins and extends the reflector assembly. It is simply a hollow tube with an organic outer layer and a metallic inner layer. Get some clean, dry corrugated cardboard without any printing or markings of any kind. Select a section of the cardboard that has not been crushed so that it will have enough structural strength. Cover one side of the corrugated cardboard with aluminum tape. Work the tape firmly onto the cardboard with your fingertips or the rounded bottom o f a soupspoon. Do not scratch holes in the covering of aluminum. If you make a hole, cover it with another piece of tape. You can use one neat layer or t wo less-than-neat layers of aluminum tape. You are going to cut a strip from this laminate sheet. Normally, the strip can be about 3 inches wide. If you used an extremely large crystal, you may have to make the strip wider. Double check by making the following measurements: go back to the reflector assembly and measure the distance from the exposed tip of the crystal to the surface of the glue covering the coil. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The strip should be at least 2 inches wide. Additionally, the width of the strip m ust be at least ¼ inch greater than the distance from the crystal tip to the surface of the glue. Now measure the circumference (around the ou tside) of the reflector assembly, and make the strip a little longer than the ci rcumference of the reflector assembly. It has to form a tube that will be i nserted in the exposed open end of the reflector. The end has to reach just past t he crystal tip. Neatly cut a strip from the cardboard / aluminum lamin ate with a utility knife. Make sure to cut the strip so that the ribs in the corruga ted cardboard run across (the short way) the strip and not along (the long way) the length of it. When you look at one of the long edges of the strip, you should se e the wavy line formed by the corrugations. If you cut it with the ribs running th e wrong way, then you will not be able to neatly crease it into a tube. Take the time to make the edges of the strip parallel and the ends square. Use a straight edge to run the utility knife along as you make the cut. Roll the strip into a tube around a suitable cylindrica l form such as small jar or tin can. The cap from a spray paint can is about the right si ze for a normal crystal. Start at one end of the strip and press firmly against the form as you roll. Put the metallic side inwards so that it will form the inner su rface of the tube. Once you have the strip creased into the shape of a tube, insert the tube into the open end of the reflector assembly. It does not have to be perfectl y cylindrical, or perfectly round. A little overlap at the ends of the tube is nece ssary so that you can fasten them together. The sides of the tube should be as close to parallel with each other as you can get them. The sides of the tube should be a s close to parallel with the axis of the crystal (not the reflector) as you can get them. Even if you just mash it into place, it will still work, but it is worth the time to work the cardboard gently into place and get it all lined up nicely. If the end of the strip does not come out square and level, then don’t worry you can trim it later with a utility knife or scissors. Make the sides parallel . Tack the tube in place with hot melt glue. Tack the tube to each of the six flat inner sides of the reflector assembly, one at a time. Line each connection point up as best you can before you tack it, and hold it in place while the hot melt glue cools. Once the tube is tacked in place, let it cool for a few minutes and then fasten it in place permanently with glue. Fill all the holes at th e inside corners of the reflector and glue all the way around the seam where the reflect or meets the tube. Fill the seam where the two ends of the strip overlap with glu e to form a seal. You need"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"not only to hold the tube firmly in place, but also to form a liquid-tight seal on all the outside surface of the assembly you are building. Supplement You could use several methods to form an output expansi on chamber, but it should have an organic outer layer with a thin metalli c inner layer. You could use a section of PVC water pipe if you painted the inside with metallic paint. You could form the tube from metal flashing and cover the outside with several coats of latex paint. The corrugated cardboard method works w ell and it is still the way I generally do it. Once you have everything all glued in place, double check the surface of the reflector. Make sure that the tape is wor ked firmly into place, and that there are no holes in the covering of tape. Soon it will be immersed in liquid.
