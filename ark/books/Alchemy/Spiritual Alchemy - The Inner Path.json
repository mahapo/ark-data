Vaughan © May 2005 3 TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE I humbly present this work in a spirit of celebration. Robert Ambelain would have approved of the Martinist group at Yahoogroups.com! In his Warning to the Reader he stresses that his reasons for making this information available in print, is to reach out to Martinists who have not received the initiation he describes (surely the Rose Croix d’ Orient?). He adds the caution that the vast majority of those who have received the scant teachings and accompanying regime have done nothing with them, but hoard them up as another certificate to covet, and another elegant membership to drop into convers ation. Ambelain has never been shy about putting teachings into print, in the belief, shared by Israel Regardie when he published the famous ‘Black Book’ of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, that it is better to safeguard the rituals and teachings in the hands of the many, than see them lost in the drawer of collectors of initiation who never do anything with them, nor pass them on to the successor, as they swore to do at their initiation. He believes, as do many, that the true import of the secret i s not in the words but in their practice . He makes a specific point in this text of the manner in which well - thumbed old manuscripts bear the spiritual imprint of their readers ad users. The Martinist Order now sees much communication between its branch es. Indeed, as I write a number of European and American branches are coalescing into a group which, while retaining their specific rituals, initiatory successions and teachings, nevertheless recognize both the validity and the equivalence of each other’s traditions, and now allow free visitation rights and access to materials between the groups. This can only be for the good, and I only hope this precious harmonizing process continues. I would like to thank Michael Buckley, Ronald Cappello, Mark Jones, Andrew Stephenson and Gordon Stewart for their support and for their guidance and courage in this new millennium. I would especially like to thank Elias Ibrahim, whose guidance and support h a v e been invaluable . I know he very much wanted to translate th is important work, but as his commitments prevented him from applying himself to this task I was inspired to take up his mantle and complete the translation. I now offer it to the English speaking community in the hope that it will help them in their sea rch for the Summum Bonum, and the Way of the Heart. Piers A.

Vaughan © May 2005 6 WARNING TO THE READER “Woe to you, Lawyers, for ye have taken away the key of knowled ge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.” (Luke: Gospel, XI, 52) The same Rosicrucian organization which gave birth to Martinez de Pascuallis and his Elus - Cohens which had the aim of working towards the ultimate asp ect of the Great Work called “Universal Reintegration”, was stirred up thirty years later by his direct disciple, Louis - Claude de Saint - Martin, with the aim of working towards “Individual Reconciliation”. Now, by a happy coincidence, the Martinist Order of Elus Cohen came into possession of authentic documents and manuscripts from t he Eighteenth Century in 195 5, documents sought in vain up till now by historians of Martinism. That is ten years before the technique of the “inner way”, confided to L. - C. de Saint - Martin and transmitted by him directly to his intimates, was transmitted to us by a final initiation. The person who had received it in Egypt, in Cairo, thirty years earlier, gave us an alchemical diagram, a brief oral explanation, and the initiati on which went with the other two items. Moreover, this initiation has no link to classical Martinism 1 . In fact, it acts on this cardiac path on which we have written extensively, which Papus emphasized with so much vigor, and which is, in fact, an occul t technique , and not just a banal sensibility. Unfortunately, it is not achieved e asily. It requires constant vigilance of its practitioner , both to wards himself as towards others; for in the ABSOLUTE, Mercy and Justice must be balanced. It is useless t o be good and charitable is one remains envious, angry, lustful and lazy... Believing it useless an d unjust to see it reserved for so many years to a very restricted number of aspirants, considering how few of these “initiates” actually observe the discipl ine of the initiations which they have received, we have made these words of Scripture our own: “And I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.” ( Paul, Epistle to the Romans, IX, 25 ). So, he or she who ha s not had the opportunity to enter into the domain of initiations, can at least, as independent disciples of the Unknown Philosopher , work alone towards their own “reconciliation” 2 . As for the incomparable Martinists of Saint - Martin, who have been regula rly received into the secular initiatory chain of the “Unknown Superiors”, it is practically impossible to put 1 Papus had also received it, alone of the Ordre Martiniste, in this century, from another French mystic we suppose to be Sédir . We do not believe that it came from M. Philippe de Lyons, but from the Rosicrucian group in Cairo, mainly composed of Engli sh and Christian Copts, from which our own initiator had himself received it. However, we are absolutely certain that M. Philippe knew the method and the corresponding initiation. 2 From the Latin “ reconciliare ”, to reestablish, reunite. This is individu al reintegration ."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A.

All these reasons amply justify the present dissemination. A s for the proud , enviou s or avaricious , who wanted to be the sole and rare beneficiaries of this secret techniques, they should know well that it was not for their benefit that we now circulate these secrets. For they had never put them into practice! 30 November, 1960 Feast of St. Andrew"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 8 INTROD UCTION “So is Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity, for there where are the Spirit, Soul and Body, there are also Sulfur, Mercury and Salt... ” (Bernard Le Trévisan) Integrated into the traditional trilogy expressed in the triple portals of our great me tropolitan cathedrals in enigmatic bas - relief, Alchemy and its sisters, Astrology and Mysticism are the traditional knowledge portrayed ; and not learning susceptible to decantation, evolution and progress. As such, they thus comprise the complete, total and absolute sum of what we call the doctrines of Hermes : immutable in their principles (if not always in their application). So it is with wisdom that those who, both spiritually and occultly, guided the hands of the Medieval builders, and associated the m, these mysterious guardians of the “ Threshold ”, to the esoteric symbolism of the trip l e entrance to the Cathedrals. In an age where the progress of imprudent physics and chemistry have placed in the hands of man, often denuded of all spirituality or mo ral, the keys to death with which they could, as toys of their own inner anarchy, destroy the World in a few moments; it seems to be important to dissociate traditional Alchemy from those caricatures by which people have wanted to make it the distant sourc e of the destructive knowledge mentioned above. Alchemy is not solely and uniquely the search to create of material Gold, but also and above all quite another thing. Expressed originally by devotees from when it issued form the loins of its sister Myst icism , Alchemy demands of the Initiate that he places himself in the School of Nature, before finally confiding in him the keys of Adepthood 3 . So it is that these postulants apply themselves materially and experimentally in the secrecy of the laborato ry of the Hermeticist. And this follows archaic processes, using material means rigorously identical to those of its distant origins in the Royal Art of Egypt, on a “first matter” whose name, immutably kept secret, already constitutes a first arcana. T hese sam e secular rules lead the philosopher who perseveres, little by little, to the same results and to the same conclusions as his distant initiators. Like them, he will travel the same roads, marked out by the same hopes, and often suffering the same setbacks. The same immutable , symbolic unfolding of The Work, in which the most extraordinary simplicity of material means used are bound to one of the most hidden theories, and according to a lapse of time conditioned by the Stars, those celestial promo ters of Metals, and through his own knowledge, a reflection of that of First Adam, he is slowly led towards his final goal. 3 Initiate , from the Latin initium : beginning. Adept : from the Latin adeptus : who has acquired. To terms whose true meaning which the profane world frequently invert!"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 9 This goal is a strange substance, which the Chemistry of men ignores, which they have never analyzed, and which they will perhaps ignore forever. It is a substance which university theses do not describe, and whose very name makes the profane smile. This substance is the “ Chrysoprase ”, the Philosophers Stone . To obtain these fin e crystal s , of the color of ruby, to which the shad ows instantly reflect back their mysterious luminescence, the artisan of the Great Work will have met strange companions along the way: such as the Archons who stand watch over the successive thresholds of the intermediary worlds, the better to bar the wa y to the seeker, innumerable and symbolic personalities 4 : the Crow and the Swan, the Lion and the Dragon, the King and the Queen, etc., each of which poses their particular enigma for him to solve! It is only after having understood the secret meaning t hese that the pilgrim will finally see rise, shining in the heart of the metallic shadows, the Star of Compostella, which announces the end of the golden periplus 5 . Yet, divorced from any rational basis, and without any possibility for industrial applica tion, the procedure employ ed nevertheless constitutes a real spiritual enrichment for the Hermeticist, since Life will eventually deliver one of its greatest secrets to him. Now transmuted by this second Revelation , the Initiate finally becomes the Adept, and, in the plane of his inner spiritual alone , with the Arcana finally conquered, he can finally become transformed, to become and remain forever: the Illuminated One . As the mysterious Stone engenders and multiplies itself in cont inuous mathematical progression; the Illuminated One , in his turn, trans m its his own spiritual lig ht to those who , intelligent and docile prima materia , will themselves accept the need to die as lead in order to be better reborn as gold... 4 From the Latin persona : mask, appearance. 5 The pilgrimage of St . Iago of Compostella, is one of those enigmatic myths of the quest of the Great Work. Pilgrims wear a scallop shell as an emblem, also called mérell e ( can’t find a translation for this – PV ). And in the middle of the matras, as the beginning of The Wor k, upon the finally decomposed prima materia , a crystalline silver star must appear and float upon the surface – a first indication that the Operator is on the right path..."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A.

Vaughan © May 2005 11       GLOSSARY OF ALCHEMICAL AND HERMETIC TERMS W e believe it useful firstly to give fairly general definitions of the terms habitually used by authors who write about Al chemy. As a result, this little glossary will allow readers interested in studying material Alchemy and, in parallel, spiritual Alchem y, to decode obscure works, such as “ The Book of Images Without Words ”, or Mutus Liber , “ The Symbolic Treatise of the Philosopher’s Stone ” by J. C. Barchusen, and “ The Amphitheater of Eternal Wisdom ” by Henry Khunrath. Also, if he is ready familiar with t he general significance of these rather abstruse words, it will be easier for him to read the works of modern alchemists, and above all the greatest of these, Jean - Julien - Hubert Champagne, alias Fulcanelli 6 . In his two works, “ The Mystery of the Cathedral s ”, and “ Philosophical Dwellings ”, he treats exclusively of Alchemical subjects. But the definitions we give here will be useful when completed in the practical aspect of which they treat. 7 6 We have an important dossier, resulting from an inquiry patiently pursued around 1935 – 1937, by ourselves, on the real identity of Fulcanelli. This dossier includes recollections of those who worked with him from 1907, of those who were his collaborators during the course of his ardent life as an adept , photographs and documents whic h show, without any possible argument , that Fulcanelli and Jean - Julien - Hubert Champagne were one and the same person! Regarding this identity, we fear no contradiction whatsoever , and moreover we possess a photograph of an essential dedication which make the proof incontestable. 7 Note that the terms are in English alphabetical order – in the book they are, of course, in French alphabetical order. Please note also that I have translated those terms I could find: not all ancient alchemical terms are obvi ous! I have indicated those I could not translate in red , in the hope that others can help – PV."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A.

Alludel Apparatus composed of vessels superposed and linked together, to permit a slow sublimation. Amalgamation Intimate union of sever al metallic elements into a very homogeneous and malleable whole. Angel Sometimes a symbol of sublimation, or ascension of a volatile principle, as in the drawings of “ Viatorium Spagyricum ”. Animals As a general rule, which one finds oneself in presenc e of two animals of the same species but of different sexes (such as a lion and lioness, dog and bitch), it signifies Sulfur and Mercury prepared in accordance with The Work, or also the fixed and the volatile. The male represents the fixed, Sulfur; the f emale represents the volatile, Mercury. United, the animals express the conjunction of the newly - weds, marriage. If they are fighting: fixation of the volatile or volatilization of the fixed. See the drawings of Basil Valentinus 8 in “ The Twelve Keys of Philosophy ”. Animals may also symbolize the Elements: Earth (lion, bull), Air (eagle), Water (fish, whale), Fire (dragon, salamander). If a terrestrial animal appears in a hermetic image with an aerial animal, they signify respectively the fixed and th e volatile. Apollo The sun, gold.

Crown Symbol of chemical royalty, of metallic perfection. In “La Margarita Preciosa”, the six metals are firstly represented as slaves, bareheaded at the feet of the king, Gold. But then, after their transmutation, they are drawn with a crown upon the head. From this, in spiritual alchemy, comes the sentence of L. - C. de Saint - Martin : “All man is his own king...”, that is to say, all men within them the possibility of returning to their lost “royal state”, in the spirit ual and angelic plane.

It sometimes signifies the color red, fina l stage of The Work, or even the color white which precedes it. See also Magic Ruby. Salt Also called Arsenic, one of the three mysterious Principles composing the body. It has nothing whatsoever in common with common salt. It is not other than the uni on off Sulfur and Mercury in the metals, from which it results. Besides, the reciprocal activity of spirit and soul, or soul and the psychic double, constitutes the body of human beings. Salt can also be compared to the “sum” of the addition of two facto rs 10 .

Secret Fire Universal spirit enclosed in the heart of metallic darkness, spark of life enclosed in all that is in its natural primitive state. 10 Ambelain often interplays the two words ‘ sel ’ and ‘ scel ’ in the book. ‘ Scel ’ is old French for ‘ sel ’ or salt. While he claims to use ‘ Scel ’ for arsenic, he really uses both terms interchangeably. Therefore I have used the term ‘ salt ’ throughout the book whether he uses ‘ scel ’ or ‘ sel ’. Also, as this is a book on Spiritual Alchemy , the use of arsenic is academic! – PV."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A.

Vaughan © May 2005 18 I GENERAL O BSERVATIONS ON ALCHEMY Hermetic terminology uses words and expressions which do not have direct correspond ence with their equivalents in the profane language. It is indispensable to define what one understands by essential words which are the names of the constitutive elements of Primary Matter, and of its evolution towards the ultimate state: Gold, symbol o f perfection at the heart of the metallic life. A) The Four Elementa r y Qualities – Cold , the origin of fixation, is manifested by a complete or partial absence of vibration, whose effect is to coagulate or crystallize Matter, by destroying the principle of expansion which can be found in Hot (preservation). Its action is thus astringent, fixing, slowing, crystallizing. – Wet , origin of femininity, is translated as a vibration of nature which is attractive, mutable, unstable, supple, softening, relaxing wh ich, penetrating atoms, divides homogeneity and units heterogeneity, and thereby provokes the involution of Matter, or its disaggregation. Its activity is temperate, supple, emollient, dispersing. – Dry , origin of reaction, is manifested by a vibration o f retentive , erethic and irritating nature, which contradicts and retains the given impulse. Its activity is retractive. – Hot , origin of masculinity, is translated by a vibration of expansive nature, dilating, rarifying, which provokes the evolution of atom s. Its action is vitalizing, en nerving, stimulating, dynamic. In Man, these four Qualities give: – Cold : impassibility, skepticism, egotism, passive desire of submission; – Wet : passivity, variation, assimilation, passive desire of submission; – Hot : reaction, opposition, retention, passive desire of domination; – Dry : expansion, enthusiasm, action, active desire of persuasion. B) The Four Elements – Earth : the reactive acti on of Salt on Cold divides it, and thus, in opposing its total fixation , transforms it into the element Earth , the principle of concentration and reception."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A.

Chemistry as well, in discovering materials and products hitherto completely unknown, is showing us that the ancient adage is right when it states: “Omnia ab un o, et in unum omnia...” that is to say that one is in all, and all is in one. Basil Valentinus, from his Benedictine Abbey, was already proposing in principle this magisterial unity: “All things come from the one seed; they have all been birthed in the beginning by the same Mother...” (Basil Valentinus: “The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony”) And, in the spiritual plane, Jacob Boehme also affirms: “The Soul of Man, Demons, Holy Angels, all come from the one Source... And Man contains within himself the pa rt of the Exterior World that the Demon also contains within himself, but in a different form...” Jacob Boehme: “Of the Election of Grace”) Long before these philosophers, traditional Gnosis had already proposed 11 this concept in its affirmation of the doct rine of Emanation , affirming that spiritual Creatures ha d been emanated by a Unique Source: God - Abyss , and absolutely not created ex nihilo 12 , by means of successive emissions of Secondary Causes to the Primary Causes, Tertiary Caus es to the Secondary Cause s, etc., from the ONE - ORIGINAL, Who is God. The consequence of this doctrine: all that are thus of divine origin and that find themselves here below, degenerate and lessened in their spiritual potential, prisoners of a gross World, may yet claim their fo rmer estate again; and this work of regeneration is called Reintegration. Alchemy consequently divides itself into three probatory stages: a) The Work , the transmutation of imperfect metals into pure gold. 11 In the original, “ transposait ” which means ‘transposed’. I feel this is a misprint, and have altered it to ‘proposed’ – PV. 12 Out of nothing – PV."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 23 b) The Elixir of Life , a type of universal medicine, capable of healing almost any ailment or infirmity, and assuring considerable longevity, even immortality. One should probably only take this affirmation to be in the spiritual sense. c) Universal Reintegration , that is to say the regeneration of the entire Cosmos, of all spiritual Creatures, the ultimate goal of true Alchemy . Jacob Boehme effectively tells us this, with regard to this final aspect of the Great work: “There is no real difference between Eternal Birth , Reintegration , and the discovery of the Philosopher’s Stone . Everything having issued forth from Unity, all must return to it in the same manner...” (Jacob Boehme: “De Signatura Rerum”) Concerning the mysterious Elixir of L ife 13 , we can find an echo in these words of Eckhartshausen: “The r e - birth is threefold: firstly, the rebirth of our reason; secondly, that of our heart and will; thirdly, our physical rebirth. Many pious men, who seek God, have been regenerated in spirit and will, but few have known corporeal rebirth...” (Eckhartshausen: “The Cloud Upon The Sanctuary”) Still, it is convenient to distinguish between Alchemists and ’huffers and puffers’ . The former, philosophers in possession of an ancient doctrine ( Gnosis ) have specific theories which do not allow them to stray from cer tain limits in their research. Their field of experimentation is the metallic world. The latter, on the contrary, are people unaware of esoteric knowledge and learning, empiricism being their chief guide 14 ; happy, in their pride , to defile the most heter oclite products of the three kingdoms, working without the least hesitation on the strangest substances, and also on the most repugnant natural residues. The Alchemists preserved and demonstrated the sound basis of Hermeticism and Alchemy . The ‘ huffers and puffers ’ ignored them. B ut they invented Chemistry. * * * The existence of a Spiritual Alchemy , element of the individual Reintegration of the Adept, is proven without contest if one reads the ancient authors. There is no doubt that they were al l good Chrisitans! But surely this is because they understood that Knowledge and Wisdom must work in tandem: that Knowledge without Wisdom is worse than Ignorance alone. 13 ‘ Souffleurs’ , literally ‘ reciters ’ , but as ‘souffler’ also means ‘to breathe’ or ‘to puff’, the idea is more like ‘huffers and puffers’ , which I used instead – PV. 14 ‘ Empiriques au premier chef ’ – PV."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A.

According to the second aim, Man is thus the philosophical athanor in which the prepar ation of the Virtues is accomplished , and it is in this sense, according to the mystics, that one should listen to these words: “ For The Work is with you and within you, so that, when you find it in yourself, where it continually resides , you will also h ave it with you always, wherever you are, be it on land or sea... Hermes Trismegistus: ‘ The Seven Chapters ’...” (Albert Poisson: “Theories and Symbols of the Alchemists”) Let us also quote Basil Valentinus: “On these matters, know, O my passionate friend of the Chemical Art , that Life is uniquely a true Spirit , and that, in consequence, all that the vulgar and ignorant person thinks to be dead, must, in return, be led to a incomprehensible life, visible and spiritual, and, in that, must be preserved...: (Basil Valentinus: “The Twelve Keys of Philosophy” V th Key) “In brief, if you wish to create our Stone, be without sin, and persevere in Virtue. May your spirit be illuminated by Light and Truth. After acquiring the Divine gift you desire, take a resolution t o offer your hand to the bemired poor, to help and relieve those who are in misfortune...” (Basil Valentinus: “The ‘Rébis’ 16 of the Twelve Keys”) Indeed, and this is a curious fact, the essential elements, successively associated with this transmutation, an d with metallic Pyrites, and of carnal Man; these elements are identical in number, classification and `succession.

The Adept obtains the Chry s oprase , the Philosophical Stone (Fig. 1).

As such, Understanding is also the absolute Knowledge (Gnosis) of Divine Things . For partner it has Chokmah (Wisdom), which clearly expresses the idea of choosing the best from among all the gifts accessible to Understanding ( Binah ). It thus presupposes that this does not operate but through elimination. It is spontaneous, intelligent and comprehensive submission to a Being which it perceives as the dominating power. As such, it is discrimination between Good and Evil, and the learning of this. So, Understanding is ultimate knowledge, and Wisdom is the use to which it is put. A s is born at the appointed time, from the union of Sulfur and Mercury of the Wise , in the Ph ilosopher’s Egg (which the Alchemists still called the Sublimator ) , the “Red Stone”, the Chrysoprase , is thus born in the Soul of Man, this athanor (or philosophical furnace) , whose Heart is the Sublimator (or Philosophical Egg ) – Total Illumination, the d ecisive factor in Reintegration (Fig. 4). And t his ultimate term for the Inner Work bears the name of Divine Light . * * * The Alchemists, so reticent about all things concerning the Great Work, were careful not to be open about their fire , nor on th e degree of heat necessary for success in their works. Knowledge of their thermal conductivity and the degree was regarded by them as one of the most important keys of the Great Work. Let us hear Raymond Lully: “Many Alchemists are in error, for they d o not know the disposition of the fire, which is the key to the Work, for they dissolve and coagulate at the same time; they cannot succeed, for they are blinded by their ignorance...” (Raymond Lully: “Vade Mecum or Short Treatise on the Chemical Art”) In fact, with the Matter prepared once, cooking alone can change it into the philosophical stone: “ I only command you to cook; cook at the beginning, cook in the middle, cook at the end, and do not do any other thing...”"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 28 (Anonymous: “The Turf 19 of the Philosop hers”) The Alchemists distinguished between many types of fire : 1) Humid Fire – this is the bain - marie 20 , which provides a constant temperature. 2) Supernatural or Artificial Fire – which designates acids. This comes from when Alchemists remarked that acids produced an elevation of temperature in their diverse reactions, and also that they had the same effect as fire upon the corpus. They rapidly disorganized and destroyed their basic aspect. 3) Natural or Ordinary Fire – obtained by combustion. In general, Alchemists used neither c h ar c o al nor wood to warm the Philosophical Egg . It would have required continual surveillance, and it would have been almost impossible to obtain a constant temperature. Also, Mark - Antonio rails against ignorant “ huffers and puff ers ”, who use charcoal: “Of what use are these violent flames, since wise men never use ardent charcoal, nor flaming wood, to perform the Hermetic Work...” (Marc - Antonio: “Light shining itself out of the Shadows”) The hermetic Philosophers therefore used oil lamps, with an asbestos wick, which is easy to maintain, and which gives an almost uniform warmth. This is the fire which they have veiled, and of which only a few have spoken openly, Albert Poisson tells us. In the plane of spiritual Alchemy, Fir e is represented by Prayer ... “ Or et labor ...”, pray and work, the old Masters tell us. Our Fire has absolutely nothing to do with those psycho - physical practices, which rely on more or less Baroque practices, o r on speci al modes and rhythms of respiration. The se practices, generally classified under the term of Hatha Yoga , are generally claimed to help towards the preservation of youth and health in the West. But experience has not proved this; in fact to the contrary : Europeans who partake of the practic e (often for reasons of snobbism), do not finally come to Illumin ation, indeed even simply to mysticism, nor ha s any transcendental knowledge been obtained . If such acquisitions are realized, it is t hr o ugh other techniques that they must find it: Bhakti - Yoga , Dhuani - Yoga , Karma - Yoga , Samadhi - Yoga , Raja - Yoga . Alchemists admit to there being many degrees to their fire, depending on whether The Work is more or less advanced. They do this by regulating the number of threads composing the wicks: 19 Or “ rabble ” – both are equally odd! – PV. 20 For non - chefs, this is a metal container filled with water, in which a second container with the ingredient which needs gentle heat is place.

Vaughan © May 2005 29 “First o f all make a gentle fire, as if you had only four threads in your wick, until the Matter begins to blacken. Then augment it to fourteen threads. The Matter bathes, and becomes grey. Finally, use twenty - four threads, and you will achieve perfect whitenes s...” (Happelius: “Aphorismi basiliani”) Here, in the realm of spiritual Alchemy, we have a precious clue to its esotericism. The fire goes from four to fourteen, and from fourteen to twenty - four. To the quaternary at the beginning is added a denary , the n another denary , so: tetrad + decade + decade If these words do not evoke Alexandrine Gnosis and its Aeons for us, it should suffice for us to remember that the first degree of fire, that used at the beginning of The Work, is called Egyptian Fire , becau se it must (in material terms), equal the maximum summer temperature of this country: “Make your fire in proportion to the heat in the months of June and July...” (Anonymous: “Dialog of Marie and Aros”) Now, while the author is anonymous, the manuscript is most certainly Egyptian! This progressive evolution of fire in The Work is thus repeated in spiritual Alchemy through a progressive evolution of Prayer and all its Asceticism , their amplitude, their frequency, and above all their immediate and intende d goals. Wanting to pass through without stopping (a phrase full of esoteric meaning 21 !) would be most dangerous. Unfortunately , t his is not uncommon in the history of Mysticism, and Neophytes who were poorly prepared for the shock of intuitive revelatio ns, forbidden before such unexpected psychic events, deviated and strayed into irrational paths. It was to ward off such dangers that the Churches (Latin and Eastern) imposed the principle of a “Director of Conscience” for their faithful members desirous o f penetrating such domains. Let us listen to two other old Masters: “You will never leave the vessel to get too warm, so that you can always touch it with a bare hand without fear of burning. And this will continue throughout the time of the solution...” Rypley: “Treatise of the Twelve Gates”) “Make a vaporizing fire, mastered, continuous, not violent, subtle, surrounded, airy, closed in, dutiful 22 , altering...” (Bernard de Trevisan: “The Book of Natural Philosophy of Metals”) 21 But not i n English!

We are now going to study the Elements of our Work, Principles to be firstly laid out, then those born from these, which are ca lled the Essential Virtues , nine in number: - Four called Cardinal (from the Latin cardo : hinge, door, essential element); - Three called Theological , because they essentially have God as their object; - Two called Sublim e , because th ey are the most elevated result of the practice of the first seven, and are, in a way, their sublimation. All correspond to Spiritual Entities linked to the Divine Plane, a little like the Eternal Ideas of Plato. In fact we read this in “ The Shepherd ”, attributed to Hermas of Cum ae , one of the four Apostolic Fathers, immediate inheritors and successors of the Apostles in the oral tradition of Christianity: “And these Virgins, who are they?... – They are Spirits of Sanctification. Nobody may be admitted into the Realm of God without having previously been clothed by them in their own Vestment. If you receive only the Name of the Son of God without previously having received form the hands of these Virgins their vesture, it will serve you nothing! For these Virgins are the V irtues of the Son of God . If you bear His Name without possessing His Virtue, it in vain that you bear His Name..” (Hermas: “The Shepherd”, IX, 13) “Without the help of these Virgins, it is impossible for you to preserve His Commandments, I see that th ey take pleasure in your “habitations”, only clean it well! They will have pleasure in living in a proper “habitation”, for they are themselves chaste, pure, active and rejoice in the great favor of the Lord. As long as cleanliness reigns in your “habita tion”, they will live there. But the least stain they encounter, they will immediately depart, for these Virgins cannot suffer the least stain...” (Hermas: “The Shepherd”, X, 3) 23 “ Brûler du karma ”, a strange phrase with no obvious meaning .

This Key consists solely of a C olor , manifested to the Artisan from the earliest part of the work... ” This color is expressed in the fi rst plate of the book. In the first drawing of the countryside of Lower Egypt, in which a proud Sphinx appears in profile in the dying night, beside a retort, an athanor and the “ Mutus Liber ” opened to its first sentence, a sardonic crow, with win gs sprea d , stands upon a human skull. This enigmatic collection evokes Memphis, capital of ancient Egypt. founded in olden times by Menes. Now Memphis signifies blackness . It is probable that one can find this etymology in the term mephitic , which describes a malodorous gas. Here we are in the hermetic stage of putrefaction . If we were to doubt it, the Hermetic crow is there to remind us. The skull also makes us bear in mind the words of Scripture: “In truth, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat dies, it r emains alone. But if it dies, bears much fruit... 26 ” (John: Gospel: XII, 24) And so, at the beginning of the Work, the necessary Putrefaction must appear, symbolized by the “c aput corvi ”.

It is c ompletely useless to try and go further if this ineluctable phase is not achieved. Here, again, let us hear the voice of the old Masters: “Firstly it is necessary for the Body to be dissolved for the Doors to the opened, so that Nature might operate...” (Sethon, the Cosmopolite: “Novum lumen chymicaum de lapide Philosophorum”) For: “Depending on the purity or impurity of the elements compo sing Sulfur or Mercury, perfect or imperfect metals will be produced...” ( Roger Bacon: “The Mirror of Alchemy”) And: “It is not possible for him to make any have gene ration without corruption...” (Huginus a Barma: “The Touchstone”) Now, it isn’t possible to make the Aspirant evolve in the sense that we understand it, if he won’t agree to admit once and for all , that everyth ing he has acquired in bits and pieces all over the place, often in poorly digested lectures, or teachings which don’t conform to the doctrine he wishes to follow and apply, will all do nothing but oppose his mystical journey. This pseudo - knowledge and fa lse wisdom have no part to play here . H e must realize that: “Vulgar chemistry is the art of destroying the compounds which Nature has formed, and Hermetic Chemistry is the art of working with Nature to perfect them...” (Dom Pernety: “Greek and Egyptian Fab les”) “Take care that the conjunction of the Husband and his Spouse is not pe r formed without first removing their clothe s and ornaments , both from their countenances as from the rest of their bodies, so that they enter the Tomb as pure as when they entere d the world ...” (Basil Valentin: “The twelve keys of Wisdom”) And it is only after having made everything clean, and upon the ruins of an inner and originally degraded edifice, that the Aspirant may once more set out a road which is completely new for him: “You will know that complete mastery consists of nothing more than dissolution 29 , then coagulation ...” (Albert the Great: “The Book of Eight Chapters”) * 29 “Tu sauras que tout le Magistère ne c onsiste qu’en une dissolution, puis en une coagulation...” – PV."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A.

We normally only consider five physical senses: sight, smell, taste, touch and he aring. Classical Theology adds two internal senses: imagination and memory. Classical Illuminism adds two more higher, psychic senses, which are clairvoyance and clairaudience. There are thus five, seven or nine senses, depending on the plane on which o ne is studying them. It is evidently the one with nine that spiritual Alchemy uses, and that is the one that we are going to study. 1 st ) Touch The sense of T ouch is only dangerous in the profane world inasmuch as it awakens our passions, or in contacts susceptible to wound our health or our life (wounds, operations). In the spiritual world, it is quite different. The feel of a firearm, placed in the hand of an adolescent, can awaken in him a desire for power; in the hand of a hunter or a jealous perso n the desire to kill. In the realm of Touch , caresses can similarly constitute appeals to the sensual pleasures of the senses, and as such, to Lust . For the Aspirant, and in the realm of the Inner Way, contact with some objects charged with mysterious p ower, can be effective, for good or ill. One should avoid all contact with f unereal remains (bones, skulls); cadavers (their transportation and burial as an act of charity is clearly quite another matter); funereal objects (shrouds, coffin nails, cemetery earth, etc); manuscripts and books on the subject of lower magic, which are susceptible to have received a magical consecratio n which might rend er them spiritually malefic. Classified i n this same domain are pentacles of low m agic; and ritual objects fro m witches 31 and fetishists. More importantly, one should take care to avoid the worst injury to the Divine Plan, by holding sacred and holy things, whose contact is forbidden to the profane, in sacrilegious hands – a presumption which has often caused spir itual loss in some Magistri, however intelligent they might be. For the same reason one should refuse to submit, under some vague initiatory pretext, to being touched in certain inappropriate places, touches susceptible to awakening in us those centers of power which should, on the contrary, most definitely be left asleep. Nothing is more dangerous than these psychic “awakenings”, performed by semi - profanes who do not understand their incalculable significance, or who, cunningly, use their “disciple” as a test subject, without any mercy...The sense of Touch corresponds to the Element Air . 2 nd ) Taste 30 Or, which are their instruments (“ qui en sont les instruments ”) – PV. 31 Sorcier de campagne – PV."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A.

Vaughan © May 2005 36 to luxurious and bea utiful bindings as in manuscripts or rare texts, and to the number and quality of our books. It is Taste which, happily tamed, lets us avoid giving i n to such temptation, where softness of empty words, the flight of shallow sentences, and unpublished theo ries nicely enunciated, only serve to mask the most complete emptiness: all things which would risk bemiring us in pseudo - teachings without a single real initiatory character. The sense of Taste corresponds to elementary Water . Water , with its mysteri ous Intelligences which the Kabbalah calls Undines , is the domain of Feeling. We should therefore avoid succumbing to an emotionality which is also shallow. Love is a word excessively muddled throughout the ages 32 , a word which usually masks complete em ptiness. True Love is constructive; and this is the A gapé o f the Greeks, which admits no indulgence or weakness of Error, but rather the care of Justice and Truth. 3 rd ) Smell The immoderate use of perfumes in the profane world, and the influence that we allow them to have over us, are often only pretexts to satisfy our sensuality or incite us to lust. It is the same in the realm of aromatic combustions, familiar to Occultists. The odiferous emissions which rise from earthenware pots 33 and censers are the summoning waves, intended for “worlds” that are ontologically different to ours. They are not intended to satisfy our sense of smell, nor our inferior desire to create a mystical atmosphere. They are even less intended to impress the profane, giving him the impression that that we possess the secret of specific mysterious fumigations, letting him s uppose that the evolution of one’s mysticism and spiritual growth depends upon banal olfactory impressions. Quite the contrary, they should serve to creat e within us, at a precise moment , an inner atmosphere which allow us to perceive the spiritual contact or activity of Beings different to us. On the other hand, if there are odiferous emissions able to make us take conscious notice of higher “worlds” and Entities, there are those which are capable of making us descend into the opposite depths: odors which , sui generis , incite sexuality, magical perfumes putting us in contact with the demoniac planes. These fumigations should evidently be avoided, or onl y used in those cases prescribed by our Master. Smell corresponds to elementary Air . 4 th ) Sight 32 “ L’Amour est un mot par trop galvaudé depuis nombre de lustres ” – lustre could refer to ‘ lu stra ’ , periods of five years, or to glimmers of brilliance. I assumed the former meaning – PV. 33 Casseroles – PV."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 37 It is not that spectacles capable of awakening sexual desire should be avoided at first sight . The important thing is never to fall into excess in this d omain. St. Clement of Alexandria told us with just reasons that: “We should never be ashamed of organs which God was not ashamed to give us...” But there are, for all people, spectacles which are unhealthy because they appeal to the grossest instincts of t he human being: cock fights, bull running, modern hunting, dog fights, all of which are the massacre of animals without justification, capital executions, etc... At a level which is less grave, we find boxing matches, catch fights 34 , which are hardly more e levated spectacles for man. For the Occultist, the equivalent is a vision of particular books, libraries, collections, pictures, which can excite Curiosity , Envy , Avarice : mysterious diagrams, enigmatic texts. One might add the sight of some more or le ss flattering and pompous costumes or ornaments, which incite Pride or Envy ; imprudent teachings (an aspect of Gluttony , if one then strongly desires to acquire these things or books) ; or Anger (if we prevent this with violence, either internally or extern ally by contrast), or Sloth (if these things incite us to a peevish quietism). There are journals and books which are true psychic poison, from the reactions to which they give birth or violently excite within us: notably the political press. 5 th ) Hear ing This mortification (another term which perfectly evokes practical Alchemy) is linked to that of Speech , and incites us neither to say nor to hear anything with might be contrary to Charity , Purity or Humility . Especially in the context of Charity , w e should say or hear nothing which might awaken in another, as in ourselves, a single echo capable of arousing one or several of the seven Deadly Sins. Therefore we should avoid expounding too much in reciting certain facts which could trigger Anger , O ffense , Jealousy , Lust or Envy in another. Among Occultists, this prudence consists of not expounding at length on certain procedures (magical, theurgic, mystical), upon the extraordinary aspect of certain spiritual or psychic experiences, or upon the rar ity or interest of certain texts or books. This is in order to not awaken in the Soul of the Aspirant a desire for power, vain curiosity, or desire for possessions ; where Envy , Pride and Avarice make their home. Finally, one proscribes noise in general, in which atmosphere the Soul neither knows how to find itself nor to understand itself: discordant and inharmonious dance music, linked to animal sexuality, or overly martial music, which dissolves any psychic atmosphere (military marches, hunting fanfare s, etc). Hearing is analogous to the Salt 35 Principle . Two senses, as we have previously mentioned, complete the quintet of external senses. We will not study these. 34 Les combats...de catch – PV. 35 Ambelain uses the archaic term of ’scel’ instead of ‘ sel’ for salt – PV."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 38 6 th ) and 7 th ) Imagination and Memory Imagination and Memory are two precious faculti es, which provide Understanding with the materials it needs for its work and practice; and Wisdom the possibility of portraying Truth through images and examples which makes it more striking, more alive and in the same way more attractive. Therefore, one should not strive to atrophy these faculties, but rather to discipline and subordinate their activity to the empire of reason and will. If not, delivered from themselves, they will populate the Soul with a throng of remembrances, images which will dissipa te and squander its energies, lead it lose precious time and give rise to a thousand temptations and relapses. It is absolutely necessary to discipline them and put them at t he service of the two Sublime Virtues, which are, as we have said: Wisdom and U nderstanding . In order to better suppress the flights of these two inner senses, Imagination and Memory , one should first of all chase from one’s consciousness all dangerous images and memories as soon as they manifest themselves, recalling those possibi lities (future) and realities (past) which, carrying us to the heart of present, past or future temptations, would ipso facto be a source of failure and ruin. But, as there is often a sort of psychological determinism , which makes us pass from unimportan t reveries to the perilous games of a partial ly invaded imagination, one should arm oneself against this danger by immediately and unceasingly rejecting all valueless thoughts. They already make us lose precious time, and they open the way, preparing our imagination for other thoughts which are infinitely more dangerous. The best method of succeeding in this sort of “filtration” is assuredly to apply oneself totally to the work of the moment, however banal it may be: whether it be work, study, or habitua l activities, modest and material actions that they are. In any case, this is the best way to do what one must do well, by concentrating all one’s intelligence and activity into the task at hand. Finally, Imagination and Memory have a grounding which i s familiar to the Aspirant, and that is the realm of human sciences, both profane and occult, without which many aspects of higher Knowledge would remain veiled to him . It is also and above all that of the traditional initiatory writings , in which, throug h the intervention of esotericism, Imagination m ay have access to the Truths of Understanding , and Memory prepare the Certainties of Wisdom ... These two inner senses correspond, Imagination to the Mercury Principle , and Memory to the Sulfur Principle , resp ectively."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 39 8 th and 9 th ) Clairvoyance and Clairaudience One must not confuse Prophecy and Divination . In the latter case, the thousand and one forms of the divination , through the intervention of poorly defined Entities which are no part of the Divin e Plane ( at the very most of intermediate “planes”) allow one to access in a more or less precise manner a more or less proximate future, as well (and more easily, one might imagine!) as recovering the elements of a more or less recent past, too l. In thi s case Divination adapts itself to a type of convention , in which codified elements give the Seer or Seeress access to the means of communication of the Entities whose attention we have just attracted. These are expressed through conventional symbols, ag reed – either implicitly and tacitly – with the divine force. The prophetic plane is altogether different. Traditional Scripture show us three aspects of prophecy and three different types of interpreters. First of all there is the ro’eh , or seer, he who sees with the eyes of the spirit what other men do not see. Then there is the hozeh , who is analogous to the first, but who has more particularly served to identify prophets and soothsayers of false gods. Finally there is the nabi , or interpreter of God, who is not only he who sees, but he who speaks, despite himself, the divine language. In this latter case, and most of the time, his voice necessarily is but the reflection of an inner audition, eve n if it is instantly associated with the voice of th e nabi . Thus the nabi is the seer, who then expresses in his own language, and according to an ultimate need, what he has seen, or believed to be divorced from his vision. The nabi is also the hearer , in whom audition and elocution are conf u se d by him. What characterizes these two heralds of the Divine Plane is that they never manifest themselves for unimportant reasons, for individual problems or for concerns which are too human. They are uniquely created for ultimate ends and for the defense of inte rests superior to the collectivity. Therefore the Aspirant who sees one of these two faculties developing within him: clairvoyance or clairaudience , must above all avoid using them to solve problems with no spiritual consequences. He should no longer i magine himself to be in a psychic relationship with God, the Virgin Mary, or the Great Archangels! It is here that the gift of discernment of Spirits will be indispensable to him. He should remember that all manifestations of inferior Spirits, and even m ore importantly of Dark Spirits, are always marked by the grotesque, of the inconsequential, or which bear within themselves the seeds of anarchy. If the periods of manifestations of these faculties coincide with a generally immoral or amoral inner sense ; if sexuality reveals itself to be more insistent ; if ready speculations accompany this type of phenomenon, then the Aspirant knows full well that he is the toy of inferior Entities. All the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 40 more obvious if he gives out personal theories to flatter his pr ide, and if he believes himself to have been chosen for his merits and intellectual qualities, and if he believes himself to have been called to complete or modify some religious corpus , indeed he overthrows traditional teachings which are known for their excellence and high spirituality. What characterizes prophecy, is that if the prophet is integrated into the framework of a real Revelation , and if he truly speaks in His name, he would be unable to become a spirit of contradiction and a source of confus ion. The prophet is always “possessed” of the Holy Spirit, the diviner is always “possessed” of an Intermediary Spirit, and the medium is always “possessed” of a Dead Person. Identifying the source of their prophecies is to locate the level of their spi rituality. Clairvoyance corresponds to Mercury of the Wise , and Clairaudience to Sulfur of the Wise . * * * In conclusion, the mortification of the nine senses of Man should embrace all the biological and psychic activities endured by his Body and Sou l. For is it the Whole Man who is prone to falling if he is not absolutely disciplined. Wit hout doubt is it not true to say that it is the Will which sins, but it has accomplices and instruments in the Body , with its external senses, and the Soul with i ts internal senses. Once more the Spirit is prisoner, and in a jail more somber than before. * * * The purification of sexual impulses and their mastery We believe it useful to add a few specific instructions in the realm where the battle is particu larly difficult and painful, that of sexual desire and the strong amorous passions which sometimes proceed from this, the source of so many errors, indeed even disgrace or crime. T he key of this liberation rest s in a true appreciation of the impermanent character of corporeal beauty and purely carnal joys. This is very simple and ancient formula. Firstly, one reminds oneself that the necrosis which takes over so rapidly in the tomb and strips the skin from the body when the soul has left, consists of a progressive blackening of the flesh, which change s color little by little, from a rose white shade to the darkest ebony black . Then, strange mushrooms grow up on this dead flesh , a very bright jade green in color, seven to ten millimeters or more in diame ter, and about a centimeter or more in height. In the darkness these mushrooms shine with a green luminescence. Th e technique of purifying sexual desire consists of a course of meditations, void of all fumigations , in which one visualizes an “ideal woma n” (or “ideal man”), of the kind one has"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 41 forever imagined, gifted with brilliance and all possible charms, detached in a luminous body upon a completely dark base, silhouette appearing as though shining from the inside , and sitting, immobile, in the postur e called the “lotus position” (also called “ à la Tu rque ”, hands flat against the thighs). Yet only the face, chest, arms, are endowed with this ideal perfection. The thighs, legs, abdomen and sexual parts are necrosed, as described above . The nails are imagined very long, rolled in on themselves, as in real life (from the fact that they continue to grow after death and from the emaciation of the extremities, which thus comes away from the roots). In place of an imaginary ideal person, these meditations can focus on an object of passion from whom one wishes to liberate oneself 36 . Novices of Tibetan monasteries practice, not for a long time 37 , before a Charnel House, what their masters call “the Meditation upon the Horrible”. The teaching consists of vis ualizing , beneath the form of a living being, the skeleton which it will one day fatally become, a symbol of the Death which is carried within in latent form . One might, given this previously described technique, take on this procedure. Then, perhaps, o ne might unite with the liberation achieved by Louis - Claude de Saint - Martin, which a “seer” of that period exclaim ed in contemplating him from afar: “Now he has thrown the world behind him...” * * * B) The Seven Deadly Sins “And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns...and on his heads a blasphemous name.” (John: Apocalypse, XIII, 1) In the Hebrew Kabbalah, it is said that the Tree of Life (Otz Chaim) corresponds in the manifest world to the Little Tree of Life , which i s called Kallah , the “Fiancée”. Inverted and opposed to this is the Little Tree of Death , “The Prostitute”, Qlippoth . The Sephiroth flourish and shine on the Tree of Life , which are the spheres of evolving manifestation. On the Tree of Death flourish an d shine the Qlippoth , or spheres of involutive manifestation. 36 We do not recommend this method, be lieving it to be dangerous. Besides, there is a sanctity in marriage. The Rose+Croix of former times were married, and the Apostles too. We recommend what follows. 37 “il n’y a pas encore très longtemps” – I take this to mean it is a recent practice, but as usual could be wrong .

Vaughan © May 2005 42 From this it is evident that for each of the seven essential Virtues (four Cardinal and three Theological) correspond seven opposed Virtues (from the Latin virtus : power). These are the Seven Deadly S ins. As this Septenary is crowned with the two Sublime Virtues of Wisdom and Understanding , so two dark manifestations oppose them. These are: against Understanding , Blindness (of the Spirit), and again st Wisdom , (fundamental) Error . Let us st udy this malefic ensemble in the spiritual plane. * * * 1 st ) Greed Greed takes the erring Mystic to an isolation which is both complete and sterile. Unveiling, revelation, teaching, transmission, all that he has himself receiv ed or learned f r o m other s are always painful and shocking to him. He hoards books and manuscripts, documents and initiations, but never conceives that he might be but a simple instrument of transmission. The initiatory lines to which he has managed to attach himself he now divid es up anew, multiplying the tests, degrees and classes with the sole aim of delaying as long as possible the moment when he will be obliged to end his own role and make of yesterday’s student his equal today, and perhaps even his superior tomorrow. Greed corresponds to Earth , and is the opposite of Prudence , in its very excess. 2 nd ) Gluttony Gluttony lead s our Occultist to devour those documents, books, treatises, and schemes which are accessible to him without control: those doctrines which are most alien, the most disparate teachings, as well as mixed teachings which he does not reject. Keen on anything which pleases his curiosity and his appetite for knowledge, he swallows everything for better or worse, and, from this strange mixture, if Pride is also present, he tries to extract from this a personal doctrine which he is sure completes, certainly alters, the original Traditions which he had thus pillaged and confused. If on the contrary it is Sloth which comes to mix with his sensual cravings, th e very excesses of his disparate knowledge, poorly digested by a lazy spirit, will lead him on day to suddenly return to materialism, where he can enjoy his rest 38 . Gluttony corresponds to Water , and is the opposite of Temperance 39 . 38 “et il retournera au matérialisme, qu’il estimera reposant” – any better ideas for translation? – PV. 39 The text says “Température” (temperature), but I am sur e he means Temperance! – PV."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 43 3 rd ) Lu st Lust m akes him introduce a certain sensuality into all the initiatory areas where our Occultist is drawn to work. He will, a priori , be hostile to those doctrines he find too spiritual or too ascetic, and he will subscribe to the need to adjust things in a most liberal manner according to the exigencies of lower human nature. Religions and doctrines where sexuali ty plays a role (T antrism, licentious Gnosticism, Vintrasism 40 , Sexual Magic, etc) , are defended by him. For him, a mixed initiatory organization is al ways much better than an organization which is exclusively male or female! Above all, this failing is seen in the domain of easiness. He thoughtlessly transmits the initiations and teachings to which he is heir to maladjusted recipients, or those foreig n to this current. He easily cedes initiatory secrets to individuals of the opposite sex, in exchange for their favors! Finally, like the fornicators and spiritual adulterers reproached in Israel by the prophets or by the Christ, he becomes a follower of doctrines, initiations and ceremonies which are often diametrically opposed. In his interest or pleasure he will not hesitate to find his base curiosity stimulated there, turning to the lower currents when he perceives that the Higher Powers serve him for nothing in these domains. Lust corresponds to Air and is opposed to Justice . 4 th ) Sloth Sloth carries the erring Aspirant towards a sort of quietism, which leads him , without further thought, to appreciate perfection i n a trite love of God, inaction of the Soul, and absence of all external application . He is indifferent to the sickness of b eings wh o surround him, or , if he perceives it, he does nothing to care for them, bel ieving that the ills they suffer are the equitable 40 Named for Pierre - Michel Vintras (1807 – 1875) who claimed communication with angels, St. Joseph, Mary and Jesus, and founded a sect based upon erotic - mystical masses involving a bloody host – PV."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A.

Finally he loses interest in himself, and relies on Providence to give him access to moral perf ection, considering Ignorance as sure a way as Knowledge . Sloth corresponds to Fire (inverted) and is opposed to Strength . 5 th ) Envy Envy leads the pseudo - initiate to desire not only preferential places and pseudo honors, but also inspires him not to hesitate to impede, even prevent the advancement , of another, if he divines in this person a superiority which c ould eclipse his own. He suppresses doctrines, teachings, books and documents which could harm his interests. He will not cease from possessin g all that others possess, considering it an offense that there are things which he doesn’t have, even if he already decided that they would be of no use to him, and even if he is intellectually opposed to it. Envy corresponds to the Salt Principle , and opposed to Charity . 6 th ) Anger When Anger manifests itself in the Aspirant , he loses control of himself. His authoritarianism and out of control behavior do not permit him to accept that so and so among his peers is less well endowed than him. His jud gments become as hasty as they are definitive, and his impatience will bring him to bully the weak and the ignorant. And if he has the misfortune to become filled with hatred (a form even darker than Envy ), his pseudo - knowledge could make of him a black m agician. Anger corresponds to the Mercury Principle , and opposes Hope . 7 th ) Pride Pride has been called the father of all vices, and with just reason. In our brand - new Occultist, Pride leads him to imagine he is morally superior to all the profane bec ause he is intellectually more wealthy. He readily imagines himself to be in possession of secrets and teachings which have been revealed to him alone, and imagines himself destined for certain preeminence, justified by his merits. He often imagines hims elf above all to have been some famous or important person in a previous pseudo - li f e. In this environment he acquires a firm and haughty contempt for what he calls Humanity; and it is impossible for him to perceive those elite Souls who are a thousand tim es superior to him, often hidden within the banality of modest lives, all around him. In short, in the past and present, as in the future, he is one to whom all is due and who in consequence demands all. Pride corresponds to the Sulfur Principle , and o pposes Faith ."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 46 C ) The Two Spiritual Crystallizations We write separately on the two Shadowy Virtues, which oppose the two Sublim e Virtues, evoked in the preceding chapter. We saw there that Blindness oppos es Understanding , and the Silver of the Wise ; and Error oppos es Wisdom , and Sulfur or the Gold of the Wise . 8 th ) Blindness Th is Dark Power takes away discernment of Spirits, and through the allure of specie or material objects 41 , makes it impossible for us to perceive that which binds them to the opposing poles of Good and Evil, Light and Darkness. It stops up the hidden meaning of words, irremediably veils from us the esotericism and higher sense of texts, and makes us prefer the letter that kills over the spirit which brings to life. More pa rticularly, it prevents us from attaining a deep understanding of the Christian Scriptures or of another Holy Book, if one cleaves to another religion. In truth, it reigns Mistress of the Soul of all materialist s and atheist s , when they have become such through a deliberate act of will; as well as reigning over the progressive descent into Blindness that comes from a conscious letting go. It veils from us spiritual realities hidden beneath appearance , and one can say that, because of it, Eternal Truth s become in accessible to erring Man. 9 th ) Error This Dark Power brings us inner confusion, and takes away the judgment of Good and Evil, Just and Unjust, Beautiful and Ugly, Good and Bad. In these realms all d iscernment is removed, piece by piece. This becomes more serious when it clouds our sense of the true and authentic in matters of religion. By this the misguided Aspirant is not in a fit state to perceive what is of no use to him, and when the Soul has gone sufficiently far in its descent towards spiritual Darkness, it may only with difficulty contemplate a return under its own powers. Given the impossibility of distinguishing what has been lost, and clearly appreciating his situation, the misguided Aspirant will now easily mis take Evil for Good, and will obstinately imagine him self to be in the Path of Light wh en he is on the Path of Darkness. It is in the Soul of the Satanist or Luciferian that this dark Power explodes and irradiates with the greatest 41 “Nous met l’impossibilité d e percevoir, sous des espèces ou des objects matériels, ce qui relie aux poles opposes de Bien et du Mal...” – if anyone has a better, translation let me know - PV."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A.

It’s a green and ac erbic fruit as compared to a red and ripe fruit...” Fulcanelli: “The Mystery of the Cathedrals ” There exist two vitriols, says Tripied, or rather vitriol can be found in two forms: pure vitriol, and impure or gross vitriol...” (Tripied: “Philosophical Vitri ol”) In truth, according to Paracelsus, there is a soul , which he called the Predestined Element , in all things. This predestined Element is composed, according to Paracelsus, of salt, sulfur and mercury, and is drowned and disseminated in a mass forme d of phlegm and dead (or “damned”) earth , and this gives us our body, the one that we see. The dead earth is clearly the hyle of the Gnostics. We have a striking example in the vegetable kingdom. What are the various alkaloids: quinine, aconitine, etc, if not the pure and active principles of these vegetables which, once deprived of these principles, are without strength or activity? Now, in the case of material Alchemy, let us suppose that we are able to suppress this phlegm and this dead earth , then we would have pure vitriol; of not, then we have impure vitriol, and the Work will be so much the harder and longer when vitriol is more impure, or when the predetermined Element is in small er quantity. So, it is this vitriol which is the basis of the h ermetic Work; it is the primary material of the Art; it is the salt (not Scel) which, through a series of actions, will take the form of Mercury or Secret Fire , and by an intimate union of the Volatile with the Fixed, will give us Sulfur , the Philosophical Lover , attracting the Universal Spirit, the sal ammoniac of Artephius... This operational series has been summarized in a famous lapidary sentence (the words have a strange resonance) by Basil Valentinus: V isita I nteriora T erræ, R ectificando, I nvenies O ccultum L apidem...”, from which – according to a process well known to the Hebrew Kabbalists – one gets the word VITRIOL. In profane language, this phrase with its mysterious resonances, sifnifies: “Visit the entrails of the earth, and you will find the hid den stone...”"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 50 From this, we begin to understand how one should perform the first action on the stage of spiritual Alchemy. In his short work dedicated to the esoteric path of the Absolute, Grillot de Givry tells us this: “Therefore do not ask for Faith to be able to pray. Pray first; and Faith will inundate your soul! Yet I have already said enough for you to know that henceforth you must create a mystical body , which will substitute in all the visible actions of your body to effectively use your immat erial forces. Through this, you will live in the hyperphysical, and there is the Way...” (Grillot de Givry: “The Great Work”, II) And earlier he counsels us in a precise manner: “Coordinate all your actions and all your impressions, so that you may form a perfect and harmonious whole . Make yourself acquire complete lucidity in your understanding . Turn away from that which soils you r view. Do not listen to that which pollutes your ear. Exalt in yourself the sentiment of character, to make yourself abso rb it in the bosom of the Absolute...” (Op. cit. II) Let us restate these profound thoughts more clearly. The Aspirant should first distance himself from all foreign doctrines, almost always contradictory, which have encumbered his spirit up till now. H e should know that for us, people of the West, linked to its symbols and forms of teaching and to its traditions transmissions, it is clearly necessary above all to have these symbols in us and a r ou nd us . Our five exterior senses should see the unfolding of their conditioned and manifold activities take place in a traditionally Occidental , Rosicrucian , H ermetic ambiance. For Sight , we offer only readings, engravings, and a framework (workroom, laboratory and oratory); strictly limited to these three qual ities 43 . For inner Hearing , we have texts with a profound resonance in these three modes. Words and sentences carry within them an unsuspected soul. A text which has been profoundly thought about, read and reread by hundreds of Adepts before us – such a text becomes, in a way, a series of words of power . For Smell , we create a specific atmosphere by means of frequent censings at the time of our orisons. We banish any evocative mixing with a different psychic atmosphere, or foreign doctrines, and above all those most particularly linked to the definitive practice of magic. We shall return later to the issue of censing. For Touch , we offer contact with old H ermetic books, read, reread, meditated on and preserved with love by those who preceded us on t he Way. An ancient work is always superior to a new book. All objects become charged little by little in the course of their unconscious life: psychometry has made a definitive demonstration of this.

For Taste , we reserve the art of choosing, with wisdom and good taste , the general elements of this esse ntially Occidental , Rosicrucian and Hermetic framework. And what more evocative of these three norms than the medieval ambience, this incomparable framework of the Middle Ages, from whence the Celtic traditions , and that knowledge coming out of tha t capit al of the spirit which was Alexandria in Egypt, m ix together . It is within such a framework that w e create the indispensable inner climate from w hi ch , little by little, those beliefs, readings and disparate teachings which had until then diverted our spi rit and scattered our efforts, disappear. We also take care not to use those types of prayer which are altogether too much a part of some other exoteric confession. It is within our Tradition, with its prayers which are specifically evocative of the Goa l towards which we are moving, that we should remain. Let us therefore let go of these formulae which bind us, where one speak s neither clearly nor clear cut. And let us not, through the use of common rites and customs, mix with the masses who, while tra veling towards an identical Goal, are not traveling the same road as us. The power of Egregores is such that those who , outside the church of Rome, celebrate the Mass according to its liturgy, sooner or later end up coming back . We have numero us example of people who, in entering into curious and sure psychic or spiritual currents, are eventually taken over by them and completel y rely on them : Islam, Buddhism, Bra hmanism, etc... Finally, it is not enough to clean the material dwelling in whose framework o ur efforts unfold. We must also clean the spiritual dwelling! And here, to end, we reprise the counsel of Grillot de Givry which we have already quotes, and upon which we meditate often: “Coordinate all your actions and all your impressions, so that you may form a perfect and harmonious whole. Make yourself acquire complete lucidity in your understanding. Turn away from that which soils your view. Do not listen to that which pollutes your ear. Exalt in yourself the sentiment of character, to make you rself absorb it in the bosom of the Absolute...” (Grillot de Givry: “The Great Work”, II) * * * Just the Heavens and the influx of Stars pour out their regular rays, following a well - determined cycle, upon the evolution of the Hermetic Work, so, in his “inner heaven” the Aspirant sees a succession of symbolic “seasons” unfurl. The mystical “season” of each Cardinal Virtue corresponds to a terrestrial season, an Element, a temperament, an ascetic mode, and even an aspect of the divine Terramorph, with t he corresponding Angel, according to this Table. 44 ‘ Creaux’ literally crevices = PV."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A.

We find these four mortifications as muc h in Christianity as in Buddhism and Islam, and particularly the symbolism of the Sphinx , wi th the tetra logy well - known to the Occultists: To know To will To dare To keep silent (Water) (Air) (Fire) (Earth) Which comprises the four Elements laid out ex actly like the base of the Hermetic Tetractys, in the classic order: Water – Air – Fire – Earth (see figure 1, page XX). A. Silence Silence comes in two types: 1) Silence of the tongue , consisting of the abstention of speaking other than “through God”, or “with Go d”, or with “another than God”, where these conditions are binding. By “another than God” one should read contact with the Master who looks after one in the Celestial Assembly, to which we will return later. 2) Silence of the h eart , consisting of the rejecti on of all other thoughts relative to Beings and created Things. Silence alone procures and leads to Knowledge of God . Think of God more often than you breathe...” Epictetus tells us. This is the primary way for the Aspirant. Silence equates to Earth , an d to Prudence . B. S o l itude Solitude is the means of assuring silence of the tongue. It consists of the fact: 1) Of avoiding mixing materially with others, with the profane crowd, with futile preoccupations. This is why Islam which, in its Sufi heresy, teach es the necessity of these four roads, and separates men and women in everyday life, in many respects like Christian mona stic ism . This is the first way of the Initiate."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 53 2) Of avoiding in the inner realm contact with being and things of this world, and this i s the first way of the Adept. It obeys three variables: i. Avoiding evil coming from men; ii. Avoiding evil which one might do to a neighbor; iii. Making the companionship of the Master whom one has in the Celestial Assembly permanent. Solitude alone procures Knowl edge of the World . It corresponds to Water , and to Temperance . C. Hunger and Fasting Hunger , or Fasting , consists of a reduction in nourishment, and this leads to the natural diminution of these kinds of needs. It is assured in the spirit of poverty, modes ty, mildness, calm, purity. May the Aspirant recall the extreme fasts of all the great prophets and missionaries of the Scriptures, and particularly the fast of forty days, in the terrible solitude of the Judean desert, at the end of which the Christ had an appearance of the Prince of Darkness and the trial of His threefold temptation (Matthew: Gospel, IV ), or that of the failure of the Apostles in the healing of a possessed man, and of the recourse of Christ, who explained to them that certain typesof De mons can only be chased out by fasting. Hunger alone, procures Knowledge of Satan . It equates to Air, whose Prince it is, and to Justice (Paul: “ Epistle to the Ephesians ”, II, 2). D. Vigil Vigil is the fruit of Hunger , for it expels useless sleep, often w eighed down by too abundant nourishment. Now, contact between Man and the Celestial Assembly cannot succeed except during sleep, during a kind of doubling of the Soul outside of the Body. A sleep susceptible to freeing the Soul is a sleep which comes abo ut during a serious fast. But our Vigil has another purpose. There are two types of Vigil : a) The vigil of the Heart, which instinctively seeks contemplation; b) The vigil of the Eye (vision), which realizes and objectivizes what is in the Heart (the Inner Tem ple and the Philosophical Egg), by defining it. Vigil alone procures Knowledge of the Soul . It equates to Fire and to Faith 45 . 45 Vigil is about Meditation. It is none other than a type of process of introspection about several particularly important problems for the Gnostic: the problem of Evil, study of the divine mysteries, relationships between God and Man, etc...Its elements are the basis of reason, consideration of the elements of problems and their arguments,."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A.

It constitutes discursive meditation, and must always be preceded by a Prayer which has making contact with the higher planes as its goal (see pages XXX onwards, and page XXX).

Vaughan © May 2005 56 V ELEMENTS OF THE GREAT WORK A. Philosoph ical Earth : Prudence Prudence is an element of moral action which perfects the exercise of reason in Man, so that, in e ve ry acti vity it prepar es and orders all things as i s proper , co ntrolling it (or governing everything w hose action is subordinate to, and depend ent up on it), so that everything wishes to do at every moment is for the perfect realization of e very Virtue. A s it is normally applied it is comp osed of several aspects, being: a. R ememb rance of past things, or memory; b. C lear - sight 46 in principles of acti vity , both general and specific; c. Reverence , for the things 47 which the wisest men who have preceded us have determi ned; d. Wisdom , to discover that which it would be impossible to find out quickly from another ; e. S ane exercise of reason, applied to every action; f. Caution, or the determination needed at the time for action, with respect to the substance o f this act; g. Circumspe ction, regarding all that surrounds the said act; h. Precaution , against all that c ou l d p ut an obstacle in the way , or compromise the result. Prudence , properly speaking , has the quality of a commandment: – a commandment to oneself, or individual prudence; – a commandment in the family, or familiar prudence; – a commandment in society, or regal prudence. A gift of the Holy Spirit corresponds to the Virtue of Prudence , and that is the Gift of Counsel . In this name we find a higher and transcendent inclination which perfects the exercise of reason in man. This particular inclination makes it prompt and docile to receive the Holy Spirit (without special pursuit), and all that is required for final illumination. This very inclination comes to our aid for the sam e human reason each time it is needed. For, even providing for all the virtues, acquired or in stilled from birth, human reason remains forever subject to error or surprise, in the infinite complexity of circumstances which can affect his action, either fo r itself or for another. It is often the ensemble of snares that the virtue of Prudence allows us to avoid! 46 La claire - vue. 47 La r é v é rence à l’endroit de ce qu’ont d éterminé les plus Wise qui nous ont pr é c é d é s."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 57 As a requirement to future development, this virtue i s therefore the first one to acquire, and before all the Gift of Counsel . Prudence and the Gift of Counsel is obtained through the practice of Silence , which corresponds to Phil o sophical Earth . B. Philosoph ical Water : Temperance Temperance is a virtue which in all things maintains the affective party responsive to the command of reason, so that it does is not disposed to be induced by those pleasures which more particularly interest the five external senses. It manifests itself in several ways, namely: a. Continence, consisting of choosing not to follow the violent emotions of passion; b. Clemency, consisting of moderati on or regulati on , following the virtue of Charity , as a corrective method for the ills committed by another, which the virtue of Justice demands to see more equitably corrected and expiated – things which are ineluctably necessary; c. F orbearance, consisting of dispelling the inner movement of the passion of equity, as Anger should never take hold; d. Modesty, consisting of refraining from, moderating or regulating the affective party in those things which are less difficult than preced ents ; that is to say, a desire for one’s own excellence; a desire to know what is not immediately useful to us or which is useless for our final goals; external action and movements of a carnal nature; finally to bear ourselves in a manner which leads to the v irtue of Temperance , which is the Gift of Fear . The gift of Fear consists of the act of standing before the Traditional Book of Revelation s , which present s us with a more or less exact image of God, with a holy respect, b ecause of the excellence or goodne ss of the Divine Majesty , and the fact that one does no t fear a n y thing more than exposing to becoming distance d from Him as a result o f error and fault. Moreover, it consists of the act, having regard to the excellence of the end which Traditional Revelat ions give s us, of considering all things rel ating to the pleasure of the senses, as being perfectly non - existent or dangerous. Temperance and the Gift of Fear are obtained through the practice of Solitude , which corresponds to Philosophical Water . C. Philo sophical Air: Justice Justice is a virtue which has the objective of having harmony reign in relationships between Beings, founded upon mutual respect between the Beings themselves which, to various degrees, is founded upon their own moral or physical, s piritual or material good."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 58 So its aim is to regulate our duties strictly with regard to other Beings. As such, it is distinguished from Charity , which is of a different sense and less amenable to these limiting norms. It makes peace and order reign, bo th in individual life as well as in the collective life. It applies equally well to temporal goods, as to the reputation and spiritual dignity of one’s fellow man. A Gift of the Holy Spirit corresponds to the Virtue of Justice , and this is the Gift of P iety . Piety is the habitual resolution of that will , which makes Man fit to receive the direct and personal action of the Holy Spirit, and brings him to treat with God, the First Cause, considered in the most dista nt mysteries of his divine life as a “fa ther” or a “chief”, tenderly revered, served and obeyed as if by a son. Also, to treat with all other men as with all reasonable Creatures (Angels, Spirits, Demons) in our relationships with them, so that the Good and Superior Being who more or less unite s them , and in different degrees, with the First Cause, with the father of the great divine family. The gift of Piety is assuredly that which puts the most perfect seal upon external relationships when men can have or should have, both between themselves , and with God. It crowns the virtue of Justice and all its associations. Justice and the Gift of Piety are obtained through the practice of Hunger , that is to say the Fast , which corresponds to Philosophical Air . D. Philosoph ical Fire : Strength Streng th is a virtue which had the objective of perfecting moral order in the affective party in Man. It consists of standing firm against the greatest fears, and in moderating the most imprudent audacity , so that Man, on this occasion, will never turn away fro m his duty. It manifests in several aspects, which are: a. Magnanimity, consisting of fortifying hope, regarding great and important undertakings, which one wishes to accomplish; b. Magnificence, consisting of a resolution of the affective party which strengt hens or rules the movement of hope, where it is arduous or costly to accomplish; c. Patience, which is the characteristic of enduring with stoicism, while looking to the final Reintegration, all the sadness which may come to us in the present life; more parti cularly to endure the hostile intervention of other men in their relationships with us, or those of evil spirits if the occasion presents itself; d. Perseverance, which consists of combating fear of the length of exertion to achieve the Good, or a fear of fai lure. A G ift of the Holy Spirit corresponds to the virtue of Strength , and that is the gift with the same name, also called Courage ."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 59 But since the virtue with this name in fact only deals with those obstacles and perils which are in the power of Man to overcome or suppress, the gift corresponding to the Holy Spirit addresses th os e dangers and ills which are definitely not within the power of Man alone to overcome. Thus, the Gift of Strength (or Courage ) allows him to overcome the sorrow which accompani es the separation which Death creates, with all the blessings and joys of present life, without giving by itself the sole higher blessing which compensates and does duty for hi m, as he knows that Reint egration and Life Eternal flow from the m . This effect ive substitution, both easy and welcome, of Reintegration for all the ills and sadness of terrestrial life, despite all the difficulties or all the perils which can place themselves across Mans path, as he marches towards the Supreme Goal (including Death itself, which comes to all), is the exclusive work of the Holy Spirit, through its own activity. It is by means of the gift of Strength (or Courage ) than Man is thus moved by the Holy Spirit. The essential purpose of this gift is, in fact, the victory of Man over Death and over all the terrors which it inspires. Strength and the gift of this name (or Courage ), is obtained through the practice of Vigil , which corresponds to Philosophical Fire . E. The Salt Principle: Charity Charity is a virtue which rai se us up to a life of communications, firstly with the intermediate Celestial Powers, then with the Divine Plan itself, according to its own advantage and which it deigns to communicate to us. Charity , when considered under the idea of this contact, of t his mystical communication, presupposes two things in us : a. A participation of Divine Nature which, divining our own nature itself, raises us above and despite all natural order, be it human or angelic (being therefore above the original world of manifestat ion in Creation), up to the order which is God’s own, making gods of us (evidently secondary gods), and introducing us to His intimate presence. From this comes the phrase of the Psalm: “God stands in the congregation of the mighty , He judges among the go ds...” ( Psalm 82 ), an d that from the Gospel: “I said: y ou are gods...” ( John, X, 34 ); b. Those principles of activity, proportional to this divine state, which makes us act as true secondary agents, children of God, as God acts Himself, knowing Him as He knows hi mself, loving Him as He loves, rejoicing in him as He rejoices Himself. These two mystical realizations are intimately linked to the presence, in the Soul of the Adept, of absolute Charity ."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 60 Absolute Charity flows from an act of total love, by which man wishes God the infinite gift which Faith has revealed, and he wishes for himself and all Mankind, this indissoluble gift of God. Moreover, Charity contains certain secondary aspects: 1) Mercy, which leads one to feel pity for the wretchedness of Others, in all the ontological aspects of life, and hold this wretchedness and suffering as one’s own, to be point of suffering oneself, really and intimately. 2) Beneficence, which leads one, immediately and forever, to strive to prevent evil and to promote good, in t he spiritual as in the material domain. Man, being gifted with a conscience which does not participate in its own surrender of principles, knows neither how to ignore good and evil, nor, therefore knowing both, claims to be situated “above” them both; tha t is to say, to avoid his own responsibilities. Such teachings have never served except to veil the latent amorality of those who make them their own. The Gift of the Holy Spirit corresponding to the virtue of Charity is the Gift of Wisdom , which however should not be confused with the Sublim e Virtue of that name. The gift of Wisdom (which is not THE Wisdom), brings Man, under the occult action of the Holy Spirit, to judge all things with his intelligence, in taking as the norm or as his personal rule f or judgment, the highest and most sublime of all Causes which is Divine Wisdom itself; so that it has deigned to manifest itself to us through Faith , the Philosophical Sulfur . In the initiatory life, Charity corresponds to the vow of Poverty , which is th e first postulate , that is a scorn for belongings, honors and the joys of this Inferior World. It is through this vow of Poverty that one also obtains the Gift of Wisdom . F. The Mercury Principle: Hope Hope is a virtue which sees that our will, through di vine action, coming under our control, is inclined towards Eternal Truths; those which Faith reveals to us, as those which can and should one day be our total illumination. This virtue is absolutely inaccessible without Faith , which it necessarily presup poses; for it is Faith alone which gives Hope its purpose and the means to apply it. A Gift of the Holy Spirit corresponding to the virtue of Hope is the Gift of Knowledge 48 . Knowledge , under the action of the Holy Spirit, must be able to judge with abs olute certainty and infallible truth, not through the use of the natural process of reasoning, but instinctively and in an absolutely intuitive manner, the true character of things created in their relationships with those of Hope . This is so that they mi ght be admitted and professed, or that 48 In this case the word used is ‘science’ – PV."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 61 they should serve as the ends and object of our conduct, immediately seizing that which, in the material World, is in harmony with the Eternal Truths; or, on the contrary, is opposed to them. In the initiatory life, Hope corresponds to the vow of Chastity (which, in Christian marriage, is not sexual abstinence). The vow of Chastity is the first postulate, and it is this which allows Man to free himself from the servitude of the senses, as an ordinary human couple ca n perpetuate the forms of the species in a natural and legitimate manner, without mutual decline or depravity. G. The Sulfur Principle: Faith Faith is a virtue which ensures that our understanding adheres very closely and without fear of being wrong – seei ng as he cannot see it through the normal senses – of all that comes to him through the channel of Traditional Revelation, notably by God Himself, in His desire to communicate with Man the final object of His purpose, which is in fact Reintegration, and th e existence of an Invisible World, of which our world below is but an imperfect and inverse reflection. A Gift of the Holy Spirit corresponding to Faith is the Gift of Intelligence , which should not be confused with one of the two Sublime virtues bearing th at name. The Gift of Intelligence (Which is not Understanding ) helps the virtue of Faith in leading to knowledge of divine virtue, ensuring that the spirit of Man, under the action of the Holy Spirit, penetrates the sense of those terms, which compris e the affirmations of Traditional Revelation, of all the related propositions in a way which leads to a clear understanding, or at least (in the vase of very profound mysteries) of allowing them to be approached, while preserving all their importance intac t. In the initiatory life, Faith corresponds to the vow of Submission , which is its first postulate, and allows the obtaining of the Gift of Intelligence . H. The Silver of the Wise : Understanding Understanding is the attribute which corresponds to vision , intuition, penetration and information. As such, Understanding is the knowledge (gnosis) of Absolute Divine Things , the Knowledge of Good and of Evil, but as their indistinct perception. It is this which gives us the ability to discern Spirits, the pos sibility, through types or material objects, of perceiving that which connects the opposing poles of Good and Evil, Light and Darkness 49 . 49 That is to say one shouldn’t come to this vision of divine things by means of Inferior Enti ties, themselves covered in shadow, and by the channel of the most banal magical evocation.

Vaughan © May 2005 62 It lets us penetrate the hidden meaning in words, the esotericism of texts, their higher significance, and more parti cularly the profound meaning of the Christian Scriptures, or the Holy Books if one extols another religion. According to Thomas Aquinas, disciple of Albert the Great, Understanding reveals “the higher symbolism of Perceptible Signs: rites, symbols, obje cts, sacramental materials, etc...” It lets us understand, under the appearances , or spiritual realities , and in the imperfect reflections here below, the celestial realities thus deformed or veiled: as in the carpenter of Nazareth, the Creator Logos, the n, in the Christ leaving his Apostles at the Ascension, his future Glory outside the Parousia 50 , at the End of Time. Understanding shows us the effects in the cause, for example in the blood of Christ, shed at Calvary, the purification of our Soul and our reconciliation , to use a term dear to Martinez de Pascuallis. In the pierced side of Christ, reminiscent of the hermetic pelican of the Rose - Croix, it reveals to us the invisible and unique source of the essential Sacraments. This Virtue shows us the E ternal Realities achieved through Faith on a day that, while not allowing us to understand completely, it affirms us in our certainty, no longer intuitively as Faith , but by a kind of intuitive and subconscious vision . At a higher level, it gives us a pa rtial vision of God, not revealing it completely to us, which is impossible, but by making us understand with absolute certainty, that which 50 The Second Coming – PV."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A.

Understanding reveals to us also that which Denys the Areopagite called the “divine darkness”. I. The Gold o f the Sage: Wisdom Wisdom consists of the choice of the best, among the facts accessible to Understanding . It therefore presupposes this, and it doesn’t operate integrally but through elimination. It is the spontaneous intelligent and comprehensive subm ission, to a gift which it perceives as the dominant one. As suc h it is discrimination between G ood and Evil, the Knowledge of the two opposites. If Understanding is total Knowledge , Wisdom is the use of which it is made. It i s in some way the superior aspect, being the result o f the action of Faith and Charity , of the Mercury Principle and the Salt Principle . Wisdom makes us judge all things by judging them according to the highest of Causes, f r o m which all others depend and which itself depends on n o other . It is by this virtue that the Adept can reach the highest degree of knowledge accessible to humankind here below, since this knowledge does not live in the event of general perception, nor in Intelligence as knowledge of Good and Evil , but in the event of specific perception , which is, all in all , the Knowledge of Good alone, of its complete knowledge . And here finally is Charity , which is the basis of the birth of Wisdom within us. In fact, absolute Charity , as we have seen, flows from an act of complete love, by which Man wishes for God the Infinite Good that Faith allows him to know Him, and he desires, for himself and for all other Beings, this same Good, inseparable from God . Seeing that he only seek s Good; having understood it , defined i t, he no lo nger knows how to confuse it with its opposite. I n all that the trawl - net of his understanding of th ings will bring , of his vision of all the ‘ possibilities’ i n G od , it i s the act of total love which will serve him as a touchstone.

It clothes its highest expression in Prayer, which accompanies t his necessary ensemble. “Holy men of God, so Kabbalistic tradition tells us, when they wish to travel on the Thirty - two Paths of Wisdom, begin by meditating on the sacred verses, and there prepare themselves properly by the means of holy Prayers 51 ...” (R. P. Kircher: “Œdipus Ægyptiacus”) But Prayer , like the sense of the Sacred which it expresses, is from all evidence a spiritual phenomenon. And, as Dr. Carrel judiciously notes in his study, the Spiritual World is outside the reach of our modern experiment al techniques. How, then, may one acquire a positive knowledge of Prayer? Fortunately, the scientific world understands the totality of what is observable. This domain can, through the intermediary of physiology, extend as far as the manifestations of t he Spiritual . It is therefore through systematic observation of the praying Man that we learn of what consists the phenomenon of Prayer, the technique of its production and its effects 52 . Prayer rep re sen ts Man’s effort to communicate with all incorpore al or metaphysical Entities: ancestors, guides, saints, archetypes, gods, etc, or with the First Cause, at the summit of the preceding pyramid. Far from consisting of a vain and monotonous recitation of formulae, true Prayer represents a mystical state f or man, a state in which his consciousness approaches the Absolute. This state is not of an intellectual nature: it therefore remains as much inaccessible as incomprehensible to the rationalist philosopher and the ordinary thinker. To pray, one must firs t make an effort to strain towards the Divinity. “Think of God more often than you breathe...” Epictetus told us. Very short, but very frequent mental invocations can keep man in the presence of God 53 . “True Prayer is the daughter of Love. It is the salt of knowledge; it makes it germinate in the heart of man, as if in its natural habitat. It transforms all adversities into delights; because it 51 The Thirty - two Paths of Wisdom are the thirty - two first verses of Genesis , which is the whole first Chapter, and the first verse of the Second Chapter. See R. Ambelain: The Demiurge , pp 98 to 102. 52 A. Carrel: Prayer . 53 One is reminded of the Hesychasm of the Orthodox church – PV."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 66 is the daughter of Love, because one must love to pray, and because one must be sublime and virtuous to love... “But this Prayer which is do efficacious; can it never be ours? Do we not need it to be explained to us? Let us imagine we listen attentively, and repeat it with exactitude... Who will tell us to be like a child, regarding the voice who tells us...? (L.C. d e Saint - Martin: “The Man of Desire”) We shall see later that we should understand this, from the interior voice which speaks inside us, and which join s with the Fire “introduced into the subject”, of which Limojon de Saint - Didier spoke in the epigraph qu oted at the head of this chapter. There is besides another role of Prayer, and that is its constructive role, playing in the “spiritual realms” which remain unknown or unexplored: “Or et Labor”, said the old Hermetic device, “Pray and work...” And the pop ular adage adds: “To work is to pray...”. We can conclude that that perhaps too, in the same order of things, praying equates t o work ing , that is to say, with one’s hands 54 , since Paul tells us: “Faith is the substance of things hoped for...”. All depends on what one understands by this word. Perhaps the man who prays, the prayer , constructs this glorious form in another world, this “body of light” which was spoken of by the Manicheans, and w hich is his Celestial Jerusalem; for him , his own “Celestial City”, b orn out of his “inner temple” which was its cradle, its original prototype , i n exchange for the orig inal celestial influx, through a type of two way flow : the projection of the terrestrial world in to the celestial plane. From this, one can deduce that the man who doesn’t pray doesn’t weave his own immortality; by this he deprives himself of a precious treasure. In this case, each one of us will find beyond death that which, in our carnal lives, we had hoped for. The atheist travels towards annihilatio n, and the believer towards another life. Psychologically, the sense of the divine appears to be a impulse coming out of the deepest place in our nature, a fund amental activity, and which can be seen equally among the primitive as well as the civilized. These variations are linked to various other fundamental activities: moral sense, aesthetic sense, notably personal will. The opposite is equally true. And, as A. Carrel observed, history shows us that the loss of moral and sacred sense in the majorit y of a nation’s constituent elements leads to its fall and its rapid subjection by neighboring peoples who have themselves preserved that w hich is often lost through one’s own fault. Greece and Rome are sad examples. It is besides worth noting that the s ense of the divine pushed to the level of intolerance and fanaticism lead to the same sad results. Besides, man is composed of tissues and organic liquids, penetrated by an imponderable element called “consciousness”. Now the living body, sum of tissues and organic liquids, has its own existence, linked to a regular affinity to the contingent universe. Can we not then suppose 54 Ambelain uses the word ‘ œuvrer’ – PV."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 67 that consciousness, if it resides in material organs, is similarly prolonged outside of the physical continuum? Is it forbidden to believe that we are plunged in a “spiritual universe” (and by this fact, even our consciousness having access to two different worlds), a universe which we can no more evade than our body of flesh could avoid the material universe 55 , from which it draws the elements of its preservation: oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon, and this by operation of the nutritive and respiratory functions? In t his spiritual universe , where our consciousness draws upon the same principles for its own preservation and its mo ral health, is it forbidden to see the Immanent Being, the First Cause, which normal religions call God, there? In the affirmative, Prayer can then be thought of as the agent of the n atural relations hip between our consci ousness and its particular environ ment , just as respiration and nutrition are for the physical body. From this, then, as Nietzsche thought, it is no more shameful to pray than to breathe, to meditate than to eat or drink! Prayer is the equivalent of a biological activity dependent upon o ur structure, and is a natural and normal function of our spirit. To neglect it is to atrophy our own “principle”, our soul in a word. The great psychoanalyst Jung assured us that: “Many neuroses are caused by the fact that many people wish to remain bli nd to their own religious aspirations, in consequence of an infantile passion for the light of ‘reason’...” We must be careful to make a distinction in its practice. The recitation of vague formulas, repeated over and over again with no true investment of spirit, where only the lips have any real activity, it not praying. Once again it is necessary for the “ Inner Man ”, as he was called by Louis - Claude de Saint - Martin, and his master, Martinez de Pascuallis called the “ Man of Desire ”, to be attentive and to make dynamic what the lips and brain conjointly give forth. Joined with intuition, moral sense, aesthetic sense and intelligence, the “sense of the Divine” give the human personality it full flowering. Now, it is doubtful whether success in life demands the maximum, integral development of each of our physiological, intellectual, affective and spiritual activities. The spirit is both reason and sentiment, and we should love beauty and knowledge as much as moral beauty, that of pure form equally to that of action. In this, Plato was right when he declared that to merit the name of Man, one should have “created a child, planted a tree, written a book...”. Prayer is thus the complement and essential tool of all this transmutation of Man . In this it is the Fire , and the Crucible only knows how to be the Heart , if austerity and asceticism are the elements, fuel from its initial impurities. 55 There is pr obably a better way of putting this. The French is: “univers dont nous ne pouvons guère plus nous passer que notre corps de chair ne peut le faire de l’univers materiel” – another tortuous grammatical Gordian knot from Ambelain! – PV."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A.

For if, when Melchizedek transmitted the sacrificial rite of Bread and Wine – of Corn and Vine – to Abraham, he had the powers of the Most High God, this show s that Gnosis exist ed already, and that certain people knew there was another God besides the common gods. Moreover, this initiation into a secret Rite which was new to Abraham, when he received it from Melchizedek, Abraham transmitted to all his posterity, to the whole of the future Israel. Indeed, because of this, in the heart of Solomon’s Temple, alongside the propitiatory bloody sacrifices of animals , we meet again the offering of azyme bread and wine. This has been perpetuated in the rite of Seder , w hich includes the presence of Matzoh or azyme bread; and the rite of Kiddush , the blessing of the cup of wine. When the Christ made it the basis of all Christian ritual he called himself the “Sacrificer after the Order of Melchizedek”. So his Apostles and heir Disciples r eceived an “ordination” from him dating back to a certain origin in the time of Abraham which, according to history, was around the twelfth Egyptian dynasty , nineteen centuries B.C., during the time of the Middle Empire. In fact this mysterious rite desce nded from occult elements and traditions as old as four millennia ! Such antiquity clearly removes any value to the pleasantries, in more or less good taste, which Rationalists never cease to attach to their negations regarding the value of this Rite. Le t us look at t his a little more closely. * * * There is a well - known Hermetic axiom which , in the celebrated “Emerald Tablet” attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, affirms that which is above is like unto that which is below. From this, we can assert a priori that, just as material nourishment is capable of supporting our material life if it is wholesome, or on the contrary destroying it if it is a poison; so there may exist a spiritual, psychic nourishment which supports our spiritual, psychic life or, on the contrary, if it is a spiritual poison , destroys it. 57 In French, the ‘Elixir of Long Life’ - PV. 58 Ambelain substitutes the word “sacrificateur” implying ‘sacrificer’, for reasons which become evide nt later in the chapter – PV."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 70 We suggest first that, in all ages, people have tried to establish communion (or commune - union ) with the Entities whose existence a nd presence they suspected; and that the rites associated with this communion have always worn the appearance of an assimilation through the oral, nasal, sanguine, visual ( co n temp l ation ), etc., route... often as a material assimilation with spiritual purpose : “The Nations of Canaan, offering sacrifices to the Dead up on tombs, actually communed with Evil Beings, and for this very reason, their Works were evil...” (The “Book of Jubilees”, XXII, 16 – 17) “I am the offering, the sacrifice, the clarified butter, the ritual herb, the Fire... 59 ” (Bhagavad Gita: XI, 16 - 17) N owadays, it is the Fetishist who still transcribes secret signs upon a skin, which he then washes in blessed water 60 , in which the ink signs are effaced and dissolve; and this is then drunk by the infirm or possessed person. It is also the Arab G eomancer, who pushes an earthenware stove on which boil magical resins (incense, myrrh, galbanum, etc...) intended to summon the Genies, beneath the face of the querant, so that the querant may thus be momentarily and literally possessed and controlled by them during the throwing of the “points” of the Geomantic figures. It is the ritual anthropophagy of certain Africans, that although they do not lack meat from domestically raised or hunted animals, they will eat the heart of a courageous warrior, the hand of an ad roit man, or the brain of an intelligent man. “ We gorge ourselves on th em in the manner the white man eats his good god ...!” one of them will naively explain to an indignant missionary. It is t he blood of ritual incisions, mixed and drunk by newly - weds, u n i tes them eternally in the traditions of the Roman y gypsie s 61 of Central Europe . It is the animal victims, half - consumed on the altar of holocausts, and half - consumed by the priests of Israel, who thereby unite spiritually with Yahweh their god. It is t he Shewbread, which number twelve (one for each tribe) which remains six day upon the Table of Witness, crowned with tears of frankincense, in order to be impregnated in the Tabernacle of the Covenant by the Shekinah (the “divine presence”, the pneuma ha gion ). On the seventh day, the Sabbath, the priests consume them ritualistically, together with the offering , the benediction and the imbibing of the cup of wine. 59 “I am the seven Vedic fire rituals, I am the five daily acts of sacrifice, I am the oblations offered to the departed ancestors, I am the healing herb; I am the transcendental incantation; I am clarified cow ghee; I am the f ire and I am the act of offering.” – a more accurate translation of Verse 16 – PV. 60 “ Eau incantée ” – lit. water over which incantation have been said – PV. 61 “ Tziganes ” – PV."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A.

Thus he was supposed to imbibe the breath of Osiris. It is why Israel, respite the most dreadful tortures, ever refused to burn incense before idols, and refused to eat th e meats consecrated to the “national gods”. For, as St. Paul later reminded them: “ The national gods are demons , and I don’t desire that you would have communion with demons ” 63 (Paul: I Corinthians, X, 20) In the agrarian rites of Dionysius, they partoo k of a kid, image of the solar god , a virgin goat , which in spring, the time of renewal, passes (Pâques = passage 64 ) across the horoscope or First House of the world, which is the sign of Aries , so that it might be revive d in the M y stery. The Orphic rites implied the same M ystery. Yet why was it necessary for the lamb to be replaced by its antithesis: the kid, presaging the he - goat of Azaël? ... But here again, we see an inver t ed Eucharist . It concerns itself with the bringing to life, in the Mysteries, of a dead man, a fallen god, who must resume his new life as a Man! The Christian Eucharist, as prefigured in the Jewish tradition, concerns itself with the bringin g a Man to life in the Mystic Body of God! Some have occasionally compared the resurrect ion of Hiram, in the Masonic ritual, to the resurrection of Christ. But Hiram, like Dionysius and Orpheus, lives again in t he Initiate, through him, thanks to him . There indeed is a matter for meditation. * * * This principal of communion through ma terial absorption was so well accepted that later on, in the fourteenth century, the Templars were accused of drinking the ashes of their dead Brothers mixed in wine and the blood of a black cat! Even nowadays in the land of Islam, people seek to drink o r eat the alimentary leftovers abandoned by a holy man or a wise man: tea, cake, etc. From this they clandestinely receive a baraka or blessing, which is also simultaneously a sort of slightly subverted initiation. On the other hand, this initiation is regularly transmitted by the rite of transferring of saliva from the mufti to the new sheik , sometimes by the intromission of the tongue in the mouth of the recipient 62 In the Egyptian religion, the naos was a wooden or stone shrine in which the s pirit of the deity was perpetually present – PV. 63 In this verse of the bible there is no mention of the “gods of nations”, but the point is still valid despite the rew ri ti n g o f the epistle – PV. 64 Pâques is French for ‘Easter’ – and Ambelain makes the poi nt that its root is both in Passover and Passage.

There is an initiatory display and a type of fluidic transmission at the same time. * * * Now, what does the Christian tradition tell us? That the transubstantiation of the Eucharistic species, at the time of the Liturgy (whether Eastern or Western, Orthodox or Latin) is but the transposition, in a bloody 66 and invisible manner , of the sacrifice of Melchizedek, perpetuated in Osrael from the time of Abraham, who was consecrated by Melchizedek, up to the time of Christ, son of David, and thus pontiff and king , through of the rite of Shewbread and the Cup of Kiddush. So, w hat was that Supper, if not a very orthodox Judaic ceremony , composed firstly of the annual Passover (with the partaking and mandating of a lamb and bitter herbs) , and of the Melchizedekian rite to follow, a weekly rite. The “thanksgivings” which the Evan gelists tell us were pronounced at the end of the banquet by the Christ, at the moment of the consecration of the Bread and the Cup, were ritual prayers. They still figure in the present day collection used by practicing Jews. As this rite is certainly completely unknown to ordinary Christians, we give it here by right of record, however recalling to our readers to note the remnants and echoes of the Eternal Liturgy which that night gave to the words which had been unchanged for centuries... Kiddush Or the Inauguration of the Sabbath On Friday evening, after the Office, one go es to the table, take s the Cup filled with Wine, and say s : “It was then the sixth day.

G OD blessed the seventh day and H E to sanctified it, for on that day, the L ORD rested from all the Works which H E had accomplished. “ Therefore be praised, O E TERNAL O NE , our G OD , Sovereign of the Universe, who has created the fruit of the vine...! “Be praised, O E TERNAL O NE , our G OD , Sovereign of the Universe, who has sanctified us through Your Commandments; who has taken us for Your People, and who, in Your Love, has 65 I could find no translation, but the meaning is clear enough – PV. 66 ‘en mode sanglant et invisible’.

The matzoh 67 is broken, eaten, and given to each of those present: “ Be praised, O E T ERNAL O NE our God, Sove reign of the Universe, who provides 68 the Bread and the Wine...” After the Meal, Psalm 127 ( Song of Degrees ) is recited : “When the Eternal brought the captives from Zion, we were like people who dreamed... 69 ”), then the “Graces”. We do not give them here, for they are rather long. They may be found in the collections of “ Daily Prayers ”, of the Israelites of the Ashkenazi Rite ( Tephillath Adath Yeschouroun: Editions Durlacher ). * * * But how do we conceive of the Occult meaning of t he Eucharist ? Certainly we do not eat the living, feeling, cellular flesh of Him who, at Jordan, according to the words of St. Augustine, had “reclothed himself as Man 70 ...” And we certainly don’t drink his blood, red, warm, susceptible to coagulation, as i n the religious orgies of ancient Thrace. Christ is not torn to pieces and eaten savagely by drunk and furious bacchantes. We absorb a subtle substance , occult and mysterious , linked in fact to the very essence of the Savior by a mysterious grace wished by Him, and which impregnates and transmutes the materiality of the Eucharistic species in consequence of His Promise at the Supper, and through the power which He freely and eternally conferred upon a Rite ordered of the Apostles : “Do this in memory of Me...” (Luke: Gospel, XXII,19) As sugar placed in a porcelain sugar bowl remains sugar and the sugar bowl remains porcelain, without receiving legitimate powers and the pronunciation of sacred words , the Eucharistic species remain what they were at their cr eation. But when the Divine is mixed with them, linked by His promise, by His Order made twenty centuries ago, and just as the Philosophical Stone change s lead into gold, so the Eucharistic liturgy link s the wheat and grape sugar to th e Saving Essence ab out which we have just spoken. From this fa ct, transubstantiation will then be effected, in the Invisible . 67 Lit. round loaf – PV. 68 “tirer” lit. draws – PV. 69 Ambelain appears to be confused as the Song of Degrees is not the psalm quoted here – PV. 70 ‘Avait “revêtu l’Homme”’ – P V."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 74 Then, as a transmuting sugar would, when placed in the bowl, ensure the porcelain sugar bowl would little by little become sugar in its turn, the p sychic substance and spiritual essence of Man will little by little , through a second transubstantiation, become analogous to that of God. This is the incorporation into the “Mystic Body” of Christ, at its first stage. With the Eucharist, we absorb an oc cult and mystic “change”, a philter of immortality which, if we impregnate ourselves with it sufficiently and often enough during the course of our terrestrial life, could transmute us little by little, year by year. For this “change” , assimilated by our organism like all regular nourishment, nevertheless passes from the physiological plane to the psyche, and form the psyche into the nous , or spirit. It is , in fact , because the blood carries the passions that , at Sinai, the Jews received the order onl y t o consume exsanguinated meat. A nd it is because all Creation which fell with Adam (and the Choir of Preexistent Souls which constitute it) reascend s with Christ , and Humanit y saved from the Demiurge, that Peter received in a dream ( Acts of the Apostles): X, 9 to 15 ), the order henceforth to consider all foodstuffs, wehatever they may be (animal, fish, vegetable) as having been purified forever. In his turn, Man became the transmuting athanor in which ransomed Creation must pass and be integrated in order to return to the Divine . From this comes the suppression of the interdictions against blood, meant, etc...and also of vegetarianism in all the branches of Christianity 71 . * * * Reintegration , or the reconstitution of the pleroma, consists of the slow a nd progressive working out of the P REEXISTENT C HURCH , dispersed by the Fall. Now, this C HURCH is the Mystic Body of Christ. It is represented by the Eucharistic bread. To absorb it is to build our own mystic body, represented by the “Vestment of Glory” of which the Palestinian Kabbalists and the Fathers of the C HURCH spoke. Wit hout this “Vestment”, our Fathers tell us, nothing can bridge the Fire Principle separating the Created from the Uncreated ... But a vestment must be used, for it is made to be wor n. A body needs a soul. And this is the role of the Eucharistic wine. The Bread is the “mystic body” of Christ, and the Wine is the “mystic soul”. Just as the bestial passions of consumed animals were passed along in the blood of the Israelites with t hose of impure animals, so the Soul of Christ passes through us in the Wine ... Now, in the Latin Rite, where the ordinary faithful communicate in one kind, the Host, the Eucharist of the faithful isn’t the Eucharist of the priest. It lacks one of the two elements of the Mystery. Agreed upon at a time of persecution in order to safeguard the Wine from involuntary sacrilege (slippage, broken glasses, etc), there is no longer a reason for an absence of Wine in the Latin Rite. It is yet another anomaly in th e practice of this Rite. Elsewhere, the Eastern Rite, consisting of communion in two kinds for all the faithful, is in error in our opinion, 71 Certain Protestant sects, such as the Darbists, closer to Judaism, still reject pork."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 75 in using ordinary bread in place of the azymes of the Latin Rite. Serious Occultists will understand if we declar e that we consider the Host as an infinitely superior symbol to regular, ordinary bread. The Pontifical Mass, celebrated exclusively by a Bishop, also possesses a different occult value. Occultists do not ignore the role of beeswax either, that good an d faithful register of radiation. This is why it is used in wax dagydes used by spellbinders, or the wax members utilized by spagyric doctors, as illustrated by Parac el sus. We should not ignore the evocatory role of the flame issuing from a candle (or ta per) previously lit on a tomb . All Central Europe acts upon this tradition with candles flickering on every tomb, on the night of All Saints! Martinez de Pascuallis used these candles, lit upon Divine and Angelic Names, in his theurgic Operations. T his occult knowledge is used upon the Christian altar. It is very probably this which allows us to preserve the shroud of Christ, secretly sheltered by the Disciples desirous of maintaining contact with the Master, dead in the flesh; like the majority of the other relics of the Passion. We are speaking “in principle” here, for how many relics were later fabricated by the pious and inspired forgers! Upon the Christian altar, the upright Crucifix (or Tau), evokes and manifests the presence of the Savior . Th e two wax candles, without which a Mass would be “ in vain ”, placed to the right and left of the Crucifix, evoke the presence of the Angelic World, with the two great Archangels: Mikaël and Gabriel, solar and lunar forms. These exemplars come to life beca use they are raised up on a miniature tomb , the altar stone, which necessarily contains parcels containing the bones of saints. These relics place the whole in contact with the Celestial City, just as, conversely, the skull used by the black magician, an d erected upon a cloth coming from a funerary winding sheet, flanked by two lit black candles, put the necromancer in psychic contact with the City Below. In the East, the altar stone of the Latin Rite is replaced with a linen cloth, containing identical relics in its cente r. It is called an antimension (counter - town 72 ) . The corporal of the Catholic Rite is a deformation of this. Both are folded into nine squares, and this precisely recalls the magical square of Saturn! This rite of using bones appear ed very early on in the East, and one can add the masses said in Rome on the tombs of the catacombs. This is immediately contemporaneous with the first known liturgy , that called the Jerusalem Mass or the St. James Mass. The first Christian liturgists kn ew what they were doing, from which comes our hypothesis about the carefully desired preservation of the relics of the Passion: nails, winding - sheet, crown of thorns, etc. Let us not forget that in antiquity there was a veritable traffic in these objects, sought after by all magicians and necromancers. Now, the first Christians constituted a sect apart from the 72 “ Contre - ville ”, In fact, antimension is from the Greek for ‘ instead of a table ’ – PV."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 76 Pharisees, the Sadducees, and by then the Essenes (the ir doctrines prove this). The Christian was so outside of the strict Jewish religion that J osephus, commenting upon its existence, refused to name it ! There is therefore nothing surprising in the fact that the “ taboo of the cadaver ” was not followed in the first Christian community. The use (and seeking) of relics from the Passion does not co ntradict logic. The Disciples certainly knew the Jewish tradition about the habal ha garbim or “spirit of bones”. * * * But we are still talking about the level of the Mass as celebrated by a regular priest. A Bishop must obligatorily light a third wax candle (behind the upright Crucifix in the Gnostic liturgy, thereby constituting a trigone of light with the Crucifix in the center . In this way the theurgic tradition of all evocations is respected 73 ). Nowadays, it is usually just a lit candle in a c andlestick placed outside any pentacular layout...so much for the arcana in the modern - day Church. However, the third wax candle ritualistically evokes the “presence” of the Apostle from whom the celebrating Bishop is necessarily and immutably descended. O ne knows that all filiations or apostolic “successions” must necessarily go back to one of the Twelve Apostles. The reader may rest assured that, for all of history, the great Churches have carefully kept their own successions – and those of their rivals – up to date. There are specialist books on this subject. So with this third flame, the “Communion of Saints”, that which Stanislas de Guaita called Iona , is invisibly present, with the Choir of Izchim of the Kabbalah 74 . * * * People have sometimes spread the story that Louis - Claude de Saint - Martin died having refused the Sacraments. We will ignore who could have propagated this tale, which his last immediate dis ciples, notably Gence, denied with vigor. Why would this surprise us? Louis - Claude de Saint - Martin died at Valée - au - Loups, near Aunay, at the home of his disciple and friend the Abbé de La Noue, who has been a Martinist for many years. Why would the Unknown Philosopher have refused the sacraments from such a sincere source? In his book “Tableau Naturel” he told us that priests scarcely possess any powers other than the sacraments of Penitence and the Eucharist . In this he therefore recognizes the validity of these two. From this, then, who would he not have received them on his deathbe d, from a priest such as the Abbé deLa Noue? * * * 73 The reader will remember that a triangle of evocation is always drawn at any operations intending to manifest a spirit – PV. 74 See R. Ambelain: “Practical Kabbalah”, edited by Niclaus."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 77 Regarding the reality of the Eucharistic mystery, we will also note the following fact. In former times, some Occultists , more black than white, were curious enough to go to specific Masses, on the great days of Christmas or Easter, in one of the large Parisian metropolitan churches. At the moment of Elevation, when the celebrant elevated the Host, then the Cup, they would go to the axis of the nave, at the far end, by the doors. At that precise in stant they would expose a crystal ball, that classic instrument of clairvoyance and a powerful psychic condenser, which had previously been immersed in clear running water, to empty it of all previously accumulated radiation. Immediately afterwards they w ould cover it again in a square of black silk, a good isolator. Upon retuning home, they submitted the crystal ball to the psychic 75 examination of proven seers or seeresses. Every time these seers saw the crystal ball glow red like a ruby . Every time the phenomenon faded little by little, and disappeared totally at the end of around ten to twelve hours. The seers never saw ordinary balls (presented to them as proof), which had not been exposed to the Holy Species, presenting this strange phenomenon. Who could still believe in front of such facts that the Christian Eucharist is just a memorial? For the early doctors of the Reformation, the “ real presence ” was a certain fact. Then, with “free examination 76 ” helping, the ignorant masses took the direct ion of the church into their own hands, weighing their majority against the reforming synods, and over time Protestantism lost the formidable secret which God had confided to Man. And it is here we find the true Philosophical Stone of Spiritual Alchemy : t he Eucharist, in which Water , image of the Mercury of the Wise and of the C HURCH , is united in the Chalice, image of the crucible, with Wine , symbol of Sulfur of the Wise and C HRIST . Moreover, and from this union of the P HILOSOPHICAL S UN (the Wine) and the P HILOSOPHICAL M OON (the Water), o f these newlyweds called the “ Red Bridegroom ” and the “ White Bride ” , according to the treatise by Ripley, joins together as the P HILOSOPHICAL E ARTH (the Corn), symbol of the Salt of the Salt of the Wise 77 . It is the fu sion of these three terms which then constitutes the Spiritual Chrysopage , by which Man is identified with G OD , as Lead becomes Gold in the heart of the Matras... Then, in the astral, this ruby red color, which is that of the Red Stone, the Perfect Stone, shines in the crystal ball amenable to Clairvoyants. * * * 75 The word used is “métagnomique” – PV/. 76 “libre - examen” may have a specific meaning I am unaware of – PV. 77 In his work “The Serpent of Genesi s”, Stanlislas de Guaita denies that the elixir of life has ever existed from a material point of view. This is clearly a statement which is self - evident! Moreover, what use would it serve? To fix , once and for all, that which makes use of it into a def initive state, destroys in advance any possibility of evolution ! This would be to forever enclose the Being in a prison from which there was no hope of getting out, having as jail companions memories , often sorrowful, and moral imperfections , horribly emb arrassing."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 78 To end on this subject, we will give an extract from an apocryphal Gnostic writing entitled the Apocalypse of Adam . This work goes back to the first century. We read that according to the an onymous author, it was on the tomb of Adam that Melchizedek and Shem celebrated the first sacrifice of Bread of Wine. Here there is a foreshadowing of the antimension and present day relics. “Then Adam, being close to bodily death, had Seth, his son, En och, the son of Seth, Caïnam, son of Enoch, and Malalahel, the sone of Caïnam, come to him, and he left them his testament, saying: “Here is the vow which all you sons and the sons of your sons must observe. When I am dead, you shall embalm my body with Myrrh, Frankincense and Cinnamon, and you will place it in a hidden Cavern. And he among my children who later finds himself alive when he must leave the neighborhood of Eden shall take with him my skin, and he shall place it in the central point of the Earth , for it is from this Mysterious Place that, in the future, when the Time has come, will come my salvation and the salvation of all my Posterity. “And the Sons of Adam did as he had laid out to them. And one day the Angel of the Eternal One descen ded near to Shem and Melchizedek, and appeared to them, having first fortified their hearts. He then said to Melchizedek: ‘Take the Bread and Wine that Shem has in his hands...’ and Melchizedek took these things, as the Angel had told him to do. And they r emained by the Tomb of Adam until evening. And when night was come, there came a great brightness above the Body of our Common Father. And they sang, filled with joy. And when the sun appeared at dawn, the Voice of the Eternal One came to Melchizedek, a nd he heard Him say this: “Rise up, Melchizedek, and take twelve stones, and with them raise up and altar to Me. You will put the Bread and Wine, which Shem gave to you, upon it, then you will communicate together, you and him.” Melchizedek hastened to do this. And he prayed to God to accept the offerings. Then the Spirit of God descended on the hosts of the sacrifice, and the mountain shone with a holy light. “Then the Angels said each to the other: “Praise to Him, who has created these Creatures w hich are named Men, and to whom have also been revealed profound Mysteries...” “It is thus that the Word of God appeared to Melchizedek and said to him: Here I have made you a Priest. Shem and you have communed in th e First Sacrifice that you offered. An d as you employed twelve stones to erect this altar, so, when the Time will finally come, I shall take twelve Apostles to be the solid columns of the Earth. And as you offered Bread and Wine, so shall I offer My Flesh and My Blood. And I shall make of th is place a holy place, where you have offered the first sacrifice, the same where is buried the Body of your Father: Adam... And I shall grant great blessings to those who shall come here...” (Apocalypse of Adam, apocryphal G nostic text) The reader will observe the very beautiful esotericism of this passage. According to the legend, Adam was buried where later Christ was put to death, and this butte, at the border of the"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 79 walls of Jerusalem, were then called Golgotha , that is to say, “skull” in Hebrew, gi ven its silhouette... From this comes the very symbolic image of a cross erected upon a human skull, from which, perhaps, a serpent escapes from the orbits. And those who know how to draw on a planisphere certain geodesics passing through Jerusalem, clai m surprise at finding strange coincidences 78 ... * * * To those who manifest any doubt about the imprescribable character of the Eucharistic rite for the Christian, we content ourselves with reclling the very words of Christ: “ If you do not eat the body of the Son of Man, and if you do not drink his blood, you will have no L ife with in you. He who eats My body and who drinks My blood, has Life Eternal. And I will raise them on the last day... for My body is tru e nourishment, and My blood is true refreshme nt... He who eats my Body and who drinks my Blood lives in Me and I in him... As My Father who has sent Me lives , and as I live in My Father, likewise he who eats me shall also live through Me! He who eats this bread shall live forever !...” (John: Gospel, VI, 54 to 59 79 ) “Do this in memory of Me...” (Luke: Gospel, XXII, 19) What can we say, other than that Christ perhaps reiterates the test of the Garden of Eden. By refused to bend ourselves to the mysterious rite of the Eucharist, which our feeble human inte lligence can hardly understand and follow in the vertiginous developments it implies, we will, without doubt, reiterate the fatal and prideful error of primitive Adam - Eve . To the complete defense of arriving at a Knowledge of Good and Evil, through a spi ritual manducation which was fatal to Original Man, we associate ourselves with a refusal to conform to the Knowledge of Salvation by an analogous manducation. Even better, we make it worse by reiterating it in the opposite manner 80 ! Just as the wood of the symbolic Tree is for us the symbol of our spiritual death, so the wood of the symbolic Tree became the ignominious waistcoat of the Cross (into which it was 78 One for those who like drawing ley lines: the only use I know for ‘geodesic’ is in domes, constructed as alternative habitats! – PV. 79 This bears only the loosest of connections with the verses Ambelain quotes – PV. 80 This obscure passage see ms to revolve around a double negative. Ambelain seems to be saying that just as original sin came from chewing (manducation) an apple, so we now conform to salvation by chewing the Host. However, this is a little hard to follow, since Gnostic thought, w hich Ambelain follow ed , often posited the idea that Adam was imprisoned in Eden by the Demiurge and escaped the ‘prison’ of Eden by being inspired (rather than tempted) by the true and ever - living God to eat of the Tree, by which Adam - Eve regained the know ledge which had been denied them during their sojourn in Eden . In this interpretation the serpent was Heli, or the Christ, bringing Gnosis to man.

Vaughan © May 2005 81 VI II UNIVERSAL REINTEGRATION “ Nothing can re st in itself, unless it rejoins with to that from which it came... “ Jacob Boehme, “Mysterium Magnum” , Final Summary We know that the reintegration of the entire Cosmos , and all spiritual or material creatures, is the ultimate goal of true alchemy. Accord ing to authentic Rosicrucian tradition, in fact, the entire Universe was degraded with Man its original guardian. In Genesis there is a phrase to which very little attention is paid in the ordinary Christian milieu. This is it: “ Henceforth the earth wil l only produce thorns and brambles, the Earth shall be cursed because of you...” ( Genesis : II, 17 – 18) This phrase incontestably evokes the hyle of the gnostics, which was designated the first matter of the Inferior World, and of the Universe. In ancient Greek and word for word, hyle was used to designate wood, copse, jungle, unreclaimed land. This term was set against biblical Eden , a word signifying garden, and by extension, the orient, light. Primitively Adam was in Eden ; then after his moral fall, ha ving desired to know Good and Evil, Eden had become Hyle. Just as he had worn a garment of leaves (his integration into the vegetable plane), then one of the sins of beasts (his integration into the animal plane) ( Genesis: II, 7 and II, 21 ), so did Ede n c rystallize and fall into shadow. The garden of light, placed in a superior “plane”, was succeeded by a material, shadowy Universe, in which all elements became weighty and materialized. At this point let us listen to Louis - Claude de Saint - Martin: “Man, the evil is yet greater. Say not that the Universe is on its bed of sorrows , say: the Universe is on its deathbed . It is your duty to perform the funeral rites; it is up to you to reconcile it with this Pure Source from which it descends, this Source whi ch is not God, but one of the eternal organs of His Power, from which the Universe has never been separated. I tell you, it is up to you to reconcile it with this Source by purging it of all the substances of falsehood with which it has never ceased to im pregnate itself since the Fall , and to wash away all the days it spend in vanities...” (L. - C. de Saint - Martin: “ Ministry of Man - Spirit ”) “Learn here an immense and terrible secret. Heart of Man, you are the sole source from whence the River of Lies and Dea th is daily introduced upon the Earth ... Heart of Man, how"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 82 many centuries will it take to root out this strange leaven 82 which infects you?

Let us weep, so that Evil finds all the streams barred, and may it be subdued to wander blindly in the dense night of its tenebrous Cav erns...” (L. - C. de Saint - Martin: “ Man of Desire ”) The mysterious Masters who firstly set up Martinez de Pasc uallis, confided to him the keys of universal regeneration, as we saw earlier. Later, they sent forth L. - C. de Satin - Martin, his closest disciple, and confided to him the keys of individual regeneration. But it is clear that it is useless to attack the problem of the reintegration of the Universe and its constituents, if one hasn’t steered a similar, parallel activity in ourselves! However, we have already seen that all is harmonious in this ensemble. Then we reunite once more with the venerable knowledge which ad guided us in the preceding pages, and which is limited to regeneration in the world of metals . In this matrass 84 , which is a miniature Universe, Alchemy reproduces the activity of the Universal Artisan, wi th the bringing together of disorganized and corrupt elements of the Kenome, harmonizing them and amalgamating them in order to lead them toward s their ultimate perfection. Thus , by thi s experimental lesson , through this Operation of extended commitment 85 which constitutes the chariot 86 of the Great Work , this Art leads its disciple to a position to be at first surprised, then to follow, and then reproduce all the mysterious processes by w hich the Divine Animator 87 leads his “Game of Love”. And so it is the philosophical sovereign par excellence, since it is the sole philosophy that teaches Man these experimental and probatory rudiments which will lead him towards absolute certainty. It is also this science, this true master who this gives him firstly a gnosis , then a faith . * * * The techniques of the Elus Cohen of Martinez de Pasc uallis comprise three distinct elements: a) Exorcisms , intended to strangle the demonic action at the heart of the Cosmos, to impede their action on men, to break their power over the Operator and his disciples, to obtain the cessation or limitation of certain plagues, and to annihilate the Operations of Black Magic; b) Conjurations , intended to establish contact with the Angelic World and with the Communion of Saints; from among the latter the Operator selects particular “patrons”, 82 Or ‘germ’ – PV. 83 It is the Prince of Darkness, Satan, who must be strangled by Adam. 84 Alembic, boiler – PV. 85 Literally ‘extended breath’ (de longue haleine) – PV. 86 ‘ Aurigière’ – suggests both the coachman of a chariot (aurige) and gold (Au) – PV. 87 The Creator Logos , who must not be confused with the Demiurge , of Prince of this World."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 83 and in the Angelic World Guardians and Guides. As the successive Ordinations progress, little by little the Cohen makes contact with higher and higher Hierarchies. The first are the disembodied ones 88 , to use an example used by Don Martinez himself, intended to allow a ccess to more and more elevated Beings. c) Prayers , addressed to God and the three Persons of the Holy Trinity, intended to obtain His Grace and Mercy, with a view to Reintegration. Prayers are integrated into the preceding rituals of conjuration, and are intended to channel and to amplify them. The whole constitutes what Martinez de Pascuallis calls the “cult” 89 , and is th us a liturgy . The totality of this “cult” includes ten types of Operation: 1 st ) Ritual of Expiation – Man manifests his repentance, as much for his own faults as for the Fall of the initial Prototype, the First Adam, chorus leader 90 of the choir of Preex istent Souls . From this proceeds a asceticism and penitential ritual. (Sephirah: Malkuth ). 91 2 nd ) Ritual of Special General Forgiveness – Operations consisting of substituting himself for all terrestrial humanity, in order to have them participate in the fruits of his individual O peration (Sephirah: Yesod ). 3 rd ) Operational Ritual against Demons – The authors of the initial degradation at the beginning of Time, they continue to maintain and aggravate their bondage of all humanity. Through Exorcisms (th e famous Equinox Operations), the Cohen combats them and repels them from the terrestrial aura. (Sephirah: Hod ). 4 th ) Ritual of Prevarication and Conservation – Following on from the preceding Cult, this Operation consists of combating and chastising vot aries of black magic and sorcery, and above all to chastise those fallen spirits which are their collaborators. Sephirah: Netzach ). 5 th ) Ritual against War – Homicide being the greatest of crimes, collective homicide is evidently the gravest of all. The Cohen battles against the Forces of Hate between Nations and tries to divert their activities. Where this is impossible, he lends the aid of his theurgy to the unjustly attacked party , or to those who indiscutably represent the morally superior right, be yond any political or material interest. (Sephirah: Tiphereth ). 6 th ) Ritual of Op position against the Enemies of Divine Law – A theurgic Operation having as its objective a battle against human activities tending to spread atheism, satanism and luciferi sm under their equally human forms (books, revues, propaganda, sects, etc). (Sephirah: Geburah ). 88 The word used is ‘ apeaux’ so this is a guess. Peau is skin – PV. 89 ‘ Culte’ is a complex word in French , and does not necessarily have the negative connotations of the English word ‘cult’. It means religion, devotion, ritual veneration, enthusiastic admiration, worship - PV. 90 Choragus , an archaic word for the chorus leader in ancient Greek plays – PV. 91 Se e R. Ambelain: “ Martinism ”, and “ Practical Kabbalah ”, Niclaus edition, Paris."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 84 7 th ) Ritual to obtain the descent of the D ivine Spirit – Operation with the objective of bringing about the infusion of the Holy Spirit and its gifts. This is more specifically the “Inner Path”, the Spiritual Alchemy studied in these pages, (Sephirah: Chesed ). 8 th ) Ritual to strengthen Faith and Perseverance in divine Spiritual Virtue – Operation with the objective of understanding the Divine Mysteries, thi s comprehension permitting the Emulator to affirm his faith in an absolute and definitive manner. (Sephirah: Binah ). 9 th ) Ritual for the fixi n g of the divine Conciliating Spirit within oneself – This is the total reception of the Holy Spirit, the descen t of the “tongues of fire of Pentecost”, final illumination, with the privileges that it brings. One might apply the words of the Roman Catholic Sacramentary at the consecration of a bishop: “O Lord, give him the ability to be an author of Reconciliation, in words and deeds, through the power of Signs and Prodig ies...” (Sephirah: Chokmah ). 10 th ) Ritual of the Annual Dedication of all Operations to the Creator – This section comprises the totality of consecrations, benedictions, etc, through which the Operat or hopes to sanctify the whole of human actions capable of existing. By virtue of the very principle of Universal Reintegration, all actions must be inserted into a framework having precisely this as its goal. From this arises the blessing of fruits of th e earth, harvests, domestic animals, religious or initiatory rites, constitution of sacramentals, etc... From this succinct exposé one can see that the Operations of Martinezism (to employ the neologism created by Papus) are parallel to religious ceremonie s since they have th e same purposes. Besides, the latter contain Rites which, sadly, are rarely used, due to the fault of civil powers or the negligence of religious authorities: blessing of works of art (dams, bridges, monuments), exorcisms against earth quakes, damage by water, inundation, drought, etc 92 ... It is the application of word of the apostle Paul: “Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, for kings and all who are in a uthority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life...” (Paul: 1 st Timothy, II, 1 - 2 ) And the Old Alliance had already said: “Seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray to the Lord for it, for in its peace you will have peace...” (Jeremiah: XXIX, 7 ) 92 The fact that civil authorities, linked to state neutrality, never call upon religious authorities in such circumstances, does not relieve them of responsibility for this. Whe n the mother of the keeper of the dam at Malpasset was thrown into the artificial lake created by the dam a nd cursed it , it was the responsibility of the aforementioned religious authorities to neutralize this malediction with the appropriate rites. But w ere these authorities in a position to understand that the soul of a suicide, thrown into a vortex of hate and adding at the ultimate moment the power of their spoken word, ipso facto becomes a demon ?... On the second anniversary of the bursting of the dam was followed by a second catastrophe!"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A.

Vaughan © May 2005 87 IX THE TECHNIQUE OF PRAYER “Ask, and you will receive... Knock, and it will be opened unto you...“ Luke , Gospel, XI, 9 . Precision in prayer, with the aim of laboring on the interior Great Work, is a very i mportant subject. In this all Q uietist 94 dogma constitutes a blind alley. The “Inner Path” of the Unknown P hilosopher only bears an exter nal Q uietist approach in its general appearance , in its ge neral exposition. It is absolutely not Quietist in its practical applications. We must therefore pray to obtain, to obtain something specific , as the Evangelist says: (Luke: Gospel, XI, 10 - 13) You will observe that this technique is preliminary and con comitant to all operative Martinism . The study of ancient documents of early Martinism shows that Don Martinez de Pascuallis imposed this in a permanent manner upon his followers who had entered into the theurgic path. We therefore here give texts comin g from the true lineage, either from early Martinism (Martinezism) or from illuminated Orders of the same spiritual orientation of the 18 th Century. We also add classical texts, used by the same people, and borrowed from prayers from the Latin Church, suc h as the penitential Psalms and the Office of the Holy Spirit. And if by chance some rationalist reads this and seems to be shocked that prayers are integrated into a text claiming to be initiatory, we leave the final word to the great psychoanalyst Jung : “Many neuroses are caused by the fact that many people wish to remain blind to their own personal religious aspirations, the consequence of an infantile passion for the light of reason!...” * * * 94 Quietism : a heretical form of religious mysticism founded by Miguel de Molinos, a 17th - century Spanish priest. Molinism, or quietism, developed within the Roman Catholic Church in Spain and spread especially to France, where its most influential exponent was Madame Guyon . She preached her doctrines to members of the French aristocracy, winning a convert and friend in Madame de Maintenon, Louis XIV's wife, and an ally in Archbishop Fénelon . The essence of quietism is that perfection lies in the complete passivity of the soul before God and the absorption of the individual in the divine love to the point of annihilation not only of will but of all effort or desire for effort. Molinos talked about an entire cessation of self - consciousness, and Madame Guyon maintained that she could not sin, for sin was self, and she had rid herself of self. Molinos and his doctrines were condemned by Pope Innocent XI in 1687 (from Encyclopedia.com – PV."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A. Vaughan © May 2005 88 How should we pray? The response is easy: as peo ple prayed at those times that Man was still in close communion with the Divine Plane, such as the times of the primitive Church, or Judaism which preceded it, from which they borrowed many things, having regard to their high esoteric value, attested to by the great leaders of Israel. In the “ A cts of Hipparchus and Philotheus ” we read this: “There was in the house of Hipparchus a room looked maintained with care. He had had a cross painted on the Eastern wall of this room. There, in front of the symbo l of Christ, with the face turned towards the East, he prayed seven times a day...” (Cf. Assemani: Act. Mart ., II, p. 125, 1748) All the Fathers of the Church, and assuredly the greatest of all, Origen, shows us Christians praying on their knees or standing , facing the East and in front of the imag e of the Cross. Here is the exp lanati on of this double attitude, analogous to the “postures” ( asanas ) of certain types of Yoga: “ While the positions of the body are innumerable, it is that where we stretch out our hands and raise our eyes toward Heaven which should be preferred over all others, to express with the body an image of the disposition of the soul during prayer. Yet it is necessary, so to speak, to extend the soul with our hands, and raise the spirit t owards God with our eyes. And before so doing, to disengage the spirit from the earth, and stand before the God of the Universe. Finally, we should set aside all resentment of offenses which we believe we have received, if we wish God to pardon us equall y for those bad things we have done...” (Origen: “De Oratione”, XXXI) We can see this attitude in ancient Pythagorean or Christian frescos, which show the “prayers” with hands extended before them, open and cupped, and eyes raised towards Heaven. Praying on one’s knees always imposes a requirement that the person praying humiliates himself before God because of his faults. Some early authors even mention prostration. So, in the “ Secret Instructions of the Réaux +Croix ”, Don Martinez de Pascuallis s hows us that the Cohens of the High G rades of the Order prostrated during certain penitential orisons. In this case, the prayer rests his forehead on his crossed wrists with his hands in fists. This “posture” (very occult) recall the skulls of Black Magic pos ed upon the crossed tibias! But here, this symbol off death and perdition is replaced in the Cohen ritual by a living skull and living hands, so becoming a symbol of life and salvation. As for praying on one’s knees, this correlates to the position of t he forearms crossed upon the breast, hands flat, fingers together, placed at the level of the shoulders. This is the Rosicrucian gesture par excellence , known as the “Good Shepherd”. If, on the other hand, one joins the hands together, they should be fla t together, one against the other, fingers stretched out, their tops at the level of the breath passing through the mouth."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Spiritual Alchemy – Translated Piers A.

Finally, readers anxious to operate in the most possible occult manner will dress in a white linen alb, with a cordelier and sandals, for their spiritual activities. These effects should evidently be used for spi ritual work and nothing else. The alb is n ei t her a nightgown nor a dressing gown ... A) The Time of the Work Just as ancient Israel historically left Egypt (symbol of the World of Matter) at Easter, that is to say at the new moon in the sign of Aries, so begi ns the Work at this annual moment when the crescent moon is visible, and the first Sunday which follows this phenomenon. Each novena is separated from its successor by a free day, with no specific activity, in order to break the rhythm and split up the se novenas. These therefore equate with the real passage of time in a decan of ancient Astrology. The annual course of the sun spreads across a Zodiac of 360 degrees, which comprises 36 decans, or 36 novenas. Each of the four seasons are therefore com posed of nine, making 36 in total. So, during the nine decans of Spring (the months of Aries, Taurus and Gemini), one may work spiritually in a regular fashion of the nine Virtues: four Cardinal, three Theological, two Sublime . During the months of Sum mer (months of Cancer, Leo and Virgo) similarly. During the seasons of Autumn and winter one may work the same way. One may also dedicate an entire year to the obtaining of the four Cardinal virtues, and in this instance they will each comprise nine nov enas in total during the year. The following year, one will work to develop the Theological virtues, which number three. Each of them will be in this case dynamized for twelve novenas. Finally, in the following year, one works on the two Sublime virtu es, and each of them this year will be activated eighteen times. We attach a particular importance to the period which, each year, runs from November 28 th till December 3 rd . We counsel the reader to closely read pages 35 to 49 of “The Golden Dragon 95 ” (“ Rites and Occult Aspects in the search for Treasure”).

Divided tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue rested o n each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability. Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in Jerusalem. And at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each. Amazed and astonished, they asked, “ Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? And how is it that we hear, each of us, in our own native language? Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs – in our own languages we hear them speaking about God's deeds of power ” 108 ...Lord, send Thy Spirit, and all shall be created, and Thy shalt renew the face of the Earth...

The traditional French word for “the word” in St. John is “le verbe”. Here he uses “la parole”. This causes two problems. Firstly, “parole” is a different sense of ‘word’ than ‘verbe’, which is more active. Secondly, because ‘parole’ is feminine and not masculine, by emphasizing the female definite article he makes the early verse of St. John read as though the Word created the world and not God. For example, “Toute choses ont été fait par Elle...” directly translates as “all things were made by Her ” meaning “ la Parole ” . He is obviously making a point. To be safe I have simply used the usual first verses of the KJV.

Certainly, it is not for them that this was written with detail and precision. We will limit ourselves to recalling this text by Willermoz, which figures in his very rare collection: “ Our T houghts and those of Others ” (Lyon, 1788), and which is an extract from the archives of the II nd Province of Auvergne and its Metropolitan College, a text written for the Profès of the Order of the Cité Sainte : “Initiate, human science will be useless to you when it is your time to die! But how difficult this passage becomes to he who has not been instructed by Faith ! Then you will be no happier or unhappier for having known or ignored the infinity of questions debated in schools, and which occupy the w ell - read... Neither those who know how to resolve them nor those who know not, for all that, will be the more advance d! It will serve them nothing to have been a philosopher or a mathematician. But Faith which produces Charity and Good Works, this gift of the Spirit, which human i ndustry and study has never known how to procure ; Faith is the only true knowledge, and the unique path to Regeneration and Salvation ...” Doctor Alexis Carrel, in his little pamphlet entitled “ Prayer ”, rich in observations made in this domain by this erudite author of “l’Homme, cet Inconnu 114 ”, tells us that: “Prayer, it seems, raises men above the mental stature which is theirs through heredity and education. This contact with God impregnates them with peace; and peace radiates f rom them. They carry peace wherever they go. Sadly, there are presently in the world only a tiny number of individuals who know how to pray in a effective manner...” Let us wish that these pages provide a contribution towards an efficient return to Pra yer, and towards its superior and eternal objectives. Then, perhaps, some among us will realize that hope for which our venerated masters, Don Martinez de Pascualis, Louis - Claude de Saint - Martin and Jean - Baptiste Willermoz, fought throughout their lives, and which Robert Fludd defined so well in a lapidary manner: “Then, when the temple shall have been consecrated, its dead stones again becoming alive, the impure metal shall be transmuted into fine gold, and Man shall re c o v er his primitive estate ...” * * * 114 “Man, this Unknown” – PV."}]
