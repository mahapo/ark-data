two most difficult questions of all,“Who are we?” and “Why are we here?” Despite today’s advances in science andtechnology, these two questions have remained unanswered. Focused as it is onthe physical, modern science can show us how we got here and it can show us ofwhat this world is made, but it cannot satisfactorily answer these fundamentalmetaphysical questions about the meaning of life.As a result of this gap in our knowledge, human beings appear to be caught in adelusion, unaware of their vast potential. So where do we go to find answers tolife’s ultimate questions? Many have sought insight in the texts and teachingsof the world’s sacred traditions, only to find that many of these ancienttraditions are either partially or wholly lost or nearly incomprehensible. Theseonce vital and significant traditions have left behind fragments of knowledgethat, at least, seem to point to the solutions, but these answers are oftenvague, difficult for modern minds to grasp, or else shrouded by the veils oftime and cultural changes. Our own Western esoteric alchemical tradition, onceguided by a deep and profound understanding of the intimate relationship amonghuman beings, nature, and the cosmos, has been on its last legs for centuries.Because of the vast changes in culture, language, and perception that have takenplace since the Industrial Revolution, any serious study of the past is mademuch more difficult. The Industrial Revolution caused a serious disruption inWestern culture that cannot be overemphasized. The rise of the machine andmechanism changed the way we think, the way we see the past, and the way we viewour ancestors. No longer are our ancestors valued for their wisdom or knowledge.As the mechanized Age of Iron enveloped Western civilization, we almost lost ourspiritual heritage as well.From the time of the Inquisition onward, many of our most sacred teachings wererooted out and expunged from the dominant view, creating the continuing dramathat we call European history. “Europe’s inner demons” is how historian NormanCohn characterized the spiritual and historical nightmare that has hauntedEurope for centuries. The result of the conflict, madness, and destruction thathave marked modern European history was the almost complete loss of themythologies, wisdom, and profound knowledge that sustained the West through theMiddle Ages. This loss was the problem that Fulcanelli attempted to correct whenhe wrote his masterpiece Le Mystère des cathédrales, or Mystery of theCathedrals, in 1926. By the beginning of the twentieth century, the secret ofalchemy had become lost in the well of time. Replaced by rampant speculation,obscure texts, and many failed attempts to turn lead into gold, the once deeplyspiritual science of alchemy was headed for the dustbin of history. With onebook by Fulcanelli all of that would change. The twentieth century’s entireintellectual and artistic interest in alchemy was reawakened and energized bythe appearance of Le Mystère. In writing it, Fulcanelli sought nothing less thanto resacralize, relegitimize, and reinvigorate the entire Western esoterictradition. He promised that through an in-depth study of its pages, any sincereand conscientious student would begin to comprehend what is referred to in thelore as “the secret language of the birds,” the subtle language of spirit that“teaches the mystery of things and unveils the most hidden truths.” From thisunderstanding, a profound inner awakening would begin to take place.Through a careful and exquisite unveiling, Fulcanelli, himself an adept of thisWestern lineage of transmission, provides readers with the keys to unlock thedoors to the sacred mysteries that lie at the root of the alchemical arts. Thesemysteries include not only the “science of light and time” but also the pathtoward communication with living matter itself and with the Divine Intelligencepresiding over our galaxy.In addition to its profound restatement of the Western esoteric tradition, whichis significant enough, perhaps the single most important aspect of Le Mystèrewas the single chapter added to the 1957 edition of the book. This chapter,called “The Cyclic Cross of Hendaye,” discusses a simple yet mysterious monumentlocated in southwestern France that Fulcanelli dates to the middle of theseventeenth century. The monument’s few inelegant symbols reveal that not onlywas it built by a “master mason,” but that its creator possessed a surprisingamount of arcane knowledge. It also proved, and Fulcanelli echoes this, thatthere was, and possibly still is, a group of people, a secret society, if youwill, that knows the very secret of time and light, which secret is the basis ofall true alchemy. More surprising, Fulcanelli tells us that this secret societywas still active as few as three hundred and fifty years ago.The message of the cross at Hendaye is that time is not a mystery, that thesecret of time itself could be understood. Like a river, time has many bends andturns, many tributaries and creeks, but it is possible that time, like a river,can be mapped. And when the map of time is properly understood, the mystery ofthe future disappears. In addition to this remarkable revelation, the symbolsand teachings encoded in the cross at Hendaye offer us a new understanding ofthe cosmos, especially with regard to the center of the Milky Way Galaxy and itseffect on us.Finally, the cross at Hendaye reveals that its maker understood the greatalchemical experiment that occurs at the end of time. The secret alchemicalMercury that rules the primordial essence of life itself is enlivened andinvigorated during the time span indicated by the cross. Practical alchemistswould know, just by examining the symbols on the cross at Hendaye, when toperform their most secret experiments. As Fulcanelli intimates, this secretexperiment is nothing less than the creation of a Golden Age.History appears to be a long initiation into the mysteries of the universe. Aswith any initiation, attention to ethical standards, clear communication, andright action are the necessary ingredients for the initiation to take place.When the initiation is over, we shall know who we are and why we are here.The great return of the alchemical tradition is the road back to a science basedon timeless spiritual principles. Alchemy is the science of human development,the art of turning glass into light and lead into gold. But as any true adeptwill tell you, these are merely metaphors for deep and secret mysteries of thespirit. As we in the West reestablish contact with the primordial source of lifeand wisdom, we shall shed the veils that conceal the profound nature ofourselves and this planet. With the return of this grand and glorious traditionwe shall once again understand who we are and why we are here. The main rule ofalchemy, that “only like can become like,” will be recognized for what it trulymeans. As the atoms that make up the flesh and bones of our bodies were oncethriving inside the hearts of stars now dead, so will our consciousness one dayoccupy future stars. Human beings are the stuff of stars endowed withconsciousness. We are the seeds of the cosmos. It is our true heritage to takeour place in the order of the universe. That is the real promise of alchemy,Fulcanelli, and the Cyclic Cross at Hendaye.JAY WEIDNER"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONTHE POLITICS OF SECRECY: FULCANELLI AND THE SECRET OF THE END OF TIMEimage [images/image11-00.jpg]For me, it all started a few years ago when JayWeidner asked me what I thought of Fulcanelli. Being full of my own opinions andsure of their validity, I gave him the quick rundown on what I knew: “Mysterioustwentieth-century alchemist featured in Morning of the Magicians and thereforesomewhat suspect. Colin Wilson suggests that he is another alchemical con mansuch as Cagliostro or St. Germain.”Jay laughed and suggested that I read Mystery of the Cathedrals, Fulcanelli’sfirst book, and The Fulcanelli Phenomenon, by Kenneth R. Johnson. When I did, Irealized that the books described one of the most fascinating puzzles of alltime. Alchemy was certainly a key part of the mystery. At the heart of thispuzzle, however, lay something even stranger—ancient knowledge of the locationof the center of our galaxy and from that knowledge a way to estimate the dateof a celestial event of eschatalogical magnitude. The sophisticated astronomicalculture of the Maya considered this event to be the end and beginning point oftime itself. After the fall of the ancient cultures in the Old World, simpleknowledge of the event became the secret possession of the initiated elite.As the mystery unfolded and the puzzle appeared before us, Jay and I wereastonished that no others seemed to have seen this. And then we realized that ofcourse they had. We had stumbled on the big secret, the grand MacGuffin of humanhistory. All of humanity’s psychodramas seemed to have the secret at their core,even when knowledge of the secret was limited to the initiated few. From thisperspective, what we had been taught to regard as history looked a lot like theresidue of a millennia-long global conflict over control of the secret and itsramifications. As we researched this story, three main currents or groupsemerged. These currents, perhaps better described as collective viewpoints, wedefined by their relationship to the secret.The first group, which we shall call the Priest-Kings, believed it had the rightto possess the secret based on ancient traditions and bloodlines. In contrast tothis basically Osirian position, and making up the second group, were thenihilistic Sethians, who wanted to possess the secret exclusively and werewilling to destroy everything to get it or to keep anyone else from getting it.The ancient myth of Osiris, the rightful king, whose power is usurped by hisevil brother, Seth, and then avenged by his son, Horus, echoes this struggleover control of the secret. The myth retains its power even today, as witnessthe success of Disney’s The Lion King.In between these extremes, in some moral and social gray area, are theOpportunists, the group that is willing to own the secret, use the secret,control the secret, or whatever it takes to provide for its own wealth, power,ego gratification, and so on. We have few mythological metaphors for this groupbecause it is recent, developing only in the last two thousand years. All threeof these groups are mutually antagonistic, yet interdependent. None of themwants the others to gain complete control, yet none can gain it alone. But mostof all, none of them wants to share information with uninitiated outsiders.Someone in the late seventeenth century, however, built an enigmatic mortuarymonument in the quaint Basque coastal town of Hendaye. More than 250 yearslater, an equally mysterious author, Fulcanelli, would add a new chapter to histhirty-year-old book claiming that the “Cyclic Cross of Hendaye” was theultimate expression of “chiliasm” (a belief in the Last Judgment as a literalend of time) as well as a description of the Great Work of alchemy. These simplefacts point to several interesting conclusions.Not only have the initiated few survived for centuries, right down into our owntime, but apparently some of them wanted to reveal the secret as well.Interesting as these conclusions are, they force us to an even more dramaticone. If one of the initiated gave away the secret in 1957, it could only havebeen because the secret was in danger of being lost, or, even worse, co-optedand distorted. By 1957, the balance of power had shifted, and the nihilisticSethians scented final victory in the Cold War breeze.To understand the importance of Fulcanelli’s message, we must remember that bythe late 1950s it must have seemed, to those in the know, that somethingfundamental had changed. The Sethians and the Opportunists had finally learnedto cooperate. The Priest-Kings, with their mystical connections, had almost beendestroyed. The Sethians were in the process of convincing the Opportunists ofthe need for mass suicide by way of an atomic war. The secret of the end of timeand the possible transformation of the human species were in danger of beinglost, forgotten, or changed beyond recognition.The value of Fulcanelli’s revelation can be seen in the amount of misinformationand distortion that obscures any discussion of the person or of his work. EvenJohnson’s Fulcanelli Phenomenon, the only major work on the subject in English,reads like a mass of purposeful confusion, which is epitomized in itspenultimate chapter, a bizarre science-fictional analysis of the Cyclic Cross bysomeone called “Paul Mevryl.” From the information presented in this work, wemight be forgiven for thinking that, while not quite a con man, Fulcanelli andhis disciple Canseliet were perhaps as deluded or delusional as any otheralchemist of the past.And yet, when we read Mystery of the Cathedrals, we find no confused charlatanrambling on about imagined esotericisms. We come face-to-face with one of themost penetrating intellects of the twentieth century. The power of thisintellect appears, especially in Cathedrals, to be driven by an urgent need tocommunicate the outlines of a great mystery. In delineating this mystery,Fulcanelli tried, by piling up images and allusions, to suggest a vastinitiatory process at work in human history. At the core of the book, though, isa question.The first edition, published in 1926, ended with the question unanswered,although a glimpse of the answer can be seen embedded within the brilliantsynthesis of ideas at the heart of Mystery of the Cathedrals. By the time of thesecond edition, 1957, the question had been answered. Fulcanelli decided toreveal the secret of the end of time. When the book was reprinted, he added anew chapter that was more about chiliasm than alchemy and in which he sketchedout the ground rules for solving the puzzle of the Cyclic Cross of Hendaye.Five years later, Morning of the Magicians, by Pauwels and Bergier, became aninternational bestseller. In many ways, this was the start of the New Agemovement and the beginning of the process of obscuring Fulcanelli and his work.This occulting would continue in numerous books and articles about enigmaticevents and unsolved mysteries by Colin Wilson and others. The FulcanelliPhenomenon, published in 1980, compounded the problem and convinced most readersthat any mystery having to do with the cross of Hendaye was simply paranoiacdelusion. Perhaps that’s what the book was intended to do.And here matters remained until Jay and I rashly and naively decided to solvethe puzzle. Like some esoteric Tar Baby lurking at the astral crossroads waitingfor a couple of happy-go-lucky Brer Rabbit–type researchers to come along, themonument’s mystery proved irresistible once touched. We were stuck with it—allthe way to the briar patch.The quest took us from Elberton, Georgia (where a mysterious R. C. Christian hasbuilt a monument to the end of time), to France, Peru, and Egypt. Along the way,we were aided by so much synchronicity and coincidence that we eventuallyconcluded there was a fourth current or group at work, behind the scenes, thatactually wants the secret revealed to as many people as possible. This Free Willparty, as we jokingly called it, seemed to be guiding our research and at timesmanipulating events.That Jay and I got together at all was the result of complex personalsynchronicities that spanned decades and ended with us both, for the mostunlikely and absurd reasons, being in Boulder, Colorado, during the fall of1997. As we started out almost as far apart geographically as it is possible tobe and still be in the United States—I live in central North Carolina and Jaylived at that point on the coast of Washington in the Pacific Northwest—Boulderwas like meeting halfway.Deciphering the monument’s message turned out to be the easy part. Once we hadthe message, deciphered in one rush of comprehension on a stormy Halloween nighthigh in the Rockies, our emphasis shifted to finding out what it meant. Themonument pointed to a specific time period, the intersection point of severalcelestial cycles, and we wanted to know exactly why Fulcanelli had describedthis event as a “double catastrophe” in which the northern hemisphere would betried by fire—Judgment Day, in other words.And that’s where the real synchronistic fun and games began. Books, necessaryvolumes that we needed to see but didn’t even know existed, began to appear:Once an extremely rare book miraculously turned up after access was denied us,and once, even more synchronistically, a key book was left behind in a smokinglounge at Heathrow Airport for us to find. Beyond the source texts, authoritiesbegan to show up—a local Boulder publisher announced a new edition ofFulcanelli’s Dwellings of the Philosophers and let us read the translation as itproceeded. Dr. Paul LaViolette arrived for a conference and redirected our wholeperspective. William Sullivan, John Major Jenkins, Dr. Alberto Villoldo, and Dr.Juan del Prado appeared at crucial moments and added their pieces of the puzzle.Perhaps the most prominent synchronicity of all centers on the image of therose-cross ankh. Several years before Jay and I met, I had every rose-cross ankhin the Coptic Museum in Cairo photographed in an attempt to trace the idea inearly Christianity. By coincidence, we discovered in Arles and at the Louvre aseries of rose-cross ankhs that would have been completely mysterious withoutthe images from the Coptic Museum.Fulcanelli’s use of the word chiliasm gave us a clue to their meaning. Chiliasmis a Gnostic conception of the Christian Last Judgment in which a new existence,a new spiritual reality, supersedes our flawed common reality at the end oftime. Many scholars, such as Elaine Pagels and Ioan Couliano, consider chiliasmto be the most sophisticated of the many first-century eschatologicalperspectives. Chiliasm was never declared heretical and survived as a belief inthe Coptic Church. The ankh, symbol of eternal life, with the blooming flower atits center, represented the chiliastic ideal of the Second Coming as a renewalof all life.The Egyptian origin of this concept suggested to us the antiquity of itsinsight. Following this thread, we found evidence that alchemy, as we have knownit historically, is actually a demonstration of the transmutational physics atwork in the galactic core, and was apparently know to the ancients. The innercore of alchemy appears in this light as the ability to apply the physics ofcreation to the task of personal immortality. And with this knowledge, ofcourse, would come the ability to survive the double catastrophe.If the secret, the grand MacGuffin of human history, is the ability to chart thecelestial timing of the eschatological event, then the only serious questionsbecome: “Is it true?” and “Can we survive?”After compiling and sifting through a huge amount of research, we candefinitively answer the first question: Yes, it’s true. We are about to receivea cosmic wake-up call from the center of the galaxy.As for the second question—Will the celestial event bring extinction orenlightenment?—the answer remains open. The existence, however, of a fourthcurrent, the Free Will, share-the-information party, suggests that there is ananswer.Perhaps human evolution, once certain physical parameters, such as the size ofthe skull versus the width of the mother’s hips, are reached, becomes aninternal, personal process of initiation. Defining this personal process is agalactic wave of change that brings the opportunity of transformation to thosewho have reached the required level of internal transmutation. To those whohaven’t reached this level, perhaps it brings madness and destruction, perhapseven a global catastrophe, in its wake.Because of the politics of secrecy surrounding the knowledge of this oncomingcelestial event, we, as a culture, have been blissfully unaware of its approach.Eschatological speculations long ago became the property of cranks and fringereligions. Science has given the appearance of abdicating its responsibility forinterpreting its own findings. And yet, the knowledge, the gnosis, survived thesecrecy and persecution and is now on the verge of becoming once again a commoncultural perspective.The fourth current, the Free Will party, might just have won out after all.VINCENT BRIDGES"},{"pageContent":"image [images/image21-00.jpg]It has long been believed that the Gothic cathedrals were secret textbooks ofsome hidden knowledge; that behind the gargoyles and the glyphs, the rosewindows and the flying buttresses, a mighty secret lay, all but openlydisplayed.—WALTER LANG, INTRODUCTION,LE MYSTÈRE DES CATHÉDRALESimage [images/image22-00.jpg]WELCOME TO THE WORLD’S GREATEST MYSTERY. It has everything—clues and ciphers,red herrings, and consciously enigmatic jokes. There are villains, victims, andheroes littering the plot line, along with unreadable books, inscrutablemonuments, and strange unearthly figures that flit along through the ages as ifthey had a purchase agreement on eternity.At the heart of the great mystery story interwoven through the whole tapestry ofhuman history lies the Gnostic science of alchemy. In truth, this ancientscience little resembles our modern view of it as a protoscience practiced bydeluded and mercury-crazed visionaries. Intellects as great and as different asIsaac Newton, Leonardo da Vinci, and Carl Jung have found important truthswithin the alchemical tradition and perspective. Newton, in fact, wrote more onalchemy—although much of it has yet to be published—than he did on any othersubject. Jung spent the last decades of his life unraveling the “Western yoga”he had glimpsed amid the jumble of alchemical metaphors. There is somethingabout this strange subject that invites the curious, the intelligent, and thecreative.Yet the image of the medieval “puffer” foolishly working away at his furnaces invain attempts at turning lead into gold remains in our modern iconography. Thisview appeals to our sense of scientific smugness, and it allows us to dismissthe tradition itself as a discredited and archaic hypothesis. But what if thetradition contains a core of truth, and what if the “puffers” are no moredeluded than the modern historians of science who confidently pigeonhole alchemyas a precursor to chemistry? What if “alchemy” is something far different fromwhat most of us have ever dreamed?And what if that core of truth touches upon the deepest and most importantissues of the human condition?image [images/image22-01.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"ONETHE FULCANELLI MYSTERYimage [images/image23-00.jpg]THE APOCALYPSE, THE LOST GENERATION, AND THEREDISCOVERY OF ALCHEMYNearly one hundred years after the fact, World War I, or “the Great War” tothose who lived through it, feels as ancient as all the other wars that camebefore it. Our only connections with that conflict may be faded sepia-tonedimages of our ancestors who marched off to fight for reasons vaguely understood,even to them. Demoted in stature by an even greater war, the First World Warbecame merely the prelude to a century of destruction and horror. Reading of theideals and passions of that long-forgotten era, with its hopes for glory on thebattlefield and the romance of nationalism, feels embarrassing to us now. If wethink of it at all, we assign the Great War an emotional value somewhere betweena massive industrial accident and the migration of lemmings to the sea.And yet, looking back through history, we find many wars and disasters, plaguesand conquests, volcanic eruptions, climatic changes, and mass migrations, but wefind nothing quite like the Great War. It was unique. War up to that point hadbeen an extension of politics; now it became just another industrial andmechanized product, taking on a life of its own in the trenches of the WesternFront. Four hundred years of European intellectual, moral, and technicalsuperiority created the engines of this industrialized murder, thismass-produced slaughter of the innocents. These technological wonders consumedthe very social order that had created them. After four years, theself-proclaimed masters of the universe, Europe’s young, the best and thebrightest of all the old empires and republics, lay broken and bleeding in thewasteland saved from ultimate extinction only by the interference of the UnitedStates and its revolutionary democracy.Was this cultural suicide, perhaps? An apocalypse by any other name is still aneschatological event; it is the end of the world for the inhabitants of thatworld. For example, near the end of the Great War, in September 1918, theTurkish Twelfth Army, holding the ridgeline in front of Damascus that includedthe ancient mound of Meggido, was attacked and destroyed by the combined use ofairplanes, tanks, and cavalry. This battle, apparently, and eerily, described inchapter 16 [31_chapter-title-18.html] of the Book of Revelation, suggests thatArmageddon occurred in 1918.Not only is the battle described in the biblical text, but it also occurred inthe midst of the worst plague since the Black Death of the fourteenth century,the so-called Spanish influenza of 1917–19. Revelation’s apocalypse looks muchlike the history of the twentieth century, leading up to one final millenarianexplosion at or just beyond its end. Could this be true? Could the propheticevents of Saint John’s Revelation be a description of an ongoing process, aseason of destruction that essentially started with the Great War?When the Great War finally ended, at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day ofthe eleventh month, the Old World, with its noble and imperial ways, was trulydead. The “victorious” Allies propped up the corpse of old imperial Europe and,using all the tricks of the undertaker’s trade, gave it the brief appearance ofanimation. After the treaty was signed at Versailles, it decomposed soon enough.But while it lasted, through the 1920s and into the 1930s, this zombie summer offast-fading European superiority galvanized the world.The epicenter of this fleeting corpse-light renaissance was Paris, the City ofLight. During the war this city had been the goal for which millions of men hadmarched, fought, bled, and died, from the taxicabs of Paris that helped createthe Miracle of the Marne until those final days in the late spring of 1918 whenthe German long-range artillery shells fell in the streets. As it had been forcenturies, Paris was a symbol, to both sides in the conflict, of somethingirrepressible in the human character. After the war, it became a mecca for allthose who felt that the world must be changed somehow by the horror andsacrifice of the war, and that this change must mean something, say something,and do something. People came to Paris like insects drawn to the light, havingburned their candles all at once in the final auto-da-fé of Europeancivilization. They firmly believed that out of that conflagration would come abetter world.And so they came to Paris to help create that world: mystics, visionaries,painters, poets, artists of all kind, scientists, political thinkers,revolutionaries, all looking for that new world of hope, peace, and freedomthat, so they felt, must grow out of “the war to end all wars.” ErnestHemingway’s memoir, A Moveable Feast, published after his death, gives a vividaccount of the era. “If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a youngman, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, forParis is a moveable feast,” Hemingway commented.1 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa1]The conflict of the Great War had made them all equal somehow, the artists andthe revolutionaries, the poets and the scientists. They mingled on theboulevards, drank and talked in the cafés and bars and bookstalls, plotted andpainted late into the night in small cold-water flats in Montmartre, or dancedand drank in the nightclubs and demimonde dives of the Latin Quarter. As ifdriven by deep-rooted survival guilt, everyone wanted to live fast, fully, andgloriously. Paris, in the postapocalyptic twenties, was the light of the world,the flash point of history. It was also the beginning of the end of timeitself.2 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa2]Out of this all too brief efflorescence emerged artistic, literary, social,political, and scientific concepts that shaped much of the rest of the century.From the surrealism of André Breton, Max Ernst, and Marcel Duchamp to themathematics of Paul Dirac and the literary pyrotechnics of James Joyce, the ideaof “transformation” bubbled just below the surface.3[36_endnote-title.html#aaa3] It was in 1926, in the thick of this transformativeferment, that an anonymous volume—issued in a luxury edition of three hundredcopies by a small Paris publishing firm known mostly for artisticreprints—rocked the Parisian occult underworld. Its title was Le Mystère descathédrales (The Mystery of the Cathedrals).4 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa4] Theauthor, “Fulcanelli,” claimed that the great secret of alchemy, the queen ofWestern occult sciences, was plainly displayed on the walls of Paris’s owncathedral, Notre-Dame-de-Paris (see fig. 1.1).In 1926, alchemy, by our postmodern lights a quaint and discredited Renaissancepseudoscience, was in the process of being reclaimed and reconditioned by two ofthe most influential movements of the century. Surrealism and psychologystumbled onto alchemy at about the same time, and each attached its own notionsof its meaning to the ancient science. Carl Jung spent the twenties teasing outa theory of the archetypal unconscious from the symbolic tapestry of alchemicalimages and studying how these symbols are expressed in the dream state. Thepoet-philosopher André Breton and the surrealists made an intuitive leap offaith and proclaimed that the alchemical process could be expressedartistically. Breton, in his 1924 Surrealist Manifesto, announced thatsurrealism was nothing but alchemical art.5 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa5]image [images/image26-00.jpg]Figure 1.1. Notre-Dame-de-Paris today. (Photo by Darlene)Fulcanelli’s book would have an indirect influence on both of these intellectualmovements: indirect, because the book managed a major literary miracle—it becameinfluential while remaining, apparently, completely unknown outside of Frenchoccult and alchemical circles. This is perhaps the strangest of all themysteries surrounding The Mystery of the Cathedrals.One illustration suffices to show the magnitude of the occlusion. Take any arthistory text on Gothic cathedrals written in the last thirty years and look atwhat it says about the obscure images found on the walls and entranceways ofNotre-Dame. You will find, four times out of five, that alchemy is mentioned asa possible source of these vaguely Christian images. You will also find,especially if the textbook is in English, that Fulcanelli and The Mystery of theCathedrals are neither mentioned nor given as a source.We may call this the-dog-that-didn’t-bark-in-the-night effect. Like the dog thatdoesn’t make a sound while the house is robbed, Fulcanelli’s work has becomeconspicuous by its absence. On the other hand, the book’s widespread influencesuggests an importance far beyond the antiquarian idea that the cathedrals weredesigned as alchemical texts. To understand the silence, we must firstunderstand Fulcanelli.LE MYSTÈRE DES CATHÉDRALES, ALCHEMY, AND SURREALISMIn the fall of 1925, publisher Jean Schémit received a visit from a small mandressed as a prewar bohemian, with a long Asterix-the-Gaul-style mustache. Theman wanted to talk about Gothic architecture, the “green argot” of itssculptural symbols, and how slang was a kind of punning code, which he calledthe “language of the birds.” A few weeks later, Schémit was introduced to theman again, this time as Jean-Julien Champagne, the illustrator of a proposedbook by a mysterious alchemist called Fulcanelli. Schémit thought that allthree, the visitor, the author, and the illustrator, were the same man. Perhapsthey were.This, such as it is, amounts to our most credible Fulcanelli sighting. As such,it sums up the entire problem posed by the question: Who was Fulcanelli? Beyondthis ambiguous encounter, he exists as words on a page and, in some occultcircles, as a mythic alchemical immortal with the status, or identity, of aSaint Germain. There were two things that everyone agreed upon concerningFulcanelli—he was definitely a mind to be reckoned with and he was a trueenigma.What seems to have happened is that a young occultist upstart named EugèneCanseliet offered the publisher the manuscript of Le Mystère des cathédrales,after the mysterious visitor had cleared the way. Schémit bought it andCanseliet wrote a preface for the book in which he stated that the author, his“master” Fulcanelli, had departed this realm. He then goes on to thankJean-Julien Champagne, the man whom Schémit thought was Fulcanelli, for theillustrations.Champagne, a minor symbolist artist and inventor far into an absinthe-fueleddecline, had gathered around him a small entourage including Canseliet. The talkcentered on alchemy when they met in the small cafés of Montmartre. Champagnelived nearby, in the rue de Rochechouart, and his sixth-floor room in thecrumbling Parisian tenement was often the scene of late-night symposia on allsorts of occult subjects. To his young friends, he must have seemed like a ghostfrom another age, with his unfashionably long hair, his riddles, and, most ofall, his claim to know the secrets of alchemy.At the time, no one else but Schémit seemed to believe that Jean-JulienChampagne was Canseliet’s master, Fulcanelli. His taste for great quantities ofPernod and absinthe indicated a man too dissipated to be as knowledgeable anderudite as the author of Le Mystère. Champagne certainly did know a realalchemist, though, whoever Fulcanelli was, and his illustrations show that heindeed had a more than passing familiarity with the alchemical art.So we are left with the mystery of the missing master alchemist. He is a man whodoes not seem to exist, yet he is re-created constantly in the imagination ofevery seeker—a perfect foil for projection. We might even think it was all ajoke, some kind of elaborate hoax, except for the material itself. When oneturns to Le Mystère, one finds a witty intelligence that seems quite sure of thenature and importance of his information. This “Fulcanelli” knows something andis trying to communicate his knowledge; of this there can be no doubt.Fulcanelli’s main strategy, the key to unraveling the mystery, lies in anunderstanding of what he calls the “phonetic law” of the “spoken cabala,” or the“language of the birds.” This punning, multilingual wordplay can be used toreveal unusual and, according to Fulcanelli, meaningful associations betweenideas. “What unsuspected marvels we should find, if we knew how to dissectwords, to strip them of their bark and liberate the spirit, the divine lightwhich is within,” Fulcanelli writes. He claims that in our day this is thenatural language of the outsiders, the outlaws and heretics at the fringes ofsociety. (See appendix A [31_chapter-title-18.html], “Fulcanelli on the GreenLanguage,” for the complete text of this chapter.)6 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa6]This spoken cabala was also the “green language” of the Freemasons (“All theInitiates expressed themselves in cant,” Fulcanelli reminds us) who built theart gothique of the cathedrals. “Gothic art is in fact the art got or artcot—χοτ—the art of light or of the spirit,” Fulcanelli informs us. Ultimatelythe “art got,” or the “art of light,” is derived from the language of the birds,which seems to be a sort of Ur-language taught by both Jesus and the ancients.Fulcanelli also claims that Rabelais’s five-volume work Gargantua and Pantagruelis “a novel in cant,” that is, written in the secret language. Offhandedly, healso mentions Tiresias, the Greek seer who revealed to mortals the secrets ofOlympus. Tiresias was taught the language of the birds by Athena, the goddess ofwisdom. Just as casually, Fulcanelli notes the similarity between gothic andgoetic, suggesting that Gothic art is a magic art.From this, we see that Fulcanelli’s message, that there is a secret in thecathedrals, and that this secret was placed there by a group of initiates—ofwhich Fulcanelli is obviously one—depends upon an abundance of imagery andassociation that overpowers the intellect, lulling one into an intuitive stateof acceptance. Fulcanelli is undoubtedly brilliant, but we are left wondering ifhis is the brilliance of revelation or of dissimulation.The basic premise of the book—that Gothic cathedrals are hermetic books instone—was an idea that made it into print in the nineteenth century in the workof Victor Hugo. In The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hugo spends a whole chapter(chapter 2 of book 5) on the idea that architecture is the great book ofhumanity, and that the invention of printing and the proliferation of mundanebooks spelled the end of the sacred book of architecture. He reports that theGothic era was the sacred architect’s greatest achievement, that the cathedralswere expressions of liberty and the emergence of a new sense of freedom. “Thisfreedom goes to great lengths,” Hugo informs us. “Occasionally a portal, afacade, an entire church is presented in a symbolic sense entirely foreign toits creed, and even hostile to the church. In the thirteenth century, Guillaumeof Paris, in the fifteenth Nicolas Flamel, both are guilty of these seditiouspages.”7 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa7] (See fig. 1.2.)Essentially, Le Mystère is an in-depth examination of those “seditious pages” instone. Fulcanelli elaborates on the symbolism of certain images found on thewalls and porches of architect Guillaume of Paris’s masterpiece, Notre DameCathedral, and its close contemporary, Notre Dame of Amiens. To this he addsimages from two houses built in the Gothic style from fifteenth-century Bourges.This guided tour of hermetic symbolism is densely obscure, filled with “greenlanguage” puns and numerous allusions. To the casual reader, and even thededicated student, this tangled web of scholarship is daunting.image [images/image30-01.jpg]Figure 1.2. Symbolic knowledge displayed as ornamentation on the Gothiccathedrals, side panel from Notre-Dame-de-Paris. (Photo by Darlene)But even after careful reading, one finds that the “mystery” of the cathedralsis never explained, and that what one assumes to be the basic mystery of alchemyis only glancingly delineated. There are allusions that escape the reader aseasily as a mosquito glimpsed out of the corner of one’s eye. At moments, aflash of great truth may occur, giving a hint of something profound, and then,like the mosquito, it is gone. Frustrated, the reader starts over, proceedingeven more carefully, following the allusions and associations, trying to findand pin down the core of meaning that he senses is there, somewhere.All this makes Le Mystère an almost perfect surrealist text, a modern alchemicalversion of Lautréamont’s Chants of Maldoror, the surrealists’ favoritenineteenth-century novel. The surrealists also embraced Rabelais and understoodthis kind of linguistic alchemy in terms of the correspondences and connectionsbetween objects or ideas on different levels or scales of being. The classicexample of this is Lautréamont’s “sudden juxtaposition on a dissecting table ofa sewing machine and an umbrella.”8 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa8]And yet, even though Fulcanelli’s basic idea—an operational and linguisticalchemy used by sages or hermetic philosophers to transform one’s perception ofreality—became part of surrealism’s intellectual currency, none of thesurrealists, with one exception, mentions Fulcanelli or Mystery of theCathedrals. One of surrealism’s founding influences, Marcel Duchamp, was deeplyinterested in all things alchemical and was in Paris in 1926 when Le Mystère waspublished. Duchamp’s work touches on many themes that we shall find inFulcanelli’s work and legend, including a fondness for puns and “green language”usages and a gender-bending sensibility that echoes the androgyny of thealchemical adept. Indeed, Duchamp’s alter ego, “Rrose Selavy,” and particularlyMan Ray’s 1920 photos of Duchamp as “Selavy,” hint at Canseliet’s last encounterwith Fulcanelli.9 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa9]Only Max Ernst, another surrealist influenced by alchemy, makes any allusion toFulcanelli, and this in his Beyond Painting, published in 1936. One of Ernst’searly works, Of This Men Shall Know Nothing, painted in 1923 (see fig. 1.3),eerily echoes the symbolism on the Hendaye cross, which, as we shall see, didnot become part of Fulcanelli’s Le Mystère until the second edition in 1957. Thepicture was dedicated to André Breton and painted with the stated intent ofdefining the myth of our time.By the late 1940s, the work of the movement’s founder, André Breton—in both hisbook Arcana 17 and the catalogue for the 1947 surrealist exhibition—appears tobe heavily influenced by Fulcanelli. Surrealism in 1947, the exhibitioncatalogue, is full of seemingly Fulcanelli-inspired articles such as “Liberty ofLanguage,” by Arpad Merzei. In this article Merzei explains the “occultdialectic through linguistics.” Merzei goes on to announce that language is“really an ensemble of symbols. And this conception of language is not far offfrom that which existed in magical civilizations, because the interchangeabilityof reality and language . . . is the base and the principal key of all hermeticactivity.”10 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa10]image [images/image32-00.jpg]Figure 1.3. Max Ernst’s Of This Men Shall Know Nothing, 1923 (Tate Gallery,London). This intriguing painting echoes the cosmological motif found on thecross at Hendaye.André Breton himself contributed a chart to the catalogue for Surrealism in 1947showing personalities and their associations with the images of the Tarot cards,a continuation of the ideas that he had laid out in Arcana 17. While the Tarotis not an obvious connection to Fulcanelli and Mystery of the Cathedrals, as weshall see, Breton’s use of the Tarot as a series of alchemical metaphorssuggests that he had read Fulcanelli even closer than most. Ten years later, in1957, Breton wrote The Art of Magic, in which he insists that magic is an innatecapacity of all humanity that can never be long suppressed or controlled. 11[36_endnote-title.html#aaa11] And with that admission, surrealism takes itsplace alongside the literary works of Joyce, Lovecraft, and Borges as animportant twentieth-century artistic addition to the Western occult tradition.12[36_endnote-title.html#aaa12]It would seem that Fulcanelli contributed to that artistic evolution, exceptthat the conspicuous absence of direct reference to him argues against it.Fulcanelli’s ideas seem to be present in surrealism from its inception, growingmore prominent as the movement matured. Possibly one answer lies in theanonymity of Fulcanelli himself. Since “Fulcanelli” is a pseudonym, thesurrealists may have absorbed his ideas from a common source, the real personbehind the name. As we shall see, this is an intriguing and possibly significantclue.Yet, even that idea fails to explain the curious reluctance of anyone,surrealist, art historian, or alchemical scholar, to address the meaning ofFulcanelli’s work. Once again, this conspicuous absence is very suggestive. Eventhe great American occult historian Manly P. Hall fails to mention Fulcanelli.Many scholarly books written since the 1930s about alchemy and its history failto mention the two known books by Fulcanelli. Why?The silence suggests a secret. The “mystery” of the cathedrals is the secret ofalchemy in the sense that alchemy is an ancient initiatory science. “Fulcanelli”selected his symbolic images carefully to convey that he did indeed know thesecret. Much has been made by the few occultists who have looked into Fulcanelliand his work about the difficulty of his writing. Threading a path throughFulcanelli’s labyrinth of classical allusions is daunting to all but those whoenjoy sampling ancient wisdom for its own sake. Without a key, the text remains,reading after reading, incomprehensible. As in the Sufi story, however, thegreatest treasure is hidden in plain sight. Fulcanelli slyly directs us with hiscomment on goetic or magic art: The magic, the secret, is in the art.As with the surrealists, to the occult savants of Paris in the late 1920s,Fulcanelli’s book was almost intoxicating. Here, finally, was the word of a manwho knew, the voice of the last true initiate. His student Eugène Canselietinforms us in the preface to the first edition of Le Mystère that Fulcanelli hadaccomplished the Great Work and then disappeared from the world. “For a longtime now the author of this book has not been among us,” Canseliet wrote, and hewas lamented by a group of “unknown brothers who hoped to obtain from him thesolution to the mysterious Verbum dimissum (missing word).”13[36_endnote-title.html#aaa13]Mystification about the true identity of the alchemist obscured the fact thatcredible people had seen his visiting card, emblazoned with an aristocraticsignature. It was possible to encounter people at the Chat Noir nightclub inParis who claimed to have met Fulcanelli right through World War II.14[36_endnote-title.html#aaa14] Between 1926 and 1929, his legend grew, fueled bycafé gossip and a few articles and reviews in obscure Parisian occult journals.Canseliet contributed more information: The Master had indeed accomplishedtransmutation, Fulcanelli hadn’t really disappeared, another book or two wasplanned, and so on.By 1929, when Fulcanelli’s second book, Les Demeures philosophales (Dwellings ofthe Philosophers),15 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa15] appeared, the world of Frenchoccultism was ready for a revelation. What it received, however, was somethingof a disappointment, an anticlimax. Canseliet, in his preface to this volume,gives away nothing sensational. Nothing is said about the origin of the work orits relationship to Le Mystère. The reader is left with the sense thatFulcanelli was still alive and on the scene, with only a few bare hints as tohis attainments.Dwellings of the Philosophers is an uneven work, lacking the thematic coherenceand symbolic wordplay displayed in Le Mystère, despite the latter’s intentionalinscrutability. Dwellings follows many of the same themes and symbolic threadsas Le Mystère; in fact, there is little in it that is actually new. WhatDwellings does, however, is put our understanding of alchemical adeptship in thesixteenth and seventeenth centuries on an entirely different footing. We come tounderstand that “alchemy” is a deep and rich stream of tradition, but we areleft questioning exactly what “alchemy” is. Fulcanelli seems to shift his focusfrom lab work to astral voyages to an arcane lineage of adepts. The voice thatseemed to know so much in Le Mystère, although expressed with cryptic imageryand allusions, is here hesitant and unclear. Discussions begin on practicalalchemy that do not lead anywhere and the passing references to the key issue ofLe Mystère, the recognition of a language-like structure behind the alchemicalprocess, only adds to the confusion.The critical response to Dwellings of the Philosophers was lukewarm at best.Interest waned, even when Canseliet revealed the existence of a third volume byFulcanelli, Finis Gloria Mundi, in 1935. By 1937, Fulcanelli was a merely alegend of occult Paris in the twenties, and Canseliet had moved on to writingbooks on alchemy under his own name. All hope of publishing the last volumefaded in the depression and crisis of the late thirties, and disappearedcompletely as the Nazis occupied France in the spring of 1940. Nothing is knownabout Canseliet’s activities during the war.After the war, Fulcanelli’s legend, and Canseliet’s career, profited from anupsurge of interest in all things metaphysical. By the mid-1950s, conditionswere right to reprint both Le Mystère des cathédrales and Dwellings of thePhilosophers. Simply by having been the mysterious Fulcanelli’s student,Canseliet had become the grand old man of French alchemy and esotericism. Butthe fifties were not the twenties, and many things had changed. One of thosethings was the text of Le Mystère itself.A NEW CHAPTERThe Fulcanelli affair would be of interest only to specialists of occult historyand abnormal psychology except for the singular mystery of the extra chapteradded to the 1957 edition of Le Mystère. This second edition included a newchapter entitled “The Cyclic Cross of Hendaye” and a few changes in itsillustrations. No mention of these changes appeared in Canseliet’s preface tothe second edition.A few detractors, as early as the publication of Dwellings, had been suspiciousthat the whole affair was the work of a group of occult pranksters centered onthe bookstore of Pierre Dujols in the Luxembourg district of Paris. The criticshave archly suggested that the whole venture was an obscure literary hoax,perhaps designed to give the Brotherhood of Heliopolis, as the group liked tocall itself, the cachet of a real tradition.16 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa16] Itmust be admitted that if that were indeed the case, they failed miserably.Any motivation for a hoax, in the ordinary sense, seems to be lacking. None ofthe Brotherhood, such as it was, benefited from or capitalized on the supposedFulcanelli’s teaching, except Eugène Canseliet and possibly Jean-JulienChampagne, who illustrated both volumes. The Brotherhood of Heliopolis seems tohave remained small and closed, limited to Champagne and his friends, and fadedaway after his death in 1932.The publisher, Jean Schémit, however, assumed that “Fulcanelli” and Champagnewere one and the same, and, given his meetings with Champagne and Fulcanelli,his opinion carries some weight. Certainly, if Champagne was not Fulcanelli, hewas in fact his agent. Canseliet’s role seemed, to Schémit, to be more of anamanuensis or secretary. Fulcanelli dévoilé, by Geneviève Dubois, a Frenchexamination of the Fulcanelli legend published in 1993, even concludes that thework was a product of a committee with Pierre Dujols (who died in 1926, the yearLe Mystère was published) supplying the scholarship, Champagne the operationalskills, and Canseliet in charge of assembling the notes.17[36_endnote-title.html#aaa17]But even if we agree, for the sake of argument, that Champagne and his friendsare our best candidate for Fulcanelli’s secret identity, the question remains:Who wrote the extra chapter in the second edition of Le Mystère? Champagne was aquarter of a century dead when the second edition appeared. It is unlikely thathe was the author, even though internal evidence suggests that it was written atleast a decade before his death, as it is unlikely that he was the author of therest of Le Mystère. In the opening paragraph of the Hendaye chapter, Fulcanellirefers to “a new beach, bristling with proud villas,” and in the next paragraphcomments on the leafy trees surrounding Saint Vincent’s church on the townsquare. Hendaye-Plage, or beach, didn’t exist until the early 1920s, and theproud villas appeared in 1923 when the intellectuals and bohemians discoveredthe town. The trees around the church died in the late 1930s and were clearedaway during the war. Therefore, the visit on which the Hendaye chapter is basedhappened between roughly 1924 and 1938.With Canseliet’s use of everything else by Fulcanelli—or Champagne and Dujols,the “Fulcanelli” group—how are we to account for the absence of reference toHendaye in Canseliet’s works prior to the mid-1950s? If the chapter is the workof Champagne, then Canseliet must have known about it. This is not a trivialquestion. The Hendaye chapter is perhaps the single most astounding esotericwork in Western history. It offers proof that alchemy is connected toeschatology, or the timing of the end of the world. And it offers the conclusionthat a “double catastrophe” is imminent. If Canseliet had known of this, hewould surely have used it, or at least mentioned it. Yet the silence is completeand compelling.So where did the chapter come from? We do have one intriguing clue that servesto compound the mystery. In 1936, Jules Boucher, by Canseliet’s recollection aperipheral member of the group but by his own account an integral part,published a two-page spread in the obscure occult revue Consolation called “TheCross of Hendaye.”18 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa18] Apparently, a painter namedLemoine took some photos of the cross while vacationing near Hendaye and showedthem to a friend, the editor of Consolation, Maryse Choisy. From there, JulesBoucher, a young occult writer, was commissioned to write an “esoteric” articleon the cross (fig. 1.4).image [images/image37-00.jpg]Figure 1.4. Jules Boucher’s original article for Consolation on the Hendayecross, 1936.Boucher’s article is significant more for the differences between his versionand that attributed to Fulcanelli than it is for any similarities. Boucherclearly understood enough of the symbolism on the monument to unravel itssecret, but he gave no hint of any deeper understanding of the cross.Fulcanelli, however, is direct and clear. He knows specifics and gives cluesthat can have come only from direct knowledge. There is nothing to suggest thatCanseliet copied Boucher’s article and fabricated the new Hendaye chapter fromit. But there is evidence that Boucher had been exposed, somehow, to theinformation in that chapter.The clue lies in Boucher’s use of Fulcanelli’s translation of the oddly spacedinscription on the front of the cross. Normally arranged, the phrase is thesimple O Crux Ave Spes Unica, “Hail, O Cross, the Only Hope” of thousands ofcemetery monuments. But, as shown in figure 1.5, the final s of the Latin spes,or “hope,” is displaced from the first line so that the inscription reads O CruxAves / Pes Unica. Boucher uses what he perceives to be an additional oddity inspacing to suggest that the inscription should be read phonetically in French asO Croix Have Espace Unique, or “O cross, the single pale space.”19[36_endnote-title.html#aaa19] (See fig. 1.5.)image [images/image38-00.jpg]Figure 1.5. Top of the Hendaye cross showing the broken Latin inscription.(Photo by Darlene)In his Hendaye chapter Fulcanelli phrased it as, “It is written that Life takesrefuge in a single space.”20 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa20] From this, we can seethat Boucher has heard or read Fulcanelli’s version and then gone looking forits origin in the Latin phrase. It is unlikely that anyone stumbling on theHendaye cross without this key piece of linguistic wordplay to guide him wouldever consider trying to form French words from a strangely divided Latin phrase.But his derivation is flawed, and yields only a close approximation ofFulcanelli’s phrase. As we shall show in chapter 11 [25_chapter-title-13.html]when we discuss it in detail, Fulcanelli meant just what he said about how toread this symbolic inscription. It becomes clear that Boucher was consulting asource that seems to be at least partially the text of the new Hendaye chapter.There is no evidence that Canseliet knew anything about Boucher’s article, butconsidering that Boucher was part of the circle, it is likely that he did.Researchers rediscovered it only long after the second edition of Le Mystère waspublished, and it remains the only contemporary publication on Hendaye’s cross.Therefore, Boucher’s independent approach to the cross suggests that Fulcanelliwas still in contact with some of his students, just not with Canseliet.So if Canseliet didn’t copy Boucher, and the rest of the group “Fulcanelli” wasdead when it was published, where did Canseliet get the new chapter? If it hadbeen written in the mid-1920s and not used for some reason, then why the needfor secrecy? And was Canseliet in on the secret? Unless we suppose that Boucherreceived his information from Canseliet, which is unlikely given Canseliet’scomments on the peripheral nature of Boucher’s involvement in the group, thenthe mystery of the Hendaye cross was one of Fulcanelli’s most closely guardedsecrets.One possible solution is that Canseliet met the real Fulcanelli again and got itstraight from the source. Canseliet claims that just such a meeting actuallytook place, in the Pyrenees in the early 1950s. While Hendaye is never mentionedin Canseliet’s account, the story itself is quite spectacular in itsstrangeness.21 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa21]To place the tale of Canseliet’s last encounter with Fulcanelli in any sort ofcontext, we must cut through the tangled accounts of Canseliet’s relationshipwith “the Master.” Born in late 1899, Eugène Canseliet claimed to have metFulcanelli shortly after the start of the Great War, while still an adolescent.The next year, he claimed to have met Champagne as another of Fulcanelli’sstudents. Later in life, Canseliet declared that he had spent fifteen years withFulcanelli, implying, since they seem to have met in 1915, that he last saw theMaster in 1930.From the mid-1920s until Champagne’s death in 1932, however, Canseliet livedacross the hall from Champagne in a cold-water walkup in the Butte-Montmartredistrict. Therefore Canseliet was the one person most likely to know ifChampagne really was Fulcanelli. And to the end, Canseliet denied that Champagnewas anything more than the illustrator.Even though Canseliet had the most to gain by perpetuating the myth ofFulcanelli, it is obvious that there is something more than just self-servingegoism at work in his descriptions of Fulcanelli. If Fulcanelli had really beeneither Dujols or Champagne, then why would Canseliet continue the hoax longafter they were dead? Why change Le Mystère at all? Why not admit the wholething and claim the credit? And yet Canseliet went to his grave declaring thatFulcanelli was a real person, and was certainly not Champagne or Dujols.22[36_endnote-title.html#aaa22]The history of alchemy is replete with complex hoaxes and mysterious adepts, andat first glance this appears to be just another of these attempts atmystification. Canseliet certainly had the most to gain from the promotion ofFulcanelli the “Master,” and is therefore the least reliable of all thewitnesses. And yet his story contains important clues that do point to apossible reality for “Fulcanelli” at the core of the elaborate charade.Therefore, let us suspend disbelief, take Eugène Canseliet’s story at facevalue, and see if we can find the truth of his relationship with Fulcanelli.As noted above, Canseliet claimed to have met the group around Fulcanelli justafter the war began and seems to have worked directly with them through the waryears. Sometime after 1919, Fulcanelli seems to have faded from the scene as adirect presence. At least that is the assumption based on the admittedlyconflicting evidence of Canseliet’s changing versions of the story. Canselietlater told Robert Amadou that Fulcanelli left Paris for the East in 1922. Butthe contact with Fulcanelli, whoever he was, left the Brotherhood of Heliopolis—Canseliet, Champagne, and the rest—in possession of several secrets.These included the secret of physical transmutation, according to some ofCanseliet’s later accounts. In the mid-1970s, just a few years before his death,he told the American occultist Walter Lang that he and Champagne and anotherBrother, Gaston Sauvage, performed a transmutation in 1922, in the municipalgasworks laboratory of Sarcelles, with a minute amount of the powder ofprojection given to him by Fulcanelli.23 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa23] In aconversation with Albert Riedel (Frater Albertus of the Paracelsus ResearchSociety), Canseliet claimed that he performed the transmutation underFulcanelli’s direction.24 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa24] To some, this suggeststhat Fulcanelli was literally there in the room, demonstrating the correcttechnique. Actually, Canseliet is saying no more than that he was followingFulcanelli’s directions, which could have been written down years before.Frater Albertus, however, had information from independent sources thatFulcanelli himself had performed a transmutation in Bourges in 1937 in thepresence of Ferdinand de Lesseps II and Pierre Curie.25[36_endnote-title.html#aaa25] This would suggest that our supposition thatBoucher had an independent contact with Fulcanelli was correct, and thatFulcanelli was still on the scene in the late 1930s. Unfortunately, Albertusdoes not supply us with the source of his information. Canseliet claimed to knownothing of the incident. It might be easy to dismiss it as one more occultfabrication, except for the mention of de Lesseps and Curie. Canseliet confirmedthat they were among Fulcanelli’s large circle of friends. This, as we shallsee, is possibly the most significant clue of all.It is perhaps this early connection with scientists such as Curie that led theOSS and other Allied intelligence agencies to search for Fulcanelli immediatelyafter the Second World War. Canseliet confirms this in his conversation withFrater Albertus, and implies that they are still seeking him.26[36_endnote-title.html#aaa26] Apparently, then, Fulcanelli, on some level orother, seems have been a real presence right through the end of the war in 1945.For a man who died or disappeared before 1926, if we are to take Canseliet’sfirst preface to Le Mystère at face value, that’s a pretty active record. Bysifting through Canseliet’s statements, however, we can determine a sort ofminimal time line. From 1915 to around 1919, Canseliet was in direct contactwith Fulcanelli. He visited Canseliet, perhaps to deliver the powder ofprojection and a stack of manuscripts, at Sarcelles in 1922. Then, Canseliettells us in his various accounts, he saw him again in 1930 and once more,miraculously, in 1952.In many ways, this simplified chronology makes the most sense. Fulcanelli wasnever seen visiting Champagne or Canseliet, because he wasn’t in contact withthem during the period that they lived next door to each other. He visitedCanseliet at Sarcelles and we are never told where the 1930 meeting took place.This literal absence of Fulcanelli explains many of the minor mysteries such asthe liberties Canseliet and Champagne took with the project of publishing hiswork and teachings. Perhaps Canseliet truly meant what he said in the preface tothe first edition of Le Mystère and never expected to see Fulcanelli again?What a shock, then, when he returned in 1930, after both books had beenpublished. Perhaps Fulcanelli wasn’t pleased by what Canseliet and Champagne haddone with his work. This might explain Champagne’s sudden decline into apathyand alcoholism, which led to his death two years later. Certainly, Fulcanellibroke off contact with Canseliet, after fifteen years, leaving him to his owndevices. Some sort of signal was arranged, however, in case Fulcanelli everwanted to get back in touch with Canseliet. We know this because, if Canselietis to be believed, something of the sort apparently happened.In 1952, after a wait of almost twenty-two years, Canseliet claimed to have methis master one last time. Before his death, Canseliet told the story, in severalversions, to a number of friends and researchers.27[36_endnote-title.html#aaa27] When he received the signal, Canseliet went to aspecific city where a car met him and drove him deep into the Pyrenees. Arrivingat a large château, Canseliet was greeted by his old master, Fulcanelli, nowlooking the same age as Canseliet himself—then in his early fifties—even thoughhe would have been around eighty in 1930.28 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa28]From here on, Canseliet’s story becomes vague and dreamlike as shock piled uponshock. Like Parzival’s first visit to the Grail Castle, wonders pass in front ofCanseliet without his ever asking the question Why? And, like Parzival,Canseliet ends up on the outside, the castle having vanished, wondering justwhat it was all about.He was given a room in an upper turret and a “petit laboratoire” in which toconduct his experiments. He was so impressed by the small laboratory that hebegan to wonder what the grand laboratory might be like in comparison.Gradually, as he met the other visitors, it began to dawn on Canseliet that hismaster’s château was a refuge for advanced alchemical adepts. That evening, hesaw a group of small children, dressed in sixteenth-century clothes, playing inthe courtyard below his window. Canseliet, like Parzival, didn’t think to askany questions. He went to bed and forgot about it.29[36_endnote-title.html#aaa29]Days passed, with Canseliet happily puttering around in his laboratory.Fulcanelli stopped by occasionally to see how he was doing, but Canseliet isvague about their discussions. Then one morning Canseliet woke early and wentdownstairs into the courtyard for a breath of air without doing more thanthrowing on his clothes. As he stood there with his shirt unbuttoned and hisbraces hanging loose from trousers, three women entered the courtyard,chattering in happy feminine voices.Embarrassed, Canseliet froze, hoping that they wouldn’t notice him standing inthe doorway. As they passed, one of the three turned and looked directly atCanseliet and smiled. Shocked to his core, Canseliet recognized the face of theyoung woman as that of his master, Fulcanelli.Canseliet would talk and write about his visit to the castle of the adepts manytimes before his death, but he saved this gem of pure strangeness for hisclosest friends. The story appeared in print only after his death, in Kenneth R.Johnson’s The Fulcanelli Phenomenon, a book about which we shall have much tosay later on. The end of the tale is very confused, but Canseliet eventuallyleft the castle. Fulcanelli, however, gave him a word of warning before he left,reported by Canseliet in the 1964 edition of his Alchimie: “The time will come,my son, when you will no longer be able to work in alchemy, when it will becomenecessary for you to search for the rare and blessed land along the frontiers tothe south.”30 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa30]And this is as close as we get, from the perspective of Canseliet’s mythmaking,to the origin of the Hendaye chapter and its curious mention of a disaster and aplace of refuge. But for the reality of that additional chapter, it might bepossible to dismiss this story as an old man’s fabrication. Whatever reallyhappened, the fact that the second edition of Le Mystère contained the newchapter on the Hendaye cross forces us to reexamine the whole problem ofFulcanelli’s identity.After that supposed encounter, however, Fulcanelli seems to have truly vanished.Canseliet never saw him again and neither has anyone else with any degree ofcertainty. We are left with a trail of obscure clues and semi-mythical eventsthat echo the gender-bending “Rrose Selavy” of Duchamp, the linguistic alchemyproclaimed by Breton and Merzei, and the general “put-on” quality of asurrealist happening.Could the Hendaye chapter have been meant for inclusion in Dwellings, perhaps asa follow-up to the monument on the Marne? Or was it perhaps the only survivingfragment of Finis Gloria Mundi not reclaimed by an angry “Fulcanelli” in 1930?If so, why was it kept secret and leaked, as it were, to sources other thanCanseliet such as Jules Boucher? Could it be, perhaps, that the Hendaye chapterwas withheld because it contained clues to the identity of Fulcanelli, both asan individual and as a group? Would it have given away the whole game to publishit before the mid-1950s?The solution to that riddle must wait until after we have examined the growth ofthe Fulcanelli legend.THE FULCANELLI LEGENDHowever we approach the subject of alchemy, we are rewarded with a mystery,until the entire subject becomes an infinite regression of mirrored mysteries.And so, if we are not careful, we end up finding only the face of our own bias.The secret protects itself, even when it is displayed in plain sight.Fulcanelli serves as an example. The occult savants of Paris wanted to believein the possibility of physical transmutation, so the suggestion that someone hadactually done it grew into an obsession. Fulcanelli was a modern-day Flamel, arenegade chemist who, like the Curies, had stumbled on a way to manipulate theradioactive “light” locked within matter. No matter that not a trace of anyspeculation concerning atomic energy could be found in Le Mystère; allalchemists wrote in code anyway. So the mystery focused on who Fulcanelli was.If his identity could be discovered, then the transmutation could be verified.Unfortunately, no one ever claimed the title and presented his bona fides.But the idea persisted. There had been a “real” alchemist in the twentiethcentury. There is even a touch of the surreal to the image: a tall aristocraticelder guiding a group of young acolytes through the transmutational process in amunicipal gasworks laboratory. Canseliet, of course, is our source for theseimages, leaked through the years as a way, perhaps, to carefully perpetuate themyth.31 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa31]In the same fashion, the idea that “Fulcanelli” was simply a committee “hoax”has also handicapped our understanding of what the work itself has to say. Theexample of the Hendaye chapter is significant here; because it can’t be made tofit neatly into any hypothesis, it is simply ignored. Yet it is key tounderstanding the deepest secret of alchemy, and perhaps even the key toFulcanelli’s identity.The appearance of the second edition of Dwellings of the Philosophers, in 1959,marked another watershed. The catastrophe theme was openly discussed in thefinal two chapters, “The Sundial of Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh” and “TheParadox of the Unlimited Progress of Science,” as well as in Canseliet’s prefaceto that edition.32 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa32] Within the year, the legendwould gain another twist with the publication of the first New Age bestseller,Le Matin des magiciens, by Pauwels and Bergier, which would appear in English in1963 as The Morning of the Magicians. The Fulcanelli phenomenon began to exhibitnew life, growing in unexpected directions.33 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa33]Magicians cemented the image of Fulcanelli as the archetypal twentieth-centuryalchemist, warning of the dangers of atomic energy like the best contemporary“space brothers” and ascended masters. In 1960, this was undoubtedly the view ofthe occult establishment, whose perspectives Pauwels and Bergier were exploring.Although their work is a mish-mash of ideas, Pauwels and Bergier do manage toask some of the right questions. In the course of this investigation, we wouldfind ourselves returning again and again to the synchronicities of Morning ofthe Magicians.The book did serve, however, to introduce the story of Fulcanelli to anEnglish-speaking audience. A decade or so later, this interest would bear fruitin the excellent translation by Mary Sworder of Le Mystère’s second edition.Soon after the translation was published, the only full-scale work on alchemyand Fulcanelli in English appeared. The Fulcanelli Phenomenon, by Kenneth RaynorJohnson, published in England in 1980, raised more questions than it answered.Johnson’s discussion of the history and practice of alchemy and on Fulcanelliand Canseliet is solid and well presented. In some cases, it is our only sourcefor large pieces of the puzzle. The careful reader, however, encounters a fairamount of special pleading, for Johnson, ultimately, is obscuring as much as heis revealing. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the epilogue, an examinationof the Hendaye cross written by someone named Paul Mevryl.In a way, we should be grateful that anyone had the courage to comment on theHendaye cross in print. Mevryl tackles it head-on in a wild explosion of sciencefiction and creative cryptography. The skeptical reader may be forgiven forthrowing up his hands in disgust and declaring the whole thing a hoax or ahallucination. And, perhaps, that is exactly what the article was intended toaccomplish.34 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa34]Fulcanelli, and alchemy in general, is a subject that inspires obscurantistliterature. Most books on alchemy, particularly those written by adepts, aredesigned to confuse the unwary or naive reader. Only those readers who possessthe key to the language can read their real message. But the books written aboutFulcanelli, starting with Morning of the Magicians, fall into a new category ofobscurantism. They seem specifically designed to obscure Fulcanelli, as if hehad somehow given away too much.The next major work to mention Fulcanelli in any depth is also deeply obscure.Refuge of the Apocalypse, by Elizabeth Van Buren, begins with a description ofthe Hendaye cross and Fulcanelli’s comments on it. She quotes Fulcanelli’swarning to Canseliet, and then jumps to a statement that Fulcanelli told othersthat the place of refuge was Rennes-le-Château, in the Aude in southern France.From this slender reed, Van Buren builds a complex thesis that involves thebloodline of Jesus, tunnel openings, and landscape zodiacs, all pointing toRennes-le-Château as Fulcanelli’s “single place of refuge.”35[36_endnote-title.html#aaa35]This digression into the world of Holy Blood, Holy Grail, by Baigent, Lincoln,and Leigh, was strange enough. The next book to dwell on Fulcanelli was not asbizarre, but it raised some curious questions. Al-Kemi: A Memoir—Hermetic,Occult, Political, and Private Aspects of R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz, by AndréVandenBroeck, revealed that Schwaller, an esoteric Egyptologist and author ofthe monumental Temple of Man, had close connections with the Fulcanelli group.VandenBroeck strongly suggests that Schwaller de Lubicz actually was Fulcanelli,or at least the author of Le Mystère, and that Champagne stole his work.36[36_endnote-title.html#aaa36]At this point, all a researcher can do is to echo poor Alice: “curiouser andcuriouser.” And, like Alice, somewhere along the line we stepped through thelooking glass.THE CROSS AT HENDAYEFrom the mouth of the Nive at Bayonne to the Straits of Bidassoa, the southwestcoast of France is known as the Côte d’Argent, in contrast with the Côte d’Azurof the French Riviera. While never as famous as the Riviera, the Côte d’Argenthas always been something of a royal playground. The Sun King, Louis XIV, spenthis honeymoon on the beach at Saint-Jean-de-Luz, while Biarritz, just a littlefarther up the coast, was the Victorian royal resort par excellence. During thenineteenth and twentieth centuries, everyone, from the empress Eugènie andNapoleon III to Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, and the Prince of Wales, seemedto show up for the season.H. G. Wells made the small tuna-fishing town of Saint-Jean-de-Luz famous as aresort for intellectuals. It’s not hard to imagine the impeccable Wells and hiswalrus mustache ensconced on the long white beach, tuna nets strung from polesto dry in the sun while the boats trawl in the far distance, dictating TheOutline of History to a small army of assistants. Wells, Aldous Huxley, and thesmart young London set discovered Saint-Jean-de-Luz in 1920, and by 1923 or sothe luxury villas had spread as far down as the new Hendaye-Plage.37[36_endnote-title.html#aaa37] (See fig.1.6.)It was a few years after Louis XIV honeymooned there—around 1680, give or take adecade—that someone built an enigmatic mortuary monument in the parish cemeteryof Saint Vincent’s Church at Hendaye. The date of its construction, who or whatit was meant to memorialize, even its original location, have all been lost. Allthat is known about the Cyclic Cross, as Fulcanelli labeled it, is that it wasmoved from the cemetery to its present location in the southwest corner of thechurchyard in 1842, when the church underwent a restoration. Patientconversation with the caretaker yields the further information that the crosswas moved to honor the local d’Abbadie family, who paid for the church’srestoration.38 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa38]image [images/image47-00.jpg]Figure 1.6. Hendaye, on the Atlantic coast of southwest France and the borderwith Spain, lies in the heart of the Basque homeland.With this hard-won piece of the puzzle, we come at last to a solid historicalfigure with connections, in various ways, to many of the themes on the Hendayecross. The d’Abbadie family originated in the Bearne region of the Pyrenees tothe east of Hendaye and was one of the dominant families there up until theRevolution. One branch of the family settled in Dublin and became wealthy in theshipping business. The eldest son, Antoine, born in 1810, would return toHendaye and the Basque Pyrenees after exploring Ethiopia for the Frenchgovernment and restore the family to its former level of prestige. In 1842, hepurchased the arrow-shaped headland between Hendaye and Saint-Jean-de-Luz, paidfor the restoration of Saint Vincent’s, and moved the cross or had it puttogether.In the 1860s, after several more trips to Egypt and Ethiopia, including anattempt at finding the source of the Nile, Antoine d’Abbadie returned to Hendayeand hired the finest architects of the era to build a scaled-down Gothicchâteau. Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc, the architect behind the restoration ofNotre-Dame-de-Paris and many other Gothic masterpieces, did most of the majordesign work on the Château d’Abbadie. In the 1870s and 1880s, Antoine waspresident of the French Academy of Sciences and was a friend and supporter ofFerdinand-Marie de Lesseps in his bid to build the Suez Canal. He left thechâteau at Hendaye to the academy and established an observatory, dedicated tocataloging stars, to carry on his work. The catalog now contains more than500,000 stars.Antoine’s nephew Michel d’Abbadie and cousin Harry d’Abbadie D’Arrast carriedthe family tradition into new realms. Michel was a patron of the arts, and afriend of the early surrealists, including Marcel Duchamp and Max Ernst, as wellas a close friend and contemporary of Pierre de Lesseps, son of Ferdinand-Mariede Lesseps, the builder of the Suez Canal, and Pierre de Lesseps has beenmentioned as a friend of both Champagne and Fulcanelli. Harry’s friends weremore the film star and literary types. Both Charlie Chaplin and Ernest Hemingwaystayed at the Château Etzchau east of Hendaye in the Bearne. Hemingway evenmentions Hendaye in The Sun Also Rises, which was published in 1926, the sameyear as Le Mystère.39 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa39]In the end, it boils down to the reality of the cross itself. The familyresponsible for its erection has many connections, although indirect andcircumstantial, with figures at the heart of the Fulcanelli mystery. Could thisbe the solution to the riddle of why the Hendaye chapter was kept a secret?Would its revelation in the 1920s have pointed too directly at the real“brotherhood” behind the Fulcanelli mystification? Also, the castle inCanseliet’s fanciful trip to the Pyrennes sounds like the real Château Etzchauin Saint-Etienne-de-Bagiorry, which has curious connections going back to Gastonof Foix and perhaps even Nicolas Flamel. Could all the subterfuge be hiding, andat the same revealing, for those who can see it, the true source of Hendaye’s,and by extension Fulcanelli’s, secret wisdom?The cross sits today in a very small courtyard just to the south of the church.There is a tiny garden with a park bench nearby. Standing about twelve feettall, the Cyclic Cross of Hendaye looms over the courtyard, a mysteriousapparition in the clear Basque sunlight. The monument is brown and discoloredfrom its three-hundred-plus years. The stone is starting to crumble and it isobvious that air pollution—the cross sits a few yards from a busy street on themain square—is speeding its dissolution. The images and the Latin inscription onthe cross have no more than a generation left before pollution wipes the imagesclean and the message disappears forever.The base of local sandstone sits on a broad but irregular three-step platformand is roughly cubic (fig. 1.7). Measurement reveals that it is a little tallerthan it is wide. On each face are curious symbols (see fig. 1.8): a strangeshieldlike arrangement of A’s in the arms of a cross; an eight-rayed starburst;a sun face glaring like some ancient American sun god; and, most curious of all,an old-fashioned man-in-the-moon face with a prominent eye. Rising from the baseis a fluted column, with a suggestion of Greek classicism, on top of whichstands a very rudely done Greek cross with Latin inscriptions. Above the sunface on the western side is the figure of an X on the top portion of the cross.Below that, on the transverse arm, is the variation on the common inscriptionnoted above, O Crux Aves / Pes Unica, “Hail, O Cross, the Only Hope.” On thereverse side of the upper cross, above the starburst, is the Christianinscription INRI.image [images/image49-00.jpg]Figure 1.7.

(Photo by Darlene)Fulcanelli tells us that “whatever its age, the Hendaye cross shows by thedecoration of its pedestal that it is the strangest monument of primitivemillenarism [sic], the rarest symbolic translation of chiliasm, which I haveever met.”40 [36_endnote-title.html#aaa40]But what does the author mean by “primitive millenarism”? And how are thedecorations on the pedestal “the rarest symbolic translation of chiliasm”? What,exactly, is chiliasm?Fulcanelli provides some guidance by referring to the Fathers of the Church,Origen, Saint Denis of Alexandria, and Saint Jerome, who first accepted and thenrefuted the chiliast doctrine. Then he tells us that chiliasm “was part of theesoteric tradition of the ancient hermetic philosophy.”Chiliasm was a second-century C.E. Gnostic belief in a literal renewal of theearth after its destruction on the Day of Judgment. This transformed world wouldbe free of sin, a virtual paradise of sensual delights, feasts, and weddings, orso the Gnostic chiliasts preached. Naturally the more orthodox branches of theChurch found this threatening, although, as Fulcanelli points out, it was neverofficially condemned. In the second century, Origen, who is now our main sourceof information on the chiliasts, refuted the doctrine, and chiliasm slowly fadedinto the heretical underground.“Primitive millenarism” is an even more curious phrase. The use of the wordprimitive in this context suggests “prime” or “primeval,” definitelypre-Christian. The monument, then, not only is an example of heretical Christianbelief, but also somehow describes a primitive, or ancient, view of the end ofthe world. Fulcanelli underscores his point when he comments that “the unknownworkman, who made these images, possessed real and profound knowledge of theuniverse.”Thus, we are presented with a strange monument that describes both a hereticalChristian view of apocalypse and an ancient view of the same, apparentlycosmological, event. Also of note, Fulcanelli is implying that this concept is apart of the “esoteric tradition of the ancient hermetic philosophy.” In theentire literature of alchemy and its history, no one else has ever openlyconnected it with eschatology. On first glance, it seems ridiculous. How can theend of the world and the apocalypse be connected in any way with turning leadinto gold?As we dug deeper, we discovered that Fulcanelli had left us an important clue tothe big secret at the core of alchemy. We would find that alchemy had alwaysbeen associated with the idea of time and timing, and that, as Fulcanelliinformed us, chiliasm lay at the center of the idea of transforming time itself.We would even discover the simple and literal truth of Fulcanelli’s statementthat the unknown designer of the cross had real and true knowledge of theuniverse. From that knowledge, displayed by the Hendaye cross, we wouldeventually unravel a whole new perspective on alchemy, one that touches on thedeepest mysteries of magic, mysticism, and religion, and one that poses thequestion of extinction or enlightenment for the entire planet.A LODESTONE OF PURE WEIRDNESSAlthough Hendaye has grown into a good-sized resort town, the town square andSaint Vincent’s Church look much the same as they did in the 1920s and 1930s,when Fulcanelli and Lemoine the painter came to visit. Wednesday is still marketday, and the vendors of fresh fish and vegetables still line the square. Thepeople who pass by on their way to the square barely notice the nondescriptcross standing against the wall of the church. Cars park a few feet away, andthe everyday bustle of life in a French resort town takes place around it.Occasionally, like Monsieur Lemoine, a tourist stops to take a photograph. Theordinary tourist snaps his shot and then looks for a sign explaining what he hasjust taken a snap of. Finding no information except more curious images, ourtourist shrugs and later labels that slide as “Cross with angry sun face,Hendaye.”Standing before the cross, however, in the bright Basque sunlight on a busyWednesday market morning, we came face-to-face with the great mystery.Fulcanelli’s new chapter in Le Mystère was designed to link, uniquely inalchemical literature, chiliasm to the secret of practical alchemy and therebypoint directly to the real secret, the nature of time itself.Like a lodestone of pure weirdness, this juxtaposition of the end of the worldwith the transmutational process of alchemy attracted us to its mystery. Ourinvolvement began accidentally when one of us picked up a copy of Le Mystère ata yard sale. Over a decade later, the code was cracked, and, as the implicationsemerged, the mystery began to consume our lives. Other than validating theexistence of the cross, however, going to Hendaye and researching its historyleft us with few clues. The cross itself seemed to have almost no history, andother than Fulcanelli and Boucher, it is unremarked upon.But it does exist. And the symbols on it are just as Fulcanelli described. Couldthe cross at Hendaye really be a monument to the double catastrophe that will“try the northern hemisphere with fire,” as Fulcanelli insists?That blustery spring morning standing in front of the cross, we decided that itbrought into focus five categories of questions that must be answered in orderto evaluate its message. These are: 1. Is Fulcanelli telling the truth? Is there any connection, in history or tradition, between alchemy and such Gnostic eschatologies as chiliasm? And if there is a connection, how has it been maintained through the centuries? Is the secret really displayed on the walls of certain Gothic cathedrals? 2. What does Fulcanelli have to say about alchemy and the cross at Hendaye? Does that information shed any light on the connection between alchemy and eschatology? 3. What do the symbolic images and ciphers on the cross mean? How are they “the rarest symbolic translation” of an apocalyptic philosophy? And, most important of all, do they suggest a date? 4. Is there any scientific evidence to support the idea of what Fulcanelli called the “double catastrophe”? And does that evidence also suggest any insight into alchemy? 5. If this catastrophe is cyclical, what happened the last time? Can we find any proof?Standing in front of the cross at Hendaye that day, we realized the importanceof having answers to these questions. We needed information, solid facts, toresolve the mystery. We never suspected that once we had laid bare the meaningof Fulcanelli and the cross, the real work would begin.As we found answers, both expected and unexpected, to our list of questions, wefound that our subject was expanding, also in ways both expected and unexpected.We agreed that we would focus first on the meaning of the Hendaye chapter and ofthe monument itself. The history of alchemy would have to be included, wethought, but only to support Hendaye’s message. We had no intention ofattempting to unravel the ultimate mystery of alchemy itself, much less carryout an exhaustive examination of the contents of Le Mystère des cathédrales andDwellings of the Philosophers. We simply wanted to know if the things Fulcanellireported in the Hendaye chapter were true.Now, after years of intensive research, we can definitively state that not onlyis the information in “The Cyclic Cross of Hendaye” true but that it alsodemonstrates a sophisticated knowledge of galactic mechanics, something thatFulcanelli would have been hard-pressed to come by in the 1920s, but even moreso the designer of the cross itself, working back in 1680. The implications ofthis are staggering."},{"pageContent":"TWOTHE SECRET OF ALCHEMYimage [images/image23-00.jpg]THE ALCHEMICAL MEME AND SECRET SOCIETIESAt the heart of the alchemical mystery lies a secret. This is no ordinarysecret, however, for it is that which cannot be told, the experience of gnosis.Ultimately, this inexplicable knowing cannot be conferred or taught in anyordinary manner, only incubated and gestated through a mysterious process knownas initiation. This initiation can come in a number of ways, usually throughsomeone who already knows, but occasionally it occurs by means of sacred textsand direct insight.The alchemical gnosis has been transmitted from generation to generation,through thousands of years. We find the same content in experiences of gnosisfrom the modern samyama experiments at Maharishi University to the ancientEgyptians.1 [36_endnote-title.html#bbb1] We find the same content in spontaneousexperiences from mystics of all eras. The secret at the core of alchemy is anineffable experience of the real workings of our local cosmologicalneighborhood.So how can one incubate and gestate such an experience? The answer may lie inthe word transmitted. Modern sociologists have begun to discuss the concept ofmemes, or complex idea groups—such as monotheism and democracy—that appear tohave the ability to replicate themselves. Memes seem to have other properties aswell, such as an unusual psychic component. The spread of Spiritualism in thenineteenth century is a superb example of a viral-like meme outbreak, and tracesof Spiritualism’s meme can be found surviving into the New Age nineties, withits dolphin channeling and near-death experiences. Hollywood films such as TheSixth Sense are deeply influenced by Spiritualism’s perspective on theafterlife, conveying the meme directly and powerfully to millions of moviegoers.It helps to think of the secret at the core of alchemy as a very special andsophisticated variety of meme. Like a spore or a seed, the meme has a protectiveshell that is also attractive to appropriate hosts. In the case of the alchemymeme, that shell is the seductive allure of the transmutation of base metal intogold. Even if one absorbs the outer shell of the alchemy meme, however, there isno guarantee that the inner core will blossom and the meme become active. Forthat to happen, a series of shocks or initiations is required.The sophistication of the alchemy meme is such that the experience of gnosis atits core can be stimulated only by these shocks. Therefore, to transmit the ideacomplex of the gnosis meme through time requires a series of encounters betweenthose in whom the meme is active and those who have merely been exposed to it.From this need evolved the idea of priesthoods and then, as religious structuresdegenerated, mystery schools and secret societies. We can think of these asincubation devices for spiritual memes.Through the millennia, the undigested seed of the alchemy meme was jumbledtogether with other spiritual memes, creating a seemingly endless series ofhybrid spiritual expressions masquerading as alchemy. From its appearance infirst-century Alexandria to its modern expressions, however, the secret at thecore of the alchemy meme can be traced by its gnostic ineffableness. The secretprotects itself, but in doing so leaves an unmistakable fingerprint. Byfollowing these gnostic fingerprints, we can track the progress of the alchemymeme through history.EGYPT: ISIS AND HORUSThe word alchemy, as a name for the substance of the mystery, is both revealingand concealing of the true, initiatory nature of the work. Al-khem, Arabic for“the black,” refers to the darkness of the unconscious, the most prima of allmateria, and to the “Black Land” of Egypt. Thus, the name reveals the startingpoint of the process and the place where this science attained its fullestexpression. This revelation, however, important as it is, effectively concealsthe nature of the transmutation at the heart of the great work.For three thousand years or more Egypt was the heart of the world. Much of theknowledge that is the underpinning of Western civilization had its origins inEgypt. The lenses of Greek and Judeo-Christian “history” distort our modern,essentially European, view of the ancient world. The Bible gives us an Egypt ofpowerful pharaohs and pagan magicians, mighty armies, slaves, and invasions ofchariots out of the south. Herodotus gives us a travelogue, complete withinventive stories from his guides. To the Hebrews of the Old Testament, Egyptwas the evil of the world from which God had saved them. To the Greeks, it wasan ancient culture to be pillaged for ideas and information. To understand theorigin of alchemy, we must let go of the Hebraic and Greek bias and look clearlyat what the remains of the ancient Egyptian culture can tell us.When we do this, two things immediately jump out at us. First, the ancientEgyptians were the most scientifically advanced culture on the planet until thepresent day, if we have indeed caught up with them; and second, their science—infact, their entire culture—seems to be have been revealed rather than developed.The Egyptians claimed that their knowledge was derived from the actions ofdivine forces in what they called the First Time, or Zep Tepi. A group known asthe Heru Shemsu, or the Company of Horus—also called the Company of the Wise,the Companions of Horus, and the Followers of the Widow’s Son (fig. 2.1)—passeddown a body of knowledge through the ages. Each pharaoh, down to Roman times,was an initiate of the Company of Horus and thus privy to this secret knowledge.We can think of this secret knowledge as the core of “alchemy” in its broadestsense. But as we look closer at what the Egyptians tell us about their science,we find that it is based on an intimate understanding of astronomy. We also findthat it is coded into many of Egypt’s ancient monuments. These monuments, suchas the Sphinx and its temple, point to an even more ancient civilization fromwhich the Egyptians recovered their knowledge. In that sense, the knowledge ofthe Egyptians, of which alchemy is a half-remembered fragment, is the lostscience of the last evolutionary epoch. But if this is true, what happened toend this epoch?image [images/image57-00.jpg]Figure 2.1. The Heru Shemsu, or Company of Horus.In legends and in Plato’s dialogues we find a name for this advancedcivilization that was destroyed in a great disaster more than 12,000 years ago.The Egyptians told Solon of Athens that the ancient culture was named Atlantis.Little did we know, as we embarked on the search for Fulcanelli and the secretof the Hendaye cross, that the trail would eventually lead us to a place high inthe Andes that just might be Plato’s Atlantis.One of the earliest of all alchemical manuscripts is the fragmentary “Isis theProphetess to Her Son Horus,” found in the Codex Marcianus, a medievalcollection of Greek texts. This work seems to be a unique blend of Hebrewmysticism and Egyptian mythology that could only have come from Alexandria earlyin the first century C.E. In this seminal text, the Egyptian goddess Isis tellsher son, Horus, that while he was away fighting and defeating the evil one,Seth, she was in Hermopolis studying angelic magic and alchemy. She relates that“after a certain passing of the kairoi and the necessary movement of theheavenly sphere, it happened that one of the angels who dwelt in the firstfirmament saw me from above.”2 [36_endnote-title.html#bbb2] The angel isenflamed by sexual passion for Isis, but he can’t answer her questions aboutalchemy. He bargains on another encounter by offering to bring a higher angelwho will tell her everything she wants to know. The first angel shows Isis themagical sign of the higher angel. This sign consists of a bowl of shining waterand a moon symbol that resembles the emblem of the moon god Khonsu of Thebes.At noon the next day, the angel returns with the higher angel, who is calledAmnael. This higher angel also finds Isis desirable and is willing to tradeinformation. He reveals the mystery of his sign and then swears her to an oath.In this oath, we find echoes of the great mystery and one of the keys to itsexplication: “I conjure you in the name of Fire, of Water, of Air, and of theEarth; I conjure you in the name of the Heights of Heaven and the Depths ofEarth’s Underworld; I conjure you in the name of Hermes and Anubis, the howlingof Kerkoros and the guardian dragon; I conjure you in the name of the boat andits ferryman, Acharontos; and I conjure you in the name of the three necessitiesand the whip and the sword.”After this strange oath, Isis is told never to reveal the secret to anyone buther son, Horus, her closest friend. The knowledge will make them one—as theknowledge has now made Isis and the angel one (fig. 2.2).And then a curious thing occurs. When the mystery is revealed, it seemsstrangely flat, as if something was left unsaid in the answer. Horus is told byIsis to watch a peasant, who may or may not have been the mythical boatmanAcharontos. He is then given a lecture on “as you sow, so shall you reap.” Horusis told to realize that “this is the whole creation and the whole process ofcoming into being, and know that a man is only able to produce a man, and a liona lion, and a dog a dog, and if something happens contrary to nature, then it isa miracle and cannot continue to exist, because nature enjoys nature and onlynature overcomes nature.”3 [36_endnote-title.html#bbb3]image [images/image59-00.jpg]Figure 2.2. Isis the prophetess.Isis goes on to relate that she will now give Horus the secret of preparingcertain “sands.” She says: “One must stay with existing nature and the matterone has in hand in order to prepare things. Just as I said before, wheat createswheat, a man begets a man and thus gold will harvest gold, like produces like.Now I have manifested the mystery to you.”4 [36_endnote-title.html#bbb4]The instruction then passes to hands-on lab work in melting and preparing metalssuch as quicksilver, copper, lead, and gold. At the end of this lengthypreparation, Isis exclaims: “Now realize the mystery, my son, the drug, theelixir of the widow.”5 [36_endnote-title.html#bbb5]What are we to make of this strange story, with its curiously flat revelations?Possibly our very earliest alchemical text presents us with the same problemsand ambiguities that we shall find throughout the entire alchemical corpus. Aswe unravel alchemy’s secret, we shall return to the story of Isis and the angel,the origin of alchemy. But first we need to follow the trail of those who heldthis information, the latter-day Heru Shemsu, or the Followers of the Widow’sSon, Horus.THE UNDERGROUND STREAM: FROM EGYPT TO THE MIDDLE AGESAccording to Manetho, the second-century Egyptian historian, the Heru Shemsuwere the predynastic rulers of Egypt. The Builder Texts at the Edfu temple inEgypt call them the Blacksmiths of Edfu. They declare that all human knowledgecame from their endeavors. They invented the institution of kingship, and everypharaoh from Menes to the emperor Trajan ruled Egypt in their name. The wingeddisk was their symbol, and a special ceremony, “the Union of the Disk,” was heldonce a year in every temple in Egypt to symbolize the union of the state withthe source of Egyptian civilization.A multivolume work would be needed to chronicle the record of the Heru Shemsuthrough three thousand years of Egyptian history. The thread of the Heru Shemsuis clearly interwoven with the basic themes of Egyptian culture and the lostscience of alchemy. As the Builder Texts on the forecourt walls at the Edfutemple relate, the Companions or Initiates of Horus were the keepers of thesecrets of the Zep Tepi. We can even think of Edfu itself as a kind of timecapsule. It was the last major building project of ancient Egypt, finishedalmost four hundred years after Solon heard the legend of Atlantis, and waspurposefully decommissioned and filled with sand in the second century B.C.E.With the coming of the Roman Empire and then the Christian Church, the oldreligion and culture of the Heru Shemsu began to melt away. But it did notsimply disappear, for it was absorbed into the spiritual fabric of the new,emerging religions, especially Gnosticism, Christianity, and, later, Islam.Christianity in particular was aided in its growth by its similarity to the Isiscult that preceded it. Alexandria, one of Alexander the Great’s new cities,epitomized this new Egypt and became the center of learning in the lateclassical world. Alchemy, in its modern form, seems to have developed in itsworkshops and academies, as the Isis story from the Codex Marcianus shows us.The author of “Isis the Prophetess” was probably an Alexandrian Greek who livedsomewhere between 50 B.C.E. and 50 C.E. He was familiar with Hebrew and Persianmyths concerning angels, and, in the text, he seems to have been trying tocommunicate something very specific, like a recipe. Undoubtedly, he consideredhimself one of the Followers of the Widow’s Son, the Company of Horus.In another century or so, parts of this myth would become a Christian metaphor.Jesus would be cast in the role of Horus and Mary in that of Isis. As we shalldiscover in chapter 3 [14_chapter-title-5.html], the Christian version of themyth retained many nuggets of the alchemical tradition, particularly among thosegroups of Gnostics who insisted on direct mystical experience.The Gnostic Christians of Egypt were a powerful force in the early Christianmovement. It wasn’t until the fourth century, when the Church became an organ ofthe Roman state, that Egyptian Gnostic forms were driven underground. Untilthen, Gnostic ideas traveled throughout the Roman Empire, reaching as far assouthern France and the west coast of England. As Christianity became anorganized orthodoxy, these earlier forms were persecuted and Gnostic ideas beganto fade away.This Coptic or Gnostic Christianity of Egypt tried to retain the inner core ofthe ancient Egyptian wisdom while discarding everything that did not fit astrictly Christian mold. It succeeded enormously well, creating an image of theessence of the mystery of alchemy in the symbol of the rose cross.In the Old City of Cairo, originally the Roman fortress of Babylon to thesouthwest of Heliopolis, Coptic Christianity, and its Gnostic roots, survives tothis day. Now a part of the sprawling metropolis of greater Cairo, whichstretches from the Citadel to the Pyramids of Giza and from Matriyah, site ofHeliopolis, to Helwan above Memphis, the Old City is a quaint escape into amedieval garden. Walled on three sides and bounded on the fourth by the vastChristian necropolis, the Old City is an island of piety and mysticism where itis possible to feel that it is the turn of the second century and not thetwenty-first.On the walls of the Coptic Museum in the Old City, one can trace the evolutionof the rose cross through the first and second centuries. On one wall, afirst-century gravestone from Luxor (fig. 2.3), which contains the combinationof a chi-rho emblem and the ankh with the solar boat, sits next to ankh crossesthat blossom into roses on the loop of the ankh (such as that shown in fig.2.4b). By the second century, this had become the accepted rendering of thecross as a mystical symbol. In this we have a connection with the esoteric sideof the Coptic tradition that managed to survive the shift to orthodoxy. Theserose crosses traveled, along with Gnostic concepts, throughout the Empire.We find them in fact in southern France, in the crypt of Saint Honoré at Arles,as Fulcanelli reminds us in his discussion of the ankh.6[36_endnote-title.html#bbb6]image [images/image62-00.jpg]Figure 2.3. The motif of the sacred boat is one that echoes Hendaye’s moonface/boat. Note the chi-rho of Constantine’s vision and the Saint Andrew’s crosson the ship’s mast. First-century C.E. gravestone found at Luxor. (CopticMuseum, Cairo)As the ankh merges over time with the rose cross, the center of the ankh’s loopassumes the image of galactic center, a blossoming rose, the Templar cross, therose as a gnosis gnomon. A series of second-century altar fonts from Luxor,found on another wall of the Coptic Museum, reveals a thread of mysticalarchitecture that unites both the Gothic cathedrals and the enigmaticsixteenth-century credence of the Lallemant mansion in Bourges, which Fulcanellidescribes as a “temple in miniature.”7 [36_endnote-title.html#bbb7]Our first font (fig. 2.5), from the early second century, shows a scallop-shellarch supported by two trees, each with twenty-two leaves between, which stands aCoptic ankh with an eight-petaled rose in the loop. The basic simplicity of itssymbolism, as we shall see, survived for over twelve hundred years. Alate-second-century font (see fig. 2.6) repeats the basic motif and then expandson it to give us an almost complete vocabulary of the mystery.image [images/image63-02.jpg]Figure 2.4. A, the Coptic rose ankh developed from the chi-rho and ankhcombination (from the first century C.E., Luxor); B, shows the central pointbecoming first a four-eight symmetry (from the first century C.E., Alexandria);C, by the second century C.E., this flowering had evolved to sixteen petals(Luxor). In C, note also the triangle, where three leaves of seven points eachmeet in the center point, suggesting the twenty-two letters of the Hebrewalphabet and the twenty-two paths on the Tree of Life. (Coptic Museum, Cairo)In the center is our arch and scallop shell now supported by pillars rather thantrees. Replacing the rose-cross ankh in the center of the arch is an equal-armedcross with an upside-down alpha and omega in the field beneath the transversearms. On either side of the arch is an ankh with novel elements added. The loopof each ankh contains a five-petaled rose, while equal-armed crosses stand onthe top of the elongated side bars, the bottoms of which end in a five-sidedleaf shape. At the top of the ankh’s loop is a small triangle, or tetrahedron.Hanging from the outer edge of the arch are two bunches of grapes (See fig.2.6).While a complete explication of this altar font would take us too far ahead ofour story, let us note some of the symbolic connections. The arch is found onthe facades of the Gothic cathedrals, and is mimicked by the credence in theLallemant mansion that is discussed by Fulcanelli. The five-petaled rose is alsofound at Lallemant in the fifteenth-century stained glass above the altar. The Aof the inverted alpha matches the A’s on the Hendaye monument. By the earlythird century, as shown in the altar font in figure 2.7, the inner mystery hasbecome more abstract and orthodox. Instead of a flowering rose-cross ankh, wenow find a cubic cross in the place of our Tree of Life. Soon this image wouldbecome the chi-rho of imperial Christianity.image [images/image64-00.jpg]Figure 2.5. This second-century C.E. Coptic altar font, from Luxor, develops thesymbolism and numerology from the gravestone shown in fig. 2.4C. Note thetwenty-two leaves on each Tree of Life holding the arch.

(Coptic Museum, Cairo)As the Roman Empire fell apart in the fifth and sixth centuries, the variousunderground groups of Gnostic Christians were left stranded. Even though theGnostic centers of Alexandria and the East lost touch with the West, the WesternGnostic groups retained the symbol of the rose ankh, and over time thisdeveloped into the rose cross, the defining symbol of the underground stream ofEuropean esotericism. Fulcanelli’s hint about the rose-ankh sarcophagus lid inSaint-Honoré at Arles points us directly to the mid-first-century Christianityof Provence, and indirectly to the origin of the legends surrounding the HolyGrail.In the seventh century, while Europe was still in the Dark Ages, the breeze fromArabia, the new force of Islam, arrived on the scene. Arab scholars discoveredthe Greek knowledge that had been long since lost to the West. Jabir, the Arabphilosopher of the eighth century, collected the ancient alchemical wisdom intoa volume that became the cornerstone of all future alchemical research. TheIslamic Sufi alchemists of the tenth and eleventh centuries collaborated withthe Jewish kabbalists of Spain and reestablished medicine and philosophy.Drawing on these sources, Gerbert of Aurillac, who studied in Spain and wouldeventually become Pope Sylvester II, set in motion a series of events that wouldresult a few centuries later in the Crusades, the persecution of the Cathars,and the Gothic Renaissance. Those books in stone, the facades of the greatcathedrals, encapsulate Gnostic eschatology and hermetic philosophy dressedsuperficially in Christian myth as did the second-century altar fonts of Luxor.By the time of the Crusades, the Arabs were far ahead of the West. A few of theChristian Crusaders, including Pope Sylvester’s Chroniclers, were smart enoughto know this and learned all they could from Arab culture. Part of what theylearned was the secret knowledge. The Knights Templar, the military arm of theOrder of Our Lady of Mount Zion, became by the thirteenth century the mainguardians of that knowledge.When the Templars were destroyed in the early fourteenth century, the secret wasfragmented almost beyond repair. By the time the Rosicrucians appeared in theearly seventeenth century, alchemy, although still somewhat suspect in thecommon mind, had been accepted by the new scientific elite. In the next onehundred years, alchemy became chemistry and the secret knowledge became theproperty of the Rosicrucians, the Freemasons, and the occultists.THE UNDERGROUND STREAM: FROM THE BLACK DEATH TO FULCANELLIDr. W. Wynn Westcott, the medical examiner for the City of London from 1887 to1898, was a Freemason, an advanced Rosicrucian adept, and one of the founders ofthe hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, nineteenth-century England’s most notableoccult organization. He tells us in an 1890 lecture on alchemy that “it is nevertaught in so many words. It may dawn on any one of you—the magic event may occurwhen least expected,” thereby demonstrating that he at least understood thatthere was a gnostic secret at the core of alchemy.8 [36_endnote-title.html#bbb8]Westcott may be taken as something of an authority. He was steeped inRosicrucian and Freemasonic ideas, and, in helping to found the Golden Dawn,clearly felt he was part of some larger pattern or process.9[36_endnote-title.html#bbb9] His “flying roll” lecture is therefore of more thanpassing interest. It was given early in the organization’s history and waspresented to the group at large. We can think of it as a preaching-to-the-choirtype of exposition of the basic Rosicrucian alchemical tradition.The lecture opens with the assertion that alchemy means simply “the HigherChemistry,” which treats of “the essential nature of the Elements, metals andminerals.” This is a good and direct explanation for the ancient term alchemythat avoids the pitfalls of speculative philology, even if it is otherwiseunremarkable. The secret protects itself, but it is safe to say that thisstrange lecture provides an important cluster of clues and impressions withwhich to understand how the secret survived from the Templars to Fulcanelli.10[36_endnote-title.html#bbb10]Westcott quotes from an old French description of the sequence of the alchemicalprocess. “The Sun begins his special form of change in Leo in his own house . .. next Scorpio follows and the Work reaches completion in Sagittarius.” To makesure that we understand, Westcott insists at the close of his lecture: “toperform Alchemical processes requires a simultaneous operation on the astralplane with that of the physical. Unless you are Adept enough to act by Willpower, as well as by heat and moisture; life forces as well as electricity,there will be no adequate result.”11 [36_endnote-title.html#bbb11]The source for this secret would seem to be the Rosicrucian and Freemasonicmovements, which had swirled around Europe since the early seventeenth century.The late-nineteenth-century hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was a directdescendant of these seventeenth-century secret societies responsible forincubating the alchemical meme.Beginning in the fourteenth century, the Black Death ravaged Europe everygeneration or so until the late seventeenth century.12[36_endnote-title.html#bbb12] As Western Europe strained to deal with theseoutbreaks, the holders of the secret fragmented even more. At the turn of thefourteenth and fifteenth centuries, rumors circulated of individual alchemists,most notable among them Nicolas Flamel, and thus began an age of mysteriousstrangers dispensing alchemical wonders and then fading away into the night.Part of the secret, in those troubled times, went underground into chivalricorders funded and organized by some of the leading families of Europe. The courtof King René of Anjou in the mid-fifteenth century became a magnet for the lostfragments of the tradition. King René founded an Order of the Crescent based onthe mysterious martyrdom of Saint Maurice and the Theban Legion, which grew intoan underground stream of esotericism. The alchemical group in Bourges, as shownby the decorations in the Lallemant mansion, was active during King René’s eraand made history with the trial of Jacques Coeur, alchemist and royal treasureraccused of treason. This portion of the underground stream influenced the rulingfamilies of Milan and Florence, sparking the Italian Renaissance and inspiringgeniuses such as Leonardo da Vinci, Niccolò Machiavelli, and Sandro Botticelli.Out of these sources, and because of the new freedom found in the collapse ofthe imperial Church’s intellectual stranglehold and the rise of Protestantdissent, emerged an “invisible college” of esoteric thinkers and scientificresearch. By the turn of the seventeenth century, the times seemed to be readyfor a more public emergence of the secret.13 [36_endnote-title.html#bbb13]image [images/image68-00.jpg]In 1614, a publicly printed text appeared of an anonymous manuscript that hadbeen circulating among Europe’s intelligentsia for several years. It was called“The Declaration of the Worthy Order of the Rosy Cross.” Known by its first twoLatin words, Fama Fraternitatis, it revealed the purported existence of abrotherhood founded by one Christian Rosenkreuz, who apparently lived in thefourteenth and fifteenth centuries.In the seventeenth century the word philosopher was synonymous with alchemist.Here, with a vengeance, was a “new sect of Philosophers.” The Fama Fraternitatistells us of the search for occult knowledge by a man called ChristianRosenkreuz. He traveled to the Middle East—Palestine, Syria, Egypt, and NorthAfrica—and Spain before returning to Germany to found his secret brotherhood.One hundred and twenty years after Christian Rosenkreuz’s death at the advancedage of 106, one of the brethren discovered his tomb and his uncorrupted body.This was the signal for the Brotherhood to emerge and spread their message,hence the publication of the Fama Fraternitatis.Their message, of course, was nothing less than the dawn of a new Golden Age.The Fama Fraternitatis informs us that the Brotherhood possessed the keys to asecret knowledge capable of transforming society and ushering in a new era, onein which “the world shall awake out of her heavy and drowsy sleep, and with anopen heart, bareheaded and bare-footed, shall merrily and joyfully meet the newarising Sun.”14 [36_endnote-title.html#bbb14] This quote is taken from the nextRosicrucian production, the Confessio Fraternitatis, a restatement of the basicthemes but with a more direct emphasis on its revolutionary implications. Italso goes to the essence of the alchemical mystery.The Rosicrucians were alchemists, but the Fama and the Confessio are both highlycritical of the “puffer” type of alchemical worker who sits in his lab andactually attempts to get the mineral gold out of boiling lead. The FamaFraternitatis talks of “ungodly and accursed gold-making, whereby under thecolour of it many runagates and roguish people do use great villainies, andcozen and abuse the credit which is given them.”15 [36_endnote-title.html#bbb15]The Fama Fraternitatis implies that the Rosicrucians could make gold but foundthe higher spiritual alchemy to be more important. Higher spiritual alchemyrelated to the coming Golden Age and how to prepare for it. That, seemingly, wasthe intent behind the publications of the first two Rosicrucian documents: toprepare the world for the new era that was dawning.The third volume, however, was very different. The Chymical Wedding of ChristianRosenkreuz appeared in 1616 and is the only Rosicrucian document to be claimedby its author, Johann Valentin Andreae, a Protestant minister from Germany. TheWedding is full of occult imagery and surreal metaphors and describes ChristianRosenkreuz’s experiences as he observes a royal wedding.Like many alchemical works, the Wedding is filled with ciphers and greenlanguage. No less a mind than Leibniz, who along with Newton invented calculus,solved one of the ciphers. In the Wedding, the king announces: “My name containsfive and fifty, and yet hath only eight letters.” Leibniz correctly unraveledone layer of this mystery by using a simple Latin gematria, where A = 1, B = 2,and so on, to arrive at the answer of ALCHIMIA.The Chymical Wedding is an initiatory text, much like Fulcanelli’s Le Mystèredes cathédrales, which cannot be understood without the aid of an esotericgloss. After this strange work, the original Rosicrucians fell silent. It is notknown if they did indeed respond to any of the many thinkers, such as Leibniz,who sprang to their defense. We must assume that if they did, the secret waskept, because the movement continued.Westcott’s lecture serves as proof that Rosicrucian ideas retained theircontinuity through the centuries. This alone is impressive, but it is thecontinuity of content that strikes us most strongly. We can see continuity ofsymbolic content even in groups that lost the direct alchemical portion of thesecret tradition. Foremost among these are the so-called Freemasons.Freemasonry started in England in 1717 with the public announcement of the FourLodges at the Apple Tree Tavern in London. Something like these “lodges” hadexisted for centuries as guilds. These Freemasons were different because theyweren’t actually working masons but rather middle-class members of a secretsociety gone public. They claimed Saint John as their patron as they foundedtheir organization on June 24, Saint John’s Day, in 1717. In the next twentyyears, lodges were organized publicly all over the British Isles.The movement spread to the Continent, even as far as Russia, but it took theoration of Chevalier Andrew Michael Ramsay, given at the Paris Grand Lodge onMarch 21, 1737, to put the new movement into perspective. According to ChevalierRamsay, the Freemasons came not from the literal medieval guilds of cathedralbuilders but from the kings and nobles of the Crusades. They were not actualbuilders, but instead those who had taken vows to restore the Temple inJerusalem. These “Templars” formed an intimate link with the Knights of SaintJohn of Jerusalem. The chevalier Ramsay also announced that the order wasderived from the mysteries of Isis, Ceres, and Diana, an interesting claim inlight of Fulcanelli’s comments on Isis and the Black Madonnas of the Gothiccathedrals.As we shall see in later chapters, Chevalier Ramsay was reflecting a realhistorical tradition, although dressed up in Jacobin finery and strengthened byrumors of secret masters. The Rosicrucian imitators had popularized the idea ofhidden adepts, and the mysterious alchemists of the seventeenth century hadgiven it new credence, but the Freemasons were the first to make it an articleof faith.The idea entered Freemasonry directly with the Strict Observance of Baron vonHund und Alten-Grotkau, who once met a mysterious grand master and was told towait for further instructions. He waited for the rest of his life, but since theunknown grand master was actually Prince Charles Edward Stuart, the pretender tothe throne of England whose cause was crippled forever at the Battle of CullodenMoor, we can understand the lapse. This Strict Observance to an “unknownmaster,” however, would continue to influence Western occultism down toTheosophy and the Golden Dawn.There is no doubt that some of Freemasonry’s traditions and symbols were takenfrom the Templar tradition. The oration of the good chevalier demonstrates thatclearly, but by the mid-eighteenth century the movement had discarded thesecomponents and become a political and social organization. The symbolism of thetemple and the metaphors of the Masons who built it contained the kernel of thealchemical meme, but it is apparent from the lack of alchemical adepts among theFreemasons that the groups themselves did not have the initiatory shocknecessary to activate the meme.In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the secret began to surfaceonce again as advancing scholarship opened up more of the world and the past.Christianity had lost its appeal and its power, and in its place emerged a sortof primitive psychism—spontaneous and unorthodox psychic activity such astrances, visions, speaking in tongues, and so on—resulting in fundamentalChristian sects at one extreme and Spiritualism, communication with spirits andthe dead, on the other. By the late nineteenth century, Theosophy had revealedthat the mysterious masters were to be found in the romantic East, first inEgypt and then in India.Fulcanelli changed all of that. One of his main purposes in writing Le Mystèrewas to reveal many of the inner secrets of the original underground stream andto recover the history of the entire Western tradition.The cathedrals of France, especially Notre Dame of Paris, revealed that thetradition was alive and well in the twelfth century when the cathedrals werebuilt. Fulcanelli goes one step further and reveals that the cathedrals areevidence of the full flowering of the Western esoteric tradition in the MiddleAges. This idea, and the proof offered by Fulcanelli, is what really excited theParisian occultists of the late 1920s.Fulcanelli revealed to all who could see that once there was a great andglorious tradition in Europe that rivaled the traditions of the East. Thistradition understood and practiced the science of light, and this traditionunderstood how to communicate with the living spirit, or the intelligence, thatlives inside matter. In no uncertain terms Fulcanelli reveals that the secrettradition of ancient “Freemasonry” is exactly the same, at its core, as thetraditions of the East. Western culture dictated a different style of initiationand communication, however—one that was more active in nature and morescientific in outlook.In 1926, that secret was about to be lost forever. If it hadn’t been forFulcanelli and his book, it is possible that the true nature of this initiatorytradition would have disappeared in the West, perhaps never to be realizedagain. The shell of academic studies, and perhaps the isolated alchemist, mightpreserve the core of the meme like a spore, waiting for a riper moment to sproutagain, but the living current would have died away. In many ways, Le Mystère islike a message in a bottle from the last adept, dropped on his way out in thehopes that someone might follow behind.THE THREEFOLD TRANSFORMATIONBut what is alchemy? So far we have traced a channel of transmission from theCompany of the Widow’s Son to the Rosicrucians and Freemasons of the eighteenthand nineteenth centuries. The question then becomes: What were theytransmitting?The “Isis the Prophetess” fragment is in many ways the origin point of alchemyin its modern sense. It is the first text in which mysticism becomes confusedwith some type of laboratory procedures. In the text, though, it is clear thatIsis first imparts a philosophical understanding, and then she conducts aphysical operation, supposedly along with Horus, in order to demonstrate theprinciple and illustrate her mastery of the process of transmutation. We mighteven think of this as the alchemical method: revelation, demonstration, andtransmutation. The key, then, becomes the source of the revelation; where is theinformation coming from?In the Isis fragment, the knowledge comes from a higher order of angel, implyingthat the higher realm from which it comes is at least at a planetary level. Thehigher angel Amnael who instructs Isis bears the signs of Nut and Khonsu (fig.2.8) and appears nowhere else in Hebrew angelology. There is a faint resemblanceto the name of the angel of Venus, Hanael or Anael, but this line of conjecturequickly comes to a dead end, for if Isis is the morning star, is she learningfrom herself? It doesn’t seem possible.An easier solution is to take the name as it is, Amn-el, or the angel of Amon.Amon’s name means “the hidden one,” and Amon-Re is the name of the sun god ofEgypt. This meaning makes sense within the fragment’s Egyptian background, andthe angel’s name provides us with another deity to complete the divine triad ofancient Thebes. Thus, Isis learned the secrets of alchemy from a complex angelicbeing who combined the aspects of the star (the sky goddess, Nut), the moon(Khonsu), and the sun, Amon-Re. We have already seen this trio on the pedestalof the Hendaye cross.image [images/image73-00.jpg]Figure 2.8. Amnael is a complex angelic being combining aspects of the sun,moon, and stars, here the Egyptian Khonsu, Amon, and Nut. (Drawing by Darlenefrom images on the Karnak Temple at Luxor)The Hebrew spelling of Amnael’s name gives us a clue to the nature of itscomposite being. Using Hebrew gematria, the letters in the name add up to 123,the number of the three-part name of God, AHH YHVH ELOHIM. As shown in figure2.9, these three names are also associated with the top three sefirot on theTree of Life—Kether, Chokmah, and Binah. If we break the name into Amn and ael,we get the numbers 91 and 32. These are both references to the Tree of Life as awhole; 32 is the total number of paths and sefirot on the Tree and 91 is thenumber of the Hebrew word amen, AMN, and the word for “tree,” AYLN.The angel Amnael, a composite being, can be seen as the sum of all the knowledgein the revealed tradition. But before the angel will share the secret of alchemywith Isis, it swears her to a great oath. The first part of the oath illustratesthe creation of the Cube of Space. As we shall see, in ancient and occultsources the Cube of Space serves as a matrix for reality by organizing,geometrically, the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. And then the greatangel says: “I conjure you in the name of Hermes and Anubis, the howling ofKerkoros and the guardian dragon; I conjure you in the name of the boat and itsferryman, Acharontos; and I conjure you in the name of the three necessities andthe whip and the sword.”16 [36_endnote-title.html#bbb16]image [images/image74-00.jpg]Figure 2.9 The three-part name of God corresponds to the top three sefirot onthe Tree of Life.Hermes and Anubis are plain enough. Hermes is Thoth, or Tehuti, the god ofscience and magic, and Anubis is the jackal-headed god associated with death andfunereal rites. These two are also the gods who preside over the act of judgmentat the end of the world. The “howling of Kerkoros” suggests the Keres, thedog-faced Furies of Demeter, the Valkyries of Greek myth. Ker is “fear” or“malice” and koros can be rendered as “cross.” This means that the oath isconjured by the “evil cross” and the “guardian dragon.” The boat and ferrymanare the vehicle and the guide, respectively, and “the three necessities,” alongwith the whip and the sword, suggest Masonic initiations. The whip is one of theroyal scepters, the nekhakha, which, according to Schwaller du Lubicz in hisSacred Science, is an alchemical symbol for the three-part stream of being.17[36_endnote-title.html#bbb17]After this oath, or initiation, the great being tells Isis the secret: “OnlyNature can overcome Nature.” Isis later demonstrates this to Horus by means of aphysical process. The transmutation is successful, and she produces “the drug,the elixir of the widow.” From this, the pattern of revelation, demonstration,and transmutation, we can determine that the alchemical secret is threefold or,rather, that there are three transformations in one. The inner transmutation,revelation, involves the refining of the cerebrospinal energies and fluids sothat more light may be absorbed and transmitted to the DNA. In the Isis fragmentthis is symbolized by the sexual component. The outer transmutation, thedemonstration, is the ability to use those energies to effect transmutations ofphysical states, including the elements. The third transmutation is that of thequality of time itself, from the darkness of the Iron Age to the splendor of theGolden Age. Remember that Isis could not begin the process until the stars werein the proper place; time and timing are all important. All three transmutationsare aspects of the same process, “as above so below,” as the Emerald Tablet putsit, and are interconnected by the metaphor of “light.”TRANSFORMATIONS AND TRANSCENDENCEWe are now prepared to see the nature of the transmutation at the core ofalchemy. It is not only a transmutation involving a personal or local effect toour environment, but it is also global and universal, involving the nature andquality of time, and the times, in a unique way. Our earliest alchemical textconfirms this perspective. A big part of the secret involved time, not just thetiming of astrology, but time in the cosmological sense.As the alchemical meme was passed down through the centuries by various secretsocieties, such as the Company of the Widow’s Son, the information fragmented.In this way, some initiates received only the internal and transformationalprocesses without a full understanding of how the parts related to the whole ofthe ancient science. This lack of a cosmological component meant that whatsuccess was attained happened apparently randomly and without any guarantee ofrepeatability. The most guarded secret was that of time itself and its secretqualities. The secret of all secrets involved an experience of gnosis thatincluded the beginning and end of “time.” It is this revelation, thistransformative insight, that is demonstrated in the act of transmutation.Alchemy, the art of transmutation, is based on an understanding of the unifiedfield of matter, energy, and information involving an interlocking series oftransformations that demonstrates the identity of these three components of thefield. The key to these transformations is the ability to communicate—that is,exchange information—directly with matter. The mechanism of this communicationis the phenomenon of photon emission and absorption. Light, particularlycoherent light, can cause chemical reactions, and on the organic level it cancause profound effects, such as the process of photosynthesis, where the energyof light is used to build proteins and sugars.For the last twenty years, various molecular biologists have proposed andexperimentally demonstrated that all living cells emit a very weak photon pulsegenerated by each cell’s DNA. This pulse is regular enough to be considered aform of coherent light, and some researchers have speculated that bio-photonactivity is a form of language, a medium of communication. Fritz-Albert Popp andMae-Wan Ho speculated in a 1993 paper that this phenomenon “points to theexistence of [an] amplifying mechanism in the organisms receiving theinformation [and acting on it]. Specifically, the living system itself must alsobe organized by intrinsic electromagnetic fields, capable of receiving,amplifying and possibly transmitting electromagnetic information in a wide rangeof frequencies.”18 [36_endnote-title.html#bbb18]This idea is similar to the notion of morphogenetic fields first elucidated bybiologist Rupert Sheldrake. According to Sheldrake, biological entities have amemory that forms a field surrounding each entity. This field acts as ablueprint for both the species and the individual’s development, and issensitive to actions at a distance through both space and time. One aspect ofalchemy might be the ability to communicate with another entity’s morphogeneticfield. The alchemists believed that minerals were also living entities andtherefore they too had auras, or souls, that act much like morphogenetic fields.Such transformational communication was achieved in various ways depending onthe understanding of the operator. Success in creating the “philosopher’s stone”guaranteed success in the whole process. But the “Stone of the Wise” was not theend result of the alchemical process; it was merely a tool, or instrument,required to achieve completion of the process.The prima materia was likewise not just any matter, but matter that had beenenlivened enough so that it could retain the charge of memory required to effecttransformation. When this prima materia, this enlivened matter, is programmed orcharged by a communication from the philosopher’s stone, it becomes capable ofproducing a transmutation when activated. This transmutation, on one level,appears to be a geometric rearrangement of the elemental structure of thesubstance upon which it is acting. The geometrical arrangement that makes asubstance lead is transmuted by a morphogenetic communication from thealchemist’s philosopher’s stone into the geometrical arrangement that makes itgold.Could the alchemy of cosmological time be a geometrical arrangement of planetsand alignments to the fixed stars? The book Cymatics, by Hans Jenny,demonstrates the concept of how natural structures can be created and changed bythe wave patterns of sound. Jenny placed fine powder on a piece of material thatwas suspended in front of a stereo speaker. The videotape of the experimentsshows that the powder forms itself into different and intricate geometricalshapes based on the volume and pitch of a sound. When Jenny changed thefrequencies, the powders magically re-formed themselves into other geometricpatterns. Interestingly enough, Jenny found that there is an “in-between” statewhere the geometrical figure is reduced to chaos before it forms into a newpattern.But this is only one level of transformation in the alchemical series. There isalso the transformation of the alchemist as the body’s matter absorbs theenergy/information of the transmutation. Absorbing the light given off by atransmutation may have a direct effect on the operator’s DNA through the longsequences of nongenetic coding it contains. This so called junk DNA, whichconstitutes the majority of our genetic code, is divided between introns andextrons. From the research done so far, it appears that the extrons are verygood laser pulsers, giving off a weak burst of coherent light several times asecond. Introns seem to be reading incoming light, even on the skin, andadjusting indirectly various internal processes, such as the circadian rhythms.Indeed, changes within the operator are necessary to produce both the primamateria and the “stone.” In other words, both the alchemist and his primamateria are altered by the experiment.19 [36_endnote-title.html#bbb19]These are not the only transmutations involved. There are changes in the fabricof space-time itself as the elemental structure is collapsed and fused into anew geometrical configuration. These changes also affect society and the humancondition, promising a new Golden Age. At the heart of the secret is thepossibility of planetary transmutation. The final secret of alchemy lies in anapproaching moment of planetary crisis that is—perhaps—as Fulcanelli said, theend of the world."},{"pageContent":"image [images/image79-00.jpg]Finally, in the Ave Regina, the Virgin is properly called the root (salve radix)to show that she is the principle and the beginning of all things. “Hail, rootby which the Light has shone on the world.”image [images/image79-01.jpg]In this connection, Notre Dame of Paris, the Philosophers’ church, isindisputably one of the most perfect specimens and, as Victor Hugo said, “themost satisfying summary of the hermetic science . . .”—LE MYSTÈRE DES CATHÉDRALES"},{"pageContent":"THREEGNOSTIC ESCHATOLOGYimage [images/image23-00.jpg]THE GNOSTIC RETURN: ISIS AND MARY THE ALCHEMISTIn what is perhaps our earliest alchemical text, “Isis the Prophetess,” we finda glimpse of an ancient science. At the core of this science is something we canrecognize as alchemy, which emerged from the intellectual and spiritual fermentof Alexandria in the first three centuries of the modern era.1[36_endnote-title.html#ccc1] As it developed, it became part of the spiritualtradition of Gnostic, as opposed to orthodox and apostolic, Christianity.The word gnostic comes from the Greek word gnosis, which means “knowledge.” In aspiritual sense, gnosis implies a direct mystical experience of the divine, andsuch experiences were the province of many mystery religions. Indeed, earlyChristianity first appeared as a type of Hebrew mystery school. The Hebrewreputation in the classical world for possessing magical powers helped fuelChristianity’s expansion. In Egypt, Christianity was accepted as another form ofthe old Isis/Horus religious meme that swept through the ancient world twothousand years ago.As we saw in the “Isis the Prophetess” fragment, Gnostic ideas, alchemy amongthem, developed contemporaneously with Christianity. The earliest version of theEmerald Tablet, the brief second-century B.C.E. textbook of magic and alchemy(see appendix B [32_chapter-title-19.html]), was found buried with its anonymousowner at Thebes, in upper Egypt. It is a fragment of a basically “Gnostic”magical text. Alchemy represents a specific perspective on the ancient creativescience, that of the triple transmutation. In its broadest sense, Gnosticismrepresents the worldview that allows these transformations to occur.Alchemy texts of all eras show that time and timing are crucially importantcomponents in the alchemical process, but they do not openly link alchemy andeschatology, the end of the world. The link is there, provided as subtext, bythe Gnostic framework from which the idea of alchemy emerged. Only Fulcanellirevealed the secret: The old Gnostics were alchemists, and the alchemists havealways been Gnostics.At the core of Gnosticism lies a vision of the end of the world. Even beforeChristianity supplied it with a brand-new mythos, Gnosticism had developed itsown unique eschatological flavor. In a sense, like modern Christianfundamentalists, the Gnostics yearned for the end of this world.Almost every culture has some kind of catastrophe myth. Tracing these myths andstories, one finds similar motifs of cataclysm in such different cultures asInuit Siberia, Aboriginal Australia, Druid Ireland, and the Shumash tribes inNorth America. In many traditions, the disaster represents the fall from aGolden Age; in a few, the disaster represents the punishment by God formankind’s evil ways. Gnosticism’s peculiar blend of Persian Zoroastrianism,Hebrew eschatology, and Egyptian cosmology with Greek philosophical methods canbe seen as an attempt to synthesize all the ancient catastrophe perspectivesinto an apocalyptic unity.While keeping in mind that the label “Gnosticism” covers an enormous number ofdifferent and often contradictory belief systems, it is possible to sort throughits spiritual kaleidoscope and arrive at an overview of a basic Gnosticcosmology at the core of the meme. Gnosticism’s main tenets contain both goodand evil gods, and its basic approach is radically dualistic. The real forcedriving Gnostic philosophy was its sophisticated and experiential vision of theend of the world.2 [36_endnote-title.html#ccc2]According to the Gnostic myth, at the creation of the world the spirit of Lightwas imprisoned by the powers of Darkness. This light, the essence of God, wastrapped in human bodies as separate sparks of light, our souls. Gnostic sectsheld that the goal of human existence was to travel the path of return, thejourney of the individual sparks back to union with the original Light throughthe process of redemption. According to the Gnostics, this world and its historyare the works of the evil Demiurge. This is the false god, or the evil one, whobuilt this world as a trap for souls, or the light.As each soul is redeemed, it travels back to the source of the divine Light,which slowly, as more and more souls return to it, becomes whole again.Eventually, when all souls have returned, the physical universe, being nowcompletely without Light, will end. Given modern biology’s understanding of thelight-emitting and information-carrying ability of DNA, and such a system’simplication for the kind of holographic reality described by the Gnostics, suchan eschatology of light gains a new and more “scientific” meaning. In thissense, we can think of DNA as the small fragments of the hologram, containingthe information of the whole but constrained by matter, which it must animate inorder to return to the Great Light.Therefore, this “eschatology of Light” synthesized from Egyptian, Persian, andHebrew elements can be seen as the framework supporting a variety of Gnostictraditions. These traditions included the new messianic form of Judaism thatbecame Christianity.Indeed, the Gnostic sects quite naturally believed that they possessed the truemeaning of Christ’s teachings. Most of them did not believe in a literal Jesus,born of flesh and blood that suffered and died. To the Gnostics, Jesus was adivine messenger or an angelic being disguised as a man. He was sent to revealthe secret knowledge of the path of return, the way out of this world ofdarkness. In this view, Christ’s return will be not physical, but spiritual. TheResurrection becomes a metaphor for the experience of a spiritual triumph overdeath, and therefore available to everyone.The Gnostic insistence on a direct experience of salvation, a personal return tothe Light, contrasted sharply with the emerging orthodox position that held thatonly the apostles, to whom Jesus appeared after the Resurrection, could hold andtransmit spiritual authority. The Gnostics raised the ante, so to speak, byadopting Mary Magdalene as a kind of super-apostle.In the Gnostics’ view, Mary Magdalene, the sister of Martha and Lazarus, wasJesus’ wife. She was also the first witness to the Resurrection. The Gnosticsalso thought of Mary Magdalene as a source of the secret mysteries. Many of theGnostic sects held that Mary—mother, wife, and sister of the god-man—was simplyIsis, the Queen of Heaven. In Le Mystère, Fulcanelli draws our attention to thispoint when he informs us in no uncertain terms that the Black Madonnas in thecrypts of the great Gothic cathedrals are representations of the goddess Isis.This symbol forms the most significant link from Christianity to ancient Egypt.3[36_endnote-title.html#ccc3]As with the mysteries of Isis, early Christianity and alchemy were dominated bywomen. The most important of all the early female alchemists was Cleopatra,author of the classical text Chrysopeia, or “Gold Making.” In this work,collected with the “Isis the Prophetess” story in the eleventh-century CodexMarcianus, we find the earliest image of the Ouroboros serpent, biting its owntail (fig. 3.1). This symbol of the cosmic cycle is half black and half whiteand encloses a Greek phrase that says “The sum of all philosophy.”image [images/image83-00.jpg]Figure 3.1. Page from the Codex Marcianus showing both the Ouroboros andeight-rayed stars.Indeed, given what we now know of the importance of DNA in this theology oflight, the serpent biting its own tail is a powerful metaphor, a symbolic imageof DNA that, according to anthropologist Jeremy Narby, is produced by the“forest television” flow of images coming from the DNA itself.4[36_endnote-title.html#ccc4] On the same manuscript page in the Codex Marcianus,under a serpentlike crescent moon, we find a line of eight-rayed stars. Thisimage of the star is similar to the Gnostic ogdoad, a grouping of the celestialforces—the ancient Egyptian Neters—in an eightfold pattern.Reminiscent of both the ogdoad of Hermopolis, city of the god Thoth, or Tehuti,and the Gnostic systems of Basilides and Valentinus, the eight-rayed star wouldalso become the special symbol of Mary, mother of Jesus. To the Pythagoreans itsymbolized the regeneration of the cosmos, being, as Eratosthenes declared, the“double polarity of the elements, producing a stability.”5[36_endnote-title.html#ccc5] The seventeenth-century alchemist Basil Valentine(note the combination of Basilides and Valentinus in his name) claimed that theeight-rayed star symbolized the philosophic mercury and the completion of thefirst stage of the Great Work.The New Testament is filled with Marys, which causes considerable confusion.There is Mary, Jesus’ mother, and Mary, sister of Martha and Lazarus and firstwitness to the Resurrection, and Mary Magdalene, the woman at the well, and soon. Some of these Marys may in fact be the same person, as in the case of Maryof Bethany and Mary Magdalene. The Gnostics avoided the confusion by focusing onMary Magdalene as the wife and closest confidante of Jesus. According to theGospel of Mary, one of the Nag Hammadi texts discovered in 1947, Jesus taughther secrets that he failed to reveal to his apostles. Interestingly enough,several Gnostic sects, such as the Ophites, held that Mary Magdalene and thenoted first-century alchemical author known as Mary the Jewess were one and thesame individual (see fig. 3.2).Whoever she was, Mary the Jewess was an accomplished practical alchemist and theinventor of a series of technical devices still in use today, such as the hotash box for steady heat, the dung box for prolonged heat, and the double boiler(which the French still call a bainmarie). None of her writings has survived,but Zosimos and the other early compilers of alchemical texts quote her with theutmost respect. Zosimos considered her to be Miriam, the sister of Moses. Hewas, of course, as always, going for the most ancient tradition.6[36_endnote-title.html#ccc6]It seems strange at first to think of Mary Magdalene as one of the founders ofalchemy. Orthodox Christianity eventually became the only Christianity,obscuring much of the truth about the flowering of competing strains ofChristianity in the first century. Behind that efflorescence, however, lay theGnostic worldview, with its eschatology of light, offering a hope of return tothe divine source. It would not be too far from the truth to say that orthodoxChristianity was a political development designed to control access to thatspiritual reality—in other words, that it was a construct of the Demiurge.image [images/image85-00.jpg]Figure 3.2. Ophite Gnosticism worshipped the snake as a divine principle ofchange and transformation. In this first-century Ophite gravestone fromAlexandria, we see the snake entwined around a very phallic Djed pillar, orWorld Tree. (Coptic Museum, Cairo)And yet, the more one studies the Gospels and the early Gnostic alchemicalliterature, the harder it is to deny that early Christianity was an expressionof the same spiritual tradition. Christianity, once understood, becomes avehicle for an alchemical transmutation that also involves the end of the world.Only in the Gospels, and in other early Christian texts, are thetransformational processes of alchemy and eschatology portrayed as part of thesame seamless whole.THE ALCHEMICAL ESCHATOLOGY OF CHRISTIANITYAt the core of Christianity is a cosmological mystery, and our modern view ofthe end of the world is entangled with this magical mystery at the heart ofChristianity. To understand this mystery and its alchemical and apocalypticimportance, we must first look at how the Hebrew culture of Palestine in thefirst century came to develop its unique perspective on the end of the world.As their myths demonstrate, many ancient traditions were just as obsessed withthe end of the world as were the Hebrews. Flood narratives, such as that of Noahin Genesis, are common to many traditional cultures. The Noah story originallycomes from a Mesopotamian tale woven into the Epic of Gilgamesh. But the OldTestament is unique. Instead of treating its story as a chronicle, or acollection of myths, the Old Testament was put together as a way to demonstratethe supernatural intervention of God in the course of human affairs.The early books of the Old Testament display a kind of pseudohistoricalcontinuity, as if they were intended to make sense together, even if they werewritten at different times and under different circumstances. By creating theillusion of historicity, the passage of time is given meaning by its fulfillmentof God’s purpose. This sense of historical spirituality made the Hebrewworldview—and the Christian one that grew from it—highly susceptible to the ideaof an end to all things. If there was in fact one specific moment of creation,then it follows that there must be one specific moment of destruction orjudgment. By insisting that these metaphors were actual events, instead ofmythic patterns within a cosmic cycle, the Old Testament forces the divine intothe straitjacket of cause-and-effect history.This sense of historical unity, however, was itself the product of anapocalyptic event, the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in 587 B.C.E. andthe subsequent return of the exiles from captivity a generation later. “The Bookof the Law of Moses” was a combination of ancient texts found in the ruins ofthe Temple and Mesopotamian myths absorbed during the exile. This new versionemphasized the power of the Hebrew God to punish or reward His people. Thehistorical nature of God’s effort was not lost on the survivors of the exile whoheard this version of the “Book of the Law.”In addition to a new sense of God’s involvement with the workings of history,the exiled Jews added another element to their emerging religion. Whereas beforethe exile the Hebrew prophets had been mainly concerned with the social issuesof Israel and its relationship to God’s plan, after the return the focus shiftedto an even greater apocalypse, one of cosmic proportions. The Jews returned fromexile with new insights about their history and identity as a people as well asnew spiritual perspectives about such things as angels and the existence of aMessiah among them. But the most important of these new ideas was the convictionthat the world would end in a great celestial apocalypse.7[36_endnote-title.html#ccc7]The Old Testament prophets (the word prophecy comes from the Greek and means“ecstatic utterance”) appeared around 1000 B.C.E. as a type of monotheisticshaman. The nevi’im, or God-speakers, were considered, along with the priestsand the sages, to be crucial for the spiritual health of the Hebrew people.8[36_endnote-title.html#ccc8] There were great numbers of these prophets whoperformed frenzied rituals of dancing and chanting for large and enthusiasticcrowds, not unlike the rituals that once accompanied the state oracle of Tibet;both events ended with a prophetic announcement. Taking their cue from Adam andEve’s banishment from the Garden, as well as the Flood, the prophets soon beganto focus on the sinful nature of Israel and God’s approaching Day of Wrath.Amos started the trend around 760 B.C.E., which continued in increasing urgencyuntil the prophecies came true. Jeremiah, the prophet of the Babyloniancaptivity, around 600 B.C.E., was the first to connect the fate of Israel withthe ultimate destiny of the cosmos. He predicted that “the heavens will shudder”with pure horror at God’s punishment.9 [36_endnote-title.html#ccc9] For thosewho experienced the Babylonian captivity, it certainly felt like the end of theworld. What had been the essentials of God’s favor, a homeland, a temple, andthe right of kingship, had all been taken away and destroyed.Ezekiel, who was a priest of the Temple at the time of the conquest, marks thebeginning of a new strain of apocalyptic prophets. Like Jeremiah, he predictedthe end of the Israelite nation and the destruction of the Temple. Ezekiel useda variety of symbols—fiery wheels, dry bones, chariots, and multiheaded angelsof marvelous countenance—to create a surreal image of apocalyptictransformation. He brings together almost all of the elements used by futureprophets to describe the End of the World, and adds a few new ones: a king fromthe House of David who will rule all mankind; the idea of a purified elect whowill survive; and, most important of all, the rebuilding of the great Temple atJerusalem as God intended it to be. This image of a physical New Jerusalem laidthe foundations for the Temple imagery in the Book of Revelation and contributedto the Gnostic idea of chiliasm.But it was the Second Isaiah,10 [36_endnote-title.html#ccc10] acontemporary-in-exile of Ezekiel’s, who created the image of the apocalypticMessiah from Zoroastrian ideas. It was only during the period of exile that theidea of a redeemer entered Hebrew eschatology. The Messiah, as predicted byZoroaster (or Zarathustra), will come to wage war on the forces of evil andovercome the darkness. Second Isaiah adds to this vision the coming of amessiah, as Ezekiel said, from the House of David, who will be scourged andrejected. His message will be taken up more by Gentiles than Jews, but in theend the Jews will be proclaimed as God’s chosen ones. A new covenant will bedeclared and a new heaven and a new earth will be created. The wasteland will befertile once again, and the sun will never set.It was this image of the Messiah that informed the thinking and actions ofJesus. He seems to have designed his teaching experiences to meet theexpectations of Second Isaiah’s prophecies. And those around him, who thought hewas the Messiah, knew and understood these apocalyptic connotations.The common beliefs about the end of the world at the time Jesus began histeachings included several key components. The first sign of the end would bethe rebellion of Israel, God’s people, against the evil forces of Gog, the evilking of Darkness. Gog was identified by all as the Roman Empire. In the onehundred years or so prior to Jesus’ birth, several such rebellions had takenplace. One, led by Judah Maccabee, had almost succeeded. Every attempt at arevolt, however, only served to tighten Rome’s grip.Following the rebellion would come the Day of the Lord, the Last Judgment, themanifestation of God’s wrath on the wicked. Then the nation of Israel would bereunited and all the exiles would return. The dead would be resurrected so thatthey could experience the final stage, the reign of the Messiah in the newearthly paradise, with, of course, the divinely rebuilt Temple at the center.In this context, the role of the Messiah was simple. Defeat the evil king of theworld, the Demiurge, and usher in the Golden Age. It is difficult to knowexactly how Jesus saw himself against these expectations. No one recorded Jesus’teachings during his lifetime. For thirty-five years after his death, his ideaslived on only in the spoken words of missionaries and teachers. Jesus’ teachingsadapted themselves spontaneously to the expectation of their listeners. Paul,Peter, and the other apostles and Gospel writers adapted the teachings to thecommunities in which they lived and worked.To his contemporaries, Jesus appeared to be a miracle-working magus of a sortall too common in troubled Palestine.11 [36_endnote-title.html#ccc11] Outsiderssaw him as similar to other great magicians such as Apollonius of Tyana, whoalso had several Gospel-like biographies written about him. Galilee, Jesus’homeland, had only recently, in the first century B.C.E., converted to Judaism.It still retained a strong flavor of native paganism. Against this background,Jesus’ primary significance derived from his ability to work miracles.In the Gospel of Matthew, the Magi, Zoroastrian astronomers and philosophers,followed a star to Jesus’ birthplace in Bethlehem. These Wise Men wereprophetlike figures with distinct ethical and eschatological teachings, even ifthese are not evident to us in the Gospel reference. Jesus became a similar kindof wise-man figure, well known as a type in the ancient world, who taught of theKingdom of Heaven, attracted followers, and performed feats of magic. Thedifference between Jesus and, say, Apollonius of Tyana lay in his emphasis onJewish messianic concepts. Jesus declared himself the “Son of Man,” SecondIsaiah’s title for the redeemer, the suffering and triumphant savior.But the mystery at the core of his teaching, the secret of Christianity, was thenature and timing of the arrival of the Kingdom of Heaven. There can be no doubtthat Jesus left his early followers with the impression that the world wouldsoon end. His death and resurrection symbolized the triumph of the righteousover the evil king of the world, and his return would herald the beginning ofthe next phase, the Day of Judgment. He even declared that some living at thatmoment would still be alive when he returned.If the end was expected at any moment, then there was no need to record Jesus’teachings. After many years, when the return had still not happened, the oldermembers of the community began to record his teachings, and the Gospels camefrom these early sources. The Gospel of Mark, written around 70 C.E., used acommon teaching document, which has come to be known as Q, as the source for thestory of Jesus’ life. Matthew, the next Gospel to be written down, between 80C.E. and 100 C.E., used a similar technique and sources, but applied to them amuch greater level of understanding of the ancient esoteric tradition.Matthew gives us the most complete view of Jesus’ teachings on the end of theworld and the coming Kingdom of Heaven. Matthew was someone who grasped themystery at the core of Christianity, for it is from him that we hear of Jesus’Egyptian connections, the Star of Bethlehem and the journey of the Wise Men fromthe East, the Massacre of the Innocents, the temptation of the Messiah, and manyother stories with deep esoteric significance.The mystery is openly proclaimed in Matthew at the beginning of Jesus’ career.Matthew quotes from Second Isaiah: “The people living in darkness have seen agreat light, on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light hasdawned.”12 [36_endnote-title.html#ccc12] To fulfill this prophecy, Matthew tellsus, Jesus began to preach: “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.”13[36_endnote-title.html#ccc13]To see the mystery here a little more clearly, we need to step outsideChristianity for a moment and look at another Egyptian magical text, this onefrom the Paris Papyrus, one of the gems discovered in Egypt by Napoleon’ssavants. In papyrus IV, lines 475–830, we find a ritual to attain immortalitythrough inhaling light. The aspirant is first told to perform seven days ofrituals and then three days of dark retreat. On the morning of the eleventh day,the aspirant is to face the rising sun and perform an invocation: “First sourceof all sources . . . perfect my body . . . [so] that I may participate again inthe immortal beginning . . . that I may be reborn in thought . . . and that theholy spirit may breathe in me.”14 [36_endnote-title.html#ccc14]With this the aspirant inhales the first rays of the rising sun, and then leaveshis body behind and rises into the heavens, filled with light. “For I am the Son[of the Sun], I surpass the limits of my souls, I am [the magical symbol forLight].”15 [36_endnote-title.html#ccc15]In Matthew 5:14 Jesus declares: “You are the light of the world.” This echoesthe Emerald Tablet in equating successful transformation with the spontaneousemission of light or illumination (see appendix A [31_chapter-title-18.html].)The Lord’s Prayer, which appears in Matthew 6: 9–13, also suggests the EmeraldTablet (“on earth as it is in Heaven” and “as above, so below”). When theKingdom of Heaven is achieved, Jesus declares, heaven and earth, above andbelow, will be the same. Chapters 24 and 25 provide a blueprint for the comingapocalypse, telling us: “The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not giveits light, the stars will fall from the sky.” Jesus also tells us that it willbe “like in the days of Noah” before the return of the Son of Man, except thatno one will know the exact day or hour—no one, that is, except the initiated.Matthew 24:43–44 suggests that those who follow the Son of Man will indeed beable to calculate the time, and so will be waiting in preparation. When hereturns (25:31), he will separate the sheep from the goats, the subtle from thegross, on the basis of their compassion for their fellow men.In Matthew, we also find the account of Mary Magdalene’s witness to theResurrection, complete with its own light metaphor. “His appearance was likelightning,” we are told, and Mary does not at first recognize him.16[36_endnote-title.html#ccc16] Matthew’s account of the Resurrection ends withChrist’s ascension in Galilee and his pronouncement of the Great Commission, thelast line of which goes to the heart of the mystery: “And surely I am with youalways, even to the end of the world.”17 [36_endnote-title.html#ccc17]At the core of Christianity, then, we find a transformation that is alchemicalin nature as well as mention of the end of time. The Gnostics embraced a view ofChristianity that centered on knowledge of the path of return and ultimatetriumph over the evil Demiurge and his prison of matter. The hope they perceivedas being offered remains the promise at the heart of Jesus’ teachings. As theGnostics thought, the Messiah opened the way.And just as quickly, the Demiurge closed it again.REVELATION, THE ANTICHRIST, AND CHILIASMNot long after the Gospels were written, an author who identified himself asJohn, perhaps the same as the apostle John, son of Zebedee, recorded a vision hehad had while imprisoned on the island of Patmos, in the Aegean Sea. Eventually,John’s apocalyptic vision became the official and orthodox version of the end ofthe world, mainly because of his identification with the beloved apostle of theGospel of John. His revelation would become “the Revelation” as the apostolicchurch closed ranks against the Gnostics and the pagan Romans.The early Church had many different versions of the apocalypse, just as therewere many different Gospels. An entire literature of prophetic apocalypses haddeveloped since the time of Ezekiel and Daniel. Many of these texts, a number ofwhich were among the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are now thought to be the remnantsof the Temple’s library, have surfaced only in the twentieth century. From thesesources, we can see why the early Church, struggling toward some sort of unity,chose John’s vision as the authentic image of the end of the world.Jewish Christianity did not survive the destruction of the Temple at Jerusalemin 70 C.E. The Gospels, all written after this apocalyptic event, reflect aChristianity that had lost its local messianic roots and become instead auniversal mystery religion. The three so-called synoptic Gospels, Matthew, Mark,and Luke, were all composed in response to the central question of who hadauthority within the movement.18 [36_endnote-title.html#ccc18] The answer of theGospels is clear: Only the apostles and their spiritual descendants could claimlegitimate authority in the Church.Early in the second century we can detect the beginnings of orthodoxy. As theapostolic Gospels spread, an organization developed to look after the people.The priests who performed the ceremonies answered to bishops who were investedwith the authority of the apostles. The chain of command was very clear. God hadsent Christ, who had called the apostles. To them, He gave the responsibilityfor His church, and they in turn ordained the leaders of the individualChristian communities.The mystical aspects of Christianity, however, had spread throughout the Empire,blending with various other currents, such as the essentially pagan beliefs ofGnosticism. This created a vast Christian movement that was far from contentwith the simple apostolic interpretation of spiritual authority.19[36_endnote-title.html#ccc19] The Gnostics in particular insisted on a directexperience of Christ that was unmediated by any priest or bishop. Thisunmediated brand of Christianity was, of course, much more exclusive than theapostolic guarantee of instant salvation conferred by belief and obedience.Orthodox, apostolic Christianity became a mass movement in the late secondcentury, while Gnostic groups dwindled into closed societies of adepts. Othersalvationist religions, such as the Christian look-alike known as Mithraism,competed for adherents and imperial support. By 180, when Irenaeus compiled hisauthoritative list of books in the New Testament canon, with John’s Revelationas its official apocalypse, orthodox Christianity had solidified into a powerfulsocial and political force.20 [36_endnote-title.html#ccc20] For over a century,in the face of periodic persecutions from various emperors, the Church hadgained in strength and influence. The extreme persecutions of the early fourthcentury were a last-ditch attempt to halt the erosion of imperial and paganauthority caused by the growth of Christianity, with its appeal to God’sauthority as administered by the apostolic bishops.21[36_endnote-title.html#ccc21]The Book of Revelation had the authority of the apostle John behind it, as wellas a distinctive Gnostic flavor. John was the beloved disciple who sat next toChrist at the Last Supper. In the text, Christ speaks, through John, directly tothe seven churches of Asia, lecturing and scolding the Christians while warningthem of a coming period of persecution. And then, in a sudden shift of tone,Christ invites John: “Come up here and I will show you what must take placeafter this.”22 [36_endnote-title.html#ccc22] John ascends to the throne ofHeaven and sees the seraphim mentioned by Ezekiel. He also sees a lamb, whobreaks open the seven seals and reveals the future.This long, complex, and bizarre vision seems intended to encourage the faithfulin their resistance to the pressures of emperor worship. Some of the churchesthat Christ addresses through John were advocating a policy of compromise withthe Roman authorities. The emperor Nero was the “beast” in Revelation.23[36_endnote-title.html#ccc23] He was a vision of the Demiurge on earth. He wasSatan, emperor, and false god all rolled into one. Many of these Christians werewilling to compromise with the mad Caesar. This had to be stopped, according toJohn, because the final showdown between God and Satan was imminent. Satan, inthe form of the Roman state, will increase its persecution of believers, butthey must stand fast, even in the face of death. They are sealed from anyspiritual harm, though their bodies may suffer. They will, in any case, bevindicated when Christ returns to destroy the wicked.All of Rome is seen in Revelation as the Great Beast; the whore of Babylon andits emperor are the Antichrist. When Christ returns as King of Kings, he willlead the heavenly host in battle against the Beast and the kings of the earth.In John’s vision Christ wins and then rules for a millennium. This is the onlyplace in the New Testament where a thousand-year reign of Christ is mentioned.After this, Satan reemerges from his pit and challenges Christ. God sends firefrom the sky and Satan, the Beast, and the false prophet all end up roasting inthe lake of fire.This ushers in the final Day of Judgment. After punishing the wicked andresurrecting the saints, God decides to dwell among men and therefore creates anew heaven and a new earth, along with a New Jerusalem. There is no visibleTemple in this New Jerusalem and no need of the sun or the moon. The presence ofGod and Christ provides so much light that it is never dark. From the middle ofthe new city flow the waters of the river of life. On its bank stands the Treeof Life, which produces fruit continually. The elect will see the face of Godand therefore be immortal, reigning “forever and forever.”Clenthius, a Gnostic poet of the early second century, knew of John’s Revelationand wove it into his own work, now lost except for disapproving quotes fromOrigen on chiliasm. Clenthius gained a large following by teaching that themillennium, foretold in John’s Revelation, would be a physical earthly paradisewhere the senses “would be subject to delights and pleasures. . . . There wouldbe a space of 1000 years for celebrating nuptial festivals.”24[36_endnote-title.html#ccc24]Origen, a second-century Christian apologist, was the first important Christianto discredit the common notion of a physical paradise as the Kingdom of Heaven.He substituted a spiritual and personal kingdom for the literal and collectiveapocalypse described by John’s Revelation. Origen explained that the heavenlyfeasting prophesied in Revelation, and that so delighted the chiliasts, shouldbe understood as spiritual nourishment from Christ.But the idea of a physical New Jerusalem of gold and precious stones proved hardto displace. Chiliasm would continue to crop up around the edges of orthodoxyfor more than a thousand years. As we shall see, the idea of a physicaltransformation that accompanies the end of the world would become the innersecret of Western occultism. In alchemy, the process of transformation would bestudied in isolation, at least exoterically, from its Gnostic and chiliastorigins. Alone among all the alchemical authorities—with the possible exceptionof Dr. John Dee—Fulcanelli directs us to the connection between alchemy andeschatology.a [36_footnote-title.html#afn]The anonymous magician of Thebes, buried with his copy of the Emerald Tablet,was an early-second-century contemporary of the pseudo-Cleopatra and Clenthius.His wisdom papyrus would provide a much needed practical counterpoint to thelate-classical alchemical theorists such as Olympiodorus and Stephanus ofAlexandria. The seventh-century Stephanus, who dedicated his “Nine Lessons inChemia” to the Eastern emperor Heraclius, represents the dividing line betweenthe classical period, that of alchemy’s emergence, and the new world ofChristian orthodoxy. While Christianized Greek hermeticism continued in the Eastas a spiritual indulgence for mystical and scholarly monks, the tradition in theWest was ruthlessly persecuted.25 [36_endnote-title.html#ccc25] The Church sawit as irrevocably tainted with pagan ideals.Western Christianity, and even some of the alchemists, believed thatinvestigation into the hidden works of nature was sacrilegious.26[36_endnote-title.html#ccc26] It smacked of the forbidden fruit of the Tree ofKnowledge in the Garden of Eden, and was, after all, part of the illicit artsgiven to humanity by the fallen angels. Acquiring knowledge, like eating thefruit, allowed man to become more like God. If we are to believe the EmeraldTablet, then alchemy contained the very secret of independent creation.From this possibility, the later alchemists, from Olympiodorus in the fifthcentury on down, focused on the symbols of the Tree of Knowledge and theserpent, its guardian and initiator, as clues to the secret of creation. Part ofthis focus comes from the influence of Gnostic sects such as the Ophites, whoworshipped the snake in the garden as the author of wisdom, given to man inorder to free him from the domination of the Demiurge Ialdabaoth. Over time,symbols such as the Ouroboros serpent, with its motto of “the sum of allphilosophy,” would become the most cherished of all in the alchemical tradition.These symbols, however, certainly did not help the Gnostic sects survive theonslaught of orthodoxy in the fourth and fifth centuries. In fact, theyattracted the wrath of the reformers. In the late fourth century, the emperorTheodosius ordered the pagan temples destroyed. The Serapeum in Alexandria andits library of ancient texts were burned. Hypatia, the last great womanalchemical philosopher,27 [36_endnote-title.html#ccc27] was able to save some ofthe library, and for a while esoteric studies continued. Hypatia’s murder in 415put an end to all pagan learning in Egypt. The remaining scholars fled toAthens, where Justinian in 529 finally destroyed them.28[36_endnote-title.html#ccc28]As the darkness fell over Europe and the West, a brief hermetic Renaissanceoccurred in Constantinople. Some of the texts compiled there from the paganGreeks would eventually make their way to France, purchased by that enigmaticlate medieval king, Francis I.29 [36_endnote-title.html#ccc29] Centuries later,a young student of the art, Fulcanelli, would find these manuscripts extremelyvaluable. From them, we can speculate, he found some of the same symbolickeys—the serpent of wisdom and the idea of a triple transformation—that we havejust elucidated.The fragmentation of the ancient knowledge led to many dead ends and vainquests. The timing of the transformation became more important than thetransformation of time.CONSTANTINE AND THE ORTHODOX APOCALYPSEEven the chiliasts and other Gnostic Christians agreed with Hippolytus, bishopof Porto, who calculated the history of the world and found that Rome could onlybe the empire of the Antichrist. He thought that his calculations proved that acentury or so was left before the apocalypse. This was heralded as good news.The Christians had so far not been doing too well in their mission of convertingthe world. They felt they could use a bit more time before the end.30[36_endnote-title.html#ccc30]For the first two and a half centuries of Christianity’s existence, imperialRome had been the great enemy, the government of the evil king of the world, theAntichrist. And then, in the second decade of the fourth century, something verystrange happened. A would-be king of the world won a battle outside the gates ofRome and attributed his victory to the power of Christ. The battle of MulvianBridge made Constantine an emperor, and with him, Christianity became theimperial religion.This sudden reversal seemed truly miraculous to the Christians themselves.31[36_endnote-title.html#ccc31] The early years of the fourth century saw theworst Christian persecutions of the Roman era. Even bishops of the Church wereforced to renounce their faith.32 [36_endnote-title.html#ccc32] Christianity hadbegun to disappear in large portions of the eastern empire. In the West, thepersecutions had actually served to increase the number of Christians.Constantine used this fact as a political tool. At Mulvian Bridge, hisconvenient espousal of Christianity was worth a dozen legions, he later remarkedto Eusebius, his biographer.33 [36_endnote-title.html#ccc33]Flavius Valerius Constantinus, or Constantine, was an imperial freebooter in thegrand tradition of Julius Caesar and Octavius Augustus. Born the son of one ofthe four imperial “Caesars” appointed by the last great pagan emperor,Diocletian, Constantine plowed his way through the political intrigue thatresulted from Diocletian’s abdication in 305. On the afternoon of October 27,312, Constantine trapped his last opponent, the Christian-hating Maxentius,against the Tiber at Saxa Rubra (Red Rocks) with only one avenue of escape, overMulvian Bridge.In effect, this battle decided the fate of both the Empire and Christianity,which had become inextricably entwined. While positioning his legions on theafternoon before the battle, Constantine saw a vision of a great flaming crossin the sky with the Greek words en toutoi nika, “in this sign, victory.” Thatnight, he dreamt that Christ appeared and commanded him to make the flamingcross his battle standard. Constantine awoke and called for his metalsmiths. Hetold them his dream and ordered them to prepare a new standard, one composed ofthe first two Greek letters in the name Christ, chi, Χ, superimposed on a rho,Ρ, as seen in figures 3.3a and 3.3b.Under this new standard, Constantine’s army drove Maxentius’s legions into theTiber, where most of them died. Constantine entered Rome and was proclaimedemperor of the West. Gog, of Gog and Magog, the evil rulers of the worldaccording to Hebrew eschatology, was now at least nominally a Christian.Soon after his victory, in early 313, Constantine met with the Eastern emperor,Lucinius, and issued an edict confirming the religious toleration proclaimed byone of the earlier “Caesars,” or tetrachs, of Diocletian and expanded it toinclude all religions, even Christianity. This was the end of the greatpersecutions and the beginning of the meteoric rise in the fortunes of orthodoxChristianity. By 323, Constantine had finally united, by conquest, both halvesof the empire. He soon moved the capital to Byzantium, later to become known asConstantinople. Orthodox Christianity had become the official religion of thestate.image [images/image97-00.jpg]Figure 3.3. A, The chi-rho symbol Constantine saw in the sky and adopted as hisbattle standard; B, note the similarity to this Coptic altar font fromsecond-century Luxor. (Coptic Museum, Cairo)Constantine, guided by his vision, chose the winning side. It was the Church’sinsistence on obedience and conformity that appealed to Constantine. He needed anew form of universal religion with which to unify his vast empire, andChristianity filled the bill nicely.But almost as soon as Constantine embraced orthodoxy, it was threatened by themost challenging heresy in the history of the Church.34[36_endnote-title.html#ccc34] A pious and ascetic Egyptian priest by the name ofArius startled his bishop with his unorthodox opinions about the nature ofChrist. Arius argued that Christ could not be one with the Creator, but wasrather the Logos, the first and best of all created beings.35[36_endnote-title.html#ccc35] Since Christ had lived in time—that is, been born,lived, and died—he could not be coeternal with God. A creation had occurredsomewhere, and therefore Christ was not the same substance as his Father. TheHoly Spirit, Arius insisted, was even less God than Christ, since it was acreation of Christ’s, and therefore twice removed from the substance of God.36[36_endnote-title.html#ccc36]Bishop Alexander called a council and excommunicated Arius and his followers.This created such widespread religious turmoil that Constantine himself had tostep in and settle it. In a letter to both sides, Constantine declared that thedispute was “trifling and unworthy of such fierce contests.”37[36_endnote-title.html#ccc37] But the Church did not see it that way. To theChurch, the matter of consubstantiality versus similarity, a matter of an iotain the Greek words homoousia and homoiousia, was vital both politically andtheologically. If Christ was not seen as God, the whole structure of theorthodox chain of command would crumble. And if anything happened to the unityof the Church, its usefulness to the imperial state would vanish. Settling thisissue became a matter of life and death for the new imperial orthodoxy.Constantine resolved to end the dispute by calling the first ecumenical, oruniversal, Church Council at Nicaea in 325. Constantine presided in person overthe debates and according to Eusebius “moderated the violence of the contendingparties.”38 [36_endnote-title.html#ccc38] Arius presented his view, butAthanasius, the hired theological gunslinger brought in by Bishop Alexander,made it absolutely clear that if Christ and the Holy Spirit were not consideredthe same substance as God, then polytheism would triumph. With that, the bishopsfolded and agreed on a new universal creed that declared the Trinity to be ofone essence—that is, of the same substance.Unity was enforced by banishment and anathema. The imperial church thus embarkedon its own pattern of persecution. All books by or about Arius were burned. Byimperial decree, concealment of such a book was punishable by death. The DarkAges had begun.Constantine, the most nominal of Christians and a good candidate for theAntichrist, became instead the new Christ-model of the imperial church, theChristos Pantocrator, Christ the Ruler of the Universe. The Demiurge had becomethe Messiah and a thousand and more years of spiritual oppression andpersecution lay ahead. The end of the world had become an institution of theChurch, both as a doctrine and as an inquisitional practice."},{"pageContent":"FOURTHE ANCIENT ILLUMINATED ASTRONOMYimage [images/image100-00.jpg]HEBREW ILLUMINISMIn the divinely rebuilt New Jerusalem, as described in Revelation 21 and 22, theTree of Life will stand on the banks of the river of the waters of life. Thissuggests that the new heaven and the new earth, promised to John in the Book ofRevelation, would, in fact, be a literal return to the Garden of Paradise. Thechiliasts thought so. They saw in this divine re-creation a chance to indulge inthe innocent joys of a purified humanity. They quite naturally assumed that,since the re-created paradise had no Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil—theoriginal cause of the fall of man into sinfulness— there could be no such thingas sin in the New Jerusalem.Origen and the other fathers of the early Church disliked this interpretation.1[36_endnote-title.html#ddd1] But even they could not completely remove the ideaof a transformed reality, complete with a transformed body, from the orthodoxeschatology. The Gnostic view was that matter could be redeemed, or animated, byan apocalyptic event. The apocalypse, then, was a chance for the sparks of lightto return to the Light. This Gnostic concept remained at the heart of theofficial orthodox apocalypse.2 [36_endnote-title.html#ddd2]Christianity emerged from the political turmoil of first-century Palestine,which was a truly apocalyptic moment in Jewish history. Christianity did notbecome a universalist religion until after the “end of the world” for the Jews,which occurred six and half centuries to the day after Nebuchadnezzar’s armiesdestroyed Solomon’s Temple when Roman forces under the soon-to-be-emperor Titussacked and burned the Temple of Herod and drove the Jews from Israel. This wasan end of the world far greater than the Babylonian captivity. Cyrus the Greatallowed the Jews to return from Babylon after a generation or so. The NewBabylon on the Tiber, Rome, never allowed the Jews to return. One thousand eighthundred and seventy-eight years, and many more apocalypses, would pass before aJewish nation returned to Palestine.We saw how Christianity slowly became an orthodoxy and then, miraculously, theimperial religion of the hated Romans. By the late sixth century, when theChurch was firmly in the driver’s seat of the Roman military machine, Judaismwas the only tolerated nonorthodox form of religion. This does not mean that theRoman Christians saw the Jews as equals—it was against the law to intermarry andfor Jews to own real property such as land—but they were at least accepted asserving one useful function in society, that of scapegoats. Since the Christianscould no longer blame the Romans for Christ’s death, the blame shifted to theJews. This created the basic rationalization for one thousand years of Christianpersecution. The origin of anti-Semitism lies in the Church’sinstitutionalization of the apocalypse.3 [36_endnote-title.html#ddd3]After the fall of the Temple in 70 C.E., the largest Jewish communities werecentered in Alexandria in Egypt and the old city of Babylon, in Mesopotamia.Judaism was probably saved by the actions of Rabbi Johanen ben Zakkai, who hadhimself smuggled out of Jerusalem during the siege. A few Jewish communitiesremained in Palestine, most notably the spiritual community at Safed, nearpresent-day Tel Aviv, on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean. The mysticalJews of Safed would retain their foothold in the Holy Land right down to thetwentieth century.Unlike Christianity, which renounced its mystical origins as heresy, Judaismretained a powerful connection with its mystical roots. Our earliest alchemicaltext, “Isis the Prophetess to Her Son Horus,” points to an Egypto-Hebraic sourcefor its transformational philosophy. Interestingly enough, a Hebrew contemporaryof the author of the “Isis the Prophetess” story, Rabbi Nehuniah ben HaKana,revealed to his students the magical technology behind these transformationalprocesses. In the later centuries of the Diaspora, his teachings would form thebasis of the traditional Kabbalah.Compared to the anonymous author of “Isis the Prophetess,” Rabbi Nehuniah benHaKana was a well-known and respected Jewish sage who had studied with RabbiJohanen ben Zakkai. The few times his name is mentioned in the Talmud leave nodoubt about the important position he occupied in the early Talmudic era; hismystical teachings inspired a whole generation of Jewish sages. From theperspective of our inquiry into the origins of alchemy, however, his importancelies in his authorship of the teaching document known as the Bahir.The oldest and most influential of all kabbalistic texts, the Bahir, or“Illumination” (from Job 37:21—”And now they do not see light, it isillumination [bahir] in the skies,”) was also called the “Midrash of RabbiNehuniah,” to emphasize his authorship.4 [36_endnote-title.html#ddd4] This isunusual, since Rabbi Nehuniah is quoted only once, in the first verse. A RabbiAmorai, however, perhaps a pseudonym for Rabbi Nehuniah, is cited nine times.The word amorai means “speakers” and indicates that he was the spokesman for acommittee or group of sages. If this was Rabbi Nehuniah, then he was speakingfor the whole tradition as well as his immediate group.Although the Bahir is the primary text of the Kabbalah, it does not use thatterm. The word kabbalah, from the Hebrew root QBL, meaning “received” or“given,” came into fashion much later, when the teachings of the first-centurymystics were indeed just “received traditions.” The sages of the Bahir preferredthe more ancient term Maaseh Merkabah, literally “Workings of the Chariot.”5[36_endnote-title.html#ddd5] The name connotes an active mystical experience asopposed to a received tradition. The Bahir combines the ideas of the work ofcreation, the animating of matter, with the radical concept of a celestialprojection as a way to return to the divine source. By juxtaposing these ideas,the Bahir brings us closer to the secret at the heart of alchemy.THE TELI, THE CYCLE, AND THE HEART: SERPENTS IN THE SKYThe key concept at the heart of Kabbalah is the Tree of Life, the Etz Chaim,which is described in kabbalistic creation texts such as the Sefer Yetzirah. Asshown in figure 4.1, the Tree of Life is a diagram that pictures reality as theintersection of four great realms or levels of abstraction.A geometric pattern emerges from the intersecting lines of the Tree like a moirépattern in a holographic projection. Figure 4.2 shows twenty-two paths,processes, or states of becoming connecting ten localities, spheres, or sefirot.The entire diagram was thought to describe the nature of creation, God’sartistic technique, if you will. But its true importance to the sages was itsapplication to the human condition.image [images/image103-00.jpg]Figure 4.1. The Tree of Life formed from the overlapping of four circles orspheres of abstraction.As God is supposed to have made man in his image and likeness, so man wasthought to contain, in microcosm, the entire Tree of Life. Some medievalKabbalists used the concepts in the Sefer Yetzirah to create an artificial formof life known as the golem, according to the legends about this being fromPrague and Warsaw. To Western esotericists, the Tree of Life functioned muchlike the kundalini diagrams of the Hindu mystics. By mapping the internal powercenters, and then projecting outward and aligning them with the forces ofnature, the magician sought to reenact the process of creation and so become,with God, a co-creator of the universe.The sefirot and the paths are arranged in a few basic patterns (see fig. 4.3).The top three sefirot, Kether, Chokmah, and Binah (Crown, Wisdom, andUnderstanding), form a triangular motif that is then inverted and projecteddownward through the pattern. The first inverted triangle, Chesed, Gevurah, andTiferet (Mercy, Strength, and Beauty), is repeated by the third and lasttriangle, Netzach, Hod, and Yesod (Victory, Splendor, and Foundation). The wholepattern is then resolved by, and enfolded into, the last sefirah, Malkuth(Kingdom).image [images/image104-00.jpg]Figure 4.2. The complete Tree of Life, showing the twenty-two paths and theplanetary relationships of the sefirot. (Drawing by Darlene from the HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn)image [images/image105-00.jpg]Figure 4.3. The threefold pattern on the Tree.Each of these triangular patterns represents one of the realms or levels ofabstraction. The repetition of the pattern also creates three columns or pillarson the Tree, as shown in figure 4.4. From left to right, the three columns areMercy, Transformation (note that this column connects Kether with Malkuth,heaven to earth), and Severity. These repetitions of three can also be seen asthe three persons of the trinity, the law of threes, and the dialectical trio ofthesis, antithesis, and synthesis.The Bahir adds that portions of the celestial sphere can be equated with thespheres of each sefirah, or globe, on the Tree of Life. In verse 179 of theBahir we learn that our physical world “is like a mustard seed in a ring.” In asphere around the ring are the ten spheres and their animating statements, tentimes the phrase “And God said . . .” is used in Genesis, which verse 179locates in space around a center point, supposedly the mustard seed.6[36_endnote-title.html#ddd6]image [images/image106-00.jpg]Figure 4.4. The three pillars on the Tree.We learned that there are Ten Spheres and Ten Sayings. Each sphere has itssaying. It is not surrounded by it, but rather, it surrounds it. This [physical]world is like a mustard seed inside a ring. Why? Because of the Spirit thatblows upon it, through which it is sustained. If this spirit were to beinterrupted for even a moment, the world would be annihilated.7[36_endnote-title.html#ddd7]This, of course, suggests the parable of the mustard seed found in Matthew13:31–33 and Mark 4:30–32: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which aman took and planted in his field. Though it was the smallest of seeds, yet whenit grows it becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and perch in itsbranches.” In Matthew, Jesus goes on to relate the parable of the yeast, ametaphor for the kingdom of heaven as a transformative force that spreadsthroughout all matter. Matthew ends the section with another quote from Psalms,explaining why Jesus spoke in parables: “I will open my mouth in parables. Iwill utter things hidden since the creation of the world.”8[36_endnote-title.html#ddd8]Verses 63, 95, and 106 of the Bahir describe the Tree that grows from thismustard seed in terms of the ancient ideas later written down in the SeferYetzirah and the Sefer Zohar, two books that are part of the Hebrew kabbalistictradition.9 [36_endnote-title.html#ddd9] We must remember that works such as theBahir were written for the initiated few; if we take them literally, we are sureto misunderstand their meaning.63: The heart [lev] is thirty-two. These are concealed, and with them the worldwas created. What are these 32? He said: These are the 32 paths. . . .95: The Blessed Holy One has a single Tree and it has twelve diagonalboundaries. . . . They continually spread forever and ever; they are the “armsof the world.” . . .106: Rabbi Berachiah sat and expounded: What is the Axis [teli]? This is thelikeness that I saw before the Blessed One. . . . What is the Sphere? That isthe Womb. What is the heart? It is that regarding which it has been written“unto the heart of heaven.” In it are included the 32 mystical paths ofwisdom.10 [36_endnote-title.html#ddd10]These verses from the Bahir make the pitfall of literality quite apparent.Attributed to Rabbi Amorai, the spokesman for the Bahir tradition as a whole,verse 95 reveals the structure of the Cube of Space and the jewel of thecelestial Tree within it. This cubic structure, “the arms of the world,” isbased on the ancient concepts of the axis, the sphere, and the heart. If we knowthe secret of their meaning, then this is one of the most straightforward versesin the Bahir. Without the key, however, it is merely an incomprehensible stringof numbers. The very secret of alchemy lies in the symbolic images of the axis,the sphere, and the heart, which are an ancient, perhaps even pre-catastrophe,astronomical description of the cosmic mill.The first three verses of the sixth chapter of Rabbi Akiva’s Sefer Yetzirahsupply the key to this astronomical gnosis, although in an oblique fashion. Thefirst verse informs us that as proof of the existence of the Tree of Life, thetwelve, the seven, and the three, “He set them in the Teli, the Cycle and theHeart.”These are Three Mothers . . . And seven planets and their hosts, and twelvediagonal boundaries a proof of this true witness in the Universe, Year, Soul anda rule of twelve and seven and three: He set them in the Teli, the cycle and theHeart.11 [36_endnote-title.html#ddd11]The secret lies in the mysterious word teli. It occurs in neither the Torah northe Talmud, although it is used in the Bahir. There is considerable disputeamong scholars as to its precise meaning. The only similar word in the Bible isa single reference to some kind of weapon in Genesis.12[36_endnote-title.html#ddd12] Apparently, from the root of the word talah, “tohang,” it could have been some kind of bolo, or a weight suspended on a rope forthrowing. This reading suggests that the Bahir is talking about the celestialaxis around which the heavens rotate, a kind of imaginary string from which thecelestial globe hangs, as well as a point around which the weight orbits as thebolo is swung.But what is the string connected to? An ancient midrash, “The Prayers of Rabbi‘In The Beginning,’ ” tells us that it “hangs [by a thread] from the fin of theLeviathan.” This ancient serpent can only be the constellation Draco, the PoleSerpent mentioned in Job 26:13, “By His Spirit the heavens were calmed, His handpierced the Pole Serpent,” and in Second Isaiah 27:1, “On that day [the Day ofJudgment] with His great sharp sword, God will visit and overcome the Leviathan,the Pole Serpent, and the Leviathan, the Coiled Serpent, and He will kill thedragon of the sea.” It is important to note that three such dragons arementioned here.To understand these words, we must look up at the stars. We can all find thePole Star, Polaris, in the tail of Ursa Minor, the Little Bear. This marks ourNorth Celestial Pole, directly above the North Pole of our planet. There isanother pole in the sky, however, and that is the pole of the ecliptic, the pathof the sun as it passes through the zodiac. The earth’s axis is tilted at 23.5degrees away from the ecliptic. This tilt causes the celestial pole above ourplanetary pole to describe a great circle in the sky over long periods of time.For example, in 4500 B.C.E., Thuban, a star in the tail of Draco, marked theNorth Celestial Pole, which has, over time, shifted to Polaris.The ecliptic pole, however, does not change, since the path of the sun throughthe sky never changes. Around this point, which has no star visible to the nakedeye to mark it, is the constellation Draco, the Great Dragon, which spiralsthrough all of the zodiacal signs. The stars appear to hang, talah, from it.Draco thereby becomes the Teli (fig. 4.5), which the Sefer Yetzirah (6:3) tellsus, is over the universe “like a king on his throne.”13[36_endnote-title.html#ddd13] This is perhaps an echo of an ancient form ofworship of the God Most High identified with Baal, which predated the arrival ofthe Hebrews in Palestine. This serpent is also the serpent of the Gardenclimbing its way up the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, the brazenserpent used by Moses to heal the plagues in the wilderness, and even Hermes’caduceus staff.The Gnostic Ophites, who worshipped the serpent in the Garden of Eden for givingus the gift of knowledge that provided an escape from the Demiurge, formulatedthe image of a snake spiraling around an egg. In simple terms, this is Dracocoiled around the ellipse made by the movement of the North Celestial Pole. TheTeli here would be the axis of the ecliptic poles through the head and tail ofthe dragon and the center of the celestial sphere. This is the first dragon, thePole Serpent.image [images/image109-00.jpg]Figure 4.5. A, The constellation Draco in early Hebrew star charts; B, the Teliappearing as a serpent with gaping mouth. (From the commentary by Rabbi EleazerRok of Worms, 1160–1237)There are, however, two other ways to interpret the dragon-axis of the Teli.Medieval Hebrew astronomers used the term teli to denote the inclination of theorbit of a planet from the ecliptic. In the case of the moon, this allows one totrack eclipses. Eclipses occur only when the sun and moon arrive at the moon’snodes, or the head and tail of the dragon to the ancient astronomers, at thesame time, as shown in figure 4.6. This happens roughly every six months. Solareclipses were seen as occasions when, metaphorically, the dragon caught andswallowed the sun for a period of time. The concept of ascending and descendingnodes as an axis, the head and tail of the dragon, or Teli, was also used withthe other planets. The major such Teli or axis for the sun is formed by itssolstice standstills, which are also the points where the celestial equatorcrosses the ecliptic in this precessional epoch. This axis can be seen as thesecond dragon, the Coiled Serpent.image [images/image110-00.jpg]Figure 4.6. The lunar dragon perched between the two circles formed by theorbits of the sun and the moon. (From Agrippa’s De Occulta Philosophia)And there is still another way to look at the concept of the Teli. If we thinkof the Milky Way as the Leviathan because of the way that it snakes across thenight sky through the year, then this third Teli, yet another dragon-axis,becomes the galactic axis, running through the ecliptic from Scorpio/Sagittariusto Taurus/Gemini; see fig. 4.7. This is the third and final dragon. Like theecliptic axis, the galactic axis is constant and unmoving. Between these twopillars, or perpendicular axes, lies the coiled dragon of precession, spinningslowly backward through time, moving one degree of arc every seventy-two years.Knowledge of the backward march of the precession caused by the earth’s tiltconstituted the great secret of many ancient cultures as different as Greece andthe Maya of Mexico.14 [36_endnote-title.html#ddd14]A Talmudic example makes this even clearer: “The storm wind hangs [talah]between the arms of God like an amulet.”15 [36_endnote-title.html#ddd15] Thehanging is, of course, the Teli. The storm wind is the slowly backward-turningspiral of precession and a good metaphor for the mystical experience itself. Theprophet Nahum (1:3) declares, “His way is in the whirlwind,” and Psalms 50:3agrees that to experience God is to plunge into the tempest that surrounds Him.The arms of the universe are the unmoving Teli, the ecliptic and galactic axes,from which the initiatory spiral of the equinoxes is suspended like an amulet.It is hard to overestimate the value of the knowledge of one’s location in spaceand in time that these three axes provided. It would also seem as if these axeswere creating an address for Earth, the purpose of which remains a mystery.image [images/image111-00.jpg]Figure 4.7. The three dragon axes: A, the galactic meridian from center to edge;B, the moving axis of the precession of the equinoxes/solstices; C, the unmovingecliptic polar axis in Draco.In verse 106 of the Bahir we read that the Teli is nothing but “the likenessbefore the Blessed Holy One,” or the face of God.16[36_endnote-title.html#ddd16] Verse 96 of the Bahir addresses key alchemicalsymbols, and may in fact be our earliest mention of the philosopher’s stone. Itbegins: “What is the earth from which the heavens were graven [created]? It isthe throne of the Blessed Holy One. It is the Precious Stone and the Sea ofWisdom.”17 [36_endnote-title.html#ddd17] The verse continues to suggest thespiritual value of the color blue, the traditional color of kingship in ancientcultures, by associating the sea with the sky and the sky with the higher lightcoming from the Throne of Creation.From the Bahir, we learn that the Tree of Life is actually the “Precious Stone”whose facets are projected onto the celestial sphere and which is part of thecontinuous flow of the Sea of Wisdom. John’s Revelation is a version of this,with the Tree of Life on the banks of the flowing river, deep inside NewJerusalem’s Cube of Space. We can also see that all of this weird symbolismactually has a context and a meaning, and is grounded in firm reality.So what happened to the Tree of Knowledge? Is it banished from the perfectedschema? The Bahir suggests, in many subtle references, that the Tree ofKnowledge forms itself around the axis of the Celestial Pole, whose Teli ordragon-axis would be the backward-spiraling axis of the precession of theequinoxes. The North Celestial Pole, as it circles around the fixed point of theecliptic pole, first leans in toward the angle of the galactic axis—that is,toward the center of the galaxy (see fig. 4.8). It then moves away from thispoint in a large precessional cycle. The Fall occurs when the Tree is tiltedaway from the galactic axis. The Resurrection and Redemption, the arrival of thekingdom of heaven, happens when the Tree tilts toward the galactic axis. Thefour great ages, then, are the tilting of the pole in toward the center of thegalaxy, which translates into the Golden and Silver Ages, and the tilting of thepole away from the center of the galaxy, which brings on the Bronze Age and thecurrent Iron Age.The mystical experience of the galgal, or cycle, of the Tree of Knowledge is thewhirlwind, or sufah in our Talmudic reference.18 [36_endnote-title.html#ddd18]The galgal is also spoken of in the Bahir as a womb. This is a cycle of time inwhich the future is born. All of time happens within the sphere defined by theTeli. The Bahir also tells us that the Teli is revealed in the heart ofheaven.19 [36_endnote-title.html#ddd19] This is both our own human, personal,spiritual center, the heart of man, and the heart at the center of our own MilkyWay galaxy. Together they pulsate in harmonic fractals of the same wave.THE KAABA, THE EL MOST HIGH, AND THE COVENANT OF ABRAHAMAccording to biblical tradition, Abraham learned the great ancient secrets fromShem, the son of Noah, also known as Melchizedek. He was the righteous king ofUr and Salem, which is now thought to be Jerusalem. The most important mysteriesof the work of creation concerned the significance of the letters of the Hebrewalphabet and their relationship to astrology and the mysteries of the calendar,or time itself. Attributing this wisdom to Abraham and Melchizedek places itsorigin in the eighteenth century B.C.E., the time of the rise of the New Kingdomin Egypt as well as the appearance of Vedic scholars in India.20[36_endnote-title.html#ddd20]image [images/image113-00.jpg]Figure 4.8. The precessional motion tilts toward and away from the galacticcenter, creating the “Four Ages.”Abraham was considered to be the greatest magician and astrologer of his age.The Talmud tells us that “all the kings of East and West [Egypt and India] aroseearly [to wait] at his door.”21 [36_endnote-title.html#ddd21] The teachings ofthe work of creation are one of the primary astrological texts of the ancientworld. This teaching incorporates the astrological wisdom Abraham was said tohave known “in his heart”—that is, was revealed to him through meditative ormagical means.Forty miles or so inland from Jiddah, in what is now Saudi Arabia, the town ofMecca sits at the juncture of pre-Islamic Arabia’s most important trade routes.The mile-long caravans traveling from the spice kingdoms of southern Arabia tothe world markets of Mesopotamia turned north and east through the gap in theHejaz Mountains near Mecca. Cargo from Africa—Abyssinia, now Ethiopia, lies justacross the Red Sea—landed at Jiddah and moved inland for distribution at Mecca.The town thrived on trade and travelers. This is significant because, from itsfounding, the town of Mecca was also an important sacred site and a destinationfor pilgrims.The ancient Arabs were pantheists who worshipped the spirit, or genius, of placein a large variety of ways, including pilgrimage and animal—and sometimeshuman—sacrifice.22 [36_endnote-title.html#ddd22] They personified the sun andthe moon, the sky, the stars, and the desert and lived in a world filled withjinns and afreets, or spirits and ghosts. In the vast darkness of the desert,the stars became the backdrop against which the mythological drama of lifeplayed itself out. Navigating in the desert, as at sea, required knowledge ofthe stars and their relationship to time and movement. These factors gave riseto a complex astrological mythology. This astrology was similar, if not exactlythe same, to that found in the oldest sections of the Sefer Yetzirah.Abraham, as revealed in the Talmud, was the most famous astrologer of his time.Interestingly enough, even in the eighteenth century B.C.E., Mecca was ajunction point in the trade between India and Egypt. According to the traditionwithin the Quraysh, Muhammad’s clan, Abraham and his other son Ishmael, whosename means “God hears,” also founded Mecca.From the Sefer Yetzirah, we learn of the Cube of Space (the twelve edges of thecube are formed from the twelve double letters of the Hebrew alphabet, which areattributed to the signs of the zodiac) within which the jewel-like Tree of Lifeforms. This astrological concept is attributed to Abraham just as the buildingof the physical cube, the Kaaba of Mecca with its sacred Black Stone, is alsoclaimed as his work. The Kaaba (literally, “cube,” and from the same root) isthe black stone meteorite that all Muslims attempt to touch at least once intheir lifetime. A cube has twelve edges. Each of these edges relates to adifferent sign in the zodiac. The cube of space in Mecca, here on earth, is afractal representation of the real Cube of Space.The pilgrimage to Mecca is one of the five pillars of the Islamic faith.According to Islamic tradition, the Kaaba has been rebuilt ten times, mirroringthe number of spheres on the Tree of Life. The Kether, or Crown, cube was saidto have been built by the angels in heaven. It is this cube of space that isdescribed in the Sefer Yetzirah and the Bahir.Wisdom and Understanding, the second and third cubes, were said by Islamictradition to have been built by Adam and his youngest son, Seth. The fourth isnamed Mercy, and Abraham and his son by Hagar, Ishmael, are said to have builtit in an after-the-Flood restoration. It is from this point that Mecca dates itsfounding. Strength and Beauty are the fifth and sixth cubes that were built inMecca. They are attributed by Arab legends to kings of the Sabean and Himyaritekingdoms. Quasy, the patriarch of the Quraysh, built the seventh cube, Victory.The eighth, Splendor, was completed during Muhammad’s lifetime. The ninth andtenth cubes, attributed to the sefirot named Foundation and Kingdom, were builtwithin sixty years of his death.Within the cube is the sacred Black Stone, a piece of purplish red tektiteembedded in the wall of the southeastern corner about five feet from thefloor—at just the right height for kissing. The Black Stone has been a part ofthe cube in Mecca since at least the fourth version of the Kaaba attributed toAbraham. Tradition holds that the stone represents the new, post-catastrophecovenant between God and the family of Abraham.Islamic scholars also point to a verse in Matthew (21:42–43) in support of thistradition. Jesus, during his last week in Jerusalem, often came to the forecourtof Herod’s temple to teach. Matthew tells us that as Jesus enters the temple onemorning, the chief priests and the elders who demanded by what authority hetaught the scriptures accosts him. Jesus asked them a question: Was Johnbaptized by heaven or by men? When the elders cannot answer, Jesus refuses totell them the source of his authority and then lays into them for spiritualblindness. Even the people on the street, the obvious sinners, could see thatJohn was a man of righteousness, Jesus tells them, but you, the spiritualleaders of the people, still can’t decide on the source of John’s message.He continues, making the point even sharper, with the parable of the tenants whowouldn’t share the fruits of the harvest with the landlord of the vineyard, butinstead killed his servants and his son. Jesus asks the elders what they thinkwould happen when the owner returned. They reply that he would turn the tenantsout of the vineyard, of course. Jesus then drove home the point by quoting Psalm118 (22–23): “The stone the builders rejected has become the head of the corner;the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes.” To make sure they gotit, Jesus said: “Therefore I tell you that the Kingdom of Heaven will be takenfrom you and given to those who will produce the fruit.” It’s easy to see howMuslims found in this parable support for their religion. This encounter wasvery likely the motivating incident that led to Jesus’ betrayal and death. Fromthis point on, the Gospels tell us, the Jewish elders plotted a way to arresthim without the people knowing and interfering.Christian commentators see in this incident the shift from Judaism toChristianity, with Christ as the stone the builders rejected. Jesus is clearlystating that the Jewish elders no longer understood the basis of the religionthey professed. To the Muslim, however, who had seen how little spiritual fruitorthodox Christianity produced, this verse suggested another interpretation. Therejected stone was Ishmael, the part of Abraham’s progeny rejected by Israel.The stone, the black meteorite, was also rejected, cast out of the sky, orheaven. Since Israel had broken its Abrahamic covenant, the kingdom of heavenreverted to the other heir, Ishmael, who will gather the fruits of the harvest.The landlord of the vineyard in the parable is, of course, Allah to the Muslim,not Yahweh, or Jehovah, in the Hebraic tradition. In Genesis 14:18, we are toldthat after a great battle, Abram, as his name was then, worshipped the God MostHigh with the king of Jerusalem, Melchizedek. As we have seen in the Bahir,Melchizedek was thought to be Shem, a son of Noah and a survivor of thecatastrophic Flood. He was also Abraham’s teacher and collaborator in the workof creation. The titles used in Genesis, “God Most High, Lord of Heaven andcreator of the earth,” are the same titles used for Baal. They are also the sameas the ancient Canaanite name for the Pole Serpent, the Teli, which the SeferYetzirah tells us is hanging over the “universe . . . like a king on histhrone.” It is important to understand that all of these mythologies areessentially astronomical. The Teli in Draco is the constellation that rules overall of the signs and therefore the ages and the worlds, the past and the future.The Islamic creator Allah is simply the Arabic version of this Canaanite El. Thename Baal, or Ba-el, is literally translated as “the Space-Filling God.” Allahis also called “He who holds the stars in place.” This God Most High can only bethe constellation of Draco. Not only does Draco fill all the signs of thezodiac, but it also sits atop the Cube of Space very much like a king on histhrone.Before the coming of Islam, at the Kaaba in Mecca the temple of Allah containedaltars to his eight wives and daughters. These ancient goddesses are clearlyrelated to the seven planets and the earth. Al-Uzza, the mighty one, was thesun. Al-Manat, the triple-faced goddess, was clearly the moon. The earthgoddess, whose name was al-Lat, is actually talah, or teli, spelled backward.The earth is the mirror of the Teli. Everything that occurs in the heavens willbe mirrored down on Earth. Therefore the “Tala” in space becomes al-Lat here onEarth. This serves to clinch our identification of Allah with the Teli, or PoleSerpent.But there’s more—from the ground looking up, the ancient astronomers saw thatDraco curved around the still point of the ecliptic pole (fig. 4.9) and that itstail bent backward in the shape of the Arabic letter laam (see fig. 4.10). Thisis perhaps the basis from which the word El was derived. Reflected on the earth,however, this L of the Teli or Pole Serpent is reversed. If Allah is the GodMost High, the L in the sky, then his daughter the earth is the reflection ofthat nature. And so the masculine “El,” or “Al,” becomes the feminine “al-Lat.”image [images/image117-00.jpg]Figure 4.9. A diagram of the constellations Draco and Ursa Minor, according toPtolemy, shows how the Pole Serpent has stars in all the houses of the zodiac,and how it curves around the ecliptic pole.image [images/image118-00.jpg]Figure 4.10. The Arabic letter laam.The Quraysh, who thought of themselves as descendants of Abraham, worshippedAllah as their chief god. They referred to him as the Lord of the Soil, to whomthey must pay a tithe of their crops and herds. This was not quitemonotheism—Allah still had his wives—but it paved the way for Muhammad’sinsistence that Allah was the One and only God. Muhammad, like Abraham, decidedthat the God Most High was the only god worthy of worship.The Book of Genesis, chapter 15, tells us that, soon after Abram received theblessing of the God Most High, the Lord visited his word upon him in a vision.He commanded Abram to look up at the stars and count them, if he could. Godpromises that Abram’s descendants will be as numerous as the stars, or possiblywill be as the stars. All he has to do is make a covenant with the Lord byperforming a peculiar ritual sacrifice. Abram is told to take five animals,split the heifer, the goat, and the ram in half, and leave the two birds whole.The ten resulting sections, the six separated halves and the four unseparatedhalves, can be attributed to the spheres on the Tree of Life, according to thesages of the Sefer Yetzirah.This arrangement polarized the Tree of Life. The Tree is normally shown alignedalong three parallel axes, but, as shown in figure 4.11, it is split inAbraham’s sacrifice into two groups of five, like the fingers on each hand (seefig. 4.12). The spheres were then given masculine or feminine qualities. Six areclearly opposite each other, since they occur on the right or left pillar of theTree, while the remaining four are normally on the middle axis. These four aredivided into Kether and Tiferet on the right and Yesod and Malkuth on the left.This also symbolizes Abram’s arrangement of offerings, and creates a tensionbetween Binah and Tiferet and Yesod and Tiferet.Abram made his strange sacrifice of the split animals at sunset and fell into adeep sleep. We are told that thick and dreadful darkness came over him, and theLord spoke within it describing the future of Abram’s descendants. And then acurious thing happened. Abram had a vision of a smoking firepot with a blazingtorch. According to most authorities, this is an ancient symbol of the presenceof the God Most High. This torch or pillar went through the gap between Binahand Tiferet and Yesod and Tiferet. This, Genesis tells us, sealed the covenantbetween Abram and his god.image [images/image119-00.jpg]Figure 4.11. The Tree polarized according to masculine and feminine qualities;in this human-scale form, the values of each sefirot take a gender specificquality. The interplay of duality is what gives the symbolism of the Tree ofLife its diversity and universality.image [images/image119-01.jpg]Figure 4.12. The kabbalistic spheres attributed to the fingers.Later, when Abram was ninety-nine years old, the God Most High made a returnappearance to confirm the covenant. This time the Lord changed Abram’s name toAbraham, by adding an h, or the Hebrew letter heh, in the middle. Heh, as shownin figure 4.13, is a pictogram of a window in ancient Hebrew. The Lord alsoinstituted the rite of circumcision as a physical sign of man’s acceptance ofthe covenant. From this point on, Abraham’s descendants were the chosen peopleof the God Most High.image [images/image120-00.jpg]Figure 4.13. The Hebrew letter heh as a pictogram of a window.Much of this makes little sense until we remember that, in the Bahir, the twelveedges of the Cube of Space are also the zodiacal paths connecting the spheres onthe Tree. The gap or aisle between the sacrifices represents the astrologicalsigns of Sagittarius and Gemini. These signs mark the third dragon-axis, as wenoted above, which is the axis of the galaxy itself. The firepot with a blazingtorch, symbol of the presence of the God Most High, travels the major axis ofthe galaxy, from the center out to the edge (fig. 4.14).Abraham made his covenant, then, with the creative force flowing outward fromthe galactic core, or third dragon-axis. He called this the God Most High, whois also Muhammad’s Allah. Our world is formed from the intersection of the threepillars or axes of the Teli. Abraham’s descendants entered the galgal, or cycleof time, through the heh, or window, added to his name by the Lord. Heh isassigned to Aquarius, a zodiacal sign at a right angle to the axis of theGalaxy. It also symbolizes the moving axis of the Coiled Serpent, which definesthe evolutionary flow of human events and the quality of time. Abraham’sdescendants would be the chosen people of God as long they remembered the windowinto the cycle of time that God had given them. This may be the motivationbehind Jesus’ warning that the Hebrews had lost their true faith—they hadforgotten the window into the cycles of time.image [images/image120-01.jpg]Figure 4.14. The polarization between the fingers/sephiot creates the spacethrough which the “presence” of God, symbolized as a flaming torch or a ball offire, passed.The Black Stone was the physical seal of this covenant, a gift from the sky, atoken of God’s favor. It is interesting to note that the description in Genesis15:17 of the smoking firepot with a blazing torch coming out of it also suggeststhe path of a meteor through the sky. The actual placement of the Black Stonewithin the Kaaba also suggests the northwest–southeast axis of the galaxy asseen in two dimensions. The stone that fell from heaven is a physical piece ofevidence for the presence of the God Most High. With this in mind, we canunderstand the reference in Psalm 118 to the rejected stone that became the headof the corner, and Jesus’ denunciation of the Jewish elders for notunderstanding their own religion.If Jesus was a student of the Bahir, then he would have known the secret of theTeli. From the elders’ answer to the question of authority, Jesus knew that theyno longer grasped the secret of time. John the Baptist had preached that thekingdom of heaven was near. How could he have known that? This is really whatJesus is asking the priests and elders. They, of course, have no answer, soJesus refuses to tell them the truth. By asking the right question, we can seethat he must have already known the answer.ISLAM: SANCTUARY OF SACRED SCIENCEMuhammad, like Abraham and Isis the Prophetess, received his wisdom directlyfrom an angelic messenger. The Koran is the collection of Muhammad’srevelations. They were written down within fifty years after his death by hisfollowers, who had memorized the words as they were pronounced. The Koran leaveslittle doubt about angelic intervention. Like all successful prophets andspiritual leaders, Muhammad gave a voice to the needs and longings of his time.The Arabs were influenced by the Christians and the Jews who lived among them,and they eagerly awaited their own messenger from God. Muhammad admired theethical precepts of Christianity and the monotheism of the Jews. He was alsoconscious of the power of a divinely inspired scripture to mold a religion.Others may have had similar thoughts. From Byzantine sources we hear of severalArab “prophets” who rose to prominence during the late sixth and early seventhcenturies. Muhammad’s difference, and perhaps the root of his success, lies inhis connection through the Kaaba with the mysteries of creation given toAbraham. He could speak with authority because he had rediscovered the windowinto the cycles of time, and his proof was the Koran, which flowed from above ina torrent of revelation.Muhammad’s revelations began on the night of the twenty-seventh of Ramadan inthe year 610 C.E. Muhammad was alone in the great cave at the foot of MountHira, a few miles outside of Mecca. He had gone there to pray and meditate, buthe was asleep when the angel Gabriel appeared with a curious book and demandedthat he read it. Muhammad was illiterate so he protested that he could not read.Then the angel pressed its weight down on him to the point that he thought hewas going to smother to death. When the angel released him, Muhammad sat up andfound that he could read. On awakening, Muhammad felt that words from themagical book were engraved in his heart. He fled out of the cave, into theearly-morning sunlight, and beheld a vision of the angel Gabriel as the cosmicman. In that moment Gabriel declared that Muhammad was indeed the messenger ofAllah.Thereafter, the revelations came thick and fast. Often, when they came, Muhammadwould fall to the ground in a convulsion or a swoon. He would become drenchedwith sweat. Even his camel would become skittish when a spell hit. Muhammad wastransformed by these experiences; from a shy and introspective orphan, he becamethe patriarch of the Arab people.His cousin and son-in-law, Ali, left us a vivid description of Muhammad a fewyears after his revelations began. He describes Muhammad as “of middle stature,neither tall nor short. His complexion was rosy white, his eyes black; his hair,thick, brilliant and beautiful, fell to his shoulders. His profuse beard fell tohis breast. . . . There was such sweetness in his visage that no one, once inhis presence, could leave him. If I hungered, a single look at the Prophet’sface dispelled the hunger. Before him, all forgot their grief and pains.”23[36_endnote-title.html#ddd23]Later, when he was pressed to describe the process of revelation, Muhammaddeclared that the entire text of the Koran was a book written in heaven. He saidthe angel Gabriel communicated it to him one piece at a time. Asked how he couldremember these divine discourses, Muhammad replied that he repeated each phraseafter the angel. The stress from the experience, he said, caused his hair toturn gray.For a decade, Muhammad preached in Mecca. He made little headway in convertingthe population, except for his immediate family and the ones that became knownas the Companions. The Companions were the true believers, such as Abu Bakr andOmar al-Khattab. For a while Muhammad moved to al-Taif, a center of the goddessal-Uzza, the mighty one worshipped by his mother’s clan. From this brief exoduscame the so-called Satanic Verses, where the Koran seems to endorse goddessworship. Within a year after this, Muhammad was back in Mecca preaching in frontof the Kaaba.This time, however, he was without protection. The control of the main clan hadpassed to the mortal enemies of Muhammad’s uncle. Islam found itself severelypersecuted. But just when things looked bleakest, a miracle happened, or so itseemed to Muhammad. Before he left for the city of al-Taif, Muhammad hadpreached to a group of pilgrims from the garden city of Yathrib. Afterward itwould be forever known as Medina, or The City.The town of Yathrib had a large Jewish population that responded to Muhammad’steachings. Because of the similarity to their own religion, they accepted histeaching and began to spread the word back home. They were also willing toaccept Muhammad as the messenger of a monotheistic Allah who will reign over theearth at the Last Judgment. So Muhammad fled Mecca for Yathrib, which became theCity of the Prophet. The year of his departure, or hejira, became the startingpoint for the Islamic calendar.Eight years later, after much skirmishing and caravan raiding, Muhammad marchedback into Mecca as the conquering messenger. He cleaned out the Kaaba, removedthe altars to Allah’s wives and daughters, but kept the Black Stone and itsritual kiss. He then proclaimed Mecca the Holy City of Islam. For the last twoyears of his life, Muhammad ruled from Mecca with a gentle hand. As Islam grew,Muhammad sent letters to the capitals of the world announcing his revelation. Hereceived no replies to these letters. Casually he watched the mutual destructionof Byzantium and Persia. There is no indication that Muhammad ever consideredspreading the Islamic faith outside of Arabia.That was not the case, however, with his heirs. Muhammad had appointed nosuccessor. After a brief rivalry, the Muslim leaders elected Abu Bakr, the firstCompanion, to be caliph, or representative of the faithful. Abu Bakr’s faith andsteadfastness saw the faith through its first war and rebellion. Khalid ibnal-Walid was the most brilliant and ruthless of the Muslim Arab generals. Hewent from pacifying Arabia to defeating the Greek emperor Heraclius outsideDamascus. With that, Syria became an Arab and Islamic stronghold.By then Abu Bakr had died and a fellow Companion, Omar al-Khattab, had beenchosen caliph. Omar encouraged the Islamic conquest. In 644 Omar was cut down bya Persian slave in the Medina mosque. But by then the Muslim armies ruled Egypt,Palestine, and Persia. The conquests continued under Othman the Unfortunate,until by the time of Ali’s caliphate (656–661), the Islamic domains extendedfrom the Atlas Mountains in North Africa to the Black Sea and the mountains ofAfghanistan.Less than thirty years after the death of Muhammad, Islam ruled more of theearth than Rome had at its height. It is hard to imagine how a political,social, and religious shift of this magnitude could have happened. But it did.Muhammad taught of a stern, yet merciful, God in terms more than faintlyreminiscent of the Bahir and the Sefer Yetzirah. In the Koran, sura 2:255, thefamous Throne Verse, we find Allah described in terms remarkably similar tothose used to describe the Teli, or Pole Serpent. “His Throne extends over theheavens and the earth . . . He alone is Most High and Supreme.”The Koran is filled with references to the Last Judgment. Only Allah, the Korantells us, knows the time of the Last Judgment. We are also told that certainsigns will prefigure its arrival. Disbelief in God will be widespread, alongwith moral chaos. There will be tumults in the sky and on the earth. Wars ofsuch magnitude will occur that the wise men will wish themselves dead. The finalsignal will be three trumpet blasts. At the first, our material universe will bedestroyed. The second will “uncreate” all men and angels and spirits, while thethird will accomplish the resurrection. Then Allah will arrive to conduct theJudgment. Only those who can cross the bridge of al-Sirat, which is finer than ahair and sharper than a sword, will be allowed to enter Paradise.In the Koran, Paradise is described as a perfect garden where all manner of goodthings to eat and drink are available, including wine that exhilarates whileleaving one clearheaded. These eternal feasts are attended by nubile beautieswhom neither age nor weariness nor death can mar. The blessed will see the faceof Allah and become immortal, “never growing old.” Who could resist such animage of Paradise?The most significant sura in the Koran, from the perspective of the secret atthe heart of alchemy, is sura 24 (fig. 4.15). It is named al-Nur, or the Light.In verse 35 of the sura, the secret is revealed with blinding clarity: “Allah isthe light of the heavens and the earth. The semblance of His light is that of aniche in which is a lamp, the flame within a glass, the glass a glittering staras it were, lit with the oil of the blessed Tree, neither of the East nor of theWest, whose oil appears to light up even though fire touches it not—Light uponLight!”We shall wait until we have heard from Fulcanelli before we interpret this mostsignificant verse. For now, let us note that this verse is the origin point forIslamic mysticism, illumination, and gnosis. Mansur al-Hallaj, the great Sufimystic, tells us that the Light is from “a star whose astrological house is inthe empyrean.” Empyrean in this sense refers to the highest of heavens, and thissuggests the mid-heaven point of the north ecliptic pole. He also suggests thatthe light symbolizes the peace of the tranquil heart.image [images/image125-00.jpg]Figure 4.15. The Light Verse, sura 24:35, in a modern circular motif.Muhammad apparently gave esoteric teachings on these and other verses of theKoran to his son-in-law Ali, who passed them down to his son and grandson. Ali’scaliphate ended in the first great schism of Islam, when the religious andpolitical authorities of the Arabs split away from the family of the prophet. By680 C.E., most of Muhammad’s family had been killed. Only an infant son, Ali’sgrandson and the great-grandson of the Prophet, survived to carry on thetradition. From this came the split in Islam between Sunni and Shi’ite thatexists to this day.For the first two hundred years or so of Islamic civilization, mysticism took abackseat—except among the Shi’ites, or the “adherents” of the family of theProphet.24 [36_endnote-title.html#ddd24] The caliphs became ever more corrupt astheir power grew. Persecutions of the Shi’as increased. A general feelingdeveloped that Islam had somehow conquered the world and lost its soul.25[36_endnote-title.html#ddd25] Mansur al-Hallaj, quoted above, symbolized thisdefiantly mystical spirit. He was burned alive for blasphemy in 923 C.E.But a new spiritual current emerged from the Islamic underground. Composed offragments of all the conquered civilizations and religions but held together bythe teachings of the Prophet, the mystical tradition that in many cases farpredated Islam found a home within it. The new Sufi movement accepted thecorruption of the ruling classes and set to work to renovate the human soul.Another branch of Shi’ite Sufis, however, moved from mysticism to covertpolitical action. Their goal was to create a theocracy based on the innerteachings of Muhammad.The word sufi—composed of three Arabic letters, the sa, the wa, and the fa—hasmany different connotations and derivations. To some, it means safa, or“purity.” Others see it as safwe, or “the selected ones.” Other contenders aresaf, “line” and “row,” because the Sufis follow the “straight path” of Muhammad.Suf, “wool,” is also a good candidate because the Sufis often wore long woolenrobes. The Greek word sophia, or wisdom, is also a possible candidate. But theinner meaning of sa-wa-fa is sufah, or “whirlwind.”26[36_endnote-title.html#ddd26] This inner meaning points to the process ofspiritual transformation that is at the heart of Sufism. One of the later Sufiorders, the Mevlevis of Turkey, founded by Rumi, made whirling or spinning oneof their spiritual disciplines as an outward demonstration of this principle.Fifty years after the death of al-Hallaj, Sufism blossomed. The eleventh centurysaw the rise of the first great Sufi teaching orders in the East and the West.27[36_endnote-title.html#ddd27] As the Sufi movement grew, the more worldly andpolitical branch of the Shi’ites almost succeeded in conquering the Muslimworld.After the first wave of Arab conquest swept over North Africa, its provincessoon became independent kingdoms. By the tenth century, three great Islamickingdoms ruled in North Africa. They were the Idrisid dynasty in Morocco, theAghlabid in Libya, and the Tulunid in Egypt. In the first decade of the tenthcentury, a Shi’ite adventurer, Abu Abdallah, gained a following in Libya andTunisia by preaching the coming of the Mahdi, the Shi’ite savior or world ruler.Within a few years, Abdallah overthrew the Aghlabid dynasty. To fulfill hisclaims he invited a descendant of the Prophet, Obeidallah ibn Muhammad, tobecome king. Since Obeidallah was a descendant of Fatima, Muhammad’s daughter,the new dynasty called itself Fatimid.Under the Fatimids, North Africa regained a wealth and prosperity that it hadnot seen since the days of Carthage and republican Rome. Trade routes crossedthe Sahara to Lake Chad and Timbuktu in central Africa. After the Fatimidsconquered Egypt in 969 C.E., the Sudan and Abyssinia were also integrated intothe Islamic trading network. Egypt became the commercial link between Europe andAsia. By the early eleventh century, the Fatimid caliph, ruling from Cairo,controlled two thirds of the Muslim world, from Fez in Morocco to Damascus inSyria.The Fatimid mosques of Cairo provide an important link, both architecturally andspiritually, to the Gothic cathedrals of Europe. The mosque of Ibn Tulun, begunbefore the Fatimid conquest, combines pointed arches and vaulting with rosettestained-glass windows in stellar and geometrical patterns. This impulse reachedits high point with the Al Azhar Mosque.Jauhar, the converted Christian slave who conquered Egypt for the Fatimids,built the mosque between 970 and 972. The Al Azhar Mosque (al-azhar means “thebrilliant” or “the illuminated,” from the same root as the Hebrew bahir,“brilliance” or “illumination”) contains the pointed arches andvaulting—supported by 380 pillars of marble, granite, and porphyry—used in theIbn Tulun Mosque. It is also famous for its stained-glass designs. The reds andblues used in the Al Azhar Mosque were duplicated in the great cathedrals ofEurope. But they were never equaled for their depth and purity of color.In 988, Al Azhar Mosque became the world’s first university. The caliph Azizprovided tuition and maintenance for thirty-five scholars. As this schooldeveloped, it drew students from all over the Muslim world. It continues to thisday with thousands of students and hundreds of teachers. Its influence on thecourse of history has been profound, especially to medieval Europe.Al Azhar’s most famous scholar was the Muslim scientist known to the West asAlhazen. Mohammed ibn al-Haithan, or Alhazen, was a mathematician and engineer,a sort of Fatimid Leonardo da Vinci. His most important work is a book on opticsthat anticipates the telescope. Roger Bacon quotes his work extensively, as doKepler and Leonardo. We can hardly exaggerate the importance of Alhazen for thefoundation of modern astronomy.Attached to the Al Azhar Mosque was the Dar al-Hikmah, or the Hall of Wisdom,where Shi’ite theology was studied alongside medicine and astronomy. Ali ibnYunus, perhaps the greatest of Muslim astronomers, worked in the observatory ofthe Hall of Wisdom for seventeen years, compiling the first accurate tables ofplanetary cycles, measuring the inclination of the ecliptic, and discussing theprecession of the equinoxes.28 [36_endnote-title.html#ddd28] These are allastronomical preoccupations suggested by the Bahir and the Sefer Yetzirah, andprovide the key to understanding the great cycles of time.As the Fatimid dynasty spread, it propped up its power by gathering all of theShi’ite sects into one grand lodge of Cairo. This vast semisecret society washeld together by complex initiations and hierarchical degrees. Its members wereused for political espionage and intrigue. The forms of the order stronglyinfluenced the rituals and organization of the Templars.29[36_endnote-title.html#ddd29] It is possible that much of Western esotericismand its secret societies originated with the “Illuminated Mosque” and its Hallof Wisdom.Muhammad’s revelation transformed a nomadic and barbarian culture into aworld-class civilization. The power of that revelation, as we saw above, camefrom its ancient roots in the astrological magic of Abraham. With the Kaaba ofMecca as its focus, Islam managed to hold on to its ancient wisdom and eventransmit it to the spiritually bankrupt West. The Crusaders, especially theKnights Templar, came looking for conquests and kingdoms. They found both, butthey also discovered the secret mysteries of the alchemy of time. They broughtthis astronomical alchemical knowledge to Europe.30[36_endnote-title.html#ddd30] Because of the contact between the Templars andthe Islamic scientists, Europe enjoyed an unparalleled spiritual renaissance,the era of the Gothic cathedrals."},{"pageContent":"image [images/image131-00.jpg]The builders of the Middle Ages had the natural attributes of faith and modesty.The anonymous creators of pure works of art, they built for Truth, for theaffirmation of their ideal, for the propagation and the nobility of theirscience. . . .image [images/image131-01.jpg]The alchemists of the fourteenth century used to meet there once a week on theday of Saturn, either at the main porch, at the Portal of St. Marcel or else atthe little Porte-Rouge, all decorated with salamanders.—LE MYSTÈRE DES CATHÉDRALES"},{"pageContent":"FIVETHE HERMETIC POPE AND THE KNIGHTS TEMPLARimage [images/image132-00.jpg]THE ALCHEMICAL TRANSMISSION AND THE RECOVERY OFTHE WESTHaving examined the first thousand years of alchemy’s history, it is time totake stock of what we have discovered. The earliest surviving alchemical textsall have pre-Christian Gnostic associations. The Emerald Tablet inclines towardGreco-Egyptian Gnosticism as its source, while the “Isis the Prophetess” storysuggests an Egypto-Hebraic origin. The connection point is ancient Egypt.Zosimos informs us in his First Book of the Final Reckoning that alchemy derivedfrom the wisdom of the pre-catastrophe offspring of semidivine beings andhumans.1 [36_endnote-title.html#eee1] As noted in chapter 2[12_chapter-title-4.html], these beings were known in ancient Egypt as the HeruShemsu, or the Company of Horus, the Followers of the Widow’s Son. The “Isis theProphetess” story is our last text of the ancient wisdom, and in it we canidentify the major alchemical themes and preoccupations of the following twothousand years. Alchemy, as “Isis the Prophetess” tells us, is composed of threetransformations: an interior transformation, an exterior elementaltransformation of matter, and a transformation of time itself.In the collapse of the ancient world that began with Alexander, this unitaryview of alchemy fragmented into several parallel currents. The physicaltransformative process was seen as separate and became confused withmetallurgical and proto-chemical trickery. The internal transformation becamethe basis for the experiential mysticism, or gnosticism, of Christianity,Judaism, and Islam. The secret of the transformation of time, the advent of thekingdom of heaven, became the inner core of early Christianity. Unfortunately,this vision was co-opted and debased by the Church into an ongoing apocalypseagainst heretics. In Judaism, the secret of time was intimately intertwined withthe work of creation, the ability to animate matter. As we saw in the Bahir,Jewish mysticism retained intact a major portion of the secret.With Islam, the split began to widen even further. The secret of time, containedin the heart of Muhammad’s revelation, was retained as a family secret among thedescendants of the Prophet. The internal transformative processes became themystical practices of the Sufis, while the external transformation of theelements became one of the cornerstones of Islamic science, along with medicine,astronomy, and mathematics. Within Islam, threads of all three transformativeprocesses can be found, but it is hard to find anything close to a unitarysystem.By the second half of the tenth century, this separation had reached a kind ofmaximum dispersion. The secrets of the Bahir were known only to a few smallgroups of Jewish mystics. The Islamic mystics were just forming the early Sufiorders, while the Shi’ite owners of the inner secret were trying to conquer theIslamic world. Christianity, of course, had persecuted its alchemists andgnostics out of existence, leaving a shroud of darkness over the entireseven-hundred-year period from the fall of Rome to the Crusades.2[36_endnote-title.html#eee2]Learning in the West sank to a level little above superstition.3[36_endnote-title.html#eee3] Such scholars as there were, Pope Gregory the Great(590–604), for instance, dwelt mainly on ecclesiastical matters with an amazingcredulity for tales of marvels, miracles, and the possession of human beings bydemons. Beyond such writings, there were only confused compilations fromfragments of classical authors, variously and often wrongly ascribed. These werethe crumbs of ancient wisdom that nourished that dark and arid age.This sad state of affairs began to change when the Muslim Arabs and Berbersentered Spain from North Africa in the eighth century. Islam, seemingly endowedwith an insatiable curiosity for foreign learning and guided by a truly Orientalimagination that was in sharp contrast to the passive intellectualism of theWest, revitalized the civilization of the territories it conquered. Europe wassaved from this fate by Charlemagne’s grandfather, Charles Martel, at the battleof Tours in 732. But Spain became a Muslim stronghold (see fig.5.1).image [images/image134-00.jpg]Figure 5.1. The tenth-century gardens of Cordova in Muslim Spain.In the centuries that followed the Arab rise to world-power status, its caliphs,sultans, and generals exhibited a great interest in learning and arranged forthe literature of the conquered areas to be translated into Arabic. Much of theancient wisdom was preserved in these Arabic translations. The writings ofAristotle, Archimedes, Apollonius, Euclid, Hippocrates, and Galen were allpreserved for later rediscovery in the West by these Arabic collections. It wasalso through these Arabic sources that knowledge of alchemy was reintroduced toEurope.We have already mentioned Jabir, an eighth-century collector and interpreter ofgnostic alchemical texts, but of even more significance is the treatment givento the hermetic arts in the great tenth-century Arabic encyclopedia,Kitab-Fihirst. Several pages are devoted to various hermetic subjects, includingmention of the Egyptian Chemes, the pre-catastrophe founder of alchemy, HermesTrismegistus, Mary the Jewess, Cleopatra, and Stephan of Alexandria. The Arabs,at the close of the tenth century, had created a perspective on alchemy as aphysical methodology that would color its subsequent development down to thetwentieth century.Spain served as the transmission point between Islam and Christianity. As thetide of Islamic conquest receded, pockets of Christianity remained on theSpanish peninsula and slowly formed into Christian kingdoms. Along with thereligious and political struggles, this close contact provided a convenientmeans of communication. After the Fatimids conquered North Africa in the tenthcentury, Arab Spain found itself even more isolated from the centers of Muslimlife. The Spanish caliphs of the late tenth and early eleventh centuries wereconcerned with staying even with or ahead of their Fatimid rivals, particularlyin terms of culture and learning. It was from Spain, then, that Europe drew theenergy and knowledge needed to reanimate its civilization.4[36_endnote-title.html#eee4]By the early years of the eleventh century, largely as the result of the effortsof one individual, Gerbert of Aurillac, who would become Pope Sylvester II, theintellectual climate in the West had begun to change. Fueled in part by theapocalyptic yearnings centered on the thousand-year anniversary of Christ’sdeath (popularized by Sylvester’s student Rodulphus Glaber), the Christian Westbegan to stir itself. The Church of Rome tried a few reforms, driven by the newand growing monastic and Peace of God movements. But most significant of all,waves of pilgrims took the long and dusty road to Jerusalem.Pilgrimage, journeys of repentance and spiritual seeking, had long been animportant part of popular Christianity. But before the middle of the eleventhcentury, pilgrimages to the Holy Land were rare. Starting around the magicalyear of 1033 (one thousand years after Christ’s death) and continuing in anever-increasing wave for the next forty years, Jerusalem became the pilgrimagedestination of choice. In 1071, the Seljuk Turks conquered Palestine, wrenchingthe Holy Land from the control of the Egyptian Fatimids, who were sympathetic tothe Christian pilgrims. The Turks, however, were not so accommodating. By theearly 1080s, pilgrimage to Jerusalem had all but stopped. The few pilgrims whowere allowed to visit the Holy City were harassed, robbed, and generally treatedas unwanted outsiders.5 [36_endnote-title.html#eee5]Most authorities tell us that this was the motivating factor behind thecrusading movement that would overtake Europe after Pope Urban II’s call in1095.6 [36_endnote-title.html#eee6] The pilgrim impulse, however, soon turnedinto Holy War. While there is a kernel of truth in this simplification, the realcauses of the First Crusade are shrouded by the secrecy of deep politicalintrigue. From our thousand-year distance, these shadows are almostimpenetrable. Like the sudden appearance of a star through the murk of a cloudymidnight, however, certain events and personalities shed some light on theoutlines of the Crusades’ political intrigues.The most important of these events was the political conjunction between Eastand West begun by Pope Sylvester II, the new Holy Roman emperor, Otto III, andthe mad caliph al-Hakim one hundred years before the First Crusade wasannounced. While it is true that the First Crusade was a pilgrim movement withJerusalem as its focus, it was also much more. It was part of a vast planconceived and carried out by a group of secret societies for the purpose ofcreating a world-state in the Holy Land and thereby bring on the chiliastmillennium of peace.7 [36_endnote-title.html#eee7]THE ALCHEMICAL POPE AND THE CREATION OF THE MILLENNIUMAs the Fatimid influence spread in the tenth and eleventh centuries, some of theesoteric knowledge began to reach Europe through the schools of Muslim Spain,where science and civilization had attained a level unknown elsewhere. The bestminds of Europe traveled to Spain to study everything from music to medicine toastronomy. One such student, Gerbert of Aurillac, stands out as particularlynotable. It was Gerbert’s efforts that almost single-handedly pulled theChristian West out of the Dark Ages.Gerbert’s life is an example of how a poor intellectual prodigy could rise tothe very top of early medieval society. He was born around 940 in Auvergne,France, and at an early age entered the nearby monastery of Aurillac. At theabbot’s insistence, Gerbert was sent to Spain to study mathematics (see fig.5.2).Spain in the mid-960s was at the peak of its civilization. The caliph Hakim II,son of the triumphant Abd-al-Rahman, who forged Muslim Spain into a world power,surpassed every one of his predecessors in the love of literature and thesciences, we are told by the Muslim historian al-Maqrizi.8[36_endnote-title.html#eee8] He turned all of Andalusia, Muslim Spain, into amarket where the wisdom and learning of the whole ancient and medieval worldcould be found. It was into this environment that the young prodigy, Gerbert ofAurillac, was immersed, studying at the monastery of Santa Maria de Ripoll (seefig. 5.3).image [images/image137-00.jpg]Figure 5.2. Gerbert of Aurillac, later Pope Sylvester II, the renaissance man ofthe Dark Ages. (Mural from the Vatican library)Gerbert must have done very well indeed, because we find Count Borel ofBarcelona introducing him to the pope in 970. Pope John XIII, one of the fewpopes of the period who seemed sincere and managed to die of old age instead ofassassination, was so impressed by Gerbert’s erudition that he recommended himto the up-and-coming Otto I, emperor of the Roman West and the Charlemagne ofGermany.After seventy years of internal discord, Otto I, a match for Charlemagne inlooks and temperament, became the king of the Franks. At his coronation, Ottosurrounded himself with the nobility of the neighboring countries, creating atthe very beginning of his reign a sense of transnational importance. No wonderhe soon began to see himself as the restorer of the Western Empire.In the first fifteen years of his reign, Otto strove by any means possible, fromwar to murder to marriage, to accomplish this goal. In 962, Pope John XIIcrowned Otto the Holy Roman Emperor of the West. Within a year of his becomingemperor, Otto had marched into Italy and made it a part of the new Holy RomanEmpire, which was, of course, a mere appanage of the Frankish crown ofCharlemagne. This was the new world power to which the young and scholarlyGerbert was introduced in 970.image [images/image138-00.jpg]Figure 5.3. Seventeenth-century engraving of the monastery of Santa Maria deRipoll, near Barcelona in Catalonian Spain, where Gerbert learned astronomy,mathematics, Greek, and the magic of the Moors. Uncredited figure from JamesReston’s The Last Apocalypse (New York: Doubleday, 1998)For the next thirty-three years, Gerbert would be the spiritual adviser andmentor to all three Ottos, Otto I, his son Otto II, and his grandson Otto III.Gerbert’s vast learning and command of all three diplomatic languages of hisday, Latin (which he wrote with an elegance not seen since Sidonius in the fifthcentury),9 [36_endnote-title.html#eee9] Greek, and Arabic, made him an importantplayer in the diplomatic intrigues of the new imperial court. From the mid-970sto his death in 1003, Gerbert would remain at the center of the changes sweepingthrough the West.During the year he served as tutor to the young Otto II, Gerbert also helpedOtto I arrange a marriage between the Greek emperor’s daughter, Theophano, andhis student. This would make their son, the future Otto III, the heir of bothhalves of the old Roman Empire.Hard on the heels of the successful conclusion of the marriage negotiations andthe wedding, Gerbert was dispatched, at his own request, to Rheims, the ancientand royal cathedral town of Charlemagne, where every king of France (from ClovisI in the fifth century to Louis XVI in the eighteenth) was crowned. Soon afterhis arrival, he was appointed head of the cathedral’s school by Otto II inappreciation for his diplomatic efforts. He held this post for a decade, andduring that time he collected manuscripts from around the world and wrote workson the astrolabe, Arabic astronomy, and geometry.Gerbert left his post as master of the cathedral school at Rheims in 982. Duringthis period we find him writing letters to various other cathedral schoolspromoting the development of libraries and encouraging the addition of Greek andmathematics to the curriculum.Gerbert’s opportunity to return to power politics arrived in 987 with the deathof the last Carolingian king of France, Louis V. The unhappy Louis left noheirs, so the choice was between Charles of Lorraine, Louis’ brother and adistant offshoot of the Carolingian line, and the best candidate from the lineof the previous dynasty, the Merovingian.This obscure Dark Age dynasty has been made famous by the speculations in HolyBlood, Holy Grail that the descendants of Jesus and Mary Magdalene in factfounded this royal lineage. There is just enough evidence in support of thecontention that the Holy Family, its relatives, and perhaps even descendantssurvived in southern France to make us wonder exactly what their contemporariesmade of it all. While the Merovingians were certainly thought to be peculiar,there is no contemporary indication that anyone connected the Merovingiansdirectly to the Holy Family.10 [36_endnote-title.html#eee10]Medieval tradition reports that the Merovingians had a supernatural origin.Gregory of Tours, the foremost Frankish historian, tells us that Merovee, thefounder of the dynasty, was the son of two fathers. The first king of theFranks, Chlodio, was one father. The other was a strange sea creature, “similarto a Quinotaur,” according to Gregory of Tours, which impregnated his motherwhile she was out bathing in the ocean. From this, he was given the nameMerovee, “son of the sea.” Merovee can also be translated as “son of the mother”and “son of Mary.”The latter are strange titles for a barbarian and pagan king. His descendantClovis I became ruler over a united Gaul and eventually, after much prayer onthe part of the hermit monk Saint Remy, was converted to orthodox Christianity.This alliance helped stabilize the Western church. For 250 years, theMerovingian rulers were like priestkings, strangely above and exempt from thecensure of the church they supported. Their “mayors of the palace” handled theactual government. In the end, it was one of these mayors, Charlemagne’sgreat-grandfather, Pepin the Short, who finished off the main line of theMerovingian dynasty.But other Merovingian lines had survived, most prominently that of Neustria, theMerovingian kingdom that included Rheims and Paris. Descendants of theMerovingian kings had remained in control of the region as its dukes and even asthe mayor of Paris. It was almost inevitable that when the Carolingian line diedout, the kingship would revert to a descendant of the Merovingian line.A church council called by Archbishop Adalbero of Rheims and organized byGerbert of Aurillac decided the issue. Gerbert may in fact have done theresearch to prove Hugh Capet’s claim to Merovingian ancestry. The council foundthat Hugh Capet’s family were indeed descendants of the last king of Neustria,and therefore unanimously elected him the new king of France.The next year Archbishop Adalbero died and Gerbert rightly believed that heshould be his successor as archbishop of Rheims. Hugh Capet, ever thepolitician, gave the archbishop’s post to Arnulf, a bastard son of theCarolingian line. Hugh meant no insult; it was just politics. But it waspolitics that backfired. Arnulf plotted against Hugh, and in 991 a French churchcouncil deposed him and put Gerbert in his place.For the next four years, Gerbert used his position as archbishop of Rheims tosupport the growth of the peace movement. He also founded a variety of clericalorders—known collectively as the Chroniclers, or the chronicling orders—andlibraries in places far distant from Rheims, including Provence, Aquitaine,Lorraine, and Calabria in northern Italy. During this time, however, the Frenchchurch was fighting a fierce battle with the current pope, John XV, over whetherthey had the right to depose Arnulf.Faced with excommunication over the issue, Gerbert stepped down from thearchbishop’s post and moved from Rheims to join the young Otto III’s emergingcourt in Cologne. In 996, Otto III reached his majority and took over thegovernment with Gerbert of Aurillac by his side (fig. 5.4).image [images/image141-00.jpg]Figure 5.4. The coronation of Otto III. (From the Bamberg Apocalypse, StateLibrary, Bamberg, Germany)When Pope Gregory V died suddenly, in 999, it was inevitable that Gerbert wouldsucceed him. Gerbert had the support of the emperor, on the spot with histroops, as well as that of the abbot of Cluny, the leading force in both thereform movement and the Peace of God movement. Gerbert saw the coincidence ofthis alignment of forces as the fulfillment of a long-held dream and fullysupported his young protégé in his imperial designs. He became Pope SylvesterII, taking the name of Constantine’s pope, Sylvester I, to emphasize thesimilarity between the two emperors.With the emperor’s support, Gerbert, or Pope Sylvester, as we shall now callhim, plunged into a whirlwind of far-reaching negotiations. He expanded thereach of the Catholic Church into Eastern Europe, adding the area of Poland,Czechoslovakia, and Hungary by creating archbishoprics and converting kings.Vajk, the Magyar king of Hungary, was baptized as King Stephen, and eventuallybecame a saint. For his baptism, Sylvester sent him a holy crown to symbolizehis Christian kingship.In addition to converting Eastern Europe (perhaps as a bulwark against the pressof Asiatic refugees being pushed westward ahead of the early Tibetan/Mongolianinvasions), Sylvester was also interested in converting Islam. With that inmind, he made diplomatic contact with the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim in the year1000. To see the millennial significance that Sylvester and Otto attached to theturn of the year 1000, we need only look at the Bamberg Apocalypse, a manuscriptof great artistry that took three years to complete. It was presented to OttoIII on his way to Rome on the summer solstice of 1000 C.E. In this work, OttoIII is presented as the last emperor, the emperor of Armageddon. With this as acontext, we can see Otto’s global perspective and the vital importance ofFatimid Islam.The early Fatimid caliphs became fabulously wealthy after conquering Egypt inthe latter half of the tenth century. Al-Hakim ibn Aziz, who became caliph in996, the same year Otto III became emperor, inherited tremendous wealth andpower. In the end it was, along with other pressures perhaps, more than he couldbear. He went mad, declared himself a god, and died, disappeared, or wasassassinated sometime after 1021. But during his reign, far-reaching changesoccurred.Al-Hakim supported the Al Azhar Mosque and its growing university. He foundedthe Hall of Wisdom (see fig. 5.5), hired Mohammed ibn al-Haitham (Alhazen), theprobable inventor of the telescope, and helped Ali ibn Yunus publish hisastronomical tables. As much as diplomacy, it was these subjects that Sylvesterwanted to discuss. Al-Hakim, a ninth-degree Ismaili initiate,11[36_endnote-title.html#eee11] might just have had something to share with thebrilliant pope.In 1001, Sylvester arranged with the Fatimid caliph for a group of clerics andknights from his various chronicling orders to make an expedition to Syria andthe Holy Land. Various historians have from time to time pointed to this as thefirst wave of Crusaders, and just as quickly remarked on their lack ofaggressive zeal. Pope Sylvester’s Chroniclers, we are told in a twelfth-centurypapal sermon by John XIX, disappeared without accomplishing anything, except toserve as vassals of the caliph. This implies, of course, that they converted toIslam.Al-Maqqari, the foremost Muslim historian of the thirteenth century, tells usthat al-Hakim greeted the pope’s entourage with honor and spent many weeks inJerusalem discussing with them the virtues of Islam versus Christianity. He wasso impressed by their sincerity that the caliph gave them, in September 1002,the use of a Byzantine Greek church on the outskirts of Jerusalem for theirchapter house and library. Unfortunately, al-Maqqari doesn’t name the entourageor the location of their order, merely that they were there as chroniclers orhistorians.12 [36_endnote-title.html#eee12] By the time of the First Crusade,they were established in a Greek basilica on Mount Zion, with the name of TheOrder of Our Lady of Mount Zion. (See appendix C [33_chapter-title-20.html].)image [images/image143-00.jpg]Figure 5.5. The Hall of Wisdom at Al Azhar Mosque, from an eighteenth-centuryengraving.These were hardly Crusaders. The Muslim authorities do not record that theyconverted to Islam, but rather that al-Hakim honored them as Christians. Theycame not to conquer Jerusalem but to do research. We can only speculate on whatsubjects they researched.By the time his delegation had established itself in Jerusalem, Sylvesterhimself had been forced out of Rome by political terrorism. From northern Italy,Sylvester and Otto III struggled with a crumbling political situation. In 1003they both, within a few months of each other, died under suspiciouscircumstances. The dream of a united Roman Empire, as some kind of universalworld-state, appeared to die with them.But, in fact, the dream merely went underground for a few generations. To seethis, we must look at Sylvester’s legacy and his legend. Combining theseperspectives allows us to glimpse the outlines of an ambitious plan and even tonote the shuffling of ideas and events behind the official explanations.Sylvester died before the plan began to bear fruit, but the harvest wouldeventually bring a Christian king of Merovingian descent to the throne ofJerusalem.The most significant of Sylvester’s legacies was the Peace of God movement,which would inspire both the First Crusade and the newly emerging popularheresies, such as those professed by the Cathars and the Bogomils. Churchcouncils and lay preachers spread the idea throughout the West in the centuryafter Sylvester’s death, preparing the way for the call to crusade. Both thePeasants’ Crusade and its leader, Peter the Hermit, had their origins in thePeace of God movement. Peter the Hermit may, in fact, have had a directconnection with Sylvester’s shadowy group of monks and chroniclers.One of these monks, Richer, of the Order of Saint Remy (the saint who convertedClovis I to Christianity), has left us a portrait of Sylvester’s teachings thatcontains the spark of the legend. Richer tells us, among a list of Gerbert’saccomplishments, that he had long studied the hermetic arts. From this remarkgrew the legend of an alchemist pope.The most persistent story, first told in the thirteenth century, has Gerbert,while still archbishop of Rheims, constructing a magical bronze “head” thatforetells the future. The “head,” of course, announces that Gerbert will indeedbe pope, which, considering his shaky position as archbishop, was a boldprediction. A similar story of a bronze head would be told about other medievalmagicians, including Roger Bacon and Albertus Magnus. It also suggests, in anindirect way, the “head” the Templars were supposed to have worshipped, themysterious Baphomet.These similarities are not accidents, but glimpses of the design behind thesymbols. Richer, in his Histories, gives us the clue. In the sentence after hementions Gerbert’s hermetic accomplishments, we are told that Gerbert had alsodesigned an armillary sphere with which he could determine the location of thesun and the planets in relation to the celestial sphere. Interestingly enough,the earth in this model was round, five hundred years before Columbus.Later, as pope, Sylvester designed and commissioned a new armillary sphere, akind of small-scale planetarium, incorporating the information in Ali ibnYunus’s tables. The new sphere showed the plane of the ecliptic, the Milky Way,and the ecliptic and planetary poles (fig. 5.6). It was, in simple terms, abronze machine for calculating the secret of time, alchemy’s third component. Insymbolic terms, this sphere of knowledge became the “head” possessed by allfamed students of the art in the Middle Ages.The mysterious name of the Templar’s “head,” to briefly jump ahead of our story,confirms this assumption. Baphomet, phonetically in Arabic, Aramaic, and Hebrew,is simply bet’amet, or “place of truth.” The root ba or bet is the same as theba in Baal, and can signify a house, a place, or the action of filling space.The “place of truth” used as a title could well be meant to signify thespace-filling “house” of the Cube of Space in the celestial sphere and the valueof its prophetic insight. Over time, the simple phrase became a code word forthe secret itself. The Templars did not worship their bronze head; theymeditated on it and studied it closely for clues about the secret of time andthe timing of their alchemical operations.image [images/image145-00.jpg]Figure 5.6. An eighteenth-century engraving of Pope Sylvester’s armillarysphere, the prototype of the Templars’ bet’amet, or Baphomet.Another of Sylvester’s chronicling monks, Rodulphus Glaber, jump-started thepilgrimage movement with his fanciful account of the millenarian activitiessurrounding the year 1033, the one thousandth anniversary of Christ’s death.While not completely true—we might call it propaganda today—Glaber’s tale ofcosmic portents and massive pilgrimages to Jerusalem gave voice to the anxietiesof its age. A great desire arose in all classes of society to participate in theupcoming millennium, not just wait passively for its arrival. It was thisfeeling that animated the First Crusade. Conquering Jerusalem brought themillennium one step closer.The tale of the pope, the emperor, and the caliph remains largely hidden in thefragments strewn through a thousand years of secrecy and internal strife amongthe holders of various pieces of the secret. Pope Sylvester started a ballrolling that, in a few hundred years, would change beyond recognition the faceof European culture. The Crusades opened the East directly to the West, and thehand of Sylvester’s design played a part in all of it. Without Sylvester, theremight never have been a Crusade. And without Sylvester’s Fatimid connections andhis chroniclers in Jerusalem, there would certainly never have been an Order ofthe Knights of the Temple.The Templars are the point where the political current started by the alchemistpope surfaces into the historical record. The history of the Templars,particularly their mysterious origins and their unaccountedfor wealth, providesfor myriad suggestive connections. Without the Templars, there would have beenno cathedral-building movement, nor the money to pay for it. From the point ofview of our research, without the Templars, there might not have been any suchthing as “alchemy” to investigate.PETER THE HERMIT, THE FIRST CRUSADE, AND THE ROCK OF ZIONOur word crusade comes from the Spanish word cruzada, meaning “marked with thecross.” The Crusaders were indeed marked by the cross in more than just thedesign emblazoned on their tunics. They were inflamed by a new vision ofChristianity, one in which there was work to do—the kind of work thesemibarbarian kings of the West understood best, warfare. The First Crusadestands as a kind of human monument to belief in the end of the world.Sylvester and Otto III had tried to build a new unified world-state from thefragments of the ancient world. They saw this state, which perhaps was meant toinclude the Fatimids as well, as a bulwark against the rising tide of refugeesfrom eastern Europe and western Asia. In central Europe, these refugees wereKazars, or what would become the Ashkenazi Jews; in Asia Minor, they were knownas the Seljuks. These migratory pressures threatened the Byzantine Empire atConstantinople as well the Fatimid control of Palestine. The Western Empire,reviving under Otto III and Sylvester, created the Christian kingdoms of easternEurope—Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary—as a barrier to further invasionsfrom the East.United, the three parts of the early medieval world, the twoRomes—Constantinople being the second Rome—and the Fatimids, could have resistednot just the pressure of the Turks but also that of the later Mongol invasions.As it happened, however, the Seljuk Turks conquered Palestine in 1071 andthreatened the stability of the entire world when they turned on Constantinople.After a disastrous defeat, the Byzantine Empire made a humiliating peace and wasleft with very little of Asia Minor. The Empire had been saved, but the way toConstantinople was open to the next wave of Turkish invaders.At this point, a mysterious figure surfaces to begin his career as one of theprinciple movers and shakers of the First Crusade. In 1088, Peter the Hermit wasan unknown monk belonging to one of the clerical or chronicling orders.Curiously, its name has not come down to us, but his appearance on the scenesuggests connections at the highest level. That year, Peter the Hermit traveledfrom Jerusalem to deliver an impassioned plea from Simeon, the patriarch ofJerusalem, to the newly elected pope Urban II (see fig. 5.7). This plea for aidfrom the West and its offer of reconciliation between the churches wouldcertainly not have been entrusted to a simple itinerant preacher. Thepatriarch’s letter caused years of intense discussion within the Church and setthe tone for Urban’s papacy.In early 1095, Alexius I, the Byzantine emperor, sensing weakness in the currentSeljuk infighting, sent an envoy to Pope Urban II and the council at Piacenzaasking for military aid from the West. Urban II was intrigued by theopportunities these entreaties provided, for perhaps the old Sylvestrian schemeof a united world-state could actually be achieved. Urban departed on asix-month tour of northern Italy and southern France collecting support. InAugust, from Le Puy in southern France, a Church council was called for Novemberat Clermont in Auvergne, not far from the small monastery of Aurillac.image [images/image148-00.jpg]Figure 5.7. Peter the Hermit preaching the Crusade. (From a fifteenth-centurymanuscript illustration, Bridgeman Art Library)Exactly what Urban had in mind and what he expected from the Clermont council isunclear. He seems to have intended a military expedition, not unlike those hehad already sanctioned in Muslim Spain. What he got was something entirelydifferent.Urban II, born Odo of Chatillon-sur-Marne and a former prior of Cluny, was a manof broad views, an experienced organizer, and a skilled diplomat dedicated tothe program of reforms of his predecessor, Gregory VII. Unlike Gregory, whosefiery intensity seemed to leave no one untouched, Urban was supremely human, amedieval pop star of a pope, tall, handsome, socially at ease, andaristocratically distinguished. His overall goal was to reform the WesternChurch and reunite it with the Eastern Church to create a truly catholic, oruniversal, Christianity.13 [36_endnote-title.html#eee13] Toward that end,Alexius I’s request for military aid looked like a major breakthrough. Urban wasalso influenced by the Peace of God movement, which attempted to curtailviolence and warfare on certain days of the week and on feast days of thesaints, and saw the call to arms against the “accursed race, wholly alienatedfrom God,” as he called the Turks in his speech to the crowd at Clermont (seefig. 5.8), as a way to mitigate and channel the violence of the Europeannobility.image [images/image149-00.jpg]Figure 5.8. Eighteenth-century engraving of the Council of Clermont.On Tuesday morning, November 27, 1095, thousands had gathered to hear the pope’spronouncement. Itinerant monks and lay preachers had spread the word of thepublic session for months. When the day arrived, the crowd was far too great forthe cathedral, so the meeting was held outdoors, in a field near the easterngate of the city. After the multitude had gathered, Urban II climbed up on araised platform and addressed them.Four contemporary chroniclers reported Urban’s words. One of them, Robert theMonk, claimed to have been there and heard the words as Urban spoke them. It ishis version that we will paraphrase. He tells us that Urban began by calling onthe Franks—“O race of Franks! race beloved and chosen by God!” Robert records—tocome to the aid of their brethren in the East. Eastern Christendom had appealedfor aid; the Turks were advancing into Christian territory, killing anddesecrating as they came. Urban stressed the holiness of Jerusalem and thesuffering of the pilgrims who journeyed there. Having painted a somber pictureof conditions in the East, Urban made his appeal: Let Western Christendom marchto the rescue. Let rich and poor march together and leave off killing each otherfor the greater good of killing the godless Turks. This was the work of God,Urban declared, and there would be absolution and remission of sins for thosewho died in this most holy of causes. There must be no delay; let everyone beready to march by the summer. God will be their guide.14[36_endnote-title.html#eee14]Urban, speaking in French to his fellow Frenchmen, rose to levels of eloquencethat the Latin of the chroniclers cannot convey.15 [36_endnote-title.html#eee15]The enthusiasm, however, was beyond anything that even Urban had expected. Aroar of “Dieu li volt,” or God wills it, swept through the crowd even beforeUrban finished his speech. At its conclusion, the bishop of Le Puy fell to hisknees, begging permission to join the expedition. Thousands followed hisexample.The pope was caught off guard. No plans had yet been made, certainly noarrangements for a mass movement such as erupted over the winter of 1095–96.While Urban reassembled his bishops to make the political arrangements, a groupof wandering evangelists began to spread the word. Foremost among them was Peterthe Hermit.The shadowy figure of Peter the Hermit, an enigma even to his contemporaries,haunts the story of the First Crusade. We have seen him in 1088 delivering amessage from the patriarch of Jerusalem to Pope Urban. Later, historians woulddoubt this story because of Peter’s humble background and apparentinsignificance. And yet there is something about the mysterious rabble-rousingmonk that suggests powerful connections and important supporters. Piecingtogether his career gives us a glimpse of the hidden machinations behind theCrusades.Peter was born around the middle of the eleventh century in Picardy, possiblynear Amiens. Before becoming a monk, Peter was a minor noble who owed his fiefto Eustace de Boulogne, father of Godfroi de Bouillon, the future king ofJerusalem. Sometime after 1070, Peter joined a monastery in the Ardennes, wherefor a few years he served as tutor to the young Godfroi. Sometime after 1080, hedeparted on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, where he apparently stayed until hismission to Rome in 1088. Nothing is known of his whereabouts until the winter of1095, when he began to preach the new crusade at Bourges, in the province ofBerry. He apparently did not attend the Church council at Clermont.Keeping in mind the work of Pope Sylvester II and his various chroniclingorders, a pattern emerges from the shadows of Peter’s story. Peter joined theonly group of monks in the Ardennes, at Orval, near Stenay, a site with richMerovingian connections, whose patron was Godfroi’s aunt and foster mother. Thisgroup of monks was part of a mysterious order of chroniclers from Calabria, innorthern Italy, who seemed mostly concerned with researching the bloodline ofthe duke of Lorraine, Godfroi’s family.If these monks were among the chroniclers established by Pope Sylvester, then itis easy to understand the many curious twists in Peter’s career, such as hislong sojourn in Jerusalem. He could have been transferred to the order’s chapterthere, the one established outside the city in a basilica given to them by themad caliph al-Hakim. This makes sense in light of Peter’s later diplomaticmission, for only a high-ranking member of a clerical order, founded by the popehimself, would be a fitting enough representative to deliver messages from thepatriarch of Jerusalem and the Eastern Church.Peter’s silence between 1088 and 1095 may have been enforced by the dictates ofhis order. Only after the Church council, and its demonstration of massapproval, was Peter the Hermit given permission to begin his own crusade.Before the year was out, Peter was in Berry, in central France, preaching hisown version of the Holy War, one in which the poor and the pious in Christ wouldsweep ahead of the nobles and conquer Jerusalem with only God’s assistance.Guibert of Nogent, who knew him personally, gives us a glimpse of Peter’sauthority: “Everything he said or did, it seemed like something half-divine.”16[36_endnote-title.html#eee16] This unkempt, fiery-tempered monk, who habituallywent about barefoot and in filthy rags, was also a spellbinding orator capableof moving masses of people to extremes of emotion. They took the cross by thethousands and followed this Rasputin-like character down the long road to theEast.In January, Peter left Berry and traveled through Orleans and Champagne,gathering crowds whenever he stopped. In Lorraine, he visited his old monasterynear Orval and discussed the crusade with his old pupil Godfroi de Bouillon. Norecord remains of their conversations, but something convinced Godfroi to jointhe crusade. By spring, as Peter collected his people’s army in Cologne, OttoIII’s old capital, Godfroi took the cross at Amiens. Unlike the other nobles whoparticipated in the First Crusade, Godfroi renounced his fiefs, sold his goods,and moved with his brothers to the Holy Land. Godfroi did not intend to return;perhaps he already saw himself as the chief candidate for king of Jerusalem.Godfroi wasn’t the only noble of ancient lineage taking the cross that summer.The group was officially under the leadership of the bishop of Le Puy, Adhemar,as papal legate, and included Raymond of Toulouse, a veteran of the Spanishwars; Hugh of Vermandois and Robert II of Flanders; and Robert, duke ofNormandy, and his brother-in-law, the hapless Stephan, count of Blois. InSeptember of 1096, word reached Urban that the Normans of southern Italy andSicily were ready to take up the cross. These Normans, led by Bohemund and hisnephew Tancred, brought the most experienced and capable soldiers in Europe tothe crusading movement. Bohemund’s father, Roger of Guiscard, had almostconquered Constantinople itself a few years before, and the Normans scentedopportunity in the call to the East.The long story of the First Crusade, and its People’s Crusade prologue, is toldin many places. The best of all the histories is still Sir Steven Runciman’smultivolume work on the entire crusading era.17 [36_endnote-title.html#eee17]For our purposes, we shall concentrate on Peter the Hermit and his studentGodfroi de Bouillon.The People’s Crusade, after a tortuous journey across central Europe, arrived atthe gates of Constantinople in the spring of 1097, a hungry and uncontrollablemob. The emperor shipped them over to the Asian side of the straits, where theyrashly attacked a Turkish stronghold and were annihilated. Peter the Hermitwisely stayed in Constantinople and therefore survived. He was still there, andheld in some honor, when the next wave of Crusaders arrived.As the crusading princes gathered in Constantinople, Peter joined them with theremnants of his army. Perhaps because of his old association with Godfroi, bythis point the acknowledged leader of the Crusade, Peter was respected as avisionary and councilor to the group. He marched on with them to Antioch, wherehe played a part in the drama of the Holy Spear, a bizarre intervention of thesupernatural involving the discovery of an iron spearhead in the church. AfterAntioch, Peter joined with the Tafars, or poor ones, in calling for a speedyadvance on Jerusalem.After the fall of Jerusalem, Peter was one of the secret council, perhaps evenits leader, who chose Godfroi as the king of Jerusalem. Godfroi declined thetitle, preferring instead that of Defender of the Holy Sepulchre, but in 1100his younger brother, Baldwin, accepted the title readily. During Godfroi’sreign, Peter the Hermit was held in such high regard that when the Crusaderspushed on to Ascalon, he was left in charge of Jerusalem. Before Godfroi leftJerusalem, almost his sole official act as king was to reconfirm the charter ofan abbey on Mount Zion, south of the city and outside of its walls, and orderits immediate fortification.Peter the Hermit divided his time between the court at Constantinople and thenewly rebuilt abbey on Mount Zion, where he is believed to have died, in 1115.The great French historian of the Crusades, René Grousset, commented thatGodfroi’s throne was founded on the rock of Zion, and that it indicated a royaltradition equal to that of the reigning dynasties of Europe. Grousset, however,does not explain his comment, leaving of us to speculate on its meaning.18[36_endnote-title.html#eee18]Urban’s plans for military aid for the Eastern Church were subverted by Peterthe Hermit and his followers’ insistence on a people’s crusade. This popularmovement swept control of the expedition out of papal hands and into the handsof military and political leaders. When Adhemar, the papal legate, died atAntioch, a council of such leaders took over. Peter was a part of that counciland was perhaps instrumental in electing Godfroi king. The First Crusade changedfrom a papal expedition to something different, a popular movement withmillenarian expectations, and Peter the Hermit was at the heart of that change.If Peter was indeed a high-ranking member of one of the surviving chroniclingorders started by Sylvester II, who were charged with researching theMerovingian bloodline, then his influence becomes understandable. Sylvester’schronicling orders had been working for almost a century to create a new kingdomof Jerusalem, and then, suddenly, the means were at hand. All that was neededwas a candidate for king whose bloodline was such that all the kings of Europecould acknowledge him as overlord.Godfroi may have filled the bill because the Chroniclers believed him to be adescendant of the lost line of Merovingian kings and therefore perhaps a directdescendant of Solomon and the House of David, and perhaps even Jesus himself.That would in fact, if proved, make him the rightful king of Jerusalem, andperhaps of the world. It would at least fulfill a great many apocalypticexpectations and could be seen as the first steps toward the Kingdom of Heavenon earth so beloved of the chiliasts.The rock of Zion could be Peter (petros, or “rock” in Greek) the Hermit of theOrder of Zion, to whom both Godfroi and Baldwin directly owed their thrones.This explanation becomes even more plausible if Peter, as the officialrepresentative of Zion and the Chroniclers, thus functioned as guarantor oftheir legitimacy as descendants of the Davidic line. Mount Zion itself seems themost likely candidate for the location of the original order. Al-Hakim donatedto Sylvester’s Chroniclers a Greek church somewhere outside the walls, but stillclose enough for access to the city. Mount Zion, which contains the ruins of afourth-century basilica rebuilt in the early eleventh century, seems the mostobvious choice. A group of monks were apparently still there in 1099, and mayhave played a part in the fall of the city. This “rock of Zion” and itsconnections in Europe could also be considered the foundation of the dynasty.But, as we shall see, there could in fact be another “rock of Zion” on which thekingdom of Jerusalem was built.THE SECRET OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMONThe authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail deserve credit for their discoveriesconcerning the role played by the Order, or Priory, of Zion in the creation ofthe Templars. Just as they were right about the unusual and probably Hebraicorigins of the Merovingians, they were correct, as far as they went, about themysterious precursors to the Templars who occupied Mount Zion. While not goingback far enough to uncover the pivotal role played by Pope Sylvester II, HolyBlood, Holy Grail’s facts about the Order of Our Lady of Zion are suggestive.By the time the Templars arrived on the scene, in 1118 or 1119, the Order ofZion was already a powerful group with close ties to the kings of Jerusalem.These ties were based, in all probability, on the order’s knowledge of thedynasty’s true heritage. Therefore, the secret at the heart of the Templars’sudden rise in the medieval world was due to more than just, as Holy Blood, HolyGrail suggests, knowledge of Jesus’ descendants. Once again something more isinvolved.The missing piece appears to be alchemy. The Merovingians, whether or not theywere descended from Christ, were indeed practical alchemists and wizard kings.Sylvester II, the hermetic pope, was on the verge of recovering the secret whenpower politics overwhelmed him.19 [36_endnote-title.html#eee19] The motivationfor the First Crusade, deeply hidden behind religious and politicalrationalizations, was actually the search for and recovery of the secret,envisioned perhaps as an artifact or relic. A Merovingian king on the throne ofJerusalem was just the first step in bringing about the millennium. Next wouldcome the rebuilding of the Temple, based on the philosopher’s stone, the stonethe builders rejected.This was the true mission of the Templars, and Holy Blood, Holy Grail is partlycorrect. The secret did involve the bloodline. The authors of Holy Blood, HolyGrail rarely mention alchemy, however, even though several supposed grandmasters of Zion are prominent alchemists. Only once in the entire book doesalchemy come to the forefront: in discussing the Templars and their mysterious“head.” Whatever the Templars were trying to accomplish, the recovery of a lostsecret was the central and critical component of their plans.20[36_endnote-title.html#eee20]By the end of the second decade of the twelfth century, most of the veterans ofthe First Crusade were dead. Godfroi de Bouillon, exhausted by his labors, diedthe year after the fall of Jerusalem, in 1100. Peter the Hermit had died in1115, and Baldwin I, Godfroi’s brother, followed him in 1118. Things werechanging in Outremer, the land beyond the sea, as the Franks called Palestine.Latin kingdoms, including Jerusalem, had been established from Syria to Gaza,but if they were to remain independent, it was time to look to their collectivesecurity.With this in mind, soon after his coronation, Baldwin II, cousin of Godfroi andBaldwin, legitimized the only standing army in the Holy Land. Not being a trulyfeudal lord, in the sense that Europe understood it, the king of Jerusalem hadonly his personal retainers and whatever Crusaders happened to be available withwhom to form an army. This left the kingdom of Jerusalem somewhat defenseless,as demonstrated by the Easter massacre of pilgrims by Turkish forces in 1119. Asa reaction to this, Baldwin II turned to the only organized military force inthe Holy Land, the militia of the Order of Our Lady of Zion, for protection.That this milice du Christ existed before 1119 is shown by the reference to itin a letter from the bishop of Chartres to Hugh, count of Champagne, dated 1114.In the period immediately after the First Crusade’s conquest of Jerusalem, theonly source of authority in the devastated city came from the remainingreligious communities, among them the Order of Mount Zion. We know that Peterthe Hermit was left in charge of the city while Godfroi went on to defeat theEgyptians at Ascalon, which, if Peter was a monk of Zion, meant that the orderwas actually in control. That the existing Order of Mount Zion had some militaryvalue is shown by Godfroi’s insistence on repairing its fortifications. Someonemust have manned those defenses after they were built.Given the unstable situation in Outremer, Baldwin II made the right choice. Herecognized the military arm of the order, put them under the control of the kingand the patriarch of Jerusalem, and installed them close at hand, next door tohis palace on Temple Mount. The Poor Knights of Christ, as they calledthemselves, gained another name from Baldwin’s gift. They became the PoorKnights of the Temple of Solomon, then Knights of the Temple, or KnightsTemplar, and, finally, the Templars. Their stated purpose was to protect thepilgrim routes, but their numbers were too few in the beginning to protect morethan the area around the Temple ruins. And perhaps that’s all they were intendedto do.To understand the Templars and their role in the Holy Land and Europe, we mustsee them in their proper perspective, that of a military adjunct to a much olderorganization. The Order of Our Lady of Zion did not create the Templars. Theking of Jerusalem created them out of the order’s militia for a specificpurpose.The order itself had been reconfirmed and given its new name by Godfroi in 1099.Five years later, a private conclave of nobles and clergy assembled at Troyes,the court of the count of Champagne, to hear a mysterious abbot from Jerusalemand to discuss conditions in the Holy Land. Nothing is known of the subject ofthat discussion, but whatever it was, the wealthy and powerful Hugh, count ofChampagne, decided to depart immediately for Jerusalem. He spent the next fouryears in the Holy Land, his activities and whereabouts unknown.The location of the conclave in Troyes is highly significant. Peter the Hermithad stopped there on his winter preaching tour in 1096, and the family of thecount of Champagne had been of interest to the Chroniclers because of itsconnections with the Merovingian dynasty of Burgundy. Indeed, the reportednobles who attended the conclave, Brienne, Joinville, Chaumont, and Montbard,all have connections to the ancient Burgundian royal family. This alone would beenough to make one suspect that the mysterious Jerusalem abbot was from theOrder of Zion.Hugh, count of Champagne, remained in the Holy Land for four years. On hisreturn to Champagne, things began to unfold rapidly. A distant relative, Bernardde Montbard, joined the Cistercian Order. Bernard, in just a few years, wouldbecome the principle spiritual leader of Western Christendom. His abbey atClairvaux, donated by Hugh in 1112, became the center of the medieval spiritualrevival, inspiring a wave of religious feeling that resulted in the glories ofthe Gothic cathedrals. Saint Bernard, as he would come to be known, played a keyrole in the establishment and the legitimization of the Templars. His uncleAndré de Montbard was one of the militia of Zion from which the Templars wereformed.Hugh of Champagne himself wanted to return to the Holy Land and join the order’smilitia. The letter from the bishop of Chartres in 1114 was part of an attemptto dissuade him. Apparently his talents were needed in Champagne, and it was notuntil 1124 that he officially joined the newly renamed Order of the Temple. Bythat time, the Templars were solidly established with the support of a nowwealthy and powerful Cistercian Order, headed by Bernard. In 1128, the Templarswere recognized by the pope, Honorius II, and given a written rule or guide fortheir order by none other than Bernard himself. The council at which thisoccurred was held, of course, in Troyes at the court of the count of Champagne.From these meager facts we are forced to intuit the story. The Order of theChroniclers on Mount Zion appears to be the shadowy force directing the FirstCrusade, mostly through the activities and influence of Peter the Hermit. Afterthe Crusaders captured Jerusalem, the order, through Peter, was left in virtualcharge of the city and its monuments and churches. As we have seen, Godfroi andBaldwin were beholden to Zion for their thrones, and therefore would haveallowed the order free access to anywhere in the city they wanted to explore orexcavate. Sometimes during the five years from the conquest to the conclave inTroyes, the order discovered the secret it had been seeking for over a century.Zion sent word of this discovery back to Europe, not to Rome or any of the othercapitals, but to Troyes. Whatever this discovery was, it so moved Hugh that heleft for Jerusalem and spent four years in secret studying it. Immediately afterhis return in 1108, the wheels of power moved so that one of his adherents, theyoung Bernard of Montbard, became the head of an orthodox monastic order. WhenBernard joined the Cistercians, they were almost bankrupt. Within a decade theywere the wealthiest monastic order in Europe, with money to fund the creation ofa whole new style of architecture, the Gothic cathedrals.21[36_endnote-title.html#eee21]Therefore, in some way, this discovery of a secret or an artifact led to a flowof unparalleled wealth a few years later. From this discovery and its flow ofwealth would come the need for the Templars, whose first and basic activityseemed to be guarding the precinct of Solomon’s Temple. But the mere secrets ofalchemy alone, even an ancient Solomonic version, would not of themselvesproduce a flow of wealth. Something else was required. As the later alchemistsinform us, nothing can be accomplished in the Great Work without the right primamateria. It is possible that what the Order of Zion found, perhaps in the ruinsof the Temple of Solomon, was the best prima materia possible, a piece of theBlack Stone, the meteorite from Mecca.22 [36_endnote-title.html#eee22] Justpossibly, this was the true “rock of Zion” on which the kingdom of Jerusalem wasfounded.Some modern authors tracing the Templar connection with alchemy have suggestedthat the Templars discovered the Ark of the Covenant in the ruins of Solomon’sTemple, which perhaps contained a stone from heaven, or meteorite, similar tothe Black Stone of Mecca.23 [36_endnote-title.html#eee23] This, however, seemshighly unlikely, given that the Ark disappeared from the temple in the seventhcentury B.C.E.24 [36_endnote-title.html#eee24] But a discovery of something likeone of the stones contained in the Ark is a somewhat more likely proposition.The Order of Chroniclers was given the use of Mount Zion by the mad caliphal-Hakim. Al-Hakim’s great-grandfather, al-Mansur, was the first and only personsince Muhammad known to have close personal contact with the Black Stone. Itstayed in his presence for months after it was presented to him and before itwas returned to the Kaaba. Most significant, we cannot be sure how much of thestone was returned.The Iranian Ismailis, soon to become friends and allies of the Templars, mayhave kept a piece before it was given to al-Mansur. The Fatimid caliph himselfmay have decided to keep a piece. That the stone shrank in its absence from theKaaba is known from Muslim descriptions of the building of the ninth and tenthKaabas, which tell us that the stone was large and filled the entire space ofthe southeast corner, protruding so that one did not have to stoop to kiss it.In the current Kaaba, as described by Sir Richard Francis Burton in thenineteenth century, the stone is encased within the wall, leaving only a portionabout seven inches long and four inches wide exposed for kissing. Since it wasremoved from the Kaaba only for those brief years in the midtenth century, anycarving or splitting of the stone had to have been done at that time.25[36_endnote-title.html#eee25]The madness of al-Hakim can be explained by his possession of hisgreat-grandfather’s chunk of the stone. Shi’ite tradition claimed that at theturn of the fourth century after the Hejira, or departure from Mecca, the Mahdi,or savior, would appear and convert the entire world to Islam as a prologue tothe Day of Judgment. In 1020, al-Hakim, the foremost Shi’ite leader of his day,announced the arrival of the Mahdi in his own, now divine, person.26[36_endnote-title.html#eee26] It was the year 400 A.H. If indeed al-Hakim had apiece of the rock, sign of the holy covenant with Abraham, then it is possiblethat this knowledge could have unhinged the caliph enough for him to convincehimself of his own divinity. Fearing the stone’s power, al-Hakim could havehidden it on the Dome of the Rock, perhaps within the ruins of Solomon’s Temple,in Jerusalem.If the stone was in Jerusalem the whole time, why did it take a Crusade for theOrder of Zion to gain possession of it? One reason lies in the madness ofal-Hakim. As part of his Mahdi-hood, he persecuted the Christians and the Jews,burning their churches and synagogues. Even though he repented of thedestruction before his death or disappearance, access to the Dome of the Rockand the Temple Mount itself was restricted to Muslims from that time onward.Once the Seljuk Turks conquered the city, all access to the Holy Sites wasrestricted. And at that point, Peter, the Hermit of Mount Zion, departed for theWest to start the political process that, eleven years later, would bring theorder back into control of the Temple and the Dome of the Rock.Sometime between 1099 and 1104, it is possible that the Order of Zion made atleast two discoveries, either together or separately, in Jerusalem. The firstwas perhaps a text explaining the mechanics of the physics of creation and itsapplication to the process of transmutation. The second might well have been themad caliph’s piece of the Black Stone. Word of this discovery was sent back toFrance, where, upon receiving the information, Hugh of Champagne and hisentourage, possibly including a few Hebrew scholars, departed immediately forJerusalem.Between 1104 and 1112, the Order of Zion completed its work and perfected theprocess of transformation. From 1112 onward, money in great quantities flowedback to France and into the coffers of Bernard’s Cistercians. A power base wasbuilt on this wealth that forced Baldwin II to legitimize the military wing ofthe order to protect his throne. The Templars were formed to guard the source ofthis wealth, the alchemical processes that were perhaps being conducted in thecellars of the great Temple.While this view of events is admittedly speculative, it does have the value, aswe shall see in the next chapter, of addressing some of the key images andmotifs found in the Grail legends and the Bahir, which emerged in the West atthe same place and at the same time. It also answers the many questions thatgather around all facets of the Templars’ history. And it points up a trulycurious fact. Before the Templars, alchemy was a decidedly theoretical science.After the Templars, we find documented tales of actual transmutation. Theconclusion is forced upon us that something resembling our speculations mustindeed have occurred.The Templars continued to gain power in Europe at the same time as theCistercians were beginning their cathedral-building program. Both of thesemovements were financed from mysterious sources, and both had indirect and hazyconnections to the Order of Our Lady of Zion. It is possible to see SaintBernard and the Cistercians as the spiritual and social parts of a great plan torevitalize Western culture. The Templars were the political and militarycomponents of that plan, protecting the secret and its source of wealth. Thecathedrals, those vast alchemical monuments in stone, were designed tofacilitate the new spiritual change necessary as a prelude to the comingthousand years of peace and prosperity.The history of the Templars from 1128 until their demise is well documented andtoo familiar to need much further elaboration. By 1143, the Templars had becomethe exclusive military arm of the papacy, and remained a powerful force inOutremer even after the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin in 1187. Holy Blood, HolyGrail suggests that the Order of Zion split from the Templars at the Cutting ofthe Elm at Gisors in 1188, and this seems accurate given the further history ofboth orders. The Order of Zion, after losing its abbey on Mount Zion, seems tohave moved to France, with chapters in Orleans, Bourges, Paris, and Troyes.27[36_endnote-title.html#eee27]For a century after the discoveries in the Holy Land, alchemy remained thesecret preserve of the initiates within the Church. The Order of Zion and theTemplars seem to have had their own alchemical processes and their ownindividual codes for referring to them. Not until the middle of the thirteenthcentury did alchemy surface in a direct and unambiguous way.The greatest scholar of the thirteenth century, Albert the Great of Cologne, orAlbertus Magnus, turned to alchemy around 1250 and produced the first originalwork on the subject since the late fifth century. His treatise On Alchemychampions alchemy as a difficult but true art. He does not tell us if heactually made gold, but his directions to the practitioner indicate not onlyknowledge of the triple nature of alchemy, but also an awareness of the changesin the political winds. He warns the alchemist to choose the right hour for hisoperations, to be patient and diligent in his prayers and exhortations, tooperate by the rules (here Albert gives us the necessary steps: trituration,sublimation, fixation, calcination, solution, distillation, and coagulation,seven in all), and always to avoid contact with princes and rulers.28[36_endnote-title.html#eee28]Albert was also reputed to have had a fortune-telling “head” and seems bycontemporary accounts to have been an adept of the Hebraic work of creation. Weare told that he had constructed an artificial man, a golem, endowed with theability to speak but not to reason. The golem’s inane chattering so disturbedAlbert’s pupil, the future saint Thomas of Aquinas, that Albert finally had todestroy it. Another interesting alchemical story, related by William II, countof Holland, has Albert setting a feast in the frozen and snow-covered garden ofthe monastery, only to have it magically become summer, with birds, butterflies,and blossoming trees, as the diners sat down to their meal.29[36_endnote-title.html#eee29]Intriguing as these suggestions are, it was not the aristocratic Albert theGreat who brought alchemy firmly into the mainstream of medieval thought, butrather the humble scholar Arnold of Villanova. Arnold was born in Valencia aboutthe time that Notre-Dame-de-Paris was finished. He gained his initial fame as aphysician and could be called the first psychologist, having written asurprisingly modern work on the interpretation of dreams. Although seemingly nota member of any monastic or clerical order, Arnold conducted secret missions forkings, emperors, and popes alike.30 [36_endnote-title.html#eee30]In his works, Arnold emphasized the reality of alchemical transformation. Todemonstrate this, he performed a transmutation in front of Pope Boniface VIII.It was successful, the first documented account of such a transmutation. Awitness, John Andre, the major domo of the Papal Curia, reports that Arnold“submitted the gold sticks he produced to everyone for examination.”31[36_endnote-title.html#eee31] This is very significant for the simple reasonthat since the second century, no one, no matter how much he seemed to knowabout alchemy, had actually done the transmutation in front of witnesses.Arnold’s performance in front of Boniface was the turning point in alchemicalhistory. Unfortunately, it was also the beginning of the end for the Templarsand, in a lesser way, for the Order of Zion.One of those observing Arnold’s transmutation was the future pope Clement V.Bertrand de Got, the former archbishop of Bordeaux, became the first pope of theso-called French captivity after the strife caused by Boniface VIII’s assertionof absolute papal rights. The king of France, asserting a higher spiritual andpolitical authority than the pope, swooped down on Rome and literally capturedthe Church. Eleven months later, Bertrand, a Frenchman, was finally elected asClement V. Arnold, unfortunately, had been in the thick of the politicalinfighting.32 [36_endnote-title.html#eee32]Philip, the French king, used his power over the pope to recall Boniface’sproclamation. And then the king set in motion an idea that had been stirring inhis brain since Arnold’s demonstration. The king called a general council andproscribed the Templars. Pope Clement V, wanting his piece of the vast Templarwealth, went along with Philip, even though he knew the charges against theTemplars were basically groundless. The Templars thus ran afoul of a greedyFrench king and his puppet of a pope and were persecuted as heretics. Just asthe missing link in the Templars’ origin appears to be alchemy, so does itappear that their downfall was also caused by alchemy.The Grail romances provide us with direct connections to the Templars asguardians of the secret, as well as glimpses of the “miraculous stone” at theheart of the mystery and a general tone of transformation and transmutation as asubtext. The sudden emergence of the long secret “illumination” sect, the sagesof the Bahir, in a public form in the West, supplies us with the missingphilosophical and kabbalistic clue needed to see the larger pattern of whatmight be called astro-alchemy, which, as Fulcanelli informs us, was in turnmemorialized in the Gothic cathedrals.During the height of their influence, from 1150 to the fall of Jerusalem in1187, three different facets of the alchemical secret surfaced in the West andproduced a kind of Gothic renaissance. In this emergence, the book and stone ofthe Templars and the Grail romances became the book in stone of the Gothiccathedrals. Behind this transformation is the theology of Light as expressed inthe Bahir and made real in the lux continua architectural style of the newcathedrals.By the time Notre-Dame-de-Paris’ external decorations—including the magnificentbas-relief rendition of Alchemy itself on the Great Porch—were finished in 1235,the need for subterfuge was thought to have passed. The imperial and orthodoxChurch of Rome was in ascendancy, with both the Templars and the Order of Zionchastised by the crusade against the Cathars, and struggling to find a newmission. Power politics had also stabilized, somewhat, with the Holy RomanEmpire as top dog of the feudal pack. The Middle Ages were reaching for theirapogee, while falling, at the same time, far short of the glorious millennialvisions of Sylvester II and the pilgrim-warriors of the First Crusade. Littledid either the sponsors of these great works or the guilds that created themrealize that within a hundred years this renaissance would end in death,betrayal, wars, and natural disasters that would plunge Europe back into amini-version of the Dark Ages. As Europe recovered from this disaster in thefifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the flowering of the earlier Gothicrenaissance was forgotten and diminished.Without the background these clues provide, understanding Fulcanelli’s messagein Le Mystère is almost impossible. Therefore, before we turn to Fulcanellihimself, let us examine how the light of the Grail transformed into thecontinuous light of the great Gothic cathedrals, and in so doing brought thelight of alchemy to center stage in world politics and caused the downfall ofthe Knights of the Temple, which once again forced the alchemical traditionunderground."},{"pageContent":"SIXGRAIL KNIGHTS, PERFECTI, AND THE ILLUMINATED SAGES OF PROVENCEimage [images/image165-00.jpg]THE HERMETIC GRAILIn the early 1180s, as the shadow of Saladin lengthened over the Holy Land, anobleman with Merovingian ancestry, Philip d’Alsace, count of Flanders,commissioned the greatest poet of the age, Chrétien de Troyes, to do a Frenchreworking of a strange tale about a poor knight, the son of a widow, who attainsthe kingship of the Holy Grail. Philip supposedly found the tale in an ancientCeltic chronicle, and wanted Chrétien, the medieval version of a best-sellingauthor, to make it a hit. Chrétien labored over this strange story, sometimesgiving its symbolic events a sort of numinous and dreamlike quality and at othertimes obviously failing to grasp the importance and even the meaning of hissource material.1 [36_endnote-title.html#fff1]Nonetheless, as Jerusalem fell and the Christian kingdoms of Outremer shrank toa few coastal enclaves, poets in noble courts across Europe took up the story ofChrétien’s Grail. Chrétien himself never completed his work, leaving the longpoem unfinished at his death. Several poets tried to continue the story, withvarying degrees of success. Even more important, other writers took up thetheme, as if from a common source, and expanded upon it.Robert de Boron, writing between 1190 and 1199,2 [36_endnote-title.html#fff2]Christianized the Grail story. He tells us that the source of his story, in itsChristian form, is a great book, the secrets of which have been revealed to him.Robert, unlike Chrétien, is quite sure what the Grail is all about. The Grail isthe cup of the Last Supper in which Joseph of Arimathea collected Jesus’ bloodat the Crucifixion. After the Crucifixion, Joseph’s family became the keepers ofthe Grail. The adventures of the Grail romances involve the members of thisfamily, and in the end the Grail comes to England with Joseph’s brother-in-law,Brons the Fisher-King. As in Chrétien’s version, Perceval is called “the Son ofthe Widow Lady,” but Robert also describes him as a descendant of Joseph ofArimathea.We must keep in mind that at this same period, the Order of Our Lady of Zion wasin the process of relocating its power base to Europe. Supported by the powerfulCistercians, by 1178, ten years before the schism between the Templars and theolder order, Zion was well established in Europe. A papal bull from AlexanderIII grants the order possession of chapters in Picardy, France, Lombardy,Calabria, Sicily, Spain, and the Holy Lands.3 [36_endnote-title.html#fff3] Afterthe loss of Jerusalem, the Order cut loose the Templars and embarked on a newprogram. The Grail romances can be seen as part of this new plan.The histories collected through two centuries of patient work by Sylvester’schroniclers suddenly appeared as the content of a new kind of popular mythology,one nicely geared to the knightly aspirations of the crusading era. The source,as both Chrétien and Robert de Boron inform us, is a secret book in thepossession of certain nobles connected with the Merovingians and the Order ofZion.Another Grail romance, composed at the same time and from the same sources asRobert’s History of the Grail, makes this connection even more apparent. Theanonymous author of the Perlesvaus may have used the same sources as Robert (heagrees with him, for instance, on Perceval’s lineage), but his mystical spin onthe story puts it in a league by itself.The author may have been a member of the Order of Zion, which would account forhis anonymity. He certainly had a vast command of the Arthurian literature ofhis day and possibly even access to the order’s Merovingian research. UnlikeRobert de Boron, who thought the Grail events happened in the first centuryafter Christ’s death, the anonymous author of the Perlesvaus clearly dates theevents in his story to the late fifth century, the time of both the historicalKing Arthur and the rise of the Merovingian dynasty.4[36_endnote-title.html#fff4]Another romance, The Quest for the Holy Grail, written around the turn of thethirteenth century by a group of Cistercian monks as part of the so-calledVulgate Cycle of Grail romances, gives a precise date for the events it records:454 years after the death of Jesus on the cross, or 487 C.E., the first flush ofthe Merovingian dynasty and just a few years before Clovis’s conversion by SaintRemy and his pact with the Western Church.5 [36_endnote-title.html#fff5]From these details alone, the hand of the Order of Our Lady of Zion and itschronicling predecessors can clearly be discerned in the creation and popularityof the Grail romances. But the Perlesvaus goes further by describing the keepersof the Grail’s secrets in terms that any contemporary would immediatelyinterpret as referring to the Templars. The castle of the Grail, we are told,houses a conclave of initiates dressed in white robes with red crossesemblazoned on their breasts.The Perlesvaus is full of strange alchemical details that suggest its author’sfamiliarity with the Kabbalah of the Bahir. The clearest example of this, andthe most cogent to our investigation, is Perlesvaus’ voyage to the Isle ofBlessed Elders in the closing pages of the romance. In this otherworldlyParadise, Perlesvaus finds a magnificent Tree with a fountain flowing out fromit surrounded by twelve golden pillars. This axis mundi motif is a junctionpoint between the Bahir, which introduced the concept of the Tree of Life to theKabbalah, and later alchemical symbolism concerned with the timing of alchemicaloperations. In much of the Perlesvaus, alchemy seems to lurk just below thesurface, even in the Grail itself. To Perlesvaus, the Grail appeared as acomplex and evolving series of five images, the last of which was the Grail cup.The most significant of all the Grail romances is the Parzival of Wolfram vonEschenbach, written between 1200 and 1215.6 [36_endnote-title.html#fff6] Wolframminces no words in calling the keepers of the Grail Templars, and then goes tothe heart of the mystery by describing the Grail as a miraculous stone. This“lapsit exillis,” a green-language pun that suggests the exiled stone ofMatthew, as well as the stone that fell from heaven and even the “lapsit elixir”of the alchemical philosopher’s stone, has miraculous powers, including healing,nourishment, and the ability to communicate its wishes.7[36_endnote-title.html#fff7]Wolfram claimed to have learned his tale from one Guyot, or Kyot, of Provence,who in turn learned it from a recovered manuscript from Toledo, in Muslim Spain.This source, according to Wolfram, is the manuscript of Flegetanis, a heathenastronomer living roughly at the time of the Exodus from Egypt, or about 1,200years before the birth of Christ. Flegetanis, whose name is simply the Persianphrase “familiar with the stars,” claimed to read the “name” of the Grail in thestars and thereby understood the workings of destiny. He also claimed that thisastral destiny focused on the family of Christ and his descendants. Guyotaugmented this tale with his own Latin research, suggesting that either he was,or had access to, one of Sylvester II’s Chroniclers, before he passed it on toWolfram.Parzival is a masterpiece of alchemical literature, and as such is worthy ofanother volume at least the size of this one in order to do it justice.8[36_endnote-title.html#fff8] For our purposes, let us simply note that inaddition to the direct reference to the Templars and the meteoric stone thatfell from heaven, Parzival ends by informing us that Lohengrin, the Swan Knightof Lorraine, is the great-grandfather of Godfroi de Bouillon. With Parzival, theorigins of the First Crusade and its alchemical secrets come full circle as aGrail romance. A mysterious text and an artifact, the miraculous stone, the“lapsit exillis” in the hands of a family group of knights that spans both Eastand West and sounds a lot like the contemporary Templars, should have been afairly obvious series of references to those in the know at the turn of thethirteenth century. And behind all the legends lurk the Order of Zion and itspredecessors, Sylvester’s Chroniclers.After 1210, as the persecution of Cathar heretics in the south of Franceincreased into a crusade, the Grail romances began to fade from favor. TheChurch never challenged them directly, which is indeed curious, but by themiddle of the thirteenth century, their imagery and symbolism had faded fromliterature and politics, only to be permanently engraved in stone on the porchesand naves of the newly constructed Gothic cathedrals. Indeed, one of themagnificent Gothic statues at Chartres Cathedral depicts Melchizedek, the kingof Ur and Salem who converted Abraham to monotheism, holding the chalice of theGrail. This symbolic image suggests that a deep understanding of the Graillegend remained, at least among the builders of the church itself.The flash point where people and events and traditions transformed into theGrail of romance and legend can be found in the south of France, in that favoredprovince of Rome, Provence, where the Holy Family supposedly emigrated fromPalestine within a few years of the Crucifixion. It is here, the home of themysterious Guyot who wrote the original source tale, where we find MaryMagdalene, holy trophies, and miraculous stones at the core of the earliestcommunity of “Christians” in Europe. And it is here, in Provence, that all thethreads of this complex tapestry converge into one single event, the coronationof Frederick I Barbarossa as king of Arles in 1178.THE GRAIL IN PROVENCEThe Rhône River begins as clay-filled glacial runoff high in the Swiss Alps. Itwinds its milky way across Switzerland, emptying its alluvial deposits at lastinto Lake Geneva and becoming, as Byron put it, “the blue rushing of the arrowyRhône.”9 [36_endnote-title.html#fff9] After curving through the foothills of thewestern Alps, the Rhône falls into a deep valley and turns south, running alongthe natural gap between the Cévennes Mountains and the French Alps toward thesea. For over one hundred miles, the river follows the valley, hugging theeastern edge of the Cévennes, until, as the mountains fall away to the east andthe west, it gathers its tributaries and fans out in a wide delta across thehead of the Gulf of Lion, a small arm of the Mediterranean Sea.Just before the Rhône splits into its two main channels, a last straggling armof the Alps, the Alpilles, reaches westward, ending in a jumbled and rockypromontory a few miles from the river. This protective line of hills forms thebaseline of another delta, or triangle, with the upper lines created by theconfluence of the Durrance and the Rhône. Within this secure and fertiletriangle, successive waves of ancient cultures established their communities andtowns. Neolithic farmers arrived early in the seventh millennium B.C.E. anddwelt in Arcadian simplicity until Bronze Age trading cultures, such as theEgyptian, Mycenaean, and Phoenician, began to arrive in the second millenniumB.C.E. Soon after this contact, Celtic tribes began to filter down the riverfrom their European homeland north of Lake Geneva and conquered or integratedwith the local culture to form a unique variety of Gallic Celt (see fig. 6.1).More than half a millennium before the birth of Christ, Greek traders built afortress a few miles to the southwest of the old Celtic town, at the point wherethe Rhône forks. The Romans called it Arelate; in French it’s Arles, now knownmostly for the visits of artists such as van Gogh and Gauguin. It began,however, as a center of Greek culture in a barbarian paradise. The twocommunities mixed and grew into a larger city nestled in the protected deltanorth of the low range of volcanic hills, the Alpilles, near the present-daytown of Saint-Remy-de-Provence.image [images/image170-00.jpg]Figure 6.1. Map of Provence.Michel Nostradamus, the justly famous Seer of Provence, was born at Saint-Remybarely a mile from the arch and monument that is all that remained in thesixteenth century of the ancient Roman city of Glanum Livii, once the mostprosperous town in Provence and home, in the first century C.E., to a largecommunity of Diaspora Jews. They are still standing today (see figs. 6.2 and6.3), stark reminders along the modern road into the Alpilles of the area’sancient past.10 [36_endnote-title.html#fff10]While secrets may remain hidden near the lost city of Glanum, at least accordingto Nostradamus,b [36_footnote-title.html#bfn] other clues to Provence’s unusualrole in the history of Western esotericism, including its Hebrew and GnosticChristian roots, are hidden in plain sight. At Arles, which has often beencalled the soul of Provence, Greek and Roman relics abound. It is but a briefwalk from the lovely Roman arena, equal in elegance if not in scale to Rome’sColiseum, to the town square where a curious Romanesque church with a Gothicfacade draws the attention of the serious student of hermeticism in search ofthe Grail.image [images/image171-00.jpg]Figure 6.2. The mausoleum at Glanum. (Photo by Vincent Bridges)image [images/image171-01.jpg]Figure 6.3. The remains of the “lost” city of Glanum Livii nearSaint-Remy-de-Provence. (Photo by Vincent Bridges)On sunny Sunday afternoons in the spring, the tour guides compete withhurdy-gurdy music and the laughter of children as they explain the images on thechurch front in terms of Hercules’ labors. Few tourists ponder why a Christianchurch in Provence uses the symbolism of ancient Greek myth, why its saint iscalled Trophime, or Trophy, or even why both Constantine, founder of theimperial Church in the fourth century, and Frederick Barbarossa, the Holy RomanEmperor in the late twelfth century, chose Arles (see fig. 6.4) for theirconfirmation and coronation.11 [36_endnote-title.html#fff11]Attempting to answer these questions takes us deep into the heart of the Graillegends. The coronation of Frederick Barbarossa appears to be the key point ofdiffusion, the place and time where the Grail myths were inserted into the storyof King Arthur. As many other researchers have found, and Robert de Boron openlytells us, the Grail stories have much to do with a bloodline, the descendants ofthe Holy Family and possibly Jesus himself, hence the “green-languagesque” punof sang réal, “holy blood,” out of san grael, “holy grail.” In the romances,those of the bloodline are depicted as the guardians of the Grail, not the Grailitself. Even though the nature of the object is obscure, it is clearly anobject, a relic or artifact of some sort: In Chrétien, it is a wide flat plate,in de Boron it is a chalice that held Jesus’ blood; the Perlesvaus depicts theGrail as a series of objects, and Wolfram describes a miraculous stone.Could the trophy of Saint Trophime be the Holy Grail? Could Arles be the home ofa sacred relic of such wonder and importance that it became the model for theHoly Grail? And if so, what bloodline, or line of descendants, could be calledits guardians?Farther to the southwest of Arles, where the western branch of the Rhône flowsinto the Mediterranean, stood an ancient Egyptian port and lighthouse, foundedperhaps a thousand years before the Greek traders arrived. Called Re by theRomans, this lighthouse and port marked the turning point in the channel thatbrought Egyptian merchant ships into the Rhône. Today, the ruins of theEgypto-Roman fortress of Re lie a quarter mile beyond the breakwater off thesmall beach town of Les-Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. However, this resort town, faroff the beaten path at the end of a region of marshes and tidal flats called theCamargue, holds the key to what happened to the Holy Family after the death andpossible resurrection/ascension of Jesus in Palestine.12[36_endnote-title.html#fff12]image [images/image173-00.jpg]Figure 6.4. Town square and fountain, Arles. (Photo by Darlene)Hebrew migration to the region around the mouth of the Rhône began with the eraof Greek colonization spurred on by Alexander’s conquests in the East. The flowincreased in the early first century C.E. under the encouragement of the Romanemperor Octavius Augustus. After the destruction of Palestine in 70 C.E., theflow became a torrent, and some of these Hebrew refugees were Christians (seefig. 6.5).13 [36_endnote-title.html#fff13]Provençal tradition holds that soon after the Crucifixion, a shipload of Jesus’relatives landed off the old Roman fort of Re, near present-dayLes-Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. By all accounts, the group included three Marys,covering the interwoven family of Jesus and John the Baptist. One of the threewas Mary Magdalene, first witness to the Resurrection and, by Gnostic accounts,Jesus’ foremost disciple and wife. Also included were Martha and Lazarus,members of Mary Magdalene’s family, a few local Romanized Jews includingMaximinius and Sidonius, the blind man from Jericho, and, either welcoming themhome or miraculously as part of the ship’s company, Sarah the Egyptian.Tradition relates that the group spread out through Provence and preached theGood News with such success that by the time of the destruction of the Templeand the Diaspora, barely more than a generation later, Provence was at leastpartially converted to Christianity.14 [36_endnote-title.html#fff14]image [images/image174-00.jpg]Figure 6.5. A ship of Marys. Statue is from l’Église Ste.-Maries-dele-Mer,unknown date and origin. (Photo by Darlene)Two of the Marys, along with Sarah the Egyptian, remained in the seaside villagewhere they landed. When they died, around 50 C.E., Saint Trophime himself camefrom Arles to administer the last rites. The three were buried near a smalloratory, or chapel, they had built in the center of the village. In the ninthcentury, a new church was built over the oratory and the graves; fortified, itbecame part of the town walls. When King René d’Anjou, count of Provence,excavated the old church in the 1440s looking for the Holy Grail, he found theholy relics of the two Marys and Sarah and a curious stone buried with them.Called the Saint’s Pillar, it was incorporated into a support column when KingRené built a lofty and imposing church of pinkish stone to house the saints’relics (fig. 6.6). With its parapets, merlons, embrasures, and internalfreshwater spring, the church acted as a virtually impregnable fortress designedto protect the town’s inhabitants from Moorish pirates and other marauders.15[36_endnote-title.html#fff15]That as late as the fifteenth century someone of the stature of King Renéd’Anjou should coming looking for the Holy Grail at an obscure seaside church inProvence is evidence in favor of a long-standing tradition connecting Provence,and the region of Arles and Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer in particular, with amiraculous stone or artifact that came to be identified as the Holy Grail.image [images/image175-00.jpg]Figure 6.6. The fortress church at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, built by King Renéd’Anjou. (Photo by Vincent Bridges)Stepping into the cool darkness of the church at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer fromthe bright clear sunlight of Provence is to step back into another age, an ageof faith that was at least superficially Christian but actually illuminated,from within as it were, by the antiquity of its goddess worship. Under thechancel, a flight of stairs leads down to the crypt, where King René found thebones of Sarah and the two Marys. Blackened by the candles of myriad pilgrims,most of them Gypsies who come to pray before the statue of Sarah (fig. 6.7), thecrypt envelops the visitor with an atmosphere of dark and earthy mystery. Ifthis is Christianity, it’s far different from its more orthodox varieties. Here,the feminine is not excluded; it is worshipped in a manner that is far moreprimitive than early Christianity itself.This impression is heightened during the Fête of May, when the Gypsy guardiansgather to honor Saint Sarah and the two Marys. For several days prior to thefestival on May 24 and 25, Gypsies from all over Provence, southern France, andnorthern Italy pour into Les-Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, some still in theircolorful horse-drawn caravans. The guardians, those who will carry the relics inthe festival, make an all-night vigil at Saint Trophime, then travel in aprocession with twelve young girls in white, the virgins of Arles, to the churchat Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. The three-day festival begins with the guardianstaking down the reliquaries of the two Marys from their chapel above thechancel. The relics are left on display while the statue of Sarah is brought upfrom the crypt, draped in many rich cloaks, and paraded down to the sea.image [images/image176-00.jpg]Figure 6.7. Sarah of the Gypsies, in the crypt of the church atSaintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. (Photo by Darlene)The next day it is the two Marys’ turn to make the journey. Standing in a smallblue boat, piled high with roses and holding an urn full of healing balm, calleda graal in the local Camargue provençal, the two Marys travel on the shouldersof their four guardians down to the sea, where they landed almost two millenniaago. In this simple ritual can be heard echoes of a goddess tradition going backto Egypt and beyond. After the Marys are returned to their chapel, the dancingand singing goes on late into the night as the crowds prepare for the thirdday’s bullfights, bandito runs, and parties in honor of the Gypsy benefactor,Folco de Baroncelli.16 [36_endnote-title.html#fff16]These celebrations mark a fountainhead. Like the spring in the church of the twoMarys, one of many miraculous springs and wells in Provence, these traditionsserve as a source point for the broad esoteric current that King René himselflabeled the underground stream of lost Arcadia. And with this knowledge—themystery hidden in plain sight, known to the Gypsies and the common folk—the truehistory of that underground stream, the Gnostic Christianity of the West, can betraced through the centuries.image [images/image177-00.jpg]Why should Arles be such an important locality in the history of the Grail? Forone thing, there is its ancient history and persistent connections to certainmyths and legends. When Hannibal crossed the Rhône a few miles north ofpresent-day Arles in 218 B.C.E., the Gallo-Greek settlement was already atrading post of some note. The earliest versions of the Greek legend of Jasonand the Argonauts suggest that they sailed west from Argos, around the heel ofItaly and through the Strait of Messina to the mouth of the Rhône. They thentraveled up the river, founding the trading center of Theline at the head of theRhône delta along the way, to the land of the Golden Fleece, located, accordingto proponents of this theory, around the source of the Rhône at Lake Leman. Inthis interpretation, the Argonauts’ return route was over the Alps by way of theSaint Bernard Pass, and then down the Po River to the Adriatic Sea.17[36_endnote-title.html#fff17]Under the Romans, who called it Arelate, the city retained its commercial statusand flourished. Christianity arrived before the middle of the first century,brought, according to legend, by Saint Trophimus, or Trophime. Curiously enough,Saint Trophime dedicated the very first shrine to the Virgin here, even beforeher death. By the late first century C.E., Arles had become an ecclesiasticalcenter, a position it would retain for the next four centuries, partly on thestrength of its legendary cemetery, the Alyscamps.18[36_endnote-title.html#fff18]Perhaps the most famous necropolis of the medieval era, the Alyschamps (fromElisii Campi, or Elysian Fields) owed its fame to Saint Trophime. Built outsidethe city walls, as were all Roman cemeteries, and along the via Aurelia, themain road to Italy and Rome, the Alyschamps was a perfect location for secretmeetings. Saint Trophime soon attracted a following. However, we are not sureexactly who Saint Trophime really was. The Church claims he was the disciple ofSaint Paul mentioned in 2 Timothy 4:20.This seems impossible, given that our Saint Trophime was in Arles at least adecade before the events mentioned in Timothy’s letter. He apparently didn’tarrive with the Holy Family, although he was close, possibly even related, tothe two Marys at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. His devotion to a Mary, possibly theVirgin Mary, but more likely Mary Magdalene, has already been noted. He isreported to have spent years in meditation at his hermitage a little fartheroutside Arles, beyond the Alyschamps, and in the year before his death ordisappearance, probably in 52 C.E., he invoked a blessing on the cemetery.Christ himself was said to have attended the ceremony and left the imprint ofhis knee on a sarcophagus lid.19 [36_endnote-title.html#fff19]In 314 C.E., Constantine came to Arles to swear on this relic before the Churchcouncil that the Christian God was his personal protector. He founded a smallchapel—Saint Honoré—to house the relic. All of this attention made theAlyschamps famous, and it became so desirable as a final resting place thatbodies were shipped from all Europe for burial in its holy grounds. Thetwelfth-century chronicle of the Pseudo-Turpin informs us that the peers ofCharlemagne, Roland, and the other fallen heroes were transported with greatdifficulty to the Alyschamps.20 [36_endnote-title.html#fff20]Arles, therefore, is ground zero for whatever version of Christianity it wasthat swept the region in those early years. In Mystery of the Cathedrals,Fulcanelli also directs us here, to Arles, the Alyschamps, and to the cathedralof Saint Trophime in particular, with several tantalizing references. He pointsout to us a rose-cross ankh on a sarcophagus lid at Saint Honoré in theAlsycamps and bids us pay close attention to the tympanum on the Great Portal ofSaint Trophime (fig. 6.8).21 [36_endnote-title.html#fff21]Built in the mid-fifth century by Saint Hilaire and originally dedicated toSaint Stephan, the cathedral was rebuilt in the eleventh century and the GreatPortal was finished a century later, in time for the coronation of Frederick IBarbarossa as king of Arles in 1178. Rededicated to Saint Trophime when therelics of his miracle were moved from the Alyscamps in 1152,22[36_endnote-title.html#fff22] the cathedral failed to retain the sacred cache ofits saint’s miraculous status, probably because the Holy Stone, the sarcophaguslid with the knee print, had disappeared. This missing stone, which conferred“knowledge of the Living Christ” to those who beheld it and “certainty ofresurrection and eternal life” to those sacred dead who slept in its embrace,according to the thirteenth-century Golden Legends, might just be the originpoint of all the later Holy Grail legends.23 [36_endnote-title.html#fff23]image [images/image179-00.jpg]Figure 6.8. The front of Saint Trophime, Arles. (Photo by Darlene)Consider that, although Chrétien de Troyes had invented all the other trappingsof the Arthurian legends, the Matter of Britain as it was known in the MiddleAges, in his earlier works before 1180 or so, there is no hint that he had anyidea of anything remotely resembling the Grail. Then he was supposedly given anancient manuscript “in the Breton tongue” by Philip of Flanders and asked torender the material into an epic poem, which became Perceval, or the Story ofthe Grail.24 [36_endnote-title.html#fff24]So where did Philip of Flanders come by the story? Chrétien doesn’t tell us muchand, although there have been many suggested sources, we just don’t know.However, Wolfram von Eschenbach, author of Parzival, a complete version of thestory that Chrétien only began, tells us that he had the true story from itssource: one Kyot or Guyot of Provence.This is an important clue, because there was a Guyot de Provins, a troubadourpoet. And there is only one place that a young squire soon to be knight such asWolfram could have met Guyot de Provins: at the coronation of Frederick IBarbarossa as king of Arles in 1178. Guyot de Provins was there, in the companyof the Lords of les Baux, a curious clan from the Alpilles north of Arles whoclaimed descent from Balthazar, one of the three magi. We are less certain thatWolfram was there, but it does seem probable, as it has been determined from thetexts of his poems that he entered the service of Frederick I Barbarossa at anearly age.25 [36_endnote-title.html#fff25]We can be certain, however, that Philip of Flanders and his sister-in-law Mariede Champagne did attend, as they are prominently listed among the assemblednobles in various sources.26 [36_endnote-title.html#fff26] It is possible thateven Chrétien de Troyes was there, as he was at the court of Flanders duringthese years. Thus, on this one occasion, all of the people involved in thecreation and propagation of what would later be the Grail legends crossed pathsin Arles. And curiously enough, also in Arles, we find the veneration of a holystone with miraculous properties.Perhaps this is more than coincidental, as there are political considerations aswell. At the treaty of Vienne (another ancient imperial city up the Rhône) in1177, Frederick had been forced to acknowledge the authority of Pope AlexanderIII, effectively ending Frederick’s bid to reestablish an empire in the West.Accepting the crown of the ancient imperial province of Arles, with its echoesof Constantine, was for Frederick I Barbarossa, already Holy Roman Emperor, akind of lateral move that can be considered a way to establish connectionsbetween the two military orders, and through them with an even more ancient, andperhaps more legitimate, form of Christianity. His coronation in the spring of1178 at the newly finished cathedral of Saint Trophime signaled a shift infocus, one that would lead, a decade later, to Frederick’s taking charge of theThird Crusade and his death in the wilds of Armenia.27[36_endnote-title.html#fff27]Behind these political machinations can be glimpsed the string pulling of theKnights of the Temple. Provence had been, since the earliest days of the order,one of its major locations and sources of wealth and support. The Templars heldat least twenty-nine major commanderies and over one thousand smallerproperties, such as farms and small landholdings, in Provence by the latethirteenth century. In the years before the Third Crusade, as much as half ofall Templar revenues that can be accounted for came from Provence. Thecommandery at Arles was one of the oldest in Europe, having been ceded to theTemplars in the 1130s by James I of Aragon.28 [36_endnote-title.html#fff28]In addition, Provence was the home of the other major military order, theKnights of Saint John of the Hospital, also known as the Hospitallers in thesame way as the Knights of the Temple became the Templars. Founded by papal bullin 1113, fifteen years before the Templars, the Knights of the Hospital were thecreation of a single knight, Gerard, whose family name and birthplace areunknown. Like the later Templars, the Hospitallers also held Saint John as theirpatron. Exactly which Saint John is open to some doubt, but most likely SaintJohn the Baptist. Their rule, provided by Raymond of Provence in 1130, saysnothing about any military role at all. That changed over time, and theHospitallers were at least the equals of the Templars in battle during the lastdays of the kingdom of Jerusalem, and their bitter rivals in its politics.29[36_endnote-title.html#fff29]In contrast to the situation in Outremer, both orders of knights, white with redcrosses for the Templars and black with white crosses for the Hospitallers,flanked Frederick I Barbarossa at his coronation as king of Arles in 1178. InProvence, this closeness continued even after the fall of Jerusalem, resultingin several calls during the thirteenth century for their unification. TheTemplars remained a powerful presence in the region; even after the pope and theFrench king Philip ordered their arrest. In 1311, four years after the arrest,supposedly, of every Templar in France, nine knights from Provence showed up todefend the order at the Council of Vienne.30 [36_endnote-title.html#fff30]They were actually successful. The Church never officially declared the Templarsguilty of anything, but King Philip, who was on the scene with a largecontingent of troops, carried the day, and the Templars were dissolved as areligious order and then subjected to the secular justice of the French king.The leaders went to the stake, but the regular knights, particularly inProvence, were allowed to join another chivalric order to avoid arrest. In thisway, many commanderies of the Templars passed with all hands directly to theKnights of Saint John, soon to become the new Knights of Rhodes, and thenfinally the still surviving Knights of Malta.Did the Templars and the Hospitallers use the political ambitions of Holy RomanEmperor Frederick Barbarossa as a way to promote a new spiritual agenda withinthe framework of a revised Christianity? The Church never challenged the Grailromances perhaps because they were, after all, a hobby of the nobility, withlimited influence outside the noble families who copied them and had them reador sung by the court minstrels. But when the spiritual agenda of the Grailromances became the dominant view of both the nobility and the common folk, thenthe imperial and orthodox Church was forced into action. Just as the Graillegends reached their apotheosis in Wolfram’s Parzival, the Church launched anew crusade, this time against its fellow Christians in southern France, theCathars or Perfecti.THE PERFECTIThe Grail romances tell us of an alchemical secret, transformative even in itsmost Christian forms, that is held by a family group of initiates or knights ofthe Temple. The secret, and the genealogy of its guardians, is explicated in anancient book, which can be read only by those who, like Parzival, understand thelanguage of the birds, the green language of alchemy and astronomy. This is thebasic consensus of all the various Grail romances of the period, as we sawabove, and may be considered the core of the legend as seen by its contemporaryaudience.Like all great and essentially timeless ideas, the Holy Grail is a product of aspecific time and place, a specific and exact set of enabling conditions thatallowed the emergence of this seminal myth. To understand the impact of theGrail romances, we must look to the times in which the legend emerged, the latetwelfth century. These thirty years, from roughly 1185 to 1215, marked, in manyways, the nadir of medieval Christianity. The papal squabbles of the midcentury,along with the general sense of discouragement after the failure of the SecondCrusade, created a religious vacuum into which more “heretical” forms ofChristianity stepped. The heresies took root so quickly because of the contrastthey presented with the Church of Rome. The Cathar priests lived with and caredabout their flock. It was common for Roman prelates to spend their whole tenurein absentia, while the lower clergy was often as venal and corrupt as the locallandowner.The decline of the Church had been given an extra push in the 1160s and 1170s bythe wide circulation of Abelardian rationalism. Abelard, best remembered todayfor his romance with his pupil Héloise, had discussed the superstitions of theChurch, in the 1120s, with such clearheadedness that two generations later manyintellectuals agreed that change was necessary, even essential.If the Second Crusade had been disappointing, then the fall of Jerusalem in theautumn of 1187 was devastating. It was seen as a sign of God’s disfavor. Acrusade was proclaimed, joined by such personages as the kings of Germany,France, and England. Frederick Barbarossa died along the way, and even thoughRichard I of England pursued the crusade with all the force of his fierypersonality, Jerusalem remained in the hands of the infidels.31[36_endnote-title.html#fff31]Richard the Lion-Hearted was something of a troubadour himself and gave his ownstamp of approval to the new mode of romance. He seemed to embody the Matter ofBritain and its chivalric traditions. We can be sure that the new poetry of theGrail accompanied the Crusaders because Richard’s nephew and Marie’s son, Henryof Champagne, was elected king of Jerusalem. It is tempting to envision the poetGautier de Danans chanting his continuation of Chrétien’s masterwork in thegreat hall of Acre, with Richard and his queens, his sister Johanna and his wifeBerengaria, nodding their approval.Around 1200, Robert de Boron, following the popularity of the continuations ofChrétien, produced Joseph of Arimathea, the prequel to the series that ties itall very neatly into the Holy Family myths. He reveals the themes of a hidden orinner teaching given to Joseph after Christ’s Resurrection. These teachingscenter on the Grail, here called a chalice, and constitute the heart of the“mysteries.” There is a murkiness to this version not found in Wolfram’s work,for instance, perhaps as a result of trying to tell the important parts (forthose with ears to hear) and still stay within certain defined limits that wouldallow the Roman Church to ignore the tale. Things had changed by 1200. Apowerful new pope, Innocent III, had regained the upper hand in his struggleswith the Holy Roman Empire and began to turn his attention to unifying the wholeworld under his spiritual rule.And this led directly to the most disgraceful incidents in the history of theRoman Church. The Fourth Crusade and the Crusade against the Cathars were wagedagainst fellow Christians. The Fourth Crusade ended with the sack ofConstantinople in 1203. The crusaders, tricked by those crafty and godlessVenetians, fell upon the first city of Christendom and plundered and sacked witha vengeance, while Innocent III rejoiced in the “unification of the Church.”32[36_endnote-title.html#fff32]The resurgence of a Gnostic heresy in the south of France, however, threatenedto become the majority religion of the region, and Innocent responded in themanner he knew best: calling out the troops. The extermination of heretics inthe south of France would continue for almost half a century, long afterInnocent III went to his just rewards in whatever afterlife awaited him.Why did the Church want to exterminate the Cathars, or the Perfecti, as theycalled themselves?It boiled down to a question of legitimacy. Even the Greek or Eastern Church,newly sacked by Western crusaders, adhered to a common and recognizably biblicalversion of Christ. The Cathars, however, posed a direct threat to the authorityof all organized Christianity by declaring that the Church Fathers had it allwrong. Essentially, the Cathars were a Gnostic form of the Jewish Messianictradition that came perhaps directly from the early Christians in Provence. Assuch, their view of Jesus as Christ differed radically from that of the orthodoxand apostolic imperial Church, which they saw as a tool of the demiurge, the RexMundi.33 [36_endnote-title.html#fff33]The Cathars considered themselves Christians, but they had their own version ofthe sacraments as well as a kind of yogic spiritual training and initiation.Jesus for them was a prophetic messiah, not a divine being, and they utterlyrejected the Crucifixion. Women were held in high regard, were ordained aspriestesses, and were even politically influential in the latter portion of thestruggle. The aim of the Perfecti, the inner ranks of the priesthood, was totranscend the cycle of birth and death, to escape from the clutches of the RexMundi, and to this end they discouraged marriage, using the energy of sexualityfor the purposes of spiritual transformation. Like the Gnostics, they believedin a Great Return, when all the light imprisoned in matter would be released,and there is some evidence that they were chiliasts as well. There is alsoevidence that the Cathars believed in metempsychosis, or reincarnation.34[36_endnote-title.html#fff34]Just from this brief glimpse of their beliefs it is not hard to see why theRoman Church hated them. Their teachings were deeply antithetical to those ofCatholicism; add to that the claim of being the true Christianity expressed bythe practical ministry of the local Perfecti, and you have a spiritual forcecapable of taking on Rome and perhaps winning. It is not surprising that PopeInnocent III, flush from his almost accidental success over Constantinople,should seize upon the murder of a papal legate outside Toulouse in 1208 as apretext for a full-scale crusade against the civilization of southern France.35[36_endnote-title.html#fff35]Between 1208 and 1244, the fall of the last Cathar stronghold at Montségur (seefig. 6.9), over half a million people went to the stake, or were killed in theseries of terrible conflicts, out of a total population of around two million.Whole populations in cities such as Albi, Béziers, Carcassone, Toulouse, andFoix were brutally massacred in the first example in the West of an organizedattempt at genocide. Out of this campaign developed the Church’s secret police,the Inquisition, which survived with the power to punish heretics until 1835. Inthe Cathars, the Inquisition found its most implacable opponents. In thefifty-year record of the Inquisition in Languedoc we find only four heretics whorecanted their beliefs.36 [36_endnote-title.html#fff36] Most, like the martyrsof Montségur, marched proudly into the flames and died for their faith. Theymight well have echoed the saying of the Donatists, persecuted half a millenniumbefore by Saint Augustine: “The true church is the one that is persecuted, notthe one that persecutes.”37 [36_endnote-title.html#fff37]What was the source of such powerful beliefs? Most scholars have, untilrecently, speculated about other Gnostic-influenced groups, such as theBogomils, as a source for the Cathars’ beliefs. But this has never beenconvincing, as the Bogomils died out almost a century before anything resemblingCatharism appeared in Provence and Languedoc.image [images/image186-00.jpg]Figure 6.9. Montségur, last stronghold of the Cathars, and the temple of theGrail on the Mount of Salvation. (Photo by Vincent Bridges)The similarities in the broad cosmology of both the Bogomils and the Cathars canbe seen as borrowings from the same Gnostic sources, not as direct influences.The Cathars of southern France have distinct qualities, such as the belief inreincarnation, that separate them from other Gnostic survivals. Also, theBogomils gained influence in Bulgaria as part of a peasant uprising, not bygoing head-to-head with the official Church in terms of philosophy andspirituality. When the uprising was crushed, in the early tenth century, theoriginal Bogomils faded away.38 [36_endnote-title.html#fff38]Remnants of a dualistic heresy similar to and perhaps inspired by the Bogomilssurvived, however, and by the eleventh century had spread to pockets in northernItaly and southern France. These were “Bogomils” only in the eyes of theirorthodox persecutors, as all dualistic, anti-Roman heresies were classed duringthe era. By the middle of the twelfth century, the change to “Cathar” was underway when Bulgarian bishops arrived from Constantinople to ordain the growing andpublic heretical movement as true Bogomils. This, of course, would not have beennecessary if the Cathars had actually descended from the earlier heretics. Fromthis point on, the movement had a new official name, the Albigensian heresy,named for the largest group of delegates, those from the town of Albi inLanguedoc.So if the Bogomils can be considered a peripheral and parallel influence, thenwhere did the Catharism of Provence and southern France get its sense ofspiritual certainty? The local traditions of a kind of primitive Christianityare one obvious source. By perhaps semimiraculous means, two copies of theCatharist outer ritual have survived, one in French and one in Occitan. A prayerfrom this ritual points us directly to an early form of very Gnostic- andHebriac-flavored Christianity: “Holy Father, Thou just God of all good souls . .. Grant us to Know what Thou Knowest, to Love what Thou Lovest; for we are notof this world, and this world is not of us, and we fear lest we meet death inthis realm of an alien god.”39 [36_endnote-title.html#fff39] This alien god isthe Gnostic Demiurge.This prayer ends with an interesting twist on the source of divinity in theCatharist view: “ . . . and God came down from heaven . . . and took ghostlyshape in Holy Mary.”40 [36_endnote-title.html#fff40] To the Cathars, Mary wasnot the physical mother of a physical divine being, but the gateway or portalthrough which the Gnosis, the unveiling in the original meaning of the Greekapokalypsis, entered the world. In this sense, she was Sophia, or the Jewishconcept of the Shekhinah.The twentieth-century French historian of the Inquistion Jean Guiraud provedthat even with the most critical and reductionist view of the evidence, theCathars did indeed possess certain most ancient documents, which were directlyinspired by the traditions of the early Church. He concluded that thesimilarities between the neophyte ritual of the Cathars and the second-centuryBaptism of the Catechumens were such that they were essentially the sameritual.41 [36_endnote-title.html#fff41] Except, of course, for the fact that therenunciation of Satan in the Baptism is mirrored in the Cathar rite by arenunciation of the Roman Church. By these lights, it was the Roman Church thatwas heretical, and the Cathars, with their early and more immediate view ofChristianity, were actually the “one true church.”Did the nobles who joined the Templars and listened with such intensity to theGrail romances see them as part of this Gnostic revival? It is likely that theydid, because the first and greatest of all the Grail poets, Chrétien de Troyes,was in all probability a Cathar. In his early work, Erec et Enide, from 1170,Chrétien expresses the core idea of both the troubadours and the Cathars. “Whatcan I say of her beauty? In truth, she was made to be gazed upon: / For in herone could have seen himself as in a mirror.”42 [36_endnote-title.html#fff42]For Chrétien, as for all believers in the “court of love,” the beauty of thebeloved was a mirror of God’s beauty. This echoes the Jewish mystical idea ofthe bride of God, the Shekhinah, which is in fact the “beauty” of God’s creationpraised in the Song of Songs attributed to Solomon. Among the Shia Sufis, thisconcept of the Shekhinah became the teaching that “feminine beauty is thetheophany par excellence,” citing as support of this position the saying of theProphet: “I have seen my God under the most beautiful of forms.” In HinduTantra, we find the same idea: “Every naked woman incarnates prakrti.” Althoughfrom the perspective of their opponents, the orthodox Church of Rome, theCathars were seen as aesthetics and dualists who found this world irredeemablyevil, that is not the perspective found inside the religion itself. What fewremnants remain of their liturgy and practices seem to suggest a belief in theperfectibility of matter, not in its ultimate evil. So for the Cathars, as forthe troubadours, both of whom valued this meditative contemplation of “beauty”asthe ultimate perfection of matter, the beloved served as the middle way betweendebauchery and aestheticism.43 [36_endnote-title.html#fff43]The troubadours of southern France invented a lifestyle and a form of poetrybased on the ideals of romantic love at a time, the turn of the twelfth century,when one might expect that the literature of Europe would be focused on themartial zeal of the Crusades. They developed at the same time and in the samelocation as the Cathars, and their poetry expressed some of the same view of theworld. Whereas the Perfecti tended to the people, the troubadours sang almostexclusively for the nobility, who had in most cases strong Cathar leaningsthemselves. Their influence would be felt in the works of Dante and of Petrarch,who commented that Bertrand de Ventadour’s love songs to Eleanor of Aquitainewere almost as good as his own.44 [36_endnote-title.html#fff44]The word troubadour itself is somewhat puzzling. It seems to come from theprovençal trobar, “to find” or “to invent,” giving the idea of seeking, whetherfor love, for the Holy Grail, for enlightenment. There is also a possiblederivation from the Arabic tarraba, “to sing,” and some of the lyrical stylesused by the troubadours do have Arabic meters and rhyme schemes. The aubade, oralbi, a string of rhymed couplets where the last line always repeats or rhymes,is a form still used by Bedouin minstrels and Arab pop music.45[36_endnote-title.html#fff45]The troubadours called their art the gaya sciencia, the “happy science,” or even“ecstatic gnosis.” Fulcanelli tells us in Le Mystère that their art was based onthe green language, or the language of the birds,46[36_endnote-title.html#fff46] and, indeed, the troubadours took their craftseriously enough to undergo a long period of training. One of the most famoustroubadour academies was at the Château Puivert, Castle of the Bold Green (fig.6.10), where the Court of Miracles, a troubadour conclave and competition, washeld. Château Puivert is in the heart of Cathar country, and from the tower ofthe château one can see Montségur, where the Cathars made their last stand in1244. Château Puivert, whose seigneur, or lord, Bernard de Congost, was anardent Cathar, stands as a literal link between the troubadours and the Cathars.When Château Puivert was razed by Simon de Montfort in 1210, Bernard fled forsanctuary to Montségur.47 [36_endnote-title.html#fff47]image [images/image189-00.jpg]Figure 6.10. The Château Puivert, the Court of Miracles, as it is today. Sackedby Simon de Montfort in 1210, it remained, and still remains, a center ofCatharism. Local neo-Cathars use the château for their devotions and pageants tothe present day. (Photo by Vincent Bridges)Perhaps the first of the troubadours was the grandfather of Eleanor ofAquitaine, Guillaume IX, count of Poitou and duke of Aquitaine. He joined theFirst Crusade but was never considered one of its leaders. His zeal, and respectfor the Church’s authority, was lacking, and after he returned home in 1100 hebecame the model of the later troubadours, roaming the countryside singing oflove and consorting with all manner of heretics. It is possible that Guillaumeof Aquitaine picked up the new verse forms from his contacts with Arabic poetryin Outremer, and they spread by his influence to southern France. The duke led ashort but merry life, and when he died in 1137, he left his immense holdings andlove for poetry to his granddaughter Eleanor.48 [36_endnote-title.html#fff48]In many ways the most remarkable woman of the Middle Ages, Eleanor was outrightsovereign of Aquitaine, the richest and fairest province of France, and veryyoung when she was married to the king of France, the saintly Louis VII, whoseems never to have known quite what to do with this powerful, beautiful, andheadstrong woman. Eleanor started the fashion of the court of love, whichflourished throughout Europe and reached its peak at the turn of the thirteenthcentury. Eleanor’s daughter, Marie de Champagne, Chrétien’s first patron,inherited her mother’s love of provençal troubadours and all the other trappingsof the cult of courtly love.49 [36_endnote-title.html#fff49]Eleanor and her court accompanied Louis the Young on his expedition to the HolyLand, known as the disastrous and ineffectual Second Crusade. Eleanor returnedfrom crusading and soon embarked on the great royal romance of the period. HenryPlantagenet, Henry II of England, swept her off her feet and married her withthe aid of large bribes and good friends in Rome. This left the troubadourBernard de Ventadour so heartbroken that he penned his most famous poem, thedirge to Eleanor that so moved Petrarch. Their children included two of the mostrenowned and infamous characters in the long panorama of English history:Richard the Lion-Hearted and King John, the signer of the Magna Carta. With suchillustrious siblings as these, it is easy to lose track of a simple princess, nomatter what her literary tastes. But Marie de Champagne deserves a better nichein history if only for her encouragement of poetry. She brought to her court thegreatest storyteller of the age, Chrétien de TroyesNot much is known about Chrétien’s origins. He was born around 1130 and by 1170he was famous as the author of a version of Ovid’s Book of Love, now lost, and aversion of the Tristan story that has also disappeared. Erec et Enide was hisfirst medieval best seller. This poem formally introduces the Matter of Britain,single-handedly created by Geoffrey of Monmouth in 1160, to the cosmopolitanaudience at the court of Marie de Champagne, and from there it passed throughoutthe courts of Europe. Erec sets the basic pattern for all Arthurian romances,but though a Catharist perspective is displayed here, and suggested byChrétien’s other early work, the Grail is not yet in evidence.50[36_endnote-title.html#fff50]The shift to the Matter of Britain from classical subjects might be seen as apolitical consideration related to Eleanor’s marriage to Henry II, who was knownto be obsessed with Arthurian themes. Chrétien’s early but lost work on Tristanis a clue to his Cathar leanings. Friedrich Heer, the great German authority onthe culture of the Middle Ages, has suggested that the tale of Tristan andIseult, particularly in its earliest form from the eleventh century, was aloosely disguised Cathar story. He goes on to speculate that Chrétien’s use ofthemes in that story, such as the contemplation of the beloved as divine, andthose in Erec, argues strongly for his Cathar affiliation. According toProfessor Heer, the glimpses inside the Grail Castle Chrétien gives us areactually bits of the inner traditions of the Perfecti.51[36_endnote-title.html#fff51]If Chrétien, however, was already of the Catharist faith in 1170, why did amysterious book “in the Breton tongue” given to him after 1178 by his newpatron, Philip of Flanders, who appears to have had no Cathar sympathies,produce glimpses of the inner secrets of Catharism? And why was the wholesymbolic complex given a Celtic gloss and its location vaguely identified with“Wales” and “Camelot” somewhere in Britain, particularly since everything elsepoints to Provence and southern France?The link was obscured and overlooked until very recently. The Holy Grail wasalso the Precious Stone of the Wise from the Bahir, and this was hidden becausethe secret behind the connection is that of alchemy, knowledge more dangerouseven than heresy. When we look at all the pieces of the puzzle, however, ameaningful image does appear, one that leads to the Gothic cathedrals anddirectly to Fulcanelli’s message in Le Mystère. In fact, the structure andauthorship of the Bahir suggests a model for understanding just who Fulcanellireally was. As we shall see, the sages of the Bahir had many secrets, not theleast of which was the Holy Grail.THE STONE OF THE WISEIn chapter 4 [15_chapter-title-6.html], we examined the Bahir, or Book ofIllumination, at some length. As we saw, the Bahir combined the ideas of thework of creation, the animating of matter, with the radical concept of acelestial projection as a way to return to the divine source. Also in the Bahir,we learned that the Tree of Life, seen as an arrangement of the ten sefirot intoa “tree” for the first time, is actually the “Precious Stone” whose facets areprojected onto the celestial sphere. Another series of verses in the Bahirsupply a mythology of the “Stone” that echoes the hidden mythos behind the Graillegends, ending with the curious statement from Genesis 49:24: “From there isthe Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,” which, as we noted, sounds an oddly Christiannote for a work of Hebraic mysticism.52 [36_endnote-title.html#fff52]The source of the ideas in the Bahir, such as the ancient astronomy of the Teli,the Cycle, and the Heart, may indeed have been Rabbi Nehuniah and thefirst-century Jewish Gnostic circle at Emmaus, but the text we have was compiledin Provence between 1150 and its appearance in public manuscript form in 1176,just two years before Frederick’s coronation at Arles.53[36_endnote-title.html#fff53] Within a decade of its appearance, Chrétien,possibly already a Cathar, had made the Grail legend into a medieval bestseller. And just three years after the appearance of the Bahir, the Roman Churchbegan its campaign of persecution against the Cathars, resulting in a full-scalecrusade in 1208.If, from this chronology, we can speculate that the publication of the Bahirtriggered both the Grail romances and the sudden rise to prominence of theCathars, then we must ask what triggered the public appearance of the Bahir,whose secret knowledge was traditionally taught only one-on-one. Answering thisquestion brings us back to the Templars and the secret of alchemy and the end oftime. And it suggests just how these ideas came to be immortalized in stone onthe facades of the Gothic cathedrals.The sages of the Bahir represent a secret society and a tradition that,according to Gershom Scholem, has its roots in the Hellenistic Gnosticism offirst-century Jewish mysticism, and may possibly be connected through the mysticschool of Emmaus with the origins of Christianity.54[36_endnote-title.html#fff54] The text of the Bahir as it emerged in Provence isa collection of sayings and explanations by a series of learned rabbis. Some ofthese rabbis, such as Rabbi Nehuniah and Rabbi Akiva, are well known from theTalmud, and Rabbi Nehuniah and the school of Emmaus apparently influenced everylater kabbalistic tradition. But the Bahir goes on to quote rabbis completelyunknown elsewhere. There are also fables, teaching stories, and parables thathave no parallel anywhere else in Hebrew literature.55[36_endnote-title.html#fff55]The main rabbi quoted is one Amorai, whose name means “speaker.” Rabbi Amoraiacts as the spokesman for the group, in accordance with the long-standingHebraic tradition that the head of the group makes the pronouncements andteachings in his name or voice. Curiously enough, this is the same type ofpseudonym that we find with Fulcanelli and his circle. Pierre Dujols, a primesuspect for Fulcanelli’s real identity, used the name Magaphon, or “voice of themage,” in some of his writing.56 [36_endnote-title.html#fff56] “Fulcanelli”itself could be this kind of group-spokesman pseudonym for a larger group ofsages. Even in the text of the Bahir, the identity of the quoted sages is oftenobscure.By following those sages we can identify, we can trace a lineage from Nehuniahto the fourth-century sages Rabba and Rabbi Zeira of the Jerusalem school ofalchemists and golem makers. An initial draft, called simply Raza Rabba, or “TheGreat Mystery,” was apparently made at this point, and was circulated thereafterin private. As late as Maimonides’ commentary on the Sefer Yetzirah in the earlythirteenth century, thirty years after the appearance of the Bahir manuscript,it was completely unknown to the larger Jewish mystical community.57[36_endnote-title.html#fff57]Tradition holds that a small school remained in Ono, a suburb of Jerusalem closeto Mount Zion, and in Barcelona in the kingdom of Aragon, now a part of Spainbut in the twelfth century part of a cultural grouping that stretched fromBarcelona to Provence.58 [36_endnote-title.html#fff58] The school in Jerusalemdisappeared after the conquest of the city by the crusaders in 1099. Ideas fromthe Bahir appear in somewhat truncated form as a part of an eleventh-centuryArabic alchemical work. This work, Mother of the King, by one Abufalah, refersto a work by King Solomon entitled HaMaspen, “The Compass” or lodestar, whichsuggests that it was an early version of the “Great Mystery” text of the Bahir.The anonymous Arabic author, Abufalah, a green-language pun in Arabic for “sonof reason,” includes some of the HaMaspen in the Third Gate of his treatise, butthe author clearly doesn’t understand it.59 [36_endnote-title.html#fff59]Abufalah was an Arabic Jew writing in Jerusalem between the disappearance of themad caliph al-Hakim and the fall of the city to the crusaders. His alchemicallearning is proudly displayed, but without much in the way of originality. Buthe does tell us where and how he learned of the mysteries. He studied with oneAbu Artush, possibly of the Ono school, who, he informs us, had an ancient bookthat explained how Solomon learned the secret of alchemy and acquired from thequeen of Sheba the precious stone with which he carried out his transmutations.In a somewhat garbled fashion, Abufalah suggests that the Egyptian queen hadpart of the ancient secret and possibly carried the correct lineage orbloodline, but still needed a mysterious “image of the pictures [of theheavens]” that foretold the future and brought the power of transmutation “outof the vapors” and into reality in order to complete the Great Work. This secretinformation King Solomon was glad to supply, Abufalah tells us.60[36_endnote-title.html#fff60]Here, in the years before the fall of Jerusalem to the crusaders in 1099, wefind a mysterious Arabic Jew writing about alchemy in terms of a precious stonethat facilitates the transformation and of a secret text that goes back toSolomon and the foundation of the First Temple. The author lived in Jerusalemand had some connection with the local mystics studying the Raza Rabba, atransitional form of the Bahir. This might be as close as we shall come todocumenting the secret of alchemy that the Templars apparently discovered in theruins of the Temple. We would not even suspect the importance of Abufalah’swork, which exists in only one manuscript in the British Museum, except for thefact that another provençal mystic in the later Bahir tradition, Rabbi Shlomo inthe thirteenth century, lifted part of it, uncredited, for his own alchemicaltext, the Gates of Heaven. This curious plagiarism points to an absorption ofthe concepts within the tradition of the Bahir and the loss of a direct contactwith the original tradition caused by the fall of Jerusalem, as well as aconscious attempt to cover over the sources of the information.61[36_endnote-title.html#fff61]We can think of this as a clear example of the tendency of those involved in thedevelopment of the Bahir to obscure and obfuscate their origins, identities, andsources. Like the Freemasons centuries later, our only clue is a series ofmetaphors involving Solomon and his Temple, including, of course, the very realand problematic Knights of the Temple of Solomon.The fall of Jerusalem marked the end of the early Bahir school in the suburb ofOno. Perhaps their ancient book was one of the secrets that the Templarsgathered together in the early years of the twelfth century, along with somekind of “precious stone,” either the Black Stone of al-Hakim or even an earlierpiece of the stone from the queen of Sheba. It is possible that it was thesediscoveries that were reported back to Troyes in 1104 and caused such a stir atthe court of Champagne. Unraveling these secrets led to a need for the Templarsin 1118 and their recognition by the pope in 1128. By 1130, when James I ofAragon gave the Templars their extensive holdings in Provence, Languedoc, andAragon, it looked as if the Templars were about to become the new power in theland. And for almost two centuries, that’s exactly what they were.At the same time as the Templars rose to power, the 1120s and 1130s, the groupof pre-Bahir mystics working with the “Great Mystery” text in Spain decided torelocate to Provence. By 1150, a large group of sages had settled in variouslocations in Provence, including Arles, Aix, and Nimes. Over the next twentyyears, their teachings, added on to the basic text of the “Great Mystery,” wouldbecome the Bahir of the published manuscripts. What had been an almost lostsecret tradition suddenly blossomed into a vital spiritual current that wouldspark the future development of both Jewish and Christian mysticism.This time period, from the 1130s to the 1170s, also marks the rise of theCathars from a small Gnostic survival to a major spiritual competitor oforthodox Christianity. In 1126, two years before the pope legitimized theTemplars, the Cathar heresy had had only one martyr, Peter de Bruys, in thewhole of Languedoc. By 1167, just forty years later, the Cathars were extensiveenough in the same region to be the majority party at the Council of Toulouse,giving their name, Albigensians, or the believers from Albi, to the entiremovement.62 [36_endnote-title.html#fff62]Could the sudden rise of the Cathars be related to the combination of theemergence of the sages of the Bahir and the Templars, who protected the regionfrom the full power of the Roman Church? The gathering of Jewish sages, mystics,alchemists, and even golemists, devoted to a text that is the only likely sourcefor the discoveries on Temple Mount in Jerusalem, in the European power centerof the Templars cannot be considered coincidental. Could the link between theCathars and the Templars be the Jewish alchemists of the Bahir?Most scholars who note this synchronicity, from Gershom Scholem to Neil AsherSilberman, take their information on the Cathars from the Cathars’ opponents andconsider that any connection between the traditions is antithetical and in thenature of a response or a reflection. This, however, doesn’t explain theadmitted connection. Somehow, the traditions are related.The one Jewish scholar of the Bahir who took the trouble to look at what remainsof the original Cathar source material, Professor Shulamit Shachar, came to avery different conclusion. Professor Shachar found that the similarities betweenthe Bahirists and the Cathars were far more compelling than the few differencesthat remained when Christian hysteria was taken into account.63[36_endnote-title.html#fff63] While Professor Shachar didn’t draw anyconclusions, there is one key point that suggests that the Cathars were directlyinfluenced by the Bahir.This point is the aforementioned Shekhinah, called the Divine Presence in theBahir and described as the light that shines even in the darkness. Her beauty iscompared to that of a beautiful vessel filled with precious jewels, and herattribute is a kind of cosmic motherlove, the ocean of wisdom. In another verse,the treasure of the Divine Presence is likened to a beautiful pearl, and througha complex series of allusions and green-language punning this is translated as“Bring to life your works in the midst of the pearl that gives rise to theyears.”64 [36_endnote-title.html#fff64]In addition to the Shekhinah connections, the Bahir would also seem to be thesource of the Cathars’ doctrine of reincarnation. In verses 194 and 195 of theBahir, we find reincarnation described in the same terms used by the Cathars,that of vines and viticulture. Verse 196 follows this up with an account of acreation of a golem and a discussion on the Demiurge, and ends with the metaphorof the sacred marriage between the Shekhinah and the Blessed Holy One. It iswith a slight shock that we realize that these three verses contain the pearl ofgreat price, the core of the Cathar beliefs.65 [36_endnote-title.html#fff65]Immediately before this astonishing sequence of verses, we find a series ofequal wonderment. In verses 191 through 193, the Bahir sages present us with aversion of the Grail myth, one that ties together all the others and just mightbe the original.Abraham is the Grail Knight in this version, receiving from Melchizedek, theking of the righteous or consort of the Divine Presence (the Shekhinah), thecommand to stand watch through time and bring merit and compassion to the world.Abraham plants a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and announces the sacred word, thename of God, and then institutes the sacraments of bread and water with thewords: “Whom do you serve?” These are powerful echoes of the Grail ritual, andverse 193’s “Rock of Israel” calls to mind the rock of Zion on which thecrusader kingdom of Jerusalem was founded.This close juxtaposition of the Grail myth, in a possibly original form, withthe heart of the Cathars’ theosophy in just seven short verses of one mysticaltext serves as conclusive proof of the close connection among all threetraditions. In case more proof is needed, let us look at verse 190, thebeginning of this amazing sequence.Here we find the original of the “Precious Stone of the Wise.” When God createdLight, it was so intense that life could not develop. God then shaped the extralight into a great stone, into which he engraved the Tree of Life and the worlditself, what the Bahir calls the Ultimate Future. This stone was passed downthrough the family of Abraham until, rejected, it passed to the descendants ofJacob and disappeared into Egypt. This, the Bahir informs us, is the stone thebuilders rejected that will become the chief cornerstone of the new Temple.Wolfram is making the same point with his “lapsit exillis” pun; the stone is allof these things—the stone of exile, the stone that fell from heaven, the stoneof eternal life, and the stone of the heavens, literally a crystallization ofthe leftover light of creation.ELIJAH, ESCHATOLOGY, AND THE UNDERGROUND STREAMThe Bahir, as we have seen, provides the link among the Cathars, the Grailromances, and the Templars. But the question of why the sages of the Bahirdecided to go public at just that moment remains unanswered. Given the politicalsituation, we may be sure the step was not taken lightly. There must have beensome compelling and overwhelming reason why such a momentous undertaking wasattempted. Secrecy was ingrained in the tradition; the work was taught privatelyand transmitted only from master to student. Suddenly, the secret was out,written down and circulated far beyond the usual small family groups. Why takesuch a risk?The answer lies in the message of a mysterious visitor, and provides the linkbetween alchemy and eschatology. Starting around 1150, a series of strangeencounters between provençal kabbalists and an enigmatic visitor identified as“Elijah the Prophet” triggered a surge of eschatological speculations. No less apersonage than Rabbi Abraham ben David of Posquières, son-in-law of the chiefrabbi of Narbonne, received a life-changing visit from Elijah the Prophet. Thelast recorded such visit was to Rabbi Jacob “the Nazarite” from Lunel around1170. Rabbi Jacob was a mystic and ascetic with close connections to the Catharsand the local provençal tradition—going back traditionally to Mary Magdalene—ofcave-dwelling anchorites.66 [36_endnote-title.html#fff66]Elijah’s message was simple. Around the year 1216, a new era of revelation wouldunfold, ushering in the third and last cycle of the age. Forty years ofpreparation were required to open the new era, so 1176 was chosen as thepublication date of the Bahir, the work that contained the secrets oftransmutation.67 [36_endnote-title.html#fff67] This key bit of eschatologicalinformation can also be seen as the driving force behind the Grail romances andthe Cathars. Both seemed to expect a new era, with a new form of Christianity,to dawn in the near future.But once the secret was out, others began to pick up on Elijah’s message. One ofthe most significant was Joachim of Flores. Joachim was born into the minornobility in Sicily around the time Abbot Suger began the renovation of SaintDenis in the early 1140s. In the mid-1160s he went on pilgrimage to Jerusalem,where he became converted to a variety of mystical Christianity not toodissimilar to the mysticism of the Bahir. After a few years as a hermit on MountEtna, Joachim returned to Italy, joined the Benedictines, and became aChronicler at the Order of Zion’s influential monastery at Casamari (House ofMary) in Calabria.68 [36_endnote-title.html#fff68]Joachim’s visions began around 1183, and soon after he was summoned to Rome byPope Lucius III and encouraged to record his visions and his theories. From thisrecognition, Joachim became a star, the most authoritative spokesman of his ageon the imminent last days. He felt that his knowledge and visions imposed aheavy sense of obligation to spread the news of the impending apocalypse.Convinced that political events such as the schism in Zion and the encroachingpower of the Roman orthodoxy and its struggle with the Holy Roman Empireportended an imminent close of the second age, Joachim retreated to his ownmountaintop monastery on Mount Nero, high above the Sila plateau in northernItaly. There he was consulted by the great of his era, including Richard theLion-Hearted. Joachim told Richard that the Antichrist had already been born.Given that the date, 1191, was roughly the time when Tamujin began his rise tobecome the Genghis Khan of the Mongol horde, Joachim may have been right.69[36_endnote-title.html#fff69]His calculation placed the end of the second age at around 1260. By this date,fifty-eight years after Joachim’s death in 1202, several apocalypses, such asthe fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade, the Crusade against theCathars, and the conquest of the Middle East by the hordes of Genghis Khan andhis sons, had indeed happened. Eighty-seven years after Joachim’s target date,the worst apocalypse since Noah’s Flood swept the world—the Black Death.In spite of Joachim’s acceptance during his life, after his death the Churchcondemned his views and his writings. Since that time, Joachim has been treatedas both a saint and a heretic, but his views retained their popularity inesoteric circles down to the twenty-first century.The sages of the Bahir published their work, at the urging of the mysteriousElijah, because they saw that the world was descending into a period ofdarkness. The arrival of the Mongol hordes and the death of many Sufi sages,such as Ibn Al Arabi, combined with the genocide of the Cathar Crusade,confirmed this view.70 [36_endnote-title.html#fff70] The world was a much darkerplace in 1260 than it had been in 1160, and by 1360, in the depths of the BlackDeath, it must have seemed that the apocalypse had indeed arrived.And what of the sages of the Bahir who had thrown in their lot with the Cathars?They had fared only slightly better by their target date of 1216. Thankfullymost of the original sages did not live to see the persecutions of the earlythirteenth century, the community had been driven underground and out ofProvence. The son of Rabbi Abraham, Isaac “the Blind,” whom Elijah had visitedin the 1160s, led the community in 1215, at the height of the Catharpersecutions, from Provence to Gerona in the Pyrennees northwest of Barcelona.Here, shielded from the Inquisition, the community continued to spread the newmystical doctrine of the Kabbalah across Europe.In his last, unfinished fragment, the Titurel, which was completed a halfcentury later by Albrecht von Scharffenberg,71 [36_endnote-title.html#fff71]Wolfram tells us that the Grail was taken to a miraculous castle in thePyrenees, built to serve as home for the Grail, which until then had “no fixedplace, but floated invisible in the air.” A temple was built to house the Grailatop the solitary Mountain of Salvation. In Albrecht’s description it is acombination of the Bahir’s Precious Stone, the Cube of Space, and the Tree ofLife, a sort of New Jerusalem model of the temple of the cosmos. There are hintshere of both the Bahir sages’ move to Gerona and the Cathars’ last stronghold atMontségur, which was constructed at roughly the same time and is less than onehundred miles from Gerona.After the final destruction of the Cathars, the school at Gerona also fadedaway. The Grail romances lost their appeal, and cathedral constructioneventually ran out of funds and inspiration and ground to a halt. In thefifteenth century, Grail knight René the Good of Anjou, and count of Provence aswell, rediscovered part of the tradition and labeled it the Stream of Arcadia.In the sixteenth century this idea of an Arcadian underground stream wouldappear in the works of Sir Philip Sydney and Shakespeare and in the seventeenthcentury in painters such as Poussin. Even Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in “KublaKhan,” mentions the mythic river Alph (or Alephus), which goes underground inAsia Minor and was said to surface at Arcadia in Greece, or at the Fountaine deVaucluse in the Ardèche, according to Petrarch.The theme continues down to Le Mystère. In the discussion on the image from theGreat Porch at Notre-Dame-de-Paris labeled “The mysterious Fountain at the footof the Old Oak,” Fulcanelli concludes his overview of the key points of thesecret wisdom with a quote from the sacred well at Notre-Dame-de-Limoux, in theheart of the Cathar country of Languedoc only about fifty miles from Montségur.But there are still some unanswered questions: If the Grail romances derivedfrom Jewish and Catharist sources promoted by the Templars in southern France,why do they appear as part of the Matter of Britain? And even more significant,how did these ideas come to be incorporated into the Gothic cathedrals?The latter will have to wait until chapter 7 [19_chapter-title-9.html], but theformer can be answered by referring once again to the chronology of the era. Bythe mid-1170s, the Cathars had attained both organization and stature from theCouncil of Toulouse, but had not yet been seriously attacked by the RomanChurch. The Templars were at the peak of their influence in both Outremer andProvence, negotiating a deal with Frederick I Barbarossa that would make themindependent of even papal authority. In this climate, it is easy to see why theBahir group felt it safe to publish their work.If we can agree that Chrétien represents an early kind of Cathar troubadour,then the decision had already been made to camouflage Catharist teachings in aCeltic mode. Catharism seemed to be the correct religion for the court of loveat Camelot, and the Matter of Britain, unlike the classical or Carolingian epiccycles, allowed its poets and listeners to approximate reality in a mythical waywhile relating those myths to everyday events around them. Arthur’s court, andBritain, for that matter, was far enough removed that it could serve as a landof the imagination, yet near enough to be familiar.The archetypal Arthur of Celtic myth, the high king who sailed to the Land ofthe Dead and retrieved the cauldron of regeneration, was the common property ofthe entire Celtic West, from Toulouse to Tara. The high king of the Volcae atancient Toulouse was an “Arthur” figure, as was the fifth-century high king ofthe Bretons, Rhiotomas, who fought against the Roman Empire. Geoffrey ofMonmouth, writing in 1130, made Arthur into a real historical figure, andensured the Cathars’ appreciation by noting that his shield carried the image ofthe Virgin and setting him up as the foe of Rome. These details recur inChrétien’s early Arthurian work from the mid-1170s.When the original Grail text of Guyot, possibly the new text of the Bahir withsome genealogical material added, was revealed to the inner circle at thecoronation of Frederick at Arles in 1178, it was simple common sense to continuethe cover story by going along with Geoffrey’s “Breton” origins for the story.This subterfuge did not save the Cathars. They were proclaimed anathema by theRoman Church the following year, 1179, and soon the persecutions increased.72[36_endnote-title.html#fff72] But it did save the core of the alchemical Grailof the Bahir by providing an untouchable cover for the stories themselves.By the time Wolfram finished Parzival, the Cathars were being slaughtered by theChurch and there was no longer any need for hiding. Wolfram names the guardiansas Templars, places the source of the story correctly in Spain, Provence, andthe Pyrenees, and gives us, in his Wilhelm, a possible Grail lineage connectingParzival with the paladins of Charlemagne and the heroes of the First Crusade.He even makes explicit the “stone” metaphor from the Bahir, and he insists on anEastern connection that has been variously seen as Jewish or Islamic, or both.Wolfram had nothing to hide, and even as the Grail romances faded away, theinner truths and metaphors so courageously revealed by Chrétien and Wolframcoalesced into the imagery on the front of the Gothic cathedrals. The mysteriousbook and stone so beloved of the Templars, the Cathars, and the alchemistsbecame public books of stone, open to all who could read their symbolism. As weshall see in chapter 7 [19_chapter-title-9.html], the cathedrals of Our Ladydesigned and built between 1150 and 1260 were the “houses” in which the DivinePresence communed with its beloved souls trapped in matter. The cathedrals werenothing less than an attempt to make a living model of the Stone of the Wise, anew chapel of the Grail and a temple of the cosmos."},{"pageContent":"SEVENTEMPLES OF THE COSMOS, CATHEDRALS OF THE GODDESSimage [images/image203-00.jpg]THE HERMETIC CATHEDRALSAnd so, at long last, we arrive at the point where Fulcanelli began, the Gothiccathedrals of Europe. In his 1926 Mystery of the Cathedrals, Fulcanelli claimedthat the Gothic cathedrals were hermetic libraries in stone with the secret ofalchemy displayed for all who could understand to read. When our investigationbegan, this seemed, in its own way, the most incredible of all Fulcanelli’sclaims. It was easier to believe that someone had stumbled privately onto thereal secret behind the alchemical transformation than it was to believe thatsome secret society, or societies, had encoded this information deliberatelyinto the design and the decorations of the greatest of all Christian monuments.For the belief that the Gothic cathedrals are alchemical texts in stone to betrue, several important preconditions would also have to be true, such as theexistence of a secret, or not-so-secret, group with access to the highest levelsof the Church, bottomless wealth, connections with the Holy Land and the Muslimworld, and knowledge of alchemy. Before we, as researchers, could takeFulcanelli’s claims seriously, we needed to validate the existence of such agroup. The importance of this point is obvious. If Fulcanelli was merelyprojecting from his own unconscious the meanings he gives certain images andmotifs found in the cathedrals, rather than revealing an ancient alchemicaltradition, then Mystery of the Cathedrals would be not much more than a work ofsymbolist fantasy—interesting, and useful to the psychologist perhaps—but oflimited value in terms of alchemy.Yet this is, if anything, Fulcanelli’s main point. Mystery of the Cathedrals isnot the usual alchemical cookbook or grimoire, for Fulcanelli implies that he isrevealing the mystery of alchemy as it was taught to him, by reference to thehermetic meanings embodied within the cathedrals. Mystery of the Cathedrals istherefore a demonstration not just of the alchemical philosophy, but also of howthis philosophy animated a lost medieval Golden Age. The key to understandingFulcanelli’s importance, and not just the value of his work, lies in the realityof this lost knowledge and the fact of its emergence as symbols on the walls ofthese churches.We began our search with the origin of alchemy and discovered that alchemy,while containing the knowledge of a pre-catastrophe civilization, appeared inits modern form as part of the Gnostic ferment of the first century C.E. ThisGnostic worldview, derived from the mystery cults of the ancient world, supplieda theological and mythological framework for the emerging wave of monotheisticmysticism as practiced by traditions such as Christianity and Essene Judaism.This framework also contained the essential ideas of alchemy’s tripletransformation. The specific magical technology of the tripletransformation—inner yogic disciplines, magical ceremonies combined withmanipulation of sacred metals, and the secret of time and timing, including thebeginning and end of time—developed first within the Gnostic cults, includingChristianity, and then dispersed into the intellectual underground of the DarkAges.As part of this paradigm, alchemy was influenced by Gnostic eschatologicalteachings, such as the path of return by the small lights to the One Light. Twothirds of the transmutational secret was persecuted out of orthodox and WesternChristianity, while the remaining one third of the secret, that of time itself,was co-opted by its temporal leaders, such as Constantine, Charlemagne, and OttoI. For the Christians, the whole idea of the end of time became confused withthe fall of the Roman Empire, and the apocalypse against heretics became aninstitution of the Church. But the idea of a transformed reality, the chiliastvision of a new heaven and a new earth purged of sin, refused to die.This chiliast concept of a spiritually animated matter became the keystone ofthe alchemical process. The illuminated Hebrew mystics of the Bahir recorded thetechniques for animating matter and related them to the transformational processof galactic alignment. The Shi’ites, Fatimids, and Ismailis alike believed thatMuhammad had received this information and passed on the secret of time and thecoming of the Day of Judgment through the family of Ali. The Sufis, of allpersuasions, retained the most complete understanding of the internal yogictransformation. Any successful alchemist faced the daunting task of uniting inhis own understanding these widely separated fragments in order to complete theGreat Work.We found that by the tenth century, alchemical knowledge had declined to thepoint that the chiliast secret of animating matter had effectively been lost.The Byzantine Greek compilations of that era are composed of older material,much of it from the first century, such as the “Isis the Prophetess” text. TheIslamic current had split into the compilers and philosophers versus themystical and the political wing. Among the Jews of the Diaspora, knowledge ofthe Bahir was limited to several small family groups in Spain and Jerusalem. Theinformation had been on the verge of vanishing before 1100, and it was hard tosee how in a few short decades it could have been revived and then becomeinfluential enough to appear on the cathedral walls. But apparently it had.Working backward from the cathedrals themselves, we found that there were indeedenough mysteries to drive a small army of secret societies through. “Why didwestern Europe build so many churches in the three hundred years after the year1000? What need was there, in a Europe with hardly one-fifth of its presentpopulation, for temples so vast that they are now rarely filled even on theholiest days? How could an agricultural civilization afford to build such costlyedifices, which a wealthy industrialism can barely maintain?” Will Durant askedthese questions in his chapter on the Gothic cathedrals in his History ofCivilization (volume four of The Age of Faith).1 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg1]And who designed them? Who decided on the artwork, laid out the ground plans,and supervised the construction and the decoration? These are mostly unanswered,and now unanswerable, questions. We know the names of these “master masons,” buttheir history and the story of their work have for the most part been lost. Butthe fact of that work, its skill and symbolic integrity, points to thesophisticated degree of organization, perhaps even on an international level,required to produce such elaborate and long-term projects. Buildings of suchcomplexity and elegance do not happen by accident.As Durant noted, the year 1000 was a significant one to Western Christendom. Aswe began to investigate this significance, we came face-to-face with one of theseminal figures in the transition from the Dark Ages to the Middle Ages, PopeSylvester II. Though pontiff for only four years (999–1003), as noted above, thehermetic pope proved to be the fulcrum in a complex series of events thatresulted in effects as wide-ranging as the Crusades, the Templars, the Peace ofGod movement and its heretical offshoots, the Grail romances, and, eventually,the cathedral-building movement itself.As we followed the tangled pattern of Sylvester’s career, we found the seeds ofour sophisticated international organization in the various chronicling ordersestablished by Sylvester within, and on the edges of, the other monastic orders,the Benedictines, the Cluniacs, and the Cistercians. This fluidity oforganization gained a central focus with the establishment of the group ofChroniclers at Jerusalem in 1002. From that point on we can safely speak of anOrder of Zion, in Jerusalem, with connections to all three major monastic ordersback in Europe.During the eleventh century, all of these monastic orders began to build in thepre-Gothic style known as Romanesque. Within these monastic communities, groupsof specialists developed. These were monks and scholars who knew Greek andmathematics, especially geometry, and were also skilled in building. As these“schools” grew, they were influenced by architecture from many distant places,the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, the Al Aqsa Mosque, the Dome of the Rock, inJerusalem, and the mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo. It is not hard to think thatthe Order of Zion, with its Byzantine and Fatimid connections, might have beenone source of that influence.After the First Crusade conquered Jerusalem, the Order of Zion became, as we sawin chapter 5 [17_chapter-title-7.html], the “rock” upon which the kingdom ofJerusalem was founded. The order used its connections back in Provence tocapitalize on the discovery, around 1102, of the alchemical and cosmologicalsecrets of the “Great Mystery” text and, just possibly, a piece of the stone ofthe wise, the lapsit exillis. A decade later, wealth began flowing back toEurope, mostly to the Cistercians led by Bernard of Clairvaux. By 1130, theTemplars had been established, Bernard was the foremost Christian of his day,and Europe was poised on the edge of the cathedral-building mania. Gothic was inthe air, but had yet to be given form. For that we have to thank Saint Denis andthe abbot Suger.“BRIGHT IS THE NOBLE WORK . . .”The Ile-de-France, the heart of the ancient kingdom of the Merovingian Franks,is not a true island, but rather a region surrounded and interconnected bywater, the river system of the Seine, the Oise, the Aisne, the Ourcq, and theMarne. The center of that green and fertile region of deep soil, broad meadows,and dense forests connected by wide, slow-flowing rivers grew out of a chanceintersection of roadways and waterways.For millennia, Paleolithic hunters had camped, without leaving much of a tracebeyond a few broken spear points and well-cracked elk thighbones, on an islandin the broad bend of the Seine where the north–south hunting trail crossed theriver. Eventually, the low rise on the eastern end of the boat-shaped islandbecame a sacred site, and a small community grew up around it. By the thirdcentury B.C.E., a group of Gallic Celts who called themselves Parisii had builta small but prosperous town on the island. They entered history in 53 B.C.E.when Julius Caesar held an assembly in the town, then called Lutetia. The nextyear, the people of Lutetia joined Vercingetorix in his revolt against Rome.2[36_endnote-title.html#ggg2]Labienius, Caesar’s lieutenant, crushed them and the island was abandoned forthe new Roman city on the left bank, located in what is even now called theLatin Quarter. Roman Lutetia was ravaged in the Germanic invasions of the latethird century C.E., and the island once again became a defensive stronghold. Bythe time the Roman emperor Valentinian visited in 365 C.E., his “dear Lutetia, asmall island enclosed within the walls of its ramparts, accessible through twowooden bridges alone,” was becoming known as Paris.3[36_endnote-title.html#ggg3]Paris became a capital in the late sixth century. Clovis I, Merovingian king ofthe Franks, founded his realm there and established the episcopal seat, orcathedra, of the newly dominant Christian Church. His son, Childebert I, builtthe first pair of cathedrals on the Ile-de-la-Cité, as the island was nowcalled. These two, Saint-Etienne and the first Notre Dame, barely survivedsuccessive disasters. Paris would be rebuilt under the Capetian kings,descendants of its mayor, Hugh the Stout—who successfully defended the islandagainst the Vikings in 885–86—but the rebuilding of its cathedrals would awaitthe inspiration of Saint Denis.The legend of Denis is obscure, and not much is actually known about him. Heappears in history in the work of Gregory of Tours, who simply describes hismartyrdom by beheading four hundred years after the fact. The Golden Legend, anearly medieval collection of apocryphal stories, gives us more details. Afterhis beheading, Saint Denis raised himself up and, taking his head in his hands,walked five miles west, his severed head singing psalms the whole way, fromMontmartre to the river. The place where he finally collapsed and was buriedbecame a shrine.4 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg4] Figure 7.1 shows a statue ofSaint Denis on Notre Dame.Located a few miles north of the Ile-de-la-Cité, the abbey of Saint-Denis wasbuilt around the tomb of the beheaded saint and his venerable relics. Denis, thepatron saint of Paris and by extension France itself, had been recognized firstby the Merovingians and then by the heirs of Charlemagne. A small Carolingianchurch replaced the Merovingian shrine, the family chapel of the dynasty, on thesite in the mid-ninth century. Hugh Capet and our old friend Gerbert ofAurillac, archbishop of Rheims, founded the abbey itself in the early 990s. AsSaint Remy and Rheims became associated with the founding of the firstMerovingian dynasty, Saint Denis and Paris became associated with its Capetianrevival.image [images/image208-00.jpg]Figure 7.1. Saint Denis holding his head, from the south porch ofNotre-Dame-de-Paris. (Photo by Vincent Bridges)The future abbot Suger was born in poverty in the village of Saint-Denis. Hisinnate intelligence won him a place in the local monastery school, the Prieuréde l’Estrée, where he became friends with the future king of France Louis VI.The royal family noticed Suger. Philip I encouraged the friendship between hisson and the brilliant scholar. In the early 1120s, Suger was sent to Romeseveral times on diplomatic missions. During his time at the Holy Curia in theearly twelfth century, Suger came into contact with all the major intellectualcurrents of his age, including perhaps what we speculate to be the secretdiscoveries in the Holy Land.During the second decade of the twelfth century, Suger served as prime ministerof France and was at the center of the struggle between the French state and theChurch. Suger naturally sided with his old school chum Louis VI, and his son,Louis VII, against the antipopes of the Holy Roman Empire. He was a man whospent most of his life dealing with the intricacies of medieval power politics,and when he talked, the king of France listened.In 1123, at the height of his power and influence, Suger became the abbot ofSaint-Denis. Perhaps because of his knowledge of the discoveries in Jerusalemand their apparently inexhaustible wealth, Suger pressed for the rebuilding ofthe old Carolingian church into something that would be the wonder of Europe andthe proper venue in which to display the relics of Saint Denis and the regaliaof the Capetian kings (see fig. 7.2). Abbot Suger envisioned his church as thecenter of the new illuminated Christianity that seemed to be overtaking the oldpolitically compromised Roman Church in the early years of the twelfth century.That Saint-Denis, rather than, say, Rheims, with its much more prominentMerovingian connections, was singled out as the source point for the Gothictransformation depends as much on a misidentification as it does on AbbotSuger’s energy and political savvy. As noted above, not much was known of thehistorical Denis. The abbey library contained a volume of works attributed tohim, but these were actually written by the second-century Gnostic philosopherDionysius the Areopagite, the Saint Denis of Alexandria whom Fulcanelli lists asone of the early proponents of chiliasm. The book, given to one of Charlemagne’ssons by the Byzantine emperor Michael the Stammerer, ended up in the abbey’slibrary perhaps as the result of Pope Sylvester’s Chroniclers.5[36_endnote-title.html#ggg5]image [images/image210-00.jpg]Figure 7.2. The crypt of Saint Denis, burial site for the early Merovingiankings, from an eighteenth-century engraving.Abbot Suger was greatly influenced by Dionysius’s theology of light. Dionysiusbelieved that “every creature, visible or invisible, is a light brought intobeing by the Father of Lights,” and celebrated the Divine Light, God’s holyfire, which animated the entire universe.6 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg6] This issimilar to the basic Gnostic concept of the path of return. Abbot Suger tookthis theme to heart. In his three books on the building and consecration of thechurch, we find no fewer than thirteen separate inscriptions celebrating theholy Light. In one of them, in a verse written to celebrate a gilded bronzegate, Suger tells us: “Bright is the noble work, this work shining nobly /Enlightens the mind so that it may travel through the true lights / To the TrueLight where Christ is the true door.”7 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg7]From these ideas, Abbot Suger developed his theory of lux continua, orcontinuous light. With these two words, Suger announced the birth of the Gothicstyle and at the same time pointed to its spiritual roots in the Gnosticilluminism of alchemy. From this point on, the walls of sanctity would beshattered to let in the light. The solemn and stifling darkness of theRomanesque would be replaced by the flow of continuous radiance at the heart ofthe Gothic.By 1133, Abbot Suger informs us, he had collected artists and craftsmen “fromall lands,” including a contingent of Arabic glassmakers. Suger did not inventstained glass; as we saw in chapter 4 [15_chapter-title-6.html], the Fatimidshad used it in their mosques for over a century. Glassmaking seems to have beena component of the alchemical process. We find it mentioned in the preparationsof certain “sands” described in the “Isis the Prophetess” text. The Fatimidscholars and mystics of Cairo used colored glass fashioned in geometricalpatterns as a meditation tool, as seen in the remaining stained glass of the AlAzhar Mosque. The good abbot’s idea was to use the stained glass to fill theinterior of his church with sparkling jewel-like color.Bright indeed is the noble work. Abbot Suger approached the building of his newchurch with all the enthusiasm and attention to detail of the alchemist inpursuit of the philosopher’s stone. To Abbot Suger, perhaps, his newlight-filled church was the true philosopher’s stone.The cathedral (see fig. 7.3) was finished in 1144, and the dedication wasattended by a veritable who’s who of the mid-twelfth century. Louis VIIattended, with his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine (from whom he would soon bedivorced), as did most of the bishops of the Western Church and hundreds ofknighted nobles. Even Bernard, who was heard to grumble at the expense ofgilding a church, attended.From its beginnings at Saint-Denis, the new style spread first through centralFrance and then all over Europe, from England to Germany, from Portugal tonorthern Italy. The collection of artists and craftsmen assembled by Abbot Sugerdeveloped into schools and guilds that traveled throughout Europe for the nexttwo centuries or so creating a vast collection of Gothic churches and civicbuildings. Twelve years after the good abbot’s death in 1151, his student thebishop of Paris, Maurice de Sully, and his “master mason,” Guillaume de Paris,paid him the compliment of bettering his design.On an island in the Seine, the new cathedral of Notre-Dame-de-Paris rose slowlyinto the light-filled sky. Work on the choir and transepts was begun in 1163 andnot completed until 1182. By the time the construction of the nave was underway, another change was sweeping through Christendom.Jerusalem and most of the Holy Land were conquered in 1187 by the forces of theSeljuk sultan Saladin. The West was stunned, and plans began for an immediatecrusade, the third according to modern historians. (The Second Crusade had beenthe unhappy affair undertaken in 1147 by Louis VII, during which Abbot Sugerruled France as regent. Suger, in fact, did do so well with the realm’s financesthat Louis’s disastrous crusade hardly made a dent in the royal coffers.) In themidst of this political upheaval occurred the Cutting of the Elm at Gisors, theschism between the Order of Our Lady of Zion and the Knights of the Temple ofSolomon and the start of the persecution of the Cathars. For over a decade, Zionhad been building a private power base back in Europe, and after the loss of theabbey on Mount Zion, the entire order relocated, as we saw above, to its variousholdings in Paris, Bourges, and Troyes.image [images/image212-00.jpg]Figure 7.3. The cathedral of Saint-Denis, in the suburb of Saint-Denis, justnorth of Paris. (Photo by Darlene)This shift began in 1152, the year after Abbot Suger’s death, with Louis VII’sgift to the order of the large priory at Orleans of Saint-Samson, another DarkAge saint with Merovingian connections. By 1178, the order was confirmed by thepope in its possession of houses and large tracts of land from the Holy Land toSpain. The Cutting of the Elm at Gisors did more than just split off theTemplars from its parent order; it defined the boundary line between thePlantagenets on one side, supported by the Templars, and the Capetians on theother, supported by Zion. This division would eventually produce not just thedestruction of the Templars by the French king Philip III and his papal puppetClement V, but also the catastrophe of the Hundred Years War between France andEngland.As the walls of Notre-Dame-de-Paris rose, the foundations of the new illuminatedChristendom began to crumble. The loss of Jerusalem, and eventually the rest ofOutremer, made the universal nature of the Church questionable. An alternativeform of Christianity, whose imagery would appear in the decorations of Chartres,Notre-Dame-de-Paris, and the cathedral at Amiens, attempted an end run aroundthe power of the Roman Church by appealing directly to the nobility’s chivalricsense of destiny with the Grail romances and to the common people’s unrepentantpaganism with an emphasis on Mary as the Mother of God and Queen of Heaven. Withthe failure of the Third Crusade and the subsequent strife among its leaders,this grand plan began to falter.The orthodox Roman Church fought back in the so-called Crusades againstChristians. First, almost by accident, Constantinople was conquered in 1203 bythe Fourth Crusade. This empowered Pope Innocent III to go after the heretics insouthern France in 1208. Fifty years later, with southern France and its culturedestroyed, the hope of a new kind of Christianity, once so promising, had beenlost. The esoteric stream that surfaced briefly to create this Gothicrenaissance went underground once again.THE GOTHIC CATHEDRALS OF OUR LADYThe flowering of the new Gothic architecture and the renewed sense ofspirituality that went along with it can be attributed to the conjunction of twopowerful intellects, Saint Bernard and Abbot Suger, and a vast source of wealth,technology, and international organization. The only possible sources of suchwealth and sophistication were the Order of Zion and the military orders, theTemplars, and, to a lesser degree, the Hospitallers, which the Order of Zioncontrolled or supported. Evidence to prove the connection between the Templarsand the overall construction of the cathedrals is scanty to nonexistent, butwhat little we do have suggests that the Templars regularly paid for the majordecorations on the facades of the cathedrals, while more local sources offinancing, including the Cistercians in some cases, paid for the major work onthe structural elements of the cathedral building.This suggests that the Templars were more interested in the images and storiesthe cathedrals presented to the public than they were in the actual design andconstruction of the buildings. Yet this is possibly misleading, because as theTemplars lost their hold on Outremer in the late 1100s, the master masons andarchitects who built such Templar masterpieces in Palestine as the Krak deChevaliers were freed for work in Europe. The sudden twenty-six-year rebuildingof the cathedral at Chartres has been attributed to an influx of workers andmasons from Acre and other sites in Outremer. And at Chartres, the Gothicarchitectural techniques reached their pinnacle. The work on Notre-Dame-de-Pariswas changed in mid-project, around 1230, to accommodate these advances in flyingbuttresses and ogival supports.While there is no evidence of Templar involvement or financing withNotre-Dame-de-Paris, such involvement is not unlikely. Guillaume de Paris, themaster mason who designed the building and most of its exterior decoration, isan enigma without much of a history. Maurice de Sully was a student of AbbotSuger’s, and his sudden rise to bishop of Paris in 1160 was certainlyaccomplished with help from powerful connections. Some of those connections,through Saint Bernard and the Cistercians, did in all likelihood include theTemplars. Robert de Sable, first grand master of the Temple after the fall ofJerusalem, was reported to have paid for the decorations on the Portal of SaintAnne around 1195, but the evidence is somewhat contradictory. It is also likelythat some Templar masons worked at Notre Dame after the completion of Chartrescathedral in 1220, but again, no direct evidence remains.What we do have is a pattern of interconnectedness that combines the Capetianand Merovingian royal families and their supporters with the Order of Zion andits fronts and cover organizations, such as the Templars and the Cistercians,and centers on the unparalleled wealth and influence needed to create the Gothiccathedrals. The Templars were not overtly involved in creating the cathedrals ofOur Lady; it was the organization behind them, the Order of Our Lady of MountZion, and its new power centers in the Church, which was responsible for theexplosion of cathedral building that followed Saint-Denis. They of course workedbehind the scenes and used prominent spokesmen such as Bernard to push theiragenda of reform.Saint Bernard’s family connections to Zion and the Templars—his uncle André deMontbard was a founding member of the Order of Zion’s militia du Christi—areexamined in chapter 5 [17_chapter-title-7.html]. Bernard was a devoted reformerof the Church who, it seems, wanted to institute a new kind of Christianity thatappealed directly to the spirituality of the masses. At the same time that hewas proposing the Templars as the model of Christian chivalry, and therebyenlisting the upper classes, he was also preaching a new theology of Mary, themother of Christ, as the vessel by which divinity reached humanity, and thusreaching the dispossessed mass of people who still believed in the Great MotherGoddess, be she Isis or the Roman Matrona. Needless to say, this is far frombiblical, in both tone and authority. The very idea of a goddess, even couchedas the Mother of Christ, was slightly blasphemous.But after the success of Saint-Denis, and under the considerable influence ofBernard’s preaching, the new-style cathedrals would all be devoted to Our Lady,the Mother of God and Queen of Heaven. The facades of these cathedrals told theapocryphal details of her life and of those who had interacted with her inwonderfully expressive sculptures that are some of the treasures of the era (seefig. 7.4). There had been churches and even cathedrals dedicated to Our Ladybefore 1150, but they were few and hardly spectacular or noteworthy. After 1150,and for the next several centuries, it was, in one of a variety of forms, themost popular title for a church or cathedral in Europe. Mary, as an ideal, wasthe motive force behind the Gothic renaissance.As we have seen, veneration of Mary began as early as the first century inProvence. Saint Trophime established the first shrine to Mary the Mother of Godin Arles around 46 C.E. The full flowering of Marian devotion would take anothermillennium to develop, until in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries it inspiredsome of mankind’s most amazing artistic triumphs. The brief facts in the Gospelswere filled in with rich details in the apocrypha of the early church. Mary isgiven parents, Anne and Joachim, to match the Davidic lineage of Matthew, anImmaculate Conception, and her own virgin birth.8 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg8]image [images/image216-00.jpg]Figure 7.4. Shrine to Mary at the eastern end of Notre-Dame-de-Paris. (Photo byDarlene)Perhaps the most curious of these early stories, and certainly the mostsignificant from the perspective of later developments, is the tale of Mary andthe Temple found in the apocryphal Book of James. There we are told that thehigh priest set Mary on the altar, where she danced as the Shekhinah so that allIsrael might love her, and that she remained in the Temple until adulthood “as adove and she was nourished at the hand of an angel.” The angel informed the highpriest, one Zacharias, on Mary’s fourteenth birthday that it was time for her towed, and he assembled all the eligible bachelors and widowers in Judea. Theangel assured him that an unmistakable sign would allow him to choose the rightman.Among the crowd was Joseph, a young carpenter, and he, in the quaint words ofthe tale, had his “rod” in his hand along with the others. When he presented his“rod” to Zacharias, a dove sprouted from it with a burst of blinding light andflew up to heaven. This was such an unmistakable sign, Mary being a dove in theTemple, that Joseph was immediately chosen. This at first scared him, as well itmight, but eventually he relented and took Mary as his wife, saying: “Behold, Ihave taken you from the Temple of the Lord, and now I leave thee in my house.”9[36_endnote-title.html#ggg9]This obviously symbolic tale hides a great deal of esoteric information, but itis the next event that truly brings the whole complex of symbolism into focus.After Joseph goes back to work, Mary, echoing her modern sisters, also goes backto work in the Temple. Since she is no longer, as the dove of Shekhinah, theintermediary between the Holy of Holies and the high priest, a veil is nowrequired. Seven holy virgins are chosen to do the work, and Mary, as the former“goddess,” is included to make eight. Hence, the eight-rayed star became sacredto Mary, who completed the veil of the Temple—the veil, of course, that isdestined to be torn asunder on the death of her son.Mary is chosen to dye and spin the thread for the colors red and purple, thecolors of royalty and sacrifice and the alpha and omega of the visible spectrumof light. As she does so, her old friend the angel of the Temple returns andtells her what the future holds, including the birth of the Son of God. Shefinishes her spinning and shows the cloth to the high priest who declares onsight of it that Mary will be blessed as the vessel of illumination to allfuture generations, the theotokos. This act of spinning connects the Virgin withArtemis/Arachne/Ariadne and the Greek Fates and the Roman Parcae, as well aswith the Gallic-Celt Parsii, the benefactor goddesses of fate whose templemarked the lucky island in the Seine where Notre-Dame-de-Paris would rise over amillennium later.This apocryphal story has little or nothing to do with Judaism as it waspracticed in the first century in Judea. The wise women of Exodus, of which onewas perhaps traditionally Miriam, Moses’ sister, wove the first temple veil, nota group of virgins in the late first century B.C.E. And of course, women werenever allowed in the sanctuary of the Temple. If the story has nothing to dowith Judaism, then where does it come from?The answer is from the Egyptian Gnostic tradition, particularly such Gnostictexts as the Kore Kosmica, or “Virgin of the World,” and other Isis texts in thehermetic works of the era. The Book of James is Gnostic only by subtext, and soit survived to become part of the Catholic apocrypha, but other texts did notfare as well. But even the Book of James goes on to relate Isis to Mary by meansof the miracle of the grain during the flight to Egypt. Without realizing it,perhaps, the author of the Book of James has repeated one of the oldest storiesof the Egyptian delta concerning Isis, pregnant with Horus, and her pursuit bythe usurping king/uncle Seth. In this version of the tale, it is Isis, using thespirit of Osiris inside her, who makes the grain grow to hide her trail.Fulcanelli informs us directly that the Virgin and Isis are the same symbol.“Formerly the subterranean chambers of the temples served as abodes for thestatues of Isis, which at the time of the introduction of Christianity intoGaul, became those black Virgins, which the people in our day surround with aquite special veneration. Their symbolism is, moreover, identical . . .”10[36_endnote-title.html#ggg10] A few pages further on in the same chapter,Fulcanelli casually drops the piece of the puzzle that allows the meaning of thepattern to come into focus:“It is a curious hermetic analogy that Cybele [just identified with Isis andMary] was worshipped at Pessinonte in Phrygia in the form of a black stone,which was said to have fallen from heaven. Phidias represents the goddess seatedon a throne between two lions, having on her head a mural crown, from whichhangs a veil. Sometimes she is represented holding a key and seeming to drawback her veil. Isis, Ceres and Cybele are three heads under the same veil.”11[36_endnote-title.html#ggg11]Suddenly, like a clap of thunder on a clear day or a sudden flash of light in adarkened room, much that had been obscure was revealed.THE STONE THAT FELL FROM HEAVEN, BLACK VIRGINS, AND THE TEMPLE OF THE GRAILThe Anatolian highlands of central Turkey are as forbidding today as they werefor the first wave of Christian crusaders in the summer of 1197. The SangariusRiver cuts its way through the cliffs of soft, pinktinted stone headingnorthwest for the Sea of Marmara and the ancient port of Nicea, now calledBusra. The Sangarius is now the Sakarya, but no matter how the place-names shiftin pronunciation, the geography remains the same. The old Byzantine post roadand caravan route heads southeast from Nicea along the river, running straightas an arrow until it begins to wind its way up the western edge of the centralAnatolian plateau (see fig. 7.5).A week out of Nicea by caravan was the Byzantine garrison town of Doryleum.Perched on the edge of the plateau at the point where the river heads away fromthe road, it had clear strategic significance. More important to the locals forthe last eight thousand or so years were the hot springs located there.Destroyed in the War for Independence between 1919 and 1922, the Old City, asits Turkish name Eskisehir proclaims, is actually today a small and bustlingindustrial city. A few miles east of town along the old Byzantine road, however,the site of the crusader battle in 1197 remains virtually untouched.The old road climbs a steep grade between a cliff face and the drop to the riverand then levels off, and the land flattens out toward a curious isolated peakforty miles away on the other side of the river. It is a lovely spot, asisolated now as it was then, and it is easy to see how the Seljuk sultan KilijArslan picked this spot for the perfect ambush.The crusaders had split their forces into two sections. When the vanguard campedat dusk on June 30, 1197, the rear guard was just moving into Doryleum. Beforedawn on July 1, the vanguard moved out down the valley toward the ancient roadjunction, watched by the sultan and his advisers from a small hill known as theFortress of Falcon. Believing that this was the entire force of crusaders, thesultan sprang his trap.As the day wore on, the Turkish attacks rolled up in waves to break against theiron line of the crusading knights, inflicting a few casualties but never reallythreatening to break through. The Turks counted on the heat to broil alive thecrusaders in their armor, and as the afternoon lengthened and the knightsretreated up the valley, it appeared that the strategy would work. But just asthe crusaders in the vanguard were beginning to falter, the consequences of thesultan’s error became apparent.The rear guard poured through the pass and smashed into the Turks in front ofthe Fortress of the Falcon as another force, under the papal legate the bishopof Puy, swung around the hill and fell on the rear of the Turkish forces. Thesultan, knowing a defeat when one was handed to him, fled eastward toward thedistant mountains. Most of the Turkish forces were killed or driven into theSangarius, and the crusaders celebrated a great victory. A few days later theymarched southeast by the middle of the three ancient roads and passed over theTaurus Mountains toward their destiny in Jerusalem,12[36_endnote-title.html#ggg12] never knowing how close they had come to theTemple of the Grail, the original home of Wolfram’s lapsit.image [images/image220-00.jpg]Figure 7.5. The Anatolian highlands of central Asia Minor.Driving eastward along the modern road to Ankara, which follows the route of thesultan’s flight, the stark and solitary mountain dominates the landscape. Thisis Mount Dindymus, the holy mountain of the ancient Phrygians, sacred to themysteries of the goddess Cybele, Queen of Heaven and Mother of the Gods. On thesouthern slopes, a jumble of ancient and modern dwellings tumble down toward thesmall river Gallus, a tributary of the Sangarius. Farther up, just below thesummit, a jumble of stones and walls mark the precinct of the ancient temple,looking in the afternoon sunlight like a ruined and tarnished crown.This ancient pile of ruins was the sanctuary of the goddess who descended toearth as a stone, a large black and silver-flecked cube of a meteorite. Caveswind from the sanctuary all the way down to the river below, and the actualmysteries were conducted in large corbel-vaulted underground chambers. On MountDindymus, little remains of these chambers, but at the Cybele temple in Vienne,France, we can still see the walls of its crypt and its pillars.13[36_endnote-title.html#ggg13] These massive underground chambers would providethe foundational support, literally and figuratively, for many of the Gothiccathedrals, including Chartres, Notre-Dame-de-Paris, and Amiens, just as themyth of Cybele and her Grail stone would provide the spiritual insight andsoaring imagery. And at the heart of the hermetic expression lay the ancient artand science, the threefold transmutation of alchemy.We’ve all heard the story. Somewhere far away in Asia Minor there was a kingnamed Midas who wished for the power to turn ordinary objects into gold. The godDionysus granted his wish, except that everything he touched turned to gold.Since this meant that Midas could not eat or drink, he was soon begging the godfor release from his boon. Dionysus sent him to the sacred river and afterwashing in the water, which sparkled forever after with flecks of gold, the kingwas cured of the “Midas touch.” Here, in brief, is the alchemical archetypeitself, the meme in mythic form.14 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg14]The Midas of Greek legend is undoubtedly mythical, but real kings named Midas orMitas or Mithras did indeed rule in the Anatolian highlands. While the legend isfull of delightful strangeness, as we shall see, the actual history of theregion is strange enough.The Black Sea was a wide forested valley before the Mediterranean spilled overand flooded it in the fourteenth millennium B.C.E., causing the Great Floodmyths of Mesopotamia and central Asia. Along its southern edge, the mountainsrise slowly to the highland plateau, from which a half dozen rivers tumble downtoward the eastern end of the Black Sea. The western end is barren and rockywith only the Sangarius watershed, which empties into the Sea of Marmara. Alongthe upper reaches of the Sangarius, deep in the mountains and twisted rocks ofthe high plateau, a sophisticated culture developed around 1800 B.C.E. Calledthe Hittites, they ruled the region for five hundred years and made their markon ancient history. They had a hieroglyphic form of writing and were the ancientworld’s foremost metalsmiths. They worshipped the earth goddess of Old Europe,along with two consorts, the lord of the sky and the lord of the underworld.15[36_endnote-title.html#ggg15]Around 1200 B.C.E., the Hittites fell to the roving nomads from central Asia,the Indo-Europeans, who would eventually spread from India to Ireland. Over thenext few hundred years these populations mixed and became the Phrygians of theclassical era. The Phrygians still worshipped the Mother Goddess, but whetherthe myth changed with the arrival of the Indo-Europeans or was a remnant of theancient beliefs is uncertain. What is clear is that the goddess got a new andresonant name: Cybele.The name is neither Greek nor Hittite, but is a word in the new Semiticlanguages pushing up from the south. It means “stone of the goddess” and comesfrom the same roots as Kaaba and al-Lat in Arabic. Indeed, given the similarityof names, and the cubic stone of Mecca with its original goddess worship andmeteorite, the Sabeans, ancestors of the Hejaz Arabs, may have been Cybeleworshippers. At any rate, as we saw in chapter 4 [15_chapter-title-6.html], theidea of a stonelike throne, the Cube of Space upon which the great L in the skyof Draco sits, is not too far from Kyb-ele, or stone of the El. It is also the“Precious Stone of the Wise” from the Bahir.The worship of the Mother of the Gods was common to all the ancient traditionsof Europe and the Middle East. The cult of Cybele, however, developed into whatalmost certainly was the first “mystery” school, and as such traveled fromAnatolia to Rome and on to Provence. The major temples of the “mystery” of theMother Stone of the Gods were located on the island of Samothrace, off the coastof Lydia in Asia Minor, at Memphis in Egypt, at Thebes in Greece, and at Nimesin Provence. The oldest and most important center remained at Pessinus on MountDindymus, where the cubic stone, the mystereion that contained the essence ofthe goddess, was kept.16 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg16]Because of the fragmentation caused by time, cultures, and languages, we risklosing the larger pattern if we focus too closely on any one goddess figure orregional mystery teachings. Only by looking at all the versions of the myths andlegends can we piece together anything resembling a complete picture.Cybele was not only mother of the gods, but also mother of humanity. In someversions, as Rhea, she mated with her father, Kronos, and begat the Titans, fromwhom came both the Olympian gods and mankind. The images that have survived showher on a throne, which resembles the Egyptian glyph for Isis (a throne), flankedby a pair of lions, an echo of the Egyptian goddess Sekhmet. In some images sheis shown in a chariot drawn by a pair of lions. In her hands she holds acircular drum or tambourine and a chalice full of the elixir of life. On herhead is, usually, a tower or castlelike crown from which hangs a veil.As Demeter, or as her daughter, Persephone, she descended into the underworldand her return was accomplished with the aid of a clan of Titans, shamans andsmiths who dwelt in caves. For their help, Cybele descended to earth as a cubicstone, which she gave into their keeping as the mysterieon, or objective focusfor the mystery of the cult. As the guardians of the stone, they were calledKabiri, or Kabiroi, the people of the kaba, the stone, as well as the kabirim,the “mighty ones” in Aramaic and Hebrew. In some myths, these Kabiri arereferred to as the children of Aphrodite and Hephaistos, the god of the forgeand volcanoes, the latter from the Latin form of his name, Vulcan.17[36_endnote-title.html#ggg17]As both Strabo and Herodotus noted, the story of the Kabiri is very close tothat of the Egyptian Heru Shemsu, another group of shaman-smiths with ties topre-catastrophe knowledge and the guardianship, at Heliopolis, of another stonefrom heaven, the ben-ben or phoenix stone of the sun god Re. Indeed, therelationship between Re and his “Eye,” the goddess Sekhmet or Hathor, picturedas that of father and daughter, is similar to that of Rhea and Kronos or Cybeleand Zeus. Like the ben-ben at Heliopolis, the stone of the Mother Goddess wasseen as the petrified sperm of the sky god.18 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg18]The stone remained in the temple of Cybele on Mount Dindymus until the turn ofthe third century B.C.E. The tale of how the stone that fell from heaven becamethe stone of exile, to use Wolfram’s pun, was one of the grand yarns of theancient world. In the depths of the Second Punic War, with Hannibal and hiselephants rampaging at will on the Italian peninsula, the Roman senate lostfaith in its gods. As they were tribal deities from Latinum and Etruscia withGreek glosses, they seemed unhelpful and insignificant in the face of the threatposed by the international power of the Carthaginians. The Roman senate decidedto fall back on that “old-time religion,” the worship of the Mother of theGods.19 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg19]Consultation of the Sibylline Books guided the Romans to seek aid from the sameGreat Mother known to their reputed ancestors of Trojan fame. The Delphic oracleagreed that it was time for Cybele to come to Rome. The king of Pergamus, underwhose control the temple and stone at Pessinus lay, was not so enthusiastic. Ittook an earthquake and a comet or a brilliant meteor shower to convince him.Accompanied by the Gallae, the priestesses of the shrine, the stone departed byship for Rome. Miracles occurred along the way, including an interval of divinenavigation and an escort of dolphins. The noblest lady of Rome, Claudia Quinta,personally welcomed the entourage of Cybele at Ostia and pulled the ship ashorewhen it grounded on a sandbar with her own virtuous strength, an episodeconsidered to be another miraculous sign.20 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg20]At Rome, the Mother of the Gods was appropriately housed in the temple ofVictoria, an echo of the shrine to Nike, victory, on Samothrace, in the 550thyear after Rome’s semimythical founding. From distant Phrygia came her essence,the silver-and-black meteoric stone from the starry heavens, with a conclave ofthe Galli, male-born priestesses whose order had served the goddess formillennia. Rome initiated a thirteen-year construction plan to honor Cybele witha worthy temple on the Palatine Hill. From Claudia’s own lineage would come manyof Rome’s greatest, as the fortunes of Hannibal, and Carthage itself, witheredlike a dying branch.The temple was called the Matreum, and the worship of the new civic goddess, theMagna Mater or simply Matrona, spread rapidly throughout the Empire, blendingalong the way all the older forms of the Great Goddess. The stone remained inits domed temple until at least the mid-fourth century, when Julian the Apostatewrote a hymn dedicated to it and the goddess. “Who is then the Mother of theGods? She is the source of the intellectual and creative gods, who in their turnguide the visible gods: she is both the mother and the spouse of mighty Zeus;She came into being next to and together with the great Creator; She is incontrol of every form of life, and the Cause of all generation; She easilybrings to perfection all things that are made. Without pain She brings to birth. . . She is the Motherless Maiden, enthroned at the very side of Zeus, and invery truth is the Mother of All the Gods. . . .”21 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg21]Compare this to the anonymous fifth-century hymn to Mary: “And we will write nowthe praises of Our Lady, and Mother of God, the Virgin Mary. . . . Thou shalt benamed the Beloved. . . . Thou art the pure chest of gold in which was laid upthe manna, that bread that comes down from heaven, and the Giver of Life to allthe world. . . . Thou art the treasure which Joseph purchased, and found thereinthe precious Pearl. . . . Thou hast become the throne of the King whom theCherubim do bear. . . . All the kings of the earth shall come to thy light, andthe people to thy brightness, O Virgin Mary.”22 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg22]Should we, then, consider the veneration of Mary as the Mother of God to be anextension of the cult of Cybele, the Great Mother? The answer seems to be yes,and Christian tradition appears to agree. After the Crucifixion, Mary wasreported to have traveled to Ephesus, in Asia Minor, where she died and wasburied. As we know from the Acts of the Apostles, Ephesus was the center of thecult of Artemis, the Roman Diana, as the Great Mother. After preaching againstthe temple, Saint Paul was accosted by a silversmith who declared: “Great isDiana of the Ephesians.” Yet it is in Ephesus that Mary was first officiallydeclared theotokos, or Mother of God, in 431 C.E.23[36_endnote-title.html#ggg23]As the Church labored on into the Dark Ages, the ancient statutes and shrines ofOur Lady were dedicated to the Virgin. The most sacred and venerated of thesestatues depicted the Mother Goddess as black, echoing the stone itself, and theybecame the Black Virgins. Their sacred sites and shrines are in the same places:springs and wells, caves on mountaintops, and grottoes of all kinds. The BlackMadonna of Lyons is enshrined on a hilltop in a church built from the ruins ofthe former temple to Cybele, a case of direct transfer still visible to themodern tourist.24 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg24] The crypts ofNotre-Dame-de-Paris and Chartres retained their Black Madonnas and shrines toMatrona. The Black Virgin of Chartres, Our Lady Underground, is still there. Allof these cave sanctuaries echo the caves, grottoes, and caverns that riddleMount Dindymus in Phrygia. The original Kabiri were cave-dwelling shaman-smiths,and Fulcanelli instructs us that “[r]eal, but occult, power . . . develops inthe darkness.”25 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg25]As we researched the individuals involved in the story of the cathedrals, theCrusades, and the Templars, we discovered that they all, from Gerbert ofAurilliac to Saint Bernard, had close connections with, or were directlyinspired by, the Black Madonnas. Eventually we realized that tracking the BlackMadonna connections was the surest way to follow the current. The Merovingianstories of miraculous Black Madonnas arriving in self-propelled vessels seem tobe directly attributable to the Cybele stone’s voyage to Rome. Even Peter theHermit stopped at every major Black Madonna shrine in France as he preached theFirst Crusade (see fig. 7.6). Clermont, where Urban II announced the FirstCrusade, has no fewer than five ancient Black Madonnas. The one in the cathedralcrypt was originally a Roman statue of Cybele of the Springs, and the cathedralitself was built over the older temple, using, as was common, its undergroundvaults as the foundation.26 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg26]Saint Bernard, who brought devotion to the Virgin into the religious mainstream,was inspired by a direct, and miraculously alchemical, encounter with the Virginherself. As a youth, Bernard would spend hours in prayer before the BlackMadonna of Dijon, another Roman Cybeline statue, this one with enormous breastsand a pregnant stomach. Finally reciting the Ave Maria Stellis, “Hail the Starof Mary,” before the Black Madonna one night, the Virgin appeared to him and fedhim three drops of her milk. Like the drops from Ceridwen’s cauldron that gavethe Celtic shaman Taliesin the understanding of the language of the birds andknowledge of all hidden things, these drops of milk transformed the youngBernard into the eloquent saint and reformer who almost single-handedlyrevitalized the Church.27 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg27]image [images/image226-00.jpg]Figure 7.6. Map of France showing (1) Cathar sites; (2) the location of churchesdedicated to Notre Dame; (3) the Black Madonna sites mentioned by Fulcanelli;and (4) other Black Madonna sites.Fulcanelli, in section 8 of the Paris chapter of Le Mystère, gives us a list often prominent Black Madonnas, including two of the most famous,Notre-Dame-de-Rocamadour, “the rock beloved of the light,” andNotre-Dame-de-Puy, home of Adelmar, papal legate of the First Crusade and hometo a Cybele/Mary connection with a sacred stone that dates to the first centuryC.E. Fulcanelli has much to say about the Black Virgin, and about her miraculousmilk, as we shall see in the next chapter, but perhaps the most significantthing Fulcanelli has to impart concerning the Virgin is this: “Obviously what isdealt with here is the very essence of things . . . the Vase containing theSpirit of things: vas spirituale.”28 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg28]If we consider that, like Cybele and her stone, the Grail and the Grail Queen,and the Shekhinah, are identical, then the vessel of Our Lady, which containsthe vital spirit, is the mountaintop temple, cave, or grotto. This containeracts as a “house” that allows the ethereal spirit to coalesce into the physicalform of the goddess. We find this in the Bahir, where in verses 4 and 5 we aretold that the “house” is built by wisdom and filled with understanding, out ofwhich flows the stream of gnosis. This is the supernal temple, and the bayit, orhouse, of Joseph where the Virgin dwells before giving birth to the Christ. Itis formed of the sefirot Chokmah, Wisdom, and Binah, Understanding, which inturn creates the non-sefirah of Daat, or knowledge. Daat is a void or a vesselin which, when filled by mind, the animating spirit of matter, is the reflectionof Kether, the Godhead, which cannot be approached while still in the body.Gnosis, knowledge, or Sophia, the light-filled void of the Buddhists, is asclose to the divine as we can come.29 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg29]Understanding this allows us to grasp the meaning of the ending of Wolfram andWalter von Scharffenberg’s Tituriel. The Grail, as the essence of the Goddess,must be housed in a vessel or temple before Sophia, Gnosis, can become tangibleenough to communicate her blessings, or the Christ Emmanuel, the christos withinus, can be born. The Tituriel’s vision of the castle of the Grail on theMountain of Salvation is the esoteric and inner spiritual motive behind thecathedral-building explosion. The Gothic cathedrals, it seems, were designed tohouse the spirit of the Great Goddess, making them living Grails that heal andtransform all who enter their portals.Everything—the structure, the colored light of the great windows, the images onthe facades—was designed to accommodate this sense of wonder and gnosis. In theGothic cathedrals, with their connection to Cybele, the Great Goddess, and theBlack Madonnas, we find all the various threads of the ancient science ofalchemy combined into one tangible mystereion designed to last through the ages.And the greatest of these Grail cathedrals is Notre-Dame-de-Paris, the cathedralof the philosophers.THE PHILOSOPHERS’ CHURCHAmong the crowd at the consecration of the abbey church of Saint-Denis on June11, 1144, was a young Parisian student on his way up through the ecclesiasticalhierarchy. Our knowledge of Maurice de Sully’s early history is sparse. Born inSully-sur-Loire of humble parents, he apparently studied at the abbey of Fleuryand came to Paris around the age of seventeen to study at the university on theLeft Bank. Along with most of Paris that day, Maurice would have followed thepilgrim route of Saint Denis’s martyrdom, from the place of his torture on theeastern end of the Ile-de-la-Cité to his jail cell near what is now the flowermarket, and then on to climb Montmartre to the Martyrium on its height. Fromthere it was a pleasant walk down to the abbey. Along the way, some of thepilgrims always discovered that their faith had been answered, that Saint Denishad healed them.We can imagine the twenty-four-year-old Maurice pushing his way into the newchurch to catch a glimpse of the Mass of Masses, celebrated by nineteen bishopsbefore the gilded altars. Abbot Suger himself thought that the crowd “believe[d]themselves to behold a chorus celestial rather than terrestrial, a ceremonydivine rather than human.”30 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg30] It had its effect onthe young cleric Maurice. In less than twenty years, Maurice de Sully would risefrom obscurity to become the bishop of Paris and a confidant of kings. Along theway, he would plan a new cathedral to replace the aging churches on theIle-de-la-Cité. The new cathedral, dedicated to Our Lady, would rise over theruins of the ancient temples to Matrona and the Celtic Mercury, as well asChildebert I’s Merovingian cathedrals.31 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg31]When Clovis I established Paris as the center of the new Frankish Christianity,the Church still honored the traditions of its mystery-school origins by makinga distinction between those who had been baptized and those who had not. Theunbaptized were asked to leave before the sacrament, and so most early churcheshad a covered porch where the unbaptized could depart without disturbing therest of the worshipers. In the fifth century, this practice developed into thehabit of building two cathedrals, or seats of episcopal power, one for theunbaptized believers and the other for the elite, the partakers of thesacrament.32 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg32]And so Childebert I built two cathedrals on the Ile-de-la-Cité. Saint-Etiennewas the larger church of the common congregation, while its companion, thesmaller church of Our Lady, served the inner core of the baptized elite. Thus,from its very beginnings, Notre-Dame-de-Paris has been the initiates’ church. Wemight even suspect, given the altars found in the crypt in the eighteenthcentury, that the inner core of the Merovingian church adhered to some verypeculiar concepts of Christianity, such as a devotion to a goddess figuresimilar to Isis. Notre Dame served as a connection point with the very ancientmysteries that Christianity was supposed to supplant.The Merovingian Notre Dame had been destroyed by the Viking assault of 856. Itwas quickly rebuilt and served as a rallying point for the successful defense of885–86. From then on, Saint-Etienne lost its stature and the episcopal seat wasfirmly established at Notre Dame. Unfortunately, we have no contemporarydescription of the Carolingian church, and not a stone remains to suggest itsappearance. The site was chosen by Maurice de Sully for his new-style cathedraland stripped down to its Roman foundations, the crypts of Matrona, or Cybele.33[36_endnote-title.html#ggg33]Planning began in 1160, as soon as Maurice was elected bishop of Paris. Thevisiting pope Alexander III laid the cornerstone around the spring equinox of1163. The pope, a refugee in France from the church’s first Franco-Italianschism, publicly officiated at the consecration of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, theformer church of Saint Vincent and the Holy Cross. A private ceremony was heldto lay the cornerstone of the new cathedral, and Bishop Maurice began to buildwith gusto. The choir was completed and the high altar consecrated in 1182. Thepatriarch of Jerusalem preached the Third Crusade from the half finishedNotre-Dame-de-Paris in 1185. By the time Maurice de Sully died in 1196, the navewas done except for the roof, which was paid for in Maurice’s will.34[36_endnote-title.html#ggg34]Work began on the western facade around the turn of the thirteenth century, andby 1220 it was finished up to the level of the Gallery of Kings. The flyingbuttresses were added, influenced by the newly completed cathedral at Chartres,around 1230 as the nave was reconstructed. Chapels were added between theexterior buttresses as the southern tower began to rise above the gallery. Itwas finished in 1240, and work shifted to the northern tower. The towers reachedtheir present height by 1245 and the first bell, Guillaume, was installed in1248. As soon as the reconstruction of the nave was completed in 1250, workbegan on the transept facades. They were finished by 1270. The next twenty yearssaw chapels and flying buttresses added to the choir and the chancel rebuilt.Except for the interior, major work on Notre-Dame-de-Paris ended soon after theturn of the fourteenth century.Although construction continued for a century after his death, Maurice de Sullymay be considered the guiding intelligence behind the entire project. Thewestern facade was designed and even sculpted long before work began. Some ofthe sculptures were done in the 1170s, soon after construction on the cathedralstarted. The transept facades were designed later, but they were inspired by thesame mystical vision that inspired Maurice. Although we have evidence of Templarsponsorship only for the Porch of Saint Anne, the Virgin’s mother, on thesouthern tower of the western facade, it seems more than coincidental that allmajor work on Notre Dame halted, leaving the original design unfinished, just asPhilip IV suppressed the Knights Templar.35 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg35]The 150 years from the consecration of Saint-Denis to the suppression of theTemplars defines the main arc of the cathedral-building movement. The impulsefaded away in the fourteenth century, leaving cathedrals such as Notre Dameunfinished. The Black Death in the second half of the century seemed toaccelerate the decline. The Gothic buildings of the fifteenth century are smallchurches, such as Saint-Jacques-la-Boucherie, built by Nicolas Flamel, andprivate homes, such as the Lallemant mansion in Bourges. Clearly, the visionwent underground after the disasters of the fourteenth century.But Notre-Dame-de-Paris remained. A history of France could be written aroundits rise and fall in the national consciousness. The choir screen was finishedjust as the Black Death swept over Europe. Paris suffered an eclipse offortunes, as did all France, during the Hundred Years War. This struggle betweenCapetian France and Plantagenet England was actually backed and promoted by theopposing sides of the Templar-Zion schism. Notre-Dame-de-Paris saw the funeralof the mad king Charles VI, who in 1422 had repudiated his son in favor of theEnglish. Nine years later, in 1431, the English king Henry VI was crowned kingof France in Notre Dame Cathedral.Unfortunately for Henry, in those nine years Joan of Arc, a vassal of Renéd’Anjou, had rewritten history. After her example, and the tactical skills ofDuke René, lifted the siege of Orleans, Charles VII had been crowned at Rheims.In 1436, he liberated Paris from the English. For the next 346 years, a Te Deumwas sung in Notre Dame on the first Friday after Easter to honor the deliveranceof the capital from its English occupation. By the time Charles VII died in1461, nothing remained of Plantagenet France except the port of Calais. Hisfuneral, like his father’s, was held in Notre-Dame-de-Paris.The fifteenth century continued to hold the venerable cathedral in respect, butthe winds of change were blowing. It was during the lifetime of Charles VII thatthe word gothic was first applied to the lux continua style of Saint-Denis andNotre Dame. The Italian self-proclaimed universal genius, Leon Battista Alberti,misunderstood Abbot Suger’s reference to “goth” in its medieval sense ofJewish,36 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg36] and assumed it meant “rustic,” from thebarbarian Goths who sacked Rome in 410 C.E. From this he dismissed the style,with its exuberance of forms and imagery, as a product of the fantastic tastesof the barbarians. Fulcanelli informs us that this canard has survived thecenturies, even though the more exact term might be ogival for the style’spointed arches, because it does reflect the inner meaning of the cathedral’struth. The Gothic art of the cathedrals is to Fulcanelli the secret language,the art of light and the art of magic that animate the dead stone of thebuilding into a light-filled revelatory experience.The idea of the medieval as barbaric, however, was one that was much in tunewith the tenor of the Renaissance and its emphasis on classical forms. Thesixteenth century saw the old cathedrals as symbols of the Church’s power andinfluence, and as the protest against the Church of Rome grew, the cathedrals,including Notre-Dame-de-Paris, felt the brunt of the assault. It was sacked bythe Huguenots in 1548, and it was the site of the beginning of the SaintBartholomew’s Day Massacre, prompted by the marriage of Henry IV and Margueriteof Valois there in 1572.Religious wars paralyzed France for eighty years. Louis XIII promised in 1638 torebuild the main altar of Notre Dame if he had an heir to the throne. Later thatsame year, a Te Deum was sung in the old cathedral marking the birth of thefuture Louis XIV, the Sun King. Eventually, toward the end of his long reign,Louis would honor his father’s request and rebuild the altar. During work on thecrypt in 1711, a Gallo-Roman votive pillar was found, and it is from the imageson this pillar that we gain a glimpse of the spiritual antiquity of the spot.This altar stone was the centerpiece of the Roman temple to Matrona that hadoccupied the space of the earlier temple to the Parcae, or weaving Fates. Assuch, it can be seen as a symbolic model for the cubic stone of the GreatMother. The images of Zeus, Esus, Hephaistos, and the Great Mother on the pillarsuggest the local group of four Kabiri, or alchemical initiators. Hephaistos, orVulcan, we have already mentioned as the father of the Kabiri, and Zeus is thefather/son/lover of the Great Mother. Esus, usually referred to as the CelticHercules, is more problematic until we remember that Electra, the Samothracianpriestess of the Great Goddess, was the mother of the Argive line, includingPerseus and Jason. Esus then becomes the original Grail seeker, the originalknight errant in search of the stone of the Goddess.37[36_endnote-title.html#ggg37]In general, though, the eighteenth century was not kind to the old cathedral.Renovations damaged much of the original interior. The stained glass was removedfrom the choir level and the rose windows were remodeled. And then, of course,came the Revolution. The cathedral became the Temple of Reason, and much of itsornamentation was destroyed. The citizens of 1793 toppled the kings of Israelfrom their gallery and the western facade was severely damaged.Napoleon restored relations with the Church and crowned himself emperor at NotreDame in 1804. His son was proclaimed king of Rome in the cathedral at a solemnTe Deum in 1811, as Napoleon planned a vast invasion of Russia. Within a fewyears, Napoleon would go into exile, twice, and the monarchy would be restoredand then overthrown again. The election of Louis-Philippe as king of aconstitutional monarchy in 1830 marked an upswing in the fortunes of Notre Dame.The 1820s and 1830s saw a young Victor Hugo use his romantic sensibilities toshine a light on the medieval exuberance of Notre Dame. Published in 1831 asNotre-Dame de Paris, the novel was an immediate hit and launched a craze forGothic architecture. English readers know it as The Hunchback of Notre Dame,after its main character, the bell ringer Quasimodo, but the novel is trulyabout the cathedral itself. Set in the 1480s, the book captures thattransitional moment when traditional forms gave way to the modern, the books ofstone to the printed page.One young Parisian influenced by Hugo’s novel was the seventeenyear-oldarchitecture student Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc. In the next thirty yearshis name would become synonymous with restoration. While still in his earlytwenties, he was appointed to the national commission for the preservation ofhistoric monuments. There was a new feeling emerging, thanks to Hugo’sromanticism, about the relics of the past.The head of the commission, Prosper Mérimée—best known to us as the author ofCarmen—noticed the young architect and directed his training in the subtletiesof medieval engineering. Soon Viollet-le-Duc was handling the commission’sdifficult projects, sometimes as many as twenty at once. In 1845 he wasappointed architect for the restoration of Notre-Dame-de-Paris, and spent thenext twenty years on the project. No one could have been better prepared for thetask.38 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg38]The cathedral that we see today, and as described by Fulcanelli, is reallyViollet-le-Duc’s reconstruction. From the top of the reconstructed fléchette,where a statue of Saint Thomas bears the likeness of Viollet-le-Duc, throughoutthe entire fabric of the cathedral, the touch of its restorer is apparent ineverything. The Gothic has been refracted through the lens of romanticism, and,to purists such as Fulcanelli, the result is somewhat pallid. Thereconstruction, however, did restore Notre-Dame-de-Paris to its rightful placein the national consciousness.39 [36_endnote-title.html#ggg39]Joan of Arc’s beatification, the first step to sainthood, was celebrated atNotre Dame in 1909. A mass Te Deum was sung for the Armistice of 1918. By thetime Le Mystère des cathédrales appeared in 1926, Notre-Dame-de-Paris waspublicly venerated and privately ignored. The official separation of church andstate in 1905 had cast religion in France into an intellectual backwater.Fulcanelli’s work drew attention to an aspect of the cathedrals that was indanger of being forgotten. The romantic reworking of the Gothic inViollet-le-Duc still contained and concealed an important philosophicalteaching. Fulcanelli identified it as alchemy."},{"pageContent":"image [images/image235-00.jpg]Obviously what is dealt with here is the very essence of things. Indeed theLitanies tell us that the Virgin is the Vase containing the Spirit of things:vas spirituale. “On a table, breast high to the Magi,” Ettelia tells us, “wereon one side a book or a series of golden pages or plates (the book of Thoth) andon the other side a vase full of celestial-astral liquid, consisting of one partof wild honey, one part of terrestrial water and a third part of celestialwater. . . .

A reference to chiliasm in the Hendaye chapter of LeMystère des cathédrales led us to the Gnostic origins of alchemy and itsconnection to the apocalyptic doctrine of chiliasm. Following the fingerprintsof the secret led us into the mystical traditions of all three Abrahamicreligions. We saw how these traditions fragmented and went underground, and thata thousand years ago Pope Sylvester II and the Chroniclers of Mount Zionrediscovered them in the West.These discoveries, which included mathematics and astronomy as well as alchemy,reanimated the West, providing a motive for the Crusades and the great hereticalmovements. One of these movements was the spread of a gospel of light in theform of the lux continua–style of church building initiated by Abbot Suger atSaint-Denis. In ways that are not entirely clear, both the Order of Zion and theKnights Templar were involved in this new cathedral-building movement.By the time our research brought us to this point, we felt that we had answeredmost of our main questions: “Is Fulcanelli telling the truth? Is there anyconnection, in history or tradition, between alchemy and a Gnostic eschatologysuch as chiliasm? And if there is a connection, how has it been maintainedthrough the centuries? Is the secret really displayed on the walls of certainGothic cathedrals?”To answer that last question, we must turn to our hermetic tour guide,Fulcanelli, and the subject of his lessons, the cathedrals themselves. Did thecathedral builders know the secret of the ancient illuminated astronomy, thewisdom of Abraham, and how the alignment of the dragon axis foretold the qualityof time? Does this knowledge still appear on the cathedrals? Without that keypiece of evidence, we can’t be sure that we have the same mystery.Today, walking across the broad parvis in front of the western facade, armedwith a good French guidebook and a copy of Le Mystère, one is first struck byhow massive the cathedral looks. It is hard to imagine, as we watch the touristbuses come and go, loading and disgorging waves of visitors from around theplanet, how the cathedral appeared in its youth. Gustave Doré left us a glimpseof the old congestion on the Ile-de-la-Cité in his illustrations to Rabelais’sGargantua (fig. 8.1). The gentle giant looms over the hemmed-in towers of thecathedral and its crowded surroundings like a cloud, and we catch a briefsensation of how it must have felt to stand in the narrow medieval parvis andlook up at that massive facade and its soaring towers.image [images/image237-00.jpg]Figure 8.1. Gargantua towering over Notre Dame. (Nineteenthcentury engraving byGustave Doré)Walking closer, we find that it is possible to stand, at the edge of the newparvis, and see in one eyeful the entire western front (fig. 8.2). Theimpression it makes from this distance is not so much one of power, but ratherof subtlety and refinement. Harmonies leap out at us and we feel the unity ofthe design. If God is the Supreme Architect, then man could do no less in honorof Him, or Her. With that thought in mind, it is possible, at least slightly, tofeel the faith of the cathedral’s builders.image [images/image238-00.jpg]Figure 8.2. The front of Notre-Dame-de-Paris from the parvis. (Photo by Darlene)When we turn to Fulcanelli, we find that his selection of symbolic imagesfocuses our attention almost exclusively on the western facade. The seal ofAlchemy (see fig. 8.3), the first image discussed by Fulcanelli in his “Paris”chapter, can be found on the base of the central pillar of the great porch, thePorch of Judgment.Our guidebook agrees, with a question mark, however, calling it both Philosophyand Theology as well as Alchemy. The other six images around the base areclearly the liberal arts, listed in the guidebook as Arithmetic, Astronomy,Rhetoric, Geometry, Grammar, and Music. Philosophy, whether theological oralchemical, is indeed the overview required to understand the other six.image [images/image239-00.jpg]Figure 8.3. The figure of Alchemy on the central pillar of the Porch ofJudgment, Notre-Dame-de-Paris. (Plate 2 from Le Mystère des cathédrales)If at this point we can pull our attention away from the Porch of Judgment, thena climb to the towers is in order. On the northeastern corner of the southerntower we find Fulcanelli’s second image, the Phyrigian-capped Alchemist (seefig. 8.4). As Fulcanelli suggests, he is watching over his work, and staringintently at one spot deep in the interior of the cathedral. Interestinglyenough, both of these sculptures, Alchemy and the Alchemist, are restorations byViollet-le-Duc. A fascinating photo survives, and may be seen in the Notre DameMuseum, of Eugène Viollet-Le-Duc standing with an enigmatic smile next to therestored Alchemist, who, seen face on, appears to be deeply shocked by what hesees.Returning to ground level, we find that the rest of Fulcanelli’s Notre Dameimages can be found on the western porches. The next twenty-two images are onthe basement, or lower register, of the central porch, the Porch of Judgment.The guidebook calls them Virtues and Vices, but offers no insight into how thesemeanings apply to the obscure symbols. To give it credit, the guidebook doesmention Fulcanelli and the possibility that these images may have something todo with alchemy, even though it doesn’t agree with his theory.Four images come from the Porch of the Virgin, to the left of the central porch,and the last image from the Porch of Saint Anne, to the right. Fulcanelli usesthe central image on the Porch of the Virgin as an example of the planetarymetals (fig. 8.5), without mentioning the legend that the scene depicts, theresurrection of Mary. As we contemplate this inexplicable gap, the light beginsto dawn. Fulcanelli is choosing his images to form or reflect a predeterminedpattern. He is not concerned with the tales and legends, except as they can beused to demonstrate his point.image [images/image240-00.jpg]Figure 8.4. Alchemist from the south tower, Notre-Dame-de-Paris. (Plate 3 fromLe Mystère des cathédrales)image [images/image240-01.jpg]Figure 8.5. Porch of the Virgin, Notre-Dame-de-Paris. Fulcanelli calls the sevendesigns on the sarcophagus “the symbols of the seven planetary metals.” (Plate26 in Le Mystère des cathédrales)His last Notre-Dame-de-Paris image is the perfect example of this selectionprocess. The central pillar of the Porch of Saint Anne contains a sculpture ofSaint Marcel (fig. 8.6), the Dark Ages bishop of Paris who defeated a localdragon. Fulcanelli goes on for five pages before he mentions the legend. Alongthe way he gets in a few shots at restorers who add romantic flourishes.Fulcanelli insists, however, that the very key to the mystery of alchemy iscontained in the decorative details of the original plinth and its dragon.image [images/image241-00.jpg]Figure 8.6. Saint Marcel on the middle pillar of the Porch of Saint Anne,Notre-Dame-de-Paris. (Plate 30 from Le Mystère des cathédrales)In this image, it is the dragon that is important, not the saint who overcamehim. Our conviction grows that Fulcanelli is choosing his images carefully todescribe a much larger process than just turning lead into gold. Could thisimage be our evidence of the larger eschatological pattern interwoven withalchemy?Walking back across the parvis, we turn once more to look at the western facade.There is so much more information in this cathedral, so many more stories. Whydid Fulcanelli focus on just those images? He augmented them with images fromAmiens and other places, but the heart of the mystery must be here, we feel,bound up with the mystery of Notre Dame itself.Fulcanelli left us clues, however, and those clues are hidden within Le Mystère.The next step is to unravel Fulcanelli’s message, the grand hermetic themebehind the alchemical meaning of the cathedrals, by examining the text of LeMystère itself. Fulcanelli structured Le Mystère as a series of four—fivecounting the later Hendaye chapter— interrelated essays, each of which coverssimilar symbolic territory from different perspectives. The overall result isthat of a complex mosaic, whose unity and integrity of design can be seen onlywhen viewed from a distance. Up close, all we see is myriad tiny symbolicpieces, all important and all fitted just so with the ones around them, but theisolated symbol setting limits our perception. We can’t see the forest for thetrees.To see the message, we must learn to use our minds in what is for us moderns avery novel and foreign way. Much like those computer-generated 3-D images sopopular in the 1990s, in which relaxing the focus of the eyes while allowing“vision” to continue made the hidden image float above the apparently chaoticbackground, we must relax the focus of our intellect and let the symbolsthemselves form the hidden message. When we do this, when we internalize thesymbols to the point that the hidden message floats above the background noise,we are left with a riddle: How does a Tree become a Stone, and then a Star?Fulcanelli is telling us, Solve this riddle and you will know the mystery. Andlike all good puzzle masters, Fulcanelli has included the solution in the riddleitself. But compounding paradox with parable, one can’t know the mystery withoutbecoming the riddle. In Fulcanelli’s case, the mystery of the cathedrals is thestarting point for the personal riddle of his identity.So, taking Fulcanelli as our hermetic tour guide, let us embark on our quest forthe solution to the riddle and the true mystery of the cathedrals.OUR HERMETIC TOUR GUIDE POSES A CONUNDRUM“The strongest impression of my early childhood—I was seven years old—animpression of which I still retain a vivid memory, was the emotion aroused in myyoung heart by the sight of a gothic cathedral.” The opening words of the firstchapter, which is called “Le Mystère des cathédrales,” places us firmly in thepersonal realm. Fulcanelli, from the very first sentence of the book, strikes usas a real person with a message to communicate. “I was immediately enraptured byit. I was in ecstasy, struck with wonder, unable to tear myself away . . .”1[36_endnote-title.html#hhh1]Here is passion, the beginning of a lifelong involvement, an attempt to get tothe heart of “the magic of such splendor.” It never faded, Fulcanelli tells us:“I have never acquired a defence against a sort of rapture when faced with thosebeautiful picture books erected in our closes and raising to heaven their pagesof sculptured stone.”And so, in his third paragraph, Fulcanelli clearly tells the reader the reasonfor his work: “In what language, by what means, could I express my admiration?How could I show my gratitude to those silent masterpieces, those masterswithout words and without voice?” How better indeed than to write a volumeexplicating, for those who could read the symbolism, the great teachingscontained in those “pages of sculptured stone”?But, of course, as Fulcanelli immediately reminds us, they are not entirelywithout words or voice. “If those stone books have their sculpturedletters—their phrases in bas-relief and their thoughts in pointedarches—nevertheless they speak also through the imperishable spirit whichbreathes from their pages.” This imperishable spirit makes them clearer thantheir younger brothers, manuscripts and printed books, because “it is simple inexpression, naïve and picturesque in interpretation; a sense purged ofsubtleties, of allusions, of literary ambiguities.”It is this Voice of the Imperishable Spirit, Fulcanelli suggests, that speaks“the gothic of the stones.” He links this emotive “language” to the grand themeof music by suggesting that even Gregorian chants can “but add to the emotionswhich the cathedral itself has already aroused.”2 [36_endnote-title.html#hhh2]At the very beginning of the book, Fulcanelli slyly informs us that he haspersonally experienced the Voice of that Imperishable Spirit that gives itsauditor the ability to understand “the gothic of the stones.” He knows, in theancient sense of gnosis, the secret behind the symbolism. Here in fact we arereminded of Wolfram von Eschenbach’s insistence, in Parzival, that the mysteryof the Grail, the lapsit exillis, could be understood only by one who hadlearned his “ABC’s without the aid of Black Magic.”3[36_endnote-title.html#hhh3] Only those who have had the initiatory andilluminatory experience can interpret the language of the mystery.From this subtle declaration of intent, Fulcanelli moves on to a bold statementon the value of the Gothic cathedral “as a vast concretion of ideas” in whichthe “religious, secular, philosophical or social thoughts of our ancestors” canbe read. He develops this idea by showing how the sacred and the profane mingledin the civic uses of the cathedrals, from guild rituals, to funerals, tocommodity markets.In this shift, we sense a sleight-of-hand taking place under our very eyes. Withdizzying suddenness, we have changed our focus from the nature and meaning oflanguage and initiation to the practical details of a laboratory for theirexplication. The cathedral, we are told, is “an original work of incomparableharmony; but not one, it seems, concerned entirely with religious observance.”Fulcanelli assures us that along with “the fervent inspiration, born of a strongfaith” there exists “an almost pagan spirit.” This allows the cathedrals toexpress “the thousand and one preoccupations of the great heart of the people”in a way that reveals “the declaration of its conscience, of its will, thereflection of its thought at its most complex, abstract, essential andautocratic.”So far in this first chapter, Fulcanelli sounds a little old-fashioned, aproduct of Hugo-esque Gothic romanticism from the mid-nineteenth century. To hisreaders in 1926, this would have sounded quaint, even comfortingly antiquarian.Fulcanelli continues to play on this assumption on the part of his readers, andeven references the classic scene in Victor Hugo’s Notre-Dame de Paris, byshifting his focus to the Feast of Fools.Here for the first time we encounter Fulcanelli’s chief literary device, the useof italicized words and phrases to create a “hidden” metatext that can be readindependently of the rest of the words on the page. As an example of this, let’slook at just the emphasized words and phrases in the last three paragraphs ofsection 1 of the “Le Mystère” chapter:Feast of Fools . . . disguised Science . . . triumphal chariot of Bacchus . . .Feast of the Donkey . . . Master Aliboron . . . this asinine power, which wasworth to the Church the gold of Arabia, the incense and the myrrh of the land ofSaba . . . mystifiers of the land of Saba or Caba . . . image-makers . . .Procession of the Fox . . . Feast of the Donkey . . . Flagellation of theAlleluia . . . sabots . . . procession of the Shrovetide Carnival . . . Devilryof Chaumont . . . Infanterie dijonnaise . . . Mad Mother . . . their buttocks .. . Ball Game . . .If we cannot solve Fulcanelli’s first symbolic conundrum, then we haven’t muchhope of interpreting the rest of the book. Indeed, if we can assume that he isplaying fair with us, then an important, perhaps crucial key should lie in thisinitial group of emphasized words and phrases. So how do we read it?The first point that jumps out is that Fulcanelli is drawing our attention totwo seasonal church festivals that are similar in tone and very pagan in origin.The first, the Feast of Fools, now familiar to millions from the Disney versionof The Hunchback of Notre Dame, seems to have been a holdover from the RomanSaturnalia. In the Middle Ages it was celebrated as part of the Twelve Nights ofChristmas, usually related to the Feast of the Epiphany. As this is the dategiven in Hugo, we may assume that it is the connection Fulcanelli is drawing forus.4 [36_endnote-title.html#hhh4]The second, the Feast of the Donkey, is part of the Easter celebration andtraditionally marked the spring equinox or the Annunciation of the Virgin,Christ’s conception day. Associated, broadly, with the ass that Jesus rode intoJerusalem during his proclamation as a descendant of David, and with theprophetic ass of Balaam who declared that of this lineage, David’s, a messiahwould come, the Feast of the Donkey, as Fulcanelli suggests, has much moreancient alchemical roots. Fulcanelli’s metatext message points to the“image-makers,” the “mystifiers of the land of Saba,” who are by the implicationof their gifts, gold, incense, and myrrh, the Magi.Fulcanelli then mentions a collection of hermetic holdovers, with “the Gothicchurch as their theatre,” that includes spinning tops, ball games, and othersuch apparently profane and bawdy activities. He connects them to variousShrovetide or pre-Lenten carnivals, and suggests that these are the lastvestiges of the ancient semipagan feasts.If we read these three paragraphs without focusing on the italicized words, wehave a sense that they are meant to inform us of certain pagan traditionsconnected with the cathedrals, but exactly what these are and what they meanremains elusive. We can read these paragraphs hundreds of times, and be fairlycomfortable in our interpretation of their meaning, and yet miss the essentialmessage if we do not look deeply and carefully into the references contained inthose emphasized words and phrases. This is what makes Le Mystère an initiatorytext, a true alchemical document and the “guidebook” to the hermetic quest forthe Grail Stone of the Wise, and which marks Fulcanelli as the last great masterof the green language.SOLVING THE CONUNDRUMHow do we unravel Fulcanelli’s first conundrum? We start by looking at thesignificance of the one solid date given us, January 6, the Feast of theEpiphany. To the early Church, the Feast of the Epiphany, which marked thearrival of the Magi, the marriage at Cana, and the baptism of Jesus by John, wasmuch more important than Jesus’ nativity. For some sections of the Christiancommunity, such as the Cathars, the Epiphany was the most significant moment inthe Church calendar. Some obscure secret seemed to hide behind the juxtapositionof these three events, a secret that threatened to change the very concept ofChristianity as taught by the official church.5 [36_endnote-title.html#hhh5]In this conjunction of symbols, we find a cluster of very revealing clues. Thereis a sexual component in the marriage at Cana, supposedly the Holy Couple’swedding night, as well as in John the Baptist’s acknowledgment of Jesus as hisson during the baptism. The visit of the Magi is a symbol of the largerspiritual current and a nod to the original illuminated ones. The Epiphanysymbolizes a much older tradition than its Christian gloss, and as such was verydisturbing to the Church, which retaliated by shifting the focus to Christ’snativity.There is no biblical basis for the date of the Nativity, and what Gospelevidence there is suggests Jesus was born in the late fall, not in midwinter.The early Church had no traditions or celebrations of the Nativity until thethird century, and such celebrations didn’t become common until the fourthcentury. It wasn’t until the fifth century that the date officially becameDecember 25, which was chosen for reasons of religious politics, not any senseof spiritual or historical correctness. The act of saying a mass in honor ofJesus’ birth, hence “Christ’s mass,” or Christmas, on the birthday of his mostpowerful pagan rival, Mithras, was plainly and simply an attempt to absorb andredirect the rival cult’s followers, in effect saying that Christ is morepowerful than Mithras because he supersedes him. It also undercut the importanceof the Epiphany, including the Magi as an afterthought to the Nativity insteadof as the focus of the story.6 [36_endnote-title.html#hhh6]But the Feast of the Epiphany remained a popular semipagan festival. In theeleventh and twelfth centuries, the Feast of Fools was revived and swiftly itbecame a kind of alternative religious expression. The first “guilds,” ororganized brotherhoods of free tradesmen, developed as sponsors and promoters ofthe festivities. Within these guilds were many heretical ideas, some of whichwould surface centuries later as part of Freemasonry. The Church, of course, sawthese pageant guilds as little more than secret conclaves of unrepentant pagansand heretics and did its best to restrain them.The Feast of Fools was connected to the Epiphany through an earlier Feast of theDonkey, or Ass. Held originally between January 14 and January 17, this festivalhonored the ass Mary rode to Bethlehem, and which stood by at the manger, aswell the ass she rode on the flight into Egypt. This ass was also combined withthe ass on which Jesus rode into Jerusalem, and with the prophetic ass of Balaamfrom the Old Testament. In the oldest forms of this pageant, the King of Foolsappears as King Balaak, who summons forth the prophetic ass. As the Feast of theDonkey shifted to the pre-Lenten carnival period, the King of the Asses, or theKing of Fools, was grafted on the survivals of Saturnalia and settled on theEpiphany. This shift, at the height of the Cathar heresy and thecathedral-building boom, suggests that the influences at work within the Churchwere no longer completely orthodox.This festival, or “hermetic fair,” signified, in its total reversal of churchlyauthority, subjecting the “ignorant clergy to the authority of the disguisedScience,” the hidden and “undeniable superiority” of an even more ancientspiritual current. This “gothic” spirituality was symbolized by the King of theWise Fools, whose coronation on the Feast of the Epiphany, celebrating thetangible evidence of Jesus’ Messiah-hood, his acclaim by the Magi, his baptism,and his first miracle, made the point of his precedence and authority evenclearer. This is the original Great King of the Jews, the one whose line Jesuswas merely restoring, Solomon the Wise, builder of the First Temple.Fulcanelli points us in that direction with his curious mentions of the land ofSaba or Caba and its mystifiers and image-makers. The land of Saba is, ofcourse, Arabia and the eastern portion of the Horn of Africa, Eritrea andEthiopia, home of the Sabeans, ancestors of the Arabs and the original buildersof the Kaaba, the holy cube at Mecca, as we saw in chapter 4[15_chapter-title-6.html]. The Sabeans were probably worshippers of a mothergoddess along the lines of Cybele in Phrygia, whose name may in fact have beenadopted from the Sabean original. The Caba of El, Cybele, is certainly theconcept behind the sacred stone of Mecca, seen originally as the vulva of theMother Goddess Allat (or al-Lat), and throne of her son, the El in the sky, orAllah. Saba is also the home of the queen of Sheba, the original perhaps of theBlack Madonnas. And it is this reference that Fulcanelli wishes us to see in hiscurious metatext clues.Following his thread of clues, we come to a single original source, one that wehave discussed in chapter 6 [18_chapter-title-8.html], an eleventh-centuryArabic alchemical work entitled Mother of the King, by one Abufalah, or the “Sonof Reason.” As noted already, this work entered the later Bahir tradition in thethirteenth century through Rabbi Shlomo, who lifted part of it, uncredited, forhis own alchemical text, the Gates of Heaven. Abufalah’s reference to KingSolomon’s book HaMaspen, suggests that it was an early version of the “GreatMystery” text of the Bahir. In this work, according to Abufalah, Solomon relateshow he learned the secret of alchemy from the queen of Sheba, or Saba.7[36_endnote-title.html#hhh7]As if referencing this obscure text, which stands at the juncture point of allthe traditions and currents we have been examining, from the Bahir to theCathars, from the Templars to the Grail romances, were not enough, Fulcanelli’smetatext clues also direct us to an even more obscure work in the golemtradition that spun off from the Bahir and the Sefer Yetzirah. His comments onimage-makers and mystifiers echo portions of the anonymous twelfth-century workSefer ha-Chaim, or the Book of Life. Written around 1200, contemporaneous withRobert de Boron’s Grail romances, this curious work directly connects the golemtradition of animating matter with the main current of Jewish alchemy in theBahir.8 [36_endnote-title.html#hhh8]In this work, we are told that the secret of animating matter concerns thealignment of the merkabah, the triumphant chariot, and the appropriateconstellation. Dust is gathered from this alignment and is then used by “all thewitches and magicians of Egypt” to animate statues. This was, in fact, we areinformed, the method used by Aaron to animate the golden calf while Moses wasbusy on Mount Sinai, and the technique was still used in India and Arabia,according to the anonymous author. This work is also unique in that itrepresents an older form of golem making that does not directly relate to themethods described in the Sefer Yetzirah. This older form is related, by way ofRabbi Shlomo and the other provençal kabbalists, to the alchemical andeschatological implications of the Bahir. The Sefer ha-Chaim seems to be the oneremaining manuscript in which these connections can be found.Fulcanelli goes further, however, by emphasizing the word sabot as a spinningtop, the Hebrew dreidel. This spinning refers to the whirlwind of the mysticalexperience, and the spinning of the celestial mill as the movement of the skygrinds out time. As we saw in chapter 4 [15_chapter-title-6.html], this conceptis an important one in the Bahir. Fulcanelli’s insistence on connecting thesemetaphors with the Feast of the Epiphany forces us to consider the significanceof that moment in time. Is there an astronomical and eschatological clue here aswell?Indeed there is, but we must step back again to see it. Fulcanelli draws ourattention to the vernal equinox, the point from which we measure theprecessional age. The vernal equinox is now moving from Pisces to Aquarius, as alittle more than two thousand years ago it moved from Aries to Pisces. In themedieval text The Mother of the King, which Fulcanelli is citing, we are told ofa mysterious image that could foretell the future that was required before theStone of the Wise could be used for transmutation. This “image” could be ablueprint of the precessional process showing the merkabah points, the celestialalignments, from the Sefer ha-Chaim. But why the insistence on the Epiphany?Could there be something marked by that date, January 6, that has a significancein the larger pattern of precessional mythology?In the second and third centuries B.C.E., the vernal equinox fell on the cusp ofAries/Pisces and the winter solstice fell on the cusp of Capricorn/Sagittarius.A thousand years later, due to precession, the winter solstice fell in themiddle of Sagittarius. As it is now, another thousand or so years later, itfalls on the cusp of Sagittarius/Scorpio. January 6 is fifteen days after thewinter solstice, and around 1100 fell on the former winter solstice point, thecusp of Capricorn/Sagittarius. The Feast of the Epiphany is then marking thesame precessional era, the “age” noted by the vernal equinox in Aries/Pisces,except that its rise to prominence in the twelfth and thirteenth centuriesseemed to be marking more than just the original winter solstice point. We canalso see it as a way of counting down to the arrival of the next precessionalage, with the vernal equinox on Pisces/Aquarius.The millennial notions of the era seemed to have been sparked by noting thissignificant point. When the cusp moved across the Epiphany, as happened in thetwelfth century, a crop of new millennial prophecies emerged both in the Jewishkabbalistic groups and in the Christian communities. Both the Elijah the Prophetvisits that sparked the publication of the Bahir, and the prophecies of Joachimof Flores are connected to this secret event. Joachim, in fact, dated thebeginning of the third segment of this zodiacal age to 1260, which is just alittle over ten degrees of precession from the next cusp/winter-solsticealignment, which is currently in progress. The sudden and almost desperate boomin cathedral building appears designed to climax at the end and beginning pointof Joachim’s ages, 1260. Certainly, in the case of the almost incredibletwenty-six-year rebuilding of Chartres Cathedral, some prominent but unspokendeadline forced the completion of the work. The cathedrals of Our Lady, perhaps,were intended to house the spirit of the new age, the age of the Holy Spiritaccording to Joachim of Flores.Fulcanelli, then, in his very first metatext conundrum, supplies us with all theclues required to solve the mystery of the cathedrals. But to uncover thatsecret, to find the disguised science hidden in the cathedrals, requires anintellectual quest of the highest order. Fulcanelli plays fair, and gives us atthe very beginning all the clues we shall need to interpret the hidden message.But we must do our part of the work, and carefully follow those clues.SAINT MARCEL’S DRAGONFulcanelli’s initial riddle supplies us with a vast amount of information,connotations, and connections when we unravel it. However, the dragon-axiscomponent of the Teli as described in the Bahir is missing from the riddle. Theelement of eschatological timing is referenced in the connection to the “image”that foretold the future in Abufalah’s tale of Solomon and Sheba, and the hiddenimpact of the original winter-solstice point crossing the Epiphany is clearly afactor in the sudden rise of cathedral building. But so far, no dragons.For that we must wait until section 6 of Fulcanelli’s “Paris” chapter. Thissection is devoted entirely to one image, the dragon and plinth of Saint Marcelon the middle pillar of the Porch of Saint Anne (see figure 8.6). Fulcanelliinforms us that this statue “describes the shortest practice of our Science andamong lessons in stone it therefore deserves pride of place.” This short or drypath, in contrast to the longer moist method, is done with “[o]ne single vessel,one single matter, one single furnace,” and can be accomplished in days ratherthan months or years. “The hermetic emblem of this method,” Fulcanelli assuresus, can be found on the dragon and its pillar.9 [36_endnote-title.html#hhh9]Considering that Fulcanelli cites no fewer than three other hermeticists on theimage of Saint Marcel and the dragon, we might suppose that this is indeed thekey alchemical figure on the entire cathedral. This suspicion is heightened bythe quote from Grillot de Givry that Fulcanelli uses to launch his discussion:“See . . . sculptured on the right portal of Notre Dame of Paris, the bishopperched above an athenor, where the philosophical mercury, chained in limbo, isbeing sublimated. It teaches the origin of the sacred fire; and the Chapter ofthe cathedral, by leaving this door closed all the year in accordance with asecular tradition, shows that this is not the vulgar way, but one unknown to thecrowd and reserved for the small number of the elite of Wisdom.”10[36_endnote-title.html#hhh10] From this we may safely assume that if there everwas a single agreedupon image on Notre Dame that did in fact sum up theinnermost secret of alchemy, Saint Marcel and the dragon is it.When Fulcanelli finally turns to a description of the dragon and its markings,after a lengthy digression on the nature of the dry method and a few swipes atrestorers who don’t understand what they are restoring, we find a very precisedepiction of what can only be the dragon axes: 1. A longitudinal band, beginning at the head and following the line of the backbone to the end of the tail. 2. Two similar bands, placed obliquely, one on each wing. 3. Two broader transverse bands round the tail of the dragon, the first at the level of the wings, the other above the head of the king. All these bands are ornamented with full circles, touching at a point on their circumference.11 [36_endnote-title.html#hhh11]Just to make sure that we have not missed his point, Fulcanelli continues: “Asfor the meaning, this will be supplied by the circles on the tail bands: thecentre is very clearly marked on each one of them. Now, the hermeticists knowthat the king of the metals is symbolized by the solar sign, that is to say acircumference, with or without a central point. It therefore seems reasonable tome that if the dragon is covered in a profusion of auric symbols—it has themright down to the claws of the right paw—this is because it is capable oftransmuting in quantity. . . .”12 [36_endnote-title.html#hhh12]We can recognize these symbols from the discussion in chapter 4[15_chapter-title-6.html]. Fulcanelli notes a line down the spine of the dragon,from head to tail, and this is clearly a teli or dragon axis. This image couldbe representing either or both of the great axes, from the center to edge of thegalaxy as well as the ecliptic pole axis from the constellation Draco, theDragon, to the Lesser Magellanic Cloud. It also symbolizes all the other uses ofthe head and tail of the dragon, from marking the moments of eclipses to markingthe standstill and equal points of the solar cycle.The lines on the wings represent the backward-moving precessional alignment ofthe dragon axis, which forms the Cube of Space in conjunction with the othertwo, more stable axes. On the dragon, these lines are not perpendicular, but areinstead set at an oblique angle. Since the original has been lost, we can’tmeasure their angle, but it is just possible that it matched the winter-solsticeposition, measured from the galactic axis, appropriate for the time it wasbuilt, roughly 720 years ago, or ten degrees of precessional arc from a cubicalignment, as is illustrated in figure 8.7.The two bands of circles on the dragon’s tail can be seen as representations ofthe two opposite-moving cycles, the procession of the solar year and theprecession of the Great Year. As Fulcanelli tells us, these are in fact solarsymbols, noting the solar or zodiacal quality of the months or ages in eachcycle. Saint Marcel’s dragon is therefore none other than the grand Leviathan ofHeaven, the triple dragon axis from which the Cube of Space is formed, displayedas an all-at-once symbol of the entire astronomical and eschatological processunderlying alchemy. As it is also a description of the quick or dry path ofalchemy, the secret of secrets, then we can see why this image, above allothers, is the major initiatory key to the Gothic alchemists, includingFulcanelli.image [images/image253-00.jpg]Figure 8.7. This figure illustrates the precession of the equinoxes. The equinoxpoint on the ecliptic moves one degree counterclockwise every seventy-two years,causing the equinox points to move backward through the zodiac one sign every2,160 years. When the spring or vernal equinox fell on Aries/Pisces in thesecond century B.C.E., the winter solstice fell on Capricorn/Sagittarius. As weare now entering a new precessional era, the spring equinox and the wintersolstices are moving backward toward the cusps of Sagittarius/Scorpio andPisces/Aquarius. Around 1100 C.E., the actual winter solstice point moved acrossthe January 6 Epiphany date, sparking a wave of millennial fervor.We can also be sure that Fulcanelli wants us to connect this dragon to the Teliof the Bahir, because he also describes the decoration on the plinth in terms ofthe Tree of Life: “Finally, on each side of the athenor and under the very clawsof the dragon are the five unities of the quintessence, comprising the threeprinciples and the two natures, and finally their total in the number ten ‘inwhich everything finishes and comes to an end.’ ”13[36_endnote-title.html#hhh13]The last phrase is an unattributed paraphrase from the Sefer Yetzirah: “Theirmeasure is ten which have no end; a depth of beginning and a depth of ending.”The Sefer Yetzirah continues in the same vein: “Their vision is like theappearance of lightning and their limit has no end.”14[36_endnote-title.html#hhh14] The Sefer Yetzirah is describing the ten sefirotor emanations of divinity and the twenty-two letters that connect them. Thesephilosophical speculations would be organized in the Bahir into the Etz Chaim,the Tree of Life. Fulcanelli, with his sly paraphrase, directs us toward thereal secret of Saint Marcel and the dragon. It is the plinth that holds themystery.On the plinth in figure 8.6, we see a central pillar on each face, and fourcommon pillars, one on each corner. Fulcanelli tells us that the athenor isformed from the four elemental qualities. Following the directions from theSefer Yetzirah, to which Fulcanelli has guided us, we can see four overlappingtrees on the cubic plinth. We can place the middle pillar of the Tree of Life onthe face of the plinth, or on the corner pillar, and still be correct, althoughthe overall design suggests that the corners are the middle pillars of the Tree.In any case, we have the Tree of Life within the Stone of the Wise, which isdescribed in the Bahir and was discussed in chapter 4 [15_chapter-title-6.html].Therefore, in this one symbol, Fulcanelli presents us with a capsule summary ofthe important points of the ancient illuminated astronomy. Since the Templarswere known to have been involved in financing the construction of the Porch ofSaint Anne, we might expect that this singular symbol would also revealsomething of their secrets. And indeed, the dragon curls around a man’s head asit emerges from its athenor, symbolizing the connection between the Templars’Baphomet, the head that symbolized the bet’amet, or place of truth, andilluminated astronomy.We may take this as evidence that the secret of astro-alchemy is truly displayedon the Gothic cathedral of Notre Dame. The image of Bishop Marcel’s dragonserves as a thread linking the ancient wisdom of Abraham, Solomon, and theSabeans with the mystery schools of Alexandria and the medieval secret societiesthat built the cathedrals. The thread continues down to Fulcanelli, who, knowingthe secret, chose his images carefully to fill in the outline of the ancientwisdom.At first, Fulcanelli’s choice of images, out of the many available to him on thefacade of Notre Dame and its porches, seems whimsical or even just a chaoticdeluge of allusions and interconnections. Only when his pattern of selection iscorrectly seen as an attempt to present a specific interpretation of thekabbalistic Tree of Life, as suggested by the dragon’s plinth, does the apparentchaos resolve into the masterly order of the hermetic grand theme.This grand theme of ten spheres and twenty-two paths, the Tree of Life, isaugmented by Fulcanelli’s juxtaposition of symbols from other locations, such asAmiens cathedral and private houses in latefifteenth-century Bourges.Fulcanelli’s system of symbolic juxtaposition reveals, in ways not unlike thatof surrealist art, deeper meanings behind the emerging symbolic construct. It isalmost as if Fulcanelli, the master of symbolic art, had inadvertently stumbledonto the magic secret of surrealism. Or, more likely, surrealism is merely thelatest artistic expression of a hermetic worldview stretching back into themyths of antiquity.THE WORLD TREE AND ASTRO-ALCHEMYOur earliest surviving alchemical text, the Egypto-Hebraic “Isis theProphetess,” tells us that Isis received the secrets of alchemy from a compositebeing, Amnael, whose name is suggestive of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. Butwhat, exactly, is the Tree of Life?To the ancient Egyptians, the Tree of Life was symbolized by the Djed pillar,the backbone of Osiris (see fig. 8.8). The Djed began as a power object in theNeolithic cultures of the Nile delta. It symbolized “stability,” or rather“divine establishment.” The World Tree or World Axis is a common motif inshamanic traditions that stands for the infrastructure of the universe. As thissymbolic image/idea of the world pillar as axis of the universe became a word,djed, it was associated with similar-sounding words in order to give it aphonetic spelling. Djed is also the Egyptian word for “to speak,” “to declare,”“to say.” With emphasis, Ddd-jed, it is the sacred word itself, speech deified.Interesting as this is, it is the other roots that really strike a suggestivenerve. Djedd, same word with a slightly different emphasis, means “star” or,actually, the culmination or azimuth of the star. This same word, djedd, is alsoa perfectly good Hebrew word dzeth, and they both mean “olive tree.” The sameword, in very similar pronunciation, is found in both Coptic and Arabic. Theolive tree is the original Tree of Life, perhaps even the burning bush of Moses(see the light verse, Koran 28:37). The combination of the idea of star and theimage of the Tree of Life suggests an interesting cluster of meaning associatedwith the Djed.The roots of these Egyptian words form a complex that encompasses the conceptsof speech, including divine speech, the culmination or zenith of a star, and anolive tree, the Tree of Life itself. This complex web of words tells us that theancient Egyptians thought of the Djed as something divinely pronounced, a“word-tree” that links life on earth and the stars.The Indo-European group of languages has a complex of root words that aresimilar to that which we have just outlined in Egyptian for the word djed. Inthe reconstructed language known as proto-Indo-European, the World Tree is theoak, *drw. Just as the olive tree was the Tree of Life in theMediterranean—because of its ability to supply food and therefore ensure socialstability—the oak provided the same benefits for the ancient Indo-Europeanswandering out of the central Asian grasslands into the vast forests ofpostglacial Europe. The word for “oak” also meant “firm,” “strong,” “stable,”and “enduring” in the Indo-European language groups. Our English words truth,trust, and tree come from the same root word. Druid is also in the *drw familyand means “seer of the oak.”In Sanskrit, another Indo-European language, the word for “tree” is daru, aderivation of *drw. In the Rigveda, the ancient ceremonial hymns of theIndo-Aryan conquerors of India, we read that the Tree is the material “fromwhich the gods have fashioned Heaven and earth, the stationary, the undecaying,giving protection to the deities.”15 [36_endnote-title.html#hhh15] The Tree isthe cosmic pillar around which the entire universe was thought to revolve. ThisWorld Tree was often shown in Indian folk art as a great tree crowned with thePole Star, which is called dhruva, another derivative of *drw, and which meantthe “firm one” or “fixed one.”image [images/image257-00.jpg]Figure 8.8. The Egyptian Djed pillar, World Tree and backbone of Osiris. To theancient Egyptians it was the divinely pronounced Word/World Tree connecting lifeon Earth with the cosmic drama of the stars.To the rational mind, this idea of the Pole Star as an eternal tree strikes usas a kind of nonsense. Yet in an experiment conducted by Dr. Jonathan Shear ofMaharishi University in the late 1970s, we find that this tree embodies astrange kind of truth.The experiment centered on a sutra in part three of Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra thatstates that “by performing samyama on the Dhruva, the Pole Star, one gainsknowledge of the motion of the stars.”16 [36_endnote-title.html#hhh16] Samyamais a deep state of rapport that allows for an actual transfer of energy orinformation with whatever one is focusing on, be it an image of a deity or thePole Star.17 [36_endnote-title.html#hhh17]In his paper, published in the January 1981 edition of the journalMetaphilosophy, Shear reports that he expected his subjects, all skilledmeditators, “to perceive the motion of the stars in the context of the heavensas we are accustomed to perceive and think about them.” This, however, didn’thappen. The meditators were instructed to do the practice that would induce thestate of samyama while holding their focus on the Pole Star. The expectation wasthat if they received any insight at all into the workings of the Pole Star, itwould be in the form of commonly perceived images and concepts.However, instead of the usual time-lapse sky wheel familiar to us from Lifemagazine photo spreads, the meditators reported something very different. “ThePole Star is seen [in the meditators’ inner vision] at the end of a longrotating shaft of light. Rays of light come out from the shaft like the ribs ofan umbrella. The umbrella-like structure on which the stars are embedded is seenas rotating. . . . The whole experience is described as quite spectacular,blissful, colorful and melodious.”18 [36_endnote-title.html#hhh18]The meditators themselves were taken by surprise by this experience. They had noidea that this image of the World Tree was an actual archetype—that is,something that exists outside themselves in the collective unconscious—untilthey stumbled across it. Shear is emphatic when he states: “[T]he experience isthe innocent by-product of the proper practice of the technique.” In otherwords, the practice triggers an experience that is contradictory to thecommonsense and educated perspectives of the experiencer.Here is our archetypal Djed. The Rigveda tells us that “on top of the distantsky there stands / The Word encompassing all.” Stability, in the sense of theword djed, the backbone of Osiris as the World Tree, becomes the link betweenearth and the stars. We are stable only as long as we are connected to ourstellar source. At the very least, Shear’s experiment shows us that a spiritualrapport with the stars can produce information not available to the senses. Theimage of the World Tree and its umbrella-like spokes is not apparent to theobserver. It can be perceived only by entering a state of consciousness whereits nature can be experienced.The ancient seers used techniques such as those in Shear’s study to investigatethe universe around them.19 [36_endnote-title.html#hhh19] The information theyreceived from these practices became coded into the religious myths, symbols,and structures of the ancient world. This spiritual canon, or structured andgeometric organizational hierarchy, is the mathematical equivalent of the greenlanguage of the troubadours. “Let none ignorant of geometry enter here” hungover the door of Plato’s academy in Athens for good reason.This ancient canon of number almost disappeared with fall of the ancient world.It survived in fragments and in the quotations of the ancients, until an almostunknown English scholar named William Stirling wrote the first formalexplication of it since Vitruvius in ancient Rome. Published anonymously in1897, his book, entitled The Canon: An Exposition of the Pagan MysteryPerpetuated in the Cabala as the Rule of All Art, managed, like Fulcanelli’sMystery of the Cathedrals, to become influential in spite of its obscurity. Itinspired thinkers as diverse as the psychic archaeologist F. Bligh Bond and theperennial Victorian bad-boy magician Aleister Crowley, who liberally sprinkledhis work with swipes from Stirling.According to Keith Critchlow, a geometric philosopher and student of BuckminsterFuller, “the Canon is based on the objective fact that events and physicalchanges which are perpetual are never the less completely governed by intrinsicproportions, periodicities and measures.” As Critchlow notes, “[I]t is to justsuch a hidden intrinsic language that the author of this book (Stirling) hasdedicated himself.”20 [36_endnote-title.html#hhh20]In his chapter on rhetoric, one of the liberal arts surrounding Alchemy on thebase of Notre Dame’s middle pillar, Stirling gives us a simple description ofthe Great Tree of Life: “The process of creation may be expressed by inscribingthe cabalistic diagram in the upper hemisphere, so that the apex or crownreaches to the Milky Way, while the tenth step will coincide with earth.”21[36_endnote-title.html#hhh21] Stirling’s “cabalistic diagram” is the ten-steppattern of unfoldment known to occultists as the Tree of Life, and according tohis explication, it is the basic pattern of the canon itself.He writes: “The doctrine of the Cabala was reduced to a geometric diagram, inwhich ten steps were grouped according to a progressive scheme, so that theemanations of the Spirit of the Elohim issues from the first step called theCrown, and after passing through the whole figure is carried through the ninthstep, and finally reaches the tenth or last of the series.”22[36_endnote-title.html#hhh22] This cabalistic diagram described by Stirling wasfirst elucidated in the second-century Sefer Yetzirah. It depicts reality as theintersection of four different levels of abstraction.Stirling tells us that “the ideas which the ancients connected . . . andcombined into this figure of ten progressive steps, appears to form the basis ofall their philosophy, religion, and art, and in it we have the nearest approachto a direct revelation of the traditional science, or Gnosis, which was nevercommunicated except by myths and symbols.”23 [36_endnote-title.html#hhh23] Fromthis we can see that the framework, the gnostic pattern, behind the universallanguage of symbolism, the language of the birds and the green language, is thisgreat Word/World Tree of geometry.Since Fulcanelli informs us that the argotique of the green language is based ona cabalistic pattern of meaning, it should be obvious that this pattern is theTree of Life of his fellow adepts. That it is not obvious is the result ofmisdirection, conscious or unconscious, on the part of Fulcanelli’s student,Eugène Canseliet.In the “Preface to the Second Edition” of Mystery of the Cathedrals, Canseliet,while displaying his knowledge of the importance of stellar imagery in hismaster’s work, ends with a major piece of misinformation. He states that thejustification for the republication of the book lies in the fact “that this bookhas restored to light the phonetic cabala, whose principles and applications hadbeen completely lost.” While this is somewhat true, Canseliet goes on toconclude that after his and Fulcanelli’s work, “this mother tongue need never beconfused with the Jewish Kabbalah.”24 [36_endnote-title.html#hhh24]He continues by asserting that “the Jewish Kabbalah is full of transpositions,inversions, substitutions and calculations, as arbitrary as they are abstruse.”Again this is true for many explications of the kabbalistic mystery, but it doesnot address the issue of the universality of the Tree of Life itself. Canselietfurther muddies the water by suggesting that cabala and Kabbalah are derivedfrom different roots. Cabala, he declares, is derived from the Latin caballus,or “horse,” while Kabbalah is derived from the Hebrew word for tradition. On thesurface, this is indeed correct, but Canseliet is skillfully avoiding the deepermeanings of both these words, which leads us ultimately to their commonroot—kaba, the stone.Fulcanelli never voiced such opinions in the body of the book. In Mystery of theCathedrals, he obliquely refers to the cabala as the “language of the gods” andscorns the “would-be cabalists . . . whether they be Jewish or Christian,” and“the would-be experts, whose illusory combinations lead to nothing concrete.”25[36_endnote-title.html#hhh25] He goes on to say: “Let us leave these doctors ofthe Kabbalah to their ignorance,” implying those who claimed to be authoritieson the Hebrew Kabbalah. He says nothing against the Kabbalah itself but merelynotes that it is misunderstood by almost everyone. By implication, Fulcanelli isalso saying that he does understand it properly.As we saw in chapter 2 [12_chapter-title-4.html], “Isis the Prophetess” pointsto a Tree of Life motif for its source of wisdom. The Hebrew spelling ofAmnael’s name gives us a clue to its nature. Using Hebrew gematria, the lettersin the name add up to 123, the number of the three-part name of God, AHH YHVHELOHIM, associated with the top three sefirot on the Tree of Life, Kether,Chokmah, and Binah (see fig. 2.9 [12_chapter-title-4.html#fig_2-9]). As notedalready, if we break the name into Amn and ael, we get the numbers 91 and 32.These are both references to the Tree of Life, 32 being the total number ofpaths and sefirot and 91 being the number of the Hebrew word amen, AMN, and theword for “tree,” AYLN.Stirling, in his rediscovery of the ancient canon, concludes that the Tree ofLife is the pattern that underlies the secret language of symbolism, which isthe language expressed by the liberal arts that accompany Alchemy/Philosophy onthe base of the middle pillar of the Porch of Judgment. Fulcanelli himselfpoints to the Tree of Life as the key secret in his description of the dragon’splinth, going so far as to paraphrase the Sefer Yetzirah.Therefore, why should we, on the basis of Canseliet’s prejudice, associateanything else with Fulcanelli’s kabbalistic image pattern? Fulcanelli alsoinstructs us that language is a reflection of the universal Idea, a clearreference to the Word/World Tree. The kabbalistic origins of the art of light,Fulcanelli reminds us, are but a reflection of the divine light.Fulcanelli is not only making use of this kabbalistic Tree of Life pattern, buthe is a master of its symbolic subtleties as well. As he unfolds his array ofimages and concepts, we see the guiding matrix of the ancient Word, the verbumdismissum or lost word of Western esotericism, revealed as the divine World/WordTree."},{"pageContent":"NINEFULCANELLI’S TREE OF LIFE AND THE MYSTERY OF THE CATHEDRALSimage [images/image262-00.jpg]LE MYSTÈRE AS THE TREE OF LIFEFulcanelli informs us that the images on the cathedrals speak more clearly thanwords and books. They are “simple in expression, naïve and picturesque ininterpretation; a sense purged of subtleties, of allusions, of literaryambiguities.”1 [36_endnote-title.html#iii1] The Gothic, he implies, is likeGregorian chants, many voices coming together in a single note. This isimportant guidance for understanding the book as a whole. Fulcanelli combinesimages or voices all juxtaposed on a single note or theme in such a way thatevery voice is related to the theme as a whole. As in music, the structure thatallows this interrelatedness is based on geometry and mathematics. It is nothingless than the hermetic Grand Theme, the music of the spheres, which is depictedwithin the Gothic cathedrals.Fulcanelli introduces the Grand Theme with the arrangement of sections in hisfirst chapter, called “Le Mystère des cathédrales.” From its title we maysuppose that it was meant to impart an overall viewpoint from which the rest ofthe book, the details of the pattern, is to be understood. These nine sectionscan be seen as the lightning flash of creation from the Sefer Yetzirah, witheach section’s images and subjects attributed to one of the sefirot, fromKether, the Crown, to Yesod, the Foundation. The pattern can also be seen asanother interesting symbol: the sword in the stone. The first three sections ofthe book make up the hilt of the subject, and the blade of the sword, whosebasic theme, the hermetic wisdom of the Gothic cathedrals, continues through astone of five interrelated symbols within the cathedrals and on into thefoundation “stone” of Notre-Dame-de-ParisThe next three chapters replicate this initial Tree. “Paris,” the second chapterof Le Mystère, gives us the most complete rendition of the Grand Theme of tenspheres and twenty-two paths, including the Gnostic Path of Return, in thearrangement of the twenty-two images from the basement register of Notre Dame’sPorch of Judgment (plates 4–25 in Le Mystère). “Amiens,” the third chapter,fills in another Tree by giving the reader a deeper understanding of theplanetary influences with images from the lower register of the cathedral ofAmiens’ Porch of Judgment. The fourth chapter, “Bourges,” juxtaposes a series ofmythological images on the planetary spheres, thus creating a fourth Tree.Therefore, each of the “locations,” or sefirot, is attributed to multiple imagesfrom which a composite meaning of the sefirot can be derived. (See appendix D[34_chapter-title-21.html].)The crowning experience, the personal gnosis in the first chapter, is thestarting point of a flash of illumination that Fulcanelli uses to reveal theessential pattern of the alchemical Tree of Life. To the kabbalist, thelightning flash, the creative sequence of the unfolding Light, reveals theunderlying structure of reality in the ten sefirot. In the same way, Fulcanelliuses his experience of the cathedrals, his gnosis, to reveal the pattern at theheart of the mystery. In the symbolic Kabbalah, this lightning flash becomes theflaming sword, which protects the Garden of Eden from human rehabitation. InFulcanelli’s hands, the image becomes the sword in the stone (see fig. 9.1), thealchemical extraction of knowledge from the Stone of the Wise, which initiatesthe Golden Age, a new Camelot, here on earth.The pattern emerges clearly in the first three sections of the first chapter.Following the path of the lightning flash, if section 1 is the point of light,Kether, then section 2 is the light’s expansion into the world of space-time,Chokmah. And so in that section, Fulcanelli tells us of the medical school andthe Saturday meetings of alchemists at “the little Porte-Rouge,” clues to thosewho knew and made use of the cathedral’s secrets. He quotes Victor Hugo todirect us—if we haven’t made the connection yet—to his works, particularly hisNotre-Dame de Paris. Section 2 concludes with another glimpse of Fulcanelli’smotivation. “Indeed I shall consider myself satisfied and amply rewarded if Ihave been able to awaken the curiosity of the reader, to hold the attention ofthe shrewd observer and to show to lovers of the occult that it is notimpossible even now to rediscover the meaning of the secrets hidden under thepetrified exterior of this wondrous book of magic.”2[36_endnote-title.html#iii2]image [images/image264-00.jpg]Figure 9.1. The sword-in-the-stone pattern of the sefirot on the Tree of Lifeapplied to the nine sections of the first chapter of Le Mystère des cathédrales.Section 3 of Fulcanelli’s first chapter, whose subject is the secret language,was discussed in chapter 1 [11_chapter-title-3.html]. As we noted there, thissection is the key to understanding Fulcanelli’s method, which is appropriatefor the sefirah Binah, or Understanding. Together with the first two sections,it completes the supernal triad at the top of the Tree of Life. We can alsothink of the triad as the hilt of a sword, which comprises a pommel, a grip, anda crossguard, and whose blade is the extension of the idea through the stone ofsymbolism into the reality of Notre Dame, the Philosophers’ Church.To pull the sword from the stone, it is necessary to grip, or grasp, the ideassupplied by the hilt. The first three stages of the lightning flash form apattern from which the rest of its path unfolds. Fulcanelli combines these ideaswith his subject, the cathedrals, in such a way as to compel us to look deeperand more closely at the symbols expressed within those cathedrals. In theremaining sections of chapter 1 [11_chapter-title-3.html] of Le Mystère descathédrals, Fulcanelli suggests that the symbolic components of those “books instone” are fivefold and that they form, within themselves, the Stone of theWise.The lightning flash cuts across the abyss as it passes from Binah to Chesed,from Understanding to Mercy. Thus the flash creates its own reflection, and thereflection of the upper three stages in the sequence, as it travels down towardmatter. Fulcanelli follows this pattern, and his fourth chapter focuses on theliteral symbolism of the cross as the basic plan for all Gothic churches. Theshift from theoretical discussions of the language of the birds to theliterality of a cathedral’s ground plan is sharp enough to suggest the pathlessspark of transmission from Binah to Chesed, while the subject of section 4, thecross, directs our attention to life itself.According to Fulcanelli, all Gothic churches, with rare exceptions, are laid outin the form of a Latin cross, which he tells us “is the alchemical hieroglyph ofthe crucible,” since crucible and cross are derived from the same Latin root.And here, Fulcanelli begins to play his symbolic shell game: “It is indeed inthe crucible that the first matter suffers the Passion, like Christ himself.”3[36_endnote-title.html#iii3]Unless we understand the need to connect the cross to the idea of Mercy asconveyed by the fourth sefirah or stage in the unfolding sequence, we shall notquite follow Fulcanelli’s sudden shifts of tone and meaning. His Christian takeis somewhat surprising here until we realize that it is the “mercy” brought bythe experience of the cross that he is trying to convey. The Passover lambroasted on a cross of transformation makes a good literal symbol of God’s mercy.But Fulcanelli, of course, is taking the obvious one step further.“Remember too, my brother alchemists, that the cross bears the imprint of thethree nails used to sacrifice the Christ-body,” Fulcanelli reminds us, like acarnival barker pointing to the pea. These three nails are the anchor points ofthe three axes of the Galaxy, the clue to understanding the true ancient natureof the cross. After shuffling with Saint Augustine and the Paschal lamb,Fulcanelli comes to the point:. “The cross is a very ancient symbol, used in allages, in all religions, by all peoples, and one would be wrong to consider it asa special emblem of Christianity.” Here’s the pitch: Can you find the pea oftruth under all the Christian special pleading?He gives us a hint. “We say further that the ground plan of the great religiousbuildings of the Middle Ages, by the addition of a semicircular or ellipticalapse joined to the choir [see fig. 9.2], assumes the shape of the Egyptianhieratic sign of the crux ansata, the ankh, which signifies universal lifehidden in matter.” He points to an example of this from the “crypts of St.Honoré at Arles,” a sarcophagus lid from the first century that echoes therose-cross ankhs of the Coptic Museum in Cairo.image [images/image266-00.jpg]Figure 9.2. The Tree of Life and the ankh superimposed on the floor plan ofNotre-Dame-de-Paris.To make sure we grasp his point, he adds that the ankh is also the sign of Venusin astrology and of copper in alchemy. Traditionally, as shown in figure 9.3,the ankh sign in the shape of the glyph for Venus is the only form of the crossto contain the complete Tree of Life.The first six sefirot, from Kether to Tiferet, form the loop; Hod and Netzachare the cross arms; and Yesod and Malkuth complete the lower arm. Fulcanelliemphasizes the completeness and ubiquity of this symbol and then begins toshuffle metaphors once more.The cross metamorphoses into a stone: “It is thus that the ground plan of aChristian building reveals to us the qualities of the first matter, and itspreparation by the sign of the cross, which points the way for the alchemist toobtain the First Stone—the corner stone of the philosophers’ Great Work.”Fulcanelli raises the stakes by telling us that “[i]t is on this stone thatJesus built his church” and by insisting that the medieval Freemasons did thesame symbolically, giving the undressed, rough stone the image of the devil.image [images/image267-00.jpg]Figure. 9.3. The ankhshaped symbol of Venus contains the Tree of Life.Fulcanelli tells us that once just such a “hieroglyph” could be found withinNotre-Dame-de-Paris. This “figure of the devil,” called Master Peter of theCorner, was located at the corner of the choir rail, under the rood screen, andthis smudged and blackened stone was used by the congregation to snuff theircandles. Fulcanelli instructs us that this stone, which “was intended torepresent the first matter of the Work, personified under the aspect of Lucifer(the morning star), was the symbol of our corner stone, the headstone of thecorner.” He cites a seventeenth-century reference about the stone the buildersrejected and then directs us to the very first specific image from Notre Damementioned in the book, a bas-relief of Jesus blessing an oddly shaped stone inthe arch of an apsidal chapel on the north side of the cathedral.Somehow the cross, the ankh, became a stone, and not just any stone, but therejected stone that became the headstone of the corner, the support on whichJesus built his church. And somehow this is “the first matter,” “the FirstStone,” the cornerstone of the alchemical Great Work? Just how does a tree—theankh contains the entire Tree of Life and the cross is a component of the WorldTree—become a stone?Herein are revealed great mysteries, to echo our occult carnival barker.Fulcanelli has presented us with the first part of a conundrum, the unravelingof which will take us into deep waters indeed.The answer seems to lie with the ancient myths of the World Tree, at whose feet,in many if not most of the very ancient myths, there can be found a stone orcube that is somehow plugging up the torrent of the deluge. Giorgio deSantillana and Hertha von Dechend uncovered this motif as part of their epicexamination of the transmission of precessional information through the mediumof mythology in Hamlet’s Mill.4 [36_endnote-title.html#iii4] Their scholarshipsuggests a connection between the Ark, which in Sumerian myth is a perfect cube,and the foundation stone that stops the flood. In another version of the ancientSumerian Noah/ Utnapishtim myths, there is no ark at all, just a cubic stonewith a pillar on top that stretches from earth to heaven and plugs the entranceto the watery abyss.This idea is also found in Jewish mythology. The Eben Shetiyyaah, the foundationstone uncovered by King David on Mount Zion, was thought to cap the watery abyssbeneath the Holy of Holies. The idea of a stone, the white altar of tradition,holding back the flood of chaos and catastrophe survived within Christianity. Inaddition to Fulcanelli’s Master Peter of the Corner, similar images are found inRussian and Germanic prayers, where the fire-blackened stone, Christ’s throneand the habitation of the Devil, symbolized the entrance to hell, whose firesare safely contained by its bulk. A German prayer, quoted in Hamlet’s Mill,seems even more explicit: “In Christ’s Garden, there is a well, in the wellthere is a stone, under the stone lies a golden scorpion.”The first of our five symbolic components, the stone from which the sword ofwisdom is extracted, is the cross/stone of space-time itself, the Cube of Spaceformed from the three axes of the Galaxy. Fulcanelli seems to understand this ina way that is even more comprehensive than that of Santillana and von Dechend’sscholarship. And with that deep and ancient understanding, Fulcanelli ispointing us toward the truth about the alchemical and transformative nature ofChristianity.The Tree can also become a stone when the lightning flash from which it isformed strikes the ground. These Zebedee stones, so-called from the sons ofthunder, John and James, in the New Testament, are crystallizations of a subtleenergy, electricity, lightning, grounded into matter. Along with meteorites,these thunderstones, called fulgurites after the thunderbolts forged by Vulcan,have always been considered sacred, as in the Kaaba of Mecca and the ben-ben ofHeliopolis.In many ways, Fulcanelli validates our reading of his pattern with this chapter,so filled with cubes and fours, just as one would expect from the fourthsefirah. (Kether, as a zero point, has no dimensions. Chokmah, as two or a line,has one; while Binah, three, a plane surface, has two dimensions. Only withChesed, four, do we arrive at three dimensions, hence the cube.) The sectionalso points to the overall pattern of the stone or cube formed by the middlefive sections of this first chapter, reinforcing our supposition about thesword-and-stone design. Fulcanelli is forcing the reader to look for deeperpatterns of meaning within ideas that are themselves almost bottomless. At theend of this section, we may not know exactly what the First Matter of thealchemist truly is, but we do know that it is far more comprehensive, anddownright cosmic, than we could otherwise have imagined.Continuing the lightning flash from one side of the Tree to the other, we jumpfrom Chesed to Gevurah, from Mercy to Strength. Again, the discussion in thisfifth section, while it focuses on the labyrinth, circles around theattributions of Gevurah—strength, power, Mars, iron, and so on. On the surface,it seems that the labyrinth has little to do with ideas of strength and power.And yet, as we dig deeper into Fulcanelli’s clues, we find that the metaphor isvery apt indeed.Fulcanelli tells us that church labyrinths were placed at the intersection ofthe nave and the transept, and gives us a list of the remaining churchlabyrinths. He notes the golden rising-sun motif at the center of the Amienslabyrinth in former days, then turns to Chartres. Here he emphasizes thesimilarity between what is “called in the common tongue La Lieue (the league),”and “Le Lieu (the place),” leaving open the suggestion of far travel in oneplace, and moves on to the no-longer-extant illustration of Theseus and theMinotaur that occupied the center of the labyrinth. This, he assures us, is “yetanother proof of the infiltration of pagan themes into Christian iconography andconsequently of an evident mytho-hermetic meaning.”Fine, says the reader, but what meaning?Fulcanelli sidesteps this by declaring that the whole issue is moot because “itis not a matter of establishing any connection between these images and thosefamous constructions of antiquity, the labyrinths of Greece and Rome.” Why not?The theme of the Minotaur fits rather well into the concept of Gevurah, Strengthand Power, so outright avoidance isn’t the answer. It must be that Fulcanelliwants us to focus on a specific kind of labyrinth, not just the broader mythsassociated with the concept. It is not just Gevurah, but rather one specificaspect of Gevurah, the thread of strength that leads to the rising sun, to whichFulcanelli draws our attention.He does this by quoting Berthelot’s Grande Encyclopédie on “the Labyrinth ofSolomon . . . a cabalistic figure found at the head of certain alchemicalmanuscripts and which is part of the magic tradition associated with the name ofSolomon.” This magic image is none other than the ancient seven-turn maze knownto humanity in one form or another for thousands of years and that has come tobe called the Cretan labyrinth. Fulcanelli declares that this labyrinth is“emblematic of the whole labour of the Work,” and, after a long linguisticdigression on the meaning of spiders and Ariadne’s thread, openly admits thatthis form of the labyrinth is a version of the philosopher’s stone.The effect of this rather unexpected explication is stunning, for both itsdirectness and its unusually specific focus. Just what is it about thislabyrinth that could lead Fulcanelli to make such a pronouncement?For one thing, the classical seven-turn labyrinth is mankind’s oldest complexsymbol. We have specific examples that are more than six thousand years old,and, if we accept that the Greek meander is one form of the classic labyrinth,then examples can be found that are almost ten thousand years old. Perhaps thebest single-volume work on the labyrinth, Sig Lonegren’s Labyrinths: AncientMyths and Modern Uses,5 [36_endnote-title.html#iii5] suggests that the originaluse of all labyrinth forms was as a kind of space-time location tool.Lonegren bases this assumption on the sacred geometry of the Cretan labrys, thedouble-headed-ax symbol of the Goddess. As shown in figure 9.4, by using thispattern, which depends on determining true north and designing the width of theax head to match the latitude of one’s location, it is possible to lay out adesign that is correctly aligned to the local lunar and solar year. Of course,this can be done without the addition of the curving and interconnecting lines,which is what makes the labrys a labyrinth.These interconnecting paths are meant to be walked, to be experienced as thatlong journey in one place—in other words, as a metaphor for the soul’s quest formeaning. The golden dawn at the center of the Amiens labyrinth is exactly thepoint. By walking the pattern that orients you, literally, it is possible toglimpse the rise of the inner sun.image [images/image271-00.jpg]Figure 9.4. How the labrys, here composed of four 3-4-5 right triangles, can beused as a cosmic orientation device and as the ground plan for a seven-turnlabyrinth.Following the thread of Ariadne into the maze and then returning, we arereenacting the soul’s journey through death and resurrection. Fulcanelliinstructs us that the thread of meaning that navigates the complex fields of theuniversal “lodestone,” the rising sun behind or beyond our sun, is thearchitecture of the Temple of Solomon, an esoteric reference to the planetarysix-pointed star found in the center of the Tree of Life. The philosopher’sstone, by implication, is formed of these seven planetary components, as shownin figure 9.5.Fulcanelli highlights five of the seven, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, andMercury, as the stone from which the sword is drawn. Saturn, of course, is thegnosis expressed collectively by the first three chapters, the hilt of thesword, while the Moon is represented by the section on Notre Dame, the sword’spoint.Each of these inner five is given, by Fulcanelli, very specific images relatedto both the quality of the sefirot and the Gothic tradition of the cathedrals.The cross and cube of Chesed transposed into the headstone of the corner isobvious when compared to why a labyrinth should represent Gevurah.Yet sacred geometry is the answer. Each of the planetary qualities, from Saturnto the Moon, can be given a structural and mathematical form by constructingsquares based on their numerical lightning-flash order, so that 3, Binah, isSaturn and forms a three-by-three square (see fig. 9.5). Within this, it ispossible to arrange the first nine numbers (3 × 3 = 9) in a pattern so that eachline, horizontal, vertical, and diagonal, adds up to 15.image [images/image272-00.jpg]Figure 9.5. The traditional planetary attributions of the sefirot.Magic squares can be formed for each successive number; 4, or Jupiter, is formedof the first sixteen numbers and adds up to 34 in all directions, and so on.There are many different theories about magic squares, all of which arefascinating and insightful to the mystical mathematician as well as to themagician, but Fulcanelli is directing us toward how the magic square constructsthe labyrinth.One of the mathematical theories about magic squares concerns the mirrorsymmetry of their odd/even patterning. Even-numbered magic squares, Jupiter, theSun, and Mercury, or 4, 6, and 8, respectively, exhibit hemispherical symmetrywhere each side is a reflection of the other; whereas the odd squares, Saturn,Mars, Venus, and the Moon, or 3, 5, 7, and 9, respectively, exhibit radialsymmetry that is reflected outward from a central point. From this we note thatthe odd-numbered squares all have central crosses of odd numbers and alternatingodd and even numbers in the corners. This pattern of radial symmetry allows usto use the odd-numbered magic squares as templates for the classical labyrinths.image [images/image273-00.jpg]Figure 9.6. How the magic square of Mars becomes the plan of the classicalseven-turn labyrinth.Saturn, which in Fulcanelli is the sum of the first three sefirot, is aclassical three-circuit labyrinth. Since Jupiter is an even-numbered symmetricalcube, it is Mars, attributed to Gevurah, and the square of Mars that form theexact seven-circuit labyrinth indicated by Fulcanelli (see fig. 9.6c). (To seehow this works, take a magic square and lightly color in the even numbers. Then,if you have an odd-numbered magic square, go either to the right or to the leftconnecting odd numbers to even numbers around the outside of the square. Thiswill form the basic labyrinth pattern.)image [images/image274-00.jpg]Figure 9.7. A table of kabbalistic planetary and numerical relationships.The magic square of Mars contains the first twenty-five numbers arranged so thatevery direction adds up to 65. This number is indicative, by means of gematria,of both light and Adonai, the Lord, in Hebrew. This suggests that the Marssquare is somehow a master pattern of light, which when translated into theclassical seven-turn labyrinth becomes the interactive architecture of Solomon’sTemple, or, even more exactly, the philosopher’s stone.On the Tree of Life, the path from Gevurah, or Mars, to Tiferet, the Sun, liesthrough the Sphinx, the sign of Leo, the Hebrew letter teth, and the Tarot trumpStrength. This turn toward the light, which is the subject of Fulcanelli’s nextsection, follows the thread to the center, the rising sun. But before we moveon, we need to look again at Fulcanelli’s planetary pattern.Fulcanelli drops the simplest labyrinth square, that of Saturn, and the mostcomplex and enfolded of the magic-square dimensional patterns, that of the Moon,to focus on Jupiter, a cube; Mars, a seven-turn labyrinth; the Sun, a hypercube;Venus, the eleven-turn labyrinth; and Mercury, a hyperoctahedron (see fig. 9.8).While these hypersymmetry patterns are revealing of an even deeper structuralorganization, their planetary attributions suggest an actual pattern in the sky,that of a rising sun with Jupiter and Mars above the horizon and Mercury andVenus below.image [images/image275-00.jpg]Figure 9.8. The magic square of the Sun produces a tesseract, or hypercube.When we see these symbols again, on the Cyclic Cross of Hendaye, we shall findnot only the obvious synchronicity of the appropriate alignment of planets, butalso the possible meaning of the transformation that they symbolize. We shallalso find that the complex geometry of the labyrinth contains the secret of timeitself, the ancient technique of celestial projection and orientation symbolizedby the eight-rayed star of Isis/Mary. But that is far beyond the level ofinitiation that Fulcanelli has planned for the reader at this point.Indeed, at this point, it is enough if the reader grasps the potentialimportance of the labyrinth and its connections to Mars, the thread of Ariadneleading toward the rising sun of Tiferet, and the sacred geometry of thephilosopher’s stone. Having made this as clear as we can, let us turn, withFulcanelli, toward the wondrous light of the rose windows and the sefirah ofTiferet, or Splendor.“All churches,” Fulcanelli reminds us, “have their apse turned toward thesouth-east, their front toward the north-west, while the transepts, forming thearms of the cross, are directed to the north-east and the south-west. That isthe invariable orientation, intended in such a fashion that the faithful andprofane, entering the church by the west, walk straight to the sanctuary facingthe direction in which the sun rises, i.e. the Orient, Palestine, the cradle ofChristianity. They leave the shadows and walk towards the light.”6[36_endnote-title.html#iii6]In this simple and elegant paragraph, Fulcanelli connects us with the labyrinthhe discussed in the previous section, which is oriented according to the sameprinciple, as well as the ancient tradition of temple orientation that extendsfrom the Egyptians to such modern Rosicrucian groups as the hermetic Order ofthe Golden Dawn. Indeed, a study of the surviving rituals of thislate-nineteenth- and earlytwentieth-century magical order provides many curiousnuggets of the secret tradition. While it is not surprising that a magical orderwould base its temple space on the orientation of the Gothic cathedrals, what issurprising is that Fulcanelli knows the underlying geometric reasons why both ofthese “temples” are indeed sacred.To glimpse this level, it is necessary to return for a moment to our evolvingmagic-square pattern. We noted that the Sun’s square, an even-numbered one,could be considered a hypercube, or fourth-dimensional cube. Its mirror symmetryallows one to fold it through the third dimension and form a cube within a cubeof 16 vertices, 32 edges, 24 faces, and 8 four-dimensional cells, as shown infigure 9.8. These numbers, as we shall find in chapter 10[11_chapter-title-3.html], are important to Fulcanelli’s explication of the Sunas shown on the Cyclic Cross of Hendaye. A temple based on this hidden geometrywould therefore partake of the mystical activity of the sun itself, that ofradiating light or illumination.Fulcanelli then directs our attention to the play of light through the rosewindows of the cathedrals, telling us that “the Work unfolds in a circularprogression.”7 [36_endnote-title.html#iii7] This progression Fulcanelliassociates with the wheel of fire, both physical and psychic. He quotes aseventeenth-century alchemical poem that restates the aphorisms of the EmeraldTablet by advocating the middle way, then declares that “the rose alonerepresents the action of the fire and its duration,” telling us that this “iswhy the medieval decorators sought in their rose windows to translate themovement of matter, stirred up by the elementary fire”8[36_endnote-title.html#iii8] into a temporal organization of light.This image of the wheel of the year as a wheel of light describes the meaning ofTiferet, which is attributed to the sun, quite well. Fulcanelli emphasizes thisby drawing our attention again to the star of Solomon, the philosopher’s stoneat the heart of the Tree of Life. He directs us to a collection of six-petaledrose windows, ending with “the splendid blue rose of the Sainte-Chapelle,”9[36_endnote-title.html#iii9] and then suggests that, “since this sign [thesix-pointed star] is of the greatest interest to the alchemist,”10[36_endnote-title.html#iii10] it would be wise to examine in detail the starmotif. And so, leaving “to the reader the task of making useful comparisons” and“picking out the positive truth,”11 [36_endnote-title.html#iii11] Fulcanelliturns to the fourth component, the star.Instead of the clarity and simplicity of the previous section, Fulcanelli buildshis seventh section, attributed to Netzach, Victory, out of a series of quotesor descriptions from ancient sources on the Star of Deliverance, our fourthcomponent of the Stone of the Wise. (For the mathematically curious, please notethat 7 + 4 = 11, the number of turns in a labyrinth formed from the magic squareof Venus, the planet attributed to this sefirah.) As Fulcanelli suggested, atthe end of the previous section, this star was the one that signaled theSavior’s birth, but it is up to the reader to figure out why it has been giventhis position and attribution.And so we are presented with the second half of the great conundrum started insection 4. There we saw how a Tree could become a Stone, and now in this sectionwe shall glimpse how that Stone becomes a Star. But the answer to the conundrumis not easy to unravel, even with Fulcanelli’s help.For starters, he gives us thirteen different glimpses of the star motif, as wellas one bogus reference of modern origin just to see if we are paying attention.The quotations run from Varro’s retelling of the Aeneid to Witkowski’sdescription of a stained-glass window in the old church of Saint Jean at Rouen,and seem to suggest a subject much broader than the Star of Bethlehem.Here are the sources and motifs in the order in which Fulcanelli presents them: 1. Varro: The Star of Venus leads Aeneas to the Land of Grafted Gold, allotted to him by destiny. 2. Gnostic Book of Seth: A people far to the east have a Writing, which tells of the star and the birth of Child, and prescribes the offerings, which should be taken to him at the appropriate time. This prediction was passed from one generation of wise men to the next, who became over time the twelve Magi. Once a generation they gathered in a cave on Mount Victory, where they meditated for three days, waiting on the sign. When it came, it took the form of a small child holding a cross and the instructions to depart for Judea. The rest is in the Bible. 3. Unknown author, apocryphal fragment: Here, the journey lasts thirteen days and the closer the Magi came to Bethlehem the more the star looked like an eagle with a cross above it. 4. Julius Africanus: The scene is a Persian temple built by Cyrus the Great where a star descends to announce the birth of a child, the Beginning and the End, at which all the statues fall down with their faces to the ground as if worshiping the star. The Magi interpret this sign and advise the King to send ambassadors. Bacchus, or Dionysus (of all the gods!), appears and predicts that this new god will drive out the false gods. The Magi depart, and, guided by the star, find Mary and the Child. They have a portrait painted of them, which bears the inscription “To Jupiter Mithra, to the Sun God, to the Great God, to King Jesus, the Persian Empire makes this dedication.” 5. Saint Ignatius: He tells us that the light of this star outshone all others in the sky and that “The sun, moon and the stars formed a choir around this star.” 6. Huginus à Barma: This eighteenth-century alchemist who echoes Saint Ignatius by suggesting that the “real earth” of the prima materia should be “well impregnated with the rays of the sun, the moon and the other stars.” 7. Chalcidius: This fourth-century Gnostic who apparently taught Egyptian star magic comments on Ahc, the Egyptian star of bad fortune, then moves onto the Star of Destiny and the Chaldean astronomers. 8. Diodorus of Tarsus: This Greek post-Pythagorean philosopher of the second century who was influenced by Philo and the Hebrew Kabbalists suggests that the star wasn’t a real stellar body, but a formation of “urano-diurnal . . . force” that assumed the shape of a star to announce the birth of the Savior. 9. Luke 2:8–14: The angel and the shepherd verses familiar to us from our childhood Christmas stories. 10. Matthew 2:1–2, 7–11: The familiar gifts of the Magi story. 11. Numbers 23:8, 24:17: The famous Star out of Jacob verses from Balaam the prophet of Mesopotamia, land of the Chaldeans. 12. Triptych of the Virgin at Larmor: The central panel showing the Virgin surrounded by the sun, moon, and a nimbus of stars, while holding a large eight-rayed star in her right hand, suggests, as Fulcanelli says, the stella maris of the Catholic hymn. 13. Witkowski’s description of a lost stained glass at Rouen shows us a stellar conception attended by the planetary deities.Now, let us do as Fulcanelli directs, and make useful comparisons that willallow us to pick out the positive truth. 1. The Star of Venus tells us that we have the correct sefirah and the Land of Grafted Gold suggests exile and lost homeland themes. 2. Mount Victory again points to the correct attribution, while the story of the Magi introduces the number twelve and, by extension, thirteen when the sign is given. From the Last Supper to the Round Table, this pattern will repeat time after time. 3. The apocryphal fragment echoes the thirteen and points to the star as being in the old constellation of Scorpio, symbolized as an eagle with a cross as the stinger of the current scorpion. 4. Dei Helios is really the Great Sun, or the sun behind the sun, which was seen to control the Great Year of the precession, while mention of Dionysus points to the shamanic roots of Christianity as an ecstatic mystery religion. The image of Mary and child is also suggestive of Isis and Horus, whose cult was contemporary to that of Dionysus. 5. In this snippet, Isis is clearly identified as the center of the galaxy, with the sun and moon and stars forming a choir around her. 6. This alchemical quote suggests the closeness in process between that of the center of the galaxy and the very basis of alchemy. 7. Chalcidius suggests that the same Star of Destiny can be either good or bad, as the Egyptians knew. 8. Diodorus seems to be saying that this stellar sign is not quite what we would think of as a star, but some form of periodic subtle energy outburst. 9. Here’s the good news behind the Gnostic incarnation of Jesus. Matter can be redeemed by an infusion of divine glory, symbolized by the babe born at the cusp of Leo and Virgo. 10. Our familiar story of the Three Kings of the Orient, the Wise Men of the East whose astronomical observations led them to the birth of the Savior. 11. Balaam’s prediction of the Star of Jacob and the scepter out of Israel is very interesting as it is the first messianic prediction in the Old Testament. Balaam of course is not a Hebrew, but a priest or Magi of the god Baal, the God Most High, the old dragon constellation coiled around the still point of the universe, the north ecliptic pole. 12. The Virgin identified with Mary, Isis, and the star of the sea. 13. A glimpse of a Tantric or alchemical procedure for creating a star child.Having found our nuggets of “positive truth,” what can we make of Fulcanelli’smessage in this section?An ancient group of astronomical adepts, the Magi, watched the skies for thesign, which seems to be a new starlike eruption of light in the region ofScorpio’s crosslike tail, near or at the center of our galaxy. When the signcomes, the Magi travel to acknowledge the Savior and find Mother Isis/Mary andher child. They acknowledge her as the center of the galaxy and her child as thesource of the new light, known in the past only to the Magi and the shamans.This new light is linked to the alchemcial process and the Tantric star-child inparticular, while a hint is given that the whole secret can be found in theancient astronomies of Egypt, Canaan, and Mesopotamia.The quotations also suggest, by their number, an esoteric thirteen-sign zodiac,one that is oriented toward the center of the galaxy between Scorpio andSagittarius. This gives us a distinctly different, and quite ancient, view ofthe universe, echoes of which remain in modern superstitions such as the unluckyFriday, Venus’ day, the thirteenth. This chapter is Fulcanelli’s clearestexample yet of the initiatory quality inherent in his presentation of thematerial. By forcing the reader to think and sort through the star myths,Fulcanelli is pushing the reader into an altered state of awareness. Suddenly,the universe looks quite different, older and more significant.And, the careful reader will note, we are far from what is normally consideredalchemy. The next section, taking us deeper into the prima materia, onlyreinforces this sense of strangeness. Alchemy, as Fulcanelli reveals it to us,is very far indeed from the vain lab work of the puffers.“Just as the human soul has its hidden recesses, so the cathedral has its secretpassages.” Fulcanelli guides us through the crypt, a word from the same Greekroot as Venus and copper, of the cathedrals to the secret hiding place of Isis,the Black Virgin. He quotes the “learned Pierre Dujols” that this Black Virginis an “astronomical theogany,” the Mother of the Gods, the Great Idea, as thestone at Die informs us, and then states that the esoteric meaning of the BlackVirgin could not be better defined. Theogany, however, is a curious word,suggesting a blend of meaning. A theogony (as in Hesiod) is an account of thebirth of the gods or a genealogy of the gods, while a theogamy is a marriage ofthe gods, a version of the hieros gamos. The original French theogany suggestsboth of these, implying a genealogy of the union of earth and sky. Using thisodd word in conjunction with the Die stone and its associations with Cybele andthe stone that fell from heaven suggests that both Fulcanelli and Dujols wereaware of the tradition we have examined above.In the mention of Dujols here, we are tempted to see a clever tip of the hatfrom pseudonym to real person, or from teacher to student, but however we readthe personalities, the meaning is clear. The Black Virgin is a symbol of anancient “astronomical theogany,” centered on the mystery of the heavenly stone.In hermetic symbolism, Fulcanelli informs us, this “theogany” is “the virginearth, which the artist must choose as the subject of his Great Work.” He quotesan unreferenced text on the “black substance,” one of the few occasions whenFulcanelli does something so unscholarly, and then hurries on to a list of thesurviving Black Virgins.image [images/image281-00.jpg]Figure 9.9. The Black Virgin of Saint Victor’s in Marseilles. (Plate 1 in LeMystère des cathédrales)Since Ean Begg’s masterly opus on the subject covers all of the Black Virginslisted by Fulcanelli, we shall merely refer the reader to his work. Fulcanellilists seven famous Black Virgins: two at Chartres; one at Puy; one, illustrated,from Saint Victor’s in Marseilles (fig. 9.9); one each at Rocamadour and Vichy;and one at Quimper. He then mentions the Black Virgin seen by Camille Flammarionin the crypt of the Observatory, and called Our Lady Underground, in order toround out his eight.Fulcanelli then shifts to the very ancient statues of Isis mentioned byWitkowski and formerly found at Metz and Lyons. From there, he launches into anexamination of the “cult of Isis, the Egyptian Ceres.” This he equates, with nomore reference than a quote from Herodotus, to the hermetic sciences. He dividesthe order into four degrees that are suggestive on many levels. Fulcanelli,however, seems to be using insider information here, information whose source,probably because of an oath, he cannot reveal. He wants us to note the egg, “thesymbol of the world,” and the four degrees of initiation represented by the Sun,Moon, Mercury, and hierophant, and tries in the next paragraph to give us someglimpse of their meaning.In many, many ways, this is the most important single paragraph in Fulcanelli’sentire book. He begins by directing us back to the stone at Die, which labeledIsis as the mother of the gods, whom he identifies with Rhea or Cybele. Fromthere, he takes us to a village church in the Camargue where until 1610 abas-relief featuring Cybele and with an inscription reading MATRI DEUM could beseen. Then he jumps to Phrygia, where the Goddess was worshipped as a blackstone that fell from heaven, echoing the lapsit exillis of Wolfram’s Parzival.He tells us that she was also worshipped seated between two lions, holding a keyas if to draw back her veil with it. These images, piled on top of the otherimages in this chapter and so far in the first chapter, compel us to look at thewhole subject of esotericism, hermeticism, Christianity, and religion in generalin a wholly unique light, as we have seen in the earlier chapters of this book.Following the clues he gave us, we have come to a surprising answer. Alchemy,the sword in the stone, and the Tree of Life all have to do with universal orcosmological forces whose origins seem to be in the patterns of the heavensthemselves. Fulcanelli is leading us into ever-deeper symbolic waters while verysubtly building a solid ground of understanding beneath us. In this firstsection, he is laying the metaphysical underpinning upon which he will erect, inthe rest of the book, his edifice of Gothic understanding. This will become evenclearer as we turn to the last section in the chapter, which represents theninth sefirah, Yesod, or Foundation, attributed to the Moon. For Fulcanelli, thefoundation of his metaphysical system is the Gothic church, the exemplar ofwhich is the Philosophers’ Church, Notre-Dame-de-Paris.And for those of you waiting for Fulcanelli to make explicit the connectionbetween the Black Virgin and the sefirah Hod, or the planet Mercury, you mayrelax. Fulcanelli cites eight Black Virgins and mentions Mercury in hisdiscussion of the mysteries of Ceres, just to let us know that he hasn’tforgotten his pattern, but he never otherwise makes the connection apparent.However, if we remember that in Egyptian myth, Isis learned magic fromThoth/Hermes, the Egyptian Mercury, then connection becomes the informationitself, the secret language of the Magi. As we explore Fulcanelli’s evolvingpattern on the Tree of Life, we shall see this meaning for Hod become evenclearer. In this usage, Fulcanelli will examine the nature of the PhilosophicMercury and its role in the formation of the first matter. But that is still tocome, and for now Fulcanelli is content to have us focused on Isis as we turn tothe church of Our Lady.Fulcanelli opens the last section of his first chapter by telling us that“having disposed of these preliminaries,” he will now turn to a hermeticexamination of one specific cathedral, Notre-Dame-de-Paris. However, he warns usthat his task will be difficult, because, unlike the medieval students of theArt, the modern hermeticist must deal with the ravages of both time andvandalism.This is a complex section, in which the motif is clearly the foundation of thechurch, in several different meanings of the word, from the eleven-stepfoundation upon which the church was built to the foundation of its Gothic artin the spirituality of the High Middle Ages. Mixed in with this subtlefoundational imagery is Fulcanelli’s nod to the whole sword-in-the-stonepattern, along with an examination of two statues that no longer grace thecathedral front.The first of these stood above the fountain in the parvis of Notre Dame, thestreet in front of the cathedral. Fulcanelli describes it as “a tall, narrowstone statue, holding a book in one hand and a snake in the other.” He quotesthe inscription on the now lost statue: “You, who are thirsty, come hither: if,by chance the fountain fails / The goddess has, by degrees, prepared theeverlasting waters.” He also tells us that the common people called it “MonsieurLegris (Mr. Grey)” or “the Fasting Man of Notre Dame.”Fulcanelli turns to Amédée de Ponthieu, a nineteenth-century folklore scholar,to explain the meaning of this fountain. This is odd, because, as Fulcanelliadmits, Amédée is no hermeticist. However, the good folklorist collected thevery ancient insights that Fulcanelli needed to convey. He tells us that thestatue was called the Son of Apollo, Phoebigenus, as well as the Master Peter,“meaning master stone, stone of power.” Amédée lists the various identitiesproposed for the statue, including “Esculapius, Mercury, or the god Terminus,”“Archambaud, Mayor of the Palace” in Merovingian times, Guillaume de Paris, themaster mason of Notre Dame, and even Christ and Saint Geneviève, the patronsaint of Paris.Amédée also informs us that the statue was removed when the square was enlargedin 1748. The interesting point is that Fulcanelli does not tell us his sourcefor the inscription on the fountain. Amédée seems not to have mentioned it,since none of his suggestions is a goddess. So, we are left with the smallmystery of how Fulcanelli knew of the inscription. From small mysteries such asthis, we shall find that the larger mystery of Fulcanelli himself can beunraveled. However, when that mystery is resolved, we shall find that“Fulcanelli” has left us with even larger questions, even greater mysteries, yetto be answered.From the statue and the fountain, Fulcanelli turns to another lost figure, thatof Saint Christopher, which stood with its back to the first pillar on the rightas one entered the nave until its destruction in 1781. He tells us of otherSaint Christophers removed around the same time, and suggests the ones thatremain do so only because they are either a fresco or a part of the wall. Heconcludes that behind such acts “there must obviously have been powerfulmotives.”Fulcanelli speculates that this reason could have been related to the statues’hermetic symbolism. He reveals the primitive name of Saint Christopher, Offerus,with its echoes of Orpheus the Gnostic Greek Christ, and then goes on to tell usthat this Christopher, “he who carries Christ” to the masses, is also“Chrysopher,” or “he who carries gold” to the hermeticist. And then Fulcanelliadds a few sentences in green-language code that go to the heart of the matter.“From this one can better understand the extreme importance of the symbol of St.Christopher. It is the hieroglyph of the solar sulphur (Jesus), of the nascentgold, raised on the mercurial waters and then carried, by the proper energy ofthis Mercury, to the degree of power possessed by the Elixir.”In these lines, we shall find by the end of our quest that Fulcanelli has notonly explained the secret of the alchemical transformation, but also pointed invery direct language at the true meaning and history of Christianity. The key,of course, is the meaning and origin of the Saint Christopher myth. Fulcanelliwill return to this topic later in the book, when we see that the SaintChristopher myth is actually part of a much larger, galactic-scale, in fact,cosmological myth. For now, though, Fulcanelli gives us one more spin on theSaint Christopher motif.He draws our attention to an ancient statue at Rocamadour in Brittany, a SaintChristopher high on the Saint-Michel heights guarding an old chest out of whichprotrudes a broken sword chained to the rock. He tells us that this is anexample of all the ancient sword-in-the-stone myths, validating our designsupposition while expanding the concept to include all sorts of rod-and-stonemotifs, from Moses to Atalanta the Amazon’s javelin. They are all “the samehieroglyph of this hidden matter of the Philosophers, whose nature is indicatedby St. Christopher and the result by the iron-bound chest.”Fulcanelli ends the chapter with an attack on the Renaissance, and Francis I inparticular, while looking back with longing on the splendor of the Middle Ages.“From the twelfth to the fifteenth century, there was poverty of media, but awealth of expression; from the sixteenth century onwards, art has shown beautyof form, but mediocrity of invention.” He instructs us that Renaissance artexalts the senses and the ego, while in Gothic art “the actual execution remainssubordinate to the idea; in Renaissance art, it dominates and obliterates theidea.”And to Fulcanelli, this split is the cause of all the artistic and politicalchaos that has since been the lot of mankind. In these paragraphs, however, weshall find that there is more than just a romantic theory of art. There is alsothe germ of a clue to the political upheavals that produced the Renaissance. Butthat is a subject for later. For now, let us agree with Fulcanelli that theworld is indeed impoverished by the loss of such wisdom and skill, suchunderstanding and execution, as was once lavished on the Gothic cathedrals.THE ALCHEMY OF LIGHT: FULCANELLI’S KABBALAHThe Etz Chaim, the Tree of Life from the Bahir and the Sefer Yetzirah, can beseen as the prototypical kabbalistic pattern, a sort of symbolic geometry (seefig. 9.10). In Le Mystère, Fulcanelli shows us this by his arrangement ofchapters and sections and the images within those sections. Fulcanelli gives usfour chapters in the first edition: “The Mystery of the Cathedrals,” “Paris,”“Amiens,” and “Bourges.” These represent the four worlds, or levels ofabstraction, and a Tree of Life, or a part of one, forms in each world.The first chapter, “The Mystery of the Cathedrals,” contains nine internalsections, as we saw above, each of which can be attributed to one of the sefirotfrom Kether to Yesod. This first tree is the kabbalistic Divine World, Atzilut,where the theory of creation is displayed. Interestingly enough, Fulcanelli’sthematic breaks in this section, while evolving the sefirot in the basiclightning-path order (see figures 9.4 and 9.5), divides naturally into asword-in-the-stone pattern. The first three sections form the hilt, the nextfive compose the stone, and the continuation of thought from section 1 straightthrough into section 9 creates the blade of the sword.image [images/image286-00.jpg]Figure 9.10. Three different versions of the Etz Chaim, the Tree of Life. A.from a fifteenth-century manuscript of the Zohar; B. from the Sefer Yetzirah,nineteenth century; C. from a fifteenth-century woodcut.The next chapter, “Paris,” creates an entire Tree of Life, with the addition ofan image from the first chapter, the Black Madonna, in the position of Binah.This arrangement, as we shall see, is a clue to the astronomical nature of thisarchetypal Tree of Life. On a projected or celestial Tree of Life, the earth’spole is tilted toward Binah—the Dark Mother of the Cosmic Sea in kabbalisticsymbology—hence its importance in Fulcanelli’s design. He continues the patternwith the Kether image Alchemy from the main porch at Notre Dame and the Chokmahimage of the alchemist from the south tower. These three images form the topthree sefirot, the Supernatural Triad, and then, quite appropriately, Fulcanellicreates a break to represent the abyss of Daat, or gnosis.He starts over at the bottom, at the foot of the Path of Return, the Serpent’sPath back up the Tree. Plates 4 through 25, discussed in the “Paris” chapter ofLe Mystère, represent the paths on the Tree, the letters of the Hebrew alphabet,and the trumps of the Tarot, and are attributed to the twenty-two individualletter paths that connect the sefirot listed above. Their pattern is theclassical Path of Return, pictured as a snake winding its way up the Tree (seefig. 9.11). For example, plate 4, called “The mysterious Fountain at the foot ofthe Old Oak,” is attributed to the letter tau and the Tarot image The World,linking the pilgrimage and persecution of the Kingdom, Malkuth, with thefoundational symbology of Notre-Dame-de-Paris and with heraldry, the Graillegends, and the philosophical dew in the sefirah of Yesod. Filling in the restof the Tree with these symbols reveals the ongoing alchemical process ofcreation.With plate 26, the sefirot pattern picks up with Daat, the gnosis of the abyss,and proceeds down the Tree to plate 32, an image of the Massacre of theInnocents from Saint-Chapelle, appropriate for Malkuth considering what happenedto the Gnostic current in the West. Fulcanelli has here provided us with a veryclear and direct image of the entire thirty-two components of the classical EtzChaim symbology (see fig. 9.12). In terms of worlds, this second level is thearchetypal Briah, or the World of Ideas. Fulcanelli demonstrates this byincluding an almost complete idea Tree at this level. Our inspiration, ofcourse, Binah or the Black Isis Madonna, comes across from the realm of theDivine.image [images/image288-00.jpg]Figure 9.11. The Serpent’s Path or Path of Return up the Tree of Life.The next level or world is Yetzirah, the World of Formation or the ethericworld. This is the level of the astral or spiritual world so beloved of shamansand mystics of all sorts. Fulcanelli shows great restraint by describing onlypart of the etheric Tree. He focuses on the seven planetary intelligences andtheir influence on alchemy. In these seven images, six shown and one mentionedonly in the text, Fulcanelli gives us clues to the operational nature of thework. The unshown image is the hidden sun, the mythical sun behind the sun, andthe formative images all seem to show how this hidden or Dark Sun affects theplanetary intelligences. Since these intelligences are also attributed to theseven metals, there does indeed seem to be a vast operational secret containedin these images.Once this multiple Tree of Life pattern is built up from the sections of thefirst chapter and the plates from Notre Dame and Amiens, with a few extraadditions from Sainte-Chapelle, Saint Victor, and elsewhere, an understanding ofthe basic process of astro-alchemy can be gleaned. This is the real secret, andfrom Fulcanelli’s point of view there is no mystery about it. But once thissecret is revealed, Fulcanelli goes on to propose a fourth Tree of Life thatneatly ties the historical, mythological, and cosmological elements into onecoherent framework.image [images/image289-00.jpg]Figure 9.12. The Tree of Life illustrated with plates from Fulcanelli’s “Paris”chapter in Le Mystère des cathédrales.This fourth Tree of Life pattern represents the world of action, our world ofstars and suns and planets. This Tree of Life grows out of Bourges in Berry.Fulcanelli ignores the town’s Gothic cathedral, with its stunning apocalypticstained glass, and concentrates on two contemporaries of Good King René in themid-fifteenth century, Jacques Coeur and Jean Lallemant, and their respectivehouses. This is a significant departure; up to this point Fulcanelli has focusedexclusively on cathedrals. This departure signals the shift from the theoreticaland mystical to the operational. Here we are firmly in the world of action. (Seeappendix D [34_chapter-title-21.html] for a complete outline of Fulcanelli’sfour Trees.)Fulcanelli is pointing us toward a moment in the late fifteenth century when theunderground stream at last broke the surface of history. He suggests that themystery of Bourges is the mystery of the esoteric current in the ancient past,the present of the fifteenth century, and the future down to and beyond thetwentieth century. The mystery of initiation encompasses a vast reach of time,Fulcanelli insists, but the strands of the tapestry emerged into a pattern atBourges in the mid-1400s.Fulcanelli directs our attention toward eight images in the two houses. Two arefrom Jacques Coeur’s house (plates 39 and 40) and six are from Lallemant (plates41–46). They can be analyzed as two images that establish both individuals asalchemists, the scallop shell and the vessel of the Great Work; three historicaland mythological themes, Tristan and Isolde, the Golden Fleece, and SaintChristopher; and three initiatory images from the inner sanctum of Lallemantmansion, the pillars, the ceiling, and the credence of the chapel.Even this simple pattern reveals groups of threes within threes. The first ofthe three groups of symbols shows us that Jacques Coeur was a pilgrim, a fellowtraveler, but Jean Lallemant was the operating agent with the vessel of theGreat Work. The role of grand master, however, is undefined. We are left withthe impression that a third personality exists, made conspicuous by his absence.Who was he?The next of the three groupings reinforces this impression. Here we are met withthree narrative images, symbolic stories balanced on that fine line betweenhistory and mythology. There is a core of reality to these tales, even when weare aware of their mythological elements. But, on the surface, there is nothingto connect the love story of Tristan and Isolde with the ancient Greek legend ofthe Golden Fleece, and both seemingly have nothing in common with the Christianlegend of Saint Christopher and the very heavy Christ child. And yet Fulcanellipresents the simple but overwhelming evidence from their own houses that thesemasters of the subtle art, the green language itself, placed the utmostimportance on these three myths. What do these three stories have in common?Of course, the third mystery grows out of the first two: Just what were theseinitiations designed to reveal?The answer to that is the ultimate secret, the secret of time itself. In thesecond edition of Le Mystère, Fulcanelli provides the solution by adding achapter on the Cyclic Cross of Hendaye. The three images that illustrate thatnew chapter, the plates numbered 47, 48, and 49, added to the eight of Bourges,plates 39 through 46, complete the sefirot of the fourth Tree of Life, includingDaat, Gnosis or Knowledge. This Tree, as appropriate to the world of action,reveals the cosmological underpinnings of the entire hermetic philosophy ofastro-alchemy. The final image in the group, plate 49, the Tympanum of SaintTrophime at Arles, completes the circle, both symbolically and on the ground,returning us once again to the ancient Grail city of the Argonauts.There is also a threefold pattern reflected in the design of the whole book. Thefirst secret, the Tree of Life itself, is formed from the sword-in-the-stonepattern of the nine sections in chapter 1 [11_chapter-title-3.html]. They form aframework for the sefirot, which is then amplified and deepened by the imagesfrom Notre Dame. To this is added the third level, the planetary seals fromAmiens cathedral. The next threefold pattern is the mystery of Bourges outlinedabove. The last grouping of three is the three interlocking cycles of theHendaye cross, their symbolic reflection on the cathedral at Arles, and finallythe three dragon axes in the sky that form the triple alignment of the galacticGreat Cross.This compounding of threes, 3 × 3 × 3, or 3 cubed, equals 27, presents us withthe key number in the precessional cycle, the core of the secret hidden behindthe Christianized INRI, whose letters in Hebrew add up to 270 (see chapter 11[25_chapter-title-13.html] for more on the significance of 270). From this briefexplication of the mystery at the heart of The Mystery of the Cathedrals, it ispossible to glimpse the genius and coherence of this very guarded and hermeticmasterpiece. The message is the medium, language contains its own gnosis, andinitiation truly is, as the Grail legends declare, the ability to ask thecorrect questions.As we unravel the triple weave of this hermetic tapestry, we shall discover theanswer to all of our questions, and in doing so experience a glimpse of a verydifferent reality. Fulcanelli, whoever he was, wrote as the last initiate: notas the one who puts the light out as he leaves, but as the one who makes surethat the eternal flame is burning brightly in some lost corner of Plato’s cave.What we have discovered in the course of this book of our own past, ourspiritual heritage, and the hope of human evolution is due to his guidance andinsight. Without the help of someone who knew, and could prove it, the mysterymight never have been unveiled.Let us turn now to the master for his summation of the secret that the designcontains. Fulcanelli, in the Bourges chapter of Le Mystère, called the credence,plate 46, a “temple in miniature.” Indeed, when we compare it to the facade ofthe cathedral of Saint Trophime in Arles, we can see that both pieces ofsymbolic architecture are built on the same plan. Since Fulcanelli also declaresthat “this credence itself bears the alchemical imprint, the details of which Ihave merely tried to describe in this work,” we have another opportunity to testour Tree of Life hypothesis.12 [36_endnote-title.html#iii12]When we superimpose the Tree of Life on the credence, as shown in figure 9.13,we find that it matches perfectly. The three fiery pomegranates of the pediment,which Fulcanelli informs us “confirm the triple action of a single procedure,”are the three upper sefirot, Kether, Chokmah, and Binah. The capitals of thepillars are Chesed and Gevurah and the feet are Hod and Netzach. The centerniche is Tiferet, here displaced upward and focused on therising-sun/scallop-shell motif above the inscription. The bottom step representsthe foundation of Yesod and the greenery below it symbolizes Malkuth. The threepillars of the Tree are clearly delineated. The middle pillar is curiouslyfocused on the rising sun of Tiferet, with another larger, inner sun—“fire abovethe abyss,” as the I Ching puts it—rising above the ledge attributed to Daat.The ornamentation in this space suggests the geometry found on another Daatimage given by Fulcanelli, that of the Planetary Metals fromNotre-Dame-de-Paris, which is plate 26 (see fig. 8.5[21_chapter-title-10.html#fig_8-5]).image [images/image292-00.jpg]Figure 9.13. The enigmatic credence from Lallemant mansion the with the Tree ofLife superimposed.The facade of the cathedral of Saint Trophime in Arles also matches the pattern(fig. 9.14). Built in the mid-twelfth century as Notre-Dame-de-Paris rose fromthe ruins of the Carolingian cathedral, Saint Trophime’s Tree of Life is richand complex with interwoven metaphors peculiar to Provence and its earlyChristians. Saint Trophime actually has two Trees collapsed into one, showingthe “portal” grade in which the initiate passes into the Grail Castle. Thefacade itself contains a Tree, with Daat at the upper arch, inside a largerTree, which displaces Daat upward and onto a columned window. Clearly, the“portal” is the passage through Daat, the true door of Christ as Abbot Sugerdescribed it. The facade of Saint Trophime is indeed a hermetic trophy of greatprice.image [images/image293-00.jpg]Figure 9.14. The front of Saint Trophime in Arles with Tree of Lifesuperimposed.Most Gothic facades are based on this simple, collapsed Tree of Life principle.The two towers of Saint-Denis or Notre-Dame-de-Paris represent the two pillarsof the Tree, with the middle pillar beyond Tiferet displaced backward toward thecentral spire (fig. 9.15). This suggests that when walking into the cathedral,one is navigating the “portal” between the worlds.We can see this clearly if we think of stretching out the facade over the floorso that the western rose window, the Tiferet sefirah, is above the labyrinth onthe nave in the center of the cathedral. In addition, the basic shape of thecathedral, as Fulcanelli reminds us, is that of an ankh, the Egyptian symbol oflife. As some of Fulcanelli’s readers were aware, the ankh is the only form ofcross that contains all the sefirot on the Tree of Life without rearrangingtheir pattern.image [images/image294-00.jpg]Figure 9.15. The Tree of Life superimposed on the facade of Notre-Dame-de-Paris.In this symbolic approach, the cathedral is a way to walk through the portal—theTrue Light of the Christ’s door—and between the worlds. The vertical facadeorients the wise to the transition, while the horizontal pattern inside evokes aresponse whether one is aware of the technique or not. From above, Notre Damelooks like nothing so much as an ankh with a roselike spire blossoming from thecentral Tiferet junction. This spire, of course, seen from the front is themiddle pillar from Tiferet to Kether. These are not accidental metaphors; theyshow a basic symbolical harmony designed by someone who knew the geometry of theTree of Life.Fulcanelli informs us that “this credence itself bears the alchemical imprint,the details of which I have merely tried to describe in this work,” and we havefound that not only does the credence bear this alchemical imprint of thekabbalistic Tree, but so does the design of the cathedrals themselves. Once theconcept is grasped, however, it makes one wonder why anyone of the intelligenceof Canseliet and friends would try to deny the kabbalistic connections.In the original edition of Le Mystère, Fulcanelli closed his study of hermeticsymbolism “by analyzing a curious and strangely rare specimen,” our “temple inminiature,” the enigmatic credence. From this we may assume that he intended hisremarks to be a summary of the entire work. As usual, however, his approach issomewhat oblique.After drawing our attention to the Golden Fleece bas-relief, which, he tells us,“could have served as a guide,” he jumps to the scallop shells on each pillar ofthe credence. These he identifies as symbolic of the Philosophic Mercury, whileconnecting them with the wings and trident of Neptune. He calls our attention tothe two dolphins and the three fiery pomegranates. With that, he leaves offdescribing the other details of the credence and moves on to interpreting theinscription. In that interpretation can be found the essential clues to thenature of astro-alchemy and its secret.Working backward from Fulcanelli’s comment on chiliasm in the Hendaye chapter,we have unraveled a new perspective on alchemy and its relationship witheschatologies such as chiliasm. Can we now confirm our speculations fromFulcanelli’s guarded and symbolic words?Indeed we can. At the very beginning of his discussion of Lallemant’s credence,Fulcanelli insists on the same triple transformation that we found at the heartof the alchemical process. “Thanks to this simple arrangement [the RERE patternfrom the Lallemant credence], I can already find a clue in the three repetitionsof one and the same technique,” Fulcanelli instructs us. “Furthermore, the threefiery pomegranates of the pediment confirm this triple action of a singleprocedure,” he continues, “in order to achieve the three philosophical works,according to the doctrine of Geber.”The reference to Geber, or ibn Jabir, introduces the idea of the threealchemical principles, Salt, Sulfur, and Mercury. Fulcanelli expands thisconcept to cover the triple transformation of the entire ancient Gnosticscience. “The first operation,” he tells us, “leads primarily to the Sulphur, amedicine of the first order.” We can see this as the inner yogic alchemicalprocess. “The second operation,” Fulcanelli states, “completely similar to thefirst, provides the Elixir, or medicine of the second order, which differs fromSulphur only in quality, not in nature.”13 [36_endnote-title.html#iii13]This second or outer transformation follows the same pattern as the innertransformation, and is not different in nature. The transmutation of metals isthe demonstration of the inner transformation. The quality of the transformationis projected outward onto matter by the nature—“Only Nature can overcomenature,” Isis the Prophetess reminds us—of the transformative process itself.“Finally, the third operation, carried out like the two former ones, producesthe Philosophic Stone, the medicine of the third order, which contains all thevirtues and perfections of the Sulphur and the Elixir, multiplied in power andextent,” Fulcanelli instructs us. The third transformation is the transformationof time itself, and it is, as Fulcanelli points out, carried out like theothers. Calling this transformation the Philosophic Stone takes us directly backto the Bahir, where the universe is described as the “Precious Stone in the Seaof Wisdom.” The transformation of time contains “the virtues and perfections” ofthe other two transformations, as Fulcanelli insists, and it is definitelygreater in power and extent.14 [36_endnote-title.html#iii14]Fulcanelli closes the discussion by pointing to another symbol on the ceiling ofthe strange little room. “If anyone asks, in addition, what this tripleoperation consists of, whose results I have shown, and how it is carried out, Iwould refer the investigator to the bas-relief on the ceiling, which shows apomegranate being roasted in a certain vase.” “Pomegranate” describes theinternal alchemy, “roasted” is the action of projecting the transformation, and“vase,” as we shall see, is a metaphor for all three transformations at once.This vase is, in fact, nothing less than the Holy Grail itself.15[36_endnote-title.html#iii15]Next, Fulcanelli turns to the clues we used above to unravel the mystery of theinscription. As we saw, his rebus of RERE matches the idea of Light shining inand then light, internally derived, shining out again. He describes this as “adouble occult property, exactly equilibrated, from nature (the Light) and fromart (the light).” Fulcanelli tells us that he would like to be as clear “aboutthe explanation of the second term RER, but I am not allowed to tear down theveil of mystery concealing it.” Fulcanelli tells us that RER contains “a vitallyimportant secret, referring to the vase of the work.” He insists that thecreation of this Philosopher’s Vase is the only way to gain “the slightestsuccess in the Work.”16 [36_endnote-title.html#iii16] Fulcanelli is hereconstrained by his vow to the secret society from which he learned theseimportant truths. And so we come face-to-face with the proof of the existence ofthose who know. He strains the boundaries of his oath by making his warnings:“Do not, therefore, undertake anything until you have received the light on thiseggshell, which the masters of the Middle Ages called the secretum secretorum(secret of secrets).”“What then is this RER?” Fulcanelli asks rhetorically. He then gives us a lessonin chemical symbology. In arsenic sulfide, he asks, which is the sulfur andwhich is the arsenic? This alchemical koan provokes in us the realizationrequired to light the inner lamp, the fusion of inner and outer symbolized bythe transformation of time.Fulcanelli gives us more advice. Seek the vessel or vase first, and then theflow of Light will be easily recognized. Pushing the boundary of his oath,Fulcanelli goes on to tell us that according to the Sybil, a philosopher, analchemist, is “a man who knows how to make glass.”17[36_endnote-title.html#iii17]“Therefore make your vase, then your compound; seal it with care, in such a waythat no spirit can escape; heat the whole according to the art until it iscalcinated. Return the pure part of the powder obtained to your compound, whichyou will seal up in the same vase. Repeat for the third time and do not give meany thanks.” Fulcanelli insists that he is “but a beacon on the great highway ofthe esoteric Tradition.”With this outburst of what seems to be clarity, Fulcanelli ends his originaltour of hermetic symbolism. He expresses his gratitude to the virtually unknownauthor of these works, Jean Lallemant, who, “following the example of the greatAdepts of the Middle Ages, . . . preferred to entrust to stone, rather than tovellum, the undeniable evidence of an immense science, of which he possessed allthe secrets.” Fulcanelli places Lallemant in the first rank of alchemists, alongwith Geber, Roger Bacon, and Basil Valentine, and above them in his modesty andsincerity. He also tells us that Lallemant was a Knight of the Round Table, acurious title for an alchemist, until we considered the importance of the GrailStone.18 [36_endnote-title.html#iii18]We began our research on the basis of a remark in the Hendaye chapter, whichchapter was not included in the first edition. Without the clue of theconnection between alchemy and chiliasm, Fulcanelli’s original big finale isimpossibly obscure. In the end, we are left hanging, having heard the voice ofan initiate whose words remain occult.We can only guess that Fulcanelli fulfilled his oath to the secret society thattaught him. Between the 1920s and the 1950s something happened, and someone wasinstructed to reveal the secret. The decision being made, Canseliet wasapparently dispatched with the final clue, the Cyclic Cross of Hendaye.So, how does a Tree become a Stone and then a Star?Simple. The eternal polar axis of our celestial sphere, whose equator is thesun’s apparent motion against the stars, or the zodiac, forms the middle pillarof a cosmic Tree of Life. This Tree is also found within our bodies, and when wealign these Trees and project them outward on the celestial sphere, we create ajeweled sphere, the Precious Stone of the Wise, in which forms the Cube ofSpace. The Tree has become a Stone.The next step, from Stone to Star, requires the transformation of light. Alignedproperly, the Precious Stone can tell us the quality of time and the physics ofcreation. Internalized, this projected alignment leads to bursts of light,flashes of kundalini. If the process is supported by dark retreat and suddenlight immersion, then it is possible that the entire body could be transformed.Something similar seems to have happened in the case of Padmasambhava, theTantric master who brought Buddhism to Tibet in the eighth century.The Tree of Life unites our universe across vast scales of existence. When weidentify with that immensity, we expand as we try to encompass it all. The flashof gnosis is the result, and from that, if we are lucky, comes the science ofalchemy. Fulcanelli has given us excellent guidance on the alchemical andinitiatory process. He shows us how the initiation worked in the past, andpoints, as we shall see in chapter 11 [25_chapter-title-13.html], toward themass initiation that may be unavoidable in our future. When Isis, the GreatCosmic Womb of the Galaxy, gives birth to the new Horus Light of transformation,let us hope that we have all solved the riddle of becoming a star.Omnia quia sunt, lumina sunt. “All that is, is Light.”"},{"pageContent":"image [images/image301-00.jpg]For it is by fire and in fire that our hemisphere will soon be tried.

G. Wells, Aldous Huxley, and the smartyoung London set discovered nearby Saint-Jean-de-Luz in 1920, and by 1926 or sothe tourist villas had spread as far south as Hendaye. Today, Hendaye-Plage,Hendaye’s beachfront addition, bustles with boutiques, dive shops, and surfboardemporiums, having become a popular stopover for the young, international,backpacking-nomad crowd.Although Fulcanelli declares, somewhat disingenuously, that “Hendaye has nothingto hold the interest of the tourist, the archaeologist or the artist,” theregion does have a rather curious history. A young Louis XIV met his bride on anisland in the bay below Hendaye, along the boundary between Spain and France.Wellington passed through, making nearby Saint-Jean-de-Luz his base of operationagainst Toulouse at the close of the Napoleonic Wars. Hitler also paid a visit,during World War II; in 1940 he parked his train car within walking distance ofthe cross at Hendaye.The region has other, more esoteric connections as well. Hendaye is in Basquecountry, and the Basque people’s genetic makeup has proved to be unlike anyother in Europe. The Basque language is also a mystery. It is one of only fivenon-Indo-European languages to survive, and it has no links to any otherlanguage in Europe. These facts have suggested to some researchers that theBasques are the remnants of a global pre-catastrophe civilization, the lost“Atlanteans” to the more imaginative. The Basques were also well known for theirmagical practices, and were the focus, in the late sixteenth and earlyseventeenth centuries, of a major Inquisitional witch hunt.2[36_endnote-title.html#jjj2]When Fulcanelli visited in the 1920s, Hendaye was a very small town. He notedits “little houses huddled at the foot of the first spurs of the Pyrenees,” andcommented on the “rough and rugged landscape” in which “the natural austerity ofthe wild scene is scarcely relieved by the headland of Fuenterrabia, showingochre in the crude light, thrusting into the dark greyish-green mirror-calmwaters of the gulf.”3 [36_endnote-title.html#jjj3]Keep in mind that, although “The Cyclic Cross at Hendaye,” the penultimatechapter of Mystery of the Cathedrals, was apparently written in the mid-1920s,it was added to the book only when it was republished in 1957. Hardly anyone inthe occult world noticed this addition or commented on it, perhaps because itdoesn’t fit neatly into any of the preconceived notions of alchemy. Theimportance of Hendaye is revealed by Fulcanelli’s declaration: “Whatever itsage, the Hendaye cross shows by the decoration of its pedestal that it is thestrangest monument of primitive millenarism [sic], the rarest symbolicaltranslation of chiliasm, which I have ever met.”4 [36_endnote-title.html#jjj4]Because Fulcanelli openly connected alchemy and the apocalypse, the true natureof that very specific gnostic astro-alchemical meme whose fingerprints we havetraced through several millennia emerged into public consciousness. This meantthat the secret was no longer contained among the elect societies. For the firsttime since the age of the Gothic cathedrals, the meme had broken out of itsincubational structures.In a way, the cross and its message serve as proof that there are such things assecret societies. Found throughout history, these societies preserve and presentthe secret of the cross in various ways. The Kabbalah in Judaism, Sufic Islam,esoteric Christianity, Gnosticism, and the hermetic tradition have been thekeepers of these ideas. The central message of the three main Western religions,that of an eschatological moment in time, is the secret that also lies at theheart of the cross at Hendaye. The meme, the ability to understand the myth andits metaphors, seems to have survived only through the actions of these secretand insular groups.The cross at Hendaye stands today at the southwest corner of Saint Vincent’sChurch, on the busiest street corner in town. No one notices theordinary-looking monument with its message of catastrophe; perhaps it wasintended to be that way. The secret hides in plain sight.PRECESSIONAL MYTHMAKING AND AN ENIGMATIC ALTAR TO THE GOD OF TIMEIn 1901, a career civil servant in the British East India Company and formercommissioner of the province of Bengal published what he thought would be arevolutionary work on ancient history and prehistoric star religions. Historyand Chronology of the Myth-Making Age, by James F. Hewitt, “late Commissioner ofChutia Nagpur,” as the title page styles it, is one of those grand summations ofuniversal knowledge so beloved by the late Victorians. Hewitt, however, is notyour usual colonial civil servant, and his work, unlike his contemporary JamesChurchward’s books on the lost continent of Mu, is actually based on solidlinguistic ground, at least for the turn of the twentieth century. His work,with all its flaws, is a connection point for many pieces of the Hendaye puzzle,and it offers us another mysterious stone, one that just might be the originalof the Hendaye cross.Hewitt’s expertise in Sanskrit is both the strength and the weakness of hisargument. Sanskrit becomes the lens through which Hewitt views every otherculture and mythic structure on the planet, and this produces some surprisingdistortions. Occasionally these funhouse-mirror images are accurate, if somewhatinexplicable. Hewitt is correct on things where he should be dead wrong andtotally inaccurate only when he tries to convince us of the universality of hisconclusions. But through the verdant and tangled overgrowth of Sanskrit rootsand cultural imperialism, the outlines of something truly astonishing can bediscerned. History and Chronology of the Myth-Making Age is not only an attemptat uncovering the origins of the symbolic green language, spoken, as Fulcanellireminds us, by all initiates, but it is also a masterful attempt to link thatsymbolic argot to its source in the astronomy of precession. That Hewitt failsis not surprising; we are impressed, however, by the fact that he made such avalid attempt.With the first sentence of his preface, Hewitt informs us: “The Myth-making Age,the history of which I have sketched in this book, comprises the whole periodfrom the first dawn of civilization . . . down to the time when the sun enteredTaurus at the Vernal Equinox between 4000 and 5000 B.C.” He laments the lack ofa precise date for this event, and then offers an average, 4500 B.C.E., which isclose enough to be quite accurate. He tells us that this was the closing eventin the mythmaking age, and that after this point, “it ceased to be a universallyobserved national custom to record history in the form of historical myths, and. . . national history began to pass out of the mythic stage into that of theannalistic chronicles recording the events of the reigns of kings and the deedsof individual heroes, statesmen and law-givers.”Making allowances for Hewitt’s anachronistic use of the word nation, we candiscern something quite profound here. Around 6,000 years ago something did infact shift. This is recorded in the Egyptian king lists and in Manetho’schronology as the point where the Heru Shemsu, the blacksmiths of Edfu, ruled astransitional figures between the reigns of the living gods and the reigns ofkings and pharaohs. It also marked the beginning of the spread of agriculturalsocieties. Hewitt is also correct, for the wrong reasons as usual, that theIndo-European languages spread with the diffusion of agriculture across Europe.Modern linguistic archaeology places the origins of Indo-European languages andorganized farming in Anatolia, homeland of Cybele, Mother of the Gods.5[36_endnote-title.html#jjj5]Identifying the spread of Indo-European with agriculture helps to explain hownon-Indo-European languages, Finno-Ugaric, Hungarian, Estonian, Causasian, andBasque, survived in isolated pockets. These were places where, for whateverreasons, the old hunter-gatherer traditions survived. The Finno-Ugaric speakersstill have a large nomadic population, the Laplanders, and the Hungarians wereisolated by geography. The other three, Caucasian, Estonian, and Basque, wereall fishing or trading communities. Of them all, only Basque has survived intothe twenty-first century as a living language, and Basque culture has alwaysbeen based on the sea.Hewitt has a curious view of the Basques as a mixture of his southernnon-Indo-European agriculturalists and the northern Gotho-Celts, the EuropeanAryan nomads and cattle-driving warrior-kings. From our modern archaeologicalperspective, we can see how skewed Hewitt’s premises are: The Neolithic Basqueswere not agriculturalists, for instance, and not even four hundred years of PaxRomanitas made much of a dent on their language or culture. And yet, Hewitt’sprecessional mythology has many points of great interest to our research. How hecame by this mythology is a subject to which we shall return a bit later, butfirst let’s take a look at the broad outline of this mythic pattern.According to Hewitt, the first myth to develop among the agricultural societieswas that of the Measurer of Time, analogous in Egyptian terms to Tehuti, whodivided the solar year into two sections of thirtysix weeks of five days each tomatch the monsoon patterns in the Indus Valley, Hewitt’s original home ofcivilization.6 [36_endnote-title.html#jjj6] (Note that these are precessionalnumbers as well numbers related to the pentagram.) Hewitt also identifies his“Bird of Life” with the Egyptian khu, which he interprets to be a raven. This heidentifies as the dark bird of the winds that divides the year by bringing themonsoons.In this first age, the focus of cosmogony, according to Hewitt, was the PoleStar and the Tree of Life that grew from it. Here he cites the Celtic mythsrelated to the Grail, where “the world’s mother-tree was born from the seedbrought by the rain-cloud-bird, the offspring of the Cauldron of Life, thecreating-waters stored by the Pole Star god as the Holy Grail or Blood of God,and guarded by his raven vice-regent, the god whose name is Bran, in thewatch-tower called the Caer Sidi or Turning Tower of the heavens.”7[36_endnote-title.html#jjj7]Hewitt’s next age presents a different cosmogony. Here the world is seen as anegg, laid by the Bird of Life in the Tree, and around which the serpent coils.Hewitt sees this as a new kind of Pole Star/World Tree alignment, and identifiesthe serpent as the ecliptic zodiac, thus making this alignment that of the northand south poles of the ecliptic. His origins for these concepts are entertainingas usual, including a race of Finnish ogres who worshipped the storm bird andthe snake god, but the concept itself is, as we have seen, a crucial part of theancient astronomy.His third myth-making age is strictly solar, evolving into the sun god asprimeval ass or horse god. The process by which this occurs is too long tosummarize, but Hewitt arrives at a series of images and metaphors that deservequoting here:This last god, whose genealogy shows him to be the son or successor of the asssun-god . . . was born, as I have shown, under the star Spica a Virgo the motherof corn. . . . The birth took place when the sun was in Virgo at the Vernalequinox, that is, between 13,000 and 12,000 B.C. . . . This primeval ass . . .who is said . . . to traverse the holy road of the divine order, the path of thegod of annual time, was the god of the boring (tri) people, the beeinspiredrace. . . . They . . . were deft artificers, the first workers in metals, whointroduced bronze and made the lunar sickle of Kronos . . . and the creatingtrident of Poseidon. This latter god was nurtured by them with a nymph, thedaughter of the ocean Kapheria, the semitic Kabirah, the Arabic Kabar, themother goddess of the Kabiri and another form of Harmonia, mother of the sons ofthe smiths of heaven. She was also the black Demeter of Phigalia, the goddesswith the horse’s head who was violated by Poseidon. . . . We can thus by theirgenealogy trace their traditional history from between 14,000 and 15,000 B.C. tobetween 13,000 and 12,000 B.C. These priests were the Kuretes whose religiousdances were circular gyrations like those of the heavenly bodies-8round thepole.8 [36_endnote-title.html#jjj8]While Hewitt’s methods are decidedly odd, quoting a medieval Grail romance as amotif from around 18,000 B.C.E. might strike some scholars as downright bizarre,and his “facts” are, by anyone’s reckoning, inaccurate. We have no evidence formetalworking in Europe 15,000 years ago, for instance. But his symbolic mix ofmetaphors and mythology strikes us as meaningful, particularly in light of theresearch we presented in chapter 7 [19_chapter-title-9.html]. As we ponder thesesymbolic echoes and synchronistic themes, the conclusion dawns on us that Hewittis trying to make the evidence, wherever he can find it, match the underlyingesoteric understanding that he brings to this work. This underlying theme isabsent in his earlier, and slightly more sound, Ruling Races of PrehistoricTimes, published in 1894 and 1895. Between 1894 and 1900, Hewitt ran into acurrent of the underground stream of hermetic esotericism, one in which thesecret of time, the eschatological secret at the core of alchemy, was sketchedout in a specific way that was a blend of Indian sources and Western traditions.Before we go looking for Hewitt’s esoteric sources, we must look at one ofHewitt’s few pieces of physical evidence, and from the perspective of ourresearch the most important part of Hewitt’s book. During his examination of theSecond Age migrations of what he calls the “Turanic-Semitic seafaring races,”which, according to Hewitt, were the builders of the megalithic structures fromMalta to Scandinavia, he turns to a carved stone found, he supposes, near themegalithic ruins of Carnac, in Brittany.Carnac, in Hewitt’s Sanskrit lens, is an example of the “Hindu ritual of theSoma sacrifice,” and therefore the rows of stones “mark in other particularstheir descent from Indian year reckoning.” To back up this highly unusual, evenfor the time, contention, Hewitt points to “the Linga stone altar in thecollection of M. du Chatellier at Kernuz, near Pont-l’Abbé, Finistere.” Hedeclares that it follows the rules of form laid down by “the Hindu religiousbooks,” and, as he examined it, he “saw at once” that whoever carved it “musthave learnt the theology expressed in the engravings in India.”9[36_endnote-title.html#jjj9] (See fig. 10.1B.)Hewitt’s description is important enough to quote at length.On the top there was drawn the St. Andrew’s cross (X) of the solsticial sun, thesign of the flying year-bird beginning its flight at the winter solstice. On oneside was a pattern of interlaced female Su-astikas representing the annualcourse of the sun, beginning its journey round the heavens by going northward atthe winter solstice. On the side next to this was the square of the eight-rayedstar representing the union of the St. Andrew’s Cross of the solsticial sun withthe St. George’s Cross of the Equinoctial sun (+).Hewitt then describes how, according to the ancient Vedic sages, this wheel oflife was drawn as the dimensions of a cube marking the “history of the sunyear,” and that “of the Su or Khu year-bird which explains the meaning andhistorical importance of the name Su-astika, denoting the yearly course roundthe eight (ashta) points of the heavens of the sun-bird.”He continues with the third side, on which was “a pattern of four leaves . . .arranged in the form of a St. Andrew’s Cross.” On the fourth and last side, heinforms us, is a St. George’s Cross in the form of “a Palasha Tree.” Around thetop of all four symbols, Hewitt describes “a scroll of female Su-astikas and atthe bottom one of the snakes coiled in the form of the cross bar of the maleSu-astika.” Then Hewitt tells us that the sculpted stone was found by M. duChatellier “at the end of an avenue marked by two rows of uncut stones.”Hewitt moves on quickly to his point. “It was doubtless to this god of time thatthe earliest stone-altar or sun-gnomon-stone was erected, and similarly theoriginal tree Yupa, the tree-trunk, denoted the god who measured time by thechanges . . . of the three seasons. . . . The designs engraved on thisstone-altar . . . say as clearly as written words could do, ‘This is an altar tothe God of Time who sent the sun-bird of the winter solstice to fly its annualcourse from South to North and North to South ’round the Pole, and to supply thelight and the heat which nourishes the mother-tree of life.’ ”image [images/image309-00.jpg]Figure 10.1. Designs from A, Basque gravestones, and B, from Hewitt’s mysterious“linga stone.”VISHNUNABHI, THE MOTHER, AND THE HERMETIC BROTHERHOOD OF LUXORIt is hard to know what to make of Hewitt. From our modern perspective his ideason languages and migrations strike us as quaint relics of an age when the heightof sophistication was a British passport and Britannia ruled the waves of aglobal empire. In such an age, the pronouncements of an educated Englishmancarried a certain weight, and even those he classed as inferior accepted hisdefinitions of culture. It would be more than a generation before Indianscholars would take charge of the study of their own history and languages, andanother generation before archaeology caught up to philology and began to supplythe missing gaps in the theories of language diffusion and displacement. Withthat in mind, we can give Hewitt credit for the effort and appreciate hisdifficulties, while still trying to understand how he arrived at hisconclusions.It is tempting to see Hewitt’s four ages as the same as the Hindu yugas,although Hewitt never makes the comparison. He clearly sees them asprecessionally based, and tries to place them within the accepted framework ofthe astronomical understanding of his era. He cites Sir Norman Lockyer’s24,400-year length for precession and tries to make his data fit the pattern,even though numerically Hewitt keeps turning up an older pattern based on 72times 360, for a Great Year of 25,920 years. It is this uncertainty on such akey point that allows us to track Hewitt’s esoteric source.In addition to the precessional plan of his four 6,000-year ages, Hewitt hassupplied us with a mythic symbolism that encompasses all three of the greatalignments—galactic, ecliptic, and celestial—that we examined in chapter 4[15_chapter-title-6.html]. Thus, his mythological symbolism combines in a seriesof overlapping images the ancient secrets of illuminated astronomy, andtherefore, as Hewitt implies, the secret of time itself. Hewitt applies thisunderstanding to the past, but, if his timing of the age of Taurus isaccurate—and it is within acceptable limits—then we are now at the turn ofanother age, and the beginning of a new round of four ages.That Hewitt does not directly connect his scheme of ages with the four yugas issomewhat surprising. He is aware of Manu, whom he calls the lawgiver to theMinyan race, and cites his 24,000-year period for the yugas, even comparing thisto Lockyer’s modern estimate, but he stops short of direct comparison. Thereason for this omission is obscure, until we look directly at the numbers Manugives in his Laws. Adding Hewitt’s pattern of ages, we find that they cover onlyhalf, or 12,000 years, of the cycle Manu has proposed. Hewitt avoids thecontradiction as unimportant to his major thesis, but if we stop to examine it,we find that it points to what is perhaps the deepest secret of all in theancient illuminated astronomy, the location and significance of the galacticcenter.A contemporary of Hewitt’s, Swami Sri Yukteswar, was at the forefront of thelate-Victorian movement in India to reclaim and update its ancient spiritualheritage. At that time, there were still forest sages, such as Yukteswar’s guruMahavatar Babaji, who practiced the ancient Vedic sciences, and in the face ofthe imperial raj’s inroads on Indian culture a reaction developed in which theancient wisdom would be vindicated and revived by means of the Western sciencesof history, philology, and astronomy. Sri Yukteswar stood at the forefront ofthis movement, which would eventually see such strange mixtures as MahatmaGandhi and Annie Besant, and his influence, through his student ParamahansaYogananda, founder of the Self-Realization Fellowship and author of the classicAutobiography of a Yogi, has been profound and far-reaching.Sri Yukteswar, in his book The Holy Science, attempts to address the problemwith Manu’s dates. His basic idea is that while a complete cycle is 24,000years, it has two expressions, each 12,000 years long; and following Manu’spattern, both converge on the point where, according to Yukteswar, the sun is atits closest point to “this grand center, the seat of Brahma,” and again 12,000years later at the point where the sun is farthest away from the “seat ofBrahma.” This grand center is called “Vishnunabhi, which is the seat of thecreative power, Brahma, the universal magnetism.”10[36_endnote-title.html#jjj10]Modern Vedic scholars, such as David Frawley, clearly identify Vishnunabhi withthe center of the galaxy. In Astrology of the Seers, he comments: “The galacticcenter is called ‘Brahma,’ the creative force, or ‘Vishnunabhi,’ the navel ofVishnu. From this galactic sun emanates the light which determines the life andintelligence on Earth.”11 [36_endnote-title.html#jjj11] John Major Jenkins, inhis book Galactic Alignment, goes even further: “Without mincing words, it isclear that the ancient Vedic skywatchers were aware of the galactic center, and,indeed considered it to be the center and source of creative power in theuniverse.”12 [36_endnote-title.html#jjj12]Jenkins also remarks: “[T]he critical information encoded in Yukteswar’sbook—written decades before the Galactic Center was officially discovered in the1920s—is that the ancient Vedic yuga doctrine was calibrated with the periodicalignments of the solstice sun and the galactic center.”13[36_endnote-title.html#jjj13] Frawley agrees, and asserts that all of Vedicastrology “orients the zodiac to the galactic center.” The lunar mansions ofVedic astrology also point to the region of the galactic center, six degreesSagittarius. The thirteen-degree lunar sign that includes the galactic center iscalled mulla, or root, indicating the importance of the center of the galaxy asthe source and origin of life and time.14 [36_endnote-title.html#jjj14]Hewitt is referring to this tradition, although obliquely, with his comments:“This is an altar to the God of Time who sent the sun-bird of the wintersolstice to fly its annual course from South to North and North to South ’roundthe Pole, and to supply the light and the heat which nourishes the mother-treeof life. . . .”15 [36_endnote-title.html#jjj15] The arc of movement toward andaway from the galactic center is indicated by the “sun-bird of the wintersolstice” who flies from “South to North,” or from the point closest to thegalactic center to the point farthest away. The pole it is “circling” is thegalactic axis, from Vishnunabhi to the edge of the galaxy, and as the Vedicsages suggest, it does bring the Light that nourishes the “mother-tree” of theecliptic axis. By Hewitt’s reckoning, the stone “linga” he describes is aphysical summation of his precessional mythology, an object that identifies themystery of time and evolution as the symbolic union or alignment of all threecenters and cosmic dragon axes.Did Hewitt learn his precessional mythology from such Vedic reconstructionistsas Sri Yukteswar or did he intuit it from the original sources? Both of theseseem somewhat unlikely. Sri Yukteswar’s work, The Holy Science, was notavailable in the West until 1949, and the date of its composition is uncertain.Hewitt may have heard of such teachings, but if he did, he does not mention themas sources. Also, even though his grasp of Sanskrit is quite sound, Hewitt oftenoverlooks important sources and implications. We have seen this in his treatmentof Manu, and there are many other examples. We can safely assume, then, thatsince Hewitt draws on so many non-Vedic sources to support his theme, he did notfind his mythology completely within his Indian sources.So where did it come from? The answer to that question can be found in the work,sixty years after Hewitt’s book, of a disciple of another Hindu saint intent onreconstructing ancient Vedic wisdom with a Western spin. Sri Aurobindo spent hisearly life in England, graduating from Cambridge in 1892 and returning to Indiathe next year as a civil servant. He quickly educated himself in Sanskrit andother modern Indian languages and by 1902 was deeply involved in politicalactivity. In 1910, under legal and political pressure for his outspoken supportof swaraj, or Indian independence, Aurobindo went into a spiritual retirementand departed Bengal for Pondicherry in French India.A group developed around Aurobindo, including a young married Frenchwoman by thename of Mirra Alfassa, who rapidly became Sri Aurobindo’s spiritual mate. Shewas simply called the Mother, and was seen by the community as an incarnation ofthe divine presence.In 1968, eighteen years after Sri Aurobindo’s death and only five years beforeher own death, the Mother began a major series of building projects atAuroville, as the expanding commune at Pondicherry was called. One of these wassomething called the Matrimandir.The Mother worked closely with another young Frenchwoman, PatriziaNorelli-Bachelet, on the design and symbolism of the Matrimandir, a shrineintended to symbolize the godhead on earth. As John Major Jenkins points out inGalactic Alignment, the Matrimandir, like Hewitt’s linga altar stone, is acombination of all three cosmic centers and axial directions in a singlesymbolic object. Although the completed structure didn’t follow the Mother’sprecise geometrical specifications, and therefore failed in its initiatoryintent, the descriptions and conclusions Norelli-Bachelet preserves for us inher works The Gnostic Circle and The New Way clearly point to the importance ofthe center of galaxy, and its periodic precessional alignments, for ourspiritual evolution.“We can go so far,” Norelli-Bachelet instructs us, “as to know that there is agreat Centre to which we in our system are related and which holds the key tothe Precession of the Equinoxes. It is this Centre that makes the axis Capricornand Cancer the Evolutionary Axis of our planet. And through our study we canknow that in ourselves, in our very bodies, we can find the exact reproductionof this galaxy which then gives us the revelation of the Supreme Herself.” Her“Evolutionary Axis,” given as the tropicalc [36_footnote-title.html#cfn] signsof Capricorn and Cancer—Sagittarius and Gemini in sidereal terms—is, of course,the galaxy axis from center to edge. Jenkins suggests that Norelli-Bacheletderived this axis from the works of René Guénon, but the chances are thatNorelli-Bachelet learned it directly from the Mother, who in fact seems to havelearned from the same source as Guénon.16 [36_endnote-title.html#jjj16] And,even more curiously, the Mother and Guénon’s sources lead us back, indirectly,to Hewitt.Mirra Alfassa, the Mother, is in her own right one of the most fascinatingfigures in twentieth-century occultism. Long before she moved to India and metSri Aurobindo, Mirra was seeking sources of esoteric wisdom. In 1906, five yearsafter Hewitt published his masterwork, Mirra found her first master, Max Théon,founder of the hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor. Théon, to whom we shall returnlater, was by all accounts an amazing individual, and the only spiritualexemplar of the era that earned René Guénon’s admiration. The Mother, who wasalso not lavish in her praise, calls him a man of enormous occult power,knowledge, and perception. But the Mother was even more impressed with his wife,Mary Christine Woodruffe Ware, a renowned psychic before she married Théon. Mrs.Théon, née Woodruffe, was the sister of another Sanskrit scholar, Indian civilservant, and Victorian mystic, “Arthur Avalon,” or Sir John Woodruffe.17[36_endnote-title.html#jjj17]At the same time, 1907, that Mirra Alfassa was learning occultism from Théon,Woodruffe was writing Hewitt looking for information on Tantric texts in Bengal.Woodruffe and Hewitt apparently became friends, as the anonymous review ofHewitt’s last book, Primitive Traditional History, in the journal Nature wasactually written by Woodruffe. Woodruffe’s books, published under the pen nameArthur Avalon, began to appear in the early 1910s and continued into the 1920s,and they remain influential in modern mystical circles.While Woodruffe knew Hewitt and knew Théon, we have no direct evidence thatHewitt knew Théon. Yet the indirect evidence can be found in the expressions ofother people such as the Matrimandir of the Mother, who certainly knew Théon,and in the very interesting uncertainty over the precise length of theprecessional year we mentioned above. Hewitt is trying to make his evidence fora longer precessional period of 25,920 years fit within a framework of 24,000years, composed of four 6,000-year ages. And this same confusion recurs in T. H.Burgoyne’s Light of Egypt, which was derived, somewhat loosely, from theoriginal teachings of the hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor. Although Burgoyneconfuses different kinds of years, and even invents a few new kinds, à laHewitt, he correctly states that the 12,000-year period of the Great Age isactually “the motion of the earth’s center (the sun) through space, around astill greater center,” echoing both Hewitt and the Mother, and then follows upin another direction by using the larger period of 25,920 years.THE MYSTERY OF THE STONE ALTARWhile this doesn’t conclusively prove that Hewitt’s mystical leanings werefueled by contact with the hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, the connection, as weshall see later, is very suggestive. More problematic, however, is the origin ofthe mysterious linga altar that Hewitt describes. This is his key piece ofphysical evidence, and, as we saw above, it is, at least as Hewitt interpretsit, a summation of the cosmic axes and centers in the same manner as theMother’s Matrimandir. But as our research on this subject went deeper, a mostcurious enigma developed.Pierre du Chatellier, in whose house Hewitt examined this linga stone, was infact the leading archaeologist of megalithic Britanny, with many publishedpapers to his credit. In 1894, he excavated a Neolithic tumulus, or mound, atthe end of a much older row of standing stones, and he found an omphalos-likemarker stone. In 1896 he published his results, and in his published monographwe find that the marker was devoid of any carvings at all. Chatellier did notexcavate any other tumuli that match Hewitt’s description, and nowhere in hismonographs does he describe any stone with the carvings mentioned by Hewitt.Indeed, Neolithic stones with any carving similar to those described by Hewittare so rare as to be nonexistent. At least none has been found to date.Carvings, of the nature Hewitt describes, belong to a much more recent time,perhaps even down to the historical period, not to the Neolithic or megalithicera.But unless we are prepared to claim that Hewitt simply made it up, he must haveseen something at the Château Kernuz. Hewitt was there apparently after 1896,the published date of Chatellier’s article, and before 1900, when the book wentto the publisher. Could there have been another stone, one not excavated byPierre du Chatellier, that Hewitt examined and interpreted? And if so, where didit come from?Following the basic designs Hewitt describes brings us back to Basque country.Marker stones, similar to Hewitt’s linga, are common throughout the Basqueregion, complete with crosses and sun wheels, Hewitt’s female swastikas. Couldhis linga have come from the Basque country? From his comments, Hewitt obviouslynever connected it with the Basques, even though he considers them to be relatedto the Neolithic Gothic Celts who he thought had carved the linga stone on aVedic basis. If he had known the stone’s true origin, he would certainly havemade much more of it than he did. After his linga example, Hewitt never againmentions the Basques.In one of those research synchronicities that suddenly connects what were untilthen widely separated pieces of the puzzle, we came across the solution to thisminor mystery and found that it led us back to the heart of Le Mystère, theCyclic Cross of Hendaye. With that solution in hand, we were finally able toanswer the question of why, if the Hendaye chapter was written in the mid-1920s,it was not included in Le Mystère until the second, 1957 edition. And thatsolution pointed us even deeper into the mystery of Fulcanelli’s identity.“Leaving the station, a country road, skirting the railway line, leads to theparish church, situated in the middle of the village,” Fulcanelli comments inthe Hendaye chapter.This church, with its bare walls and its massive, squat rectangular tower,stands in a square a few steps above ground level and bordered by leafy trees.It is an ordinary, dull building, which has been renovated and is of noparticular interest. However, near the south transept there is a humble stonecross, as simple as it is strange, hiding amidst the greenery of the square. Itwas formerly in the parish cemetery and it was only in 1842 that it was broughtto its present site near the church. At least, that is what was told me by anold Basque man, who had for many years acted as sexton. As for the origin ofthis cross, it is unknown and I was not able to obtain any information at allabout the date of its erection. However, judging by the shape of the base andthe column, I would not think that it could be before the end of the seventeenthor beginning of the eighteenth century.18 [36_endnote-title.html#jjj18]This is all that Fulcanelli tells us concerning the origins of the cross atHendaye, and it is as misleading as his preceding comment that Hendaye hasnothing to interest “the tourist, the archaeologist or the artist.” The date of1842 for the placement of the cross in the churchyard points directly to thelocal d’Abbadie family, who purchased the headland in that year and paid for therenovations to the church. The current sexton, who may be the grandson orgreat-grandson of the one to whom Fulcanelli spoke, quite clearly knows that thecross was moved and placed by the d’Abbadie family, so it is hard to believethat Fulcanelli’s sexton didn’t also have that information. Yet Fulcanellidoesn’t mention it.According to the history of the Château d’Abbadie that was published by the CapeScience Foundation, several carved “Basque headstones” were discovered at thesite of the château during its construction. These remained for years on thegrounds, displayed in a small garden, until they were sent to the foremostmegalithic archaeologists of the era for study in 1896, two years before Antoined’Abbadie died.The archives at the Château d’Abbadie, which is now open to the public as amuseum, describe one piece has having a Basque sun wheel, several crosses, and adirectional “wind rose.” This piece, according to the archives, was sent toPierre du Chatellier, of the Château Kernuz in Britanny, in late 1896 at therequest of M. d’Abbadie. It was never returned, apparently, because there is nofurther record of it in the archives of the Château d’Abbadie.19[36_endnote-title.html#jjj19] The “wind rose” is specific enough for us to besure that this stone, from the headland at Hendaye, was in fact the linga Hewittwas describing. His eight-rayed star in a square is most clearly seen as a kind“wind rose” or compass marker for the four directions and their quarters. As theBasques were sailors, this symbolism seems appropriate, and serves to clinch ouridentification.Hewitt’s altar stone, his object that sums up the alignment of the three axesand the three centers, originally stood on an isolated plateau overlooking thesea at Hendaye. It is perhaps the original model from which theseventeenth-century craftsman composed the cross at Hendaye. Hewitt’s stone, andhis oddly derived and very esoteric interpretation of it, serves as a kind oftouchstone, one that shows up the true “gold,” as we work our way through thedifferent views of the cross.The d’Abbadie connection presents us with a solid fact, that the d’Abbadiefamily was responsible for placing the cross in the churchyard, which Fulcanelliis at pains to avoid mentioning. Even with his careful avoidance, the date of1842 would have led any reader or researcher in 1926 straight to the family.Exactly what revealing the d’Abbadie family’s involvement with the Hendaye crosswould have disclosed is a subject that will have to wait until after we haveexamined both our three commentaries on the cross, by Boucher, Fulcanelli, and“Paul Mevryl,” and the cross itself. Once we understand the cross’s message,then we can return to the mystery of what this connection, and its obscuration,tells us about the real Fulcanelli. But first we must examine the threeperspectives on the cross that comprise the Hendaye myth."},{"pageContent":"ELEVENTHE MESSAGE OF THE GREAT CROSS AT HENDAYEimage [images/image318-00.jpg]TRIANGULATING THE MYTH AND THE MESSAGEIn attempting to decipher the cross at Hendaye’s mythic meaning, we can draw onthree different but interrelated interpretations or viewpoints. Along withFulcanelli’s chapter on the cross in Le Mystère, we have Jules Boucher’s 1936article in Consolation and Paul Mevryl’s epilogue to The Fulcanelli Phenomenon.These perspectives act like lenses, some microscopic, some telescopic, some asdistorting as a fun-house mirror, but before we turn to the monument we need toreview these viewpoints with care. Even the distortions, we shall find, canoffer us valuable information. So let us examine them in chronological order.Jules Boucher’s 1936 article is our first glimpse of the monument to the end oftime (see fig. 1.4 [11_chapter-title-3.html#fig_1-4]). According to the article,a M. Lemoine, a painter of “great talent,” gave Boucher some vacationphotographs of the cross and thereby brought the monument to Boucher’sattention. A search of French artists of the period turns up no Lemoines. Thename Lemoine, which is simply French for “the monk,” is not very common, whichleads us to suspect that it is a pseudonym.Boucher quotes Fulcanelli in the article, but does not connect him directly toHendaye. He quotes from Fulcanelli’s Dwellings of the Philosophers about thesymbolism of the Saint Andrew’s cross, a quote that echoes Hewitt’s comments.The article begins with a description of the cross. Boucher lists the pointsthat interest him—the four faces of the base, the Latin inscription, the INRI,and the Saint Andrew’s cross above the inscription—and then he plungesimmediately into an interpretation of the inscription. As we noted in chapter 1[11_chapter-title-3.html], Boucher’s attempt shows some familiarity withFulcanelli’s interpretation and method. Boucher, however, stops short ofrevealing the complete decipherment, appearing in fact to veer off in an odddirection.Boucher moves to the symbols on the base, going west, east, north, and south ina zigzag, forming a crossing pattern that closely resembles a Gothic mason’smark (see fig. 11.7 on page 323).1 [36_endnote-title.html#kkk1] He begins withthe western face, which he calls the “devouring sun,” telling us that itssixteen rays suggest the sixteenth trump of the Tarot, The Blasted Tower, animage of catastrophe. While this suggestion is close to the mark, particularlythe idea of using Tarot images for the pedestal symbols, it is also aninteresting choice, for if one knew that the image had something to do with acatastrophe, one might simply focus on the catastrophe trump without looking anyfurther. The more obvious Tarot trump would be The Sun.The star image on the eastern side receives the same treatment. Boucher saysthat it greets the east and has eight rays and therefore symbolizes trump numbereight, Justice. On the north side is the moon image, yet Boucher does not followhis Tarot interpretation and suggest that this is trump number eighteen, TheMoon. He merely says it is an obscure Egyptian symbol that hides a secret.The south side contains an image of the Four Ages according to Boucher, but hedoes not mention the obvious Tarot analogue, The Last Judgment. He gives theFour Ages Ovid’s names, the Ages of Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Iron. He concludesthat we are living in the Iron Age, full of “crimes and calamities,” but doesnot offer any predictions of double catastrophes. Indeed, later in the articleBoucher says that it is not possible to pinpoint the exact location or time ofthe catastrophe. But he does predict something dire.2[36_endnote-title.html#kkk2]Perhaps that was all the information he was given, and, not having the wholestory, was left to fill in the gaps as best he could. The Tarot suggestionsalone point to the fact that Boucher’s sources, if not Boucher himself,understood the importance of the Tarot in deciphering the monument. Theattributions that Boucher gives are somewhat off base, as we shall see, but whathe leaves out points to the correct attributions. There are obvious Tarotchoices for all four faces, which Boucher seems to avoid at all cost. At best,this is curious, and suggests that we are meant to complete his speculation andlook deeper for our Tarot images. It is even possible that Boucher planned itthat way, with obvious misdirection and gaps in symbolism.“The Cyclic Cross at Hendaye” is the penultimate chapter of Fulcanelli’smasterpiece (see appendix E [35_chapter-title-22.html] for the complete text ofthe chapter). After wading through thickets of erudition and punning slang inthe rest of Le Mystère, this chapter feels awash with the bright sunlight of itsBasque setting. The description of the monument and its location is seeminglyclear and direct. Even the explanation of the monument’s apparent meaning issimple and virtually free of the green-language code used throughout the rest ofthe book. Or so it appears on the surface.“Whatever its age, the Hendaye cross shows by the decoration of its pedestalthat it is the strangest monument of primitive millenarism [sic], the rarestsymbolical translation of chiliasm, which I have ever met.” Coming fromFulcanelli, this is high praise indeed. He goes on to tell us that “the unknownworkman, who made these images, possessed real and profound knowledge of theuniverse.”image [images/image320-00.jpg]Figure 11.1. The Latin inscription on the transverse arm of the cross, whichreads “Hail, O Cross, the Only Hope.”Fulcanelli continues with a description of the Latin inscription on thetransverse arm of the cross. As shown in figure 11.1, the inscription containsseventeen letters in the following order: OCRUXAVES / PESUNICA. As Fulcanellinotes, this translates quite simply as “Hail, O Cross, the Only Hope,” a commonLatin mortuary inscription. On the cross, however, the phrase is oddly broken,for the first S in the word spes, “hope,” is found on the first line, and therest of the word is found on the second, which leaves us with the words aves andpes. This creates an obvious grammatical error. If pes, “foot,” is the correctword, then its adjective should agree in gender and be the masculine unicus, notthe feminine unica.Oddly enough, Fulcanelli does not try to create meaning from this discrepancy.He doesn’t indulge in anagrammatic wordplay, only notes that it was done onpurpose. As he says, “[S]ince this apparent mistake exists, it follows that itmust really have been intended.” Regarding the meaning of the inscription, hewrites, “I had already been enlightened by studying the pedestal and knew inwhat way and by means of what key the Christian inscription of the monumentshould be read; but I was anxious to show investigators what help may beobtained in solving hidden matters from plain common sense, logic andreasoning.” Then he moves on to interpret the inscription by reading the Latinas if it were French. The result is “Il est écrit que la vie se réfugie en unseul espace”—that is, “It is written that life takes refuge in a single space.”It is difficult to take this reading seriously. The transformations of meaningare almost unexplained, except by reference to obscure authors and periodicals,and seem based mostly on a deliberate mistake. Fulcanelli declares: “The letterS, which takes on the curving shape of a snake, corresponds to the Greek khi (X)[or chi] and takes over its esoteric meaning.” This is so odd as to be jarring.In no system of esoteric knowledge have we been able to find any suchcorrespondence as Fulcanelli suggests here. Therefore, it must be a specificattribution, an unusual but precise meaning, used to suggest something importantthat could not be conveyed without bending the rules.Fulcanelli continues about the meaning of the S: “It is the helicoidal track ofthe sun, having arrived at the zenith of its curve across space, at the time ofcyclic catastrophe . . . thanks to the symbolic value of the letter S, displacedon purpose, we understand that the inscription must be translated in secretlanguage.” Following his French rendering of the Latin mentioned above, hecasually suggests that the phrase means “that a country exists, where deathcannot reach man at the terrible time of the double cataclysm.” What is more,only the elite will be able to find “this promised land.”On very little direct evidence, Fulcanelli is telling us that the cross atHendaye is a marker stone for some future catastrophe. Fulcanelli continues hissurvey of the monument, moving to the INRI inscription on the opposite side ofthe transverse arm of the cross, which he calls the front of the monument. Heconfuses the order of the images by saying that the INRI corresponds with the“schematic image of the cycle,” the four A’s in the angles of a cross found onthe south side of the pedestal.This could imply that the INRI and the four A’s are on the same side or face ofthe monument. In fact, this is not the case. The eight-rayed star faces in thesame direction as the INRI inscription. Again, Fulcanelli uses a deliberateobscurity to make an important point: “Thus we have two symbolic crosses, bothinstruments of the same torture. Above is the divine cross, exemplifying thechosen means of expiation; below is the global cross, fixing the pole of thenorthern hemisphere and locating in time the fatal period of this expiation.”And then Fulcanelli adds a very strange image: “God the Father holds in his handthis globe, surmounted by the fiery sign. The four great ages—historicalrepresentations of the four ages of the world— have their sovereigns shownholding this same attribute. They are Alexander, Augustus, Charlemagne and LouisXIV.” He then states that “[i]t is this which explains the inscription INRI,exoterically translated as Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudeorum (Jesus of Nazareth, Kingof the Jews), but which gives to the cross its secret meaning: Igne NaturaRenovatur Integra (By fire nature is renewed whole). For it is by fire and infire that our hemisphere will soon be tried. And just as, by means of fire, goldis separated from impure metals, so, Scripture says, the good will be separatedfrom the wicked on the great Day of Judgment.”Fulcanelli supplies us with a footnoted comment on the four sovereigns: “Thefirst three are emperors, the fourth is only a king, the Sun King, thusindicating the decline of the star and its last radiation. This is dusk, theforerunner of the long cyclic night, full of horror and terror, ‘the abominationof desolation.’ ” His esoteric interpretation of INRI, “by fire nature isrenewed whole,” goes directly to the issue of chiliasm and a cleansingdestruction as a prelude to a re-created and Edenic world. Alchemy, according toFulcanelli’s last sentence above, is the very heart of eschatology. Just as goldis refined, so will our age be refined—by fire.Next, Fulcanelli takes up the images on the four faces of the pedestal.Fulcanelli changes Boucher’s zigzag listing of them to a clockwise list, givingthem as sun, moon, star, and “geometric figure.” The illustration accompanyingthe text (plate 48 in Le Mystère) shows the same pattern. Fulcanelli ignores thesun, moon, and star and spends the last pages of the chapter elaborating on thefourfold nature of the “geometric figure, which . . . is none other than thediagram used by the initiates to indicate the solar cycle.”It is a simple circle, divided into four sectors by two diameters cutting eachother at right angles. The sectors each bear an A, which shows that they standfor the four ages of the world. This is a complete hieroglyph of the universe,composed of the conventional signs for heaven and earth, the spiritual and thetemporal, the macrocosm and microcosm, in which major emblems of the redemption(cross) and the world (circle) are found in association.In medieval times, these four phases of the great cyclic period, whosecontinuous rotation was expressed in antiquity by means of a circle divided bytwo perpendicular diameters, were generally represented by the four evangelistsor by their symbolic letter, which was the Greek alpha, or, more often still, bythe four evangelical beasts surrounding Christ, the living human representationof the cross. This is the traditional formula, which one meets frequently on thetympana of Roman porches. Jesus is shown there seated, his left hand resting ona book, his right hand raised in the gesture of benediction, and separated fromthe four beasts, which attend him, by an ellipse, called the mystic almond.These groups, which are generally isolated from other scenes by a garland ofclouds, always have their figures placed in the same order, as may be seen inthe cathedrals of Chartres (royal portal) and Le Mans (west porch), in theChurch of the Templars at Luz (Hautes Pyrénées) and the Church of Civray(Vienne), on the porch of St. Trophime at Arles, etc.3[36_endnote-title.html#kkk3]Fulcanelli connects the traditional image of the Four Ages, the cherubic beastsor the evangels, to an ellipse, the vesica piscis or the “mystic almond,” andthe letter A or alpha, which suggests that he meant this image to be a directinterpretation of the “geometric figure” of the cross and four A’s. The secretnature of this “complete hieroglyph of the universe” can be found in publicview, on the facades of the Gothic cathedrals—for example, in figure 11.2.On Fulcanelli’s list, however, every cathedral is connected with the cult of theBlack Madonna, or ancient goddess worship. While directing us to the meaning ofthe Four Ages, Fulcanelli is also inspiring us to look closer, to understand whycertain places, such as those he lists, are important and how they are related.Fulcanelli makes sure that the reader follows his main point. After quoting fromSaint John regarding the four beasts (Rev. 4:6–7), he then cites Ezekiel’svision of the “four living creatures” (Ezek. 1:4–5, 10–11). His penultimateparagraph takes up the notion of the Four Ages, or yugas, in Hindu mythology andnotes that “our own age,” the Age of Iron, or Kali Yuga, is the time when “humanvirtue reaches the utmost degree of feebleness and senility,” being “the age ofmisery, misfortune and decrepitude.” In this passage, Fulcanelli’s comments echoboth Hewitt and Max Théon, of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor. Fulcanellimakes no further predictions other than to note that we are in the Iron Age ofthe Kali Yuga.image [images/image324-00.jpg]Figure 11.2. A. The twelfth-century tympanum on the porch of Saint Trophime inArles showing the “complete hieroglyph of the universe.” This image is theconcluding plate (no. 49) in Le Mystère des cathédrales. B. The geometry of thetraditional medieval schematic for representing Christ surrounded by the symbolsof the four evangelists is also the design of the New Jerusalem as described inRevelation.“The age of iron has no other seal than that of Death. Its hieroglyph is theskeleton, bearing the attributes of Saturn: the empty hourglass, symbol of timerun out, and the scythe, reproduced in the figure seven, which is the number oftransformation, of destruction, of annihilation,” Fulcanelli instructs us. “TheGospel of this fatal age is the one written under the inspiration of St.Matthew.” He follows this observation with a group of Greek words related to thebasic mu-alpha-theta root of the name Matthew, connecting it to the words for“science,” “knowledge,” “study,” and “to learn.” “It is the Gospel according toScience, the last of all but for us the first, because it teaches us that, savefor a small number of the elite, we must all perish. For this reason, the angelwas made the attribute of St. Matthew, because science, which alone is capableof penetrating the mystery of things, of beings and their destiny, can give manwings to raise him to knowledge of the highest truths and finally to God.”On the surface, Fulcanelli’s chapter takes us little further toward our goal ofunderstanding the Hendaye cross than Jules Boucher’s 1936 magazine article.Fulcanelli adds the explicit warning of an imminent catastrophe, a season ofdouble catastrophe that will try the northern hemisphere by fire, and the hopeof a place where “death cannot reach man at the terrible time of the doublecatastrophe.” He relates the Vedic idea of the four yugas to the Westernprophetic tradition of Revelation and Ezekiel. By aligning his apocalyptictraditions, Fulcanelli points the reader toward a few important symbolic clues:Saturn and the Gospel of Matthew.In chapter 3 [14_chapter-title-5.html], we saw that Matthew gives us the mostcomplete view of Jesus’ teachings on the end of the world and the coming Kingdomof Heaven. Matthew was someone who grasped the mystery at the core ofChristianity, for it is from him that we hear of Jesus’ Egyptian connections,the Star of Bethlehem and the journey of the Wise Men from the East, theMassacre of the Innocents, the temptation of the Messiah, and many other storieswith deep esoteric significance.Matthew 24:43–44 suggests that those who follow the Son of Man will indeed beable to calculate the time, and so be waiting in preparation. When he returns(25:31), he will separate the sheep from the goats, the subtle from the gross,on the basis of their compassion for their fellow men. In Matthew, we also findthe account of Mary Magdalene’s witness to the Resurrection, complete with itsown light metaphor. “His appearance was like lightning,” we are told, and Marydoes not at first recognize him.4 [36_endnote-title.html#kkk4] Matthew’s accountof the Resurrection ends with Christ’s Ascension in Galilee and hispronouncement of the Great Commission, the last line of which goes to the heartof the mystery: “And surely I am with you always, even to the end of theworld.”5 [36_endnote-title.html#kkk5]Fulcanelli announced that the cross at Hendaye points to the “great Day ofJudgment,” and that the seal of this moment in time is Death, with theattributes of the planet Saturn. This suggests that Saturn will somehow play arole in marking the end of this fourth age, a very unusual and productive idea,as we shall see a little later.In The Fulcanelli Phenomenon, K. R. Johnson included a chapter on the Hendayecross by someone called “Paul Mevryl.” Entitled “Epilogue in Stone,” thiscommentary on the Hendaye cross raises as many questions as it answers, not theleast of which is who is “Paul Mevryl”? In the introductory blurb, we are toldthat Mevryl “is a retired engineer, has an interest in cryptograms and hasstudied alchemy, Fulcanelli and other areas of arcane knowledge for many years.”In the text, Mevryl assumes a tone that suggests that if he is not Fulcanelli’sheir, he is at least his equal. Whoever he is, and he is as anonymous asFulcanelli, Mevryl is in on the game, and, with this article, became one of itsmajor players.Following Boucher and Fulcanelli, Mevryl confirms the apocalyptic content of themonument, and then spins off into a science-fiction story about exploding sunsand moon-size ark-ships. His explanation of the pedestal images becomes asomewhat murky discussion of planetary exchanges, first interstellar, involvingSirius, which he calls, suggestively, “the Sun behind the Sun,” and then withinthe solar system, involving Venus. This is so strange as to make a reader pausein amazement, if not give up entirely. Alchemy, as a subject, is absent from thearticle, which focuses solely on eschatology and catastrophe. His goal is simply“to lift a corner of the veil obscuring one vehicle of that teaching.” Mevrylsuggests that this division between alchemy and its eschatological content “isboth interesting to the casual reader and helpful to the student ofhermeticism.” And indeed, Mevryl’s article is very helpful, but only when youknow the secret. Otherwise, it obscures more than it reveals.6[36_endnote-title.html#kkk6]But Mevryl does know something: “The Cyclic Cross at Hendaye is a statement instone about The Stone and a record of the fact of success in the Great Work byan unknown man. Simultaneously, it is an observation upon the nature and timingof tremendous world events involving yet another kind of stone.” And his first,and perhaps most significant, question is: Why is the cross even at Hendaye?Concerning the alchemist-builder of the monument, Mevryl notes that “[t]here iscertainly no other indication that it was the scene of his triumph, except inthe possibility that it was so because the monument was originally erected inthe local cemetery.”At this point, Mevryl makes one of his leaps, suggesting that the cause might beHendaye’s closeness to the pilgrim route to the shrine of Santiago de Compostelain Spanish Galicia. He mentions Nicolas Flamel in passing and then focuses onthe green-language meaning of the Hendaye name itself. He breaks it down into“Hen Day–End Day–Ande” or “Egg–Apocalypse–Mountain,” and suggests that thismultiple meaning of the word Hendaye was a determining factor in its choice. Andhe squeezes in another reference to Flamel: “The Egg is the philosophical Egg ofalchemy, reminding us of Flamel’s ‘little poulet.’ This place name demonstratesthe presence at Hendaye of a double teaching.”Mevryl then smoothly jumps to his other, and perhaps more significant, reasonfor why the cross is at Hendaye: “Immediately following the Atlanteancatastrophe, the pitifully small remnants of that multi-million-strongcivilization reached safety along the shorelines of the Atlantic basin.” Mevrylcontinues: “[T]hese are the Basques, survivors of the last cyclic catastrophe tooverwhelm mankind and who have had a unique tribute to chiliasm set down ontheir border. Through this strange device, a memory is preserved from Iron Ageto Iron Age—nearly 12,000 years.” Mevryl sounds almost as if he were readingfrom Hewitt, down to the confusion over the length of time from Iron Age to IronAge.He continues by using the 12,000-year figure as a one-foot ruler to illustratethat even such a period of time is but a collection of human lives. “The wholespan of 12,000 years represents only a series of 192 such lifetimes. Knowledgeand teaching transmitted a mere 200 times is hardly inconceivable even to weshort-lived creatures.” Mevryl brings this back to Hendaye: “. . . and veryclose to the zero of today, [we find] the erection of the Cyclic Cross atHendaye. Here then, is a tribute to the long medley of more-than-human endeavourand an indication that there is an unbroken purpose at work in history. It isalso a reasonable point upon the time-scale to place a prediction that time isrunning out and that the Age is about to end.”And then Mevryl makes a very revealing and curious comment: “Yet we have hereprediction, not prophecy. Prophecy implies seership— long-sightedness, of beingaccurately informed about future time, coupled with a measure of certainty oftennot intended by the prophet himself. The Christian Bible is full of propheticutterances that are for the most part warnings rather than statements ofinexorable fact.”Just as we are absorbing the implications of Mevryl’s distinction betweenprophecy and prediction, he switches gears and presents us with the biblical“prophecy” found in the thirteenth chapter of Mark’s Gospel. He concludes:“Jesus took a penetrating look into and through our own times to the futureevents symbolised at Hendaye. We can be reasonably sure that they are in our owntimes, since He put together a number of more or less simultaneous events thatcould only occur separately in other epochs.” But even Jesus didn’t know theexact time. Mevryl suggests that any adept could have calculated the roughtiming. He points to Nostradamus and the “1999” quatrain, and suggests thatJesus may have known as much as Nostradamus, even if not the exact day and hour.He then suggests a parallel between an object coming in from deep space andscientists’ inability to predict with much accuracy the fall of Skylab to theearth. He concludes: “It is fair to suggest that the precise timing may bebeyond computation.” In this, Mevryl sees a possible hint of a reprieve from the“inexorable fact” of the coming events.But instead of being explicit, Mevryl quotes two significant passages from theKoran and then shifts to ancient Egypt and speculations on the “Osirian race . .. God-like men rather than gods.” Are they, “perhaps, mentors and directors ofterrestrial mankind?” Mevryl questions. From this, he determines that “withinthe highest levels of prophecy in Holy Writ there remains hope. A hope basedupon astronomical realities.”Mevryl then follows this up by suggesting that there is “a protective power”that has allowed mankind time to develop without destructive collisions fromouter space. “In that event,” he continues, “the chiliasm of Hendaye symbolisesnot absolute prophecy but an accurate prediction based directly upon humanity’sexperience over many Ages of cyclic time. Timings can be calculated;manifestations cannot.”He moves on from this point to his complex interpretation of the separateelements of the cross. While this section is filled with odd clues and equallyinsightful game playing, it is too extensive to cover in detail here. We shallrefer to the important clues and suggestions as we unravel the message of thecross itself, but for now we must get an overview of Mevryl’s thesis.Whoever Mevryl may in fact be, he presents us in these opening pages a handfulof basic truths without which it is impossible to go any further with anunderstanding of the Hendaye cross. We can summarize them as follows: 1. The location of Hendaye is critically important, both to the identity of Fulcanelli and in the symbolic sense of a “double teaching.” 2. The monument is a “prediction” of a specific group of astronomical events that happen separately at other times, but are forming an alignment or arrangement at just the time predicted on the monument. 3. This arrangement of astronomical events has been used as the traditional marker point of the Day of Judgment mentioned in the Gospel of Mark.Armed with these important points, it is time to turn to the cross and itsunusual symbols. Do they really say what Boucher, Fulcanelli, and Mevryl claimthey do? Can we solve the riddles and mysteries left by our three commentatorsand unravel the true message of the Hendaye cross?DECIPHERING THE CODEThe effect of reading Fulcanelli’s Hendaye chapter is not unlike that producedby a good conjuring trick, a sort of intellectual now-you-seeit-now-you-don’t.You think Fulcanelli has told you a secret, and he has, but you can’t quitefigure out what or how the secret works. All the clues are there, includinginstructions, but the picture is still confused.For example, we are told that the monument marks a future catastrophe, and thenwe are lectured on the evangelical beasts without being given a way to connectthese concepts. Fulcanelli is painting a picture that tells the reader, asclearly as he could, that the world is coming to an end.The unknown builder of the cross also knew that the world was coming to an end,and both Fulcanelli and the unknown builder suggest that they know the cause ofthe apocalypse. Fulcanelli even says that he knows where the place of refuge islocated for the time of the end of the world.Armed with the clues from Boucher, Fulcanelli, and Mevryl, it’s time to lookdirectly at the monument and let it speak for itself. If it is a marker of somefuture catastrophe, then exactly how does it tell us this? And, even moreimportant, does it really tell us when?The monument itself has three basic components: the upper cross, the column orpillar, and the pedestal. The upper cross has three symbolic components, thepillar is its own symbol, and the base has four symbols, for a total of eightsymbolic images. We can think of the entire monument as a schematic, orexploded-perspective view, of a single geometrical construct, the Cube of Spaceof the Bahir’s Precious Stone of the Wise.As shown in figure 11.3, the three symbolic components of the upper cross arethe INRI inscription, the X’s on the top cross, and the oddly broken Latininscription. These symbols offer us three interrelated meaning systems that,when taken together, give us the key to understanding the entire processsymbolized by the monument.image [images/image330-00.jpg]Figure 11.3. The front of the cross at Hendaye.The pillar stands as a unifying image that brings together the symbolic contentof the cross and the base. The pedestal’s four symbols must be taken as a unit,one in which the order and meaning of the symbolic components are in a state offlux, but the nature of the whole is constant. That is, the way the meaning isderived is flexible, but the meaning, as we shall see, remains the same nomatter how the sides are read. As shown in figure 11.4, the images on thepedestal, starting in the east and moving counterclockwise, include aneight-rayed starburst and an oddly shaped half moon/boat with a prominent eye.Next comes an angry sun face with bulging spiral eyes, dumbbell-shaped mouth,and prominent chin. Sixteen large spikes and sixteen smaller spikes inside acontaining outer circle surround the face. The sun circle itself is surroundedby four stars, placed in the corners of the rectangle and tilted so that theirdiagonal axes cut through the center point of the sun face. The final image isan oval that fills the entire space of the side and contains a cross with fourA’s in it. The A’s are unusual for having a sharply angled crossbar rather thanthe usual horizontal one.image [images/image331-00.jpg]Figure 11.4. The images of the faces of the pedestal.After taking each symbolic component in turn, we shall proceed to assemblingthem into an overall pattern of meaning.The Upper CrossThe INRI inscription on the upper cross places us firmly within the Rosicrucianalchemical tradition. As Fulcanelli tells us, this inscription can beinterpreted as one of the key maxims of alchemy: Igne Natura Renovatur Integra,or “By fire nature is renewed whole.” It is also Igne Nitrum Raris Invenitum, or“The shining is rarely found in fire.” Perhaps a more accurate way to view thesefour letters is as the initial letters of the Hebrew names of the elements: yam,which is water and the letter yod or I; nur, which is fire and the letter nun orN; ruach, which is air and the letter resh or R; and yebeshas, which is earthand the letter yod or I again. Figure 11.5 shows a complete table of esotericcorrespondences.This quaternity also suggests the Four Ages, one for each of the elements fromwater to the earth. In the rituals of the Golden Dawn, these Hebrew letters wereconsidered the “key word” and subjected to a sort of gnostic and kabbalisticanalysis. After the letters are converted into their Hebrew equivalents of thefour elements, they are then given their Yetziratic—that is, their zodiacal andplanetary—correspondences: Yod is Virgo; nun is Scorpio; resh is the Sun; andthe final yod is Virgo again.7 [36_endnote-title.html#kkk7]From this a pattern of the sequence of life, death, resurrection or rebirth, andnew life can be abstracted. The Golden Dawn then applied Egyptian god-forms tothese concepts: Life is Isis; death is Apophis; resurrection is Osiris. Fromthis they derived the name of the Gnostic high god IAO. These vowels had longbeen associated with a mysticism of light, as shown by their prominence in theBahir.8 [36_endnote-title.html#kkk8] Note that this arrangement begins and endswith Isis, implying the centrality of the “life” she bestows. We should alsokeep in mind that another, more Rosicrucian version of INRI can be read as IsisNaturae Regina Ineffabilis, or “Isis, the ineffable Queen of Nature.”image [images/image333-00.jpg]Figure 11.5. A table of INRI correspondences.In Hebrew gematria, which assigns each letter a numerical value, yod is 10, nunis 50, and resh is 200, making the number of the word equal to 270. The number270 is one of the precessional numbers, for multiplied by 8, the number of allthe symbols on the monument, the product equals 2,160, the number of solarcycles in one precessional month (12 × 2160 = 25,920 years, or one completeprecessional cycle or Great Year).Therefore, our first symbol tells us of a basic elemental pattern, that of life,death, resurrection, and new life, which is related to the mysteries of light,the “Fire where the shining can be found,” and the precessional cycle caused bythe earth’s tilted axis. The Bahir suggests that the tilted axis is the Tree ofthe Knowledge of Good and Evil, or that which gives each age its quality.There are two X’s on the upper cross, on the opposite side from the INRIinscription. The lower one is the middle X of the Latin inscription, so thatthese two X’s are stacked one on top of the other. The first impression is thatof the Roman numeral twenty written sideways. Fulcanelli goes to great lengthsto call our attention to them without giving the most obvious correspondence,that of trump 20 (or XX) of the Tarot, The Last Judgment. He does tell us thathe already knew the meaning of the upper cross from looking at the images on thepedestal, where the Last Judgment is indeed portrayed.Fulcanelli is not being misleading here, for the snake of the ecliptic, thecurving shape the path of the sun makes in its yearly round, is an importantpiece of the puzzle, even if it is nowhere else attributed to the Greek letterchi. As shown in figure 11.6, the pattern formed by the two X’s on top of eachother is indeed a diagram of the ecliptic snake, with the cross mark of the X’sshowing the equinoxes.This symbol tells us that the Last Judgment is the time when the elements,described by the INRI inscription, align in the right way, and X marks the spoton the equinoxes.image [images/image334-00.jpg]Figure 11.6. The ecliptic snake formed from combining the two X’s.Turning to the Latin inscription, the obvious meaning, “Hail, O Cross, the OnlyHope,” should not be discarded, for the phrase also refers to the crossingpattern of the equinoxes and the alignment of the ecliptic and the galacticmeridian. But the odd split in the middle of the inscription does suggest ariddle. Given Fulcanelli’s insistence that the X be read as an S or a snake, itis curious that spes backward is seps, Latin for “venomous serpent.” Readingthis word backward in translating the inscription produces “Hail, O Cross, theOnly Snake (or Serpent).” Perhaps this is another reference to the ecliptic orto the snakelike motion that the Milky Way makes as the year progresses. Theword pes, or foot, is clearly shown, although, as Fulcanelli notes, unica doesnot agree with it in gender. If we transpose two letters in unica, however, weget uncia, meaning “twelfth part,” and the phrase can be translated as “Hail, OCross, the measure of the twelfth part.” If we look at the top line of theinscription, we are left with two letters that are not really needed, the O andthe S. Putting these together at the beginning of the sentence gives us theLatin word OS, “bone” and also “inmost part” or “essence.” The phrase thenbecomes Os crux ave pes uncia, or “The essential cross salutes the measure ofthe twelfth part.” We can also read it as Os crux ave spes/seps unica, or “Theessence of the cross salutes the only hope/snake.”From all of these options, and without complicated anagrammatic play, we get animmediate complex of meanings. Just from a glance at the inscription, we cantell that the secret concerns an equinox cross, the cross of the ecliptic andthe galaxy and a snake that somehow measures the twelfth part, the last inch ofMevryl’s 12,000-year ruler. The inscription is telling us that the monument is away to measure when the snake and the crosses coincide. It also suggests thatthis knowledge is our only hope.The PillarThe pillar is the single symbol that unifies the whole vision. It issimultaneously the World Axis, the spine of the world, the World Tree, and theTree of Life. It is also the Egyptian Djed column, the backbone of Osiris, whichwas also thought of as the polar axis of the planet and the galactic meridian.9[36_endnote-title.html#kkk9] It is the stable axis through the center of thegalaxy that anchors the moving axis of the precession of the equinoxes. It alsorepresents the Teli from the Bahir. The Egyptians celebrated a realignment ofthe Djed pillar every 27, 54, and 108 years.10 [36_endnote-title.html#kkk10]These are, of course, numbers involved in the precession of the equinoxes,reduced by a factor of ten. The Djed, then, was also seen as a marker of aparticular time, the beginning and end of a long cycle.The central pillar of the cross at Hendaye, in suggesting that it has aDjed-like function, possibly points to the precessional realignment, of theEgyptian temples and of life itself, with the galactic axis. As the connectingconcept between the symbolic meaning of the upper cross and how this meaning isplayed out in the multileveled cross of the base, the pillar has beenconspicuous in its absence. None of our sources bothers to mention it. Afterall, the monument doesn’t need a pillar. Even if the upper cross rested on thebase, it could still be seen as above and not change the meaning. Direct mentionof the column was not included for a reason, for it symbolizes the Djed-likecosmic alignment the monument is describing. Not even Fulcanelli feltcomfortable drawing attention to its symbolic implications.The Base or PedestalGiven Fulcanelli’s identification of the double X’s on the upper cross with oneof the images on the base, we can only surmise that the image of the four A’swas indeed meant to represent Tarot trump 20, The Last Judgment. There are noclues about what Tarot cards correspond to the star, the moon, and the sun,images that Fulcanelli does not comment on at all. As noted above, he does,however, go on at great length about the fourfold attributes of the LastJudgment, insisting that we pay attention to the four evangelists and theiranimal forms. Fortunately, all of these symbols relate to the monument as awhole as much or more than they relate to the four A’s of the Last Judgment, andthey give us an important clue about how to use the monument as a galacticmarker.To understand this, we must first of all locate the monument and its symbols inspace. Fulcanelli tells us that the front of the monument is the side with theINRI inscription. This is also the side of the pedestal that has the star, andit faces east. The sun faces west, the moon faces north, and the Last Judgment,the four A’s, faces south.Now let’s look at each symbol individually. As figure 11.7 shows, our threesources have each suggested a different pattern for ordering the images on thepedestal. Boucher proposed a zigzag, Fulcanelli a clockwise circle, and Mevryl acounterclockwise circle, and we must be careful not to lose sight of theirintrinsic interconnectedness.image [images/image337-00.jpg]Figure 11.7. Three analysis patterns of the images on the base.Because the star is on the side that faces east, one might tend to think of itas the Morning Star, Venus, but also Sirius. Both of these are intriguingattributions, pointing as they do toward Isis, the Egyptian goddess who was themodel for the Christian Mary. Isis was linked to Sirius in Egypt. Her husband,Osiris, was thought to be the constellation Orion, which Sirius follows at arespectful distance. Sirius was also used as a time-keeping star in ancientEgypt. Its rise before the sun, as the Morning Star, marked the annual floodingof the Nile. Venus can also be used as a time-keeping marker, one whoseperiodicity can be used to track the precessional motion.11[36_endnote-title.html#kkk11] Neither of these options, however, seems to fitthe meaning on the monument. Given the monument’s current alignment, we can’thelp but stand in the west looking east through the rising sun toward theeight-rayed starburst, which suggests some sort of heliacal rising. (To see thiswe must imagine the base as transparent, as shown in fig. 11.8.)The problem is that heliacal risings of Venus and Sirius are too common to beused as an indicator of any large period between catastrophes. Following ourTarot trump pattern, the star on the pedestal would be simply The Star, trump17. Interestingly enough, most Tarot cards of The Star show it as eight-rayed.Its zodiacal attribution is Aquarius, the sign opposite Leo, and its Hebrewletter is heh, the window. From this we can speculate that this star is somehowrelated to the cycles of time, the dragon axis of the Teli, revealed to Abraham.image [images/image338-00.jpg]Figure 11.8. The sun and star panels seen in transparency, making “the sunbehind the sun.”At first glance, the sun face is indeed a devouring sun as Boucher tells us. Itsdesign is vaguely Mesoamerican, suggesting Aztec or Incan calendrical sun disks.None of our sources draws any attention to this obvious fact. While the angrysun does suggest a catastrophe motif, the more obvious Tarot image for this faceis The Sun, trump 19. This card is attributed to Leo, and the Hebrew letterresh, the R of the Lallemant mansion’s enigmatic credence, is its Hebrew letter.Its simple meaning of “completion of a cycle” points to its basic meaning on themonument. The sun will complete a great cycle, perhaps even the great cycle, themonument implies. The sun face is opposite the eight-rayed star, and, as Bouchersuggests, there is a numerical connection between them (see fig. 11.9). Thestar’s rays grow by a geometric progression on the sun face, doubling orcrossing from 8 to 16 to 32. Mevryl’s idea of the sun behind the sun issuggestive, for it makes the star a symbol of Sirius. We are given no clueconcerning the four stars surrounding the sun. Mevryl does have a few ideas onthe stars, including the possibility that they are the inner and outerplanets.12 [36_endnote-title.html#kkk12]The Moon is the most curious of the images on the pedestal of the Hendaye cross(see fig. 11.10).It is clearly the storybook man-in-the-moon face, but with a prominent eye. Theimage is also echoed on the traditional rendition of the Tarot trump called TheMoon. This makes the association to the trump easy, but we are left unsure ofits meaning. The Moon, trump 18, is the card of illusion and unconscious forces,and it is attributed to Pisces and the Hebrew letter qoph. The Moon is acrossfrom the Last Judgment, indicating that it is somehow involved in marking thatmoment in time. But how? The answer becomes obvious only when we arrange thepedestal’s faces into their Tarot equivalents.image [images/image339-00.jpg]Figure 11.9. The sun superimposed on the star.image [images/image339-01.jpg]Figure 11.10. The moon on the pedestal of the monument.Fulcanelli focuses most of his discussion on the final image, the four A’s/LastJudgment, because of its undoubted importance. But what exactly is it showingus? Since Fulcanelli is so clear in his insistence that this face is the LastJudgment, we shouldn’t hesitate to examine the traditional image for this trump,which is number 20, for clues. In the oldest versions, an angel with a trumpetsporting an equal-armed cross, such as found on the monument face, resurrectsthree people from their graves. The angel, perhaps Gabriel, is surrounded by aheavenly radiance, and thirteen rays shoot down toward the newly risen dead.From this we can discern that the Last Judgment is not the Day of Wrath, whenthe wicked are punished, but rather the beginning of the chiliast millennium.Fulcanelli’s discussion, however, seems to jump from obvious references to theLast Judgment, reinforcing our Tarot interpretation of this face, to equallyobvious references to the last Tarot trump, number 21, The World, whose Hebrewletter is tau and astrological attribution is Saturn. The four archangels arenot shown on The Last Judgment trump, but are the principal motif of The Worldcard. Thus, Fulcanelli is telling us that we must include the Tarot trump TheWorld in our interpretation.Each of the four A’s symbolizes an age of the Great Year, and their brokencrossbar is used in printer’s mark code to signify a millennium (see fig.11.11). From this, we can see that the A’s represent either 4,000 years, takingus back to the time of Abraham, or 12,000 years, Mevryl’s asteroid periodicity,if we think of each A as 3,000 years. Both of these dates are suggestive, but,as we shall find, the 12,000-year date, 10,000 B.C.E., is the most interesting.The Tarot trump The Last Judgment is also associated with the element offire—hence, the predictions of being tried by divine fire. If we takeFulcanelli’s suggestion and place the four fixed signs of the zodiac on the fourA’s, an interesting pattern emerges. The upper pair would be Leo, the Lion, andScorpio, the Eagle; below that would be Aquarius, the Water Carrier, and Taurus,the Bull, if we match the pattern on the facade of Arles’ Saint TrophimeCathedral (see fig. 11.2A). The X formed by this arrangement becomesLeo/Aquarius and Scorpio/ Taurus. Since this X is also our Saint Andrew’s crossfrom the upper part of the monument, we can conclude that the ages are measuredfrom equinox to equinox. The Last Judgment begins when the Great Cross isformed, at the equinox period when Leo/Aquarius forms a right angle withScorpio/Taurus.image [images/image341-00.jpg]Figure 11.11. Samples of sacred A’s from early French Gnostic watermarks. To themedieval mind, the V-shaped cross stroke of the capital A implied an M as in“Ave Millenarium.” From Harold Bayley, The Lost Language of Symbolism, 2 vols.(New York: Citadel Press, n.d.).THE MONUMENT SPEAKS: THE SEASON OF THE APOCALYPSEWith all the pieces of the Hendaye puzzle now spread before us, we must makesense of the mystery. Our solution must be self-contained and it must beaccurate—that is, capable of interpreting astronomical reality. Only then willthe monument’s message be clear and unambiguous.The upper cross tells us that the Last Judgment is timed to the precessionalcycle of the equinoxes, and, whether or not there is a place of refuge, thisdisaster happens when the precessional dragon axis, also the Tree of theKnowledge of Good and Evil, forms a cross or right angle to the Tree of Life,the galactic dragon axis. The pillar, the Djed, reinforces this idea of aprecessional alignment with the galactic axis. The base presents a way to refinethe timing of this event.We needed a starting point, however, to begin our calculations. The HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn, which preserved some key pieces of the puzzle,supplied the hint that if Leo is put on the spring equinox, the zodiac willalign properly.13 [36_endnote-title.html#kkk13] If we use the beginning of theAge of Leo, roughly 13,000 years ago, as our starting point, then the monument,once its symbolism is understood, could be made to reveal a date for thebeginning of the end of time.The answer is at once both simple and complex, and it confirms the depth ofunderstanding of the Tree of Life as a cosmological model on the part ofFulcanelli and of the builder of the monument. Starting with the directions, theimages on the base, and their Tarot and zodiacal associations we get:image [images/image342-00.jpg]On the monument, the star on the east and the moon on the north together suggestthat the northeast corner symbolizes the cusp of Aquarius/Pisces. Opposite isthe junction of the sun and the element of fire. We can take this as the cusp ofLeo/Virgo, since The Sun trump is attributed to Leo. This forms one of our axes.The northwest/southeast line becomes the Scorpio/Sagittarius–Taurus/Geminigalactic axis, from center to edge, so that our simple arrangement of Tarotattributions, shown in figure 11.12, gives us our correct alignment of the Cubeof Space.If we use as our starting point the moment when the spring equinox fell on thecusp of Leo/Virgo, we arrive at a date of March 22, 10,958 B.C.E. Half aprecessional cycle later, 12,960 years, brings us to 2002, when Leo/Virgo fallson the fall equinox. The monument also records this 180-degree rotation ofsymbols around the galactic axis. In 10,958 B.C.E., the sun rose in the east inLeo/Virgo as the moon set in Aquarius/Pisces. The monument reverses this, withthe sun in the west and the moon in the east, to show the flip of precessionalmidpoints, the Leo/Virgo equinoxes.image [images/image343-00.jpg]Figure 11.12. Correspondence of the Hendaye cross and Tree of Life/Tarot images.The four Tarot trumps, The Star, The Moon, The Sun, and The Last Judgment,represent the four faces of the Hendaye cross. The edges are aligned to thegreat cross of the galactic alignment, September 22–23, 2002.If the midpoint of the classically counted Great Year really falls on the fallequinox of 2002, then the monument should point directly to that moment in time.The arrangement of the four evangelists or fixed signs in the pattern of thefour A’s on the Last Judgment panel supports this alignment, as does thetympanum designs of Arles and Chartres. But to be truly specific, the monumentmust give us something that precisely defines that moment in time. On the sunface, it does.The key, of course, is where to stand. Mevryl’s clues suggest that we takeChampagne’s frontispiece to Le Mystère literally and stand between the paws ofthe Sphinx on the Giza plateau. Thanks to the Voyager 2 computer software, wewere able to do this prior to the event and check our conclusions. Dawn onSeptember 23, 2002, local Sphinx time, is also close to the moment of the fallequinox, which brings the whole pattern into synchronization.On that day the sun rose on the cusp of Leo/Virgo, with the near-full moonsetting on the cusp of Aquarius/Pisces. As shown in figure 11.13, in the sky asthe sun rose on that day were the three superior planets, Mars and Jupiter closetogether in Leo and Cancer, respectively, and Saturn on the mid-heaven cusp ofGemini/Taurus; below the horizon were the two inferior planets, Venus andMercury in Virgo and Libra, respectively. This matches the four stars of thepedestal’s sun face, with Mars and Jupiter above the horizon and Mercury andVenus below.But all three superior planets are visible, for Saturn stands high in themid-heaven on the cusp of Taurus/Gemini, in opposition to the center of thegalaxy. Fulcanelli is aware of this: “The age of iron has no other seal thanthat of Death. Its hieroglyph is the skeleton, bearing the attributes of Saturn:the empty hourglass, symbol of time run out, and the scythe, reproduced in thefigure seven, which is the number of transformation, of destruction, ofannihilation.”14 [36_endnote-title.html#kkk14]image [images/image344-00.jpg]Figure 11.13. Planetary alignment at dawn on the fall equinox, September 22,2002, with the Sphinx as zero point.But it is hard to see how this configuration of the planets can be derived fromthe monument unless we consider the kabbalistic Tree of Life. Even though heinsists that the four A’s represent the Last Judgment, Fulcanelli associates thepanel with the Tarot trump The World. As we noted above, this suggests that wemust somehow include The World in our interpretation.The answer, of course, is Saturn, the planet associated with the trump TheWorld. In our alignment, Taurus/Gemini falls on the south-east corner, thejunction between the star, our first symbol, and the four A’s, our last. Itseems a natural continuation of the pattern to insert our extra trump at thisjuncture, and when we do, the Tarot image matches the pattern in the sky. Saturndoes fall on the galactic edge of Taurus/Gemini on our equinox morning,demonstrating the precision of the monument’s timing.This becomes even clearer when we look at our Tree of Life diagram and note thatwe have been using the bottom five paths on the Tree (fig. 11.14).image [images/image345-00.jpg]Figure 11.14. The lower paths on the Tree of Life showing the correspondences tothe alignments on the Hendaye cross.The paths are arranged in the same symmetry as the faces of the monument. Thestar and the sun paths are connected through the sefirah Yesod, as the moon andthe Last Judgment are linked through Malkuth, forming the same oppositions as onthe monument. The star and the moon, however, are on the same side of the Treeas are the sun and the Last Judgment, creating our main northwest/southeastaxis. This interlocking symmetry mirrors the arrangement on the monument, andboth seem to circle the middle pillar of the galactic axis. Indeed, with theaddition of The World/Saturn on the galactic edge, the attributions of themiddle pillar of the Tree of Life are revealed.Opposite The World through Yesod as we go up the middle pillar is the path ofthe Tarot trump called Art or Temperance, associated with the zodiacal signSagittarius, marker of the center of the galaxy. Thus, our pattern of alignmentsis as complete as on the Tree if we add Art for the center of the galaxy in thenorthwest corner. We are not only marking a moment, but also recapitulating theart of alchemy. The Tarot itself has always contained this insight. The image ofArt, or Temperance, from the very earliest decks has been full of alchemicalmotifs. Some decks have even made the connection explicit by calling the trumpAlchemy.15 [36_endnote-title.html#kkk15]What in the Tarot and on the Tree of Life is a philosophical construct becomes away to calculate a specific moment in time on the Hendaye monument. In this weare reminded of Fulcanelli’s admonition on the short or dry path—“one singlevessel, one single matter, one single furnace”—from his discussion on SaintMarcel’s dragon. Could it be that the short method, the quick transformation, islinked to the quality of time? Does Hendaye record the precise moment when the“dry work” becomes universal or simply happens spontaneously? Could this beFulcanelli’s double catastrophe?Once again the Tree of Life and Tarot attributions provide a clue. The trumpcalled The Blasted Tower, attributed to Mars, and whose symbol is a bolt ofcosmic lightning striking a castle tower, crosses the path of Art/Alchemy. Thisimage of destruction blocks the path to the center of the galaxy, giving supportto the idea of its destructive nature.The Tarot attributions on the Tree of Life thus tell us the major chiliastsecret, that the events at the end of time are also the processes of a universalalchemical transmutation. Art/Alchemy and The Blasted Tower are linked, at rightangles on the Tree, in the same way that the Great Cross of the fall equinox in2002 linked them in the sky, with Mars rising at right angles to the center ofthe galaxy and Saturn. Could this arrangement be a harbinger of Fulcanelli’s“double cataclysm”?Fulcanelli, in the Hendaye chapter, is very careful in his choice of disasterwords. He begins with chiliasm and “millenarism,” two quaint, almost antiquarianterms. Then he uses “cyclic catastrophe” and proceeds quickly to “the Beast ofthe Apocalypse, of the dragon, which on the days of Judgment, spews out fire andbrimstone on macrocosmic creation.” Soon after, in the same paragraph,Fulcanelli makes his only use of the phrase “double cataclysm,” while discussingthe single place of refuge. His care could be taken as a sign that he is warningof something more indefinite than Mevryl’s rock from outer space.Fulcanelli also tells us that the INRI of the upper cross “corresponds to theschematic image of the cycle shown on the base.” This can either be the four A’sor the four images on the base as a whole—the metaphor works for both. The innermeaning of INRI is nature renewed by fire, and its gematria points to theprecessional cycle, which implies a cyclical disaster by means of celestialfire.“Thus,” Fulcanelli continues, “we have two symbolic crosses, both instruments ofthe same torture. Above is the divine cross, exemplifying the chosen means ofexpiation; below is the global cross, fixing the pole of the northern hemisphereand locating the fatal period of this expiation. God the Father holds in hishand this globe, surmounted by this fiery sign.”16 [36_endnote-title.html#kkk16]From our work so far, this is easily understood. When the cross in the sky, thegalactic alignment made by the first two dragon axes, is completed by the crosson earth, the equinox sunrise on the cusp of Leo/Virgo, then the fiery sign willbe seen and the “days of Judgment” will be at hand.The cross will “fix” the North Pole because, on the equinox, the earth’s tilt,which causes the seasons, will be at the balance point, its “fixed” standstill.And this does in fact locate the “fatal period,” with September 22, 2002, theequinox of the Great Cross, as the midway point of the period. Fulcanelliinsists that our hemisphere will be tried by fire, in the same way that fire isused to separate gold from its impurities. In the rest of the chapter, he givesus no further clues to the disaster he is predicting, except that only the elitewill survive.When we assemble Fulcanelli’s clues we find that we are looking for a cycliccatastrophe that is timed to the equinox intersections of the precessional GreatYear. It will be a double catastrophe in which the northern hemisphere will betried or destroyed by fire, seemingly from the mouth of the dragon, or thecenter of the galaxy. The deepest secret of the mysteries, from Isis to theTarot trump Art/Alchemy, has been the location of the center of the galaxy.Even more curious is the fact that Pope Sylvester’s Chroniclers, with theblessing of the Fatimid caliph, established the Order of Our Lady of Zion onMount Zion at the fall equinox of 1002. One thousand years before the Day ofJudgment predicted by the ancient illuminated astronomy and rediscovered by thealchemist pope, that same pope founded an order in Jerusalem that would havefar-reaching effects on the history of the next millennium. Pope Sylvester wasplanning on creating the millennium of peace, ending in the chiliast paradise ofthe New Jerusalem. Like so many other millenarian visionaries before and since,he began with the historical Jerusalem, his influence provoking firstpilgrimages and then the Crusades to control the earthly location of theheavenly kingdom.Pope Sylvester is the link between the lost wisdom of the ancient world and themonotheistic gnosticism that grew out of it and the Gothic age and ItalianRenaissance out of which our modern world developed. With Fulcanelli’s help, itis possible to see the entire current, going back at least two millennia toAlexandrian Egypt. From “Isis the Prophetess” and the gnosticism of the emergingpopular religions, to the family groups of Islam and Judaism and the solitaryphilosophers of the West, down to Pope Sylvester, the Templars, and the buildersof the cathedrals, on through the underground centuries of alchemists andRosicrucians, to its twentieth-century explication by Fulcanelli, the currentretained its coherence.The cross at Hendaye, a true monument to the end of time, demonstrates how tocalculate the traditional date of the Day of Judgment. It points to a veryspecific date, the fall equinox of 2002, and, by Champagne’s implication, aspecific place, the paws of the Sphinx on the Giza plateau. Interestinglyenough, the Great Pyramid, another mysterious monument at Giza, is thought tocontain a prophetic design in its passages and Grand Gallery that ended onSeptember 17, 2001.17 [36_endnote-title.html#kkk17] This is exactly one year andfive days before the Hendaye date, which is the time period required to preparefor the transition from pharaoh to a living star in Orion according to thePyramid texts.18 [36_endnote-title.html#kkk18]Keeping in mind Jesus’ admonition that no one knows the exact day or hour of theJudgment, we might think the monument’s exactness to be presumptuous at theleast. Fulcanelli, however, gives us another clue with his use of phrases suchas “days of Judgment,” and “fatal period.” The exact date derived from themonument is a marker to an apocalyptic season. The easiest way to identify atime period by one date is to choose the midpoint. This is logical enough, sincean equinox itself is a midpoint in so many ways.If September 22, 2002, is the middle of the season, then how do we identify thebeginning and the end, or culmination? If we think of the XX on the upper crossas meaning twenty years, in addition to referring to trump XX and the twentiethcentury, then we have an acceptable period on either side of our target date.Strangely enough, this brings our monument into line with two vast systems ofcounting time from opposite ends of the planet, the Mayan calendar and theTibetan Kalachakra, or Wheel of Time. It also solves the remaining problems ofthe monument’s design.The Tibetan Kalachakra contains a prophecy indicating that 860 years after itsintroduction into Tibet, which happened in 1127, the conditions would befulfilled for a twenty-five-year period that would culminate in the appearanceof the Tibetan version of New Jerusalem, the hidden city of Shambhala.19[36_endnote-title.html#kkk19] Eight hundred sixty years after 1127 is 1987, andtwenty-five years after that is 2012. These dates are also significant invarious versions of the Mayan calendar.The Harmonic Convergence, José Arguelles’s attempt at a global New Agecoming-out party in 1987, was billed as a significant date in the Mayancalendar. While this is debatable in terms of the traditional Mayan calendricalsystem—a better choice would have been 1992, the beginning of the last katun, ortwenty-year period—it does mark the significant moment when the eschatologicalcalendars of these widely separated cultures began to synchronize.September 22, 2002, falls on the midpoint of this last Mayan katun, 13 Reed and20 Ahau, calculated from the summer solstice of 1992 to the winter solstice of2012. While this is a nice fit, and a confirmation that all of these systems areworking from the same ancient traditions, the question is, Can we find thisseason on the monument at Hendaye?So far, our interpretation of the base has been more concerned with the cornersand their alignments and attributions than with the faces of the base. We haveused their Tarot images to calculate the attributions that led us to our targetdate. We found that date displayed in the Saint Andrew’s cross of the uppercross, a symbol for the equinox alignment. The upright square cross, known, asHewitt informed us, as the cross of Saint George (see fig. 11.15), is alsodisplayed by the opposition of the east/west and north/south faces. The SaintGeorge cross is traditionally used to mark the solstice alignments. Theeight-armed cross, the Templar cross, is the combination of the two. Since ourinterpretation of the Hendaye cross evolves it into this same eight-sidedfigure, the unavoidable suggestion is that our equinox cross is the midpointbetween two solstice events.image [images/image350-00.jpg]Figure 11.15. A selection of different crosses showing how they relate to theeight-rayed star.Looking at the monument, we find that the sun and the star are paired, as arethe moon and the four A’s. Since each member of the pairs is found on oppositesides of the monument, we might think of them as being in opposition. Anotherway to see it is to think of the base as transparent so that the images are inconjunction. Actually, as we shall see, either way works because what isconjunct on one solstice is in opposition on the other. The problem lies inidentifying the star and the four A’s.We must discard both Venus and Sirius as candidates for the star. While a summersolstice alignment is possible with both, neither fits our dates. Such analignment happens every year with Sirius, too often to be a marker of anysingular celestial event, and Venus was behind the sun for the summer solsticeof 1992 and will be in front of the sun for the winter solstice of 2012. Thestar, therefore, cannot be either of these. The sun, however, does relate to thecenter of the galaxy in the right pattern. It rises in opposition on the summersolstice and in conjunction on the winter solstice during this period, becomingexact on the winter solstice of 2012, the end point of the Mayan calendar.If we think of Fulcanelli’s image of the dragon’s mouth, the center of thegalaxy, spewing out flame and light, then the star might just relate to aneruption from the galactic center. Coupled with the angry sun face, this mightalso be a clue to the “double cataclysm.” The starlike disturbance from thecenter of the galaxy might trigger a reaction in our own sun, hence Fulcanelli’sinsistence on a “double” catastrophe.If the star is a representation of the center of the galaxy, then what is themeaning of the four A’s? Since this image depicts the great cycle of time, itmight also stand for the main alignment point of the cycle, the galactic center.In that case, the moon would also be in opposition or conjunction on thesolstices. And this was, in fact, the case.Standing again on Giza between the paws of the Sphinx, we note that on themorning of the summer solstice, June 21, 1992, there was a partial lunar eclipsein Scorpio, in opposition to the rising sun in Taurus/Gemini. This is thestarting point of our twenty-year countdown, and matches the moon–four A’salignment on the Hendaye cross, even to the partial eclipse of the moon face.Even better is the winter solstice, December 21, 2012, when the sun rises inperfect alignment with the center of the galaxy on the cusp ofScorpio/Sagittarius, while the moon sets on the cusp of Taurus/Gemini. On thesummer solstice at the beginning of our apocalyptic season, the moon wasconjunct the center of the galaxy and the sun was in opposition. On the wintersolstice, the end point of the period, the sun will be conjunct the galacticcenter and the moon will be in opposition. Thus the solstice alignments, asrevealed on the Hendaye monument, act as brackets or bookends to our midpoint ofSeptember 22, 2002, defining a twenty-year period as the season of apocalypse.We have now answered our third question from chapter 1[11_chapter-title-3.html]: “What do the symbolic images and ciphers on the crossmean? How are they ‘the rarest symbolic translation’ of an apocalypticphilosophy?” And, most important of all, “Do they suggest a date?” We haveunraveled the meaning of the images on the cross and now understand how, intruth, they are the “rarest symbolic translations” of an ancient astronomy.While our answers are somewhat disturbing, they do at least make astronomicalsense.They also raise more questions. How did Pope Sylvester know about the center ofthe galaxy, and about its millennial anniversary? For that matter, how did thedesigner of the Hendaye cross or even Fulcanelli know? The galactic core was notofficially discovered until 1917, and yet they, as well as the Maya and theTibetans, clearly knew. Fulcanelli is at his most simple and truthful when hetells us that the unknown sculptor of the monument “possessed real and profoundknowledge of the universe.”THE PHILOSOPHER’S STONE AND THE QUALITY OF TIMEAfter decoding the cross at Hendaye, we found ourselves on the horns of adilemma. On the one hand, we could be fairly certain that we were readingFulcanelli and the monument’s message correctly. On the other hand, there seemedto be no way its message could be true. The end of the world has been predictedmany times before, and since those predictions have failed to come true, whywould the prophecy encoded in the Hendaye cross be any different? If the end iscoming, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy based on our capacity to destroyourselves. Cosmology would seem to have little to do with it.And yet Fulcanelli insists that it does. His suggestion that alchemy andchiliasm are connected led us to the Gnostic concept of the Great Return of thelesser lights to the Light and its origin in the illuminated astronomy of theBahir. According to tradition, this ancient science derived from Abraham’scovenant with the God Most High, the El in the sky. As we saw above, Abraham wasrevered as the greatest astronomer of his age, drawing on the wisdom of Egyptand India.20 [36_endnote-title.html#kkk20]From the Bahir, the Bible, and surviving esoteric fragments from groups such asthe Golden Dawn, we can reconstruct the major points of this astronomicalperspective. Space was envisioned as a cube within a sphere. The equator of thatsphere was the sun’s apparent path through the constellations of the zodiac. Asshown in figure 11.16, the cube was positioned so that its vertical edgesintersect the cusps of Sagittarius/Scorpio, Gemini/Taurus, Pisces/Aquarius, andVirgo/Leo. Above the cube, in the top portion of the sphere, the constellationof Draco coils about the still point of the north ecliptic pole. This El in thesky was antiquity’s High God, with the planets hanging from its coils. The southecliptic pole of the sphere rests on the brilliance of the Lesser MagellanicCluster.image [images/image353-00.jpg]Figure 11.16. The alignment of the Cubes of Space, solar cube inside the largegalactic cube. Draco sits enthroned above the Cubes, which rests on the back ofthe “turtle” of the Lesser Magellanic Cloud.This eternally unmoving axis was thought to be the middle pillar of a vast Treeof Life in the world of action. Kabbalistic theory suggested, however, that ifthere was one Tree in a world, there should also be a reflection of all fourTrees in the multiverse. The Bahir addressed this by implying a projected,jewel-like Tree that covered the surface of the sphere. The center point of thesphere, our sun in the Tiferet position, would then be projected outward ontothe edges of the cube to form four interlocking trees, as shown in figure 11.17.This arrangement also gives us the basis for the Four Ages. The sun’sprecessional alignment with these projected Tiferet centers is the transitionpoint between ages. Each time the equinox or solstice crosses one of thesepoints in the 26,000-year precessional cycle, the earth enters a new age. Butour illuminated astronomy also provides us with two more Teli, or dragon axes.These can be seen as the “snake” of the Milky Way and the “snake” of theplanetary equator formed by the wobble of the earth’s tilt. The snake or dragonof the Milky Way crosses the solar ecliptic in the northwest atScorpio/Sagittarius and in the southeast at Taurus/Gemini, both Tiferet corners.The equatorial snake of the planet, however, controlled by the precessionalwobble, moves its equinox point on the ecliptic one degree counterclockwiseapproximately every seventy-two years. Thus, those moments when the snakes makeright angles or direct conjunctions with each other determine the quality oftime for that age.image [images/image354-00.jpg]Figure 11.17. Projecting the Tree of Life onto a sphere.The event, which gave Abram his insight into the nature of time, which was thewindow of the letter heh needed to spell Abraham, was his covenant with God. Atthis event, we are told in Genesis, a fiery torch passed through the alignmentof sacrifices from the northwest to the southeast, an alignment preserved tothis day by the location of the Black Stone in the cube or Kaaba of Mecca. Thisline from the north-west to the southeast corner is the galactic axis, ofcourse. Abraham’s covenant represents a shift from the High God of the El to anew hidden god controlling the temporal quality of the galactic axis and itsalignments. This God, unlike the placid and benign El, could become angry anddispense judgment and destruction.This God promised Abraham that his descendants would become as the stars, butwhether in number or quality is uncertain. The chiliast promise also lay at theheart of the hidden God’s covenant. Just as He could dispense judgment, so toocould He dispense transformation— Inshallah, “as God wills it,” as a Muslimwould say.Now, let us imagine this astronomical object, this sphered cube or “stone of thewise,” from the outside. As in figure 11.17, we see twenty-two circles(twenty-six if we include Daat) on the surface of a sphere that contains a cubeformed from the intersection of the three planes generated by the dragon axes.On each plane is a Tree of Life, joined at the center of the sphere. This breaksthe sphered cube into eight cells, each of which has three faces reflectingoutward from the central Tiferet point. From this arrangement we can see thatthe astronomical “Stone of the Wise” is also a depiction of a tesseract (seefig. 11.18), a four-dimensional or hypercube with 8 cells, 16 vertices, 24faces, and 32 edges. Note within this the geometric progression (8, 16, 32) ofthe star and the sun on the Hendaye cross.image [images/image356-00.jpg]Figure 11.18. A four-dimensional hypercube, or tesseract.As noted before, the cross at Hendaye is an exploded or schematic view of thisphilosopher’s stone in the heavens. This is easy to see by simply collapsing thecross into the space of the pedestal, as in figure 11.19. The pillar folds inalong the northwest–southeast axis, with the two arms of the upper cross formingthe other two axes. Think of these as plane surfaces with Tree of Life patternson them and we have the Precious Stone of the Wise from the Bahir.The images on the three-dimensional surface of our pedestal-cube act asinformational markers telling us how to align our hypercube to predict thequality of time in our age. As we saw above, this alignment involves theprecessional equinox cross of Leo on the fall equinox combined with solsticemarkers that include the heliacal rising of the hidden God of the galacticcenter with the winter solstice sunrise. Our Bahiric philosopher’s stonesuggests that this season in time is one of great transformation, perhaps eventhe Day of Judgment alignment prefigured by Abraham’s sacrifices.Our Precious Stone of the Wise becomes even more curious when we consider thatthere are stars in each of the twenty-two or twenty-six circles on the surfaceof the celestial sphere. By using the most prominent star closest to the centerof each circle, we can create a unique intergalactic distance/density zip codefor our local solar system. If we had set out to design a system that tells usthe specific quality of time in a specific locality of space, it is hard toimagine anything more simple and efficient than this apparently ancientperspective.image [images/image357-00.jpg]Figure 11.19.

Collapsed Hendaye cross showing, in 3D, the structures of the “Stone of theWise.”This information survived purges and persecutions until someone coded it instone in the late seventeenth century at Hendaye. Even then the informationwasn’t lost; it was merely rediscovered in the nineteenth century and revealedto the public in the twentieth by Fulcanelli. When the Hendaye chapter waspublished in 1957, however, less than fifty years remained until the firstprecessional marker. Perhaps this was part of the plan, because only in the lastfifty years or so has science caught up with Abraham the patriarch’s level ofunderstanding.Now, with our chiliast season identified, we turn our attention to science. Isthere any evidence connecting a cyclic, precessional-based catastrophe with thecenter of the galaxy? Could an asteroid swarm or a comet also be somehowinvolved, as Mevryl suggests? And most important of all, does the Hendaye crosstruly point to a “place of refuge”?"},{"pageContent":"TWELVECATASTROPHE AND REFUGEimage [images/image359-00.jpg]COSMIC SUPERIMPOSITION: WILHELM REICH, ORGONE, ANDTHE CENTER OF THE GALAXYEven though the center of the galaxy wasn’t officially discovered until 1917,any primitive culture watching the skies would quickly discern that there wassomething special in that direction. The Milky Way, the heavenly Nile, bulgesjust where the sun’s ecliptic crosses it (fig. 12.1).image [images/image359-01.jpg]Figure 12.1. The Milky Way crosses the sun’s ecliptic at its widest andnarrowest points, the center and edge of the galaxy, which suggests some kind ofradial flow, from center to edge, that causes this precise alignment.At the other ecliptic crossing, the Milky Way looks thin and wispy, as if it isfading away. From this observation, we can see why this axis is described as adragon or a snake, complete with the Pleiades as the snake’s rattle. The suncrosses these points twice a year, but the precessional axis, marked by thesun’s equinoxes or solstices, crosses these points only twice in a precessionalGreat Year.One question for which the modern astronomer or cosmologist has no answer is whythe ecliptic crosses the Milky Way at just those specific points (fig. 12.2).There seems to be no astrophysical reason why the ecliptic should intersect theplane of the Galaxy, the Milky Way, along its radial axis. It could as likely beat a right angle to that axis, or even more likely parallel to it so that theMilky Way matches the solar ecliptic. Yet, there it is, a cosmic synchronicitythat suggests that some energy or magnetic “force” flowing from the center ofthe Galaxy, so womblike to the ancients, shapes our Cube of Space-time so thatits long-term temporal quality, and perhaps even the evolution of life itself,is somehow related to its alignment along the radial axis of the Galaxy.image [images/image360-00.jpg]Figure 12.2. The alignment of the ecliptic, the solar cube of space and thegalactic meridian. Note that the ecliptic crosses the galactic meridian at theedge, as shown, and at the center. The Southern Cross points to the galacticcenter crossing point.But looking for subtle forces emanating from the center of the Galaxy that arecapable of aligning the solar ecliptic takes us far away from mainstreamastrophysics. One of the only thinkers who seemed to entertain anything close toour hypothesis was the radical psychoanalyst and biophysicist Wilhelm Reich. InCosmic Superimposition, published in 1951, Reich developed his theory of sexualtension and release into a cosmological hypothesis based on the interaction ofspinning systems. This superimposition of spin, in Reich’s view, creates matterand gravity, implying a steady-state or constant-creation model of the universe.Reich postulates that this constant superimposition of orgonic creation going onin the galactic core generates a radially flowing orgone stream that organizesthe location and coherence of the solar systems of the galaxy. He suggests thatthe image of a spiral galaxy, such as ours, is the “most impressive picture ofcosmic superimposition.” After coming very close to uncovering the Abrahamicastronomy of ecliptic alignments we described in chapter 4[15_chapter-title-6.html], Reich concluded: “The ecliptic, accordingly, would bethe result of a pull exerted upon the planetary system by the galactic Orgoneenergy stream, making its course deviate from the equatorial plane by 23.5degrees.”1 [36_endnote-title.html#lll1] He even goes so far as to declare thatthis cosmic orgone energy stream causes all gravitational effects.Reich defines orgone as the “primordial cosmic energy; universally present anddemonstrable visually, thermically, electroscopically, and by means ofGeiger-Müller counters.” In living bodies orgone is the “biological energy.”This suggests that Reich was close to the alchemical secret on an energeticlevel. Alchemy lurks just around the edges of his words in CosmicSuperimposition, but never quite emerges as a subject.But he was close, on several levels. “Orgone” sounds a little like the “Force”of the Star Wars films, but the description has the virtue of explaining anastronomical fact that modern astrodynamics seems reluctant to face. But assupport for our hypothesis, and in providing an origin for the catastrophe,Reich’s work, brilliant as it is, fell far short of our needs.MESSAGES FROM MANY SOURCESAs we worked on this book, answers and suggestions about certain portions of themystery kept emerging spontaneously from other researchers. The importance ofthe center of the Galaxy, and our alignment to it, is one of the best examplesof this synchronicity. We knew of the significance of the galactic centerthrough our connection with Moira Timms’s work on the Djed pillar, throughSantillana and von Dechend’s book Hamlet’s Mill, and through Terence and DennisMcKenna’s The Invisible Landscape. But in the summer of 1996, several peoplepublished articles or presented papers on the upcoming Great Cross of theequinoxes and galactic center in the years from 1998 to 2002. While none ofthese perspectives fit our Hendaye framework, or explained its importance, theidea was part of the cultural zeitgeist.Around this same time, John Major Jenkins, one of the foremost scholars of theMayan calendrical system, began to suggest in various articles that the end dateof the Mayan calendar, the winter solstice of 2012, was chosen because of itsprecise alignment of the galactic center with the rising sun. The Mayanastronomers, as Jenkins has demonstrated, have much to tell us about our ancientphilosopher’s stone cosmology. While Jenkins’s work supports our thematicinterpretation of the ancient astronomical vision, he had no better suggestionthan Reich about the catastrophe itself.In “The Message of the Maya End Date,” the last chapter in his Maya Cosmogenesis2012, Jenkins asks the question: “What does the 2012 alignment mean for humanbeings on earth?” He tries to answer this by pointing to another factor involvedin this rare precessional conjunction.The Galaxy’s equator is the center of the Milky Way itself, and by 2012 thesolstice meridian will have crossed over this galactic equator. Jenkinspostulates that the earth’s equator delineates distinct field-effect propertiescommon to all spinning bodies. Water in a drain, the spin of tornadoes, andhurricanes flow in opposite directions in each hemisphere. So too does theGalaxy. That would make the period from 1998, when the solstice meridian hitsthe exact center of the galaxy, and 2012, its heliacal rising, a sort offield-effect null zone, “much like the calm eye of a hurricane,” Jenkins tellus, which “balances the surrounding chaos.” Jenkins calls the shift afield-effect energy reversal.2 [36_endnote-title.html#lll2]He doesn’t predict any catastrophes from this energy reversal, but insteadfocuses on the psychological aspect. Jenkins sees the “2012 field-reversal as amoment in which the human spirit can emerge from unconscious patterns andblossom.” He mentions the idea of a literal pole shift, so beloved of New Agedoomsayers, but weighs in as leaning toward a pole shift in our collectivepsyche. He ends the chapter with a reference to ancient cultures such as theMagdalenian in eastern Europe 19,000 years ago, but refuses to speculate on whathappened to end that Golden Age.Ultimately we are convinced by his work that the Maya believed that this pointmarked a change significant enough to be called the zero point of time, but weare left wondering about the mechanism involved. If the Maya were simplyextrapolating myth onto a celestial background, then it is possible that theastronomical indications alone were enough to define an end point. This approachignores, however, the subtlety and sophistication of the cosmology itself. It isnot just describing the flow of events in the sky; it is trying to interpretthose events down here on earth. As Jenkins points out, the 260-day Mayan shortcount, based on the human gestation period, is also a factor of the precessional26,000-year cycle. As above, so below, even in human evolution. But, as always,the question is the mechanism.By the time Jenkins’s Maya Cosmogenesis 2012 appeared in the summer of 1998, ourresearch was approaching critical mass. His conclusions, coupled with TerenceMcKenna’s Time Wave Zero research (based on the trigrams of the I Ching andwhich also pointed to an end date of 2012), suggested that our interpretation ofthe Hendaye cross was closer to the truth than we had imagined. There seemed tobe some connection, at the level of cosmology, between all of these ideastreams. The astro-alchemical meme began to look more and more like a survivorfrom some prehistoric global civilization.And if that was the case, then we were looking for a catastrophe, one so largethat there must be some evidence of it left. Graham Hancock, in hisgroundbreaking work Fingerprints of the Gods, presented a catalog of cataclysmicevents, and concluded that some sort of upheaval and flood occurred around13,000 years ago. While he doesn’t speculate on the cause of the cataclysm—whichin his view resulted in a massive shift of the earth’s crust—he does suggestthat it is somehow related to the precessional cycle and its cosmic clock.3[36_endnote-title.html#lll3] Hancock’s perspective on this cosmic clockwork,however, is lacking a few key elements.He focuses on precession as the movement of the celestial pole while ignoringthe ecliptic pole. He emphasizes the celestial mill and its grinding withoutever identifying the point around which it circles. Having missed the importanceof the ecliptic pole in defining an unmoving axis, he is also unclear about thesignificance of the ecliptic crossing points on the Milky Way and thus missesthe importance of the galactic alignments.He does, however, confirm our notion that the catastrophe, whatever its cause,destroyed an advanced global civilization. He even speculates on secretsocieties: “If the circumstances were right it seems possible that the essenceof the cult (the secret of the catastrophe’s timing) might survive, carriedforward by a nucleus of determined men and women.”4 [36_endnote-title.html#lll4]Their objective would have been to preserve this knowledge for a futurecivilization facing the same event. We have seen how the Bahir’s philosopher’sstone and the cross at Hendaye function as just such devices for preserving thesecret.Still, a few pieces were missing. What caused the catastrophe? And could thatdisaster be related to the core transmutational process of alchemy? We had foundthat historically they were interconnected, but just how it worked was stillelusive. The secret of alchemy and the secret of the double catastrophe, as wewould learn from Paul LaViolette, are based on the same physics of creation.EARTH UNDER FIRE: THE DOUBLE CATASTROPHE REVEALEDWe met Paul LaViolette at a conference in Boulder, Colorado. He was scheduled totalk about his big bang theories, which, because of their suggestion of apossible scientific model for the alchemical process, were of interest to us. Wealso knew that LaViolette had determined the importance of the galactic centerand had speculated on the nature of the catastrophe that ended the ancientglobal culture. We were shocked to find, however, that in the course of aninety-minute presentation, LaViolette apparently solved the problem presentedby Fulcanelli’s prediction of a double cataclysm.Riveted to our seats, we listened as LaViolette ticked off possible solutions toone after another of our remaining problems. Why was the galactic-crossalignment of Leo/Aquarius and Scorpio/Taurus so important to the builders of theHendaye cross and the Gothic cathedrals? LaViolette shows how this alignmentpinpoints galactic microwave hotspots and how the ancients used this informationto assign planetary qualities to the signs of zodiac, thus giving us the firstcoherent explanation for a very esoteric system of attributions.How did the ancient scientists know the location of the exact center of thegalaxy? LaViolette suggested that perhaps it was much brighter because it wasactively erupting. By the end of the lecture, we were somewhat in shock.LaViolette’s new book, Earth Under Fire, suddenly became the book of answers,and the question of Fulcanelli’s warning attained a new level of significance.What had up to then been speculation on our part about an esoteric eschatologybecame a specific cataclysmic scenario with none of the vagueness of notionsabout disruptions in the orgone flow or galactic-equator field reversal.LaViolette, it seemed, had penetrated the alchemical meme to its core and seenthe double cataclysm pointed out by Fulcanelli and the cross at Hendaye.LaViolette’s Earth Under Fire opens where his previous book, Beyond the BigBang, left off, with an examination of the zodiacal cipher in the sky and awarning of a galactic core explosion. LaViolette points out the importance ofthe four fixed signs, Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius, and how, in therearranged creation pattern, these are the only signs that retain their locationon the ecliptic. He notes that Leo and Aquarius, which are opposite each otherin the zodiac, “appear to be indicating a temperature polarity in space.” Hepoints to the traditional attribution of the Sun to Leo and Saturn to Aquariusas indications of this temperature gradient, the Sun of course being very hotand Saturn very cold.He goes on to discover that the attributions of the planets to the signs and toparts of the body also follow this temperature pattern (see fig. 12.3).LaViolette speculates that “since the lore of astrology redundantly encodesessentially the same Leo-Aquarius temperature bias using entirely unrelated setsof symbols (planets and body parts), we are led to conclude that these symbolsystems are being used to call attention to the temperature gradient featuresthat both share.”5 [36_endnote-title.html#lll5]This is truly amazing when we consider that the microwave background radiationcoming from deep space has precisely this kind of temperature gradient runningacross the heavens from the hot pole near Leo to the cold pole near Aquarius. Itis almost as if there were a microwave “sun” in the direction of Leo.The University of California at Berkeley team that discovered this temperaturegradient in 1977 concluded, however, that it was produced by the solar system’smotion toward the region of Leo. Because of our system’s orbital motion aroundthe galactic center, and the galaxy’s bulk motion through space, we are movingtoward Leo at a speed that is twelve times that of our orbital motion. Theprecessional rising of Leo on the equinox, then, becomes a measure of alignmentwith the motion of the galactic spin.image [images/image366-00.jpg]Figure 12.3. A. A sky map showing the temperature gradient of the universe; thehottest spots are near the constellation Leo. B. The relationships among thezodiacal signs, the temperature gradient, and the parts of the body. From PaulLaViolette, Earth Under Fire (New York: Starburst Publications, 1997)But what of the Scorpio/Taurus alignment? LaViolette argues that the symbolismof Scorpio and Sagittarius not only locates the galactic center but alsopinpoints it as the place of continuous matter/energy creation, and thereforethe possible source of a catastrophic energy outburst, the sting, as it were, ofthe Scorpion (fig. 12.4). Such galactic outbursts have been the subject ofspeculation since Edwin Hubbell demonstrated that spiral nebulae were actuallydistant galaxies. In the 1960s, evidence emerged suggesting that the core of agalaxy could shine brighter than all the stars in the galaxy itself. CalledSeyfert galaxies after their discoverer Carl Seyfert, some have been known toshine more than 100,000 times brighter than the center of our own galaxy. Onaverage, one in five to seven galaxies is observed to be a Seyfert type.6[36_endnote-title.html#lll6]image [images/image367-00.jpg]Figure 12.4. LaViolette’s map showing the constellations of Scorpio andSagittarius as they appeared in the distant past. The trajectory of the archer’sarrow shows that it would have intersected the galactic center 15,000 years ago.(From LaViolette, Earth Under Fire)“Astronomers have come to realize,” LaViolette tells us, “that galactic coreexplosions occur in all spiral galaxies, even in our own, and that the majorityof galaxies that have a normal appearance with no sign of core activity aresimply galaxies whose cores happen to be in their quiescent phase. Thestatistics suggest that a galaxy core resides in this quiescent phase about 80to 85 percent of the time. It spends the other 15 to 20 percent of the time inan active state, with eruptive episodes lasting from hundreds to severalthousands of years.”7 [36_endnote-title.html#lll7] In this sense, galaxies go onand off like the blinking lights of a Christmas tree.The current black-hole model of the galactic core has difficulty accounting forthese explosive episodes. Black holes consume matter and rarely eject it inexplosive bursts as seen in Seyfert galaxies. Even a naked singularity, a rareblack hole capable of emitting radiation, would be hard-pressed to match theenergy output of Seyfert galaxies or quasars. LaViolette points out that modernradio-astronomy observations of the galactic core region reveal an object thatacts more like a massive “mother star” than a black hole. The collapsinggravitational force, which causes a black hole, seems to be balanced by theoutpouring of newly created matter and energy from within the supermassive starbody, as predicted in subquantum kinetics. This model also predicts that thebalance could at times become unstable, resulting in an explosive discharge ofenergy from the super massive core.8 [36_endnote-title.html#lll8]Something as basic as a galactic core explosion in the relatively recent pastshould be easy to confirm with our modern astronomical instruments. And indeed,we find plenty of evidence for recent galactic core eruptions. Astronomers havefound that gas clouds are moving radially outward from the galactic core likesmoke rings from a central explosion.9 [36_endnote-title.html#lll9] A lumpycloud of molecular gas five light-years out from the galactic center shows signsof massive disruption in the last 10,000 to 100,000 years, as if the centralfive light-years had been swept clean of interstellar dirt by an explosion.Farther out, around ten to twenty light-years, astronomers have found a literalsmoke ring of oxygenenriched gas propelled outward by a galactic core explosionless than 50,000 years ago. Even farther out is a cloud of molecular gasexpanding outward at the rate of 150 kilometers per second. Astronomer Jan Oortestimated that it takes the force of 100,000 supernovas to propel this cloud outfrom the central core of the galaxy.These pieces of evidence suggest that the microwave background radiation throughwhich the sun is traveling in the direction of Leo was caused by the explosivewaves of cosmic rays and gas clouds from the galactic center. Suddenly, theancient cross of the fixed signs makes perfect sense. The first “beam” on thecross, Scorpio/Taurus, indicates the flow of the radial superwaves from the coreexplosions, and the other, Leo/Aquarius, indicates our solar system and planet’sangular momentum to that flow. Our Bahiric philosopher’s stone and the cross atHendaye demonstrate these principles on a symbolic level.LaViolette’s galactic explosion hypothesis can be summarized in four broadpoints: 1. Periodically, the core of our galaxy enters an explosive phase during which it generates an intense outburst of cosmic-ray particles equivalent to several million supernovas. 2. These outbursts recur roughly every 10,000 years or so, and last for several hundred to several thousand years. 3. Some types of cosmic-ray particles generated in a core explosion, the electrons and positrons, travel radially outward at close to the speed of light. Others, the protons, lag behind the electron front and are mostly absorbed by the magnetic fields in the magnetic nucleus. 4. A superwave of cosmic-ray particles passed through the solar system toward the end of the Ice Age, injecting large amounts of cosmic dust into the system. This dust affected the sun and substantially affected the climate on earth, bringing on the sudden end of the Ice Age.The galactic superwave, composed of superhot cosmic-ray particles traveling atclose to the speed of light, would appear from Earth as a brilliant blue-whitespot of light—about the size of Mars—in Sagittarius, surrounded by a slightlylarger and less bright halo. This source, perhaps as much as a thousand timesbrighter than any other star, would be visible even in daylight.LaViolette equates this new “sun” with the Hopi legends of Saquasohuh, the bluestar spirit, and the Egyptian legends of Sekhmet, the all-destroying Eye of Re.It would remain in the sky as a second sun, or the sun behind the sun, for aslong as a millennium, as a herald of catastrophe. Although the energy of thisoutburst is enough to affect electromagnetic systems on earth and produceweather changes, the real danger is the effect on the cloud of cosmic dustsurrounding our solar system. According to LaViolette, the superwave will pushmassive amounts of dust into our solar system, with disastrous consequences (seefig. 12.5).10 [36_endnote-title.html#lll10]This cosmic dust storm would begin to cause problems as it entered the solarsystem. At first the cloud of dust would block the sunlight and make the earth’ssurface very cold. Soon, however, a new problem would begin as the earth cooledrapidly.Astronomers have noted that there are stars affected by large amounts of cosmicdust falling onto their surfaces, called T-Tauri stars. As the dust falls ontothe surfaces of these stars it becomes heated and causes the skin of the star tobrighten. This dust eventually forms around the star a cocoon that holds in theheat and causes the temperature of the star’s corona to rise rapidly. Thisheating causes huge solar flares to appear on the surface of these T-Tauristars. LaViolette postulates that this same event occurred with our own sun whenthe cosmic dust storm arrived soon after the blue star. As this dust gatheredand finally settled on the surface of our own sun, it would also cause the sunto heat up, producing massive solar flares into the surrounding space.11[36_endnote-title.html#lll11]image [images/image370-00.jpg]Figure 12.5. Superwave-induced cosmic-dust invasion can produce varyingcatastrophic results. (From LaViolette, Earth Under Fire)This solar activity and these flares would begin to have an effect on theweather here on earth. After the initial cooling period—brought on by the influxof dust—the sun would suddenly become very hot. A cocoon of cosmic dust and hotgases would gather around the sun, causing huge solar flares. It is possiblethat the superheated corona could increase in size until it overwhelmed ourplanet. This solar bubble would heat up the earth, causing tropical latitudes tobecome unbearably warm and the ice floes in the north and south polar regions toquickly melt. Lakes of fresh water that had been trapped in the polar glacierswould unleash their contents. These glacier waves would race down from the northand south polar ice sheets and drown and destroy all life in their deadly path.This is LaViolette’s explanation for the end of the Ice Age. Thousands of animalcorpses have been found frozen in the wilderness of Alaska and Siberia. Theyseem to have been deposited there about 13,000 years ago at the end of thePleistocene era. Hundreds of thousands of these animals died suddenly andinexplicably, including woolly mammoths, giant tree sloths, Arctic foxes, andmany others. Their bodies are distributed in such a way as to indicate that theydied from a violent influx of water. The bodies were then flushed down therivers, collecting in gullies and ravines, until they were frozen in the coldthat would return quickly after the bubble of hot gases from the sundisappeared. Hundreds of species did go extinct at the end of the Ice Age, aboutthat there is no argument.With astronomers openly admitting that galactic core explosions are highlyprobable, it is difficult to argue against LaViolette’s explanation. LaVioletteis saying that he has found proof of a catastrophe in the past that nearlydestroyed all life on our planet. He is also saying that this catastrophe was ofa “double” nature. The initial outburst from the galactic core causedelectromagnetic shifts on earth, which may have caused crustal torque, poleshifts, tidal waves, and high winds. This first catastrophe wasfollowed—sometime later—by an explosion of the sun’s corona, caused by theinflux of cosmic dust pushed by the galactic superwave. It was, in fact, justwhat Fulcanelli had said it would be, a double catastrophe.In one fell swoop LaViolette had answered many of the questions that had hauntedus as researchers. Amazingly, LaViolette had never heard of Fulcanelli, and kneweven less about alchemy. He was a true modern scientist who wanted empiricalproof for any thesis. And he had spent thirty years proving the very sameinformation that had been engraved on the cross of Hendaye.Perhaps the most convincing of all of LaViolette’s evidence is the informationprovided by a radio contour map of a supernova remnant in Cassiopeia A (see fig.12.6). This map, compiled from information published by astronomers Dickel andGreisen, clearly shows the expanded wave front of the supernova impacting thegalactic superwave.12 [36_endnote-title.html#lll12] This distortion showsclearly in X-ray images, indicating a tremendous output of energy from thesuperwave’s shock front. This also suggests that the galactic superwave mighteven be a factor in making a star into a nova.It is indeed hard to argue with evidence such as this. LaViolette backs up hishypothesis with ice-core samples and cosmic-dust counts—including the 1993Ulysses spacecraft results that conclusively demonstrated that cosmic dust iscurrently entering our system from the direction of the galactic center—andreaches the same conclusion as we have in decoding the cross at Hendaye. Adouble catastrophe happened 13,000 years ago, caused by an eruption ofcosmic-ray energy from the center of the galaxy. Fulcanelli and the cross atHendaye suggest that this catastrophe is about to happen once again. Ice-coresamples show that galactic superwaves pass through our region of space once inabout 26,000 years, or one complete precessional cycle. The galactic coreexplosion may in fact be the mechanism, through a type of gravity wave, thatproduces the precessional effect, the tilt of the planet on its axis, as WihelmReich predicted.image [images/image372-00.jpg]Figure 12.6. Radio contour map of Cassiopeia A. The small central crossrepresents the position of the supernova explosion center.Although LaViolette steers clear of an exact prediction for the next superwavefrom galactic central, he does suggest that there might be a connection with thecoming precessional alignments with the galactic center. He points to the manyprophecies that indicate our immediate future as one of change and upheaval. Thereality of the double catastrophe that he depicts, however, is firmly groundedin hard science, from ice-core samples to radio-telescope observations. Wheneverit arrives, it will be the end of life as we know it.Understanding this, our attention was drawn back to Fulcanelli’s promise thatthe inscription on the cross at Hendaye pointed to a place of refuge during thetime of the double cataclysm. We found that Hendaye did indeed point to a placeof refuge, perhaps one from the last catastrophe. We would also find thatHendaye identified the only reasonable location for Atlantis, the center of thelast global civilization. These discoveries would lead us to the final truthabout alchemy, Fulcanelli, and the Great Cross, both of Hendaye and of thegalaxy.THE INSCRIPTION’S MESSAGE AND THE PLACE OF REFUGEIn the end, the mystery encoded in the cross at Hendaye boils down to themessage contained in the oddly divided Latin inscription. Fulcanelli instructsthe reader that its message concerns a place of refuge from the double cataclysmdescribed by the monument. But how exactly does it tell us this? And does itgive us any clue to where this place of refuge might be located?Everything that Fulcanelli had alleged, regardless of how bizarre it sounded onfirst reading, we found to be based on truth. There seemed no reason to doubtFulcanelli’s word on the inner meaning of the inscription’s message. But in theHendaye chapter, Fulcanelli gives us no clue as to what or where this place ofrefuge might be.He simply informs us that from the inscription “we can learn that a countryexists where death cannot reach man at the terrible time of the doublecataclysm.” It is up to us to find it, implying that the inscription does indeedtell us the “geographical location of this promised land.” Those who find it,Fulcanelli promises, will take up the mission of renewing mankind after thedisaster. Fulcanelli assumes that this elite will be “the children ofElias”—that is, the followers of the astro-alchemical path of transformation. Aswe shall see, this hope may or may not have become reality.With this in mind, let’s take another, closer look at Fulcanelli’s method ofreading the inscription and see what other clues turn up. We are left with theseventeen letters of the inscription—OCRUXAVES / PESUNICA—and Fulcanelli’speculiar comments on it. As mentioned in chapter 11 [25_chapter-title-13.html],he tells us that it is easy to recognize the inscription as the familiarmortuary phrase O Crux Ave Spes Unica, “Hail, O Cross, the Only Hope,” but henotes that this one is different because of the misplaced S. He does not,however, tell us much more about the peculiar rendering of the word spes otherthan to call attention to the incorrect grammar of the second line, even thoughhe knows that including the S on the second line would correct the grammar. Aswe have seen, pes, “foot” or “measure,” can also be related to unica, the word“only,” by transposing the I and the C to form uncia, “the twelfth part.” This“measure of the twelfth part” can be connected to the cycles of the catastrophemeasured by the galactic cross. Fulcanelli is calling attention to thisinterpretation with his fudging about grammar. But he doesn’t say that this isthe reason for the split S; he merely speculates that it was done on purpose.“No doubt,” Fulcanelli elaborates, “our workman traced them first in chalk orcharcoal, and this rough draft must rule out any idea that a mistake occurredduring the actual cutting of the letters. However, since this apparent mistakeexists, it follows that it must really have been intended. The only reason thatI can think of is that it is a sign put in on purpose, concealed under theappearance of an inexplicable blunder, and intended to arouse the curiosity ofthe observer. I will, therefore, state that, in my opinion, it was withknowledge and intent that the author arranged the inscription of his puzzlingwork in this way.”13 [36_endnote-title.html#lll13]Next, Fulcanelli explains something of his method: “I had already beenenlightened by studying the pedestal and knew in what way and by means of whatkey the Christian inscription should be read; but I was anxious to showinvestigators what help may be obtained in solving hidden matters from plaincommon sense, logic and reasoning.”14 [36_endnote-title.html#lll14] In thisenigmatic paragraph, Fulcanelli is posing us a riddle, an intellectual test. Andjust in case we missed it, the reference to the key or cross in the sky made bythe X of the snakes or dragons is, Fulcanelli informs us, “the helicoidal trackof the sun, having arrived at the zenith of its curve across space, at the timeof the cyclic catastrophe.”“The helicoidal track of the sun” is an archaic term for the sun’s precessionalmotion against the ecliptic.15 [36_endnote-title.html#lll15] Helicoidal,literally “shaped like a spiral,” is a description of the ecliptic and the slow“suspended” movement of the earth’s wobble against it. The zenith of its curveacross space is the moment when the solstices cross the galactic axis—the time,according to Fulcanelli, of the cyclic catastrophe.When Leo coincided with the spring equinox 13,000 years ago, aligning the risingsun with the local energy gradient of the solar system’s movement through thecosmic-ray field coming from the center of the galaxy, the summer solstice wasslowly coming into alignment with the opposite end of the galactic axis, ninetydegrees away, in the region of Taurus and the Pleiades. Now, half a precessionalcycle later, Leo rises on the fall equinox as the winter solstice begins itsalignment with the galactic center in Scorpio. As Fulcanelli insists, thecrossing of these dragons creates “the image of the Beast of the Apocalypse, thedragon, which, on the days of Judgment, spews out fire and brimstone onmacrocosmic creation.”16 [36_endnote-title.html#lll16]This knowledge, however, brings us no closer to finding our place of refuge.Fulcanelli simply says that the symbolic value of the S, displaced on purpose,gives us to understand that the phrase must be translated in the secretlanguage. His explanation, though, of how this phrase can be translated in thephonetic language of the birds seems to lack any emphasis on the displaced S. Hetells us to read in French “the Latin just as it is written. Then by making useof the permutation of vowels, we shall be able to read off the new words,forming another sentence, and re-establish the spelling, the word order and theliterary sense.”17 [36_endnote-title.html#lll17]When we do this, Fulcanelli assures us we shall find the sentence “Il est écritque la vie se réfugie en un seul espace,” which can be translated as “It iswritten that life takes refuge in a single space.” Yet we have missed somethingif we take Fulcanelli’s word for it and do not attempt to solve the puzzleourselves.He implies that we are to read the Latin letters as if they were French words.When we do this, certain words pop out at us. “La vie,” or “life,” is easy toderive phonetically from AV, or ah vee, and “espace” is also obviously derivedfrom ESPE, ess pay ee. We can find “écrit” in CRX, eh cree teh, by seeing the Xas a T, and “en un seul” can be found in UNCA, en un say ahh. The I and the Sform the “il est” that begins the sentence. Therefore, we have I S CRX, AV,ESPE, UNCA, or “Il est écrit (que) la vie (se réfugie) en un seul espace.” Thereare two letters left, the O and the U.Curiously, there is no way to make the French word réfugie from this Latinphrase. There is no consonant for the jay sound of réfu-gie. Even if we reusethe R and assign the U to the oo sound, we are left with only part of the word.Fulcanelli emphasizes the displaced S, which falls in the middle of the wordespace, telling us that this is the key to the code. Since refuge is notdirectly attainable from the Latin inscription as it is, we are directed to thedisplaced S and its assignment in this specific case to the Greek letter chi,which is X or K. We can find the place of “refuge,” and restore “the literarysense,” only if we can solve the puzzle of the S that changes into an X and theX that changes into an S.From this, we can see that Jules Boucher in his 1936 article appears tomisunderstand the directions for translating the inscription. He clearly knowsthat it is a phonetic key, but doesn’t follow through on this awareness. Hegives us the French translation of the sound of the Latin words, “O Croix HaveEspace Unique,” or “O Cross, the single pale space.” From the above, the missingjay sound in refuge, it is easy to see how he arrived at this version, but italso shows that he was, perhaps intentionally, far from the mark. Fulcanelliuses similar methods and arrives at a conclusion that leads us deeper into theinscription itself. Boucher thinks the inscription points to the disaster—hechanges croix to mort, or “death,” to make the point—but seems unaware of itspromise of refuge. Or, perhaps, he is unwilling to completely reveal the secret.Our puzzle, then, is to find the place of refuge by changing the S into K, or ahard C sound. This suggests a cryptogramic or anagrammatic process, such as thatproposed by Mevryl in his epilogue to The Fulcanelli Phenomenon. Mevryl’scomplex anagrams, however, are apparently designed to deceive the reader, tomake sure that this sort of wordplay is discredited before anyone actuallyapplies the riddle of changing the S to a K to the inscription itself. First andmost curiously, Mevryl switches the attribution. In his version, X becomes S,not S becomes X or K. This is clearly not what Fulcanelli meant. He tells usthat S corresponds to K, takes over its meaning, in fact, not the other wayaround. At this point, we cannot escape the conclusion that all of ourcommentators, Boucher, Fulcanelli, and Mevyrl, are in on the joke and doingtheir best to both reveal and obscure the message. Fulcanelli is oddly insistenton the K of khi and key, with khi or chi being the Greek letter X. As we shallsee, Fulcanelli is pointing to an even deeper meaning to the idea of “khi/key.”Mevryl’s interpretation of the inscription doesn’t suggest any place of refuge,and his comments on Fulcanelli’s translation indicate that he might notunderstand as much as Boucher, but given the amount Mevryl does know, we canfeel sure this is another dodge. Mevryl tells us that Fulcanelli translated theinscription into French, Boucher’s O Croix Have Espace Unique, and “thentransposed it into the langue diplomatique by means of the rules of diplomacy.”This parroting of Fulcanelli shows that Mevryl either did not understand it orchose to make it incomprehensible. A third option might be that a deeper meaningis implied, and this leads, inevitably, to Mevryl’s use of anagrams.He does suggest that the front paws of the Sphinx mark our observation point,which echoes Champagne’s curious frontispiece to Le Mystère. He notes thatHa’il, in Saudi Arabia, is in the line of sight along the rising sun to the eastfrom the Sphinx and that far beyond it are the Himalayas and the valley ofKathmandu. This, he suggests, is the place of refuge, drawing attention to thecat, man, and hu, or breath, combination found in the name Kathmandu. Thevalleys of Nepal are thought to be places of refuge in the Tibetan tradition,associated with both Padmasambhava and the Kalachakra Tantra, so Mevryl ispointing to a possible connection. His attribution, however, of Cat-Man, orSphinx, and Hu, or breath, as the place of refuge has nothing to do with themessage on the inscription. Once again, as we shall see, Mevryl is toying withus; he is directing the gullible toward a spot that is actually half the worldaway from the place of refuge discernible on the cross.A SIGN POINTING TOWARD PERULet’s go back to the inscription on the cross:OCRUXAVESPESUNICAand let’s take the middle X in the words OCRUXAVES as a symbol for the crossitself. Then—if we are to follow the symbolic motif of the pedestal—we shouldcircle this central X, or cross. Dividing PESUNICA between the U and the N thenleaves us four words each with four letters surrounding the central X. Just likethe pedestal, this X then has four sides, and each side has a word with fourletters. There are four letters in the inscription (INRI) on the other side ofthe cross, as well as four stars around the sun in panel three on the pedestal,and four groups of two bursting rays each in the great star of panel one. Thereare sixteen rays, a multiple of four, bursting out from the sun in panel three.There are also four A’s in panel four, and so we are not surprised to find thatwithout the X, there are four words in the Latin inscription.Split in this pattern, the inscription looks like this:OCRU X AVESPESU NICANo matter how one jumbles the letters, there are no interpretations that makesense of all four words in this layout, although the words save and Inca jumpout at us from the right side. There is no certain answer to the inscription’sriddle to be found in this first move.18 [36_endnote-title.html#lll18]From Mevryl’s clue, we know that the next step involves exchanging K’s, or ahard C sound, for S. The new phrase now possesses four C’s. This is interestingbecause the word foresee is mimicked by the clue. The major purpose of the crossat Hendaye is to “foresee” the future. To solve the puzzle, it is necessary tomake sure that it has “four C’s.” Our inscription now looks like this:OCRU X AVECPECU NICAThis is not much better, but we are making progress. The next step is toreciprocate the transformation and turn the X into an S:OCRU S AVECPECU NICANow we have a simple anagram. Exchange the R and the C on the left side of the Sand rearrange the right side with a few simple transpositions and we have:OCCU S CAVEPERU INCAThen, finally, do the same transposition of the top word on the left side,including the extra S, and the meaning becomes clear:CUSCO CAVEPERU INCAwhich can be transposed and written as:INCA CAVE, CUSCO, PERUWhile this is clear and simple in several languages, we still haven’t found theimportance of the displaced S. Merely changing it to a C in an anagram doesn’ttell us why it is important. But there is more. There is another messageencrypted within the inscription. This additional message is anotherinterpretation of the Latin inscription’s place of refuge and uses the displacedS to point to a specific place, the “single space.” It uses only the top line ofthe inscription as originally written:OCRU X AVESTaking the S off the end of the phrase and placing it at the beginning is theonly major shift in the letters. It then reads:SOCRU X AVENow we have three words, read outward from the central cross. The first word isAVE; the second word is the X, or cross; the third word must be read backward.So instead of SOCRU the word now reads as URCOS. The line now looks like this:AVE X URCOSorHAIL (TO THE CROSS AT) URCOSwhich seemed rather obscure. Consulting a world atlas provided the answer.Looking closely at a map of Peru, we found a town called Urcos, in the Peruvianprovince of Cusco, only about twenty miles from Cusco city itself. Theinscription’s message is pointing to the city or the province of Cusco, Peru. Itis also pointing to a cross that is in, or near, the town of Urcos. Theconclusion must be that this is our place of refuge.Fulcanelli mentions the Inca briefly in his discussion of the green language,but gives us no other obvious pointers. Mevryl mentions the Andes, but avoidsany other suggestion of South America or its cultures. Van Buren, in her Refugeof the Apocalypse, thinks, on very slim evidence, that the place of refuge isRennes-le-Château, not Peru.The Chronicle of Felipe Huaman Poma de Ayala, written by one of Pizarro’sconquistadors, presented us with an incredible coincidence concerning the imageson the cross at Hendaye. As shown in figure 12.7, one of the very first drawingsin de Ayala’s chronicle of Peru is called “The Symbols of the Incas: The Sun;the Moon; Lightning; the hill of Guanacaure and the caves at Pacarictambo.”These four symbols are astonishingly close to the four symbols found on thepedestal at Hendaye.Mevryl implies that the A’s represent mountains with caves in them in either theSouth American Andes or the Himalayas, which suggests “the caves atPacarictambo” in de Ayala’s sketch. The other three panels correspond directlyto the sun, moon, and star images at Hendaye. The juxtaposition of the images inde Ayala’s sketch and the cross at Hendaye is astonishing.image [images/image380-00.jpg]Figure 12.7. Title page from the sixteenth-century Chronicle of Felipe HuamanPoma de Ayala, showing the close link to the symbols on the Hendaye cross.A few months after deciphering the message of the inscription, we met with Dr.Juan del Prado, professor of anthropology at Cusco University. He was touringthe United States with William Sullivan, who had recently published thegroundbreaking book The Secret of the Incas. We asked about the town of Urcos,and the possibility of a cross of some kind being there. Del Prado lookedsurprised and told us, “There is a strange cross in Urcos. No one knows where itcame from or who built it.”Right then and there, we realized that a trip to Peru was the next step in ourinvestigation.ATLANTIS IN THE ANDESIt is hard to determine exactly when the Old World “discovered” the New.Columbus’s voyages mark a watershed only of publicity and royal exploitation.Given that he seemed to know exactly where he was going and had fairly accuratesailing directions on how to get there, discovery is hardly the correct term. Infact, the farther back we go, the less of a distinction we find between the OldWorld and the New. One of the prime mysteries of the Bronze Age, roughly 3000B.C.E. to around 800 B.C.E., is where did the enormous amounts of copper neededto plate whole buildings in bronze, such as we find in Minoan Crete, come from?As shown in figure 12.8B, the tin came from England and the coast of Cornwall,but there are no significant copper deposits in Europe or the Mediterraneanbasin. So where did all this copper come from?In the five hundred years before Columbus, we find evidence of Vikings, Scottishand Welsh princes, and Irish monks all traveling to the New World. Indeed, theVikings created a colony in North America. A twelfth-century pope even appointeda bishop to Vinland, and the remains of his church can still be seen today inNewport, Rhode Island. The Viking sagas show that they penetrated into the upperMidwest and the Great Lakes. The sagas also refer to the inhabitants of what isnow New England as being Irish, labeling the region White Man’s Land.19[36_endnote-title.html#lll19]In fact, New England has many Celtic and even megalithic-type stone structureswhose closest analogs are found in Ireland and the west coast of Britain. Suchstructures are found in odd places up and down the East Coast, and differgreatly from the clearly indigenous Hopewell and Adena cultures in the Ohio andMississippi valleys.20 [36_endnote-title.html#lll20] In the Grave Creek burialmound in West Virginia, a clay tablet was found with an inscription in ancientCelto-Iberian exchanging greetings from the queen of a Celtic culture to theeast and the king of the local Hopewell nation. This tablet has been dated toaround 1000 B.C.E. One must assume that the copper trade was still viable atthat point, since the Hopewell federation contained many sources of easilyaccessible copper.21 [36_endnote-title.html#lll21]image [images/image381-00.jpg]Figure 12.8. A. the prevailing Atlantic Ocean currents; B. map of ancient traderoutes.A megalithic or Celtic presence in North America seems indisputable given theevidence of the structures and inscriptions on the ground. But the Celts werenot the only visitors to the New World. The Egyptians may have traveled in themiddle of the third millennium B.C.E. as far as Australia, where the cartoucheof Rajedef, the son of Khufu of Great Pyramid fame, has been found carved instone in the desert outback.22 [36_endnote-title.html#lll22] By the time ofHatshepsut, a millennium later, regular trade voyages were under way to placesthat remain unknown to this day. One of these was the “land of the coppermountain,” as the inscription reads on the porch of her mortuary tomb on thewest bank at Luxor. The fact that cocaine and nicotine residue has been found inNew Kingdom mummies suggests that this trade was in fact with South America.Soon after Hatshepsut’s reign, New Kingdom Egypt lost its overseas trade to theup-and-coming Sea Peoples, the Phoenicians and the Minoans. By the time thequeen of the Celtic east in America was conducting her negotiations with theHopewell magnate, a Phoenician was sure to be the middleman in the exchange. ThePhoenician trading culture began to fade with the arrival of iron-equippedAryans, such as the Doric Greeks, a century or so after the turn of the firstmillennium B.C.E. These are the Greeks of our history books, brash barbarianseager to acquire the knowledge of the ancient world.The Greek connection brings us to Plato and his story of Atlantis. In hisdialogues, Plato introduces the idea of an ancient civilization that died out ina great catastrophe roughly nine thousand years before the Golden Age of ancientGreece. In most of these dialogues it is hard to tell which are Socrates’ ideasand which are Plato’s, but the Atlantis story is solidly attributed. In theCritias, it is Plato’s friend of the same name who relates the tale. He claimsto have heard it from his grandfather, who learned it from the great Solon, oneof Greece’s Seven Sages, who heard it from an Egyptian priest of Sais namedSonchis. Thus, in the dialogue the story has a clear and prominent lineage.Plato insisted four times that the story was true. He was quite definite aboutit. “The fact that it is not invented fable but a genuine history is allimportant,” he tells us in the Timaeus. The most reasonable explanation is thatSolon gave an accurate account of what his Egyptian source told him. From this,we would be wise to consider Atlantis a genuine Egyptian tradition, rather thana philosophical fable. Chances are, Atlantis really existed and it wasn’t MinoanCrete, although they may have had “Atlantean” connections.But where was Atlantis? Plato tells us “in those days the Atlantic wasnavigable; and there was an island situated in front of the straits which are byyou called the Pillars of Hercules [the Straits of Gilbraltar].” This seemsclear enough, but modern knowledge of sea-floor spreading and continental driftsuggests that no extra island of any size is possible in the mid-Atlantic. Thesunken continent idea seems improbable, even though Plato insists that Atlantisdisappeared in a single day and night of catastrophe.Modern consensus among archaeologists and scholars is that if there is any truthto Plato’s tale, then it must be referring to the explosion of Thera, an islandin the Aegean Sea, around 1500 B.C.E.23 [36_endnote-title.html#lll23] Along withignoring Plato’s precise location and dating, this theory has massive problemson its own terms. Dramatic as the destruction of Thera was, its loss hardlyaffected life in the Mediterranean. The Minoans did not fade out over night;their main cities were not abandoned or destroyed for another hundred years. ThePhoenicians were untouched, and their expansion of trade routes increased in thecenturies after Thera’s explosion. Thera was a disaster, and its destruction wassudden, but it was hardly the fall of Atlantis.Other theorists have located Atlantis in places as fanciful as Ceylon and asHeligoland in the Baltic Sea. Ignatius Donnelly, a nineteenth-century Americanpolitician and lecturer, wrote two massive books on Atlantis and the variouscatastrophes of prehistory. Atlantis: The Antediluvian World, while postulatinga mid-Atlantic island and other outdated ideas, comes closest to being thetextbook on Atlantis. Some of Donnelly’s other suggestions are intriguing,however, as when he speculates that the end of the Ice Age coincides perfectlywith Plato’s dates for the destruction of Atlantis.While Donnelly and the other mid-Atlantic theorists are right to take Platoliterally—“in front of the pillars of Hercules” is clear and simple enough—theirmaps mislead them. If we look at a standard wall map of the world, we see onlyopen ocean in front of the Pillars of Hercules. There is certainly room in themid-Atlantic for a very large island or continent. But if we look at a polarprojection map or a globe, such as the one shown in figure 12.9, we noticesomething right away. There already is a large island continent in front of thePillars. It’s called South America.image [images/image384-00.jpg]Figure 12.9. Polar projection of a world map showing Atlantis/South Americaopposite the Strait of Gibraltar.Plato tells us “in a single day of misfortune, the island of Atlantisdisappeared in the depths of the sea.” Given the evidence of modern geology, itis hard to conceive of how an entire continent, or even a very large island,could become completely submerged beneath the ocean. Even extreme theories, suchas crustal displacement, can’t account for a complete disappearance. We would dobetter to interpret Plato’s statement as being a description of a vast tidalwave that brought the depths of the sea to Atlantis than to insist on a literalsunken continent.With that in mind, we turned to South America with new interest. Did it, in anysignificant way, fit Plato’s description? Plato says that Atlantis was largerthan Libya and Asia Minor combined, suggesting an accessible coastline of over athousand miles. South America is the only candidate, including mythicalmid-Atlantic islands, that fits these criteria. He goes on to say that Atlantis“was the way to other islands, and from these you might pass to the whole of theopposite continent, which surrounds the true Ocean.”24[36_endnote-title.html#lll24] However one reads Plato’s account, it is quitestartling and reveals that whoever told Solon originally knew much more of thetrue geography of the planet than he should have. Let us merely note that thisdescription clearly could apply to South America. Evidence has also been foundof ancient visits to the Andean coast from Japan and China.In addition, South America has both advanced civilizations and evidence of theircatastrophic destruction. On the shore of Lake Titicaca, high in the PeruvianAndes, stands the mysterious ancient city of Tiahuanaco, built, according totradition, by the Andean culture hero Viracocha. Viracocha first appeared inTiahuanaco after a great disaster had destroyed everything. This is from FatherMolina in his chronicle Relacion de las fabulas ritos de los Yngas: “They saythat in it [the catastrophe] perished all races of men and created thingsinsomuch that the waters rose above the highest mountain peaks in the world. Noliving thing survived except a man and a woman who remained in a box, and, whenthe weather subsided, the wind carried them . . . to Tiahuanaco [where] thecreator began to raise up the people and the nations that are in that region.”25[36_endnote-title.html#lll25]Even today, the ruins of Tiahuanaco are impressive. To the early Spanishvisitors after the conquest they were truly awe-inspiring. Garcilasco de laVega, who visited in the mid-sixteenth century, described it this way:We must now say something about the large and almost incredible buildings ofTiahuanaco. There is an artificial hill, of great height, built on stonefoundations so that the earth will not slide. There are gigantic figures carvedin stone . . . these are much worn which shows great antiquity. There are walls,the stones of which are so enormous it is difficult to imagine what human forcecould have put them into place. And there are the remains of strange buildings,the most remarkable being stone portals, hewn out of solid rock; these stand onbases up to 30 feet long, 15 feet wide and 6 feet thick. How, and with the useof what tools or implements, massive works of such size could be achieved arequestions which we are unable to answer.26 [36_endnote-title.html#lll26]One of the stone portals de la Vega describes stands at the north-west corner ofa vast enclosure known as the Place of Upright Stones. This portal, while anamazing work of art, is also a complex and accurate calendar in stone. The wholecomplex has been found to be an intricate astronomical observatory, designedperhaps to calculate alignments of solstices and equinoxes with the galacticcore and edge. Whatever it was designed to do, its astronomical nature allows usto date its construction with precision.In the 1920s, Arthur Posnansky, a German-Bolivian scholar who had beeninvestigating Tiahuanaco for almost fifty years, published his monumental,four-volume work, Tiahuanaco: The Cradle of American Man. By using the smalldifferences in the earth’s tilt against the ecliptic and its effect on thesunrise azimuth from century to century, Posnansky calculated a date for theconstruction of Tiahuanaco.27 [36_endnote-title.html#lll27]The earth’s tilt changes slightly over time, with a length of one and a halfprecessional cycles between maximum and minimum. As we saw above, Reichpostulated that the tilt’s angle is caused by the earth’s spin in the midst ofan orgone flow from the center of the galaxy. On the basis of this bobbing orrolling motion, which resembles that of a ship on an ocean, Reich predicted thereason for the narrow, three-degree band of the tilt.28[36_endnote-title.html#lll28] LaViolette also speculates that the periodiceruptions from the galactic core could create the tilt, and therefore itsrelationship to precessional motion, Fulcanelli’s “helicoidal track of thesun.”29 [36_endnote-title.html#lll29]Posnansky found that by establishing the solar alignments of key structures thatnow looked out of true, he could determine the angle of the ecliptic tilt at thetime when the structure was built. He found a tilt of 23°8'48\". Comparing thisangle to the graph developed in 1911 by the International Conference ofEphemerids, we find a corresponding date of around 15,000 B.C.E. Naturally, mostorthodox archaeologists found this hard to take.But Posnansky’s work was checked by a high-powered group of specialists, and atthe end of a three-year study it concluded that Posnansky’s observation werecorrect.30 [36_endnote-title.html#lll30] The sites at Tiahuanaco were indeedlaid out to match a tilt-angle-derived date of circa 15,000 B.C.E. Thisconfirmation did little, however, to change the prevailing archaeologicalparadigm, and even today glossy picture books of the Andes tell us thatTiahuanaco was built by the pre-Inca civilization around 500 B.C.E. No one hasan answer for why anyone would build an observatory with its instrumentsfourteen and a half millennia out of alignment.Tiahuanaco was originally built as a port on the shores of Lake Titicaca whenthe lake was at least one hundred feet deeper and far wider. In that case,Tiahuanaco would have been an island, and the visitor can see the changes in thelake level and shoreline for over 5,000 years of inhabitance. The geologicalrecord shows that sometime in the eleventh millennium B.C.E., a sudden naturaldisaster struck the city. The evidence of this disaster is still visible in thevast chunks of rocks littering the site like so many discarded matchsticks.Posnansky argued that “this catastrophe was caused by seismic movements whichresulted in an overflow of the waters of Lake Titicaca” in a vast flood. Hecites the evidence of jumbles of human, animal, and fish bones covered by analluvial deposit, suggesting that the water descended on Lake Titicaca andTiahuanaco “in onrushing and unrestrainable torrents.”31[36_endnote-title.html#lll31]This certainly sounds similar to Plato’s description of the destruction ofAtlantis. Curiously enough, it also matches LaViolette’s predictions of theeffects of the double catastrophe that would result from a galactic coreexplosion. And while the initial destruction was sudden, the disasters continuedfor almost two millennia before the people of Tiahuanaco gave up and departed.This also fits LaViolette’ galactic-core explosion scenario and prediction, bothin terms of dating and in terms of the long-felt effects of the core explosion.Does that mean that Tiahuanaco is the lost city of Atlantis? Possibly, for thereis one curious connection with Plato’s tale that is hard to account for anyother way. Plato tells us that Atlantis contained a great number of elephants, afact that argues against Crete or Thera. Present-day South America has noelephants, of course, but during the Ice Age it apparently did. Remains havebeen found of a species called Cuvieronius, which was an elephant-likeproboscidean complete with trunk and tusks. We find these animals carved on thegreat stone portal of the Gateway of the Sun (fig. 12.10), suggesting they werecommon in the Tiahuanaco area. These “elephants,” however, became extinct around10,000 B.C.E.image [images/image388-00.jpg]Figure 12.10. This tablet, found near Cuena, Ecuador, reads, “The elephant thatsupports the earth upon the waters and causes it to quake.”Suggestive as this is, Tiahuanaco, even as an island, fails to match Plato’sdescription of the city of Atlantis. His account of the city may in fact bepurely symbolic or allegorical. Paul LaViolette points out that the descriptionof Atlantis matches a subquantum kinetic model of the primordial atom.32[36_endnote-title.html#lll32] At the very least, this would suggest that theAtlanteans had a mythic understanding of continuous-creation ether physics.While we can’t definitely say that the ancient cultures of South America are thelost Atlanteans, we can say that the likelihood is strong. No other alternativematches Plato so closely, and an advanced civilization in 15,000 B.C.E.,whatever its resemblance to Plato, must be considered a candidate for Atlantis.The cross at Hendaye’s inscription encodes a place of refuge, a place where thesurvivors of the last catastrophe gathered. One of our solutions of theinscription says “Inca Cave, Cusco, Peru,” directing us to the culturaldescendants of the mysterious builders of Tiahuanaco, the Incas. Whether or notAtlantis can be found in the Andes, Fulcanelli and the cross are telling us thatthe secret of the place of refuge from the last catastrophe can be found there.During the writing of this book, long after the above section was finished,cartographer J. M. Allen published his Atlantis: The Andes Solution, which notonly supported our ideas on Atlantis in the Andes, but also disclosed the actuallocation of the city itself.Starting with the same commonsense deductions as ours, Allen focuses on SouthAmerica as the most logical choice for Atlantis. He notes that the pre-ColumbianIndian name for the continent was Atlanta, a name Allen feels is related to theQuechua word for copper, antis, and the Nahuatl word for water, atl.33[36_endnote-title.html#lll33] Since antis is the origin of the word Andes, wemight suspect that the phrase on Hatshepsut’s mortuary temple is the Egyptianname for Atlantis.Allen turned to Plato and, taking literally his description of a rectangularplain crisscrossed by a grid of canals in the middle of the island, settled onthe Altiplano of southern Peru and northern Bolivia as the best match for thelocation of Atlantis. He built a three-dimensional model of the region anddiscovered Plato’s “rectangular plain surrounded by mountains.”This, Allen believed, was the key to the mystery. Plato describes a plain in thecenter of the long side of the continent, next to a body of water. The plain wasvery smooth and level, surrounded by mountains, high above sea level with theform of “a quadrangle, rectilinear for the most part and elongated.”34[36_endnote-title.html#lll34] This is, in fact, a close description of theAltiplano, the largest level plain in the world, and which also contains the twoinland seas of Lake Titicaca and Lake Poopo (see fig. 12.11).With this in mind, Allen went looking for Plato’s regular grid pattern. It wasdescribed as a 600-foot-wide canal running around the perimeter of the plainwith regular intersections and transverse canals forming a vast grid work. “Itonly remains then to discover on site evidence of a channel 600 ft. wide to saywithout any more doubts that here indeed is the proof that the city and thecivilization of Atlantis existed in these parts,”35[36_endnote-title.html#lll35] Allen informs us. Satellite and aerial photossuggest that such canals do exist, and in the summer of 1995, Allen traveled toBolivia in search of them.“I found,” he tells us, “the remains of a channel of enormous dimensions, thebase of the canal was around 120 ft. wide and the gently sloping sides were eachof some 230 ft., making it just under 600 ft. from crest to crest of theparallel embankments.”36 [36_endnote-title.html#lll36] Atlantis, it seemed, hadbeen located.Allen buttresses his argument with examples of mineral wealth and early miningthat match Plato’s description. Atlantean use of gold to plate their sacredprecincts has echoes in the Inca temples discovered by the Spanish, and anatural alloy of gold and copper, mentioned by Plato, oriculum, can be found asa mineral only in the region of the Altiplano. As the matches mounted up, webecame convinced that Allen had discovered the source of Plato’s tale.image [images/image390-00.jpg]Figure 12.11. The region around the Altiplano, the irrigated plain mentioned byPlato, showing Lake Titicaca and Lake Poopo, probably the location of variousAtlantean cities.For most interpreters and Atlantis seekers, the description of the city itselfis the most problematic. Why concentric circles of water and land? It seems oddand unnecessary. But the Altiplano hypothesis addresses this very issue. Beingan ancient volcanic region, there are many eroded volcanic cones near theAltiplano, including one on the northeast side of Lake Poopo, which match insize Plato’s dimensions. These cones form natural concentric circles out fromthe central flue of the volcano and can be easily shaped and filled with waterto produce the specific Atlantis configuration, which Allen calls the Cross ofAtlantis, as shown in figure 12.12. It is just possible that this ancientcivilization built its greatest city as a model of the primordial atom ofcontinuous creation and the Great Cross of the galactic alignment. Certainlythese concepts remained in play down to the time of the Incas, and even today aChristianized version of the cosmic model survives in the remote village ofMisminay, as we shall see a little later.image [images/image391-00.jpg]Figure 12.12. An overhead view of the plan of Atlantis reveals Allen’s Cross ofAtlantis. Three circular walls surround the island city with canals traversingthem. The shaft of the cross is the large entrance canal.There are a few problems, from the perspective of our inquiry, with Allen’swork. He seems hesitant to let go of the Sea Peoples and the Bronze Age date ofThera, circa 1300 B.C.E., even though he tells us that Lake Poopo flooded theregion around 12,000 B.C.E. It is hard to account for his reluctance to embracethe older dates. He is apparently unaware of Posnansky’s work, and barelymentions archaeo-astronomy in any meaningful way. Even with these gaps, however,it is clear that Allen is presenting significant evidence for the location anddate of Atlantis.Here we have more proof that Fulcanelli’s possible place of refuge was theancient home of the advanced global civilization of prehistory. Carrying thisscenario further, we can speculate that the Atlantean culture survived onethousand years or more of intermittent catastrophe before finally emigrating tocolonies around the planet, which would include the ancient Nile Valley. TheIncan Viracocha was the godlike survivor from the Atlantean civilization whobrought back to cataclysmravaged regions the skills and graces of civilization,including perhaps the knowledge of how to calculate the time of the next cosmicdisaster.THE NAVEL OF THE WORLDLima, Peru, is one of the driest places on earth. It sits on the west coast ofSouth America, at the north end of the Peru/Chile coastal desert. Ten to twentyyears will sometimes pass without a single drop of rainfall. Although the oceanis just a stone’s throw away, there is no moisture and very little life in thisdesert. Outside of the sprawling, povertyridden city there is nothing but milesand miles of dried yellow sand with not a weed, plant, or any other living thingin sight.When the Spanish asked the Incas where the best place to put a city was, theywere told to settle where Lima stands today. The Incas considered Lima to be theworst place on earth to live, so recommending it as a place of settlement wastheir way of getting back at the Spanish. Lima today is a sprawling metropolisthat stretches for mile upon dusty mile in all directions. Only the PacificOcean mercifully stops it from going any farther. But the coastline doesn’t stopeverything; the beaches are filled with mountains of trash washed out by thetidal flow, every day, into the blue waters of the world’s biggest ocean.Lima is the only major city in Peru. Outside the city limits lies a country thatis wild, unpopulated, and forbidding. There is no shortage of mysteries in thisland. There are lost cities, hidden tunnel systems, gigantic ruins, and remnantsof ancient societies. Peru also has four ecological zones that run the gamutfrom the hottest desert to the wettest rain forest on earth. Needless to say,there are countless places to get lost and remain hidden forever.The one-hour flight from sweltering Lima to the cool mountains of Cusco bringswelcome relief. Cusco is an Inca word for “navel of the world,” possibly even ananalog for the center of the galaxy. If we think of the curving, snakelike shapeof the Andes Mountains as the Milky Way, then Cusco is indeed at the center.The high Andes Mountains rise out of the earth to climb in places to altitudesover 20,000 feet. Their ragged cliffs, proof of their young age, attract theclouds and moisture out of the Amazon jungle far below and to the east. Theseclouds bring the necessary rainfall that keeps the high Andes fertile andverdant. In Cusco, as opposed to Lima, there is always a cool wind that blowsthrough the green trees and fertile valleys. The people seem happier, too. TheQuechua are a proud and handsome people with high cheekbones and honest eyes,reminding us of the Basque people on the border of Spain and France.The Incas ruled their empire for less than 150 years before the Spanishconquistadors appeared. Around 1400 C.E., a group of Quechua nobles from Cuscomanaged to unite the warring factions left from the dissolution of the ancientempire of the Wari-Tiawanku, which had ruled the Andean highlands for a thousandyears.37 [36_endnote-title.html#lll37] They accomplished this by returning tothe way of Viracocha, producing a brilliant synthesis of Andean civilizationgoing all the way back to the culture of Tiahuanaco and the prehistoricAtlanteans. The physical remains of the Incan empire, its roads and bridges,temples, towns, fortresses, and irrigation canals, can today be seen everywherein Peru and Bolivia. The modern visitor is left with the impression thatsomething very important happened in the Andean highlands long ago, and thatnothing much has happened since.It’s hard to account for the sudden brilliance of the Incan civilization. Theempire itself was an idea whose time had come. Several centuries of constantwarfare had prepared the highlands to accept a political solution, but it is thecultural effervescence that catches our attention. The way of Viracocha taughtthat civilization must be in the image of the origin of all things. The wordinca in Quechua means “archetype” or “original pattern.” The world was “inca,”or correctly aligned with the original model when it was formed as a cross witha unifying center point. As with most Native American cultures, this arrangementwas visualized as the essential order of space.In the high Andes, the Milky Way is the most striking feature of the night sky.It arches overhead like a great river of stars encircling the terrestrialsphere. To the Quechua, descendants of the Incas, it was simply Mayu, “theriver,” which brought water from the cosmic ocean upon which the terrestrialsphere floats and gave it back to the land as rain. However, the motions in thesky of the river of the Milky Way over the course of twenty-four hours createtwo lines, which cross at the zenith and divide the sky into four quarters. Atone zenith, the galaxy stretches out in a northwest–southeast diagonal; twelvehours later, at the other zenith, the galaxy stretches northeast–southwest.The zenith crossing point is called Cruz Calvario, the Cross of Calvary, by agroup of Quechua in the small community of Misminay. This group of Incandescendants were studied in the 1970s by anthropologist Gary Urton, whodiscovered that the ancient cosmology of the Incas, and perhaps all the way backto Viracocha, had survived in the now largely Christianized worldview of thelocal community. This combination of ancient cosmology and Christian symbolismmakes Urton’s descriptions of the landscape organization of Misminay read like aliving commentary on the Hendaye cross.The great galactic cross, the Calvario, is mirrored on the ground by the twomajor roads of the region, which run northeast–southwest and southeast–northwestand cross at the center of the village (fig. 12.13). Marking this spot is asmall chapel, the Crucero, or cross, in the form of a cross, mirroring thegalactic Calvario and linked by an invisible axis. The local river, theVilcanota, runs beside the “middle way,” the northwest–southeast axis that isthe “day” diagonal of the Galaxy at the local zenith. The other road, whichmirrors the “night” diagonal of the local zenith, is considered the ascending orvertical path and is called the “path of the great division.” Canals and otherwater channels in the region also follow this cross pattern paralleling theroads.image [images/image394-00.jpg]Figure 12.13. The Misminay worldview: living inside sacred space. The crossbelow the chapel, or Crucero, mirrors the cross of the galaxy in the sky, theCalvario. (Redrawn from Geoffrey Cornelius and Paul Devereux, The SecretLanguage of the Stars and Planets [San Francisco: Chronicle Books, 1996])The ancient Andean people based this ordering of the landscape on theirobservation of the behavior of the Milky Way, which appears to divide the skyand the horizon intercardinally. More than any other point, this basicarrangement of space and time into an intercardinal,northeast–southwest/northwest–southeast cross suggests the supreme importance ofthe galaxy, the great Mayu, in Andean mythology.The Incas called their empire Tawantinsuyu, the United Four Quarters, to echothis primal alignment in the sky. The center of the cross was Cusco, the navelof the world (fig. 12.14).image [images/image395-00.jpg]Figure 12.14. Tawantinsuyu, the Incan “United Four Quarters,” divided at Cusco,navel of the world.And if Cusco was the navel of the world, then the Corincancha, the great Templeof the Sun, was the navel of Cusco. Built at the confluence of Cusco’s tworivers, the Corincancha was the center of an enormous ceremonial calendaralignment based on the sidereal lunar year of 328 days (12 × 27.33 = 327.96).The key alignment was based on the winter solstice sunrise. The Sapa Inca, thearchetypal man, or the king, would have been seated in a niche lined with goldand precious stones. As the rising solstice sun struck the niche, the Inca wouldhave been bathed in a shimmering golden aura, making him truly the “Son of theSun.”38 [36_endnote-title.html#lll38]Through Cusco, these alignments, shown in figure 12.15, with the heavensnourished the earth in the person of The Inca, the archetypal man, or the king.He was the center of the hub around which the crossed circle of time and spacerevolved. In Western terms, he is most like the pharaoh of Egypt as son of theSun, and beyond that a composite of Adam, Christ, and the Grail King.image [images/image396-00.jpg]Figure 12.15. Map of ancient Cusco showing the Corincancha and the majoralignments of the city. Also shown are the traditional names of the fourquarters.All of these correspondences become even more intriguing when we think of theAndes as a naturally suggestive pattern for the Milky Way, with Cusco at thegalactic center. The cross of the four quarters then echoes the four projectedTrees of Life on the celestial sphere. The Sapa Inca, the unique man in the formof the king, begins to look a lot like the Adam Kadmon, the cosmic man of thekabbalists, formed from the intersection of these Trees. The Adam Kadmon, aseries of meditative and magical exercises, developed from the idea of the Treeof Life as it extends through the worlds, and was seen as a model for universalconsciousness. The way of Viracocha could be the secret of astro-alchemy itselfin a form lost to the West after Egypt’s decline, a way to tap into this currentof sentience that, theoretically at least, embraces Mind everywhere in theuniverse. The star religion of the early dynasties of Egypt, as recorded in thePyramid Texts, can dimly be perceived as a practical application of thiscosmological philosophy, and as we shall see, the arrangement of the Pyramids atGiza also reflects this quartering of the sky by the galactic river.INCAN CAVES AND THE CROSS AT URCOSWhen Pizarro learned of the Incas in 1526, by intercepting a strange craft farout on the western ocean loaded with golden and silver trade objects, the throneof Tawantinsuyu was occupied by the eleventh Inca since the unification of thefour quarters, Wayna Qhapaq.39 [36_endnote-title.html#lll39] The Inca had beencrowned in 1493, the year a corrupt pope, Alexander VI, divided the New Worldbetween the Spanish and the Portuguese, and lived out his long and illustriousreign in blissful ignorance of history’s ticking clock. When word reached him ofthe strangers probing the borders of his empire, The Inca was in Quitoconsolidating his conquest of what is now Ecuador and thinking of pushing oninto what is now Colombia. And then the Spaniards’ secret weapon struck.The pandemic that devastated Mexico and Central America arrived, either withPizarro or overland through Colombia, and burst upon the twenty millioninhabitants of the Incan empire with lethal effect. Half the population died,including The Inca. Pachakuti Yamki, an Inca noble writing a century later,described The Inca’s vision: “And when he turned to the sea with his entourage,there were seen at midnight, as if surrounding him, a million people . . .living souls . . . [of those] . . . about to die in the pestilence.”40[36_endnote-title.html#lll40] Soon after this, word of the Spaniards’ arrivalreached Quito and the court began to die. Wayna Qhapaq and his son and heir diedwithin a few days.Had it not been for this plague, Pizarro would have faced a united and powerfulfoe with a wily and battle-hardened king at the helm. It is unlikely that hewould have made much of a showing with only two hundred men, even armed withmuskets, against such might as the Incan empire had just fielded in Ecuador. ButThe Inca was far from the center, and disaster occurred. After the plague, tocompound the problem, fighting broke out between The Inca’s two surviving sonsas Waskhar, in control of Cusco, and Atawallpa, in control of the north, foughtit out for the succession while the Spaniards moved into the valley of Peru andbuilt settlements.Atawallpa, after he had established himself on the throne, investigated theSpaniards’ settlement and concluded that they posed little problem. In the olddays of The Inca, this might have been true. But Atawallpa chose to negotiatewith the barbarians and so was captured and held for ransom. When the Spaniardssaw the amount of gold available to The Inca, they killed him, launched a palacerevolt, and marched on Cusco in the name of Atawallpa’s son Manku. The Spaniardsplayed on the divisions caused by the civil war, which along with disease haddecimated the army. By 1533, they were in control of Cusco. Their puppet rulerManku revolted in 1536, but by then it was too late. Too many Spaniards and toomany guns faced a declining population and a disorganized army, and the resultwas disastrous to The Inca.Manku retreated to Machu Picchu, far into the Andes, and formed his own neo-Incastate, which survived for another two centuries. Interestingly enough, theTorreon, a now roofless temple structure at Machu Picchu, retains thetraditional northwest–southeast alignment so that when the Pleiades rise in onewindow, Scorpio sets in the opposite. Even in the midst of disaster, the Incasclung to their belief in the importance of the galactic axis.The Incas had mined the gold that Pizarro so coveted, and they used it inceremonial ornaments and, hammered into large plates, to line the walls of theirpalaces and their great religious centers. The most famous of these was theabove-mentioned Corincancha in Cusco. The original temple has disappeared and acathedral has been built over the old Incan foundation. In fact, most of thecity of Cusco is built on Incan foundations that are hundreds of years old. Withno mortar or concrete, these people were able to build stone edifices that havestood the test of time.The cathedral of Santa Domingo in Cusco is a decrepit and dark place. Themagnificent building, the Corincancha that this cathedral replaced, can only beimagined now. In addition to the gold plates on its walls, stories say that ahuge circular object of pure gold called “the Disk of the Sun” sat in itscenter. This disk was said to represent the central sun of the cosmos and wasmany inches thick, covered with precious jewels. It is said that when itreflected the light of the sun, it transformed it. The Incas believed that thelight became so pure that the people in the temple, particularly The Incahimself, seated in his golden niche, were physically transformed.The original Incan temple was much bigger than the cathedral that occupies thepresent spot. The Temple of the Sun was connected to the Temple of the Moon andthe complex of Sacsayhuaman by a series of underground tunnels. After theconquest, Pizarro heard rumors from the remaining Incas that there was a vastsubterranean tunnel system under the Andes. He had heard from the Indians thatthese tunnels were filled with gold and jewels hidden by Atawallpa’s queen. TheIncan queen had successfully hidden all of the tunnel openings from the Spanish.Cieza de Leon states in his Chronicle of Peru, written in 1555: “If, when theSpaniards entered Cusco they had not committed other tricks, and had not so soonexecuted their cruelty in putting Atahualpha to death, I do not know how manygreat ships would have been required to bring such treasures to old Spain, as isnow lost in the bowels of the earth and will remain so because those who buriedit are now dead.”41 [36_endnote-title.html#lll41] Perhaps the most aggravatingpart about any examination of the history of Peru is that the Spanish wrote itall. Pizarro and his band of men were brilliant at the goals of genocide,murder, and treachery. The voices of the Incas have been stilled and theirsecrets forgotten in the sudden strike of Spanish sword, gun, and horse. But therumors of vast tunnels persist, inflamed by the legends of lost Incan gold, andperhaps even the Disk of the Sun itself, which lies waiting to be found in somecave in the Andes.The ancient city of Cusco was laid out in the shape of a puma, a South Americanmountain lion (see fig. 12.15); this shape was made more pronounced by Incanemperor Pachacuti’s rebuilding around 1440 C.E. The main part of the old citylies within the animal’s torso, but the face of the puma and the nose are bothpart of the Sacsayhuaman complex, which towers high above the city. What is lefttoday of the giant stonework of Sacsayhuaman tells only a tiny part of the storyof these magnificent monuments and the unknown people who built them. At itsheight, the complex at Sacsayhuaman was enormous, with three tall towers androom for over five thousand defenders in its labyrinth of rooms. But it is onlyin the mind’s eye that one can reconstruct the magnificence of this center,built to mark the origin of the sacred river, channeled through stone conduitsand tunnels into the city. There are several tunnel openings still to be seen inthe complex. But they appear to have been sealed to depths of twenty to thirtyfeet.In his book Jungle Paths and Inca Ruins, William Montgomery McGovern writesabout Sacsayhuaman: “Near this fortress [Sacsayhuaman] are several strangecaverns reaching far into the earth. Here altars to the Gods of the Deep werecarved out of the living rock, and the many bones scattered about tell of thesacrifices which were offered up here.”42 [36_endnote-title.html#lll42]There are caves—just as the inscription on the cross at Hendaye suggests—in thecliffs above Sacsayhuaman, at one of the highest places above Cusco. Althoughthey are natural, it is obvious that humans have carved out major parts of theinterior of the caves. Not much is known about these caves except that theQuechua have used them for ancient ceremonies for centuries. No one knows whocarved these caves, and as far as we can tell, no one has done anyarchaeological study of them. They could very likely be places of refuge from anancient catastrophe.The area around the caves is as interesting as the caves themselves. Nearby arethe ancient remains of a small city. This extremely old site is sculpted andcarved in such a way as to reveal that it was once a ceremonial or spiritualcenter. Avenues and the foundations of buildings are laid out on the ground.Water pipes made of clay, for plumbing, are still visible.Less obvious are the number of sculpted animal effigies that have been carvedinto the rocks. The figures of snakes, pumas, and monkeys are still discernibledespite erosion. These carvings and statues are so old that many of the featureshave disappeared under the forces of wind and rain. Only faint traces of thisonce magnificent site remain.The cross at Hendaye, which is over three thousand miles and an ocean away,points to a cave in Cusco, Peru. Once the trek is made and enough questions areasked of the local Quechua population, this fabulous and forgotten site becomesmore interesting. One has to wonder if the caves are not an homage, or tribute,to the people who used them to survive the great catastrophe. Are they the oneswho built the gigantic tunnel system that allegedly runs under the Andes?One thing is for sure: The caves of Cusco referred to in the inscription on theHendaye cross do exist. And it is also true that these same caves are heldsacred by the local remnants of the Incas by virtue of the large piles of meltedceremonial candle wax that are found everywhere inside the caves. Our guide, alocal Quechuan, told us that there are many ceremonies in these caves at night.He also said that the caves, although unknown to foreign tourists, are quitewell known to the Quechua people. Many of the local Indians make pilgrimages tothese caves at least once a year.The Inti Raymi, or Festival of the Sun, is still celebrated every year atSacsayhuaman on the eve of June 23, the winter solstice. What until the 1940shad been a small affair has now grown into a three-day festival based around amock “Inca” and a procession from the square in front of the cathedral, the siteof the Corincancha, the Sun Temple, to Sacsayhuaman, with its caves andunderground water source.When he was asked why these caves are so important, our Quechua guide shruggedhis shoulders and said: “White people do not care for the earth in the same waythat we do. When we grow our food, we always ask mother earth for help. Thesecaves are inside our mother. They are closer to her soul. So we go there to talkto her and to ask for her help.”43 [36_endnote-title.html#lll43]Several of our questions are answered by the discovery of these caves. They arevery old, and they still hold a deep significance to the local people. They arein old Cusco, the head of Cusco’s puma. In fact, the caves, the sacred river’sorigin, and the ceremonial complex are near the tip of the nose of the puma, asif the animal were pointing his entire body at them. This site suggests Mevryl’scat-man’s-breath image that he attributes to Kathmandu in Nepal. It actuallyfits the pattern on the ground in Cusco much more closely.But we still had one clue from the Hendaye cross left to check. The inscription,and Dr. del Prado, had told us of a strange cross at Urcos, about twenty milessoutheast of Cusco. The last piece of the mystery was the secret of this secondcross.Urcos is a small and poverty-stricken town sixteen miles southeast of Cusco,remembered by history only for its role in Manku’s Incan rebellion. Every Sundaythe local farmers make their way down the steep mountain paths with sacks offreshly picked fruits, vegetables, and coca leaves to sell at the outdoormarket. There is a beautiful mountain lake next to the town. The cross at Urcossits at the mouth of this body of water, appropriately called Lake Urcos.No one knows who built the cross at Urcos. It is prominently displayed, sittingon top of a fifteen-foot-high stone pile (see fig. 12.16). One must walk up thesides of the steep pile to reach the cross that sits on top. The cross that isnow on this promontory, however, is not the original one.In perhaps the most heartbreaking part of our investigation, we found that theoriginal cross at Urcos was missing. The only thing left was its base, to whicha newer cross had been affixed. The base of the original cross is badly erodedand must be centuries old. The new cross is recent, perhaps less than fiftyyears old, and unadorned. No one knows how the old cross was broken or who tookit away.The locals say that there has always been a cross there. They say that thesymbol of the cross was extremely important to their culture. Indeed crosses, aswe saw in the imagery of the Four United Quarters, were a key concept in Incantradition. In addition, Urcos falls on the southeast–northwest,galactic-center–galactic-edge alignment along the sight line from the ancientstone pillar in the main square of Cusco toward the bright star Alpha Crucis ofthe Southern Cross.Beyond these tantalizing hints, however, the information—if there ever wasany—on the cross at Urcos has been destroyed. Nonetheless, its location andalignment do provide us with a valuable clue. The ushnu, the stone pillar in themain square of Cusco, defines the solar sight lines of the solstices andequinoxes along the reconstructed line of the Huatanay River toward AlphaCrucis. This alignment leads to the valley gate at Rumicola and beyond to thecross at Urcos, suggesting that the cross was somehow associated with theSouthern Cross of stars in the sky, a grouping that the Incas obviously found asfascinating as the movements of the sun.image [images/image403-00.jpg]Figure 12.16. The cross at Urcos, Peru, sits upon an ancient base. (Photo by JayWeidner)The message of the Hendaye cross comes down to “Hail, X (cross) Urcos.”Fulcanelli alerted us, through green-language wordplay and anagrams, to theimportance of this point. Assuming that Urcos is indeed the location and thatits alignment is significant, rather than any lost inscription that may haveclarified the matter, we are left with another mystery. How could aconstellation all but ignored by the Greeks and not even observable fromnorthern Europe provide the key to the place of refuge?Interestingly enough, the Greeks thought of the four stars of the Southern Crossas part of the Centaur, the constellation just above it. The constellation offour bright stars that is recognizably a cross straddles the Milky Way, a fullfour degrees wide at that point, and its vertical axis through Alpha Crucispoints to the southern celestial pole. The horizontal axis points toward thegalactic center at the cusp of Scorpio/Sagittarius, making it a perfect astralmarker of the cosmic Great Cross and the Cube of Space.The ability to observe the Southern Cross, and to successfully make calculationsbased on it, would inevitably lead to an understanding of both precession andthe galactic alignments resulting from it. Owing to the motion of precession onthe celestial poles, the constellations appear to rise and fall in the sky overvast periods of time. This can be seen best by observing Orion, located on thecelestial equator, which therefore makes it an excellent marker for precessionalmotion as well. Like Orion, precessional motion causes the Southern Cross torise and fall in the sky, as shown in figure 12.17. For roughly one-eighth of aprecessional cycle, approximately three thousand years, the Southern Cross isvisible above thirty degrees north latitude. In ancient Egypt during the NewKingdom, the Southern Cross was clearly visible as far north as Jerusalem.At the latitude of Luxor, the source of the curious rose-cross ankhs of theCoptic Museum, the Southern Cross would have been high in the southern sky atthe winter solstice. As the first rays of the rising sun flooded the innersanctum of Karnak Temple, the Southern Cross would still have been faintlyvisible to the south, as the Milky Way in the sky matched almost exactly thecourse of the Nile. Just as the alignments at the Corincancha united the sightline to the Southern Cross and the midwinter sunrise, so too does the greattemple of Amun at Karnak (see fig. 12.18). Unlike the Corincancha in thesouthern hemisphere, Karnak over time saw the celestial ankh slide down the skyuntil, soon after Egypt itself ceased to exist, the Southern Cross slipped belowthe horizon.image [images/image404-00.jpg]Figure 12.17. The Southern Cross never dips below the horizon in the southernhemisphere although its neighbor Gamma Centauri does, showing how the SouthernCross is circumpolar for that hemisphere.From Jerusalem, this celestial event occurred over the winter of 2 C.E. It ispossible that event was the source of the “Jesus” myths, with their blend ofalchemy and eschatology. The “earthing” of the cross, the place where theSouthern Cross touched the horizon, could easily be seen as the “birthplace” ofa messianic figure. In the first century C.E., the Southern Cross could still beseen from Luxor and Cairo, so its appearance with a bright star on top of itcould easily became a “rose” ankh, connecting the ancient mystery tradition andthe new messiah figure in one powerful symbol.image [images/image405-00.jpg]Figure 12.18. The solstice alignment of the temple of Amun at Karnak, showingthe unification of the solstice axis and the axis to the setting of the SouthernCross, circa 1600 B.C.E.Indeed, the key piece of information hidden in the ancient star charts preservedby the Arab scholars of Cairo and studied with such interest by Pope SylvesterII may in fact be the existence of the Southern Cross, with its rose-ankhappearance and the ability to use this constellation to precisely define theGreat Cross of the galactic alignment. The medieval Italian poet Dante, in hisPurgatory, refers to the Southern Cross, now lost to northern eyes, leaving thenorthern hemisphere “famished and widowed.” The reappearance of this informationin observations by fifteenth- and sixteenth-century explorers, and perhaps someinformation from Incan sources, seemed to have provoked a flurry of esotericactivity in Europe; the prophecies of Nostradamus and the Rosicrucians are twothat come to mind.Ultimately, the meaning of both crosses, Hendaye and Urcos, points to ametaphysical place of refuge, although it is just possible that the caves ofCusco did help survivors of a previous catastrophe. Even the surviving Quechuashamans agree that something more profound is involved this time around.Alberto Villoldo has been a student of Quechua shamanism for over twenty years.He discovered that the traditions of the shamans of Peru contained astonishinginformation. The goal of this shamanic wisdom seems to be the attainment of aluminous body of light. These same shamans told Villoldo, and the rest of theplanet on their 1996 tour of the Americas, that the world was truly coming to anend.44 [36_endnote-title.html#lll44] They also told Villoldo that the planetwould be transformed over the next few years in ways beyond our current abilityto comprehend. These shamans referred to the time period from 2002 to 2012 as“Pachacuti,” the time when everything is turned upside down and reality isrestructured.Villoldo also speaks of a possible break between Homo sapiens and what he refersto as an emerging new species, Homo luminous. Perhaps the path toward theapocalypse and the path toward spiritual liberation are the same. The shamans inPeru possess the same nuggets of information as are encoded in the cross atHendaye, the cathedrals in Europe, and the temple at Karnak, and that constitutethe secret of alchemy.The path toward extinction is very likely also the path toward a moreenlightened state. As a species begins to collectively realize that it is dyingout, an inner mechanism, possibly built into the blueprint of the DNA, begins tocreate the next level of being, a new species.45 [36_endnote-title.html#lll45]Alchemy and the secret of esoteric philosophy are the pathways to Homo luminous.Alchemy is nothing less than the science of how our species evolves. We can seetraces of this fact in the ancient Andean civilizations from Tiahuanaco to theCusco of the Incas, but unfortunately we have no written records, no literature,to allow us to flesh out these celestial beliefs within a cultural framework.For that we must turn to ancient Egypt and its sacred science of immortality."},{"pageContent":"image [images/image409-00.jpg]I know, myself, that the goddess Isis is the mother of all things . . . and thatshe alone can bestow Revelation and Initiation.—LE MYSTÈRE DES CATHÉDRALES"},{"pageContent":"THIRTEENFROM ATLANTIS TO SHAMBHALAimage [images/image410-00.jpg]THE CROSS AND THE MYTH OF TIMEWhen we began our quest that chilly spring morning standing in front of thecross in the midst of Hendaye’s market day, we had no idea of the strangepathways down which it would lead us. We started with a series of mysteries—themystery of Fulcanelli, the mystery of the cathedrals, the mystery of alchemy andits connection with chiliasm and eschatology, the mystery of the Hendaye crossand its message of an approaching catastrophe—and the closer we came to solvingthese mysteries, the greater the overall mystery became.The cornerstone of the greater mystery is the cross at Hendaye, a true monumentto the end of time. From this simple, inelegant, and obscure monument,Fulcanelli derives his warning that our hemisphere will be tried by fire as wellas his message of hope that there is a place of refuge. Our detailed decodingrevealed that the monument does indeed suggest the mechanism of the doublecatastrophe, and it demonstrates that the ancient illuminated science ofastro-alchemy creates an astronomically correct Cube of Space within theprojected Tree of Life. This illuminated astronomy makes use of sophisticatedalignments between the galactic core and the solar system’s angular momentum toits radial energy flow. It also supplies us with a pattern that can be used tolocate precisely our solar system in intergalactic space. Contemplating thesource of this advanced cosmological knowledge gives us a glimpse of the greatermystery.The cross at Hendaye uses this ancient illuminated astronomy to predict thetiming of the double catastrophe. Its symbolism reveals a season of destructionfrom summer solstice to winter solstice over a twenty-year period by pointing toits midpoint, the fall equinox of 2002, when the planetary and solar alignmentsformed a right-angled cross between our system’s angular momentum and thegalactic center. As we have seen, the equinox midpoint is bracketed by celestialevents on the solstice, the most prominent of which is the heliacal rising ofthe sun and the galactic center on the winter solstice of 2012. As this is theend date of the Mayan calendar and a significant date in the Tibetan Kalachakra,its importance takes on added significance. Yet it is the cross as a symbol anda metaphor that has universally held man’s attention.The INRI above the starburst on the eastern face of the cross demonstrates howclosely Christianity is related to the mystery of the Last Judgment. Maybe,however, given the reading of INRI of “Isis Naturae Regina Ineffabilis,” or“Isis, the Ineffable Queen of Nature,” we ought to adjust our understanding ofChristianity to reflect a more Egyptian perspective.Perhaps the stories of the birth of a savior are symbolic references to atransformative time. Horus is born to avenge his father Osiris’s death at thehands of his uncle Seth. This strange familial motif is carried through inliterature and legends such as Shakespeare’s Hamlet, the Greek Oedipustragedies, the myths of Jason, and dozens more. What if these myths reflect theconditions in the sky thousands of years ago, at the time of the lastcatastrophe? And what if these myths are about to reappear in the skies of ourtime?We can see this most clearly when we contemplate chiliasm’s source, the NewJerusalem of Revelation. In chapter 21, verse 10, John tells us that the angel“showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.” Thissuggests that the Holy City is a pattern in the heavens first, before it becomesa reality on earth. Since the Holy City, as the angel reveals in 21:16, is avast cube, we can easily see this as the Cube of Space. The millennial moment,the climax and end of time, is the moment when the Cube of Space becomes theHoly City of the New Jerusalem.This happens, of course, when the celestial markers—sun, moon, planets, edge,and center of the galaxy—assume their appropriate mythological positions, whichoccurs once every 13,000 years. At that moment, the Cube of Space becomesanimated and the heavenly city descends. The cross at Hendaye tells us that weare in the moment now. Only at this point in time, a twenty-year season markedby the midpoint that occurred at the fall equinox of 2002, do the alignments ofthe Cube of Space and the Tree of Life match the reality in the sky.John Michell, in his seminal work City of Revelation, demonstrates that thesacred geometry of the New Jerusalem provides a link between various sacredstructures, such as Stonehenge and the Great Pyramid, and the basic ratio of themoon’s orbit around the earth.1 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm1] Taking this as aclue, we can imagine that the cube of the New Jerusalem forms within the spheredefined by the moon’s orbit. It would, of course, be aligned to the larger Cubeof Space defined by the celestial events. This cube-within-a-cube image is athree-dimensional representation of a hypercube, the four-dimensional structureformed from the Cube of Space by projecting the Tree of Life onto its surface.The phases of the mythological drama, the death of Osiris, the birth of Horus,and his triumph, like the phases of the alchemical transformation, represent themanifestations of the different celestial events forming the New Jerusalem cubeand their spiritual consequences for the human psyche. If we assume that theHoly City is complete between 1992 and 2012, then it does indeed look likeRevelation is specifically describing the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.Perhaps all the horrors of our times are the result of a cosmological alchemy inwhich the transfiguration of time triggers other transformations. It is possiblethat we are being pushed by cosmological events toward extinction orenlightenment as a species.Paul LaViolette’s work suggests that the mechanism of the double cataclysm couldbe the arrival of a galactic-core superwave, which would push dust into the sun,causing a massive coronal discharge. This double catastrophe is loosely tied tothe precessional cycles, which the ancient illuminated astronomy measured bygalactic-core alignments. Perhaps the alignments, such as depicted on Hendaye,occur before the arrival of the superwave and its destructive effects, as a kindof warning, the signs and portents Revelation promises in the sky. It could alsobe a window of opportunity for profound change, perhaps even the moment ofascension or the mass attainment of the Diamond Body, an immortal light bodydescribed in Tibetan Buddhism.However we interpret the cosmic mythology, it is the oddly divided Latininscription on the Hendaye cross that provides us with important clues; itconfirms the timing of the catastrophe and then, most signifi-cantly, points tothe location of a possible place of refuge. If we pass Fulcanelli’s test andlearn to search for the missing refuge within the “space” of the misplaced S, wefind a precise location, Cusco, Peru, the Incas’ analog to the center of thegalaxy, their “navel of the world.” Following this clear message, we stumbledupon the original location of Atlantis, our lost pre-catastrophe globalcivilization, and, from the inherited wisdom of its descendants, including theIncas, we discovered the importance of the celestial cross in the southern sky.Andean traditions tell of a culture hero, Viracocha, who emerged from the centerof the world and gathered the remnants of civilization together at Tiahuanaco,one of the ruined cities of Atlantis. Perhaps this is a memory of the survivorsof the last catastrophe and their determination to rebuild their culture. Themysterious Raimondi stela found in the Peruvian highlands and dating to at least1000 B.C.E. depicts a Viracocha-type shaman. In this image (fig. 13.1), theViracocha shaman is shown with his internal centers aligned with their planetaryequivalents while engaged in surveying stellar alignments with a pair ofserpententwined staffs.image [images/image413-00.jpg]Figure 13.1. The Raimondi stela, left, viewed right side up, is a human figurein an elaborate headdress; right, viewed upside down, the figure appears as adragon with a large gaping mouth.When we stand back and look at this vast panorama of connections andcorrespondences, the conclusions, strange as they may seem, are obvious. A highcivilization existed in the Andes around 15,000 B.C.E. It was perhaps even farbeyond our current level. A catastrophe destroyed that culture, except forisolated pockets of survivors. It is possible that some of these “survivors”were actually immortal beings who had attained a “light body” before the wave ofdestruction arrived. Whatever their exact nature, these beings worked forthousands of years to restart civilization from the ground up, perhapsliterally.The Viracocha shaman and his surveying staffs suggest that part of the revivalhad to do with reestablishing a kind of geomantic structure, aligned to thestars, the planets, and other galactic locations, that encouraged life andconsciousness. Given that the geometry of both Stonehenge and the Great Pyramidis related to the New Jerusalem cube that is now forming in the sky, we mightexpect that the idea of an earth grid, Plato’s spherical icosadodecahedron oftriangles, would provide more confirmation of this structure.And indeed it does. A mirror image of the structure of Notre-Dame-de-Paris’schoir/apse (fig. 13.2) forms a perfect icosadodecahedron-grid pattern,indicating a connection between the cathedral’s building and the earth grid.Even more intriguing, the long ley line through central England, which passesthrough Stonehenge and Avebury—two ancient sky temples, complete in Avebury’scase with serpents—also passes through Tiahuanaco. Most curious of all, however,is the occurrence of an essentially interactive phenomenon along this ley lineacross England—the crop circles.image [images/image414-00.jpg]Figure 13.2. Mirror symmetry of the apse of Notre-Dame-de-Paris produces theicosadodecahedron pattern of the earth’s grid.For thousands of years, “spirits” had been making simple circles in the grain ofsouthern England. Children played in the fairy circles, and the farmers leftthem alone, figuring the little folk had claimed their share of the crop.2[36_endnote-title.html#mmm2] All that changed in the 1970s, when the phenomenonwas discovered by “anomaly hunters” and the media. As more people becameinterested, and began tramping over the fields and camping out waiting for aglimpse of the circle makers, the designs grew more complex and involved. By theearly 1990s, it was obvious that something very unusual was going on.The 1999 vintage of crop circles included images that were startlingly close tothe core of the astro-alchemical secret (see fig. 13.3). One was a perfectfour-circle overlapping geometric structure of the Tree of Life. The Tree itselfhad appeared in 1996, but 1999 also saw several complex designs based on theCube of Space. Most startling of all was the design that depicted an approachingobject engulfing the sun, causing an eruption.3 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm3]Perhaps the Viracocha cult programmed these interactive localities to teach usour cosmic geometry and warn us of the danger. Perhaps the Viracocha cultsurvived in other forms as well. If they were truly immortal, even if only inthe form of the circle makers, then they might still be out there, trying tohelp us make the transition and survive the catastrophe.As suggestive as the crop circles, their makers, and their message might be ofthe greater mystery, however, they have yet to provide us with more thantantalizing possibilities, and, as usual with the paranormal, more questionsthan answers. They do at least present us with a new spin on “green language,” ageometric language written in the “green” of the grain fields. But without abroader perspective, this “langue vert” remains incomprehensible and elusive.The circle makers have provided a text, but what is missing is the suitablemythological host, a framework of myth and experience, some of it psychic, that“explains” the interaction between reality and the numinous.At the primal level, there are two realities, earth and sky, and they form thefoundation of our understanding of space and, as a result of that spatialunderstanding, time. As soon as a culture or a civilization attains a certainlevel of awareness, it recapitulates for itself a cosmogony, a description ofthe origins of the cosmos. One of the earliest of which we have any record, andin many ways one of the most complex, is the ancient creation myth ofHeliopolis, the Egyptian city of On.4 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm4]image [images/image416-00.jpg]Figure 13.3. A selection of crop-circle designs from 1999, the geometry of whichis suggestive of the Cube of Space and the aligning of celestial bodies.In the virtual cosmic ocean of Nun, the Atum, whose name means “not to be” aswell as “complete (unto itself),” slumbered in a lotus bud. By an act of will,Atum emerged from the virtual “not to be” into the completeness ofmanifestation, becoming in the process “Re,” or the portal of existence,symbolized by the sun. The hieroglyph for re is a vesica piscis, the vibratingstring of a standing wave function out of which, by the process oftransformation, all things are created. This image became the “sun” in the senseof the primal source of light and energy (see fig. 13.4).Atum-Re, the complete portal of existence, generated the first two polarqualities or attributes: heat, Tefnut, and moisture, Shu. They in turn createdGeb, the earth, and Nut, the sky. Atum-Re learned that the sky and the earth hadbeen indulging in a sexual dalliance and dispatched Shu to separate them. Nutwas thrust upward, arching overhead as the starry sky, her arms and legsbecoming the four pillars of the heavens. Geb, in longing for her, thrustsupward mountains in an effort to reach her. To prevent any more suchshenanigans, Atum-Re decreed that Nut, the sky goddess, could not conceiveduring any month of the solar year.image [images/image417-00.jpg]Figure 13.4. Egyptian hieroglyphics of the name Re with simplified meanings.However, the god of time, Tehuti, or Thoth (see fig. 13.5), had a differentidea. While Atum-Re represents a solar view of space ordering time, Thothrepresents a more lunar or biological view of time inhabiting space. Realizingthat a primeval universe of quintessential ordering was also static andunchanging, Thoth played a strange game of proto-chess or checkers—Thoth wassaid to have invented the use of eight-by-eight, the magic square of Mercury,game boards—with the Moon, an aspect of himself, and won a seventy-second partof its light. From this “artificial light,” Thoth created five days that did notbelong to any of the months in the 360 days of Atum-Re’s solar year. On thesedays, Geb and Nut had their romantic encounters, producing a new quintessence,that of the metaphorical “Neters,” or forces: Osiris, Isis, Horus (the elder),Seth, and Nephthys.In this tale we can also see another pair of opposites, the static solar timeand the dynamic precessional time, measured by the Egyptians in terms of fourlunar-eclipse cycles of roughly seventy-two years. These are the games of chessThoth played with the Moon and “won,” perhaps by landing on, and therebypredicting, the eclipses. From this very early cosmogony, we can determine thattime and timekeeping went beyond merely tracking the local solar and lunarchanges; indeed, they were derived from the larger celestial motion ofprecession. These changes in the larger mystery of the mythic sky had practicaland ritual significance for the ancient societies that incorporated them intotheir mythic structures.image [images/image418-00.jpg]Figure 13.5. Thoth, keeper of time.This is the somewhat sweeping claim made by the most comprehensive look at thesubject of stellar myths since Hewitt’s History and Chronology. In 1969, Giorgiode Santillana and Hertha von Dechend published Hamlet’s Mill: An Essay on Mythand the Frame of Time,5 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm5] in which they argued thatthe geography of myth is actually that of the heavens and that the world of themythic imagination is the whole of the cosmos. In this view, precession is thecause of a series of successive catastrophes as each group of constellationsmarking an Age falls away from its solstice or equinox marker point, and thesecatastrophes are assimilated within a framework of mythic events that give themmeaning within the culture.Santillana and von Dechend identified the mythic geography, its roads, oceansand rivers, and, most significant, its trees and poles, as components of thesky, the Milky Way, and the celestial axis. We saw how the Christianized Incasof Misminay still use the metaphors of roads and rivers to mirror the alignmentsin the sky, and in chapter 8 [21_chapter-title-10.html] we examined the conceptof the World Tree at some length. Hamlet’s Mill adds another component, therecurring cosmological motif of a mysterious place where earth and sky connectand the lights of the sky, the stars, are born. In most myths, this connectionis created by means of the World Tree, the unmoving axis around which creationrevolves. Associated with this axis are two “gates,” or alignments, whoseintersection forms the Great Cross. Most often, this mythic point of contactfalls on the intersection, or crossing point, of the galactic and eclipticplane.6 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm6]A river or a road has almost universally been the symbol of the Milky Way, thelargest and most spectacular object in the night sky. Sometimes, as at Misminay,an actual river mirrors the river in the sky. In ancient Egypt, it was the Nilethat became the terrestrial counterpart of the celestial river; in India, theGanges fulfilled the same function. As a road, it was thought to be the path ofsouls, entering and leaving this plane of existence through the “gates” at thegalactic-ecliptic crossing points. This belief survived in Europe in thetraditional association of the pilgrim route with the Milky Way: from variousplaces in France, the arms and edges of the galaxy, through the center of thegalaxy, symbolized by the mountain passes east of Hendaye, and on to theopposite arm of the galaxy at Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain.7[36_endnote-title.html#mmm7]The World Tree stands at the center, where the roads meet, connecting the crossin the sky, the zenith alignment of the galactic-ecliptic crossing, with thecross on the ground, in the form of a crossroads, a chapel, a temple, or acathedral. As the self-fertilizing Atum point, it is both a womb and a phallus,and to the Greeks it was known as omphalos, literally “mother’s penis” or“navel.” The stone in the center of Cusco, another “omphalos” point, served thesame function by demarcating the quarters of heaven and earth and the majoralignments of celestial events. This locator stone is very similar in concept toHewitt’s carved linga stone, the cross at Hendaye, and to the intellectualidealization of the philosopher’s stone and the Stone, the “lapsit exillis,” ofthe Grail. It also suggests the cubic Cybele stone, whose removal from theancient highlands of Anatolia made Rome the center of the world.To the Finno-Ugaric tribes that once stretched from Finland and Lapland towestern Siberia, this talismanic tree-stone-star was called the sampo, amysterious model of the universe created by Ilmarenin, the Finnish version ofVulcan or Wayland the Smith. The root of this word, sm, is very similar to theEgyptian word sma, which denotes the concept of the two powers or forces thatbalance the axis pole of creation. In Sanskrit, the word for pole or pillar isskhamba. These linguistic similarities among widely differing cultures suggestthat there is a connection between them, at least at the level of their symbolicfunction as metaphors for the unmoving axis of creation.8[36_endnote-title.html#mmm8]To embody these metaphors was, as we saw among the Incas, to become the SapaInca, the divine god-man, Horus the pharaoh, the Sun King, or the Christlikeredeemer Viracocha. These metaphors point to a successful completion of thequest by the hero/warrior/saint. These are beings that have become the AdamKadmon, the universal man in tune with the sentience of all Mind in theuniverse, and the road or path to that attainment is the hero’s journey, aninner and outer quest for the Holy Grail.Alberto Villoldo, in his studies with the Quechua shamans of Peru, came to theconclusion that the current “Pachacuti,” the time when everything is turnedupside down and reality is restructured, is also the point where a new humanity,a Homo luminous, begins to emerge.9 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm9] Villoldo’s Homoluminous sounds much like the Tibetan concept of the Diamond Imperishable Body,as mentioned in chapter 12 [26_chapter-title-14.html]. Could this also be anexpression of the Sapa Inca, Atum-Re, or Universal Man? Indeed, when we look atIndia and Tibet’s foremost example of the attainment of the Diamond Body,Padmasambhava, we find not only linguistic echoes of our primal myths—padma is“lotus” in Sanskrit, echoing the lotus bud of Atum, and sambhava is“self-created one,” from the same root as skhamba, which is the pole or pillarof the unmoving axis—but also a mythic framework that is still psychicallyactive and contains all the motifs presented to us by Fulcanelli and the Hendayecross, from a place of refuge at the time of the catastrophe to alchemy andimmortality.And so, having found Atlantis and the last catastrophe in the Andes, we must nowturn to the East, toward Shambhala and the coming apocalypse.LOOKING EAST: A REFUGE IN THE HIMALAYASPaul Mevryl, in his “Epilogue in Stone,” directs us to Jean-Julien Champagne’sfrontispiece to Le Mystère, where “the alchemist stands elevated and protectedbetween the front paws of the Sphinx,” looking east to the rising sun.10[36_endnote-title.html#mmm10] As we saw in chapter 11[25_chapter-title-13.html], this is the place to stand to decode theastronomical riddle of the Great Cross at Hendaye. Mevryl is quite aware of thissolution; he suggests that man and Sphinx “wait together for the return ofHorus-in-the-horizon,” which is a direct reference to the rising of Leo on thefall equinox of 2002, a return, after 13,000 years, of the equinoxHorus-in-the-horizon. But could this image also point to another place ofrefuge, as Mevryl implies?He [the alchemist] and Hu [the Sphinx] his protector, stare silently at theeastern horizon towards ancient Petra. In their narrow cone of vision is littleJudea to the north and Ha’il to the south. Between them, very far away, is theAnde of Asia—the mighty Himalaya. Man and Hu-man wait together for the return ofHorus-in-the-horizon. For now, in this Age, he will appear before them ratherthan behind their backs. . . . But Man and Human alike regard the future, notthe past.Hu’s protection is twofold. Firstly, He symbolizes the protection of theilluminated state. Secondly, His gaze directs our attention towards one of thegreat refuges that man undoubtedly used during the Atlantean catastrophe. Arefuge which, with others, may serve again? With these thoughts in mind, we notethe similarity between the sound-forms of Cat Man Hu and Katmandhu, and thepersistent legends of concealed entrances into the bowels of the mountains thatare associated with that place.11 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm11]To Mevryl, the place of refuge is clearly in the Himalayas, even though theinscription on the Hendaye cross points, by means of the anagram we examined inchapter 11 [25_chapter-title-13.html], to Peru. Mevryl, in his somewhat torturedanagram of the inscription, draws attention to Ha’il in Saudi Arabia, but, withthe exception of the odd use of Ande in reference to the Himalayas, Mevrylignores any connection to South America. At first, we were inclined to see thisas an example of Mevryl’s finely honed sense of misdirection, but afterfollowing our Peru interpretation and finding Atlantis in the Andes, we returnedto Mevryl with new appreciation.His insistence that we should look east from the Sphinx, along the 30-degreelatitude line, does in fact bring us to the “Ande of Asia—the mighty Himalaya”(note the singular) in the form of Mount Kailas, which sits just north of the30-degree-east line. This stand-alone, A-shaped mountain, sacred to both Hindusand Buddhists, rises like a great planetary omphalos from the highest plateau onearth to almost 26,000 feet. It is also the origin point for the four greatrivers of Asia, the Indus, the Sutlej, the Brahmaputra, and the Ganges, whichspin out from its base in the rough form of a sun wheel or swastika. Beyondthat, just below the line, is the Tibetan capital of Lhasa at 90 degrees eastlongitude, exactly 60 degrees east of the Sphinx at Giza.And, without struggling for any green-language combination of Cat, Man, and Hu,Katmandu is simply the ancient Nepalese word for “place of refuge.”12[36_endnote-title.html#mmm12] Mevryl then is forcing us to look in the directionof Nepal and Tibet. When we do, we find a semi-historical illuminated master,Padmasambhava, who hid teachings, texts, and treasures in statues, cliff faces,and sacred lakes and arranged secret places of refuge from one end of theHimalayas to the other. Behind these legends looms a lost civilization thatrivals Atlantis for antiquity. Unlike Atlantis, this civilization supposedlystill exists in, to quote Fulcanelli, a place “where death cannot reach man atthe time of the double catastrophe.”13 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm13]image [images/image422-00.jpg]Once, a long time ago, according to the ancient Newarri chronicles of Nepal, thevalley was a vast lake called the Nag Hrad, or Tank of Serpents. The nagas weredragon-serpents who guarded a treasure deep in the lake. A Buddha from a pastage tossed a lotus seed into its placid waters, and from this grew an amazingthousand-petaled lotus that shone with the blue light of transcendental wisdom.Aeons went by. And then, one day, the bodhisattva Manjusri, a central Asianversion of Apollo, who, having heard tales of the lotus and its light, arrivedat the lotus lake to contemplate its splendor. He stopped at the edge and, beingthwarted by the nagas, found that he could not approach the lotus. However,after consulting with Vajra Yogini, a manifestation of Dolma/Tara the mothergoddess, he decided on a radical plan. He would drain the lake, bind the nagas,and thereby share the lotus light with everyone.Seizing the great Sword of Discriminating Wisdom, Manjusri sliced themountainous rim of the valley in a single stroke, creating a gorge through whichthe waters of the lake, and its nagas, poured. As the water rushed out, thenagas were caught in a bottomless pit, where, along with their treasure, theyremain to this day. The lotus settled to a small mound in the center of theemerging valley, eventually to become the stupa of Swayambunath.14[36_endnote-title.html#mmm14]Now, the curious point here is that geology agrees with and supports the myth.Roughly 15,000 years ago, an earthquake did in fact drain the vast lake that wasNepal valley, slicing open the rim as neatly as if it had been done with asword. The lake formed as much as a million years earlier when the Himalayaslurched upward. Therefore, for many thousands of years, there was indeed alarge, deep lake of placid blue water surrounded by high, white-topped mountainsjust as the traditions say. All we are missing is the giant lotus, radiatingblue light.The Newarri chronicles continue in a similar vein, telling tales of gods inhuman form and of kings with the power of gods and of their interaction. In thismagical era, a single king could rule for a thousand years and temples wereendowed with images of the gods who sweated, bled, and spoke as theycommunicated their desires. This sense of a magical reality within amythological landscape remains strong even today in Nepal.Buddhism arrived in the valley very early, so early, in fact, that it becamewoven into the fabric of its mythological past. During the reign of thesemilegendary Kiratis—whose founder, Yalambar, fought and died in the epicstruggle depicted in the Mahabharata—the Buddha and his disciple Ananda visitedthe valley. They founded a school in Patan, where the Buddha elevated a familyof blacksmiths to goldsmith status and gave them his own clan name, Sakya.A few centuries later, the great Indian emperor Ashoka, a convert to Buddhism,made a pilgrimage to the Buddha’s birthplace at Lumbini, in the terai, or plain,to the south, and then continued on to Kathmandu valley. He built and enlargedstupas at Patan and Swayambunath, and his daughter married the local prince,Devapala. This link to the original Indian traditions ensured that Buddhismwould survive in Nepal long after it had died out in India.At the turn of the fourth century C.E., the last Kirati king, Gastee, wasoverwhelmed by an invasion of Rajaput princes from the areas of Bihar and UttarPradesh in India. The Licchavi princes spread a veneer of Hinduism over thelocal Buddhism, creating a unique mixture of practical shamanism andsophisticated philosophy. This Nepalese Buddhism owed as much to Rajaput Tantraas it did to the teachings of Siddhartha.Later branches of the Licchavis, the Thakuris, were instrumental in bringingBuddhism to Tibet. Princess Bhrikuti brought some of the Buddha’s relics withher when she married the king of Tibet, Tsrong-tsong Gompo, and eventuallyconverted him. For her devotion, she was identified with Tara, the Tibetanmother goddess.After this high point, the Thakuri dynasties settled into a kind ofsemi-mythological Dark Age. An example is the story of King Gunakamadeva. Itseems that the god Indra, whose interest in the valley went back to theprimordial blue lotus era, assumed human form to observe the Indrajatra festivalin his honor. A group of tantric magicians spotted him and bound him with spellsuntil he granted them a boon. Indra’s boon was the wood from a celestial tree,used by the king to construct a large seven-tiered pagoda called theKasthamandap, or the Wooden House of Refuge. From this came Kathmandu as timechipped away at the extra syllables.15 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm15]In these legends, we can see echoes of our primal theme. The bluelight lotus isthe ancient primal center, dislodged by a catastrophe caused by the Tibetan sungod Manjusri. This center is then represented, in the same spot, by a stupa, anarrangement of the elemental shapes into an omphalos-like locator stone/tree.This same stupa/pagoda design, seen in the architecture of the originalKasthamandap, can be found throughout Buddhist Asia, from China to Burma. In theoriginal hidden valley of Nepal, the place of refuge was clearly a magicallyconstructed model of the World Tree.However, long before the Kasthamandap was built, Nepal was a place of sacredpilgrimage. The caves in the south rim of the valley had an ancient history ofuse by traveling saints and yogis as meditation sites, going back, according tolegend, to the time before the lake was drained. Indra himself was thought tohave spent a few aeons contemplating the blue light from a cave high on thesouth wall of the valley. At some point after the lotus disappeared, a demon,one of the asuras, occupied the cave. He was still in residence, according tothe local tradition, until the arrival of Guru Padmasambhava, who converted himto Buddhism and then occupied his cave for the attainment of his DiamondImperishable Body.Exactly when this occurred is obscure. The dating in the Newarri chroniclessuggests that Padmasambhava’s retreat occurred during the reign of the lastKirati king, Gastee, in the late third century C.E., but Tibetan sources, suchas Yeshe Tsogyal’s biography of Padmasambhava, point to an even earlier date,apparently in the era immediately before Ashoka in the second century B.C.E.Indications in some of Padmasambhava’s teachings, given to Yeshe and others inTibet, suggest that he was influenced by Rajaput Tantrism, and thereforeBuddhist scholars have surmised that he learned his tantric Buddhism in Nepalbetween the fifth and seventh centuries C.E.16 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm16]This is much closer in time to his historical appearance in the eighth centuryin Tibet, and therefore relieves the scholars of the burden of an individualalmost a thousand years old when he first appears in the historical record.Whatever the date when Padmasambhava settled in the Asura Cave, there can belittle doubt that something spectacular occurred there as a result of hispractices. On the floor of the cave can still be seen the melted-rock handprintthat was left as a symbol of the attainment of the Diamond Body (see fig. 13.6).The entire hillside—from the riverside temple, to Kali and Durga in the tinyvillage of Pharping, up the ancient steps past the Vajra-Yogini shrine, andfarther up the mountain, past the Ganesh shrine where a miraculous image of Tarais slowly growing outward from the rock, and on past the crossroads village andthe Tibetan monastery—is imbued with a sense of light and transformation that isas palpable as the smell of incense and yak-butter lamps.In front of the cave is a large flat space where one can sit and meditate on theentire range of the White Himalayas, with the peak of Chomolungma, the Mother ofthe Gods, Mount Everest, directly opposite to the north. Just to the east ofChomolungma is the White Mountain, Macherma Ri, and just beyond it can be seenthe peak of Kangtega. Somewhere in between these two mountains is a real placeof refuge on Mevryl’s sight line from the sphinx—the hidden valley ofKhembalung.PADMASAMBHAVA AND THE TEMPLE OF THE COSMOSSometime after 760 C.E., the king of Tibet, Tsrong-tsong Gompo’s son Tri-TsrongDe-tsen, summoned the most famous Buddhist tantrist of the era, GuruPadmasambhava, to help overcome the magical resistance of the older shamanisticBön-pos. Buddhism had been brought to Tibet by his mother, Princess Bhrikuti ofNepal, and the king was determined to make it stick. However, the power of theBön-pos had proved so far irresistible, and the new faith made little headway.Santaraksita, the king’s Buddhist adviser, suggested bringing in the help of areal magician, the legendary Lotus-Born One, and so the call went out.image [images/image426-00.jpg]Figure 13.6. Handprint of Padmasambhava melted into the rock at the entrance tothe Asura Cave. (Photo by Vincent Bridges)The king’s envoys found Guru Padmasambhava in retreat near the great cities ofthe Ganges plain, and intrigued by the king’s entreaties, he agreed to come toTibet. “In the earth-male-tiger year, on the fifteenth day of the wintermidmoon, under the sign of the Pleiades, he set out on his way,” Yeshe Tsogyal’sbiography informs us.17 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm17] The guru lingered forthree months in Nepal, visiting old meditation retreats and hiding termas forfuture use in caves and temples, until on the first day of the first summer moonhe had a dream in which all the trees of India and Nepal pointed their cresttoward Tibet, and all the flowers opened their blossoms. In that moment, we aretold, all the wise men of Asia had a vision: the union of the sun and the moonrising over Tibet, the new dharma refuge in the darkness of the Kali Yuga.Guru Padmasambhava and his retinue of students and disciples set out over thehigh mountain passes for Tibet. Just inside Tibet, at Tengboche Monastery in theshadow of Chomolungma, he was met by the head of the Bön-pos and challenged to amagical contest.18 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm18] The first one to reach thesummit of Chomolungma would be acclaimed the greatest of all. Padmasambhavaaccepted, and then retired to his tent for a good night’s sleep. The Bön-polama, however, had a magic flying drum with which he planned to fly to thesummit during the hours of darkness and so reach the top early in the morning,just as Padmasambhava had begun.His students spotted the Bön-po lama flying on his drum in the moonlight andwent to awaken the guru. He responded that there was no cause for alarm, eventhough the Bön-po was already halfway up the mountain, and that they shouldsleep while they could. Just before dawn, the guru arose, positioned himself formeditation on the rising sun, and waited, deep in trance. As the Bön-po lama,exhausted by his all-night drumming flight, slowly circled toward the peak, thefirst ray of the rising sun pierced the gloom. Guru Padmasambhava mounted thesunray and flew instantly to the topmost peaks, seating himself on the Throne ofGold and Garnet. Abashed, the Bön-po lama fled, his magic drum tumbling down themountain.While seated on the throne, Guru Padmasambhava looked out to the northeasttoward the snowfields of Khumbu. Looking closer, he saw a perfect hidden valley,tucked away deep within the surrounding peaks and snowfields. Having the gift ofseeing into time, Padmasambhava called upon the gods of the five directions, theDhyani Buddhas, to hide the valley from the world and to provide for it all theneeds of life. He declared that the hidden valley, Khembalung, would be a refugefor a time in the future when the barbarians of “Hor” would invade the centralAsian plateau. He also predicted the names, in Tibetan, of its discoverers andthe times in which its existence would be revealed, and hid as a terma aguidebook to its location.19 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm19]In the fifteenth century, a lama, Padma Lingba, found such a terma guide to thehidden valley and produced another prophecy of its use as a place of refuge. In1976, Edwin Bernbaum, an American climber and Tibetan scholar, followed thedirections in Padma Lingba’s guide and, with the help of several local lamas andhis Sherpa guides, actually found and entered the outer valley of Khembalung.“The next morning, when we went exploring, we found an invisible palace in thebeautiful forest of pine and rhododendron that filled the valley,” Bernbaumexplains, waxing poetic. “We heard the clear voices of birds singing to oneanother and saw the golden mist rising like smoke off the treetops. In the woodsaround us, drops of bluish water gleamed like diamonds on necklaces of hangingmoss. Passing through corridors of trees, we came to sunlit clearings hung withtapestries of rich brown shadows and emerald leaves, And as we went deeper intothe forest, through gaps in the foliage, we glimpsed and felt the presence of amajestic snow peak that seemed to rule over the valley, like the King ofKhembalung.”20 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm20]Guru Padmasambhava came down from Chomolungma after sealing the place of refugeand proceeded toward central Tibet. Along the way, he was met by a delegationfrom the king, which he awed by first throwing their offered gold to the fourwinds. Then, scooping up a handful of dirt as his prima materia, GuruPadmasambhava transmuted it into gold. These triumphs made even the Bön-po intoconverts, and Padmasambhava continued on to Samye, where a mandala-shapedmonastery was under construction. Using his command of the spirit world,Padmasambhava caused Samye chokor, the Dharmachakra, to be built in the grandpattern of the Indian vihara, or plan of the cosmos.21[36_endnote-title.html#mmm21]From the spiny ridge to the east of Samye, where a Bön-po temple once stood andPadmasambhava sat in meditation while Samye was built, the complex of templesand chapels surrounded by a flattened ellipse can be seen in all its grandeur,despite over twelve hundred years of use and misuse. At night, as in the Andeanhighlands of Peru, the river of the galaxy dominates the night sky, stretchingat its summer zenith from northwest to southeast, with its bulging center highoverhead. As at Misminay, the pattern of Samye chokor matches the path of thegalaxy in the sky with its satellite chapels or lings, while the mainstructures, including the central Utse Rigsum, form the cardinal cross of thedirections. The Utse Rigsum acts as the central omphalos and World Tree, and onthe outside walls can still be seen vast cosmological murals and depictions ofSamye in its glory.22 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm22]Along that northwest line, the celestial road of the galaxy from Samye, is theholy city of Lhasa. If we think of this axis as the galactic axis, then Samyelies on the edge of the galaxy, with Lhasa at its center. The palace of the kingwas there, atop the jagged ridge of Marpo Ri, and the most ancient center ofTibetan civilization, the Jokang Temple, stood nearby. Eventually, the Marpo Riwould become the Potala Palace, and Lhasa itself would become the absolutecenter of Tibetan life, both political and spiritual.Standing on the roof of the Jokang Temple and looking west, back toward MountKailas and beyond to Mevryl’s Sphinx, 60 degrees of latitude away in Egypt, wenote immediately the alignment of two large hills, Chakpo Ri and Bompo Ri, onthe due west line (fig. 13.7). Even the modern work of the Communist Chinese,when they rebuilt this avenue, follows the ancient path of the alignmentstraight to the Jokang. In the Serpent’s Cave, on the northeastern side ofChakpo Ri, is a model of Samye, complete with supposedly self-generated stonestatutes of the five Buddhas. This repeating pattern of how the cosmos aligns tocreate time and the meaning of time forms the center of the center, the pointfrom which the dharma radiates throughout the land.When his work was finished, Padmasambhava departed Tibet for the CopperMountains of the southwest. Before he left, he gave a series of predictions andprophecies to his main followers. These included instructions on how to find thetermas he left behind, as well as predictions and pointers to the time of thecoming destruction: “When the iron bird flies, and houses run on wheels, theDharma will come to the land of the Red Man. Know, by these signs, that the ageof darkness is ending.”23 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm23] He also leftinstructions for the opening of the hidden valleys, such as Khembalung, andpredicted that they would be needed at a time when the demons had been releasedby the barbarians and Tibet had fallen to unbelievers in the dharma.24[36_endnote-title.html#mmm24]image [images/image429-00.jpg]Figure 13.7. Looking west from Jokang Temple, Lhasa, along Mevyrl’s Sphinx line.The two hills between the modern office blocks are Chakpo Ri and behind itBompo-Ri. (Photo by Vincent Bridges)Such a moment has perhaps arrived. The dharma is fading in Tibet, even as it istaking root in strange ways in the West. Many Tibetan refugees have indeed fledto protected valleys, such as Nepal, in the fringes of the Himalayas. ButPadmasambhava left us no further clues to the opening of the hidden valleys, noexact timing on which to hang a date or a time period. While Padmasambhavaclearly saw the need for a place of refuge, a science of timing andtransformation didn’t arrive in Tibet for another two hundred and fifty years.The Kalachakra, or Wheel of Time, Tantra, introduced in 1027 C.E., brought itwith a message from the hidden kingdom of Shambhala.SHAMBHALA AND THE WHEEL OF TIMEThe legends of a hidden civilization somewhere in central Asia have a longhistory, and as recently as the last century, this history could still influenceworld politics. The invasion of Tibet by British troops in 1904 was caused by amistaken opinion on the part of some Tibetans that the czar of Russia was theking of Shambhala.25 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm25] In the 1930s, the idea of alost valley in the Himalayas exploded on the mass consciousness with JamesHilton’s best seller, The Lost Horizon, based in part on the experiences of areal Christian monk who converted to Buddhism in the seventeenth century.Shangri-la, the name of the hidden monastery in Hilton’s book, became a kind ofsynonym for all hidden valleys and places of refuge. FDR, when asked where theplanes came from that bombed Tokyo in the spring of 1942, replied simply,“Shangri-la.” Roosevelt had his own “Shangri-la,” a hideaway in the MarylandHills now called Camp David.26 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm26]While most Westerners think of Tibet itself as the hidden kingdom, the Tibetanslook to another, even more hidden land as the source of wisdom and inspiration.There, a line of enlightened dharma kings guard the most secret teachings of theBuddha, the Kalachakra Tantra. At the end of time, when the dharma is in dangerof being totally destroyed by the barbarians of the age of darkness, the KaliYuga, the king of Shambhala will emerge from the hidden land, defeat the forcesof evil, and usher in a millennium of peace and prosperity.The legends and ancient texts also say that it is possible, though verydifficult and dangerous, to travel to the hidden kingdom and there learn theKalachakra firsthand. Curiously, all versions of the route to the hidden kingdombegin with the planetary omphalos on Mevryl’s Sphinx line, Mount Kailas.27[36_endnote-title.html#mmm27]Our earliest glimpse of a hidden paradise to the north populated by sages comesfrom the Mahabharata, the vast epic of Vedic India. The main character, Arjuna,a cousin of the king of Nepal, Yalambar, who founded the Kirati dynasty, travelsto border of the mysterious land of Uttarakuru but fails to enter. His routetakes him to Mount Kailas, and then northwest, along the galactic axis, to thehidden paradise. To the Bön-po, Uttarakuru was known as Olmolungring, and italso lay to the northwest of Mount Kailas. One of the many Tibetan guides toShambhala also suggests that the route is northwest from Mount Kailas to theregion of Kashmir, and then farther north.It is possible that this hidden kingdom was once a real country, somewhere inthe region of the Tarim basin, north of Kashmir. Certainly, many ancientkingdoms, some of them Buddhist, flourished and died along the ancient SilkRoute from China to the West, and the legend of Shambhala may have such akingdom as its inner kernel of truth. But the idea of the hidden kingdom ofenlightened sages goes deeper than just an ancient city-state, no matter howwell organized and progressive it may have been. Like Atlantis, the myth ofShambhala points to an ancient cosmic unity of earth and sky.This becomes apparent when we examine the principal symbolic feature ofShambhala, its eight-petaled, lotus-shaped design. The lotus as a symbol ofcompleteness and attainment goes all the way back to Atum and the cosmic ocean.Shambhala is a version of the vihara, or cosmic pattern, the Dharmachakradisplayed at Samya chokor, and the union of the Saint Andrew’s solstice crossand the Saint George equinox cross, which represents the complete alignment ofthe Cube of Space, as does the Hendaye cross, as we saw in chapter 11[25_chapter-title-13.html]. As shown in figure 13.8, the eight-petaled lotus,according to some Tibetan teachers, symbolizes the eight nerve channels thatradiate from the heart center.28 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm28]In physical terms, Shambhala is depicted as a ring of 108 snowcapped mountains.Within it are ninety-six principalities or local regions divided into eightcountries (see fig. 13.9) of twelve principalities each. The center regionconsists of a central five-tiered mountain, or stupa, surrounded by four smallerhills marking the intercardinal directions. Each of these locations is said tohave seventy-two devas, or god-like sages, within them. At the very center isthe throne of the king of Shambhala. All of these numbers are related toprecession: 96 × 270 = 108 × 240 = (5 × 72) × 72 = 25,920. As we saw withAtlantis, this mandala design echoes both internal and external systems andunites them with a sense of cosmology that is little short of remarkable for anyera.29 [36_endnote-title.html#mmm29]Also, as with Atlantis, Shambhala is connected with the last catastrophe. Theolder, non-Buddhist versions of the legend point to the founding of Shambhalaaround 13,000 years ago. The Bön-po claim that Olmolungring was founded afterthe last catastrophe and that once every 13,000 years, another Bön-po exemplarenters the world to renew and revitalize the ancient teachings. The remainingBön-po sects eagerly await such an exemplar. The Mahabharata also places thefounding of Uttarakuru at the turn of the last golden age, roughly 13,000 yearsago, as we saw in chapter 10 [24_chapter-title-12.html].image [images/image432-00.jpg]Figure 13.8. Correspondence between the lotus shape and the nerves of the heartcenter in the Tibetan tradition. Redrawn from Bernbaum. Compare thiscorrespondence to the plan of Shambhala in fig. 13.9.image [images/image433-00.jpg]Figure 13.9. A drawing of the kingdom of Shambhala, surrounded by 108 snowcappedmountains and divided into eight countries. (Stylized representation fromBernbaum)To the Buddhists, the history of Shambhala began when King Sucandra learned theKalachakra from the last great teaching of the Buddha in the late sixth centuryB.C.E. He took this ultimate wisdom back to Shambhala, where it flourished andgrew until the middle of the tenth century. A young Indian yogi named Tsilupatraveled, like Arjuna, to the edges of the northern paradise, where he metManjusri, who taught him the Kalachakra and sent him back to India.Whether or not Tsilupa actually met Manjusri on the road to Shambhala, scholarshave determined that the Kalachakra was practiced and taught in Kashmir by 960C.E. This brings us to an interesting point. Both Kashmir and points farthernorth on the Silk Road had prominent Jewish communities in the ninth and tenthcenturies. Could the legend of Shambhala have been grafted on to an early formof the kabbalistic Bahir? And would the result have been the unusual complexityand astronomical involvement found in the outer teachings of the Kalachakra?Could the Kalachakra be a Buddhist version of the ancient Hebrew illuminatedastronomy?In the 1020s, another Indian yogi, Somanatha, brought the Kalachakra to Tibetand created the official chronology of Tibetan history. The astronomicalcalendar of the Kalachakra would spread across China, becoming eventually theelemental animals of Chinese restaurant menus. In Tibet it would have manyapplications, including the prophecy that 960 (10 for each principality inShambhala) years after the introduction of the Kalachakra, the keys toShambhala, or the clues to its reappearance, would be found. A teaching of thefirst Karmapa, one of the founders of the Karma Kagyu school, relates that afterthe 960 years have passed comes a period of 25 years, five times through thefive elements, in which the cycle of time comes to an end and the wisdom king ofShambhala will return to this world in the form of the female water dragon. Bythis measure, 960 + 1027 = 1987 + 25 = 2012; we are in the period of turmoil atthe moment. Note also how closely this matches Fulcanelli’s season ofdestruction.Even the orthodox Tibetan sects, such as the Gelugpa, whose leader is the DalaiLama, consider that twenty-five hundred years after the Dharma reachedShambhala, around the sixth century B.C.E., the twenty-fifth king, Rudra Kalkin,would emerge and defeat the barbarians, ushering in the new golden age. Evenwith some looseness, it is very close to twenty-five hundred years since thetime of the Buddha. And even though this is not openly expressed, it may beconsidered the driving force behind the Dalai Lama’s campaign to initiate asmany people as possible, in the time remaining, into the Kalachakra Tantra.30[36_endnote-title.html#mmm30]"},{"pageContent":"FOURTEENALCHEMY AND TRANSCENDENCEimage [images/image435-00.jpg]Our quests led us from Egypt, to Europe, then onto Peru and Atlantis, beyond that to Tibet, India, and Nepal, and finally backto where we started, Egypt. In that long journey, we discovered early on that“alchemy,” in the sense of turning base metal into gold, was merely a by-productof a much greater attainment. That the transmutation of metals was possible, andhad in fact been part of the historical record from the fourteenth centuryon—right up to the twentieth century if we are to believe the legendssurrounding Fulcanelli—seemed less important than what such a transmutation saidabout the nature of reality and the significance of enlightenment.In the end, we discovered that alchemy actually is transcendence, the goal andthe method united in one “process” that is ultimately never ending. The natureof that transcendence seems to be a gnosis about the nature of the cosmos, analignment of inner centers—chakras or sefirot—with the outer alignments of theCube of Space-Time. The inner “golden age” aligns the internal structure ofone’s cosmos with the Golden Age in the sky, bringing on a personal apokalypsis,or unveiling of the mysteries. When this happens, consciousness and the physicalbody are transformed. If the person has available to him the “skillful means”developed by other initiates who have had the same experience, then he evolvestoward what Alberto Villoldo called the Homo luminous, the Diamond ImperishableBody. If not, then the results are incomplete, and sometimes disastrous.In the story of the Djedi and King Khufu and in that of Padmasambhava and KingTri-Tsrong De-tsen of Tibet told in chapter 13 [28_chapter-title-15.html], wecan see a basic pattern. Both “magicians” are immortal, or virtually so, andhave command of the life force in unusual ways. Their names or titles aresimilar, the “Stable One” of the Djed has the same implications as the“Lotus-Born One” of the skhamba or cosmic axis, and they both possess the secretto a model of space-time. In the case of the Djedi, these were the monuments onGiza and the mysterious text hidden in Heliopolis; in the case of Padmasambhava,it was the plan of the Dharmachakra of Samye chokor and eventually, the text ofthe Kalachakra. In both cultures, we find legends of a lost, or hidden, advancedcivilization: Atlantis from Egypt, by way of the Greeks, and Shambhala in Tibet.These similarities ultimately help us understand Fulcanelli and Le Mystère decathédrales. When we follow all the clues, run down all the threads and hints,we arrive at a few basic conclusions.Fulcanelli is directing us to a time period, the twelfth and thirteenthcenturies, when a coalition of initiates managed to have the text of the mysterycarved onto the architectural structures designed to facilitate the personalalignment and gnosis of those who could read the mystery from the books of stoneand then use the practical implications within the cathedral itself. In thisway, Notre-Dame-de-Paris and Samye chokor are the same concept, modified only bythe culture in which they were created. But the function, the connection of theinner and outer alignments of space-time, is virtually the same.Our second conclusion concerns the Hendaye cross. It is also a model of theproper golden-age alignment of inner and outer realities, and a marker of theexact time period, now and for the next decade or so, in which thesecosmological myths, these intrusions of mythic time, will be played out in thesky. In this way, the Hendaye cross truly is the philosopher’s stone, becauseunless one understands the alignments in the sky depicted on the cross—that is,unless one has the key to the mystery—then even the greatest of these monumentsto the end of time, from Notre Dame to Giza and Samye, are but mute wondersbuilt for obscure reasons by people in the distant past.Our third conclusion is a little more complex. It concerns the role of light inenlightenment. The Pyramid Texts suggest that after death, the pharaoh wasreborn with Osiris in the star fields of Orion, which are a mere seventylight-years away and the closest area of stellar creation to our solar system.The pharaoh attained immortality in these star fields as he passed in deathalong the path of Nun, which in Egyptian is the word for the primeval ether soupout of which all creation arose, through the area of stellar formation in thebody of Orion. Thus, by being reborn as a star in Osiris’s company, the pharaohreenacted on a local level the original creation of the universe.But to attain this star birth in the bardo, or transition state, of Orionrequired first of all that the pharaoh understand the “number of the shrines ofthe secret chamber of the enclosure of Tehuti.” As we saw above, this numberingof shrines creates the throne of Osiris, the Pyramid complex, from which, as thesoul star place, the pharaoh made the jump to a light body in Orion, becomingthereby a new Osiris. We can see this same function in the grand design of Samyechokor, with the exception that becoming a star body, and thereby leaving thisplane entirely, is not part of its plan. Unlike the pharaoh, when Padmasmbhavabecame a “new Osiris” in a light-body state comparable perhaps to a living star,he did not leave for Orion. He stayed on to help the rest of us make thetransition.And this brings us to the point of our conclusion. Alchemy may in fact be assimple as: Changes in the nature of Light create changes in the Mind of nature.And the shift of the age in the sky signals a profound change in the nature ofboth Mind and Light. It was this sense of impending change, even catastrophicchange, that drove the cathedral-building frenzy in the thirteenth century andeventually led to Fulcanelli’s message in a bottle, Le Mystère des cathédrales,in the twentieth century.In the end, we can do no better than agree with Fulcanelli when he says: “I askfor neither remembrance nor gratitude, but only that you should take the sametrouble for others as I have taken for you.” It is our hope that in this book,we have followed his instructions, becoming, along with Fulcanelli, “a beacon onthe great highway of the esoteric Tradition.”"},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUEFULCANELLI REVEALEDimage [images/image438-00.jpg]In the end, one final mystery remains. Thequestion of Fulcanelli’s identity haunts all the other mysteries like the shadowof a high-flying bird on a sunny day. We can see his absence, the shadow, butwhen we look for the bird itself, we are blinded by the sun’s brilliance. InFulcanelli’s case, the brilliance is that of the gnosis and intelligence of hisworks, and, just as with the sun, this intense light makes it hard to find thebird, the personality, casting the shadow.When all the pieces of evidence and innuendo are sifted and sorted, we end upwith less than what we had at the beginning. “Fulcanelli” vanishes, leavingapparently only a long series of jokers, pranksters, plagiarists, andsensationalists. The work remains, isolated in context and hermetic in meaning,a true message in a bottle from the last adept. Revealing the levels ofcomplexity in that message, as we have done in this book, leaves us finally witha core of truth, both about ourselves and about the cosmos in which we live.That truth is the secret of alchemy, which perhaps can be revealed, fully, onlyat the end of time.So who was “Fulcanelli”?In chapter 1 [11_chapter-title-3.html] we looked at the Fulcanelli legend as putforth by its main proponent, Eugène Canseliet. This legend, the myth of themissing alchemist, was cultivated by Canseliet and by others in the Brotherhoodof Heliopolis for reasons of their own, and was meant both to reveal a truth andto conceal an even more important one, Fulcanelli’s true identity. The truth itreveals is that the current of the underground stream actually survived into thetwentieth century; what it conceals is the origin of that current’s survival.In her book Fulcanelli dévoilé,1 [36_endnote-title.html#nnn1] Geneviève Duboisassembled all the circumstantial evidence relating to the initial group ofconspirators, the Brotherhood of Heliopolis. Her conclusion, that “Fulcanelli”was the result of the combined work of Pierre Dujols, Champagne, and Canseliet,is the only plausible explanation that fits a majority of the demonstratedfacts. We may suppose that Canseliet clung to the legend because it sold books;a mysterious alchemist, as immortal as Saint Germain, sounds much better as aselling point than a collective work from a group of occultists. But is thatreally all there is to it?As we worked on the mystery of Le Mystère itself, we eventually re-createdPierre Dujols’s “Library of Marvels” card file. This allowed us to identify anunderlying structure organizing the somewhat overwhelming profusion of imagesand symbols in the text. This structure, simply put, is the four projected Treesof the “Tree of Life on the celestial sphere,” the Cube of Space arrangementfrom the Bahir. As this structure emerged, two things became apparent: TheHendaye chapter, and its images, had in fact originally been intended for LeMystère, and Pierre Dujols was the author of the text of Le Mystère.In chapter 1 [11_chapter-title-3.html], we speculated that the Hendaye chapterwas meant for inclusion in Dwellings of the Philosophers, where the last twochapters touch on many themes, including catastrophes and Atlantis, inherent inthe message of Hendaye’s cross. It could also, we felt, be a fragment ofFulcanelli’s lost last book, Finis Gloria Mundi. Intriguing as thesespeculations were, we couldn’t seem to make the Hendaye piece of the puzzle fitcomfortably in either. And then, rather late in our investigations, it occurredto us that we had been looking at the entire problem presented by the Hendayechapter in the wrong way.The chapter supports the developing pattern of four projected Trees bycompleting the fourth and final Tree, supplying the essential top three sefirot.At the very least, this meant that whoever arranged the second edition knew thebasic structure and reinforced it by adding images correctly. But it is alsojust as likely that Canseliet, in preparing a new edition, simply followed theoriginal pattern, the one intended but not implemented in the 1926 edition. Thequestion of why this was done, why the Hendaye chapter was suppressed, led usindirectly to our second conclusion, that the author of Le Mystère was in factPierre Dujols.The first chapter of Le Mystère is a broad overview in nine sections that, as wesaw in chapters 8 and 9, outlines the first of the four Tree of Life patterns inthe work as a whole. The eighth section deals with the centrally important ideaof the Black Virgins and their connection with Isis and ultimately with Cybeleand the stone that fell from Heaven, the core idea of Wolfram’s Grail romance.At the beginning of this discussion, Fulcanelli quotes a passage from “thelearned Pierre Dujols,” where Isis and the Virgin are identified as part of an“astronomical theogany.” In this somewhat unusual word (see chapter 9[22_chapter-title-11.html]), we find a hint of divine genealogy as well as thesacred union of earth and sky.A few pages later, after listing the ten most significant Black Virgins inFrance, Fulcanelli shifts back to the Dujols comment on a Cybele stone at Die innorthern Provence, and does so with a first-person citation: “I have alreadymentioned that a stone at Die, representing Isis, referred to her as mother ofthe Gods.”2 [36_endnote-title.html#nnn2] Since it is Dujols himself who isquoted regarding the Die stone, we might infer that Fulcanelli is tipping hisPhrygian alchemist cap to his real identity with this first-person nod. Whilethis is not conclusive in and of itself, combined with all the other evidencepresented by Dubois in Fulcanelli dévoilé, it is a very convincing, andrevealing, slip of the pen.So let us accept that the Hendaye chapter was originally part of Le Mystère, andthat Pierre Dujols wrote the whole of that work. In chapter 10[24_chapter-title-12.html], we speculated that the chapter on the cross was notincluded because it pointed too directly to “Fulcanelli’s” true identity andthat of the group around him. If Dujols is the author of Le Mystère and theHendaye chapter, does this still hold true?Indeed it does, but with a twist. The joker, as always in this convoluted story,is Jean-Julien Champagne, the illustrator of both Le Mystère and Dwellings.Some, such as the publisher Jean Schémit, believed that Champagne was“Fulcanelli,” while others, such as René Schwaller de Lubicz, claimed that thecharacter he called Fulcanelli, by implication Champagne, had stolen themanuscript of Le Mystère from him.3 [36_endnote-title.html#nnn3] Only one thingseemed certain: Champagne was the focal point around which the Fulcanelli legendoriginally swirled. And from this seemingly solid fact would come much futuremystification.But, in fact, neither the author of the text, Dujols, nor its illustrator,Champagne, was “Fulcanelli.” In Le Mystère, the author takes the clear tone of astudent elucidating the work of the master, or masters, from whom he learned hissubject. In the preface to the second edition, Canseliet confirms this byincluding a letter whose “recipient was undoubtedly Fulcanelli’s master,” whichletter was found among Fulcanelli’s papers.4 [36_endnote-title.html#nnn4] It isthis individual, it seems, who has attained the great work, not his student, theauthor of Le Mystère. If this is not even more mystification—and that is alwaysa possibility—then this mysterious master alchemist from the precedinggeneration can be thought of as the real “Fulcanelli,” the source of thecurrent, as it were.It was this train of thought that led us to look at the cross in a completelydifferent light. What if the Hendaye cross and its predecessors, includingperhaps Hewitt’s mysterious carved linga stone, were actually the starting pointof Fulcanelli’s story? Fulcanelli suggests that the base was carved in the1680s, a date that is supported by the degree of weathering on the images. Who,in the 1680s, knew enough to code the complex astronomical and alchemicalinformation into a series of oddly interconnected images on the base of anobscure monument in an obscure corner of the Basque Pyrenees? And why?Just asking these questions sheds new light on the problem of Fulcanelli’sidentity. In chapter 2 [12_chapter-title-4.html], we speculated thatFulcanelli’s purpose, at least in part, was to stand witness to the flowering ofan esoteric tradition in the West that was as profound and transcendent as thatof the East. Fulcanelli traces this lineage, as it would be termed in the East,down to the era in which the Hendaye cross was carved, the mid- to lateseventeenth century. As we saw in chapter 2 [12_chapter-title-4.html], thisperiod falls in the gap between the Rosicrucian movement and the emergence ofFreemasonry. Apparently, the lineage was broken at that point, or at leastportions of it died out or went underground. By the mid-nineteenth century, theWest was so lacking in spiritual exemplars that Theosophy found its masters andmahatmas in the East.Yet both Fulcanelli and the Hendaye cross are evidence that the lineage did notin fact completely disappear. The late seventeenth century was the high-watermark of “scientific” alchemy and the origins of chemistry, as well as thebeginning of astronomy as a science. Louis XIV built the Royal Observatory inParis about the same time the Hendaye cross was carved, and, as Fulcanellireminds us, placed a Black Virgin in its vaults.5 [36_endnote-title.html#nnn5]What seems to have happened is that the lineage shifted from its traditionalchivalric and aristocratic base toward a community of the intellect thatincluded scientists, artists, and writers. This shift started with theRosicrucian movement and gained steam with the early Freemasons.Following the French Revolution and its Napoleonic aftermath, the lineage wasagain in danger of vanishing completely. A few “initiates” remained from theancien régime, and by the 1830s the tradition had begun to revive. Thepublication in 1832 of Hermes dévoilé by the mysterious Cyliani, rumored byCanseliet to be Antoine Dujols, older brother of Pierre, marks the turning pointin the lineage’s revival. The same year also saw the incredible popularity ofVictor Hugo’s Notre-Dame de Paris and the beginning of an upsurge of interest inall things Gothic. Thirteen years later, a young Eugène Viollet-le-Duc wouldbegin the restoration of Notre-Dame-de-Paris itself, his drawings andreconstructions serving eventually as a model for Champagne’s illustrations inLe Mystère.In 1842, the d’Abbadie family in Hendaye moved the cross, with its Meso-Americansun face and coded riddle about Peru, from its original location, possibly inthe church’s graveyard, to its current location on the south side of the church,just a few feet from the village square. That same year, another mysteriousalchemist, one Tiffereau, announced that he had discovered the secret oftransmutation in Mexico. The next year, one of the initiates from the ancienrégime, Louis-Paul-François Cambriel, published the results of twenty years ofresearch. In his Cours de philosophie hermétique, Cambriel, drawing upon theseventeenth-century work of Esprit Gobineau Montluisant, points directly to thecathedrals as hermetic monuments. By 1854, when Louis Figuier published hismassive Alchemy and Alchemists, the idea of a secret alchemical wisdom had beenrevived and the groundwork laid for Fulcanelli/Dujols’s brilliant explication inLe Mystère.6 [36_endnote-title.html#nnn6]Yet somehow, as we sorted through these connections, the Hendaye cross remainedproblematic. The dates that Fulcanelli/Dujols points out for us do seem to havea direct connection to the current and its survival. The mid-seventeenthcentury, when the base of the cross was carved, marked the shift from thechivalric to the artistic as alchemy became chemistry, as well as the firstdirect explanation, in Gobineau’s Explication très curieuse des enigmes etfigures hiéroglyphiques, of the hermetic meaning of the images onNotre-Dame-de-Paris. The 1840s, when the cross was moved to the churchyard, sawa serious alchemical revival, including again the connection to the hermeticfigures on the Gothic cathedrals. These are undoubtedly important time periods,from Fulcanelli’s perspective, but just why the Hendaye cross should be used tomark them remained unclear, particularly in light of the chapter’s suppressionin the first edition.No matter how we shifted the puzzle pieces, the Hendaye chapter remained anoddity. Was it an afterthought, a mere exclamation point to the broader patternof Le Mystère and Dwellings? Or was it the key to the secret of alchemy, themagic thread that unravels the veil and reveals the ultimate mysteries, andtherefore the most important chapter of all in understanding Fulcanelli’smessage? The more convinced we were that the latter was the case, the moresignificant the whole issue of Hendaye became.Working backward from Pierre Dujols brought us to a dead end. There was noevidence that he had ever visited Hendaye, or had any other connection to theregion. Working forward from the nineteenth-century alchemical tradition broughtus to the same impasse: no connection to Hendaye. Pierre Dujols could certainlyhave interpreted the cross in much the same way as we have done in chapter 11[25_chapter-title-13.html]. He had connections to the esoteric currents of hisera, including that of the Paris branch of the Hermetic Order of the GoldenDawn, and so had the symbolism available to him. Indeed, Jules Boucher’sexplanation, a decade after the first edition of Le Mystère, also shows aconnection between the cross and the Tarot symbolism of groups such as theAhathoor Temple of the Golden Dawn. And yet, the direct connection to Hendaye ismissing or obscured.If, as the Hendaye chapter suggests, the Hendaye cross in some way parallels thesurvival of the alchemical lineage, then its importance must have been obscuredpurposefully. We may never know who carved the cross, but we do know whorecognized its importance and moved it to its present location. When we turn tothe d’Abbadie family, and its most prominent member in the mid-nineteenthcentury, Antoine d’Abbadie, the puzzle starts to make more sense.As we noted in chapter 10 [24_chapter-title-12.html], in 1926 members of thed’Abbadie family were still prominent in society. A reference to Hendaye and the1840s would have led directly to the family. Even today, that fact can beobtained with little effort, as the d’Abbadie family crest can still be seen onthe church wall, just below the sundial, while standing at the cross. All ofwhich raises the question of why it was so important to obscure this connection.Could it be hiding the source, as it were, of what later became Le Mystère andDwellings?Antoine d’Abbadie, although almost completely unknown outside of France, was amajor figure in the nineteenth-century scientific community and the president ofthe French Royal Academy of Science in the 1890s. An explorer, linguist,astronomer, collector of folktales and esoteric manuscripts, and a supporter ofthe Gothic revival, Antoine d’Abbadie comes across as a very French predecessorof Indiana Jones. His expeditions included a search for the source of the Nilein Ethiopia, and even in the 1880s, when he was in his seventies, Antoined’Abbadie continued to travel on a series of expeditions based on makingastronomical calculations, including the 1883–84 transit of Venus across theSun. His career parallels the emergence of the almost lost alchemical lineage,and his circle of friends and correspondents included everyone from Victor Hugo,Prosper Mérimée, and Viollet-le-Duc, who designed the Château d’Abbadie atHendaye, to the above-mentioned Louis Figuier, Camille Flammarion, an astronomersometimes considered to be Fulcanelli on the basis of a cipher on the name“Fulcanelli,” Ferdinand de Lesseps, and, most interesting of all, Grassetd’Orcet, the scholar of the green language, the “language of the birds,” quotedby Fulcanelli in the Hendaye chapter.7 [36_endnote-title.html#nnn7]In d’Abbadie’s notes, letters, and published work we come across odd previsionsof concepts that turn up later in Le Mystère and, most of all, Dwellings.Antoine d’Abbadie’s notes from his 1835 tour of England, Ireland, and Scotlandreveal a deep interest in Gothic architecture, including a look at the enigmaticicosahedron at Holyrood Castle in Scotland, discussed at length in Dwellings.His speculations on the connection between the Basques and Atlantis also findtheir way into Dwellings, as do his views on the age of the Sphinx and theantiquity of Egyptian civilization.8 [36_endnote-title.html#nnn8]Could Antoine d’Abbadie be the real, or original, Fulcanelli? And if so, how didthis information come to be in hands of the Dujols brothers and the othermembers of the Brotherhood of Heliopolis? The d’Abbadies were also connected tothe de Lesseps, and through them to Jean-Julien Champagne and R. A. Schwaller deLubicz, and this is a possible avenue of transmission for at least part of theinformation. This also explains Champagne’s attitude and position in the group.He, at the very least, considered himself the link to the “real” Fulcanelli.Could Pierre Dujols also have had a connection to the d’Abbadie family, one thatwas not as direct as Champagne’s?Such a connection seems likely, but to date the solid evidence is lacking.Whether the connection came from Champagne or from Dujols, or both, theconnection was obscured, covered up, and finally confused beyond any resemblanceto reality by the Fulcanelli myth advanced by Canseliet and the others. Antoined’Abbadie was a public figure, a respected scientist and member of theestablishment. Even after his death in 1897, his family remained prominent, andso the need for secrecy concerning a topic as far from the orthodox mainstreamof Victorian science as alchemy is plausible. It is also likely that even themain conspirators of the Brotherhood didn’t know the truth that their mythmakingwas concealing.In a way, this is very satisfying. It forces on us the most important conclusionof all.Fulcanelli is not a person; he is a personification of the tradition, thelineage, as it emerged in the early twentieth century. Pierre Dujols wrote LeMystère to sum up and preserve the teachings of the master, or masters, fromwhom he learned the tradition. He called himself Fulcanelli, which can betranslated as “Vulcan’s children,” or Hephaistoi, or even Kabiroi, the divineblacksmiths who guard the secret of the stone that fell from heaven, to point tothe current’s antiquity as well as, by various permutations and codes, some ofthe prominent members of the group around the original nineteenth-century“Fulcanelli,” Antoine d’Abbadie. Dwellings was pieced together from fragments ofseveral works, some by Dujols based on d’Abbadie’s work and some by Canselietand Champagne, but all written as part of that voice, that spokesman, for thetradition itself.In the end, it is the voice of Fulcanelli’s message that proves more importantthan his identity. In that sense, the legend serves its purpose if, after weundertake the quest, we find the mysterious immortal adept inside ourselves."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX AFULCANELLI ON THE GREEN LANGUAGEChapter 1, section 3, of Le Mystère des cathédralesd[36_footnote-title.html#dfn]image [images/image446-00.jpg]First of all it is necessary for me to say a wordabout the term gothic as applied to French art, which imposed its rules on allthe productions of the Middle Ages and whose influence extends from the twelfthto the fifteenth century.Some have claimed—wrongly—that it came from the Goths, the ancient Germanicpeople. Others alleged that the word, suggesting something barbarous, wasbestowed in derision on a form of art, whose originality and extreme peculiaritywere shocking to the people of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Such isthe opinion of the classical school, imbued with the decadent principles of theRenaissance. But truth, preserved in the speech of the common people, hasensured the continued used of the expression gothic art, in spite of the effortsof the Academy to substitute the term ogival art. There was an obscure reasonfor this, which should have made our linguists ponder, since they are always onthe look-out for the derivation of words. How does it come about that so fewcompilers of dictionaries have lighted upon the right one? The simple fact isthat the explanation must be sought in the cabalistic origin of the word and notin its literal root.Some discerning and less superficial authors, struck by the similarity betweengothic (gothique) and goetic (goetique) have thought that* there must be a closeconnection between gothic art and goetic art i.e., magic.For me, gothic art (art gothique) is simply a corruption of the word argotique(cant), which sounds exactly the same. This is in conformity with the phoneticlaw, which governs the traditional cabala in every language and does not pay anyattention to spelling. The cathedral is a work of art goth (gothic art) or ofargot, i.e. cant or slang. Moreover, dictionaries define argot as a “languagepeculiar to all individuals who wish to communicate their thoughts without beingunderstood by outsiders.” Thus it certainly is a spoken cabala. The argotiers,those who use this language, are the hermetic descendants of the argonauts, whomanned the ship Argo. They spoke the langue argotique—our langue verte (“greenlanguage” or slang)—while they were sailing towards the felicitous shores ofColchos to win the famous Golden Fleece. People still say about a veryintelligent, but rather sly, man: “he knows everything, he understands cant.”All the Initiates expressed themselves in cant; the vagrants of the Court ofMiracles—headed by the poet Villon—as well as the Freemasons of the Middle Ages,“members of the lodge of God,” who built the argotique masterpieces, which westill admire today. Those constructional sailors (nautes) also knew the route tothe Garden of the Hesperides. . . .In our day, cant is spoken by the humble people, the poor, the despised, therebels, calling for liberty and independence, the outlaws, the tramps and thewanderers. Cant is the cursed dialect, banned by high society, by the nobility(who are really so little noble), the well-fed and self-satisfied middle class,luxuriating in the ermine of their ignorance and fatuity. It remains thelanguage of a minority of individuals living outside accepted laws, conventions,customs and etiquette. The term voyous (street-arabs) that is to say voyants(seers) is applied to them and the even more expressive term sons or children ofthe sun. Gothic art is in fact the art got or χοτ—the art of light or of spirit.People think that such things are merely a play on words. I agree. The importantthing is that such word-play should guide our faith towards certainty, towardspositive and scientific truth, which is the key to the religious mystery, andshould not leave us wandering in the capricious maze of our imagination. Thefact is that there is neither chance nor coincidence nor accidentalcorrespondence here below. All is foreseen, preordained, regulated; and it isnot for us to bend to our pleasure the inscrutable will of Destiny. If the usualsense of words does not allow us any discovery capable of elevating andinstructing us, of bringing us nearer to our Creator, then words become useless.The spoken word, which gives man his indisputable superiority, his dominion overevery living thing, loses its nobility, its greatness, its beauty. It becomes nomore than a distressing vanity. Besides, language, the instrument of the spirit,has a life of its own—even though it is only a reflection of the universal Idea.We do not invent anything, we do not create anything. All is in everything. Ourmicrocosm is only an infinitesimal, animated, thinking and more or lessimperfect particle of the macrocosm. What we believe we have ourselvesdiscovered by an effort of our intelligence exists already elsewhere. Faithgives us a presentiment of what this is. Revelation gives us absolute proof.Often we pass by a phenomenon—or a miracle even—without noticing it, like menblind and deaf. What unsuspected marvels we should find, if we knew how todissect words, to strip them of their bark and liberate the spirit, the divinelight which is within! Jesus expressed himself only in parables; can we deny thetruth which the parables teach? In present-day conversation is it not theambiguities, the approximations, the puns or the assonances which characterizespirited people, who are glad to escape from the tyranny of the letter andthereby—unwittingly—show themselves cabalists in their own right.Finally I would add that argot (cant) is one of the forms derived from theLanguage of the Birds, parent and doyen of all other languages—the one spoken byphilosophers and diplomats. It was knowledge of this language which Jesusrevealed to his Apostles, by sending them his spirit, the Holy Ghost. This isthe language which teaches the mystery of things and unveils the most hiddentruths. The ancient Incas called it the Court Language, because it was used bydiplomats. To them it was the key to the double science, sacred and profane. Inthe Middle Ages it was called the Gay Science and the Gay Knowledge, theLanguage of the Gods, the Dive-Bouteille.e [36_footnote-title.html#efn]Tradition assures us that men spoke it before the building of the Tower ofBabel, which event caused this sacred language to be perverted and to be totallyforgotten by the greater part of humanity. Today, apart from cant, we find itscharacter in a few local dialects, such as Picard, Provençal, etc. and in thelanguage of the gypsies.Mythology would have it that the famous soothsayer, Tiresiasf[36_footnote-title.html#ffn] had perfect knowledge of the Language of the Birds,which Minerva, goddess of Wisdom, revealed to him. He shared it, they say, withThales of Miletus, Melampus and Appolonius of Tyana,g[36_footnote-title.html#gfn] legendary personages, whose names, in the sciencewe are considering, ring eloquently enough to require no analysis from me."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX BTHE EMERALD TABLETimage [images/image450-00.jpg]The most famous of all early alchemical texts, theEmerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistos, became through the centuries the verycredo of the alchemical adept. Tradition claimed that the tablet had been foundclutched in the mummified hands of Hermes himself “in an obscure pit, where hisinterred body lay,” as Jabir tells us, somewhere within the great pyramid ofGizeh. The text, as Jabir gives it, is very short and obscure. It is soimportant, in both a historic and a symbolic sense, that the full text isrequired for our examination. Comparing the three earliest known Latintranslations with the Arabic original and its subsequent English translations,the goal was to give as clear and simple a version as possible of such anobscure text.In truth, without falsehood and most real: That which is above is like thatwhich is below, to generate the miracles of the one thing. And as all thingshave been derived from that one, by the thought of that one, so all things areborn from that one thing by adoption. The sun is its father, the moon itsmother. Wind has carried it in its belly and the earth is its nurse. Here is theorigin point of every perfection in the world. Its strength and power areabsolute when changed into earth; separate the earth from the fire, the subtlefrom the gross, gently and with great care. It ascends from the earth to theheavens, and descends again to the earth to receive the power of the superiorand the inferior things. By this means, you will attain the glory of the world.And because of this, all darkness will flee from you. Within this is the power,the force of all forces. For it will overcome all subtle things and penetrateevery solid thing. Thus was the universe created. From this will be, and willemerge, admirable adaptations. For this reason I am called Hermes Trismegistos,having three parts of the wisdom of the world. What I have said of the sun’soperation is accomplished.Whatever the origin of this text (we find a version of it in the divinatoryinvocation to Amon-Re given in column 29, lines 5–20 of the Leyden Papyrus, asecond-century Greco-Egyptian magical text buried with its anonymous owner inthe noble necropolis on the west bank of Thebes), its value as an alchemicalblueprint is obvious in light of our examination of the “Isis the Prophetess”fragment. In fact, “light” is the operative point.In line 6 of the Amon-Re invocation we read: “Lotus-of-the Stars, heaven, in itsheight and breadth, is open; I am become the pure light . . . in truth, withoutfalsehood.” In the Arabic version of Jabir, this has become: “Because of thisevent, obscurity [darkness] will flee from you.” The “glory of the world” is theanimated glow of the living gold, the generative radiation, the “pure light”seen by the alchemists as the Great Work was completed and gold appeared intheir athanors. Once they had grasped this truth, the Emerald Tablet seems totell us, the alchemists radiated light and the darkness fled from them,figuratively and literally."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX CNOTES ON MOUNT ZIONimage [images/image452-00.jpg]The word Zion first appears in the Bible in 2Samuel 5:7 where David conquers the city of the Jebusites, and theirfortress/temple of Zion. The word has no known meaning or origin. (A search ofpossible roots in Canaanite, Coptic, hieratic Egyptian, and Hebrew turns upnothing helpful.) Over time, Zion and Mount Zion became synonyms for Jerusalemitself.Jerusalem was first occupied in the third millennium B.C.E. and was a royal cityin the time of Abraham. Melchizedek introduces Abraham to the God Most High, andAbraham does his famous sacrifice where the “blazing torch” passed through themiddle, on Mount Moriah, which is identified with Mount Zion in Davidic times (2Chron. 3:1). Mount Zion is therefore the place where covenants with God aremade.David treated it as such, building his new capital around it. Mount Zion wasalso the location of the original resting place of the Ark of the Covenant whenDavid brought it from Mount Tabor to his new capital. It was on the “threshingfloor of Oruan” on Mount Zion that David danced before the Ark of God andreceived the assurance of divine kingship. In this kingly Davidic covenant, Godtells David that his son will be the one to build a great temple.In Nehemiah’s description of the rebuilding after the Babylonian exile (Neh.3:16), we find that David’s Tomb was located on Mount Zion. In Psalms,particularly number 2 which is probably by David himself and may even be thesong he sang as he danced in front of the Ark/Throne, Mount Zion is God’s “holyhill” where he will judge the righteous and smite the wicked. Even moreinteresting is Psalm 48, which is a priestly invocation sung as a kind of circlecasting before ritually opening the temple, where we find the words “in the cityof our God, his holy mountain.” Also included is the only known cognate of Zion,Zaphon, which unfortunately tells us little more than that it was an older formof Zion.Isaiah cemented Mount Zion’s eschatological importance with verses such as2:2–4, where the “mountain of the Lord’s temple” becomes the center of “the lastdays” and “all nations will stream to it.” He also tells us that “the law willgo out from Zion,” which will bring about the peace of nations. Ezekiel alsowent in trance to the spiritual Mount Zion, where he witnessed the architectureof the Heavenly Temple in the New Jerusalem.Obadiah 13:17–21 repeats this eschatological meaning by declaring that “MountZion will be deliverance” in the last days, the place where enemies are judgedand the faithful rewarded. Zechariah 6:1 also mentions apocalyptic events onMount Zion. After this, a strange silence falls on the subject of Mount Zion.Jesus never refers, in the texts we have left, to Mount Zion. Given itseschatological and Davidic importance, this is truly odd. The closest he comesis a backhanded reference to Isaiah 14:12–15 in Luke that seems to imply that hehas committed the impropriety of making himself like God and therefore must bepunished. In Isaiah, it is the “morning star,” or Lucifer, who ascends to MountZaphon, or Zion, and claims God’s Throne. In Luke 10:18, Jesus identifieshimself with these verses.Mount Zion does appear in two places in the New Testament, the Letter to theHebrews and the Revelation of Saint John. Hebrews is a strange letter onceattributed to Paul but long recognized as not by him. The best candidate is theAlexandrian Jew Apollos, known to both Paul and Luke. He uses his letter,written before the fall of the Temple, to remind the Christians of Jerusalem ofthe original eschatological significance of Melchizedek’s covenant with Abrahamand David’s kingly covenant. The author claims that Jesus reestablished thiscovenant, and all believers would share in it when the Temple on Mount Zion hasbeen made new again (Heb. 12:22).The Book of Revelation mentions Mount Zion as the place where the Lamb and the144,000 faithful will gather for the judgment (Rev. 14:1). And it also marks thelocation of the New Jerusalem, the spot where the two Trees will stand in theremade heaven and earth.So, Mount Zion is (a) the place where Abraham sacrificed to the God Most High;(b) the original resting place of the Ark in Jerusalem and the place where Godmade David king; (c) the location of David’s Tomb; (d) the holy eschatologicalmountain; and (e) not mentioned by Jesus, even in John’s Gospel.However, the Last Supper was held on Mount Zion, in the upper room of a house inthe Essene quarter, which is just south of the old tower or fortress on the topof Mount Zion known as David’s Tomb. This had to be chosen for a reason,probably to match the clues in the ritual invocation of Psalm 48:2. The LastSupper is the Melchizedekian covenant restored, and it is also the basic Osirianritual of ancient Egypt. That it occurred on Mount Zion has apocalypticsignificance.Even more confused is the identity of Our Lady of Mount Zion. As the orthodoxChristian church evolved, it found itself having to deemphasize the role of MaryMagdalene. This led to a strange multiplicity of Marys. We have Mary, sister ofMartha of Bethany, Mary Magdalene, and Mary, Jesus’ mother, as well as severalother, peripheral Marys. Tradition holds that Mary, Jesus’ mother, had a familyhome on Mount Zion, but this is somewhat odd. Mary’s family, in the Gospels, ismentioned mainly by way of genealogy. Luke assumes her to be a descendant ofDavid, as was Joseph, her husband, and so it makes sense that the familydwelling would be near David’s Tomb on Mount Zion. However, Luke is the onlyevangelist to make that assumption. Matthew follows the Davidic descent throughJoseph’s line, but is silent on Mary’s genealogy. Her background is notmentioned in either Mark or John. Indeed, in Mark, she appears individually onlyto question Jesus’ sanity (3:21), and she doesn’t show up in John until theCrucifixion. In both of these Gospels she is one of a crowd of Marys whomultiply around the cross and the tomb. Jesus’ references to his mother are alsooddly cold, as if they didn’t get along.If we assume, with good reason, that the first-person portions of John’s Gospelare the earliest of the Gospels, then Luke’s Gospel becomes the last and latest.This lateness, around 90 C.E., accounts for its pagan, mythological flavor.Since the same author also wrote the Acts of the Apostles, in which themissionary journeys of Paul are described, we can assume that Luke was one ofthe syncretic Christians attempting to create a new religion from Hebrewsources. His insistence on the importance of Mary suggests influences fromcontemporary mystery religions, such as the Cult of Isis. The confusion over theMarys arises in part from this divine mother-and-child motif. The questionbecomes, Which child are we talking about? Luke relates John the Baptist withthe family of Mary, and the genealogical implications arising from this arefascinating.And, of course, there is Mary Magdalene. Her story also appears in Luke. In theother Gospels, she is mentioned only as one of the crowd of Marys at theCrucifixion and Resurrection. At first we are tempted to see her as anothercreation of Luke’s, since he is the only evangelist to mention her directly.However, a close reading of John’s Gospel reveals that there is another Mary,carefully edited out and obscured, who seemed to play an important role inJesus’ ministry. Our suspicions are aroused by the marriage at Cana, at whichJesus appears to be the groom. But who was the bride? Later in John we see amoment between Jesus, a woman named Mary, and her sister Martha, in which Maryand Jesus appear as man and wife. Later, John tells us, this same Mary had thepower to anoint Jesus as the Messiah. John even has Mary Magdalene meeting Jesusshortly after his resurrection, which makes her the most favored of apostles. Ifwe assume that Mary, Martha and Lazarus’ sister, and Mary Magdalene are the sameperson, then an interesting pattern emerges.The house at Bethany, where Jesus relaxed during his visits to Jerusalem, washis sister-in-law’s house. So where did Mary live? The intriguing supposition isthat she lived on Mount Zion, in the house where the Last Supper was held. Luketells us how Mary Magdalene supported Jesus’ ministry, and if she was his wifeand related as well to the Davidic royal line, then she was perhaps the mostpowerful force in early Christianity. Since the orthodox apostolic church is acreation of Peter and Paul, both of whom were outside the main family circle,then it is easy to see how distortions and misdirection occurred over time. TheChroniclers of Pope Sylvester II may have discovered this Magdalenic connectionto the roots of Christianity and chose their location on Mount Zion on purpose.We can say that from this source flowed a revived Marianist Christianity, whichgrew into the Gothic renaissance in the West."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX DTREE OF LIFE SYMBOLOGY IN LE MYSTÈRE DES CATHÉDRALESimage [images/image456-00.jpg]The Etz Chaim, the Tree of Life from the Bahir andthe Sefer Yetzirah, can be seen as the prototypical kabbalistic pattern, a sortof symbolic geometry. In Le Mystère, Fulcanelli shows us this by the arrangementof chapters and sections and by the images and plates referred to within thosechapters. There are four chapters in the first edition: “The Mystery of theCathedrals,” “Paris,” “Amiens,” and “Bourges.” These represent the four worlds,or levels of abstraction, and a Tree of Life, or a part of one, is formed ineach world.The first chapter, “The Mystery of the Cathedrals,” contains nine sections, eachof which can be attributed to one of the sefirot from Kether to Yesod. This treerepresents the Divine World, where the theory of creation is displayed.Interestingly enough, Fulcanelli’s thematic breaks in this chapter, whileevolving the sefirot in the basic lightning-path order, divides naturally into asword-in-the-stone pattern. The first three sections form the grip, the nextfive compose the stone, and the continuation of thought from section 1 straightthrough to section 9 creates the blade of the sword.The next chapter, “Paris,” creates an entire Tree of Life, with the addition ofan image of the Black Madonna from the first chapter in the position of Binah.This arrangement, as we shall see, is a clue to the astronomical nature of thisarchetypal Tree of Life. On a projected or celestial Tree of Life, the earth’spole is tilted toward Binah—the Dark Mother of the Cosmic Sea, in kabbalisticsymbology—hence, its importance in Fulcanelli’s design. He continues the patternwith the Kether image of “Alchemy” from the main porch at Notre Dame and theChokmah image of the alchemist from the south tower. These three images form thetop three sefirot, the Supernatural Triad, and then, quite appropriately,Fulcanelli creates a break to represent the abyss of Daat, or gnosis.He starts over mapping the tree at the bottom, at the foot of the path ofreturn, the Serpent’s Path back up the Tree. Plates 4 through 25 in the secondedition of Le Mystère represent the paths on the Tree, attributed to the lettersof the Hebrew alphabet and the trumps of the Tarot. With plate 26, the sefirotpattern picks up again with Daat, the gnosis of the abyss, and proceeds down theTree to plate 32, an image of the Massacre of the Innocents from Saint-Chapelle,appropriate for Malkuth, considering what happened to the gnostic current in theWest. Fulcanelli has here provided us with a very clear and direct image of theentire thirty-two components of the classical Etz Chaim symbology. In terms ofworlds, this second level is the archetypal realm, the world of ideas.Fulcanelli demonstrates this by including an almost complete idea Tree, a memorymap or mnemonic pattern, at this level. Our inspiration, of course, Binah, orthe Black Isis Madonna, comes across from the realm of the Divine.The next level or world is that of the formational or the etheric. This is thelevel of the astral or spiritual world so beloved of shamans and mystics of allsorts. Fulcanelli shows great restraint by describing only part of the ethericTree, not wanting to impart the information from the higher levels of the Treebecause his readers were not initiated to that level. He focuses on the sevenplanetary intelligences and their influence on alchemy. In these seven images,six shown and one only mentioned in the text, Fulcanelli gives us clues to theoperational nature of the work. The unshown image is the hidden sun, themythical sun behind the sun, and the formative images all seem to show how thishidden or dark sun affects the planetary intelligences. Since theseintelligences are also attributed to the seven metals, there does indeed seem tobe a vast operational secret contained in these images.Once this multiple Tree of Life pattern is built up from the sections of thefirst chapter and the plates from Notre-Dame-de-Paris and Amiens, with a fewextra plates from Saint-Chapelle, Saint Victor, and elsewhere, an understandingof the basic process of astro-alchemy can be gleaned. This is the real secret,and from Fulcanelli’s point of view there is no mystery about it. But once thissecret is revealed, Fulcanelli goes on to propose a fourth Tree of Life thatneatly ties the historical, mythological, and cosmological elements into onecoherent framework.This fourth Tree of Life pattern represents the world of action, our world ofstars and suns and planets. This Tree of Life grows out of Bourges, in Berry.Fulcanelli ignores the town’s Gothic cathedral, with its stunning apocalypticstained glass, and concentrates on two mid-fifteenth-century contemporaries ofGood King René, Jacques Coeur and Jean Lallemant, and their houses. This is asignificant departure; up to this point Fulcanelli has focused exclusively oncathedrals. This departure signals the shift from the theoretical and mysticalto the operational. Here we are firmly in the world of action.Fulcanelli is pointing us toward a moment in the fifteenth century when theunderground stream broke the surface of history. He suggests that the mystery ofBourges is the mystery of the esoteric current in the ancient past, the presentof the fifteenth century, and the future down to and beyond the twentiethcentury. The mystery of initiation encompasses a vast reach of time, Fulcanelliinsists, but the strands of the tapestry emerged into a pattern at Bourges inthe mid-1400s.Fulcanelli directs our attention toward eight images in the two houses. Two arefrom Jacques Coeur’s house, plates 39 and 40, and six are from Lallemant, plates41 to 46. They can be analyzed as two images that establish both individuals asalchemists, the scallop shell and the vessel of the Great Work; three historicaland mythological themes, Tristan and Isolde, the Golden Fleece, and SaintChristopher; and three initiatory images from the inner sanctum of Lallemantmansion, the pillars, the ceiling, and the credence of the chapel.Even this simple pattern reveals groups of threes within threes. The first ofthe three groups of symbols shows us that Jacques Coeur was a pilgrim, a fellowtraveler, but Jean Lallemant was the operating agent with the vessel of theGreat Work. The role of grand master, however, is undefined. We are left withthe impression that a third personality exists, made conspicuous by his absence.Who was he?The next of the three groupings reinforces this impression. Here we are met withthree narrative images, symbolic stories balanced on that fine line betweenhistory and mythology. There is a core of reality to these tales, even when weare aware of their mythological elements. But, on the surface, there is nothingto connect the love story of Tristan and Isolde with the ancient Greek legend ofthe Golden Fleece, and both seemingly have nothing in common with the Christianlegend of Saint Christopher and the very heavy Christ child. And yet, Fulcanellipresents the simple but overwhelming evidence from their own houses that thesemasters of the subtle art, the green language itself, placed the utmostimportance on these three myths. What do these three stories have in common?Of course, the third mystery grows out of the first two: Just what were theseinitiations designed to reveal?The answer to that is the ultimate secret, the secret of time itself. In thesecond edition of Le Mystère, Fulcanelli provides the solution by adding thechapter called “The Cyclic Cross of Hendaye.” The three plates from thatchapter, numbers 47 to 49, added to the eight of Bourges, numbers 39 through 46,complete the sefirot of the fourth Tree of Life, including Daat, gnosis orknowledge. This Tree, as appropriate to the world of action, reveals thecosmological underpinnings of the entire hermetic philosophy of astro-alchemy.The final image in the group, plate 49, the tympanum of Saint Trophime at Arles,completes the circle, both symbolically and on the ground, returning us onceagain to the ancient city of the Argonauts.There is also a threefold pattern reflected in the design of the whole book. Thefirst secret, the Tree of Life itself, is formed from the sword-in-the-stonepattern of the nine sections in the first chapter. They form a framework for thesefirot, which is then amplified and deepened by the images fromNotre-Dame-de-Paris. To this is added the third level, the planetary seals fromAmiens cathedral. The next threefold pattern is the mystery of Bourges outlinedabove. The last grouping of three is the three interlocking cycles of theHendaye cross, their symbolic reflection on the cathedral at Arles, and finallythe three dragon axes in the sky that form the triple alignment of the galacticGreat Cross.This compounding of threes, 3 × 3 × 3, or 33, = 27, presents us with the keynumber in the precessional cycle, the core of the secret hidden behind theChristianized INRI, whose letters in Hebrew add up to 270. From this briefexplication of the mystery at the heart of The Mystery of the Cathedrals, it ispossible to glimpse the genius and coherence of this very guarded and hermeticmasterpiece. The message is the medium, language contains its own gnosis, andinitiation truly is, as the Grail legends declare, the ability to ask thecorrect questions.As we unravel the triple weave of this hermetic tapestry, we shall discover theanswer to all of our questions, and in doing so experience a glimpse of a verydifferent reality. Fulcanelli, whoever he was, wrote as the last initiate: notas the one who puts out the light as he leaves, but as the one who makes surethat the eternal flame is burning brightly in some lost corner of Plato’s cave.What we have discovered in the course of this book about our own past, ourspiritual heritage, and the hope for human evolution is due to his guidance andinsight. Without the help of someone who knew, and could prove it, the mysterymight never have been unveiled.THE SEFIROT IMAGES OF THE FOUR TREES OF LIFE IN LE MYSTÈRE DES CATHÉDRALES1) Kether, CrownTree 1: Section 1 of first chapter, cathedrals as books in stoneTree 2: Plate 2, Alchemy, from the Great Porch, Notre-Dame-de-ParisTree 4: Plate 49, tympanum of porch, Saint Trophime at Arles2) Chokmah, WisdomTree 1: Section 2 of first chapter, the Philosophers’ ChurchTree 2: Plate 3, the alchemist, Notre-Dame-de-ParisTree 4: Plate 48, the four sides of the base of the Hendaye cross3) Binah, UnderstandingTree 1: Section 3 of first chapter, Gothic/argotique discussionTree 2: Plate 1, Black Virgin of the CryptsTree 4: Plate 47, the Cyclic Cross of Hendaye11) Daat, Knowledge/GnosisTree 1: (no corresponding section in first chapter)Tree 2: Plate 26, the planetary metals, Notre-Dame-de-Paris, Saturn, leadTree 3: Plate 33, the wheel of fire, AmiensTree 4: Plate 46, the enigma of the credence4) Chesed, MercyTree 1: Section 4 of first chapter, the crossTree 2: Plate 27, the dog and the doves, Jupiter, tinTree 3: Plate 35, the cock and the fox, AmiensTree 4: Plate 45, chapel ceiling, Lallemant mansion at Bourges5) Gevurah, StrengthTree 1: Section 5 of first chapter, labyrinthsTree 2: Plate 28, solve et coagula, Mars, ironTree 3: Plate 34, philosophic coction, AmiensTree 4: Plate 44, capital of pillar, Lallemant mansion at Bourges6) Tiferet, BeautyTree 1: Section 6 of first chapter, the wheel of the yearTree 2: Hidden sun image (unshown), Sun, goldTree 3: Fortress image (unshown), AmiensTree 4: Plate 43, the Golden Fleece, Lallemant mansion at Bourges7) Netzach, VictoryTree 1: Section 7 of first chapter, star themesTree 2: Plate 29, the bath of the stars, Venus, copperTree 3: Plate 38, the seven-rayed starTree 4: Plate 42, Saint Christopher, Lallemant mansion at Bourges8) Hod, SplendorTree 1: Section 8 of first chapter, Black VirginTree 2: Plate 30, Philosophical Mercury, Notre-Dame-de-Paris, MercuryTree 3: Plate 36, the first matter, AmiensTree 4: Plate 41, the vessel of the Great Work9) Yesod, FoundationTree 1: Section 9 of first chapter, Notre-Dame-de-ParisTree 2: Plate 31, symbolic coat of arms, Moon, silverTree 3: Plate 37, the Philosophers’ Dew, AmiensTree 4: Plate 40, Tristan and Isolde, Jacques Coeur’s house at Bourges10) Malkuth, KingdomTree 1: (no corresponding section in first chapter)Tree 2: Plate 32, Massacre of the InnocentsTree 4: Plate 39, the scallop shell, Jacques Coeur’s house at Bourgesimage [images/image462-00.jpg]Figure App. D.1. This is a place holder caption for the full-page art that willbe placed on this page in the Appendix D [34_chapter-title-21.html].The plates numbered 4 through 25, inclusive, in the Paris chapter of Le Mystèreare attributed to the twenty-two individual letter paths, which connect theeleven sefirot listed above. Their pattern is the classical Path of Return,pictured as a snake winding its way up the Tree. For example, plate 4, thefoundation and the oak, is attributed to the Hebrew letter taw and the Tarotimage The World, linking the pilgrimage and persecution of the Kingdom, Malkuth,with the foundational symbology of Notre-Dame-de-Paris, heraldry, the Graillegends, and the Philosophical Dew in the sefirah of Yesod. Filling in the restof the Tree with these symbols reveals the ongoing alchemical process ofcreation.Fulcanelli’s use of three numbered images to represent the sefirah of gnosis,Daat, reveals a deep and profound understanding of the numerical Kabbalah. Thisunderstanding can be traced with many subtleties throughout Fulcanelli’sexplication of the four Trees. An exhaustive examination of this underlyingnumerical Kabbalah belongs in an annotated version of Le Mystère descathédrales, but for now it is enough to look at the obvious and significantconnections between Fulcanelli’s gnosis numbers.Plate 26, our first Daat image, comes after Fulcanelli’s explication of the Pathof Return. This is appropriate since 26 is the number of the Unutterable Name ofGod, YHVH (Y [10] + H [5] + V [6] + H [5] = 26), and in the image, from thePorch of the Virgin at Notre-Dame-de-Paris, the Ark of the Tabernacle, YHVH’sdwelling place, is clearly shown below the seals of the planetary metals. OtherHebrew words with the same numerical value include those for “vision” and“seeing,” implying the light nature of the divine. The mystical kabbalists likedto see 26 as composed of pairs of words with the value of 13, such as love andunity, emptiness and thunder. It is also the sum of the numbers of the sefiroton the Middle Pillar of the Tree of Life, 1 + 6 + 9 + 10 = 26.Plate 33, the wheel of fire from Amiens cathedral, begins a new Tree with anexperience of the internal process of alchemy. In esoteric Freemasonry, a33rd-degree initiate is one who has internalized the entire 32 paths of the Treeof Life. This master level indicates one who is ready to move from theory topractice, from speculative to practical alchemy. We can also think of 33 as theTrinity, 3, multiplied by the number of gnosis, 11, or as the experience of thenature of the Trinity. In Hebrew, the word for “spring” or “fountain” has thevalue of 33, indicating the Gnostic origin of the idea of an underground stream,33, which reveals the sacred 7 of good fortune that flows from the divinesource, YHVH, 26 (33 – 26 = 7). In the same way, the underground stream, 33,supplies Elhi, 46, the God Most High, with the thunder, love, unity, oremptiness, all 13s (33 + 13 = 46).Plate 46, the enigmatic credence from Lallemant mansion in Bourges, completesour gnostic trinity. Forty-six is an auspicious number. In esoteric Freemasonry,a 33rd-degree master has the opportunity to advance further by taking 13 extragrades, or degrees. Therefore, a 46th-degree initiate is supposedly a master ofspace and time, a bodhisattva-like enlightened adept. In the King James Versionof the Bible there is the curious incident of Psalm 46. When one counts 46 wordsdown from the first word in Psalm 46, one comes to the word shake. If one counts46 words from the bottom of Psalm 46, one comes to the word speare. This wouldindicate that the author, or authors, of the works of William Shakespeare,called by Victor Hugo “a cathedral of words,” are 46th-degree initiates. A hintof this can also be gleaned from the fact that 3 × 46 = 138, the number of thephrase Ben Elohim, or “Son of the Gods.” It is interesting to note that FrancisBacon was chosen by King James to head the translation team for the Bible. Otherinteresting ramifications of the number 46 include the number of the name ofAdam, the first man. It is also said that it took 46 years to build KingSolomon’s Temple. Each human being has 46 chromosomes. As we said above, 46equals the name of God, Elhi, an ancient name for the El in the Sky, the HighGod of Draco. It is also the number of the Levite priests who ministered to thatGod. If we think of what the Lallemant credence has to tell us about the processof transformation, then 46 represents a level of personal attainment. By addingthe extra three images of the Hendaye chapter, the personal connection of Elhi,46, becomes the transpersonal connection of the Living God, El Chai, 49,depicted on the tympanum of Saint Trophime in Arles, plate 49."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX ETHE CYCLIC CROSS OF HENDAYEh [36_footnote-title.html#hfn]image [images/image465-00.jpg]Hendaye, a small frontier town in the Basquecountry, has its little houses huddled at the foot of the first spurs of thePyrenees. It is framed by the green ocean, the broad, swift and shining Bidassoaand the grassy hills. One’s first impression, on seeing this rough and ruggedlandscape, is a rather painful and almost hostile one. On the horizon, over thesea, the natural austerity of the wild scene is scarcely relieved by theheadland of Fuenterrabia, showing ochre in the crude light, thrusting into thedark greyish-green mirror-calm waters of the gulf. Apart from the Spanishcharacter of its houses, the type of dialect of the inhabitants, and the veryspecial attention of a new beach, bristling with proud villas, Hendaye hasnothing to hold the attention of the tourist, the archaeologist or the artist.Leaving the station, a country road, skirting the railway line, leads to theparish church, situated in the middle of the village. This church, with its barewalls and its massive, squat rectangular tower, stands in a square a few stepsabove ground level and bordered by leafy trees. It is an ordinary, dullbuilding, which has been renovated and is of no particular interest. However,near the south transept there is a humble stone cross, as simple as it isstrange, hiding amidst the greenery of the square. It was formerly in the parishcemetery and it was only in 1842 that it was brought to its present site nearthe church. At least, that is what was told me by an old Basque man, who had formany years acted as sexton. As for the origin of this cross, it is unknown and Iwas not able to obtain any information at all about the date of its erection.However, judging by the shape of the base and the column, I would not think thatit could be before the end of the seventeenth or beginning of the eighteenthcentury. Whatever its age, the Hendaye cross shows by the decoration of itspedestal that it is the strangest monument of primitive millenarism, the rarestsymbolical translation of chiliasm,i [36_footnote-title.html#ifn] which I haveever met. It is known that this doctrine, first accepted and then refuted byOrigen, St. Denis of Alexandria and St. Jerome although it had not beencondemned by the Church, was part of the esoteric tradition of the ancienthermetic philosophy.The naivety of the bas-reliefs and their unskilful execution lead one to supposethat these stone emblems were not the work of a professional sculptor; but,aesthetic considerations apart, we must recognize that the unknown workman, whomade these images, possessed real and profound knowledge of the universe.On the transverse arm of the cross—a Greek cross—is found the followinginscription, consisting of two strange parallel lines of raised letters, formingwords almost running into each other, in the same order as I give here:OCRUXAVESPESUNICACertainly it is easy to recognize the well-known phrase: O crux ave spes unica(Hail o cross, the only hope). However, if we were to translate it like aschoolboy, we should not know the purpose either of the base or of the cross andwe might be surprised by such an invocation. In reality, we should carrycarelessness and ignorance to the pitch of disregarding the elementary rules ofgrammar. The masculine word pes in the nominative requires the adjective unicus,agreeing in gender, and not the feminine form unica. It would, therefore, appearthat the corruption of the word spes, hope, into pes, foot, by dropping theinitial consonant, must be the unintentional result of a complete lack ofknowledge on the part of out stone-cutter. But does inexperience really justifysuch uncouthness? I cannot think so. Indeed, a comparison of the other motifs,carried out by the same hand and in the same manner, shows evident care toreproduce the normal positioning, a care shown both in the placing and in thebalance of the motifs. Why should the inscription have been treated lessscrupulously? A careful examination of the latter shows that the letters areclear, if not elegant, and do not overlap (pl. XLVII). No doubt our workmantraced them first in chalk or charcoal, and this rough draft must rule out anyidea that a mistake occurred during the actual cutting of the letters. However,since this apparent mistake exists, it follows that it must really have beenintended. The only reason that I can think of is that it is a sign put in onpurpose, concealed under the appearance of an inexplicable blunder, and intendedto arouse the curiosity of the observer. I will, therefore, state that, in myopinion, it was with knowledge and intent that the author arranged theinscription of his puzzling work in this way.I had already been enlightened by studying the pedestal and knew in what way andby what means of what key the Christian inscription of the monument should beread; but I was anxious to show investigators what help may be obtained insolving hidden matters from plain common sense, logic and reasoning.The letter S, which takes on the curving shape of a snake, corresponds to theGreek khi (X) and takes over its esoteric meaning. It is the helicoidal track ofthe sun, having arrived at the zenith of its curve across space, at the time ofthe cyclic catastrophe. It is a theoretical image of the Beast of theApocalypse, of the dragon, which, on the days of Judgment, spews out fire andbrimstone on macrocosmic creation. Thanks to the symbolic value of the letter S,displaced on purpose, we understand that the inscription must be translated insecret language, that is to say in the language of the gods or the language ofthe birds, and that the meaning must be found with the help of the rules ofDiplomacy. Several authors, and particularly Grasset d’Orcet in his analysis ofthe Songe de Polyphile published by the Revue Britannique, have given thesesufficiently clearly to make it unnecessary for me to repeat them. We shall,then, read in French, the language of the diplomats, the Latin just as it iswritten. Then, by making use of the permutation of vowels, we shall be able toread off the new words, forming another sentence, and re-establish the spelling,the word order and the literary sense. In this way, we obtain the followingstrange announcement: Il est écrit que la vie se réfugie en un seul espace (Itis written that life takes refuge in a single space)j[36_footnote-title.html#jfn] and we learn that a country exists, where deathcannot reach man at the terrible time of the double cataclysm. As for thegeographical location of this promised land, from which the élite will take partin the return of the golden age, it is up to us to find it. For the élite, thechildren of Elias, will be saved according to the word of Scripture, becausetheir profound faith, their untiring perseverance in effort, will have earnedfor them the right to be promoted to the rank of the disciples of theChrist-Light. They will bear his sign and will receive from him the mission ofrenewing for regenerated humanity the chain of tradition of the humanity whichhas disappeared.The front of the cross, the part which received the three terrible nails fixingthe agonized body of the Redeemer to the accursed wood, is indicated by theinscription INRI, carved on its transverse arm. It corresponds to the schematicimage of the cycle, shown on the base (pl. XLVIII). Thus we have two symboliccrosses, both instruments of the same torture. Above is the divine cross,exemplifying the chosen means of expiation; below is the global cross, fixingthe pole of the northern hemisphere and locating in time the fatal period ofthis expiation. God the Father holds in his hand this globe, surmounted by thefiery sign. The four great ages—historical representations of the four ages ofthe world—have their sovereigns shown holding this same attribute. They areAlexander, Augustus, Charlemagne and Louis XIV.k [36_footnote-title.html#kfn] Itis this which explains the inscription INRI, exoterically translated as IesusNazarenus Rex Iudeorum (Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews), but which gives tothe cross its secret meaning: Igne Natura Renovatur Integra (By fire nature isrenewed whole). For it is by fire and in fire that our hemisphere will soon betried. And just as, by means of fire, gold is separated from impure metals, so,Scripture says, the good will be separated from the wicked on the great Day ofJudgment.On each of the four sides of the pedestal, a different symbol is to be seen. Onehas the image of the sun, another of the moon; the third shows a great star andthe last a geometric figure, which, as I have just said, is none other than thediagram used by the initiates to indicate the solar cycle. It is a simplecircle, divided into four sectors by two diameters cutting each other at rightangles. The sectors each bear an A, which shows that they stand for the fourages of the world. This is a complete hieroglyph of the universe, composed ofthe conventional signs for heaven and earth, the spiritual and the temporal, themacrocosm and the microcosm, in which major emblems of the redemption (cross)and the world (circle) are found in association.In medieval times, these four phases of the great cyclic period, whosecontinuous rotation was expressed in antiquity by means of a circle divided bytwo perpendicular diameters, were generally represented by the four evangelistsor by their symbolic letter, which was the Greek alpha, or, more often still, bythe four evangelical beasts surrounding Christ, the living human representationof the cross. This is the traditional formula, which one meets frequently on thetympana of Roman porches. Jesus is shown there seated, his left hand resting ona book, his right raised in the gesture of benediction, and separated from thefour beasts, which attend him, by an ellipse, called the mystic almond. Thesegroups, which are generally isolated from other scenes by a garland of clouds,always have their figures placed in the same order, as may be seen in thecathedrals of Chartres (royal portal) and Le Mans (west porch), in the Church ofthe Templars at Luz (Hautes Pyrénées) and the Church of Civray (Vienne), on theporch of St. Trophime at Arles, etc. (pl. XLIX).“And before the throne,” writes St. John, “there was a sea of glass, like untocrystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were fourbeasts full of eyes before and behind. And the first beast was like a lion, andthe second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and thefourth beast was like a flying eagle.”l [36_footnote-title.html#lfn]This agrees with Ezekiel’s version: “And I looked, and behold . . . a greatcloud, and a fire infolding itself and a brightness was about it, and out of themidst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire. Also out ofthe midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. . . . As for thelikeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lionon the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; theyfour also had the face of an eagle.”m [36_footnote-title.html#mfn]In Hindu mythology, the four equal sectors of the circle, formed by the cross,were the basis of a rather strange mystical conception. The entire cycle ofhuman evolution is figured there in the form of a cow, symbolizing Virtue, eachof whose four feet rests on one of the sectors representing the four ages of theworld. In the first age, corresponding to the Greek age of gold and called CredaYuga or age of innocence, Virtue is firmly established on earth: the cow standssquarely on four legs. In the Treda Yuga or second age, corresponding to the ageof silver, it is weakened and stands only on three legs. During the TouvabaraYuga, or third age, which is the age of bronze, it is reduced to two legs.Finally, in the age of iron, our own age, the cyclic cow or human virtue reachesthe utmost degree of feebleness and senility: it is scarcely able to stand,balancing on one leg. It is the fourth and last age, the Kali Yuga, the age ofmisery, misfortune and decrepitude.The age of iron has no other seal than that of Death. Its hieroglyph is theskeleton, bearing the attributes of Saturn: the empty hourglass, symbol of timerun out, and the scythe, reproduced in the figure seven, which is the number oftransformation, of destruction, of annihilation. The Gospel of this fatal age isthe one written under the inspiration of St. Matthew. Matthaeus, Greek Mατθαìος,comes from Mάθηµα, Mάθηµατος, which means science. This word has given Mάθησις,µάθησεως, study, knowledge, from µανθάνειν, to learn. It is the Gospel accordingto Science, the last of all but for us the first, because it teaches us that,save for a small number of the élite, we must all perish. For this reason theangel was made the attribute of St. Matthew, because science, which alone iscapable of penetrating the mystery of things, of beings and their destiny, cangive man wings to raise him to knowledge of the highest truths and finally toGod."},{"pageContent":"INDEXAbbot Suger, 184, 192, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 214, 217, 222, 280Abd-al-Rahman, 122Abelard, Peter, 169Abraham, 98–101, 102, 104, 105, 106, 107–8, 145, 154, 182–83, 223, 323, 326,341, 344Abraham ben David, Rabbi, 184, 185Abram, 102, 104–6, 341Abu Abdallah, 113Abu Artush, 180Abufalah, 170–80, 234Abyssinia, 100Acharontos, 44–45, 61Acre, 169Acts of the Apostles, 211Adam, 101, 382Adam Kadmon, 383, 406Adelmar, 213Adhemar, 138, 139Adriatic Sea, 163Aegean Sea, 369Afghanistan, 110Aghlabid, 113Ahathoor Temple, 429AHH YHVH ELOHIM, 247Aisne, 193Aix, 181Akiva, Rabbi, 179Al Aqsa Mosque, 192Al Arabi, Ibn, 185Al Azhar Mosque, 113–14, 128–29, 197Al Hakim, 122, 128–29, 137, 140,144–45, 180, 181Al Khattab, Omar, 109–10Al Mansur, Hallaj, 111, 112, 144, 145 Alberti, Leon Battista, 217Albi, 171, 173, 174, 181 Albigensian, 173, 181Alchemy, 118, 120, 141, 148, 149, 222, 228, 266, 268, 273, 312, 332, 338, 357,393, 421, 423Gnostic science and art of, xi–xiv, 2, 12–16, 19–20, 31, 37–64meme of, 41–42, 54, 57, 62, 67and androgyny, 17, 28and DNA, 61–64, 69and eschatalogy, xiii, 1, 6, 22, 37–39, 64–85and three-fold transformation, 58–66, 81and transformation/transmutation/redemption of spirit inside matter, 3, 5–6, 11,17, 37, 55, 58, 77, 86as “science of light and time,” xii, 37–39, 58, 61–64, 115linguistic.

Later authors speculate that it is everywhere and in everything,as common as dirt, in one sense. But this was not the understanding current inthe tenth and eleventh centuries. The eleventh-century manuscript of thepseudo-Khalid ibn Yazid, the major work of Hebrew and Arabic alchemy betweenZosimos and the provençal kabbalists, comments that alchemy, “this magisteriumof ours about the secret stone,” was kept hidden among the descendants ofAbraham, “His people.” Khalid also comments that the stone “is not a stone, thatis, neither a stone nor of the nature of a stone,” implying that it is a “stone”not from this earth. (See Patai, The Jewish Alchemists, chapter 9.) As we shallsee in later chapters, this idea of a “stone” not of this earth recurs in theGrail legends, and even has some scientific foundation as a prima materiaaccording to the research of Dr. Paul LaViolette and modern pseudo-alchemistssuch as David Hudson.23 [17_chapter-title-7.html#chap23].
