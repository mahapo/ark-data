Various specialized journals have published seriousarticles bearing on this irksome question, but the mystery has remained intact,to the great disappointment of all those who have hoped for a solution.Before proceeding further on the topic of Fulcanelli, however, I believe that itis of paramount importance to dispel in advance any ambiguity as to the truenature of alchemy, a subject so maligned and adapted to any purpose that anyoneat all, no matter his qualifications, has felt free to offer an explanation ofthe meaning of this high science. Thus we hear talk of such things as “spiritualalchemy” and “Tantric alchemy” when we are not seeing alchemy saddled withpsychoanalytical meanings by a certain school that is attached to psychicarchetypes, notably those arising from the study of dreams and taking as theirsubject matter the study of man! All these erroneous conceptions seem to arisefor some individuals entirely from the results of a total misunderstanding ofthe Sacred Art, whereas for others, these misunderstandings seem to come from adeliberate willfulness to lead minds astray.It should also be noted that in many works with alchemical aspirations, theauthors, lacking adequate information, commit the common and unacceptablemistake of claiming a supposed “Black Work” that foreshadows, as they would say,two following stages designated, respectively, the “White Work” and the “RedWork.”The truth of the matter is that these two “final” stages, which lead to real butdifferent results, constitute within themselves alone the core of the hermeticwork, the black representing only what the alchemists mean by “putrefaction.”In reality, it is quite clear that even though it absolutely cannot be thoughtof apart from its fiery oven, authentic alchemy is something entirely other. Andin order to defer to three authors who are duly qualified and whose authority inthis matter is unanimously recognized in hermetic circles, I cannot resist thesalutary obligation of transcribing their respective advice, starting with myold friend of forty years, Eugène Canseliet, the famous writer of prefaces forthe two Fulcanelli works already mentioned, and who, in a manner not unpleasingto our omniscient scientists, declares forthrightly in his precious Alchimieexpliquée sur les textes classiques: “How misguided it is that popular legendwould have us believe that alchemy consists entirely in the artificialproduction of metallic gold when its principal goal is the discovery of theUniversal Medicine that alone is the provider of the triple privilege ofknowledge, health, and wealth.”³ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1720_0]Let us continue with these words from my very dear but recently departed friendClaude Lablatinière d’Ygé, who, in his Nouvelle Assemblée des PhilosophesChymiques, makes clear for us: “May those who think that alchemy is strictly ofa character that is earthly, mineral, and metallic give it a wide berth. Maythose who think that alchemy is only a symbolism used to reveal through analogythe process of ‘spiritual revelation’—in short, that man is the material and theathanor is his work—abandon it.”⁴ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1722_0]Here is a clearly stated extract from the fifth “Épistola Hermetica,” publishedin the highly regarded journal Atlantis, founded by Paul Le Cour:Yes, there exists in fact only one alchemy that is not so much ours as that ofNicolas Flamel and that of Basile Valentin, the Cosmopolite, Cyliani, orFulcanelli. . . . How terribly crude it is seen to be—this idea oftenencountered that holds that alchemy is solely the wild pursuit of the ancientChrysopoeia,a [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1561_0] as if men of the past, justas those in this age of iron, had been only hateful materialists greedy forriches before all else, without the slightest concern for the welfare of theirsouls! The ultimate goal of the alchemical quest, far and away beyond all othergoals, consists in this: to help the person—one who is in no way a mystic—toestablish his welfare while on this earth, just as such a person, leaning overthe crucible, helps the raw material to be purified until the “Light of theLight” (that is, the Lumen de Lumine of the Nicene Creed of the year 325) isobtained.⁵ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1724_0]Could anything be more explicit than these three incontrovertible declarations?Such statements are quite necessary in order to place those “Lovers of Science,”who are sincere but are just beginning on their guard against widely distributedand terrible books that can do nothing but lead us down the garden path. What isalso indicated by this is how we must strictly follow only those textsrecognized as classic texts!Now let us return to the purpose of this preface: describing the recentsituation concerning the mysterious pseudonym Fulcanelli.And it was just then, with benevolent concern, that Providence, judging no doubtthat the moment had come to have the truth burst forth, descended upon a youngwoman who had always been haunted by this mystery and who was a member of ourlittle spiritualist group in Grenoble. Fascinated by this famous enigma,Geneviève Dubois, for it is indeed she we are speaking of, firmly rose to thechallenge by adopting the unshakable resolution to try and tear away the veil.Embodying a limitless energy together with a tenacity and discernment worthy ofSherlock Holmes, she did not hesitate to mobilize all resources to reach hergoal, exemplifying thereby the famous saying: “What woman wants, God wants.”Not stinting on the inevitable expenses that such an inquiry involves, ourfriend took many trips and established numerous and fruitful contacts, both inthe provinces, in areas sometimes very distant from one another, andparticularly in Paris, where sharp minds, won over by her endeavor, were quickto offer her their bibliographic skills and their support. Without lettingherself become disconcerted by the scope and extreme difficulty of the task, ourintuitive investigator managed fortuitously to meet certain involved familieswho, convinced of the sincerity of her undertaking, freely made available theirtextual and visual archives, going so far as to authorize the making of copiesand photographic reproductions, a large number of which appear in thispublication.In conclusion, I consider it a duty to pay well-deserved homage to GenevièveDubois, for her book, embellished with a lively style that is inlaid at timeswith felicitous turns of phrase, provides a very developed and ever-so-revealingsynthesis that forms the crowning glory of all the efforts undertaken to arrive,finally and happily, at the conclusion of such a thankless, complex, andincredible inquiry.Refusing to give away anything, even in part, concerning her work, and wantingnot to overly tax the patience of the reader, I am anxious to let the authorlead on from one surprise to the next.May this revelatory book enjoy the widest possible audience. That is the wishthat is forming in my heart of hearts in concluding this humble preface forwhich Geneviève Dubois so kindly sought me out and which I have taken suchpleasure in providing, despite my limited qualifications, because of our alreadylong-standing, loyal, and solid friendship.Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas.b[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1563_0]VIRGIL, GEORGICS, 2:489ROGER GALLOIS, SIMPLE CHILD OF THE SCIENCE"},{"pageContent":"[../Images/img0024.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"1THE CHAIN OF HERMES, OR THE PERSISTENCE OF THE SCIENCE OF ALCHEMYToward the middle of the nineteenth century, groups of occultists appeared thatwere characterized by their attempts, using metaphysical speculation andexperiments that today would be termed paranormal, to validate the idea ofsurvival after death and to give a meaning to life.Europe was following the path of symbolism and meditation. In this, people werereacting to the positivism of Auguste Comte. This philosophy, developed between1830 and 1842, countering romantic lyricism and influenced by the progress ofthe biological sciences, held that it was necessary to limit knowledge to truthsbased on observation and experiment and to abandon the attempt to know theessence of things.It was then that there arose movements such as the spiritualism of Allan Kardec;Theosophy, which drew its inspiration from the Far East; and the Anthroposophismof Rudolf Steiner, which are among the best known.It should be noted that at the end of the eighteenth century and at thebeginning of the nineteenth, the Encyclopedists tried to pull back fromreligious dogma, and the most eminent thinkers put forth the idea of conductingresearch separate from faith. For example, one of these, Swedenborg, maintainedthat he had attained mystical experience as a result of science.Alchemy in this period appeared to have become obsolete. Its doctrine—as was thecase, moreover, with the so-called occult sciences—had been dismissed since thesecond half of the seventeenth century with Descartes. It seemed to havecompletely disappeared with the triumph of the chemistry of Lavoisier, for heproclaimed that a simple substance is indecomposable, a theory incompatible withthe alchemical credo, which holds the opposite to be the case. The famouschemist meant to put an end to beliefs about the possibilities of transmutation.Science thus entertained the hope of penetrating the mysteries of nature.The century was not, however, so dismal as we might be led to believe. Somescholars appeared on the scene—Dom Pernety¹ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1728_0]and his Fables Égyptiennes et Grecques; Joseph Balsamo, known as Cagliostro;Count St. Germaina [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1567_0]; Abbé NicolasLenglet-Dufresnoy;² [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1730_0] and the famous Alliette,³[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1732_0] under his pseudonym Etteila (nearly ananagram of his name)—who left us three interesting treatises together with aTarot. Isolated and in secret, some alchemists continued to search for thephilosopher’s stone.One name that stands out clearly in the second half of the eighteenth century isJames Price, the English doctor and chemist and member of the Royal Society. Hemade chemical discoveries and worked as an alchemist in his private laboratory,obtaining a powder that transmuted mercury and silver into gold. Beginning in1782, according to Sadoul, he performed public transmutations in the village ofGilford, where he had bought a manor. His end was tragic: Convinced that hewould be taken for an impostor, he committed suicide.Curiosity was sustained and awakened by authors such as Goethe, born in 1749,who took a genuine interest in Hermeticism, the transmission of which heensured. His Faust is an icon of esotericism. Nineteenth-century romanticliterature seized upon the image of the alchemist, perverting it by promotingthe antiquated image of a solitary and cursed magician. In 1831, Gérard deNerval wrote Nicolas Flamel, and in 1838 Alexandre Dumas wrote a piece called“L’Alchimiste.” Finally, also in 1831, Victor Hugo published his famous novelNotre-Dame-de-Paris.A year later, in 1832, a little anonymous tract⁴[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1734_0] appeared under the title Hermès Dévoilé,dédié à la Postérité,⁵ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1736_0] published by FélixLocquin in Paris, at 16 rue Notre-Dame-des-Victoires. The author signed his work“Ci . . .” at the end. He stated that he had obtained what he had been seekingafter numerous false starts and after so many years: the elucidation of thealchemical Great Work. This book was considered, first by Fulcanelli and then byEugène Canseliet, as the story of an adept whose word could be trusted. It istrue that this text, so touching in its enumeration of the misfortunes thatbefell this hermeticist, reveals a real mastery of the wet way and anacquaintance with exterior influences. Canseliet and Fulcanelli refer to itfrequently.In July of 1843, another Frenchman made known his deep interest in the scienceof Hermes: Louis-Paul-François Cambriel⁶ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1738_0] wasseventy-nine years old at the time of the appearance of his nineteen-lessoncourse on the practice of the Great Work. In June of 1819, he had included inthe “petites affiches”b [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1570_0] an offer of“great benefit” asking for financial help in order to bring his research tofruition. He proposed very rewarding conditions for repayment.The chemist Chevreul criticized him very bluntly in a series of four articlesthat appeared in Le Journal des Savants beginning in May 1851. Chevreul hadassembled one of the most extensive libraries of old alchemical manuscripts,which he left to the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris (Chevreul Collection).Then, in 1844, a small book by Alexandre Dumas, Un Alchimiste au XIXe siècle,was printed in Paris. This book dealt with a friend of the author’s, ViscountHenri de Ruolz, who was of German origin but whose family had lived in Francefor three centuries.A doctor of law and of medicine, Ruolz’s sole passions were music and chemistry.Though he opted for medicine, he actually began conducting alchemicalexperiments. In doing this he connected with two of his friends: Albert CharlesErnest Franquet de Franqueville, of the graduating class of 1827, who worked forthe roads department, and Frantz de Mont-Richer.Henri de Ruolz and Mont-Richer tried to make diamonds rather than gold, and theysucceeded. The great-nephew of Franqueville, Dubreton (École Polytechnique1901), affirms that Alexandre Dumas’s story is reliable.During the same period, in 1850, there was published in England a curious bookwritten by Mary Anne Atwood (maiden name: South) and entitled A SuggestiveInquiry into the Hermetic Mystery. Her father was a scholar of classical andmedieval philosophy.She studied Latin and Greek as an aid in drawing up a classification index forancient knowledge. First, she published an anonymous essay that caused quite astir in esoteric circles: “Early Magnetism in Its Higher Relations to Humanityas Veiled in the Poets and the Prophets.” At the age of thirty-seven, her bookon alchemy was presented to the public. More than one hundred copies had beensold when, with the assistance of her father, she set up a bonfire on the lawnof their house in Gosport in order to burn the remaining books as well as thosealready sold that she was able to retrieve. A few copies, however, must haveescaped, for in 1918, an edition from W. Tait appeared with a preface by W. L.Wilmshurst. This edition was reprinted in 1960 in New York by the Julian Press.Mary Anne Atwood died in 1910 at the age of ninety-seven, having never spoken ofthis affair."},{"pageContent":"2THE TENOR OF THE TIMESWe shall now enter the era into which the works of Fulcanelli thrust theirroots: the domain of occultists and Freemasonry at the end of the nineteenthcentury and the beginning of the twentieth century.

Individuals from all social classes who shared a similarenthusiasm were able to work side by side. There was an amazing burgeoning ofideas in which alchemy played a leading part.Strange characters appeared, studying in secret the art of Hermes. One amongthem, a shoemaker by trade, Rémi Pierret,b[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1576_0] who occupied the concierge’s quarters at12 passage Ménilmontant, Paris, had assembled one of the most importantalchemical libraries of the nineteenth century. The likes of Papus,c[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1578_0] Stanislas de Guaita, Albert Poisson,Victor-Émile Michelet, and Marc Havend [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1580_0]very often paid him visits in order to discuss with him the passionate interestthey shared. But the indisputable master of this era was the gentleman fromLorraine, Stanislas de Guaita, who died in 1897 at age thirty-eight.A copy of his work La Clef de la Magie Noire (The Key to Black Magic) that hadbelonged to Jules Boucher was annotated by Fulcanelli on the pages dealing withalchemy.¹ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1742_0] This information is given by RobertAmadou in his last article on the topic, entitled “L’Affaire Fulcanelli,” thatappeared in the journal L’Autre Monde (Another World). In fact, the annotationsin question are reproduced in this article.Albert Poissone [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1582_0] was an intimate friend ofStanislas de Guaita and had frequent exchanges with him. A bibliophile and ascholar, he became interested in alchemy at the age of twelve and browsedassiduously in used bookstores in order to uncover old treatises. He studiedrelentlessly during the morning in his apartment-laboratory on the rueSaint-Denis and in the afternoon earned his living at the laboratory of theFaculty of Medicine. Unfortunately, he was to die prematurely at the age oftwenty-five, a victim of tuberculosis contracted in the army.In 1888, Stanislas de Guaita, with the help of Papus and Joséphin Péladan,decided to establish a new, so-called kabbalistic, Rosicrucian order of whichthe Supreme Council was to include six known members and six hidden members. Thegrand master was Guaita; Barletf [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1586_0] andPapus subsequently replaced him. Oswald Wirth,²[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1744_0] Lucien Lejay, and Paul Adam also belonged tothe group, and later, Marc Haven, Augustin Chaboseau, and Sédirg[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1588_0] (who resigned in 1909) were associatedwith it.After two years, Joséphin Péladan separated from Papus and Guaita to form theEsthetic and Catholic Rosicrucian Order, a sort of intellectual Tiers-Ordre.h[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1590_0] This movement was to attract a wholegroup of painters, writers, and musicians; among those who joined were ErikSatie; Alfred Jarry, who, influenced by hermetic symbolism, would allow hisconvictions to show through in his works; Count A. de la Rochefoucauld; Gary deLacroze; and Saint-Pol-Roux.Beginning in 1923, Joséphin Péladan further organized six Rosicrucian salonsattended by Gauguin, Zola, and Verlaine. His initiative proved fortunate, for ithelped to make known these artists and writers who subsequently became famous.As for Papus, it is clear that he was very active in esoteric circles duringthese years. He was familiar with the artistic high society of Paris and was aregular at the Chat Noir cabaret, which had been established and run by RodolpheSalis and about whose sign Fulcanelli made an interesting comment in TheDwellings of the Philosophers.³ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1746_0]There Papus was to meet Ferdinand de Lesseps, Augusta Holmes, and the singerEmma Calvé, whose name is forever linked to the disturbing story ofRennes-le-Château. The first two were keenly interested in esotericism andparticipated actively in spiritualistic séances. We will see later how the nameEmma Calvé can be shown to be connected to that of Fulcanelli.Among Papus’s contacts was Anatole France, who ran a glossy journal to whichMaurice Barrès and Victor-Émile Michelet contributed. It was through thisjournal that Papus was able to be in touch with Anatole France. For his part,France, in putting together his novel La Rôtisserie de la Reine Pédauque,borrowed complete pages from Montfaucon de Villars’s work Le Comte de Gabalis.⁴[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1748_0]Every Wednesday in Paris, society figures gathered at the home of the countessGaston d’Adhémar. Among them could be found Papus,i[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1592_0] Joséphin Péladan, the bookstoreproprietor Edmond Bailly, Gary de Lacroze, and many others. Starting in 1889,all these figures of the artistic high society of Paris went to dine everyThursday at the home of Georges Poirel, developer of a phototype process, on therue de la Tour-d’Auvergne. Besides Papus, de Guaita, and Péladan, other inviteeswere Oswald Wirth, Émile Goudeau,j [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1594_0] andÉdouard Schuré. Ideas were exchanged and someone spoke of the latestpublications on alchemy—for example, Origines de l’Alchimie by Berthelot, orpossibly the work of Louis Figuier, the famous historian of this discipline.⁵[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1750_0] Tiffereau also attracted attention; he wasactually the leading figure in the field of alchemy.k[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1597_0]However, Georges Poirel left and settled in Brittany, where he eventually becamea captain of long-range vessels.Because they wanted to pursue these fruitful exchanges, the participants decidedto form a group under the name Groupe Indépendant d’Études Ésotériques(Independent Group for Esoteric Studies). It began its functions on December 7,1889, and continued until 1894, when it changed its name to the École Hermétique(Hermetic School).The group included scholars, poets, artists, and writers. Among the best known,we can name Paul Adam, Victor-Émile Michelet, Péladan, Guaita, Poisson, Barlet,Lacroze, le Colonel de Rochas, Sédir, Marc Haven, Augustin Chaboseau, Phaneg,Doctor Rozier, Jollivet-Castelot, and Chamuel (Lucien Mauchel). At the urging ofPapus and Villiers de l’Isle-Adam, Chamuel opened a shop as well as a library atthe sign of the Librairie du Merveilleux (Bookstore of the Marvelous), 29 rue deTrévise, and, in the same street a little farther along, a room where lectureswere held every week.In 1888 Papus started the journal L’Initiation.l[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1599_0] He was twenty-three years old. All theleading figures of the era wrote for it. This journal continued until 1912 andin 1891 was placed on the index [of forbidden books] by the Catholic Church. [offorbidden books] by the Catholic Church. In 1890, Papus also began the Voiled’Isis, the mouthpiece of the Groupe Indépendant d’Études Ésotériques. Grillotde Givry⁶ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1752_0] was one of his collaborators. Thefirst issue appeared on November 12, 1890; the editor in chief was AugustinChaboseau, Hidden Superior, and the secretary was Lucien Mauchel (Chamuel). TheVoile d’Isis was later named Les Études Traditionnelles.Various groups belonged to the Groupe Indépendant d’Études Ésotériques, one ofwhich was the École Sociétaire which was founded by Fourier.Concurrently, Papus laid the foundations of the Martinist movement, whichenjoyed prodigious growth from 1890 to 1914 in most European countries. TheSupreme Council was made up of Stanislas de Guaita, Maurice Barrès, and Péladan.These last two were replaced by Marc Haven and Victor-Émile Michelet. Paul Adam,F. Ch. Barlet, Chaboseau (then librarian of the Musée Guimet), Chamuel, Lejay,Montière, and Sédir were also members of this council. Papus was the president,⁷[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1754_0] receiving an initiation from Henri Delage.The lineage was as follows: Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin, Antoine Chaptal, HenriDelage,m [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1601_0] Papus. This lineage, which wassubsequently contested, is given by Jean-Marie Parent and Roger Facon in Secteset Sociétés Secrètes aujourd’hui . . . (Sects and Secret Societies Today …).⁸[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1756_0]The members of the Martinist association met at the bookstore of the occultistEdmond Bailly, whose shop on the rue de la Chausséed’Antin, marked by the signl’Art Indépendant, was frequented by both those from the Symbolist Movement andthose fascinated by esotericism. Edmond Bailly published the journals La HauteScience (The High Science) and L’Étoile (The Star); Jules Bois, the editor ofthese journals, was the lover of the singer Emma Calvé.Into this cozy retreat thronged writers such as Huysmans, Mallarmé, Villiers del’Isle-Adam, Félicien Rops, the painter Odilon Redon, Henri de Reigner, PierreLouys, and the musicians Debussy, Erik Satie, and many others. In his book LesCompagnons de la Hiérophanie (The Fellows of Hierophancy), Victor-Émile Micheletdescribes for us a number of these figures.The accredited students of the École Hermétique (formerly the Groupe Indépendantd’Études Ésotériques) entered Martinist lodges called le Sphynx, la Sphynge,Hermanubus, and Véléda. Martinism was supposed to have been the antechamber of amuch older order, the H.B. of Luxor (Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor). In fact,this turned out not to be the case, and the Kabbalistic Rosicrucian Order becamethe inner circle. The route then became: École Hermétique to Martinism to theKabbalistic Rosicrucian Order. After the death of its founder, Stanislas deGuaita, it was F. Ch. Barlet who became the grand master. When he resigned,Papus claimed to be the successor to Barlet and therefore grand master of theorder, whereas Barlet had passed on the title and the archives to René Guénon.⁹[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1758_0]F. Ch. Barlet (1838–1921) was the official representative in France of the H.B.of L. It was an extremely secretive fraternity revived around 1870.

Close to thirty thousand intellectualswere affiliated with the brotherhood, one of whom was Abraham Lincoln. Memberscould be found in Scotland, Egypt, and America. The teaching related to apractice intended to develop spiritual faculties and was based on the theoriesand practices of P. B. Randolph, author of the well-known Magia Sexualis.¹¹[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1762_0]Serge Hutin assures us in his book Paul Sédir, Histoire des Rose-Croix (PaulSédir: History of the Rosicrucians) that Randolph was a member of thisfraternity, and Pierre Mariel, in his Dictionnaire des Sociétés Secrètes(Dictionary of Secret Societies), notes that Papus, Chaboseau, and Marc Havenwere as well.But let us return to the École Hermétique (formerly Groupe Indépendant d’ÉtudesÉsotériques), which ran courses four times a week at 13 rue Séguier. Many peopletook these courses. The proceedings were conducted by F. Ch. Barlet, Papus,Sédir, Phaneg, and so forth, and among the students was Jollivet-Castelot, whomet most of the occultists of his time this way. He joined the MartinistSociety.In his largely autobiographical book, Le Destin (Destiny), he competentlydescribes the most famous figures of the 1890s. Papus is described as “jovial,cordial, with a somewhat common exterior and an untidy appearance . . .occupying lodgings at Auteuil, Villa Montmorency.”Sédir was seen as “an often arcane lecturer, looking down on his listeners,living in a garret on the avenue de l’Opéra.” Guaita is described as being“thickset, authoritarian, disdainful of the commonplace.” Also, we learn thatSaint-Yves d’Alveydre lived “in a sumptuous residence in Versailles, peacefuland furnished luxuriously. He received visitors in a little salon adjacent tohis study; he spoke quietly and well and dressed in purple velvet.”In 1896, Jollivet-Castelot formed the Société Alchimique de France and launchedthe journal L’Hyperchimie—a monthly journal of alchemy, hermetic science, andspagyric medicine. It appeared regularly for about ten years. Sédir was theeditor in chief and Jollivet-Castelot the director. In 1904 it was revamped andtook the name Nouveaux Horizons de la Science et de la Pensée (New Horizons inScience and Thought); it continued to be published until 1914. After 1920, itbecame La Rose-Croix (The Rosy Cross). In 1939, Jollivet-Castelot died at Douaiafter having generated a great deal of press due to his experiments withtransmutation and the making of gold. The recipe was generously revealed in hisjournal, and an engineer from Lyons successfully repeated his experiments.Jollivet-Castelot, the “hyperchemist,” left us several publications, includingComment On devient alchimiste (How One Becomes an Alchemist) in 1897 and in1901, La Science alchimiste (The Science of Alchemy).During the same period, in 1898, a Spaniard, Antonio de Paula Novellas y Roig,published the text of a lecture, “L’Alchimie et les Alchimistes” (Alchemy andthe Alchemists), that he had delivered to the Groupe Scolaire Raymond Lulle¹²[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1764_0] in Barcelona. He professed to be passionateabout spagyric methods, notably a preparation called La Thériaquen[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1603_0] He was an astonishing man who frequentedthe scientific circles of his time and professed theories derived from theancient hermetic tradition.We will now sketch the connections that René Guénon maintained with theseesoteric circles and show the close ties that linked him to the small group inwhich the works signed “Fulcanelli” were developed.At the beginning of 1908, René Guénon, who was taking courses at the ÉcoleHermétique that were given by Papus and his friends, joined the Martinist Order.Some younger members met at a hotel at 17 rue des Canettes in Paris. Theypracticed automatic writing, and a certain Jean Desjobert acted as a medium.This little group was noteworthy by the presence at its core of Lucien Faugeron,disciple in hermetic science of Pierre Dujols; and Alexandre Thomas, theassociate of the same Pierre Dujols at the Librairie du Merveilleux.During a séance, the pseudo-entity who spoke through the medium Desjobert gavethe order to bring René Guénon to the next séance. He came and was exhorted tocreate an Ordre du Temple Rénové (Order of the Temple Renewed) of which he wasto be the head. The “spirits” who manifested during this period were:Cagliostro, Jacques de Molay,o [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1605_0] Frederickthe Great, and Weishaupt. High society indeed!On February 23, 1908, the ritual of this new Ordre du Temple was laid down withseven grades and twelve members. The founding of this movement finalized thebreak between Guénon and Papus, who excluded Guénon from his groups. But in1911, the “masters” who controlled the medium ordered René Guénon to dissolvethe order. This was done. According to André Gilis,¹³[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1766_0] this ephemeral revival of the Ordre du Templewas the privileged ground from which the work of Guénon sprang forth.A related influence was the mediumistic séances of the Mouvement Cosmique,founded in 1900 by Max Théon after the disbanding of the H.B. of L (1887–88). F.Ch. Barlet supported the diffusion of the ideas coming from this movement bymeans of meetings and a journal called La Revue Cosmique. Well-known peopleworked hard to support this organization. Among them were Anna de Noailles,Édouard Schuré, the Hellenist Mario Meunier, and Dr. Serge Voronoff, who wasconnected to Jean-Julien Champagne by an incident recounted by Robert Ambelain,which we will speak about again later. The editorial secretary of the La RevueCosmique was Julien Lejay, a well-known Martinist.Max Théon, founder of the Mouvement Cosmique and an adept of the defunct H.B. ofLuxor, traveled to France in 1888 and to Paris in 1920. He claimed to be aninitiate who had achieved earthly immortality, and he seemed to possess numerouspowers. From a state of contemplation, his wife, an Irish poetess, wrote thetexts of the Cosmic Philosophy. She died in 1908 during a trip to Jersey. MaxThéon lived until 1926, the year of his death, at Tlemcen, in Algeria. Accordingto Pierre Geyraud, “the guardian of Cosmic Philosophy originated in Tunisia; hisname, Aia Aziz, was often replaced in the Revue Cosmique by his emblem, alotus.”¹⁴ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1768_0]In 1911, René Guénon entered the Thébah Lodge of the Grand Lodge of France,conforming to the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. He had been refused by thelodge called Travail et Vrais Amis Fidèles (Work and True Faithful Friends). In1917 at the latest, he ended his Masonic activities. At the same time, heapplied for admission to the Église Gnostique (gnostic church), excommunicatedby Rome, which was formed at the end of the nineteenth century by Jules Doinel,then directed by Fabre des Essarts (Synésius). The young Guénon, under theinitiatory name Palingénius (with a homophonic wink to his given name: rené =renaît = reborn),p [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1607_0] became its bishop in1909.Certain members of this church were very refined: Albert de Pouvourville(Matgioi), who was connected with Taoism, and Lucien Champrenaud, who wasconnected with Islam under the name Abdul-Haqq.In November 1909, Guénon, still using the pseudonym Palingénius and incollaboration with others from the Ordre du Temple Rénové, notably A. Thomas(initiatory name: Marnès), created the journal La Gnose (Gnosis, 1909–12),published by the Librairie du Merveilleux, which was run by Pierre Dujols andThomas. In 1928 he contributed to the Italian journal Ignis.At the great Spiritualist and Masonic Conference of 1908, René Guénon was theoffice secretary and wore the silk cordon of Kadosh of the Swedenborgian Rite.q[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1609_0]Now we shall outline here the connections among the alchemists and thinkers ofdifferent countries.In 1924 and 1927, two journals appeared in Italy, Athanor and Ignis, that weredevoted to the exposition of initiatory doctrine. Arturo Reghinir[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1612_0] directed them and contributed as well tothe Voile d’Isis. It was he who introduced René Guénon to Julius Evola,s[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1614_0] who was at the time head of the groupcalled Ur, which published monographs in which the articles were signed withpseudonyms: EA was the pseudonym of Evola; Pietro Negri was that of ArturoReghini; Luce was the pen name of G. Parise; Leo was used by the anthroposophistColazza; and the appellation Abraxas was taken by the hermeticist ErcoleQuadrelli.t [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1616_0]The Ur group published ten issues in 1927, two of which were double, and eightissues in 1928, two of which were double and one of which was triple. It was inOctober 1928 that the two directors of the journal, Reghini and Parise,departed.Evola claimed that these two directors wanted to snatch away from him thepublication of monographs by Ur so that they would be controlled by individualswho were keeping Freemasonry alive at a time when it was illegal in Italy. Afterthis break, Evola alone remained responsible for the journal, which took thename Krur. Its last issue appeared in 1929.In 1928 the Chacornac brothers offered to René Guénon the directorship of thejournal Le Voile d’Isis, for which Grillot de Givry¹⁵[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1770_0] was writing from time to time, though Guénonwanted to be just the editor.Patrice Gentil contributed as well to this journal. Under the evocativepseudonym Mercuranus, he also wrote for La Gnose, published by the Librairie duMerveilleux, which was owned by Dujols and Thomas. He met René Guénon in 1908 atcourses given at Papus’s École Hermétique, in the Martinist Order, in the ÉgliseGnostique, and ultimately in the Ordre du Temple Rénové. He worked for the gascompany as a meter reader, which allowed him to meet others who might have been,like himself, interested in Tradition. He was connected with the Kabbalist PaulVulliaud and many others.There were also ties between René Guénon and Madame Dina. Heiress to one ofAmerica’s largest fortunes, Madame Dina was the wife of an alchemist whose workwas just beginning to become known. Assan Farid Dina, of East Indian origin, wasan electrical engineer, philosopher, and specialist in the religions andphilosophies of India who gave lectures in Paris in 1911–12.Assan Farid Dina transformed, modernized, and decorated the Château desAvenières at Cruseilles near Annecy (see fig. 2.1[../Text/02.html#anchor_194_0]). In the chapel of this residence, gold-leafmosaics representing the major arcana of the Tarot (see fig. 2.2[../Text/02.html#anchor_205_0]) were discovered in 1967 by Bertrand Jacquet inthe presence of several witnesses. It was the first time in the history ofhermetic art that a chapel dedicated to the Tarot had been created usingastonishing images from the cards. In 1978, in another chateau belonging toDina, at Bar-sur-Seine, near Troyes, a temple to the Tarot (incorporatingbas-reliefs representing the minor arcana) was discovered, as was his firstalchemical book, La Science Philosophique (Philosophic Science), published in1917 under the pseudonym A. M. A., and his second book, La Destinée: La Mort etSes Hypothèses (Destiny, Death, and Their Hypotheses), published in 1927 underhis real name just shortly before his passing.[../Images/img0066.jpg]Fig. 2.1. The Château des Avenières, near Cruseilles (Haute-Savoie).Property of A. F.

The Dina Foundation¹⁶[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1772_0] is soon to publish a book on his life andwork as an adept who was a contemporary of Guénon and Fulcanelli.After the death of her husband, Madame Dina founded the Véga Bookstore at 43 rueMadame, and took on René Guénon as director of her series “L’Anneau d’Or” (TheGolden Ring), which she had created for him. She came close to embarking on asecond marriage with him and lived with him for several months at Avenières.René Guénon, accompanied by Madame Dina, left for Egypt on March 5, 1930, in aneffort to find Sufi texts for the series. Because the sojourn there took longerthan expected, however, Madame Dina had to return to Paris alone.Upon her return, she met Ernest Britt at the home of Dr. Rouhier, the commercialdirector of Véga, and the two were married. Her new husband hated René Guénonand was the cause of the break between him and Madame Dina. She stopped sendingGuénon money and turned over to Dr. Rouhier the management of the bookstore andits publishing house, Éditions Véga. This turn of events placed René Guénon in adifficult financial situation.Ernest Britt, firm friend of Oswald Wirth, belonged to a group of occultiststhat also included Piobb (Pierre Vincenti). As for Alexandre Rouhier,u[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1618_0] he too belonged to a secret society,called Le Grand Lunaire (The Great Lunary), which based its work on books byRené Schwaller de Lubicz, Crowley, and Fulcanelli.[../Images/img0068.jpg]Fig. 2.2.

The baphomet served as theiremblem. It is said that when Jules Boucher left the Grand Lunaire—withdifficulty, it should be noted—he had to have himself exorcised at Lyons by thegnostic bishop Monseigneur Jean Bricaud. He was terrorized by the members ofthis society, especially by Gaston Sauvage. It should be mentioned that he hadbeen subjected to the Ceremony of the Curse.[../Images/img0062.jpg]Fig. 2.3.

He claims thatChampagne allowed himself to be dragged into a deplorable collaboration, andthat Rouhier and Boucher “often went at night to the dolmen of Meudon, armedwith their portable occultum from the Grand Lunaire.”"},{"pageContent":"[../Images/img0011.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"3THE ART OF INTERPRETING THE PHILOSOPHER’S STONE, OR THE APPEARANCE OF WORKSSIGNED “FULCANELLI”We have just viewed a picture of the occultist ferment at the end of thenineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. In this we have been ableto identify most of the players who participated in the creation of the mostfabulous legend there has ever been: the myth of the adept Fulcanelli.Let us now investigate in more detail this fascinating business and see how afew individuals, all connected by their membership in groups concerned withmagic or spiritualism or in the Freemasonry movement, were able, owing to thepublication of two books, to assist the resurgence of alchemy.It is appropriate first to point out that for a long time—since the sixteenthcentury, in fact—Gothic architecture had been considered barbaric. This was trueto such an extent that during the French Revolution, a decree was issuedordering the destruction of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. We owe thepreservation of this marvelous edifice to the intelligence of one man:Charles-François Dupuy pointed out that the cathedral’s sculptures containedteachings on science, art, and philosophy, and, in doing so, saved it fromdestruction.¹ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1776_0] In 1831, Victor Hugo publishedhis novel Notre-Dame-de-Paris. In its composition he had drawn from material inalchemical works—but he allowed an odor of sulfur to emanate from hisphilosopher of hermetic science. It was thanks to this book, however, thatpublic opinion was sensitized and that the architect Viollet-le-Duc was able toundertake restoration work on the building starting in 1845.In his Cours de Philosophie Hermétique (Course in Hermetic Philosophy), FrançoisCambriel presented this monument as an edifice with an alchemical character.Before him, Esprit Gobineau de Montluisant² [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1778_0]had already addressed this question in his book in which he reveals the hermeticaspects of Notre Dame.Nevertheless, it was not until 1926 that there appeared, to generalindifference, a book with the title Le Mystère des Cathédrales. Signed“Fulcanelli,” and with a press run of three hundred copies, it was published bySchémit at 45 rue Laffite in Paris. Le Mystère des Cathédrales was followed in1930 by Les Demeures Philosophales, in one volume, similarly signed, and alsopublished by Schémit."},{"pageContent":"4PIERRE DUJOLS AND THE LIBRAIRIE DU MERVEILLEUXOn January 23, 1877, at 10:10 in the morning, when Jean-Julien Champagne wasborn at Levallois-Perret in the département of the Seine, his parents, bothtwenty-three years old, had no idea that their child would lead a life that wasout of the ordinary, and that he would leave a mark on history. In fact, he wasto be the actor in a prodigious adventure connected with humanity’s mostfabulous myth: that of the philosopher’s stone.Fifteen years earlier, at Saint-Illide in the Cantal region, on March 22, 1862,at 7:00 a.m., Pierre Dujolsa [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1622_0] was born. Hebelonged to one of the most illustrious families in France: the Valois. At thattime his father was engaged in the trade of shoemaker, and his mother, ToinetteLapeyre, was not engaged in a profession. Pierre was the youngest of threechildren; in 1862 his father was forty and his mother forty-four. These twoindividuals—Champagne and Dujols—whose paths ought not to have crossed, soughtout each other’s company and formed a remarkable and complementary tandem. (Seefigs. 4.1 [../Text/04.html#anchor_236_0] and 4.2 [../Text/04.html#anchor_244_0]for copies of the birth certificates of Champagne and Dujols.)[../Images/img0032.jpg]Fig. 4.1. Jean-Julien Champagne’s birth certificate.With his mother’s help, Jean-Julien Champagne, scarcely sixteen years of age andfascinated by the study of ancient alchemical texts, installed a laboratory inthe family home at Villiers-le-Bel. There he devoted himself to his favoritepastime and acquired skills that would later be very useful for his experimentsand would allow him to become a functioning alchemist of prime quality.He continued to study passionately in Parisian libraries, where preciousmanuscripts are ferreted away.At the same time, he registered at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Hisregistration card, number 5996, informs us of his progress as a student of thepainter Léon Gérôme. From this period, an excellent painting has surviveddepicting the bishop of Bordeaux. There are also three of his watercolors from1895 (see fig. 4.3 [../Text/04.html#anchor_250_0]) and a photograph of a verybeautiful miniature pendulum clock that he carved to represent a Gothic church,thereby demonstrating his early interest in the Middle Ages (see fig. 4.4[../Text/04.html#anchor_254_0]).

Numerous personalities gathered inspecialized shops, attracted by the mutual desire of meeting and studyingtogether.One such place, the Librairie du Merveilleux (Bookstore of the Marvelous),founded by Chamuel, was located at 76 rue de Rennes in the 6th arrondissement ofParis. It was taken over by Pierre Dujols and Alexandre Thomas and moved to thislocation, becoming, during the years 1910–11, the gathering place of Hellenisticscholars and well-known Kabbalists. In his book La Vie Simple de René Guénon(The Simple Life of René Guénon), Paul Chacornac describes this place for us. Onentering, the visitor passed a wrought-iron portico and then crossed a flagstonecourtyard in front of the building; the bookstore occupied the second floor,within the staff quarters of the former Chemilly Hotel.¹[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1782_0]In this setting ideas circulated concerning a famous language of signs,forgotten but not lost, called la langue verte, “the green tongue,” or thelanguage of the birds. The master of these quarters, Pierre Dujols, was ascholar of Greek literature and a staunch defender of the Hellenic language,which he insisted was the origin of the French language, and which allowed him,through the etymology of alchemical terms that it provided, to apply aparticular calculation called the hermetic cabala to words and expressions and,by means of this device, to find a precise meaning that was helpful tolaboratory work. He maintained a one-of-a-kind archive on occult sciences thathis friend Jean-Julien Champagne later used. For the time being, his disciple inhermetic science, Faugeronb [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1624_0] (at the timea traveling salesman living at 6 rue des Sabots), was responsible for updatingthis resource. This same Faugeron, along with Alexandre Thomas, belonged to RenéGuénon’s Ordre du Temple Rénové. Thomas and Guénon, as well as Desjobert, themedium, were “excommunicated” from Martinism in 1909 by Papus and Téder. Allthree were also Freemasons. Pierre Dujols was passionate about alchemy and wasvery discreet. He left behind few traces to prove it, but it is said that he waskeenly interested in this field. An article in Charivari entitled “l’Ère duVerseau” (The Age of Aquarius) provides an echo of this for us:c[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1627_0]Not only do the adherents of Hiéron promote themselves as Templars and Knightsof the Grail, but furthermore do they proclaim themselves as “Apostles of theFinal Times,” those who were called for by the Virgin of la Salette. . . . ”These lines were written in 1925 by a Parisian bookstore owner named PierreDujols—strange man, very scholarly, and according to some, passionate aboutesotericism and alchemy.² [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1784_0]In his book La Pierre Philosophale (The Philosopher’s Stone), in the chapterentitled “Quelques réflexions” (Some Thoughts), the engineer Georges Ranqueprovides information on Pierre Dujols and his connection with alchemy. Hewrites: “Based on their writings, we would think that Magophon and Auriger werefamiliar with the practice of the work. For me, who knew them well, I can statethat they were acquainted with the theory, but the mystery of Mercury andbringing it to life remained for them unsolved all their lives. One of the lastauthors who would have succeeded is Cyliani, whose treatise appeared in 1832.”³[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1786_0]Note that the pseudonym of Dujols is Magophon (Voice of the Mage) and thatGeorges Ranque does not include Fulcanelli as a possible adept.Concerning the name Cyliani, Eugène Canseliet agrees with attributing itsauthorship to Pierre Dujols. In Feu du Soleil (Fire of the Sun), he declares toRobert Amadou: “I add then Cyliani. What a pseudonym! It’s Pierre Dujols whogave him this name.” In L’Alchimie expliquée sur ses textes classiques (AlchemyExplained according to Its Classic Texts), Eugène Canseliet points out that hedoes not know who filled out the name following the first syllable Ci . . . inCyliani, a name that is based on the Silenus who converses with Midas.⁴[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1788_0]As for the works of Fulcanelli, which remain invaluable, they inform us aboutthe etymology of this term: “Cyliani is the equivalent of Cyllenius, from MountCyllene, the mountain where Mercury [Hermes] was born and which gave thisCyllenian god his name.”⁵ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1790_0]The perceptive reader will note a contradiction: Hermès Dévoilé (HermesUnveiled), the publication attributed to Cyliani, appeared in 1832. Uponrepublication of the book by Chacornac in 1915, Pierre Dujols, who was born in1862, could well have filled out the Ci . . . that stood for the author’s name.Yet in 1834, two years after the appearance of Hermès Dévoilé, we find publishedin Paris the Nouveau Recueil d’Ouvrages Anonymes et Pseudonymes (New Collectionof Anonymous and Pseudonymous Works) by a Mr. de Manne.

This was how he came to be an attentive studentof the Jesuits of Aix-en-Provence, where he received a classical education.Having worked as a journalist in Marseilles and in Toulouse, he finally decidedto live in Paris, at 47 rue Denfert-Rochereau (nowadays, rue Henri Barbusse). InParis he organized a salon and hosted dinner parties. His soirées were highlyregarded, for, in addition to his far-reaching knowledge, he was imbued withmystery concerning his ancestry. His brother Antoine, seventeen years hissenior, had written a small pamphlet⁸ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1796_0] offifty-eight pages that appeared in Marseilles in 1879 and gave rise tocontroversy in the local press (the title page is reproduced in figure 4.8, page37).In this work studded with Latin quotations, Antoine Dujols demonstrates thedynastic legitimacy of his family.f [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1642_0] Hepresents evidence to prove that the last member of the Valois line, the fourthson of Catherine de Medici and Henri II, did not die without leaving an heir.François de Valois, duke of Anjou and Alençon, married Jeanne Adélaïde, duchessof Médine Coeli, on April 12, 1575. From this marriage there arose a long lineof male children, the last representative of which is Antoine Dujols de Valois,brother of Pierre, postman at Saint-Chamas, near Aixen-Provence. Antoine Dujolsde Valois was born on August 24, 1845, at Saint-Illide in the Cantal region (seefig. 4.9 [../Text/04.html#anchor_296_0], page 38). In 1888, he lived inMarseilles at 43 boulevard du Nord, and in 1889 he ran in the legislativeelections but was not elected. On July 12, 1892, he died at Salon in Provence atthe age of forty-six.[../Images/img0054.jpg]Fig. 4.7.

Extract from Antoine Dujols’s birth certificate.In addition to his book Valois contre Bourbons (The Conflict between the Valoisand the Bourbons), he wrote a curious little pamphlet of twenty-six pages on theregeneration of grapevines. He published it himself under the name A. de Valois,and affixed his signature to the last page.The family of Pierre Dujols tells anecdotally that his brother, Antoine, calledon the Orléans family in Paris in order to show them important proofs in hispossession concerning his genealogy, and that the family consented to see him.Later, in the town of Salon, where Antoine lived, burglars broke into thequarters he shared with his mother on the rue d’Avignon, attacked them both, andstole these documents as well as the ring that he owned.The Valois family line continued no further, for Antoine had no offspring andhis brother, Pierre, had no sons and two daughters—Yvonne, born in 1888, andMarguerite, born in 1900. One of them was a reader for the duchess of Portland.Pierre’s wife, whose maiden name was Charton, was a woman of rare beauty who,despite her youth, had very long white hair. A native of Hennebont, in Brittany,she married Pierre Dujols in 1887 when she was only nineteen and he wastwenty-five.h [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1651_0]Madame Dujols was gifted with a remarkable clairvoyance; she performed cardreadings and palmistry and very often had premonitory dreams.Regarding Hennebont, we should recall the story of the ring that Fulcanelliowned and which, according to Mr. Canseliet, originated with the abbé of aCistercian monastery that in the twelfth century was a commandery of the KnightsTemplar of Hennebont.The salon of the Dujols, in the 5th arrondissement of Paris, was frequented bythose involved in the world of esotericism. Among them was the well-knownKabbalist, and old friend of Pierre Dujols, Paul Vulliaud, who had aconsiderable interest in the hermetic cabala. Oswald Wirth as well as RenéGuénon also attended regularly and participated in the exchange of ideas.We should recall that in 1905, René Guénon, along with a few young people fromMartinism (Thomas and Faugeron among them), created the famous Ordre du TempleRénové. The woman who was the concierge at 47 rue Denfert-Rochereau reportedlater that Pierre Dujols himself directed the rituals of the order. The husbandof the concierge also participated in the séances. He was a close friend ofDujols and, oddly, passed away one day after he did.The Ordre du Temple Rénové was disbanded in 1911. This was also the year thatPierre Dujols fell seriously ill with the osteoarthritis from which he died onApril 19, 1926, at the age of sixty-four. It was difficult for him to movearound, and in 1921, five years before his death, he became bedridden. EugèneCanseliet saw him in this state, “lying on his sickbed with his folded kneesserving as his desk.”He nevertheless continued to study alchemy, and in 1914 he published Mutus Liberwith an hypotypose. This same year his associate Thomas was killed in the war.This was also a loss for Jean-Julien Champagne, who was Thomas’s faithfulfriend.Pierre Dujols was very connected to esoteric circles. A letter that he wrote toPapus, addressed “Dear Master,” conveys the esteem with which he regarded Dr.Encausse (see fig. 4.11 [../Text/04.html#anchor_316_0]). This missive is undatedbut must nevertheless have been written between 1912, the date of the closing ofthe Librairie du Merveilleux, and 1915–16, for Papus died in 1916.i[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1653_0]Although Dujols’s associates included many who were involved in Freemasonry,nowhere have we found evidence of his belonging to this movement, nor,furthermore, to Martinism. But the striking involvement in his life ofpersonalities from these two movements no doubt allowed him to have heard of, oreven to have known, the scholarly philologist and archaeologist Grasset d’Orcet.Dujols, who died in 1926, and d’Orcet, who died in 1900, could have visited eachother or even written to each other, maintaining a correspondence much like thatof Engineering Commander Levet⁹ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1798_0] and Grassetd’Orcet. Both Levet and d’Orcet were fascinated by cryptography and exchangedmore than three hundred letters. Papus, an acquaintance of Pierre Dujols’s,received a letter from Commander Levet, a Freemason of the Grand Orient Lodge,that seems to prove the connection among these different individuals (fig. 4.12[../Text/04.html#anchor_320_0]). Furthermore, in 1911 a translation of theEnglish The Mystical Traditions by the theosophist Isabel Cooper-Oakley, whichquotes Grasset d’Orcet, appeared in Paris under the title Traditions mystiques.[../Images/img0021.jpg]Fig. 4.10.

Letter from Commander Levet to Papus. Levet had frequentcorrespondence with Grasset d’Orcet.Grasset d’Orcet was born at Aurillac in the Cantal region not far fromSaint-Illide, home territory of the Dujols de Valois family and birthplace ofPierre Dujols. Along with others, he believed in strange reading techniques,which he had discovered in two stages. Applicable to texts as important as thoseof Rabelais, these techniques allowed readers to discover that underlying anapparently commonplace text is a second layer of meaning transmitting a teachingor providing political revelations. His work appeared in the Revue Britannique,a journal published between 1825 and 1901 and founded by Louis-SébastienSaulnier with the aim of promulgating literary and scientific news from England.Fulcanelli quotes Grasset d’Orcet in Le Mystère des Cathédrales, in the chapteron the Cyclic Cross of Hendaye concerning Grasset d’Orcet’s analysis of theSonge de Poliphile,¹⁰ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1800_0] which first appeared inan article in the Revue. Applying cryptographic keys to this work, Grassetd’Orcet claims that “[t]he Dream of Poliphilus is none other than a Masonicgrimoire—that is, an encoded text applied to architecture, no different frommore modern treatises of this kind except for the incomparable richness andnobility of its structures.”Grasset d’Orcet demonstrated an amazing erudition and a nearly exclusiveinterest in the Greek language.j [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1655_0]Another personality aroused the curiosity of the little group forming around theDujols family. Fulcanelli speaks of this in his book Les Demeures Philosophales,at the beginning of the chapter on the hermetic cabala.In the year 1843, those conscripts assigned to the 46th Infantry Regimentgarrisoned at Parisk [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1659_0] could meet each weekwith a very uncommon professor by proceeding across the courtyard of theLouis-Philippe barracks. . . . In the evening he taught the history of France tothe soldiers who wanted to attend, requiring a modest fee and using a methodthat he claimed had been known in the most remote antiquity. In reality, thiscourse that was so attractive for those who attended was based on traditionalphonetic cabala.This unique professor described by Fulcanelli—Allévy, the only teacher of thismethod—is the author of a little pamphlet, L’Histoire de France, Allévysée. (Hepublished the pamphlet himself; see figure 4.13 [../Text/04.html#anchor_348_0]for the title page.) The examples chosen by the alchemist can be found in thisbook, with minor variations.The mnemonic technique employed by this method and elaborated on by thecongenial Allévy is based on rebus and wordplay (see fig. 4.14[../Text/04.html#anchor_352_0]).According to letters of recommendation and the congratulations that wereaddressed to him by the colonels (see fig. 4.15 [../Text/04.html#anchor_356_0]),it seems clear that his method was appreciated and that it gave excellentresults.Here is an example:Clovis I, dit Le Grand (“Clovis I called the Great”)Un enfant est attaché sur une chaise par un grand clou à vis (“A child isattached to a chair by a great nail with screw thread”)The structure can then be read as follows:Grand clou-vis, Clovis, le grand (“Great nail-screw, Clovis, the Great”)Fulcanelli has Clovis ascending the throne in 466; Allévy, who is right, in 481.Allévy was also the inventor of a perpetual dial mechanism (bought by KingLéopold) showing days of the week and working for all calendar years between1600 and 3099, as well as an “Allévy conjugator,” which reduced all French verbsto a single conjugation.[../Images/img0055.jpg]Fig. 4.13.

Various testimonials about the effectiveness of the Allévy method.Pierre Dujols was a lover of music, which he had studied with the Jesuits atAix-en-Provence. He was a chorister and had even written a book on music.The famous singer Emma Calvé was very much in evidence at the salon and in thehome of Mr. and Mrs. Dujols. She had a strong interest in esoteric science andwas a regular at the bookstore of Edmond Bailly, L’Art Indépendant, where shemet Debussy, Satie, and many others.Born on August 15, 1858, at Decazeville, she was taken on by the Théâtre de laMonnaie, in Brussels, which proved to be the beginning of a splendid career. Herreal name was Calvet, but her teacher Puget advised her to remove the t from hername for her life in the theater.Contrary to what many authors have claimed, the lyric singer was not related tothe clairvoyant from la Salette, Mélanie Calvat, whose name was really Calvatdit Mathieu.Her lover was the famous Jules Bois, who was very involved in magic, and theirrelationship was well known. Bois, who was a handsome man from Marseilles, hadbeen initiated into Lodge Number 7, AHATOR, of the Hermetic Order of the GoldenDawn. He wrote Petites Religions de Paris (Small Religions of Paris) in 1894,Satanisme et la Magie (Satanism and Magic) in 1895, and Le Monde invisible (TheInvisible World) in 1902. He was also editor of the journal Étoile, produced bythe bookstore L’Art Indépendant, where he no doubt met Emma Calvé. For her part,she bought a building called Cabrières, a small fortress that could have housedthe mysterious kabbalistic work owned by Nicolas Flamel¹¹[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1802_0]—the book of Abraham known by the nameAschmezareph. This title was part of a larger work, the second segment of whichwas entitled La Sagesse Divine (Divine Wisdom). It was owned, it seems, byStanislas de Guaita.The name Emma Calvé is also known to us through her connection with AbbéSaunière, whose fame relates to the strange affair of Rennes-le-Château. Thisabbé, who was at least a little peculiar, had apparently discovered documents inthe crypt of his church and had come to Paris in the hope of finding aknowledgable person who could help decipher them—whom he did meet at the churchof Saint-Sulpice. Upon his return, in his own parish, he discovered (completelyunexpectedly) a treasure trove as well as documents that proved the survival ofa Merovingian family line. There exists extensive literature as well as atelevision film on this topic.Abbé Saunière’s associate Abbé Boudet, curé at Rennes-les-Bains, a village nearhis own, was an even more enigmatic figure. Abbé Boudet produced a work entitledLa Véritable Langue Celtique (The Real Celtic Language)l[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1661_0]—very scholarly and full of strangethings—that would have been not at all uninteresting to our friends at theLibrairie du Merveilleux. In it he shows by means of the phonetic cabala thatthe single language that was spoken before Babel was modern English preserved bythe Tectosages.m [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1663_0]Thus he gave a very instructive explanation of Genesis. Here is an example ofhis method:Moïse (Moses; pronounced moe-EEZ in French)To mow (moe)—that is, harvestTo ease (eez)—that is, deliver, release.Moses worked in the fields and had been adopted by Pharaoh’s daughter and thusdelivered from his labors. This contradicts the official version, which holdsthat Moses was found in a basket floating on the water."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/img0009.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"5JEAN-JULIEN CHAMPAGNE AND RENÉ SCHWALLER DE LUBICZIn 1910, the young René Schwaller, then twenty-three, arrived in Paris. In theyears prior to the war, he studied painting with Matisse and, very attracted tometaphysics, made contact with the Theosophical Society, which was then at itsheight. This association brought him into contact with numerous occultists andardent spiritualists. He was also a regular at the Librairie du Merveilleux,where he was immediately fascinated by this group’s interest in the phoneticcabala.As an artist, he also frequented the home of Edmond Bailly, owner of L’ArtIndépendant bookstore on the rue de la Chaussée-d’Antin, where a theatrical andartistic crowd regularly gathered.It is this bookstore owned by Bailly that also published his first book, a studyof numbers, a subject that fascinated him.¹ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1806_0]In his free time he relaxed at the Closerie-des-Lilas café in Montparnasse. Oneday in 1913, a meeting took place there that would be significant for the circleof Jean-Julien Champagne and for the reemergence of alchemy as we now know it.The painter Jean-Julien Champagne, who had been the pupil of Léon Gérôme, wasalso a regular at this famous Parisian haunt. From 1907 on, he was connected tothe de Lesseps family, who lived in a superb mansion on the avenue Montaigne inParis. He gained entry to this wealthy milieu through the family chauffeur.The sons of Ferdinand-Marie de Lesseps,a [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1667_0]especially Bertrand and Ferdinand-Jules, were interested in, and in factfascinated by, the science of Hermes. They suggested that Jean-Julien Champagnetake up residence in the laboratory that Ferdinand owned on the rue Vernier, inthe 17th arrondissement. It consisted of a two-room suite with a view of MontValérien. Champagne moved in and was therefore able to work on the developmentof the Great Work. He had as a disciple a man named Max Roset, and his materialexistence was ensured by the de Lesseps family, who employed him as anindustrial designer.It is in these quarters that Champagne engaged in the design of a propeller thatlater became the propulsion device on a polar sled he invented (see fig. 5.1[../Text/05.html#anchor_393_0]). He proceeded to carry out trials of the devicewith Raymond Roussel, his novelist friend.In his book Deux Logis Alchimiques (Two Alchemical Abodes),²[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1808_0] Champagne’s disciple Eugène Canselietpublished a photograph of this fabulous propeller sled that was so ahead of itstime.It was also on this street, the rue Vernier, at number 5, that the famous abbéJulio established his chapel. Robert Ambelain records this fact in his bookL’Abbé Julio.³ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1810_0]In 1911, Bernard de Lesseps ultimately proposed that Jean-Julien Champagne cometo live in a spare corner of the de Lesseps mansion on the avenue Montaigne andcommitted to a monthly stipend of five hundred francs for Champagne’s work onthe polar sled.With the death of Félix Gaboriaub [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1669_0] in thatsame year, Champagne lost the man who initiated him into alchemy. (Examples ofGaboriau’s letters are reproduced in figure 5.3; see pages 56–57.)[../Images/img0047.jpg]Fig. 5.1. Turbo-propulsion device under construction, June 1914; trial, July1914—Jean-Julien Champagne, the avenue Montaigne.Our painter Champagne frequented two worlds that existed side by side andintermingled. In the world of literature, for example, Anatole France, who wasoften invited to the de Lesseps home, was also interested in occultism and,particularly, in spiritualism. He even participated in a few séances, which lefthim with some rather unpleasant memories.All these people were involved in alchemy—a fashionable pursuit of those times.Courses in hermetic science were offered by a wide range of groups.The brothers Chacornac, friends of Dujols, also employed Champagne in theirbookstore on the riverbank in Paris. His work involved receiving books coming infrom private libraries, generally from the provinces, evaluating them, andshelving them. This was hardly an unpleasant task, for he was always on thelookout for old books dealing with alchemy.[../Images/img0010.jpg]Fig. 5.2. A sample of the handwriting of Jean-Julien Champagne.[../Images/img0005.jpg][../Images/img0065.jpg]Fig. 5.3 Letters from Gaboriau, the man who initiated Champagne. (Documentskindly supplied by the Municipal Library of Lyons)Now it happened that one day, when he was busy classifying books, a rare copy ofone of Newton’s writings fell into his hands.⁴[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1812_0] Upon opening it, he discovered a six-pagemanuscript from 1830 that consisted of notes taken by a researcher in the courseof his experiments and articulating his success. Champagne stole these preciousleaves and took them home to study them further.Already exulting in the idea of being able to obtain a similar result forhimself, he discovered to his great joy that the document spoke of alchemicalmanipulations leading to the famous blue and red colors that were used in thestained-glass windows of Chartres Cathedral.From then on he delved into the manuscript and tried to decipher it, spendingmany hours in the laboratory, but with no success.Then one day in 1913, while he was at the Closerie-des-Lilas, as was his custom,he noticed René Schwaller, who, he knew, had a great interest in alchemy and astrong knowledge of chemistry. Champagne approached him and proposed a readingof the manuscript he had discovered, with a view to possible collaboration.Self-interest guided him—if he had been able to resolve the problem himself, heundoubtedly never would have shown these pages to the future Egyptologist.c[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1671_0] Schwaller was immediately interested.Besides alchemy, René Schwaller displayed a great curiosity for theories on thecomposition of matter. In fact, he disapproved totally of the work on the atom,which, he was to say later, presented great dangers for humanity. This was aposition he maintained all his life, and the facts have not proved him wrong.d[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1674_0]Schwaller’s work with numbers led him to study architectural forms and thecathedrals in particular. During his stay in Paris, he often went to Notre DameCathedral in order to observe its architecture and sculptures. In this way, hestudied the symbolism of the cathedrals and their relationship to the art ofalchemy. In fact, he had drafted a manuscript on this topic.That is why the few pages that Champagne showed him stirred him so strongly. Thetwo men negotiated a contract: Schwaller would contribute a monthly payment tothe painter that would allow him to support himself and, in return, Champagnewas to work on the operational aspects—Schwaller would clarify the theory andChampagne, an excellent technician in the laboratory, would carry out theexperiments.[../Images/img0052.jpg]Fig. 5.4. The dedication from Pierre Dujols to Fulcanelli. Translation: “To myold and faithful friend, the Philosopher-Adept: Open to the ingenious, / Andclosed to fools, / I offer you this reading /.For our elucidation. Magophon—Pierre Dujols, March 18, 1920”In the contract, one condition was stipulated: Whatever happened, whether theysucceeded or failed, neither was to reveal the existence of this contract, andupon its expiration, the two would go their separate ways without evermentioning the subject again.The nonobservance of this pact was to have fatal consequences for Champagne. Atleast, that is how Schwaller later explained the ultimate decline of hispartner.Jean-Julien Champagne thus carried out his experiments while the upheaval of warbattered France. Schwaller was mobilized to work in a military laboratorycarrying out nutrition analyses; nevertheless, he continued to pursue hisexperiments with the alchemist. He recognized Champagne as a master, both forhis erudition in alchemical symbolism and for his extraordinary mastery of theoperational aspects of the science.At the same time, Champagne continued to work at the home of the de Lessepsfamily, and in July 1914 the first trials of his propeller were successfullyconducted.It was quite a happy crowd that then gathered at the avenue Montaigne. Amongthem were certain symbolist poets such as André Breton, who was later connectedwith Eugène Canseliet. Champagne also regularly frequented his friend Dujols’splace. Dujols was working on his introduction to the Mutus Liber,e[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1677_0] and the two discussed alchemy, symbolism,and the hermetic cabala.Schwaller later told André VandenBroeck about the obsession that emanated fromthis group: to try and explain everything using the Greek language. Schwallerfound this approach obsolete and not corresponding to our times. For him, theonly cabala that was possible and contemporary was that based on Egyptianhieroglyphics.In 1915, Eugène Canseliet was introduced to Champagne. He was sixteen years old;the painter was thirty-eight. Dujols was fifty-three and Schwaller twenty-eight.Eugène Canseliet did not hesitate to become the attentive student of this masterwhom he admired so much and whom he served all his life. In the first years, heacted as an assistant for Champagne’s courses.Canseliet actually became the pivot in manipulations of which he remained quiteunaware—a kind of hoax that would take a turn its perpetrators did not perhapsforesee.In fact, thanks to Champagne, Eugène Canseliet entered the worldly and occultisthigh society of Paris. He was often at the de Lesseps home, at the symbolistgroup with André Breton, and among the little circle of Pierre Dujols, which hecame to know only slightly. He did, however, forge a strong friendship with PaulLe Cour, founder of the Atlantis movement, and he refined his alchemicaleducation, both operational and symbolic, at the feet of his master, Champagne.If Canseliet was of prime importance in the distribution of the work ofFulcanelli, he was similarly key to the tenacious spreading of the legend. Hewas often seen in libraries, where, using his beautiful handwriting, he honedhis skills in reproducing the calligraphy of ancient manuscripts.Canseliet also often accompanied Champagne to the home of his mother atArnouville-les-Gonesses, the avenue Viollet-le-Duc, where she was living at thetime.There they painted a number of canvases, including a portrait of Champagne onAugust 12, 1921, by Canseliet, who reproduced it in his book L’Alchimieexpliquée sur ses textes classiques (Alchemy as Explained by Its Classic Texts).Irène Hillel-Erlanger, a young woman who was a friend of Louis Aragon and thedaughter of a rich banker, was known to have an evening drink with theSurrealists at the café on the place Blanche in Paris. She also often went tothe home of the de Lessepses on the avenue Montaigne. She was born June 30,1878, and died in Paris on March 21, 1920. One of her ancestors, Abraham deCamondo, who died in 1873, had been the banker for the sultan of Constantinople.An occasional poet writing under the pseudonym Claude Lorrey, she left her markfor posterity with a book: In 1919, in Paris, Georges Crès published her Voyagesen Kaléidoscope, a little pamphlet whose significance depended neither on itsstyle nor on its storyline—which was rather ordinary—but rather on thealchemical underpinnings that shone through its text.⁶[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1816_0]Jean-Julien Champagne ascribed a great deal of importance to this document, inwhich, it seems, the Great Work is revealed. Doubtless he was no stranger toIrène. His influence with the de Lessepses in questions of alchemy wassignificant, and Irène was a familiar figure there. She was also a friend ofLouise Barbe, to whom she dedicated her little book: “To the great soul of L.B., piously I offer these pages. I. H. E.”Louise was the first wife of Dr. Voronoff, who, according to Robert Ambelain,Champagne masterfully hoodwinked, for our painter was a prankster and a bonvivant. He convinced Serge Voronofff [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1679_0] thathe possessed the Chrysopoeia, and to support his claim he showed Voronoff hisidentity card indicating that he was of a venerable age in relation to hisastonishingly young physical appearance. In fact, it was his father’s card,which he had pinched, for he was extremely crafty.In 1921, Jean-Julien Champagne was invited to work on the drawings for arefrigeration plan at the Château de Léré, in the Berry region. This housebelonged to Pierre de Lesseps, who was one of Ferdinand’s sons. The canalbuilder had bought this abandoned property with money from the sale of aproperty located near Paris and belonging to his mother-in-law. He had the landcultivated, built a model farm, and repaired the old chateau, which had belongedto Agnès Sorel.⁷ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1818_0]Champagne also taught drawing and, at his convenience, continued to use thelaboratory that was made available to him in order to go on with his alchemicalexperiments. But he stayed just a short time in the Berry region, and in 1922 hereturned to Paris, where he met Jules Boucher (J. B.), who became another of hisdisciples.At the time, Boucher was working at Rhône-Poulenc, and it was through a cousinof Champagne who was also employed there that the meeting between Champagne andBoucher took place.g [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1681_0]It was in this same year, 1922, during the month of September, that EugèneCanseliet, twenty-five years old, was present at the famous transmutation. Hecarried out the projectionh [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1683_0] himself,under Fulcanelli’s direction. The scene took place in the small apartment thathe occupied in the gas factory at Sarcelles in the presence of Jean-JulienChampagne and the chemist Gaston Sauvage. This transmutation was not the resultof the success of the Great Work, but rather a single specific instance. EugèneCanseliet admitted it himself to the dearly departed Savoret.i[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1685_0][../Images/img0064.jpg]Fig. 5.5. The second ex libris bookplate for Jules Boucher designed byJean-Julien Champagne.

The name ELIE, which is not unknown to alchemists, appears in thededication itself.j [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1687_0]Also in 1922, René Schwaller left Paris, severing all contacts with esotericgroups, notably with the group of alchemists who had gathered around PierreDujols and Julien Champagne. But he continued to send Champagne the monthlyallowance according to their agreement. In the book Feu du Soleil, by RobertAmadou, Eugène Canseliet reports that Fulcanelli left in 1922 and that he didnot see him again until 1952 (the date when Schwaller returned to Europe tosettle in the south of France at Plan-de-Grasse, after a stay of fifteen yearsin Egypt. He had left France in 1938). (See appendix C[../Text/app-c.html#anchor_1139_0] for a full chronology of René Schwaller deLubicz.)[../Images/img0006.jpg]Fig. 5.6. Photo with a dedication addressed to Aor and Isha, signed “Parsifal,November 1922”.In 1975, in the course of a conversation in Salt Lake City, Eugène Canselietconfided to Frater Albertus that Fulcanelli had made a second transmutation inthe fall of 1937. In his book The Alchemist of the Rocky Mountains, FraterAlbertus Spagyricus (alias Albert Riedel) relates the details of the experimentthat proceeded at the Château de Léré, which belonged to Pierre de Lesseps.According to him, Fulcanelli transmuted 225 grams of lead into gold and 100grams of silver into uranium in the presence of two physicists, a chemist, and ageologist. He would have mentioned that the catalytic “powder of projection”[one form of the philosopher’s stone] was derived from iron pyrites (FeS). Afterthis operation, Fulcanelli disappeared permanently.It was Kenneth Rayner Johnson, author of The Fulcanelli Phenomenon, who wrote toFrater Albertus asking for the source of his information. The response hereceived was that it came from an interview that Frater Albertus had with EugèneCanseliet in 1975.René Schwaller had become Schwaller de Lubicz by right of the honor to use theappellation “de Lubicz,” which was bestowed on him on January 10, 1919, by theLithuanian poet Oscar Vladislas de Lubicz Milosz (1877–1939; fig. 5.7[../Text/05.html#anchor_461_0]).The two men met in Paris in the Theosophical Society, which René Schwallerfrequented from 1913 to 1916. They were both interested in heraldry andparticularly in the possible relation between the coat of arms andreincarnation. When in each other’s company, they called each other “brothers inarms.”[../Images/img0048.jpg]Fig. 5.7. Letter from Oscar Vladislas de Lubicz Milosz authorizing RenéSchwaller to become Schwaller de Lubicz.It was René Schwaller who revealed to Milosz the meaning of the alchemical path.In a letter dated August 10, 1936, and addressed to Dom Bernard Geradon, Miloszalludes to a certain matter known to alchemists:Today, following the fifth cryptographic exploration of the Two Testaments, Ifind myself constrained to remain silent on certain points that I have not yetcommunicated to the Vicar of Our Lord: the first concerns a physical substancethat, so to say, has been put into my hands and that explains the longevity ofpersonages included in the genealogy from Adam to Seth up to Noah and anunpublished fragment of “Deux Messianismes politiques” [Two Political MessianicMovements].It is interesting to follow people of the Middle Ages on their pilgrimages toSaint-Jacques de Compostelle and other magical sites because behind thedeliberate and necessary obscurity of their allegorical relations are hiddentruths, the abrupt revealing of which would risk dangerously demoralizing thetwo opposing camps of the faithful and the materialists. In the most naturalway, these truths derive from the immediate knowledge of a certain substancethat has been described in almost identical terms by all the ancient chemists, asubstance, moreover, whose common and sacred names each of us utters every day,especially between the fall and spring equinoxes. . . . Let us add, however,before leaving this subject that the material in question resembles only verydistantly the mysterious “nostoc.”⁸ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1820_0]In 1917, Schwaller organized meetings for the exchange of opinions on differenttopics, which quickly evolved into purely metaphysical debates. After the end ofthe war (in 1919), this movement took the name Les Veilleurs (the Watchers) andwas supported by Gaston Revel’s journal, which changed its name from LeThéosophe to Le Veilleur. This name was inspired by the unpublished novel ofNicolas Beaudoin entitled Les Veilleurs de la Nuit (The Watchers of the Night).The editorial columns of the journal addressed various political and socialissues, and articles were signed “Aor,”k [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1689_0]the mystical name of René Schwaller, which he had received, according to some,by revelation, and according to others, during his time spent at theTheosophical Society. Whatever the case may be, the name means “light,” andSchwaller honored it all his life.This “fraternity of watchers” was based on an association called Le CentreApostolique, which had as a motto “Hierarchy-Fraternity-Liberty.” According toPierre Mariel, it was really a kind of occultist synarchy (i.e., based on jointrule) supporting a political-social messianism⁹[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1822_0] that was inspired in part by the ideas ofSaint-Yves d’Alveydre, notably of the corporate movement.¹⁰[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1824_0] This association was directed by a closedgroup otherwise called Frères de l’Ordre Mystique de la Résurrection (Brothersof the Mystical Order of the Resurrection). A journal called l’Affranchipublished the thought of the Centre Apostolique and dealt with social questions.Besides René Schwaller and Oscar V. Milosz, a number of people participatedactively in the Fraternité des Veilleurs:• Jeanne Germain, wife of Georges Lamy, the shipping magnate from Caen. She wasbetter known by the nomen mysticum of Isha, and in 1927, after being widowed,she became the wife of René Schwaller.¹¹ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1826_0]• Louis Allainguillaume (born in Caen, France, in 1878; died in Cardiff, Wales,in 1946), father of Isha’s two sons. He was a wealthy coal merchant. RenéSchwaller was employed in his business and organized the finances so that itsfortunes, already flourishing, soared even further. Louis Allainguillaumetherefore accorded Schwaller significant dividends, which allowed the scholar topursue his own research in complete tranquillity and to hand over to Jean-JulienChampagne a healthy sum each month.[../Images/img0049.jpg]Fig. 5.8. Louis Allainguillaume[../Images/img0018.jpg]Fig. 5.9. Letter from Jean-Julien Champagne addressed to Allainguillaume• Carlos Larronde, journalist and poet. He was a great friend of Milosz and thefounder of the Théâtre Idéaliste, which, for lack of financing, had a shorthistory (1914–17).• The chemist and astrologer Henri Coton-Alvart, who had as a disciple Dr.Emerit. Henri Coton was born in Paris on May 6, 1894, and died in the south ofFrance in January 1988 at the age of ninety-five. He quickly departed from thismovement in order to seclude himself in a beneficial solitude that allowed himto achieve success in his alchemical endeavors. According to a witness who hadknown him for a period of fifteen years, he obtained the philosopher’s stone.• Gaston Revel (died in 1939). He was the founder and editor in chief of thejournal Le Théosophe.• Le Charpentier• René Bruyez, who was the president of the group• Henri Postel du Mas, who stayed only a short timeThis initiatory order met in the house that belonged to Balzac on the rueRaynouard.The outer circle of the Fraternité des Veilleurs included numerous sympathizers.Among them were Henri de Regnier, Paul Fort, Fernand Léger, Georges Polti,Pierre Benoit, and Camille Flammarion.In 1921, Aor decided to suspend the existence of this movement as well as thejournal Le Veilleur. According to Jacques Buge, in his interesting book onMilosz, this action was the result of the departure of Milosz, Beaudoin, Bruyez,and Larronde, who were opposed to the spiritualistic practices that hadovertaken the metaphysical discussions. (See appendix D[../Text/app-d.html#anchor_1199_0] for the translation of a letter written bySchwaller to an unknown recipient that discusses Milosz, ancient Egypt, and LesVeilleurs.)During the war years, which he spent in Paris, Schwaller had drafted amanuscript on the subject of the Gothic cathedrals, dear to his heart, and onalchemical symbolism. He showed it to Champagne, who seemed interested andsuggested he submit his work to a publisher. Because he was well connected tothe publishing world, Champagne took on the task of finding one.Schwaller, being trusting, willingly loaned his manuscript to Champagne, andJean-Julien promised to return it quickly. He kept it, though, for several days,at the end of which time he returned it to Schwaller and advised him that thestudy revealed too many secrets and therefore could not be made available tojust anyone.At the time, Schwaller was preparing to leave for Engadine, Switzerland (theregion around Saint-Moritz), where, accompanied by Isha and a few faithfulfriends, he was going to build a scientific installation called Suhalia. It wasto be a kind of initiatory monastery equipped with an observatory, run by theastronomer Juvisy, and a highly advanced chemical laboratory. In addition, itwould house a foundry, a print shop, and a weaving workshop supporting thedevelopment of crafts. Last, there was to be an installation to support researchin physics, spectroscopy, micrography, and electricity.Work on plants helped the group at Suhalia to develop a homeopathicpharmacopoeia with very effective tinctures. For seven years, until 1927,Aor-Schwaller taught his philosophical doctrine to members of this community. Aninternal document he created for the group helped him in this teaching.During his stay in Switzerland, he regularly sent the agreed-upon allowance toChampagne for his research.In March 1925 Champagne moved to 59A rue Rochechouart, where he occupied a verymodestly furnished garret on the sixth floor. His immediate neighbor was hisdisciple Eugène Canseliet; the men were separated only by the washroom on theirfloor.Champagne was scrupulously careful to hide his relations with Schwaller from hisdisciples, notably from Dujols. He had, in fact, asked Schwaller not to meet himwhen any of his entourage was present. In order to conform to this strategy, allthe correspondence that they exchanged—even the monthly allowance sent toChampagne—was sent through Champagne’s brother-in-law, Gaston Devaux, who livedin the Somme département and acted as a forwarding address for Champagne.[../Images/img0001.jpg]Fig. 5.10.

Jean-Julien Champagne, age thirty-sevenIn Robert Amadou’s Feu du Soleil, Eugène Canseliet presents Gaston Devaux as“Fulcanelli’s secretary.” Devaux owned a ring identical to Canseliet’s ring witha baphomet. Long after the death of the painter Champagne, Canseliet continuedto travel to the Devaux home in the Somme.Gaston Devaux, who died in 1969, stated in 1952 that the Fulcanelli affair wascompletely fabricated; a hoax. Contrary to the opinion of his descendants,Devaux was keenly interested in alchemy.Jean-Julien Champagne had his peculiarities: He detested electricity, forexample, and preferred to use oil lamps. He dressed in an outmoded fashion,sported a handlebar mustache, and wore his hair long. He gave the impression ofnot belonging to his own century, always buried as he was in reading ancientauthors and having a fondness for the Middle Ages, which he did not consider adark period at all.He also had the custom of compartmentalizing his different relationships: Hewould meet with people belonging to different groups who never had any contactwith each other. He pretended to be horrified by occultism, but attendedmeetings such as those of the Grand Lunaire and even those of the Veilleurs. Allhis life he wove the veil that was intended to establish the Fulcanelli myth.The comical aspect of this business was that at the dawn of the twentiethcentury, a time so full of reason, no one doubted any of this. Everyone simplylatched on to these books that were full of the promise of longevity andomniscience and so on.Champagne devoted years to maintaining the fiction of Fulcanelli’s vocation asan adept. He had launched this fiction, and it was maintained by the whole grouparound him, all of whom must have promoted the myth: Gaston Sauvage, theChacornacs, Pierre Dujols, Canseliet, Jules Boucher. They formed the mysteriousFraternité d’Héliopolis (F.C.H.), whose double name had perhaps been borrowedfrom the Belgian lodge of the Memphis-Misraïm Rite, which, in 1839, calleditself Les Sages d’Héliopolis.Eugène Canseliet placed the birth of Fulcanelli in 1839, the year of theestablishment of this lodge. This was a gesture, a reference, a broad wink inthe direction of the eminently Freemasonic circle around Pierre Dujols andChampagne. Thomas,l [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1691_0] an associate of thebookstore owner and of the painter, had this affiliation, as did Oswald Wirth,Guénon, Chacornac, Marc Haven, Boucher, and Ferdinand de Lesseps, in whose honorthe Masonic feast was given in 1876. It is probable that the de Lesseps childrenalso belonged to the Freemasonry movement.In 1880, Pierre Dujols had been bedridden with rheumatoid arthritis for fouryears already. Because of a tenuous financial situation, his wife found herselfobliged to work in order to subsidize the needs of the family. No one cameforward to help them. Champagne brought them some money from time to time, buthe often spent it drinking on the way there.The Librairie du Merveilleux was sold. Dujols was succeeded by a FatherLequesne, a bookstore dealer, initiate, radiologist, and healer who usedspiritual magnetism. In the back of his shop was an oratory full of paintingsand statues.¹² [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1828_0]During his long years in bed, Pierre Dujols devoted his time to writing copiousnotes on alchemical symbolism. He shared with Champagne a veneration of BasileValentin and Flamel. They worked on the traditional path and were preoccupiedwith the notion of SEL.m [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1693_0]Champagne traveled and, in the course of his moving around, undertook toreproduce sculptures that seemed to him to have arisen from an alchemicalintent.¹³ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1830_0] This is how he came to design thecaissons of the Lallemant Hotel while he was staying near Bourges and living atthe chateau of the de Lesseps family at Léré.In the département of the Somme, he investigated the cathedral at Amiens andfairly regularly stayed with his sister, who lived in the département along withher husband, Gaston Devaux.He also traveled to Limoux, where, accompanied by his faithful disciple EugèneCanseliet, he visited the cathedral of Notre Dame in Marceille.Dujols and Champagne set to work on Schwaller’s notes on the cathedral of NotreDame in Paris and in particular on its relation to hermetic science. Dujolsbrought to this endeavor his remarkable learning and Champagne contributed histalent as a designer and engineer.n [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1695_0]They restructured the work, enlarged it, layering it with their prodigiousknowledge in the field, and Champagne confided the whole content to EugèneCanseliet in order to support the purported existence of the mysterious adept.This is how it came about that, on June 15, 1926, Le Mystère des Cathédrales waspublished, by Jean Schémit in Paris, under the pseudonym Fulcanelli, and to theconsiderable amazement of Schwaller, who was at the time at Suhalia inSwitzerland.He recognized his work—the work that he had loaned to Champagne in the years1920–22. Later he said to André VandenBroeck, “I’ve been taken by Fulcanelli, myideas have been taken; well, at least now it’s written down.”¹⁴[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1832_0] He always called Champagne Fulcanelli.As for Pierre Dujols, it is not clear that he was ever informed of theprovenance of the notes that Champagne presented to him. He was a very pious manand apparently a man of great integrity.The spiritual quest that Schwaller was pursuing was such that he did not takeChampagne to task for his thieving, and he even continued to send him theagreed-upon allowance while Jean-Julien Champagne, in his laboratory,concentrated on the resolution of the problem of colors in the stained-glasswindows at Chartres. But he was completely unsuccessful.On April 19 of the same year, 1926, Pierre Dujols died in Paris (see fig. 5.15[../Text/05.html#anchor_543_0]). His wife withdrew to live with her children,separating herself completely from Jean-Julien Champagne, to whom, however, shewas still very connected. Henceforth, she received visits only from Faugeron,the disciple of her husband in alchemy.[../Images/img0026.jpg]Fig. 5.15. Pierre Dujols’s obituary notice, which appeared in the 1927. Voiled’Isis. See appendix E [../Text/app-e.html#anchor_1217_0] for a translation ofthis obituary.Earlier, she had given him all Dujols’s alchemical files and the notes aboutmonuments having a hermetic character. Pierre Dujols had composed many longpages on this topic, and Eugène Canseliet assembled them and submitted them toChampagne, who, in the end, presented the whole document to the publisherSchémit. Thus, in 1930, the first edition of Les Demeures Philosophales wasoffered to the public.The family members of Pierre Dujols de Valois were astonished by the completebreak of their forebear from this milieu and, above all, from Champagne.We might assume that the alchemist had perhaps revealed the true origin of LeMystère des Cathédrales, a manuscript stolen from Schwaller and augmented byPierre Dujols. As it turned out, this book was considered by Champagne to beimperfect.In 1929, Champagne traveled to the south of France, having been invited there bySchwaller, who was living at Lou-Mas-de-Coucagno in Plan-de-Grasse. Schwaller’sinvitation was addressed to a certain Mr. Hubert.It was in regard to this name that a debate arose between Eugène Canseliet andRobert Ambelain, with Ambelain claiming that Champagne had called himself Hubertand that Hubert was the first name of Champagne’s father and Canselietdisagreeing. This bitter exchange was related to the interpretation by RobertAmbelain of the closing chord of Le Mystère des Cathédrales, for we find on thelast page of that book the inscription UBER CAMPA AGNA, or, phonetically, HubertChampagne, which reveals that Robert Ambelain was right: Champagne did indeedhave the first name Hubert, which his death certificate in fact records (fig.5.16).If we remember, he had pinched the identity card of his father, whose first namewas also Hubert, taking it as his own in order to pass for an age that hisappearance belied. In this way Robert Ambelain demonstrated that Fulcanelli wasChampagne and that Champagne had signed his book in a cabalistic manner.[../Images/img0015.jpg]Fig. 5.16. Jean-Julien Champagne’s death certificateDuring his stay at the home of the Schwaller de Lubicz family in Plan-de-Grasse(fig. 5.17), Champagne exchanged ideas with Aor while strolling on the broadavenue that led to the house. In memory of this time, it came to be called theAllée des philosophes, “Philosophers’ Walk” (see fig. 5.18[../Text/05.html#anchor_567_0]).The men conversed about the theory and practice of the alchemical Great Work andChampagne carried out experiments in the highly advanced laboratory that RenéSchwaller had installed in his house.Steadily, Schwaller established the doctrine that was drawn from the study ofthe manuscript on colors. The two were close to success.Lucie Lamy, the daughter-in-law of René Schwaller, did not think much of thealchemist. Later she said as much, explaining that he behaved in an obnoxiousmanner and that he was very taken by drink. In fact, he did not correspond atall to her idea of a philosopher.[../Images/img0059.jpg]Fig. 5.17.

L’Allée des Philosophes (the Philosophers’ Walk), called this bySchwaller de Lubicz in memory of the visit of J.-J. ChampagneIt is during this period that René Schwaller drew a portrait of hiscollaborator: a drawing in red ink in which Champagne appears with long hair, ashe liked to wear it. The work is dated 1930 and carries on the back theannotation “Fulcanelli” (see fig. 5.19 [../Text/05.html#anchor_578_0]).The architect who was in charge of the renovation of the house that was theproperty of René Schwaller and which was bought back from him by Jean Lamy inmonthly payments (Lucy Lamy bought a property near Thoronet) was often invited,along with his wife, to dine and spend the evening at the Schwaller home. Heshares some of his reminiscences:During the meals, in the dining room where there hung a chandelier constructedwith the glass of Chartres (blues and reds), Aor loved to teach.His daughter-in-law, Lucie, did not have the right to interrupt, nor, by theway, the right to leave the house. She lived as a recluse. Her long stay inEgypt had scorched her face and prematurely aged her. She was just there,self-effacing, although she had a very great talent for drawing and would havebeen justified in putting herself forward more.Isha was just the opposite. She was very distinguished, a great lady, alwayswell dressed. Aor regarded her highly, calling her “my great friend.” Thedecoration of her bedroom was theatrical, with a canopy bed and also anarmchair, specially designed, she said, to enable her to recharge.[../Images/img0067.jpg]Fig. 5.19. Drawing of Jean-Julien Champagne, in red ink, by René Schwaller deLubicz, February 1930[../Images/img0012.jpg]Fig. 5.20. René Schwaller de LubiczAor was an extremely gifted and intelligent being. He believed in everythingmysterious. His work in Egypt had made him known throughout the world. Thearchitect recalls:. . . [I]n Pennsylvania, when Aor was at the university, the community ofofficial Egyptologists made fun of him because his method was linked to thepseudoscience of the Egyptians. His son-in-law, Jean Lamy, was a medical doctorwho was a sensitive diagnostician. He prescribed homeopathic medicines usingtinctures that had been developed at Suhalia and used an apparatus invented byRené Schwaller: the phonophoresis.¹⁵ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1834_0]His office was on the third floor of the house. He occupied three rooms thatstank of cigarettes from his excessive smoking. In fact he died from too muchsmoking.In the countryside, he was much loved for his exactitude and for hisunselfishness. Often he would accept no money from those in need. It was he whoin the latter years supported the whole household. As a result, he was saddenedby the fact that he had been unable to assemble the few million centimesrequired to publish the books of his father-in-law.After the death of his parents, he married a young woman who gave birth to ason, Jean-Christophe.A disciple of Isha who lived for a few years near this exceptional family alsooffers insights into Schwaller: According to her, Aor was a man of advancedspiritual quality who showed great kindness to everyone and whose telepathicabilities could not be doubted. Although he attached no importance to it, for hewas very humble, he had the ability to anticipate everyone’s questions and torespond to them in a subtle way.As for his alchemical work, it seemed not to be Aor’s principal activity. He wasfirst and foremost an “inspired” Egyptologist whose work, still not understoodby official academia, nevertheless shows that he had a total understanding ofthe sacred science of the Egyptians.His wife Isha had had a very trying life and had overcome all her difficulties.It was the result of her revelations on two occasions that allowed him todiscover the sacred alphabet of the Egyptians. Her existence, as well as that ofAor, was devoted to the transmission of this knowledge.We should recall, however, that Isha did not know René Schwaller when he wasvery close to Jean-Julien Champagne.After his time in the south of France, Champagne returned for a few months toParis, then, in 1930, was called back to Plan-de-Grasse. His suitcase stillcarried the tags for his trips south.That same year, 1930, René Schwaller and Jean-Julien Champagne were positionedto solve the problem whose solution they had been pursuing for nineteen years:that of the fabrication of the blues and reds of the stained-glass windows of,for instance, Chartres Cathedral—certainly no small feat.Aor understood the theory. According to Mr. VandenBroeck, he imposed a severeprotocol, based on draconian conditions, that was set to result in success forthe operation. Champagne plunged into the work and, following Schwaller’sdirectives combined with his own extraordinary mastery, which everyonerecognized, he began the experiment.o [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1697_0] Itwas a success, as René Schwaller was to confirm later to Mr. VandenBroeck:He described for me the separation of sulfur carried out on copper. A coloredluminosity spread over the cinders of the material. The tinting mass representedthe essential dyeing within the colored glass.¹⁶[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1836_0]The Chartres glass is dyed in its mass by the volatile spirit of metals.The famous letter published by Eugène Canseliet in the preface to the secondedition of Le Mystère des Cathèdrales (1957) and attributed to Fulcanelliactually outlines this operation and speaks of its success.Dear Old Friend:This time you have truly received God’s Gift; it is a great grace, and for thefirst time I understand how rare this favor is. I consider in fact that withinits unfathomable depths of simplicity, the Arcanum cannot be found by the forceof reason alone, no matter how subtle or trained [this reason] might be. At lastyou have the Treasure of Treasures, and let us give thanks to the Divine Lightthat has made you a participant in it. You have, by the way, justly deserved itthrough your unshakable trust in Truth, your constancy of effort, yourperseverance in sacrifice, and also, let us not forget . . . through your goodworks.When my wife told me this good news, I was dumbfounded by joyful surprise and Iwas beside myself with happiness, so much so that I said to myself: Let’s hopethat this hour of intoxication is not paid for by some dreadful tomorrow. Butalthough I was informed only in summary fashion of the event, I believe I haveunderstood, and this reassures me in the certainty that the fire does not dieuntil the Work is done and until the entire tinting mass impregnates the glass,which, from one decantation to the next, remains absolutely saturated andbecomes as luminous as the sun. . . .It was also in the year 1930, on September 15, that the second book byFulcanelli-Champagne was offered to the public: Les Demeures Philosophales et leSymbolisme Hermétique dans Ses Rapports avec l’Art Sacré et l’Ésotérisme duGrand-Oeuvre (The Dwellings of the Philosophers and Hermetic Symbolism in TheirRelationship to the Sacred Art and the Esotericism of the Great Work),¹⁷[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1838_0] which was the work of both Champagne andPierre Dujols before his death. Eugène Canseliet had the role of simplyassembling the notes. Later, after the death of his master Champagne, Canselietventured to expand the republished editions.Once again, according to Mr. VandenBroeck, after this conclusive experiment,Champagne changed completely. He returned to Paris in a state of greatexcitement, completely set on continuing along this path and repeating thisoperation.As Champagne and Schwaller had agreed in their earlier contract, the monthlyallowance was to end at this point and all trace of an association betweenSchwaller and Champagne was to be effaced. This experiment had put the finishingtouches on their break from one another.For a year, Champagne kept his word and made no allusion to their laboratorywork. In a letterp [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1699_0] addressed to RenéSchwaller a year after the death of the painter, Eugène Canseliet conveys hisdisappointment in having been kept at a distance: “Might it not be that Mr.Champagne has once again shown, with respect to this material aspect of yourwork, a memory lapse that is as surprising as it is incomprehensible . . . ?”In this period of separation, Julien Champagne was gravely ill: He limped, drankabsinthe, and inhaled galbanum to induce visions. He took tinctures to addresshis illnesses, but it was too late.At this point, according to Mr. VandenBroeck, Champagne wanted to reveal all tohis disciples. In addition, in 1931 he asked René Schwaller by letter to come toParis for a very important declaration he had to communicate to him.When they met in a little suburban restaurant, Champagne announced his intentionto reveal everything about their work, but Schwaller reminded him of their pactand, in exchange for his silence, offered to continue to help him financially.[../Images/img0057.jpg]Fig. 5.21.

Note the similarity of thehandwriting of these two dedications.[../Images/img0013.jpg]Fig. 5.23. Jean-Julien Champagne as an old manIn August of 1932, a very weak Champagne sent another letter to Schwaller,specifying a date that had been fixed for a meeting with his disciples.Still according to Mr. VandenBroeck, it was a few days before this fateful datethat René Schwaller returned to Paris, climbed up straightaway to thealchemist’s garret at 59A rue Rochechouart, and found him in bed. Champagne’sskin was black: Gangrene had spread through his leg.Champagne must have considered the situation and, stung by remorse, pointedSchwaller toward a pile of papers, asking him to take with him the manuscriptthat was to be found there—the manuscript that had begun their longcollaboration.This was their last meeting, for the next day, August 26, 1932, at 6:40 A.M.,Jean-Julien Champagne died at the age of fifty-five from a blocked artery in hisleft leg. He had not succeeded in producing the philosopher’s stone, the searchof his lifetime.His sister, Mrs. Gaston Devaux, came to his room, took away some papers, and, toher amazement, discovered enough money to contradict the rumor that his end hadtaken place in penury. She had believed her brother was penniless and thus oftengave him money.Three days after Marcel Braun performed the registration of death (see fig. 5.24[../Text/05.html#anchor_639_0]), Jean-Julien Champagne, this uncommon individualbelonging to another century, was taken to his final resting place, the cemeteryof Arnouville-les-Gonesse (see fig. 5.25 [../Text/05.html#anchor_643_0]).His brother-in-law, Gaston Devaux, whom Eugène Canseliet claimed wasFulcanelli’s secretary, took care of the funeral and the plot.q[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1701_0]On the grave there appears this epitaph: APOSTOLUS HERMETICAE SCIENTIAE.

ThusChampagne’s disciple Eugène Canseliet, who was later called “the Master ofSavignies,” undertook to establish the alchemical resurgence of the twentiethcentury. He had extensive experience in the laboratory, but undoubtedly spent agreat deal of time shoring up the myth of Fulcanelli’s vocation as an adept.It seems that despite the numerous contradictions found in Eugène Canseliet’swritings about the details of his life in association with Fulcanelli and ofFulcanelli’s identity, Canseliet was the object of manipulations of which he wastoo young to be aware. Some people, however, do not accept this theory.In addition, it seems that Eugène Canseliet sincerely believed that behindJean-Julien Champagne there was another man, the master, the initiator.The facts and the letter Canseliet wrote to René Schwaller after Champagne’sdeath (see fig. 6.1 [../Text/06.html#anchor_677_0]) indicate that he was welland truly the disciple of Champagne and that he held him in great esteem, to thepoint of working with him for seven years, from 1925 to 1932.[../Images/img0036.jpg]Fig. 6.1. Letter from Eugène Canseliet to René Schwaller de Lubicz. The letteris translated in appendix F [../Text/app-f.html#anchor_1236_0].[../Images/img0023.jpg]Jean-Julien Champagne had always kept secret his meetings with René Schwaller.He had revealed nothing of his long collaboration with Schwaller or of theirexperiments in the laboratory. Eugène Canseliet knew simply that in the last fewyears of Champagne’s life, ties between the two men had become closer. We couldsay that he suspected the importance of their collaboration. As he wrote toSchwaller, “You demonstrate profound knowledge at the juncture of the primitiveandrogynous state, as well as highly philosophical concerns—in fact the same asthose that gripped Mr. Champagne upon his return from Plan-de-Grasse and whichseemed to overturn his former notions …”Eugène Canseliet was certainly not party to the work carried out by PierreDujols and Julien Champagne on the notes that were to give birth to Le Mystèresdes Cathédrales any more than he was aware of the association of Dujols andChampagne in the preparation of the future Demeures Philosophales.a[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1705_0] He was also unaware of the laboratorywork on the blues and reds of Chartres’s stained glass. Gaston Devaux, J.-J.Champagne’s brother-in-law, who acted as a forwarding address for Champagne,further deepened the mystery. After the death of the alchemist in 1932, EugèneCanseliet continued to maintain connections with the Devaux family, visitingthem in the département of the Somme, and subsequently invited the family to hishome.This legendary history detracts neither from the interest the protagonists havefor the science of the philosophers nor from their contribution to theunderstanding of the texts of the ancients. We are simply reminded of thearticle of Giovanni Sciuto that appeared in the journal L’Autre Monde, specialissue on alchemy (1987), which attempts to prove that Nicolas Flamel was not anadept and that “having entered into legend, he is in the process of gettinghimself out of it.” Indeed, according to the historian of science RobertHalleux, from Belgium, a specialist in the history of alchemy, Nicolas Flamelcertainly existed and was wealthy enough to perform charitable works, but hispersonality as an adept was established a century later in the 1700sb[../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1708_0] in order to give a new appeal to thisscience, which was in decline. In this regard it was an anonymous alchemicalauthor who was to have created the legend.As for the book called Livre des lavures, attributed to Flamel, its style is notthat of the fourteenth century but rather that of the time of the Renaissance.History repeats itself.Versions of the MythWe are now going to broach a few points in the assertions of Eugène Canselietthat have seemed suspicious and which have to do with the extraordinary story ofthe survival of Fulcanelli as an adept in a “parallel” world, throughrecountings that took place over many years.In 1953, in his book L’Occultisme à Paris, Pierre Geyraud (alias Abbé Guyades,vicar of Saint-Séverin) narrates that in 1936, during a banquet attended by aglittering array of society figures on the occasion of the feast of the sun andthe festival of lights of St. John, Eugène Canseliet replied to a question ofMr. Rosny concerning the identity of Fulcanelli:… Fulcanelli is the pseudonym of [an] individual about whom, out of respect forthe hermetic rule of silence, I cannot speak in any other way. This Fulcanelliis still alive. He is mandated by the White Brotherhood to assist in theevolution of humanity. This is a true Rosy-Cross. He is sometimes in Brazil,sometimes in Argentina, wandering through the world in the manner of theRosy-Cross of olden times. Right now he is in the south of France. He is amaster with amazing powers.”¹ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1844_0]This story highlights the belief of Canseliet in the alchemical mythology: themandated adept, longevity, powers, and so on.In 1972, in the Charivari devoted to alchemy, there appears the “Seville Story”from the pen of François Jacquemart:In 1952, a female acquaintance of Eugène Canseliet came to Canseliet’s home andasked him to follow her without specifying the destination, but letting him knowthat it was a matter of some importance. The trip came to an end not far fromSeville, at a rambling estate where a terrace and a double set of stairs led toa stately home. Upon his arrival, Fulcanelli (remember that he was born in 1840)was there and asked Canseliet: “Do you recognize me?” Eugène Canseliet assented.The two men engaged in a brief exchange. For the remainder of the stay, they metonly for short moments. Eugène Canseliet was working in what he heard called“the small laboratory.” Early one morning, in one of the walkways of the parkafter one of the long nights of labors in which he had been compelled to engage,he saw a strange scene: a young queen wearing the Golden Fleece was movingforward, followed by a duenna. Seeing him, she nodded. On another occasion, hecame upon two children, a little boy and a little girl, playing with two rabbitsand a pony. From their clothing and their appearance they seemed to have steppedout of a Velázquez painting. On these two occasions, Eugène Canseliet had theintuition of a humanity that was not living on the same plane as ours, a societybeyond time …In his 1969 book, Invitation au château de l’étrange—témoignages inédits(Invitation to the Chateau of the Strange—Unpublished Accounts), ClaudeSeignolle recounts a story that took place in 1966 and in which the centralfigure is Eugène Canseliet. There is no mention of Fulcanelli in this account,nor of Seville, but only of a strange family who fascinated Canseliet for theiralchemical knowledge and the impression they gave of living as though “stuck inthe seventeenth century.”² [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1846_0][../Images/img0002.jpg]Fig. 6.2.

[He is] a simple man, modest and, it goeswithout saying, sincere. His knowledge is vast and authentic. Of course, I willremain silent as to his name, famous and respected as he is in esoteric circles,but I bow in advance before his reproach, in case these lines should fall beforehis eyes.Every day he receives a ministerial volume of post and engages in fascinatingexchanges of correspondence, among them with a wealthy Spanish family who aresaid to be withdrawn from time and who write in a marvelously textured antiqueFrench—a joy for my friend, who readily uses the imperfect subjunctive, evenwith his grocer.Two or three years ago, this Spanish family sent him a plane ticket to Madrid,inviting him to spend a few days with them so they would come to know himbetter, while, for their part, they would endeavor to learn more from him abouthis specialty—which seemed impossible! The adventure was tempting. My friend,although not very inclined to accept such an invitation, felt that he would makeinteresting discoveries, for the tone and context of the letters he had receivedover the years were remarkable as much for their subtle observations as for theriches they contained.He took the plane. At the Madrid airport an old Spanish woman was waiting forhim with a chauffeur, who was more like a coachman than an automobile driver,decked out in antique style and looking as though he might well be found in thecorner of a Goya painting. No one else was there to greet him, and the driverwas very tight-lipped. Allowing himself to be driven away, my friend settledinto a customary smiling contemplation. They traversed a long road to arrive,near dusk, at the wrought-iron gate of a park enclosed by a high wall. But theyhad not yet arrived at the destination: A winding, rocky road led them in onedirection and then another, as if it were about to lose itself. . . . Finallythey stopped at a broad terrace. The driver stopped the motor, got out, and,taking my friend’s suitcase, invited him to follow. A walkway led them away.They walked for a long time and came to a large old dwelling, low-set butmajestic.In coming into the house, my friend noticed that there was no electricity. Notone lightbulb. Here only candles were used for lighting. Was this done in hishonor, to recall the Spain of yesteryear, or was it an everyday occurrence? Hishosts were there, wearing traditional vestments, which, far from findinggrotesque, he enjoyed immensely. “Finally,” he thought, “here are people whoknow how to remove themselves from this century where the fashions are sochangeable and sometimes so daring. Here, all the women are in long dresses,velvet or brocade, and the men in a kind of doublet with stockings and buckledshoes.”Everyone crowded around the master come from afar and they feted him royally (Iam putting myself for a moment in the place of this delightful man when he hearsa smooth old French spoken by the old Castilian).The welcoming meal had the same yesteryear flavor—the dishes as well as theservice. As for the conversation, it was appropriately astounding. My friendquickly noticed, as he had in their letters, that his hosts, although they mighthave been hesitant about present-day alchemy, had, on the contrary, veryprofound knowledge of ancient alchemy, which they spoke of naturally, as if itwas something that they made use of every day. This was true to such an extentthat my friend—he who knows all knowledge—learned, with amazement, of theexistence of unknown books and the wording of forgotten formulas, finding inthese people the lost strength of ancient alchemy.Who then were these individuals living in 1966 but having not ventured past thelife of the seventeenth century? He was very careful not to ask them. Besides,had he not seen others like this in his life as a magician?His sojourn there lasted a week, and not only did he learn a great deal, but heunderwent a beneficial rest cure. He saw planes pass byoverhead but did not hear the slightest hum, and on the nearby road, cars cameand went in silence as if the present moment was nothing more than a vision ofthe mind. Around him there were no other sounds except those of an affable andpeaceful family who each day seemed tirelessly to resume their patient gesturesand, devoid of any agitation, to speak of a life that had no end.In 1978, Robert Amadou’s Feu du Soleil was published. In it there is thisconversation with Eugène Canseliet:It was near Seville. I was walking like a king. Everything I needed was there,but I always came back to my lodging, and I left again early in the morning. Inthe garden there were apples and lemons. A freshwater stream flowed nearby. Itwas magnificent!Now I did not expect to meet Fulcanelli, with my suspenders tumbling down mytrousers.When he saw me, he addressed me familiarly, as he was accustomed to do: “So, doyou recognize me?”And on the previous page: “He is no longer there; he is on the earth, but it isa terrestrial paradise. What is he doing now? I saw nothing. I saw him when Iarrived, when he greeted me wearing a suit.”Finally: “And in the manor where I saw Fulcanelli, there were contemporaries ofPhilip II. Right away, I understood nothing. It was not forbidden to look outthe windows, and I saw a very beautiful staircase with a number of landings, andchildren playing. . . . There were also many young women who looked as if theyhad stepped out of a Velázquez painting, with the collar of the Golden Fleece.”³[../Text/notes.html#anchor_1848_0]In 1979, in the meeting between Jacques Pradel and Eugène Canseliet onFrance-Inter, the same story turns up again, but the apparent age of Fulcanelliis specified: from his looks, about fifty, although he should have been 113.“That year, a car stopped in front of the house of Eugène Canseliet nearBeauvais. In this car, there was an emissary from Fulcanelli. Someone showedEugène Canseliet papers that proved Fulcanelli was alive. Eugène Canseliet wasgoing to find himself in Spain, in a mysterious chateau near Seville, he thinks.. . . There are people on the earth who are living on a different plane thanours, that is certain.”Finally, in The Fulcanelli Phenomenon, by Kenneth Rayner Johnson, Canselietrecounts that one morning, in his bedroom of the little tower that he wasoccupying, he moved near to the window and saw a group of three women who seemedto be dressed in the style of the sixteenth century. He was about to go back tohis room when one of the women turned toward him and began to laugh. He wasstunned, for the face of the “woman” who was laughing as she looked at him wasthat of Fulcanelli.⁴ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1850_0]In this book, the voyage to Spain is dated 1954, in contrast to what EugèneCanseliet states in Feu du Soleil, which gives the date as 1952.Also according to Rayner Johnson, someone had been able to see in EugèneCanseliet’s passport an entry visa to Spanish territory for the year 1954.After hearing these accounts, we can say that it is possible that EugèneCanseliet is relating a paranormal experience. This may remind the reader of thestory of the “Fantômes de Trianon,”⁵ [../Text/notes.html#anchor_1852_0] in whichtwo Englishwomen visited Versailles at the beginning of the twentieth centuryand found themselves plunged into the middle of the eighteenth century. They metcourtesans who spoke to them and were able even to see Marie-Antoinette.These two, Miss Moberly and Miss Jourdain, were apparently trustworthy, andtheir story never varied. It is known that there is an emotional chargeunderlying a paranormal experience and that retelling such an experience can bestabilizing.The 1957 edition of Le Mystère des Cathédrales was expanded to include a chapterattributed to Fulcanelli that has led to much commentary: “The Cyclic Cross ofHendaye.”Mr. Canseliet makes no mention of the article that appeared in 1936 inConsolation, the journal directed by Maryse Choisy (see figs. 6.3[../Text/06.html#anchor_737_0], 6.4 [../Text/06.html#anchor_743_0], 6.5[../Text/06.html#anchor_747_0]) and signed Jules Boucher (J. B.). In thisarticle we find virtually all theories about the famous inscription OCRUXAVESPESUNIC A.[../Images/img0040.jpg]Fig. 6.3.

One of the sides of the base of the cyclic cross at Hendaye.Photograph by José Fuentes[../Images/img0008.jpg]Fig. 6.5. The cyclic cross at HendayeRobert Ambelain entrusted us with the rather shocking unfolding of thisdiscovery. As it happened, on vacation with his lady friend in Hendaye, thepainter Lemoine took a photograph of the monument, seeing in it a “teaching.” Hesubmitted a print of it to Maryse Choisy, who, on the lookout for articles forher weekly, asked Jules Boucher to write something about this “esoteric” cross.Boucher told Robert Ambelain that he was not much interested in the subject butdidn’t know how to get out of doing it. He did his best and the article appearedin 1936.As for the sundial of Holyrood (fig. 6.6 [../Text/06.html#anchor_758_0]), whichwas the subject of a chapter in Les Demeures Philosophales, some are quick tosee it as proof that Fulcanelli belonged to an aristocratic milieu. Today it isnot possible to gain access to this monument, which is found in the privategardens of the royal family of England.It seems clear that René Schwaller, who was a member of the TheosophicalSociety, communicated a drawing or a photograph like this to Jean-JulienChampagne with the assistance of the theosophist Lady Caithness.In her mansion on the avenue Wagram, Lady Caithness gathered the whole esotericmilieu of her time. She had been behind the founding of the Gnostic Church andwas the representative in France of the Theosophical Society. Her husband wasLord James Barogill, the fourteenth count of Caithness, who was head of theSinclair clan. He was buried in the former royal chapel of Mary Stuart atHolyrood.Lady Caithness was very much a part of fashionable English society and wasobsessively devoted to Mary Stuart, believing herself to be Mary’sreincarnation, for in the abbey of Holyrood she had had an experience with thedead queen.In volume 2 of Les Demeures Philosophales, the chapter “Paradoxe du progrèsillimité des sciences” (Paradox of the Unlimited Progress of Science, missingfrom the first edition) is about the incineration of the planet. To support hisideas about this, the author mentions a church at Melle, in the département ofDeux-Sèvres, the porch of which is ornamented with an equestrian statue referredto as the Horseman of the Apocalypse.c [../Text/footnotes.html#anchor_1710_0][../Images/img0060.jpg]Fig. 6.6. The Holyrood sundialThose who are curious and want to admire this sculpture can go to this charmingtown, where they would first of all find that the horseman is not in theentrance of the church of Saint-Pierre but instead in the church ofSaint-Hilaire.Next they would notice that this handsome figure is over the side door of thechurch’s north side and not its south side, as the author contends. Yet the textbases the point of its hypothesis concerning the mysterious horseman on justthis southerly orientation: “It is a serious and noble statue that, in thegallery of a semicircular arch of the church of Saint-Pierre, rears up over thesouthern entrance, always subjected to the radiance of the sun due to thisorientation.”We shall finish with the book by Atorène, Le Laboratoire alchimique, in whichthere is mention of the rue Dieudé in Marseilles, where Fulcanelli is supposedto have stayed in 1915. Figure 6.7 (pages 119–120) shows the list of those wholived on the rue Dieudé. As it turns out, the archivist Isabelle Bonnot lookedfor evidence of a possible trip of Eugène Canseliet to the Fine Arts Museum ofMarseilles and found nothing.[../Images/img0063.jpg]Fig. 6.7.

Please allow me to recall thishonor in order to ask you to put me in touch with Martinists who might be livingin Constantine or who might be here on a trip and, in spite of the distance fromTunis, with the general representative and the Lodge of Tunis.I see in the proceedings that you have published (Initiation, March 1897) thatthe general representative in Egypt succeeded in concluding an agreement withthe Baha’is of Persia. By means of the hieroglyphics, I understand this order tobe an Ionian faction of Islam.I believe it would be easier and even more advantageous to put the MartinistOrder in contact with the Tidjanya and with the Quadrya.The administration of indigenous affairs in Algeria considers the Tidjanya asdevoted friends of the French influence. They seem to have a special venerationfor Sidi Aïssa (Jesus) and, like the Albanian Baktachi, can be favorable toChristians. Henri Duveyrier, the explorer of the Algerian Sahara, was a khouan[adherent] of their order. Recently as well Mr. de Brazza made the trip fromLaghouat to take from there the ward (the rose). Their grand master resides atTlemcen, near Touggourt, and our division chief never makes the trip withoutgoing to see him. I have good reason to believe that the Quadrya would also bevery accessible. They are a much more powerful order, much more widespread thanthe Tidjanya, who are mostly Algerian (Algerian provinces, from Constantine andTunisia). The Quadrya have their center at Baghdad near the tomb of theirpatron, Sidi ’Abd al-Qadir Jilani, perhaps the greatest saint of Islam andcertainly the best known (almost all the poor beg alms in his name). The emir’Abd al-Qadir belongs to them. I believe them to be Dorian, however. Incontrast, the brotherhoods originating from Morocco all seem to me to be Ionianand hostile.However it may be, I remain at your disposal for any initiative that might beuseful to the order, and I beg you to count on my complete support.Constantine, May 30, 1897Commander Levet, Head of Engineering at ConstantineThe Moslem brotherhoods have very curious and very interesting prophecies. Oneof them from the end of the eighteenth century predicted very clearly theconquest of Algeria by the French. I will communicate that to Saturninus."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX CCHRONOLOGY OF RENÉ SCHWALLER DE LUBICZDecember 30, 1887He is born at Asnières in the département of Seine-et-Oise. He spends hischildhood and his adolescence in Strasbourg, where his father is apharmacist-chemist. His father, originally from Switzerland, studied pharmacy inGermany.1910He arrives in Paris and becomes the student of Matisse. It is here that he meetsa very beautiful young woman whom he marries and with whom he has a son. Shelooks after his painter’s studio for him. He comes in contact with the occultmilieu of Paris and in particular with the hermetic circle developing aroundJean-Julien Champagne. A meeting with Champagne turns into a twenty-yearcollaboration.1914–18He is mobilized and assigned to an army laboratory, where he is responsible forcarrying out chemical analyses on the feeding of troops. He is alreadyinterested in theories about the constitution of matter.1919The Lithuanian poet Oscar Vladislas de Lubicz Milosz confers on him the right tobear the coat of arms of Lubicz.1920He creates the association Les Veilleurs and a journal, Le Veilleur.1922He departs for Suhalia in Switzerland, where, with the help of a few faithfulfriends, he founds a scientific research station.1927He marries Jeanne Germain, born in 1885 and the widow of Georges Lamy, betterknown by the mystic name Isha, who participates in all his researches.

Everything relating to my great brotherMilosz and his new orientation since 1917 concerns me and, when simple peopleare unaware of the causes, they make them up, and rarely are these imaginingsfavorable—for people are more moved by the bad than by the good. Moreover,people love window dressing in order, shall we say, to make the stupiditiespleasanter rather than seeking the bare and simple truth.As for your questions on esotericism in general, La Colombe will soon release anumber on this issue. It will be a pleasure to send you a copy.Nowadays the atomic age has sprouted so-called alchemists in every direction.Alchemy is often spoken of without realizing that it is not a procedure formaking gold, but rather is the echo of a very noble, priestly science bequeathedfrom antiquity, a science arising from Al-Kemit (pharaonic Egypt) and recordedeverywhere, especially on the scrolls of Thot, whom the Greeks calledHermes—which, by the way, is a pharaonic word meaning “birth of Her,” or Kor,the Horus of the Romans. Another publication that will be issued, probably inthe spring, will attempt to set this straight. I’ll let you know about itsrelease.Certainly it was I who revealed to Milosz the deepest meaning that we mustattribute to hermetic science. This radically changed his way of seeing theworld, and God knows that at the time I had still much, definitely much, tolearn. But the poet never feared getting carried away and he published ArsMagna, which I was never happy with. But O. W. de L.-M. was like a fiery horse,impossible to hold back once he had awakened his captivating (?) Olympian dream.If I may be permitted a piece of advice, do not let yourself be taken in bymodern writings claiming to be alchemical; they can only lead you astray. Thisis a very serious problem.As for Les Veilleurs, I am the chief culprit. In the beginning, in 1917, I hadorganized meetings the aim of which was solely to provide everyone anopportunity, in a small group, to develop a theme on any subject whatever. Rightaway the mystical took over and led us to meet only for mystical purposes—to theexclusion of any religious or political critique. When, at the end of the war,my old friend Gaston Revel, founder and editor in chief of the magazine LeThéosophe, offered to put this magazine at the service of our group, I proposedcalling it Le Veilleur. It was in this way that this movement was born—amovement about which people have spoken a great deal but have understoodnothing—for one of our aims was to help demobilized craftsmen to find theopportunity to readjust to a new life guided by a sense that was mystic ratherthan one that was purely economic.Now all this had no connection whatsoever with the Theosophical Society to whichI had belonged from 1913 to 1916. I am infinitely grateful to this movement forhaving opened my eyes to certain aspects of Buddhism, but later I had to followmy own path.I am familiar with the explanation of René Guénon about Les Veilleurs and aboutmyself. He was mistaken on several points, particularly about my friendship withGaston Revel, which remained strong right up until his death in 1939. I havealways been direct and frank, and this has allowed me to experience in this lifefriendships that were impervious to any attack—and equally, a few enemies whowere always hidden, acting surreptitiously. Some called me diabolical, otherssatanic or attributed to me black masses and other stupidities. The Surrealistscalled me Luciferian, basing this on an essay entitled “Adam, l’homme rouge,”which I burned. In 1921, I broke with all these movements: Les Veilleurs, CentreApostolique, and—from one day to the next—I closed down the paper Le Veilleur,which had become a magazine. In general, I never appeared in public. It was toCarlos Larronde—also a great friend of Milosz—that I delegated the task ofspeaking in public, to which he was perfectly suited.The last time I saw my great friend Milosz, who more and more took refuge inCatholicism (for personal reasons that I am probably the only one to beacquainted with), was in 1929, when he said to me, in his style that bordered onthe whimsical: “Why don’t you want to turn Catholic? Then there would be atleast two Catholics in the world.” Later, he took refuge in a lay order ofTrappists. O. W. de Lubicz-Milosz, prince of Lusace, count of Labunovo, head ofthe Bozawola branch of the Lubicz clan, welcomed me into this clan with theright to the coat of arms and to its titles. What there is that is most preciousfor me in this affair is to wear the ring with the Lubicz arms, a jewel thatbelonged to Milosz’s father, a constant reminder for me of one of my mostsincere and most rewarding friendships. From 1930 on, I sought out isolation,and, giving my new address to only a few friends, I secluded myself here atPlan-de-Grasse and later for two years in Mallorca, in an old hospice from thetime of Raymond Lully, then in Egypt, source of all wisdom."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX ETRANSLATION OF PIERRE DUJOLS’S OBITUARYFor a facsimile of the obituary, see figure 5.15 on page 80.Mr. Pierre DujolsThis past April 19, Mr. Pierre Dujols died at the age of 64 after several daysof suffering and a life that had been physically overwhelming for many years.Mr. Dujols, not well known by the general public, was known to a small circle ofpeople who struggled to penetrate the secrets of hermetic science. In myopinion, Mr. Dujols possessed a body of knowledge in this field that places himat the forefront of those who studied the Kabbalah and hermeticism in moderntimes.His extensive learning is evidenced by the catalog of esoteric books that hepublished before the war in a substantial octavo volume that constitutes a realstorehouse of useful information and quality summaries based on the sometimesconsiderable analysis he devoted to the works being cataloged.Certain of these cataloged works, sometimes being sold very cheaply, areanalyzed with two columns of densely written text. This provides for thescholars as well as for seekers the most precious and useful documentation, forCaillet’s dictionary has been limited to only very brief analyses.The studies by Mr. Dujols on the books he examined were made for his own use andwere integrated with the knowledge he had already accumulated. They point outthose things that are useful to know in order to develop the initiation thateach individual must acquire by his own efforts, and not through the didacticteaching of a group leader. Moreover, he who has, by himself, entered upon theway and who wishes to work on his inner temple will find in these analysesprecious directions, for they have come from an initiate. I declare here thewish that this catalog of Mr. Dujols may be gathered together with a listing ofthe books, organized by the names of the authors, so that it may form a preciousdocument for all seekers.We might ask, “Why did he write nothing himself? Why did he not put forth hispersonal synthesis?” Indeed, all we know that is written by him besides theseanalyses is the preface he wrote to the Mutus Liber of Mr. Nourry, a prefacethat shines with the vast learning, or rather, the “knowledge” that hepossessed. He did, however, leave behind a manuscript that he did not thinksuitable to publish during his lifetime. I do not know if it will be madepublic, but I do hope that this effort from an entire lifetime not be leftforever in darkness.A disturbing question remains about this elevated personality who has left us:Did he really, as I believe he did, know the secret of the Great Work?The refinement of his philosophy and certain enigmatic words he let drop wouldindicate (as my personal conviction indicates) that this man—so detached from asearch for glory or fame and of a fundamentally honest nature—was acquaintedwith the operational method of the Great Work, and if he did not pursue it toits ultimate accomplishment, it was only because he had to suspend hisoperations by reason of his state of health and by reason of material andfinancial difficulties.For those who do not believe in the reality of metallic transmutations but onlyin a representation of the sublimating operations of the soul, or for those who,like myself, tend not to be so concerned about this issue, he maintained withall his authority that metallic transmutation is possible, that it was knownfrom the most remote antiquity, and that it is knowledge of that alone that canprovide the power—a power both sacred and royal—to confer on the initiates theknowledge of the spiritual and material laws of the universe as well as its pastand future history.He took his secret with him, having judged it not good to divulge, even to thosewho shared his complete confidence, but his life can be an example: Those whotruly embark upon the hermetic way must expect, as did he, to meet silence,isolation, solitude, and the lack of understanding of others. There are reasonswhy the word hermit has so many connections with the name Hermes. At thethreshold of such a life, the being hesitates and ponders; he cannot conceivethat he might, at the same time, have so much knowledge and not be understood.As Christ in the Olive Garden, he is tempted to say: “Father, remove this cupfrom me.” But also like Christ, he cannot avoid entering the via dolorosa wherethere awaits him abandonment by friends, scorn, being spat upon by the ignorant,and the ascension of Calvary up until the moment when finally, for him, the veilof the Temple is rent.Mr. Pierre Dujols ascended his Calvary and now, for him, no doubt, the Holy ofHolies is devoid of mystery."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX FTRANSLATION OF THE LETTER FROM CANSELIET TO SCHWALLER DE LUBICZFor a facsimile of the letter, see figure 6.1 on pages, 102–103.Paris, December 4, 1933Sir:It is possible that my name which appears on the back of the envelope is notentirely unknown to you, for, very connected as you were with Mr. Champagne inthe final years of his life, you must have heard him sometimes speak of me.Since his death, I have continued by myself the pursuit of an aim that arosefrom a collaboration lasting seven years and for which purpose we had rented, inJanuary 1925, two adjoining garrets at 59A rue de Rochechouart. As it happens, Ihave had the good fortune and the pleasure to receive in the past few days theloan of a very interesting book, Adam, l’homme rouge, and to have learned fromit what our common friend had failed to tell me: that you are the author of thiscurious and scholarly work. You demonstrate profound knowledge at the junctureof the primitive androgynous state, as well as highly philosophical concerns—infact the same as those that gripped Mr. Champagne upon his return fromPlan-de-Grasse and that seemed to overturn his former notions. In conformitywith this new orientation, we both engaged once again in the study of caputmortuum from the first work, which we had always rejected as useless scoriahaving no value. No doubt we were wrong about that because numerous philosophersassured us that this material, with its crude aspect and its strong odor, is theflower of all metals, the flos florum, which they regard so highly. They gave itthis name because just as the flower prepares the fruit and as the fruit isvirtual in the flower, this earth carries within it the invisible embryo of anew mineral essence. The Turba Philosophorum warns us of this in two differentplaces. In one of these, “Eximiganus says: Know that our entire primaryintention is the misty Maye jacket”; in the other reference, “Theophilus says:Know, all you sons, of the doctrine that the secret of everything is a mistycovering of which the Philosophers have so often spoken.” Indeed, Avicennateaches that we must assemble our material consisting of droppings, filth, androt from the sun and the moon. Some philosophers, in order to characterize theimpurity of the magma from which the hermetic lily is born, have given it thename manure. The sage knows how to recognize our stone even in the manure,claims the Cosmopolite, whereas the one who is ignorant will not be able to findme in gold.This is a warning given to the craftsman who might be tempted, within thenatural separation or decomposition, to keep the brilliant, the dazzling, thesplendid, because it seems to him to be very pure, while despising the residualmanure, these feces, “filthy and foul,” in the midst of which, however, thererests and hides the best of what he is looking for.I am continuing, then, the labors of the Great Work in that direction which Ihave no doubt you would have impressed upon the experimentations of Mr.Champagne. As a result, and especially after reading Adam l’homme rouge, I amled to believe that you would have yourself obtained in the laboratory thisalchemical mercury, this adamic earth that is also Adam, l’homme rouge. Don’tyou in fact say, on pages 48 and 49, all the while establishing a strikingparallel between these two works, the physico-human and the physico-chemical:“Why these substances: sulfur, salt, and mercury? Because they are as typical ascan be. Sulfur, product of the fire of the earth; mercury, the water of metals,or the first earthly body; and salt, the stable state that is most pervasive. Onthe other hand, sulfur coagulates mercury and forms a salt that is black andred. We must remember that the Rosicrucian philosophers never took the wordssulfur, salt, and mercury for anything other than symbols of the Trinity. Butthat is something that the intellectualized mentality of our present-day scienceis scarcely capable of understanding.“There is a principle that acts, a principle that receives, and the two form,through a mutual love (successive attraction and repulsion from the process ofgeneration), the perfect salt that is three in one: God in the trinity, calledinto the material work of the philosophers—the philosopher’s stone, the wordstone here signifying symbolically the perfect form, the most stable, the mostmaterial, the most ‘formal.’ And the modifier philosopher’s means that it is tobe heard in the sense of esoteric knowledge …”This whole passage, in my mind, constitutes a revelation that is of no smallimportance.Similarly, on page 89, we find a very big secret in a little passage: “As forwoman, she holds in herself the memory of her decline from man into woman. Shecannot become man except by blending herself with him. Then the two will nolonger be two but an animated substance.”Might it not be that Mr. Champagne has once again shown, with respect to thismaterial aspect of your work, a memory lapse that is as surprising as it isincomprehensible, or else an importunate discretion or perhaps an excessivereserve? Whatever it may be, I have not managed to banish the painful impressionthat has been left in me by unexpected events, by unsuspected facts, that aroseboth at the end of his life and after his death and which gave rise to horriblescenes. I scarcely know how to determine whether these scenes were moredisgusting than they were painful. I must also say that for a long time, therehad arisen unnoticed and had been maintained over him the deplorable dominationof a woman—alas, a domination such as that which narrow-minded individuals toooften exert over superior minds.But all that is nothing and is of no interest other than that interest,negligible in itself, which we can attach to the fabricated things of thisworld. It is a completely different value that I ascribe to the response thatyou might judge proper to send me in order to enlighten me, insofar as you judgeit useful so to do, given the key importance of the great work.Yours truly,Eugène Canseliet10 quai des CélestinsParis, 4th arrondissement"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX GCHRONOLOGY OF EUGÈNE CANSELIET (FROM ATORÈNE, LE LABORATOIRE ALCHIMIQUE,TRÉDANIEL)1899He is born at Sarcelles (département of Val-d’Oise) on Monday, December 18, 8:00p.m., the son of Eugène-Léon Canseliet.

Three 72-degree aspects mark a personality or acircumstance that is really out of the ordinary, indicating thereby a life thatrelates to that which is beyond, toward elsewhere, as we might say: the placebehind the mirror, the world of unmanifest things and of the unfolding ofevents.Classical astrology provides very few indications of the properties of thisaspect. On the other hand, it divides the 360-degree circle into five equalparts. There are other seldom used aspects, such as 51 degrees, which dividesthe zodiac into seven parts and which can therefore be attributed to Libra; orthat of 40 degrees, which would reinforce the influence of Jupiter.The 72-degree aspect is an aspect of Leo. Some authors attribute to it theproperties of good fortune, of creation, a sort of baraka.[../Images/img0042.jpg]Fig. H.1. Natal chart of Pierre Dujols, born at Saint-Illide in the Cantalregion at 7:00 A.M., March 22, 1862The ruler of the chart, the Sun in the present case, is exalted at 1 degree ofAries, but it is in the twelfth house, which portends good fortune, a socialsuccess through the intermediary of secret, occult, and hidden facts. But socialsuccess and good fortune are limited. This same Sun at 1 degree of Aries isframed by Neptune and Pluto. Pluto is in its detriment in the sign of Taurus.This triptych is the mark of an active search using the imagination. Spiritualor scientific elements can be mixed with this, but in an odd manner. Sometimesthe essential is lost sight of. On the emotional side, there coexists themeeting of exceptional individuals with whom one could have chaotic or agonizingrelationships. Strong intuition that is not always controlled can lead theperson to a conversion or to an art that turns his life upside down.The Aries Ascendant between the Sun and Pluto is an indicator of strong activityand of convictions bitterly defended. Through Pluto, there is a work and apersonality behind the scenes, along with scarcely common endeavors and aconstant need to hide a segment of life. This same Pluto is in an aspect of 72degrees with Venus approaching the twelfth house. That aspect is the indicatorof a secret passion governing the existence. Pluto, ruler of the first house inthe first house, strengthens the secret goals of the individual and confers onhim a power to get to the bottom of things and people. The Sun, ruler of theAscendant in the twelfth house, conjunct Neptune, predestines, once again, anindividual’s hiding of himself and at times a self-delusion in spite of animportant interior life. It is also the indication of a social life that can besubject to ordeals and illnesses. The individual, however, will rise above thatand dominate those around him. Mars is exalted in the sign of Capricorn in thetenth house and predisposes an individual to shine late in life. An aspect ofSun-Uranus in the second house in the sign of Gemini reveals a life offriendships that are intellectually and spiritually rich. There can be friendsengaged in occult deeds.Taurus is in the second house, conjunct the Black Moon. Karma affects materialgoods. The ruler of this second house, Venus, is on the cusp of the Moon. Thesecond ruler, the Moon, which is squaring Jupiter, with Jupiter itself beingretrograde in the sixth house and in Virgo, leads us to think that the wealth ofthis individual is secret or spiritual and arises essentially from his work. Theframing of the Black Moon between Uranus and Pluto can be the mark of healthproblems, important psychic problems (violent on occasion), and intenseupheavals.The sign of Gemini is in the third house; its ruler Mercury is in the twelfth inPisces. This is the sign of an intelligence that draws its strength from dreamsand faith. There is a marked aesthetic sense and perhaps also a taste for thearts. Inspiration is definitely indicated. Thoughts and writings on religious oroccult topics are finely nuanced.The sign of Cancer is in the fourth house. This gives importance to the end oflife. The Moon in Sagittarius in the ninth house squares Jupiter in the sixth,in its detriment and retrograde. Jupiter is also conjunct Saturn; this suggeststhat the latter part of life is sickly, although spent in higher pursuits, andis undoubtedly laborious.With the sign of Leo in the fifth house, the ruler in Aries in the twelfth housegives a generous passion in love but leans toward hidden passion.Virgo is in the sixth house with Saturn and Jupiter conjunct. This individual’slife can be devoted to a particular task, but Jupiter in its detriment andretrograde squaring the Moon limits his social recognition and success. Certaindigestive or skeletal functions can be affected by chronic conditions. Mercury,ruler of Virgo, suggests a tendency toward a certain isolation.Libra is in the seventh house. Its rulers are, respectively, in the twelfthhouse (Venus) and in the sixth (Saturn). This can make for contracts that turninto hardships later on. Saturn is found here in the twelfth house from itsplace of exaltation. The end of life is strongly marked and affected.Scorpio is in the eighth house. Its ruler, Mars, is exalted in Capricorn in thetenth. The psychic power of the individual is exalted; this individual can beled to seek or to discover people with powers.Sagittarius is in the ninth house, which includes the Moon. This suggests agreat liveliness of mind and voyages of the imagination. The ruler of the ninthhouse, Jupiter, is in the third house from its exaltation. There is benefit fromthings of the mind and from writings on subjects that may be occult orreligious. The Moon is in the eighth sign fom its exaltation in Taurus.Capricorn is in the tenth house, which includes the part of Fortune and Marsexalted, leading the individual toward scientific or library work.The sign of Aquarius is in the eleventh house. There is an importance attachedto friendship and to friends who have financial means—also to friends inpositions of authority. Uranus, ruler of Aquarius, is in the second house,aspected by the Sun.The twelfth house is very full. There we find Venus, Neptune, Mercury, and theSun. Venus is in the sign of Pisces. Mercury here helps discovery throughreasoning based on hidden facts. Venus mitigates the ordeals in part, butNeptune suggests betrayal. The Sun ensures success in private life but avitality suddenly lessened. Jupiter, ruler of the twelfth in the sixth, presagesdifficulties in the areas of health and hidden income.Let us be cautious, however, with this very classical and limitedinterpretation. We could say that the 72-degree aspects indicate good fortune upto a given point. We could add, in summary, that in spite of an exceptionalwisdom, destiny strongly limits the goals of this individual. The taste for thesecret is too pronounced, the home inadequate, the income certainlyinsufficient, freedom is definite but spiritual: in the mind, attained late, andcommunicated to many. This same part of the mind is in the fourth house inCancer with its two rulers squared. We also notice the Ascendant at the exactpoint of exaltation of the Sun at 19 degrees of Aries. We can also say that thehouse of friendships, the eleventh, is distinguished by two rulers that aresquared. There will certainly be rich friends, but the individual is led toserve them intellectually.As an example of the use of 72-degree aspects, we can note the chart of atransmutation (fig. H.2), that of the gold medallion shown by an adept to thechemist Helvetius. At first glance, any well-informed astrologer willdistinguish in it the whole importance that the alchemists attribute toastrology. The gold from transmutations is here understood in its true aim—thatof a priestly and theurgic tokening.Paris, October 14, 1991François Trojani, author of the alchemical commentary on Tarots de Mantegna,Éditions Seydoux[../Images/img0056.jpg]Fig. H.2.

Hewas an Aquarian by his Sun sign with an Aries Ascendant.If the natal chart is the structure of the energies of an individual, describingthe potentialities that can be developed in the course of his existence and thenaccomplished, only a direct contact with the individual can inform us about hislevel of consciousness, his understanding of his own riches, and the integrationof his inner conflicts. Given these cautions regarding the use of this chart,the aim of the examination of the chart of Champagne will be, above all, tograsp his essence in its entirety.Very marked by his solar sign, Aquarius, he is above all an idealist, aninnovator, scarcely a conformist, and independent. Deeply touched by theevolution of human beings, he aspires in a brotherly enthusiasm to bring hisPromethean contribution to the human race. The presence of the Sun in theeleventh house strengthens his concern for social and collective participation,as well as his desire to widely circulate his knowledge, which is often ahead ofits time.[../Images/img0050.jpg]Fig. I.1. Natal chart of Jean-Julien ChampagneAnother powerful element in his chart, Jupiter in Sagittarius in the ninthhouse, reinforces humanitarian idealism and the quest for truth. Carried away byan insatiable and boundless thirst for knowledge, in a welcoming attitude oftolerance he always seeks to blend Epicureanism and philosophy, science andspirituality.He can also be portrayed as a curious gatherer of encyclopedic knowledge. Theconjunction of Mercury and the Sun in the sign of Aquarius makes him a verycerebral being, impassioned by reading and writing. He has a quick and inventivemind, is independent in his choices, and, following his personal convictions,cares little for the conventions of his time. With an open and universalintelligence, he multiplies his sources of information, always on the quest fora philosophy of life. The support of Mars in the conjunction of Sun-Mercurymakes him pragmatic, an experimenter, a practical and positive soul who loves toplunge into concrete realities, always giving precedence to the application andthe utilitarian rather than to pure abstraction. His eagerness to plunge in isequaled only by his impatience.Being in harmony with his inner life and his private faith and acting from hisintuition and his inspiration is the essential mode for an Aries Ascendanthaving Neptune in the first house. He has courage and audacity and a side thatis a bit prophetic. We might even risk describing him as a gentle visionary, awild romantic with an unstructured life, living at the whim of his recklesshumor; he experiences a kind of letting go through a direct contact with themovements of the soul. It is vital for this kind of person to feel himselfliving intensely, to blend resolutely with the object he contemplates or worksupon, totally fixating on his endeavors right up to a complete identificationwith them.Letting his imagination wander in the land of ecstasy and prolonging moments ofillumination and even of higher consciousness become so imperative that we caneasily imagine he is tempted more often than he ought to be by stimulants of allsorts, prolonging through them his subtle madness and delaying the moment of areturn to day-to-day reality. As does any individual ahead of his time and farfrom the daily concerns of his contemporaries, he may often shock, astonish, ordisturb those around him as much by his marginal manner of living as by hiseccentric clothing.Only a quest for truth has importance in his eyes. It is this truth that theAscendant Aries, well aspected by Mars in Sagittarius in the eighth house,pursues wildly, with force and enthusiasm and with no regard for his life or forhis health. We must imagine him as a fierce worker, indefatigable, throwinghimself as if intoxicated—sometimes even at death’s door—into Herculean anddangerous battles. In other words, racing cars might attract him. Through Mars,ruler of the Ascendant in the eighth house, he gives importance only to thatwhich is difficult, that which offers a challenge to be taken up, that in whichan exploration calls him.His sexuality is also passionate, very definitely urgent and obsessive. Alwaysto push farther the limits of sensual pleasure: Is this not the beginning of aspiritual search, the ignition of an opening awareness of the transmutation ofenergies? This is entirely the symbolism of the eighth house: sexuality as aninitiatory death leading to rebirth.For Champagne, any search can be accompanied only by the integration of energiesfrom “below.” Mars makes explicit in his chart this burning desire to exploreour dark side in order to bring it to the light, a desire to exorcise thisdarkness without fear or restraint.It is now time to broach the great contradiction of the chart, which, as for anyoverriding tension, seeks out a way to be sublimated in order to ward off adescent into a destructive neurosis that could compromise the stability of thepersonality.In this case, there is a contradiction between the sign of Taurus and that ofAquarius: the need of Taurus to be attached to the material and the desire ofAquarius to separate from it. Such is the challenge Champagne is offered if hetruly wants to play the role of one who awakens humanity.Originally, everything is material, and the Moon, in Taurus in this case,incarnates appropriately the original form, the raw material on which all ourattachments and all our dependencies are built: voluptuousness of earthly food,unlimited pleasure of the senses, an instinct for owning and keeping. Champagneis very sensitive to this quite acute perception of his incarnation and of theprimordial needs that flow from it. He is likely plagued by contradictorydemands: taking advantage of the simple pleasures of life, not going beyond thematerial aspect of things, settling into permanency, and, at the other extreme,giving up all attachments and letting himself be guided by intuition of theephemeral.In daily life, the observer can only delight in falling into comical situationsthat might be generated by incompatible elements. As negligent as thisindividual might be about his body, he might also have his compulsions about hisdaily grooming.If the appearance of his clothing means little to him, he can yet succumb tostylishness in looking for underwear and outfits that have a certainoriginality, perhaps those unearthed at some secondhand clothing dealer. Venusin Capricorn imparts a taste for antiques, and the good aspect of Venus to theMoon confers on him an undeniable seductive charm that attracts feminineattention—an attention that, of course, he appreciates.We would be fooling ourselves to think that Champagne is completely uninterestedin matters of money. An individual who shares his natal chart has his littledeals and tricks, and he may occasionally live out a filching worthy of Harpagonin Molière’s The Miser. With holes in his pocket some days, ascetic dress onothers, he is just as capable of expansive gestures as of scrounging attitudes.Coming back to the Moon, which is in a strategic position in Champagne’s chart,we find it framed by Neptune and Pluto. If Neptune represents a function ofdissolution, Pluto represents transformation, a destruction leading to rebirth.With such a framing, matter is accepted in its finite and limited structure. Hefeels intensely the state of confusion and dissolution of material through theinfluence of Neptune, the dissociating of its various components. Through theinfluence of Pluto, the simple identification with material can only be sweptaway. This is the necessity of destroying matter in order to get to the heart ofthe atom and then to reconstitute a different, restructured material purged ofits flabbiness and imperfection. How can we not see in this insistent torture ofmatter the whole alchemical process, which begins with the dissolution of matterand seeks its transmutation?Beyond this alchemical connection, it must be understood how, with Pluto, thesensitivity of Champagne is painful, an ever-present anguish with a poignantfeeling of insecurity and exclusion. And his sexuality, as intense as it is,cannot be consummated through his unsatisfied desires and his maniacal drives.How can such an individual find relaxation? Liberating oneself from matter whileintegrating the invasive shadowy part and making from it an elixir of life: Thisis the basis of all the creativity in which Champagne was engaged.This helps us to understand better the whole work on the body and on metals, hisinterest in the constituent elements of nature and the veneration of forms.Uranus in the sixth house attests to all his qualities as a technician and histruly scientific mind, and Venus finds all her meaning in Capricorn, whileseeking sobriety and the delineation of forms.The Midheaven, place of our social accomplishments, framed by Jupiter and Venus,would lead us to presume this individual’s desire for a certain success, an easein making acquaintances and being noticed, but also a search for appreciation,compliments, honors, and homage accorded to his merits.In this, too, his fierce desire for independence and for being apart cannot besatisfied by facile exterior indications. This might lead us to expectcontradictory and very ambivalent attitudes in his social behavior.Capricorn in the tenth house and its ruler Saturn in the twelfth house suggestlate recognition and posthumous fame.Saturn in the twelfth house is also, for him, the field of his accomplishmentand of his rising above himself: a work of research that is lonely, humble, andlaborious, sheltered from curious looks, the choice of an existence that is lessglorious and the acceptance of cultivating his own secret garden in silence.In the twelfth house, the future is prepared, and the individual must understandthe importance of guarding his treasures . . . in a word, he must be a sage.Cast in May 1989by Véronique Guilet, astrologer, Grenoble"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX JBIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE WORKS OF RENÉ SCHWALLER DE LUBICZ(in order of publication)Étude sur les Nombres.

His major work is La Revanche des Bêtes (The Revenge of theBeasts).The launching of the cabaret Le Chat Noir in Montmartre arose from the meetingof the painter Rodolphe Salis and Émile Goudeau. The latter had created a poetrycircle, Les Hydropathes, to which singers and poets came to drink and exchangeideas about their work. Meetings took place at the Soleil d’Or on the boulevardSaint-Michel. During the same period, a thin, ghostly poet from Picardy settledin at 84 boulevard Rochechouart, where he transformed a former postal substationinto a workshop and a factory for the production of religious paintings. Now, ithappened that one evening Émile Goudeau stopped at the Grande Pinte. After hehad been there a few moments, a lively troupe burst in. In this group were thepainter Gilbert and Léon Valade. Gilbert pointed out to his friend Goudeau ayoung man among them who was about to open an artists cabaret at 84 boulevardRochechouart. This young man, named Rodolphe Salis, invited Émile Goudeau to theinaugural dinner and when, at this opening event, he saw all these artists andwriters gathered, he understood the advantage that he could draw from it.

We dolearn something from them. Not only do the Adherents of Hiéron promotethemselves as Templars and Knights of the Grail, but furthermore, they proclaimthemselves “Apostles of the Final Times,” those who were called for by theVirgin of la Salette in a secret connected with the Holy See. In addition, inthis document, which has been published, the Apparition of la Salette implicatesthe clergy and “makes a pressing appeal to the Apostles of the Final Times,Those who know.” Indeed, the promoters of this crusade boast of possessingKnowledge. There is some truth in these claims, but to what extent? …The Adherents of Hiéron was also called the Société du Règne (Society of theReign) or Société des Fastes (Society of the Glorious). This group was formed in1875 by the Jesuit Drevon at Paray-le-Monial. His avowed purpose was to provethe reality of the reign of Christ and to prepare for his coming at the end ofthis cycle. Christianity was considered the flowering of the PrimordialTradition transmitted by the Atlanteans, according to Jacques d’Arès.On this topic, also see Félix de Rosnay, Le Hiéron du Val d’Or (Paray-le-Monial,1900).Father Victor Drevon organized pilgrimages to Paray-le-Monial. In 1873, he metBaron Alexis de Sarachaga and, before his death in Rome in 1880, entrusted tohim the task of founding the Société du Règne Social de Jésus-Christ (Society ofthe Reign of Jesus Christ in Society), the aim of which, in relation to therevelations of Sainte Marguerite-Marie, was “to offer to Jesus Christ the Hostsocial reparations that he claimed himself at Paray in 1869.”Baron de Sarachaga, supporter of the claims to the French throne by Karl WilliamNaundorff, devoted his efforts to the elaboration of Hiéron, a center from whichwould spread forth for forty years strange, millennial, hermetic doctrines.

In 1575, he married Jeanne de Medina Coeli inSpain. Under Louis XV, the descendants of this marriage are to be found inFrance in the person of Charles-Louis de Valois. He died at the Bastille and hiswife became insane. Her son was then adopted by a workman named Guillaume Dujol.In 1885, we ﬁnd a Dujol bringing to the court of Aurillac a request for acorrection of his civil status in order to be recognized as Henri-Charles-Louisd’Usson, d’Auvergne, d’Alençon, prince of Valois. It doesn’t seem that the courtacted upon this strange request, yet there are still people using the nameDujol. In the regions of Lyons and Auvergne before the last war, we found a“royal league” devoted to the cause of Monseigneur Henri de Valois, which wasconfused with the cause of a Henri Dujol.In admitting the reality of the Polish marriage and the Spanish marriage of ourtwo Valois, we must be clear that their civil and monarchic values were not thesame. If they were legitimate, they were deﬁnitely not authorized, which wouldbe enough to exclude their offspring from royal succession.Author’s note: The reference to the “Polish marriage” relates to the brother ofFrançois de Valois, Henri III, who would have entered into two marriages—one in1573 with a Polish woman and the other with Louise de Vaudémont.g [../Text/04.html#anchor_290_5] [Webster’s Third defines thaumaturgist as “aperformer of miracles, especially a magician.” —Ed.]h [../Text/04.html#anchor_302_84] Madame Dujols was born in the département ofMorbihan on February 2, 1868, at 2:00 A.M. on the rue Neuve in Hennebont.
