It was almost four in the morning and the auction was only nowdrawing to a close. A digital display behind the celebrity auctioneer—an actorwho had played James Bond on-screen for many years—showed the running total atmore than one million euro.“Lot number two hundred and ten: a pair of early-nineteenth-century JapaneseKabuki masks.”A ripple of excitement ran through the crowded room. Inlaid with chips of solidjade, the Kabuki masks were the highlight of the auction and were expected tofetch in excess of half a million euro.At the back of the room the tall, thin man with the fuzz of close-cropped snowwhite hair was prepared to pay twice that.Niccolò Machiavelli stood apart from the rest of the crowd, arms lightly foldedacross his chest, careful not to wrinkle his Savile Row–tailored black silktuxedo. Stone gray eyes swept over the other bidders, analyzing and assessingthem. There were really only five others he needed to look out for: two privatecollectors like himself, a minor European royal, a once-famous American movieactor and a Canadian antiques dealer. The remainder of the audience were tired,had spent their budget or were unwilling to bid on the vaguelydisturbing-looking masks.Machiavelli loved all types of masks. He had been collecting them for a verylong time, and he wanted this particular pair to complete his collection ofJapanese theater costumes. These masks had last come up for sale in 1898 inVienna, and he had then been outbid by a Romanov prince. Machiavelli hadpatiently bided his time; the masks would come back on the market again when thePrince and his descendents died. Machiavelli knew he would still be around tobuy them; it was one of the many advantages of being immortal.“Shall we start the bidding at one hundred thousand euro?”Machiavelli looked up, caught the auctioneer’s attention and nodded.The auctioneer had been expecting his bid and nodded in return. “I am bid onehundred thousand euro by Monsieur Machiavelli. Always one of this charity’s mostgenerous supporters and sponsors.”A smattering of applause ran around the room, and several people turned to lookat him and raise their glasses. Niccolò acknowledged them with a polite smile.“Do I have one hundred and ten?” the auctioneer asked.One of the private collectors raised his hand slightly.“One-twenty?” The auctioneer looked back to Machiavelli, who immediately nodded.Within the next three minutes, a flurry of bids brought the price up to twohundred and fifty thousand euro. There were only three serious bidders left:Machiavelli, the American actor and the Canadian.Machiavelli’s thin lips twisted into a rare smile; his patience was about to berewarded, and finally the masks would be his. Then the smile faded as he feltthe cell phone in his back pocket buzz silently. For an instant he was temptedto ignore it; he’d given his staff strict instructions that he was not to bedisturbed unless it was absolutely critical. He also knew they were so terrifiedof him that they would not phone unless it was an emergency. Reaching into hispocket, he pulled out the ultraslim phone and glanced down.A picture of a sword pulsed gently on the large LCD screen.Machiavelli’s smile vanished. In that second he knew he was not going to be ableto buy the Kabuki masks this century. Turning on his heel, he strode out of theroom and pressed the phone to his ear. Behind him, he could hear theauctioneer’s hammer hit the lectern “Sold. For two hundred and sixty thousandeuro…”“I’m here,” Machiavelli said, reverting to the Italian of his youth.The line crackled and an English-accented voice responded in the same language,using a dialect that had not been heard in Europe for more than four hundredyears. “I need your help.”The man on the other end of the line didn’t identify himself, nor did he needto; Machiavelli knew it was the immortal magician and necromancer Dr. John Dee,one of the most powerful and dangerous men in the world.Niccolò Machiavelli strode out of the small hotel into the broad cobbled squareof the Place du Tertre and stopped to breathe in the chill night air. “What canI do for you?” he asked cautiously. He detested Dee and knew the feeling wasmutual, but they both served the Dark Elders, and that meant they had beenforced to work together down through the centuries. Machiavelli was alsoslightly envious that Dee was younger than he—and looked it. Machiavelli hadbeen born in Florence in 1469, which made him fifty-eight years older than theEnglish Magician. History recorded that he had died in the same year that Deehad been born, 1527.“Flamel is back in Paris.”Machiavelli straightened. “When?”“Just now. He got there through a leygate. I’ve no idea where it comes out. He’sgot Scathach with him….”Machiavelli’s lips curled into an ugly grimace. The last time he’d encounteredthe Warrior, she’d pushed him through a door. It had been closed at the time,and he’d spent weeks picking splinters from his chest and shoulders.“There are two humani children with him. Americans,” Dee said, his voice echoingand fading on the transatlantic line. “Twins,” he added.“Say again?” Machiavelli asked.“Twins,” Dee added, “with pure gold and silver auras. You know what that means,”he snapped.“Yes,” Machiavelli muttered. It meant trouble. Then the tiniest of smiles curledhis thin lips. It could also mean opportunity.Static crackled and then Dee’s voice continued. “The girl’s powers were Awakenedby Hekate before the Goddess and her Shadowrealm were destroyed.”“Untrained, the girl is no threat,” Machiavelli murmured, quickly assessing thesituation. He took a breath and added, “Except perhaps to herself and thosearound her.”“Flamel took the girl to Ojai. There, the Witch of Endor instructed her in theMagic of Air.”“No doubt you tried to stop them?” There was a hint of amusement inMachiavelli’s voice.“Tried. And failed,” Dee admitted bitterly. “The girl has some knowledge but iswithout skill.”“What do you want me to do?” Machiavelli asked carefully, although he alreadyhad a very good idea.“Find Flamel and the twins,” Dee demanded. “Capture them. Kill Scathach if youcan. I’m just leaving Ojai. But it’s going to take me fourteen or fifteen hoursto get to Paris.”“What happened to the leygate?” Machiavelli wondered aloud. If a leygateconnected Ojai and Paris, then why didn’t Dee…?“Destroyed by the Witch of Endor,” Dee raged, “and she nearly killed me, too. Iwas lucky to escape with a few cuts and scratches,” he added, and then ended thecall without saying good-bye.Niccolò Machiavelli closed his phone carefully and tapped it against his bottomlip. Somehow he doubted that Dee had been lucky—if the Witch of Endor had wantedhim dead, then even the legendary Dr. Dee would not have escaped. Machiavelliturned and walked across the square to where his driver was patiently waitingwith the car. If Flamel, Scathach and the American twins had come to Paris via aleygate, then there were only a few places in the city where they could haveemerged. It should be relatively easy to find and capture them.And if he could capture them tonight, then he would have plenty of time to workon them before Dee arrived.Machiavelli smiled; he’d only need a few hours, and in that time they would tellhim everything they knew. Half a millennium on this earth had taught him how tobe very persuasive indeed."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOJosh Newman reached out and pressed the palm of his right hand against the coldstone wall to steady himself.What had just happened?One moment he’d been standing in the Witch of Endor’s shop in Ojai, California.His sister, Sophie, Scathach and the man he now knew to be Nicholas Flamel hadbeen in the mirror looking out at him. And the next thing he knew, Sophie hadstepped out of the glass, taken his hand and pulled him through it. He’dsqueezed his eyes shut and felt something icy touch his skin and raise the smallhairs on the back of his neck. When he’d opened his eyes again, he was standingin what looked like a tiny storage room. Pots of paint, stacked ladders, brokenpieces of pottery and bundled paint-spattered cloths were piled around a large,rather ordinary-looking grimy mirror fixed to the stone wall. A singlelow-wattage lightbulb shed a dim yellow glow over the room. “What happened?” heasked, his voice cracking. He swallowed hard and tried again. “What happened?Where are we?”“We’re in Paris,” Nicholas Flamel said delightedly, rubbing his dusty handsagainst his black jeans. “The city of my birth.”“Paris?” Josh whispered. He was going to say “Impossible,” but he was beginningto understand that that word had no meaning anymore. “How?” he asked aloud.“Sophie?” He looked to his twin sister, but she had pressed her ear against theroom’s only door and was listening intently. She waved him away. He turned toScathach, but the red-haired warrior just shook her head, both hands coveringher mouth. She looked as if she was about to throw up. Josh finally turned tothe legendary Alchemyst, Nicholas Flamel. “How did we get here?” he asked.“This planet is crisscrossed with invisible lines of power sometimes called leylines or cursus,” Flamel explained. He crossed his index fingers. “Where two ormore lines intersect a gateway exists. Gates are incredibly rare now, but inancient times the Elder Race used them to travel from one side of the world tothe other in an instant—just as we did. The Witch opened the leygate in Ojai andwe ended up here, in Paris.” He made it sound so matter-of-fact.“Leygates: I hate them,” Scatty mumbled. In the gloomy light, her pale, freckledskin looked green. “You ever been seasick?” she asked.Josh shook his head. “Never.”Sophie looked up from her spot leaning against the door. “Liar! He gets seasickin a swimming pool.” She grinned, then pressed the side of her face back againstthe cool wood.“Seasick,” Scatty mumbled. “That’s exactly what it feels like. Only worse.”Sophie turned her head again to look at the Alchemyst. “Do you have any ideawhere we are in Paris?”“Someplace old, I’m guessing,” Flamel said, joining her at the door. He put theside of his head back against the door and listened.Sophie stepped back. “I’m not so sure,” she said hesitantly.“Why not?” Josh asked. He glanced around the small untidy room. It certainlylooked as though it was part of an old building.Sophie shook her head. “I don’t know…it just doesn’t feel that old.” She reachedout and touched the wall with the palm of her hand, then immediately jerked itback again.“What’s wrong?” Josh whispered.Sophie placed her hand against the wall again. “I can hear voices, songs andwhat sounds like organ music.”Josh shrugged. “I can’t hear anything.” He stopped, abruptly conscious of thehuge difference between himself and his twin. Sophie’s magical potential hadbeen Awakened by Hekate, and she was now hypersensitive to sights and sounds,smells, touch and taste.“I can.” Sophie lifted her hand from the stone wall and the sounds in her headfaded.“You’re hearing ghost sounds,” Flamel explained. “They’re just noises absorbedby the building, recorded into the very structure itself.”“This is a church,” Sophie said decisively, then frowned. “It’s a newchurch…modern, late nineteenth century, early twentieth. But it’s built on amuch, much older site.”Flamel paused at the wooden door and looked over his shoulder. In the dimoverhead light, his features were suddenly sharp and angular, disturbinglyskull-like, his eyes completely in shadow. “There are many churches in Paris,”he said, “though there is only one, I believe, which matches that description.”He reached for the door handle.“Hang on a second,” Josh said quickly. “Don’t you think there’ll be some sort ofalarm?”“Oh, I doubt it,” Nicholas said confidently. “Who would put an alarm on astoreroom in a church?” he asked, jerking the door open.Immediately an alarm pealed through the air, the sound echoing and reechoing offthe flagstones and walls. Red security lights strobed and flashed.Scatty sighed and muttered something in an ancient Celtic language. “Didn’t youtell me once to wait before moving, to look before stepping and to observeeverything?” she demanded.Nicholas shook his head and sighed at the stupid mistake. “Getting old, Iguess,” he said in the same language. But there was no time for apologies.“Let’s go!” he shouted over the shrieking alarm, and darted down the corridor.Sophie and Josh followed close behind, while Scatty took up the rear, movingslowly and grumbling with every step.The door opened onto a short narrow stone corridor that led to another woodendoor. Without pausing, Flamel pushed through the second door—and immediately anew alarm began to shriek. He turned left into a huge open space that smelled ofold incense, floor polish and wax. Banks of lit candles shed a golden yellowlight over walls and floor and, combined with the security lights, revealed apair of enormous doors with the word EXIT above them. Flamel raced toward it,his footsteps echoing.“Don’t touch—” Josh began, but Nicholas Flamel grasped the door handles andpulled hard.A third alarm—much louder than the others—went off, and a red light above thedoor began to wink on and off.“Told you not to touch,” Josh muttered.“I can’t understand it—why is it not open?” Flamel asked, shouting to be heardabove the din. “This church is always open.” He turned and looked around. “Whereis everyone? What time is it?” he asked, as a thought struck him.“How long does it take to travel from one place to another through the leygate?”Sophie asked.“It’s instantaneous.”“And you’re sure we’re in Paris, France?”“Positive.”Sophie looked at her watch and did a quick calculation. “Paris is nine hoursahead of Ojai?” she asked.Flamel nodded, suddenly understanding.“It’s about four o’clock in the morning; that’s why the church is closed,”Sophie said.“The police will be on their way,” Scatty said glumly. She reached for hernunchaku. “I hate fighting when I’m not feeling well,” she muttered.“What do we do now?” Josh demanded, panic rising in his voice.“I could try and blast the doors apart with wind,” Sophie suggested hesitantly.She wasn’t sure she had the energy to raise the wind again so soon. She had usedher new magical powers to battle the undead in Ojai, but the effort hadcompletely exhausted her.“I forbid it,” Flamel shouted, his face painted in shades of crimson and shadow.He turned and pointed across rows of wooden pews toward an ornate altar pickedout in a tracery of white marble. Candlelight hinted at an intricate mosaic inglittering blues and golds in the dome over the altar. “This is a nationalmonument; I’ll not let you destroy it.”“Where are we?” the twins asked together, looking around the building. Now thattheir eyes had adjusted to the gloom, they realized that the building was huge.They could distinguish columns soaring high into the shadows overhead and wereable to make out the shapes of small side altars, statues in nooks and countlessbanks of candles.“This,” Flamel announced proudly, “is the church of Sacré-Coeur.” Sitting in the back of his limousine, Niccolò Machiavelli tapped coordinatesinto his laptop and watched a high-resolution map of Paris wink into existenceon the screen. Paris was an incredibly ancient city. The first settlement wentback more than two thousand years, though there had been humans living on theisland in the Seine for generations before that. And like many of the earth’soldest cities, it had been sited where groups of ley lines met.Machiavelli hit a keystroke, which laid down a complicated pattern of ley linesover the map of the city. He was looking for a line that connected with theUnited States. He finally managed to reduce the number of possibilities to six.With a perfectly manicured fingernail, he traced two lines that directly linkedthe West Coast of America to Paris. One finished at the great cathedral of NotreDame, the other in the more modern but equally famous Sacré-Coeur basilica inMontmartre.But which one?Suddenly, the Parisian night was broken by a series of howling alarms.Machiavelli hit the control for the electric window and the darkened glasswhispered down. Cool night air swirled into the car. In the distance, risinghigh above the rooftops on the opposite side of the Place du Tertre, wasSacré-Coeur. The imposing domed building was always lit up at night in starkwhite light. Tonight, however, red alarm lights pulsed around the buildingThat one. Machiavelli’s smile was terrifying. He called up a program on thelaptop and waited while the hard drive spun.Enter password.His fingers flew over the keyboard as he typed: Discorsi sopra la prima deca diTito Livio. No one was going to break that password. It wasn’t one of hisbetter-known books.A rather ordinary-looking text document appeared, written in a combination ofLatin, Greek and Italian. Once, magicians had had to keep their spells andincantations in handwritten books called grimoires, but Machiavelli had alwaysused the latest technology. He preferred to keep his spells on his hard drive.Now he just needed a little something to keep Flamel and his friends busy whilehe gathered his forces. Josh’s head snapped up. “I hear police sirens.”“There are twelve police cars headed this way,” Sophie said, her head tilted toone side, eyes closed as she listened intently.“Twelve? How can you tell?”Sophie looked at her twin. “I can distinguish the different locations of thesirens.”“You can tell them apart?” he asked. He found himself wondering, yet again, atthe full extent of his sister’s senses.“Each one,” she said.“We must not be captured by the police,” Flamel interjected sharply. “We’veneither passports nor alibis. We’ve got to get out of here!”“How?” the twins asked simultaneously.Flamel shook his head. “There has to be another entrance…,” he began, and thenstopped, nostrils flaring.Josh watched uneasily as both Sophie and Scatty suddenly reacted to something hecould not smell. “What…what is it?” he demanded, and then he suddenly caught thefaintest whiff of something musky and rank. It was the sort of smell he’d cometo associate with a zoo.“Trouble,” Scathach said grimly, putting away her nunchaku and drawing herswords. “Big trouble.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE“What?” Josh demanded, looking around. The smell was stronger now, stale andbitter, and almost familiar….“Snake,” Sophie said, breathing deeply. “It’s a snake.”Josh felt his stomach lurch. Snake. Why did it have to be snakes? He wasterrified of snakes—though he’d never admit it to anyone, especially not hissister. “Snakes…,” he began, but his voice sounded high-pitched and strangled.He coughed and tried again. “Where?” he asked, looking around desperately,imagining them everywhere, sliding out from under the pews, curling down thepillars, dropping down from the light fixtures.Sophie shook her head and frowned. “I don’t hear any…. I’m just…smelling them.”Her nostrils flared as she drew a deep breath. “No, there’s just one….”“Oh, you’re smelling a snake, all right…but one that walks on two legs,” Scattysnapped. “You’re smelling the rank odor of Niccolò Machiavelli.”Flamel knelt on the floor in front of the massive main doors and ran his handsover the locks. Wisps of green smoke curled from his fingers. “Machiavelli!” hespat. “Dee didn’t waste any time contacting his allies, I see.”“You can tell who it is from the smell?” Josh asked, still surprised and alittle confused.“Every person has a distinctive magical odor,” Scatty explained, standing withher back to the Alchemyst, protecting him. “You two smell of vanilla ice creamand oranges, Nicholas smells of mint…”“And Dee smelled of rotten eggs…,” Sophie added.“Sulfur,” Josh said.“Which was once known as brimstone,” Scatty said. “Very appropriate for Dr.Dee.” Her head was moving from side to side as she paid particular attention tothe deep shadows behind the statues. “Well, Machiavelli smells of snakes.Appropriate too.”“Who is he?” Josh asked. He felt as if he should know the name, almost as ifhe’d heard it before. “A friends of Dee’s?”“Machiavelli is an immortal allied to the Dark Elders,” Scatty explained, “andno friend to Dee, though they are on the same side. Machiavelli is older thanthe Magician, infinitely more dangerous and certainly more cunning. I shouldhave killed him when I had the chance,” she said bitterly. “For the past fivehundred years he has been at the heart of European politics, the puppet masterworking in the shadows. The last I heard, he had been appointed the head of theDGSE, the Direction Générale de la Sécurité Extérieure.”“Is that like a bank?” Josh asked.Scatty’s lips curled in a tiny smile that exposed her overlong vampire incisors.“It means the General Board of External Security. It is the French secretservice.”“The secret service! Oh, that’s just great,” Josh said sarcastically.“The smell is getting stronger,” Sophie said, her Awakened senses acutely awareof the odor. Concentrating hard, she allowed a little of her power to trickleinto her aura, which bloomed into a ghostly shadow around her. Crackles oflustrous silver threads sparkled in her blond hair, and her eyes turned toreflective silver coins.Almost unconsciously, Josh stepped away from his sister. He’d seen her like thisbefore, and she’d scared him.“That means he’s close by. He’s working some magic,” Scatty said. “Nicholas…?”“I just need another minute.” Flamel’s fingertips glowed emerald green, smokingas they traced a pattern around the lock. A solid click sounded from within, butwhen the Alchemyst tried the handle, the door didn’t move. “Maybe more than aminute.”“Too late,” Josh whispered, raising an arm and pointing. “Something’s here.”At the opposite end of the great basilica, the banks of candles had gone out. Itwas as if an unfelt breeze was sweeping down the aisles, snuffing out theflickering circular night-lights and thicker candles as it passed, leaving curlsof gray-white smoke hanging on the air. Abruptly, the smell of candle wax grewstronger, much, much stronger, almost obliterating the odor of serpent.“I can’t see anything…,” Josh began.“It’s here!” Sophie shouted.The creature that flowed up off the cold flagstones was only marginally human.Standing taller than a man, broad and grotesque, it was a gelatinous white shapewith only the vaguest hint of a head set directly onto broad shoulders. Therewere no visible features. As they watched, two huge arms separated from thetrunk of the body with a squelch and grew handlike shapes.“Golem!” Sophie shouted in horror. “A wax Golem!” She flung out her hand and heraura blazed. Ice-cold wind surged from her fingertips to batter the creature,but the white waxy skin simply rippled and flowed beneath the breeze.“Protect Nicholas!” Scathach commanded, darting forward, her matched swordsflickering out, biting into the creature, but without any effect. The soft waxtrapped her swords, and it took all her strength to pull them free. She struckagain and chips of wax sprayed into the air. The creature struck at her, and shehad to abandon her grip on her swords as she danced backward to avoid thecrushing blow. A bulbous fist thundered into the floor at her feet, spatteringglobules of white wax in every direction.Josh grabbed one of the folding wooden chairs stacked outside the gift shop atthe back of the church. Holding it by two legs, he slammed it into thecreature’s chest…where it stuck fast. As the wax shape turned toward Josh, thechair was wrenched from his hands. He grabbed another chair, darted aroundbehind the creature and slammed the chair down. It shattered across thecreature’s shoulders, leaving scores of splinters protruding like bizarreporcupine spines.Sophie froze. She desperately tried to recall some of the secrets of Air magicthat the Witch of Endor had taught her only a few hours ago. The Witch said itwas the most powerful of all magics—and Sophie had seen what it had done to theundead army of long-deceased humans and beasts Dee had raised in Ojai. But shehad no idea what would work against the wax monster before her. She knew how toraise a miniature tornado, but she couldn’t risk calling it up in the confinedspace of the basilica.“Nicholas!” Scatty called. With her swords stuck in the creature, the Warriorwas using her nunchaku—two lengths of wood attached by a short chain—to batterat the Golem. They left deep indentations in its skin but otherwise seemed tohave no effect. She delivered one particularly fierce blow that embedded thepolished wood in the creature’s side. Wax flowed around the nunchaku, trappingthem. When the creature twisted toward Josh, the weapon was ripped from theWarrior’s hands, sending her spinning across the room.A hand that was only thumb and fused fingers, like a giant mitten, caught Josh’sshoulder and squeezed. The pain was incredible and drove the boy to his knees.“Josh!” Sophie screamed, the sound echoing in the huge church.Josh tried to pull the hand away, but the wax was too slippery and his fingerssank into the white goo. Warm wax began to flow off the creature’s hand, thencurl and wrap around his shoulder and roll down onto his chest, constricting hisbreathing.“Josh, duck!”Sophie grabbed a wooden chair and swung it through the air. It whistled over herbrother’s head, the wind ruffling his hair, and she brought it downhard—edge-first—on the thick wax arm where the elbow should have been. The chairstuck halfway through, but the movement distracted the creature and it abandonedJosh, leaving him bruised and coated in a layer of candle wax. From his placekneeling on the ground, Josh watched in horror as two gelatinous hands reachedfor his twin’s throat.Terrified, Sophie screamed.Josh watched as his sister’s eyes flickered, the blue replaced with silver, andthen her aura blazed incandescent the moment the Golem’s paws came close to herskin. Immediately, its waxy hands began to run liquid and spatter to the floor.Sophie stretched out her own hand, fingers splayed, and pressed it against theGolem’s chest, where it sank, sizzling and hissing, into the mass of wax.Josh crouched on the ground, close to Flamel, his hands thrown up to protect hiseyes from the brilliant silver light. He saw his sister step closer to thecreature, her aura now painfully bright, arms spread wide, an invisible unfeltheat melting the creature, reducing the wax to liquid. Scathach’s swords andnunchaku clattered to the stone floor, followed, seconds later, by the remainsof the wooden chair.Sophie’s aura flickered and Josh was on his feet and by her side to catch her asshe swayed. “I feel dizzy,” she said thickly as she slumped into his arms. Shewas barely conscious, and she felt ice cold, the usually sweet vanilla scent ofher aura now sour and bitter.Scatty swooped in to gather up her weapons from the pile of semiliquid wax thatnow resembled a half-melted snowman. She fastidiously wiped her blades cleanbefore she slipped them back into the sheaths she wore on her back. Pickingcurls of white wax off her nunchaku, she slipped them back into their holster onher belt; then she turned to Sophie. “You saved us,” she said gravely. “That’s adebt I’ll not forget.”“Got it,” Flamel said suddenly. He stood back, and Sophie, Josh and Scathachwatched as curls of green smoke seeped from the lock. The Alchemyst pushed thedoor and it clicked open, cool night air rushing in, dispelling the cloying odorof melted wax.“We could have done with a little help, you know,” Scatty grumbled.Flamel grinned and wiped his fingers on his jeans, leaving traces of green lighton the cloth. “I knew you had it well under control,” he said, stepping out ofthe basilica. Scathach and the twins followed.The sounds of police sirens were louder now, but the area directly in front ofthe church was empty. Sacré-Coeur was set on a hill, one of the highest pointsin Paris, and from where they stood, they had a view of the entire city.Nicholas Flamel’s face lit up with delight. “Home!”“What is it with European magicians and Golems?” Scatty asked, following him.“First Dee and now Machiavelli. Have they no imaginations?”Flamel looked surprised. “That wasn’t a Golem. Golems need to have a spell ontheir body to animate them.”Scatty nodded. She knew that, of course. “What, then—?”“That was a tulpa.”Scatty’s bright green eyes widened in surprise. “A tulpa! Is Machiavelli thatpowerful, then?”“Obviously.”“What’s a tulpa?” Josh asked Flamel, but it was his sister who answered, andJosh was once again reminded of the huge gulf that had opened up between themthe moment her powers had been Awakened.“A creature created and animated entirely by the power of the imagination,”Sophie explained casually.“Precisely,” Nicholas Flamel said, breathing deeply. “Machiavelli knew therewould be wax in the church. So he brought it to life.”“But surely he knew it would not be able to stop us?” Scatty asked.Nicholas walked out from under the central arch that framed the front of thebasilica and stood at the edge of the first of the two hundred and twenty-onesteps that led down to the street far below. “Oh, he knew it wouldn’t stop us,”he said patiently. “He just wanted to slow us down, to keep us here until hearrived.” He pointed.Far below, the narrow streets of Montmartre had come alive with the sounds andlights of a fleet of French police cars. Dozens of uniformed gendarmes hadgathered at the bottom of the steps, with more arriving from the narrow sidestreets to form a cordon around the building. Surprisingly, none of them hadstarted climbing.Flamel, Scatty and the twins ignored the police. They were watching the tallthin white-haired man in the elegant tuxedo slowly make his way up the stepstoward them. He stopped when he saw them emerge from the basilica, leaned on alow metal railing and raised his right hand in a lazy salute.“Let me guess,” Josh said, “that must be Niccolò Machiavelli.”“The most dangerous immortal in Europe,” the Alchemyst said grimly. “Trust me:this man makes Dee look like an amateur.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR“Welcome back to Paris, Alchemyst.”Sophie and Josh jumped. Machiavelli was still far away to be heard so clearly.Strangely, his voice seemed to be coming from somewhere behind them, and bothturned to look, but there were only two stained green metal statues over thethree arches in front of the church: a woman on a horse to their right, herraised arm holding a sword, and a man holding a scepter on their left.“I’ve been waiting for you.” The voice seemed to be coming from the statue ofthe man.“It’s a cheap trick,” Scatty said dismissively, picking strips of wax off thefront of her steel-toed combat boots. “It’s nothing more than ventriloquism.”Sophie smiled sheepishly. “I thought the statue was talking,” she admitted,embarrassed.Josh started to laugh at his sister and then immediately reconsidered. “I guessI wouldn’t be surprised if it did.”“The good Dr. Dee sends his regards.” Machiavelli’s voice continued to hang inthe air around them.“So he survived Ojai, then,” Nicholas said conversationally, not raising hisvoice. Standing tall and straight, he casually put both hands behind his backand glanced sidelong at Scatty. Then the fingers of his right hand starteddancing against the palm and fingers of his left.Scatty drew the twins away from Nicholas and slowly retreated under the shadowedarches. Standing between them, she put her arms around their shoulders—boththeir auras crackling silver and gold with her touch—and drew their headstogether.“Machiavelli. The master of lies.” Scatty’s whisper was the merest breathagainst their ears. “He must not hear us.”“I cannot say I am pleased to see you, Signor Machiavelli. Or is it MonsieurMachiavelli in this age?” the Alchemyst said quietly, leaning against thebalustrade, looking down the white steps to where Machiavelli was still small inthe distance.“This century, I am French,” Machiavelli replied, his voice clearly audible. “Ilove Paris. It is my favorite city in Europe—after Florence, of course.”While Nicholas talked to Machiavelli, he kept his hands behind his back, out ofsight of the other immortal. His fingers were moving in an intricate series oftaps and beats.“Is he working a spell?” Sophie breathed, watching his hands.“No, he’s talking to me,” Scatty said.“How?” Josh whispered. “Magic? Telepathy?”“ASL: American Sign Language.”The twins glanced quickly at one another. “American Sign Language?” Josh asked.“He knows sign language? How?”“You seem to keep forgetting that he’s lived a long time,” Scathach said with agrin that showed her vampire teeth. “And he did help create French sign languagein the eighteenth century,” she added casually.“What’s he saying?” Sophie asked impatiently. Nowhere in the witch’s memorycould she find the knowledge necessary to translate the older man’s gestures.Scathach frowned, her lips moving as she spelled out a word. “Sophie…brouillard…fog,” she translated. She shook her head. “Sophie, he’s asking you for fog. Thatdoesn’t make sense.”“It does to me,” Sophie said as a dozen images of fog, clouds and smoke flashedthrough her brain. Niccolò Machiavelli paused on the steps and drew in a deep breath. “My peoplehave the entire area surrounded,” he said, moving slowly toward the Alchemyst.He was slightly out of breath and his heart was hammering; he really needed toget back to the gym.Creating the wax tulpa had exhausted him. He had never made one so big before,and never from the back of a car roaring through Montmartre’s narrow and windingstreets. It wasn’t an elegant solution, but all he had needed to do was to keepFlamel and his companions trapped in the church until he got there, and he hadsucceeded. Now the church was surrounded, more gendarmes were en route and hehad called in all available agents. As the head of the DGSE, his powers werealmost limitless, and he’d issued an order to impose a press blackout. He pridedhimself on having complete control of his emotions, but he had to admit thatright now he was feeling quite excited: soon he would have Nicholas Flamel,Scathach and the children in custody. He would have triumphed where Dee hadfailed.Later he would have someone in his department leak a story to the press thatthieves had been apprehended breaking into the national monument. Close todawn—just in time for the early-morning news—a second report would be leaked,revealing how the desperate prisoners had overpowered their guards and escapedon their way to the police station. They would never be seen again.“I have you now, Nicholas Flamel.”Flamel came to stand at the edge of the steps and pushed his hands into the backpockets of his worn black jeans. “I believe the last time you made thatstatement, you were just about to break into my tomb.”Machiavelli stopped in shock. “How do you know that?”More than three hundred years ago, in the dead of night, Machiavelli had crackedopen Nicholas and Perenelle’s tomb, looking for proof that the Alchemyst and hiswife were indeed dead and trying to determine whether they had been buried withthe Book of Abraham the Mage. The Italian hadn’t been entirely surprised to findthat both coffins were filled with stones.“Perry and I were right there behind you, standing in the shadows, close enoughto touch you when you lifted the top off our tomb. I knew someone would come…Ijust never imagined it would be you. I’ll admit I was disappointed, Niccolò,” headded.The white-haired man continued up the steps to Sacré-Coeur. “You always thoughtI was a better person than I was, Nicholas.”“I believe there is good in everyone,” Flamel whispered, “even you.”“Not me, Alchemyst, not anymore, and not for a very long time.” Machiavellistopped and indicated the police and heavily armed black-clad French specialforces gathering at the bottom of the steps. “Come now. Surrender. No harm willcome to you.”“I cannot tell you how many people have said that to me,” Nicholas said sadly.“And they were always lying,” he added.Machiavelli’s voice hardened. “You can deal with me or with Dr. Dee. And youknow the English Magician never had any patience.”“There is one other option,” Flamel said with a shrug. His thin lips curled in asmile. “I could deal with neither of you.” He half turned, but when he lookedback at Machiavelli, the expression on the Alchemyst’s face made the immortalItalian take a step back in shock. For an instant something ancient andimplacable shone through Flamel’s pale eyes, which flickered a brilliant emeraldgreen. Now it was Flamel’s voice that dropped to a whisper, still clearlyaudible to Machiavelli. “It would be better if you and I were never to meetagain.”Machiavelli attempted a laugh, but it came out sounding shaky. “That sounds likea threat…and believe me, you are in no position to issue threats.”“Not a threat,” Flamel said, and stepped back from the top steps. “A promise.”The cool damp Parisian night air was abruptly touched with the rich odor ofvanilla, and Niccolò Machiavelli knew then that something was very wrong. Standing straight, eyes closed, arms at her sides, palms facing outward, SophieNewman took a deep breath, attempting to calm her thundering heart and allow hermind to wander. When the Witch of Endor had wrapped her like a mummy withbandages of solidified air, she had imparted thousands of years of knowledgeinto the girl in a matter of heartbeats. Sophie had imagined she’d felt her headswelling as her brain filled with the Witch’s memories. Since then, her skullhad throbbed with a headache, the base of her neck felt stiff and tight andthere was a dull ache behind her eyes. Two days ago she had been an ordinaryAmerican teenager, her head filled with normal everyday things: homework andschool projects, the latest songs and videos, boys she liked, cell phone numbersand Web addresses, blogs and urls.Now she knew things that no person should ever know.Sophie Newman possessed the Witch of Endor’s memories; she knew all that theWitch had seen, everything she had done over millennia. It was all a jumble: amixture of thoughts and wishes, observations, fears and desires, a confusingmess of bizarre sights, terrifying images and incomprehensible sounds. It was asif a thousand movies had been mixed up and edited together. And scatteredthroughout the tangle of memories were countless incidences when the Witch hadactually used her special power, the Magic of Air. All Sophie had to do was finda time when the Witch had used fog.But when and where and how to find it?Ignoring Flamel’s voice calling down to Machiavelli, blanking out the sour smellof her brother’s fear and the jingle of Scathach’s swords, Sophie concentratedher thoughts on mist and fog.San Francisco was often wrapped in fog, and she’d seen the Golden Gate Bridgerising out of a thick layer of cloud. And only last fall, when the family hadbeen in St. Paul’s Cathedral in Boston, they’d stepped out onto Tremont Streetto find that a damp fog had completely obscured the Common. Other memories beganto intrude: mist in Glasgow; swirling damp fog in Vienna; thick foul-smellingyellow smog in London.Sophie frowned; she had never been to Glasgow, Vienna or London. But the Witchhad…and these were the Witch of Endor’s memories.Images, thoughts and memories—like the strands of fog she was seeing in herhead—shifted and twisted. And then they suddenly cleared. Sophie clearlyremembered standing alongside a figure dressed in the formal clothing of thenineteenth century. She could see him in her mind’s eye, a man with a long noseand a high forehead topped with graying curly hair. He was sitting at a highdesk, a thick sheaf of cream-colored paper before him, dipping a simple pen intoa brimming inkwell. It took her a moment to realize that this was not one of herown memories, nor was it something she had seen on TV or in a movie. She wasremembering something the Witch of Endor had done and seen. As she turned tolook closely at the figure, the Witch’s memories flooded her: the man was afamous English writer and was just about to begin work on a new book. The writerglanced up and smiled at her; then his lips moved, but there was no sound.Leaning over his shoulder, she saw him write the words Fog everywhere. Fog upthe river. Fog down the river in an elegant curling script. Outside the writer’sstudy window, fog, thick and opaque, rolled like smoke against the dirty glass,blotting out the background in an impenetrable blanket.And beneath the portico of Sacré-Coeur in Paris, the air turned chill and moist,rich with the odor of vanilla ice cream. A trickle of white dribbled from eachof Sophie’s outstretched fingers. The wispy streams curled down to puddle at herfeet. Behind her closed eyes, she watched the writer dip his pen into theinkwell and continue. Fog creeping…fog lying…fog drooping…fog in the eyes andthroats…Thick white fog spilled from Sophie’s fingers and spread across the stones,shifting like heavy smoke, flowing in twisting ropes and gossamer threads.Coiling and shifting, it flowed through Flamel’s legs and tumbled down thesteps, growing, thickening, darkening.image [images/Scot_9780375849084_epub_002_r1.jpg]Niccolò watched the fog flow down the steps of Sacré-Coeur like dirty milk,watched it condense and grow as it tumbled, and knew, in that moment, thatFlamel was going to elude him. By the time the fog reached him it was chesthigh, wet and vanilla scented. He breathed deeply, recognizing the odor ofmagic.“Remarkable,” he said, but the fog flattened his voice, dulling his carefullycultivated French accent, revealing the harsher Italian beneath.“Leave us alone,” Flamel’s voice boomed out of the fog.“That sounds like another threat, Nicholas. Believe me when I tell you that youhave no idea of the forces gathered against you now. Your parlor tricks will notsave you.” Machiavelli pulled out his cell phone and hit a speed dial number.“Attack. Attack now!” He raced up the steps as he spoke, moving silently onexpensive leather-soled shoes, while far below, booted feet thumped on stone asthe gathered police charged up the steps.“I’ve survived for a very long time.” Flamel’s voice didn’t come from whereMachiavelli expected it to, and he stopped, turning left and right, trying tomake out a shape in the fog.“The world moved on, Nicholas,” Machiavelli said. “You did not. You might haveescaped us in America, but here, in Europe, there are too many Elders, too manyimmortal humans who know you. You will not be able to remain hidden for long. Wewill find you.”Machiavelli dashed up the final few steps that brought him directly to theentrance of the church. There was no mist here. The unnatural fog started on thetop step and flowed downward, leaving the church floating like an island on acloudy sea. Even before he ran into the church, Machiavelli knew he would notfind them in there: Flamel, Scathach and the twins had escaped.For the moment.But Paris was no longer Nicholas Flamel’s city. The city that had once honoredFlamel and his wife as patrons of the sick and poor, the city that named streetsafter them, was long gone. Paris now belonged to Machiavelli and the Dark Eldershe served. Looking out over the ancient city, Niccolò Machiavelli swore that hewas going to turn Paris into a trap—and maybe even a tomb—for the legendaryAlchemyst."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVEThe ghosts of Alcatraz awoke Perenelle Flamel.The woman lay unmoving on the narrow cot in the cramped icy cell deep beneaththe abandoned prison and listened to them whisper and murmur in the shadowsaround her. There were a dozen languages she could understand, many more shecould identify and a few that were completely incomprehensible.Keeping her eyes closed, Perenelle concentrated on the languages, trying to makeout the individual voices, wondering if there were any she recognized. And thena sudden thought struck her: how was she able to hear the ghosts?Sitting outside the cell was a sphinx, a monster with a lion’s body, an eagle’swings and the head of a beautiful woman. One of its special powers was theability to absorb the magical energies of another living being. It had drainedPerenelle’s, rendering her helpless, trapping her in this terrible prison cell.A tiny smile curled Perenelle’s lips as she realized something: she was theseventh daughter of a seventh daughter; she had been born with the ability tohear and see ghosts. She had been doing so long before she had learned how totrain and concentrate her aura. Her gift had nothing to do with magic, andtherefore the sphinx had no power over it. Throughout the centuries of her longlife, she had used her skill with magic to protect herself from ghosts, to coatand shield her aura with colors that rendered her invisible to the apparitions.But as the sphinx had absorbed her energies, those shields had been wiped away,revealing her to the spirit realm.And now they were coming.Perenelle Flamel had seen her first ghost—that of her beloved grandmotherMamom—when she was seven years old. Perenelle knew that there was nothing tofear from ghosts; they could be annoying, certainly, were often irritating andsometimes downright rude, but they possessed no physical presence. There wereeven a few she had learned to call friends. Over the centuries certain spiritshad returned to her again and again, drawn to her because they knew she couldhear, see or help them—and often, Perenelle thought, simply because they werelonely. Mamom turned up every decade or so just to check up on her.But even though they had no presence in the real world, ghosts were notpowerless.Opening her eyes, Perenelle concentrated on the chipped stone wall directly infront of her face. The wall ran with green-tinged water that smelled of rust andsalt, the two elements that had ultimately destroyed Alcatraz the prison. Deehad made a mistake, as she had known he would. If Dr. John Dee had one greatfailing, it was arrogance. He obviously thought that if she was imprisoned deepbelow Alcatraz and guarded by a sphinx, then she was powerless. He could not bemore wrong.Alcatraz was a place of ghosts.And Perenelle Flamel would show him just how powerful she was.Closing her eyes, relaxing, Perenelle listened to the ghosts of Alcatraz, andthen slowly, her voice barely above a breathed whisper, she began to talk tothem, to call them and to gather them all to her."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX“I’m OK,” Sophie murmured sleepily, “really I am.”“You don’t look OK,” Josh muttered through gritted teeth. For the second time inas many days, Josh was carrying his sister in his arms, one arm under her back,the other beneath her legs. He moved cautiously down the steps of Sacré-Coeur,terrified he was going to drop his twin. “Flamel told us every time you usemagic it will steal a little of your energy,” he added. “You look exhausted.”“I’m fine…,” she muttered. “Let me down.” But then her eyes flickered closedonce more.The small group moved silently through the thick vanilla-scented fog, Scathachin the lead with Flamel taking up the rear. All around them they could hear thetramp of boots, the jingle of weapons, and the muted commands of the Frenchpolice and special forces as they climbed the steps. Some of them camedangerously close, and twice Josh was forced to crouch low as a uniformed figuredarted by.Scathach suddenly loomed up out of the thick fog, a short, stubby finger pressedto her lips. Water droplets frosted her spiky red hair, and her white skinlooked even paler than usual. She pointed to the right with her ornately carvednunchaku. The fog swirled and suddenly a gendarme was standing almost directlyin front of them, close enough to touch, his dark uniform sparkling with beadsof liquid. Behind him, Josh was able to make out a group of French policeclustered around what looked like an old-fashioned merry-go-round. They were allstaring upward, and Josh heard the word brouillard murmured again and again. Heknew that they were talking about the strange fog that had suddenly descendedover the church. The gendarme was holding his service pistol in his hand, thebarrel pointed skyward, but his finger was lightly curled over the trigger andJosh was once again reminded just how much danger they were in—not only fromFlamel’s nonhuman and inhuman enemies, but from his all-too-human foes as well.They walked perhaps another dozen steps…and suddenly the fog stopped. One momentJosh was carrying his sister through the thick mist; then, as if he had steppedthrough a curtain, he was standing in front of a tiny art gallery, a café and asouvenir shop. He turned to look behind him and found that he was facing a solidwall of mist. The police were little more than indistinct shapes in theyellow-white fog.Scathach and Flamel stepped out of the murk. “Allow me,” Scathach said, catchinghold of Sophie and lifting her from Josh’s arms. He tried to protest—Sophie washis twin, his responsibility—but he was exhausted. The backs of his calves werecramping, and the muscles in his arms burned with the effort of carrying hissister down what had felt like countless steps.Josh looked into Scathach’s bright green eyes. “She’s going to be OK?”The ancient Celtic warrior opened her mouth to reply, but Nicholas Flamel shookhis head, silencing her. He rested his left hand on Josh’s shoulder, but the boyshrugged it off. If Flamel noticed the gesture, he ignored it. “She just needsto sleep. The effort of raising the fog so soon after melting the tulpa hascompletely drained the last of her physical strength,” Flamel said.“You asked her to create fog,” Josh said quickly, accusingly.Nicholas spread his arms. “What else could I do?”“I…I don’t know,” Josh admitted. “There must have been something you could do.I’ve seen you throw spears of green energy.”“The fog allowed us to escape without harming anyone,” Flamel said.“Except Sophie,” Josh replied bitterly.Flamel looked at him for a long moment and then turned away. “Let’s go.” Henodded toward a side street that sloped sharply downward, and they hurried intothe night, Scathach effortlessly carrying Sophie, Josh struggling to keep up. Hewas not going to leave his sister’s side.“Where to?” Scathach asked.“We need to get off the streets,” Flamel murmured. “It looks like every gendarmein the city has descended on Sacré-Coeur. I also saw special forces andplainclothes police that I guess are secret service. Once they realize we’re notin the church, they’ll probably cordon off the area and do a street-by-streetsearch.”Scathach smiled quickly, her long incisors briefly visible against her lips.“And let’s face it: we’re not exactly inconspicuous.”“We need to find a place to—” Nicholas Flamel began.The police officer who came racing around the corner looked to be no more thannineteen—tall, thin and gangly—with bright red cheeks and the fuzzy beginningsof a mustache on his upper lip. One hand was on his holster; the other washolding on to his hat. He skidded to a halt directly in front of them andmanaged a quick yelp of surprise as he fumbled for the gun in its holster. “Hey!Arrêtez!”Nicholas lunged forward and Josh actually saw the green mist flow from theAlchemyst’s hand before his fingers brushed against the gendarme’s chest.Emerald light flared around the police officer’s body, outlining it in brilliantgreen, and then the man simply folded to the ground.“What did you do?” Josh asked in a horrified whisper. He looked at the youngpolice officer lying still, and was suddenly chilled and sickened. “Youdidn’t…you didn’t…kill him?”“No,” Flamel said tiredly. “Just overloaded his aura. Bit like an electricshock. He’ll awaken shortly with a headache.” He pressed his fingertips to hisforehead, massaging just over his left eye. “I hope it’ll not be as bad asmine,” he added.“You do know,” Scathach said grimly, “that your little display will have alertedMachiavelli to our position.” Her nostrils flared and Josh breathed deeply; theair around them stank of peppermint: the distinctive odor of Nicholas Flamel’spower.“What else could I do?” Nicholas protested. “You had your hands full.”Scatty curled her lips in disgust. “I could have taken him. Remember, who gotyou out of Lubyanka Prison with both hands manacled behind my back?”“What are you talking about? Where’s Lubyanka?” Josh asked, confused.“Moscow.” Nicholas glanced sidelong at Josh. “Don’t ask; it’s a long story,” hemurmured.“He was going to be shot as a spy,” Scathach said gleefully.“A very long story,” Flamel repeated.Following Scathach and Flamel through the winding streets of Montmartre, Joshthought back to how John Dee had described Nicholas Flamel to him only the daybefore.“He has been many things in his time: a physician and a cook, a bookseller, asoldier, a teacher of languages and chemistry, both an officer of the law and athief. But he is now, and has always been, a liar, a charlatan and a crook.”And a spy, Josh added. He wondered if Dee knew that. He peered at the ratherordinary-looking man: with his close-cropped hair and his pale eyes, in hisblack jeans and T-shirt under a battered black leather jacket, he would havepassed unnoticed on any street in any city in the world. And yet he was anythingbut ordinary: born in the year 1330, he claimed to be working for the good ofhumanity, by keeping the Codex away from Dee and the shadowy and terrifyingcreatures he served, the Dark Elders.But whom did Flamel serve? Josh wondered. Just who was the immortal NicholasFlamel?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENKeeping a tight rein on his temper, Niccolò Machiavelli strode down the steps ofSacré-Coeur, the fog curling and swirling behind him like a cloak. Although theair was beginning to clear, it was still touched with the odor of vanilla.Machiavelli threw his head back and breathed deeply, drawing the smell into hisnostrils. He would remember this scent; it was as distinctive as a fingerprint.Everyone on the planet possessed an aura—the electrical field that surroundedthe human body—and when that electrical field was focused and directed, itinteracted with the user’s endorphin system and adrenal glands to produce adistinctive odor unique to that person: a signature scent. Machiavelli took afinal breath. He could almost taste the vanilla on the air, crisp, clear andpure: the scent of raw untrained power.And in that moment, Machiavelli knew beyond a doubt that Dee was correct: thiswas the odor of one of the legendary twins.“I want the entire area sealed off,” Machiavelli snapped to the semicircle ofhigh-ranking police who had gathered at the bottom of the steps in the SquareWillette. “Cordon off every street, alleyway and lane from the Rue Custine tothe Rue Caulaincourt, from the Boulevard de Clichy to the Boulevard deRochechouart and the Rue de Clignancourt. I want these people found!”“You are suggesting closing down Montmartre,” a deeply tanned police officersaid in the silence that followed. He looked to his colleagues for support, butnone of them would meet his eye. “It’s the height of the tourist season,” heprotested, turning back to Machiavelli.Machiavelli rounded on the captain, his face as impassive as the masks hecollected. His cold gray eyes bored into the man, but when he spoke his voicewas even and controlled, barely above a whisper. “You know who I am?” he askedmildly.The captain, a decorated veteran of the French Foreign Legion, felt somethingcold and sour at the back of his throat as he looked into the man’s stony eyes.Licking suddenly dry lips, he said, “You are Monsieur Machiavelli, the new headof the Direction Générale de la Sécurité Extérieure. But this is a policematter, sir, not an external security matter. You have no authority—”“I am making this a DGSE matter,” Machiavelli interrupted softly. “My powerscome directly from the president. I will shut down this entire city ifnecessary. I want these people found. Tonight, a catastrophe was averted.” Hewaved his hand vaguely in the direction of Sacré-Coeur, now beginning to appearout of the thinning mist. “Who knows what other terrors they have planned? Iwant a progress report on the hour, every hour,” he finished, and withoutwaiting for a response turned and marched over to his car, where his dark-suiteddriver waited, arms folded across his massive chest. The driver, face halfhidden behind wraparound mirrored sunglasses, opened the door and then closed itgently behind Machiavelli. After he had climbed into the car, the driver satpatiently, black gloved hands resting lightly on the leather steering wheel, andawaited instructions. The sheet of privacy glass that separated the driver’ssection from the back of the car buzzed down.“Flamel is in Paris. Where would he go?” Machiavelli asked without preamble.The creature known as Dagon had served Machiavelli for close to four hundredyears. It was the name by which he had been known for millennia, and despite hisappearance, he had never been even remotely human. Turning in the seat, hepulled off his mirrored sunglasses. In the dim car interior, his eyes werebulbous and fishlike, huge and liquid behind a clear, glassy film: he had noeyelids. When he spoke, two rows of tiny ragged teeth were visible behind histhin lips. “Who are his allies?” Dagon asked, shifting from deplorable French toappalling Italian before dropping back to the bubbling, liquid language of hislong-lost youth.“Flamel and his wife have always been loners,” Machiavelli said. “That is whythey have survived for so long. To the best of my knowledge, they have not livedin this city since the end of the eighteenth century.” He pulled out his slenderblack laptop and ran his index finger over the integrated fingerprint reader.The machine blipped and the screen blinked to life.“If they came through a leygate, then they came unprepared,” Dagon said wetly.“No money, no passports, no clothes other than those they were wearing.”“Exactly,” Machiavelli whispered. “So they’re going to need to find themselvesan ally.”“Humani or immortal?” Dagon asked.Machiavelli took a moment to consider. “An immortal,” he said finally. “I’m notsure they know many humani in this city.”“So which immortals are currently living in Paris?” Dagon asked.The Italian’s fingers hit a complicated series of keystrokes and the screenscrolled to reveal a directory called Temp. There were dozens of .jpg, .bmp and.tmp files in the directory. Machiavelli highlighted one and hit Enter. A boxappeared in the center of the screen.Enter Password.His slender fingers clicked across the keyboard as he typed in the password Delmodo di trattare i sudditi della Val di Chiana ribellati, and a database encodedwith unbreakable 256-bit AES encryption, the same encryption used by mostgovernments for their top-secret files, blinked open. Over the course of hislong life, Niccolò Machiavelli had amassed a huge fortune, but he consideredthis single file to be his most valuable treasure. It was a complete dossier onevery immortal human still living in the twenty-first century, compiled by hisnetwork of spies across the globe—most of whom didn’t even know they wereworking for him. He scrolled through the names. Not even his own Dark Eldermasters knew he possessed this list, and he was sure some would be very unhappyif they were to discover that he also knew the locations and attributes ofalmost all the Elders and Dark Elders still walking the earth or in theShadowrealms that bordered this world.Knowledge, as Machiavelli well knew, was power.Although there were three screens devoted to Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel, hardinformation was scarce. There were hundreds of entries, each one a reportedsighting of the Flamels since their supposed deaths in 1418. They had been seenon just about every continent in the world—except Australia. For the past 150years, they had lived on the North American continent, with the first confirmedand verified sighting of the last century taking place in Buffalo, New York, inSeptember 1901. He skipped to the section marked Known Immortal Associates. Itwas blank.“Nothing. I have no records of the Flamels’ associating with other immortals.”“But now he is back in Paris,” Dagon said, bubbles of liquid forming on his lipsas he spoke. “He will seek out old friends. People behave differently at home,”he added; “their guard comes down. And no matter how long Flamel has lived awayfrom this city, he will still consider it his home.”Niccolò Machiavelli looked over the top of the computer screen. He was remindedyet again of how little he knew about his faithful employee. “And where is yourhome, Dagon?” he asked.“Gone. Long gone.” A translucent skin flickered across the huge globes of hiseyes.“Why have you remained with me?” Machiavelli wondered aloud. “Why have you notsought out others of your kind?”“They too are gone. I am the last of my kind, and besides, you are not thatdissimilar to me.”“But you are not human,” Machiavelli said softly.“Are you?” Dagon asked, eyes wide and unblinking.Machiavelli took a long moment before finally nodding and returning to thescreen. “So we’re looking for someone the Flamels would have known when theywere still living here. And we know they haven’t been in the city since theeighteenth century, so let us limit our search to immortals who were aroundthen.” His fingers tapped the keys, filtering the results. “Seven only. Five areloyal to us.”“And the other two?”“Catherine de Medici is living off the Rue du Dragon.”“She’s not French,” Dagon mumbled stickily.“Well, she was the mother of three French kings,” Machiavelli said with a raresmile. “But she is loyal only to herself….” His voice trailed away and hestraightened. “But what do we have here?”Dagon remained unmoving.Niccolò Machiavelli swiveled the computer screen so that his servant could seethe photograph of a man staring directly at the camera in what was obviously aposed publicity shot. Thick curling black hair tumbled to his shoulders, framinga round face. His eyes were startlingly blue.“I do not know this man,” Dagon said.“Oh, but I do. I know him very well. This is the immortal human once known asthe Comte de Saint-Germain. He was a magician, an inventor, a musician…and analchemist.” Machiavelli closed the program and shut down the computer.“Saint-Germain was also the student of Nicholas Flamel. And he’s currentlyliving in Paris,” he finished triumphantly.Dagon smiled, his mouth a perfect O filled with razor teeth. “Does Flamel knowthat Saint-Germain is here?”“I have no idea. No one knows the extent of Nicholas Flamel’s knowledge.”Dagon pushed his sunglasses back in place. “And I thought you knew everything.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT“We need to rest,” Josh said finally. “I can’t go any farther.” He stopped andleaned against a building, bent over and wheezing. Every breath was an effort,and he was beginning to see black spots dancing in front of his eyes. Any momentnow he was going to throw up. He felt this way sometimes after footballpractice, and he knew from experience that he needed to sit and get some liquidsinto his system.“He’s right.” Scatty turned to Flamel. “We need to rest, even if only briefly.She was still carrying Sophie in her arms, and with gray glimmers of lightilluminating the Parisian rooftops toward the east, the first of theearly-morning workers had begun to appear. The fugitives had kept to the darkside streets, and so far no one had paid any attention to the strange group, butthat would quickly change as the street filled first with Parisians, then withtourists.Nicholas stood outlined at the mouth of the narrow street. He glanced up anddown before turning to look over his shoulder. “We have to push on,” heprotested. “Every second we delay brings Machiavelli closer to us.”“We can’t,” Scatty said. She looked at Flamel, and for a single instant, herbright green eyes glowed. “The twins need to rest,” she said, and then addedsoftly, “And so do you, Nicholas. You’re exhausted.”The Alchemyst considered her and then he nodded and his shoulders slumped.“You’re right, of course. I’ll do as you say.”“Maybe we could check into a hotel?” Josh suggested. He was achingly tired, hiseyes and throat gritty, head throbbing.Scatty shook her head. “They would ask for our passports….” Sophie stirred inher arms, and Scathach gently eased her to the ground and leaned her up againstthe wall.Josh was immediately by her side. “You’re awake,” he said, relief in his voice.“I wasn’t really asleep,” Sophie answered, her tongue feeling too big for hermouth. “I knew what was going on, but it was as if I was looking at it from theoutside. Like watching something on TV.” She pressed her hands into the small ofher back and pushed hard as she rotated her neck. “Ouch. That hurt.”“What hurts?” Josh asked immediately.“Everything.” She attempted to straighten, but aching muscles protested and asick headache pulsed behind her eyes.“Is there anyone here you can call for help?” Josh looked from Nicholas toScathach. “Are there any more immortals or Elders?”“There are immortals and Elders everywhere,” Scatty said. “Few are as friendlyas we are, though,” she added with a humorless smile.“There will be immortals in Paris,” Flamel agreed slowly, “but I’ve no ideawhere to find one, and even if I did, I would have no idea where theirallegiances lay. Perenelle would know,” he added, a hint of sadness in hisvoice.“Would your grandmother know?” Josh asked Scatty.The Warrior glanced at him. “I’m sure she would.” She turned to look at Sophie.“Amongst all of your new memories, can you recall anything about immortals orElders living in Paris?”Sophie closed her eyes and tried to concentrate, but the scenes and images thatflashed by—fire raining from a bloodred sky, a huge flat-topped pyramid about tobe overwhelmed by a gigantic wave—were chaotic and terrifying. She started toshake her head, then stopped. Even the simplest of movements hurt. “I can’tthink,” she sighed. “My head is so full, it feels like it’s going to burst.”“The Witch might know,” Flamel said, “but we have no way of getting in touchwith her. She has no phone.”“What about her neighbors, friends?” Josh asked. He turned back to his sister.“I know you don’t want to think about this, but you have to. It’s important.”“I can’t think…,” Sophie began, looking away and shaking her head.“Don’t think. Just answer,” Josh snapped. He took a quick breath and lowered hisvoice, speaking slowly. “Sis, who is the Witch of Endor’s closest friend inOjai?”Sophie’s bright blue eyes closed again and she swayed as if she was about tofaint. When her eyes opened, she shook her head. “She has no friends there. Buteveryone knows her. Maybe we could call the store next to hers…,” she suggested.Then she shook her head. “It’s too late there.”Flamel nodded. “Sophie’s right; it’ll be closed at this time of night.”“It’ll be closed, all right,” Josh agreed, a touch of excitement entering hisvoice, “but when we left Ojai, the place was in chaos. And don’t forget, I drovea Hummer into the fountain in Libbey Park; that had to have caught someone’sattention. I’ll bet the police and the press are there right now. And the pressmight answer some questions if we ask the right ones. I mean, if the Witch’sshop was damaged they’re sure to be looking for a story.”“It might work…,” Flamel began. “I just need to know the name of the newspaper.”“Ojai Valley News, 646-1476,” Sophie said immediately. “I remember that much…orthe Witch does,” she added, and then shuddered. There were so many memories inher head, so many thoughts and ideas…and not just the terrifying and fantasticimages of people and places that should never have existed, but also ordinarymundane thoughts: phone numbers and recipes, names and addresses of people she’dnever heard of, pictures from old TV shows, posters from movies. She even knewthe name of every single Elvis Presley song.But all of these were the Witch’s memories. And right now, she had to struggleto remember her own cell phone number. What would happen if the Witch’s memoriesgrew so strong that they overwhelmed her own? She tried to focus on the faces ofher parents, Richard and Sara. Hundreds of faces flickered past, images offigures carved in stone, the heads of giant statues, paintings daubed onto thesides of buildings, tiny shapes etched in shards of pottery. Sophie started toget frantic. Why couldn’t she remember her parents’ faces? Closing her eyes, sheconcentrated hard on the last time she had seen her mother and father. It wouldhave been about three weeks ago, just before they had left for the dig in Utah.More faces tumbled behind Sophie’s closed eyes: images on scraps of parchment,fragments of manuscripts or cracked oil paintings; faces in faded sepiaphotographs, in blurred newspapers…“Sophie?”And then, in a flash of color, the faces of her parents popped into her head,and Sophie felt the Witch’s memories fade away and her own come back to thesurface. She suddenly knew her own phone number.“Sis?”She opened her eyes and blinked at her brother. He was standing directly infront of her, his face close to hers, his eyes pinched with concern.“I’m OK,” she whispered. “I was just trying to remember something.”“What?”She attempted a smile. “My phone number.”“Your phone number? Why?” He stopped, and then added, “No one ever rememberstheir own phone number. When was the last time you called yourself?” Hands wrapped around steaming mugs of bittersweet hot chocolate, Sophie and Joshsat opposite one another in an otherwise empty all-night café close to the Garedu Nord Metro station. There was only one staff member behind the counter, asurly shaven-headed assistant wearing an upside-down name tag that said ROUX.“I need a shower,” Sophie said grimly. “I need to wash my hair and brush myteeth, and I need to change my clothes. It feels like days since my lastshower.”“I think it is days. You look terrible,” Josh agreed. He reached over and pulledloose a strand of blond hair that had stuck to his sister’s cheek.“I feel terrible,” Sophie whispered. “Remember that time last summer when wewere in Long Beach and I had all that ice cream, then ate the chili dog and thecurly fries and had the extra-large root beer?”Josh grinned. “And you finished off my buffalo wings. And my ice cream!”Sophie smiled at the memory, but her grin quickly faded. Although thetemperature that day had risen into the hundreds, she’d started shivering, icybeads of sweat running down her back as a ball of iron settled into the pit ofher stomach. Luckily, she hadn’t fastened her seat belt before she’d thrown up,but the results had still been spectacularly messy, and the car had beenunusable for at least a week afterward. “That’s how I feel right now: cold,shivery, aching all over.”“Well, try not to throw up in here,” Josh murmured. “I don’t think Roux, ourcheerful server, would be too impressed.” Roux had worked in the café for four years, and in that time he had been robbedtwice and threatened often but never hurt. The all-night café saw all sorts ofstrange and often dangerous characters come through the doors, and Roux decidedthat this unusual quartet certainly qualified as the first sort and maybe evenboth. The two teenagers were dirty and smelly and looked terrified andexhausted. The older man—maybe the kids’ grandfather, Roux thought—was not inmuch better shape. Only the fourth member of the group—the red-haired,green-eyed young woman wearing a black top, black trousers and chunky combatboots—looked bright and alert. He wondered what her relationship was to theothers; she certainly didn’t look as if she was related to any of them, but theboy and girl were alike enough to be twins.Roux had hesitated when the old man had produced a credit card to pay for thetwo hot chocolates. People usually paid cash for something so small, and hewondered if the card was stolen. “I’ve run out of euros,” the old man said witha smile. “Could you ring up twenty and give me some cash?” Roux thought he spokeFrench with a peculiar, old-fashioned, almost formal lilt.“It is strictly against our policy…,” Roux began, but another look at thehard-eyed red-haired girl made him reconsider. He attempted a smile at her as hesaid, “Sure, I think I can do that.” If the card had been reported stolen, itwouldn’t scan in the machine anyway.“I would be very grateful.” The man smiled. “And could you give me some coins?”Roux rang up eight euro for the two hot chocolates and swiped the Visa fortwenty euro. He was surprised that it was an American credit card; he would havesworn by his accent that the man was French. There was a delay and then the cardwent through, and he deducted the cost of the two drinks and handed over thechange in one- and two-euro coins. Roux went back to the math textbook hiddenunder the counter. He’d been wrong about the group. It wasn’t the first time andwouldn’t be the last. They were probably visitors just off one of theearly-morning trains; they were nothing out of the ordinary.Well, maybe not all of them. Keeping his head down, he raised his eyes to lookat the red-haired young woman. She was standing with her back to him, talking tothe old man. And then she slowly and deliberately turned to look at him. Shesmiled, the merest curl of her lips, and Roux suddenly found his textbook veryinteresting. Flamel stood at the café counter and looked at Scathach. “I want you to stayhere,” he said softly, slipping from French into Latin. His eyes flickered towhere the twins sat drinking their hot chocolate. “Watch over them. I’ll go finda phone.”The Shadow nodded. “Be careful. If anything happens and we get separated, let’smeet back in Montmartre. Machiavelli will never expect us to double back. We’llwait outside one of the restaurants—maybe La Maison Rose—for five minutes at thetop of every hour.”“Agreed. But if I’m not back by noon,” he continued very softly, “I want you totake the twins and leave.”“I will not abandon you,” Scathach said evenly.“If I don’t come back, it’s because Machiavelli has me,” the Alchemyst saidseriously. “Scathach, even you would not be able to rescue me from his army.”“I’ve faced down armies before.”Flamel reached out and laid his hand on the Warrior’s shoulder. “The twins areour priority now. They must be protected at all cost. Continue Sophie’straining; find someone to Awaken Josh and train him. And rescue my dearPerenelle, if you can. And if I die, tell her my ghost will find her,” he added.Then, before she could say anything else, he turned and strode out into thechilly predawn air.“Hurry back…,” Scatty whispered, but Flamel had gone. If he was captured, shedecided, no matter what he said, she was going to tear this city apart until shefound him. Taking a deep breath, she looked over her shoulder and found theshaven-headed assistant staring at her. There was a spiderweb tattooed onto theside of his neck, and the entire length of both of his ears was pierced with atleast a dozen little studs. She wondered how painful that had been. She’d alwayswanted pierced ears, but her flesh simply healed too quickly, and she’d nosooner had the piercing done than the hole closed up.“Something to drink?” Roux asked, smiling nervously, a metal ball visible in histongue.“Water,” Scatty said.“Sure. Perrier?”“Tap. No ice,” she added, and turned away to join the twins at the table. Shespun a chair around and straddled it, leaning her forearms across the top of thechair and resting her chin on her arms.“Nicholas has gone to try and get in touch with my grandmother to see if sheknows anyone here. I’m not sure what we’re going to do if he cannot getthrough.”“Why?” Sophie asked.Scatty shook her head. “We’ve got to get off the streets. We were lucky to getaway from Sacré-Coeur before the police threw up a cordon around it. No doubtthey have found that stunned officer by now, so their search will have movedoutward, and the patrols will have our descriptions. It’s only a matter of timebefore we’re spotted.”“What will happen then?” Josh wondered aloud.Scathach’s smile was terrifying. “Then they’ll see why I am called the Warrior.”“But what happens if we’re caught?” Josh persisted. He still found the idea ofbeing hunted by the police nearly incomprehensible. It was almost easier toimagine being hunted by mythical creatures or immortal humans. “What wouldhappen to us?”“You would be turned over to Machiavelli. The Dark Elders would consider youpair quite a prize.”“What…” Sophie looked quickly at her brother. “What would they do to us?”“You really don’t want to know,” Scathach said sincerely, “but trust me when Itell you that it would not be pleasant.”“And what about you?” Josh asked.“I have no friends amongst the Dark Elders,” Scathach said softly. “I’ve beentheir enemy for over two and a half thousand years. I would imagine they have avery special Shadowrealm prison prepared for me. Something cold and wet. Theyknow I hate that.” She smiled, the tips of her teeth pressing against her lips.“But they haven’t got us yet,” she said lightly, “and they’ll not get useasily.” She turned to squint at Sophie. “You look terrible.”“So I’ve been told,” Sophie said, wrapping both hands around the steaming mug ofchocolate and bringing it to her lips. She breathed deeply. She could smellevery subtlety in the rich aroma of cocoa and felt her stomach rumble, remindingher that it had been a long time since they had eaten. The hot chocolate tastedbitter on her tongue, eye-wateringly strong, and she remembered readingsomewhere that European chocolate had a greater cocoa content than the Americanchocolate she had grown up with.Scatty leaned forward and dropped her voice. “You need to give yourselves timeto recuperate from all the stresses you’ve been through. Traveling from one sideof the world to the other via a leygate takes its toll—it feels like massive jetlag, I’m told.”“And I guess you don’t get jet lag?” Josh muttered. There was a joke in thefamily that he could get jet lag on a car trip from one state to the next.Scatty shook her head. “No, I don’t get jet lag. I don’t fly,” she explained.“You’d never get me up in one of those things. Only creatures with flappingwings are meant to be in the skies. Though I did ride a lung once.”“A lung?” Josh asked, confused.“Ying lung, a Chinese dragon,” Sophie said.Scathach turned to look at the girl. “Calling up the fog must have burnedthrough a lot of your aura’s energy. It’s important that you not use your poweragain for as long as possible.”The trio sat back as Roux came out from behind the counter with a tall glass ofwater. He placed it on the edge of the table, attempted a nervous smile atScatty and then backed away.“I think he likes you,” Sophie said with a weak grin.Scatty turned to glare at the assistant again, but the twins saw her lips twistin a smile. “He’s got piercings,” she said, loud enough for him to hear. “Idon’t like boys with piercings.”Both girls smiled as the back of Roux’s neck flared bright red.“Why is it important that Sophie not use her powers?” Josh asked, bringing theconversation back to Scatty’s earlier comment. An alarm had gone off at the backof his mind.Scathach leaned forward across the table, and both Sophie and Josh moved in tohear her. “Once a person uses all their natural auric energy, then the powerstarts to feed off their flesh for its fuel.”“What happens then?” Sophie asked.“Have you ever heard of spontaneous human combustion?”Sophie’s expression was blank, but Josh nodded. “I have. People just burstinginto flames for no reason: it’s an urban legend.”Scatty shook her head. “It’s no legend. Many cases have been recorded throughouthistory,” she said evenly. “I’ve even witnessed a couple myself. It can happenin a heartbeat, and the fire, which usually starts in the stomach and lungs,burns so fiercely that it leaves little more than ash behind. You have to becareful now, Sophie: in fact, I’d like you to promise me not to use your poweragain today, no matter what happens.”“And Flamel knew this,” Josh said quickly, unable to keep the anger from hisvoice.“Of course,” Scatty said evenly.“And he didn’t think it was worth telling us?” Josh snapped. Roux looked over atthe raised voice, and Josh took a deep breath and continued in a hoarse whisper.“What else isn’t he telling us?” he demanded. “What else comes with this gift?”He almost spat out the last word.“Everything has happened so fast, Josh,” Scatty said. “There simply hasn’t beentime to train or instruct you properly. But I want you to remember that Nicholashas your best interests at heart. He is trying to keep you safe.”“We were safe until we met him,” Josh said.The skin tightened across Scatty’s cheekbones and the muscles in her neck andshoulders twitched. Something dark and ugly flickered behind her green eyes.Sophie reached out and put a hand on both Scatty’s and Josh’s arms. “Enough,”she said tiredly. “We shouldn’t fight with each other.”Josh was about to respond, but the look on his sister’s exhausted face scaredhim, and he nodded. “OK. For now,” he added.Scatty nodded too. “Sophie is correct.” She turned to look at Josh. “It isunfortunate that everything has fallen on Sophie at the moment. It’s a pity yourpowers weren’t Awakened.”“You’re not half as sorry as I am,” he said, unable to keep the note ofbitterness from his voice. Despite all that he had seen, and even knowing thedangers, he wanted the powers his twin had. “It’s not too late, though, is it?”he asked quickly.Scatty shook her head. “You can be Awakened at any time, but I don’t know whowould have the power to Awaken you. It needs to be done by an Elder, and thereare only a handful with that particular skill.”“Like who?” he demanded, looking at Scathach, but it was his sister whoanswered, dreamily.“In America, Black Annis or Persephone could do it.”Josh and Scatty turned to look at her.Sophie blinked in surprise. “I know the names, but I don’t even know who theyare.” Suddenly, her eyes filled with tears. “I have all these memories…thataren’t even mine.”Josh took his sister’s hand and squeezed it gently.“They are all the Witch of Endor’s memories,” Scathach said softly. “And be gladyou don’t know who Black Annis or Persephone is. Especially Black Annis,” sheadded grimly. “I’m surprised that if my grandmother knew where she was, she lether live.”“She’s in the Catskills,” Sophie began, but Scathach reached over and pinchedthe back of her hand. “Ouch!”“I just wanted to distract you,” Scathach explained. “Don’t even think aboutBlack Annis. There are some names that should never be spoken aloud.”“That’s like saying don’t think of elephants,” Josh said, “and then all you canthink of are elephants.”“Then let me give you something else to think about,” Scathach said softly.“There are two police officers in the window staring at us. Don’t look,” sheadded urgently.Too late. Josh turned to look, and whatever expression crossed his face—shock,horror, guilt or fear—brought both officers racing into the café, one pullinghis automatic from its holster, the other speaking urgently into his radio as hedrew his baton."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINEWith hands pushed deep in the pockets of his leather jacket, still wearing hisnone-too-clean black jeans and scuffed cowboy boots, Nicholas Flamel didn’t lookout of place with either the early-morning workers or the homeless beginning toappear on the streets of Paris. The gendarmes gathered in small groups on thecorners were talking urgently together or listening to their radios and didn’teven give him a second glance.This wasn’t the first time he had been hunted in these streets, but it was thefirst time without allies and friends to help him. He and Perenelle had returnedto their home city at the end of the Seven Years’ War in 1763. An old friendneeded their help, and the Flamels never refused a friend. Unfortunately,however, Dee had discovered their whereabouts and had chased them through thestreets with an army of black-clad assassins, none of whom was entirely human.They had escaped then. Escaping now might not be so easy. Paris had changedutterly. When Baron Haussmann had redesigned Paris in the nineteenth century, hehad destroyed a huge portion of the medieval section of the city, the cityFlamel was so familiar with. All the Alchemyst’s hiding places and safe houses,the secret vaults and hidden attics, were gone. He had once known every streetand alley, each twisting lane and hidden courtyard of Paris; now he knew as muchas the average tourist.And at that moment, not only did he have Machiavelli chasing them, the entireFrench police force was also on the lookout for them. And Dee was on his way.Dee, as Flamel well knew, was capable of just about anything.Nicholas breathed in the cool predawn Parisian air and glanced at the cheapdigital watch he wore on his left wrist. It was still set to Pacific time, whereit was now twenty minutes past eight in the evening, which meant—he did a quickcalculation in his head—that it was five-twenty a.m. in Paris. He thoughtbriefly about resetting the watch to Greenwich Mean Time, but quickly decidedagainst it. A couple of months ago, when he’d tried resetting the watch fordaylight savings, it had started madly blipping and flashing. He’d worked on itfor over an hour without any success; it had taken Perenelle thirty seconds tofix it. He only wore it because it came with a countdown timer. Every month,when he and Perenelle created a new batch of the immortality potion, he resetthe counter to 720 hours and allowed it to count down to zero. With the passingof years, they had discovered that the potion was timed to a lunar cycle andlasted roughly thirty days. Over the course of the month, they would age slowly,almost imperceptibly, but once they drank the potion, the effects of the agingprocess would quickly reverse—hair would darken, wrinkles soften and disappear,aching joints and stiff muscles become supple again, eyesight and hearingsharpen.Unfortunately, it was not a recipe that could be copied down; each month theformula was unique, and each recipe only worked once. The Book of Abraham theMage was written in a language that predated humanity, and in an ever-changing,always-moving script, so that entire libraries of knowledge were held within theslender volume. But every month, on page seven of the copper-bound manuscript,the secret of Life Eternal appeared. The crawling script remained static forless then an hour before it shifted, twisted and trickled away.The one and only time the Flamels had tried using the same recipe twice, it hadactually sped up the aging process. Luckily, Nicholas had taken only a sip ofthe colorless, rather ordinary-looking potion when Perenelle noticed that lineswere appearing around his eyes and on his forehead and that the hair from hisfull beard was falling away from his face. She’d knocked the cup from his handbefore he’d taken another mouthful. However, the lines remained etched on hisface, and the thick beard he had been so proud of had never grown again.Nicholas and Perenelle had brewed the most recent batch of the potion atmidnight the past Sunday, just under a week ago. He pressed the left-hand buttonon the watch and called up the stopwatch function: 116 hours and 21 minutes hadpassed. Another press of the button brought up the time remaining: 603 hours, 39minutes, or about 25 days. As he watched, another minute ticked away: 38minutes. He and Perenelle would age and weaken, and of course, every time eitherof them used their powers, that would only quicken the onset of old age. If hedid not retrieve the Book before the end of the month and create a new batch ofthe potion, then they would both rapidly age and die.And the world would die with them.Unless…A police car roared past, siren howling. It was followed by a second and athird. Like everyone else on the street, Flamel turned to follow their progress.The last thing he needed to do was to attract attention to himself by standingout from the crowd.He had to retrieve the Codex. The rest of the Codex, he reminded himself, hishand absently touching his chest. Hidden beneath his T-shirt, dangling on aleather cord, he wore a simple square cotton bag that Perenelle had stitched forhim half a millennium ago, when he had first found the Book. She had created itto hold the ancient volume; now all it contained were two pages Josh had managedto tear out. The book was still incredibly dangerous in the hands of Dee, but itwas the last two pages, which contained the spell known as the Final Summoning,that Dee needed to bring his Dark Elder masters back to this world.And Flamel would not—could not—allow that.Two police officers turned a corner and strolled down the center of the street.They stared hard at some of the pedestrians and peered into the shop windows,but they walked past Nicholas without even looking at him.Nicholas knew that his priority now was to find a safe haven for the twins. Andthat meant he had to find an immortal living in Paris. Every city in the worldhad its share of humans with life spans that extended into centuries or evenmillennia, and Paris was no exception. He knew that immortals liked the biganonymous cities, where it was easier to disappear amongst an ever-changingpopulation.Long ago, Nicholas and Perenelle had come to realize that at the heart of everymyth and legend was a grain of truth. And every race told stories of people wholived exceptionally long lives: the immortals.Over the centuries, the Flamels had come into contact with three entirelydifferent types of immortal humans. There were the Ancients—of whom there werenow perhaps no more than a handful still alive—who hailed from earth’s verydistant past. Some had witnessed the entire span of human history, and it hadmade them more, and less, than human.Then there were a few others who, like Nicholas and Perenelle, had discoveredfor themselves how to become immortal. Down through the millennia, the secretsof alchemy had been discovered, lost and rediscovered countless times. One ofthe greatest secrets of alchemy was the formula for immortality. And allalchemy—and possibly even modern science—had one single source: the Book ofAbraham the Mage.Then there were those who had been given the gift of immortality. These werehumans who had, either accidentally or deliberately, come to the attention ofone or other of the Elders who had remained in this world after the Fall of DanuTalis. The Elders were always on the lookout for people of exceptional orunusual ability to recruit to their cause. And in return for their service, theElders granted their followers extended life. It was a gift very few humanscould refuse. It was also a gift that ensured absolute, unswervingloyalty…because it could be withdrawn as quickly as it had been given. Nicholasknew that if he encountered immortals in Paris—even if he had known them in thepast—there would now be a very real danger that they were in the service of theDark Elders.He was passing an all-night video store that advertised high-speed Internet whenhe noticed the sign in the window, written in ten languages: NATIONAL &INTERNATIONAL CALLS. CHEAPEST RATES. Pushing open the door, he suddenly breathedin the sour odor of unwashed bodies, stale perfume, greasy food and the ozone oftoo many computers packed tightly together. The store was surprisingly busy: agroup of students who looked like they’d been up all night clustered aroundthree computers displaying the World of Warcraft logo, while most of the othermachines were taken up by serious-faced young men and women staring intently atthe screens. As he made his way to the counter at the back of the shop, Nicholascould see that most of the young people were e-mailing and instant-messaging. Hesmiled briefly; only a few days ago, on Monday afternoon, when the bookshop wasquiet, Josh had spent an hour explaining to him the difference between the twomethods of communication. Josh had even set him up with his own e-mailaccount—which Nicholas doubted he would ever use—though he could see a use forthe instant-messaging programs.The Chinese girl behind the counter was dressed in ragged and torn clothes thatNicholas thought looked fit only for the trash but that he guessed had probablycost a fortune. She was in full goth makeup and was busy painting her nails whenNicholas stepped up to the desk.“Three euro for fifteen minutes, five for thirty, seven for forty-five, ten foran hour,” she rattled off in atrocious French without looking up.“I want to make an international call.”“Cash or credit card?” She still hadn’t raised her head, and Nicholas noticedthat she was blackening her nails not with polish but with a felt-tip marker.“Credit card.” He wanted to conserve the little cash he had to buy some food.Although he rarely ate, and Scathach never ate, he would need to feed thechildren.“Use booth number one. Instructions are on the wall.”Nicholas slipped into the glass-fronted booth and pulled the door closed behindhim. The shouts of the students faded, but the booth smelled strongly of stalefood. He quickly read the instructions as he fished the credit card he’d used tobuy hot chocolate for the twins from the back of his wallet. It was in the nameof Nick Fleming, the name he’d been using for the past ten years, and he brieflywondered whether Dee or Machiavelli had the resources to track him through it.He knew that of course they did, but a quick smile curled Flamel’s thin lips;what did it matter? All it would tell them was that he was in Paris, and theyalready knew that. Following the instructions on the wall, he dialed theinternational access code and then the number Sophie had recalled from the Witchof Endor’s memories.The line crackled and clicked with transatlantic static, and then, more thanfive and a half thousand miles away, the phone started ringing. It was answeredon the second ring. “Ojai Valley News; how can I help?” The young woman’s voicewas surprisingly clear.Nicholas deliberately affected a thick French accent. “Good morning…or rather,good evening to you. I’m delighted to find you still at the office. This isMonsieur Montmorency, phoning you from Paris, France. I’m a reporter with LeMonde newspaper. I’ve just seen online that you’ve had quite an exciting eveningthere.”“Gosh—news does travel fast, Mr….”“Montmorency.”“Montmorency. Yes, we’ve had quite an evening. How can we help?”“We would like to include a piece in this evening’s paper—I was wondering if youhad a reporter on the scene?”“Actually, all our reporters are downtown at the moment.”“Would it be possible to put me through, do you think? I can get a quickon-the-spot description of the scene and a comment.” When there was no immediateresponse, he added quickly, “There would be a proper credit for your newspaper,of course.”“Let me see if I can patch you through to one of our reporters on the street,Mr. Montmorency.”“Merci. I am very grateful.”The line clicked again, and there was a long pause. Nicholas guessed that thereceptionist was talking to the reporter before transferring the call. There wasanother click, and the girl said, “Putting you through….” He was saying thankyou when the phone was answered.“Michael Carroll, Ojai Valley News. I understand you’re calling from Paris,France?” There was a note of incredulity in the man’s voice.“Indeed I am, Monsieur Carroll.”“News travels fast,” the reporter said, echoing the receptionist.“The Internet,” Flamel said vaguely, adding, “There’s a video on YouTube.” Hehad absolutely no doubt that there were videos of the scene in Ojai online. Heturned to stare out into the Internet café. From where he was standing he couldsee half a dozen screens; each one displayed a Web page in a different language.“I’ve been asked to get a quote for our arts and culture page. One of oureditors has visited your beautiful city often and bought several amazing glasspieces from an antiques shop on Ojai Avenue. I’m not sure if you know it: theshop sells only mirrors and glassware,” Flamel added.“Witcherly Antiques,” Michael Carroll said immediately. “I know it well. I’mafraid it was completely destroyed in an explosion.”Flamel felt suddenly breathless. Hekate had died because he had brought thetwins into her Shadowrealm; had the Witch of Endor shared Hekate’s fate? Hecleared his throat and swallowed hard. “And the owner, Mrs. Witcherly? Is she…?”“She’s fine,” the reporter said, and Flamel felt a wave of relief wash over him.“I’ve just taken a statement from her. She’s in remarkably good spirits forsomeone whose shop has just blown up.” He laughed and added, “She said that whenyou’ve lived as long as she has, nothing much surprises you.”“Is she still there?” Flamel asked, trying to contain the eagerness is hisvoice. “Would she like to make a statement for the French press? Tell her it’sNicholas Montmorency. We spoke once before; I’m sure she’ll remember me,” headded.“I’ll ask….”The voice faded away and Flamel heard the reporter calling out for DoraWitcherly. In the background, he also heard the sound of countless police, fireand ambulance sirens and the fainter shouts and cries of distressed people.And it was all his fault.He shook his head quickly. No, it was not his fault. This was Dee’s doing. Deeknew no sense of proportion; he had almost burned London to the ground in 1666,had devastated Ireland with the Great Famine in the 1840s, had destroyed most ofSan Francisco in 1906—and now he’d emptied the graveyards around Ojai. No doubtthe streets were littered with bones and bodies. Nicholas heard the reporter’smuted voice and then the sound of the cell phone being handed over.“Monsieur Montmorency?” Dora said politely in perfect French.“Madame. You are unharmed?”Dora’s voice fell to a whisper and she slipped into an archaic form of theFrench language that would be incomprehensible to any modern eavesdropper. “It’snot that easy to kill me,” she said quickly. “Dee has escaped, cut, bruised,battered and very, very upset. You are all safe? Scathach too?”“Scatty is safe. However, we’ve had an encounter with Niccolò Machiavelli.”“So he’s still around. Dee must have warned him. Be careful, Nicholas.Machiavelli is more dangerous than you can imagine. He is even more cunning thanDee. Now I must hurry,” she added urgently. “This reporter is gettingsuspicious. He probably thinks I’m giving you a better story than I gave him.What do you want?”“I need your help, Dora. I need to know who I can trust in Paris. I need to getthe children off the streets. They’re exhausted.”“Hmmm.” The line crackled with the sound of rustling paper. “I don’t know who isin Paris at the moment. But I’ll find out,” she said decisively. “What time isit there?”He glanced at his watch and did the math. “Five-thirty in the morning.”“Get to the Eiffel Tower. Be there by seven a.m. and wait for ten minutes. If Ican find someone trustworthy, I’ll have them meet you there. If no one yourecognize arrives, go back at eight and then at nine. If no one is there bynine, then you’ll know there is no one in Paris you can trust, and you will haveto make your own arrangements.”“Thank you, Madame Dora,” he said quietly. “I’ll not forget this debt.”“There are no debts between friends,” she said. “Oh, and Nicholas, try and keepmy granddaughter out of trouble.”“I’ll do my best,” Flamel said. “But you know what she’s like: she seems toattract trouble. Though right now, she’s watching over the twins in a café notfar from here. At least she can’t get into any trouble there.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENScathach brought her leg up, pressed the sole of her foot against the seat of achair and shoved hard. The wooden chair skipped across the floor and slammedinto the two police officers as they pushed through the door. They crashed tothe ground, a radio flying from the hand of one, a baton from the hand of theother. The squawking radio skidded to a halt at Josh’s feet. He leaned over andpoured his hot chocolate on it. It died in a fizz of sparks.Scathach surged to her feet. Without turning her head, she raised an arm andpointed at Roux. “You. Stay right where you are. And don’t even think aboutphoning for the police.”Heart hammering, Josh grabbed Sophie and pulled her away from the table, towardthe back of the shop, shielding her with his body from the police at the door.One of the officers raised a gun. And Scatty’s nunchaku struck it in the barrelwith enough force to bend the metal and send the weapon spinning from the man’shand.The second officer scrambled to his feet, pulling out a long black baton.Scathach’s right shoulder dipped and the nunchaku reversed direction in midair,the twelve-inch length of hardened wood striking the police baton just above itsshort handle. The baton shattered into ragged splinters. Scathach flipped thenunchaku back and it dropped into her outstretched hand.“I’m in a really bad mood,” she said in perfect French. “Believe me when I tellyou that you really do not want to fight me.”“Scatty…,” Josh hissed in alarm.“Not now,” the Warrior snapped in English. “Can’t you see I’m busy?”“Yeah, well, you’re about to get busier,” Josh shouted. “A lot busier. Lookoutside.”A police riot squad, in black body armor, full-face helmets and shields, armedwith batons and assault rifles, were racing down the street, straight for thecafé.“RAID,” the shop assistant whispered in horror.“Just like SWAT,” Scathach said in English, “only tougher.” She sounded almostpleased. Glancing sidelong at Roux, she snapped in French, “Is there a backdoor?”The shop assistant was shocked into immobility, staring at the approachingsquad, and didn’t react until Scathach whipped out the nunchaku and the roundedend whistled past his face, the breeze making him blink.“Is there a back door?” she demanded again, but in English.“Yes, yes, of course.”“Then get my friends out.”“No…,” Josh began.“Let me do something,” Sophie said, a dozen wind spells flickering into herconsciousness. “I can help….”“No,” Josh protested, and reached for his twin just as her blond hair crackled,sparkling silver.“Out!” Scatty shouted, and suddenly it was as if the planes and angles of herface had altered, cheekbones and chin becoming prominent, green eyes turned toreflective glass. For an instant, there was something ancient and primeval—andtotally alien—in her face. “I can take care of this.” She started spinning thenunchaku, creating an impenetrable shield between her and the two policemen. Oneofficer picked up a chair and flung it at her, but the nunchaku turned it tomatchwood.“Roux—get them out now!” Scatty snarled.“This way,” the terrified clerk said in American-accented English. He pushedpast the twins and led them down a narrow chilly corridor and out into a smallfoul-smelling yard piled high with trash cans, bits of broken restaurantfurniture and the skeleton of a long-abandoned Christmas tree. Behind them camethe sound of breaking wood.Roux pointed to a red gate and continued in English. His face was the color ofchalk. “That leads to the alleyway. Turn left for the Rue de Dunkerque; rightwill bring you down to the Gare du Nord Metro station.” Behind them there was atremendous smash, followed by the sound of breaking glass. “Your friend, she isin so much trouble,” he moaned miserably. “And RAID will wreck the shop. How amI going to explain that to the owner?”There was another crash from inside. A slate tile slid off the roof and crashedinto the yard.“Go, go now.” He spun the combination lock and tugged the gate open.Sophie and Josh ignored him. “What do we do?” Josh asked his twin. “Go or stay?”Sophie shook her head. She glanced at Roux and lowered her voice to a whisper.“We have nowhere to go—we don’t know anyone in the city except Scatty andNicholas. We don’t have any money and we have no passports.”“We could go to the American embassy.” Josh turned to Roux. “Is there anAmerican embassy in Paris?”“Yes, of course, on the Avenue Gabriel, beside the Hôtel de Crillon.” Theshaven-headed youth cringed as a colossal thump shook the whole building,filling the air with minute particles of dust. The glass in the window besidethem cracked from top to bottom and more tiles slid off the roof, to rain downinto the yard.“And what do we tell the embassy?” Sophie demanded. “They’ll want to know how wegot here.”“Kidnapped?” Josh suggested. And then a sudden thought struck him and he feltsick. “And what do we tell Mom and Dad? How are we going to explain it to them?”Crockery tinkled and shattered, and then there was a tremendous crack.Sophie cocked her head to one side and brushed her hair off her ear. “That wasthe main window.” She took a step back toward the door. “I should help her.”Wisps of mist curled off her fingers as she reached for the handle.“No!” Josh snatched her hand, and static crackled between them. “You can’t useyour powers,” he whispered urgently. “You’re too exhausted; remember what Scattysaid. You could burst into flames.”“She’s our friend—we can’t abandon her,” Sophie snapped. “I won’t, anyway.” Herbrother was a loner and had never been good at making or keeping friends inschool, whereas she was intensely loyal to hers, and she had started to think ofScatty as more than just a friend. Although she loved her brother deeply, shehad always wanted a sister.Josh caught Sophie’s shoulders and turned her to face him. He was already a headtaller than she was and had to look down into the blue eyes that mirrored hisown. “She’s not our friend, Sophie,” his voice low and serious. “She’s nevergoing to be our friend. She’s a two-and-a-half-thousand-year-old…something. Sheadmitted to us that she’s a vampire. You saw the way her face changed in there:she’s not even human. And…and I’m not sure she’s all Flamel makes her out to be.I know he isn’t!”“What do you mean?” Sophie demanded. “What are you trying to say?”Josh opened his mouth to reply, but a series of rattling thumps vibrated throughthe entire building. Whimpering with fear, Roux darted out into the alley. Thetwins ignored him.“What do you mean?” Sophie asked again.“Dee said—”“Dee!”“I talked to him in Ojai. When you were in the shop with the Witch of Endor.”“But he’s our enemy!”“Only because Flamel says he is,” Josh said quickly. “Sophie, Dee told me thatFlamel is a criminal and Scathach is basically just a hired thug. He said thatshe was cursed for her crimes to wear the body of a teenager for the rest of herlife.” He shook his head quickly and hurried on, his voice low and desperate.“Sis, we know next to nothing about these people…Flamel, Perenelle and Scathach.The only thing we do know is that they’ve made you different—dangerouslydifferent. They’ve taken us halfway across the world, and look where we arenow.” Even as he was speaking, the building shook, and then a dozen more tilesslid off the roof and crashed into the yard, sending razor-sharp fragmentsflying around them. Josh yelped as a chunk stung his arm. “We can’t trust them,Soph. We shouldn’t.”“Josh, you have no idea what powers they’ve given me….” Sophie caught herbrother’s arm, and the air, which was foul with the stink of rotting food, wastouched with the odor of vanilla, and then, a moment later, the scent of orangesas Josh’s aura flared briefly golden. “Oh, Josh, the things I could tell you. Iknow everything the Witch of Endor knew….”“And it’s making you sick!” Josh yelled angrily. “And don’t forget, if you useyour powers one more time, you could literally explode.”The twins’ auras flared gold and silver. Sophie squeezed her eyes shut as aflood of impressions, vague thoughts and random ideas slammed into herconsciousness. Her blue eyes blinked, momentarily silver, and she suddenlyrealized that she was experiencing her brother’s thoughts. She wrenched her handaway from him and the thoughts and sensations immediately faded.“You’re jealous!” she whispered in amazement. “Jealous of my powers.”Color touched Josh’s cheeks, and Sophie saw the truth in his eyes even before hespoke the lie. “I am not!”Suddenly, a black-clad police officer burst through the door and out into theyard. There was a long crack running down the front of his face visor, and hewas missing one of his black boots. Without pausing, he limped past them and raninto the alley. They could hear the pat of his naked foot and the slap of theleather sole fade away.Then Scatty strolled out into the yard. She was twirling her nunchaku as if shewere Charlie Chaplin swinging a cane. There wasn’t a hair out of place or a markon her body, and her green eyes were bright and alert. “Oh, I’m in a much bettermood now,” she announced.The twins looked past her into the corridor. Nothing and no one moved in thedarkness beyond.“But there were about ten of them…,” Sophie began.Scathach shrugged. “Twelve, actually.”“Armed…,” Josh said. He glanced sidelong at his sister, then back at theWarrior. He swallowed hard. “You didn’t…didn’t kill them, did you?”Wood snapped and something collapsed in the shop“No, they’re just…sleeping.” Scatty smiled.“But how did you—” Josh began.“I am the Warrior,” Scatty said simply.Sophie caught a hint of movement and opened her mouth to scream just as theshape appeared out of the corridor and a long-fingered hand fell on Scathach’sshoulder. The Warrior didn’t react.“I can’t leave you alone for ten minutes,” Nicholas Flamel said, stepping out ofthe shadows. He nodded at the open gate. “We’d better go,” he added, usheringthem toward the alleyway.“You missed the fight,” Josh told him. “There were ten of them….”“Twelve,” Scathach corrected him quickly.“I know,” the Alchemyst said with a wry smile, “only twelve: they didn’t stand achance.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVEN“Escaped!” Dr. John Dee snarled into the cell phone. “You had them surrounded.How could you let them escape?”On the other side of the Atlantic, Niccolò Machiavelli remained calm andcontrolled, only the tightening of his jaw muscles revealing his anger. “You areremarkably well informed.”“I have my sources,” Dee snapped, his thin lips twisting into an ugly smile. Heknew it would drive Machiavelli crazy knowing there was a spy in his camp.“You had them trapped in Ojai, I understand,” Machiavelli continued softly,“surrounded by an army of the risen dead. And yet they escaped. How could youlet them do that?”Dee sat back in the soft leather seat of the speeding limousine. His face waslit only by the screen of his cell phone, its glow touching his cheekbones andoutlining his sharp goatee in cold light, leaving his eyes in shadow. He hadn’ttold Machiavelli that he’d used necromancy to raise an army of dead humans andbeasts. Was this the Italian’s subtle way of letting him know that he had a spyin Dee’s camp?“Where are you now?” Machiavelli asked.Dee glanced out the window of the limousine, trying to read the road signsflashing past. “Somewhere on the 101, heading down to L.A. My jet is fueled andready to go, and we’re cleared for takeoff as soon as I arrive.”“I would anticipate having them in custody before you land in Paris,”Machiavelli said. The line crackled furiously, and he paused before adding, “Ibelieve they will attempt to contact Saint-Germain.”Dee sat bolt upright. “The Comte de Saint-Germain? He’s back in Paris? I heardhe had died in India looking for the lost city of Ophir.”“Obviously not. He has an apartment off the Champs-Elysées and two homes in thesuburbs that we are aware of. They are all under observation. If Flamel contactshim, we’ll know.”“Don’t let them escape this time,” Dee barked. “Our masters would not bepleased.” He snapped the phone shut before Machiavelli could respond. Then histeeth flashed in a quick smile. The net was closing tighter and tighter. “He can be so childish,” Machiavelli muttered in Italian. “Always has to havethe last word.” Standing in the ruins of the coffee shop, he carefully closedhis phone and looked around at the devastation. It was as if a tornado hadripped through the café. Every item of furniture was broken, the windows wereshattered, and there were even cracks in the ceiling. The powdery remains ofcups and saucers mixed with spilled coffee beans, scattered tea leaves andbroken pastries on the floor. Machiavelli bent to lift up a fork. It was curledin a perfect S shape. Tossing it aside, he picked his way through the debris.Scathach had single-handedly defeated twelve highly trained and heavily armedRAID officers. He had been vaguely hoping that perhaps she had lost some of hermartial arts skills in the years since he had last encountered her, but itseemed that his hope had been in vain. The Shadow was as deadly as ever. Gettingclose to Flamel and the children would be difficult with the Warrior in thepicture. In his long life, Niccolò had encountered her on at least half a dozenoccasions, and he’d barely survived each time. They’d last met in the frozenruins of Stalingrad in the winter of 1942. If it hadn’t been for her, his forceswould have taken the city. He’d sworn then that he would kill her: maybe now wasthe time to keep that promise.But how to kill the unkillable? What could stand against the warrior who hadtrained all of history’s greatest heroes, who had fought in every great conflictand whose fighting style was at the heart of just about every martial art?Stepping out of the demolished shop, Machiavelli breathed deeply, clearing hislungs of the bitter, acrid odor of spilled coffee and sour milk that hung in theair. Dagon pulled open the car door as he approached, and the Italian sawhimself reflected in his driver’s dark glasses. He paused before stepping intothe car and glanced up at the police closing off the streets, the heavily armedriot squad gathering in small groups and the plain clothes officers in theirunmarked cars. The French secret service were his to command, he could order inthe police, and he had access to a private army of hundreds of men and women whowould do his bidding without question. And yet he knew that none of them couldstand against the Warrior. He came to a decision and looked at Dagon beforeclimbing into the car.“Find the Disir.”Dagon stiffened, showing a rare sign of emotion. “Is that wise?” he asked.“It is necessary.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVE“The Witch said we should get to the Eiffel Tower by seven, and to wait therefor ten minutes,” Nicholas Flamel said as they hurried down the narrow alley.“If no one shows up in that time, we are to return there at eight and again atnine.”“Who’ll be there?” Sophie asked, jogging to keep up with Flamel’s long stride.She was exhausted, and the few moments sitting in the café had only served toemphasize just how tired she was. Her legs felt leaden and there was a sharpstitch in her left side.The Alchemyst shrugged. “I don’t know. Whoever the Witch can contact.”“That’s assuming there is anyone in Paris willing to risk helping you,” Scathachsaid lightly. “You are a dangerous enemy, Nicholas, and probably an even moredangerous friend. Death and destruction have always followed closely at yourheels.”Josh glanced sidelong at his sister, knowing she was listening. She deliberatelylooked away, but he knew she was uncomfortable with the conversation.“Well, if no one turns up,” Flamel said, “then we’ll go to plan B.”Scathach’s lips curled into a humorless smile. “I didn’t even know we had a planA. What’s plan B?”“I haven’t gotten that far yet.” He grinned. Then the smile faded. “I just wishPerenelle were here; she’d know what to do.”“We should split up,” Josh said suddenly.Flamel, who was in the lead, glanced over his shoulder. “I don’t think so.”“We have to,” Josh said firmly. “It makes sense.” But as he said it, he wonderedwhy the Alchemyst didn’t want them to split up.“Josh is right,” Sophie said. “The police are looking for the four of us. I’msure they have a description by now: two teenagers, a red-haired girl and an oldman. It’s not really a common group.”“Old!” Nicholas sounded vaguely insulted, his French accent pronounced. “Scattyis two thousand years older than I!”“Yes. But the difference is that I don’t look it,” the Warrior teased with agrin. “Splitting up is a good idea.”Josh stopped at the mouth of the narrow alley and looked up and down. Policesirens wailed and warbled all around them.Sophie stood beside her brother, and while the similarity in their features wasobvious, he suddenly noticed that there were now lines on her forehead, and herbright blue eyes had become cloudy, the irises flecked with silver. “Roux saidwe should turn left for the Rue de Dunkerque or right for the Metro station.”“I’m not sure that splitting up…” Flamel hesitated.Josh spun around. “We have to,” he said decisively. “Sophie and I will—” hebegan, but Nicholas shook his head, interrupting him.“OK. I agree that we should split up. But the police may be looking for twins….”“We don’t look too much like twins,” Sophie said quickly. “Josh is taller thanme.”“And you both have blond hair and bright blue eyes, and neither of you speaksFrench,” Scatty added. “Sophie, you come with me. Two girls together will notattract too much attention. Josh and Nicholas can go together.”“I’m not leaving Sophie…,” Josh protested, suddenly panicked at even the thoughtof being separated from his sister in this strange city.“I’ll be safe with Scatty,” Sophie said with a smile. “You worry too much. And Iknow Nicholas will look after you.”Josh didn’t look too sure. “I’d rather stay with my sister,” Josh said firmly.“Let the girls go together; it’s better this way,” Flamel said. “Safer.”“Safer?” Josh said incredulously. “Nothing about this is safe.”“Josh!” Sophie snapped, in the exact tone that their mother sometimes used.“Enough.” She turned back to the Warrior. “You’ll need to do something with yourhair. If the police have a description of a red-haired girl in black combats…”“You’re right.” Scathach’s left hand moved in a quick twisting gesture andsuddenly she was holding a short-bladed knife between her fingers. She turned toFlamel. “I’m going to need some cloth.” Without waiting for an answer, she spunhim around and lifted his battered leather jacket. With neat precise moves, shecut a square from the back of Flamel’s loose black T-shirt. Then she dropped hisleather jacket back in place and twisted the square of fabric into a bandana,knotting it at the back of her head, covering her distinctive hair.“This was my favorite T-shirt,” Flamel muttered. “It’s vintage.” He shifted hisshoulder uncomfortably. “And now my back is cold.”“Don’t be such a baby. I’ll buy you a new one,” Scatty said. She caught Sophie’shand. “Come on. Let’s go. See you at the Tower.”“Do you know the way?” Nicholas called after her.Scatty laughed. “I lived here for nearly sixty years, remember? I was here whenthe tower was built.”Flamel nodded. “Well, try not to draw attention to yourself.”“I’ll try.”“Sophie…,” Josh began.“I know,” his sister answered, “be careful.” She turned back and hugged herbrother quickly, their auras crackling. “Everything’s going to be all right,”she said softly, reading the fear in his eyes.Josh forced himself to smile, and he nodded. “How do you know? Magic?”“I just know,” she said simply. Her eyes blinked briefly silver. “This is allhappening for a reason—remember the prophecy. Everything’s going to work outfine.”“I believe you,” he said, even though he didn’t. “Be careful, and remember,” headded, “no wind.”Sophie hugged him quickly again. “No wind,” she whispered in his ear, and thenspun away.Nicholas and Josh watched Scatty and Sophie disappear down the street, headingtoward the Metro station; then they turned in the opposite direction. Justbefore they rounded a corner, Josh glanced back over his shoulder and saw thathis sister had done the same. They both raised their hands and waved good-bye.Josh waited until she had turned away and then lowered his hand. Now he wastruly alone, in a strange city, thousands of miles from home, with a man hedidn’t trust, a man he had started to fear. “I thought you said you knew the way,” Sophie said.“It’s been a while since I was here,” the Warrior admitted, “and the streetshave changed quite a bit.”“But you said you were here when the Eiffel Tower was built.” She stopped,abruptly realizing what she had just said. “And when was that exactly?” sheasked.“In 1889. I left a couple of months later.”Scathach stopped outside the Metro station and asked directions from a newspaperand magazine seller. The tiny Chinese woman spoke very little French so Scathachquickly switched to another language. Sophie abruptly realized that sherecognized it—it was Mandarin. The smiling clerk came out from behind thecounter and pointed down the street, speaking so quickly that Sophie was unableto pick up individual words, despite the Witch’s knowledge of the language. Itsounded as if she were singing. Scathach thanked her, then bowed, and the womanmatched the bow.Sophie caught the Warrior’s arm and dragged her away. “So much for notattracting attention to yourself,” she murmured. “People were starting tostare.”“What were they staring at?” Scathach asked, genuinely puzzled.“Oh, probably just the sight of a white girl speaking fluent Chinese and thenbowing,” Sophie said with a grin. “It was quite a performance.”“One day everyone will speak Mandarin, and bowing is just good manners,”Scathach said, setting off down the street, following the directions the womanhad given.Sophie fell into step beside her. “Where did you learn Chinese?” she asked.“In China. Actually, I was speaking Mandarin to the woman, but I also speak Wuand Cantonese. I’ve spent a lot of time in the Far East over the centuries. Iused to love it there.”They walked in silence, and then Sophie said, “So how many languages do youspeak?”Scathach frowned, eyes briefly closing as she considered. “Six or seven…”Sophie nodded. “Six or seven; that’s impressive. My mom and dad want us to learnSpanish, and Dad is teaching us Greek and Latin. But I’d really like to learnJapanese. I really want to visit Japan,” she added.“…six or seven hundred,” Scathach continued, then laughed aloud at the stunnedexpression on Sophie’s face. She slipped her arm through Sophie’s. “Well, Isuppose a few of those would be dead languages, so I’m not sure they count, butremember, I’ve been around for a very long time.”“Have you really lived for two and a half thousand years?” Sophie asked,glancing sidelong at the girl who looked no older than seventeen. She suddenlygrinned: never once had she imagined herself asking a question like that. It wasjust another example of how her life had changed.“Two thousand, five hundred and seventeen humani years.” Scathach smiled atight-lipped smile that hid her vampire teeth. “Hekate once abandoned me in aparticularly nasty Underworld Shadowrealm. It took me centuries to find my wayout. And when I was younger I spent a lot of time in the Shadowrealms ofLyonesse, Hy-Brasil and Tir na nOg, where time moves at a different pace.Shadowrealm time is not the same as humani time, so I really only count my timeon this earth. And who knows, you may get to find out for yourself. You and Joshare unique and powerful and will grow even more powerful as you master theelemental magics. If you don’t discover the secret of immortality yourselves,someone may offer it to you as a gift. Come on, let’s cross.” Catching hold ofSophie’s hand, she pulled her across a narrow road.Although it had only just turned six in the morning, traffic was starting tobuild. Vans were making deliveries to restaurants, and the chill morning air wasbeginning to fill with the mouth-watering odors of fresh-baked bread andpastries and percolating coffee. Sophie breathed in the familiar fragrances:croissants and coffee reminded her that only two days ago she had been servingthose in The Coffee Cup. She blinked away the sting of sudden tears. So much hadhappened, so much had changed in the past two days. “What’s it like to live solong?” she wondered aloud.“Lonely,” Scatty said quietly.“How long…how long will you live?” she asked the Warrior cautiously.Scatty shrugged and smiled. “Who knows? If I’m careful, exercise regularly andwatch my diet, I could live another couple of thousand years.” Then her smilefaded. “But I’m not invulnerable, nor am I invincible. I can be killed.” She sawthe stricken look on Sophie’s face and squeezed her arm. “But that’s not goingto happen. Do you know how many humani, immortals, Elders, were-creatures andassorted monsters have tried to kill me?”The girl shook her head.“Well, nor do I, actually. But there have been thousands. Maybe even tens ofthousands. And I’m still here; what does that tell you?”“That you’re good?”“Hah! I’m better than good. I am the best. I am the Warrior.” Scathach stoppedand looked into a bookshop window, but Sophie noticed that when she turned totalk, her bright green eyes were darting everywhere, taking in theirsurroundings.Resisting the temptation to turn around, Sophie lowered her voice to a whisper.“Are we being followed?” She was surprised to discover that she wasn’t the leastbit afraid; she knew, instinctively, that nothing could harm her when she waswith Scatty.“No, I don’t think so. Just old habits.” Scathach smiled. “The same habits thathave kept me alive through the centuries.” She moved away from the shop andSophie linked her arm with Scatty’s.“Nicholas called you other names when we met you….” Sophie frowned, trying toremember how he’d first introduced Scathach back in San Francisco only two daysago. “He called you the Warrior Maid, the Shadow, the Daemon Slayer, the KingMaker.”“Those are just names,” Scathach muttered, sounding embarrassed.“They sound like more than names,” Sophie pressed. “They sound liketitles…titles you’ve earned?” she persisted.“Well, I’ve had lots of names,” Scathach said, “names my friends gave me, namesmy foes called me. I was the Warrior Maid first, and then I became the Shadow,because of my skills at concealment. I perfected the first camouflage clothing.”“You sound like a ninja,” Sophie laughed. Listening to the Warrior talk, imagesfrom the Witch’s memories flickered through her head, and she knew that Scattywas telling the truth.“I tried teaching ninjas, but they were never that good, believe me. I becamethe Daemon Slayer when I killed Raktabija. And I was called the King Maker whenI helped put Arthur on the throne,” she added, her voice turning grim. She shookher head quickly. “That was a mistake. And not my first either.” She laughed,but it came out shaky and sounding forced. “I’ve made a lot of mistakes.”“My dad says you can learn from your mistakes.”Scatty barked a laugh. “Not me.” She was unable to keep the note of bitternessfrom her voice.“It sounds like you’ve had a tough life,” Sophie said quietly.“It’s been tough,” the Warrior admitted.“Has there ever been a…” Sophie paused, hunting for the word. “Have you ever hada…a boyfriend?”Scathach looked at her sharply, then turned her face away to stare into a shopwindow. For a moment Sophie thought she was examining the display of shoes, butthen she realized that the Warrior was looking at her own reflection in theglass. The girl wondered what she saw.“No,” Scatty finally admitted. “There’s never been anyone close, anyonespecial.” She smiled tightly. “The Elders fear and avoid me. And I try not toget too close to humani. It’s too hard watching them age and die. That is thecurse of immortality: to watch the world change, to see everything you knowwither. Remember that, Sophie, if someone offers you the gift of immortality.”She made the last word sound like a profanity.“It sounds so lonely,” Sophie said carefully. She never thought about what itmust be like to be immortal before—to live on while everything familiar changedand everyone you knew left you. They walked a dozen steps in silence beforeScatty spoke again.“Yes, it’s been lonely,” she admitted, “very lonely.”“I know about lonely,” Sophie said thoughtfully. “With Mom and Dad away so muchor moving us from city to city, it’s hard to make friends. It’s almostimpossible to keep them. I suppose that’s why Josh and I have always been soclose; we’ve had no one else. My best friend, Elle, is in New York. We talk onthe phone all the time, and e-mail and chat on IM, but I haven’t seen her sinceChristmas. She sends me photos off her cell every time she changes her haircolor, so I know what she looks like,” she added with a smile. “Josh doesn’teven try to make friends, though.”“Friends are important,” Scathach agreed, squeezing Sophie’s arm lightly. “Butwhile friends come and go, you will always have family.”“What about your family? The Witch of Endor mentioned your mother and brother.”Even as she was speaking, images from the Witch’s memories popped into her mind:a sharp-faced older woman with bloodred eyes and an ashen-skinned young man withblazing red hair.The Warrior shrugged uncomfortably. “We don’t talk much these days. My parentswere Elders, born and raised on the isle of Danu Talis. When my grandmother Doraleft the island to teach the first humani, they never forgave her. Like manyElders, they considered the humani to be little better than beasts.‘Curiosities,’ my father called them.” A flicker of disgust crossed her face.“Prejudice has always been with us. My mother and father were even more shockedwhen I announced that I too was going to work with the humani, to fight forthem, to protect them when I could.”“Why?” Sophie asked.Scatty’s voice grew soft. “It was obvious to me, even then, that the humani werethe future and that the days of the Elder Races were drawing to a close.” Sheglanced sidelong at Sophie, who was surprised to find Scathach’s eyes bright andglittering, almost as if there were tears in them. “My parents warned me that ifI left home, I would bring shame on the family name and they would disown me.”Scatty’s voice trailed into silence.“But you still left,” Sophie guessed.The Warrior nodded. “I left. We didn’t speak for a millennium…until they were introuble and needed my help,” she added with a grim smile. “We talk occasionallynow, but I’m afraid they still consider me an embarrassment.”Sophie squeezed her hand gently. She felt uncomfortable with what the Warriorhad just told her, but she also realized that Scatty had shared somethingincredibly personal, something that Sophie doubted the ancient warrior had evershared with anyone else. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you.”Scathach squeezed back. “You didn’t upset me. They upset me—more than twothousand years ago, in fact—and I can still remember it as if it were yesterday.It’s been a long time since anyone took the trouble to ask about my life. Andbelieve me, it’s not been all bad. I’ve had some wonderful adventures,” she saidbrightly. “Did I tell you about the time I was the lead singer in an all-girlband? Sort of goth-punk Spice Girls, but we only did Tori Amos covers. We werevery big in Germany.” She lowered her voice. “The problem was, we were allvampires….” Nicholas and Josh turned onto the Rue de Dunkerque and discovered there werepolice everywhere. “Keep walking,” Nicholas said urgently as Josh slowed. “Andact natural.”“Natural,” Josh muttered. “I don’t even know what that means anymore.”“Walk quickly, but don’t run,” Nicholas said patiently. “You’re completelyinnocent, a student on the way to class or heading to a summer job. Look at thepolice, but don’t stare. And if one looks at you, don’t turn away quickly, justlet your eyes drift on to the next character. That’s what an ordinary citizenwould do. If we’re stopped, I’ll do the talking. We’ll be fine.” He saw theskeptical look on the boy’s face and his smile widened. “Trust me, I’ve beendoing this for a very long time. The trick is to move as if you have every rightin the world to be here. The police are trained to look for people who look andact suspicious.”“Don’t you think we fall into both categories?” Josh asked.“We look like we belong—and that makes us invisible.”A group of three policemen didn’t even look in their direction as they walkedpast. Josh noticed that each was wearing a different type of uniform, and themen seemed to be arguing.“Good,” Nicholas said when they were out of earshot.“What’s good?”Nicholas inclined his head in the direction they had just come. “You saw thedifferent uniforms?”The boy nodded.“France has a complicated police system; Paris even more so. There is the PoliceNationale, the Gendarmerie Nationale and the Préfecture de Police. Machiavellihas obviously pulled out all the stops to find us, but his great failing hasalways been that he assumes that other people are as coldly logical as he is. Heobviously thinks that if he puts all these police resources on the streets, theywill do nothing but search for us. But there is a great deal of rivalry betweenthe various units, and no doubt everyone wants the credit for capturing thedangerous criminals.”“Is that what you’ve made us into now?” Josh asked, unable to disguise thesudden bitterness in his voice. “Two days ago, Sophie and I were happy, normalpeople. And now look at us: I barely know my own sister. We’ve been hunted,attacked by monsters and now we’re on a police most-wanted list. You’ve made uscriminals, Mr. Flamel. But this isn’t the first time you’ve been a criminal, isit?” he snapped. He shoved his hands deep into his pockets and closed them intofists to prevent them from shaking. He was scared and angry, and the fear wasmaking him reckless. He’d never talked to an adult like that before.“No,” Nicholas said mildly, his pale eyes starting to glitter dangerously. “I’vebeen called a criminal. But only by my enemies. It seems to me,” he added aftera long pause, “that you’ve been talking to Dr. Dee. And the only place you couldhave encountered him was in Ojai, since that was the only time you were out ofmy sight.”Josh didn’t even think about denying it. “I met Dee when the three of you werebusy with the Witch,” he admitted defiantly. “He told me a lot about you.”“I’m quite sure he did,” Flamel murmured. He waited by the curb as a dozenstudents on bicycles and mopeds sped past; then he strolled across the street.Josh hurried after him.“He said that you never tell anyone everything.”“True,” Flamel agreed. “If you tell people everything, you take away theiropportunity to learn.”“He said you stole the Book of Abraham from the Louvre.”Nicholas walked for half a dozen steps before nodding. “Well, I suppose that istrue too,” he said, “though it’s not quite so straightforward as he would liketo paint it. Certainly, in the seventeenth century, the book briefly fell intothe hands of Cardinal Richelieu.”Josh shook his head. “Who’s that?”“Have you never read The Three Musketeers?” Flamel asked in astonishment.“Nope. Didn’t even see the movie.”Flamel shook his head. “I’ve got a copy in the shop…,” he began, and thenstopped. When he’d walked away from the bookshop on Thursday, it had been atrashed ruin. “Richelieu appears in the books—and the movies, too. He was a realperson and was known as the l’Eminence Rouge—the Red Eminence—so named after hiscardinal’s red robes,” he explained. “He was King Louis XIII’s chief minister,but in reality he ruled the country. In 1632, Dee managed to trap Perenelle andme in a part of the old city. His inhuman agents had surrounded us; there wereghouls in the earth beneath our feet, Dire-Crows in the air, and Baobhan Sithwere tracking us through the streets.” Nicholas shrugged uncomfortably at thememory and looked up and around, almost as if he expected to see the creaturesappear again. “I was beginning to think that I was going to have to destroy theCodex rather than see it fall into Dee’s hands. Then Perenelle suggested onelast option: we could hide the book in plain sight. It was simple andbrilliant!”“What did you do?” Josh asked, curious now.Flamel’s teeth flashed in a quick smile. “I sought an audience with CardinalRichelieu and presented him with the book.”“You gave it to him? Did he know what it was?”“Of course he did. The Book of Abraham is famous, Josh—or maybe infamous mightbe a better word. Next time you go online, look it up.”“Did the cardinal know who you were?” he asked. Listening to Flamel talk, it waseasy—so easy—to believe everything he said. And then he remembered howbelievable Dee had been back in Ojai.Flamel smiled, remembering. “Cardinal Richelieu believed I was one of thedescendants of Nicholas Flamel. So we presented him with the Book of Abraham andhe put it in his library.” Nicholas laughed softly as he shook his head. “Thesafest place in all of France.”Josh frowned. “But surely when he looked at it, he saw that the text moved?”“Perenelle put a glamour over the book. It’s a particular type ofspell—astonishingly simple, apparently, though I could never master it—so whenthe cardinal looked at the book, he saw what he expected to see: pages of ornateGreek and Aramaic writing.”“Did Dee catch you?”“Almost. We escaped down the Seine on a barge. Dee himself stood on the PontNeuf with a dozen musketeers and fired scores of shots at us. They all missed;despite the musketeers’ reputation, they were terrible shots,” he added. “Andthen, a couple of weeks later, Perenelle and I returned to Paris, broke into thelibrary and stole our book back. So I suppose you could say that Dee is right,”he concluded. “I am a thief.”Josh walked on in silence; he had no idea what to believe. He wanted to believeFlamel; working in the bookshop alongside the man, he’d grown to like andrespect him. He wanted to trust him…and yet he could never forgive him forputting Sophie in danger.Flamel glanced up and down the street; then, putting his hand on Josh’sshoulder, he guided him through the stalled traffic and across the Rue deDunkerque. “Just in case we’re being followed,” he said softly, his lips barelymoving as they darted through the early-morning traffic.Once they were across the road, Josh shrugged off Nicholas’s hand. “What Deesaid made a lot of sense,” he continued.“I’m sure it did,” Flamel said with a laugh. “Dr. John Dee has been many thingsin his long and colorful life, a magus and a mathematician, an alchemist andspy. But let me tell you, Josh, he was often a rogue and always a liar. He is amaster of lies and half-truths, and he practiced and perfected his craft in thatmost dangerous of times, the Elizabethan Age. He knows that the best lie is onethat is wrapped around a core of truth.” He paused, his eyes flickering over thecrowd streaming past them. “What else did he tell you?”Josh hesitated for a moment before replying. He was tempted not to reveal all ofhis conversation with Dee but then realized that he’d probably said too muchalready. “Dee said that you only used the spells in the Codex for your owngood.”Nicholas nodded. “It’s a fair point. I use the immortality spell to keepPerenelle and myself alive, that is true. And I use the philosopher’s stoneformulation to turn ordinary metal into gold and coal into diamonds. There’s nomoney in bookselling, let me tell you. But we only make as much wealth as weneed—we’re not greedy.”Josh hurried ahead of Flamel, then turned around to face him. “This isn’t aboutthe money,” he snapped. “There is so much else you could be doing with what’s inthat book. Dee said it could be used to turn this world into a paradise, that itcould cure all disease, even repair the environment.” He found itincomprehensible that someone would not want to do that.Flamel stopped in front of Josh. His eyes were almost on a level with the boy’s.“Yes, there are spells in the Book which would do all that and much, much more,”he said seriously. “I’ve glimpsed spells in the Book that could reduce thisworld to a cinder, others that would make the deserts bloom. But Josh, even if Icould work those spells—which I cannot—the material in the Book is not mine touse.” Flamel’s pale eyes bored into Josh’s, and Josh had no doubt now that theAlchemyst was telling the truth. “Perenelle and I are only the Guardians of theBook. We are simply holding it in trust until we can pass it on to its rightfulowners. They will know how to use it.”“But who are the rightful owners? Where are they?”Nicholas Flamel put both hands on Josh’s shoulders and stared into his brightblue eyes. “Well, I was hoping,” he said very softly, “that it might be you andSophie. In fact, I’m gambling everything—my life, Perenelle’s life, the survivalof the entire human race—that you are.”Standing on the Rue de Dunkerque, looking into the Alchemyst’s eyes, reading thetruth in them, Josh felt the people fade away until it was as if they werestanding alone on the street. He swallowed hard. “And you believe that?”“With all my heart,” Flamel said simply. “And everything I have done, I’ve doneto protect you and Sophie and to prepare you for what is to come. You have tobelieve me, Josh. You must. I know you’re angry because of what has happenedwith Sophie, but I would never let her come to harm.”“She could have died or fallen into a coma,” Josh muttered.Flamel shook his head. “If she were an ordinary human, then yes, that could havehappened. But I know she isn’t ordinary. Nor are you,” he added.“Because of our auras?” Josh asked, digging for as much information as he couldget.“Because you are the twins of legend.”“And if you’re wrong? Have you thought about that: what happens if you’rewrong?”“Then the Dark Elders return.”“Would that be so bad?” Josh wondered aloud.Nicholas opened his mouth to reply and quickly pressed his lips tightlytogether, biting back whatever he had been about to say, but not before Josh sawthe quick flash of anger that darted across his face. Finally, Nicholas forcedhis lips into a smile. Gently, he turned Josh around so that he was facing thestreet. “What do you see?” he asked.Josh shook his head and shrugged. “Nothing…just a bunch of people heading off towork. And the police looking for us,” he added.Nicholas caught Josh’s shoulder and urged him down the street. “Don’t think ofthem as a bunch of people,” Flamel admonished sharply. “That’s how Dee and hiskind see humankind: what they call the humani. I see individuals, with worriesand cares, with family and loved ones, with friends and colleagues. I seepeople.”Josh shook his head. “I don’t understand.”“Dee and the Elders he serves look at these people and see only slaves.” Hepaused, then quietly added, “Or food.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEENLying flat on her back, Perenelle Flamel stared at the stained stone ceilingdirectly above her head and wondered how many other prisoners incarcerated onAlcatraz had done the same. How many others had traced the lines and cracks inthe stonework, seen shapes in the black water marks, imagined pictures in thebrown damp? Almost all of them, she guessed.And how many had heard voices? she wondered. She was sure that many of theprisoners had imagined they heard sounds in the dark—whispered words, hushedphrases—but unless they possessed Perenelle’s special gift, what they werehearing did not exist outside their imaginations.Perenelle heard the voices of the ghosts of Alcatraz.Listening intently, she could distinguish hundreds of voices, maybe eventhousands. Men and women—children, too—clamoring and shouting, muttering andcrying, calling out for lost loved ones, repeating their own names again andagain, proclaiming their innocence, cursing their jailers. She frowned; theyweren’t what she was looking for.Allowing the voices to wash over her, she sorted through the sounds until shepicked up one voice louder than all the rest: strong and confident, it cutthrough the babble, and Perenelle found herself concentrating on it, focusing onthe words, identifying the language.“This is my island.”It was a man, speaking Spanish in an old, very formal accent. Concentrating onthe ceiling, Perenelle tuned out the other voices. “Who are you?” In the chilldamp of the cell, her words puffed from her mouth like smoke and the myriadghosts fell silent.There was a long pause, as if the ghost was surprised to be spoken to; then hesaid proudly, “I was the first European to sail into this bay, the first to seethis island.”A shape began to form on the roof directly over her head, the crude outline of aface appearing in the cracks and spiderwebs, the black damp and the green mosslending it shape and definition.“I called this place la Isla de los Alcatraces.”“The Isle of the Pelicans,” Perenelle said, her words the merest whisperedbreath.The face in the ceiling solidified briefly. It was that of a handsome man with along, narrow face and dark eyes. Water droplets formed and the eyes blinkedtears.“Who are you?” Perenelle asked again.“I am Juan Manuel de Ayala. I discovered Alcatraz.”Claws click-clacked on the stones outside the cell, and the smell of snake andrancid meat wafted down the corridor. Perenelle remained silent until the scentand the footsteps retreated, and when she looked at the ceiling again, the facehad taken on more detail, the cracks in the stonework creating the deep wrinkleson the man’s forehead and around his eyes. A sailor’s face, she realized, thewrinkles caused by squinting toward distant horizons.“Why are you here?” she wondered aloud. “Did you die here?”“No. Not here.” Narrow lips curled in a smile. “I returned because I fell inlove with this place from the very first moment I set eyes on it. It was in theyear of Our Lord 1775, and I was on the good ship San Carlos. I even rememberthe month, August, and the date, the fifth.”Perenelle nodded. She had come across ghosts like de Ayala’s before. Men andwomen who had been so influenced or affected by a place that they returned to itagain and again in their dreams, and eventually, when they died, their spiritreturned to the same location to become a Guardian ghost.“I have watched over this island for generations. I will always watch over it.”Perenelle stared up at the face. “It must have saddened you to see yourbeautiful island become a place of pain and suffering,” she probed.Something twisted in the shape’s mouth, and a single drop of water fell from itseye to spatter on Perenelle’s cheek.“Dark days, sad days, but gone now…thankfully, gone.” The ghost’s lips moved andthe words whispered in Perenelle’s head. “There has not been a human prisoner onAlcatraz since 1963, and the island has been peaceful since 1971.”“But now there is a new prisoner on your beloved island,” Perenelle said evenly.“A prisoner guarded by a warden more terrible than any this island has ever seenbefore.”The face in the ceiling altered, watery eyes narrowing, blinking. “Who? You?”“I am held here against my will,” Perenelle said. “I am Alcatraz’s lastprisoner, and I am guarded by no human jailor, but by a sphinx.”“No!”“See for yourself!”The plaster crackled and damp dust rained down on Perenelle’s face. When sheopened her eyes again, the face in the ceiling had gone, leaving nothing morethan a stain in its wake.Perenelle allowed herself a smile.“What amuses you, humani?” The voice was a slithering hiss, and the languagepredated the human race.Swinging herself into a sitting position, Perenelle focused on the creaturestanding in the corridor less than six feet from her.Generations of ancient humans had tried to capture the image of this creature oncave walls and pots, etching her shape in stone, capturing her likeness onparchments. And none of them had even come close to the true horror of thesphinx.The body was that of a hugely muscled lion, the fur scarred and cut with theevidence of old wounds. A pair of eagle’s wings curled out of its shoulders andlay flat against its back, the feathers ragged and filthy. And the small, almostdelicate-looking head was that of a beautiful young woman.The sphinx stepped up to the bars of the cell, and a black forked tongue waveredin the air in front of Perenelle. “You have no reason to smile, humani. I havelearned that your husband and the Warrior are trapped in Paris. Soon they willbe prisoners, and this time Dr. Dee will ensure that they never escape again. Iunderstand the Elders have given the doctor permission to finally slay thelegendary Alchemyst.”Perenelle felt something twist in the pit of her stomach. For generations theDark Elders had been intent on capturing Nicholas and Perenelle alive. If shewas to believe the sphinx and they were prepared to kill Nicholas, theneverything had changed. “Nicholas will escape,” she said confidently.“Not this time.” The lion’s tail of the sphinx whipped excitedly back and forth,raising plumes of dust. “Paris belongs to the Italian, Machiavelli, and soon hewill be joined by the English Magician. The Alchemyst cannot evade them both.”“And the children?” Perenelle asked, eyes narrowing dangerously. If anything hadhappened to Nicholas or the children…The sphinx’s feathers ruffled, raising a musty sour smell. “Dee believes thehumani children are powerful, that they may indeed be the twins of prophecy andlegend. He also believes they can be convinced that they should serve us, ratherthan following the ramblings of a mad old bookseller.” The sphinx took a deepshuddering breath. “But if they do not do as they are told, then they too willperish.”“And what about me?”The sphinx’s pretty mouth opened to reveal a maw of savage, needle-pointedteeth. Her long black tongue thrashed wildly in the air. “You are mine,Sorceress,” she hissed. “The Elders have given you to me as a gift for mymillennia of service to them. When your husband has been captured and slain,then I will be given permission to eat your memories. What a feast it will be. Iintend to savor every last morsel. When I am finished with you, you willremember nothing, not even your own name.” The sphinx started to laugh, thesound hissing and mocking, bouncing off the bare stone walls.And then a cell door slammed.The sudden sound shocked the sphinx into silence. Her small head turned, hertongue flickering, tasting the air.Another door boomed shut.And then another.And another.The sphinx spun away, claws striking sparks off the floor. “Who’s there?” Hervoice screeched off the damp stones.Abruptly, all the cell doors in the upper gallery rattled open and closed inquick succession, the sound a rumbling detonation that vibrated deep into theheart of the prison, causing dust to rain from the ceiling.Snarling and hissing, the sphinx bounded away, looking for the source of thenoise.With an icy smile, Perenelle swung her feet back up on the bench, lay back andrested her head on her laced fingers. The island of Alcatraz belonged to JuanManuel de Ayala, and it looked as though he was announcing his presence.Perenelle heard cell doors clang, wood thump and walls rattle and knew what deAyala had become: a poltergeist.A noisy ghost.She also knew what de Ayala was doing. The sphinx fed off Perenelle’s magicalenergies; all the poltergeist had to do was to keep the creature away from thecell for a little time and Perenelle’s powers could begin to regenerate. Raisingher left hand, the woman concentrated hard. The tiniest ice white spark dancedbetween her fingers, then fizzled away.Soon.Soon.The Sorceress closed her hand into a fist. When her powers had recovered, shewould bring Alcatraz tumbling down around the sphinx’s ears."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEENThe beautifully intricate Eiffel Tower loomed more than nine hundred feet overJosh’s head. There was a time when he’d compiled a list for a school project ofthe Ten Wonders of the Modern World. The metal tower had been number two on thatlist, and he’d always promised himself that someday he’d get to see it.And now that he was finally in Paris, he didn’t even look up.Standing almost directly beneath the center of the tower, he rose on his toes,turning his head left and right, searching for his twin among the surprisinglylarge number of early-morning tourists. Where was she?Josh was scared.No, more than scared—he was terrified.The last couple of days had taught him the true meaning of fear. Prior to theevents of Thursday, Josh had only ever really been afraid of failing a test orbeing publicly humiliated in class. He had other fears too, those vague, shiverythoughts that came in the dead of night, when he found himself lying awakewondering what would happen if his parents had an accident. Sara and RichardNewman both held PhD’s in archaeology and paleontology, and while that wasn’tthe most dangerous line of work, their research sometimes took them intocountries in the midst of religious or political turmoil, or they conductedtheir digs in areas of the world ravaged by hurricanes or in earthquake zones orclose to active volcanoes. The sudden movements of the earth’s crust often threwup extraordinary archaeological finds.But his deepest, darkest fear was that something would happen to his sister.Although Sophie was twenty-eight seconds older, he always thought of her as hisbaby sister. He was bigger and stronger, and it was his job to protect her.And now, in a way, something terrible had happened to his twin.She had changed in ways he could not even begin to comprehend. She had becomemore like Flamel and Scathach and their kind than like him: she had become morethan human.For the first time in his life, he felt alone. He was losing his sister. Butthere was one way to be her equal again: he had to have his own powers Awakened.Josh turned—just as Sophie and Scathach appeared, hurrying across a broad bridgethat led directly to the tower. Relief washed over him. “They’re here,” he saidto Flamel, who was facing the opposite direction.“I know,” Nicholas said, his French accent sounding stronger than usual. “Andthey’re not alone.”Josh tore his gaze away from his approaching sister and Scathach. “What do youmean?”Nicholas inclined his head slightly and Josh turned. Two tourist buses had justarrived at the Place Joffre and were disgorging their passengers. Thetourists—Americans, Josh guessed by their clothing—milled around, chatting andlaughing, cameras and videos already whirring while their guides tried to gatherthem together. A third bus, bright yellow, pulled up, spilling dozens of excitedJapanese tourists out on the pavement. Confused, Josh looked at Nicholas: did hemean the buses?“In black,” Flamel said enigmatically, pointing by lifting his chin.Josh turned and spotted the man in black striding toward them, moving swiftlythrough the holiday crowd. None of the tourists even glanced at the strangerweaving his way among them, twisting and turning like a dancer, taking care tonot so much as brush against them. Josh guessed the man was probably about hisown height, but it was impossible to make out his body shape because he waswearing a three-quarter-length black leather coat that flapped about him as hewalked. The collar was turned up, and his hands were pushed deep into thepockets. Josh felt his heart sink: now what?Sophie raced up and punched her brother in the arm. “You got here,” she saidbreathlessly. “Any trouble?”Josh tilted his head toward the approaching man in the leather coat. “I’m notsure.”Scathach appeared beside the twins. She wasn’t even breathing hard, Josh noted.In fact, she wasn’t breathing at all.“Trouble?” Sophie asked, looking at Scathach.The Warrior smiled, tight-lipped. “Depends how you define trouble,” shemurmured.“On the contrary,” Nicholas said, smiling broadly. He heaved a sigh of relief.“It’s a friend. An old friend. A good friend.”The man in the black coat was closer now, and the twins could see that he had asmall, almost round face, deeply tanned skin and piercing blue eyes. Thickshoulder-length black hair was swept back off his high forehead. Mounting thesteps, he pulled both hands out of his pockets and spread his arms wide, silverrings winking on every finger and on his thumbs, matching the silver studs inboth ears. A broad smile revealed misshapen, slightly yellowed teeth.“Master,” he said, wrapping both arms around Nicholas and kissing him quickly onboth cheeks. “You have returned.” The man blinked, eyes moist, and for aninstant the pupils winked red. There was a sudden hint of burnt leaves in theair.“And you never left,” Nicholas said warmly, holding the man at arm’s length andexamining him critically. “You look well, Francis. Better than the last time Isaw you.” He turned, putting his arm around the man’s shoulder. “Scathach youknow, of course.”“Who could forget the Shadow?” The blue-eyed man stepped forward, caught theWarrior’s pale hand in his and brought it to his lips in an old-fashionedcourtly gesture.Scathach leaned forward and pinched the man’s cheek hard enough to leave a redmark. “I told you last time; don’t do that to me.”“Admit it—you love it.” He grinned. “And this must be Sophie and Josh. The Witchtold me about them,” he added. The man’s bright blue eyes remained wide andunblinking as he regarded the two in turn. “The twins of legend,” he murmured,frowning a bit as he stared hard at them. “You’re sure?”“I’m sure,” Nicholas said firmly.The stranger nodded and bowed slightly. “The twins of legend,” he repeated. “Iam honored to make your acquaintance. Allow me to introduce myself. I am leComte de Saint-Germain,” he announced dramatically, and then paused, almost asif he expected them to know the name.The twins looked at him blankly, identical expressions on their faces.“But you must call me Francis; all my friends do.”“My favorite student,” Nicholas added fondly. “Certainly my best student. We’veknown one another a long time.”“How long?” Sophie asked automatically, although even as she was asking thequestion, the answer popped into her head.“For about three hundred years or so,” Nicholas said. “Francis trained to be analchemist with me. He quickly surpassed me,” he added. “He specialized increating jewels.”“I learned everything I know about alchemy from the master: Nicholas Flamel,”Saint-Germain said quickly.“In the eighteenth century, Francis was also an accomplished singer andmusician. And what are you this century?” Nicholas asked.“Well, I have to say I am disappointed you’ve not heard of me,” the man said inaccentless English. “You’ve obviously not been keeping up with the charts. I’vehad five number-one hits in the States and three in Germany, and I won an MTVEurope Best Newcomer award.”“Best Newcomer?” Nicholas grinned, emphasizing the word new. “You!”“You know that I have always been a musician, but in this century, Nicholas, I’ma rock star!” he said proudly. “I am Germain!” He looked at the twins as hespoke, eyebrows raised, nodding, waiting for them to react to the announcement.They shook their heads simultaneously. “Never heard of you,” Josh said bluntly.Saint-Germain shrugged and looked disappointed. He brought the collar of hiscoat up around his ears. “Five number-one hits,” he muttered.“What type of music?” Sophie asked, biting the inside of her cheek to keepherself from smiling at the crestfallen expression on the man’s face.“Dance…electro…techno…that sort of thing.”Sophie and Josh shook their heads again. “Don’t listen to it,” Josh answered,but Saint-Germain was no longer looking at the twins. His head had swiveledtoward the Avenue Gustave Eiffel, to where a long sleek black Mercedes hadpulled up to the curb. Three plain black vans drew up behind it.“Machiavelli!” Flamel snapped angrily. “Francis, you were followed.”“But how…,” the count began.“Remember, it’s Niccolò we’re dealing with.” Flamel looked around quickly,assessing the situation. “Scathach, take the twins, go with Saint-Germain.Protect them with your lives.”“We can stay, I can fight,” Scathach said.Nicholas shook his head. He waved at the gathered tourists. “Too many people.Someone would be killed. But Machiavelli is not Dee; he’s subtle. He’ll not usemagic—not if he can help it. We can use that to our advantage. If we split up,he will follow me; I’m the one he wants. And not just me.” Reaching under hisshirt, he pulled out a small square cloth bag.“What’s that?” Saint-Germain asked.Nicholas answered Saint-Germain but looked at the twins as he spoke. “Once itheld the entire Codex, but now Dee has that. Josh managed to tear two pages fromthe back of the book. They’re in here. The pages contain the Final Summoning,”he added significantly. “Dee and his Elders need these pages.” He smoothed thecloth and then suddenly handed the bag over to Josh. “Keep these safe,” he said.“Me?” Josh looked from the bag to Flamel’s face but made no move to take it fromthe man’s hand.“Yes, you. Take it,” Flamel commanded.Reluctantly, the boy reached for the bag, the cloth crackling and sparking as heshoved it under his T-shirt. “Why me?” he asked. He looked quickly at hissister. “I mean, Scathach or Saint-Germain would be better….”“You rescued the pages, Josh. It’s only right that you should guard them.”Flamel gripped Josh’s shoulders and looked into the boy’s eyes. “I know I cantrust you to take care of them.”Josh pressed his hand against his stomach, feeling the cloth against his skin.When Josh and Sophie had started working in the bookshop and the coffee shoprespectively, their father had used an almost identical phrase when talkingabout Sophie. “I know I can trust you to take care of her.” In that moment, he’dfelt both proud and a little bit frightened. Right now, he just felt frightened.The Mercedes driver’s door opened and a man in a black suit climbed out,mirrored shades reflecting the early-morning sky, making it look as if he hadtwo holes in his face.“Dagon,” Scathach snarled, sharp teeth suddenly visible, and reached for aweapon in her bag, but Nicholas caught her arm and squeezed it.“This is not the time.”Dagon opened the rear door and Niccolò Machiavelli emerged. Although he was atleast a hundred yards away, they could clearly see the look of triumph on hisface.Behind the Mercedes, the vans’ doors slid open simultaneously and heavily armedand armored police jumped out and started jogging toward the tower. A touristscreamed, and the dozens of people standing around the base of the Eiffel Towerimmediately swiveled their cameras in that direction.“Time to go,” Flamel said quickly. “You head across the river, I’ll lead them inthe other direction. Saint-Germain, my friend,” Nicholas whispered softly,“we’re going to need a distraction to help us escape. Something spectacular.”“Where will you go?” Saint-Germain demanded.Flamel smiled. “This was my city long before Machiavelli came here. Perhaps someof my old haunts still remain.”“It has changed a lot since you were last here,” Saint-Germain warned. As he wasspeaking, he took Flamel’s left hand in both of his, turned it over and pressedthe ball of his right thumb into the center of the Alchemyst’s palm. Sophie andJosh were close enough to see that when he took his hand away, there was theimpression of a tiny black-winged butterfly on Flamel’s skin. “It will lead youback to me,” Saint-Germain said mysteriously. “Now, you wanted somethingspectacular.” He grinned and pushed back the sleeves of his leather coat toreveal bare arms. His skin was covered in dozens of tiny tattooed butterfliesthat wrapped around his wrists like bracelets, then coiled up around his arm tothe crook of his elbow. Lacing the fingers of his hands together, he twisted hiswrists and bent them outward with an audible crack, like a pianist preparing toplay. “Did you ever see what Paris did to celebrate the millennium?”“The millennium?” The twins looked at him blankly.“The millennium. The year 2000. Although the millennium should have beencelebrated in 2001,” he added.“Oh, that millennium,” Sophie said. She looked at her brother, confused. Whatdid the millennium have to do with anything?“Our parents took us to Times Square,” Josh said. “Why?”“Then you missed something truly spectacular here in Paris. Next time you’reonline, check out the pictures.” Saint-Germain rubbed his arms briskly and then,standing below the huge metal tower, he raised his hands high and suddenly thescent of burnt leaves filled the air.Both Sophie and Josh watched the butterfly tattoos spasm, then shiver and pulseon Saint-Germain’s arms. Gossamer wings trembled and vibrated, antennastwitched…and then the tattoos lifted away from the man’s flesh.An endless stream of tiny red and white butterflies peeled off Saint-Germain’spale skin and curled into the cool Parisian air. They circled upward, spinningaway from the small man, a seemingly never-ending spiral of crimson and ashendots. The butterflies curled around the struts and spars, the rivets and boltsof the metal tower, covering it in an iridescent, shimmering skin.“Ignis,” Saint-Germain whispered, throwing back his head and clapping his handstogether.And the Tower exploded into a cracking, sparking fountain of light.He laughed delightedly at the twins’ expressions and said, “Know me: I am leComte de Saint-Germain. I am the Master of Fire!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEEN“Fireworks,” Sophie breathed in awe.The Eiffel Tower lit up with a spectacular fireworks display. Blue and goldtraceries of light raced almost one thousand feet to the mast at the very top ofthe tower, where they blossomed into fountains of blue globes. Sparking,hissing, fizzing rainbow-colored threads wove through the struts, bursting andsnapping. The tower’s thick rivets popped with white fire, while the archingspars rained cool ice blue droplets into the street far below.The effect was dramatic, but it became truly spectacular when Saint-Germainsnapped the fingers of both hands and the entire Eiffel Tower turned bronze,then gold, then green and finally blue in the morning sun. Rattling traceries oflight darted up and down the metal. Catherine wheels and rockets, fountains andRoman candles, flying spinners and snakes spun off from every floor. The mast atthe very tip of the tower fountained red, white and blue sparks that cascadedlike bubbling liquid down through the heart of the tower.The crowd was entranced.People gathered at the base, oohing and aahing, applauding at each newexplosion, their cameras clicking furiously. Motorists stopped on the roads andclimbed out of their cars, holding camera phones to snap the stunning andbeautiful images. Within moments, the dozens of people around the tower hadgrown to a hundred and then, within a matter of minutes, had doubled and thendoubled again as people came running from shops and homes to observe theextraordinary display.And Nicholas Flamel and his companions were swallowed up by the crowd. In a rare display of emotion, Machiavelli hit the side of the car so hard ithurt his hand. He watched the growing crowd of people and knew his men would notbe able to get through in time to prevent Flamel and the others from escaping.The air sizzled and spat with fireworks; rockets went whizzing high into theair, where they exploded into spheres and streamers of light. Firecrackers andsparklers rattled around each of the tower’s four giant metal legs.“Sir!” A young police captain stopped before Machiavelli and saluted. “What areyour orders? We can push through the crowd, but there may be injuries.”Machiavelli shook his head. “No, do not do that.” Dee would do it, he knew. Deewould not hesitate to level the entire tower, killing hundreds just to captureFlamel. Drawing himself up to his full height, Niccolò could just about make outthe shape of the leather-clad Saint-Germain and the lethal Scathach herding theyoung man and woman away. They melted into the now-huge crowd and disappeared.But surprisingly, shockingly, when he looked back, Nicholas Flamel remainedwhere he had first seen him, standing almost directly beneath the center of thetower.Flamel raised his right hand in a mocking salute, the silver-link bracelet hewore reflecting the light.Machiavelli caught the police captain’s shoulder, spun him around withsurprising strength and pointed with his long narrow fingers. “That one! If youdo nothing else today, get me that one. And I want him alive and unharmed!”As they both watched, Flamel turned and hurried toward the west leg of theEiffel Tower, toward the Pont d’Iéna, but whereas the others had run across thebridge, Flamel turned to the right, onto the Quai Branly.“Yes, sir!” The captain struck out at an angle, determined to cut off Flamel.“Follow me,” he shouted, and his troops spread out in a line behind him.Dagon stepped up to Machiavelli. “Do you want me to track Saint-Germain and theShadow?” His head turned, nostrils flaring with a wet sticky sound. “I canfollow their scent.”Niccolò Machiavelli shook his head slightly as he climbed back into the car.“Get us out of here before the press turns up. Saint-Germain is nothing if notpredictable. He’s undoubtedly heading to one of his homes, and we have them allunder observation. All we can do is hope we capture Flamel.”Dagon’s face was impassive as he slammed the car door closed behind his master.He turned in the direction Flamel had run and saw him disappear amongst thecrowd. The police were close behind, moving fast even though they were weigheddown by their body armor and weapons. But Dagon knew that over the centuriesFlamel had escaped both human and inhuman hunters, had slipped past creaturesthat had been myth before the evolution of the apes and had outwitted monstersthat had no right to exist outside of nightmares. Dagon doubted that the policewould catch the Alchemyst.Then he cocked his head, nostrils flaring again, catching the scent of Scathach.The Shadow had returned!The enmity between Dagon and the Shadow went back millennia. He was the last ofhis kind…because she had destroyed his entire race one terrible night twothousand years ago. Behind his wraparound mirrored sunglasses, the creature’seyes filled with sticky colorless tears, and he swore that, no matter whathappened between Machiavelli and Flamel, this time he would have his revenge onthe Shadow. “Walk, don’t run,” Scathach commanded. “Saint-Germain, take the lead, Sophie andJosh in the middle, I’ll take up the rear.” Scatty’s tone left no room forargument.They darted across the bridge and turned right onto the Avenue de New York. Aseries of lefts and rights brought them to a narrow side street. It was stillearly, and the street was entirely in shadow. The temperature droppeddramatically, and the twins immediately noticed that the fingers ofSaint-Germain’s left hand, which were gently brushing against the dirty wall,left tiny sparks in their wake.Sophie frowned, sorting through her memories—the Witch of Endor’s memories, shereminded herself—of the Comte de Saint-Germain. She caught her brother lookingsidelong at her and raised her eyebrows in a silent question.“Your eyes turned silver. Just for a second,” he said.Sophie glanced over her shoulder to where Scathach was trailing behind and thenlooked at the man in the leather coat. They were both out of earshot, shethought. “I was trying to remember what I knew….” She shook her head. “What theWitch knew about Saint-Germain.”“What about him?” Josh said. “I’ve never heard of him.”“He is a famous French alchemist,” she whispered, “and along with Flamel,probably one of the most mysterious men in history.”“Is he human?” Josh wondered aloud, but Sophie pressed on.“He’s not an Elder or Next Generation. He’s human. Even the Witch of Endordidn’t know a lot about him. She met him for the first time in London in 1740.She knew immediately that he was an immortal human, and he claimed he’ddiscovered the secret of immortality when he was studying with Nicholas Flamel.”She shook her head quickly. “But I don’t think the Witch quite believed that. Hetold her that while traveling in Tibet he had perfected a formula forimmortality that didn’t need to be renewed each month. But when she asked himfor a copy, he told her he’d lost it. Apparently, he spoke every language in theworld fluently, was a brilliant musician and had a reputation as a jewel maker.”Her eyes blinked silver again as the memories faded. “And the Witch didn’t likeor trust him.”“Then neither should we,” Josh whispered urgently.Sophie nodded, agreeing. “But Nicholas likes him, and obviously trusts him,” shesaid slowly. “Why is that?”Josh’s expression was grim. “I’ve told you before: I don’t think we should betrusting Nicholas Flamel, either. Something’s not right about him—I’mconvinced.”Sophie bit back her response and looked away. She knew why Josh was angry withthe Alchemyst; her brother was envious of her Awakened powers, and she knew heblamed Flamel for putting her in danger. But that didn’t mean he was wrong. The narrow side street led onto a broad tree-lined avenue. Although it was stilltoo early for rush-hour, the spectacular light and fireworks display around theEiffel Tower had brought any traffic in the area to a standstill. The air wasfilled with the blare of car horns and the whooping of police sirens. A firetruck was caught in the traffic jam, its wails rising and falling, though therewas nowhere for it to go. Saint-Germain strode across the road, looking neitherleft nor right as he dug in his pocket for a slender black cell phone. Heflipped it open and hit speed dial. Then he spoke in rapid-fire French.“Are you calling for help?” Sophie asked when he had closed the phone.Saint-Germain shook his head. “Ordering breakfast. I’m famished.” He jerked histhumb back in the direction of the Eiffel Tower, which was still eruptingfireworks. “Creating something like that—if you’ll pardon the pun—burns a lot ofcalories.”Sophie nodded, understanding now why her stomach had been rumbling with hungersince she’d created the fog.Scathach caught up with the twins and fell into step alongside Sophie as theyhurried past the American Cathedral. “I don’t think we’re being followed,” shesaid, sounding surprised. “I would have expected Machiavelli to send someoneafter us.” She rubbed the edge of her thumb against her bottom lip, chewing onher ragged nails.Sophie automatically brushed Scatty’s hand away from her mouth. “Don’t bite yournails.”Scathach blinked at her in surprise, then self-consciously put her hand down.“An old habit,” she muttered. “A very old habit.”“What happens now?” Josh asked.“We get off the streets and rest,” Scathach said grimly. “Have we much fartherto go?” she called out to Saint-Germain, who was still in the lead.“A few minutes,” he said, without turning around. “One of my smaller town housesis nearby.”Scathach nodded. “Once we get there, we’ll lie low until Nicholas returns, getsome rest and a change of clothes.” She wrinkled her nose in Josh’s direction.“And a shower, too,” she added significantly.Color touched the young man’s cheeks. “Are you saying I smell?” he asked, bothembarrassed and angry.Sophie laid her hand on her brother’s arm before the Warrior could answer. “Justa little,” she said. “We probably all do.”Josh looked away, clearly upset, then glanced back at Scathach. “I don’t supposeyou smell,” he snapped.“No,” she said. “No sweat glands. The Vampire are a much more evolved speciesthan the humani.”They continued in silence until the Rue Pierre Charron opened out onto the broadChamps-Elysées, Paris’s main thoroughfare. To their left they could see the Arcde Triomphe. Traffic on both sides of the street was stopped, with driversstanding alongside their cars chatting animatedly, gesticulating wildly. Alleyes were turned to the rippling fireworks still exploding over the EiffelTower.“How do you think this will be reported on the news?” Josh said. “The EiffelTower suddenly erupting with fireworks.”Saint-Germain glanced over his shoulder. “Truth is, it’s not that out of theordinary. The tower is often lit up with fireworks—on New Year’s Eve andBastille Day, for example. I would imagine it will be reported that next month’sBastille Day fireworks went off prematurely.” He stopped and looked around,hearing someone call out his name.“Don’t look…,” Scatty began, but it was too late: the twins and Saint-Germainhad turned in the direction of the shouts.“Germain…”“Hey, Germain…”Two young men who were standing next to their unmoving car were pointing atSaint-Germain and shouting his name.Both men were dressed in jeans and T-shirts and looked alike, withslicked-backed hair and overlarge sunglasses. Abandoning their car in the middleof the road, they wove through the stalled traffic, both holding what Joshthought looked like long, narrow blades in their hands.“Francis,” Scatty warned urgently, her hands locking into fists. She movedforward just as the first man reached Saint-Germain, “let me….”“Gentlemen.” Saint-Germain turned toward the two men, smiling widely, though thetwins, who were behind him, saw yellow-blue flames dance across his fingertips.“Great concert last night,” the first man said breathlessly, speaking Englishwith a strong German accent. He pushed back his sunglasses and held out hisright hand, and Josh realized that what he’d first imagined was a knife wasnothing more than a fat pen. “Any chance I could get an autograph?”The flames on Saint-Germain’s fingers winked out. “Of course,” he said, smilingdelightedly, reaching for the pen and pulling a spiral-bound notebook from aninner pocket. “Did you get the new CD?” he asked, flipping open the notebook.The second man, wearing identical glasses, plucked a black and red iPod from theback pocket of his jeans. “Got it on iTunes yesterday,” he answered in the samedistinctive accent.“And don’t forget to check out the DVD of the show when it comes out in amonth’s time. Got some great extras, a couple of remixes and a great mashup,”Saint-Germain added as he signed his name with an elaborate flourish and pulledthe pages from the notebook. “I’d love to chat, guys, but I’m in a rush. Thanksfor stopping, I appreciate it.”They shook hands quickly and the two men hurried back to their car, high-fivingone another as they compared their autographs.Smiling broadly, Saint-Germain took a deep breath and turned to look at thetwins. “Told you I was famous.”“And you’ll soon be dead famous if we don’t get off this street,” Scathachreminded him. “Or maybe just dead.”“We’re just here,” Saint-Germain muttered. He led them across the Champs-Elyséesand down a side street, then ducked into a narrow, high-walled cobbled lane thatsnaked around the backs of the buildings. Stopping halfway down the alley, heslid a key into an anonymous-looking door set flush with the wall. The woodendoor was chipped and scarred, foul green paint peeling in long strips to revealblistered wood beneath; the bottom was splintered and cracked from rubbing theground.“May I suggest a new gate?” Scathach said.“This is the new gate.” Saint-Germain smiled quickly. “The wood is just adisguise. Beneath it is a slab of solid steel with a five-point dead bolt.” Hestepped back and allowed the twins to precede him through the entrance. “Enterfreely and of your own will,” he said formally.The twins stepped forward and were vaguely disappointed with what they found.Behind the gate was a small courtyard and a four-story building. To the left andright, tall spike-tipped walls separated the house from its neighbors. Sophieand Josh had been expecting something exotic or even dramatic, but all they sawwas an unkempt leaf-strewn rear garden. A huge and hideous stone birdbath wasset in the center of the courtyard, but instead of water, the bowl was filledwith dead leaves and the remains of a bird’s nest. All the plants in the potsand baskets surrounding the fountain at its center were dead or dying.“The gardener’s away,” Saint-Germain said without a trace of embarrassment, “andI’m really not very good with plants.” He held up his right hand and spread hisfingers. Each one popped alight with a different-colored flame. He grinned andthe colored flames painted his face in flickering shadows. “Not my specialty.”Scathach paused by the gate, looking up and down the alleyway, head tilted toone side, listening. When she was satisfied that they were not being followed,she closed the door and turned the key in the lock. The dead bolts slid intoplace with a satisfying thunk.“How will Flamel find us?” Josh asked. Even though he was wary and fearful ofthe Alchemyst, he felt even more nervous around Saint-Germain.“I gave him a little guide,” Saint-Germain explained.“Will he be all right?” Sophie asked Scathach.“I’m sure he will be,” she said, though the tone of her voice and the look inher eyes betrayed her fears. She was turning away from the gate when shestiffened, jaw unhinging, vampire teeth suddenly—terrifyingly—visible.The door to the rear of the house had opened suddenly, and a figure stepped outinto the courtyard. Abruptly, Sophie’s aura blazed silver-white, the shocksending her spinning back into her brother, bringing his aura to crackling lifeas well, outlining his body in gold and bronze. And as the twins held on to oneanother, blinded by the silver and gold light of their own auras, they heardScathach scream. It was the most terrifying sound they had ever heard."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEEN“Stop!”Nicholas Flamel kept running, turning to the right, racing down the Quai Branly.“Stop or I shoot!”Flamel knew the police wouldn’t shoot—they couldn’t. Machiavelli would not wanthim harmed.The slap of leather on concrete and the jingle of weapons were close now, and hecould hear his pursuer’s even breathing. Nicholas’s own breathing was beginningto come in great heaving gasps, and there was a stitch in his side just belowhis ribs. The recipe in the Codex kept him alive and healthy, but there was noway he could outrun this highly trained and obviously fit police officer.Nicholas Flamel stopped so suddenly that the police captain almost ran rightinto him. Standing still, the Alchemyst turned his head to look back over hisleft shoulder. The policeman had drawn an ugly black pistol and was holding itin a steady two-handed grip.“Don’t move. Raise your hands.”Nicholas turned slowly to face the police officer. “Well, make your mind up,what’s it to be?” he asked mildly.Behind his protective goggles, the man blinked at him in surprise.“Do I not move? Or do I raise my hands?”The police officer gestured with the barrel of the gun and Flamel raised hishands. Five more RAID officers came running up. They trained a variety ofweapons on the Alchemyst as they spread out in a line alongside their captain.With his hands still in the air, Nicholas turned his head slowly to look at eachof them in turn. In their black uniforms, helmets, balaclavas and goggles, theylooked like insects.“Get down on the ground. Do it, do it now!” the captain commanded. “Keep yourhands in the air.”Nicholas slowly folded to his knees.“Now lie down! Facedown!”The Alchemyst lay flat on the Parisian street, his cheek against the cool,gritty pavement.“Stretch your arms wide.”Nicholas stretched out his arms. The police officers shifted position, quicklyencircling him, but they still kept their distance.“We have him.” The police captain spoke into the microphone positioned in frontof his lips. “No, sir. We’ve not touched him. Yes, sir. Immediately.”Nicholas wished Perenelle were with him now; she would know what to do. But ifthe Sorceress had been with him, then he would not be in this mess in the firstplace. Perenelle was a fighter. How often had she urged him to stop running, touse half a millennium of his alchemical knowledge and her sorcery and magic andtake the fight to the Dark Elders? She’d wanted him to gather the immortals, theElders and the Next Generation who supported the humani and wage a war againstthe Dark Elders, Dee and his kind. But he couldn’t; he’d been waiting all hislife for the twins foretold in the Codex.“The two that are one, the one that is all.”There had never been any doubt in his mind that he would discover the twins. Theprophecies in the Codex were never wrong, but like everything else in the book,the words of Abraham were never clear and were written in a variety of archaicor forgotten languages.The two that are one, the one that is all.There will come a time when the Book is takenAnd the Queen’s man is allied with the Crow.Then the Elder will step out of the ShadowsAnd the immortal must train the mortal. The twothat are one must become the one that is all.And Nicholas knew—beyond a shadow of a doubt—that he was the immortal mentionedin the prophecy: the hook-handed man had told him.Half a millennium ago, Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel had traveled throughoutEurope in an attempt to understand the enigmatic metal-bound book. Finally, inSpain, they had met a mysterious one-handed man who had helped translateportions of the ever-changing text. The one-handed man had revealed that thesecret of Life Eternal always appeared on page seven of the Codex at the fullmoon, while the recipe for transmutation, for changing the composition of anymaterial, appeared only on page fourteen. When the one-handed man had translatedthe first prophecy, he had looked at Nicholas with coal black eyes and reachedover to tap the Frenchman’s chest with the hook that took the place of his lefthand.“Alchemyst, here is your destiny,” he had whispered.The mysterious words suggested that Flamel would one day find the twins…theprophecy hadn’t revealed that he’d end up lying spread-eagled on a dirtyParisian street surrounded by armed and very nervous police officers.Flamel closed his eyes and breathed deeply. Pressing his outspread fingersagainst the stones, he reluctantly drew upon his aura. The merest gossamerthread of green-gold energy seeped off his fingertips and soaked into thestones. Nicholas felt the tendril of his auric energy curl through the pavement,then into the earth beneath. The hair-thin thread snaked through the soil,looking…searching…and then, finally, finding what he was looking for: a seethingmass of teeming life. Then it was a simple matter of using transmutation, thebasic principal of alchemy, to create glucose and fructose and bind themtogether with a glycosidic bond to create sucrose. The life stirred, shifted,flowed toward the sweetness.The police captain raised his voice. “Cuff him. Search him.”Nicholas heard the shuffling approach of two police officers, one on eitherside. Directly in front of his face, he saw highly polished thick-soled blackleather boots.And then, magnified because of its closeness to his face, Nicholas spotted theant. It popped up out of a crack in the pavement, antennae waving. It wasfollowed by a second, and a third.The Alchemyst pressed his thumbs against the third finger of each hand andsnapped his fingers. Minuscule sparkles of mint-smelling green-gold spun intothe air, coating the six police officers in infinitesimal particles of power.Then he transmuted the particles into sugar.Abruptly, the pavement around Flamel turned black. A mass of tiny ants eruptedfrom below the street, surging up out of the cracks in the stone. Like a thickglutinous syrup, they spread across the pavement, flowing over boots beforesuddenly curling up around the legs of the police officers, coating them in aheaving swarm of insects. For a moment the men were shocked into immobility.Their suits and gloves protected them for another instant, and then one mantwitched, and another and another as the ants found the tiniest of openings inthe men’s suits and darted inside, legs tickling, jaws nipping. The men beganjerking, twisting, turning, slapping at themselves, throwing down their weapons,pulling off their gloves, tugging at their helmets, tossing aside their gogglesand balaclavas as thousands of ants crawled over their bodies.The police captain watched as their prisoner—who was completely untouched by theheaving blanket of ants—sat up and fastidiously dusted himself off before risingto his feet. The captain tried to point his gun at the man, but ants wereclawing at his wrists, tickling the palms of his hands, nipping his flesh, andhe couldn’t hold the weapon steady. He wanted to order the man to sit down, butthere were ants crawling across his lips, and he knew if he opened his mouththey would dart inside. Reaching up, brushing his helmet off his head, he jerkedoff his balaclava and flung it to the ground, arching his back as insectscrawled along his spine. He ran his hand across his head and felt it dislodge atleast a dozen ants. They fell across his face and he squeezed his eyes shut.When he opened them again, the prisoner was strolling towards the Pont de l’Almatrain station, hands in his pockets, looking as if he hadn’t a care in theworld."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTEENJosh forced his eyes open. Black spots danced in front of them, and when heraised his hand to his face, he could see the ghost of his own golden aura stillvisible around his flesh. Reaching out, he found his sister’s hand and caughtit. She squeezed gently, and he turned to find her blinking her eyes open.“What happened?” he mumbled, too shocked and numb to even be scared.Sophie shook her head. “It was like an explosion….”“I heard Scathach scream,” he added.“And I thought I saw someone coming out of the house…,” she added.They both turned back to the town house. Scathach was at the door, her armswrapped around a young woman, holding her tightly, swinging her around in acircle. Both women were laughing and squealing with delight, shouting at oneanother in rapid-fire French. “I guess they know each other,” Josh said as hehelped his sister to her feet.The twins turned to look at the Comte de Saint-Germain, who was standing to oneside, arms folded across his chest, smiling delightedly. “They’re old friends,”he explained. “They’ve not met in a long time…a very long time.” Saint-Germaincoughed. “Joan,” he said politely.The two women broke apart and the woman he’d called Joan turned to look atSaint-Germain, her head tilted at a quizzical angle. It was impossible to guessher age. Dressed in jeans and a white T-shirt, she was Sophie’s height, almostunnaturally slender, and her deeply tanned and flawless skin emphasized hugegray eyes. Her auburn hair was cut in a short boyish style. There were tears onher cheeks that she brushed away with a quick movement of her palm. “Francis?”she asked.“And these are our visitors.”Holding Scathach’s hand, the young woman stepped closer to Sophie. As the womanapproached, Sophie felt a sudden pressure in the air between them, as if someinvisible force was pushing her back, and then, abruptly, her aura flared silveraround her and the air was filled with the sweet aroma of vanilla. Josh grabbedhis sister’s arm and his own aura crackled alight, adding the scent of orangesto the air.“Sophie…Josh…,” Saint-Germain began. The rich, sweet aroma of lavender filledthe courtyard as a hissing silver aura grew around the short-haired young woman.It hardened and solidified, becoming metallic and reflective, molding itselfinto a breastplate and greaves, gloves and boots, before finally solidifyinginto a complete medieval suit of armor. “I would like to introduce my wife,Joan…”“Your wife!” Scatty squealed, shocked.“…whom you—and history—know as Joan of Arc.” Breakfast had been laid out on a long polished wooden table in the kitchen. Theair was rich with the odor of newly baked bread and brewing coffee. Plates werepiled high with fresh fruit, pancakes and scones, while sausages and eggssizzled in a pan on the old-fashioned iron range.Josh’s stomach started rumbling the moment he stepped into the room and saw thefood. His mouth filled with saliva, reminding him just how long it had beensince he’d last eaten. He’d only managed a couple of sips of the hot chocolateat the café earlier before the police arrived.“Eat, eat,” Saint-Germain said, grabbing a plate in one hand and a thickcroissant in the other. He bit into the pastry, spilling wafer-thin flakes ontothe tiled floor. “You must be famished.”Sophie leaned in close to her brother. “Could you get me something to eat? Iwant to talk to Joan. I need to ask her something.”Josh glanced quickly at the young-looking woman who was pulling cups from thedishwasher. Her short haircut made it impossible to guess her age. “Do youreally think she’s Joan of Arc?”Sophie squeezed her brother’s arm. “After all we’ve seen, what do you think?”She nodded toward the table. “I just want fruit and cereal.”“No sausage, no eggs?” he asked, surprised. His sister was the only person heknew who could eat more sausages than he could.“No.” She frowned, blue eyes clouding. “It’s funny, but even the thought ofeating meat is making me feel sick.” She grabbed a scone and turned away beforehe could comment, and approached Joan, who was pouring coffee into a tall glasscup. Sophie’s nostrils flared. “Hawaiian Kona coffee?” she asked.Joan’s gray eyes blinked in surprise and she inclined her head. “I’m impressed.”Sophie grinned and shrugged. “I worked in a coffee shop. I’d know the smell ofKona anywhere.”“I fell in love with it when we were in Hawaii,” Joan said. She spoke Englishwith the merest hint of an American accent. “I keep it for a special treat.”“I love the smell; hate the taste. Too bitter.”Joan sipped a little more coffee. “I’ll bet you didn’t come here to talk aboutcoffee?”Sophie shook her head. “No, I didn’t. I just…” She stopped. She had just metthis woman, yet she was about to ask her an incredibly personal question. “Can Iask you something?” she said quickly.“Anything,” Joan said sincerely, and Sophie believed her. She took a deep breathand her words tumbled out in a rush.“Scathach once told me you were the last person to have a pure silver aura.”“That’s why yours reacted to mine,” Joan said, wrapping both hands around thecup and staring at the girl over the rim. “I do apologize. My aura overloadedyours. I can teach you how to prevent that from happening.” She smiled,revealing straight white teeth. “Though the chances of meeting another puresilver aura in your lifetime are incredibly slim.”Sophie nibbled nervously on the blueberry scone. “Please excuse me for asking,but are you really…really Joan of Arc, the Joan of Arc?”“Yes, I really am Jeanne d’Arc.” The woman gave a short bow. “La Pucelle, theMaid of Orléans, at your service.”“But I thought…I mean, I always read that you died….”Joan dipped her head and smiled. “Scathach rescued me.” She reached out andtouched Sophie’s arm, and immediately, flickering images of Scathach on a hugeblack horse, wearing white and jet armor and wielding two blazing swords, dancedbehind her eyes.“The Shadow single-handedly fought her way through the huge crowd who hadgathered to watch my execution. No one could stand against her. In the panic,chaos and confusion, she snatched me right out from under the noses of myexecutioners.”The images flashed in Sophie’s head: Joan, wearing ragged and scorched clothing,clinging to Scathach as the Warrior maneuvered her armored black horse throughthe panicking crowd, the blazing swords in either hand clearing their path.“Of course, everyone had to say they saw Joan die,” Scatty said, joining them,carefully slicing a pineapple into neat chunks with a curved knife. “Noone—neither English nor French—was going to admit that the Maid of Orléans hadbeen snatched out from under the noses of perhaps five hundred heavily armedknights, rescued by a single female warrior.”Joan reached out and took a cube of pineapple from Scathach’s fingers and poppedit into her mouth. “Scatty took me to Nicholas and Perenelle,” she continued.“They gave me shelter, looked after me. I’d been injured in the escape and wasweakened from months of captivity. But despite Nicholas’s best attention, Iwould have died if it had not been for Scatty.” She reached over and squeezedher friend’s hand again, not seeming to notice the tears on her cheeks.“Joan had lost a lot of blood,” Scathach said. “No matter what Nicholas orPerenelle did, she was not getting any better. So Nicholas performed one of thefirst-ever blood transfusions.”“Whose blood—” Sophie started to ask, until she suddenly realized she knew theanswer. “Your blood?”“Scathach’s vampire blood saved me. And kept me alive, too—made me immortal.”Joan grinned. Sophie noted that her teeth were normal, not pointed likeScatty’s. “Luckily, it has none of the vampire side effects. Though I amvegetarian,” she added. “Have been for the last few centuries.”“And you’re married,” Scathach said accusingly. “When did that happen, and how,and why wasn’t I invited?” she demanded, all in one breath.“We got married four years ago on Sunset Beach in Hawaii, at sunset, of course.We looked everywhere for you when we decided,” Joan said quickly. “I reallywanted you there; I wanted you to be my maid of honor.”Scathach’s green eyes narrowed, remembering. “Four years ago…I think I was inNepal chasing down a rogue Nee-gued. An abominable snowman,” she added, seeingSophie’s and Joan’s blank looks.“We’d no way of contacting you. Your cell wasn’t working, and e-mails bouncedback saying your mailbox was full.” Joan caught Scathach’s hand. “Come, I havephotos I can show you.” The woman turned back to Sophie. “You should eat now.You need to replace the energy you’ve burned up. Drink plenty of liquids. Water,fruit juices, but no caffeine—no tea and no coffee, nothing that’s going to keepyou awake. Once you’ve eaten, Francis will show you to your rooms, where you canshower and rest.” She slowly looked Sophie up and down. “I’ll get you someclothes. You’re about my size. And then later we’ll talk about your aura.” Joanheld up her left hand and spread her fingers. An articulated metal glovesparkled into existence over her flesh. “I’ll show you how to control it, how toshape it, make it into anything you wish.” The glove turned into a metalraptor’s claw complete with curved talons before it faded back to Joan’s tannedflesh. Only her fingernails remained silver. She leaned in and kissed Sophiequickly on each cheek. “But first you must rest. Now,” she said, looking atScathach, “let me show you the photos.”The two women hurried from the kitchen, and Sophie made her way back down thelong room to where Saint-Germain was talking earnestly to her brother. Joshhanded her a plate piled high with fruit and bread. His own plate was heapedwith eggs and sausages. Sophie felt her stomach object at the sight and sheforced herself to look away. She nibbled on the fruit, listening to theconversation.“No, I’m human, I cannot Awaken your powers,” Saint-Germain was saying as shejoined them. “For that you need an Elder or one of the handful of NextGeneration who could do it.” He smiled, showing his misshapen teeth. “Don’tworry, Nicholas will find someone to Awaken you.”“Is there anyone here, in Paris, who could do it?”Saint-Germain took a moment to consider. “Machiavelli would know someone, I’msure. He knows everything. But I don’t.” He turned to Sophie, bowing slightly.“I understand you were lucky enough to be Awakened by the legendary Hekate andthen trained in the Magic of Air by my old teacher, the Witch of Endor.” Heshook his head. “How is the old witch? She never liked me,” he added.“Still doesn’t,” Sophie said quickly, then blushed. “I’m sorry. I don’t know whyI said that.”The Count laughed. “Oh, Sophie, you didn’t say it…well, not really. The Witchdid. It’s going to take some time for you to sort through her memories. I got acall from her this morning. She told me how she imbued you not only with theMagic of Air, but with her entire body of knowledge. The mummy technique hasn’tbeen used in living memory; it is incredibly dangerous.”Sophie glanced quickly at her brother. He was watching Saint-Germain carefully,listening to every word. She noted the tension in his neck and jaw from how hewas squeezing his mouth shut.“You should have rested for at least twenty-four hours to allow your consciousand subconscious time to sort through the sudden influx of alien memories,thoughts and ideas.”“There wasn’t time,” Sophie muttered.“Well, there is now. Eat up; then I’ll show you to your rooms. Sleep as long asyou like. You’re completely safe. No one even knows you’re here.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEEN“They’re in Saint-Germain’s town house off the Champs-Elysées.” Machiavellipressed the phone to his ear and leaned back in the black leather chair,swiveling to look through the tall window. In the distance, across the slantedtile rooftops, he could make out the tip of the Eiffel Tower. The fireworks hadfinally stopped, but a pall of rainbow-colored clouds still hung in the air.“Don’t worry, Doctor, we have the house under observation. Saint-Germain,Scathach and the twins are inside. There are no other occupants.”Machiavelli held the phone away from his ear as static rippled and crackled.Dee’s jet was just taking off from a small private airfield north of L.A. Itwould stop in New York to refuel, then fly transatlantic to Shannon in Irelandand refuel again before continuing on to Paris. The crackling faded and Dee’svoice, strong and clear, came through the phone.“And the Alchemyst?”“Lost in Paris. My men had him on the ground at gunpoint, but he somehow coatedthem in sugar and then unleashed every ant in the city onto them. They panicked;he escaped.”“Transmutation,” Dee remarked. “Water is composed of two parts hydrogen and onepart oxygen: sucrose has the same ratio. He changed the water into sugar; it’s aparlor trick—I would have expected more of him.”Machiavelli ran his hand across his short snow white hair. “I though it wasrather clever myself,” he said mildly. “He hospitalized six police officers.”“He will return to the twins,” Dee snapped. “He needs them. He’s been waitingall his life to find them.”“We’ve all been waiting,” Machiavelli reminded the Magician quietly. “And rightnow, we know where they are, which means we know where Flamel will go.”“Do nothing until I get there,” Dee commanded.“And have you any idea when that might—” Machiavelli began, but the line wasdead. He was unsure whether Dee had hung up or the call had dropped. KnowingDee, he guessed he’d hung up; that was his usual style. The tall, elegant mantapped the phone against his thin lips before replacing the handset. He had nointention of following Dee’s orders; he was going to capture Flamel and thetwins before Dee’s plane touched down in Paris. He would do what Dee had failedto do for centuries, and in return, the Elders would grant him anything hedesired.Machiavelli’s cell phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out and looked atthe screen. An unusually long string of numbers scrolled across it, looking likeno other number he’d ever seen before. The head of the DGSE frowned. Only thepresident of France, a few highly placed cabinet ministers and his own personalstaff had this number. He hit Answer but didn’t speak.“The English Magician believes you will try and capture Flamel and the twinsbefore he arrives.” The voice on the other end spoke Greek in a dialect that hadnot been used in millennia.Niccolò Machiavelli sat bolt upright in his chair. “Master?” he said.“Give Dee your full support. Do not move against Flamel until he arrives.” Theline went dead.Machiavelli carefully placed his cell phone on the bare desk and sat back.Holding both hands up before his face, he was unsurprised to find that they wereshaking slightly. The last time he’d spoken to the Elder he called Master hadbeen more than a century and a half ago. This was the Elder who had granted himimmortality at the beginning of the sixteenth century. Had Dee somehow contactedhim? Machiavelli shook his head. Highly unlikely; probably Dee had contacted hisown master and asked him to make the request. But Machiavelli’s master was oneof the most powerful of the Dark Elders…. That brought him back to a questionthat had troubled him down through the centuries: who was Dee’s master?Every human granted immortality by an Elder was bound to that Elder. An Elderwho bestowed immortality could just as easily revoke it. Machiavelli had evenseen it happen: he’d watched a healthy-looking young man wither and age in amatter of heartbeats, eventually collapsing into a pile of crackling bones anddusty skin.Machiavelli’s dossier of immortal humans was cross-linked to the Elder or DarkElder they served. There were only a very few humani—like Flamel, Perenelle andSaint-Germain—who owed no loyalty to an Elder, because they had become immortalby their own efforts.No one knew whom Dee served. But it was obviously someone more powerful thanMachiavelli’s own Dark Elder master. And that made Dee all the more dangerous.Leaning forward, Machiavelli pressed a button on his desk phone. The doorimmediately opened and Dagon stepped into the room, his mirrored sunglassesreflecting the bare walls.“Any reports on the Alchemyst?”“Nothing. We’ve accessed the video from the security cameras in the Pont del’Alma station and every station it connects with and we’re analyzing it now,but it’s going to take time.”Machiavelli nodded. Time was something he did not have. He waved a long-fingeredhand in the air. “Well, we might not know where he is now, but we know wherehe’s going: to Saint-Germain’s house.”Dagon’s lips parted stickily. “The house is under observation. All entrances andexits are secured; there are even men in the sewers beneath the building. No onecan get in or out without us observing them. There are two RAID units in vans innearby side streets and a third unit in the house next to Saint-Germain’sproperty. They can be over the wall in moments.”Machiavelli stood up and stepped out from behind the desk. With his hands behindhis back, he walked around the tiny anonymous office. Although it was hisofficial address, he rarely used this room, and it held nothing but the desk,two chairs, and the telephone. “But is it enough, I wonder? Flamel has escapedfrom six highly trained officers who were holding him at gunpoint, facedown onthe pavement. And we know Saint-Germain—the Master of Fire—is inside thisproperty. We had a little example of his abilities this morning.”“The fireworks were harmless,” Dagon said.“I’m sure he could have just as easily turned the tower to liquid. Remember, hemakes diamonds from coal.”Dagon nodded.Machiavelli continued. “We also know that the American girl’s powers have beenAwakened, and we’ve seen a little of what she can do. The fog at Sacré-Coeur wasan impressive feat for someone untrained and so young.”“And then there is the Shadow,” Dagon added.Niccolò Machiavelli’s face turned into an ugly mask. “And then there is theShadow,” he agreed.“She took out twelve heavily armed officers in the coffee shop this morning,”Dagon said emotionlessly. “I’ve watched her face down entire armies, and shesurvived for centuries in an Underworld Shadowrealm. Flamel is obviously usingher to protect the twins. She must be destroyed before we move against any ofthe others.”“Indeed.”“You will need an army.”“Perhaps not. Remember, ‘Cunning and deceit will every time serve a man betterthan force,’” he quoted.“Who said that?” Dagon asked.“I did, in a book, a long time ago. It was true in the court of the Medicis, andit is true now.” He looked up. “Did you send for the Disir?”“They’re on their way.” Dagon’s voice turned sticky. “I don’t trust them.”“No one trusts the Disir.” There was no humor in Machiavelli’s smile. “Did youever hear the story of how Hekate trapped Scathach in that Underworld?”Dagon remained unmoving.“Hekate used the Disir. Their feud with the Shadow goes back to the time justafter the sinking of Danu Talis.” Putting his hands on the creature’s shoulders,Machiavelli stepped close to Dagon, taking care to breathe through his mouth.Dagon exuded a fishy odor; it coated his pale skin like oily, rancid sweat. “Iknow you hate the Shadow, and I have never asked you why, though I have mysuspicions. It is obvious that she has caused you much pain. However, I want youto put aside your feelings; hate is the most useless of all emotions. Success isthe best revenge. I need you focused and by my side. We are close now, so closeto victory, close to returning the Elder Race to this world. Leave Scathach tothe Disir. But if they fail, then she is yours. I promise you.”Dagon opened his mouth to reveal the circle of needle-pointed teeth. “They willnot fail. The Disir intend to bring Nidhogg.”Niccolò Machiavelli blinked in surprise. “Nidhogg…it’s free? How?”“The World Tree was destroyed.”“If they loose Nidhogg on Scathach, then you are right. They will not fail. Theycannot.”Dagon reached up and pulled off his sunglasses. His huge bulbous fish eyes werewide and staring. “And if they lose control of Nidhogg, it could devour theentire city.”Machiavelli took a moment to consider. Then he nodded. “It would be a smallprice to pay to destroy the Shadow.”“You sound just like Dee.”“Oh, I am nothing like the English Magician,” Machiavelli said feelingly. “Deeis a dangerous fanatic.”“And you’re not?” Dagon asked.“I’m only dangerous.” Dr. John Dee sat back into the soft leather seat and watched the sparkling gridof L.A.’s lights fall away beneath him. Checking an ornate pocket watch, hewondered if Machiavelli had received the phone call from his master yet. Heimagined he had. Dee grinned, wondering what the Italian would make of that. Ifnothing else, it would at least show Machiavelli who was in charge.It didn’t take a genius to realize that the Italian would go after Flamel andthe children himself. But Dee had spent too long chasing the Alchemyst to losehim at the very end…especially to someone like Niccolò Machiavelli.He closed his eyes as the plane rose and his stomach twitched. He automaticallyreached for the paper bag on the seat beside him: he loved flying, but hisstomach always protested. If everything went as planned, then he would soon bethe ruler of the entire planet and he’d never need to fly again. Everyone wouldcome to him.The jet climbed at a steep angle and he swallowed hard; he’d had a chicken wrapin the airport and was regretting it now. The fizzy drink had been a definitemistake.Dee was looking forward to the time when the Elders returned. Perhaps they couldreestablish the network of leygates across the world and make flyingunnecessary. Closing his eyes, Dee concentrated on the Elders and the manybenefits they would bring to the planet. In the distant past, he knew the Eldershad created a paradise on earth. All the ancient books and scrolls, the mythsand legends of every race, spoke about that glorious time. His master hadpromised him that the Elders would use their powerful magic to return the planetto that paradise. They would reverse the effects of global warming, repair thehole in the ozone layer and bring the deserts to life. The Sahara would bloom;the polar ice caps would melt away, revealing the rich land beneath. Dee thoughthe would found his capital city in Antarctica on the shores of Lake Vanda. TheElders could reestablish their ancient kingdoms in Sumer, Egypt, Central Americaand Angkor, and with the knowledge contained in the Book of Abraham, it would bepossible to raise Danu Talis again.Of course, Dee knew that the human population would become slaves, and somewould become food for those Elders who still needed to eat, but that was a smallprice to pay for the many other benefits.The jet leveled and he felt his stomach settle. Opening his eyes, he breatheddeeply and checked his watch again. He found it hard to believe that he washours—literally hours—away from finally capturing the Alchemyst, Scathach and,now, the twins. They were an added bonus. Once he had Flamel and the pages fromthe Codex, the world would change.He would never understand why Flamel and his wife had worked so hard to preventthe Elders from bringing civilization back to earth. But he’d be sure to askhim…just before he killed him."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETEENNicholas Flamel paused on the Rue Beaubourg and turned slowly, pale eyesscanning the street. He didn’t think he was being followed, but he needed to becertain. He’d taken the train to the Saint-Michel Notre-Dame station and crossedthe Seine on the Pont d’Arcole, heading in the direction of the glass-and-steelmonstrosity that was the Pompidou Center. Taking his time, stopping often,darting from one side of the road to the other, pausing at a newsstand to buythe morning paper, stopping again for some foul coffee in a cardboard cup, hekept checking for anyone paying close attention to his movements. But as far ashe could determine, there was no one following him.Paris had changed since he’d last been in the city, and though he now called SanFrancisco home, this was the city of his birth and would always be his city.Only a couple of weeks ago, Josh had loaded Google Earth onto the computer inthe bookshop’s back room and shown him how to use it. Nicholas had spent hourslooking down on the streets he’d once walked, finding buildings he’d known inhis youth, even discovering the location of the Church of the Holy Innocents,where he’d supposedly been buried.He had been particularly interested in one street. He’d found it on the mapprogram and virtually walked down it, never realizing that he would soon do soin reality.Nicholas Flamel turned left off the Rue Beaubourg onto the Rue deMontmorency—and stopped as suddenly as if he had walked into a wall.He drew a deep shuddering breath, conscious that his heart was pounding. Thewash of emotions was extraordinarily powerful. The street was so narrow that themorning sunlight didn’t reach it, leaving it in shadow. It was lined on bothsides with tall, mostly white-and-cream-colored buildings, many of them withhanging baskets spilling flowers and greenery across the walls. Round-toppedblack metal poles had been inserted into the sidewalk on both sides of thestreet to prevent cars from stopping.Nicholas walked slowly down the street, seeing it as it had once been.Remembering.More than six hundred years ago, he and Perenelle had lived on this street.Images of medieval Paris flickered behind his eyes, a jumbled mismatched mess ofwooden and stone houses; narrow winding lanes; rotten bridges; tumbled listingbuildings and streets that were little better than open sewers. The noise, theincredible, incessant noise, and the foul miasma that hung over the city—amixture of unwashed disease-ridden humans and filthy animals—were things hewould never forget.At the bottom of the Rue de Montmorency, he found the building he had beenlooking for.It hadn’t changed much. The stone had once been cream; now it was ancient,chipped and weathered, stained black with soot. The three wooden windows anddoors were new, but the building itself was one of the oldest in Paris. Directlyabove the middle door was a number in blue metal—51—and above that was atired-looking stone sign announcing that this had once been the MAISON DENICOLAS FLAMEL ET DE PERENELLE, SA FEMME. A red sign in the shape of a shieldannounced that this was the AUBERGE NICOLAS FLAMEL. Now it was a restaurant.Once it had been his home.Stepping up to the window, he pretended to read the menu as he peered inside.The interior had been completely remodeled, of course, countless times probably,but the dark beams that stretched across the white ceiling appeared to be thesame beams he’d so often looked up at more than six hundred years ago.He and Perenelle had been happy here, he realized.And safe.Their lives had been simpler then: they hadn’t known about the Elders or theDark Elders; they’d known nothing of the Codex, or of the immortals who guardedand fought over it.And both he and Perenelle had still been fully human.The ancient stones of the house had been carved with an assortment of images,symbols and letters that he knew had puzzled and intrigued scholars down throughthe ages. Most were meaningless, little more than the shop signs of their day,but there were one or two that had special significance. Quickly glancing leftand right and finding the narrow street empty, he reached up with his right handand traced the outline of the letter N, which was cut into the stone to the leftof the middle window. Green power curled around the letter. Then he traced theornate F on the opposite side of the window, leaving a shimmering outline of theletter in the air. Catching hold of the window frame with his left hand, hehauled himself up onto the ledge and reached over his head with his right hand,his fingers finding the shapes of letters in the ancient stone. Allowing thetiniest trickle of his aura to flow through his fingers, he pressed a sequenceof letters…and the stone beneath his flesh turned warm and soft. He pushed…andhis fingers sank into the stone. They wrapped around the object he had secretedwithin the solid block of granite back in the fifteenth century. Pulling itfree, he stepped off the window ledge and dropped lightly to the ground, quicklywrapping his copy of Le Monde around the object. Then he turned and headed downthe street without so much as a backward glance.Before he stepped out onto the Rue Beaubourg, Nicholas turned over his lefthand. Nestled in the center of his palm was the perfect impression of the blackbutterfly Saint-Germain had pressed into his skin. “It will lead you back tome,” he’d said.Nicholas Flamel brushed his right forefinger over the tattoo. “Take me back toSaint-Germain,” he murmured. “Bring me to him.”The tattoo shivered on his skin, black wings rippling. Then it suddenly peeledaway from his flesh and hung flapping in the air before him. A moment later, itdanced and wove down the street. “Clever,” Nicholas muttered, “very clever.” Andhe set off after it."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTYPerenelle Flamel stepped out of the prison cell.The door had never been locked. There was no need: nothing could get past thesphinx. But now the sphinx was gone. Perenelle breathed deeply: the sour odor ofthe creature, the musty combination of snake, lion and bird, had lessened,allowing the usual smells of Alcatraz—salt and rusting metal, seaweed andcrumbling stone—to take over. She turned to the left, moving swiftly down a longcell-lined corridor. She was on the Rock, but she had no idea where she waswithin the huge crumbling complex. Although she and Nicholas had lived in SanFrancisco for years, she had never been tempted to visit the ghost-hauntedisland. All she knew was that she was deep below the surface of the earth. Theonly light came from an irregular scattering of low-wattage bulbs set behindwire cages. Perenelle’s lips twisted in a wry smile; the light was not for herbenefit. The sphinx was afraid of the dark; the creature came from a time andplace where there really were monsters in the shadows.The sphinx had been lured away by the ghost of Juan Manuel de Ayala. She hadgone in search of the mysterious noises, the rattling bars and slamming doorsthat had suddenly filled the building. Every moment the sphinx was away from hercell, Perenelle’s aura recharged. She wasn’t back up to full strength—she wouldneed to sleep and eat first—but at least she was no longer defenseless. All shehad to do was to keep out of the creature’s way.A door slammed somewhere high above her, and Perenelle froze as clawsclick-clacked. Then a bell began to toll, slow and solemn, lonely and distant.There was a sudden clatter of iron-hard nails on stone as the sphinx raced offto investigate.Perenelle folded her arms across her body and ran her hands up and down them,shivering slightly. She was wearing a sleeveless summer dress, and normallyshe’d be able to regulate her temperature by adjusting her aura, but she hadvery little power left and she was reluctant to use it in any way. One of thesphinx’s special talents was her ability to sense and then feed off magicalenergy.Perenelle’s flat sandals made no sound on the damp stones as she moved down thecorridor. She was wary, but not frightened. Perenelle Flamel had lived for morethan six hundred years, and while Nicholas had been fascinated with alchemy, shehad concentrated on sorcery. Her research had taken her into some very dark anddangerous places, not only on this earth, but also in some of the adjoiningShadowrealms.Somewhere in the distance, glass shattered and tinkled to the ground. She heardthe sphinx hiss and howl in frustration, but that sound too was far away.Perenelle smiled: de Ayala was keeping the sphinx busy, and no matter how hardshe looked, she would never find him. Even a creature as powerful as a sphinxhad no power over a ghost or a poltergeist.Perenelle knew that she needed to get to an upper level and out into thesunshine, where her aura would recharge more quickly. Once she was in the openair, she could use any of a dozen simple spells, cantrips and incantations sheknew that would make the sphinx’s existence a misery. A Scythian mage, who’dclaimed to have helped build the pyramids for the survivors of Danu Talis whohad settled in Egypt, had taught her a very useful spell for melting stone.Perenelle would not hesitate to use it to bring the entire building down on topof the sphinx. It would probably survive—sphinxes were practically impossible tokill—but it would certainly be slowed down.Perenelle spotted rusting metal stairs and darted toward them. She was justabout to put her foot on the bottom step when she noticed the gray threadspilling across the metal. Perenelle froze, foot raised in the air…and then sheslowly and carefully stepped back. Crouching down, she looked at the metalsteps. From this angle, she could see the threads of spiderwebs crisscrossingand weaving through the stairs. Anyone who stepped onto the metal staircasewould be caught. She backed away, staring hard into the gloomy shadows. Thethreads were too thick to have been made by any normal spider and were dottedwith tiny globules of liquid silver. Perenelle knew a dozen creatures that couldhave spun the webs, and she didn’t want to meet any of them, not here and now,while she was so drained of her power.Turning, she darted down a long corridor lit only by a single bulb at eitherend. Now that she knew what she was looking for, she could see the silver webseverywhere, stretched across the ceiling, spreading across the walls, and therewere huge nests knotted in corners, growing in the deepest shadows. The webs’presence might explain why she had encountered no vermin in the prison—no ants,flies, mosquitoes or rats. Once the nests hatched, the building would come alivewith spiders…if indeed that’s what the spinners were. Over the centuries,Perenelle had encountered Elders who were associated with spiders, includingArachne and the mysterious and terrifying Spider Woman, but as far as she knew,none of them was aligned with Dee and the Dark Elders.Perenelle was hurrying past an open door, a perfect spiderweb framed in theopening, when she caught the hint of a sour bitter stench. She slowed, thenstopped. The smell was new; it wasn’t the smell of the sphinx. Turning back tothe door, she went as close as she could to the web without touching it andpeered inside. It took her eyes a moment to adjust to the darkness and a momentlonger to make sense of what she was seeing.Vetala.Perenelle’s heart began to beat so strongly in her chest that she could actuallyfeel her flesh vibrating. Hanging upside down from the ceiling were a dozencreatures. Talons that were a cross between human feet and birds’ claws bit deepinto the soft stone, while leathery bats’ wings wrapped around skeletal humanbodies. The upside-down heads were beautiful, with the faces of young men andwomen not yet in their teens.Vetala.Perenelle mouthed the word silently. Vampires from the Indian subcontinent. Andunlike Scathach, this clan drank blood and ate flesh. But what were they doinghere, and more importantly, how had they gotten here? Vetala were always linkedto a region or tribe: Perenelle had never known one to leave its homeland.The Sorceress turned slowly to look at the other open doorways lining the gloomycorridor. What else lay hidden in the cells beneath Alcatraz?What was Dr. John Dee planning?"},{"pageContent":"SUNDAY,3rd June"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONESophie’s ragged scream pulled Josh from a deep and dreamless sleep and rolledhim out of bed, leaving him swaying on his feet, trying to get his bearings incomplete darkness.Sophie screamed again, the sound raw and terrifying.Josh blundered across the bedroom, banging his knees on a chair before hediscovered the door, visible only because of the thin strip of light beneath it.His sister was in the room directly across the corridor.Earlier, Saint-Germain had escorted them upstairs and given them their choice ofrooms on the top floor of the town house. Sophie had immediately picked the oneoverlooking the Champs-Elysées—from the bedroom window, she could actually seethe Arc de Triomphe over the rooftops—while Josh had taken the room across thehall, which looked over the dried-up rear garden. The rooms were small, with lowceilings and uneven, slightly sloping walls, but each had its own bathroom witha minuscule shower cubicle that had only two settings—scalding and freezing.When Sophie had run the water in her room, Josh’s shower stopped workingaltogether. And although he’d promised his sister that he would come talk to herafter he’d showered and changed, he’d sat on the edge of his bed and almostimmediately fallen into an exhausted sleep.Sophie screamed for a third time, a shuddering sob that brought tears to hiseyes.Josh jerked open his door and ran across the narrow corridor. He pushed open thedoor to his sister’s room…and stopped.Joan of Arc was sitting on the edge of his sister’s bed, holding Sophie’s handin both of hers. There were no lights in the room, but it was not in totaldarkness. Joan’s hand was glowing with cool silvery light and it looked like shewas wearing a soft gray glove. As he watched, his sister’s hand took on the sametexture and color. The air smelled of vanilla and lavender.Joan turned to look at Josh, and he was startled to discover that her eyes wereglowing silver coins. He took a step toward the bed, but she raised a finger toher lips and shook her head slightly, warning him not to say anything. The glowfaded from her eyes. “Your sister is dreaming,” Joan said, though he wasn’t surewhether she had spoken aloud or if he was hearing her voice in his head. “Thenightmare is already passing. It will not return,” she said, making the sentenceinto a promise.Wood creaked behind Josh and he whirled to see the Comte de Saint-Germain comingdown a narrow staircase at the end of the hall. Francis gestured to Josh fromthe bottom of the stairs, and although his lips didn’t move, the boy clearlyheard his voice: “My wife will take care of your sister. Come away.”Josh shook his head. “I should stay.” He didn’t want to leave Sophie alone withthe strange woman, but he also knew instinctively that Joan would never harm hissister.“There is nothing you can do for her,” Saint-Germain said aloud. “Get dressedand come up to the attic. I have my office there.” He turned away anddisappeared back up the stairs.Josh took a last look at Sophie. She was resting quietly, her breathing hadslowed and he noticed that the dark rings had disappeared from beneath her eyes.“Go now,” Joan said. “There are some things I have to say to your sister.Private things.”“She’s asleep…,” Josh began.“But I will still say them,” the woman murmured. “And she will still hear me.”In his room, Josh dressed quickly. A bundle of clothes had been laid on a chairbeneath the window: underwear, jeans, T-shirts and socks. He guessed the clothesbelonged to Saint-Germain: they were about the count’s size. Josh dressedquickly in a pair of black designer jeans and a black silk T-shirt beforeslipping into his own shoes and taking a quick look in the mirror. He was unableto resist a smile; he’d never imagined himself wearing such expensive clothes.In the bathroom, he cracked open a new toothbrush from its packaging, brushedhis teeth, splashed cold water on his face and ran his fingers through hisoverlong blond hair, pulling it back off his forehead. Strapping on his watch,he was shocked to discover that it was a little after midnight on Sundaymorning. He’d slept the entire day and most of the night.When he left the bedroom, he stopped at the door to his sister’s room and lookedinside. The smell of lavender was so strong it made his eyes water. Sophie layunmoving on the bed, her breathing regular and even. Joan remained beside her,holding her hand, murmuring softly, but not in any language he could understand.The woman turned her head slowly to look at him, and he discovered that her eyeswere once again flat silver discs, without any hint of white or pupil. Sheturned back to Sophie.Josh stared at them for a moment before turning away. When the Witch of Endorhad instructed Sophie in the Magic of Air, he had been dismissed; now he’d beendismissed again. He was quickly realizing that in this new magical world, therewas no place for someone like him, someone without power.Josh slowly climbed the narrow winding stairs that led up to Saint-Germain’soffice. Whatever Josh had been expecting to find in the attic, it was not thehuge brightly lit white wood and chrome room. The attic ran the length of theentire house and had been remodeled into one vast open space, with an archedwindow looking over the Champs-Elysées at one end. The enormous room was filledwith electronics and musical instruments, but there was no sign ofSaint-Germain.Against the right wall, a long table stretched from one end of the space to theother. It was piled high with computers, both desktops and laptops, screens ofall shapes and sizes, synthesizers, a mixing desk, keyboards and electronic drumkits.On the opposite side of the room a trio of electric guitars were perched onstands, while an assortment of keyboards were arranged around an enormous LCDscreen.“How do you feel?” Saint-Germain asked.It took Josh a second to identify where the voice was coming from. The musicianwas lying flat on his back under the table, a bundle of USB cables in his hands.“Good,” Josh said, and was surprised to find that it was true. He felt betterthan he had in a long time. “I don’t even remember lying down….”“You were both exhausted, physically and mentally. And I understand the leygatessuck every last drop of energy from you. Not that I’ve ever traveled throughone,” he added. “To be truthful, I was surprised you were still on your feet,”Saint-Germain muttered as he dropped the cables. “You’ve slept for aboutfourteen hours.”Josh knelt alongside Saint-Germain. “What are you trying to do?”“I moved a monitor and the cable fell out; I’m not sure which one it is.”“You should color code them with tape,” Josh said. “That’s what I do.”Straightening, he caught the end of the cable that was attached to thewide-screen monitor and jerked it up and down. “It’s this one.” The cabletwitched in Saint-Germain’s hands.“Thanks!”The monitor suddenly flickered to life, displaying a screen filled with slidersand knobs.Saint-Germain climbed to his feet and dusted himself off. He was wearing clothesidentical to Josh’s. “They fit.” He nodded. “And they look good on you. Youshould wear black more often.”“Thanks for the clothes….” He stopped. “I don’t know how we’re going to be ableto pay you back, though.”Francis laughed quickly. “They weren’t a loan, they were a gift. I don’t wantthem back.”Before Josh could thank him again, Saint-Germain hit the keyboard and Joshjumped as a series of heavy piano chords thumped out from hidden speakers.“Don’t worry, the attic is soundproofed,” Saint-Germain said. “It’ll not wakeSophie.”Josh nodded at the screen. “Do you write all your music on computer?”“Just about.” Saint-Germain looked around the room. “Anyone can make music now;you don’t need much more than a computer, some software, patience and a lot ofimagination. If I need some real instruments for a final mix, I’ll hiremusicians. But I can do most things here.”“I downloaded some beat-detection software once,” Josh admitted. “But I couldnever get it right.”“What do you compose?”“Well, I’m not sure you’d call it composing…. I put together some ambientmixes.”“I’d love to listen to anything you have.”“It’s all gone. I lost my computer, my cell phone and my iPod when Yggdrasillwas destroyed.” Even saying it aloud made him feel sick. And the worst part wasthat he really had no idea exactly what he’d lost. “I lost my summer project andall my music, and that was about ninety gigs. I had some great bootlegs. I’llnever be able to replace them.” He sighed. “I also lost hundreds of photos; allthe places Mom and Dad took us. Our parents are scientists—they’rearchaeologists and paleontologists,” he added, “so we’ve seen some amazingplaces.”“Lost everything! That’s got to be tough,” Saint-Germain sympathized. “Whatabout backups?”The stricken look on Josh’s face was all the answer the count needed.“Were you a Mac or a PC user?”“Both, actually. Dad uses PCs at home, but most of the schools Sophie and I havegone to use Macs. Sophie loves her Macs, but I prefer a PC,” he said. “Ifanything goes wrong, I can usually pull it apart and fix it myself.”Saint-Germain walked to the end of the table and rummaged around underneath it.He pulled out three laptops, different brands and screen sizes, and lined themup on the floor. He gestured dramatically. “Take one.”Josh blinked at him in surprise. “Take one?”“They’re all PCs,” Saint-Germain continued, “and they’re no use to me. I’vecompletely switched over to Macs now.”Josh looked from Saint-Germain to the laptops and back to the musician again.He’d just met this man, didn’t know him, and here he was offering Josh a choiceof three expensive laptops. He shook his head. “Thanks, but I couldn’t.”“Why not?” Saint-Germain demanded.And Josh had no answer for that.“You need a computer. I’m offering you one of these. I would be pleased if youtook it.” Saint-Germain smiled. “I grew up in an age when gift giving was anart. I have found that people in this century really do not know how to accept agift gracefully.”“I don’t know what to say.”“How about thank you?” Saint-Germain suggested.Josh grinned. “Yes. Well…thank you,” he said hesitantly. “Thank you very much.”Even as he was speaking, he knew which machine he wanted: the tinyone-inch-thick laptop with an eleven-inch screen.Saint-Germain dug around under the table and extracted three power cords that hedropped onto the floor alongside the machines. “I’m not using them. They’llprobably never be used again. I’ll end up reformatting the hard drives andgiving the machines to the local schools. Take whichever one you like. You’llfind a backpack under the table too.” He paused, blue eyes twinkling, and tappedthe back of the machine Josh was looking at, then added with a grin, “I’ve aspare long-life battery for this one. That was my favorite.”“Well, if you’re really not using them…”Saint-Germain ran a finger across the back of the small laptop, tracing a linein the dust, holding it up so that Josh could see the black mark on hisfingertip. “Trust me: I’m not using them.”“OK…thanks. I mean, thank you. No one’s ever given me a present like thisbefore,” he said, picking up the small computer and turning it over in hishands. “I’ll take this one…if you’re really sure….”“I’m sure. It’s fully loaded; got wireless, too, and it’ll autoconvert the powerfor European and American current. Plus, it’s got all my albums on it,”Saint-Germain said, “so you can start your music collection again. You’ll alsofind an mpeg of the last concert. Check it out; it’s really good.”“I’ll do that,” Josh said, plugging in the laptop to charge the battery.“Let me know what you think. And you can be honest with me,” Saint-Germainadded.“Really?”The count took a moment to consider, and then he shook his head. “No, notreally. Only tell me if you think I’m good. I don’t like negative reviews,though you’d think that after nearly three hundred years, I’d be used to them.”Josh opened the laptop and turned it on. The machine whined and flickered tolife. Leaning forward, he gently blew dust off the keyboard. When the laptopbooted, the screen flickered and showed an image of Saint-Germain onstage,surrounded by a dozen instruments. “You have a picture of yourself for yourwallpaper?” Josh asked incredulously.“It’s one of my favorites,” the musician said.Josh nodded toward the screen and then looked around the room. “Can you play allthese?”“Every one. I started on the violin a long time ago, then moved on toharpsichord and flute. But I’ve kept up with the times, always learning newinstruments. In the eighteenth century, I was using the latest technology—thenew violins, the latest keyboards—and here I am, nearly three hundred yearslater, still doing that. This is a great time to be a musician. And withtechnology, I can finally play all the sounds I hear in my head.” His fingersbrushed a keyboard and a full choir sang from the speakers.Josh jumped. The voices were so clear that he actually looked over his shoulder.“I load up the computer with sound samples, so I can use anything in my work.”Saint-Germain turned back to the screen and his fingers danced on the keys.“Don’t you think those fireworks yesterday morning made some great sounds?Crackling. Snapping. Maybe it’s time for another Fireworks Suite.”Josh walked around the room, looking at the framed gold records, the signedposters and CD sleeves. “I didn’t know there was one already,” he said.“George Frideric Handel, 1749, Music for the Royal Fireworks. What a night thatwas! What music!” Saint-Germain’s fingers moved across a keyboard, filling theroom with a tune Josh thought sounded vaguely familiar. Maybe he’d heard it on aTV ad. “Good old George,” Saint-Germain said. “I never liked him.”“The Witch of Endor doesn’t like you,” Josh said hesitantly. “Why?”Saint-Germain grinned. “The Witch doesn’t like anyone. She especially doesn’tlike me because I became immortal through my own efforts and, unlike Nicholasand Perry, I don’t need any recipe from a book to remain undying.”Josh frowned. “You mean there are different types of immortality?”“Many different types, and as many different types of immortals. The mostdangerous are those who became immortal because of their loyalty to an Elder. Ifthey fall from favor with the Elder, the gift is rescinded, of course.” Hesnapped his fingers and Josh jumped. “The result is instant old age. Ancientage. It’s a great way of ensuring loyalty.” He turned back to the keyboard andhis fingers drew a haunting breathy sound from the speakers. He looked up asJosh joined him in front of the screen. “But the real reason the Witch of Endordoesn’t like me is because I—an ordinary mortal—became the Master of Fire.” Heheld up his left hand and a different-colored flame danced at the tip of eachfinger. The attic studio suddenly smelled of burnt leaves.“And why would that bother her?” Josh asked, staring entranced at the dancingflames. He wanted—desperately wanted—to be able to do something like that.“Maybe because I learned the secret of fire from her brother.” The musicchanged, becoming discordant and harsh. “Well, when I say learned, I shouldreally say stole.”“You stole the secret of fire!” Josh said.The Comte de Saint-Germain nodded happily. “From Prometheus.”“And one of these days my uncle will want it back.” Scathach’s voice made themboth jump. Neither had heard her enter the room. “Nicholas is here,” she said,and turned away."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-TWONicholas Flamel was sitting at the head of the kitchen table, both hands wrappedaround a steaming mug of soup. In front of him was a half-empty bottle ofPerrier, a tall glass and a plate piled high with thick-crust bread and cheese.He looked up, nodded and smiled as Josh and Saint-Germain followed Scathach intothe room.Sophie was sitting on one side of the table, facing Joan of Arc, and Joshquickly slid into the seat beside his sister while Saint-Germain took the seatalongside his wife. Only Scathach remained standing, leaning against the sinkbehind the Alchemyst, staring out into the night. Josh noted that she was stillwearing the bandana she had cut from Flamel’s loose black T-shirt.Josh turned his attention to the Alchemyst. The man looked exhausted and old,and there seemed to be a dusting of silver in his close-cropped hair that hadn’tbeen there earlier. His skin was also shockingly pale, emphasizing thebruise-black circles beneath his eyes and the deep lines in his forehead. Hisclothes were rumpled and speckled with rain, and there was a long muddy streakon the sleeve of the jacket he’d hung off the back of the wooden chair. Waterdroplets sparkled on the worn leather.No one spoke while the Alchemyst finished the soup and then broke off chunks ofthe cheese and bread. He chewed slowly and methodically, then poured water fromthe green bottle into the glass and drank in short sips. When he was finished,he wiped his lips on a napkin and allowed himself a sigh of satisfaction. “Thankyou.” He nodded to Joan. “That was perfect.”“There is a larder full of food, Nicholas,” she said, her gray eyes huge andconcerned. “You really should have more than soup, bread and cheese.”“It was enough,” he said gently. “Right now I need to rest, and I didn’t want toput a lot of food in my stomach. We shall have a big breakfast in the morning.I’ll even cook it myself.”“I didn’t know you could cook,” Saint-Germain said.“He can’t,” Scathach muttered.“I thought eating cheese late at night gave you nightmares,” Josh said. Heglanced at his watch. “It’s close to one in the morning.”“Oh, I don’t need cheese to see nightmares. I’ve seen them in the flesh.”Nicholas smiled, though there was no humor in it. “They’re not so scary.” Helooked from Josh to Sophie. “You’re safe and well?”The twins glanced at one another and nodded.“And rested?”“They slept all day and most of the night,” Joan said.“Good,” Flamel nodded. “You’re going to need all your strength. And I like theclothes.” While Josh was dressed identically to Saint-Germain, Sophie waswearing a heavy white cotton blouse and blue jeans with the ends turned up toreveal ankle-high boots.“Joan gave them to me,” Sophie explained.“Almost a perfect fit,” the older woman said. “We’ll go through my wardrobeshortly, get you some changes for the rest of your journey.”Sophie smiled her thanks.Nicholas turned to Saint-Germain. “The fireworks on the Eiffel Tower yesterday:inspired, just inspired.”The count bowed. “Thank you, Master,” he said, looking tremendously pleased withhimself.Joan’s giggle was a low purr. “He’s been looking for an excuse to do somethinglike that for months. You should have seen the display he set off in Hawaii whenwe were married. We waited until the sun went down; then Francis lit up the skyfor nearly an hour. It was so beautiful, though the effort exhausted him for aweek,” she added with a grin.Two spots of color touched the count’s cheeks and he reached over to squeeze hiswife’s hand. “It was worth it to see the look on your face.”“You hadn’t mastered fire the last time we met,” Nicholas said slowly. “If Irecall, you had some little ability with it, but nothing like the power youdemonstrated yesterday. Who trained you?”“I spent some time in India, in the lost city of Ophir,” the count responded,glancing quickly at the Alchemyst. “They still remember you there. Did you knowthey erected a statue to you and Perenelle in the main square?”“I didn’t. I promised Perenelle I’d take her back there someday,” Nicholas saidwistfully. “But what has that got to do with your mastery of fire?”“I met someone there…someone who trained me,” Saint-Germain said enigmatically.“Showed me how to use all the secret knowledge I’d gleaned from Prometheus…”“Stolen,” Scathach corrected.“Well, he stole it first,” Saint-Germain snapped.Flamel’s hand hit the table with enough force to rattle the bottle of water.Only Scathach didn’t jump. “Enough!” he barked, and for an instant, the planesand angles of his face altered, cheekbones suddenly prominent, hinting at theskull beneath the flesh. His almost colorless eyes visibly darkened, turninggray, then brown and finally black. Resting his elbows on the table, he rubbedhis face with the palms of both hands and took a deep shuddering breath. Therewas the faintest hint of mint in the air, but it was a sour bitter odor. “I’msorry. That was inexcusable. I should not have raised my voice,” he said quietlyinto the shocked silence that followed. When he took his hands away from hisface, his lips moved into a smile that did not quite reach his eyes. He lookedat each of them in turn, his gaze lingering on the twins’ stunned faces. “Youmust forgive me. I’m tired now, so tired; I could sleep for a week. Continue,Francis, please. Who trained you?”The Comte de Saint-Germain took a breath. “He told me…he said that I was neverto speak his name aloud,” he finished in a rush.Flamel placed his elbows on the table, wrapped the fingers of both handstogether and rested his chin on his knotted fists. He stared at the musician,his face impassive. “Who was it?” he demanded firmly.“I gave him my word,” Saint-Germain said miserably. “It was one of theconditions he imposed when he trained me. He said there was a power in words andthat certain names set up vibrations both in this world and the Shadowrealms andattracted unwelcome attention.”Scathach stepped forward and rested her hand lightly on the Alchemyst’sshoulder. “Nicholas, you know that is true. There are certain words that shouldnever be spoken, names that should never be used. Old things. Undead things.”Nicholas nodded. “If you gave this person your word, then you should not go backon it, of course. But tell me”—he paused, not looking at the count—“thismysterious person, how many hands did he have?”Saint-Germain sat back suddenly, and the shocked expression on his face revealedthe truth. “How did you know?” he whispered.The Alchemyst’s mouth twisted into an ugly grimace. “In Spain, six hundred yearsago, I met a one-handed man who taught me some of the secrets of the Codex. Hetoo refused to speak his name aloud.” Flamel suddenly looked at Sophie, eyeswide and staring. “You have within you the Witch’s memories. If a name comes toyou now—it would be better for all of us if you did not say it aloud.”Sophie closed her mouth so quickly she bit the inside of her lip. She knew thename of the person Flamel and Saint-Germain were talking about. She also knewjust who—and what—he was. And she had been just about to speak the name aloud.Flamel turned back to Saint-Germain. “You know that Sophie’s powers have beenAwakened. The Witch taught her the basics of the Magic of Air, and I amdetermined that both she and Josh be trained in all the elemental magics asquickly as possible. I know where there are masters of Earth and Water magic.Only yesterday, I was thinking we might have to go in search of one of theElders associated with fire, Maui or Vulcan or even your old nemesis, Prometheushimself. Now I’m hoping that might not be necessary.” He paused for a breath.“Do you think you could you teach Sophie the Magic of Fire?”Saint-Germain blinked in surprise. He folded his arms across his chest andlooked from the girl to the Alchemyst and started to shake his head. “I’m notsure I could. I’m not even sure I should….”Joan reached over and rested her right hand on the back of her husband’s arm. Heturned to look at her and she nodded, almost imperceptibly. Her lips didn’tmove, and yet everyone clearly heard her say, “Francis, you must do it.”The count didn’t hesitate. “I’ll do it…but is it wise?” he asked, serious.“It is necessary,” she said simply.“It’ll be a lot for her to take in….” He bowed to Sophie. “Forgive me. I didn’tmean to talk about you as if you weren’t here.” He looked back at Nicholas andadded doubtfully, “Sophie is still dealing with the Witch’s memories.”“Not anymore. I attended to that.” Joan’s grip tightened on her husband’s arm.She turned her head to look at everyone sitting around the table, finallystopping at Sophie. “While Sophie slept, I spoke to her, helped her sort thememories, categorize them, separate her own thoughts from the Witch’s. I do notthink they will trouble her so much now.”Sophie was shocked. “You got into my head while I was asleep?”Joan of Arc shook her head slightly. “I didn’t get into your mind…I simplytalked to you, instructed you what to do and how to do it.”“I saw you talking…,” Josh began, and then frowned. “But Sophie was soundasleep. She couldn’t hear you.”“She heard me,” Joan said. She looked directly at Sophie and placed her lefthand flat on the table. A crackling silver haze appeared on her fingertips, tinyspeckles of light dancing from her flesh to bounce, like mercury droplets,across the table toward the girl’s hands, which were resting on the polishedwood. As they approached, Sophie’s fingernails began to glow a muted silver, andthen suddenly, the points of light wrapped around her fingers.“You may be twin to Josh, but we are sisters, you and I. We are Silver. I knowwhat it is like to hear voices inside my head; I know what it is like to see theimpossible, to know the unknowable.” Joan looked first at Josh and then at theAlchemyst. “While Sophie slept, I spoke directly to her unconscious mind. Itaught her how to control the Witch’s memories, how to ignore the voices, toshut out the images. I taught her how to protect herself.”Sophie raised her head slowly, eyes wide with surprise. “That’s what’sdifferent!” she said, both shocked and amazed. “I can’t hear the voicesanymore.” She looked at her twin. “They started when the Witch poured herknowledge into me. There were thousands of them, shouting and whispering inlanguages I almost understood. It’s quiet now.”“They’re still there,” Joan explained. “They will always be there. But now youwill be able to call upon them when you need to, to use their knowledge. I alsostarted the process of teaching you how to control your aura.”“But how could you while she was asleep?” Josh pressed. He even found thethought of it incredibly disturbing.“Only the conscious mind sleeps—the unconscious is always aware.”“What do you mean, control my aura?” Sophie asked, confused. “I thought it wasjust this silver-colored electrical field around my body.”Joan shrugged, an elegant movement of her shoulders. “Your aura is as powerfulas your imagination. You can shape it, meld it, fashion it to your will.” Sheheld out her left hand. “That’s how I can do this.” A metal glove from a suit ofarmor clicked into existence around her flesh. Each rivet was perfectly formed,and the back of the fingers was even dappled with rust. “Try it,” she suggested.Sophie held out her hand and looked hard at it.“Visualize the glove,” Joan suggested. “See it in your imagination.”A tiny silver thimble appeared on Sophie’s little finger, then winked out ofexistence.“Well, a little more practice, maybe,” Joan admitted. She glanced sidelong atSaint-Germain and then looked at the Alchemyst. “Let me work with Sophie for acouple of hours, teach her a little more about controlling and shaping her aura,before Francis starts to teach her the Magic of Fire.”“This Fire magic. Is it dangerous?” Josh demanded, looking around the room. Hestill vividly remembered what had happened to his sister when Hekate hadAwakened her—she could have died. And the more he’d learned about the Witch ofEndor, he’d realized Sophie could have died learning Air magic as well. When noone answered him, he turned to look at Saint-Germain. “Is it dangerous?”“Yes,” the musician said simply. “Very.”Josh shook his head. “Then I don’t want—”Sophie reached out to squeeze her brother’s arm. He looked down: the hand thatgripped his arm was wrapped in a chain-mail glove. “Josh, I have to do this.”“No, you don’t.”“I do.”Josh looked into his sister’s face. It was set in the stubborn mask he knew sowell. Finally, he turned away, saying nothing. He didn’t want his sisterlearning any more magic—not only was it dangerous…but it would also distance hereven further from him.Joan turned to Flamel. “And now, Nicholas, you must rest.”The Alchemyst nodded. “I will.”“We were expecting you back a long time ago,” Scathach said. “I was thinking I’dhave to go out in search of you.”“The butterfly led me here hours ago,” Nicholas said tiredly, voice muffled withexhaustion. “Once I knew where you were, I wanted to wait for night to fallbefore approaching the house, just in case it is under observation.”“Machiavelli doesn’t even know this house exists,” Saint-Germain saidconfidently.“Perenelle taught me a simple cloaking spell a long time ago, but it only workswhen it’s raining—it uses water droplets to refract light around the user,”Flamel explained. “I decided to wait until nightfall to increase my chances ofremaining unseen.”“What did you do for the day?” Sophie asked.“I wandered around the city, looking for some of my old haunts.”“Surely most are gone?” Joan said.“Most. Not all.” Flamel reached down and lifted an object wrapped in newspaperfrom the floor. It made a solid thump when he dropped it on the table. “Thehouse in Montmorency is still there.”“I should have guessed you’d visit Montmorency,” Scathach said with a sad smile.She looked at the twins and explained, “It is the house where Nicholas andPerenelle lived in the fifteenth century. We spent some happy times there.”“Very happy,” Flamel agreed.“And it’s still there?” Sophie asked, amazed.“One of the oldest houses in Paris,” Flamel said proudly.“What else did you do?” Saint-Germain asked.Nicholas shrugged. “Visited the Musée de Cluny. It’s not every day you get tosee your own gravestone. I guess it’s comforting to know that people stillremember me—the real me.”Joan smiled. “There is a street named after you, Nicholas: the Rue Flamel. Andone named in honor of Perenelle, too. But somehow, I don’t think that’s the realreason you visited the museum, is it?” She said shrewdly, “You never struck meas a sentimental man.”The Alchemyst smiled. “Well, not the only reason,” he admitted. He reached intohis jacket pocket and plucked out a narrow cylindrical tube. Everyone around thetable leaned forward. Even Scatty stepped in to look at it. Unscrewing bothends, Flamel removed and unrolled a length of rustling parchment. “Nearly sixhundred years ago, I hid this within my tombstone, little thinking that I wouldever need to use it.” He spread the thick yellow parchment on the table. Drawnin red ink faded to the color of rust was an oval with a circle inside it,surrounded by three lines forming a rough triangle.Josh leaned over. “I’ve seen something like that before.” He frowned. “Isn’tthere something like that on the dollar bill?”“Ignore what it looks like,” Flamel said. “It’s drawn this way to disguise itstrue meaning.”“What is it?” Josh asked.“It’s a map,” Sophie said suddenly.“Yes, it’s a map,” Nicholas agreed. “But how did you know? The Witch of Endornever saw this….”“No, it has nothing to do with the Witch,” Sophie smiled. She leaned across thetable, her head brushing her brother’s. She pointed to the top right-hand cornerof the parchment, where a tiny, barely visible cross was etched in red ink.“This definitely looks like an N,” she said, pointing to the top of the cross,“and this is an S.”“North and south.” Josh nodded in quick agreement. “Genius, Soph!” He looked atNicholas. “It’s a map.”The Alchemyst nodded. “Very good. It’s a map of all the ley lines in Europe.Towns and cities, even borders might change beyond all recognition, but the leylines remain the same.” He held up the square. “This is our passport out ofEurope and back to America.”“Let’s hope we get a chance to use it,” Scatty muttered.Josh touched the edge of the newspaper-wrapped bundle that sat in the center ofthe table. “And what’s this?”Nicholas furled the parchment back into the tube and slipped it into his jacketpocket. Then he began to unwrap layers of newspaper from the object on thetable. “Perenelle and I were in Spain close to the end of the fourteenth centurywhen the one-handed man revealed the first secret of the Codex,” he said,speaking to no one in particular, his French accent now pronounced.“The first secret?” Josh asked.“You’ve seen the text—it changes…but it changes in a strict mathematicalsequence. It’s not random. The changes are linked to the movements of the starsand planets, the phases of the moon.”“Like a calendar?” Josh said.Flamel nodded. “Just like a calendar. Once we had learned that code sequence, weknew we could finally return to Paris. It would take us a lifetime—severallifetimes—to translate the book, but at least we had learned where to start. SoI changed some stones into diamonds, and some flat pieces of shale into gold,and we started out on the long journey back to Paris. By then, of course, we hadcome to the attention of the Dark Elders, and Bacon, Dee’s foul predecessor, wasclosing in. Rather than take a direct route into France, we kept to the backroads and avoided the usual passes across the mountains, which we knew would bewatched. However, winter arrived early that year—I believe the Dark Elders hadsomething to do with it—and we found ourselves cut off in Andorra. And that iswhere I found this….” He touched the object on the table.Josh looked at his sister, eyebrows raised in a silent question. Andorra? hemouthed; she was much better at geography than he was.“One of the smallest countries in the world,” she explained in a whisper, “inthe Pyrenees between Spain and France.”Flamel unwrapped more paper. “Before I ‘died,’ I hid this object deep within thestone over the lintel of the house on the Rue de Montmorency. I never thought Iwould need it again.”“Within?” Josh asked, confused. “Did you say you hid it within?”“Within. I changed the molecular structure of the granite, pushed this into theblock of stone and then returned the lintel to its original solid state. Simpletransmutation: like pushing a nut into a tub of ice cream.” The final sheet ofnewspaper tore as he pulled it away.“It’s a sword,” Josh whispered in awe, looking at the short narrow weaponnestled on the paper-strewn table. He guessed it was about twenty inches long,its simple cross hilt wrapped in strips of stained dark leather. The bladeseemed to be made of a sparkling gray metal. No, not metal. “A stone sword,” hesaid aloud, frowning. It reminded him of something—almost as if he had seen itbefore.But even as he was speaking, Joan and Saint-Germain scrambled away from thetable, the woman’s chair falling over in her eagerness to get away from theblade. Behind Flamel, Scathach hissed like a cat, vampire teeth appearing as sheopened her mouth, and when she spoke, her voice was shaking, her accent thickand barbaric. She sounded almost angry…or afraid. “Nicholas,” she said veryslowly, “what are you doing with that filthy thing?”The Alchemyst ignored her. He looked at Josh and Sophie, who had remainedsitting at the table, shocked motionless by the reaction of the others, unsurewhat was happening. “There are four great swords of power,” Flamel saidurgently, “each one linked to the elements: Earth, Air, Fire and Water. It issaid that they predate even the oldest of the Elder Races. The swords have hadmany names through the ages: Excalibur and Joyeuse, Mistelteinn and Curtana,Durendal and Tyrfing. The last time one was used as a weapon in the world of menwas when Charlemagne, the Holy Roman Emperor, carried Joyeuse into battle.”“This is Joyeuse?” Josh whispered. His sister might be good at geography, but heknew history, and Charlemagne had always fascinated him.Scathach’s laugh was a bitter snarl. “Joyeuse is a thing of beauty. This…this isan abomination.”Flamel touched the sword’s hilt and the tiny crystals in the stone sparkled withgreen light. “This is not Joyeuse, though it is true that it once belonged toCharlemagne. I also believe the emperor himself hid this blade in Andorrasometime in the ninth century.”“It’s just like Excalibur,” Josh said, suddenly realizing why the stone swordwas so familiar. He looked at his sister. “Dee had Excalibur; he used it todestroy the World Tree.”“Excalibur is the Sword of Ice,” Flamel continued. “This is its twin blade:Clarent, the Sword of Fire. It is the only weapon that can stand againstExcalibur.”“It is a cursed blade,” Scathach said firmly. “I’ll not touch it.”“Nor I,” Joan said quickly, and Saint-Germain nodded in agreement.“I’m not asking any of you to carry it or wield it,” Nicholas snapped. He spunthe weapon on the table until the hilt touched the boy’s fingers and then helooked at each of them in turn. “We know Dee and Machiavelli are coming. Josh isthe only one amongst us without the ability to protect himself. Until his powersare Awakened, he is going to need a weapon. I want him to have Clarent.”“Nicholas!” Scathach cried, horrified. “What are you thinking. He’s an untrainedhumani—”“—with a solid gold aura,” Flamel said coldly. “And I am determined to keep himsafe.” He pushed the sword into Josh’s fingers. “This is yours. Take it.”Josh leaned forward and felt the two pages from the Codex press against his skinin their cloth bag. This would be the second gift the Alchemyst had given him inas many days. Part of him wanted to accept the gifts at face value—to trust himand to believe that Flamel liked him and trusted him in turn. And yet, andyet…even after the conversation they’d had in the street, somewhere at the backof his mind, Josh couldn’t forget what Dee had said by the fountain in Ojai:that half of everything Flamel said was a lie, and the other half wasn’tentirely truthful either. He deliberately looked away from the sword and lookedinto Flamel’s pale eyes. The Alchemyst was staring at him, his face anexpressionless mask. So what was the Alchemyst up to? Josh wondered. What gamewas he playing? More of Dee’s words popped into his head. “He is now, and hasalways been, a liar, a charlatan, and a crook.”“Don’t you want it?” Nicholas asked. “Take it.” He pushed the hilt right intoJosh’s grip.Almost against his will, Josh’s fingers closed over the smooth leather-wrappedhilt of the stone sword. He lifted it—though it was short, it was surprisinglyheavy—and turned it over in his hands. “I’ve never handled a sword in my life,”he said. “I don’t know how….”“Scathach will show you the basics,” Flamel said, not looking at the Shadow, butturning the simple statement into a command. “How to carry it, simple thrust andparry. Try and avoid stabbing yourself with it,” he added.Josh suddenly realized that he was grinning widely and tried to wipe away thesmile, but it was difficult: the sword felt amazing in his hand. He moved hiswrist and the sword twitched. Then he looked at Scatty, Francis and Joan and sawhow their eyes were fixed on the blade, following its every movement, and hissmile faded. “What’s wrong with the sword?” he demanded. “Why are you so scaredof it?”Sophie put her hand on her brother’s arm, her eyes sparkling silver with theWitch’s knowledge. “Clarent,” she said, “is an evil, accursed weapon, sometimescalled the Coward’s Blade. This is the sword Mordred used to kill his uncle,King Arthur.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREEIn her bedroom at the top of the house, Sophie sat on the deep window ledge andlooked down over the Champs-Elysées. The broad tree-lined street was wet withrain and shone amber, red and white in the reflected lights of the cars andbuses. She checked her watch: it was almost two a.m. on Sunday morning, yettraffic was still heavy. Anytime after midnight, the streets of San Franciscowould be deserted.The difference emphasized just how far from home she was.When she’d been younger, she’d gone through a phase when she’d decided thateverything about herself was boring. She’d made a conscious effort to be morestylish—more like her friend Elle, who changed her hair color on a weekly basisand had a wardrobe that was always filled with the latest styles. Sophie hadcollected everything she could find about the exotic European cities she readabout in magazines, places where fashion and art were created: London and Paris,Rome, Milan, Berlin. She was determined that she wasn’t going to follow fashion;she was going to create her own. The phase had lasted about a month. Fashion wasan expensive business, and the allowance she and her brother got from theirparents was strictly limited.She still wanted to visit the great cities of the world, though. She and Joshhad even started talking about taking a year off before college to gobackpacking around Europe. And now here they were in one of the most beautifulcities on earth, and she had absolutely no interest in exploring it. The onlything she wanted to do right now was return to San Francisco.But what would she return to?The thought stopped her cold.Though the family had moved around a lot, and traveled even more, two days ago,she’d known what to expect in the coming months. The rest of the year was mappedout in boring detail. In the fall, their parents would resume their teachingpositions at the University of San Francisco, and both she and Josh would returnto school. In December, the family would take their annual trip to Providence,Rhode Island, where their father had given the Christmas lecture at BrownUniversity for the past two decades. On the twenty-first of December, theirbirthday, the twins would be taken to New York City to see the shops, admire thelights, look at the tree in Rockefeller Center and then go skating. They wouldget lunch in the Stage Door Deli: have matzo ball soup and sandwiches as big astheir heads and one slice of pumpkin pie between them. On Christmas Eve, theywould head out to their aunt Christine’s house in Montauk on Long Island, wherethey’d spend the holiday and then see in the New Year. That had been thetradition for the past ten years.And now?Sophie took a deep breath. Now she possessed powers and abilities she couldbarely comprehend. She had access to memories that were a mixture of truth, mythand fantasy; she knew secrets that could rewrite history books. But she wished,more than anything else, that there were some way she could turn back time, toreturn to Thursday morning…before all this had happened. Before the world hadchanged.Sophie rested her forehead against the cool glass. What was going to happen?What was she going to do…not just now, but in the years to come? Her brother hadno career in mind; every year he announced something different—he was going tobe a computer game designer or a programmer, a professional football player, aparamedic or a fireman—but she’d always known what she was going to do. From thetime her first-grade teacher had asked her the question—“What do you want to bewhen you grow up, Sophie?”—she’d known the answer. She wanted to studyarchaeology and paleontology like her parents, to travel the world and catalogthe past, maybe make some discoveries that would help put history in order. Butthat was never going to happen now. Overnight, she’d realized that the study ofarchaeology, history, geography and science had been rendered useless…or if notuseless, then simply wrong.A sudden wash of emotion caught her by surprise, and she felt a burning at theback of her throat and tears on her cheeks. She pressed the palms of both handsagainst her face and brushed the tears away.“Knock-knock…” Josh’s voice startled her. Sophie turned to look at her twin. Herbrother was standing at the door, the stone sword in one hand, a tiny laptop inthe other. “Can I come in?”“You’ve never asked before.” She smiled.Josh stepped into the room and sat down on the edge of the double bed. Hecarefully placed Clarent on the floor by his feet and rested the laptop on hisknees. “A lot’s changed,” he said quietly, his blue eyes troubled.“I was just thinking the same thing,” she agreed. “At least that hasn’tchanged.” The twins often found they were thinking the same thought at the samemoment, and they knew one another so well that they could even finish eachother’s sentences. “I was just wishing we could go back in time, to before allthis happened.”“Why?”“So I wouldn’t have to be like this…so we wouldn’t be different.”Josh looked into his sister’s face and tilted his head slightly. “You’d give itup?” he asked very softly. “The power, the knowledge?”“In a heartbeat,” she said immediately. “I don’t like what’s happening to me. Inever wanted it to happen.” Her voice cracked, but she continued. “I want to beordinary, Josh. I want to be human again. I want to be like you.”Josh looked down. He opened the laptop and concentrated on powering it up.“But you don’t, do you?” she said slowly, interpreting the long silence thatfollowed. “You want the power, you want to be able to shape your aura andcontrol the elements, don’t you?”Josh hesitated. “It would be…interesting, I think,” he said eventually, staringat the screen. Then he looked up, his eyes bright with the reflected image ofthe log-on screen. “Yes, I want to be able to do it,” he admitted.Sophie opened her mouth to snap a response, to tell him that he didn’t know whathe was talking about, to tell him just how sick it made her feel, how scared shewas. But she stopped herself; she didn’t want to fight, and until Josh hadexperienced it for himself, he would never understand.“Where did you get the computer?” she asked, changing the subject when thelaptop finally blipped.“Francis gave it to me,” Josh said. “You were out of it when Dee destroyedYggdrasill. He stabbed the tree with Excalibur and it turned to ice and thenshattered like glass. Well, my wallet, cell phone, iPod and laptop were in thetree,” he said ruefully. “I lost everything. Including all our photos.”“And the count just gave you a laptop?”Josh nodded. “Gave it to me, insisted I have it. Must be my day for presents.”The pale glow from the computer screen lit his face from below, giving his heada vaguely frightening appearance. “He’s switched over to Macs; they’ve gotbetter music software, apparently, and he’s not using PCs anymore. He found thisone dumped under a table upstairs,” he continued, eyes still locked on the smallscreen. He glanced quickly at his sister. “It’s true,” he said, recognizing hersilence as doubt.Sophie looked away. She knew her brother was telling the truth, and that hadnothing to do with the Witch’s knowledge. She’d always known when Josh was lyingto her, though, strangely, he never knew when she was lying to him…which shedidn’t do too often anyway, and only ever for his own good. “So what are youdoing now?” she asked.“Checking my e-mail.” He grinned. “Life goes on…,” he began.“…e-mail stops for no man,” Sophie finished with a smile. It was one of Josh’sfavorite sayings, and it usually drove her crazy.“There’s loads,” he muttered. “Eighty on Gmail, sixty-two on Yahoo, twenty onAOL, three on FastMail…”“I’ll never understand why you need so many e-mail accounts,” Sophie said. Shedrew her legs up to her chest, wrapped her arms around her shins and rested herchin on her knees. It felt good to be having an ordinary conversation with herbrother; it reminded her of how things were supposed to be…and had been untilThursday afternoon at two-fifteen precisely. She remembered the time; she’d beentalking to her friend Elle in New York when she’d spotted the long black carpulling up outside the bookshop. She’d checked the time just before the man shenow knew to be Dr. John Dee had climbed out of the car.Josh looked up. “We have two e-mails from Mom, one from Dad.”“Read them to me. Start with the oldest.”“OK. Mom sent one on Friday, June first. Hope you’re both behaving yourselves.How is Mrs. Fleming? Has she fully recovered?” Josh looked up and frowned,confused.Sophie sighed. “Remember? We told Mom that the bookshop closed because Perenellewasn’t feeling well.” She shook her head. “Try and keep up!”“It’s been a little busy,” Josh reminded her. “I can’t remember everything.Besides, that’s your job.”“Then we said that Nicholas and Perenelle had invited us to spend some time withthem in their house in the desert.”“So.” Josh looked at his sister, fingers hovering over the keys. “What will Itell Mom?”“Tell her that everything’s OK and Perenelle is feeling a lot better. Rememberto call them Nick and Perry, though,” she reminded him.“Thanks,” he said, hitting the backspace key, replacing Perenelle with Perry.His fingers skipped over the keys as he typed. “OK, next one,” he continued.“From Mom again, dated yesterday. ‘Tried phoning, but my call goes directly toyour voice mail. Is everything OK? Got a call from your aunt Agnes. She said youdidn’t come home to collect any clothes or toiletries. Give me a number where Ican call you. We’re worried.’” Josh looked at his sister. “So what do we tellher now?”Sophie chewed on her bottom lip, thinking aloud. “We should tell her…” Shehesitated. “Tell her we had the things with us at the shop. She knows we haveclothes there. That’s not a lie. I hate lying to her.”“Got it,” Josh said, typing fast. The twins both kept clothes in his locker inthe back room of the bookshop for the occasional evening when they went to themovies or walked down to the Embarcadero.“Tell her we have no cell service here. Just don’t say where here is,” she addedwith a smile.Josh looked disgusted. “You mean we have no cell phones…”“I’ve still got mine, but the battery is dead. Tell Mom that we’ll call as soonas we get a signal.”Josh continued to type. His finger hovered over the Enter key. “Is that it?”“Send it.”He hit Enter. “Sent!”“And you said there was an e-mail from Dad?” she asked.“It’s for me.” He opened it, read it quickly and smiled broadly. “He’s sent ajpeg of some fossil shark teeth he found. They look pretty good. And he’s gotsome new coprolites for my collection.”“Coprolites.” Sophie shook her head in mock disgust. “Fossilized poo! Whycouldn’t you collect stamps or coins like a regular person? It’s just tooweird.”“Weird?” Josh looked up, suddenly irritated. “Weird! Let me tell you what’sweird: we’re in a house with a two-thousand-year-old vegetarian vampire, animmortal alchemist, another immortal who’s a musician specializing in Fire magicand a French heroine who should have died sometime in the middle of thefifteenth century.” He nudged the sword on the floor with his foot. “And let’snot forget the sword that was used to kill King Arthur.” Josh’s voice had beenrising as he spoke and he suddenly stopped and drew in a deep shuddering breath,calming himself. He started to smile. “Compared to all that, I think collectingfossil poo is probably the least weird thing around here!” His smile turned to agrin and Sophie smiled, and then they were both laughing. Josh laughed so hardhe got the hiccups, and that made them laugh even harder, until tears ran downtheir cheeks and their stomachs hurt.“Oh, stop,” Josh moaned. He hiccupped again, and they both dissolved into nearhysteria.It took a tremendous effort of will to control themselves, but for the firsttime since Sophie had been Awakened, Josh felt close to her again. Usually, theylaughed every day; heading into work on Thursday morning was the last timethey’d laughed together as they’d watched a skinny man in roller skates andrunning shorts being pulled along by a huge Dalmatian. All they needed to do wasto keep finding things to laugh at—but unfortunately, there hadn’t been too manyof those over the past few days.Sophie sobered up first and turned back to the window. She could see her brotherin the glass and waited until he looked down at the screen before she spoke.“I’m surprised you didn’t object more when Nicholas suggested that Francis trainme in Fire magic,” she said.Josh raised his eyes and looked at his sister’s face reflected in the window.“Would it have made any difference if I had?” he asked seriously.She took a moment to think. “No. I suppose not,” she admitted.“I didn’t think so. You’d still have done it.”Sophie turned to look directly at her twin. “I have to. I need to.”“I know,” he said simply. “I know that now.”Sophie blinked in surprise. “You know?”Josh closed the laptop and dropped it on the bed. Then he picked up the swordand rested it across his knees, absently rubbing the smooth blade. The stonefelt warm. “I was…angry, scared—no, more than scared—terrified when Flamel hadHekate Awaken you. He didn’t tell us about the dangers. He didn’t tell us thatyou could have died, or fallen into a coma. I’ll never forgive him for that.”“He was pretty sure nothing would happen….”“Pretty sure isn’t sure enough.”Sophie nodded, not trusting herself to speak.“And then, when the Witch of Endor passed her knowledge to you, I was scaredagain. But not so much scared for you…I was scared of you,” he admitted verysoftly.“Josh, how can you even say that?” Sophie began, genuinely shocked. “I’m yourtwin.” The look on his face silenced her.“You haven’t seen what I’ve seen,” he said earnestly. “I watched you stand up tothe cat-headed woman. I saw your lips move, but when you spoke, the words wereout of sync, and when you looked at me, you didn’t recognize me. I don’t knowwhat you were—but you weren’t my twin sister then. You were possessed.”Sophie blinked and huge tears rolled down her cheeks. She had only the vaguestmemories, little more than dreamlike fragments, of what her brother was talkingabout.“Then, in Ojai, I watched you make whirlwinds, and today—yesterday—I saw youmake fog out of nothing.”“I don’t know how I do those things,” she murmured.“I know, Soph, I know.” He stood up and crossed to the window, looking out overthe rooftops of Paris. “I understand that now. I’ve been thinking about it alot. Your powers have been Awakened, but the only way you’ll be able to controlthem, the only way you’ll be safe, is by being trained. At the moment they areas much a danger to you as they are to our enemies. Joan of Arc helped youtoday, didn’t she?”“Yes, she helped a lot. I don’t hear the voices anymore. That’s a huge help. Butthere’s another reason too, isn’t there?” Sophie asked.Josh turned the sword over in his hand, the blade almost black in the night,tiny flecks of crystal in the stone winking like stars. “We have no idea whatsort of trouble we’re in,” he said slowly. “But we do know that we’re indanger…real danger. We’re fifteen years old—we shouldn’t be thinking about beingkilled…or eaten…or worse!” He waved vaguely in the direction of the door. “Idon’t trust them. The only person I can trust is you…the real you.”“But Josh,” Sophie said very gently, “I do trust them. They are good people.Scatty has fought for humanity for over two thousand years, and Joan is a kindand gentle person….”“And Flamel has kept the Codex hidden away for centuries,” Josh said quickly. Hetouched his chest and Sophie heard the crackle of the two pages in the bagFlamel had given him. “There are recipes in this book that could make thisplanet a paradise, could cure every disease.” He saw the flicker of doubt in hereyes and pressed on. “And you know that’s true.”“The Witch’s memories also tell me that there are recipes in the book that coulddestroy this world.”Josh shook his head quickly. “I think you’re seeing what they want you to see.”Sophie pointed to the sword. “But why did Flamel give you the sword and theCodex pages?” she asked triumphantly.“I think—I know—they’re using us. I just don’t know what for. Not yet, anyway.”He saw his twin start to shake her head. “Anyway, we’re going to need yourpowers to keep us both safe.”Sophie reached out and squeezed her brother’s hand. “You know I’d never letanything hurt you.”“I know that,” Josh said seriously. “At least, not deliberately. But whathappens if something uses you, like it did in the Shadowrealm?”Sophie nodded. “I had no control then,” she admitted. “It was like I was in adream, watching someone who looked like me.”“My football coach says that before you can take control, you have to be incontrol. If you can learn how to control your aura and master the magics,” Joshcontinued, “no one would be able to do that to you ever again. You’d beincredibly powerful. And let’s say, for instance, that my power isn’t Awakened.I can learn how to use this sword.” He twisted it in his hand, attempting tospin the blade, but it slipped sideways and cut a deep gouge in the wall.“Oops.”“Josh!”“What? You can hardly notice it.” He rubbed his sleeve against the cut. Paintand plaster flaked away, exposing the brickwork beneath.“You’re making it worse. And you’ve probably taken a chunk out of the sword.”But when Josh held the weapon up to the light, there wasn’t even a mark on theblade.Sophie nodded slowly. “I still think—I know—you’re wrong about Flamel and theothers.”“Sophie, you have to trust me.”“I trust you. But remember, the Witch knows these people, and she trusts them.”“Sophie,” Josh said in frustration, “we don’t know anything about the Witch.”“Oh, Josh, I know everything about the Witch,” Sophie said feelingly. She tappedher temple with her forefinger. “And I wish I didn’t. Her entire life, thousandsof years, are in here.” Josh opened his mouth to reply, but Sophie held up herhand. “Here’s what I’ll do: I’ll work with Saint-Germain, learn everything hehas to teach me.”“And keep an eye on him at the same time; try and find out what he and Flamelare up to.”Sophie ignored him. “Maybe the next time we’re attacked, we’ll be able to defendourselves.” She looked across the rooftops of Paris. “At least we’re safe here.”“But for how long?” her twin asked."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-FOURDr. John Dee turned off the light and stepped out of the enormous bedroom ontothe balcony, resting his forearms on the metal railing and looking out over thecity of Paris. It had rained earlier and the air was damp and chill, taintedwith the sour smell from the Seine and the hint of exhaust fumes.He hated Paris.It had not always been that way. Once, this had been his favorite city in all ofEurope, filled with the most wonderful and extraordinary memories. After all, hehad been made immortal in this city. In a dungeon deep below the Bastille, theprison fortress, the Crow Goddess had taken him to the Elder who had granted himeternal life in return for unquestioning loyalty.Dr. John Dee had worked for the Elders, spied for them, undertaken manydangerous missions through countless Shadowrealms. He had fought armies of thedead and undead, pursued monsters across bitter wastelands, stolen some of themost precious and magical objects sacred to a dozen civilizations. In time hehad become the champion of the Dark Elders; nothing was beyond him, no missionwas too difficult…except when it came to the Flamels. The English Magician hadfailed, over and over, to capture Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel, several timesin this very city.It remained one of the greatest mysteries of his long existence: how had theFlamels evaded him? He commanded an army of human, inhuman and abhuman agents;he had access to the birds of the air; he could command rats, cats and dogs. Hehad at his disposal creatures from the darkest edges of mythology. But for morethan four hundred years, the Flamels had escaped capture, first here in Paris,then across Europe and into America, always staying one step ahead of him, oftenleaving town only hours before he arrived. It was almost as if they were beingwarned. But that, of course, was impossible. The Magician shared his plans withno one.A door opened and closed in the room behind him. Dee’s nostrils flared, smellinga hint of musty serpent. “Good evening, Niccolò,” Dee said, without turningaround.“Welcome to Paris.” Niccolò Machiavelli spoke Latin with an Italian accent. “Itrust you had a good flight and that the room is to your satisfaction?”Machiavelli had arranged for Dee to be met at the airport and given a policeescort to his grand town house off the Place du Canada.“Where are they?” Dee asked rudely, ignoring his host’s questions, asserting hisauthority. He might have been a few years younger than the Italian, but he wasin charge.Machiavelli stepped out of the room and stood beside Dee on the balcony.Unwilling to wrinkle his suit against the metal railing, he stood with his handsclasped behind his back. The tall, elegant, clean-shaven Italian withclose-cropped white hair was in great contrast with the small sharp-featured manwith his pointed beard and his gray hair pulled back in a tight ponytail. “Theyare still in Saint-Germain’s house. And Flamel has recently joined them.”Dr. Dee glanced sidelong at Machiavelli. “I’m surprised you were not tempted totry and capture them yourself,” he said slyly.Machiavelli looked over the city he controlled. “Oh, I thought I would leavetheir final capture to you,” he said mildly.“You mean you were instructed to leave them to me,” Dee snapped.Machiavelli said nothing.“Saint-Germain’s house is completely surrounded?”“Completely.”“And there are only five people in the house? No servants, no guards?”“The Alchemyst and Saint-Germain, the twins and the Shadow.”“Scathach is the problem,” Dee muttered.“I may have a solution,” Machiavelli suggested softly. He waited until theMagician turned to look at him, his stone gray eyes blinking orange in thereflected streetlights. “I sent for the Disir, Scathach’s fiercest foes. Threeof them have just arrived.”A rare smile curled Dee’s thin lips. Then he moved back from Machiavelli andbowed slightly. “The Valkyries—a truly excellent choice.”“We are on the same side,” Machiavelli bowed in return. “We serve the samemasters.”The Magician was about to step back into the room when he stopped and turned tolook at Machiavelli. For a moment, the faintest rotten-egg hint of sulfur hungin the air. “You have no idea whom I serve,” he said. Dagon threw open the tall double doors and stepped back. Niccolò Machiavelli andDr. John Dee strode into the ornate book-filled library to greet their visitors.There were three young women in the room.At first glance they were so alike that they could have been triplets. Tall andthin, with shoulder-length blond hair, they were dressed alike in black tanksunder soft leather jackets and blue jeans tucked into knee-high boots. Theirfaces were all angles: sharp cheekbones, deeply sunken eyes, pointed chins. Onlytheir eyes helped distinguish them. They were different shades of blue, from thepalest sapphire to deep, almost purple indigo. All three looked as if they mighthave been sixteen or seventeen, but in actuality, they were older than mostcivilizations.They were the Disir.Machiavelli stepped into the center of the room and turned to look at each ofthe girls in turn, trying to tell them apart. One was sitting at the grandpiano, another was lounging on the sofa, while a third leaned against a window,staring out into the night, an unopened leather-bound book in her hands. As hegot closer to them, their heads pivoted, and he noticed that their eye colorsmatched their nail polish. “Thank you for coming,” he said, speaking Latin,which, along with Greek, was the one language most of the Elders were familiarwith.The girls looked at him blankly.Machiavelli glanced at Dagon, who had stepped into the room and closed the doorbehind him. He pulled off his glasses, revealing his bulbous eyes, and spokequickly in a language no human throat or tongue could shape.The women ignored him.Dr. John Dee sighed dramatically. He dropped into a high-backed leather armchairand clapped his small hands together with a sharp crack. “Enough of thisnonsense,” he said in English. “You’re here for Scathach. Now, do you want heror not?”The girl sitting at the piano stared at the Magician. If he noticed that herhead was now twisted at an impossible angle, he didn’t react. “Where is she?”Her English was perfect.“Close by,” Machiavelli said, moving slowly around the room.The three girls directed their attention to him, heads turning to track him,like owls following a mouse.“What is she doing?”“She is protecting the Alchemyst Flamel, Saint-Germain and two humani,”Machiavelli said. “We only want the humani and Flamel. Scathach is yours.” Hepaused and then added, “You can have Saint-Germain, too, if you want him. He’sno use to us.”“The Shadow. We just want the Shadow,” the woman sitting at the piano said. Herindigo-tipped fingers moved across the keys, the sound delicate and beautiful.Machiavelli crossed to a side table and poured coffee from a tall silver pot. Helooked at Dee and raised his eyebrows and the pot at the same time. The Magicianshook his head. “You should know that Scathach is still powerful,” Machiavellicontinued, speaking now to the woman seated at the piano. The pupils of herindigo eyes were narrow and horizontal. “She knocked out a unit of highlytrained police officers yesterday morning.”“Humani,” the Disir almost spat. “No humani can stand against the Shadow.”“But we are not humani,” the woman standing at the window said.“We are the Disir,” finished the woman sitting across from Dee. “We are theShieldmaidens, the Choosers of the Dead, the Warriors of—”“Yes, yes, yes,” Dee said impatiently. “We know who you are: Valkyries. Probablythe greatest warriors the world has ever seen—according to yourselves, anyway.We want to know if you can defeat the Shadow.”The Disir with indigo eyes swiveled her body away from the piano and flowedsmoothly to her feet. She stalked across the carpet to stand before Dee. Her twosisters were suddenly by her side, and the temperature in the room abruptlyplummeted.“It would be a mistake to mock us, Dr. Dee,” one said.Dee sighed. “Can you defeat the Shadow?” he asked again. “Because if you cannot,then I’m sure that there are others who would be only too delighted to try.” Heheld up his cell phone. “I can call upon Amazons, Samurai and Bogatyrs.”The temperature in the room continued to fall as Dee spoke, and his breathplumed white in the air, ice crystals forming on his eyebrows and beard.“Enough of this trickery!” Dee snapped his fingers and his aura flashed brieflyyellow. The room grew warm, then hot, heavy with the stink of rotten eggs.“There is no need for these lesser warriors. The Disir will slay the Shadow,”the girl standing to Dee’s right said.“How?” Dee snapped.“We have what those other warriors have not.”“You’re talking in riddles,” Dee said impatiently.“Tell him,” Machiavelli said.The Disir with the palest eyes turned her head in his direction and then lookedback at Dee. Long fingers flickered toward his face. “You destroyed theYggdrasill and released our pet creature, which had been long trapped in theroots of the World Tree.”Something flickered behind Dee’s eyes and a muscle twitched at the corner of hismouth. “Nidhogg?” He looked at Machiavelli. “You knew about this?”Machiavelli nodded. “Of course.”The Disir with indigo eyes stepped up to Dee and looked down into his face.“Yes, you freed Nidhogg, the Devourer of Corpses.” Still leaning toward Dee, sheswiveled her head to look at Machiavelli. Her sisters also turned in hisdirection. “Take us to where the Shadow and the others are hiding, then leaveus. Once we have loosed Nidhogg, Scathach is doomed.”“Can you control the creature?” Machiavelli asked curiously.“Once it feeds off the Shadow, consumes first her memories and then her fleshand bones, it will need to sleep. After a feast like Scathach, it will probablysleep for a couple of centuries. We will recapture it then.”Niccolò Machiavelli nodded. “We didn’t discuss your fee.”The three Disir smiled, and even Machiavelli, who had seen horrors, recoiledfrom the expressions on their faces. “There is no fee,” the Disir with indigoeyes said. “This we will do to restore the honor of our clan and avenge ourfallen family. Scathach the Shadow destroyed many of our sisters.”Machiavelli nodded. “I understand. When will you attack?”“At dawn.”“Why not now?” Dee demanded.“We are creatures of the twilight. In that no-time between night and day, we areat our strongest,” one said.“That is when we are invincible,” her sister added."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE“I guess I must still be on American time,” Josh said.“Why?” Scathach asked. They were standing in the fully equipped gym in thebasement of Saint-Germain’s house. One wall was mirrored, and it reflected theyoung man and the vampire, surrounded by the latest exercise equipment.Josh glanced up at the clock on the wall. “It’s three a.m…. I should beexhausted, but I’m still totally awake. It could be because it’s only six atnight back home.”Scathach nodded. “That’s one of the reasons. Another is because you are aroundpeople like Nicholas and Saint-Germain, and especially your sister and Joan.Although your powers have not been Awakened, you are in the company of some ofthe most powerful auras on the planet. Your own aura is picking up a little oftheir power, and it is energizing you. But just because you don’t feel tired,that doesn’t mean you should not rest,” she added. “Drink plenty of water too.Your aura is burning through a lot of liquids. You need to keep hydrated.”A door opened and Joan stepped into the gym. While Scathach was dressed inblack, Joan was wearing a long-sleeved white T-shirt over loose white trousersand white sneakers. Like Scathach, however, she was carrying a sword. “Iwondered if you needed an assistant,” she said, almost shyly.“I thought you’d gone to bed,” Scathach said.“I don’t sleep much these days. And when I do, my dreams are troubled. I dreamof fire.” She smiled sadly. “Isn’t it a wonderful irony: I’m married to a Masterof Fire, yet I’m terrified by dreams of fire.”“Where is Francis?”“In his office, working. He’ll be there for hours. I’m not sure if he eversleeps anymore. Now,” she said, looking at Josh and changing the subject, “howare you getting on?”“I’m still learning how to hold the sword,” Josh muttered, sounding vaguelyembarrassed. He’d seen movies; he’d thought he knew how people fought withswords. He’d never imagined, though, that just holding one would be sodifficult. Scathach had spent the past thirty minutes attempting to teach himhow to hold and move Clarent without dropping it. She hadn’t had much success;every time he spun the weapon, the weight dragged it from his grip. The highlypolished wooden floor was scratched and gouged where the stone blade had struckit. “It’s harder than I thought,” he finally admitted. “I’m not sure I’ll everlearn.”“Scathach can teach you how to fight with a sword,” Joan said confidently. “Shetaught me. She took a simple farm girl and turned her into a warrior.” Shetwisted her wrist, and her sword, which was almost as tall as she was, moved andcurled in the air with an almost human-sounding moan. Josh attempted to copy theaction and Clarent went spinning from his hand. It buried itself point first inthe floor, cracking the wood and swaying to and fro.“Sorry,” Josh muttered.“Forget everything you think you know about swordplay,” Scathach said. Sheglanced at Joan. “He’s watched too much TV. He thinks he can just twirl a swordaround like a cheerleader’s baton.”Joan grinned. She deftly flipped her longsword and presented it to Josh, hiltfirst. “Take it.”Josh reached for the sword with his right hand.“You might think about using both hands,” the small Frenchwoman suggested.Josh ignored her. Wrapping his fingers around the hilt of Joan’s sword, heattempted to lift it from her grasp. And failed. It was incredibly heavy.“You can see why we’re still on the basics,” Scatty said. She plucked the swordfrom Josh’s grip and tossed it to Joan, who caught it easily.“Let’s start with how to hold a sword.” Joan took up a position on Josh’s right,while Scathach stood to his left. “Look straight ahead.”Josh looked into the mirror. While he and Scathach were clearly visible in theglass, the faintest silver haze surrounded Joan of Arc. He blinked, squeezinghis eyes shut, but when he opened them again, the haze was still there.“It’s my aura,” Joan explained, anticipating the question he was just about toask. “It’s usually invisible to the human eyes, but it’ll sometimes turn up onphotos and in mirrors.”“And your aura is like Sophie’s,” Josh said.Joan of Arc shook her head. “Oh no, not like your sister’s,” she said,surprising him. “Hers is much stronger.”Joan raised the longsword, spinning it around so that the point of the blade waspositioned between her feet and both hands rested on the pommel of the hilt.“Now, just do as we do…and do it slowly.” She stretched out her right arm,holding the long blade steady. On Josh’s left, the Shadow extended both arms,holding her two short swords straight out in front of her.Josh wrapped his fingers around the hilt of the stone sword and raised his rightarm. Even before he had it fully extended, it had begun to tremble with theweight of the blade. Gritting his teeth, he attempted to keep his arm steady.“It’s too heavy,” he gasped as he lowered his arm and rotated his shoulder; hismuscles were burning. It felt a bit like the first day of football practiceafter summer vacation.“Try it like this. Watch me.” Joan showed him how to grip the handle with bothhands.Using both hands, he found that it was easier to hold the sword straight out. Hetried it again, this time holding the sword with one hand. For about thirtyseconds the weapon remained still; then the tip began to tremble. With a sigh,Josh lowered his arms. “Can’t do it with one hand,” he muttered.“In time you will,” Scathach snapped, losing patience. “But in the meantime,I’ll teach you how to wield it using both hands, Eastern fashion.”Josh nodded. “That might be easier.” He’d spent years studying tae kwon do, andhad always wanted to study kendo, Japanese fencing, but his parents had refused,saying it was too dangerous.“All he needs is practice,” Joan said seriously, looking at Scathach’sreflection in the mirror, her gray eyes bright and twinkling.“How much practice?” Josh asked.“At least three years.”“Three years?” Taking a deep breath, he wiped first one palm and then the otheron his pants and gripped the hilt again. Then he looked at himself in the mirrorand stretched out both arms. “I hope Sophie is doing better than I am,” hemuttered. The Comte de Saint-Germain had brought Sophie up to the house’s tiny roofgarden. The view of Paris was spectacular, and she leaned on the balustrade tolook down onto the Champs-Elysées. Traffic had finally faded to little more thana sparse trickle, and the city was still and silent. She breathed deeply; theair was cool and damp, the slightly sour smell of the river masked by the herbalscents coming from the dozens of overflowing pots and fancy containers scatteredacross the roof. Sophie wrapped her arms around her body, vigorously rubbed herforearms and shivered.“Cold?” Saint-Germain asked.“A little,” she said, though she wasn’t sure if she was cold or nervous. Sheknew Saint-Germain had brought her up here to teach her Fire magic.“After tonight, you will never feel the chill again,” Saint-Germain promised.“You could walk across Antarctica wearing shorts and a T-shirt and feelnothing.” Brushing his long hair off his forehead, he plucked a leaf from a potand curled it between the palms of his hands, then rubbed them together. Thecrisp odor of spearmint filled the air. “Joan loves to cook. She grows all herherbs up here,” he explained, breathing deeply. “There are a dozen differenttypes of mint, oregano, thyme, sage and basil. And of course lavender. She loveslavender; it reminds her of her youth.”“Where did you meet Joan? Here, in France?”“I finally got together with her here, but believe it or not, I first met her inCalifornia. It was 1849; I was making a little gold and Joan was working as amissionary, running a soup kitchen and hospital for those who’d gone west insearch of gold.”Sophie frowned. “You were making gold during the Gold Rush? Why?”Saint-Germain shrugged and looked vaguely embarrassed. “Like just about everyoneelse in America in ’48 and ’49, I went west in search of gold.”“I thought you could make gold. Nicholas said he can.”“Making gold is a long, laborious process. I thought it would be far easier todig it up out of the ground. And once an alchemist has a little gold, he can usethat to grow more. That’s what I thought I’d do. But the land I bought turnedout to be useless. So I started planting a few fragments of gold on the land andthen I’d sell the property to those people who had just arrived.”“But that’s just wrong,” Sophie said, shocked.“I was young then,” Saint-Germain said. “And hungry. But that’s no excuse,” headded. “Anyway, Joan was working in Sacramento, and she kept meeting people whohad bought useless land from me. She thought I was a charlatan—which I was—and Itook her for one of those dreadful do-gooders. Neither of us knew the other wasimmortal, of course, and we hated one another on sight. We kept bumping into oneanother over the years, and then, during the Second World War, we met again,here in Paris. She was fighting with the Resistance and I was spying for theAmericans. That’s when we realized that we were different. We survived the war,and we’ve been inseparable ever since, though Joan keeps very much to thebackground. None of my fan blogs or the gossip magazines even know we’remarried. We could probably have sold the wedding pictures for a fortune, butJoan prefers to keep a very low profile.”“Why?” Sophie knew that celebrities valued their privacy, but to remaincompletely invisible seemed just strange.“Well…you have to remember that the last time she was famous, people tried toburn her at the stake.”Sophie nodded. Suddenly, remaining invisible sounded perfectly reasonable. “Howlong have you known Scathach?” she asked.“Centuries. When Joan and I got together, we discovered that we knew a lot ofpeople in common. All immortal, of course. Joan’s known her a lot longer than Ihave. Though I’m not sure if anyone really knows the Shadow,” he added with awry smile. “She always seems so…” He paused, hunting for the right word.“Lonely?” she suggested.“Yes. Lonely.” He gazed out across the city and then shook his head sadly andlooked back over his shoulder at Sophie. “Do you know how often she has stoodalone against the Dark Elders, how many times she has put herself in terribledanger to keep this world safe from them?”Even as Sophie started to shake her head, a series of images flashed through herconsciousness, fragments from the Witch’s memories:Scathach, wearing leather and chain mail, standing alone on a bridge, twoblazing swords in her hands, waiting as enormous sluglike monsters gathered atone end.Scathach in full armor, standing in the door of a great castle, arms foldedacross her chest, her swords stuck into the ground at her feet. Facing her wasan army of huge lizardlike creatures.Scathach, clad in sealskin and furs, balanced on a shifting ice floe ascreatures that looked as if they had been carved out of the ice itselfsurrounded her.Sophie licked her lips. “Why…why does she do it?”“Because that is who she is. That is what she is.” The count looked at the girland smiled sadly. “And because it is all she knows. Now,” he said briskly,rubbing his hands together again, sparks and cinders spiraling up into the nightair. “Nicholas wants you to learn the Magic of Fire. Nervous?” he asked.“A little. Have you ever taught anyone else?” Sophie asked hesitantly.Saint-Germain grinned, showing his uneven teeth. “No one. You will be my firststudent…and probably my last.”She felt her stomach flip-flop, and suddenly this didn’t seem like such a goodidea anymore. “Why would you say that?”“Well, the chances of coming across another person whose magical abilities havebeen Awakened are very slight, and those of finding someone with as pure an auraas yours, next to impossible. A silver aura is incredibly rare. Joan was thelast humani to have one, and she was born in 1412. You are very special indeed,Sophie Newman.”Sophie swallowed hard; she wasn’t feeling very special.Saint-Germain sat down on a simple wooden bench set back against the chimneybreast. “Sit here beside me, and I’ll tell you what I know.”Sophie sat beside the Comte de Saint-Germain and looked across the roof, outover the city. Memories that were not hers flickered at the edge of herconsciousness, hinting at a city with a different skyline, a city of lowbuildings clustered around a massive fortress, thousands of smoke trails risinginto the night. She deliberately shied away from the thoughts, realizing she wasseeing Paris as the Witch of Endor remembered it, sometime in the past.Saint-Germain shifted to look at the girl. “Give me your hand,” he said softly.Sophie put her right hand in his, and immediately a feeling of warmth coursedthrough her body, wiping out the chill. “Let me tell you what my own teachertaught me about fire.” As he was speaking, the count moved his glowing indexfinger across the girl’s palm, following the lines and ridges in the flesh,tracing a pattern on her skin. “My teacher said that there are those who willsay that the Magic of Air or Water or even Earth is the most powerful magic ofall. They are wrong. The Magic of Fire surpasses all others.”As he was speaking, the air directly in front of them began to glow, thenshimmer. As if through a heat haze, Sophie watched the smoke twist and dancewith the count’s words, creating images, symbols, pictures. She wanted to reachout and touch them, but she remained still. Then the rooftop faded and Parisvanished; the only sound she could hear was Saint-Germain’s softly insistentvoice, and all she could see were the burning cinders. But as he spoke, imagesstarted to form in the fire.“Fire consumes air. It can heat water to mist and can crack open the earth.”She watched as a volcano spewed molten rock high into the air. Red-black lavaand white-hot cinders rained down on a town of mud and stone….“Fire destroys, but it also creates. A forest needs fire to thrive. Certainseeds depend on it to germinate.”Flames twisted like leaves and Sophie saw a forest blackened and battered, thetrees scarred with the evidence of a terrible fire. But at the base of thetrees, brilliant green shoots poked through the cinders….“In ages past, fire warmed the humani, allowed them to survive in harshclimates.”The fire revealed a desolate landscape, rocky and snow-covered, but she couldsee that the cave-dotted cliff face was lit up with warm yellow-red flames….There was a sudden crack and a pencil-thin finger of flame shot up into thenight sky. She craned her neck, following it up, up, up, until it disappearedamongst the stars.“This is the Magic of Fire.”Sophie nodded. Her skin tingled and she looked down to see tiny yellow-greenflames curl off Saint-Germain’s fingers. They flickered across her skin, coilingaround her wrist, feather-soft and cool, leaving faint black traces on herflesh. “I know how important fire is. My mother is an archaeologist,” she saiddreamily. “She told me once that man didn’t begin on the road to civilizationuntil he started cooking his meat.”Saint-Germain flashed a smile. “You have Prometheus and the Witch to thank forthat. They brought fire to the first primitive humani. Cooking made it easierfor mankind to digest the meat they hunted, allowed them to absorb the nutrientsmore easily. It kept them warm and safe in their caves, and Prometheus showedthem how to use the same fire to harden their tools and weapons.” The countgripped Sophie’s wrist with his hand, holding it as if he were taking her pulse.“Fire has driven every great civilization, from the ancient world right up tothe present day. Without the heat of the sun, this planet would be nothing morethan rock and ice.”As he was speaking, images crackled into existence before Sophie’s face again,formed from smoke drifting off his hands. They hung undulating in the still air.…A gray-brown planet turning in space, a single moon spinning around it. Therewere no white clouds, no blue water, no green continents or golden deserts. Onlygray. And the faintest outlines of land masses cut into the solid rock. Sophieabruptly realized that she was looking at the earth, perhaps far, far in thefuture. She gasped in shock and her breath blew the smoke away, taking the imagewith it.“The Magic of Fire is strongest in sunlight.” Saint-Germain moved his right handand traced a symbol with his index finger. It hung glowing in the air, a circlewith spikes radiating from it like a sunburst. The count blew on it and itdissolved into sparkles. “Without fire, we are nothing.”Saint-Germain’s left hand was now completely wrapped in flame, but he stillclutched Sophie’s wrist. Red-white ribbons of fire curled around the girl’sfingers and puddled in the palm of her hand. Each finger burned like a miniaturecandle—red, yellow, green, blue and white—yet she felt no pain and no fear.“Fire can heal; it can seal a wound, can cut out disease,” Saint-Germaincontinued earnestly. Golden cinders of fire burned in his pale blue eyes. “It isunlike any other magic, because it is the only one directly linked to the purityand strength of your aura. Almost anyone can learn the basics of Earth, Air orWater magic. Spells and incantations can be memorized and written down in books,but the power to ignite fire comes from within. The purer the aura, the strongerthe fire, and that means, Sophie, that you must be very careful, because youraura is so pure. When you unleash the Magic of Fire, it will be incrediblypotent. Has Flamel warned you not to overuse your powers, lest you burst intoflame?”“Scatty told me what might happen,” Sophie said.Saint-Germain nodded. “Never create fire when you are tired or weakened. If youlose control of this element, it will snap back on you and burn you to a crispin a heartbeat.”A solid ball of flame now burned steadily in Sophie’s right hand. She becameaware that her left hand was tingling and quickly lifted it off the bench. Itleft the smoking, blackened impression of a hand burned into the wood. With adull pop, a puddle of blue flame appeared in her left hand and each fingersparked alight.“Why can’t I feel it?” Sophie wondered aloud.“You are protected by your aura,” Saint-Germain explained. “You can shape thefire, in the same way that Joan showed you how to shape your aura into silverobjects. You can create globes and spears of fire.” He snapped his fingers and ascattering of thick round sparks bounced across the roof. He then pointed hisindex finger and a little jagged spearlike flame darted toward the nearestspark, striking it with deadly accuracy. “When you are in full control of yourpowers, you will be able to draw upon the Magic of Fire at will, but until thenyou will need a trigger.”“A trigger?”“Normally it would take hours of meditation to focus your aura to the point atwhich you could bring it alight. But sometime in the very distant past, someonediscovered how to create a trigger. A shortcut. You’ve seen my butterflies?”Sophie nodded, remembering the dozens of tiny tattooed butterflies that wrappedaround the count’s wrists and coiled up his arm.“They are my trigger.” Saint-Germain lifted the girl’s hands. “And now you haveyours.”Sophie looked down at her hands. The fire had gone out, leaving black sootystreaks on her flesh and around her wrists. She brushed her hands together, butsucceeded only in smearing the dust.“Allow me.” Saint-Germain lifted a watering can and shook it. Liquid sloshedinside. “Hold out your hands.” He poured water over her palms—it sizzled as ittouched her flesh—washing away the black streaks. The count pulled a spotlesswhite handkerchief from his back pocket, dipped it into the watering can andcarefully wiped off the remainder of the soot. But around her right wrist, whereSaint-Germain had held it, the soot refused to wash away. A thick black bandencircled her wrist like a bracelet.Saint-Germain snapped his fingers and his index and little finger lit up. Hebrought the light close to Sophie’s hand.She looked down to discover that a tattoo was burned into her skin.Silently lifting her arm, she twisted her wrist to examine the ornate bandtwisted around it. Two strands, gold and silver, entwined and curled around oneanother to form an intricate, almost Celtic-looking pattern. On the underside ofher wrist, where Saint-Germain had pressed his thumb, was a perfect gold circlewith a red dot in the center.“When you wish to trigger the Magic of Fire, press your thumb against the circleand focus your aura,” Saint-Germain explained. “That will bring the fire aliveinstantly.”“And that’s it?” Sophie asked, sounding surprised. “That’s all?”Saint-Germain nodded. “That’s it. Why, what were you expecting?”Sophie shook her head. “I don’t know, but when the Witch of Endor taught me Airmagic, she wrapped me in bandages like a mummy.”Saint-Germain smiled shyly. “Well, I’m not the Witch of Endor, of course. Joantells me the Witch imbued you with all of her memories and knowledge. I’ve noidea why she did that; it certainly wasn’t necessary. But no doubt she had herreasons. Besides, I don’t know how to do that—and I’m not sure I’d want youknowing all my thoughts and memories,” he added with a grin. “Some of them arenot very nice.”Sophie smiled. “I’m relieved—another batch of memories wouldn’t be that great todeal with.” Holding up her hand, she pressed the circle on her wrist and herlittle finger smoked; then the nail glowed dull orange for a moment before itpopped alight with a slender, wavering flame. “How did you know what to do?”“Well, I was first and foremost an alchemist. I suppose you’d call me ascientist today. When Nicholas asked me to train you in the Magic of Fire, I’dno idea how to do it, so I just approached this like any other experiment.”“An experiment?” Sophie blinked. “Could it have gone wrong?”“The real danger was that it simply would not have worked.”“Thank you,” she said finally, and then she grinned. “I was expecting theprocess to be a lot more dramatic. I’m really glad it was so”—she paused,looking for the right word—“ordinary.”“Well, maybe not that ordinary. It’s not every day you learn how to master fire.How about extraordinary?” Saint-Germain suggested.“Well, that too.”“That’s all. Oh, there are tricks I can—and will—teach you. Tomorrow, I’ll showyou how to create globes, donuts and rings of fire. But once you have thetrigger, you can call upon fire at any time.”“But do I need to say anything?” Sophie asked. “Do I need to learn any words?”“Like what?”“Well, when you lit up the Eiffel Tower, you said something that sounded likeeggness.”“Ignis,” the count said. “Latin for fire. No, you don’t need to say anything.”“Why did you do it, then?”Saint-Germain grinned. “I just thought it sounded cool.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-SIXPerenelle Flamel was puzzled.Creeping along the dimly lit corridors, she’d discovered that all the lowercells of the island prison were filled with creatures from the darker edges ofmyth. The Sorceress had encountered a dozen different vampire breeds and variouswerebeasts, as well as boggarts, trolls and cluricauns. One cell held nothingbut a sleeping child minotaur, while in the cell opposite, two cannibal Windigolay unconscious alongside a trio of oni. An entire corridor of cells was givenover to dragon-kin, wyverns and firedrakes.Perenelle didn’t think they were prisoners—none of the cells were locked—yetthey were all asleep, and they were secured behind the shining silver spider’sweb. Still, she wasn’t sure whether that was to keep the creatures prisoners orkeep them apart. None of the creatures she’d discovered were allies. She passedone cell where the web hung in ragged tatters. The cell was empty, but the weband floor were clogged with bones, none of them even vaguely human.These were creatures from a dozen lands and as many mythologies. Some—like theWindigo—she had only heard of, but at least they were native to the Americancontinent. Others, as far as she knew, had never traveled to the New World andhad remained safe and secure in their homelands or in Shadowrealms that borderedthose lands. Japanese oni should not coexist alongside Celtic peists.There was something terribly wrong here.Perenelle rounded a corner and felt a breeze ruffle her hair. She turned herface to it, nostrils flaring, smelling salt and seaweed. With a quick glanceover her shoulder, she hurried down the corridor.Dee had to be collecting these creatures, had to be gathering them together, butwhy? And more importantly, how? Capturing a single vetala was unheard of, but adozen? And how had they managed to get a baby minotaur away from its mother?Even Scathach, as fearless and deadly as she was, would never face down one ofthe bull-headed race if she could help it.Perenelle came to a flight of steps. The smell of salt air was stronger now, thebreeze cooler, but she hesitated before putting her foot down and bent to checkthe stair for silver strands. There were none. She still hadn’t spotted whateverhad spun the webs that festooned the lower cells, and it was making herincredibly nervous. It suggested that the web creators were probablysleeping…which meant that they would wake up sooner or later. When they did, theentire prison would be swarming with spiders—or maybe worse—and she didn’t wantto be out in the open when that happened.A little of her power had returned—certainly enough to defend herself, thoughthe moment she used her magic, it would draw the sphinx to her andsimultaneously weaken and age her. Perenelle knew she would only get one chanceto face down the creature, and she wanted—needed—to be as powerful as possiblefor that encounter. Darting up the creaking metal stairs, she stopped at therust-eaten door. Pushing back her hair, she placed her ear against the corrodedmetal. All she could hear was the dull pounding of the sea as it continued toeat away at the island. Gripping the handle in both hands, she gently bore downon it and pushed the door open, gritting her teeth as old hinges squeaked andsqualled, the sound echoing through the corridors.Perenelle stepped out into a broad courtyard surrounded by ruined and tumbledbuildings. To the right the sun was sinking in the west, and it painted thestones in a warm orange light. With a sigh of relief, she spread her arms wide,turned her face to the sun, threw her head back and closed her eyes. Staticcrackled and ran along the length of her black hair, lifting it off hershoulders as her aura immediately began to recharge. The wind whipping in offthe bay was cool, and she breathed deeply, ridding her lungs of the stench ofrot, mildew and the monsters below.And then she suddenly realized what all the creatures in the cells had incommon: they were monsters.Where were the gentler spirits, the sprites and fey, the huldra and the rusalka,the elves and the inari? Dee had only gathered the hunters, the predators: theMagician was assembling an army of monsters.A savage howling shriek ripped through the island, vibrating the very stonesbeneath her feet. “Sorceress!”The sphinx had discovered Perenelle was missing.“Where are you, Sorceress?” The fresh sea air was suddenly tainted with thestink of the sphinx.Perenelle was turning back to close the door when she spotted movement in theshadows below. She’d looked into the sun too long, and the golden ball had leftburning afterimages on her retina. She squeezed her eyes shut for a moment; thenshe opened them again to peer into the gloom.The shadows were moving, flowing down the walls, gathering at the bottom of thesteps.Perenelle shook her head. These were no shadows. This was a mass of creatures,thousands, tens of thousands of them. They flowed up the stairs, slowing only asthey approached the light.Perenelle knew what they were then—spiders, deadly and poisonous—and knew whythe webs were so different. She glimpsed a seething mass of wolf spiders andtarantulas, black widows and brown recluses, garden spiders and funnel webs. Sheknew they should not exist together…which probably meant that whatever hadcalled them, and now controlled them, probably lurked below.The Sorceress slammed the metal door shut and wedged a lump of masonry againstthe base. Then she turned and ran. But she had only taken a dozen steps beforethe door was ripped off its hinges by the weight of the massed spiders."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVENJosh wearily pushed open the door to the kitchen and stepped into the long lowroom. Sophie turned away from the sink and watched her brother slump into achair, drop the stone sword onto the floor, lay his arms on the table and resthis head on them.“How was it?” Sophie asked.“I can barely move,” he mumbled. “My shoulders ache, my back aches, my armsache, my head aches, I have blisters on my hands and I can barely close myfingers.” He showed her his raw palms. “I never realized just holding a swordwould be so hard.”“But did you learn anything?”“I learned how to hold it.”Sophie slid a plateful of toast across the table and Josh immediatelystraightened up, grabbed a piece and shoved it in his mouth. “At least you canstill eat,” she said. Catching hold of his right hand, she turned it over tolook at his palm. “Ouch!” she said in sympathy. The skin at the base of histhumb was red, bubbling up in a painful-looking water blister.“Told you,” he said through a mouthful of toast. “I need a Band-Aid.”“Let me try something.” Sophie quickly rubbed her hands together, then pressedthe thumb of her left hand against her right wrist. Closing her eyes, sheconcentrated…and her little finger popped alight, burning with a cool blueflame.Josh stopped chewing and stared.Before he could object, Sophie ran her finger over his blistered flesh. Heattempted to pull away, but she held his wrist with surprising strength. Whenshe finally let it go, he jerked his hand back.“What do you think you’re…,” he began, looking at his hand. Then he discoveredthat the blister had vanished, leaving only the faint hint of a circle on hisskin.“Francis told me that fire can heal.” Sophie held up her right hand. Wisps ofgray smoke curled off her fingers; then they snapped alight. When she closed herhand into a fist, the fire extinguished.“I thought”—Josh swallowed hard and tried again—“I didn’t know you’d evenstarted to learn about fire.”“Started and finished.”“Finished?”“All done.” She brushed her hands together; sparks flew.Chewing his toast, Josh looked at his sister critically. When she’d first beenAwakened and when she’d learned the Magic of Air, he’d seen the differences inher immediately, especially around her face and eyes. He’d even noted the newsubtle shading of her eye color. He couldn’t see any changes this time. Shelooked the same as before…but she wasn’t. And the Fire magic distanced her evenfurther from him. “You don’t seem any different,” he said.“I don’t feel any different either. Except warmer,” she added. “I don’t feelcold.”So this was his sister now, Josh thought. She looked just like any otherteenager he knew. And yet…she was unlike anyone else on the planet: she couldcontrol two of the elemental magics.Maybe that was the scariest part of all this: the immortal humans—people likeFlamel and Perenelle, Joan, flamboyant Saint-Germain and even Dee: they alllooked so ordinary. They were the type of people you would pass in the streetand not give a second glance to. Scathach, with her red hair and grass greeneyes, was always going to attract attention. But she wasn’t human.“Did it…did it hurt?” he asked, curious.“Not at all.” She smiled. “It was almost disappointing. Francis sort of washedmy hands with fire…oh, and I got this,” she said, holding up her right arm andallowing her sleeve to fall back to reveal the design burned into her flesh.Josh leaned forward to look closely at Sophie’s arm. “It’s a tattoo,” he said,envy clearly audible in his voice. The twins had always talked about gettingtattoos together. “Mom is going to freak when she sees that.” Then he added,“Where did you get it? And why?”“It’s not ink, it was burned on with fire,” Sophie explained, twisting her wristto show off the design.Josh suddenly caught her hand and pointed at the red dot surrounded by the goldcircle on the underside of her wrist. “I’ve seen something like that before,” hesaid slowly, and frowned, trying to remember.His twin nodded. “It took me a while, but then I remembered that Nicholas hassomething like it on his wrist,” Sophie said. “A circle with a cross throughit.”“That’s right.” Josh closed his eyes. He’d first noted the small tattoo onFlamel’s wrist when he’d started working for him in the bookshop, and thoughhe’d wondered why it was in such an unusual place, he’d never asked about it. Heopened his eyes again and looked at the tattoo, and he suddenly realized thatSophie was branded by magic, marked as someone who could control the elements.And he didn’t like it. “What do you need it for?”“When I want to use fire, I press on the center of the circle and focus my aura.Saint-Germain called it a shortcut, a trigger for my power.”“I wonder what Flamel needs a trigger for,” Josh wondered aloud.The kettle pinged and Sophie turned back to the sink. She had asked herself thesame question. “Maybe we can ask him when he wakes up.”“Any more toast?” Josh asked. “I’m starving.”“You’re always starving.”“Yeah, well, the sword training made me hungry.”Sophie stuck a fork through a slice of bread and held it out in front of her.“Watch this,” she said. She pressed on the underside of her wrist and her indexfinger burst into flame. Frowning hard, concentrating, she focused the waveringflame into a thin blue fire and then ran it over the bread, gently toasting it.“Do you want this done on both sides?”Josh watched with a mixture of fascination and horror. He knew from scienceclass that bread toasted around 310 degrees Fahrenheit."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHTMachiavelli was sitting in the back of his car alongside Dr. John Dee. Facingthem were the three Disir. Dagon sat in the driver’s seat, eyes invisible behindhis wraparound glasses. The car smelled faintly of his sour fishy odor.A cell phone buzzed, breaking the uncomfortable silence. Machiavelli flipped itopen without looking at the screen. He closed it again almost immediately. “Allclear. My men have pulled back and there is a security cordon in place aroundall the connecting streets. No one will accidentally wander into the area.”“Whatever happens, do not enter the house,” the Disir with violet eyes said.“Once we free Nidhogg, we shall have very little control until it feeds.”John Dee leaned forward, and for a moment, it looked as if he was about to tapthe young woman on the knee. The look on her face prevented him. “Flamel and thechildren must not be allowed to escape.”“That sounds like a threat, Doctor,” the warrior sitting on the left said. “Oran order.”“And we do not like threats,” her sister sitting to the right added. “And wedon’t take orders.”Dee blinked slowly. “It is neither a threat nor an order. Simply a…request,” hesaid eventually.“We are here only for Scathach,” the warrior with violet eyes said. “The rest ofthem are not our concern.”Dagon climbed out of the car and opened the door. Without a backward glance, theValkyries stepped out into the first glimmers of predawn light, spread out andmoved slowly down the back street. They looked like three young women cominghome from an all-night party.Dee shifted position, taking the seat facing Machiavelli. “If they succeed, Iwill ensure that our masters know that the Disir were your idea,” he saidpleasantly.“I’m sure you will.” Machiavelli didn’t look at the English Magician andcontinued to follow the progress of the three girls as they walked down thestreet. “And if they fail, you can tell our masters that the Disir were my idea,and you can absolve yourself of any blame,” he added. “Shifting the blame: Ibelieve I originally came up with that concept about twenty years before youwere born.”“I thought you said they were bringing Nidhogg?” Dee asked, ignoring him.Niccolò Machiavelli tapped the window with his manicured fingernails. “Theydid.”As the Disir moved down the narrow, cobbled, high-walled alley, they changed.The transformation occurred as they passed through a patch of shadow. Theyentered as young women, dressed in soft leather jackets, jeans and boots…and amoment later they were Valkyries: warrior maidens. Long coats of ice white chainmail fell to their knees, knee-high metal boots with spiked toes covered theirfeet, and they wore heavy leather-and-metal gauntlets on their hands. Roundedhelmets protected their heads and masked their eyes and noses but left theirmouths free. White leather belts around their waists held their sword and knifesheaths. The Valkyries each carried a wide-bladed sword in one hand, but eachalso had a second weapon strapped to her back: a spear, a double-headed axe anda war hammer.They stopped before a rotting green gate set into the wall. One of the Valkyriesturned to look back at the car and pointed a gloved hand at the gate.Machiavelli hit a button and the window rolled down. He raised his thumb andnodded. Despite its decrepit appearance, it was the back gate to Saint-Germain’shouse.Each of the Disir reached into a leather pouch that hung from her belt. Takingout a handful of flat stonelike objects, they tossed them at the base of thedoor.“They’re Casting the Runes,” Machiavelli explained. “They’re calling Nidhogg…thecreature you released, a creature the Elders themselves locked away.”“I didn’t know it was trapped by the World Tree,” Dee muttered.“I’m surprised. I thought you knew everything.” Machiavelli shifted in the seatto look at Dee. In the gloomy half-light, he could see that the Magician waslooking pale and there was the faintest sheen of sweat on his forehead.Centuries of controlling his emotions ensured that Machiavelli didn’t smile.“Why did you destroy the Yggdrasill?” he asked.“It was the source of Hekate’s power,” Dee said quietly, eyes fixed on theValkyries, watching them intently. They had stepped back from the stones they’ddropped on the ground and were talking quietly amongst themselves, pointing outindividual tiles.“It was as old as this planet. And yet you destroyed it without a secondthought. Why did you do that?” Machiavelli wondered aloud.“I did what was necessary.” Dee’s words were ice. “I will always do whatever isnecessary to bring the Elders back to this world.”“But you didn’t consider the consequences,” Niccolò Machiavelli said softly.“Every action has a consequence. The Yggdrasill you destroyed in Hekate’skingdom stretched into several other Shadowrealms. The topmost branches reachedthe Shadowrealm of Asgard, and the roots stretched deep into Niflheim, the Worldof Darkness.” He saw Dee stiffen. “Not only did you release Nidhogg, but youalso destroyed at least three Shadowrealms—maybe more—when you destroyed theWorld Tree.”“I didn’t know….”“You made a lot of enemies,” Machiavelli continued smoothly, ignoring him,“dangerous enemies. I have heard that the Elder Hel escaped the destruction ofher kingdom. I understand she is hunting you.”“She does not frighten me,” Dee snapped, but there was a quaver in his voice.“Oh, she should,” Machiavelli murmured. “She terrifies me.”“My master will protect me,” Dee said confidently.“He must be a powerful Elder indeed to protect you from Hel; no one has stoodagainst her and survived.”“My master is all-powerful,” Dee snapped.“I look forward to learning the identity of this mysterious Elder.”“When all this is over, maybe I’ll introduce you,” Dee said. He nodded down thealleyway. “And that could be very soon.” The runestones hissed and sizzled on the ground.They were irregular pieces of flat black stone, each etched with a series ofangular lines, squares and slashes. Now the lines were glowing red, crimsonsmoke coiling into the still predawn air.One of the Disir used the tip of her sword to move three of the runestonestogether. A second nudged a stone out of the way with the steel toe of her bootand then dragged another into place. The third found a single runestone at theedge of the pile and eased it into position at the end of the string of letterswith her sword.“Nidhogg,” the Disir whispered, calling the nightmare whose name they hadspelled out in the ancient stones.image [images/Scot_9780375849084_epub_002_r1.jpg]“Nidhogg,” Machiavelli said very quietly. He looked over Dee’s shoulder to whereDagon sat staring straight ahead, apparently disinterested in what was happeningto his left. “I know what the legends say about it, but Dagon, what exactly isit?”“My people called it the Devourer of Corpses,” the driver said, voice sticky andbubbling. “It was already here before my race claimed the seas, and we wereamongst the first to arrive on this planet.”Dee quickly swiveled in the seat to look at the driver. “What are you?”Dagon ignored the question. “Nidhogg was so dangerous that a council of theElder Race created a terrible Shadowrealm, Niflheim, the World of Darkness, tocontain it, and then they used the unbreakable roots of the Yggdrasill to wraparound the creature, chaining it for eternity.”Machiavelli kept his eyes fixed on the red-black smoke coiling from therunestones. He thought he saw the outline of a shape beginning to form. “Whydidn’t the Elders kill it?”“Nidhogg was a weapon,” Dagon said.“What did the Elders need a weapon for?” Machiavelli wondered aloud. “Theirpowers were almost limitless. They had no enemies.”Although he sat with his hands resting lightly on the steering wheel, Dagon’sshoulders shifted and his head turned almost completely around so that he wasfacing Dee and Machiavelli. “The Elders were not the first upon this earth,” hesaid simply. “There were…others.” He pronounced the word slowly and carefully.“The Elders used Nidhogg and some of the other primordial creatures as weaponsin the Great War to completely destroy them.”A stunned Machiavelli looked at Dee, who looked equally shocked by therevelation.Dagon’s mouth opened in what might have been a smile, revealing his tooth-filledmaw. “You should probably know that the last time a group of Disir used Nidhogg,they lost control of the creature. It ate all of them. In the three days it tookto recapture it and chain it in Yggdrasill’s roots, it completely destroyed theAnasazi people in what is now New Mexico. It is said that Nidhogg feasted offten thousand humani and still hungered for more.”“Can these Disir control it?” Dee demanded.Dagon shrugged. “Thirteen of the finest Disir warriors couldn’t control it inNew Mexico….”“Maybe we should—” Dee began.Machiavelli suddenly stiffened. “Too late,” he whispered. “It’s here.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE“I’m going to bed.” Sophie Newman paused by the kitchen door, a glass of waterin her hand, and looked back to where Josh was still sitting at the table.“Francis is going to teach me some specific fire spells in the morning. Hepromised to show me the fireworks trick.”“Great, we’ll never have to buy fireworks again for the Fourth of July.”Sophie smiled tiredly. “Don’t stay up too long, it’s nearly dawn.”Josh shoved another piece of toast into his mouth. “I’m still on Pacific time,”he said, his voice muffled. “But I’ll be up in a few minutes. Scatty wants tocontinue my sword training tomorrow. I’m really looking forward to it.”“Liar, liar.”He grunted. “Well, you’ve got your magic to protect you…all I have is a stonesword.”The bitterness was clearly audible in his voice, and Sophie forced herself notto comment. She was getting tired of her brother’s constant whining. She hadnever asked to be Awakened; she hadn’t wanted to know the Witch’s magic orSaint-Germain’s, either. But it had happened and she was dealing with it, andJosh would just have to get over it. “Good night,” she said. She closed the doorbehind her, leaving Josh alone in the kitchen.When he finished the last of the toast, he gathered up his plate and glass andcarried them both to the sink. He ran hot water over the plate, then set it todrip dry in the wire dish rack beside the deep ceramic sink. Refilling his glassfrom the jug of filtered water, he crossed to the kitchen door, pulled it openand stepped out into the tiny garden. Although it was almost dawn, he didn’tfeel the least bit tired, but then again, he reminded himself, he had slept formost of the day. Over the high wall, he couldn’t see much of the Parisianskyline except for the warm orange glow from the streetlights. He looked up, butthere were no stars visible in the heavens. Sitting on the step, he breatheddeeply. The air was cool and damp, just like San Francisco’s, though it lackedthe familiar salt tang that he loved; it was tainted instead with unfamiliarsmells, few of which were pleasant. He felt a sneeze gathering at the back ofhis nose and sniffed hard, eyes watering. There was the stench of overflowingtrash cans and rotting fruit, and he detected a nastier, fouler stink that wasvaguely familiar. Closing his mouth, he breathed deeply through his nose, tryingto identify it: what was it? It was something he’d smelled very recently….Snake.Josh leapt to his feet. There weren’t snakes in Paris, were there? Deep in hischest, Josh felt his heart begin to beat faster. He was terrified of snakes, abone-chilling fear that he could trace back to when he’d been about ten. He’dbeen camping with his father in Wupatki National Monument in Arizona when he’dslipped off a trail and slid down an incline, straight into a rattlesnake nest.When the dust had cleared, he’d realized he was lying next to a six-foot-longsnake. The creature had raised its wedge-shaped head and stared at him with coalblack eyes for what was probably no more than a second—though it felt like alifetime—before Josh had managed to scramble out, too terrified and breathlesseven to scream. He’d never been able to work out why the snake hadn’t attackedhim, though his father told him that rattlesnakes were actually shy and that ithad probably just eaten. He’d had nightmares about the incident for weeksafterward, and after every one he would wake up with that smell of serpent muskin his nostrils.He was smelling it now.And it was getting stronger.Josh started backing up the steps. There was a sudden scrabbling sound, like asquirrel running up the side of a tree. Then, directly in front of him, on theother side of the small courtyard, claws, each one the length of his hand,appeared over the top of the nine-foot-high wall. They moved around slowly,almost delicately, questing for a hold, and then abruptly gripped hard enoughfor the talons to bite deep into the old bricks. Josh froze, all the breathleaving his body in one shocked exhalation.The arms that followed were covered in thick knobbled hide…and then the head ofa monster appeared over the wall. It was long and slablike, with two roundednostrils on the end of a blunt snout directly over its mouth and solid blackeyes sunk deep behind circular depressions on either side of its skull. Unableto move, unable to breathe, his heart hammering so hard it was physicallyshaking his body, Josh watched the huge head swivel lazily from side to side, animmensely long, ghastly white forked tongue flickering in the air. It froze,then slowly, very slowly, shifted its head and looked down at Josh. The meresttip of its tongue tasted the air and then it opened its mouth wide—impossiblywide, enough to swallow him whole—and the boy saw a mouthful of teeth: sharp,ragged curved daggers.Josh wanted to turn and run screaming, but he couldn’t. There was somethingmesmerizing about the appalling creature clambering over the wall. All his lifehe’d been fascinated by dinosaurs: he’d collected fossils, eggs, bones andteeth—even dinosaur coprolites. And now he was looking at a living dinosaur.There was even a part of his brain that identified the creature—or at least,what it resembled. It was a Komodo dragon. They didn’t grow much longer than tenfeet in the wild, but he could already see that this creature was at least threetimes that.Stone cracked. An old brick exploded into dust, and then a second, a third.Then there was a crunching, snapping, ripping sound, and—almost in slowmotion—Josh watched as the wall, with the creature draped over the top, swayed,then crashed to the ground. The metal door buckled in two, popped off its hingesand shattered against the water fountain, tearing a huge chunk out of the basin.The monster smashed to the ground, unaffected by the stones raining down aroundit. The noise jolted Josh free and he staggered back up the steps just as themonster lumbered to its feet and shuffled forward, heading straight for thehouse. The boy slammed the door closed and rammed home the bolts. He was turningaway when through the kitchen window he spotted the figure in white, clutchingwhat looked like a sword, step through the gaping hole that had been the wall.Josh grabbed the stone sword off the floor and dashed into the hall. “Wake up!”he shouted, his voice so filled with terror even he didn’t recognize it.“Sophie! Flamel! Anyone!”The door behind him shook in its frame. He snapped a quick glance over hisshoulder in time to see the monster’s white tongue peel off the wood and glass.“Help!”Glass shattered and the tongue shot into the kitchen, sweeping plates to thefloor, scattering pots and pans, knocking over a chair. Metal hissed where thetongue brushed against it; wood turned black and burned; plastic melted. A dropof the corrosive saliva dripped to the floor and bubbled on the tiles, eatinginto the stone.Instinctively, Josh lashed out at the tongue with Clarent. The sword barelytouched it, but it suddenly disappeared, darting back into the creature’s mouth.There was a single still moment, and then the monster rammed its entire head atthe door.The door crumpled to matchwood; the supporting walls on either side cracked asstones were knocked out. The creature drew its head back and slammed it into theopening again, punching a large hole into the kitchen. The entire house creakedominously.A hand fell on Josh’s shoulder, almost stopping his heart. “Now look what you’vedone: you’ve just gone and made it mad.”Scathach strode into the wrecked kitchen and stood in the gaping hole created bythe creature’s blows. “Nidhogg,” she said, and Josh was unsure whether she wastalking to him, “which means the Disir are not far behind.” She sounded almostpleased with the news.Scathach danced backward as Nidhogg’s head slammed into the opening again. Itshuge nostrils opened wide and its white tongue slapped against the spot where,an instant before, the Shadow had been standing. A glob of spittle burned on thetile, turning it to a liquid sludge. Scathach’s twin swords darted out,flickering gray and silver, and two long cuts appeared on the white flesh of thecreature’s forked tongue.Without taking her eyes off the creature, Scathach said to Josh, almost calmly,“Get the others out of the house, I’ll take care of this….”And then an enormous claw-tipped arm smashed through the window, wrapped aroundthe Warrior’s body in a viselike grip and slammed her back against the wall withenough force to crack the plaster. The Warrior’s arms were trapped against herbody, her swords useless. Nighogg’s huge head appeared in the ruined side of thehouse, and then its mouth opened wide and its tongue darted out toward Scathach.Once its sticky acid-coated tongue wrapped around the defenseless Warrior, itwould drag her into its cavernous maw."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTYSophie flew down the stairs, sparks and streamers of blue fire trailing from heroutstretched fingers.She’d been standing in the bathroom brushing her teeth when the entire house hadshaken. She’d heard the rumbling crash of bricks, which had been followed aheartbeat later by her brother’s scream. It had ripped through the silent houseand was the most terrifying sound she had ever heard.She was running down the corridor past Flamel’s room when the door opened. For asingle instant she almost didn’t recognize the confused-looking old man standingin the doorway. The rings under his eyes were so dark they looked like bruises,and his skin was an unhealthy yellowish hue. “What’s happening?” he mumbled, butSophie hurried past: she had no answers for him. All she knew was that herbrother was downstairs.And then the entire house shook again.She felt the vibration through the floors and walls. All the pictures on thewall to her left shifted and tilted off center.Terrified, Sophie raced down the stairs to the first floor just as a bedroomdoor opened and Joan appeared. One moment the small woman was wearing shinyblue-green satin pajamas—and the next she was clad in full metal armor, a longbroad-bladed sword in her gloved hands. “Get back,” Joan snapped, her Frenchaccent pronounced.“No,” Sophie shouted. “It’s Josh—he’s in trouble!”Joan fell into step beside her, armor clinking and rasping. “OK then, but staybehind me and to my right, so I always know where you are,” Joan commanded. “Didyou see Nicholas?”“He’s awake. But he looked sick.”“Exhaustion. He daren’t try any more magic in his condition. It could kill him.”“Where’s Francis?”“Probably in the attic. But the room is soundproofed and he’ll have hisheadphones on and the bass pumped up; I doubt he’s heard anything.”“I’m sure he felt the house shake.”“Probably thought it was a good bass line.”“I don’t know where Scatty is,” Sophie said. She was fighting hard to keep thebubbling panic inside from overwhelming her.“With any luck, she’s downstairs in the kitchen with Josh. If she is, then he’sOK,” Joan added. “Now follow me.” Holding the sword upright in both hands, thewoman moved cautiously down the last flight of stairs and stepped into the broadmarbled hallway at the front of the house. She stopped so suddenly that Sophiealmost walked into her. Joan pointed toward the front door. Sophie spotted theghostly white shape behind the stained-glass panels, and then there was acrunching snap…and the head of an axe appeared through the door. Then, with acrack, the front door was smashed open in a shower of wood and glass fragments.Two figures stepped into the hallway.In the light of the ornate crystal chandelier, Sophie saw that they were youngwomen in white chain-mail armor, their faces hidden behind helmets, one wieldinga sword and an axe, the other carrying a sword and a spear. She reactedinstinctively. Gripping her right wrist with her left hand, she splayed open herfingers, palm outward. Crackling blue-green flames splashed across the floordirectly in front of the two girls, shooting upward in a solid sheet of waveringemerald fire.The women stepped through the flames without even pausing but stopped when theyspotted Joan in her armor. They looked at one another, obviously confused.“You’re not the silver humani. Who are you?” one demanded.“This is my house, and I think that’s my question,” Joan said grimly. She turnedsideways, left shoulder toward the women, holding her sword in both hands, thepoint moving in a slow figure eight between the warriors.“Stand aside. We have no argument with you,” one said.Joan lifted the sword, bringing the hilt close to her face, the tip of thelongsword pointing straight up. “You come into my home and tell me to standaside,” she said incredulously. “Who are you…what are you?” she demanded.“We are the Disir,” the woman with the sword and spear said softly. “We are herefor Scathach. Our argument is only with her. But do not stand in our way or itwill become your argument.”“The Shadow is my friend,” Joan said.“Then that makes you our enemy.”Without warning, the Valkyries attacked together, one lunging with sword andspear, the other with sword and axe. Joan’s heavy blade shifted, metal clanging,the movement almost too fast to see as she blocked sword thrusts, turned asidethe axe and batted down the spear.The Disir backed away and spread out until they were standing on either side ofJoan. She had to keep turning her head to be able to watch them both.“You fight well.”Joan’s lips pulled away from her teeth in a savage smile. “I was taught by thebest. Scathach herself trained me.”“I thought I recognized the style,” the second Disir said.Only Joan’s gray eyes moved as she tracked the two warriors. “I didn’t think Ihad a style.”“Neither has Scathach.”“Who are you?” the Disir on the right asked. “In my lifetime I’ve known only ahandful who could stand against us. And none of them were humani.”“I am Joan of Arc,” she replied simply.“Never heard of you,” the Disir said, and while she was speaking, her sister,standing to Joan’s left, drew back her arm, poised to throw the spear…The weapon burst into white-hot flames.With a savage howl, the Disir flung the spear to one side; by the time it hitthe ground, the wooden shaft was little more than ash and the wickedly pointedmetal head was melting into a bubbling puddle.Standing on the bottom step, Sophie blinked in surprise. She hadn’t known shecould do that.The Disir to Joan’s right darted forward, sword and axe weaving a deadly hummingpattern in the air before her, battering at Joan’s sword, driving her back underthe vicious onslaught.The second Disir rounded on Sophie.Setting the spear shaft alight and melting the head had exhausted her, and sheslumped against the banister. But she needed to help Joan; she needed to get toJosh. Pressing hard on the underside of her wrist, Sophie attempted to call uponher Fire magic. Smoke curled from her hand, but there was no fire.The Disir strode forward until she was standing directly in front of the girl.Sophie was standing on a step, and the girls’ faces were almost level. “So, youare the silver humani the English Magician wants so desperately.” Behind hermetal mask, the Valkyrie’s violet eyes were contemptuous.Drawing in a deep shuddering breath, Sophie straightened. She stretched out botharms, fingers closed into tight fists. Closing her eyes, breathing deeply,trying to calm her thundering heart, she visualized gloves of flame; she sawherself bringing her hands together, shaping a ball of fire in her fists likedough and then flinging it at the figure standing before her. But when sheopened her eyes, only the merest hints of gossamer blue flames danced over herflesh. She clapped her hands together and sparks danced harmlessly across thewarrior’s chain mail.The Disir tapped her sword against her gloved hand. “Your petty fire tricks donot impress me.”A tremendous crash from the kitchen shook the house again. The ornate chandelierover the center of the hallway started to sway to and fro, tinkling musically asthe shadows danced.“Josh,” Sophie whispered. Her fear turned to anger: this creature was preventingher from getting to her brother. And the anger gave her strength. Rememberingwhat Saint-Germain had done on the roof, the girl pointed her index finger atthe warrior and unleashed her rage in a single focused beam.A dirty yellow-black spear of solid fire leapt from Sophie’s finger and explodedagainst the Disir’s chain mail. Fire splashed all over the warrior, and theforce of the blow drove her to her knees. She shouted an incomprehensible wordthat sounded like a wolf’s howl.Across the hall, Joan took advantage of the distraction and pressed her attackerhard, pushing her back toward the gaping ruin of a door. The two women wereevenly matched, and while Joan’s sword was longer and heavier than heropponent’s, the Disir had the advantage of wielding two weapons. In addition, ithad been a long time since Joan had worn armor and fought with a sword. Shecould feel the burn in the muscles of her shoulders, and her hips and knees wereaching from the weight of the metal she was carrying. She had to finish this.The fallen Valkyrie climbed to her feet in front of Sophie. The front of herchain mail had taken the full force of the fire bolt, and the links had meltedand run like softened wax. The warrior grabbed a handful of the mail and rippedit away from her body, flinging it aside. The plain white robe underneath wasscorched and blackened, with sparkling chunks of metal melted into the cloth.“Little girl,” the Disir whispered, “I am going to teach you never to play withfire.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTY-ONENidhogg’s sticky tongue unfurled through the air toward Scathach, who was stillpinned against the kitchen wall, wrapped tightly in the creature’s claws. TheWarrior fought in complete silence, struggling in the monster’s grip, wrenchingherself from side to side, boot heels scrambling for purchase on the slipperytiled floor. With her arms pinned to her sides, she was unable to use her shortswords.Josh knew that if he even paused for thought, he was not going to be able to gothrough with what he meant to do. The smell of the creature was making him sickto his stomach, and his heart was thumping so hard he could barely catch hisbreath.The forked tongue brushed across the table, leaving a deep burn mark on thewood. It punched right through a wooden chair as it headed straight for theWarrior’s head.All he had to do, Josh kept reminding himself, was to think of his sword as afootball. Holding Clarent high above his head in the two-handed grip Joan hadshown him earlier, he launched himself forward in a move that the coach at hislast school had spent an entire season trying—and failing—to teach him.But even as he was jumping, he knew he’d miscalculated. The tongue was movingtoo fast, and he was too far away. With a last desperate effort, he flung thesword from his hand.The flat of the blade struck the side of Nidhogg’s meaty tongue. And stuck fast.Years of tae kwon do training took over as Josh crashed onto the tiled floor. Hehit it hard but still managed to slap it with the palm of his hand, sending hisbody forward into a neat roll that brought him back to his feet…within inches ofthe meaty acid-dripping tongue. And the sword.Catching hold of the hilt, he used all his strength to pull it away from thetongue—it came free with a sticky Velcro sound, and the tongue sizzled andhissed as it snapped back into the monster’s mouth. Josh knew that if hestopped, both he and Scatty were dead. He plunged Clarent point first into theserpent’s arm just above the wrist joint. As the blade sank smoothly into thealligator-like hide, it began to vibrate, a high-pitched keening sound that setJosh’s teeth on edge. He felt a rush of warmth flowing up his arm and into hischest. A heartbeat later, a surge of strength and energy wiped away his achesand pains. His aura blossomed bright blinding gold, and there was a tracery oflight curling around the gray stone blade when he wrenched it out of thecreature.“The claws, Josh. Cut off a claw,” Scathach grunted as Nidhogg shook her hard.The two swords fell from her hands and clattered to the floor.Josh lashed out at the monster, trying to cut off a claw, but the heavy stoneblade turned at the last moment and bounced harmlessly off its foot. He triedagain, and this time the sword struck sparks off the creature’s armored hide.“Hey! Be careful,” Scathach yelped as the swinging blade came dangerously closeto her head. “That’s one of the few weapons that really can kill me.”“Sorry,” Josh muttered through clenched teeth. “I’ve never done anything likethis before.” He slashed out at the claw again. Sparks flew into the Warrior’sface. “Why do we want a claw?” he grunted, hacking at the iron-hard skin.“It can only be killed with one of its own claws,” Scathach said, her voicesurprisingly calm. “Look out! Get back!”Josh turned just as the thing’s huge head lunged forward, pushing into the sideof the ruined house, its white tongue darting forward again. It was coming forhim. It was moving too fast; there was nowhere to go—and if he did move, itwould just hit Scatty. Planting his feet firmly, both hands wrapped tightlyaround Clarent’s hilt, he held the sword before his face. He closed his eyes atthe approaching horror—and immediately opened them again. If he was going todie, he’d do it with his eyes open.It was like playing a video game, he thought—except that this game was deadly.Almost in slow motion, he saw the two ends of the forked tongue wrap around theblade—as if it was going to wrench it from Josh’s hand. He tightened his grip,determined not to let the sword go.When the flesh of the creature’s tongue touched the stone blade, the effect wasimmediate.The creature froze, then convulsed and hissed, the sound like escaping steam.The acid from its tongue bubbled on the blade as the sword trembled in Josh’shand, vibrating like a tuning fork, growing warm, then hot, and started to glowwith a stark white light. He squeezed his eyes shut……and behind his closed eyes, Josh glimpsed a series of flickering images: ablasted and ruined landscape of black rock, pockmarked with pools of bubblingred lava, while overhead, the sky boiled with filthy clouds that rained ash andcinders. Spread across the sky, dangling from the clouds, were what looked likethe roots of a huge tree. The roots were the source of the bitter white ash:they were dissolving, withering, dying….Nidhogg jerked its blackened tongue free.Josh gasped and opened his eyes just as his aura flared again,stronger—brighter—this time, blinding him. Panicked, waving the sword beforehim, he backed up until he felt the kitchen wall against his shoulder blades. Hekept blinking furiously, wanting to rub his eyes, but he didn’t dare loosen hisgrip on the sword. All around him, he heard stones fall, plaster split, woodcreak and snap, and he hunched his shoulders, expecting something to comecrashing down on his head. “Scatty?” he called.But there was no reply.His voice rose. “Scatty!”Squinting hard, blinking away the spots dancing before his eyes, he saw themonster dragging Scathach out of the house. Its tongue, now black and brown, washanging loosely out of the side of its mouth. Holding the Warrior in a crushinggrip, it turned on its own length and pushed through the devastated garden, itslong tail slicing chunks out of the side of the house, smashing through the onlyunbroken window. Then the creature rose up on its two hind legs, like a collaredlizard, and clattered down the alleyway, almost trampling underfoot the figurein white chain-mail armor standing guard. Without hesitation the figuredisappeared after the creature.Josh stumbled through the gaping hole in the side of the house and stopped. Heglanced over his shoulder. The once-neat kitchen was a shredded ruin. Then helooked at the sword in his hand and smiled. He’d stopped the monster. His smilewidened to a broad grin. He’d fought it off and saved his sister and everyoneelse in the house…except Scatty.Taking a deep breath, Josh jumped down the steps and raced across the garden andout into the alley, following the monster. “I can’t believe I’m doing this,” hemuttered. “I don’t even like Scatty. Well…not that much,” he amended."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTY-TWONiccolò Machiavelli had always been a careful man.He had survived and even thrived in the dangerous and deadly Medici court inFlorence in the fifteenth century, a time when intrigue was a way of life andviolent death and assassination was commonplace. His most famous book, ThePrince, was one of the first to suggest that the use of subterfuge, lies anddeceit was perfectly acceptable for a ruler.Machiavelli was a survivor because he was subtle, cautious, clever and, aboveall else: cunning.So what had possessed him to call upon the Disir? The Valkyries had no word forsubtle in their language and didn’t know the meaning of the word caution. Theiridea of clever and cunning was to bring Nidhogg—an uncontrollable primevalmonster—into the heart of a modern city.And he had allowed them.Now the street echoed with the sounds of breaking glass, snapping wood andtumbling stone. Every car and house alarm in the district was blaring, and therewere lights on in all the other houses lining the alleyway, though no one hadventured out yet.“What is going on in there?” Machiavelli wondered aloud.“Nidhogg is feasting off Scathach?” Dee suggested absently. His cell had startedto buzz, distracting him.“No, it’s not!” Machiavelli suddenly shouted. He pushed open the car door, leaptout, grabbed Dee by the collar and dragged him out into the night. “Dagon! Out!”Dee attempted to find his feet, but Machiavelli continued to drag him backward,away from the car. “Are you out of your mind?” the doctor shrieked.There was a sudden explosion of glass as Dagon threw himself through thewindshield. He slithered off the hood and landed alongside Machiavelli and Dee,but the Magician didn’t even glance in his direction. He saw what had startledthe Italian.Nidhogg raced down the narrow alley toward them, standing tall on two powerfulhind legs. A limp red-haired figure hung from its front claws.“Back!” Machiavelli shouted, flinging himself to the ground, dragging Dee withhim.Nidhogg trampled over the long black German car. One hind paw landed directly inthe center of the roof, crushing it to the pavement. Windows popped, sprayingglass like shrapnel as the car buckled in the middle, the front and rear wheelslifting off the ground.The creature disappeared into the night.A heartbeat later, a white-clad Disir practically flew over the remains of thecar, clearing it in a single leap, following the creature.“Dagon?” Machiavelli whispered, rolling over. “Dagon, where are you?”“I’m here.” The driver came smoothly to his feet, brushing shards of sparklingglass from his black suit. He pulled off his cracked sunglasses and dropped themon the ground. Rainbow colors ran across round unblinking eyes. “It was holdingScathach,” he said, loosening his black tie and popping open the top button ofhis white shirt.“Is she dead?” Machiavelli asked.“I’ll not believe Scathach is dead until I see it for myself.”“Agreed. Over the years there have been too many reports of her death. And thenshe turns up! We need a body.”Dee climbed out of a mud-filled puddle; he suspected Machiavelli might havedeliberately pushed him into it. He shook water from his shoe. “If Nidhogg hasher, then the Shadow is dead. We’ve succeeded.”Dagon’s fish eye swiveled down to look into the Magician’s face. “You blinkered,arrogant fool! Something in the house frightened away Nidhogg—that’s why it’srunning, and it can’t be the Shadow because it’s got her. And remember, this isa creature beyond fear. Three Disir went into that building—and only one cameout! Something terrible happened in there.”“Dagon is right: this is a disaster. We need to completely rethink ourstrategy.” Machiavelli turned to his driver. “I promised you that if the Disirfailed, then Scathach was yours.”Dagon nodded. “And you have always kept your word.”“You have been with me now for close to four hundred years. You have always beenloyal, and I owe you both my life and liberty. I free you from my service,”Machiavelli said formally. “Find the Shadow’s body…and if she is still alive,then do whatever you must do. Go now—and be safe, old friend.”Dagon turned away. Then he stopped suddenly and looked back at Machiavelli.“What did you call me?”Machiavelli smiled. “Old friend. Be careful,” he said gently. “The Shadow isbeyond dangerous, and she’s killed too many of my friends.”Dagon nodded. He pulled off his shoes and socks to reveal three-toed webbedfeet. “Nidhogg will head for the comfort of the river.” Abruptly, Dagon’stooth-filled mouth opened in what might have been a smile. “And the water is myhome.” Then he ran into the night, bare feet slapping the sidewalk.Machiavelli glanced back toward the house. Dagon was right; something hadterrified Nidhogg. What had happened in there? And where were the other twoDisir?Footsteps clattered on pavement and suddenly Josh Newman raced out of thealleyway, the stone sword in his hand streaming wisps of gold fire. Glancingneither left nor right, he ran around the destroyed car and followed thetelltale trail of car alarms set off by the monster’s passing.Machiavelli looked at Dee. “I take it that was the American boy?”Dee nodded.“Did you see what he was holding? It looked like a sword,” he said slowly. “Astone sword? Surely not Excalibur?”“Not Excalibur,” Dee said shortly.“It was definitely a gray stone blade.”“It wasn’t Excalibur.”“How do you know?” Machiavelli demanded.Dee reached under his coat and pulled out a short stone sword, a match of theweapon Josh was carrying. The blade was trembling, vibrating almostimperceptibly. “Because I have Excalibur,” Dee said. “The boy was holding itstwin, Clarent. We always suspected Flamel had it.”Machiavelli closed his eyes and raised his face to the sky. “Clarent. No wonderNidhogg fled from the house.” He shook his head. Could this night get any worse?Dee’s cell buzzed again and both men jumped. The Magician almost snapped thephone in two opening it. “What?” he snarled. He listened for a moment, thenclosed the phone very gently, and when he spoke again, his voice was barelyabove a whisper. “Perenelle has escaped. She’s free on Alcatraz.”Shaking his head, Machiavelli turned and walked down the alleyway, heading backtoward the Champs-Elysées. His question was answered. The night had just gottenworse—much worse. Nicholas Flamel frightened Machiavelli, but Perenelleterrified him."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE“I’m no little girl!” Sophie Newman was furious. “And I know more than just Firemagic. Disir.” The name popped into her head, and suddenly Sophie kneweverything the Witch of Endor knew about the creatures. The Witch despised them.“I know who you are,” she snapped, her eyes glowing an ugly silver. “Valkyries.”Even amongst the Elders, the Disir were different. They had never lived on DanuTalis but had kept to the frozen northlands at the top of the world, at home inthe bitter winds and sleeting ice.In the terrible centuries after the Fall of Danu Talis, the world had shifted onits axis and the Great Cold had gripped most of the earth. From the north andsouth ice sheets flowed across the landscape, pushing humani into the thinunfrozen green belt that existed around the equator. Entire civilizationsvanished, devastated by changing weather patterns, disease and famine. Sealevels rose, flooding the coastal cities, altering the landscape, while inlandthe encroaching ice wiped away all traces of towns and villages.The Disir soon discovered that their skills at surviving in the bitter northernclimate gave them a special advantage over races and civilizations who could notcope with the deadly, never-ending winter. Gangs of savage female warriorsquickly claimed most of the north, enslaving the cities that had escaped theice. They ruthlessly destroyed anyone who stood against them, and soon the Disirhad a second name: Valkyries, the Choosers of the Dead.Very quickly the Valkyries controlled a frozen empire that encompassed most ofthe Northern Hemisphere. They forced their humani slaves to worship them as godsand even demanded sacrifices. Uprisings were brutally suppressed. As the Ice Agegripped harder, the Disir began to look farther south, setting their sights onthe struggling remnants of civilization.Images tumbling and dancing in her head, Sophie watched as the reign of theDisir was ended in a single night. She knew what had happened millennia past.The Witch of Endor had worked with the repulsive Elder, Chronos, who could movethrough time itself. It had been necessary to sacrifice her eyes in order to seethe twisting strands of time, but it was a sacrifice she had never regretted.Scouring ten thousand years of time, she had chosen a single warrior from eachmillennium, and then Chronos had dipped into each era to pull the warriors backto the age of the Great Cold.Sophie knew that the Witch had especially requested that her own granddaughter,Scathach, be brought back to fight the Disir.It was the Shadow who had led the attack on the Disir stronghold, a city ofsolid ice close to the top of the world. She had slain the Valkyrie queen,Brynhildr, casting her into the heart of a flaming volcano.By the time the sun had risen low over the horizon, the power of the Valkyrieshad been broken forever, their frozen city had lain in melted ruins, and lessthan a handful had survived. They fled into a terrifying icy Shadowrealm thateven Scathach would not venture into. The surviving Disir called that nightRagnarök, the Doom of the Gods, and swore eternal vengeance on the Shadow.Sophie brought her hands together and a miniature whirlwind appeared in herpalms. Fire and ice had destroyed the Disir in the past. What would happen ifshe used a little Fire magic to heat up the wind? Even as the thought crossedSophie’s mind, the Disir leapt forward, her sword raised high over her head in atwo-handed grip. “Dee wants you alive, but he didn’t say unharmed…,” shesnarled.Sophie brought her hands to her mouth, pressed the thumb of her left had againstthe trigger on her wrist and blew hard. The whirlwind spiraled onto the floorand grew. It bounced once, twice…then hit the Disir.Sophie had superheated the air until it was hotter than a furnace. Theblistering whirlwind grabbed the Valkyrie, spun her around, rolled her over andtossed her high into the air. She crashed into the crystal chandelier, smashingall the bulbs save one. In the sudden gloom, the whirlwind dancing across thefloor glowed with shimmering orange heat. The Valkyrie crashed to the ground butwas immediately on her feet, even as shards of crystal crashed about her likeglass rain. Her pale skin was bright red and looked badly sunburned, her blondeyebrows completely singed off. Without a word, she slashed out with her sword,the heavy blade cutting right through the banister rail at Sophie’s hand.“Scatty!”Sophie heard her brother’s voice calling from the kitchen. He was in trouble!“Scatty!” she heard him call again.The Valkyrie surged forward. Another superheated whirlwind caught her, rippingthe sword from her hand and spinning her away, sending her tumbling into hersister, who had trapped Joan in a corner and battered her to her knees with aferocious onslaught. The two Disir crashed to the floor in a clatter of weaponsand armor.“Joan—get back!” Sophie shouted.Fog flowed from the girl’s fingers and curled across the floor; thick ribbonsand ropes of smoky air wrapped around the women, swathing them in chains ofscalding hot air. It took an enormous effort of will, but Sophie managed tothicken the fog, spinning it faster and faster around the struggling Disir untilthey were shrouded in a thick mummylike cocoon, similar to the one the Witch hadenfolded her in.Sophie could feel herself weakening, leaden exhaustion making her eyes grittyand her shoulders heavy. Drawing upon the remnants of her power, she clapped herhands and lowered the temperature of the air in the foggy cocoon so quickly thatit flash-froze into a crackling lump of solid ice.“There. You should feel right at home,” Sophie whispered hoarsely. She slumped,then forced herself to her feet and was about to dart into the kitchen when Joanstretched out her arm, stopping her. “Oh no you don’t. Me first.” The woman tooka step toward the kitchen door, then glanced over her shoulder to the block ofice, with the two Disir partially visible within. “You saved my life,” she saidsoftly.“You would have beaten her,” Sophie said confidently.“Maybe,” Joan conceded, “and maybe not. I’m not as young as I once was. But youstill saved my life,” she repeated, “and that’s a debt I’ll never forget.”Stretching out her left hand, she placed it flat against the kitchen door andapplied a gentle pressure. The door clicked open.And then fell off its hinges."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTY-FOURThe Comte de Saint-Germain strolled downstairs from his studio, tinynoise-canceling earphones pushed into his ears, eyes fixed on the screen of theMP3 player in his hands. He was trying to create a new playlist: his top tenfavorite sound tracks. Gladiator, naturally…The Rock…Star Wars, the first oneonly…El Cid, of course…The Crow, maybe…He stopped at the bottom step and automatically straightened a picture that washanging crooked on the wall. He took another step and realized that a framedgold disc was also slightly askew. Looking down the corridor, he suddenlynoticed that all the pictures were at odd angles. Frowning, he pulled out hisearphones…And heard Josh call Scatty’s name…And heard the clatter of metal…And realized that the air stank of vanilla and lavender…Saint-Germain raced down the stairs to the next floor. He found the Alchemystslumped, exhausted, in the door to his room, and slowed, but Nicholas waved himon. “Quickly,” he whispered. Saint-Germain darted past him and continued downthe corridor and on to the stairs….The hallway was in ruins.The remnants of the hall door hung off its hinges. All that remained of theantique crystal chandelier was a single buzzing lightbulb. Wallpaper hung inhuge curling strips, revealing the cracked plaster beneath. Banisters werechopped through, tiles scored and chipped.And there was a solid lump of ice sitting squarely in the center of the hall.Saint-Germain approached it cautiously and ran his fingers down the smoothsurface. It was so cold his flesh stuck to it. He could make out two white-cladfigures entwined within the block, faces frozen in ugly snarls; their startlingblue eyes followed him.Wood snapped in the kitchen and he turned and darted toward it, gloves of solidblue-white flame growing on his hands.And if Saint-Germain thought that the damage to the hallway was bad, nothingprepared him for the devastation in the kitchen.The entire side of the house was missing.Sophie and Joan stood in the midst of the ruin. His wife was holding the shakinggirl tightly, supporting her. Joan was wearing shiny blue-green satin pajamasand was still holding her sword in a metal gauntlet. She turned to look over hershoulder as her husband stepped into the room. “You missed the fun,” she said inFrench.“I heard nothing,” he apologized, in the same language. “Tell me.”“It was all over in minutes. Sophie and I heard a disturbance at the back of thehouse. We ran downstairs just as two women smashed their way in through the halldoor. They were Disir, they said they had come for Scathach. One attacked me,the other turned her attention to Sophie.” Even though she was speaking anobscure variant of the French language, she dropped her voice to a whisper.“Francis…this girl. She is extraordinary. She combined the magics: she used Fireand Air to defeat the Disir. Then she wrapped them in fog and froze it to a lumpof ice.”Saint-Germain shook his head. “It is physically impossible to use more than onemagic at a time…,” he said, but his voice trailed away to a whisper. Theevidence of Sophie’s powers sat in the center of the hallway. There was a legendthat the most powerful Elders were able to use all the elemental magicssimultaneously. According to the most ancient myths, this was the reason—one ofthe reasons—that Danu Talis sank.“Josh is gone.” Sophie suddenly shook herself free of Joan’s grip and spunaround to face the count. Then she looked over his shoulder to where anashen-faced Flamel stood leaning in the doorway. “Something’s taken Josh,” shesaid, desperately frightened now. “And Scatty’s gone after him.”The Alchemyst shuffled into the center of the room, wrapped his hands around hisbody as if he was freezing and looked around. Then he bent to scoop up theShadow’s matching short swords from where they lay amongst the rubble. When heturned to look back at the others, they were all startled to see that his eyeswere bright with tears. “I am sorry,” he said, “so terribly, terribly sorry. Ihave brought this terror and destruction to your home. It is unforgivable.”“We can rebuild,” Saint-Germain said airily. “This will give us the excuse weneeded to remodel.”“Nicholas,” Joan said very seriously, “what happened here?”The Alchemyst dragged up the only unbroken chair in the room and slumped intoit. He hunched forward, elbows on his knees, looking at the Shadow’s gleamingswords, turning them over and over in his hands. “Those are Disir in the blockof ice. Valkyries. Scathach’s sworn enemies, though she’s never told me why. Iknow they have pursued her down through the centuries and have always alliedthemselves with her enemies.”“They did this?” Saint-Germain looked around the ruined kitchen.“No. But they obviously brought something with them that did.”“What’s happened to Josh?” Sophie demanded. She shouldn’t have left him alone inthe kitchen, she should have waited with him. She would have defeated whateverhad attacked the back of the house.Nicholas held up Scathach’s weapon. “I think you should be asking what’shappened to the Warrior. In the centuries I’ve known her, she’s never let herswords out of her grasp. I fear she’s been taken….”“Swords…swords…” Sophie pulled away from Joan and began desperately searchingthrough the rubble. “When I went to bed, Josh had just come back from swordpractice with Scatty and Joan. He had the stone sword you gave him.” Shesummoned a wind to raise a chunk of heavy masonry and toss it aside, revealingthe floor beneath. Where was the sword? She felt a flicker of hope. If he’d beencaptured, then surely the sword would be on the floor? She straightened andlooked around the room. “Clarent isn’t here.”Saint-Germain walked to the hole where the back door had been. The garden was aruin. A chunk of stone had been ripped out of the fountain and the bowl crackedin half. It took him a moment to recognize the U-shaped hunk of metal that hadbeen his back gate. Only then did it sink in that the entire back wall wasmissing. The nine-foot-tall wall was now little more than a stump. There werepowdered and crushed bricks scattered all across the garden, almost as if thewall had been pushed down from outside.“Something big—very big—has been in the garden,” he said to no one inparticular.Flamel looked up. “Can you smell anything?” he asked.Saint-Germain breathed deeply. “Snake,” he said firmly. “But that’s notMachiavelli’s odor.” He stepped out into the garden and drew in a deep lungfulof cool air. “It’s stronger out here.” Then he coughed. “This stench is fouler,much fouler…,” he called. “This is the stink of something very, very old….”Drawn by the wailing car alarms, Saint-Germain crossed the garden, clamberedover the broken wall and looked up and down the alley. House and car alarms wereringing, mainly to his left, and there were lights on in the houses at that endof the street. In the mouth of the narrow alleyway, he could see the crushedremains of a black car.“Whatever it was attacked this house,” he said, darting back into the kitchen.“There’s a two-hundred-thousand-euro car at the end of the street that’s onlyfit for the scrap yard.”“Nidhogg,” Flamel whispered in horror. He nodded; it made sense now. “The Disirbrought Nidhogg,” he said. Then he frowned. “But even Machiavelli wouldn’t bringsomething like that into a major city. He’s too cautious.”“Nidhogg?” Joan and Sophie asked simultaneously, looking at one another.“Think of it as a cross between a dinosaur and a snake,” Flamel explained. “Butprobably older than this planet. I think it’s got Scathach and Josh went afterit.”Sophie shook her head firmly. “He wouldn’t do that—he couldn’t—he’s terrified ofsnakes.”“Then where is he?” Flamel asked. “Where is Clarent? It’s the only explanation:he’s taken the sword and gone in search of the Shadow.”“But I heard him calling to her for help….”“You heard him call her name. He might have been calling out to her.”Saint-Germain nodded. “It makes sense. The Disir only wanted Scathach. Nidhogggrabbed her and ran. Josh must have followed.”“Maybe it grabbed him and she followed,” Sophie suggested. “That’s the sort ofthing she’d do.”“It had no interest in Josh. It would have just eaten him. No, he went of hisown accord.”“That shows great courage,” Joan said.“But Josh isn’t brave…,” Sophie began. Yet even as she was saying it, she knewit wasn’t entirely true. He’d always stood up for her in school and protectedher. But why would he go after Scatty? She knew he didn’t even like her.“People change,” Joan said. “No one stays the same.”The noise was louder now, a mingled cacophony of police, ambulance and firesirens drawing closer. “Nicholas, Sophie, you’ve got to go,” Saint-Germain saidurgently. “I think we’re about to have police, lots and lots of police with fartoo many questions. And we have no answers. If they find you here—without papersor passports—I’m afraid they’ll hold you for questioning.” He tugged out aleather wallet attached to his belt on a long chain. “Here’s some cash.”“I cannot…,” the Alchemyst began.“Take it,” Saint-Germain insisted. “Don’t use your credit cards; Machiavelli cantrack your movements,” he continued. “I don’t know how long the police will behere. If I’m free, I’ll meet you tonight at six at the glass pyramid outside theLouvre. If I’m not there at six, I’ll try and get there at midnight, or failingthat, at six tomorrow morning.”“Thank you, old friend.” Nicholas turned to Sophie. “Grab your clothes, andJosh’s too, and whatever else you need; we’ll not be coming back here.”“I’ll help you,” Joan said, hurrying out of the room with Sophie.The Alchemyst and his former apprentice stood in the ruins of the kitchen,listening to the two women run upstairs.“What are you going to do with the block of ice in the hall?” Nicholas asked.“We’ve got a big chest freezer in the cellar. I’ll shove it in there until thepolice leave. What about the Disir, are they dead, do you think?”“The Disir are practically impossible to kill. Just make sure that ice doesn’tmelt anytime soon.”“I’ll drive it to the Seine one evening and drop it in the river. With luck itwon’t thaw till Rouen.”“What are you going to tell the police”—Nicholas waved a hand at thedevastation—“about all this?”“Gas explosion?” Saint-Germain suggested.“Lame,” Flamel said with a smile, remembering what the twins had said when he’dmade the same suggestion.“Lame?”“Very lame.”“Then I think I just came home and found it like this,” he said, “and it’s closeenough to the truth. I’ve no idea how it happened.” He suddenly grinnedmischievously. “I could sell the story and pictures to one of the tabloids.Mysterious Forces Destroy Rock Star’s House.”“Everyone would think it was a publicity stunt.”“Yes, they would, wouldn’t they? And you know what: I just happen to have a newalbum out. It’ll be great advertising.”The kitchen door opened and Sophie and Joan walked into the room. They had bothchanged into jeans and sweatshirts and were wearing matching backpacks.“I’m going with them,” Joan said before Saint-Germain could ask the questionthat had started to form on his lips. “They’ll need a guide and a bodyguard.”“Would it be worth my while arguing with you?” the count asked.“No.”“Didn’t think so.” He hugged his wife. “Please be careful, be very careful. IfMachiavelli or Dee is prepared to bring the Disir and Nidhogg into the city,then they are desperate. And desperate men do stupid things.”“Yes,” Flamel said simply. “Yes, they do. And stupid men make mistakes.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVEJosh kept looking over his shoulder, trying to orient himself. He was movingfarther and farther away from Saint-Germain’s house and was worried that he wasgoing to get lost. But he couldn’t turn back now; he couldn’t leave Scatty tothe creature. And so long as he could find the Arc de Triomphe at the end of theChamps-Elysées, he figured he’d be able to get back to the house. Alternatively,all he had to do was to follow the steady stream of police cars, fire trucks andambulances that were racing down the main street, heading in the direction hewas running from.He tried not to think too much about what he was doing because if he thoughtabout it—he was chasing a dinosaur-like monster through Paris—then he’d stop,and Scatty would…well, he wasn’t sure what would happen to Scatty. Whatever itwas, it wouldn’t be good.Following Nidhogg was simplicity itself. The creature ran in a straight line,crashing through the countless small streets and alleyways that ran parallel tothe Champs-Elysées. It left a trail of devastation in its wake, tramplingthrough a side street filled with parked cars, running right over the top ofthem, leaving them crumpled, flattened wrecks. As it darted down a narrowalleyway, its wavering tail punched through the steel shutters on the fronts ofshops on either side of the street, shattering the glass they protected. Burglarand car alarms added to the mayhem.Suddenly, a flash of white ahead of him caught his attention.Josh had briefly glimpsed the figure in white standing outside Saint-Germain’shouse. He guessed it was one of the monster’s keepers. And now it looked as ifthey were also chasing the creature…which meant they had lost control. Heglanced up, trying to gauge the time. Directly ahead of him, the sky was alreadypaling toward the dawn, which meant that he was running east. What was going tohappen when the city woke up to find a prehistoric monster rampaging through thestreets? There’d be panic; no doubt the police and army would be brought in.Josh had hacked at it with his sword and that had done nothing—he had a horriblefeeling that bullets would probably be just as useless.The streets narrowed to little more than alleyways, and the creature was forcedto slow down as he crashed off the walls. Josh discovered that he was catchingup with the figure in white. He thought it was a man, but it was hard to besure.He was running easily now, not even breathing hard; he guessed all the weeks andmonths of football practice were paying off. His sneakers made no sound on thestreets and he assumed that the figure in white didn’t even suspect they werebeing followed. After all, who would be crazy enough to run after a monster withnothing but a sword for protection? However, as he got closer, he could see thatthe figure was also carrying a sword in one hand and what looked like anoversized hammer in the other. He recognized the weapon from World of Warcraft:it was a war hammer, a ferocious and deadly variant of the mace. Drawing nearerstill, he discovered that the person was wearing white chain-mail armor, metalboots and a rounded helmet with a veil of chain mail covering the neck. Somehowhe wasn’t even surprised.Then, abruptly, the figure changed.Right before his eyes, the figure transformed from an armored warrior into ablond-haired young woman, not much older than himself, in a leather jacket,jeans and boots. Only the sword and war hammer in her hands marked her asextraordinary. She disappeared around a corner.Josh slowed: he didn’t want to run into the woman with the sword and hammer.And, thinking about it, he guessed she probably wasn’t a young woman at all.There was an explosion of brick and glass ahead of him and Josh picked up hispace and darted around the corner, then stopped. The creature was stuck in analley. Josh moved forward cautiously; it looked as if the monster had run downwhat looked like another arrow-straight street. But this particular streetcurved at the end and then narrowed, the upper stories of the two houses oneither side projecting out over the sidewalk below. The monster had slammed intothe opening, tearing a chunk out of both buildings. Attempting to push ahead, ithad suddenly found itself wedged in. It thrashed from side to side, brick andglass raining down into the street below. There was a flash of movement in anearby window, and Josh caught a glimpse of a man peering from one of thewindows, eyes and mouth round with horror, frozen in place by the monsterdirectly outside his window. A slab of concrete the size of a sofa fell on thecreature’s head, but it didn’t even seem to notice.Josh had no idea what to do. He needed to get to Scatty, but that meant gettingaround the creature, and there was simply no room. He watched as the blond womanraced down the alley. Without hesitation she leapt onto the monster’s back andclimbed nimbly toward its head, arms stretched out on either side, weaponspoised.She was going to kill it, Josh decided, relief washing over him. Maybe then hecould get in and grab Scatty.Sitting astride the creature’s broad neck, the woman reached down and lashed outat Scathach’s limp and unmoving body.Josh’s cry of horror was lost in the wail of sirens. “Sir, we have a report of an…incident.” The ashen-faced police officer handedthe phone to Niccolò Machiavelli. “The RAID officer asked to speak to youpersonally.”Dee caught the man by the arm and spun him around. “What is it?” he demanded inperfect French as Machiavelli listened intently to the call, one finger in hisear, trying to drown out the noise.“I’m not sure, sir. A mistake, certainly.” The police officer attempted a shakylaugh. “A few streets down, people are reporting that there is…a monster stuckin a house. Impossible, I know…” His voice trailed off as he turned to looktoward what had once been a substantial three-story house that now had a gapinghole plowed through the side.Machiavelli tossed the phone back to the police officer. “Get me a car.”“A car?”“A car and a map,” he snapped.“Yes, sir. You can take mine.” The police officer had been one of the first onthe scene following dozens of calls from alarmed citizens. He’d spottedMachiavelli and Dee hurrying from the alley close to the source of the noise andhad stopped them, convinced that they had something to do with what was beingreported as an explosion. His bluster had turned to dismay when he’d discoveredthat the mud-spattered older man with white hair in the torn suit was actuallythe head of the DGSE.The officer handed over his car key and a battered and torn Michelin map ofParis’s city center. “I’m afraid this is all I have.”Machiavelli snatched it from his hand. “You’re dismissed.” He gestured towardthe street. “Go and direct traffic; let no press or public near the house. Isthat clear?”“Yes, sir.” The police officer raced away, thankful that he still had his job;no one wanted to upset one of the most powerful men in France.Machiavelli spread the map across the hood of the car. “We’re here,” heexplained to Dee. “Nidhogg is heading directly east, but at some stage, it’s gotto cross the Champs-Elysées and make for the river. If it continues on itspresent course, I’ve a reasonably good idea it will come out”—his finger stabbedthe map—“close to here.”The two men climbed into the small car and Machiavelli looked around for amoment, trying to make sense of the controls. He couldn’t remember the last timehe’d driven a car; Dagon had always looked after that. Finally, with a grindingcrunch of gears, he got the car moving and made an illegal turn that sent themfishtailing across the road, then roared down the Champs-Elysées, leaving rubberin their wake.Dee sat silently in the passenger seat, one hand wrapped around the seat belt,the other braced against the dashboard. “Who taught you to drive?” he askedshakily as they bounced off the curb.“Karl Benz,” Machiavelli snapped. “A long time ago,” he added.“And how many wheels did that car have?”“Three.”Dee squeezed his eyes shut as they roared across an intersection, barely missinga lumbering road-sweeper truck. “So what do we do when we get to Nidhogg?” heasked, focusing on the problem, trying to keep his mind off Machiavelli’sterrible driving.“That’s your problem,” Machiavelli retorted. “After all, you’re the one whofreed it.”“But you invited the Disir here. So it’s partially your fault.”Machiavelli hit the brakes hard, sending the car into a long screeching slide.The engine cut out and the car jerked to a halt.“Why have we stopped?” Dee demanded.Machiavelli pointed out the window. “Listen.”“I can’t hear anything over the noise of the sirens.”“Listen,” Machiavelli insisted. “Something’s coming.” He pointed to the left.“Over there.”Dee rolled down his window. Over the police, ambulance and fire sirens, theycould hear stones grinding, bricks falling and the sharp snap-crackle ofbreaking glass…. Josh watched, powerless, as the woman sitting atop the monster lashed at Scattywith her sword.At that moment the monster shrugged, still trying to free itself from thebuilding that encased it, and the blade missed, whistling dangerously close tothe unconscious Warrior’s head. Edging higher on the monster’s broad neck, thewoman gripped a clump of thick skin, leaned sideways across a huge unblinkingeye and jabbed the point of her sword at Scatty. Again the creature moved andthe sword bit into its arm, close to the claw wrapped around the Warrior. Themonster didn’t react, but Josh saw how close the blade had come to Scatty. Thewoman leaned down again, and this time, Josh knew, she’d hit the Warrior.He had to do something! He was Scatty’s only hope. He couldn’t just stand hereand watch someone he knew get killed. He started running. Back at the house,when he’d slashed at the creature, nothing had happened, but when he’d plungedthe sword point first into its thick hide…Holding Clarent in the two-handed grip Joan had taught him, Josh put on a finalburst of speed and raced up to the creature. He could feel the sword humming inhis hands just before he stabbed it into the monster’s tail.Instantly, heat flowed up through his arms and blossomed in his chest. The airfilled with the tart smell of oranges in the heartbeat before his aura flaredbriefly golden and then faded to the same reddish-orange glow that was streamingoff the sword protruding from the creature’s thick knobbled skin.Josh twisted Clarent and pulled it free. In the grayish brown hide, the woundburned bright red and immediately started to hardened into a black crust. Ittook a moment for the sensation to travel through the creature’s primitivenervous system. Then the monster abruptly reared up on its hind legs, hissingand squealing in agony. It wrenched itself free of the house, the sudden rain ofbricks, roof tiles and wooden beams sending Josh scrambling back, out of harm’sway. He hit the ground, covering his head as debris crashed about him. Hethought it would be just his luck to be killed by a roof tile. The unexpectedmovement almost dislodged the woman on the monster’s back. Swaying, she droppedthe war hammer and desperately grabbed at the creature’s back to prevent herselffrom being thrown down directly in front of it. Lying on the ground, bricksraining around him, Josh watched as the thick black crust began to spread outfrom the wound and creep up the monster’s tail. It reared again and then plowedright through the corner of the house and out across the Champs-Elysées. Joshwas relieved to see that Scatty’s limp form was still gripped in his frontclaws.Taking a deep breath, Josh scrambled to his feet and snatched up the sword.Instantly, he felt power buzz through his body, heightening every sense. Hestood swaying as raw power energized him; then he turned and raced after themonster. He felt amazing. Even though it was still not quite dawn, he could seeclearly, though the colors were slightly off. He could smell the myriad scentsof the city through the rancid serpent-stink of the creature. His hearing was soacute he could differentiate the sirens of the many different emergencyservices; he could even distinguish individual cars. He could actually feel theirregular indentations in the pavement beneath his feet through the rubber solesof his sneakers. He waved the sword in the air before him. It keened and hummed,and instantly, Josh imagined he could hear distant whispers and make out wordshe could almost understand. For the first time in his life, he felt truly alive:and he knew then that this was how Sophie had felt when she’d been Awakened. Butwhereas she’d been frightened, confused by the sensations…he felt exhilarated.He wanted this. More than anything else in the world.image [images/Scot_9780375849084_epub_002_r1.jpg]Dagon padded into the alleyway, scooped up the Disir’s fallen war hammer andraced after the boy.Dagon had seen the flare of the boy’s aura and knew that it was indeed powerful,though whether the boy and girl were the twins of legend was a different matter.Obviously, the Alchemyst, and Dee, too, seemed convinced that they were. ButDagon knew that even Machiavelli—one of the most brilliant humani he’d everassociated with—was unsure, and the brief glimpse he’d caught of the boy’s aurawasn’t enough to convince him either way. Gold and silver auras were rare—thoughnot as rare as the black aura—and Dagon had encountered at least four sets oftwins down through the ages with the sun and moon auras, as well as dozens ofindividuals.But what neither Dee nor Machiavelli knew was that Dagon had seen the originaltwins.He’d been on Danu Talis at the very end, for the Final Battle. He’d worn hisfather’s armor on that auspicious day, when all knew that the fate of the islandhung in the balance. Like everyone else, he’d cowered in terror as silver andgold lights blazed from the top of the Pyramid of the Sun in a display of primalpower. The elemental magics had lain waste to the ancient landscape and sunderedthe island at the heart of the world.Dagon rarely slept anymore; he didn’t even possess a bed. Like a shark, he couldsleep and continue to move about. He rarely dreamed, but when he did, the dreamswere always the same: a vivid nightmare of those times when the skies had burnedwith gold and silver lights and the world had ended.He’d spent many years in Machiavelli’s service. He’d seen both wonders andterrors during those centuries, and together, they’d been present for some ofthe most significant and interesting moments in the earth’s recent history.And Dagon was beginning to think that this night might be one of the mostmemorable. “Now, that’s something you don’t see every day,” Dee muttered.The Magician and Machiavelli watched Nidhogg burst through a building on theleft side of the Champs-Elysées, trample the trees that lined the street andcareer across the road. It still held red-haired Scatty in its claws, and theDisir was clinging to its back. The two immortals watched the huge swinging tailturn a set of traffic lights into a mangled ruin as the creature darted downanother street.“It’s heading for the river,” Machiavelli said.“But what happened to the boy, I wonder?” Dee mused aloud.“Maybe he got lost,” Machiavelli began, “or was trampled by Nidhogg. Or maybenot,” he added as Josh Newman stepped through the uprooted trees and out intothe broad road. He looked left and right, but there was no traffic, and hedidn’t even glance at the police car badly parked against the curb. He dartedacross the wide avenue, the sword in his hand streaming smoky gold threadsbehind him.“The boy’s a survivor,” Dee said admiringly. “Brave, too.”Seconds later, Dagon burst out of the side street, following Josh. He wascarrying a war hammer. Spotting Dee and Machiavelli in the car, he raised hisother hand in what might have been a greeting, or a farewell.“Now what?” Dee demanded.Machiavelli turned the key in the ignition and wrenched the car into first gear.It jerked forward, bouncing a little; then the engine howled as he put his footto the floor. “The Rue de Marignan comes out onto the Avenue Montaigne. I thinkI can get there before Nidhogg does.” He hit the sirens.Dee nodded. “Perhaps you might think about changing gear.” His lips moved in abarely discernable smile. “You’ll find the car will go faster that way.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX“Your garage isn’t attached to your house?” Sophie asked, climbing into the backof a small red and black Citroën 2CV, taking up a position behind Nicholas, whowas sitting up front with Joan.“These are converted stables. In previous centuries, the stables were never tooclose to the house. I guess the rich didn’t like living with the smell of horsemanure. It’s not so bad, though it can be a bit of an inconvenience on a rainynight, knowing you have to run three blocks home. If Francis and I go out for anevening, we usually take the Metro.”Joan eased the car out of the garage and turned right, moving away from thedamaged house, which was quickly being surrounded by fire trucks, ambulances,police cars and press. When they’d left, Francis had been going upstairs tochange; he reasoned that all the publicity would do wonders for the sale of hisnew album.“We’ll cut across the Champs-Elysées and then head down toward the river,” Joansaid, expertly maneuvering the Citroën through the narrow cobbled alleyway. “Areyou sure that’s where Nidhogg will go?”Nicholas Flamel sighed. “I’m only guessing,” he admitted. “I’ve never actuallyseen it—I don’t know of anyone who has and lived—but I’ve come across creatureslike it in my travels, and they are all related to the marine lizards, like themosasaur. It’s scared, maybe it’s hurt. It’ll head to the water, seeking cool,healing mud.”Sophie leaned forward between the front seats. She deliberately focused onNidhogg, desperately sorting through the Witch’s memories, looking for somethingthat might help her. But even the Witch knew little about the primal creatureexcept that it was locked in the roots of the World Tree, the tree that Dee haddestroyed with…“Excalibur,” she whispered.The Alchemyst swiveled in the seat to look at her. “What about it?”Sophie frowned, trying to remember. “Josh told me earlier that Dee had destroyedYggdrasill with Excalibur.”Flamel nodded.“And you told me that Clarent is Excalibur’s twin.”“It is.”“Does it share the same powers?” she asked.Flamel’s cool gray eyes flashed. “And you’re wondering, if Excalibur coulddestroy something as ancient as the World Tree, could Clarent destroy Nidhogg?”He was nodding even as he was speaking. “The ancient weapons of power predatethe Elders. No one has any idea where they came from, though we do know that theElders used some of them. The fact that the weapons are still around todayproves just how indestructible they are.” He nodded. “I’m sure Clarent couldhurt and possibly even kill Nidhogg.”“And you believe Nidhogg is hurt now?” Joan spotted an opening in the lightearly-morning traffic and slotted neatly into it. Car horns blared behind her.“Something drove it from the house.”“Then you know what you’ve just confirmed?” she said.Flamel nodded. “We know Scatty would never touch Clarent. Therefore, Joshwounded the creature—enough to send it careering madly across Paris. And nowhe’s chasing it.”“And Machiavelli and Dee?” Joan asked.“Probably chasing him.”Joan cut across two lanes of traffic and roared down the Champs-Elysées. “Let’shope they don’t catch up with him.”A sudden thought struck Sophie. “Dee met Josh….” She stopped, realizing whatshe’d just said.“In Ojai. I know,” Flamel said, surprising her. “He told me.”Sophie sat back, surprised that her twin had told the Alchemyst. Color touchedher cheeks. “I think Dee made an impression on him.” She felt almost embarrassedsaying this to the Alchemyst, as if she was betraying her brother, but shepressed on. This was no time for secrets. “Dee told him some things about you. Ithink…I think Josh sort of believed him,” she finished in a rush.“I know,” Flamel said softly. “The English Magician can be very persuasive.”Joan slowed the car to a stop. “This isn’t good,” she muttered. “There should bevirtually no one on the road at this hour.”They had driven right into a huge traffic jam. It stretched down theChamps-Elysées directly ahead of them. For the second day in a row, traffic onParis’s main thoroughfare had come to a complete halt. People were standingbeside their cars looking at the gaping hole in the side of the building acrossthe street. Police had just arrived and were quickly trying to take control,urging traffic to move on and allow the emergency services to get through to thebuilding.Joan of Arc leaned across the steering wheel, cool gray eyes assessing thesituation. “It crossed the street and went this way,” Joan said, signalingquickly and turning right, into the narrow Rue de Marignan, driving past a pairof mangled traffic lights. “I don’t see them.”Nicholas rose in the seat, trying to see as far as possible down the longstraight street. “Where does this come out?”“On the Rue François, just before the Avenue Montaigne,” Joan answered. “I’vewalked, cycled and driven through these streets for decades. I know them likethe back of my hand.” They drove past a dozen cars, each one bearing the marksof Nidhogg: metalwork crumpled like tinfoil, windows spiderwebbed and smashed. Aball of metal that had once been a bicycle was now pressed deeply into thepavement, still attached to a railing by a length of chain.“Joan,” Nicholas said very softly, “I think you should hurry up.”“I don’t like driving fast.” She glanced sidelong at the Alchemyst, and whateverexpression she saw on his face made her push her foot to the floor. The smallengine howled and the car lurched forward. “What is it?” she demanded.Nicholas chewed his bottom lip. “I’ve just thought of a potential problem,” headmitted finally.“What sort of problem?” Joan and Sophie asked simultaneously.“A serious problem.”“Bigger than Nidhogg?” Joan jerked the stick shift and slammed the car into topgear. Sophie couldn’t see that it made any difference; she still felt she couldbe walking faster. She pounded the back of the seat, frantic with worry. Theyneeded to get to her brother.“I gave Josh the two missing pages from the Codex,” Flamel said. He twistedaround in the seat to look at Sophie. “Do you think your brother has them withhim?”“Probably,” she said immediately, and then nodded. “Yes, I’m sure he does. Thelast time we talked he was wearing the bag under his shirt.”“So how did Josh end up guarding the pages of the Codex?” Joan asked. “I thoughtyou never let the book out of your sight.”“I gave them to him.”“You gave them?” she asked, surprised. “Why?”Nicholas turned away and looked out at the street, now littered with theevidence of Nidhogg’s passing. When he looked back at Joan, his face was set ina grim mask. “I figured that since he was the only person amongst us who wasneither immortal, Elder nor Awakened, he would not be involved in any of theconflicts we’d face, nor would he be a target: he’s just a humani. I thought thepages would be safe with him.”Something about the statement bothered Sophie, but she couldn’t put her fingeron it. “Josh wouldn’t give the pages to Dee,” she announced confidently.Nicholas twisted around to face the girl again, and the look in his pale eyeswas terrifying. “Oh, believe me: Dee always gets what he wants,” he saidbitterly, “and what he cannot have—he destroys.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVENMachiavelli slid the car to a stop, half on, half off the curb. He pulled up thebrake but left the car in gear, and it jerked forward and cut out. They were ina parking lot on the banks of the river Seine, close to where he’d anticipatedNidhogg would appear. For a moment, the only sound was the engine tickingsoftly, and then Dee let out his breath in a long sigh. “You are the worstdriver I’ve ever come across.”“I got us here, didn’t I? You do know that explaining all this is going to bevery difficult,” Machiavelli added, moving off the subject of his terribledriving. He had mastered the most arcane and difficult arts, had manipulatedsociety and politics for half a millennium, was fluent in a dozen languages,could program in five different computer languages and was one of the world’sexperts on quantum physics. And he still couldn’t drive a car. It wasembarrassing. Rolling down the driver’s window, he allowed cold air to wash intothe vehicle. “I can impose a press blackout, of course, claiming it’s a nationalsecurity issue, but this is getting too public and way too messy.” He sighed.“Video of Nidhogg is probably on the Internet right now.”“People will dismiss it as a prank,” Dee said confidently. “I thought we were introuble when Bigfoot was caught on camera. But that was quickly rejected as ahoax. If I’ve learned anything over the years, it is that the humani are mastersat ignoring what is right in front of their noses. They’ve disregarded ourexistence for centuries, dismissing the Elders and their times as little morethan myth and legend, despite all the evidence. Besides,” he added smugly,absently stroking his short beard, “everything is coming together. We have mostof the book; once we get the two missing pages, we will bring back the DarkElders and return this world to its proper state.” He waved a hand airily.“You’ll not have to worry about minor issues like the press.”“You seem to be forgetting that we have some other problems, like the Alchemystand Perenelle. They are not so minor.”Dee pulled his cell phone out of his pocket and waved it in the air. “Oh, I’vetaken care of that. I made a call.”Machiavelli glanced sidelong at the Magician but said nothing. In hisexperience, people often spoke merely to fill a silence in a conversation, andhe knew that Dee was a man who liked to hear the sound of his own voice.John Dee stared through the dirty windshield toward the Seine. A couple of milesdownriver, just around the bend, the huge Gothic cathedral of Notre Dame deParis would be slowly taking shape in the early dawn light. “I first metNicholas and Perenelle in this city almost five hundred years ago. I was theirstudent—you didn’t know that, did you? That’s not in your legendary files. Oh,don’t look so surprised,” he said, laughing at Machiavelli’s stunned expression.“I’ve known about your files for decades. And my copies are even moreup-to-date,” he added. “But yes, I studied with the legendary Alchemyst, here inthis very city. I knew within a very short time that Perenelle was morepowerful—more dangerous—than her husband. Have you ever met her?” he askedsuddenly.“Yes,” Machiavelli said shakily. He was astounded that the Elders—or was it justDee?—knew about his secret files. “Yes. I met her just the once. We fought; shewon,” he said shortly. “She made quite an impression.”“She is an extraordinary woman; quite remarkable. Even in her own time, herreputation was formidable. What she would have achieved if only she’d chosen toside with us. I don’t know what she sees in the Alchemyst.”“You never did understand the human capacity for love, did you?” Machiavelliasked softly.“I understand that Nicholas survives and thrives because of the Sorceress. Todestroy Nicholas, all we have to do is kill Perenelle. My master and I havealways known that, but we thought that if we could capture both of them, theiraccumulated knowledge was worth the risk of leaving them alive.”“And now?”“It is no longer worth the risk. Tonight,” he added, very softly, “I finally didsomething that I should have done a long time ago.” He sounded almost regretful.“John,” Machiavelli barked urgently, swiveling in the seat to look at theEnglish Magician. “What have you done?”“I’ve sent the Morrigan to Alcatraz. Perenelle will not see another dawn.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHTJosh finally caught up with the monster on the banks of the Seine.He didn’t know how far he’d run, miles probably—but he knew that he shouldn’thave been able to do it. He’d sprinted the entire length of the last street—he’dthought the street sign said Rue de Marignan—without any effort, and now,swinging left onto the Avenue Montaigne, he wasn’t even breathless.It was the sword.He’d felt it buzz and hum in his hands as he’d run, heard it whisper and sighwhat sounded like vague promises. When he held it directly in front of him,toward the monster, the whispers grew louder and it visibly trembled in hishand. When he moved it away, they faded.The sword was drawing him toward the creature.Following the monster’s trail of destruction down the narrow street, racing pastconfused, shocked and horrified Parisians, Josh found strange and disturbingthoughts flickering at the very edges of his consciousness:…he was in a world without land, swimming in an ocean vast enough to swallowwhole planets, filled with creatures that made the monster he was chasing looktiny….…he was dangling high in the air, wrapped in thick roots that bit into hisflesh, looking down over a blasted, fiery wasteland….…he was lost and confused, in a place filled with small buildings and eventinier creatures, and he was in pain, an incredible fire searing the base of hisspine….…he was…Nidhogg.The name snapped into his consciousness, and the shock that he was somehowexperiencing the monster’s thoughts almost stopped him in his tracks. He knewthe phenomenon had to be connected to the sword. Earlier, when the creature’stongue had touched the blade, he’d glimpsed a snapshot of an alien world,shocking images of a bizarre landscape, and now, having stabbed the creatureagain, he caught hints of a life completely beyond his experience.It dawned on him that he was seeing what the creature—Nidhogg—had seen at sometime in the past. He was experiencing what it was feeling now.It had to be connected to the sword.And if this was Excalibur’s twin, Josh suddenly wondered, then did that ancientweapon also transfer feelings, emotions, and impressions when it was used? Whathad Dee felt when he had plunged Excalibur into the ancient Yggdrasill? Whatsights had he seen, what had he experienced and learned? Josh found himselfwondering if that was the real reason Dee had destroyed the Yggdrasill: had hekilled it to experience the incredible knowledge it contained?Josh glanced quickly at the stone sword and a shudder ran through him. A weaponlike this gave the wielder unimaginable powers—and what a frightening temptationit was. Surely the urge to use it again and again to gain more and moreknowledge would become uncontrollable? It was a terrifying thought.But why had the Alchemyst given it to him?The answer came immediately: because Flamel didn’t know! The sword was a deadlump of stone until it stabbed or cut something—only then did it come alive.Josh nodded to himself; now he knew why Saint-Germain, Joan and Scatty would nottouch the weapon.As he raced down the street toward the river, he wondered what would happen ifhe managed to kill Nidhogg with Clarent. What would he feel, what would heexperience?What would he know? Nidhogg burst through a stand of trees and darted across the road and down ontothe Port des Champs-Elysées. It stopped in the parking lot on the quaysidealmost directly in front of Dee and Machiavelli and dropped onto all fours, hugehead swaying from side to side, tongue lolling out of its mouth. It was so closethey could see Scatty’s limp body caught in its claws and the Disir astride itsneck. Nidhogg’s tail lashed, buffeting parked cars and smashing into a long tourbus, staving in the engine. A tire popped with a deep boom.“I think we should get out of the car…,” Dee began, reaching for the door, eyesfixed on the swinging tail as it flipped a heavy BMW onto its roof.Machiavelli’s arm shot out, fingers closing on the Magician’s arm in a painfulviselike grip. “Do not even think about moving. Do nothing that will attract itsattention.”“But the tail…”“It’s in pain, that’s why the tail is thrashing about. But it seems to beslowing down.”Dee turned his head slightly. Machiavelli was correct: there was something wrongwith Nidhogg’s tail. About one-third of its total length had turned black—itlooked almost stonelike. Even as Dee watched, tendrils and veins of bubblingblack liquid crept over the creature’s hard flesh, slowly encasing it in a solidcrust. Dr. John Dee immediately knew what had happened.“The boy stabbed it with Clarent,” he said, not even turning his head to look atMachiavelli. “That’s what caused the reaction.”“I thought you said Clarent was the Sword of Fire, not the Sword of Stone.”“There are many different forms of fire,” Dee said. “Who knows how the blade’senergy reacted with something like Nidhogg?” He stared at the tail, watching asmore of the thick black crust grew on the skin. As it hardened, he caught abrief glimpse of red fire. “Lava crust,” he said, voice hushed in wonder. “It’slava crust. The fire is burning within the creature’s skin.”“No wonder it’s in pain,” Machiavelli muttered.“You sound almost sorry for it,” Dee snapped.“I never traded my humanity for my long life, Doctor. I’ve always remembered myroots.” His voice hardened, turned contemptuous. “You worked so hard to be likeyour Elder master that you’ve forgotten what it is like to feel human—to behuman. And we humans”—he stressed the last word—“have the capacity to feelanother creature’s pain. It is what lifted humani above the Elders, it is whatmade them great.”“And it’s the weakness that will ultimately destroy them,” Dee said simply. “Letme remind you that this creature is not human. It could crush you underfoot andnot even notice. However, let us not argue now; not when we’re about to bevictorious. The boy might have solved our problem for us,” Dee said. “Nidhogg isslowly turning to stone.” He laughed delightedly. “If it jumps into the rivernow, the weight of its tail will drag it to the bottom—and take Scathach withit.” He looked slyly at Machiavelli. “I take it your humanity does not extend tofeeling sorry for the Shadow.”Machiavelli grimaced. “Knowing Scathach is lying at the bottom of the Seinewrapped in the creature’s claws would make me very happy indeed.”The two immortals sat unmoving in the car, watching as the creature lurchedforward, moving more slowly now, the weight of its tail dragging behind it. Allthat stood between it and the water was one of the glass-enclosed boats—thebateaux-mouches—that took tourists up and down the river.Dee nodded toward the boat. “Once it climbs onto that, the boat will sink, andNidhogg and Scathach will disappear into the Seine forever.”“And what about the Disir?”“I’m sure she can swim.”Machiavelli allowed himself a wry smile. “So all we’re waiting for now…”“…is for it to reach the boat,” Dee finished, just as Josh appeared through thegaping hole in the tree-lined quayside and darted across the parking lot. As Josh raced up to the creature, the sword in his right hand began to burn,long streamers of orange fire curling off the blade. His aura started to cracklea matching golden color, suffusing the air with the smell of oranges.Abruptly, the Disir slid off the monster’s back, flickering back into her whitechain mail in the instant before her feet touched the ground. She rounded onJosh, her features locked into an ugly, savage mask. “You are becoming anuisance, boy,” she snarled in barely comprehensible English. Lifting her greatbroadsword in both hands, she threw herself toward Josh. “This will just take amoment.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTY-NINEHuge sweeping banks of fog rolled across San Francisco Bay.Perenelle Flamel folded her arms across her chest and watched the night sky fillwith birds. A great wheeling flock rose over the city, gathered in a thickmoving cloud, and then, like tendrils of spilled ink, three separate streams ofbirds set out across the bay, heading directly for the island. And she knew thatsomewhere in the heart of the great flock was the Crow Goddess. The Morrigan wascoming to Alcatraz.Perenelle was standing in the burned-out ruins of the warden’s house, whereshe’d finally managed to escape the masses of spiders. Although it had burnedmore than three decades ago, she could smell the ghost-odors of charred wood,cracked plaster and melted piping lingering in the air. The Sorceress knew thatif she lowered her defenses and concentrated, she would be able to hear thevoices of the wardens and their families who had occupied the building throughthe years.Shading her bright green eyes and squinting hard, Perenelle concentrated on theapproaching birds, trying to distinguish them from the night and work out justhow much time she had before they arrived. The flock was huge, and thethickening fog made it impossible to guess either size or distance. But sheguessed she had perhaps ten or fifteen minutes before they reached the island.She brought her little finger and thumb close together. A single white sparkcracked between them. Perenelle nodded. Her powers were returning, just not fastenough. They would continue to strengthen now that she was away from the sphinx,but her aura would recharge more slowly at night. She also knew that she wasstill nowhere near strong enough to defeat the Morrigan and her pets.But that didn’t mean she was defenseless; a lifetime of study had taught hermany useful things.The Sorceress felt a chill breeze ruffle her long hair in the instant before theghost of Juan Manuel de Ayala flickered into existence beside her. The ghosthung in the air, taking substance and definition from a host of dust particlesand water droplets in the gathering fog. Like many of the ghosts she’dencountered, he was wearing the clothes he had felt most comfortable in while hewas alive: a loose white linen shirt tucked into knee-length trousers. His legstapered away below his knees, and, like a lot of spirits, he had no feet. Whilethey were alive, people rarely looked down at their feet. “This was once themost beautiful spot on this earth, was it not?” he asked, flat moist eyes fixedon the city of San Francisco.“It still is,” she said, turning to look across the bay to where the citysparkled and glittered with countless tiny lights. “Nicholas and I have calledit home for many years.”“Oh, not the city!” de Ayala said dismissively.Perenelle glanced sidelong at the ghost. “What are you talking about?” sheasked. “It looks beautiful.”“I once stood here, close to this very spot, and watched perhaps a thousandfires burning on the shores. Each fire represented a family. In time I came toknow all of them.” The Spaniard’s long face grimaced in what might have beenpain. “They taught me about the land, and about this place, spoke to me of theirgods and spirits. I think it was those people who bound me to this land. All Isee now are lights; I cannot see the stars, I cannot see the tribes orindividuals huddling around their fires. Where is the place I loved?”Perenelle nodded toward the distant lights. “It’s still there. Just grown.”“It’s changed out of all recognition,” de Ayala said, “and not for the better.”“I’ve watched the world change too, Juan.” Perenelle spoke very softly. “But Ilike to believe that it has changed for the better. I am older than you. I wasborn into an age when a toothache could kill you, when life was short and brutaland death was often painful. Around the same time you were discovering thisisland, the average life expectancy of a healthy adult was no more thanthirty-five years. Now it is double that. Toothaches no longer kill—well, notusually,” she added with a laugh. Getting Nicholas to go to the dentist waspractically impossible. “Humans have made astonishing strides in the last fewhundred years; they have created wonders.”De Ayala floated around to hover directly in front of her. “And in their rush tocreate wonders, they have ignored the wonders all around them, ignored themysteries, the beauty. Myths and legends walk unseen amongst them, ignored,unrecognized. It was not always so.”“No, it wasn’t,” Perenelle agreed sadly. She looked across the bay. The city wasfast disappearing into the mist, the lights taking on a magical, etherealquality. It was easy now to see what it must have looked like in the past…andwhat it might look like again if the Dark Elders reclaimed the earth. In pastages, mankind had recognized that there really were creatures and otherraces—the Vampire, the Were, the Giants—living in the shadows. Sometimes beingsas powerful as gods lived in the heart of the mountains or deep in theimpenetrable forests. There were ghouls in the earth, wolves really did roam theforest, and there were creatures much worse than trolls under bridges. Whentravelers had returned from distant lands, bringing with them stories of themonsters and creatures they had met, the wonders they had seen, no one doubtedthem. Nowadays, even with photographs, videos or eyewitness accounts ofsomething extraordinary or otherworldly, people still doubted—dismissingeverything as a hoax.“And now one of those terrible wonders is coming to my island,” Juan said sadly.“I can feel it approach. Who is it?”“The Morrigan, the Crow Goddess.”Juan turned to Perenelle. “I’ve heard of her; some of the Irish and Scottishsailors in my crews feared her. She’s coming for you, isn’t she?”“Yes.” The Sorceress smiled grimly.“What will she do?”Perenelle tilted her head to one side, considering. “Well, they’ve triedimprisoning me. That’s failed. I imagine Dee’s masters have finally sanctioned amore permanent solution.” She laughed shakily. “I’ve been in trickiersituations….” Her voice cracked and she swallowed hard and tried again. “ButI’ve always had Nicholas by my side. Together we were undefeatable. I wish hewere here with me now.” She took a deep breath, steadying her breathing andraising both hands in front of her face. Smoking wisps of her ice white auracurled off her fingertips. “But I am the immortal Perenelle Flamel, and I willnot go down without a fight.”“Tell me how I can help you,” de Ayala said formally.“You have done enough for me already. Because of you I escaped the Sphinx.”“This is my island. And you are under my protection now.” He smiled ruefully.“However, I’m not sure the birds will be frightened by a few banging doors. Andthere’s not a lot else I can do.”Perenelle carefully picked her way from one side of the ruined house to theother. Standing in one of the tall rectangular windows, she stared back at theprison. Now that night had fallen, it was little more than a vague and ominousoutline against the purple sky. She took stock of her situation: she was trappedon an island crawling with spiders, there was a sphinx wandering loose in thecorridors below, and the cells were filled with creatures from some of thedarkest myths she had ever encountered. Plus, her powers were incrediblydiminished and the Morrigan was coming. She’d told de Ayala that she’d been intrickier situations, but right now she couldn’t remember one.The ghost appeared alongside Perenelle, its outline distorting the shape of thebuilding beyond. “What can I do to help?”“How well do you know this island?” she asked.“Ha! I know every inch. I know the secret places, the half-completed tunnels dugby the prisoners, hidden corridors, walled-up rooms, the old Indian caves cutdeep into the rock below. I could hide you and no one would ever find you.”“The Morrigan is resourceful…and then there are the spiders. They’d find me.”The ghost floated around to place himself directly in front of her again. Onlyhis eyes—a deep rich brown—were visible in the night. “Oh, the spiders are notunder Dee’s control.”Perenelle took a step back in surprise. “They’re not?”“They only began to appear a couple of weeks ago. I started to notice the websover the doors, coating the stairs. Every morning, there were more and morespiders. They’d float in on the wind, carried by strands of thread. There werehumanlike guards on the island then…though they were not human,” he addedquickly. “Terrible blank-faced creatures.”“Homunculi,” Perenelle said with a shudder. “Creatures Dee grows in bubblingvats of fat. What happened to them?”“They were given the task of sweeping clean the spiders’ webs, keeping the doorsclear. One stumbled and fell into a web,” de Ayala said, his teeth appearing outof the gloom in a quick smile. “All that was left of it were scraps of cloth.Not even bones,” he told her in a horrified whisper.“That’s because homunculi have no bones,” she said absently. “So what is callingthe spiders here?”De Ayala turned to look at the prison. “I’m not sure….”“I thought you knew all there was to know about this island?” Perenelle saidwith a smile.“Far below the prison, cut deep into the bedrock by the waves, is a series ofsubterranean caves. I believe the first native inhabitants of the island usedthem for storage. About a month ago, the small Englishman—”“Dee?”“Yes, Dee, brought something to the island in the dead of night. It was sealedaway in those caves, and then he blanketed the entire area with magical sigilsand Wards. Even I cannot penetrate the layers of protection. But I am convincedthat whatever is drawing the spiders to the island is locked in those caves.”“Can you get me to the caves?” Perenelle asked urgently. She could hear the raspand clatter of thousands of birds’ wings, drawing ever closer.“No,” de Ayala snapped. “The corridor is thick with spiders, and who knows whatother traps Dee has put into place.”Perenelle automatically reached for the sailor’s arm, but her hand passed rightthrough him, leaving a swirl of water droplets in her wake. “If Dee has buriedsomething in Alcatraz’s hidden dungeons, and then protected it with magic sopotent that even an insubstantial spirit cannot get through it, then we need toknow what it is.” She smiled. “Have you never heard the saying ‘the enemy of myenemy is my friend’?”“No, but I have heard ‘fools rush in where angels fear to tread.’”“Come, then—quickly, before the Morrigan arrives. Take me back into Alcatraz.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FORTYThe Disir’s sword flashed toward Josh’s head.Everything was happening so fast, he didn’t have time to be afraid. Josh saw theflicker of movement and reacted instinctively, bringing Clarent up and around,holding it horizontally over his head. The Disir’s broadsword struck the shortstone blade and screamed along it in an explosion of sparks. They rained downover Josh’s hair, stinging where they touched his face. The pain made him angry,but the force of the blow drove him to his knees, and then the Disir steppedback and brought her weapon around in a wide sweeping cut. It whined as itsliced through the air toward him…and Josh knew with a sickening feeling in thepit of his stomach that he would not be able to avoid it.Clarent trembled in Josh’s palm.Twitched.And moved.A surge of tingling heat shot into his hand, shocking him, the spasm tighteninghis fingers around the hilt. Then the sword jerked, shooting out to meet theDisir’s metal blade, turning it aside at the last moment in another explosion ofsparks.Blue eyes wide with shock, the Disir danced away. “No humani possesses suchskill,” she wondered aloud, her voice barely above a whisper. “Who are you?”Josh got shakily to his feet, not entirely sure what had just happened, knowingonly that it was something to do with the sword. It had taken control; it hadsaved him. His eyes went to the terrifying warrior maid, flickering between hermasked face and her gleaming silver sword. He held Clarent before him in bothhands, trying to mimic the stance he’d seen Joan and Scatty use, but the swordkept shifting in his grip, moving and shivering of its own accord. “I am JoshNewman,” he said simply.“Never heard of you,” the woman said dismissively. She snapped a quick look overher shoulder to where Nidhogg was crawling toward the water. Its tail was now soheavily encrusted with black stone that it could barely move.“Maybe you’ve never heard of me,” Josh said, “but this”—he tilted the swordblade upward—“is Clarent.” He watched the woman’s bright blue eyes widenslightly. “And I see you have heard of it!”Spinning her sword loosely in one hand, the Disir began to edge around Josh. Hekept turning to face her. He knew what she was doing—moving him so that his backwould be to the monster—but he didn’t know how to prevent it from happening.When his back was almost touching Nidhogg’s stone skin, the Disir stopped.“In the hands of a master, the sword might be dangerous,” the Disir said.“I’m no master,” Josh said loudly, delighted that his voice didn’t tremble. “ButI don’t need to be. Scathach told me that this weapon really could kill her. Ididn’t understand what she meant, but now I do. And if it could kill her, thenI’m guessing it could do the same to you.” He jerked his thumb over hisshoulder. “Look what I did to this monster with just a single cut. All I have todo is to scratch you with it.” The blade actually shivered in his hands, hummingin what almost sounded like agreement.“You could not even get close to me,” the Disir mocked, swooping in, thebroadsword weaving before her in a mesmerizing pattern. She suddenly attackedwith a quick flurry of blows.Josh didn’t even have time to catch his breath. He managed to stop three ofthem, Clarent moving to intercept each strike, the Disir’s metal blade slammingoff his stone sword in a shower of sparks, each blow driving him back, the forcevibrating through his entire body. The Disir was just too fast. The next swipestruck his bare arm between the shoulder and elbow. Clarent managed to nudge thesword at the last instant, so it was only the flat of the blade, rather than therazor-sharp edge, that hit him. Instantly, his entire arm went numb fromshoulder to fingertips and he felt a sudden wash of nausea from the pain, thefear and the sudden realization that he was going to die. Clarent fell from hisgrasp and clattered to the ground.When the woman smiled, Josh saw that her teeth were thin needle points. “Easy.Too easy. A legendary sword does not make you a swordsman.” Hefting thebroadsword, she advanced on the boy, driving him right up against Nidhogg’sstone-flesh. Josh squeezed his eyes shut as she raised her arms high andscreamed a hideous war cry. “Odin!”“Sophie,” he whispered. “Josh!”Two blocks away, stuck in unmoving traffic, Sophie Newman sat bolt upright inthe backseat of the car, a sudden stomach-churning feeling of terror catchingher in her chest, setting her heart pounding madly.Nicholas spun around and caught the girl’s hand. “Tell me!”Tears filled her eyes. “Josh,” she gasped, almost unable to speak with the lumpin her throat. “Josh is in danger, terrible danger.” The car filled with theoverpowering smell of rich vanilla as her aura blossomed. Tiny sparks danced onthe end of her blond hair, crackling like cellophane. “We’ve got to get to him!”“We’re going nowhere,” Joan said grimly. Traffic on the narrow street was at acomplete standstill.A chill settled in Sophie’s stomach: it was the appalling fear that her brotherwas going to die.“Sidewalk,” Nicholas said decisively. “Take it.”“But the pedestrians—”“Can get out of the way. Use your horn.” He swiveled back around to Sophie.“We’re minutes away,” he said as Joan bumped the small car up off the pavementand roared down the sidewalk, horn squeaking plaintively.“That’s going to be too late. There must be something you can do?” Sophiepleaded desperately. “Anything?”Looking old and tired, lines etched into his forehead and around his eyes,Nicholas Flamel shook his head miserably. “There is nothing I can do,” headmitted. Sparking, crackling, snapping, a sheet of stinking yellow-white flame winkedinto existence between Josh and the Disir. The heat was so intense it drove himback onto Nidhogg’s clawed feet and crisped his hair, scorching his eyebrows andeyelashes. The Disir too staggered back, blinded by the foul flames.“Josh!”Someone called his name, but the terrifying flames were roaring right in frontof his face.The proximity of the fire roused the monster. It took a shuddering step, themovement of its leg thrusting Josh forward onto his hands and knees, pitchinghim dangerously close to the flames…which died as abruptly as they had risen. Hehit the ground hard, hands and knees stinging with the contact. The smell ofrotten eggs was appalling and his eyes and nose were streaming, but through histears, he saw Clarent and attempted to reach for it just as someone shouted athim again.“Josh!”The Disir threw herself at Josh once more, sword thrusting at him. A solid spearof yellow flame struck the woman, exploding over her chain mail, whichimmediately started to rust and fall away. And then another wall of flame roaredinto existence between the boy and the warrior.“Josh.” A hand fell on Josh’s shoulder and he jumped, shouting aloud with frightand the pain in his bruised shoulder. He looked up to find Dr. John Dee leaningover him.Dirty yellow smoke dribbled from the Magician’s hands, which were barely coveredin torn gray gloves, and his once-elegant suit was now a ruined mess. Dee smiledkindly. “It would be best if we left right now.” He gestured toward the flames.“I can’t keep this up forever.” Even as he was speaking, the Disir’s blade cutblindly through the fire, flames curling around the metal as it sought a target.Dee hauled Josh to his feet and dragged him backward.“Wait,” Josh said hoarsely, voice raw with a combination of fear and the smoke.“Scatty…” He coughed and tried again. “Scatty is trapped….”“Escaped,” Dee said quickly, putting an arm around the boy’s shoulder,supporting him, leading him toward a police car.“Escaped?” Josh mumbled, confused.“Nidhogg lost its grip on her when I created the curtain of fire between you andthe Disir. I saw her roll away from its claws, jump to her feet and race downthe quay.”“She ran…she ran away?” That didn’t sound right. She’d been limp and unconsciousthe last time he’d seen her. He tried to concentrate, but his head wasthrobbing, and the flesh on his face felt tight from the flames.“Even the legendary Warrior could not stand against Nidhogg. Heroes survive tofight again because they know when to run.”“She left me?”“I doubt she even knew you were there,” Dee said quickly, bundling Josh into theback of a badly parked police car and sliding in beside him. He tapped thewhite-haired driver on the shoulder. “Let’s go.”Josh sat up straight. “Wait…I dropped Clarent,” he said.“Trust me,” Dee said, “you don’t want to return for it.” He leaned back so thatJosh could look out the window. The Disir, her once-pristine white chain mailnow hanging in tattered and rotting shreds about her, strode through the dyingyellow flames. She spotted the boy in the back of the car and raced toward it,shouting unintelligibly in a language that sounded like wolves howling.“Niccolò,” Dee said quickly. “She’s rather upset. We really should be going now,right now.”Josh looked away from the approaching Disir at the driver and was horrified todiscover that it was the same man he’d seen on Sacré-Coeur’s steps.Machiavelli turned the key in the ignition so savagely that the starterscreeched. The car lurched, jerked forward, then died.“Oh great,” Dee muttered. “That’s just great.” Josh watched as the Magicianleaned out the window, brought his hand to his mouth and blew sharply into it. Ayellow sphere of smoke rolled from his palm and dropped onto the ground. Itbounced twice like a rubber ball, then exploded at head height just as itreached the Disir. Thick, sticky strands the color and consistency of dirtyhoney splashed over the Disir, then dripped down in long streamers, gluing herto the ground. “That should hold her…,” Dee began. The Disir’s broadsword slicedeasily through the strands. “Or maybe not.”Through his pain, Josh realized that Machiavelli had tried—and failed—to get thecar started again. “Let me,” he muttered, scrambling over the back of the seatas Machiavelli slid over to the passenger side. His right shoulder was stillaching, but at least feeling had returned to his fingers, and he didn’t thinkanything was broken. He was going to have a massive bruise to add to his growingcollection. Turning the key in the ignition, he floored the accelerator andsimultaneously slammed the car into reverse just as the Disir reached it. He wassuddenly thankful that he’d learned to drive a stick shift on his father’s oldbattered Volvo. The warrior’s flailing sword struck the door, puncturing themetal, the tip of the blade inches from Josh’s leg. As the car screechedbackward, the Disir set her feet firmly and held on to her sword with bothhands. The blade tore a horizontal rip right across the door and into the wingover the engine, peeling back the metal as if it were paper. It also tore apartthe front driver’s-side tire, which exploded with a dull bang.“Keep going!” Dee shouted.“I’m not stopping,” Josh promised.With the engine whining in protest and the front tire flapping and banging offthe ground, Josh tore away from the quayside… …just as Joan wheeled the slightly scratched Citroën in at the other end.Joan hit the brakes and the car screeched to a halt on the morning-wet stones.Sophie, Nicholas and Joan watched in confusion as Josh reversed a batteredpolice car at high speed away from Nidhogg and the Disir. They could clearly seeDee and Machiavelli in the car as he executed a clumsy handbrake turn and spedfrom the parking lot.For a single heartbeat, the Disir stood on the quayside, looking lost andbewildered. Then she spotted the newcomers. Turning, she raced toward them,sword held high over her head, screeching a barbaric war cry."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FORTY-ONE“I’ll take care of this,” Joan said, sounding almost pleased at the prospect.She touched Flamel’s sleeve and nodded to where the Warrior was still wrapped inNidhogg’s claws. “Get Scathach.” The monster was now less than six feet from theedge of the quay and edging ever closer to the safety of the water.The tiny Frenchwoman grabbed her sword and leapt out of the car.“More humani with swords,” the Disir spat, blade falling toward the woman.“Not just any humani,” Joan said, easily turning the weapon aside, her own swordthen flicking out to clink against the remains of the rusted mail on the Disir’sshoulders. “I am Joan of Arc!” The longsword in her hands twirled and twisted,creating a spinning wheel of steel that drove the Disir back with the ferocityof its attack. “I am the Maid of Orléans.”image [images/Scot_9780375849084_epub_002_r1.jpg]Sophie and Nicholas moved cautiously toward Nidhogg. Sophie noted that itsentire tail was coated with heavy black stone, which had now started to creep upits back and down its hind legs. The weight of the stone tail anchored thecreature to the ground, and Sophie saw its huge muscles bunching and rippling asit tugged itself toward the water. She could see where its claws and draggingtail left deep indentations in the pavement.“Sophie,” Flamel shouted, “I need some help!”“But Josh…,” she began, distracted.“Josh is gone,” he snapped. He swooped in to snatch Clarent off the ground,hissing in surprise at the heat of the weapon. Darting forward, he slapped atNidhogg with the sword. The blade bounced harmlessly off the stone-sheathedskin. “Sophie, help me free Scatty and then we’ll go after Josh. Use yourpowers.”The Alchemyst hacked at Nidhogg again but without any effect. His worst fearshad been realized: Dee had gotten his hands on Josh…and Josh had the last twopages from the Codex. Nicholas looked over his shoulder. Sophie was standingstill, looking frightened and completely bemused.“Sophie! Help me.”Sophie obediently raised her hands, pressed her thumb against her tattoo andtried to call on her Fire magic. Nothing happened. She couldn’t concentrate; shewas too worried about her brother. What was he doing? Why had he gone with Deeand Machiavelli? It didn’t look as though they had forced him to—he’d beendriving them!“Sophie!” Nicholas called.But she knew he’d been in danger—real and terrible danger. She’d felt theemotion deep within her, recognized it for what it was. Whenever Josh was introuble, she knew. When he’d nearly drowned off Pakala Beach on Kauai, she’dwoken up breathless and gasping; when he’d broken his ribs on the football fieldin Pittsburgh, she’d distinctly felt the sharp pain in her left side, felt thesting with every breath she took.“Sophie!”What had happened? One moment he was in mortal danger…and the next…?“Sophie!” Flamel snarled.“What?” she snapped, turning on the Alchemyst. She felt a quick surge of anger;Josh was right—he’d been right all along. This was the Alchemyst’s fault.“Sophie,” he said more gently. “I need you to help me. I can’t do this on myown.”Sophie turned to look at the Alchemyst. He was crouched on the ground, coolgreen vapor puddling around him. A thick emerald cord of smoke wrapped aroundone of Nidhogg’s huge legs and disappeared deep into the earth, where it lookedas if Flamel had attempted to trap it. Another rope of smoke, thinner, lesssubstantial than the first, was loosely wrapped around one of the creature’shind legs. Nidhogg inched forward and the green cord snapped and dissolved intothe air. Another few steps and it would carry Scathach—her friend—into theriver. Sophie wasn’t going to let that happen.Her fear and anger lent her focus. When she pressed her tattoo, flames poppedalight on each finger. She splashed silver fire across Nidhogg’s back, but ithad no effect. Then she peppered the monster with tiny fiery hailstones, but itdidn’t even seem to notice. It continued to edge nearer to the water.Fire didn’t work, so she tried wind. But the miniature tornados she threwbounced harmlessly off the creature. Scouring the Witch’s memories, she tried atrick Hekate had used against the Mongol Horde. She whipped up a sharp wind thatdrove stinging grit and dirt into Nidhogg’s eyes. The creature merely blinkedand a second, protective eyelid slid down over its huge eye.“Nothing’s working!” she screamed as the monster dragged Scatty ever closer tothe edge. “Nothing’s working!” The Disir’s sword slashed out. Joan ducked, and the heavy blade whistled overher head and sliced into the Citroën, turning the windshield into white powder,popping off the tiny windshield wipers.Joan was furious; she loved her 2CV Charleston. Francis had wanted to buy her anew car for her birthday, in January. He’d given her a pile of glossy carcatalogs and told her to pick one. She’d pushed the catalogs aside and told himshe’d always wanted the little classic French car. He’d searched all over Europefor the perfect model and then spent a small fortune having it restored to itsoriginal pristine condition. When he’d presented it to her, it had been wrappedin three thick ribbons of blue, white and red.Another wide slash from the Disir scored a rent on the hood of the car, and thenanother cut off the small round headlight that perched over the right frontwheel arch like an eye. The light bounced away and shattered.“Do you know,” Joan asked, her huge eyes dark with fury, renewing her attack onthe Disir, every word matched by a hammer blow from her sword, “how difficult itis to find original parts for this car?”The Disir fell back, desperately trying to defend herself from Joan’s whirlingblade, pieces of her rotting chain mail flying away as the small Frenchwoman’ssword struck closer and closer. She kept trying different fighting styles todefend herself, but nothing was effective against the ferocious onslaught.“You will notice,” Joan continued, pushing the warrior back toward the river,“that I have no fighting style. That is because I was trained by the greatestwarrior of all. I was trained by Scathach the Shadow.”“You may defeat me,” the Disir said grimly, “but my sisters will avenge mydeath.”“Your sisters,” Joan said, with a final savage cut that snapped the Disir’sblade in two. “Would they be the two Valkyries currently frozen into their ownpersonal iceberg?”The Disir faltered, swaying on the edge of the wall along the river.“Impossible. We are undefeatable.”“Everyone can be defeated.” The flat of Joan’s blade clanged against the Disir’shelmet, stunning her. Then Joan darted forward, her shoulder catching theswaying Disir in the chest, knocking her backward into the Seine. “Only ideasare immortal,” she whispered.Still clutching the broken remains of her sword, the Valkyrie disappeared intothe murky river in a huge splash that drenched Joan from head to toe. Sophie was puzzled. Her magic had failed against Nidhogg…but how had Josh…? Hehad no powers.The sword: he had the sword.Sophie snatched Clarent from Flamel’s hand. And instantly her aura snapped tolife, sparking, crackling, long streamers of icy light spinning around her body.She felt a rush of emotions, a swirling mess of thoughts, ugly thoughts, darkthoughts, the memories and emotions of those men and women who had carried thesword in ages past. She was about to fling the weapon away in disgust, but sheknew it was probably Scatty’s only chance. Nidhogg’s tail was wounded, so Joshmust have cut it there. But she’d seen the Alchemyst hack at the tough hide withno result.Unless…Racing up to the monster, she plunged the weapon point first into its shoulder.The effect was immediate. Red-black fire burned along the length of the blade,and the monster’s skin immediately started to harden. Sophie’s aura blazedbrighter than it had ever been before, and instantly her brain was filled withimpossible visions and incredible memories. Then her aura overloaded and winkedout in an explosion that picked her up and sent her sailing through the air. Shemanaged to scream once before she came crashing down onto the canvas roof ofJoan’s Citroën, which slowly and gently ripped along its seams and deposited herneatly in the front passenger seat.Nidhogg spasmed, great claws opening as its flesh hardened.Joan of Arc darted through the monster’s legs, grabbed Scatty around the waistand jerked her free, oblivious to the creature’s huge feet stamping inches fromher head.Nidhogg bellowed, a sound that set house alarms clanging across the city. Everycar alarm in the parking lot burst to life. The beast attempted to turn itshead, to follow Joan as she dragged Scatty away, but its ancient flesh wassolidifying into thick black stone. Its mouth opened, revealing its daggerliketeeth.Abruptly, a huge section of the quayside cracked; rock pulverized to dust,crumpling to powder beneath the creature’s weight. Nidhogg tilted forward andcrashed down through the moored tourist boat, snapping it in two, disappearinginto the Seine in an enormous explosion of water that sent a huge wave racingdown the river.Lying on the quayside, close to the water’s edge, soaked through, Scathach cameslowly, groggily awake. “I haven’t felt this bad in centuries,” she mumbled,attempting but failing to sit up. Joan eased her into a sitting position andheld her tightly. “The last thing I remember…” Scatty’s green eyes snapped open.“Nidhogg…Josh.”“He tried to save you,” Flamel said, limping up to Scatty and Joan. He snatchedClarent from the quayside. “He stabbed Nidhogg, slowed it down long enough forus to get here. Then Joan fought the Disir for you.”“We all fought for you,” Joan said. She put her arm around Sophie, who hadstaggered from the wrecked car, bruised and battered, with a long scrape alongher forearm but otherwise unharmed. “Sophie finally defeated Nidhogg.”The Warrior slowly got to her feet, turning her head from side to side, workingher stiff neck muscles. “And Josh?” she asked, looking around. Her eyes wentwide with alarm. “Where’s Josh?”“Dee and Machiavelli have him,” Flamel said, his face gray with exhaustion.“We’re not sure how.”“We have to go after them now,” Sophie said urgently.“Their car’s not in good shape, they cannot have gotten far,” Flamel said. Heturned to look at the Citroën. “I’m afraid yours has taken a battering as well.”“And I did so love that car…,” Joan murmured.“Let’s get out of here,” Scatty said decisively. “We’re about to be inundatedwith police.”And then, like a shark erupting from the waves, Dagon exploded out of the Seine.Rearing up, more fish now than man, gills open on his long neck, round eyesbulging, he wrapped webbed claws around Scathach and dragged her backward intothe river. “Finally, Shadow. Finally.”They disappeared into the water with barely a splash and didn’t reappear."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FORTY-TWOPerenelle followed de Ayala’s ghost as he led her through the maze of Alcatraz’sruined buildings. She tried to keep to the shadows, ducking under shatteredwalls and empty doorways, constantly alert for creatures moving in the night.She didn’t think the sphinx would dare venture out of the prison—despite theirterrifying appearance, sphinxes were cowardly creatures, fearful of the dark.However, many of the beings she’d seen in the spiderwebbed cells below werecreatures of the night.The entrance to the tunnel was almost directly under the tower that had onceheld the island’s only fresh water supply. Its metal framework was rusted, eatenaway by the salt sea, acid bird droppings and countless tiny leaks from the hugewater tank. However, the ground directly beneath the tower was lush with growth,fed by the same dripping water.De Ayala pointed out an irregular patch of earth close to one of the metal legs.“You will find a shaft leading down to the tunnel under here. There is anotherentrance to the tunnel cut into the cliff face,” he said, “but it is onlyaccessible by boat at low tide. That is how Dee brought his prisoner to theisland. He doesn’t know about this entrance.”Perenelle found a rusted length of metal and used it to scrape away the dirt,revealing broken and cracked concrete beneath the soil. Using the edge of themetal bar, she began to dig away at the dirt. She kept glancing up, trying togauge how close the birds had come to the island, but with the wind whipping inover the ruined buildings and keening through the rusted metal struts of thewater tower, it was impossible to make out any other noises. Tendrils of thethick fog that had claimed San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge had nowreached the island, coating everything in a dripping, salt-smelling cloud.When she had scraped back the earth, de Ayala drifted over one particular spot.“Just here,” he said, his voice a breath in her ear. “The prisoners discoveredthe existence of the tunnel and managed to dig a shaft down to it. Theyunderstood that decades of water dripping from the tower had softened the soiland even eaten away at the stones beneath. But when they eventually brokethrough to the tunnel below, it was at high tide, and they found that it wasflooded. They abandoned their efforts.” He showed his teeth in a perfect smilehe had not possessed in life. “If only they had waited until the tide turned.”Perenelle scraped away more soil, revealing more broken stone. Jamming the metalbar under the edge of a block, she leaned hard on it. The stone didn’t budge.She pressed again with both hands, and then, when that didn’t work, lifted aboulder and hammered once on the metal bar: the clink rang out across theisland, tolling like a bell.“Oh, this is impossible,” she muttered. She was reluctant to use her powers,since it would reveal her location to the sphinx, but she had no other choice.Cupping her right hand, she allowed her aura to gather in her palm, where itpuddled like mercury. She rested her hand lightly, almost gently, on the stone,then turned her hand over and allowed the raw power to pour from her palm andseep into the granite. The stone turned soft and soapy and then melted likecandle wax. Thick globs of liquid rock fell away and disappeared into thedarkness below.“I’ve been dead a long time; I thought I’d seen wonders, but I’ve never seenanything like that,” de Ayala said in awe.“A Scythian mage taught me the spell in return for saving his life. It’s quitesimple, really,” she said. She leaned over the hole and then jerked back, eyeswatering. “Oh my: it stinks!”The ghost of Juan Manuel de Ayala hovered directly over the hole. He turned andsmiled, showing his perfect teeth again. “I can’t smell anything.”“Trust me, be glad you cannot,” Perenelle muttered, shaking her head; ghostsoften had a peculiar sense of humor. The tunnel reeked of rotting fish andancient seaweed, of rancid bird and bat droppings, of pulped wood and rustingmetal. There was another scent also, bitter and acrid, almost like vinegar.Bending down, she tore a strip off the bottom of her dress and wrapped it aroundher nose and mouth as a crude mask.“There is a ladder of sorts,” de Ayala said, “but be careful, I’m sure it’srusted through.” He suddenly glanced up. “The birds have reached the southernend of the island. And something else. Something evil. I can feel it.”“The Morrigan.” Perenelle leaned over the hole and snapped her fingers. Aslender feather of soft white light peeled off her fingertips and drifted downthe hole, disappearing into the gloom below, shedding a flickering milky lighton the streaked and dripping walls. The light had also revealed the narrowladder, which turned out to be little more than spikes driven at irregularangles into the wall. The spikes, each no longer than four inches, were thickwith rust and dripping moisture. Leaning over, she caught the first spike andtugged hard. It seemed solid enough.Perenelle twisted around and slid one leg into the opening. Her foot found oneof the spikes and immediately slipped off. Drawing her leg back out of the hole,she tugged off her sandals and tucked them into her belt. She could hear theflapping of birds—thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of them—drawing closer.She knew her tiny expenditure of power to melt the stone and light up theinterior of the tunnel would have alerted the Morrigan to her position. She hadonly moments before the birds arrived….Perenelle put her leg into the shaft again, her bare foot touching the spike. Itwas cold and slimy beneath her skin, but at least she was able to get a bettergrip. Grasping handfuls of tough grass, she lowered herself, her foot findinganother spike, and then she reached down and caught a spike in her left hand.She winced. It felt disgusting, squelching beneath her fingers. And then shesmiled; how she’d changed. When she was a girl, growing up in Quimper in Franceall those years ago, she’d gone paddling in rock pools, picking and eating rawshellfish. She’d wandered barefoot through streets that were ankle deep in mudand filth.Testing each step, Perenelle climbed down the length of the shaft. At one pointa spike broke away beneath her foot and went clanging into the darkness. Itseemed to fall for a long time. She lay back against the foul wall, feeling thedamp soak through her thin summer dress. Holding on desperately, she soughtanother spike. She felt the metal nail in her hand shift, and for aheart-stopping moment, she thought it was going to pull free of the wall. But itheld.“A close call. I thought you were going to be joining me,” the ghost of de Ayalasaid, materializing out of the gloom directly before her face.“I’m not that easy to kill,” Perenelle said grimly, continuing to climb down.“Though it would be funny if, having survived decades of concentrated attacksfrom Dee and his Dark Elders, I was to die in a fall.” She looked at the vagueshape of the face before her. “What’s happening up there?” She jerked her headin the direction of the opening of the shaft, visible only because of the wispsof gray fog that curled and dribbled into it.“The island is covered with birds,” de Ayala said. “Perhaps a hundred thousandof them; they are perched on every available surface. The Crow Goddess has goneinto the heart of the prison, no doubt in search of the sphinx.”“We don’t have much time,” Perenelle warned. She took another step and her footsank up to the ankle in thick gooey mud. She had reached the bottom of theshaft. The mud was icy cold, and she could feel the chill seeping into herbones. Something crawled over her toes. “Which way?”De Ayala’s arm appeared, ghostly white, directly in front of her, pointing tothe left. She realized that she was standing at the mouth of a tall, roughlyhewn tunnel that sloped gently downward. De Ayala’s ghostly luminescence lit upthe coating of spiders’ webs that sheathed the walls. They were so thick that itlooked as if the walls were painted silver.“I cannot go any farther,” the ghost said, his voice rasping around the walls.“Dee has placed incredibly powerful warding spells and sigils in the tunnel; Icannot get past. The cell you are looking for is about ten paces ahead and onyour left-hand side.”Although Perenelle was reluctant to use her magic, she knew she had no choice.She was certainly not going to wander into a tunnel in pitch-darkness. Shesnapped her fingers and a globe of white fire winked to life over her rightshoulder. It shed a soft opalescent glow over the tunnel, picking out eachspider’s web in intricate detail. The webs stretched in a thick curtain rightacross the opening. She could see webs woven on top of webs and wondered howmany spiders were down here.Perenelle stepped forward, the light moving with her, and she suddenly saw thefirst of the Wards and protections Dee had placed along the tunnel. A series oftall metal-tipped wooden spears had been implanted deep in the muddy floor. Theflat metal head of each spear was painted with an ancient symbol of power, asquare hieroglyph that would have been familiar to the ancient Maya peoples ofCentral America. She could see at least a dozen spears, each painted with adifferent symbol. She knew that individually the symbols were meaningless, buttogether they set up an incredibly powerful zigzagging network of raw power thatcrisscrossed the corridor with invisible beams of black light. It reminded herof the complicated laser alarms banks used. The power had no effect onhumans—all she could feel was a dull buzzing and a tension at the back of herneck—but it was an impenetrable barrier to any of the Elder Race, the NextGeneration and the Creatures of the Were. Even de Ayala, a ghost, was affectedby the barrier.Perenelle recognized some of the symbols on the spearheads; she had seen them inthe Codex and etched onto the walls of the ruins at Palenque in Mexico. Most ofthem predated mankind; many of them were even older than the Elders and belongedto the race that had inhabited the earth in the far-distant past. They were theWords of Power, the ancient Symbols of Binding, designed to protect—ortrap—something either incredibly valuable or extraordinarily dangerous.She had a feeling this was going to be the latter.And she also wondered where Dee had discovered the ancient words.Sloshing through the thick mud, Perenelle took her first step into the tunnel.All the spiderwebs rustled and trembled, a sound like the whispering rustle ofleaves. There must be millions of spiders in here, she thought. They didn’tfrighten her; she’d come up against creatures much more frightening thanspiders, but she was aware that there were probably poisonous brown recluses,black widows or even South American hunting spiders amongst the mass ofarachnids. A bite from one of them would certainly incapacitate her, possiblyeven kill her.Perenelle jerked one of the spears out of the mud and used it to swipe away theweb. The square symbol on the spearhead glowed red and the gossamer webs hissedand sizzled where the spear touched them. A thick shadow that she knew was amass of spiders flowed backward into the gloom. Advancing slowly down the narrowtunnel, she knocked over each spear she came to, allowing the filthy mud to washaway the Words of Power, gradually dismantling the intricate pattern of magic.If Dee had gone to all this trouble to trap something in the cell, it meant thathe couldn’t control it. Perenelle wanted to find out what it was and free it.But as she drew nearer, the globe over her shoulder throwing a flickering lightacross the corridor, another thought crossed her mind: had Dee imprisonedsomething that even she should be afraid of, something ancient, somethinghorrible? Suddenly, she didn’t know if she was making a terrible mistake.The doorposts and the entrance to the cell had been painted with symbols thathurt her eyes to look at. Harsh and angular, they seemed to shift and twist onthe rock, not unlike the writing in the Book of Abraham. But whereas the lettersin the ancient book formed words in languages she mostly understood, or at leastrecognized, these symbols twisted into unimaginable shapes.She bent down, scooped up some of the mud and splashed it over the letters,erasing them. Only when she had completely cleaned away the primeval Words ofPower did she step forward and send the globe of light twisting and bobbing intothe cell.It took Perenelle a single heartbeat to make sense out of what she was seeing.And in that moment, she realized that dismantling the protective pattern ofpower might indeed have been a terrible mistake.The entire cell was a thick cocoon of spiders’ webs. In the center of the cell,dangling from a single strand of silk no thicker than her index finger, was aspider. The creature was enormous, easily the same size as the huge water towerthat dominated the island above her head. It vaguely resembled a tarantula butbristling purple hair tipped with gray covered its entire body. Each of itseight legs was thicker than Perenelle. Set in the center of its body was a huge,almost human head. It was smooth and round, with no ears, no nose and only ahorizontal slash for a mouth. Like a tarantula, it had eight tiny eyes set closeto the top of the skull.And one by one, the eyes slowly opened, each the color of an old bruise. Theyfixed on the woman’s face. Then the mouth widened, and two long spearlike fangsappeared. “Madame Perenelle. Sorceress,” it lisped.“Areop-Enap,” she said in wonder, acknowledging the ancient spider Elder. “Ithought you were dead.”“You mean you thought you’d killed me!”The web twitched and suddenly the hideous creature launched itself at Perenelle."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FORTY-THREEDr. John Dee leaned across the backseat of the police car. “Turn here,” he saidto Josh. He saw the expression on the young man’s face and added, “Please.”Josh hit the brakes and the car slid and screeched, the front tire nowcompletely torn away and the wheel running on the metal rim, kicking up sparks.“Now here.” Dee pointed to a narrow alleyway lined on both sides with rows ofplastic trash cans. Watching him in the rearview mirror, Josh could see that hekept twisting in the seat to look behind him.“Is she following?” Machiavelli asked.“I can’t see her,” Dee said crisply, “but I think we need to get off thestreets.”Josh struggled to control the car. “We won’t get much farther in this,” hebegan, and then hit the first trash can, which toppled into a second and then athird, scattering rubbish across the alley. He turned the steering wheel sharplyto avoid running over one of the fallen bins and the engine began to bangalarmingly. The car wobbled and then suddenly stopped, smoke billowing from thehood. “Out,” Josh said quickly. “I think we’re on fire.” He scrambled out of thecar, Machiavelli and Dee exiting on the other side. Then they turned and randown the alley, away from the car. They had taken perhaps half a dozen stepswhen there was a dull thump and the car burst into flames. Thick black smokebegan spiraling upward into the sky.“Wonderful,” Dee said bitterly. “So now the Disir definitely knows where we are.And she’s not going to be happy.”“Well, not with you, that’s for sure,” Machiavelli said with a wry smile.“Me?” Dee looked surprised.“I’m not the one who set fire to her,” Machiavelli reminded him.It was like listening to children. “Enough, already!” Josh rounded on the twomen. “Who was that…that woman?”“That,” Machiavelli said with a grim smile, “was a Valkyrie.”“A Valkyrie?”“Sometimes called a Disir.”“A Disir?” Josh found that he wasn’t even surprised by the response. He didn’tcare what the woman was called; all he cared about was that she’d tried to slicehim in two with a sword. Maybe this was a dream, he thought suddenly, andeverything that had happened from the moment Dee and the Golems had stepped intothe bookshop was nothing more than a nightmare. And then he moved his right armand his bruised shoulder protested. He winced in pain. The skin on his burnedface felt tight and stiff, and when he licked his dry, cracked lips, he realizedthat this was no dream. He was wide awake—this was a living nightmare.Josh stepped back from the two men. He looked up and down the narrow alley.There were tall houses on one side, and what looked like a hotel was on theother. The walls were daubed with layers of cursive and ornate graffiti, some ofwhich had even been sprayed onto the trash cans. Standing on his toes, he triedto see the skyline, looking for the Eiffel Tower or Sacré-Coeur, something togive him an idea where he was. “I’ve got to get back,” he said, edging fartherfrom the two disheveled men. According to Flamel, they were the enemy—especiallyDee. And yet Dee had just saved him from the Disir.Dee turned to look at him, gray eyes twinkling kindly. “Why, Josh, where are yougoing?”“Back to my sister.”“And Flamel and Saint-Germain too? Tell me; what are they going to do for you?”Josh took another step backward. He had seen Dee throw spears of fire on twooccasions—in the bookshop and at the Disir—and he was unsure how far theMagician could actually toss them. Not far, he figured. Another step or two andhe would turn and run down the alleyway. He could stop the first person he metand ask directions to the Eiffel Tower. He thought the French for “where is?”was “où est?” or maybe it was “qui est?” Or did that mean “who is?” He shook hishead slightly, regretting not having paid attention in French class. “Don’t tryand stop me,” he began, turning away.“What did it feel like?” Dee asked suddenly.Josh slowly turned to look at the Magician. He knew instantly what he wastalking about. He found that his fingers had automatically curled, as if he wereholding the hilt of a sword.“What was it like holding Clarent, feeling that raw power running through you?What was it like knowing the thoughts and emotions of the creature you’d juststabbed?” Dee reached under his tattered suit coat and pulled out Clarent’stwin: Excalibur. “It is an awe-inspiring feeling, is it not?” He turned theblade in his hand, a blue-black trickle of energy shivering across the stonesword. “I know you must have experienced Nidhogg’s thoughts…emotions…memories?”Josh nodded. They were still fresh—startlingly vivid—in his head. The thoughts,the sights, were so alien, so bizarre, that he knew he’d never have been able toimagine them himself.“For an instant you knew what it was to be godlike: to see worlds beyondimagination, to experience alien emotions. You saw the past, the very distantpast…you might even have seen Nidhogg’s Shadowrealm.”Josh nodded slowly, wondering how Dee knew.The Magician took a step closer to the boy. “For an instant, Josh, the merestinstant, it was like being Awakened—though nowhere near as intense,” he addedquickly. “And you do want to have your powers Awakened?”Josh nodded. He felt breathless, his heart hammering in his chest. Dee wasright; in those moments he’d held Clarent, he’d felt alive, truly alive. “But itcan’t be done,” he said quickly.Dee laughed. “Oh yes, it can. It can be done here, today,” he finishedtriumphantly.“But Flamel said…,” Josh began, and then stopped, realizing what he’d just said.If he could be Awakened…“Flamel says many things. I doubt even he knows what is the truth anymore.”“Do you?” Josh snapped.“Always.” Dee jerked his thumb over his shoulder at Machiavelli. “The Italian isno friend of mine,” he said quietly, staring directly into Josh’s troubled eyes.“So ask him the question: ask him if your powers could be Awakened this verymorning.”Josh turned to regard Niccolò Machiavelli. The tall white-haired man lookedvaguely troubled, but he nodded in agreement. “The English Magician is correct:your powers could be Awakened today. I imagine we could probably find someone todo it within the hour.”Smiling triumphantly, Dee turned back to Josh. “It’s your choice. So, give meyour answer—do you want to go back to Flamel and his vague promises, or do youwant to have your powers Awakened?”Even as he was turning to follow the black threads of dark energy that driftedoff Excalibur’s stone blade, Josh knew the answer. He remembered the feelings,the emotions, the power, that had coursed through his body when he’d heldClarent. And Dee had said those feelings were nowhere near as intense as beingAwakened.“I need an answer,” Dee said.Josh Newman took a deep breath. “What do I have to do?”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FORTY-FOURJoan swung the battered Citroën into the mouth of the alleyway and eased the carto a halt, blocking the entrance. Leaning over the steering wheel, she scouredthe alley, looking for movement, wondering if this was a trap.Following Josh had been remarkably easy; all she’d had to do was to follow thegouge cut into the street by the metal rim of his car’s front wheel. She’d had abrief moment of panic when she’d lost him in a maze of back streets, but then athick plume of black smoke rose over the rooftops and she’d followed that: ithad led her to the alley and the burning police car.“Stay here,” she commanded the exhausted Flamel and the ashen-faced Sophie asshe climbed out of the car. She carried her sword loosely in her right hand asshe walked down the alley, tapping the blade gently against the palm of her lefthand. She was fairly sure that they were too late and that Dee, Machiavelli andJosh were gone, but she wasn’t prepared to take any risks.Padding silently down the center of the alley, wary of the piles of trash cansthat could be hiding an assailant, Joan realized she was still in a state ofshock following Scatty’s disappearance. One moment Joan had been standing infront of her old friend, and the next, the creature that was more fish than manhad reared up out of the water and dragged Scatty down with him.Joan blinked away tears. She had known Scathach for more than five hundredyears. In those early centuries they’d been inseparable, adventuring togetheracross the world into countries yet to be explored by the West, encounteringtribes that still lived as their ancestors had thousands of years in the past.They’d discovered lost islands, hidden cities and forgotten countries, andScatty had even taken her into some of the Shadowrealms, where they had foughtcreatures that had long been extinct on the earth. In the Shadowrealms, Joan hadseen her friend fight and defeat creatures that existed only in the darkesthuman myths. Joan knew that nothing could stand against the Shadow…and yetScatty herself had always said that she could be defeated, that she was immortalbut not invulnerable. Joan had always imagined that when Scatty finally laiddown her life it would be in one final dramatic and extraordinary event…not bybeing dragged into a dirty river by an overgrown fish-man.Joan grieved for her friend, and she would weep for her, but not now. Not yet.Joan of Arc had been a warrior from the time she was barely a teenager, ridinginto battle at the head of a massive French army. She had seen too many friendsfall in battle and had learned that if she concentrated on their deaths shewould be incapable of fighting. Right now she knew she needed to protectNicholas and the girl. Later, there would be time to grieve for Scathach theShadow, and there would also be time to go in search of the creature Flamel hadcalled Dagon. Joan hefted the sword in her hand. She would avenge her friend.The petite Frenchwoman walked past the blazing remains of the police car andcrouched on the ground, expertly reading the traces and signs on the dampstones. She heard Nicholas and Sophie climb out of the battered Citroën and walkdown the alley, stepping around puddles of oil and dirty water. Nicholas wascarrying Clarent. Joan distinctly heard it buzz as he approached the burningcar, and she wondered if it was still connected to the boy.“They ran from the car and stopped here,” she said, without looking up, as theystopped beside her. “Dee and Machiavelli were facing Josh. He stood over there.”She pointed. “They ran through the water back there; you can clearly see theoutlines of their shoes on the ground.”Sophie and Flamel leaned over and looked at the ground. They nodded, though sheknew they could see nothing.“Now, this is interesting,” she continued. “At one stage Josh’s footsteps arepointing down the alley, and he’s on the balls of his feet, almost as if he wasthinking about running. But look here.” She pointed to traces of heel prints onthe ground that only she could see. “The three of them walked off together, Deeand Josh first, Machiavelli following behind.”“Can you track them?” Flamel demanded.Joan shrugged. “To the end of the alley, maybe, but beyond that…” She shruggedagain and straightened up, dusting off her hands. “Impossible; there will be toomany other prints.”“What are we going to do?” Nicholas whispered. “How are we going to find theboy?”Joan’s eyes drifted from Flamel’s face to Sophie. “We can’t…but Sophie can.”“How?” he asked.Joan moved her hand in a horizontal line in front of her. It left the faintesttracery of light in the air, and the foul alley briefly smelled of lavender.“She’s his twin: she’ll be able to follow his aura.”Nicholas Flamel caught both of Sophie’s shoulders, forcing the girl to look intohis eyes. “Sophie!” he snapped. “Sophie, look at me.”Sophie raised red-rimmed eyes to look at the Alchemyst. She was completely numb.Scatty was gone, and now Josh had vanished, kidnapped by Dee and Machiavelli.Everything was falling apart.“Sophie,” Nicholas said very quietly, his pale eyes catching and holding hers.“I need you to be strong now.”“What’s the point?” she asked. “They’re gone.”“They’re not gone,” he said confidently.“But Scatty…” The girl hiccupped.“…is one of the most dangerous women in the world,” he finished. “She’s survivedfor over two thousand years and fought creatures infinitely more dangerous thanDagon.”Sophie wasn’t sure if he was trying to convince himself or her. “I saw thatthing drag her into the river, and we waited for at least ten minutes. Shedidn’t come back up. She must have drowned.” Her voice caught and she could feelthe tears pricking at the back of her eyes again. Her throat felt as if it wereon fire.“I’ve seen her survive worse, much worse.” Nicholas attempted a wan smile. “Ithink Dagon is in for a surprise! Scatty’s like a cat: she hates getting wet.The Seine runs very fast; they were probably swept downriver. She’ll contactus.”“But how? She’ll have no idea where we are.” Sophie really hated the way adultslied. They were just so transparent.“Sophie,” Nicholas said seriously. “If Scathach is alive, she will find us.Trust me.”And in that moment, Sophie realized that she did not trust the Alchemyst.Joan put her arm on Sophie’s shoulder and squeezed gently. “Nicholas is right.Scatty is…” She smiled, and her entire face lit up. “She is extraordinary. Heraunt once abandoned her in one of the Underworld Shadowrealms: it took hercenturies to find her way out. But she did it.”Sophie nodded slowly. She knew that what they were saying was true—the Witch ofEndor knew more about Scathach than either the Alchemyst or Joan—but she couldalso tell that they were very worried.“Now, Sophie,” Nicholas resumed. “I need you to find your brother.”“How?”“I’m hearing sirens,” Joan said urgently, looking back down the alley. “Lots ofsirens.”Flamel ignored her. He stared deep into Sophie’s bright blue eyes. “You can findhim,” he insisted. “You are his twin; it is a connection that goes even deeperthan blood. You’ve always known when he was in trouble, haven’t you?”Sophie nodded.“Nicholas…,” Joan prodded, “we are running out of time.”“You’ve always felt his pain, known when he was unhappy or upset?”Sophie nodded again.“You are connected to him, you can find him.” The Alchemyst turned the girlaround so that she was facing down the alleyway. “Josh was standing here,” hesaid, pointing. “Dee and Machiavelli were standing about here.”Sophie was confused and getting irritated. “But they’re gone now. They took himaway.”“I don’t think they forced him to go anywhere, I think he went with them of hisown free will,” Nicholas said very softly.The words hit Sophie like a blow. Josh wouldn’t leave her, would he? “But why?”Flamel shrugged slightly. “Who knows? Dee has always been very persuasive, andMachiavelli is a master manipulator. But we can find them, I’m sure of it. Yoursenses have been Awakened, Sophie. Look again; imagine Josh standing in front ofyou, see him….”Sophie took a deep breath and closed her eyes, then opened them again. She couldsee nothing out of the ordinary; she was standing in a dirty trash-strewn alley,the walls covered with curling ornate graffiti, with the smoke of the burningcar whirling around her.“His aura is gold,” Flamel continued. “Dee’s is yellow…Machiavelli’s gray ordirty white….”Sophie started to shake her head. “I can’t see anything,” she began.“Then let me help you.” Nicholas put his hand on her shoulder and suddenly thestink of the burning car was replaced with the fresh sharp smell of mint.Instantly, her aura flared around her body, crackling and spitting like afirework, the pure silver now tinged with the emerald green of Flamel’s aura.And then she saw… something.Directly in front of her she could make out the merest hint of Josh’s outline.It was ghostly and insubstantial, composed of little more than threads andsparkling dust motes of gold, and when he moved he trailed streaked lines ofgossamer color in the air behind him. Now that she knew what she was lookingfor, she could also make out the traces of Dee’s and Machiavelli’s outlines inthe air.She blinked slowly, afraid that the images would vanish, but they remainedhanging in the air before her, and if anything, the colors grew even moreintense. Josh’s aura was the brightest of all. She reached out blindly, herfingers touching the golden edge of her brother’s arm. The smoky outline twistedaway as if blown by a breeze.“I see them,” she said in awe, her voice barely above a whisper. She’d neverimagined she’d be able to do anything like this. “I can see their outlines.”“Where did they go?” Nicholas asked.Sophie followed the colored streaks in the air; they led to the end of thealley. “This way,” she said, and set off down the alleyway toward the street,with Nicholas close on her heels.Joan of Arc took one last lingering look at her battered car and then followed.“What are you thinking?” Flamel asked.“I’m thinking that when this is all over, I’m going to return the car to itsformer pristine condition. And then never take it out of the garage again.” “Something’s wrong,” Flamel said as they wove their way through the streets.Sophie was concentrating fiercely on following her twin and ignored him.“I’ve just been thinking the same thing,” Joan said. “The city is too quiet.”“Exactly.” Flamel looked around. Where were the Parisians on their way to workand the tourists determined to get to see the sights before the city grewstifling hot and crowded? The few people on the street hurried past, talkingexcitedly together. The air was filled with sirens, and there were policeeverywhere. And then Nicholas realized that Nidhogg’s rampage through the cityhad probably hit the news and people were being warned to stay off the streets.He wondered what excuse the authorities would make to explain the chaos.Sophie pushed her way blindly down the street, following the gossamer threadsthat Josh’s, Dee’s and Machiavelli’s auras had left in the air behind them. Shekept bumping into people and apologizing, but she never took her eyes off thesparkles of light. And then she noticed that as the sun rose higher in theheavens, it was becoming harder and harder to make out the pinpoints of coloredlight. She realized she was running out of time.Joan of Arc caught up with the Alchemyst. “Can she really see the afterimagesleft by their auras?” she asked in archaic French.“She can,” Nicholas replied in the same language. “The girl is extraordinarilypowerful: she has no idea of the extent of her powers.”“Have you any clue where we’re going?” Joan asked, looking around. She thoughtthey were somewhere in the vicinity of the Palais de Tokyo, but she’d beenconcentrating on the marks on the road left by the police car and hadn’t beenpaying too much attention to their whereabouts.“None,” Nicholas said, frowning. “I’m just wondering why we seem to be headinginto the back streets. I would have thought that Machiavelli would want to takethe boy into custody.”“Nicholas, they want the boy for themselves, or rather, the Elders do. What doesthe prophecy say? ‘The two that are one, the one that is all.’ One to save theworld, one to destroy it. The boy is a prize.” Without moving her head, her eyesflickered toward Sophie. “And the girl, too.”“I know that.”Joan rested her hand lightly on the Alchemyst’s arm. “You know that we mustnever allow both of them to fall into Dee’s hands.”Flamel’s face hardened into a mask. “I know that, too.”“What will you do?”“Whatever is necessary,” he said grimly.Joan pulled out a black cell phone. “I’m calling Francis; I’ll let him knowwe’re OK.” She looked around for a landmark. “Maybe he’ll know where we are.”Sophie turned into a narrow alleyway, barely wide enough for two people to passside by side. In the gloom, she could see the threads and speckled light moreclearly now. She even caught ghostly flashes of her brother’s outline. She felther spirits lift; maybe they were going to catch up with him.Then, abruptly, the auras vanished.She stopped, confused and frightened. What had happened? Looking back down thealley, she could see the traces of their auras in the air, gold and yellow—Joshand Dee, side by side—Machiavelli’s gray following along behind. They reachedthe center of the alleyway and stopped, and she could distinctly see the outlineof her brother’s body picked out in gold standing almost directly in front ofher. Squinting, concentrating hard, she attempted to bring his aura into focus….He was looking down, mouth open.Sophie stepped back. Directly under her feet was a large manhole cover, with theletters IDC pressed into the metal. Tiny speckles of the three auras werestreaked across the cover, outlining each letter in a different color.“Sophie?” Nicholas began.She felt a rush of excitement: relief that she hadn’t lost him. “They’ve gonedown,” she said.“Down?” he asked, turning a sickly pale color. His voice dropped to little morethan a whisper. “Are you sure?”“Positive,” she said, alarmed at the expression on his face. “Why, what’s wrong?What’s down there? Sewers?”“Sewers…and worse.” The Alchemyst suddenly looked very old and tired. “Below usare the legendary Catacombs of Paris,” he whispered.Joan crouched down and pointed to where the mud around the edge of the manholecover was disturbed. “This was opened very recently.” She looked up, herexpression grim. “You’re right; they’ve taken him down into the Empire of theDead.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE“Oh, stop that!” Perenelle bashed the spider Elder on the top of the head withthe flat side of the spear in her hand. The ancient symbol of power blazedwhite-hot and the spider darted back into the cell, the top of its skullsizzling, gray smoke curling upward.“That hurt!” Areop-Enap snapped, more irritated than wounded. “You’re alwayshurting me. You nearly killed me the last time I saw you.”“And let me remind you that the last time we met, your followers attempted tosacrifice me to activate an extinct volcano. Naturally, I was a little upset.”“You brought down an entire mountain on top of me,” Areop-Enap said in apeculiar lisp caused by its overlong fangs. “You could have killed me.”“It was only a small mountain,” Perenelle reminded the creature. She thoughtAreop-Enap was female but couldn’t be entirely sure. “You’ve survived worse.”All of Areop-Enap’s eyes were on the spear in Perenelle’s hand. “Can you atleast tell me where I am?”“On Alcatraz. Or rather, below Alcatraz, an island in the San Francisco Bay onthe West Coast of the Americas.”“The New World?” Areop-Enap asked.“Yes, the New World,” Perenelle said, smiling. The reclusive spider Elder oftenhibernated for centuries and missed huge chunks of human history.“What are you doing here?” Areop-Enap asked.“I am a prisoner—like you.” She stepped back. “If I lower the spear, are yougoing to do something stupid?”“Like what?”“Like jump at me.”All the hairs on Areop-Enap’s legs rose and fell in unison. “Truce?” the spiderElder suggested.Perenelle nodded. “Truce,” she agreed. “It seems we have a common enemy.”Areop-Enap moved to the door of the cell. “Do you know how I got here?”“I was rather hoping you would be able to tell me that,” Perenelle said.Keeping several wary eyes on the glowing spear, the spider took a tentative stepout into the corridor. “The last place I remember was Igup Island. It’s part ofPolynesia,” it added.“Micronesia,” Perenelle said. “The name changed more than one hundred and fiftyyears ago. Just how long have you been asleep, Old Spider?” she asked, callingthe creature by its common name.“I’m not sure…when did we last meet and have our little misunderstanding? Inhumani years, Sorceress,” it added.“When Nicholas and I were on Pohnpei investigating the ruins of Nan Madol,”Perenelle said immediately. She had an almost perfect memory. “That was abouttwo hundred years ago,” she added.“I probably took a nap sometime about then,” Areop-Enap said, stepping out intothe corridor. Behind it, the cell came alive with millions of spiders. “Iremember waking from a very nice nap,” it said slowly. “I saw the MagicianDee…but he was not alone. There was someone else—something else—with him.Instructing him.”“Who?” Perenelle asked urgently. “Try and remember, Old Spider, this isimportant.”Areop-Enap closed each of its eyes as it tried to recall what had happened.“Something is preventing me,” it said, all its eyes opening simultaneously.“Something powerful. Whoever was with him was protected by an extraordinarilypowerful magical shield.” Areop-Enap looked up and down the corridor. “Thatway?” it asked.“This way.” Perenelle pointed with the spear. Even though Areop-Enap had calleda truce, Perenelle was not prepared to stand unarmed before one of the mostpowerful of the Elders. “I wonder why he wanted you prisoner.” A sudden thoughtstruck her and she stopped so quickly that Areop-Enap brushed against her,almost sending her face-first onto the muddy floor. “If you had to make achoice, Old Spider, if you had to choose between returning the Elders to thisworld or leaving it in the hands of the humani, who would you choose?”“Sorceress,” Areop-Enap said, mouth gaping to reveal its terrifying teeth inwhat might have been a smile, “I was one of the Elders who voted that we shouldleave the earth to the ape-kin. I recognized that our time on this planet wasover; and in our arrogance we had almost destroyed it. It was time to step backand leave it to the humani.”“So you would not be in favor of the return of the Elders?”“No.”“And if there was a fight, who would you stand with—the Elders or the humani?”“Sorceress,” Areop-Enap said very seriously, “I’ve stood with the humani before.Along with my kin, Hekate and the Witch of Endor, I helped bring civilization tothis planet. Despite my appearance, my loyalties are with the humani.”“And that’s why Dee had to capture you now. He couldn’t afford to have someoneas powerful as you fight alongside humankind.”“Then the confrontation must be very close indeed,” Areop-Enap said. “Butthere’s nothing Dee and the Dark Elders can do until they secure the Book of…”Areop-Enap’s voice trailed away. “They’ve got the Book?”“Most of it,” Perenelle confirmed miserably. “And you should know the rest ofit. You are familiar with the prophecy of the twins?”“Of course. That old fool, Abraham, was always twittering on about the twins andscribbling down his indecipherable prophecies in the Codex. I never believed aword of them myself. And in all the years I knew him, he never got a singlething right.”“Nicholas found the twins.”“Ah.” Areop-Enap was silent for a moment, then shrugged what shoulders it had,eyes blinking in unison. “So Abraham was right about something; well, that’s afirst.”While Perenelle slogged through ankle-deep mud, recounting what she haddiscovered in the cells above, she noticed that despite its enormous size, thespider Elder glided over the top of the muck. Behind them, the walls andceilings pulsed with millions of spiders as they followed the Elder. “I wonderwhy Dee didn’t kill you.”“He couldn’t,” Areop-Enap said matter-of-factly. “My death would send ripplesthrough myriad Shadowrealms. Unlike Hekate, I have friends, and too many of themwould come to investigate. Dee would not want that.” Areop-Enap stopped when itcame to the first of the spears Perenelle had pushed down. A huge leg turned itover, and the spider examined the faint traces of the hieroglyph painted on thespearhead. “I’m curious,” it lisped. “These Words of Power. They were ancientwhen the Elders ruled the earth. And I thought we had destroyed both them andall record of them. How did the English Magician rediscover them?”“I was wondering the same thing,” Perenelle said. She turned the spear in herhand to look at the single square hieroglyph. “Maybe he copied the spell fromsomewhere.”“No,” Areop-Enap said. “The individual words are powerful, it is true, but Deeset them up in the particular pattern that kept me trapped in the cell. Everytime I tried to escape, it was as if I ran into a solid wall. I’ve seen thatpattern before, but it was in the days before the Fall of Danu Talis. In fact,now that I think of it, the last time I saw that pattern was before we had evencreated the island continent and dragged it up from the ocean floor. Someoneinstructed Dee; someone knew how to create these magical Wards, someone who’dseen them.”“No one knows who Dee’s Elder is, whom he serves,” Perenelle said thoughtfully.“Nicholas spent decades vainly trying to discover who, ultimately, controls theMagician.”“Someone old,” Areop-Enap said. “As old as me, or even older. One of the GreatElders, perhaps.” All of the spider Elder’s eyes blinked. “But it cannot be;none of them survived the Fall of Danu Talis.”“You did.”“I’m not one of the Great Elders,” Areop-Enap said simply.They reached the end of the tunnel and de Ayala winked into existence directlybefore them. He had been a ghost for centuries and had seen wonders andmonsters, but he had never seen anything like Areop-Enap, and the sight of theenormous creature shocked him speechless.“Juan,” Perenelle said gently. “Talk to me.”“The Crow Goddess is here,” he said finally. “She is almost directly above us,perched on top of the water tower like a huge vulture. She’s waiting for you toclimb out. She had an argument with the sphinx,” the ghost added. “The sphinxsaid that the Elders had given you to her; the Morrigan claimed that Dee saidyou were hers.”“So nice to be in demand,” Perenelle said, looking up the length of the shaftinto the darkness. She glanced sidelong at Areop-Enap. “I wonder if she knowsyou’re here.”“Unlikely,” Old Spider said. “Dee would have no reason for telling her, and withso many magical and mythical creatures on the island, she’ll not be able to pickout my aura.”Perenelle’s lips twisted in a quick smile that lit up her face. “Shall wesurprise her?”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FORTY-SIXJosh Newman stopped and swallowed hard. Any moment now, he was going to throwup. Although it was cool and damp underground, he was sweating, his hairplastered to his skull, his shirt lying icy and clinging along the length of hisspine. He had gone beyond frightened, past terrified and straight to petrified.Descending into the sewers had been bad enough. Dee had wrenched the manholecover out of the ground without any effort, and they’d jerked back as a plume offilthy, foul-smelling gas vented into the street. When it had drifted away, Deehad slipped into the opening, followed a moment later by Josh and finallyMachiavelli. They’d climbed down a short metal ladder and ended up standing in atunnel that was so narrow they had to march single file and so low that only Deecould walk upright. The tunnel dipped, and Josh gasped as ice-cold watersuddenly flooded his sneakers. The smell was appalling, and he desperately triednot to think about what he might be wading through.The rotten-egg stink of sulfur briefly masked the smells in the sewer as Deecreated a globe of cold blue-white light. It hovered and danced in the air abouttwelve inches in front of the Magician, painting the interior of the narrowarched tunnel in stark ashen light and deep impenetrable shadows. As theysloshed forward, Josh could hear things moving and glimpsed sparkling points ofred light shifting in the blackness. He hoped they were only rats.“I don’t…,” Josh began, his voice echoing distortedly in the narrow tunnel. “Ireally don’t like small spaces.”“Neither do I,” Machiavelli added tightly. “I spent a little time in prison, along time ago. I’ve never forgotten it.”“Was it as bad as this?” Josh asked shakily.“Worse.” Machiavelli was walking behind Josh and he leaned forward to add, “Tryand stay calm. This is just a maintenance tunnel; we’ll get into the propersewers in a few moments.”Josh took a deep breath and gagged on the smell. He had to remember to breatheonly through his mouth. “And how is that going to help?” he muttered throughclenched teeth.“The sewers of Paris are mirrors of the streets above,” Machiavelli explained,his breath warm against Josh’s ear. “The bigger sewers are fifteen feet high.”Machiavelli was correct; moments later they came out of the cramped andclaustrophobic service tunnel into a tall arched sewer wide enough to drive acar through. The high brick walls were brightly lit and lined with black pipesof various thicknesses. Somewhere in the distance, water splashed and gurgled.Josh felt the claustrophobia ease a little. Sophie sometimes got scared inwide-open spaces; he was afraid of tightly enclosed spots. Agoraphobia andclaustrophobia. He took a deep breath; the air was still tainted with effluent,but at least it was breathable. He lifted the front of his black T-shirt tocover his face and breathed in: it stank. When he got out of here—if he got outof here—he’d have to burn everything, including the fancy designer jeansSaint-Germain had given him. He quickly dropped the shirt, realizing that he’dnearly exposed the bag he wore on the cord around his neck containing the pagesfrom the Codex. No matter what happened now, he was determined that he wasn’tgoing to give up the pages to Dee, not until he was sure—very, very, verysure—that the Magician’s motives were honest.“Where are we?” he wondered aloud, looking back at Machiavelli. Dee had walkedout into the center of the sewer, the solid white ball now spinning just abovethe palm of his outstretched hand.The tall Italian glanced around. “I’ve no idea,” he admitted. “There are abouttwenty-one hundred kilometers of sewers—around thirteen hundred miles,” heamended, seeing the blank look on Josh’s face. “But don’t worry, we’ll not getlost. Most have their own street signs.”“Street signs in the sewers?”“The sewers of Paris are one of the great wonders of this city.” Machiavellismiled.“Come!” Dee’s voice cracked out, echoing in the chamber.“Do you know where we’re going?” Josh asked quietly. He knew from experiencethat he needed to keep distracted; once he started thinking about the narrownessof the tunnels and the weight of the earth above him, his claustrophobia wouldreduce him to a wreck.“We’re going down, into the deepest, oldest part of the catacombs. You’re goingto be Awakened.”“Do you know who we’re going to see?”Machiavelli’s usually impassive face twitched in a grimace. “Yes. By reputationonly. I’ve never seen it.” He lowered his voice to little more than a whisperand caught Josh’s sleeve, pulling him back. “It’s not too late to turn back,” hesaid.Josh blinked in surprise. “Dee wouldn’t like that.”“Probably not,” Machiavelli agreed with a wry smile.Josh was puzzled. Dee had said Machiavelli wasn’t his friend, and it had beenobvious that the two men didn’t agree. “But I thought you and Dee were on thesame side.”“We are both in the service of the Elders, it is true…but I have never approvedof the English Magician and his methods.”Ahead of them, Dee turned into a smaller tunnel and stopped before a narrowmetal door that was secured by a thick padlock. He pinched through the hasp ofthe metal lock with fingernails that stank of foul yellow power and pulled openthe door. “Hurry,” he called back impatiently.“This…this person we’re going to see,” Josh said slowly, “can they really Awakenmy powers?”“I have no doubt about it,” Machiavelli said softly. “Is the Awakening soimportant to you?” he asked, and Josh was aware that Machiavelli was watchinghim closely.“My sister was Awakened—my twin sister,” he explained slowly. “I want…I need tohave my powers Awakened so we’re alike again.” He looked at the tallwhite-haired man. “Does that make sense?”Machiavelli nodded, his face an unreadable mask. “But is that the only reason,Josh?”The boy looked at him for a long moment before he turned away. Machiavelli wasright; it wasn’t the only reason. When he’d held Clarent, he’d brieflyexperienced a hint of what it must be like to have Awakened senses. For a fewmoments, he’d felt truly alive, he’d felt complete…and more than anything else,he wanted to experience that feeling again. Dee led them into another tunnel, which was, if anything, even narrower than thefirst. Josh felt his stomach clench and his heart start to thump. The tunnelturned and twisted downward in a series of slender stairs. The stones here wereolder, the steps irregularly shaped, the walls soft and crumbling as theybrushed past. In some places it was so narrow that Josh had to turn sideways toslip through. He got stuck in a particularly confined corner and immediatelystarted to feel breathless panic bubbling in his chest. Then Dee caught one armand unceremoniously yanked him through, tearing a long strip off the back of hisT-shirt. “Nearly there,” the Magician muttered. He raised his arm slightly andthe bobbing ball of silver light rose higher into the air, revealing thetunnel’s pitted brickwork.“Hang on a second; let me catch my breath.” Josh bent over, hands on his knees,breathing deeply. He realized that as long as he concentrated on the ball oflight and didn’t think about the walls and ceiling closing in on him, he was OK.“How do you know where we’re going?” he panted. “Have you been here before?”“I was here once before…a long time ago,” Dee said with a grin. “Right now, I’mjust following the light.” The harsh white light turned the Magician’s smileinto something terrifying.Josh remembered a trick his football coach had taught him. He wrapped his handsaround his stomach and squeezed hard as he breathed in and straightened up. Thefeeling of queasiness immediately eased. “Who are we going to see?” he asked.“Patience, humani, patience.” Dee looked past Josh to where Machiavelli wasstanding. “I’m sure our Italian friend will agree. One of the great advantagesof immortality is that one learns patience. There is a saying: ‘good things cometo those who wait.’”“Not always good things,” Machiavelli muttered as Dee turned away.At the end of the narrow tunnel was a low metal door. It looked as if it hadn’tbeen opened in decades and had rusted solid into the weeping limestone wall. Inthe white light, Josh saw that the rust had stained the off-white stone thecolor of dried blood.The ball of light bobbed in the air while Dee ran his glowing yellow fingernailaround the edge of the door, cutting it out of the frame, the stink of rotteneggs blanketing the odor of sewage.“What’s through here?” Josh asked. Now that he’d started to get his fear undercontrol, he was beginning to feel a little excitement. Once he was Awakened,he’d slip away and get back to Sophie. He turned to look at Machiavelli, but theItalian shook his head and pointed to Dee. “Dr. Dee?” Josh asked.Dee broke open the low door and jerked it out of its frame. Soft stone crumbledand flaked away around it. “If I am correct—and I almost always am,” theMagician added, “then this will lead us into the Catacombs of Paris.” Dee leanedthe door against the wall and then stepped through the opening.Josh ducked to follow him. “I’ve never heard of them.”“Few people outside Paris have,” Machiavelli said, “and yet, along with thesewers, they are one of the marvels of this city. Over a hundred seventy milesof mysterious and labyrinthine tunnels. The catacombs were once limestonequarries. And now they are filled…”Josh stepped through the opening, straightened up and looked around.“…with bones.”The boy felt something twist in the pit of his stomach and he swallowed hard, asour and bitter taste at the back of his throat. Directly ahead, as far as hecould see in the gloomy tunnel, the walls, the curved ceiling and even the floorwere composed of polished human bones."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FORTY-SEVENNicholas had just levered up the manhole cover when Joan’s phone rang, thehigh-pitched warbling scale making them all jump with fright. The Alchemystdropped the cover back into place with a clang, dancing back before it fell onhis toes.“It’s Francis,” Joan told them, flipping open the phone. She spoke toSaint-Germain in rapid-fire French and then snapped the cell closed. “He’s onhis way,” she said. “He said that on no account are we to go down into thecatacombs without him.”“But we can’t wait,” Sophie protested.“Sophie’s right. We should—” Nicholas started to say.“We wait,” Joan said firmly in the voice that had once commanded armies. Sheplaced her tiny foot on the manhole cover.“They’ll get away,” Sophie said desperately.“Francis said he knows where they’re going,” Joan said very softly. She turnedto look at the Alchemyst. “He said you do too. Do you?” she demanded.Nicholas took a deep breath and then nodded grimly. The early-morning lightwashed all the life from his face, leaving it the color of faded parchment. Thecircles beneath his eyes were bruise dark and baggy. “I believe so.”“Where?” Sophie asked. She tried to stay calm. She’d always been better atcontrolling her temper than her brother was, but right now she was close tothrowing back her head and screaming in frustration. If the Alchemyst knew whereJosh was going, why weren’t they heading there now?“Dee is taking Josh to have his powers Awakened,” Flamel said slowly, obviouslychoosing his words with care.Sophie frowned, confused. “Is that so bad? Isn’t that what we wanted?”“Yes, it’s what we wanted, but not how we wanted it.” Although his face wasexpressionless, there was pain in his eyes. “Much depends on who—or what—Awakensa person’s powers. It is a dangerous process. It can even be deadly.”Sophie slowly turned to look at him. “And yet you were willing to allow Hekateto Awaken both Josh and me.” Her brother had been right all along: Flamel hadput them both in danger. She could see that now.“It was necessary for your own protection. There were dangers, yes, but neitherof you was in any danger from the Goddess herself.”“What sort of dangers?”“Most of the Elders were never generous toward what they called humani. Very fewof them were prepared to give without attaching some sort of conditions,” Flamelexplained. “The greatest gift the Elders can bestow is that of immortality.Humans want to live forever. Both Dee and Machiavelli are in service to theirDark Elders who gifted them with immortality.”“In service?” Sophie asked, looking from the Alchemyst to Joan.“They are servants,” Joan said gently, “some would say slaves. It is the priceof their immortality and powers.”Joan’s phone rang again with the same ring tone and she flipped it open.“François?”“Sophie,” Flamel continued quietly, “the gift of immortality can be withdrawnfrom a person at any time, and if that happens then all of their unnatural yearswill catch up with them in a matter of moments. Some Elders enslave the humanithey Awaken, turn them into little better than zombies.”“But Hekate didn’t make me immortal when she Awakened me,” Sophie argued.“Unlike the Witch of Endor, Hekate had no interest in humani for countlessgenerations. She always remained neutral in the wars between those of us whodefend humanity and the Dark Elders.” A bitter smile twisted his thin lips.“Perhaps if she had chosen a side, she would still be alive today.”Sophie looked into the Alchemyst’s pale eyes. She was thinking that if Flamelhad not gone into Hekate’s Shadowrealm, the Elder would still be alive. “You’resaying Josh is in danger,” she said finally.“Terrible danger.”Sophie’s gaze never left Flamel’s face. Josh was in danger not because of Dee orMachiavelli, but because Nicholas Flamel has placed the two of them in thisterrible situation. He was protecting them, he said, and once she had believedthat without question. But now…now she didn’t know what to think.“Come.” Joan snapped her phone shut, caught Sophie’s hand and dragged her downthe alleyway toward the street. “Francis is on the way.”Flamel took one final look at the manhole cover, then tucked Clarent under hiscoat and hurried after them.Joan led them out of the narrow side street onto the Avenue du President Wilson,then quickly turned left onto Rue Debrousse and headed back toward the river.The air was filled with the sounds of countless police and ambulance sirens, andin the skies overhead police helicopters buzzed low over the city. The streetswere almost completely empty, and no one paid any attention to three peoplerunning for shelter.Sophie shivered; the whole scene was so surreal. It was like something she’d seein a war documentary on the Discovery Channel.At the bottom of the Rue Debrousse, they found Saint-Germain waiting in anondescript black BMW badly in need of washing. The front and rear passengerdoors were open slightly, and the tinted driver’s window hummed down as theyapproached. Saint-Germain was grinning delightedly. “Nicholas, you should comehome more often; the city is in chaos. It’s all terribly exciting. I’ve not hadso much fun in centuries.”Joan slid in beside her husband, while Nicholas and Sophie climbed into theback. Saint-Germain gunned the engine, but Nicholas leaned forward and squeezedhis shoulder.“Not so fast. We don’t need to draw any attention to ourselves,” he warned.“But with the panic on the streets, we shouldn’t be driving slowly, either,”Saint-Germain pointed out. He eased the car away from the curb and set off downthe Avenue de New York. He drove with one hand on the steering wheel, the otherdraped over the seat as he kept twisting around to talk to the Alchemyst.Completely numb, Sophie slumped against the window, staring out at the riverflashing by on her left. In the distance, on the opposite side of the Seine, shecould make out the now familiar shape of the Eiffel Tower rising over therooftops. She was exhausted and her head was spinning. She was confused aboutthe Alchemyst. Nicholas couldn’t be bad, could he? Saint-Germain andJoan—Scatty, too—obviously respected him. Even Hekate and the Witch liked him.Flickering thoughts that she knew were not hers hovered at the very edge of herconsciousness, but when she tried to focus, they drifted away. They were theWitch of Endor’s memories, and she knew instinctively that they were important.They were something to do with the catacombs, and the creature who lived in thedepths….“Officially, the police are reporting that a portion of the catacombs has cavedin and brought down some houses with it,” Saint-Germain was saying. “They’reclaiming that the sewers have ruptured and that methane, carbon dioxide andcarbon monoxide gas have escaped into the city. The center of Paris is beingsealed off and evacuated. People are being advised to remain indoors.”Nicholas leaned back against the leather seats and closed his eyes. “Has anyonebeen injured?” he asked.“A few cuts and bruises, but nothing more serious has been reported.”Joan shook her head in amazement. “Considering what’s just tromped through thecity, that’s a minor miracle.”“Any sightings of Nidhogg?” Nicholas asked.“Not on any of the main news channels yet, but some grainy cell phone imageshave turned up on blogs, and Le Monde and Le Figaro are both claiming to haveexclusive images of what they are calling ‘The Creature from the Catacombs’ and‘The Beast from the Pit.’”Sophie leaned forward, following the conversation. She looked from Nicholas toSaint-Germain and then back at the Alchemyst. “Soon the whole world will knowthe truth. What happens then?”“Nothing,” the two men said simultaneously.“Nothing? But that’s not possible.”Joan swiveled around in the passenger seat. “But that is what is going tohappen. This will be covered up.”Sophie looked at Flamel. He nodded in agreement. “Most people simply won’tbelieve it anyway, Sophie. It will be dismissed as a hoax or a prank. Those whodo think it true will be called conspiracy theorists. And you can be sure thatMachiavelli’s people are already working to confiscate and destroy every image.”“Within a couple of hours,” Saint-Germain added, “the events of this morningwill simply be reported as an unfortunate accident. Sightings of a monster willbe laughed at and dismissed as hysteria.”Sophie shook her head in disbelief. “You can’t hide something like thatforever.”“The Elders have been doing it for millennia,” Saint-Germain said, tilting therearview mirror so that he could look at Sophie. In the dark interior of thecar, she thought his bright blue eyes were glowing slightly. “And you have toremember that humankind really does not want to believe in magic. They don’twant to know that myths and legends were almost always based on the truth.”Joan reached over and laid her hand gently on her husband’s arm. “But I do notagree; humans have always believed in magic. It is only in these last fewcenturies that the belief has fallen away. I think that they really want tobelieve, because in their hearts they know it to be true. They know that magicreally exists.”“I used to believe in magic,” Sophie said very quietly. She had turned to lookout at the city again, but reflected in the glass, she saw a brightly paintedchild’s bedroom: her bedroom, five, perhaps six years ago. She had no idea whereit was—the house in Scottsdale, maybe, or it might have been Raleigh; they’dmoved around so much then. She was sitting in the middle of her bed, surroundedby her favorite books. “When I was younger, I read about princesses and wizardsand knights and magicians. Even though I knew they were just stories, I wantedthe magic to be real. Until now,” she added bitterly. She moved her head toglance at the Alchemyst. “Are all the fairy tales true?”Flamel nodded. “Not every fairy tale, but just about every legend is based on atruth; every myth has a basis in reality.”“Even the scary ones?” she whispered.“Especially the scary ones.”A trio of news helicopters buzzed low overhead, the noise of their rotorsvibrating the interior of the car. Flamel waited until they had passed and thenleaned forward. “Where are we going?”Saint-Germain pointed straight ahead and to the right. “There’s a secretentrance to the catacombs in the Trocadéro Gardens. It leads straight down intothe forbidden tunnels. I’ve checked the old maps; I think Dee’s route will takethem through the sewers first and then down into the lower tunnels. We’ll makeup some time this way.”Nicholas Flamel sat back in the seat and then reached over and squeezed Sophie’shand. “It’s going to be all right,” he said.But Sophie didn’t believe him. The entrance to the catacombs was through a rather ordinary-looking metal grateset into the ground. Partially covered in moss and grass, it was hidden in astand of trees behind a richly carved and beautifully painted carousel at oneend of the Trocadéro Gardens. Usually, the stunning gardens would have beenoverrun with tourists, but this morning they were deserted, and the carousel’sempty wooden horses bobbed up and down below their blue and white stripedawning.Saint-Germain cut across a narrow path and led them into a patch of grass burnedbrown by the summer sun. He stopped over an unmarked rectangular metal grate. “Ihaven’t used this since 1941.” He knelt down, grabbed the bars and tugged. Itdidn’t move.Joan glanced sidelong at Sophie. “When Francis and I fought with the FrenchResistance against the Germans, we used the catacombs as a base. We could pop upanywhere in the city.” She tapped the metal grate with the toe of her shoe.“This was one of our favorite spots. Even during the war the gardens were alwaysfull of people, and we could mingle easily with the crowds.”The air was suddenly touched with the rich autumnal scent of burnt leaves, andthen the metal bars in Francis’s hands began to glow with a rich red-hot, thenwhite-hot, heat. The metal turned to liquid and melted away, thick blobsdisappearing down into the shaft. Saint-Germain wrenched the remainder of thegrating out of the hole and tossed it to one side, then swung himself into theopening. “There’s a ladder here.”“Sophie, you go next,” Nicholas said. “I’ll come after you. Joan, will you takeup the rear?”Joan nodded. She caught the edge of a nearby wooden park bench and dragged itacross the grass. “I’ll pull it over the opening before I climb down. We don’twant any unexpected visitors dropping in, do we?” She smiled.Sophie gingerly climbed into the opening, her feet finding the rungs of theladder. She carefully lowered herself. She’d been expecting it to be foul andhorrible, but it just smelled dry and musty. She started counting the steps butlost count somewhere around seventy-two, though she could tell by the rapidlydiminishing square of sky above their heads that they were climbing deepunderground. She wasn’t scared—not for herself. Tunnels and narrow spaces heldno fears for her, but her brother was terrified of small spaces: how was hefeeling now? Butterflies shifted in her stomach; she felt queasy. Her mouth wentdry and she knew—instinctively, unquestioningly—that this was how her brotherwas feeling right at that moment. She knew that Josh was terrified."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT“Bones,” Josh said numbly, looking up and down the tunnel.The wall directly before him was created from hundreds of stained-yellow andbleached-white skulls. Dee strode down the corridor and his sphere of light sentshadows dancing and twitching, making it appear as if the empty eye sockets weremoving, following him.Josh had grown up with bones; he knew they were nothing to be frightened of. Hisfather’s study was full of skeletons. As children, both he and Sophie had playedin museum storerooms full of skeletal remains, but they had all been animal anddinosaur bones. Josh had even helped piece together the tailbone of a raptorthat had gone on display in the American Museum of Natural History. But thesebones…these were…these were…“Are these all human bones?” he whispered.“Yes,” Machiavelli said softly, his voice now touched with a trace of hisItalian accent. “There are the remains of at least six million bodies down here.Maybe more. The catacombs were originally huge limestone quarries.” He jerkedhis thumb upward. “The same limestone used to build the city. Paris is builtover a warren of tunnels.”“How did they get down here?” Josh’s voice trembled. He coughed, wrapped hisarms tightly around his body and tried to look nonchalant, as if he weren’tcompletely terrified. “They look ancient; how long have they been here?”“A couple of hundred years only,” Machiavelli said, surprising him. “By the endof the eighteenth century, the graveyards of Paris were overflowing. I was inthe city then,” he added, mouth twisting in disgust. “I’d never seen anythinglike it. There were so many dead in the city that the graveyards were often justhuge mounds of piled earth with bones visible in them. Paris might have been oneof the most beautiful cities in the world, but it was also the foulest. Worsethan London—and that’s saying something!” He laughed, and the sound echoed andreechoed off the bone walls and was distorted into something hideous. “The stinkwas indescribable, and there truly were rats as big as dogs. Disease was rifeand outbreaks of plague were common. Finally, it was recognized that theoverflowing graveyards must have something to do with the contagion. So it wasdecided to empty the graveyards and move the remains down into the emptyquarries.”Trying not to think about the fact that he was surrounded by the bones of peoplewho had most likely died from some terrible disease, Josh focused on the walls.“Who made the patterns?” he asked, pointing to a particularly ornate sunburstdesign that had been created using human bones of various length to representthe sunbeams.Machiavelli shrugged. “Who knows? Someone who wished to honor the dead, perhaps;someone trying to make sense out of what must have been incredible chaos. Humansare always looking to make order out of chaos,” he added softly.Josh looked at him. “You call them…us, ‘humans.’” He turned to look for Dee, butthe Magician had almost reached the end of the corridor and was out of earshot.“Dee calls us humani.”“Don’t confuse me with Dee,” Machiavelli said with an icy smile.Josh was confused. Who was the more powerful here—Dee or Machiavelli? He’dthought it was the Magician, but he was beginning to suspect that the Italianwas much more in control. “Scathach told us you were more dangerous and morecunning than Dee,” he said, thinking aloud.Machiavelli’s smile turned to a delighted grin. “That’s the nicest thing she’sever said about me.”“Is it true? Are you more dangerous than Dee?”Machiavelli took a moment to consider. Then he smiled and the faintest hint ofserpent filled the tunnel. “Absolutely.”“Hurry; this way,” Dr. Dee called back, voice flattened by the narrow walls andlow ceiling. He turned and headed off down the bone-lined tunnel, taking thelight with him. Josh was tempted to run after him, unwilling to be alone in theutter darkness, but then Machiavelli snapped his fingers and an elegantcandle-thin flame of gray-white light appeared in the palm of his hand.“Not all the tunnels are like this,” Machiavelli continued, indicating theneatly set bones in the walls, the regular shapes and patterns. “Some of thesmall tunnels are simply piled high with assorted bits and pieces.”They rounded a curve in the tunnel and found Dee waiting for them, tapping hisfoot impatiently. He turned and marched away without saying a word.Josh concentrated on Dee’s back and the globe of light bobbing over his shoulderas they wound deeper and deeper into the catacombs; doing that helped him toignore the walls that seemed to be closing in with every step. He noticed as hewalked along that some of the bones lining the tunnel had dates scratched onthem, centuries-old graffiti, and he was conscious too that the only footstepsin the thick layer of dust on the floor were the imprints of Dee’s small feet.These tunnels had not been used in a very long time.“Do people ever come down here?” he asked Machiavelli, making conversation justfor the sake of hearing a sound in the oppressive silence.“Yes. Portions of the catacombs are open to the public,” Machiavelli said,holding his hand high, the thin flame picking out the ornate patterns of bonesset in the walls, dancing shadows bringing them to flickering life. “But thereare many kilometers of catacombs beneath the city, and vast tracts of it havenot been mapped. Exploring those tunnels is dangerous and illegal, of course,but people still do it. Those people are called cataphiles. There’s even aspecial police unit, the cataflics, that patrols these tunnels.” Machiavelliwaved an arm at the surrounding walls, the flame dancing wildly but notextinguishing. “But we’ll run into neither group down here. This area iscompletely unknown. We are deep below the city now, in one of the very firstquarries excavated many centuries ago.”“Deep below the city,” Josh repeated slowly. He hunched his shoulders, imagininghe could actually feel the weight of Paris over his head, the many tons ofearth, concrete and steel pressing down on him. Claustrophobia threatened tooverwhelm him, and he felt as if the walls were throbbing, pulsing. His throatwas dry, his lips cracked, and his tongue felt too big in his mouth. “I think,”he whispered to Machiavelli, “I think I’d like to head back up to the surfacenow, if that’s OK.”The Italian blinked in genuine surprise. “No, Josh, no, it’s not OK.”Machiavelli reached out and squeezed Josh’s shoulder and the boy felt a rush ofwarmth flow through his body. His aura crackled, and the close air in the tunnelwas touched with the scent of orange and the rank odor of snake. “It’s too latefor that,” Machiavelli said gently. He lowered his voice to a whisper. “We’vegone too deep…there’s no turning back. You will leave these catacombs Awakenedor…”“Or what?” Josh asked, when he realized, with a growing sense of horror, how theItalian was going to finish the sentence.“Or you will not leave them at all,” Machiavelli said simply.They rounded a curve and started down a long arrow-straight tunnel. The wallshere were even more ornately decorated in bone but with strange square patternsthat Josh almost recognized. They were similar to drawings he’d seen in hisfather’s study and looked like Maya or Aztec glyphs; but what were Meso-Americanhieroglyphs doing in the Catacombs of Paris?Dee was waiting for them at the end of the tunnel. His gray eyes sparkled in thereflected light, which also lent his skin an unhealthy glow. When he spoke, hisEnglish accent had thickened, and the words tumbled so quickly it was difficultto comprehend what he was saying. Josh couldn’t tell if the Magician was excitedor nervous, and that made him even more afraid.“This is now a momentous day for you, boy, a momentous day. For not only willyour powers be Awakened, but you will also meet one of the few Elders who isstill remembered by humanity. It is a great honor.” He clapped his handstogether. Ducking his head, he raised his hand, bringing up the globe of light,and revealed two tall arched columns of bones that had been shaped to form adoorframe. Beyond the opening, there was utter blackness. Stepping back, hedirected, “You first.”Josh hesitated and Machiavelli caught his arm and squeezed tightly. When hespoke, his voice was low and urgent. “Whatever happens, you must not show fear,and do not panic. Your life, your very sanity, depends on it. Do youunderstand?”“No fear, no panic,” Josh repeated. He was starting to hyperventilate. “No fear,no panic.”“Go now.” Machiavelli released the boy’s arm and pushed him forward toward Deeand the bone doorway. “Have your powers Awakened,” he said, “and I hope it willbe worth it.”Something in Machiavelli’s voice made Josh look back. There was a look almost ofpity on the Italian’s face, and Josh stopped. Dee looked at him, gray eyesglittering, lips twisted in an ugly smile. He raised his eyebrows. “Don’t youwant to be Awakened?”And Josh really had only one answer to that.Glancing back at Machiavelli again, he half raised a hand in farewell, took adeep breath and stepped through the arched doorway into the pitch-black. Lightblossomed as Dee followed him, and the boy discovered that he was standing in avast circular chamber that seemed to be carved entirely out of one enormousbone—the smoothly curved walls, the polished yellow ceiling, even theparchment-colored floor were the same shade and texture as the bone-filled wallsoutside.Dee put his hand on the small of Josh’s back and urged him forward. Josh tooktwo steps and stopped. The past few days had taught him to expectsurprises—wonders, creatures and monsters: but this, this was…disappointing.The chamber was empty except for a long rectangular raised stone plinth in thecenter of the room. Dee’s globe of light bobbed over the platform, harshlyilluminating every carved detail. Lying flat on the top of a pitted slab oflimestone was a huge statue of a man in ancient-looking metal and leather armor,gauntleted hands wrapped around the thick hilt of a broadsword that was at leastsix feet long. Rising up on his toes, Josh could see that the statue’s head wascovered in a helmet that completely concealed the face.Josh looked around. Dee was standing to the right of the doorway and Machiavellihad stepped into the room and taken up a position on the left. They were bothwatching him intently. “What…what happens now?” he asked, his voice flat andmuffled in the chamber.Neither man responded. Machiavelli folded his arms and tilted his head slightlyto one side, eyes narrowing.“Who’s this?” Josh asked, jerking a thumb at the statue. He didn’t expect to getan answer from Dee, but when he turned to the Italian he realized thatMachiavelli wasn’t looking at him, he was looking beyond him. Josh spunaround…just as two nightmarish creatures materialized out of the shadows.Everything about them was white, from their almost transparent skin to the longfine hair that flowed down their backs and brushed the floor behind them. It wasimpossible to say whether they were male or female. They were the size of smallchildren, unnaturally thin, with bulbous heads, broad foreheads and pointedchins. Overlarge ears and tiny nubs of horn grew out of the top of their skulls.Huge circular eyes without any pupils fixed on him, and when the creaturesstepped forward, he realized that there was something wrong with their legs.Their thighs curved backward, and then the legs jutted forward at the knee andended in goatlike hooves.They separated as they came around the slab, and Josh’s instinct was to backaway from them, but then he remembered Machiavelli’s advice and stood hisground. Taking a deep breath, he looked closely at the nearer creature anddiscovered that it was not quite as terrifying as it looked at first: it was sosmall it appeared almost fragile. He thought he knew what they were; he’d seenimages of them on fragments of Greek and Roman pottery on the bookshelves in hismom’s study. They were fauns, or maybe satyrs; he wasn’t sure what thedifference was.The creatures slowly circled Josh, reaching for him with icy long-fingered handstipped with filthy black nails, stroking his torn T-shirt, pinching the fabricof his jeans. They spoke together, chattering in high-pitched, almost inaudiblevoices that set his teeth on edge. One bone-chilling finger touched the flesh ofhis stomach and his aura spat and crackled gold sparks. “Hey!” he shouted. Thecreatures jumped back, but that single touch had set Josh’s heart racing. He wasabruptly gripped by every nameless fear he’d ever imagined, and all thenightmares that most terrified him flooded to the surface, leaving him gaspingand shaking, bathed in a bitter icy sweat. The second faun darted forward andlaid a cold hand on Josh’s face. Suddenly, his heart was tripping madly, hisstomach churning with mindless panic.The two creatures held each other and jumped up and down, shaking with whatcould only be laughter.“Josh.” Machiavelli’s commanding voice broke through the boy’s rising panic andsilenced the creatures. “Josh. Listen to me. Hear my voice, concentrate on it.The satyrs are simple creatures and feed off the most basic of human emotions:one gorges itself on fear, the other delights in panic. They are Phobos andDeimos.”At the mention of their names, the two satyrs started back, fading into theshadows, until only their huge liquid eyes were visible, black and shining inthe light of the hovering globe.“They are the Guardians of the Sleeping God.”And then, with a grinding of ancient stone, the statue sat up and swiveled itshead to look at Josh. Within the helmet, two eyes blazed bloodred."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FORTY-NINE“Is this a Shadowrealm?” Sophie asked in a horrified whisper, her breathcatching in her throat.She was standing at the entrance to a long straight tunnel whose walls weredecorated and lined with what looked like human bones. A single low-wattage bulblit the space with a dull yellow light.Joan squeezed her arm and laughed gently. “No. We’re still in our world. Welcometo the Catacombs of Paris.”Sophie’s eyes flickered silver as the Witch’s knowledge flowed through her. TheWitch of Endor knew these catacombs well. Sophie rocked back on her heels as asudden array of images engulfed her: men and women wearing little more than ragsquarrying stone from huge pits in the ground, watched over by guards wearing theuniforms of Roman centurions. “These were quarries,” she whispered.“A long time ago,” Nicholas said. “And now it is a tomb for millions ofParisians and one other….”“The Sleeping God,” Sophie said, her voice cracking. This was an Elder the Witchboth loathed and pitied.Saint-Germain and Joan were shocked by the girl’s knowledge. Even Flamel lookedstartled.Sophie started shivering. She wrapped her arms around her body, trying to standupright as dark thoughts crashed through her brain. The Sleeping God had oncebeen an Elder….…On a burning battlefield, she saw a lone warrior in metal and leather armor,wielding a sword almost as tall as he, fighting off creatures straight out ofthe Jurassic Age.…At the gates of an ancient city, the warrior in metal and leather stood aloneagainst a vast horde of apelike beast-men while a column of refugees escapedthrough another gate.…On the steps of an impossibly high pyramid, the warrior defended a lone womanand child from creatures that were a cross between serpents and birds.“Sophie…”She shivered, ice-cold now, teeth chattering. The images changed; the warrior’spolished leather and metal armor had turned filthy, encrusted with mud, streakedand stained. The warrior, too, was changed.…The warrior raced through a primitive ice-locked village, howling like a beast,while fur-wrapped humans fled from him or cowered in fear.…The warrior rode at the head of a vast army that was a mongrel mix of beastsand men bearing down on a sparkling city in the heart of an empty desert.…The warrior stood in the middle of an enormous library filled with charts,scrolls and books of metal, cloth and bark. The library was burning so intenselythat the metal books flowed liquid. Slashing his sword through a series ofshelves, he swept more books onto the flames.“Sophie!”The girl’s aura flickered and crackled as the Alchemyst gripped her shouldersand squeezed hard.“Sophie!”Flamel’s voice snapped her out of her trance. “I saw…I saw…,” she beganhoarsely. Her throat felt raw, and she’d bitten down so hard on the inside ofher cheek that there was the disgusting metallic taste of blood in her mouth.“I cannot even imagine what you saw,” he said gently. “But I think I know whoyou saw….”“Who was it?” she panted, breathless now. “Who was the warrior in the metal andleather armor?” She knew if she thought hard about him, the Witch’s memorieswould supply his name, but that would also draw her back into the warrior’sviolent world, and she didn’t want that.“The Elder, Mars Ultor.”“The God of War,” Joan of Arc added bitterly.Without looking or turning her head, Sophie raised her left hand and pointeddown a narrow corridor. “He’s down there,” she said quietly.“How do you know?” Saint-Germain asked.“I can feel him,” the girl said with a shudder. She rubbed her arms furiously.“It’s like something cold and sticky is running down my skin. It’s coming fromthere.”“This tunnel leads us into the secret heart of the catacombs,” Saint-Germainsaid, “into the lost Roman city of Lutetia.” He brushed his hands brisklytogether, showering sparks onto the ground, and then set off down the tunnel,followed by Joan. Sophie was about to follow them when she stopped and looked atthe Alchemyst. “What happened to Mars? When I saw him first, I thought he wasthe defender of humanity. What changed him?”Nicholas shook his head. “No one knows. Perhaps the answer lies in the Witch’smemories?” he suggested. “They must have known one another.”Sophie started to shake her head. “Don’t make me think about him…,” she began,but it was too late. Even as the Alchemyst was asking the question, a series ofterrible images flashed through Sophie’s mind. She saw a tall, handsome manstanding alone on the top of a dizzyingly high stepped pyramid, arms raised tothe heavens. Across his shoulders he wore a spectacular cloak of multicoloredfeathers. Spread out below the pyramid was a huge stone city, surrounded by athick jungle. The city was celebrating, the broad streets thronged with peoplewearing brightly colored clothes, ornate jewelry and extravagant featheredcloaks and headdresses. The only absence of color was in the line of white-cladmen and women stretching down the center of the wide main street. Looking moreclosely, she realized that they were chained together with ropes of leather andvine around their necks. Guards wielding whips and spears were driving themtoward the pyramid.Sophie drew in a deep shuddering breath and blinked away the images. “She knewhim,” she said coldly. She didn’t tell the Alchemyst that the Witch of Endor hadonce loved Mars…but that had been a long time ago, before he had changed, beforehe had become known as Mars Ultor. The Avenger."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTY“Hail, Mars, the Lord of War,” Dee said loudly.Completely numb with fright, Josh watched as the huge helmeted head slowlyturned to look at Dee. The Magician’s aura immediately snapped alight, sizzlingyellow and vaporous around him. Within the god’s helmet, red light glowed. Thehead turned again with the sound of grinding stone, and blazing crimson eyeslooked at the boy. The two ghost-white satyrs, Phobos and Deimos, crept out ofthe shadows and crouched behind the stone pedestal, watching Josh intently. Evenglancing at them sent waves of panic and fear coursing through his entire body,and he was sure he saw one of them lick thin lips with a tongue the color of anold bruise. Deliberately looking away, he concentrated on the ancient Elder.“You must show no fear,” Machiavelli had said, “and do not panic.” But that waseasier said than done. Directly in front of him, close enough to touch, was theElder the Romans had worshipped as the God of War. Josh had never heard ofHekate or the Witch of Endor, and because he knew nothing about them, theyhadn’t had the same effect on him. This Elder was different. Now he knew whatDee had meant when he said that this was the Elder remembered by humankind. Thiswas Mars himself, the Elder with a month and a planet named after him.Josh tried to draw in a deep breath and settle his thumping heart, but he wasshaking so hard he could barely breathe. His legs were like jelly, and he feltthat at any moment, he could crumple to the ground. Squeezing his mouth shut, heforced himself to draw in air through his nose, trying to remember some of thebreathing exercises he’d learned in martial arts class. He closed his eyes tightand wrapped his arms around his body, hugging himself hard. He should be able todo this: he’d seen Elders before; he’d faced the undead and even fought aprimeval monster. How hard could this be?Josh straightened, opened his eyes and looked at the statue of Mars…except thatit wasn’t a statue. This was a living being. There was a thick hard gray crustover his skin and clothing. The only touch of color about the god was in hiseyes, which glowed red behind a full-face visor that completely concealed hisface.“Great Mars, it is almost time,” Dee said quickly, “time for the Elders toreturn to the world of the humani.” He took a breath and announced dramatically,“We have the Codex.”Josh felt the crackle of parchment under his T-shirt. What would happen to himif they knew he had the two missing pages? Would they still Awaken him?At the mention of the Codex, the Elder’s head snapped toward Dee, eyes blazing,wisps of red smoke drifting from the slit in the helm.“The prophecy is almost fulfilled,” Dee continued quickly. “Soon we will makethe Final Summoning. Soon we will free the Lost Elders and return them to theirrightful place as rulers of the world. Soon we will return the world to theparadise it once was.”With the sound of grinding stone, Mars swung his legs off the plinth and turnedso that he was sitting facing the boy. Josh noticed that every movement senttiny flakes of what looked like stone skin onto the ground.Dee’s voice rose almost to a shout. “And the first prophecy of the Codex hascome to pass. We have found the two that are one. We have found the twins oflegend.” He waved a hand toward Josh. “This humani possesses an aura of puregold; his twin sister’s aura is unblemished silver.”Mars tilted his head to look at Josh again and then stretched out a gloved hand.It was still a foot and a half away from the boy’s shoulder when his aurabloomed silently around him, the bright glow lighting up the interior of thechamber, turning the polished bone walls golden, sending Phobos and Deimosscuttling for shelter in the deepest shadows behind the plinth. The dry air wassuddenly rich with the scent of orange.Squinting against the glow given off by his own skin, feeling the hair on hishead standing up, crackling with static, Josh watched in awe as the hardenedcrust began to fall away from Mars’s fingertips to reveal deeply tanned, muscledflesh beneath. The god’s own aura flared, outlining the statue in a thickpurple-red mist and his healthy skin started to glow an angry red as tiny sparkscurled off the aura and stuck to his flesh, quickly cooling and coating it in agray-white stonelike scab. Josh frowned; it looked as if the god’s aura washardening into a thick shell around him, slowly turning him to stone again.“The girl’s powers have been Awakened,” Dee continued, his voice echoing in thechamber. “The boy’s have not. If we are to succeed, if we are to bring back theElders, this boy’s powers must be Awakened. Mars Ultor, will you Awaken theboy?”The god planted his tall broadsword on the ground, the point sinking easily intothe bone floor, wrapped both hands around the hilt and leaned forward to look atJosh.Show no fear and don’t panic. Josh straightened and stood tall, then stareddirectly into the narrow rectangular opening in the stone helm. For the space ofa single heartbeat, he thought he caught a flash of brilliantly bright blue eyesin the shadows, before they turned red and glowing again. Josh’s aura faded to adull glow and the two satyrs immediately crept forward, climbing onto the plinthto peer around the god at the boy. The hunger in their eyes was unmistakablenow.“Twins.”It took Josh a moment to realize that Mars had spoken. The god’s voice wassurprisingly soft and sounded incredibly weary. “Twins?” The question in hisvoice was unmistakable.“Y-yes,” Josh stammered. “I have a twin sister, Sophie.”“I had twin boys once…a long time ago,” Mars said, his voice lost and distant.The red glow inside his helm faded and blue eyes blinked again. “Good boys, fineboys,” he added, and Josh was unsure whom he was speaking to. “Who is theelder?” he asked. “You or your sister?”“Sophie,” Josh said, lips curling in a sudden smile at the thought of hissister. “But only by twenty-eight seconds.”“And do you love your sister?” Mars asked.Taken by surprise, Josh said, “Yes…well, I mean, yes, of course I do. She’s mytwin.”Mars nodded. “Romulus, my younger boy, said that too. He swore to me that heloved his brother, Remus. And then he killed him.”The bone chamber fell deathly silent.Looking into the helmet, Josh saw Mars Ultor’s eyes turn blue and wet, and hefelt his own eyes fill with tears in sympathy. Then the god’s tears hissed tosteam as his eyes blazed red again. “I had Awakened my sons’ auras, gave themaccess to powers and abilities beyond those of the humani. All their senses andemotions were heightened…including the emotions of hate, fear and love.” Hepaused, and then added, “They had been close—so close—until I Awakened theirsenses. That destroyed them.” There was another, longer pause. “Perhaps it wouldbe better if I did not Awaken you. For your own sake and the sake of yoursister.”Josh blinked in surprise and looked over his shoulder at Dee and Machiavelli.The Italian’s face was impassive, but Dee looked as stunned as Josh felt. WasMars refusing to Awaken him?“Lord Mars,” the Magician began, “the boy must be Awakened….”“It will be his choice,” Mars said mildly.“I demand—”The glow within the god’s helm turned incandescent. “You demand!”“In my master’s name, of course,” Dee said quickly. “My master demands—”“Your master can make no demands of me, Magician,” Mars whispered. “And if youspeak again,” he added, “I will loose my companions on you.” Phobos and Deimosclambered over the god’s shoulders to peer at Dee. They were both drooling. “Itis a terrible death.” He looked back at Josh. “This is your choice and yoursalone. I can Awaken your powers. I can make you powerful. Dangerously powerful.”Red eyes blazed brightly, the centers burning yellow hot. “Is this what youwant?”“Yes,” Josh said without hesitation.“There is a price, for everything has a price.”“I’ll pay it,” Josh said immediately, though he had no idea what that paymentmight be.Mars nodded his great head, stone cracking and grinding. “A good response, thecorrect response. Asking me about the price would have been a mistake.”Phobos and Deimos cackled in what Josh assumed was a laugh, and he immediatelyknew that others had paid the price for trying to negotiate with the SleepingGod.“There will come a time when I will remind you that you are in debt to me.” Thegod looked over Josh’s head. “Who will mentor the boy?”“I will,” Dee and Machiavelli said simultaneously.Josh turned to look at the two immortals, surprised by their response. Of thetwo, he thought he would prefer to be mentored by Machiavelli.“Magician, he is yours,” Mars said after a moment’s consideration. “I can readyour intent and your motives clearly. You intend to use the boy to bring backthe Elders; I have no doubt of that. But you…,” he added, his head swiveling tolook at Machiavelli. “I cannot read your aura; I do not know what you want.Perhaps because you have not yet decided.”Rocks snapped and creaked as the god stood. He was at least seven feet tall, hishelmeted head almost brushing the ceiling. “Kneel,” he said to Josh, who foldedto his knees. Mars tugged his huge sword free from the floor and spun it untilit was directly in front of the boy’s face. Josh went crosseyed looking at theblade. It was so close that he could see where the edge was chipped and pittedand was able to make out the faintest trace of a spiraling pattern down thecenter of the sword.“What are your clan name and your parents’ names?”Josh’s mouth was so dry he could barely speak. “The clan name? Oh, the familyname is Newman. My father is Richard and my mother is Sara.” He had a suddenmemory of Hekate asking Sophie the same questions. It had been only a couple ofdays ago, and yet it felt like a lifetime.The timbre of the god’s voice changed, becoming stronger, loud enough for Joshto feel the vibrations in his bones. “Josh, son of Richard and Sara of the ClanNewman, of the race humani, I will grant you an Awakening. You have acknowledgedthat this is no gift and there will be a price to pay. If you do not pay it, Iwill destroy you and everything you hold dear.”“I’ll pay,” Josh said thickly, blood thundering in his head, adrenaline coursingthrough his body.“I know you will.” The huge sword moved, first touching Josh’s right shoulder,then his left before moving back to his right. The faintest outline of his aurawinked into existence around his body. Wisps of gold smoke started to curl offhis blond hair, and the scent of citrus grew stronger. “Hence-forth you will seewith acuity….”Josh’s bright blue eyes turned into solid gold discs. Immediately, tearsgathered and ran down his face. They were the color and texture of liquid gold.“You will hear with clarity….”Smoke coiled from the boy’s ears.“You will taste with purity….”Josh opened his mouth and coughed. A puff of saffron-colored mist appeared, andtiny amber sparks danced between his tongue and teeth.“You will touch with sensitivity….”The boy brought his hands up to his face. They were glowing so brightly thatthey were almost transparent. Sparks leapt and curled between each finger, andhis badly chewed fingernails were polished mirrors.“You will smell with intensity….”Josh’s head was almost completely enveloped in golden smoke now. It trickledfrom his nostrils, making it look as if he were breathing fire. His aura hadthickened, solidified around his shoulders and across his chest, becoming shinyand reflective.The god’s sword moved again, tapping lightly against the boy’s shoulders.“Truly, yours is one of the most powerful auras I have ever encountered,” Marssaid quietly. “There is something else I can give you—a gift—and this I givefreely. You may find it of use in the days to come.” Stretching out his lefthand, he rested it on top of the boy’s head. Instantly, Josh’s aura burst intoincandescent light. Streamers and globes of yellow fire curled from his body andbounced around the room. Phobos and Deimos were caught by the blast of light andheat, and it sent them squealing and scrambling behind the stone plinth, but notbefore their pale skin had reddened and the tips of their snow white hair haddarkened and crisped. The searing light drove Dee to his knees, gloved handspressed against his eyes. He rolled over, burying his face in his hands asspheres of fire bounced off the floor and ceiling, spattering against the walls,leaving scorch marks on the polished bone.Only Machiavelli had escaped the full force of the explosion of light. He’dturned away and ducked out of the room in the last instant before Mars hadtouched the boy. Curling up in a ball, he hid in the deep shadows outside thedoor while streamers of yellow light ricocheted off the walls and hissing ballsof solid energy blazed out into the corridor. He blinked hard, trying to clearthe streaked afterimages seared onto his retinas. Machiavelli had seenAwakenings before, but never anything this dramatic. What was Mars doing to theboy, what gift was he giving him?Then, through his blurring vision, he saw a vague silvery shape materialize atthe other end of the corridor.And the scent of vanilla filled the catacombs."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTY-ONEPerched on top of the water tower on Alcatraz, surrounded by huge Dire-Crows,the Morrigan sang softly to herself. It was a song first heard by the mostprimitive of ancient men, now imprinted deep into humankind’s DNA. It was slowand gentle, lost and plaintive, beautiful…and utterly terrifying. It was theSong of the Morrigan: a cry designed to inspire fear and terror. And onbattlefields across the world and down through time, it was often the last sounda human heard in this life.The Morrigan drew her black feathered cloak about her and gazed out across thefog-locked bay toward the city. She could feel the heat of the mass of humani,could see the seething glow of almost a million auras within San Fanciscoitself. And every aura was wrapped around a humani, each one rich with fears andworries, filled with succulent, tasty emotions. She pressed her hands togetherand brought the tips of her fingers to her thin black lips. Her ancestors hadfed off humankind, had drunk their memories, savored their emotions like finewines. Soon…oh, so very soon, she would be free to do it again.But before that she had a banquet to enjoy.Earlier, she’d received a call from Dee. Finally, he and his Elders had beenforced to agree that it was now too dangerous to allow both Nicholas andPerenelle to survive; he had given her permission to slay the Sorceress.The Morrigan had an eyrie high in the San Bernardino Mountains. She would carryPerenelle there and over the next few days drain every last one of the woman’smemories and emotions. The Sorceress had lived for almost seven hundred years;she had traveled across the globe and into Shadowrealms, had seen wonders andexperienced terrors. And the woman had an extraordinary memory; she would haveremembered everything, every emotion, every thought and fear. And the Morriganwould relish them all. When she was finished, the legendary Perenelle Flamelwould be little more than a mindless babe. The Crow Goddess threw back her headand opened her mouth wide, her long incisors white and stark against her darklips, her tongue tiny and black. Soon.The Morrigan knew that the Sorceress was in the tunnels beneath the water tower.The only other entrance was through a tunnel that was accessible only at lowtide. And although the tide would not turn for hours, the rocks and cliff facearound the cave mouth were covered with razor-billed crows.Then the Morrigan’s nostrils flared.Over the salt and iodine smell of the sea, the metallic stink of rusted metaland rotting stone and the musty scent of countless birds, she suddenly smelledsomething else…something that didn’t belong, not in this place, not in this age.Something ancient and bitter.The wind shifted, and the fog curled with it. Beads of salty moisture suddenlyglistened on a thread of silver hanging in the air before her. The Morriganblinked her jet-black eyes. Another thread wavered in the air, and then anotherand another, crisscrossed in a series of circles. They looked like webs.They were webs.She was coming to her feet when a monstrous spider erupted from the shaft belowher and landed squarely on the side of the water tower, its huge barbed feetbiting into the metal. It scuttled toward the Crow Goddess.The mass of birds ringing the water tower spiraled skyward, screamingraucously…and were instantly trapped in the enormous web floating overhead. Theyfell back on top of their dark mistress, entangling her in a writhing mass offeathers and sticky web. The Morrigan slashed her way free with razor-tippednails, gathered her cloak about her and was about to take to the air when thespider climbed over the top of the water tower and drove her back, pinning herdown with a huge barbed foot.Perenelle Flamel, astride the spider’s back, a blazing spear in her hand, leanedforward and smiled at the Morrigan. “You were looking for me, I believe.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTY-TWOSophie ran.She was no longer afraid; she didn’t feel sick or weak anymore. She just had toget to her brother. Josh was directly ahead of her, in a room at the end of thetunnel. She could see the golden glow of his aura lighting up the darkness,smell the mouthwatering scent of oranges.Pushing past Nicholas, Joan and Saint-Germain, ignoring their cries to stop,Sophie raced for the glowing arched doorway. She had always been a good runnerand held track records for the hundred-meter in most of the schools she’dattended, but now she practically flew down the corridor. And with every step,her aura—fueled by anger and determination—grew around her, sparking, cracklingand metallic. Her enhanced senses flared, her pupils shrinking to dots and thenexpanding to silver discs, and instantly the shadows vanished and she could seethe gloomy catacomb in all its shocking detail. Her nostrils were assaulted witha variety of smells—snake and sulfur, rot and mold—but stronger than all theothers was the orange scent of her brother’s aura.And she knew she was too late: he had been Awakened.Ignoring the man crouching on the ground outside the chamber, Sophie racedthrough the doorway…and her aura instantly hardened to a metallic shell asblazing arcs of gold fire bounced off the walls to spatter against her. Shestaggered, battered by the energy. Gripping the edge of the door, she held on toprevent herself from being pushed back out into the corridor.“Josh,” she said, awed by the sight before her.Josh was kneeling on the ground before what could only be Mars. The huge Elderwas holding a broadsword aloft in his left hand, the point touching the ceiling,while his right was clamped onto her brother’s head. Josh’s aura was blazinglike wildfire, cocooning him in golden light. Yellow fire spun around him,throwing off spheres and whips of energy. They splashed against the walls andceilings, cutting away chunks of time-yellowed bone to reveal the white beneath.“Josh!” Sophie screamed.The god slowly turned his head and fixed her with glowing red eyes. “Leave,”Mars commanded.Sophie shook her head. “Not without my twin,” she said through gritted teeth.She wasn’t going to abandon her brother; she’d never do that.“He is no longer your twin,” Mars said mildly. “You are different now.”“He will always be my twin,” she said simply.Pushing into the room, she sent a wave of ice-cold silver fog rolling out fromher body to wash over her brother and the Elder. It hissed and sizzled where ittouched Josh’s aura, dirty white smoke curling up to gather at the ceiling. Itfrosted over Mars’s hard skin, and ice crystals sparkled in the amber light.The god slowly lowered his sword. “Have you any idea who I am?” he asked, hisvoice soft, almost gentle. “If you did, you would fear me.”“You are Mars Ultor,” Sophie said slowly, the Witch of Endor’s knowledgeinforming her. “And before the Romans worshipped you, the Greeks knew you asAres, and before that the Babylonians called you Nergal.”“Who are you?” The Elder’s hand dropped away from Josh’s head, and instantly,the boy’s aura winked out and the fires died.Josh swayed and Sophie swooped in to catch him before he hit the ground. Themoment she touched him, her own aura disappeared, leaving her defenseless. Butshe’d gone beyond fear now; she felt nothing, only relief that she’d beenreunited with her twin. Crouching on the ground, cradling her brother in herarms, Sophie looked up at the towering war god. “And before you were Nergal, youwere the champion of the humankind: you were Huitzilopochtli. You led the humanslaves to safety when Danu Talis sank beneath the waves.”The god staggered away. The backs of his knees hit the plinth and he sat downsuddenly, the massive stone cracking beneath his great weight. “How do you knowthis?” he asked, and what sounded like fear rattled in his voice.“Because you walked with the Witch of Endor.” She straightened, hauling herbrother to his feet. His eyes were open but had rolled back in his head, leavingonly the whites showing. “The Witch of Endor gave me all her memories,” Sophiesaid. “I know what you did…and why she cursed you.” Stretching out her hand, shetouched the god’s stone-hard skin with her fingertip. A spark snapped. “I knowwhy she did this to your aura.”Draping her brother’s arm over her shoulder, she turned her back on the war god.Flamel, Saint-Germain and Joan had arrived and had gathered in the doorway.Joan’s sword was loosely pointed at Dee, who was lying unmoving on the floor. Noone spoke.“If you have the Witch’s knowledge within you,” Mars said urgently, almostpleadingly, “then you know her incantations and cantrips. You know how to liftthis curse.”Nicholas hurried forward to lift Josh from Sophie’s arms, but she refused to lether brother go. Glancing over her shoulder at the god, she said very softly,“Yes, I know how to lift it.”“Then do it,” Mars commanded. “Do it and I will give you everything you want. Ican give you anything!”Sophie thought for a moment. “Can you take away my Awakened senses? Can you makeme and my brother normal again?”There was a long moment of silence before the god spoke again. “No. I cannot dothat.”“Then there is nothing you can do for us.” Sophie turned away and, withSaint-Germain’s assistance, helped Josh out into the corridor. Joan ducked out,leaving only Flamel standing in the doorway.“Wait!” The god’s voice rose and the entire chamber trembled with the sound.Phobos and Deimos slunk out from behind the cracked plinth, chattering noisily.“You will reverse this curse, or…,” the god began.Nicholas stepped forward. “Or what?”“None of you will leave these catacombs alive,” Mars barked. “I will not permitit. And I am Mars Ultor!” The god’s hidden eyes blazed bloodred and he took astep forward, swinging the huge sword before him. “Who are you to deny me?”“I am Nicholas Flamel. And you,” he added, “are an Elder who made the mistake ofbelieving that you were a god.” He snapped his fingers and dust motes ofglittering emerald drifted to the bone floor. They raced across the smoothlypolished surface, leaving tiny threads of green in the aged yellow. “I am theAlchemyst…and let me introduce you to the greatest secret of alchemy:transmutation.” And then he turned back to the corridor and disappeared into theshadows.“No!” Mars took a step forward and instantly sank up to his ankle in the floor,which had suddenly turned soft and gelatinous. The god took another shudderingstep and then lost his footing as the ground melted beneath his weight. Hecrashed forward, hitting the floor hard enough to send splashes of jellylikebone onto the walls. His sword bit a huge chunk out of the wall where, a momentearlier, Flamel had been standing. Mars struggled to regain his footing, but thefloor was a shifting quagmire of sticky semiliquid bone. Rising to his hands andknees, Mars thrust his head forward to glare at Dee, who was slowly crawling outof the liquid toward the door. “This is your doing, Magician!” he howledsavagely, the entire chamber vibrating with his rage. Bone dust and chips ofancient stone rained down. “I hold you responsible.”Dee staggered to his feet and leaned against the doorframe, shaking glutinousjelly off his hands, brushing it off his ruined trousers.“Bring me the girl and the boy,” Mars snarled, “and I may forgive you. Bring methe twins. Or else.”“Or else—what?” Dee asked mildly.“I will destroy you: not even your Elder master will be able to protect you frommy wrath.”“Don’t you dare threaten me!” Dee said, his voice an ugly snarl. “And I don’tneed my Elder to protect me.”“Fear me, Magician, for you have made an enemy of me.”“Do you know what I do to those who frighten me?” Dee demanded, his accentthickening. “I destroy them!” The room suddenly filled with the stench ofsulfur, and then the bone walls began to run and melt like soft ice cream.“Flamel is not the only alchemist who knows the secret of transmutation,” hesaid as the ceiling turned soft and liquid, long strands dripping down to thefloor, covering Mars in sticky fluid. Then it began to rain bone in huge yellowdrops.“Destroy him!” Mars howled. Phobos and Deimos leapt from the plinth onto theElder’s back, teeth and claws extended, huge eyes fixed on Dee.The Magician spoke a single word of power and snapped his fingers: the liquidbone instantly hardened.Niccolò Machiavelli appeared in the doorway. He folded his arms and looked intothe chamber. In the center of the room, caught as he tried to rise from thefloor, the two satyrs on his back, was Mars Ultor, frozen in bone.“So the catacombs of Paris have yet another mysterious bone statue,” the Italiansaid mildly. Dee turned away. “First you kill Hekate and now Mars,” Machiavellicontinued. “And I thought you were supposed to be on our side. You do realize,”he called after Dee, “that we are both dead men. We’ve failed to capture Flameland the twins. Our masters will not forgive us.”“We’ve not failed yet,” Dee called back. He was almost at the end of thecorridor. “I know where this tunnel comes out. I know how we can capture them.”He stopped and looked back, and when he spoke, the words came slowly, almostreluctantly. “But…Niccolò…we will need to work together. We will need to combineour powers.”“What do you intend to do?” Machiavelli asked.“Together, we can loose the Guardians of the City.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTY-THREEThe Morrigan managed to struggle to her feet, but a spiderweb as thick as herarm wrapped around her waist and twisted between her legs, entangling them, andshe fell. She started to slide over the side of the water tower when a secondand then a third web caught her, curling around her body, wrapping it from neckto toes in a thick mummylike shell. Perenelle leapt off Areop-Enap’s back andcrouched beside the Crow Goddess. The head of her spear vibrated with energy,and red and white smoke coiled into the damp night air. “You probably feel likescreaming right now,” Perenelle said with a wry smile. “Go ahead.”The Morrigan obliged. Her jaws unhinged, black lips parted to reveal her savageteeth and she howled.The nerve-shattering cry echoed across the island. Every unbroken pane of glasson Alcatraz shattered into powder, and the entire water tower swayed. Across thebay, the city came awake as business, house and car alarms along the waterfrontburst into cacophonous life. Every dog within a hundred-mile radius of theisland started yowling piteously.But the scream also brought the rest of the huge flock of gathered birds surginginto the night sky in a thunderous explosion of flapping wings and raucouscries. Most were immediately entangled and brought down by a thick cloud ofspiderwebs hanging in the air between the desolate buildings, draped acrossevery open window, spun from pole to pole. The moment the ensnared birds hit theground, spiders of every shape and size swarmed over them, cocooning them inthick silver webs. Within moments, the island fell silent again.A handful of Dire-Crows escaped. Six of the huge birds swooped low over theisland, avoiding the festoons and nets of sticky web. The birds curled out overSan Francisco Bay toward the bridge, soared high and then swung back to attack.Now they were above the entangling spiderwebs. They circled over the watertower. Twelve pitch-black eyes fixed on Perenelle, and razor beaks anddagger-tipped claws opened as they dropped silently toward the woman.Crouched over the Morrigan, Perenelle caught the flickering hint of movementreflected in her adversary’s black eyes. The Sorceress brought the spearhead toblazing life with a single word and spun it in her hand, leaving a red triangleburning in the foggy air. The savage birds flew through the red fire…andchanged.Six perfect eggs dropped out of the sky and were plucked out of midair bystrands of gossamer-thin spiderweb. “Breakfast,” Areop-Enap said delightedly,clambering down the side of the tower.Perenelle sat down beside the struggling Crow Goddess. Resting the spear on herknees, she looked out across the bay in the direction of the city she calledhome.“What will you do now, Sorceress?” the Morrigan demanded.“I have no idea,” Perenelle said truthfully. “It seems Alcatraz is mine.” Shesounded almost bemused by the idea. “Well, mine and Areop-Enap’s.”“Unless you’ve managed to master the art of flight, you are trapped here,” theMorrigan snarled. “This is Dee’s property. No tourists come here now; there areno sightseers, no fishing boats. You are still as much a prisoner as when youwere in your cell. And the sphinx patrols the corridors below. She’ll be comingfor you.”The Sorceress smiled. “She can try.” She twirled the spear. It hummed in theair. “I wonder what this would turn her into: baby girl, lion cub or bird egg.”“You know that Dee will return—and in force. He’ll want his army of monsters.”“I’ll be waiting for him, too,” the Sorceress promised.“You cannot win,” the Morrigan spat.“People have been telling Nicholas and me that for centuries. And yet, we’restill here.”“What will you do with me?” the Crow Goddess asked eventually. “Unless you killme, you know I’ll never rest until you are dead.”Perenelle smiled. She brought the spearhead close to her lips and blew gently onit until it glowed white-hot. “I wonder what this would turn you into?” sheasked absently. “Bird or egg?”“I was born, not hatched,” the Morrigan said simply. “You cannot threaten mewith death. It holds no fear for me.”Perenelle got to her feet and planted the butt of the spear on the ground. “I’mnot going to kill you. I’ve got a much more suitable punishment in store foryou.” She looked toward the skies, and the wind took her long hair, blowing itstraight out behind her. “I’ve often wondered what it would be like to be ableto fly, to soar silently through the heavens.”“There is no greater feeling,” the Morrigan said honestly.Perenelle’s smile was icy. “That’s what I thought. So I’m going to take awaythat which you hold most precious: your freedom and your ability to fly. I havethe most wonderful cell just for you.”“No prison can hold me,” the Morrigan said contemptuously.“It was designed to hold Areop-Enap,” Perenelle said. “Deep underground, youwill never see the sunlight or fly in the air again.”The Morrigan howled again and thrashed from side to side. The water towershifted and trembled, but the Old Spider’s web was unbreakable. Then the CrowGoddess abruptly fell silent. The wind picked up, and fog swirled around the twowomen. They could hear the clanging of distant alarms from San Francisco.The Morrigan began to heave a series of hacking coughs, and it took Perenelle amoment before she realized that the Crow Goddess was laughing. Although she hadan idea she was not going to like the answer, Perenelle asked, “And do you wantto tell me what you find so amusing?”“You may have defeated me,” the Morrigan heaved, “but you are already dying. Ican see the age on your face and hands.”Perenelle raised her hand to her face and moved the spearhead so that it shedlight on her flesh. She was shocked to discover a speckling of brown spots onthe back of her hand. She touched her face and neck, fingers tracing the linesof new wrinkles.“How long before the alchemical formula wears off, Sorceress? How long beforeyou wither into shriveled old age? Is it measured in days or weeks?”“A lot can happen in a few days.”“Sorceress, listen to me now. Listen to the truth. The Magician is in Paris. Hehas captured the boy and loosed Nidhogg on your husband and the others.” Shecoughed another laugh. “I was sent here to kill you because you and your husbandare worthless. The twins are the key to the future.”Perenelle leaned close to the Morrigan. The spearhead shed a crimson glow overboth their faces, making them look like hideous masks. “You’re right. The twinsare the key to the future—but whose: the Dark Elders’ or humankind’s?”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTY-FOURNiccolò Machiavelli took a tentative step forward and looked down over the cityof Paris. He was standing on the roof of the great Gothic cathedral of NotreDame; below was the river Seine and the Pont au Double, and directly spread outbefore him was the broad parvis, the square. Holding tightly to the ornatebrickwork, he drew in a deep shuddering breath and willed his thumping heart toslow. He had just climbed one thousand and one steps up out of the catacombsonto the roof of the cathedral, following a secret route Dee claimed he’d usedbefore. His legs were trembling with the effort and his knees ached. Machiavelliliked to think that he kept himself in good condition—he was a strict vegetarianand exercised every day—but the climb had exhausted him. He was also vaguelyirritated that the strenuous climb hadn’t affected Dee in the slightest. “Whendid you say you were last up here?” he asked.“I didn’t say,” the Magician snapped. He was standing to Machiavelli’s left, inthe shadow of the south tower. “But if you must know, it was in 1575.” Hepointed off to one side. “I met the Morrigan right there. It was on this roofthat I first learned of the true nature of Nicholas Flamel and the existence ofthe Book of Abraham. So perhaps it is fitting that it ends here too.”Machiavelli leaned out and looked down. He was standing almost directly abovethe west rose window. The square below him should have been thronged withtourists, but it was eerily deserted. “And how do you know Flamel and the otherswill come out here?” he asked.Dee’s small teeth flashed in an ugly grin. “We know the boy is claustrophobic.His senses have just been Awakened. When he comes out of whatever trance Marsleft him in, he’s going to be terrified, and his heightened senses will only addto that terror. For the sake of his sanity, Flamel will have to get him aboveground as quickly as possible. I know that there is a secret passage leadingfrom the buried Roman city into the cathedral.” He suddenly pointed down as fivefigures stumbled out of the central door directly below them. “You see?” he saidtriumphantly. “I’m never wrong.” He looked at Machiavelli. “You know what wehave to do?”The Italian nodded. “I know.”“You don’t look too happy about it.”“Defacing a beautiful building is a crime.”“But killing people is not?” Dee asked.“Well, people can always be replaced.”image [images/Scot_9780375849084_epub_002_r1.jpg]“Let me just sit,” Josh gasped. Without waiting for a response, he crumpled outof his sister’s and Saint-Germain’s hands and sat down on a smooth circularstone set into the cobbled square. Bringing his knees up to his chest, he restedhis chin on his kneecaps and wrapped his arms around his shins. He was shakingso hard that his heels were tapping off the stone.“We really need to keep moving,” Flamel said urgently, looking around.“Give us a minute,” Sophie snapped. Kneeling beside her brother, she reached outto touch him, but a spark cracked between her fingertips and his arm and theyboth jumped. “I know what you’re feeling,” she said gently. “Everything is so…sobright, so loud, so sharp. Your clothes feel so heavy and rough against yourskin, your shoes are too tight. But you do get used to it. The feelings do goaway.” He was undergoing what she’d experienced only a couple of days ago.“My head is throbbing,” Josh mumbled. “It feels like it’s about to explode, likeit’s crammed with too much information. I keep thinking these strangethoughts….”The girl frowned. That didn’t sound right. When she’d been Awakened, her senseshad been overwhelmed, but it was only when the Witch of Endor had pouredknowledge into her that she’d felt as if her brain were about to burst. A suddenthought struck her, and she remembered that when she’d raced into the chamber,she’d seen the Elder’s huge hand pressing on her brother’s head. “Josh,” shesaid quietly. “When Mars Awakened you, what did he say?”Her brother shook his head miserably. “I don’t know.”“Think,” she said sharply, and saw him wince at the sound of her voice. “Please,Josh,” she said quietly. “This is important.”“You’re not the boss of me,” he muttered with a trace of a smile.“I know.” She grinned. “But I’m still your big sister—now tell me!”Josh frowned, but the effort hurt his forehead. “He said…he said that theAwakening wasn’t a gift, that it was something I would have to pay for later.”“What else?”“He said…he said that mine was one of the most powerful auras he’d everencountered.” Josh had been looking at the god as he’d spoken the words, seeinghim for the first time with Awakened eyes, noticing the intricate detail on hishelm and the ornate design on his leather breastplate and hearing clearly thepain in his voice. “He said he was going to give me a gift, something I mightfind useful in the days to come.”“And?”“I have no idea what that was. When he put his hand on my head, I felt as if hewas trying to push me through the floor. The pressure was incredible.”“He’s passed something to you,” Sophie said, worried. “Nicholas,” she called.But there was no response, and when she turned to look for the Alchemyst shefound him, Saint-Germain and Joan staring back at the great cathedral.“Sophie,” Nicholas said calmly, without turning around, “help your brother tohis feet. We need to get out of here right now. Before it’s too late.”His calm, reasoned tone frightened her more than if he had shouted. Catching herbrother under both arms, ignoring the rattling snap of their auras, she hauledhim upright and turned around. Facing them were three squat mismatched monsters.“I think it’s already too late,” she said. Over the centuries, Dr. John Dee had learned how to animate Golems and had alsomanaged to create and control simulacra and homunculi. One of the earliestskills Machiavelli had mastered was the ability to control a tulpa. The processwas surprisingly similar; all that really differed were the materials.They could both bring the inanimate to life.Now the Magician and the Italian stood side by side on the roof of Notre Dameand focused their wills.And one by one, the gargoyles and grotesques of Notre Dame came to creakinglife. The gargoyles—the water spouts—moved first.Singly and in pairs, then in dozens and suddenly in hundreds, they broke free ofthe cathedral walls. Crawling out from the hidden places—the unseen eaves, theforgotten gutters—stone dragons and serpents, goats and monkeys, cats, dogs andmonsters slithered down the front of the building.Then the grotesques—the hideous carved statues—came to lumbering life. Lions,tigers, apes and bears tore themselves free from the medieval stonework andclambered down the building.“This is really very, very bad,” Saint-Germain muttered.A crudely carved lion dropped to the ground directly in front of the cathedraldoor and padded forward, stone claws clicking and sliding on the smooth cobbles.Saint-Germain threw out his hand and the lion was engulfed in a ball offire…which had no effect on it, other than to burn off centuries of dirt andbird droppings. The lion kept coming. Saint-Germain tried different types offire—darts and sheets of flame, fire balls and whips—but to no avail.More and more of the gargoyles dropped to the ground. A few shattered on impact,but most survived. They spread out, filling the square, and then they started toclose in, tightening the noose. Some of the creatures were intricately andbeautifully carved; others had been weathered to little more than anonymouslumps. The bigger gargoyles lumbered slowly while the smaller grotesques dartedabout. But they all moved in absolute silence, save for the grinding scrape ofstone on stone.A creature that was half man, half goat shuffled out of the approaching crowd,dropped to all fours and trotted forward, wickedly curved stone horns slashingat Saint-Germain. Joan jumped forward and chopped at the creature, her swordstriking sparks off its neck. The blow didn’t even slow it down. Saint-Germainmanaged to throw himself to one side at the last minute, then made the mistakeof slapping the beast on the rump as it went past. His hand stung. The goat-mantried to stop on the cobbles and slipped, crashing to the ground and crackingoff one of his horns.Nicholas drew Clarent and spun around, holding the sword in both hands,wondering which creature would attack first. A bear with the head of a womanlumbered forward, claws extended. Nicholas jabbed with Clarent, but the swordscreamed harmlessly off the creature’s stone hide. He quickly cut at the beastwith the edge of the sword, but the vibration numbed his entire arm, almostknocking the sword from his grip. The bear swiped a massive paw that whisperedover the Alchemyst’s head. It teetered off balance, and Nicholas rushed forwardto throw his weight against it. The bear crashed to the ground. Its claws beatagainst the cobblestones, shattering them to dust as it attempted to regain itsfeet.Standing before her brother, desperately trying to shield him, Sophie loosed aseries of small whirlwinds. They bounced harmlessly off most of the stones anddid nothing more than send a newspaper spiraling high into the sky.“Nicholas,” Saint-Germain said desperately as the circle of stone creatures dreweven closer. “A little magic, some alchemy, would be good now.”Nicholas held out his right hand. A tiny sphere of green glass formed in it.Then it cracked and the liquid contents flowed back into his skin. “I’m notstrong enough,” the Alchemyst answered sadly. “The transmutation spell in thecatacombs exhausted me.”The gargoyles shuffled closer, stone grinding, cracking with every step. Smallgrotesques were pulverized to dust if they were caught under the biggercreatures’ feet.“They’ll just roll right over us,” Saint-Germain muttered.“Dee must be controlling them,” Josh mumbled. He slumped against his sister,hands pressed against his ears. Every grinding footstep, every crack of stone,was agony to his Awakened hearing.“There’s too many here for just one man,” Joan said. “It has to be Dee andMachiavelli.”“But they must be close by,” Nicholas said.“Very close,” Joan agreed.“A commander always takes the high ground,” Josh said suddenly, surprisinghimself with the knowledge.“Which means they’re on the roof of the cathedral,” Flamel concluded.Then Joan pointed. “I see them. There, between the towers, directly above thecenter of the West Rose Window.” She tossed her sword to her husband, and thenher aura flowed silver around her body and the air filled with the scent oflavender. Her aura hardened, taking on shape and substance, and suddenly alongbow grew out of her left hand while a shining arrow appeared in her right.Drawing back her right arm, she sighted and loosed the arrow, sending it arcinghigh into the air. “They’ve spotted us,” Machiavelli said. Huge beads of sweat rolled down hisface, and his lips were blue with the effort of controlling the stone creatures.“It is no matter,” Dee said, peering over the edge. “They are powerless.” In thesquare below, the five humans were standing in a circle as the crushing stonestatues closed in.“Then let us finish it,” Machiavelli said through gritted teeth. “But remember,we need the children alive.” He broke off as something slender and silver arcedthrough the air before his face. “It’s an arrow,” he began in wonder, and thenstopped and grunted as the arrow plunged deep into his thigh. His entire legfrom hip to toe went dead. He staggered back and fell onto the cathedral roof,hands pressed against his leg. Surprisingly, there was no blood, but the painwas excruciating.On the ground far below, at least half the creatures suddenly froze or toppledover. They crashed to the ground, and those behind tumbled over them. Rockshattered, weathered stone exploding to dust. But still the rest of thecreatures pressed on, closing in.Another dozen silver arrows arced up from below. They pinged and shatteredharmlessly against the brickwork.“Machiavelli!” Dee howled.“I can’t…” The pain in his leg was indescribable, and tears rolled down hischeeks. “I can’t concentrate….”“Then I’ll finish it myself.”“The boy and girl,” Machiavelli said weakly. “We need them alive….”“Not necessarily. I am a necromancer. I can reanimate their corpses.”“No!” Machiavelli screamed.Dee ignored him. Focusing his extraordinary will, the Magician issued thegargoyles a single command. “Kill them. Kill them all.”The creatures surged forward.image [images/Scot_9780375849084_epub_002_r1.jpg]“Again, Joan!” Flamel shouted. “Fire again!”“I cannot.” The tiny Frenchwoman was gray with exhaustion. “The arrows areshaped from my aura. I have nothing left.”The gargoyles pressed in, closer and closer, stone grinding and scraping as theyshuffled on. Their range of movement was limited; some had claws and teeth,others horns or barbed tails, but they would simply crush the humans.Josh picked up a small round grotesque that was so weathered it was little morethan a squat lump of stone and heaved it back into the mass of creatures. Itstruck a gargoyle, and both shattered. He winced with the sound, but he alsorealized that they could be destroyed. Pressing his hands against his ears, hesquinted at the broken creature, his Awakened sight taking in every detail. Thestone creatures were invulnerable to steel and magic…but then he noted that thestone was weathered and fragile. What destroyed stone?…There was a flash of memory…except it wasn’t his memory…of an ancient city,walls crumbling, pulverized to dust…“I’ve got an idea,” he shouted.“Make it a good one,” Saint-Germain called. “Is it magic?”“It’s basic chemistry.” Josh looked at Saint-Germain. “Francis, how hot can youmake your fire?”“Very hot.”“Sophie, how cold a wind can you create?”“Very cold,” she said, nodding. She suddenly knew what her brother wassuggesting: she’d done the same experiment in chemistry class.“Do it now,” Josh shouted.A carved dragon with a chipped bat’s wing lurched forward. Saint-Germainunleashed the full force of his Fire magic against the creature’s head, bathingit in flame, baking it cherry red. And then Sophie let loose a puff of arcticair.The dragon’s head cracked and exploded into dust.“Hot and cold,” Josh shouted, “hot and cold.”“Expansion and contraction,” Nicholas said with a shaky laugh. He looked up towhere Dee’s head was just visible over the edge of the roof. “One of the basicprinciples of alchemy.”Saint-Germain bathed a boar galloping toward them in scalding heat, and Sophiewashed icy air over it. Its legs snapped off.“Hotter!” Josh shouted. “It needs to be hotter. And yours need to be colder,” hesaid to his sister.“I’ll try,” she whispered. Her eyes were already leaden with exhaustion. “Idon’t know how much more I can do.” She looked at her brother. “Help me,” shesaid. “Let me draw on your strength.”Josh stood behind Sophie and placed both hands on her shoulders. Silver and goldauras sparked alight, mixing, entwining. Realizing what they were doing, Joanimmediately gripped her husband’s shoulders and both their auras—red andsilver—crackled around them. When Saint-Germain shot a plume of fire over theapproaching gargoyles, it was white-hot, strong enough to start melting thestones even before subarctic freezing winds and icy fog rolled from Sophie’shands. Saint-Germain turned in a slow circle, and Sophie followed him. Firststone cracked, ancient brick exploded, and rock melted beneath the intense heat,but when the icy winds followed, the effect was dramatic. The hot stone statuesexploded and split apart, shattering into gritty, stinging dust. The first rowfell, and then the next and the next, until a wall of shattered and crackedstone built up in a circle around the trapped humans.And when Saint-Germain and Joan slumped, Sophie and Josh continued, blasting icyair over the few remaining creatures. Because the gargoyles had spent centuriesas water spouts, the stone was soft and porous. Using her brother’s energy toboost her powers, Sophie froze the moisture trapped within the stone and thecreatures shattered.“The two that are one,” Nicholas Flamel whispered, crouching exhausted on thecobblestones. He looked at Sophie and Josh, their auras blazing wildly aboutthem, silver and gold intermixed, traces of ancient armor visible against theirskin. Their power was incredible—and seemingly inexhaustible. He knew that powerlike this could control, reshape or even destroy the world.And as the last monstrous gargoyle exploded to dust and the twins’ auras fadedaway, the Alchemyst found himself wondering for the first time if Awakening themhad been the correct decision.image [images/Scot_9780375849084_epub_002_r1.jpg]On top of Notre Dame, Dee and Machiavelli watched as Flamel and the otherspicked their way through the smoking piles of masonry, heading in the directionof the bridge.“We are in so much trouble,” Machiavelli said through gritted teeth. The arrowhad disappeared from his thigh, but his leg was still numb.“We?” Dee said lightly. “This, all this, is entirely your fault, Niccolò. Or atleast, that’s what my report will say. And you know what will happen then, don’tyou?”Machiavelli straightened and stood, leaning against the stonework, favoring hisinjured leg. “My report will differ.”“No one will believe you,” Dee said confidently, turning away. “Everyone knowsyou are the master of lies.”Machiavelli reached into his pocket and pulled out a small digital taperecorder. “Well then, it’s lucky I have everything you said on tape.” He tappedthe recorder. “Voice activated. It recorded every word you spoke to me.”Dee stopped. He slowly turned to face the Italian and looked at the slender taperecorder. “Every word?” he asked.“Every word.” Machiavelli said grimly. “I think the Elders will believe myreport.”Dee stared at the Italian for a heartbeat before nodding. “What do you want?”Machiavelli nodded at the devastation below. His smile was terrifying. “Look atwhat the twins can do…and they’re barely Awakened, and not even fully trained.”“What are you suggesting?” Dee asked.“Between us, you and I have access to extraordinary resources. Workingtogether—rather than against one another—we should be able to find the twins,capture them and train them.”“Train them!”Machiavelli’s eyes started to glitter. “They are the twins of legend. ‘The twothat are one, the one that is all.’ Once they’ve mastered all the elementalmagics, they will be unstoppable.” His smile turned feral. “Whoever controlsthem controls the world.”The Magician turned to squint across the square to where Flamel was just visiblethrough the pall of dust and grit. “You think the Alchemyst knows this?”Machiavelli’s laugh was bitter. “Of course he knows. Why else do you think he’straining them!”"},{"pageContent":"MONDAY,4th June"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVEAt precisely 12:13, the Eurostar train pulled out of Gare du Nord station andbegan the two-hour-twenty-minute journey into London’s St. Pancras InternationalStation.Nicholas Flamel sat facing Sophie and Josh across a table in Business PremierClass. Saint-Germain had bought the tickets using an untraceable credit card andhad supplied them with French passports that came complete with photographs thatlooked nothing like the twins, while Nicholas’s passport photograph was that ofa young man with a full head of jet-black hair. “Tell them you’ve aged a lot inthe past few years,” Saint-Germain said with a grin. Joan of Arc had spent themorning shopping and had presented Sophie and Josh each with a backpack filledwith clothes and toiletries. When Josh had opened his, he’d discovered the smalllaptop Saint-Germain had given him the day before. Was it only yesterday? Itseemed so long ago.Nicholas spread out the newspapers as the train left the station and pulled on apair of cheap reading glasses he’d bought at a drugstore. He held up Le Monde sothat the twins could see the front page; it carried a picture of the devastationcaused by Nidhogg.“It says here,” Nicholas read slowly, “that a section of the catacombscollapsed.” He turned the page. There was a half-page picture of piles ofshattered stone in the roped-off square before Notre Dame Cathedral. “‘Expertsare claiming that the collapse and disintegration of some of Paris’s most famousgargoyles and grotesques was caused by acid rain that weakened the structures.The two events are unconnected,’” he read, and closed the paper.“So you were right,” Sophie said, exhaustion etched onto her face even thoughshe’d slept for nearly ten hours. “Dee and Machiavelli have managed to cover itup.” She looked out the window as the train click-clacked across a maze ofinterconnecting lines. “A monster walked through Paris yesterday, gargoylesclimbed down off a building…and yet there’s nothing in the papers. It’s like itnever happened.”“But it did happen,” Flamel said seriously. “And you learned the Magic of Fireand Josh’s powers were Awakened. And yesterday you discovered just how powerfulthe two of you are together.”“And Scathach died,” Josh said bitterly.The blank look of surprise on Flamel’s face confused and annoyed Josh. He lookedat his sister, then back at Nicholas. “Scatty,” he said angrily. “Remember her?She was drowned in the Seine.”“Drowned?” Flamel smiled, and the new lines at the corners of his eyes andacross his forehead deepened. “She’s a vampire, Josh,” he said gently. “Shedoesn’t need to breathe air. I’ll bet she was mad, though; she hates gettingwet,” he added. “Poor Dagon: he didn’t stand a chance.” He sank back into thecomfortable seat and closed his eyes. “We’ve one brief stop to make outsideLondon, then we’ll use the map of the ley lines to get back to San Francisco,and Perenelle.”“Why are we going to England?” Josh asked.“We’re going to see the oldest immortal human in the world,” the Alchemyst said.“I’m going to try and persuade him to train you both in the Magic of Water.”“Who is it?” Josh asked, reaching for his laptop. The first-class carriages hada wireless network.“Gilgamesh the King.” End of Book Two"},{"pageContent":"AUTHOR’S NOTETHE CATACOMBS OF PARISThe Catacombs of Paris that Sophie and Josh explore really exist, as does theextraordinary sewer system, which comes, as Machiavelli observes, complete withstreet signs. Although Paris receives millions of visitors a year, many areunaware of the vast network of tunnels below the city.Officially, they are called “les carrières de Paris,” the quarries of Paris, butthey are commonly called the catacombs, and they are one of the wonders of thecity. The sights the twins encounter in the catacombs—the walls of bones, thespectacular arrangements of skulls—are open to the public. They date to theeighteenth century, when all the bodies and bones in the overflowing Cimetièredes Innocents were exhumed and transported to the limestone tunnels and caverns.More bodies from other cemeteries followed, and it is now estimated that thereare as many as seven million bodies in this bizarre graveyard. No one knows whocreated the extraordinary and artistic arrangements of bones; perhaps a workmanwanted to fashion a monument to the dead who would no longer have tombstones tomark their graves. The walls, made entirely of human bones, many inset with apattern of skulls, are suitably eerie and, in some cases, have been lit fordramatic effect.The Romans were probably the first to quarry limestone from the ground to buildwhat would become Lutetia, the earliest Roman settlement on the Ile de la Cité.Where Notre Dame Cathedral now stands, there was once a monument to the Romangod Jupiter. From about the tenth century onward, limestone was extensivelymined from the quarries to create the city walls and to build Notre Dame and theoriginal Louvre palace. The catacombs have long been used for storage bysmugglers and have provided shelter for many homeless. More recently, both theGerman army and the French Resistance had bases in the tunnels during World WarII. In this century, illegal art galleries and even a movie theater have beenfound deep underground by the cataflics, the police unit who patrol underground.Officially, the catacombs are called the Ossuary of Denfert Rochereau, and theentrance is directly across from the Denfert Rochereau Metro station. Only asmall section is open to the public; the tunnels are treacherous, narrow, andprone to flooding and are riddled with potholes and wells.And are the ideal hiding place for a Sleeping God.image [images/Scot_9780375849084_epub_003_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":" A special preview of THESORCERESS Book Three ofimage [images/Scot_9780375849084_epub_004_r1.jpg] Excerpt copyright © 2008 by Michael ScottPublished by Delacorte Press I am tired now, so tired.And I am aging fast. There is a stiffness in my joints, my sight is no longersharp and I find I have to strain to hear. Over the past five days I have beenforced to use my powers, and that has speeded the aging process. I estimate thatI have aged by at least a decade—perhaps more—since last Thursday. If I am tolive, I have to retrieve the Book of Abraham, and I cannot—I dare not—risk usingmy powers.But Dee has the Codex, and I know that I will be forced yet again to use mywaning aura.We are about to enter London. I fear this city above all others, for it is atthe very heart of Dee’s power. London has attracted Elders from across theglobe: there are more of them in this city than in any other on earth. Eldersand Next Generation move freely and unnoticed through the streets, and I know ofat least a dozen Shadowrealms scattered across the British Isles. The last timePerenelle and I were in this city, in September 1666, the Magician almost burnedit to the ground trying to capture us. We’ve never been back.However, a great number of ley lines meet and converge over these Celtic lands,and I pray that with the twins’ Awakened powers, we can use those lines toreturn to San Francisco and my Perenelle.And here too is Gilgamesh the King, the oldest immortal human in the world. Hisknowledge is incalculable and encyclopedic. It is said that he was once theguardian of the Codex, that he even knew the mythical Abraham who created theBook. Gilgamesh also knows all the elemental magics, though strangely, he neverpossessed the power to use them. The King has no aura. I’ve often wondered whatthat must be like: to be aware of so many incredible things, to have access tothe wisdom of the ancients…and yet be unable to use it.I have told Sophie and Josh that I need Gilgamesh to train them in the Magic ofWater and find us a ley line that will take us home. What they do not know isthat it is a desperate gamble: if the King refuses, then we will be trapped inthe very heart of Dee’s domain, with no possibility of escape.Nor have I told them that Gilgamesh is quite, quite insane.From the Day Booke of Nicholas Flamel, AlchemystWrit this day, Monday, 4th June,in London, the city of my enemiesMONDAY,4th JuneCHAPTER ONE“I think I see them.”The young man in the green parka standing directly beneath the huge circularclock in St. Pancras station took the phone away from his ear and checked ablurred image on the screen. The English Magician had sent the image: thepicture was grainy, the colors washed and faded, and it looked liked it had beentaken from an overhead security camera. It showed an older man with short grayhair, accompanied by two blond-haired teens, climbing onto a train.Rising up on his toes, the young man swiveled his head, looking for the triohe’d glimpsed. For a moment, he thought he’d lost them in the milling crowd, buteven if he had, they wouldn’t get far: one of his sisters was downstairs;another was in the street outside, watching the entrance.Now, where had the old man and the teenagers gone?Narrow, pinched nostrils opened wide as the young man sorted through thecountless scents in the station. He identified and dismissed the mixed stink oftoo many humani, the myriad perfumes and deodorants, the gels and pastes, thegreasy odor of fried food from the station’s restaurants, the richer aroma ofcoffee and the metallic oily tang of the train engines and carriages. He closedhis eyes and tilted his head back. The odors he was seeking were older, wilder,unnatural….There!Mint: just the merest suggestion.Orange: no more than the vaguest hint.Vanilla: little more than a trace.Hidden behind small rectangular sunglasses, blue-black eyes opened wide and hishead swiveled, following the gossamer threads of scent through the vast trainstation. He had them now!The gray-haired older man, wearing black jeans and a scuffed leather jacket, wasstriding down the station concourse directly toward him. There was a smallovernight case in his left hand. He was followed by the two teenagers, alikeenough to be brother and sister. The boy was taller than the girl, and they wereboth wearing backpacks.The young man snapped a quick picture with his cell phone camera and sent it toDr. John Dee. Although he had nothing but contempt for the English Magician,there was no point in making an enemy of him. Dee was the agent of the mostdangerous of all the Elders.Pulling the hood of his parka over his head, he turned away as the trio drewlevel with him, and dialed his sister, who was waiting downstairs. “It’sdefinitely Flamel and the twins,” he murmured into the phone, speaking theancient language that had eventually become Gaelic. “They’re heading in yourdirection. We’ll take them when they get onto the Euston Road.”The young man in the hooded parka set off after the Alchemyst and the Americantwins. He moved easily through the early-afternoon crowd, looking like justanother teenager, anonymous and unnoticed in his sloppy jeans, scuffed sneakersand overlarge coat, his head and face concealed by the hood, his eyes invisiblebehind the sunglasses.Despite his form, the young man had never been remotely human. He and hissisters had first come to this land when it was still joined to the Europeancontinent, and for generations they had been worshipped as gods. He bitterlyresented being ordered about by Dee—who was, after all, nothing more than ahumani. But the English Magician had promised the hooded boy a delectable prize:Nicholas Flamel, the legendary Alchemyst. Dee’s instructions were clear; he andhis sisters could have Flamel, but the twins must not be touched. The boy’s thinlips twisted. His sisters would take the boy and girl, while he would have thehonor of killing Flamel. A coal-black tongue licked cracked dry lips. He and hissisters would feast for weeks. And, of course, they would keep the tastiestmorsels for Mother. Nicholas Flamel slowed, allowing Sophie and Josh to catch up with him. Forcing asmile, he pointed to the thirty-foot-tall bronze statue of a couple embracingbeneath the clock. “It’s called The Meeting Place,” he said loudly, and thenadded in a whisper, “We’re being followed.” Flamel grasped Josh’s arm withiron-hard fingers. “Don’t even think about turning around.”“Who?” Sophie asked.“What?” Josh said tightly. He was feeling nauseated; his newly Awakened senseswere overwhelmed by the scents and sounds of the train station. The light was sosharp he wished he had a pair of sunglasses to shield his eyes.“‘What?’ is the better question,” Nicholas said grimly. He raised a finger topoint up to the clock, as if he were talking about it. “I’m not sure what itis,” he admitted. “Something ancient. I felt it the moment we stepped off thetrain.”“Felt it?” Josh asked.“A tingle, like an itch. My aura reacted to the aura of whoever—whatever—ishere. When you have a little more control of your own auras, you’ll be able todo the same.”Tilting her head back, as if she were admiring the latticework of themetal-and-glass ceiling, Sophie slowly turned. Crowds swirled around them. Mostseemed to be locals, though there were plenty of tourists, many stopping to havetheir photographs taken in front of The Meeting Place or the huge clock. No oneseemed to be paying them any particular attention.“What can we do?” Josh asked. “I can boost Sophie’s powers….”“No,” Flamel snapped. “You can only use your powers as an absolute last resort.As soon as you activate your aura, it will alert every Elder, Next Generationand immortal within a ten-mile radius, and here, just about every immortal youencounter is allied to the Dark Elders. Also, in this land, it could awakenothers, creatures best left sleeping.”“But you said we’re being followed,” Sophie protested. “That means Dee knowswe’re here.”Flamel urged the twins to the left, away from the statue, hurrying them towardthe exit. “I would imagine there are watchers in every airport, seaport andrailway station across Europe. Although Dee might have suspected that we wereheading to London, the instant either of you activates your aura, he’ll know forcertain.”“And what will he do then?” Josh asked, turning to look at Flamel. In the harshoverhead light, the new lines on the Alchemyst’s forehead and around his eyeswere clearly visible.Flamel shrugged. “Who knows what he is capable of doing? He is desperate, anddesperate men do terrible things. Remember, he was on top of Notre Dame. He nowhas some inkling of your powers; he’s also confirmed that you are the twins oflegend. He has to have you.” The Alchemyst reached out and poked Josh in thechest. Paper rustled. Beneath his T-shirt, in a cloth bag hanging around hisneck, Josh carried the two pages he’d torn from the Codex. “And, above all else,he must have these pages.”They followed the signs for the Euston Road exit and were swept along by a crowdof commuters heading in the same direction. “I thought you said there would besomeone to meet us,” Sophie said.“Saint-Germain said he’d try and contact an old friend,” Flamel muttered. “Maybehe couldn’t get in touch.”They stepped out of the ornate redbrick station onto Euston Road and stopped insurprise. When they’d left Paris nearly three hours ago, the skies had beencloudless, the temperature already creeping into the high sixties; but in Londonit was raining hard, and the wind whipping down the road was cold enough to makethe twins shiver. They turned and immediately ducked back into the shelter ofthe station.And that was when Sophie saw him.“A boy in a green parka, with the hood pulled up,” she said suddenly, turning toNicholas and concentrating fiercely on his pale eyes, knowing that if she lookedaway, she would involuntarily glance at the young man who had been hurryingafter them. She could see him from the corner of her eye. He was loitering closeto a pillar, staring at the cell phone in his hand, fiddling with it. There wassomething wrong about the way he was standing. Something unnatural. And shethought she caught the faintest taint of spoiled meat in the air.The smile on the Alchemyst’s face grew strained. “Wearing a hood? Yes, that’swho’s been following us.” The twins caught the faintest tremor in his voice.“Except he’s not a boy, is he?” Sophie asked.Nicholas shook his head. “Not even close.”Josh took a deep breath. “So—should I point out that I can see two more peoplewearing green hooded parkas, and they’re both heading in our direction?”“Three! No, not them,” Flamel whispered in horror. “We’ve got to go.” Grabbingthe twins’ arms, he pulled them out into the driving rain, turned to the rightand dragged them down the street.The rain was so cold it took Josh’s breath away. Pellets of hard water stung hisface. “Who are they?” he demanded, blinking water from his eyes, brushing hishair back out of his face.“The Hooded Ones,” the Alchemyst said bitterly. “Dee must be desperate, and morepowerful than I thought if he can command them. They are the Genii Cucullati.”Sophie shivered as memories suddenly flickered at the edges of herconsciousness. She felt something sour at the back of her throat, and herstomach twisted in disgust. The Witch of Endor had known the Genii Cucullati…andshe had loathed them. Sophie looked sidelong at her brother. “Flesh-eaters.”"},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe list grows ever longer, but The Magician would not have happened without thesupport of so many people… Krista Marino, Beverly Horowitz, Jocelyn Lange and Christine Labov at DelacortePress, without whose help, patience, perseverance… Barry Krost at BKM and Frank Weimann at the Literary Group, for continuedsupport and advice… A particular mention must go to: Libby Lavella, who gave Perenelle a voice… Sarah Baczewski, who gives the best notes… Jeromy Robert, who created the image… Michael Carroll, who reads it first and last… And finally there are: Claudette, Brooks, Robin, Mitch, Chris, Elaine, David, Judith, Trista, Cappy,Andrea, Ron and, of course, Ahmet, for everything else!
