At first, it was simply so I could sleep at night. It was a way to marshal the extraordinary facts and histories that constantly rotated in my mind and became graphically alive at bedtime! Now I think my reason is to restore, in a humble way, richness to the mystery tradition at a time when the old arts of the philosopher are all but lost. There are many paths to the mysteries. The most predominant organizations in western societies are usually composed of people we might call literalists. They would not like the more accurate label of anti- philosophers. Literalists believe their traditional histories are unique, explain everything and provide enough wisdom to make the rest of civilization irrelevant. Usually, they treat their stories as fact rather than myth and rarely think about it any further. These people often join many societies; yet groan at the mention of a lecture. Archeology provides them interesting asides but discoveries are rarely important enough to change the faith. Then there are capital P and small p philosophers. Capital P philosophers deride literalists and small p philosophers alike as fundamentalists , a dirty word. These capital P philosophers know all myths are just that, myths without a historical basis. Unless archeology proves something happened then it did not, and the myth is just a story having no more merit than a fairy-tale. This book is for the small p or Gnostic philosophers who have a bit each way when it comes to myth. They see myth as having merit and are not surprised when archeologists discover a Troy, or if they hear a story in the Bible is proved true. Most think that Atlantis will eventually be located. Small p philosophers see myths representing important elements of culture and if not based on facts then often based on soft facts . One such soft fact is alchemy. Its goal is the Philosophers’ Stone. This book traces the chemistry and philosophy of the Philosophers’ Stone from first dynasty Egypt and Mesopotamia through the Commagene region of Turkey, to Israel, France and England. It particularly focuses on mystery religions and philosophical schools that co-existed over thousands of years. The keys to understanding the Commagene region are metallurgy and alchemy. There is a remarkably close connection between metals, alchemy, perhaps the true Holy Grail and many esoteric traditions of the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 2 Israelites, Freemasons and Rosicrucians. Surprisingly, these traditions are once again contributing to leaps in modern medicine and industrial technology. Many will see the topics in this book as forbidden territory. Even today, in this age of science, the subjects of alchemy and mystery religion remain fused with intolerance. It is only in today’s postmodern western democracies, freed from religious oppression, superstition and master theories that we can listen to the cacophony of simultaneous voices without declaring enemies or being declared an enemy. Throughout history, many lives have been lost in pursuit of the illusive Philosophers' Stone. Few have found the wisdom to truly behold it because it is a process and not an end in itself. The reader should therefore regard this book as a philosophical base station at the foot of the highest mountain of Wisdom. It seeks to understand the philosophy of alchemy, its peculiar chemistry and the surprising and pervasive role it has played in the development of human culture through the mystery religions. In a sense, alchemy has come full circle since translation of the great Arabic texts into Latin in the tenth century CE. Alchemy was the precursor to chemistry and pharmaceuticals. Now the sciences of chemistry, physics and information are on the threshold of making the hidden benefits of alchemy widely available. David Hudson, a farmer from Phoenix, Arizona, has been carrying out technical research into the Philosophers' Stone for two decades. His work has helped galvanize many of the themes in this book. Hudson’s influence is everywhere through this work as much as that of Robert Graves and Sir Karl Popper. 1 Stephen Skinner’s excellent book Lapidus – In Pursuit of Gold also proves to be a treasure on alchemy. The author would also like to thank Tom Simms of New Brunswick, Canada, for his discussion of the New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period in Egypt. Tom’s research has assisted dating the Exodus in Chapter 5. The author is very grateful to Robert Word, of San Francisco, for his excellent translation of the Triangular Manuscript of St Germain, the only translation known to exist. Turning to perhaps the most intensively investigated region in the world, Egypt and Syro-Palestine, we find modern archeology has not yet conclusively unraveled their chronologies. Of the many difficulties encountered by archeology, none is more confusing than the Biblical use of archetypes. An archetype is a model, projected paragon or ideal."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 3 Archetypes in old stories are not literal. Authors apply the technique in a midrashic sense. 2 Compound characters display all the traits that the author seeks to convey to the reader. Some aspects of the characterization are indeed fact but others merely fantasy. Historical archetypes often play a role in many eras, sometimes under alternative names. Closely associated with the issue of archetypes is the art of double meanings or entendres. Dual and even poly-meanings give rise to a phenomenon called hermetic drift . Umberto Eco has spent much of his career in teaching and writing about hermetic drift. He argues that the hermetic tradition underlying much alchemical literature relies on physical similitude . This means that everything is similar and closely related to everything else. These relationships are inexhaustible and include every element of this world and heaven. Deliberately and with considerable delight, authors in the sacred arts of alchemy use Hermetic Drift to slip from similarity to similarity and meaning to meaning. The content of every expression and symbol becomes a further enigma, more mysterious than the previous one and the ultimate meaning is inevitably postponed. Linguistics and symbols entangle the whole subject. The esoteric elite smugly escape analysis and criticism. As a result, their theories are never testable and have very low levels of dependability, known as verisimilitude . At the end of it all, the content can often be an empty secret or something time has otherwise reduced to common knowledge. Presenting written ideas for positive and constructive criticism is relatively modern. While many Jewish authors showed admirable candor in post-Medieval times, Western authors were far more clandestine. They had little accountability and were economic with the truth. The extensive use of Hermetic Drift in the West means we can only understand their slippery allegories with good humor, healthy skepticism and a few traditional tools such as Occam's Razor. The English philosopher William Occam developed Occam's Razor in about 1310CE to cope with archetypes and hermetic drift . His principle of economy in logic simply states that the smallest number of entities achieves the best theory. The principle demands categorization of theories for maximum impact. This increases the probability of truth, or verisimilitude . A good theory has predictive value while a poor theory can explain everything but predict nothing. Limiting the number of entities usually helps to collapse a large number of threads into a"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 4 surprisingly small number of themes that can more readily be cross- vectored to hook a new theory from the pool of conflict and plurality. Mathematically this is the pattern recognition process of cluster and factor analysis in statistics. A top-down, helicopter view overcomes the problem of being unable to see the forest because the trees are in the way. Occam's helicopter, rises above the trees to see the forest and even the pattern of light in its glades. Occam's helicopter will be very useful to us throughout this book because our aim is physical, chemical, mathematical and social analysis rather than description. Notwithstanding the conciseness of this analytical approach, the reader may correctly perceive the method of Occam’s Razor, applied to the arcane characteristics of alchemy, rambles around the subject. The author has tried to keep a traditional approach to the issues but the labyrinth ahead will be a challenge with chapter headings that seem more for convenience than classification. Be of good heart because it promises to be a grand tour of life, death, the universe and everything, at least as far as we know it. Sadly, the author cannot promise packaged Wisdom from the journey, only that the reader will pass by many sites where it is possible to begin the process of discovery. The reader will need to work quite hard to recognize Wisdom for his or herself. Whether in alchemy or the mysteries, practical involvement is the key to Wisdom. The alchemists would say Ora et labora , or God through Labor . It remains for the reader to choose any of the many practical possibilities. This book meticulously references sources of information wherever possible. While some of these references are unconventional and present hypotheses that lead in radically different directions, the work of these authors broadens the scope and spectrum of understanding and provides many useful insights. Advancement of knowledge in the kaleidoscopic environment of esoteric philosophy and mysteries is perilous. The cardinal rule is that evidence must always exist for any hypothesis. The main purpose of this book is to assemble and cross-vector arcane knowledge in a new way, to underpin a new and better understanding of the subject. As in a court of law, some evidence is more reliable than other evidence. The author will attempt to warn in advance of the more contentious areas. All errors are of course the author's responsibility alone. The author hopes that any minor aberrations will not obstruct the reader from grasping the richness of alchemy in its historical context."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 5 The great alchemist Zosimus said that everyone should have a book of chemistry.

The pages of my life, I have cast, on the great millwheel of fortune. In my hunt for the golden crown, I have sought clues, in labours long and wide. I am resolute in my dangerous pursuit. Dangerous you laugh? Yes, I say, for Wisdom is demanding. She does not release her captives readily, but demands inconsiderate labor in searching her ciphers. So as the millwheel turns, I entrust myself between the columns where the University of Antiquity awaits. There I am sure the dance of the labyrinth will lead me to the emerald city. And Ariadne's silken thread, woven from chains of light, will support my journey to the midnight sun. The turn of the millwheel has brought me luck, I cast again... ...God goes with the brave. The alchemical Philosophers' Stone is the main subject of this book. It has many names including the Elixir of Life , occult gold , manna and dew . For thousands of years the knowledge of this marvelous Stone has been the sole province of mystical brotherhoods including Egyptian Priests and Pharaohs, Melchizedek Priests, Arabian Schools, Rabbis, Kabbalahists, Indian Yogis, Rosicrucians, Freemasons and lone Jewish alchemists. The subject embodies a mix of religion and politics that has fermented throughout history, occasionally erupting. The earliest traces we have of this are with first dynasty Egyptian Pharaohs. The trail tracks the devastating Hyksos invasion of Egypt and the Exodus of the Children of Israel from Egypt. Ancient sanctuaries such as Harran and Jerusalem emerge as warehouses of arcane knowledge. So esoteric is the knowledge that it is from lone Jewish alchemists, who perhaps knew the least that we learn the most. Jewish scholars persistently worked at alchemy and around tenth century CE translated the great medical and alchemical treatises of the Arabic world. In looking at the Philosophers' Stone, we have cause to"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 7 refer to the Old and New Testaments of the Bible and the Jewish Zohar as particularly fine mystical records. From the sanctuary of Harran, there was a transfer of alchemy and metallurgy to Islamic Sufism. During the Italian Renaissance, the same knowledge became available from Constantinople through the enthusiastic acquisition of manuscripts by Cosimo de Medici. From Renaissance Italy, it made its way to Britain where the Elizabethans received it enthusiastically. Ancient Harran generated chains of alchemy and architecture. These led through French cathedral building to the definition of Scottish and English Freemasonry. Links in the chain include the Phoenician Dionysian Artificers , the Roman Collegia , the Magistri Comacini of Como and the Compagnonnage . From Jerusalem, the Jewish stream split into the Rabbinical Kabbalahists of the city of Alexandria, the Qumran Essenes and the Gnostics. The Alexandrian stream spilled into Greece, Spain and Ireland where it appears to have all but petered-out. The Essene stream ended abruptly with the total Roman suppression of Jewish nationalism in the first and second centuries CE. Yet, there are faint but intriguing lines of survival of Melchizedek Priests in the Diaspora of Southern France through to today. The Roman Catholic Church suppressed both the Gnostic stream and the Great Heresy of the Bogomils. The former culminated with the Albigensian Crusade and violent assault on Montségur in 1245CE. Yet, again, stories emerged from the Inquisition that four Parfaits smuggled the Cathars' treasure to safety. 3 Another chain commences around 1128CE with discoveries by the Knights Templar in Jerusalem. Sheltered in Scotland after their dissolution, the Knights Templar traditions fused into Scottish guilds of the Compagnonnage and later into English Freemasonry. Subsequently the German Rosicrucians fled to the protection of James I of England during the Thirty Years War in the early 1600s. From there, the Rosicrucians developed a very close affinity with English Freemasonry. They were to amalgamate with the upper degrees of Freemasonry, bringing organizational structure to the whole movement. Alchemy has fundamentally influenced Western society, particularly in medicine and religion. In religion, for example, the Eucharist ceremony symbolizes alchemy. We find the rituals of the Roman Catholic Church, involving the congregation as the living church"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 8 in a yearly cycle, embody the complex symbolism of alchemy and the Mysteries. Yet, the infamous Faustian objectives of unbelievable wealth and the Elixir of Life have also kindled the worst of human greed and avarice. The outcome was often disastrous for all involved. Loss of money, counterfeiting, swindles and murder. As a result, alchemy’s daughter, Science, led the world to believe that she had abandoned the pursuits of her mother in the sixteenth century. However, chemistry, physics, metallurgy, medicine and pharmaceuticals all flourished. This book analyses the closely related development of alchemical metals and glass technology from the earliest known practices in Anatolia, Syro-Palestine and Egypt. The Sabians of Harran and Yemen, and the Melchizedek priests of Jerusalem contribute a great deal. Using knowledge from Hermetic philosophy, we investigate the wet method of alchemy to find the green and lilac Philosophers' Stones. The importance of Light and Dew emerges from many diverse sources such as garden roses, the orders of Rosicrucians and the historical milieu of the Knights Templars. We find that the Ancient of Days could be much more than a vision of Ezekiel. The romances of the Holy Grail integrate all of our knowledge of the Philosophers' Stone into a consummate whole. Yet, our historical background can never be more than informed conjecture based on abundant circumstantial evidence. Considerable Jewish evidence is contained in the Bible and Kabbalah, both of which are deeply mystical and archetypal. Even these sources have more objective coherence than those of the other major group, the Rosicrucian descendants of the Indo-Hittites. The Rosicrucians prized oral over written tradition and have kept almost no records. The Elizabethan canons of literature are prominent exceptions. A new, modern element has abruptly changed this duopoly of knowledge. Whitegold , the modern Philosophers' Stone, now exists as a scientific fact. Many countries even granted patents. Whitegold spans the gulf of physical credibility in alchemy and integrates biblical mysticism with the oral traditions of the Rosicrucians. It is the one and only tangible element in a sea of subjective cleverness. The chapters that follow build on this newfound bridge of understanding. Four major theories integrate this work. These are the dynamics of population interfaces in the Crucibles of Humanity , the emergence of the Israelite race, their early homeland aspirations and the ancient heritage"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 9 of the Philosophers' Stone. The Knights Templar rediscovered the ancient Jewish heritage while the Rosicrucian heritage flows from the Indo- Hittites and more particularly the Indo-Iranians. The establishment of the Israelites has traditionally been a controversial subject for scholars. This book presents a new theory. This is that the unique characteristics of the Israelites arose in the east of Bronze Age Anatolia. Here the two great language groups of the world, the Indo-Hittites and the Afro-Asiatics, were culturally compressed or fused. 4 The outcome was a unique people with interwoven cultures. The Alchemy Key unlocks the door to this Anatolian cultural compression. Inside we find answers to many questions preserved by different groups throughout the millennia. Chapter 4 presents a new theory of the Crucibles of Humanity, which encompasses the most modern understandings of population movements in history from biological analysis. This book increases the understanding of our rich heritage. In solving esoteric mysteries, we can appreciate the underlying themes in many religions. Ultimately, the strength of this book lies in delineating physical as well as philosophical advances. Whitegold is with us and the medical and technological possibilities are breathtaking. There are at least three ways to read this book. The traditional linear way, front to back, past to present, is the journey of an Adept. To reach the end of the book it is best to defer exploring the many diverging sidetracks that entice one from the main path. Those seeking mystery and surprise might instead sample what is on offer by simply opening the book at random. Finally, the thoroughly modern reader might prefer instant knowledge rather than Wisdom, by reading the first chapter and then all the others in reverse order. We begin our journey with modern alchemy, and then plunge into understanding alchemy’s role in the history of society. Humans have a unique ability to think about their own thought. To understand the shared belief systems of history is to understand the meaning of life as conceived by man. We are really taking a unique cut through the belief systems, power structures and objective disputation mechanisms that constitute culture.

I have just made the Philosophers’ Stone in a crystal wine glass. The High Priest Melchizedek might have felt the same awe, when he first made the Philosophers’ Stone around 2000BCE. Have you seen the sculpture of him at Chartres Cathedral, welcoming initiates at the North Entrance, beneath the Rose Window. This is the famous Gate of the Initiates. He’s there, along with Aaron, David and Solomon, holding a goblet containing the Philosophers’ Stone. The Melchizedek Priests at the Temple of Jerusalem were adepts in many aspects of the chemistry of gold. It strikes me now how easily they could have made shrewbread, manna or whitebread just as I have, scooping Jordan River water from the Brazen Sea in front of the Temple, then mixing it with alkali from a bowl to create the Philosophers’ Stone in a golden bowl. 6 Yes, right then and there because it doesn’t take more than a few minutes. I have the advantage of pure chemicals, but I too use the Jordan water or rather reconstituted Dead Sea. The Jordan River and salts from the Dead Sea are hugely prospective for making the Philosophers’ Stone. In fact, they are ten times better than other seawater, and considered especially good because they do not seem to have the poisonous heavy metal precipitate called a Gilcrest Precipitate. Actually, any seawater, from well under the surface, will also do, especially if you are near an undersea vent. It is said that a skilled alchemist can even make the Stone repeatedly from the same bucket of water. I made my Philosophers’ Stone by heating Dead Sea water and then titrating it with Sodium Hydroxide to form a precipitate at about pH 8.5, drawing-off the salt water with a syringe and washing the precipitate a few times with distilled water. As it settled in the bottom of the wine glass, my precipitate looked just like Melchizedek’s stone. I gazed at my precipitate, knowing that the thirty-day Egyptian rite of passage required five hundred milligrams of this substance per day. My stone is probably seventy percent gold and thirty percent magnesium hydroxide, which is Milk of Magnesia. I can isolate the gold if I want to, by drying the precipitate to a powder and then mixing it with"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 12 hydrochloric acid. Anything that does not dissolve is the pure manna or Philosophers’ Stone. Alchemy using dissolved elements is simple and effective. It differs from the Great Work because it starts with water already containing the necessary elements. Traditional alchemists would consider it the lightweight end of the Art. The Great Work focused on the reverse direction, converting metallic gold into the Philosophers’ Stone. For the ancients this involved three major technological hurdles. The first was to make a solvent for gold. No easy achievement. The second hurdle was to eliminate the impure elements, particularly Nitrogen, introduced in dissolving the gold. The third major hurdle was to create a gold chloride that could be dissolved in water. When the gold dissolves, we have potable gold, or gold that can ingested to purify the body. It was said that with this Elixir of Youth , the old could become young again; and life could be extended to at least the natural limit of one hundred and twenty years. After all, the Bible said that Melchizedek, the King of Salem, who first possessed the Philosophers’ Stone, would live forever. I mentioned that dissolving metallic gold was no easy matter. Alchemists needed a Secret Fire. They created nitric acid by reacting ammonium chloride or sal ammoniac, the Salt of Ammon, with niter or potassium nitrate. Many chemists would be surprised to know that in antiquity priests distilled ammonia from dung, bones and horns at the Temple of Amun in Libya. The name ammonium even derives from the Egyptian deity, Amun. Egyptian Priests used this in their chemical works at their nearby Temple of Amun in the Oasis of Siwa in Egypt. Nitric and hydrochloric acids were combined to form Aqua Regia , that unique combination of oxidizing and non-oxidizing acids that together can dissolve metallic gold. Nitric acid is amongst the most dangerous of substances to work with. This acid blinded many alchemists, or they met a painful respiratory end from the fumes, splashes and spills. Many inadvertently created poisons or explosives. Fulminating gold and silver are highly unstable explosives, quite probably the deadly Shamir . Many military devices use fulminate of Mercury as a detonator. Once alchemists overcame the issue of dissolving gold, they eliminated troublesome compounds of nitrogen with antimony. The ancients derived antimony from a variety of sources, which they called Prima Materia . Two popular starting points for the Egyptians were the minerals of lead oxide called galena, and tin dioxide called cassiterite."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 13 Antimony was purified with iron or Mars, just as in the modern industrial process of extracting antimony from stibnite ore. When they saw the pure white vapor of antimony rise, the alchemists likened it to a white virgin queen, the moon goddess, and called it the Philosophers’ Mercury. This Mercury should not be confused with metallic Mercury, which is always poisonous if used alchemically. The white virgin indeed brought relief to the injured. A fragrant cream made from a precipitate of antimony became a universal unguent of the alchemist doctors. Crusaders used this salve or universal medicine to heal wounds and it has been used right up until very recent times. The secret ole of antimony was so intriguing that the metal, although very soft and less bright than silver, was often used for tableware such as salt salvers and gravy boats. Adepts could display these openly in public, with few knowing the real meaning of the white virgin in the metal. Finally, Mercury, white virgin of alchemy, was married to the Sun King. A rainbow of colors appeared in the alchemist’s flask. A green dragon battles a Red Man. The blood of the green dragon is the necessary sign that the son of love will be born. Finally, in the faeces of the reaction, a rock appears. It is the green lion tinged with lilac. This royal color signifies Horus rebirth as king. I will not dwell on these celebrated reactions. They can be demonstrated but never scaled-up to any useful volume for medicine or industry. I would now like to turn to another paradigm of alchemy. There is a man in Phoenix Arizona by the name of David Hudson. He recently patented a version of the Philosophers’ Stone called Orbitally Rearranged Mono-atomic Elements (ORMEs) in many countries such as Australia and UK, although the US Defense Department vetoed his patent in the USA on the grounds of national interest. Gold, silver, rhodium, iridium and eight other Transition Elements can exist as ORMEs. ORMEs are virtually undetectable by conventional means because they lack a d-orbital electron. However, they do show a distinguishing infrared doublet located between 1400 and 1600 cm -1 . We tend to focus on gold as the most valuable ORME. Yet, rhodium and iridium may be more important for health applications because they represent five percent of a mammal's brain by dry weight. When referring to ORMEs we are really talking about the Transition Metal complex that includes gold. In other words, ORME technology produces many Philosophers’ Stones from the Transition Metal complex. The end is the same as for the"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 14 Great Work of the alchemists, but it eliminates the prohibitively expensive Precious Metal complex, such as gold and platinum. David Hudson’s process extracts the Transition Metals directly from basic and inexpensive sources such as volcanic rock. These are then processed to potable metals, whose primary uses are in medicine and industrial technology. Take gold for example. Typically, metallic gold extracted from ore is only two percent of the available gold. The other ninety percent is in an ORME state. This provides plenty of potential for technical recovery, or ORMIC recovery. It also has major ramifications for the supply and demand equation in the gold market. Creeping through a wall into a modern alchemist’s cellar laboratory, a colleague and I experimented with David Hudson’s patent method. We dissolved gold in Aqua Regia and then worked straight through for two days and nights. You can see a pH neutralization graph of mine on a web site called Whitegold. Although we were very careful, we could not get past a certain stage. David Hudson merely comments that while his method is written down, the art requires additional knowledge of things like timing, and he is not about to give this away while striving to build a pilot plant. I hope that this discussion of pure chemicals and pilot plants has started to dispel your image of the author as a medieval puffer. The main point I want to get across is that modern alchemy exists as a scientific frontier and that it is very important. Let me tell you just how important it is. Empirical evidence indicates that Hudson’s chloride form of iridium and rhodium ORMEs can cure cancer, pronto. David Hudson believes that gold is associated with the pineal gland, rhodium with the thymus, while iridium seems to relate to the spinal chord and pituitary gland. There is also some anecdotal evidence from non-Hudson sources that a mix of seventy percent rhodium, fifteen percent iridium and fifteen percent gold is the most effective in achieving remission of cancer. The healing process of ORMEs is not one of killing the cancer cells but of denaturing, or simply retarding their action to the point where cancer cells are indistinguishable from normal cells. The cancer no longer shows up on scans. It is still early days but there is considerable work going on under US National Institute of Health Alternative Medicine funding to establish the bona fide of this substance in many"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 15 areas such as breast cancer, AIDS, Lou Geri’s disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and arthritis. Industrially, the great application of ORMEs is as an electrode and catalyst material for fuel cells. In a few years fuel cells are destined to replace batteries in everything from mobile phones to automobiles. The market for fuel cells will be enormous and their use is only being held back by the lack of a suitable electrode material. The special characteristic of ORMEs is that it is a superconductor and therefore suitable as an electrode material. This was in fact the specific basis that the US Defense Department vetoed David Hudson’s US patent application. I would like to end this chapter on a philosophic note because the study of alchemy and philosophy has always gone hand-in-hand. Much of the chemistry of gold and ORMEs can be understood on a purely scientific level, but not yet everything. Some of the thinking is tied-up with the most recent of scientific discoveries such as the behavior of superdeformed nuclei, Cooper pairing, superconducting microclusters, superfluids and Bose Einstein condensates, which were first created in 1995. Nobel Prizes are still being awarded for new learning about this area of science. Yet strangely the ancients seemed to know about it five thousand years ago. I will now suggest a challenge. The complementary way to understand the new science of ORMEs and jump ahead of the scientific frontier is to understand what the ancients knew. This can only be done through a study of classical literature and the culture of religion. Take Shakespeare’s plays the Merchant of Venice, Hamlet and King Lear. The Bible is a great but enigmatic reference. The Jewish Zohar or Book of Splendor is superb, especially that 3% in the Book of the Concealed Mystery and the Greater and Lesser Holy Assembly. Scientific alchemy, for me, is the final piece in the jigsaw. I believe that I have perhaps come closer to understanding the eternal enigma of the meaning of life. I am sure you are wondering if I can make gold. Well, I have not tried, but a number of people I know have and they were successful in plating out gold or electrum, which is a combination of gold and silver. No, its not trickery, but scientific extraction. However, the quantities have been very small. The great alchemist Zosimus said that everyone should have a book of chemistry. I sincerely hope that you will find yours.

He realized with some excitement that he had discovered a repeatable formula. Even better, his formula could be scaled-up from a laboratory to a chemical plant. This was something that had eluded alchemists for at least three thousand years. Hudson's discovery is now a controversial subject at the forefront of pharmaceutical and industrial technologies based on high spin state mono-atomic or single atom elements of iridium, rhodium and gold. He has developed high spin mono-atomic states for many of the transition elements including gold. David Hudson quietly patented his process in England, Australia and other countries around the world. He was unable to do so in the USA. The patent application fell foul of standard US Department of Defense objections relating to superconductivity, a technology of national importance. Another explanation is that the process simply did not work, although this is normally not a basis for rejection. A convenient conspiracy theory is that the US Government realized that Hudson might have rediscovered the Philosophers’ Stone and concluded it was far too important for humanity to allow any individual a patent. An X-Files variation of this conspiracy theory holds that the US military does not want anyone else in control of the substance. David Hudson points out in good humor that his failure to patent the process in the USA at least meant that no one else could. Ultra fine metallic colloids of gold, platinum and silver are one form of pure metals used medicinally. To be effective, these colloid molecules need to have a diameter of between one to ten nanometers. 7 These colloids give rise to some surprising claims. Gold colloids reputedly help the nervous system and relieve depression, anxiety and arthritis. Silver colloids are reputedly effective against over six hundred and fifty viruses, bacteria, fungus and yeasts. Many recommend care with silver because the element can build up in body tissue and become toxic to the bacteria required for normal body function."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 18  Rhodium % Iridium % Monatomics % Cost per Gram (approx.)

For example, flax, almond and apricot oils and grape juice contain both of these elements. Moreover, there is some evidence that carrots and aloe grown in volcanic soil have detectable monatomic rhodium and iridium. Those grown in non-volcanic soil have no natural monatomic elements. There are a number of natural sources of therapeutic substances based on metals. These include a popular powder found in California that comes in various colors, including white. Homeopathic curers claim that clay from a Navajo reservation has special cancer curing properties. Others claim similar remedial properties for dark green aloe leaf essence and Californian Manchurian Mushroom Tea made from Kabuchi or Chinese mushrooms found under pine trees. According to David Hudson, a commercial high-purity aloe is the most concentrated product. It is a freeze-dried polysaccharide powder of juices extracted from Aloe Vera grown on a volcanic island in the Caribbean. The relevant authorities authorized this high-purity Aloe for feline AIDS but not for cancer treatment in humans. In AIDS patients, the thymus is usually shrunken. High-purity aloe in the blood stream seems to increase the white blood cells and T-cells dramatically. The increase in T-cells comes from recovered activity in the thymus, which can grow by forty percent after treatment for one and a half months. 9 The table above shows the percentages of rhodium and iridium elements in some common sources. David Hudson claims that none of these substances has measurable amounts of monatomic gold, the most important element. Following is a Periodic Table showing the Transition Metals thought to have this monatomic capability. David Hudson’s monatomic gold or Whitegold is the scarcest monatomic element. It is thought to be much more active than the other monatomic substances. The material is called Whitegold because it has a modest grey-white color. It is not platinum, which jewelers call whitegold. The technical name for Whitegold is Gold in its Orbitally Rearranged Monatomic Elemental (G-ORME) form. David Hudson’s initial process for its preparation from metallic gold is set out in Appendix 1. The Appendix also contains a modern technical explanation. 10 "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 20 1a 2a 3b 4b 5b 6b 7b 1b 2b 3a 4a 5a 6a 7a 0 H He LiBe BCNOFNe Na Mg Al Si P Se Ci Ar K Ca Sc Ti V Cr Mn Fr Co Ni Cu Zn Ga Ge As Se Br Kr Rb Sr Y Zr NbMoTcRuRhPdAgCd In SnSbTe I Xe Cs Ba La Hf Ta W Re Os Ir Pt Au Hg Tl Pb Bi Po At Rn Fr Ra Ac Rf Ha ? 8 Periodic Table of Elements Transition Elements thought to form ORMES"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 21 Scientists do not yet understand the process by which Whitegold apparently repairs cells. David Hudson hypothesizes that nitric oxide ( NO ) attacks the monatomic atoms in body cells and deactivates them. 11 This causes the aging process and eventually death. As humans, we breathe to live but in doing so we also draw in one percent by volume of nitric oxide. This ages the body and eventually kills us by the process of deactivating monatomic substances in our cells. David Hudson suspects that when a cell dies, the bound monatomic high spin atom falls to low spin by emitting a gamma photon or burst of light due to electron pair annihilation. Nitrogen fourteen in the nitric oxide absorbs this light and converts to radioactive carbon fourteen. This is why living bodies produce radioactive carbon fourteen. The technique of carbon dating uses the knowledge that living cells cease producing carbon when a body dies. Eating monatomic elements in our food such as carrots and grape juice may recharge our system. Ozone and peroxide can also help remove toxins. 12 Yet, the combined effects of recharging and cleansing are insufficient to retard the aging process and so a natural life ends at about eighty years of age. David Hudson believes that Whitegold is unique among the monatomic elements because it is able to correct DNA deficiencies by a denaturing process. He hypothesizes that eating larger doses of monatomic elements may decelerate the aging process and perhaps even reverse it. Whitegold would relax the damaged DNA and allow it to correct and recombine. Researchers are rigorously scrutinizing genetic correction in humans with the Kaposi Sarcomas of AIDS, liver and breast cancer, Lou Gehrig's disease, Multiple Sclerosis and arthritis. 13 Although little research is available on the medical use of Whitegold , there is some anecdotal evidence that the chloride form of ORME iridium is effective in the remission of cancer. 14 Culture tests also confirm that rhodium chloride has some effect on cancer cells with abnormal activity reduced by about sixty percent. There is no effect on normal cells. The precise mechanism is not yet certain. Retardation of cancer activity in the cells occurs even if the rhodium is only in local proximity. David Hudson feels a resonant vibration is at the center of the whole science of monatomic substances and refers to it as the Spirit of life. In 1995, he set up a group to fund his pilot plant called the Science of the Spirit Foundation ."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 22 Other test tube studies with pure monatomic metals on cancer cells and with cancer patients have been inconclusive. In one cell culture test, the cancer cells reverted to normal, while in other tests the cancer cells simply continued without effect. 15 Seven women with breast cancer took pure ORME materials with no effect. 16 It is now hypothesized that the reason pure ORME-state elements have no effect is that they are not absorbable into the normal digestive system in the same ready way that chlorides are digested. More extravagant metaphysical claims made by paranormal sources are that the body has the ability to travel anywhere by just thinking. This translocation or astral travel is called the rapture . Other flamboyant claims are that a person can live eight hundred to one thousand years with a perfect body in the state of a teenager and communicate telepathically. While not subscribing to paranormal phenomena, David Hudson does claim that his monatomic substances are superconductors and that this may provide a possible explanation for the amazing behavior of the Ark of the Covenant . Jewish Midrashim commentaries describe how the Ark of the Covenant levitated and carried along some of the people who were supposed to be carrying it. 17 The only known phenomenon that could levitate in this manner is a superconductor's Meissner field . A Meissner Field is a strong diamagnetic field, unique to superconductors, that causes them to be repelled by an external magnetic field. Heike Kamerlingh Onne, a Dutch physicist, first identified Superconductivity in 1911. It is a state of zero electrical resistance, usually exhibited at very low temperatures. It was not until 1933 that the German team of Karl W. Meissner and R. Ochsenfeld showed that superconductors possess a Meissner Field . Notwithstanding these early successes, the phenomena of superconductivity was not properly understood until 1957 when three American physicists proved that it was due to the quantum effect of electrons moving in pairs. For this work, they received the 1972 Nobel Prize for Physics. 18 The Nobel Committee again chose this strategic area of research for its Prize in 1987 and 1996. 19 As Whitegold is a superconductor with a Meissner field, the pot of manna in the Ark of the Covenant could have contained a quantity of Whitegold that produced such a field. There is some suggestion that Moses placed an omer of manna, or Whitegold , in the Ark. David Hudson’s theory is that a Whitegold's Meissner field would then have"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 23 surrounded the Ark causing it to levitate and glow with the radiance of the Shekhinah . This would have also caused the ill effects on the Philistines of Ashdod. The Ark caused hemorrhoids, from the Hebrew OPLIM meaning tumors. 20 Josephus says of the diseases inflicted at Ashdod: 21 ...for they died of the dysentery and flux, a sore distemper that brought death upon them very suddenly; for before the soul could, as usual in early deaths, be loosed from the body, they brought up their entrails and vomited up what they had eaten... Similarly, the peoples of Gath and Ekron at the time of Samuel could hardly wait to return the Ark. 22 An unusual characteristic of Meissner fields is that another Meissner field , which oscillates at the same frequency, can enter that field of the first and not perturb it. Each week the High Priests of Melchizedek ventured beyond the veil in the Holy of Holies. There they partook of the Bread of the Presence of God . Then more Bread was set out for the next week before the Ark of the Covenant . A Melchizedek high priest who had eaten the Bread of the Presence of God for some time could theoretically approach and safely touch the Ark of the Covenant . The Priest would not perturb the Ark’s Meissner field because of his resonance with it. Resonance avoids a voltage difference. The absence of resonance when an ordinary person approaches the Ark could lead to a collapse of flux, a voltage difference and an electrical discharge. 23 This phenomenon may have given rise to the practice of tying a golden chain around the High Priest's foot. Priests waiting outside the Holy of Holies could drag out the High Priest if the Ark immobilized him. 24 The properties of ORMES have not been widely validated. Nor is David Hudson's Whitegold precisely the same as the Philosophers' Stone in any one of its traditional forms. Yet, the similarity in materials and the derivation of processes is highly compelling. If traditional alchemists’ difficulties such as chemical fires are an indication of shared technology, David Hudson’s pilot plant is certainly no exception. The preparation of the Whitegold from pure metallic gold is an expensive and time-consuming process. It is unlikely that there would be sufficient produced in this way for many to undertake the Egyptian rite of passage, which is to consume five hundred milligrams of Whitegold each day for thirty days. Testing is not even possible until David Hudson's troubled pilot plant provides the direct production of white gold from"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 24 volcanic ore. 25 His plant uses sixty five million year old volcanic ore from the Arizona desert. While the necessary ores are found in any place on the earth where there has been volcanic action, the best source of material is the Maui craters in Hawaii where the magma is highly enriched with iridium. Iridium ore is a pink-orange color and that with rhodium is more of a grey color. The metals are already monatomic but purification is a lengthy process with 32 steps and it takes 100kg of ore to get 1kg of precipitate. Before obtaining the privilege Whitegold may bring, it is well to remember a Rabbinical warning that the powder can be used for good or evil and it is incumbent upon all to learn to control our own dark side before partaking : 26 Understandably, then, the absolute conditions for unlocking this door lie in purity, selflessness, and the mastery of instincts. In the next chapter, we look at Jerusalem as an ancient center for alchemical technology."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 25 Chapter 3 Enigma of King Solomon's Temple King Solomon's reign was sometime during the period 1015BCE to 931BCE. His father, King David, had consolidated Judah and Israel into the United Kingdom of Israel, ruled from Jerusalem. By the time of Solomon's kingship, Jerusalem had become a wealthy centre of trade. The Books of I Kings and II Chronicles describe how Solomon constructed a mighty temple to house the Arc of the Covenant. He decorated it with the most sumptuous of stonework, woodwork and metalwork using Phoenician artisans provided by the King of Tyre. Although there were many older temples on Mount Zion, Jewish and Biblical scholars consider King Solomon's Temple the First Temple of Jerusalem. The Babylonian King Sennacherib besieged Jerusalem at the time of Hezekiah in 700BCE. Hezekiah paid him a tribute of a king’s ransom including thirty talents of gold, eight hundred talents of silver, precious stones and antimony. 27 The next Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar invaded Jerusalem in 597BCE and again in 587BCE. 28 In the latter invasion, he destroyed the Temple and transported the population of Jerusalem to Babylon. 29 King Cyrus of Persia later returned the descendants of these Israelites to Israel in 538BCE. He financed the construction of the Second Temple by Zerubbabel, albeit in an austere style. The name Zerubbabel actually means Children of Israel and is probably an archetype. The Jews completed the Second Temple in 515BCE. It operated until 169BCE when plundered by Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the Illustrious. He allegedly removed both the visible and hidden treasures. 30 With permission from the Sanhedrin, Herod the Great demolished Zerubbabel's Second Temple in 20CE and constructed a grandiose Third Temple in only eighteen months. Fifty years later, the Roman General Titus burned this temple to the ground on the very anniversary of the destruction of the First Temple. His action was in response to fanatical militancy by Jewish Zealots who murdered a garrison of surrendered Roman troops in Jerusalem. The Jewish chronicler Flavius Josephus and Roman historian Tacitus both wrote that Titus had not wanted to destroy the Third Temple. They did so because after heavily fortifying the temple, the Zealots fervently defended it. 31 "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 26 Flavius Josephus warrants a brief character sketch, as he will often contribute to our research. Josephus was nobly born in Galilee as a descendant of the Hasmonaean-Maccabees. He was educated as a Priest of the Temple and became the revolutionary Governor of Galilee in the Zealot uprising of 66CE. He commanded nationalist guerrilla forces against the troops of Vespasian. The Romans captured him. However, in front of General Vespasian he announced that Vespasian was the messiah the Jews awaited and that both Vespasian and his son Titus would become emperors of Rome. After Vespasian became emperor in 69CE, conveniently proving Josephus a sage, Vespasian appointed Josephus part of his entourage. Vespasian also gave Josephus an apartment in the imperial palace and bestowed the citizenship of Rome on him. Josephus’ chronicle, The Jewish War , provides our only detailed account of the Zealot uprising in 66CE and the fall of Massada. 32 Josephus gives a date for the commencement of King Solomon’s Temple of 1060BCE, some one thousand one hundred years before his own time. He does this by nominating the period from the laying of the foundation stone of the First Temple to the destruction of the Third Temple by Titus in 70CE as one thousand one hundred and thirty years, seven months and fifteen days. 33 He then goes on to describe the terrible destruction of the Third Temple in graphic detail: 34 While the Sanctuary was burning, looting went on right and left and all who were caught were put to the sword. Such were the height of the hill and the vastness of the blazing edifice that the entire city seemed to be on fire, while as for the noise, nothing could be imagined more shattering or horrifying. There was the war-cry of the Roman legions as they converged, the yells of the partisans encircled with fire and sword... Yet more terrible than the din were the sights that met the eye. The Temple Hill, enveloped in flames from top to bottom, appeared to be boiling up from its very roots; yet the sea of flame was nothing compared to the oceans of blood. The Romans continued to systematically quash the Jewish uprising by eliminating Zealots in Jerusalem, Essenes in Qumran, the Zealots and Sicarii occupying Herod’s Massada fortress and the entire Jewish population of Caesarea. Jewish militancy flared once more when Rabbi Akiva inspired a Maccabee revolt under the brilliant Jewish revolutionary leader Simon Bar Kochbar in 130CE. Simon Bar Kochbar was known as the Son of the Star . This name has the same meaning as that of Zoroaster and implies he"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 27 was an initiate in the royal mysteries. He was a prince of Israel and constituted a prospective messiah for the Hasmonaean royalty of Israel. Bar Kochbar always fought in the front line at the most dangerous points. He led two hundred thousand men to establish an independent Jewish state, but it was to last only three years. The Romans lost an entire legion regaining control. In retribution, the Romans leveled one thousand villages, killed half a million people and sent many thousands of people abroad as slaves. After the disastrous revolt of Bar Kochbar, the Rabbis actively discouraged political messianic hopes. 35 They denounced sects such as the Judeo-Christians that calculated the Time of the End . The Rabbis renamed Bar Kochbar son of a lie . They declared all messianic and apocalyptic literature uncanonical and secular. Bar Kochbar’s Hasmonaean uprising was not Christian but Jewish nationalism. Massada’s fall exhausted it in 67CE and led Roman Emperor Hadrian to order the total obliteration of Jerusalem. Absolutely nothing remained of the city except for the western retaining wall. The Romans dedicated a small temple to Jupiter on the desolate site. We now turn to the archeological investigations in Palestine that stand at odds with the early Biblical account of King Solomon's Temple. The first hurdle is that independent records from Egypt, Mesopotamia and Phoenicia do not confirm the existence of either David or Solomon. The only king of the relevant period to have ruled over the legendary empire of Solomon that stretched from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates was the Egyptian Pharaoh Tuthmose I, as he recorded on the Tombos Stela c1490BCE. 36 Tuthmose III was the next ruler of this region at the time he campaigned to Naharin on the Upper Euphrates in 1480BCE. As to the name David, the Essenes simply regarded the name David as the generic name of the promised messiah . 37 Archeological digs provide the next set of hurdles. They have not verified the magnificence of Solomon's city or his Temple. There are no signs whatsoever of an advanced material culture having existed. 38 Buildings were not monumental works of carved stone ashlars but small with clay floors. 39 None of the Temple's famed pomegranate decorations has ever been discovered, although a small decoration in the archeology section of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem shows that pomegranates were at some time used as decorations. If the era of King Solomon was relatively impoverished and culturally desolate, we must ask if the Biblical accounts are fictional"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 28 archetypes or if the archeologists are mistaken. Two key factors help us to understand this question. Firstly, it is widely thought that the Five Books of Moses that form the Pentateuch and Old Testament derive from King Solomon's time or shortly after. 40 The author, affectionately dubbed J , would have been quite familiar with the near history of Israel and particularly the temple of the city of Jerusalem. Given that archeological evidence in Jerusalem and all of Judah and Israel does not conform to J 's description, literal interpretation is unwise. One piece of evidence is conclusive in deciding that Biblical accounts of King Solomon's Temple are fictional archetypes. This is that Thutmose III plundered the legendary treasure of the Temple in 1480BCE. This is approximately five hundred and thirty years before construction of King Solomon's Temple in 950BCE. Thutmose III recorded his Palestine campaign and its spoils in a temple at Al-Karnak in Egypt. In 2134BCE, Egypt’s eleventh dynasty began building the temples of Al-Karnak. Construction lasted for one thousand five hundred years. Thutmose III's area records in bas-relief the same grand and precious ornaments and furniture mentioned in the Bible. At odds with this is the Bible, which says that David gave these things to Solomon. 41 The bas-relief shows the items and their quantities. 42 The top five rows of the bas-relief are objects of gold, the next five rows show objects of silver mingled with gold and precious stones. The lower rows show objects of bronze and semiprecious stones. The wealth is so extensive that it is easy to imagine it represents hundreds of years of trading. Yet, these are only the sacral goods presented to the Priests of Amun. Other Egyptian monuments attest to the secular plunder retained by the Pharaoh and his viziers such as furniture and chariots of gold and silver. The tomb of the vizier Rekhmire records that Thutmose III transported the Israelite metallurgical and craftsman skills to Egypt: 43 Bringing the Asiatic copper [-smiths] which his majesty captured in the victories in Retenu ... Making chests of ivory, ebony , ... captives, which his majesty brought for the works of the temple of Amon . Various Rosicrucian orders such as the Brotherhood of the Rosie Cross look to Thutmose III as their mystical patriarch and use Thutmose III's cartouche in their symbols. There is some support for this claim as Masonic symbols are apparent on Thutmose III's obelisk now located in New York's Central Park. 44 Other Rosicrucian orders look back to an"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 29 even earlier time of 1950BCE and the twelfth dynasty Pharaoh Sesôstris I. His profound maxim Know thou thyself! is the distinguishing characteristic of a modest man engraved at the Temple of Delphos (an imaginary temple of perfection). 45 The dimension of this statement became very important in both alchemy and mystery religion. The Book of the Concealed Mystery of the Zohar describes King Solomon joining himself to the Daughters of Men. The apocryphal Book of Enoch describes Azazel in a similar way. 46 The Zohar thus suggests, surprisingly strongly, that King Solomon is descended from the ancient Nephilim or their descendants the Anakim , of whom we shall have more to say in Chapter 17. If this were indeed the case, there would have been many opportunities for the famous Temple to be built before the campaign of Thutmose III and perhaps even before the time of Sesôstris I, who ruled five hundred years before Thutmose III. In fact, Herodotus maintains that Pharaoh Sesôstris is the unknown Shishak who sacked the First Temple, a millennium before the biblical dates. 47 Sesôstris’ campaigns demonstrate that this is plausible. However, Josephus vigorously denies this contention and he is probably correct. 48 Herodotus’ Sesôstris is most likely Sese-Ramses II, who some storywriters call Sesoosis . Pharaohs such as Tuthmose III and Ramses II liked to compare their acts to the great Pharaoh Sesôstris, who was the first Egyptian Pharaoh to pillage Palestine and Anatolia. If Sesoosis is really Ramses II then Herodotus is dating the destruction of the Temple to the era of the Battle of Kadesh in 1291BCE. The Bible dates the sack of the First Temple by an Egyptian king named Shishak or Sheshech to the fifth year of Rehoboam, the son of King Solomon. 49 Yet, this Pharaoh Shishak ( S H S H K ) is absent from Egyptian records. It is useful to review the background to the despairing legend of Shishak . 50 Due to Solomon's idolatry, God declared through the prophet Ahijah that Jeroboam, an official in Solomon's court, would receive ten tribes from Solomon. Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam, who fled to the protection of Shishak in Egypt. He returned after Solomon's death to become the leader of the new northern kingdom of Israel. Solomon’s son, Rehoboam, ruled the southern kingdom of Judah. After the split, Shishak invaded both weakened kingdoms. The inspiration for this story seems to be the splitting of Egypt in 1075BCE by the twenty-first dynasty. High Priests in Thebes continued"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 30 to rule Southern Egypt. Kings from Tanis in the far northeast of the Delta ruled the new independent North Egypt. The Libyans took advantage of the weakened kingdom with an invasion c945BCE that overthrew all Egypt. Chapter 6 will show the Semitic Levant Asiatics in Egypt, who came closest to power in the nineteenth dynasty, truly regarded Egypt as their rightful possession. This was the grand heritage of Jacob on the Ladder , which Ramses II recorded on his stele commemorating the four hundredth anniversary of his dynasty. Although the Exodus expulsion of Ra Meses, the Biblical Moses of whom we shall see more in Chapter 5, was a temporary setback, it was not decisive to Levant Asiatic involvement. Nor was loss of power by the nineteenth dynasty. The second Pharaoh of the twenty-first dynasty, Psusennes I of Tanis, reestablished it. He associated his lineage with the nineteenth dynasty and, in doing so, reignited Semitic Levant Asiatic ambitions for the Delta. In stark contrast, Psusennes II’s disastrous loss of all Egypt to the Libyan Shoshenq I after the foolish division of the kingdom by the twenty-first dynasty was fatal to Levant Asiatic ambitions for Egypt. King Solomon’s son, Rehoboam, is therefore the luckless biblical archetype for the two Pharaohs called Psusennes. However, even Shoshenq I sought the traditional legitimacy of Egyptian ultimogeniture for his family. Firstly, he recognized Psusennes II by the dedication of a statue. Then his son Osorkon married the daughter of Psusennes II. 51 Through this marriage and by the principal of ultimogeniture, Osorkon’s own son became a legitimate Egyptian Pharaoh. Shoshenq I, the twenty-second dynasty invading Pharaoh, had a similar name to the Biblical Shishak. An inscription in the Temple of Karnak made in Shoshenq I's twenty-first year dated his rule at c925- 924BCE. He is contemporary with the Tel Dan stele and Mesha stone. However, the perplexing name of Shishak is probably not simply that of the Libyan Pharaoh who conquered Egypt as biblical writers of the Severan dynasty and successive Massoretic revisionists to the tenth century CE assume. 52 The Dead Sea Scrolls more often agree with the Septuagint than with the Massoretic text. 53 Indeed, the Corpus found at Qumran contains no mention of Shishak in either Kings or Chronicles. Even circumstantial evidence implies that Shoshenq I’s Levant conquest produced little booty from Jerusalem. While the bas-relief displays of his conquest at Karnak"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 31 are incomplete as regards the tally for Jerusalem, the total tribute is clear. After eliminating the tribute from identified cities, there is little remaining tribute to associate with Jerusalem. If there was a glorious wealth of gold shields and other tribute from Solomon’s city, Shoshenq I certainly did not triumphantly record it. Using accepted Biblical chronology the fifth year of Rehoboam would be about 917BCE, about five hundred and sixty years after Thutmose III's conquest. The Atbash Cipher solution decodes Shishak to Babel , meaning Babylon (see Appendix 10). 54 The Babylon connection means the fifth year of Rehoboam could well be another three hundred and twenty years later, in 597BCE. In this year King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon invaded Israel, destroyed the Temple and carried the people into Exile. We therefore have a dazzling array of dates some eight hundred and eighty years apart, from the conquest of Tuthmose III to the time of King Nebuchadnezzar. There must be another explanation. While retaining the identity of Shishak , we need to dispose of the derived Atbash Cipher solution as a date for the destruction of the Temple. There were two traditional oppressors of the Israelites: Egypt and Babylon. The archetypal Egyptian King Shishak represented the kings of both lands. The biblical stories neatly combine the Israelites’ two aggressors Shoshenq I and Nebuchadnezzar into a single archetype (later Rome was rolled in as well). The similarity of Pharaoh Shoshenq I’s name to Shishak is a fortuitous device that greatly enhances the power of the archetype because of its apparent internal consistency. King Shoshenq I’s Palestine campaign also conveniently aligns with the break-up of David’s empire. However, the lost empire was not Israel. It was the Delta of Egypt and all the lands in Tuthmose I’s kingdom that stretched to the Euphrates. The forlorn Israelites were anxious to regain their domain: And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots ... And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. 55 For thus saith the Lord God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it. And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 32 sword that I will send among them ... Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, ... Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people ... all the kings of the land of Uz, ... the Philistines, ... Edom ... Moab ... Ammon, ... Tyre ... Zidon, and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea ... Arabia, ... Zimri ... Elam ... Medes ...the north, far and near and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them . 56 We begin to suspect that the exact physical location, relevant time and culture of the Temple are very uncertain because they are veiled stories of Israelite political ambition for the Egypt’s Delta and the land of Canaan. The synthesized archetypal history has drawn on many legends over more than a millennium to create the famous Temple in the Israelite’s city of last resort, Jerusalem, which became their icon of nationhood. The Babylonian conquest mercilessly destroyed the records of the Judeans. Religious and political leaders were killed en-masse. The remaining population, primarily women and children, marched to Babylonia in slavery. This resulted in the loss of both oral and written tradition. Only fragmented legends remained. The returning Jews at the time of Cyrus assembled what they could into consistent stories of their history. Rather than single events, these became medleys. Individuals became archetypes. God’s arbitrary treatment of his chosen people led to many explanations and conspiracy theories. Stories became didactic rather than fact. They developed a revolutionary flavor. The only thing constant about Jewish history was its frequency of redefinition. Many Pharaohs troubled the Israelites during the one thousand five hundred years from Sesôstris I to the writing of Chronicles and Jeremiah in 450BCE. The historians of Chronicles and Jeremiah may well have been unaware of the relevant Egyptian Pharaoh at the time of the Exodus. We only need to contrast the despairing paucity of their information resources with our own acute lack of knowledge of events over the last one thousand five hundred years. We are hazy about much of the Dark Ages. We know almost nothing of the early Papacy. We have not even solved the controversy of whether the greatest writer in the canon of English Literature, William Shakespeare, was a real person or a team of lawyers, poets and publishers. A recently discovered Phoenician text on limestone at Tel Mikne , the ancient Philistine city of Ekron, suggests how the histories of the First Temple were developed. 57 The text commemorates that Achish"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 33 constructed the temple of Ekron and archaeologists place this at around 650BCE. Fifth century BCE Biblical authors similarly wrote that David knew a Philistine king by the same name of Achish: 58 And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. Therefore, it is likely that the authors of Samuel and Kings used the events of the 650BCE era and melded them with myths of earlier times as the broad canvas for their histories of David, Solomon and the First Temple. By the time of Christ, a third national oppressor joined Egypt and Babylon in the archetype of Shishak . At the time of Revelation , in 95CE, Babylon represented Rome. The Revelation of John predicts the destruction of Babylon. The celestial city of Jerusalem is to replace it. 59 Babylon is in this case the occupied terrestrial city of Jerusalem. It also includes the Roman Empire and in particular, Rome itself. From the paucity of evidence for King Solomon and his Temple, we can only conclude that large parts of the King Solomon myth involve the projection of an Israelite archetype. This has a mishnaic precedent or midrashic scriptural interpretation. 60 Of what is King Solomon an archetype? His own name tells us but we need to understand the ancient code of subsumed names. We need to look at one more mystery before moving on. This is the real meaning of the name Solomon, given the heritage of King Solomon’s city of Jerusalem. In antiquity, the reason that a God could have many names was that all-powerful gods regularly incorporated names from all other gods they overcame: 61 Conquering gods their titles take From the foes they captive make. The Kabbalah observes this formula throughout. It allows us to understand the linguistic form of Solomon. 62 Breaking names into meaningful syllables is the priestly language also known as the Language of the Birds , which was originally the shorthand technique used by priests in carrier pigeon messages. 63 It renders the name Solomon as Sol-Om-On . This indicates dominance over the sun god Sol, the divine mantra Om or omnific word AUM representing the gods Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva of the Indo-Hittite pantheon, and the Egyptian and Greek gods of On. 64 "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 34 The letters AUM also stand for the Latin Artifex Universus Mundi , which means the Great Architect of the World and has the numerical cipher sum of 33. While the sacred word of the Brahmins is AUM , the Buddhists use O-mi-to and the Druids O. I. W . 65 Plato identified the Tetragrammaton: Tell me of the God of On, which was, is, and shall be. Dominance over these gods also demonstrates that Solomon is one form of the god Yahweh. The next chapter confirms that Solomon knows one of Yahweh's secret names, Iahu . By dominance logic, Iahu is one of Solomon's names, as it was also one of Horus' names in Egypt. Furthermore, the name Solomon is but one part of the Tetragrammaton JHWH in a greater whole. Freemasonry records the legend of King Solomon, Hiram King of Tyre and the great architect and master of building, Hiram Abiff, together building King Solomon’s Temple. In these three characters, we find the Holy and Ineffable name of God recorded. 66 The consonant W , or Digamma F , represents King Solomon, whose name most simply means Peace. W is one of the two secret letters of the Hebrew alphabet regarded by the Pythagoreans as uncontaminated by the errors of the material universe. The other secret Hebrew letter is H , representing the first day of creation. It is therefore analogous to the creating architect, Hiram Abiff. Finally, JH , which represents Sovereignty, equates to Hiram King of Tyre. In Jewish tradition, the three consonants of the Logos Tetragrammaton JH-W-H have additional meanings that relate to the leading tribes of Israel. 67 JH is the letter of the tribe of Benjamin and its precious stone Jerel , or amber. This is also Hebrew for electricity, although Hashmal is the modern word. 68 In Ezekiel’s vision of the Ancient of Days , Hashmal was the divine substance that provided the fiery splendors of God’s Throne and Countenance, the Merkabah . 69 The letter W is the letter of the last day of creation and associated with the phrase: Let there be rest . W is the letter of the tribe of Judah and its precious stone is the fire garnet. Finally, the letter H is the letter of the first day of creation associated with the phrase: Let there be Light . It is the letter of the tribe of Levi and the associated precious stone is Lapis Lazuli. The Talmud describes the Ten Commandments recorded on two tablets of sappur and entrusted to the Levites for safekeeping. Sappur is Lapis Lazuli. Yet, the meanings of the Tetragrammaton extend even further. The vowels AOUEI can be inserted into the Hebrew Tetragrammaton"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 35 YHWH to create the whole name of God. These vowels represent the female spirit that moved on the face of the water . 70 Emperor Frederick III, the first Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor who reigned from 1452CE to 1493CE, adopted this vowel set as his personal motto or device. 71 We have seen that deconstruction of the name Solomon produces three names and, alternatively, Solomon is one of three names making up the greater whole of the Tetragrammaton. This same formula is common with the Afro-Asiatic Triple Goddess. While a single Goddess, she has three primary guises, each in turn represented by three Muses. This leads to the famous Ennead of nine Muses or manifestations of the Triple Goddess. 72 The three original Muses are the Triple Goddess in her orgiastic aspect, while Three Fates and the Three Hesperides are the Triple Goddess in her death aspect. 73 Every study of mythology must begin with a study of the many- titles Mother Goddess, Triple Goddess or White Goddess. 74 Her worship underlay the political and religious systems that existed before the Indo Hittite invasions. When motherhood was the prime mystery of society, the Mother Goddess took lovers for pleasure. Her victims feared, adored and obeyed her. The cycles of the Moon, which aligned with her twenty- eight day menstrual cycles, led the Mother Goddess to be identified with the three phases of the moon: maiden, nymph or nubile woman and crone. While the moon did not grow dimmer as the year waned, the sun died and was reborn under her influence. The witches of Thessaly, a Mother Goddess cult dreaded by everyone, threatened the sun with perpetual night. 75 It did not happen because the Goddess raised another king. The Priestesses at Delphi chose a nymph to celebrate the sacred marriage by a foot race. 76 This forerunner of our modern Olympic Games, Hera’s Games, took place one day before the main games. 77 The victrix became the high priestess of Hera and one with the Goddess by partaking of her sacred cow. Another method was simply to award the right by ultimogeniture to the youngest nubile woman of the junior branch of the royal house. The nymph then chose an annual lover who was elevated to king. After erotic lovemaking with the nymph, the crone sacrificed the king to fructify the trees, flocks and crops with his blood. The college of priestesses then ate his raw flesh wearing the masks of bitches, sows and mares. In Europe, the ritual was amended so two kings reigned and died. The king died at the summer solstice and his tanist, or supposed twin, at the winter solstice. The tanist’s reward was reincarnation as an oracular"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 36 serpent of Wisdom. The phases of the moon governed time and the king died at the seventh full moon after the shortest day. 78 When resistance developed to this arrangement, the Priestesses substituted a surrogate boy- king, called an interrex, who died in place of the king. 79 In Crete a kid was substituted for the human victim; in Thrace it was a bull-calf; and the Aeolians substituted a foal. The rituals of the Mother Goddess were firmly rooted in Arcadia. The Arcadians sacrificially ate boys right up to Christian times. 80 With insight from the Triple Goddess into Solomon’s name, it is hardly surprising that there is a long history of association between Solomon and his city of Jerusalem. Josephus records that the first name of Jerusalem was Solyma . The sun god Sol is the Jerusalem demi-god of the sun, Salma , who was associated with both Jerusalem and Hebron. 81 Salma was also Reseph , the Canaanite Mikal , Michael , the Egyptian Osiris and Salmon the ancestor of Solomon. 82 Salma’s father was Beli the Willow God and the Lord of Light . His mother was Sal-Ma the Willow Mother and Moon Goddess. In this context, Jerusalem was an important shrine to the Son of the God of Light some one thousand four hundred years before the time of Jesus. Before Mosaic reinterpretation, Canaanites celebrated the god Salma or Sal-Ma with an orgiastic fire and water festival in Jerusalem. It was originally Anatha’s Bacchanal willow tree orgy for rainmaking. 83 The celibate Jewish Feast of the Tabernacles preserves this festival. According to the Talmud, the Pharisees found it difficult to curb the traditional lightheadedness of the women as they solemnly brought water from the Pool of Siloam on the climax of the festival, the Day of Willows. 84 The same harvest festival in Athens was the Oschophoris in which male participants carried fruit laden boughs. They corresponded to the lulab of the Feast of Tabernacles . 85 Effigies of Ariadne with detachable limbs dangled from the Athenian boughs. They represented Ariadne’s suicide in fear of Artemis. In the Mochlos hoard, archeologists discovered delicate Borealis gold tiaras worn by priestesses who ritually committed suicide and were dismembered in the same way as Ariadne at the Oschophoris. Salma is the original god of this festival. His name is part of Jerusalem, Uru-Salim , from the Tell Amarna letters of 1370BCE. Assyrian records of the same period show Jerusalem was Ur-Salimu . All these names are referring to Salma God of Light ."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 37 Tuthmose III did not mention Jerusalem in his list of Palestine conquests. This could mean a number of things. Perhaps Jerusalem was not an important city at the time or it had another name. It may have escaped sacking, or perhaps its record was lost or not recorded. Of these, the most likely is that Jerusalem had another name at the time. This was quite probably Kadesh, the Holy City of the God of Light . The name Salim is also associated with the East. Its appearance from Greece to Arabia shows that Salma was important throughout the whole region. 86 Even today, the salt workers of the Ettore Saltworks on the west coast of Sicily collect salt as their predecessors have for thousands of years. They measure their labor in Salmas . One Salma is equivalent to one and a half tonnes of wet salt. One hundred Salmas make a much-celebrated Holy Sacrament . The word Salma also occurs in the names of ancient kings. It is a royal title among King David's ancestors the Kenites and appears as the royal name Selim among the Phoenicians, Salman among the Assyrians and Salmoneus among the Danaans of Greece and late Minoan Crete. 87 Salma also suggests the word saleuma , which describes the ritual laming of the sacred king Dionysus of the mystery drama. 88 This was the bulls-foot . Greek tragic actors who wore the cothurnus in honour of Dionysus often imitated the swaggering gait of saleuma . 89 Mothers chastised many a girl in Palestine for mimicking this peculiarly suggestive manner of walking. Dionysus also means the Lame God of Light, which is quite similar to Salma . 90 The word lame in Syracusan is Nysos and identifies places such as Nusaybin, in the Commagene of Turkey, as a shrine to Dionysus. The lame king Dionysus is often associated with the mysteries of the metalworking smith. Ancient religions all over Africa and Europe have a hobbling Smith-god. In their erotic Spring beer-orgy called Pesach the Smiths wore wings and performed a hobbling spiral partridge dance. 91 This ritual celebrated the marriage of the Smith-god Hephaestus to the patron Athene. The Smiths performed their spiral partridge dance in a maze pattern on a mosaic floor. 92 It is still a symbol of Freemasonry’s second degree. Jerome wrote that in his time, devotees performed the hobbling ceremony of Pesach at Beth-Hoglah, on the threshing floor of Atad where they mourned the lame King Jacob. Men from Troy, Crete and Northeastern Russia to Italy, Wales and Britain performed the sacred labyrinth dance. 93 Even today, Greek"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 38 men will often exuberantly contest each other at celebrations and dinners with the careful spiral Crane Dance of Delos, carefully trod with measured steps of labyrinthine evolutions that Theseus first performed at Knossos. 94 Daedalus built such a dancing floor in Knossos for Ariadne. He marked the maze pattern in white marble relief, copied from the Egyptian Labyrinth: 95 Daedalus in Knossos once contrived A dancing-floor for fair-haired Ariadne... Archeologists discovered an open space in front of the palace at Knossos. 96 This open space had a maze pattern to guide the performers in their partridge hobbling-dance. Knossian coins also showed this pattern. A Cretan maze cut on a rock face in Bosinney in Cornwall shows that the maze reached Britain. It is exactly the same pattern as the British turf-cut mazes, known as Troy-towns, which schoolchildren trod at Easter until the nineteenth century. 97 The Easter egg was a symbol of resurrection and the counter-charm to the apple of the Goddess. 98 Traditionally, hunters captured partridges in a brushwood maze. They caged a bird in the center of the maze, which offered food-calls, love calls and challenges. As visiting birds arrived at the center, the hunters knocked them on the head. 99 Jacob confirms he is a smith-god by his ritual laming: 100 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. The sacred marriage of Salma and the Flower Queen Moon Goddess at Jerusalem is in Canticles: 101 I am the Rose of Sharon, the lily of the valleys. As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. Much has been made of this song because of seven references to Solomon in the Hebrew text. These references skew the interpretation of the Song to a love between Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Yet, the Solomonic verses are coarse in comparison with the sensitive poetry of the Song and an ill fit with the tenor of the main verse. The new lines talk not of pure philosophical and carnal love between man and woman but"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 39 soldiers, swords and State politics. These things are traditional concerns of the Israelites but totally out of character with the simple beauty of the lines that describe the sacred marriage of the sacrificial king. The Song is the mystery of Astarte’s fertility rite and the death of Tammuz, which returns life to the land (see Appendix 13). 102 Ecclesiastes is the inner mystery of the rite. 103 The poetry of the unadulterated sacred marriage is purely a fertility rite of Ishtar or Astarte, as the tree cipher in the text clearly reveals: 104 The beams of our house are cedars; our rafters are firs. The Cedar is the tree of sovereignty and associated with Ishtar or Astarte. The fir is the tree of birth and motherhood of the Moon Goddess, Ishtar or Astarte. In Mesopotamia, the fir tree substituted for the palm. The cedar, fir, rose and olive are all characteristics of the Goddess of Wisdom standing for her sovereignty, motherhood, beauty and fruitfulness. The biblical Rose of Sharon does not grow on the Plain of Sharon between Jaffa and Mount Carmel. In the Song of Songs, the Hebrew word habatstseleth translates as rose . 105 Conversely, in Isaiah it translates as crocus flower. 106 These are the only two incidences of this Hebrew word habatstseleth in the Bible. Neither semiotics nor botany provides a conclusive meaning. The reason for this is that rose simply represents the beauty and special function of the Goddess seen in the blood of her heroes Adonis and Tammuz (see Appendix 13). 107 The eight-petal scarlet anemones of Pelion, which redden the slopes of Mount Lebanon after the winter rains, symbolize their blood. 108 The Goddess is the receptive womb that transforms the lover to the new son, the God of Light . Repeatedly, the rose embraces and is embraced by what it embraces. This is the philosophical logic of roses . Later authors have adjusted the symbolism of Sharon's Rose to represent Jesus. As we shall see in Chapter 16 and Chapter 17, the rose represents dew , as does the Sumerian KUR-KUR , or crocus flower. The difference is that the rose gives birth to the son or divine dew of Light . This is the color of the bright lilac crocus and identifies with the mysterious Arcanum arcanorum , the lilac Philosophers’ Stone, which is often hallowed as Jesus for reasons that will also become clear later in this book. The importance of the crocus seems to derive from the abundant presence in Colchis of both the false or meadow crocus, crocus colchium,"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 40 and the true crocus sativus . 109 Each was highly valued for different reasons, the former as a unique Egyptian remedy for gout and the latter as the source of golden-yellow saffron dye. A similar approach that links the rose and the crocus to the symbolism of Jesus applies hermetic drift to expand the context of the rose to that of a generic flower, anthos in Greek. This image refocuses to the bright lilac crocus as the symbol for Jesus. These investigations have shown that the name of Solomon is part of an Ennead such as Salma , Om and On , confirming his status as an Israelite archetype. He is a Son of Light and by rose-logic , one manifestation of Yahweh as well. This recognition more readily helps us to accept the esoteric traditions of Solomon's ability to command demons, jinn and other spirits as described in the Talmud and a whole cycle of the Arabian Nights legends. Jews and Arabs alike continue to regard King Solomon as one of the greatest alchemists and in possession of the Philosophers’ Stone. An old English poem preserved in Elias Ashmole’s Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum says: 110 ... the Blessed Stone Fro Heven wase sende downe to Solomon King Solomon is also reputed to have written a book about the Philosophers’ Stone called HaMa ş pen or The Compass . 111 He writes of obtaining the Philosophers' Stone from the Queen of Sheba, who had previously received it from her husband Seman. 112 Seman was a great sage amongst the Copt or Nabateans. In Chapter 8, we shall have more to say about the Nabateans as an integral link between the Sabians of Yemen and the Sabians of Harran. The Queen of Sheba joined King Solomon in Jerusalem for a particular reason. 113 As we shall see in the next chapter, a Kingdom passed from the King to the son of either the King ’ s youngest daughter or youngest sister by the rule of ultimogeniture. 114 Thus, the Queen of Sheba visits Solomon to deliver the wealth of Egypt to Solomon ’ s son Rehoboam. The wealth of the Temple and the empire inherited by Rehoboam is that of the Egyptian State. That unique icon of the pinnacle of wealth, the Philosophers ’ Stone, symbolized it. We shall see in Chapter 6 how they obtained this wealth. While King Solomon and his Temple are likely to be compound archetypes, we can speculate as to what physical buildings might have provided the model for the concept of the Temple."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 41 The temple plans of nearby Hazor and at Tell Ta ’ yinat and ‘ Ain Dara in Syria suggest that the Jerusalem ’ s temple was architecturally a generic, economic Syrian design. 115 However, the Bible gives it much more prominence. Locations in Egypt that provide enviable archetypes for every aspiring religion are the magnificent Temple at Al-Karnak, Luxor, Amarna on the Nile, Ramesses III mortuary temple at Medinet Habu, Avaris or Tanis in the Delta, the Nile Island of Philae. There is a good argument for Al-Karnak as the Israelites also took with then the prayers inscribed on the walls of this temple to he Aten. 116 A particularly good candidate for the Temple of Solomon is in Tanis. Before the loss of Egypt to the Libyan king Shoshenq I in 945BCE, Tanis was the northern Karnak and competed in grandeur with its southern icon. Tanis built its temples from blocks transported from the city of Ramesses, twenty-two kilometers away. The nineteenth dynasty Pharaoh Ramses II who traced his dynasty back to the Hyksos king Jacob on the Ladder originally built it: 117 His majesty has built a castle for himself. It lies between Palestine and Egypt. It is similar to Thebes and it endures as long as Memphis. In its western part is the Temple of Amun and in its southern part the Temple of Seth; the Temple of Astarte is on the morning side and the Temple of Uto is on the north side. The fortress, which is in its interior, is like the horizon of the sky. The city of Tanis arose without the sound of a hammer, as reputedly did Solomon ’ s Temple. The cities of Ramesses and Bubastis were its quarry. 118 Some of the blocks brought to Tanis weighed one thousand tons and were nearly thirty metres high. These ashlars glorified the new Temples to Amun, the Near Eastern Goddess Anat, Khonsu and Horus. The temples of Ramesses and Bubastis were already five hundred years old before their transfer to Tanis. Statues of Ramses II guard the gate of King Shoshenq at the Temple of Amun. Maned-sphinxes also bear the name of Ramses II as well as that of Merenptah and Psusennes I. The identification by the last user, Psusennes I, of his lineage from his twenty-first dynasty to the nineteenth dynasty is a clear reference to the reemergence of Semitic Levant Asiatic involvement. Excavation of his intact royal tomb at Tanis in 1940CE brought to light the second most valuable treasures of Egypt including his golden mummy mask."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 42 Ramesses III (1194-1163BCE) Thebian mortuary temple, the House of Eternity at Medinet Habu, and King Solomon ’ s Temple have many common features. 119 It includes a Migdol Gateway (four-storey fortress tower adopted for use in sacred architecture), two pylons, two courts, hypostyle hall, an inner sanctuary or Holy of Holies for Amun and a treasury. The colorful and well-preserved wall reliefs on the eight pillars of the second vestibule colonnade, north of the second court, show many arks and winged hawk-gods. These hawk-gods have their wings outstretched in the same manner as the cherubim on the Ark of the Covenant. A more recent representation of the Temple of Solomon is on the Island of Philae. Isis supposedly found Osiris' heart on the Island of Philae. The Egyptians worshiped Imhotep there. The Jewish Temple of Philae was the last Jewish temple that practiced sacrifice. It shows in bas- relief an Isiac ark that fits the description of the Ark of the Covenant including its two cherubim. 120 The arc of arcacia wood was sacred to Isis and Ishtar as it was to Moses and the Israelites. Surprisingly, the Temple of Philae was the only Egyptian temple not destroyed by the Persian Cambyses II in about 525BCE. In stark contrast to his father, Cyrus the Great, Cambyses II was a cruel despot prone to rages and sacrilegious acts. His admirable restraint on Philae shows the degree of respect Cambyses II held for the religion of the Jews, which was at least consistent with his Indo-Hittite Zoroastrian beliefs. Certainly, the period in Palestine after the expulsion of the Hyksos from Egypt in 1567BCE was much more commercially advanced than the narrow focus implied to us by the Biblical stories. 121 After the expulsion of the Hyksos, Palestine enjoyed a period of prosperity as the Israelites retained close cultural affinities with the Hurrians and Mediterranean peoples of Crete, the Cyclades and the richer areas of Mainland Greece. This prosperity was to abruptly end with the decisive five-month campaign by Tuthmose III to capture the strategic city of Megiddo from the Canaanite kings and re-exert suzerainty over Palestine. Tuthmose III promptly made Megiddo his stronghold for Syria and Palestine because it guarded the trade route between Jerusalem and Sidon. An impressive fortified ashlar gateway protected the town of Megiddo. Such squared masonry, the work of a stonemason, is usually a sign of royalty. The Bible claims King Solomon built it. 122 "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 43 Excavations have revealed just how advanced the city had become. Extensive apartments adjoined the palace and included a seashell-paved room, thought to be for bathing. The royal treasury gave archeologists a wonderful cache. It contained gold vessels, jewelry and carved ivories displaying the richness of Canaanite art. The temple of the city measured eleven metres by ten metres and had two fine pillars flanking the portico. Thutmose III's merit list of conquered cities placed Kadesh at the head of the list, followed by Megiddo. Kadesh was a very special city and superior to Megiddo. Yet, its exact location is uncertain. There are a number of cities in Syro-Palestine called Kadesh. These are Kadesh on the Orontes , the one-time Amalekite stronghold Kadesh-Barnea or Ein- Mishpat in the lower Negev Desert and Merbah Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin. 123 Thutmose III did not campaign as far as the city of Kadesh on the Orontes River in northern Syria where Ramses II later won a major battle. The other two sites of Kadesh seem to be little more than locations on the map at the time of Thutmose III. Sadly we cannot check his diary that recorded the campaign every day on a leather scroll in the temple of Amon , however he did carve the Annals of the Battle of Megiddo on the walls of the Temple of Karnak. It is widely thought that the Palestine Kadesh plundered by Thutmose III is Jerusalem. The name Kadesh actually means Holy City and many biblical references identify it directly with Jerusalem. 124 For example, in about 700BCE Isaiah said of the people of Jerusalem: 125 For they call themselves of the holy city. This leads us to believe that Jerusalem was a holy sanctuary from times pre-dating 1480BCE and probably also pre-dating about 1800BCE when Abraham met King Melchizedek there. Chapter 11 investigates King Melchizedek the Righteous in more detail. Therefore, Kadesh the Holy City is most probably Jerusalem. This would certainly be consistent with Jerusalem's position as the most important city in Palestine, where Salma the Son of Light was worshipped. As we have seen, Thutmose III plundered the legendary treasure of King Solomon here in 1480BCE, at least four hundred years before the conventionally accepted time. After the 1480BCE conquest, Thutmose III and his immediate successors firmly introduced the mystery cults of Isis and Osiris throughout Palestine. 126 These cults ritualized Isis' search for her"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 44 murdered husband Osiris and the reassembly of Osiris' body together with a golden phallus. They taught vigilance against Typhon through the triumph of Horus over his father's murderer, Set. Horus represents all immaculately conceived sons of Isis, philosophically born in her mysteries. In days past, the nom de guerre of these initiates was sons of the widow . 127 To some degree, Thutmose III returned the mystery religions to a land where they had existed many centuries before. For example, the main goddess of the Egyptian pantheon was Isis whose name derives from the Indo-Hittite onomatopoeic word Ish-ish , meaning she-who- weeps, the Goddess who weeps for her dying husband. 128 The roots of Egyptian royal language and the religious concepts of the ruling society suggest that a very early Indo-Hittite migration into Egypt established the rulers of pre-first dynasty Egypt. There is always the problem of hermetic drift inherent in myths cobbled together for national identity. This compels us to rise above the interplay of myths and legends in Occam's helicopter. Only then can we begin to categorize the archetypal landscape. At the first level of abstraction, the magnificent temple of King Solomon is Israel and Egypt. Solomon is Salma the Son of Light and by rose-logic one anthropomorphic equivalent of Yahweh. In true archetypal fashion, King Solomon disappears from Biblical history as soon as his role in building the Temple is finished. The treasure of the Temple is the wealth of the whole region once controlled by the Israelites, from Palestine to the Egyptian Delta. At a higher level of abstraction, hermetic logic makes the First Temple into the New Jerusalem, which can exist everywhere. It is within us as our celestial soul. King Solomon is greater than any god defined in relation to the earth. Like the transcendent Yahweh, Egyptian Amun and Persian Ahura Mazda, King Solomon has an integral role in the omnipresent order, harmony and balance of the whole universe. This outstandingly important role is Peace, Mercy in Justice, Righteousness and the Wisdom or Charity of Love, as we shall see in Chapter 7."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 45 Chapter 4 Crucibles of Humanity The last Chapter found that changing religious practices in the Levant and Egypt are at the heart of the enigma of King Solomon ’ s Temple. To unravel the mystery further, it is useful to review the broad sweep of populations that carried different religious outlooks through the region and to Europe and Britain. Modern advances in genetic mapping have made this possible. DNA loci in human genes now provide a rough evolutionary profile. Nei and Roychourdhury completed a study of twenty-six human population groups in 1993. The cluster diagram below shows their data, as reprocessed by the author. 129 The dendrogram or phylogenetic tree shows the relationship between population groups. The distance between various groups provides an evolutionary time scale. It assumes a constant gene mutation rate. Unfortunately this can also lead to some absurd results, such the conclusion that South Asians and Polynesians developed long before the Greater Asian Supercluster of the Tibetans, Japanese and Koreans, and also long before the Caucasians groups such as the Germans, English, Italians and Iranians. A second major assumption in the phylogenetic map is that there must be a distinct root race and an Eve , a single point start to humanity. This assumption is incorrect. First, consider the age-old paradox of what came first, the hen or the egg . Of course, the answer is an earlier kind of hen. 130 Those of us that secretly harbour a romantic conception of Eve might need to catch their breath because around 65 to 125 million years ago, Eve was a rat-like creature called a Mus musculus . This Eve is not only the ancestor of humans, but also the common ancestor of humans and mice. 131 Cluster mathematics is a description technique, not a predictor. It measures correlation and correlation does not mean causation. In fact, the cluster diagram below shows Africa mathematically separated from the remainder of the world. Of course, humans in Africa share the same genes as humans elsewhere. There is simply more variance between Africans and Asians than between Caucasians and Asians. To complicate matters further, eighty-five percent of all variance occurs within populations and only fifteen percent among populations. 132 This means there is usually far greater genetic diversity between members of a"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 46 Cluster Analysis of Data by Nei and Roychourdhury, 1993 133 "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 47 population than there is between populations. In other words, geneticists are working with a little information in the midst of a lot of noise. Neither noise nor mathematical debates deter grand theories. As Africa has the most fossils, traditional geneticists claim the phylogenetic map supports linearity to Africa. They believe mankind reached fulldevelopment in Africa and from there spread to the rest of the world. Scholars call this linear African root race approach the out-of-Africa theory of humankind. 134 These traditional genetic evolutionists are pleased that the phylogenetic map is generally consistent with data on morphological differences, the geographic distribution of populations and archeology. Yet, there is inconsistency with dental, cranial and other paleontological factors and with linguistics that causes equal uneasiness with the phylogenetic map . 135 A major enigma for those with a dogged belief in the phylogenetic map is the Australian and Papuan groups. These have the physical characteristics of the Africans (dark skin, frizzled hair, etc) but a genetic mix more akin to Asians and Caucasians than Africans. This genetic m é lange remains highly controversial. Some rationalize it away as the result of gene admixture between two interbreeding migrations. Sadly, the Out-of-Africa theory and phylogenetic map do not provide an elegant solution to evolution. To achieve closer conformity of the phylogenetic map , researchers are drilling down to detail that is even more microscopic. Study of microsatellite loci of DNA may shed additional light on why the theory is inconsistent with physical evidence. There are three additional problems in delving into these microsatellite positions and codes. The first is that the microsatellite loci can have a number of forms in some groups but only one in other groups. The second issue is that the mutation rate is not uniform but varies considerably from locus to locus. A final issue is common to all genetic research in evolution. This is that populations are rapidly blending through intermarriage, which leads to diffuse homogeneity . In brief, it means that researchers are rapidly running out of pure lineage for research. It is useful to look at the same genetic data in the phylogenetic map from the perspective of underlying factors. Factor analysis extracts those few factors that statistically explain nearly all the variance observed between populations. It is quite a robust analytical technique."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 48 Factor Analysis of Nei and Roychourdhury Data, 1993 136 (each axis represents the correlation domain from +1 to – 1, see the previous Cluster diagram for more detail of particular groups in each Supercluster such as the Greater Asians) Factor Analysis of Nei and Takezaki Data, 1996 137 ( Chimpanzees are not closely related to any of Africans, Asians or Caucasians)"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 49 Factor analysis of the data from Nei and Roychourdhury shows that ninety six percent of the variance is explained by just three distinct factors. From an inspection of the data, we can call them geographically an Asian Factor, Caucasian Factor and African Factor. It is interesting to note in the three-dimensional plot above just how distinctly separated the African group is from the Asians and Caucasians. The three factors directly relate to the main regional population groups we noted earlier in the cluster analysis. The main factor, which explains sixty five percent of the variance in the data, is the Asian Factor. This factor is closely associated with the populations of Tibet, Mongolia, South China and Thailand through to Polynesia and Papua. It correlates inversely to the African Pygmies, Nigerians and Bantus. The second factor is Caucasoid, with population groups that span from North India and Iran through Germany and Italy to Finland and England. The third factor turns out to be composed solely of the African population groups, the Pygmies, Nigerians and Bantus. The North and South Amerindians show a strong inverse correlation to the Africans, which may imply a closer relation to Caucasians and Asians than to Africans. Comparison with a Chimpanzee only highlights the major differences between groups further. The clear genetic distinctions between the three geographical population groups bring us to the main opposing hypothesis to the out-of-Africa theory. This second hypothesis is the multiregional theory . It is a linear theory for pluralists. The theory suggests that over the last one million years Homo Sapiens evolved from Homo Erectus more or less simultaneously in Europe, East Asia, Australia and Africa. 138 There were many migrations into and out of Africa. While this theory has greater consistency with our modern understanding of the linguistic roots of population groups, it leaves many traditional genetic evolutionists quite incredulous. The main elements of DNA and linguistics analysis necessitate a new bridging theory of population crucibles. The elements of this theory have been in existence since George Todaro and his team at the US National Cancer Institute began investigating Type C virus antibodies twenty years ago. Nowadays, evidence is rapidly accumulating to support his surprising conclusions."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 50 Amphipithecus / Propliopithecus / Aegyptopithecus (all date back to 40m ya) 10m ya 40,000 ya Pliocene 5m ya 20m ya Proconsol Apes - No fossil skulls of Chimpanzees or Gorillas have yet been found Many Extinct Lines Proconsol Types of Australpithecus: Telantropus Man @ 1.5 m ya; Parantropus Man @ 3.0m ya Australopithecus Boisei @ 1.5m ya Others Proto Australopithecus Common Chimpanzee Pygmy Chimpanzee Most likely the Australopithecus group was hairy, retained estrus, non- aquatic but nevertheless relatively successful bi- pedal hominoids Boisei Extinct c 1m ya 0.4m ya Homo Sapien Homo Habilis 3m ya 1.5-1.0m ya Homo Erectus Africanus (gracile) Robustus Others PERIOD OF MISSING FOSSILS APE- men c 5m ya MAN- apes c 6m ya 'Southern' Ape and Many Diverse Types Outnumbered Aquatic Apes Others Ramapithecus (Rift Valley) c 14m ya to 7m ya Extinct Rama Ape Proto Ramapithecus Aquatic Apeman 'Estuarine Man Loss of Estrus' Africanus Major Afarensis (Lucy) 0.04m ya Homo Sapien Sapien MODERN MAN Non-hairy, Non-Estrus, Variable Build to Gracile Gorilla Formation of the Afro-Asiatic Supercluster ( ‘ ya ’ means years ago, ‘ m ’ means million years & ‘ c ’ means circa) Present "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 51 DNA patterns have shown us that modern man is very similar to all the apes including Asian Orangutans, African Gorillas and Chimpanzees. The time at which each of the various species diverged from each other remains a matter of considerable uncertainty in academic circles. Estimates are little more than tentative speculations based on assumed average mutation rates and an arbitrary sizing of the time scale. However, we can reasonably hypothesize that the separation with Orangutans was about twelve million years ago and if so, the split with the Gorillas and Chimps would perhaps have been about twenty million years ago. Absolute timing is not as important as the geographical coincidence. The new Crucibles theory begins about forty million years ago with our ancestral tree dwellers, the Dryopithecines , who lived in the trees of Africa and Asia. In Africa they were called the Aegyptopithecus and Propliopithecus and in Asia the Amphipithecus . We know that in Africa the tree dwelling Aegyptopithecus sub- divided into the Proconsol group of Gorillas and Chimpanzees, and the hominoid Ramapithecus . With the discovery of the fossilized remains of an Australopithecus who lived about 3 to 4 million years ago, dubbed Lucy , the theory that man developed from the Proconsols gained popularity. Lucy was just over one metre high and walked upright. She provided a unique insight into what a Man-ape in Africa might have looked like. We must be careful to understand that Australopithecus was not halfway on the path to modern man in any linear sense but rather one of many hybrids that emerged, for a while, in parallel to both the Proconsols and Man. Australopithecus became extinct about two million years ago. The African proto-humans called Ramapithecus emerged in the Rift Valley of Africa between fourteen million and seven million years ago. This valley extends from the Danakil Depression, south of the Red Sea, well into South Africa. Ramapithecus then plunged into the period that gives modern archeology its biggest headache because there are no fossils. This is the Pliocene Era , a period of four million years where there are absolutely no fossils of either hominoids or apes. One tentative theory for the absence of human fossils in the Pliocene Era is that a great drought in Central Africa forced the hominoids to become aquatic waders , isolated in the Afar Gulf. 139 This Gulf lies in the Rift Valley of Africa, south of the Danakil Alps. 140 "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 52 Emergence of the Afro-Asiatic Language Groups and the cradle of Man in the ‘ Danakil Alps ’ of Afar Gulf of the Rift Valley at the southern end of the Red Sea"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 53 Some believe that in this aquatic environment female hominoids lost the characteristic of estrus. 141 Estrus is the phenomena of going on heat at a particular time of every month. We see it in all mammals except modern woman and Orangutans, where it has all but extinguished. In other coincidences, man and Orangutans are the only species to be ticklish and use tools. If the hominoids became aquatic waders , they seemed to return to land about three million years ago. Researchers find fossils of Homo Habilus at this time. The trail then leads confidently on once more to Homo Erectus and to the black, hairy African Neanderthal called Homo Sapien . He was characterized by an Occipital Bun or Skull Bone Ridge . Then about forty thousand years ago the modern successor of Homo Sapien emerged from the Rift Valley in Africa. He is Homo Sapien (Sapien) and was very robust. Homo Sapien (Sapien) rapidly spread to West Africa as Bantus and to Europe as Cro-Magnon Man . We now turn to Asia where a separate crucible developed from the Amphipithecus tree dwellers of forty million years ago. Amphipithecus and Aegyptopithecus of the African Rift Valley are closely related. Indeed, they were probably the same group for all genetic purposes. Around twenty million years ago, the same Proconsol split occurred in Asia as in Africa. However, in Asia, Amphipithecus split into the proto-humanoid Sivapithecus and the Gibbon line rather than the Gorilla and Chimpanzee as in Africa. As mentioned above, about twelve million years ago the hairy Orangutans split from the hominoids. We call the hominoids of this period Sivapithecus . Until eight million years ago, Sivapithecus gave rise to many lines in Asia, such as the Siva/Rama Ape , that have since become extinct. As in Africa, the Pliocene drought might well have forced Sivapithecus to the water ’ s edge as an aquatic wading ape-man that we might call Estuary-man . Similarly, the hairy Orangutan became the aquatic Orangutan . As with Ramapithecus , the females of both the Sivapithecus hominoids and the Orangutans became non-estrus due to their aquatic environment. Another result of the supposed aquatic phase in man's development was that man's pheromones largely disappeared.

Harkening back to an earlier time of evolution, pheromone glands are still to be found all over a five month foetus. There is a continuing similarity between Sivapithecus in Asia and Ramapithecus in Africa implying that to this point they were both practically the same. Yet, two distinct sub-groups were definitely emerging, notwithstanding the similaritiesThis is where the work of George Todaro ’ s team is important in upsetting the assumption of linearity in evolutionary theory. 143 His DNA research has shown that all African apes and monkeys possess Type C Virus antibodies of the highly infectious baboon plague virus. 144 These antibodies are conspicuously absent in Asian apes and man. In 2002, Dutch researchers found evidence of a similar AIDS-related epidemic that wiped out huge numbers of chimpanzees 2.5 to 3 million years ago, which is why current chimpanzees don ’ t develop AIDS. 145 The uncannily monogamous Gibbon and the Orangutan are distinctly associated with the Asian group. This provides compelling evidence that the evolutionary path of man was in Asia for a long time. A theory is gaining currency that Asian groups seem to have migrated, or returned to Africa after populations in Africa were wiped-out by airborne baboon plague. This controversial version of the Multi-regional Theory dates to 1976 but is now supported by studies in Asia and Africa of the YAP haplotype of the male Y-chromosome, passed from father to son, and the beta-globin gene on chromosome eleven inherited from both parents. 146 Variations at chromosome twenty-one also suggest that there were three distinct areas of human development. 147 These were Europe, Asia and Oceania. Sometimes DNA studies confirm what we already feel about our proximity to the Asian Orangutan. For example, a visit to the Orangutans at the local zoo provides a pleasantly unnerving communication experience. Now we have established the major population crucibles, we will move as quickly as possible along to the importance of these crucibles for our story of alchemy and religion. Gigantpithecus or the Yeti Snowman split from Sivapithecus about five million years ago in Asia. By one million years ago Java Man emerged as the Proto-Peking man.

Solo Man , the Asian Neanderthal called Tien Shan , followed in the period to two hundred and fifty thousand years. At forty thousand years, the Asian Homo Sapien (Sapien) or Modern Man emerged in Asia as in Africa. In contrast to his African counterpart, Asian Modern Man was light skinned, non-hairy and had a variable build. In the period from one hundred thousand to twenty thousand years ago, the hairy black skinned Neanderthal expanded from the Rift Valley in Africa to the Middle East and Europe. He did not reach Scandinavia. The DNA of a Neanderthal found at D ü sseldorf differs significantly from modern humans. 148 Other Negroid Neanderthals that moved east were the Australoid- Caucasian Veddahs of Southern India and the hairy Australian Aborigine . In the Middle East, Neanderthals dislodged the primitive aboriginal tribes of the Ugric and the Kirgis . The Ugric people were Finnish or Magyar and lived east and south of the Ural Mountains. The Kirgis lived in Turkic, from the Kirgiz Steppes to an area between the Caspian and Aral Seas and Lake Balkhash. Possibly these Neanderthals were found in the east to Lake Baikal and the Altai Mountains. These primitive Ugric and Turkic tribes of the Kirgiz Steppes relocated north to the Siberian Plains. They became the race we now call the Mongols. Remnants of these populations remain today as the Mongol-Caucasoid Ugric Laplanders , Samoyed Voguls , and Yukahir Eskimos . About one hundred thousand years ago, Caucasians separated from Mongolian races. The Mongols moved east to the Great Plain of China, between the Huang-Ho and Yangtze Rivers. To the south lay the Nan Shan Mountains beyond which lived Australoid-Caucasian people of Negroid origin. In moving into the Great Plain of China, the Mongols dislodged the hairy Ainu who dwelled in Korea and Manchuria. The Ainu migrated to Japan, the remote Kamchatka Peninsular of Siberia and the Bering Sea. About thirty thousand years ago, they escaped even further to Taiwan and the Philippines. The Mongols then migrated to North America across the Bering Strait land bridge, which at that time linked Siberia and Alaska. This bridge closed some thirty thousand years ago but became available again in the period from twelve thousand to ten thousand years ago.

Returning to the main Asian Crucible, we find that anthropologists know little about the original homelands of the Asian Homo Sapien (Sapien) in the Interglacial period between the Second and First Ice Ages. Romantic, albeit pervasive myths of the Aryans suggest that the Asian Homo Sapien (Sapien) enjoyed a Golden Age in their Hyperborean pre-Arctic homeland. This Hyperborean means beyond the North Wind and has a special relationship to Britain as the homeland of the great teachers. 149 Vedic Hymns praised this fabled homeland as The Paradise . A Tibetan legend tells of a city to the north of the Gobi Desert in today's Northern China, called Shambhala or the Hidden City of Goodness , founded by Manu the Priest King and Great Lawmaker of the Indo-Hittite Aryans. In his merit or caste system of social stability, Manu: 150 ... clearly saw that men are distinguished by natural evolution into four great classes: those capable of offering service to society through their bodily labor (Sudras); those who serve through mentality, skill, agriculture, trade, commerce, business life in general (Vaisyas); those whose talents are administrative, executive, and protective (Kshatriyas); those of a contemplative nature, spiritually inspired and inspiring (Brahmins). ‘ Neither birth nor sacraments nor study nor ancestry can decide whether a person is twice born (i.e. a Brahmin) ’ the Mahabharata [Great Lord] declares, ‘ character and conduct only can decide. ’ Manu instructed society to show respect to its members insofar as they possessed wisdom, virtue, age, kinship or lastly, wealth. Riches in Vedic India were always despised if they were hoarded or not available for charitable purposes. Ungenerous men of great wealth were assigned a low rank in society. The exceedingly sophisticated Vedic social system, based on agape or charity of fellowship , is unusual for a time many thousands of years ago. Some would argue that our current democracies are only now regaining the poignant elegance of anonymous philanthropy. The environment of the Asian crucible was not to remain benign. An Ice Age made the hyperborean homeland of the Asian Homo Sapien (Sapien) uninhabitable twenty eight thousand years ago. The white skinned peoples departed south to the Russian Steppes. By twenty thousand years ago, they moved into Europe and eliminated the"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 59 Neanderthals there. In fifteen thousand three hundred, they populated the city of Asgar (or Asgartha) in Northern India. The Brahmatmas emerged as a priestly caste who venerated fire as the symbol of their godhead. Asgerd was also the traditional home of the Norse god Odin, which was thought to be near the Euxine or Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, thirty miles north of Lake Van. The Asian Homo Sapien (Sapien) called Aryans who plunged into the Indus Valley in today ’ s Pakistan were a warrior society. They lived in tents, were patriarchal and polygamous. Their sky gods were of lightning, storm, sun, wind and fire. Culturally they placed great emphasis on the oral transmission of mythology and they prohibited writing. These characteristics will prove uncannily insightful markers for the Indo-Hittite group in later chapters. The Ice Age of twenty eight thousand years ago began to thaw fourteen thousand years ago. In ten thousand BCE, another bitter ice age called the Snap Ice Age quickly followed it. This forced more waves of Caucasian Homo Sapien (Sapien) migration into Mesopotamia, Bactria and up the Danube River into Europe. Following the Snap Ice Age a warm interglacial period was quickly reestablished that favored agriculture. About five thousand five hundred BCE, an urban type Samara civilization arose at Eridu in Sumer and in the Nile and Indus Valleys. First dynasty Egyptian society emerged in about 3400BCE. Studies of the Y-chromosome in European populations provide additional evidence for population movements in the last twelve thousand years. Factor analysis of European DNA polymorphism shows four principal components that correspond to geographical and historical population movements across Europe. 151 The most dominant component is consistent with the well- documented wave of Neolithic farmers from the Middle East nine thousand five hundred years ago. It accounts for twenty-eight percent of population variation. The second principal component matches the arrival of Finno-Ugric and Samoyeds speakers from the Western Siberian Lowland, following the Snap Ice Age. This polymorphism accounts for twenty-two percent of the geographic variation between populations in Europe. The third and fourth principal components each account for eleven percent. These are the westward migration of nomads from Bronze Age Don-Volga, above the Caspian Sea, and Greek colonial expansion in the first millennium BCE."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 60 The Indo-Hittite movements came from Asian Homo Sapien (Sapien) domination of the area around the Caspian and Aral Seas. This developed into the crucible of the Indo-Hittite Language Group. 152 Its two primary sub-groups were the Indo-Europeans and the Anatolian group that included the Hittites , Etruscans and Lydians . The Indo-European group is the Kurgan people. It included the Celts , Italic Latins , the Gothic Anglo Saxons , Norse, Germans , Greeks , Phrygians , Albanians , Armenians and Baltic-Slavs . It also included the highly successful Indo-Iranians such as the Persians and the Modern Indo-Aryan Indians . Indo-European Kurgan (or Barrow ) people crossed into Europe above the Black Sea in about 4250BCE. They traveled on horses from the Russian Steppes west of the Ural Mountains and followed the Danube into Europe, razing relatively peaceful agrarian cultures everywhere they went. The Kurgan people finally reached Ireland from Britain in about 1700BCE. Other Kurgan waves followed into Europe between 3400BCE and 2800BCE. The were joined by waves of Bronze Age Scandinavian peoples traveling south down the Volga, Danube and Dneiper Rivers to escape rapid climate deterioration in the Sub-Boreal Period of 2000BCE. 153 These were the tall, blond and red-headed seafarers who founded the Mycenaean civilization in the 16 th century BCE. Even prior to this they had journeyed by sea to Britain where they established Mycenaean civilization in Wessex from the beginning of the 2 nd millennium BCE, before it had arrived in Greece. 154 Gradually the Kurgans spread southwards into the Macedonian plain and western Anatolia. They appear in Mesopotamia as Hurrians , Mitanni and Kassites . 155 In Greece, they were the Achaeans who established the Mycenaean civilization and subsequently the Dorians from the small state of Doris, who destroyed it. 156 These early Anatolian and Mesopotamian Kurgans worshipped the Indo-Hittite trinity of Mitra, Varuna and Indra. 157 Much later, in 1400BCE, the tough Hurrian Mitanni in Asia Minor still worshipped this same male trinity. The Achaeans , who were the first to invade Greece, ultimately joined with the Pelasgians and Ionians . In doing so, they succumbed to the religion of the Triple Goddess, which was the ancient religion of the other main crucible, the Afro-Asiatics."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 61 The Kurgans violently sacked cities in Europe as they had in the Indus Valley. Their culture was highly mobile and war-oriented. Everywhere they became the ruling class. A number of invasions also reached Britain from North Africa. The first was in about 2000BCE when the Beaker people made their way via Libya, Mauritania, Spain and France to Southern Ireland and Wales. The Picts departed North Africa by sea and invaded Northern Ireland and Scotland in 1250BCE. 158 The Picts, who have Mongol traits, are a good example of re-migration to Africa. Like the Dacians, Thracians, Scythians and Moschians, the Picts were cannibalistic, heavily tattooed and dyed their bodies with blue indigotin called woad . 159 Their women also died their bodies in blue woad and were equally fearless in battle. The Picts were somewhat renowned for copulating in public. 160 Ancient histories of the Druids also record the colonization of England by the Indo-Hittite Hyperborean tribe of Albion in the fourth millennium BCE, and later by the Trojans in 1115BCE. 161 The legends of the Franks also claim that the Merovingians descended from the Trojans. The Archangel Michael, St George and Minerva Britannia became respectively the patron Angel, Saint and Goddess of God's Countenance in Britain. Not surprisingly, they are also equivalent to the patrons of ancient Israel being Michael the Protector, Moses and the Shekhinah. The commonality of British and Israelite colonization harkens back to a perceived common Indo-Hittite source in Anatolia, which we shall look at in more detail in Chapter 17. The warm interglacial period that followed the Snap Ice Age also drew Semitic speaking peoples from the Ethiopian Highlands back to the Near East and Asia Minor. These were now nomadic sheep and goat herders and their routes to Canaan passed through Egypt, South Arabia and Sumer. The origin of the Semites is well understood from their language, which forms one of six groups in the Afro-Asiatic cluster of the African Homo Sapien (Sapien) . The other groups are Berber , Beja , Egyptian , Cushitic and Chadic peoples. 162 The Semites have four sub-groups. The oldest is the Akkadian or Assyro Babylonian group that invaded the Arabian Peninsular and Sumer. The North Central group is comprised of Modern Hebrew , Ugaritic , Phoenician , Aramaic and Syriac . Arabic is a separate South Central group.

However, the Akkadians were different. Although we do not have any evidence of when they first appeared in the Zagros Mountains, in present day Kurdistan, it seems the Akkadians were there at the dawn of prehistory. There they mixed with Indo-Iranian warrior tribes. From this region, they massed invasions of the fertile Tigris-Euphrates Valley. The well-armed Akkadian Semite King Sharru-Kin , who we call Sargon I, eventually dominated, seizing control of Upper Mesopotamia in 2380BCE. 163 Sharru-Kin did not erase civilization in the manner of the Indo- Iranians but fused with Sumerian culture over his fifty-five year reign. He adopted their system of writing and built a grand new capital in northern Mesopotamia called Agade , which became the richest city in the world. The name Sharru-Kin means Righteous Ruler and is remarkable for its concept of self-restraint and Goodness. The same belief underlies that of Indo-Hittite Zoroastrianism that we will look at in Chapter 8. From at least this time onwards in Sumer, as in Egypt, the code word Righteous indicated the kingly right of divine rule. Righteous and Good have become the common descriptions of an underlying esoteric current or heritage that has continued to exist throughout recorded history. With Indo-Hittite inspiration, the Semite-Akkadians then circled above Mesopotamia to Damascus. There a group became the well- documented tribe of Abraham. As such, Sharru-Kin foreshadows Abraham, Melchizedek the Priest King of Righteousness in Salem and the Essenes ’ Teacher of Righteousness . We will look at these further in Chapter 5 and Chapter 11. Something dreadfull occurred around 2300BCE. It shattered the earliers urban civilizations around the globe. The Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia collapsed, as did the Egyptian Old Kingdom, the Early Bronze Age civilization in Anatolia, Israel and Greece, the civilization in India ’ s Indus Valley, the Hilmand civilization in Afghanistan and the Hongshan civilization in China. In Mespootamia, the barbarian Gutians conquered Sharru-Kin ‘ s grand city Agade . They descended upon Mesopotamia from the Zoreb Mountains in 2120BCE. They destroyed the whole of Sumer and the Sumerians only managed to regain independence a century later. Even then peace was not to last. The next wave of Semites, the Semitic Amorites arrived from the western deserts just a decade later. This"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 63 instability in the north of Mesopotamia allowed the black-skinned Dravidian speaking Elamites to enter the south and capture Ur in 2004BCE. The Elamites continued to exert influence over Babylonia for the next 200 years. Bitter internecine struggles ensued in Asia Minor until the Babylonian King Hammurabi emerged as a successful military leader in 1848BCE. He zealously protected his borders from the Persian Gulf to the Western Mediterranean Sea. Hammurabi was also highly regarded as a cultural leader. His major achievement was to codify the laws of Babylonian life. The legal innovations Hammurabi introduced were quite similar to those that had just occurred in Egypt under Amenemhe I and his son Ses ô stris I. It was also about this time that Sumer became Babylonia. Innovative though it was, Hammurabi ’ s code was still based on the crude law of retaliation and blood-feud: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise . 164 In this respect it was inferior to King Shulgi ’ s Ur- Nammu Code. 165 King Shulgi, who reigned in Sumer from 2095- 2047BCE, introduced a very advanced form of law for Ur-Nammu. It provided only for compensation to a wronged party. For example, If a man knocks out the eye of another man, he shall weigh out one-half a mina of silver . Indo-Hittite Aryans called Hittites occupied the central plateau of Anatolia in this same period. The language structure of Anatolia became extraordinarily complex. Old Anatolian Indo-Hittite groups were scattered into small pockets such as the Lydians to the West, the Palaic in the North, and the Carians , Luvians of the South. The powerful Hittites and Hurrians together with the Western Semitic peoples controlled the prosperous east of Anatolia, which was developing mineral resources for Bronze Age trade throughout the Middle East. We shall see in the next two chapters that their wealth brought an avalanche of trouble to the region. Enter the Egyptians."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 64 Chapter 5 Anatolian Commagene & Israelites The Commagene is a region of intense historical intrigue in today ’ s Turkey. It lies on the upper Euphrates, in the centre of a prosperous Bronze Age area famous for metalworking. It is here that wool and flax production began ten thousand years ago and copper smelting a thousand years later. 166 In 5400BCE, inhabitants of the nearby Zagros Mountains of Northern Iran first produced wine. Mt Ararat and Kurdistan border the Commagene in the east. Colchis, sorceress Medea's country and the land of initiation, bounds the Commagene in the north. Her rivers ran with gold. Her hero, Jason, captured the mythical Golden Fleece . Four great rivers flow from the flat alluvial plateau of the Commagene. These are the Tigris, Euphrates, Murat and Araks. The Tigris and Euphrates flow south to the Persian Gulf, the Murat River flows into the Euphrates and the Araks River flows to the Caspian Sea. The Biblical Eden has four similar rivers, the Pishon, Gihon, Hiddekel and Euphrates. 167 Commagene temple worship dates back to very ancient times. In 1996, a Heidelberg University team discovered a temple and village dating from one thousand BCE in the Sanli-Urfa region of the Harran Plain. It is perhaps the richest of all similar villages noted in world archaeological literature. The people of the Harran Plain used to go to this temple every spring for religious ceremonies. The excavations have so far revealed a sculptured lion, seven steles, three statues of people and flooring consisting of four layers of mosaics. Excavation of the site will take two decades. The Commagene became known as Kutmuhi in Assyrian times from 1300BCE to 612BCE. After this, the Commagene passed into Persian control. It later became an important part of the Silk Road because of its natural access to Asia Minor, Uzbekistan, Bukhara and the Steppes of Russia. The region effectively remained outside the Roman Empire until 67CE and this allowed it to retain a number of Indo-Hittite star cults involving Magi. The most well know of these was the Royal Cult of the Kings of Commagene. 168 "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 65 "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 66 Moving back in time by two thousand years, to early Bronze Age Anatolia, we find the Egyptians taking a great interest in the metallurgy and wealth of the area. In about 1950BCE the twelfth dynasty Pharaoh Ses ô stris I, Senwostre I in Greek, campaigned by land and sea as far as the outer perimeter of the Black Sea. Ses ô stris I ’ s father, Amenemhe I, was the first Pharaoh of the twelfth dynasty. At times father and son ruled as co-regents. Their predecessor, Montjuhotep II, had reunited Egypt through a series of Thebian wars just before two thousand BCE. The post-war economic revival of a united Upper and Lower Egypt led to immense wealth and power. Ses ô stris I consolidated the economic power of Egypt through a series of aggressive military campaigns in both Lower Egypt and abroad. He secured the richly fertile region of Wawat in Nubia, south of Elephantine. Ses ô stris ’ military forts controlled all the desert and river caravan routes up to the second cataract. 169 Together Amenemhe I and his son Ses ô stris I reestablished the old system of Pharaonic divinity in Egypt. They introduced law reforms and a new and progressive administrative system based on state religion. The Crata Repoa may describe their system of qualification for office (see Appendix 7). The seven liberal arts blossomed in Egypt. It was a time of unusual literature such as the philosophical journey A Man ’ s Dispute with His Own Soul and the popular Story of Sinuhe . 170 Monumental, ashlar architecture flourished. Amenemhe I established a greenfields royal capital at Itjtawy, 20km south of Sakkara and Memphis. Adjacent to it he built one of the most beautiful funerary pyramid complexes in all Pharaonic history. The wealth and grandeur of the twelfth dynasty came from mineral resources. Amenemhe I mined amethyst in the Wadi el-Hudi, which is east of Elephantine. 171 Ses ô stris I entered the Wadi Hammamat in the Coptos region to mine materials such as galena, the mineral of lead, and dark colored sandstone called greywacke. 172 His expedition was nineteen thousand men strong. Many other twelfth dynasty expeditions exploited the turquoise and copper mines at Serabit el-Khadim, Timna and Wadi Maghara in southern Sinai."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 67 Campaigns of Ses ô stris I to Buhen in the Nubian Wawat, Thrace, Colchis, and the Commagene, and into the Wadi Hammamat"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 68 Sir Flinders Petrie excavated Serabit el-Khadim ’ s temple of Hathor-Baalat in 1905. 173 It dates from the time of Ses ô stris I in 1800BCE and is one of the oldest rock-cut temples in Egyptian architecture. These hard-rock underground turquoise mines at Serabit el- Khadim were active as early as three thousand four hundred BCE. They produced beautiful stones, some of which were set in the bracelets of Egypt ’ s Queen Zer. These bracelets are amongst the oldest jewelry in the world. Serabit el-Khadim ’ s temple of Hathor-Baalat consisted of a long series of courts leading to an underground sanctuary. 174 Bas-reliefs and inscriptions show the kings of the Old and Middle Kingdoms as gods. However, the front building of the temple is oddly un-Egyptian, being asymmetrical and elongated. Sir Flinders Petrie mentions fifty tons of mysterious white powder that he discovered beneath the floor of the Temple. He thought it was most likely wood ash from the burning of sacrifices but he was unable to provide any reason why this odd white powder was apparently stored under the floor slabs. The nearby Wadi Nasb produced evidence of copper smelting works but different ash. 175 Ses ô stris I ’ s remarkable 1950BCE expedition across the Mediterranean Sea ventured into Thrace in Eastern Greece, Scythia and Colchis in Georgia. He was most likely seeking, smelting technology for the manufacture of tin and bronze, and possibly the source of Baltic Amber. Ses ô stris was to leave a permanent reminder of his visit to Colchis. In the words of Herodotus: 176 ... For the fact is, as I first came to realize myself, and then heard from others later, that the Colchians are obviously Egyptian. When the notion occurred to me, I asked both the Colchians and the Egyptians about it, and found that the Colchians had better recall of the Egyptians than the Egyptians did of them. Some Egyptians said they thought the Colchians originated with Ses ô stris' army, but I myself guessed their Egyptian origin not only because the Colchians are dark-skinned and curly-haired (which does not count for much by itself, because these features are common to others too), but more importantly because Colchians, Egyptians, and Ethiopians are the only peoples of the world who practice circumcision and have always done so. ... The obvious antiquity of the custom in Egypt and Ethiopia prevents me from saying whether the Egyptians learnt it from the Ethiopians or vice versa, but"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 69 what convinces me that the other peoples learnt it as a result of their contact with Egypt is that any Phoenicians who have come into contact with Greece have stopped copying the Egyptians with respect to their genitalia, and do not cut off their children's foreskin. And let me mention one more way the Colchians resemble the Egyptians: these two peoples alone work linen, and they do so in the same way. In fact, their lifestyles in general and their languages are similar. The Greeks call Colchian linen Sardonian, while the linen that comes from Egypt is called Egyptian. Powerful Ses ô stris I destroyed many cities on his expedition. He sent back to Egypt prisoners as well as metal such as lead and silver. 177 He also relocated Caucasian metalworkers to cities in the Levant and the Sinai under Egyptian influence. 178 The famous Story of Sinuhe illustrates the extent of Egyptian subjugation of the Levant and Syria. The story has always been highly regarded. 179 Sinuhe was a courtier who unwittingly overheard state secrets at the death of Amenemhe I, father of Ses ô stris I. Fearing for his life Sinuhe escaped into Canaan and traveled to Byblos (in the Lebanon). There he turned homewards and traveled to Upper Rtnw , thought to be a town in Southern Syria, and became an adviser to the local king. Afterwards he became a rich man. In Rtnw , Sinuhe saw many messengers arrive from Pharaoh Ses ô stris I and the Syrian princes offer humble deference to Egypt. He saw the resolve of the Pharaoh to smite the Bedouin and Asiatics, such as the Hurrians, infringing upon his suzerainty. Pharaoh Ses ô stris I finally forgave Sinuhe. After many years, the Pharaoh invited him back to Egypt and there saw out his days. The proto-Israelites lived in the Anatolian Commagene after their priestly tribe, a cult of Brahm called the Calani, migrated from Bactria, on the border of Iran and Afghanistan. 180 Their godhead Yahweh was to begin with the metalworking god Q're Adonai. 181 Q're means furnace or metalwork. We need to understand a little more of Q're Adonai ’ s widespread importance . Qera (or Kt r w h ss ) was the Western Semitic Ugaritic god of metalwork and artisanship. At the time of Pharaoh Tuthmose III, the Syrians worshipped him as the great god Kir . Curetes are young men who shaved their hair at the feast of Comyria and sacrifice these hair-trimmings to the God Q're . 182 Initially, they were the sacrificial king ’ s armed companions who attended the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 70 Triple Goddess Q're ’ s holocaust and in later times sacrificed a child to the god Cronos. 183 Qouros was a god of Thera, today ’ s Island of Santorini . 184 After the eruption of the volcano, the island was renamed Qera after this god. 185 Qouros and Qera have the same meaning of cauldron, melting pot or furnace as the Canaanite k û r. The Sumerian word KUR describes a cone-shape. 186 Baetylos are similar omphali, or cone-shaped pillars that the Greeks worshipped by anointing with oil, wine and blood. 187 KUR also represents an iron furnace, a round temple to Sabazios with a hole at the top and a beehive. The same word KUR also means mountain and the House that is like a mountain . 188 For example, the Mesopotamian Inanna descended to the KUR , or symbolic chamber of the underworld, risking all: 189 Inanna set out for the underworld. Ninshubur her faithful servant went with her. Inanna spoke to her saying: ... .I am descending to the KUR, to the underworld. If I do not return set up a lament for me by the ruins ... Go to Nippur, to the temple of Enlil. When you enter his holy shrine cry out 'O father Enlil, do not let your daughter be put to death in the underworld ... If Enlil will not help you, go to Ur, to the temple of Nanna. Weep before Father Nanna. If Nanna will not help you go to Eridu, to the temple of Enki. Weep before Father Enki. Father Enki, the God of Wisdom, knows the food of life, he knows the water of life, he knows the secrets. Surely he will not let me die.' The symbol of the mountain KUR is three small hillocks in an equilateral triangular pattern. 190 KUR-KUR also means holy plant, which is the common lily of the field or bright lilac crocus flower . 191 As protection from the fiery breath of the Minoan bull, Medea gave Jason the blood-red juice of the two-stalked, saffron-colored Causican crocus, the potent flower that first sprang from the blood of Prometheus. 192 The ancients used this poisonous colchium or meadow saffron as a remedy for gout. 193 The Indo-Hittite root KUR occurs in the name of the Kirgis people who lived in Kirgiz Steppes of Turkic and the alternative name for the Indo-Hittites, the Kurgan people. The root K û r is also the same as Car . It occurs in many place names, such as the ancient name for Harran in the Commagene, Carrhae. The Cara ï te sect was similar to the Essenes. Ancient Cara ï te is the language of the Damascus Document, an excommunication text of the Dead Sea Scrolls."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 71 The Quirites of Rome came from the Sabine town of Qures. 194 Sabian practices provide a unique insight into the unusual religion of the Commagene but we defer this discussion of the Sabians until Chapter 8. Both Indo-Hittite and Afro-Asiatic roots to Q're, or Quera , imply that the same image of furnace is equally relevant to both cultural groups. 195 The abundance of evidence leaves little doubt as to the importance of this furnace-god or smithy-god to the Indo-Hittites and more particularly to the Israelites. Another of Yahweh's names confirms this. He was Elath-Iahu , the Kenite Smith god. As foreshadowed in Chapter 3, the latter part of the name, Iahu , had a very ancient provenance. It dates from about 2630BCE as a title of the god Set. Horus, the divine son of Osiris who overcame Osiris' brother Set, was the Calf Iahu . The Hyksos Israelites may well have heard this name for Yahweh in Egypt where he was analogous to Set. We know Iahu is a divine name of Yahweh because Solomon is specifically aware of it : 196 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much ... and he spake of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that is upon the wall. The hyssop is the tree of the winter solstice, IA, and the cedar was the tree of the summer solstice, HU. Together they make the divine name Iahu . We see the metalworking influence continued with the subset names of Tubal-cain and Hiram Abiff . In the Bible, Magog is a son of Japhet and a brother of Gomer , Madai , Javan , Tubal , Meshech and Tiras . 197 The ninth century Welsh monk Nennius summarized the sixth century Alanic genealogies of the French noble houses: 198 Japheth had seven sons; from the first named Gomer, descended the Galli; from the second, Magog, the Scythi and Gothi; from the third, Madian, the Medi; from the fourth, Juuan, the Greeks; from the fifth, Tubal, arose the Hebrei, Hispani, and Itali; from the sixth, Mosoch, sprung the Cappadoces; and from the seventh, named Tiras, descended the Thraces: these are the sons of Japheth, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech. Magog stands for Armenia and the brothers respectively to be the Cimmerians, Medians, Ionians, Tibarenians, Moschians and Tyrrhenians. The Tyrrhenians became the Etruscan civilization in parts of Italy. 199 "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 72 The Moschians and the iron-working Tibarenians of Tubal were tribes of the southeast Black Sea and the Commagene. 200 Ezekiel mentions King Gog of Meshech and Tubal , who is most likely Mithridates VI of Pontus. 201 Traditional histories hold that the Moschians became the Picts and the Cimmerians became the Cymry and moved to the Artic cold where they enjoy the midnight sun in June but is dark at midday in winter. 202 The Indo-Hittite invasions dispersed both those peoples and they eventually invaded Britain as we shall see in Chapter 12. 203 Turning now to Tubal, we find that Assyrian texts confirm Tabalu or Tubalin in central Anatolia was famous for its metalworking. 204 Tubal-ki of the Hittite texts, somewhere in the Caucasus region, is the Tabal of the Assyrian sources located in East Lycaonia, near Kayseri. This is where T û bal Qay î n or Tubal-Cain comes from. He is the archetypal artificer in metals described in the Book of Genesis and known as the master of all coppersmiths and blacksmiths . The last surviving remnants of these ancient northern Iranian peoples are the Ossetians in the Caucasus Mountains, who are descendants of the Sarmatian-Alans. 205 Their lands are now divided between the Russian Republic and the new state of Georgia. The Ossetians are the famous blacksmith tribe previously called Kalybs. Its name, Kalybs, became Latin for steel . Though threatened politically, militarily, and culturally from many directions over a thousand years, the Ossetians still speak their ancestral Iranian language with an archaic dialect, called Iron, meaning “ noble ” . They maintain an oral narrative referred to as the Nart sagas. These Nart sagas contain parallels with Arthurian legend so numerous and so uncannily close that it is impossible they are unrelated. There is an Ossetain basis for most of the prominent elements of the Arthurian cycle, including: • all the characters Arthur, Lancelot, Perceval, Galahad, Gawain, Kay, Tristan, Bedivere, Bors, Caradoc, King Ban de Benoich, the Maimed King, St. George, Elaine (Helaine), the Lady in the Lake, Merlin and others; • sacred swords, the ‘ sword in the stone ’ episode, King Arthur ’ s sword (Cali-burn) that bears a similar name to the tribe Kalybs, and throwing of the sword into a lake, which causes it to seethe, and the sword-rising-out-of-the-roiling-water;"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 73 • heads taken in battle and carried to the King for reward then scalped and made into cloaks of human hair; • sculls sliced, gilded and used as magical drinking cups; cauldrons of heavenly splendor that never run dry and appear at feasts before the bravest of the heroes; • Scythian griffins and Sarmatians dragons as magical beasts. The very name Sarmatian means lizard people; • the Sarmatians dragon used as a as military standard. The Sarmatians used a very particular battle standard, consisting of a silken windsock sewn into the shape of a serpentine dragon, which hissed when it filled with air as its bearer charged into battle; • women as warriors. Greek and Chinese described the Amazon women who were Scythian female warriors that fought alongside their men. Adam of Bremen wrote that these women lived along the Baltic Coast. 206 Saxo Grammaticus described the same women in Denmark. 207 He said: their eagerness for military glory was so strong that you would have thought they were no longer women ; and • women's chivalric role. An Iranian gold plaque from the Peter the Great ’ s Siberian collection dated around 300 BC shows a woman seated under a tree, holding a sleeping man ’ s head in her lap. Nearby a groom holds a pair of horses. His weapons hang in the branches of the tree. It is not difficult to recognize the scene of Arthur ’ s death. Tubal-Cain is another Bronze Age forerunner of Freemasonry ’ s Hiram Abiff , the archetypal architect of King Solomon ’ s Temple. 208 In fact, the name Hiram Abiff may simply be a refinement of Tubal-cain in the early Anatolian Iron Age because it derives from Abiff ‘ Aram where ‘ Aram means a metal ore from ayir or ayiram in Sanskrit and Dravidian (iron is ayil ). Abiff is the metalworker or artificer. The blow Hiram Abiff receives imparts nobility. It is symbolically equivalent to achieving perfection by the Colaphum , or Box of the Ear . 209 The Romans and later the Germans and French conferred knighthood by the Colaphum as a sign of sustaining future hardships. Charles Gounod ’ s La Reine de Saba ( The Queen of Sheba ) a creation in the Opera, on 28 February 1862 builds on an alternative history that directly connects Tubal-Cain with the legend of Hiram Abiff . It is based on a Rosicrucian legend reported by Gerard de Nerval. 210 Three jealous workers disrupt Hiram casting his masterpiece, the monumental bowl called the Molten or Brazen Sea. Tubal-Cain visits"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 74 Hiram and declares that Hiram is his descendant. He initiates Hiram into the Mystery of Fire and the secret of bronze casting. Tubal-Cain gives Hiram his great hammer and a Golden Triangle to wear as a pendant round his neck. Hiram then successfully recasts the brazen sea. Hiram and Balkis, the Queen of Sheba, fall in love. A jealous Solomon instigates the murder of Hiram and the widow Balkis leaves, pregnant with Hiram ’ s son. He is the son of the widow, whose many descendants will complete the building of the Temple. The knowledge of metals and explosive force has always gone hand-in-hand with religion. The Shahnameh or Book of the Legendary Kings of Persia demonstrates this relationship. The Arabian poet Firdowsi wrote the Shahnameh in 1010CE. He describes the early Indo- Iranian kings of the Persians Kiyumars and Jemshid . Chosen by Ahura Mazda, their faces shone brilliantly with the Glory of God called the khvarnah or farr-i izadi . It adorned Ahura Mazda as a large ring or diadem. This Kingly Fortune gave the prince Jemshid an intimate knowledge of God and the ability to carve hard substances without the use of conventional tools. 211 In blacksmithing weapons, he was able to: 212 ... mold iron into such equipment as helmets, chain mail, laminated armour as well as missile-proof vests, to swords and horse- armour. Sadly, Jemshid became a tyrannical ruler. He delighted in the words of falsehood and untruth and the Glory was seen to flee away from him in the shape of a bird . 213 The next Iranian hero to possess the Kingly Fortune was Feridun . Mircea Eliade summarizes the connection between religion and the smithy in the age of metals as follows: 214 There would appear to have existed therefore, at several different cultural levels (which is the mark of great antiquity), a close connection between the art of the smith, the occult sciences (shamanism, magic, healing etc) and the art of song, dance and poetry ... One element nevertheless is constant - that is the sacredness of metal and ... all mining and metallurgical operations ... It is in any case significant that in contrast to pre-agricultural and pre-metallurgical mythologies, where, as a natural prerogative, God is the possessor of the thunderbolt ... in the myths of historic peoples, on the other hand (Egypt, the Near East and the Indo-Europeans), the God of the hurricane receives these weapons - lightning and thunder - from a divine smith."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 75 In Kenite lore, the divine smith Tubal-cain is also Baal Gad , the goat-god who is the eponymous ancestor of the tribe of Gad. He epitomizes the ancient association of smiths with goat and horned gods. A grotto sacred to Baal Gad exists at the source of the Jordan River. 215 It is situated at the base of a high limestone cliff, over which perches the city of Caesarea Philippi . 216 Kenite itself means welding or possessions in addition to belonging to Kain . The Kenites were a tribe of Midianite copper miners who lived amongst the warlike Amalekites, descended from Haggar. 217 On leaving Egypt, the Israelites met the Amalekites in flight to their native lands. The minor tribe of the Midianites was an Asiatic people of the Arab/Palestinian Kush, called Kush Magan. In early times, Magan extended over both sides of the Persian Gulf. 218 Later in 1100BCE, at about the time of Israelite conflicts with the Midianites, Assyrian sources note that Kush Magan was a region on the South side of the Euphrates, not far from Karkemish. The Massorets regarded this Kush Magan as the Babylonian Kish. 219 We digress for a moment to mention the Kushites because of their importance in the Hyksos story. The Meluhha Kushites were a second Kushite or Amalekite group. They were mercenaries and traders in metals and weapons. Their mercenary activities continued long after the Hyksos invasion. The Amarna letters show that Palestinian kinglets hired them. Indeed, later Meluhha and Arab became interchangeable words. 220 The Mlecha in Vedic literary sources are the Meluhha Kushites that derive from India or Pakistan. 221 Eusebius notes that the Ethiopian Kushites came from India. The Musri in Egypt and in early Akkadian literature are also Meluhha Kushites. The Hyksos title hekaw khasout is an almost literal loan from the Akkadian sar kissati , the supreme royal title of king from the hill country . These Meluhha are the same as the maritime Kaphtorim who maintained ports in the Mediterranean. 222 Kaphtorim or Caphtorim is one of the two Biblical tribes of Mizraim that inhabited the region between the Nile River of Egypt and Sile. 223 The other Mizraim tribe is Lehabim. Mizraim led colonies into Egypt to lay the foundation of the Kingdom of Egypt. The Meluhha, Arabs and Hiskija or Hyksos formed an alliance about the time of Bochoris (720-715BCE). Late antique sources report that they returned to rebuild Avaris in alliance with the king of Jerusalem."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 76 Texts speak either about the city of the Shepherds or about Rhinocorura which is El Arish. Complicating the understanding of this event, the site of Avaris is still in doubt despite the discovery of Tell ed Daba . Avaris, a Greek rendition, derives phonetically from Mansion of the Desert Tract . Now back to the Kenites. In surprising contrast to the poor relations between the Israelites and Amalekites, so strong were Israelite relations with the Kenites that the Israelites freely intermarried with them. Moses' father-in-law, Jethro, was a Midianite and priest of Yaho or Iahu . 224 Yaho was the Midianites' god of storms and war who dwelt on Mt Horeb in Sinai. Yaho was also the god of the Chaldeans and the Babylonians. 225 His symbol was a Tau cross worn on the forehead that later became known as the Yahweh Mark . 226 Until quite recently, and perhaps still today, a group of itinerant Bedouin smiths and carpenters in Syria continued the tradition of marking their foreheads with the Tau-cross of Yahweh. 227 At Hebron, Shiloh, Tabor and elsewhere until the time of Judges, men marked with the Tau cross died as Sacrificial Kings. In all Mediterranean countries and in Britain, the Mother Goddess received her sacrifice each year. This took place on a terebinth-tree or kerm-oak. 228 The gory method of death for the Sacrificial King was crucifixion on the lopped oak in the shape of a Tau. Castrated and torn apart, the raw body of the sacrificial male became a Eucharist. The crow or raven was believed to be Athene ’ s oracular bird that housed the soul of the sacrificed king. 229 In Asia Minor, the kadosh or sacred men and women followers of Astarte, released an eagle from the sacred king ’ s funeral pyre to symbolize the ascent of the divine soul to heaven. 230 Orpheus for example, was torn apart by delirious women called the Bassarids : 231 ... a frenzied band Of Thracian women, wearing skins of beasts, From some high ridge of ground caught sight of him. “ Look, ” shouted one of them, tossing her hair That floated in the breeze ... The reckless onslaught swelled; their fury knew No bounds; stark madness reigned.

Procne set out to find Philomela in the same way: 233 It was the time of Bacchus ’ festival, Kept by the Thracian women each three years. Night knows their sacraments; at night the peaks Of Rhodope resound with ringing bronze; At night the queen, arrayed to celebrate The rites, went forth with frenzy ’ s weaponry.

Wild with her troop of women through the woods She rushed, a sight of terror, frenzied by The grief that maddened her, the image of A real Bacchanal ... Moses ’ sister Miriam similarly led a band of women in a ceremonial rite after Pharaoh ’ s troops drowned: 234 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. Josephus tactfully ignored this sacrificial rite in his Antiquities of the Jews because the Romans would have recognized it. 235 The rite was a key sign of the sacred marriage through which the Israelites needed to pass in order to receive the new land of Israel. It is an allegorical initiation. The Israelites had passed the test of water. They were to face the bitter cup of Marah. Moses was Miriam ’ s sacrificial king. He bore all the guilt for past actions and died so the new king, Joshua, could emerge into Canaan as an Israelite Tabula Rasa . One of the familiar symbolic codes for the sacrificial king is Orphruoeis , which means growing on the riverbank . 236 An ear of wheat growing near a stream of water is still the familiar depiction of the initiate in a Fellowcraft Lodge. It refers to the ritual stew of the sacrificial king in a cauldron on a tripod. 237 In Wales, the cauldron contained both the sacrificial king and the Triple Goddess, represented by a white horse."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 78 In response to the inhumanity of a male Eucharist, the first Israelite dynasty of King Saul (1050BCE) outlawed cannibalism. Later, Good King Josiah (640-609BCE) prohibited sacrificial crucifixion. He statutorily converted the act from a magical means of immortality to a felonious punishment involving the extinction of the soul. However, the Jews were not to escape the tarnished background of sacrificial crucifixion for many centuries. In Ptolemaic times, a majority of Alexandrians still believed Jews annually sacrificed a Greek. 238 Picking-up again on the theme of goats, we find the Kenite Goat- god, Tubal-cain, is the archetypal Freemason ’ s goat. Some say he is also a prime candidate for the mysterious Baphomet of the Knights Templar. There are however, two distinct but intertwined traditions associated with the goat that make this unlikely. The Afro-Asiatic tradition of the goat relates to the ancient annual festivals of the sacrificial king. These were usually orgiastic and celebrated in the Lesser Mysteries of Eleusis , English witch ceremonies and the Swedish May-eve play Bukkerwise . 239 In these rituals, the sexually mature he-goat, representing Lust, mates with the Goddess. His sacrifice is a prelude to crowning the new king for the new year. Pallas Athene similarly received her name from Pallas, the maiden she killed in armed combat to win the right to join with the goat-king in ritual marriage. 240 The lustful he-goat occurs in various guises all over Europe. 241 For example, the well known British legend of Lady Godiva carved in the miserere-seat of Coventry Cathedral shows the goddess riding to the ceremony on a goat ’ s back denoting her dominion over him. Often these same stories show the naked Goddess Goda ( the Good ) with long hair, wrapped in a net, riding sideways on a goat, preceded by a hare signifying bold copulation and accompanied by a raven. 242 The Goddess used the hunting or fishing net used in her murderous chase of the sacrificial king. 243 Agamemnon, for example, died with a net over his head in the peculiar manner of the midsummer sacrificial king. Stepping from his bath, he was: 244 ... neither clothed nor unclothed, neither in water nor on dry land, neither in his palace nor outside ... The Libyo-Thracians gave the name of their Goat-goddess, Aegis , to the Aegean Sea. 245 In the Egyptian Delta city of Mend ē s, the goat was originally a well-endowed ram. 246 Herodotus later describes the Mend ē s animal alternately as a goat and a ram. Herodotus tells us that he"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 79 witnessed a surprising incident in Mend ē s: a goat had intercourse with a woman, in full view of everybody . 247 Perhaps Herodotus is really telling us that he attended an initiation ceremony where the initiate was the goat. This may explain the much clich é d Freemason ’ s joke about the goat at an initiation ceremony. In Assyrian, Persian, Dionysian, Pythagorean and Orphist initiation rites, the initiate bathes in the milk of the hidden doctrine. The initiate discovers that Love is the luminous principle of Light, while Light is the radiance of Love or Goodness, Charity and Truth. 248 When the Initiate reaches Hades, the guardians of the dead challenge him to give the pass-phrase: 249 Like a kid, I have fallen into milk. At the end of an initiation, the candidate is one with the god, Dionysus for example. He drinks a cup of goats' milk and honey. New York ’ s Metropolitan Museum of Art displays many of the two handled cups used in the Greek ceremonies. Some of these cups bear golden sun images. In the seventh and final degree of all ancient Mysteries, which is the fourth degree of the Greater Mysteries, adepts partook of the ambrosial beverage Oimellas as a sign they had arrived at the final threshold of all mysteries (see Appendix 7). 250 Zoroaster achieved his immortality through the Mysteries where he drank something that resembled honey, after answering thirty-three questions over a period of three days. Plato drinks of the Oimellas before the last phase of his initiation in the play Initiation of Plato : 251 It is the beverage of the lotus; drink and forget all sentiments of hatred, envy, and intolerance; and put on this robe in sign of devotion to science and virtue. Thou goest to be initiated into the last mysteries. Honey was one important component of the heavenly soma believed to intoxicate the divine beings. The Odyssey gives the Vedic recipe: Circe blended cheese, meal and honey with Pramnian wine to make a kind of brown beer. 252 Herodotus tells us that burial ceremonies of the nobles often included embalming in honey. 253 Its sweetness relates to the human hope of another life that would be eternally happy. The bee was universally revered. In Egypt, the Pharaoh ’ s title of Beekeeper was one of his main designations. The double image of the bee and the reed symbolized the Lord of Upper and Lower Egypt . The Egyptians believed that when the Pharaoh died, his soul joined Osiris in"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 80 the constellation of Orion. There he became one of the bee stars in the Beehive or Prasepe , a group of stars in the constellation of Cancer adjacent to Leo the Lion . The bee has continued through the millennia as a symbol of the soul ’ s survival after death and limitless existence in the harmony of Golden Age of the world. 254 However, the bee also had a very dark side. It remained a primary symbol of the Afro-Asiatic Triple Goddesses such as Demeter, Hecate, Persephone, Aphrodite and the pre-Indo-European aspect of Artemis. 255 Arcadians worshipped both Artemis and Persephone under the name Despoina, which means mistress. Aphrodite, the nymph-goddess of midsummer, would destroy the sacred king by tearing out his sexual organs just as the queen-bee destroys the drone. 256 Her Priestesses displayed a golden honeycomb at her shrine on Mount Eryx. Butes is the most famous beekeeper of antiquity. 257 He was a priest to Athene on Mount Eryx who represented the love-god Phanes, son of the Triple Goddess. The Greeks often depicted Phanes as a loudly buzzing bee called Ericepaius. 258 Incongruous with Aphrodite ’ s beauty, the Greeks also knew her as the Eldest of the Fates, Melaenis or black one , Scotia or dark one , Androphonor or manslayer and Epitymbria, which means of the tombs . 259 Artemis was an orgiastic Nymph like Aphrodite. She was the Maiden of the Silver Bow, which symbolized the new moon. 260 Her male consort received the arrows of death. Besides the bow and bee, her other emblems were the date-palm signifying birth and the stag symbolizing her control of wild things. Artemis ’ bees were the melissae priestesses who daubed their faces with gypsum or white clay in honour of the White Goddess. Artemis chief priest was, as we may imagine, the king bee . 261 A Treasury was a metaphor for a beehive or hive of melissae bee- priestesses, as at Marmaria near Delphi. 262 The veiled Tholos trompe l ’ oeil in Bedroom M of the Villa of Publius Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale, near Pompeii, shows the melissae priestesses as a swarm of bees on a pedestal in the foreground. 263 Nearby is the dour goddess Hecate between two columns. The frescos are now in New York ’ s Metropolitan Museum of Art. We saw earlier in this chapter how maenads were women who practiced wild Mother Goddess orgies in the mountains and woods. As late as the first century CE the Arcadian fertility or witch cult on Mount Lycaeum held drunken maenad orgies after which they chased and killed"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 81 their lover, whom they had clad in a stag ’ s skin. 264 The women wore red war paint boiled from ivy gum and urine, painted on like the stripes of a Spartan Penelope duck. 265 The woof and warp pattern on their limbs suggested a ladder. In Thrace, the Maenads tattooed themselves with spider web designs. One Greek vase shows each maenad has a stag tattooed on her forearm. 266 The maenads ’ ferocious behavior involved strong hallucinogens. 267 This included spruce-beer laced with ivy, sweetened with mead, and the mild panaeolus papilionaceus mushroom. More effective were the Priestesses ’ laurel leaves containing potassium cyanide, hippomanes, which was perhaps the slimy vaginal tissue of a mare in heat, and juice from the mistletoe of the Eastern European Oak, called ixias or loranthus . 268 One of their most powerful hallucinogenic substances was the raw mushroom amanita muscaria . A. muscariae grows on conifers and oaks. It has wide effects inducing berserker rage and feats of extraordinary muscular strength. Following this physical ecstasy comes a period of peace where the person touches the divine and believes that the drug has opened a spiritual, or third eye. 269 In the fifth century BCE, Euripides wrote in The Bacchantes of the frantic ceremonies of the Bacchanals or maenads. He described that from every ivy-wreathed staff sweet rills of honey trickled. To crown their revelries, the Bacchante raised loud his voice and cried: On, on, ye Bacchanals, pride of Tmolus with its rills of gold. Euripides was referring to the even more potent substance that the melissae priestesses chose for their sacrificial king ritual, green or unripe honey. This deadly honey came from plants of the heath such as oleanders, azaleas, rhododendrons and laurel. 270 The dangerous element in green honey is acetylandromedol, which is a grayanotoxin that acts on the central nervous system. Just two tablespoons of this honey induces acute breathing impairment, perilously low heart rate and hypnotics. 271 The green honey from Trebizond, Colchis and the Black Sea region is particularly toxic. In 401BCE, Xenophon ’ s Greek army behaved like lunatics after eating Colchian honey. Seized with vomiting, they collapsed by the thousands. In 67BCE, Mithridates, the king of Pontus, won a battle against Pompey the Great after the Romans ate toxic honey. 272 Pliny called toxic Black Sea honey meli maenomenon . European taverns later used it as miel fou to intensify the intoxicating effect of"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 82 alcoholic beverages. This miel fou was probably the mandrake of the witches and used along with opium and plants containing skin-penetrating atropine such as hemlock, nightshade, hellebore, henbane and belladonna. 273 Henbane is also called Jupiter Beans or apollinaris for its god-like trance-inducing properties. 274 Pliny recorded that the people of Gaul used the sacred plant veravain to prepare an ointment that was used in fortune telling and uttering prophesies.. 275 As with their Mediterranean counterparts, European witches applied a green Oyl to induce states of ecstasy. They applied the Oyl to their foreheads, forearms and underarms. They also used a broomstick handle to apply the Oyl to their vulva and this is probably the source of the flying broomstick myth. In the sixteenth century, the physician Andr é s Laguna investigated the discovery of a jar of witch ’ s Oyl. 276 The jar still had some of the green unguent used by the witches. He experimented with the Oyl by smearing it all over a woman. She promptly fell into a deep coma that lasted for thirty-six hours. Afterwards she described her erotic coma with considerable delight. A Homeric Hymn to Hermes describes how the melissae bee- priestesses of Mount Parnassus consumed the honeycomb of the gods, meli chloron , to attain a state of ecstasy: 277 Divinely maddened, they are inspired to speak the truth But if they are deprived of the divine honeycomb they cannot prophesy. Toxic honey causes vertigo, delirium, nausea, vomiting, blue skin, muscle paralysis and unconsciousness. Severe ventricular tachycardia leads to death. This is an over-contraction of the lower ventricles of the heart. The contractions fall out of phase with the heart ’ s own pacemaker in its sinus node. In the second century CE, Plutarch noted that the melissae priestesses often collapsed and died after frantic disorientation and shrieking. In 19 BCE, Virgil described the effects on the Cumaean Sibyl priestess as she foretold of grim war in Lavinium to the legendary Trojan leader Aeneas at Euboea: 278 The threshold was barely gained when the maiden cried ‘ It is the hour to enquire your fates! The god – behold the god. ’ And as she stood by the doors and spoke, suddenly her countenance and hue changed, and her tresses fell disordered: her bosom panted, her wild heart swelled with fury, and she grew taller to the view, and her voice rang not of mortality, now that the god breathed on her in nigher presence ... in her cavern the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 83 prophetess, intolerant of Phoebus ’ will, raved in limitless frenzy, straining to exorcise the mighty god from her soul: but all the more he curbed her foaming lips to weariness, subdued her fierce heart, and molded her to his constraint ... the madness ceased and her raving lips were hushed. The Indo-Hittite traditions of both the goat and bee are quite different from those of the Afro-Asiatics. The goat, above all the young kid, is the pure symbol of the initiate rather than the sexually craven he- goat. Sexual proclivity could not be further from contemplation in Indo- Hittite, hermetic and Zoroastrian rituals: 279 Sex is a thing of bodies, not of souls. The Pauline Church, notwithstanding its embracing of the Afro- Asiatic sacrificial king ritual, also adopted the goat or kid as a symbol of purity. It is the Agnus Dei and signifies Christ. 280 When it came to masculine deities, Indo-Hittite religion was more straightforward than the Afro-Asiatics. As herders, they did not see the need to sacrifice their masculine gods or clan leaders for the agricultural fertility of the land. While there were female gods, in their overtly male dominated society there was no reason for dominant gods of the male- principal to be subservient to a female. Such male-principle gods were the Sumerian Gilgamesh and Ninurta, Persian Ohrmazd, Akkadian Marduk and Vedic Indra. The typical Indo-Hittite hero kills the Serpent of the Abyss to disenfranchise the matriarch ’ s sacrificial ceremony. He then marries the Serpent ’ s mother or sister, the Triple Goddess, and begets divine children through her that are all manifestations of him. 281 For example, the Persian Ohrmazd marries the Afro-Asiatic Triple Goddess and immediately dispossesses her. 282 He then goes about clothed in her three colors of white, red and dark blue. These colors symbolize creation and re- creation, the eternal combat with evil and bringing forth fecundity. Over time, the matriarchal sacrifice ceremony of the Afro- Asiatics became less violent. Although it was still a sacred marriage and rebirth ceremony, the Goddess did not kill the consort. Instead, she rescued him from death in chaos. The Vedic Usas shows us the strong Indo-Hittite side of the paradigm. She does not give birth but bravely rescues her man. In Mesopotamia, the new paradigm begins tentatively with Inanna who brings Dumuzi back to life semi-annually. However, the actions of the great Inanna are rather incipit. She acts like a fairy godmother instead of her powerful former character of the Female or"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" 84 Triple Goddess in decisive action. The paradigm of male rights later gained more strength with Ishtar who demanded the release of her consort Tammuz from the underworld. Plato described the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice where the male and female swap roles to assert the male paradigm. 283 Orpheus now enters the underworld to seek the return of his bride. The symbol of the ability to descend into Hecate ’ s underworld is a single bronze sandal, which later came to signify the Mother Goddess ’ imprimatur to a contract. Orpheus ’ s bride is the lovely nymph Eurydice, killed by a snake. He wins back her life for the asking but his enthusiasm causes him to look back into Hades, whereupon Eurydice vanishes. The act of looking back is the traditional sign that the initiate lacks the courage so essential in the further pursuit of Wisdom: 284 It is the way thou must take without looking back. Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice tells the beautiful story of Orpheus and Eurydice. 285 The acclaimed aria Che faro senza Euridice of Orfeo ed Euridice became pivotal in the development of modern opera. The metamorphosis of the festival of Lenaea , the Festival of the Wild Women, in Athens demonstrates the attack of the Indo-Hittites on the Triple Goddess. 286 At first, Hera tore apart an adult male. After the Indo-Hittite revision, a male child substituted for the mature male victim. 287 A kid then replaced the male child. Finally, orgiastic moon- priestesses cut into nine pieces and sacrificed a bull representing Dionysus. 288 The respective traditions of the Afro-Asiatics and Indo-Hittites compress and merge in a peculiar fashion at the interface region of Anatolia. A unique group emerged from this compression, the proto- Israelites. They appear to be Semitic Levant Asiatics with Indo-Hittite traditions of God. For example, they abhorred the mystery religions of their Afro- Asiatic clans and often repeated the analogy Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother ’ s milk meaning that the initiate should not bathe in the milk of the hidden Afro-Asiatic doctrine. 289 Notably, they did not have any similar prohibition for cooking the young of other animals in their mother's milk. Even though ingrained, the Israelites and later the Jews deplored the sacred marriage ceremony of the Afro-Asiatics. This is the reason why Judaism regards the sacred son concept of Christianity as a great lie."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" 85 The Priests ruled that a Jewish girl should not become a holy prostitute like Tamar. We return to Tamar later in the chapter. Yet, the Israelites could not escape their heritage of Mother Right entirely. They sacrificed and consumed the scapegoat at the beginning of the agricultural year. 290 This true He-goat or Oak-king equivalent is the Assyrian counterpart of Azazel. The Israelites later consumed the He- goat as a Eucharist when Moses allowed the Israelites to substitute a kid for the paschal lamb in the first law stipulated for Passover. 291 The Israelites were also highly suspicious of honey and bees because of their place in the Afro-Asiatic mysteries of rebirth. In the same way Jews prohibited seething a kid in milk, they deprecated the bee as a filthy creature engendered in the rotting flesh of cattle. This was a reference to Bull Mysteries. Ovid describes the same phenomena of bees emerging from the rotting flesh of a prize bull, slain for sacrifice, in The Doctrines of Pythagoras . 292 Philo Judaeus of Alexandria (20BCE to 50CE) who was the greatest Jewish-Hellenistic philosopher of his time wrote: 293 The Eucharistic bread must be without leavening and without honey. Yet, the Israelites drew a very fine line on bees and honey because of its importance in early Indo-Hittite religion. In Israelite mythology, Samson of Dan killed a lion and when passing later on found a swarm of bees and some honey in the carcass. He scooped out the honey and it gave him the idea for a riddle: 294 Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness . The legend does not say that the lion ’ s body was the womb of the bees. Neither does it imply that the honey was impure since both Samson and his parent consumed it. Ancient doctors who prepared alchemical medicines would immediately recognize that the lion is gold and the sweetness is the sweet, universal medicine of gold that cures all diseases. On another level of meaning, Samson is predicting Dan ’ s universal hermetic religion will be born from the carcass of the Lion of Judah. The bees are Samson ’ s Tribe of Dan and the honey is a golden new age. 295 We can detect an Israelite attempt to reconcile the different Afro-Asiatic and Indo-Hittite mystical interpretations of honey. There is also a deeper esoteric meaning, which we will look at in Chapter 16. The Israelites had great difficulty in maintaining amity or harmony of culture with their fellow Semite tribes because of their"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 86 acquired Indo-Hittite influences, particularly patriarchal monotheism. They had similar problems with Indo-Hittite attitudes to women's status, agricultural castration and rebirth celebrations, sacrificial rituals and ethnic cleansing. Concerning the status of women, after Deuteronomy an Israelite woman generally belonged to either her husband or father. The revised testaments de-emphaised the heroines Miriam, Hannah and Debroah. Miriam was the prophetess, who lead the congregation in prayer. Hannah was a famed warrior leader. Perhaps the most famous woman leader was the judge, Debroah. She was the daughter of Jasher and “ the Mother of Israel ” . Post Deuteronomy, the law permitted her only one husband, even though her husband could have many wives. Women were to be chaste, subservient and sexually ploughed or wrought by their husbands. All of these were Indo-Hittite traits. The woman was a pure chattel in the strict Indo-Hittite sense. Yet, the Israelites also regarded women as ancient respected instruments of rebirth, revered for their biological role. For example, although conviction for adultery required stoning of the adulterous couple, the usual Pharisaic practice was for the woman to plead ignorance of the law whereupon the Court set the couple free. 296 Even today, Israel ’ s Rabbinical Court actively seeks to resolve the objectively disadvantaged position of women in marital separation. This requires it to track-down husbands who have deserted or separated from their wife while continuing to penalize her by harshly refusing to grant a divorce. More importantly, land ownership continued through the youngest of the royal female line. 297 This is ultimogeniture rather than primogeniture. In royal succession, it was not to the son of the King that the Kingdom passed, but to the son of either his youngest daughter or his youngest sister. 298 For this reason, Egyptian Pharaohs would marry their half-sisters in order to propagate the bloodline of the dynasty. Even today, the mother ’ s bloodline incorporates the Jewish heritage. This is a continuation of the Afro-Asiatic matriarchal religion, with the womb as the over-riding regenerative principle. Judaism considers all children of Jewish mothers as Jews and children of Jewish fathers and non-Jewish mothers as Gentiles. This is little different than in Isaac's time (c1750BCE) when an Israelite man who married a woman of another tribe was considered to have transferred to that other tribe and no longer be an Israelite. This is why Isaac returned to his tribe in Harran."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" 87 Isaac ’ s bride is Rebecca the water-carrier. 299 As with all water goddesses, she is an analogy of the Mother Goddess procreative aspect. Isis is likewise. The Roman Catholic Church adopted the principals of female beauty and procreation, incorporating them into the great Lady cathedrals of Europe. The East lancet window is typically high and narrow corresponding to the male principle of Spirit while the rose window of the West is circular and primeval, symbolizing the womb. 300 The North entrance of Chartres Cathedral, beneath the rose window, is the Gate of the Initiates. Melchizedek, Aaron, Anna the Mother of Mary, David and Solomon welcome the Initiates there (c1235). 301 Statues in stone of Melchizedek, Abraham and Isaac, and Moses also welcome visitors through the Central Portal of the North Transept (c1215). The cathedral itself is a chamber or womb of spiritual rebirth, as in the ancient Mysteries. After embracing the Church, the congregation is reborn in the womb of the Church. This occurs in a set program throughout the year. In Rome, on special days in a Holy Year, cleansing of sin is even more efficient. It simply requires passage through the doors of one of Rome's four great churches. Rose logic explains this ancient cleansing process, which we look at in Chapter 17. Most of the congregation would be unable to appreciate the full significance of this cycle since only priests are educated in the Church Mysteries at their Ordination. St Bernard was an enthusiast of the cult of the Virgin embodied in the cathedral. He declared of Chartres: 302 Leave your temporal bodies at the door, only the spirit may enter here ... The Son will answer the prayers of the Mother and the Father will answer the prayers of the Son. Another blending of the Afro-Asiatic rebirth mysteries with Indo- Hittite masculinity occurs in the castration myths. Removing the fertility of the old king disenfranchised him thus allowing the young king to rule. In Egypt Set castrated his brother Osiris , in Sumer, Kumarbi castrated Anu . In Greece, Zeus castrated his father Cronos and Homer writes of Cronos castrating his father Uranus . In Israelite myth Canaan , the son of Ham , castrated his grandfather Noah . The continuation of the Israelites' castration myth as a halfway position between the agricultural sacrifice myths and the Indo-Hittite"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" 88 rescue myths shows their difficulty in completely breaking away from their Semitic agricultural background. The importance of castration is a sign that covenants were cut , not made . 303 The contracting parties severed an animal in two and walked between the pieces that this may happen to me when I break this covenant . 304 This is why circumcision is reserved for a special promise. The separation of the foreskin cuts the covenant that appeases the Mother Goddess ’ demand for the sacred marriage with its ritual castration, death and rebirth. The Goddess demands every man ’ s phallus. 305 Jewish women offered the foreskin as a substitute for their husband ’ s phallus. For example, the substitute sacrifice of circumcision even saved Moses: 306 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the Lord met him [Moses], and sought to kill him. Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, surely a bloody husband art thou to me. So he let him go: then she said, a bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision. It is a custom observed by the British Royal Family who called upon the Rabbi Jacob Snowman, the respected Mohel of the London Jewish community, to perform the religious rite of Brit Milah with Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace. This is also the Covenant of Circumcision . Israelite priests would sprinkle the blood of the covenant on oath- takers to make a promise binding. 307 This blood came from an animal sacrificed on the altar. The Male and Baka tribes of southwestern Ethiopia still slaughter a beast to mark a contract. Blood from the sacrificial animal smears the man who cuts the covenant. In emulation of the combined importance of cutting a promise and involving the male genitals, an Arab promise becomes a serious contract of honour by the oath-taker placing his hand on the bare inner thigh of the person to whom he is making the pledge. Some older Masonic rituals mirrored this form of oath with the initiate placing his hand between the hands of person receiving the obligation. The Bible provides other grand stories of the sacrifice myth. Moses died before Joshua received the fertile land of Israel. King David similarly died before Solomon brought prosperity to the land with the building of the Temple. In the same way, the wounded and impotent Fisher King of the Holy Grail finally passes to his rest before prosperity returns to his wasting land."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 89 In contrast are the Indo-Hittite male-principle gods Gilgamesh and Ninurta, Akkadian Marduk and Vedic Indra. Indra is the most important god of the invaders of the Indus Valley. 308 He is eternally young, strong, stormy and a cunning fighter. He has boundless energy and bestows fertility on women and on fields. One of his names is he with a thousand testicles . Indra neither ages nor is castrated so a younger king can bring fertility to the land. The Sumerian god Marduk was similarly fertile. Yet, he is even more important to us because he graphically highlights the switch from the matriarchal religion of the Afro-Asiatic Mother Goddess religion to the patriarchal religion of the Indo-Hittites. Marduk is the only god with both an old and a new paradigm legend. In the old legend, he is a sacrificial king killed by the dragon Tiamat, while in the new legend Marduk kills her with a sword. King Solomon also possesses the Indo-Hittite character. His fecundity was as legendary as that of his father, King David: 309 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites; Of the nations concerning which the Lord said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love. And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines ... David ’ s death was a precondition to building the Temple. His passing allowed the younger and more fertile hero king, Solomon, to ascend to the throne. In stark contrast, Solomon ’ s own death is an anticlimax. He simply fades away at the conclusion of building the Temple and his grand palace. 310 His son Rehoboam promptly forfeits the glory of Israel. This ultimately has the effect of disenfranchising the proto-Israelites ’ forlorn claim to the Egyptian Delta. We will look further into this claim in the next chapter. The displacement of matriarchal rights in the mysteries of the Great Goddess had the most marked effect on the roles of women. The patriarchal religion of Yahweh decisively rejected the Mother Goddess. As a result, women lost all control over religious celebration. They could not participate; only view the ceremonies from the women ’ s gallery. An often given rationalization for the ousting of women is that females have an unsettling effect on men, who then tend to confuse mystical ecstasy with erotic ecstasy. 311 "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" 90 The three main festivals of Judaism Pesach , Shovous and Sukkos demonstrate the Israelites' difficulty in breaking free of the agricultural cycles. These three festivals have themes of harvest and planting, as well as the Exodus. The Israelites purged Afro-Asiatic sexual content from the rituals. For example, in Jerusalem the celibate Feast of the Tabernacles replaced the orgiastic Day of Willows where Salma celebrated his sacred marriage with the Flower Queen Moon Goddess, as we saw in Chapter 3. The purging of the agricultural festivals left a ragged edge, evidenced by Yahweh's shifting demand for the sacrifice of the first male from the womb. In Exodus: 312 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine. And in Micah: 313 Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? And Judges showed that it was a common practice to sacrifice a royal prince in return for a successful campaign: 314 And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands, Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering. There are awful stories of sacrifices and the words of the scribe show Yahweh lamenting for not having been clearer in his sacrifice requirements: 315 The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond: it is graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars; Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves [Asherah poles] by the green trees upon the high hills. 316 And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart. Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place. 317 These verses provide vivid images of Levite priests carrying out the gruesome task of butchering the flowering youth of Israel. No"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 91 payment could substitute. 318 When they carried out ritual sacrifice, the Levites always turned the victim's head to the north. 319 Yet, the practice of human sacrifice seems to have developed into lamb substitution as favored by the Indo-Hittites. 320 What had originated as a form of ritual sacrifice to renew the agreement with God for ensuring the harvest, was already becoming less barbarous by two thousand BCE: 321 All that openeth the matrix [the first borne] is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male. But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty [handed]. God spared Isaac. This was an important change. God had decided to waive his craving for human flesh and accept a ram in lieu: And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of . 322 Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure [he received Isaac back from death]. 323 By the time of the return from Exile, Zoroastrianism and respect of life heavily influenced the Jewish leaders. They distanced their religion from human sacrifice. This corresponded to Yahweh completing his transformation from a devoted son of the Great Goddess, through a supernal trinity with two attributes of the great Goddess' Anatha of the Lions and Ashima of the Doves , to become the sole ruler of the universe. 324 The post-exilic Jews, in their zeal for the one God, persuaded themselves that they had never accepted the Great Triple Mother Goddess, although their stories of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Jacob and Moses might demonstrate otherwise. 325 After the return from Exile, the practices that prevailed at the time of King Solomon and King Hiram of Tyre, who was a priest of Melkarth where child sacrifice was common, were no longer relevant. The new Jewish approach recognized the absurdity and cruelty of murdering able- bodied men. Annual male sacrifice became redundant with the cut of ritual circumcision of the male phallus. It was sufficient evidence of God ’ s Covenant with man: 326 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" 92 many nations. ... And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God. And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore ... Every man child among you shall be circumcised ... and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations... A final ill-fitting characteristic of the Israelites explained by the Anatolian compression is that their Semitic background was one of accommodation rather than subjugation. While the Indo-Hittites and particularly the Indo-Iranians were at their best wading knee-deep through blood in their campaigns, ethnic cleansing was unusual amongst the Afro- Asiatics and Semites. For example, the Semites of King Sargon I merged with subject populations in Sumer rather than eliminating them. Much later King David chose not to eliminate Semitic populations in and around Jerusalem but to merge with them. In doing this, he countermanded Yahweh's specific order. Yahweh had ruthlessly rattled the sabers of the Israelites as they departed Egypt for Canaan. He directed them to mercilessly murder the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the elite Hurrian Jebusites, and those of nearby cities: Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, ... And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it . 327 But of the cities of these people, which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth: But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee ... 328 The Hivites (Hebrew chry ) are the Horites (Hebrew chwy ) and more generally Achaeans or Hurrians. 329 In other cities on the fringe of the new state, Yahweh directed the Israelites to exact tribute or kill the men and take the women and children as slaves: And when the Lord thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword: But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself. 330 David acted to the contrary and with impunity from Yahweh.

And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord. When David ignored Yahweh ’ s genocidal commands, Yahweh said nothing. Nor did Yahweh say ought when Joshua flagrantly ignored two of the Moses ’ Ten Commandments: “ Thou shalt not kill ” and “ Thou shalt not steal. ” Yet, it was not the Israelites but one of their tribal enemies, the Amorites, who raised Jericho in 1480BCE and continued to harass Thutmose III from their new base there. CJ Jung cannot dismiss the absence of human morality in Yahweh's commands to the Israelites. 333 He says that Yahweh demonstrates a gross deficiency of reason and morality, the two characteristics of a mature human mind. It provides an image of unethical brutal force. What Jung has perhaps overlooked is that these commands are not of the personal god of the Israelites, Yahweh, but of storytellers coming to grips with the Indo-Hittite god of war and trying to paint Yahweh into the extremes. Exodus provides evidence for Yahweh converting from a tribal deity to a nationalist one. In Exodus 3 Yahweh is simply the god of the fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Exodus 6(3) identifies him as the great El Shaddai. The power of the archetype is destabilizing to the paradigm if pushed to extremes. As we have noted, the Indo-Hittites favored oral communication of myths and legends over written records. They developed verbal rituals for transmission of their myths and Israelite emulation of this has resulted in a profusion of Biblical archetypes later set down by Israelite and Jewish authors. This has always been a particular trait of the illusive Rosicrucians. Even today, it is usual in organizations such as the Scottish Rite. We have seen that the unique compression of Indo-Hittite and Afro-Asiatic Semitic cultures produced the very unusual phenomenon of the proto-Israelites.

In his reign, for what cause I know not, a blast of god smote us; and unexpectedly, from the regions of the East, invaders of an obscure race marched in confidence against our land. By main force that easily overpowered the rulers of the land, they then burned our cities ruthlessly, razed to the ground the temples of the gods, and treated all the natives with a cruel hostility, massacring some and leading into slavery the wives and children of others. ’ So said the Egyptian priest Manetho in 330BCE about the Hyksos invasion that took place some one thousand five hundred years before his own time. 334 Savage evidence of severed limbs in grave pits seems to support his claim. 335 Manetho also wrote that the Hyksos escaped to Syria where they built Jerusalem. 336 Hekataios of Abdera similarly wrote in 300BCE that Jewish tradition of the Exodus came from the expulsion of the Hyksos. 337 He maintained the Israelites were the Hyksos. Although the Exodus is an article of faith, modern archeologists are still unable to confirm or deny the Biblical traditions. We still do not know whether the Exodus was mythical or it actually occurred as described in the Bible. If it did occur, it could be the Hyksos expulsion (as Hekataios maintains) or a later event. It is, however, well recognized that the Hyksos conquerors of Egypt were overwhelmingly Semitic speaking Levant Asiatics, because most of the Hyksos names are Semitic. For example, Jacob exists as both a Hyksos Prince ( Mr wsr R r /Y r ķ b hr, Yaqob ) and the Biblical Palestine identity. 338 Yet the Semites of Western Palestine never otherwise displayed the military might and war-technology necessary to mount a sole invasion of Egypt. The main war force of the Hyksos was Indo-Hittite and more particularly Indo-Iranian Hurrian. These were the Haxa from Eastern Iran. We know less about this military force because of their peculiar characteristic of discouraging written records. Because of their aversion to the written word, the Hurrians seemed to leave non-military administration to the Semitic Levant Asiatics, the proto-Israelites.

Tuthmose III similarly"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" 96 Commagene Crucible for the Hyksos Invasion of Egypt"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 97 elevated the Amorites Meri-Re and User Min to key administrative positions. In the same way, Amenhotep III relied on the Semite Yanhamu as Governor of Palestine. At the time of Amenhotep III and Akhenaten, Yanhamu controlled the granaries of Yarimuta and governed the Egyptian domains in Palestine and Gebal. The Amarna letters show the Syrians petitioned Akhenaten asking for his help, suggesting that Yanhamu was familiar with their circumstances. His position no doubt forms part of Joseph ’ s complex archetype. 339 The Canaanite, Ben Matana, was another Semite who rose to prominence, becoming Pharaoh Merenptah ’ s Chief Spokesman. King Nebuchadnezzar similarly made Daniel and his companions Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego governors in Babylon. 340 The practice of appointing Semite administrators continued more than two thousand years later when the Umayyad Muslims invaded Spain and Southern France, 719-720CE. 341 As each Visigoth fortress fell, the Saracens installed Jews as administrators. The Saracens then pursued their conquest to the next town. The Arabs in Tripoli adopted the same practice. While the Hurrian invasion is virtually silent in history, it is not the only example of such a vacuum left by Indo-Hittites. Indo-Hittite Aryans usually devastated culture in the regions they conquered and brought little to replace it. The Huns, for example, had no long-term influence on Europe. German culture eventually arrived through the Western Roman Empire. The advanced chariotry of the invaders graphically demonstrates the Indo-Iranian influence within the Hyksos. This technology came from the Hurrians whose large Trans-Caspian horses easily displaced the small ass drawn chariots of the Egyptians. 342 The Hurrians had been in Syria and East Anatolia for many thousands of years. They originally spoke Urartu , a northeast Caucasian language that was neither Afro-Asiatic nor Indo-Hittite. Later the Hurrians became indistinguishable from Indo-Iranians. They took Aryan Indian gods and Indian royal names. Their charioteering terms were very close to Indian Sanskrit. 343 Even today, the language of Georgia is similar to Hurrian. The Hurrian kingdom of Mitanni was contemporaneous with the Egyptian eighteenth dynasty. The Mitanni was still a potent military force at the end of the Hyksos occupation in 1567BCE."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" 98 Commerce drove this seemingly odd cultural combination of Indo-Iranian Hurrians and Semitic Israelites. As explained in Chapter 5, the Anatolian Commagene was the central interface where Indo-Hittites and Afro-Asiatic Semites were geographically compressed. The races had apparently learned to live together in relative harmony. The region was the first to prosper in the Bronze Age as a centre of metallurgical technology. Copper and lead smelting had taken place in the region for five millennia - at nearby Jarmo, in Iraqi Kurdistan, from 6,750BCE and at Ç atal H û t û k in Anatolia, three hundred and fifty years later. Ç atal H û t û k came to a sudden end in about five thousand six hundred BCE for reasons not yet understood. 344 The burgeoning economic affluence of the region in two thousand BCE meant that it was no longer a zero sum game for the groups. Wealth grew over a long period and, to some degree, peaceful trade provided more prosperity than war. The Indo-Hittites proved able technologists and the Israelites capable artisans and administrators. Even today, business people of Trebizond on the Black Sea coast of Anatolia in the upper Commagene are the most successful entrepreneurs of Turkey. So, what happened to disturb this golden era? In short, twelfth dynasty Egyptians seized their wealth and technology. Thutmose III and Ramses II repeated this after the Hyksos invasion. The Egyptian Pharaoh who initiated the first expropriation was Pharaoh Ses ô stris I, who ruled from 1959BCE to 1914BCE. The twelfth dynasty has been a confusing period but we now know the dates accurately due to reliable European and Chinese dating of the eruption of Thera in 1648BCE. 345 Thera is seventy miles north of Crete and its crater is now the romantic island of Santorini. Using this as a reference point, the Hyksos period of occupation in Egypt lasted from 1801BCE to 1567BCE. 346 Pharaoh Ses ô stris I upset the relatively stable commercial arrangement of the Semitic Levant Asiatics and Indo-Hittites by capturing and transporting to Egypt and Sinai, metals resources, metallurgical technology and even the Semitic metalworking populations. Anatolia was devastated for one hundred and fifty years. It is quite possible that the Kenites of Sinai, the ancestors of David, were an Anatolian group transported to the copper and turquoise mines in the south by this Pharaoh of the twelfth dynasty. The Semites of the area considered their position and resolved to join the Hurrians to recover their interests with violence. The outcome was a commercial-military joint venture, the invasion of Egypt, using the"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" 99 new wonder Indo-Iranian technology of the fast light chariot. Even the nearby Kassites thought it was an opportune time to invade the powerful cities of Sumer in the same way. As compelling as Manetho's description is of the Hyksos arriving from the East by land, later exploits in the Mediterranean suggest that the Hyksos were backed-up from the sea by the Phoenicians of Byblos. 347 The Semite Byblians along with the Cretians had a major port at Pelusium in the Nile Delta where they handled all of Egypt's maritime trade. Due to convenient sea support and trading efficiency, the Hyksos capital remained at Avaris in the East Delta, most probably Tell el Daba'a . The graves at Tell el Daba'a contain many bronze weapons such as axes, daggers and knives made with fine metalwork styles developed in Syro-Palestine after the time of Pharaoh Ses ô stris I. The underlying reason for the Hyksos invasion of Egypt in 1801BCE by the combined forces of the Semitic desert princes and Indo- Hittite Hurrians was to regain their commercial interests in mining and metallurgy. Their hostile invasion of Egypt was highly successful. The production of metals in Anatolia resumed and lasted six hundred years, until the end of the Bronze Age in 1200BCE. The Hyksos takeover of Egypt expanded into the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas. Using their Phoenician maritime connections, the Hyksos colonized both Crete and Greece. Chemical analysis of pottery has confirmed that during this period there was active trade between Egypt, the Levant, Cyprus and Nubia. 348 Linguistics confirms this. The enigmatic Linear A tablet of Knossos seems to be a mixture of Syro- Mesopotamian Hurrian, Semitic and Luwitic. Early analysis of the Etruscan language also suggests a consolidation of Indo-Hittite and Semitic roots. Linear B is an early Mycenaean Greek dialect. Expansion of the Hyksos into the Mediterranean had the most far reaching of effects on civilization, as we know it today: 349 What is today seen as 'Mycenaean' material culture could usefully be seen as 'Hyksos' or at least the 'Hyksos of the non-Cretan Aegean' ... and it was from this society that not only the cultivation of the later Mycenaean palaces but also Greek language and culture - as they survive until today - first took shape. The Hyksos lived mainly in the delta region and this area continued as the focus for Semitic Levant Asiatic aspirations for a thousand years. The Hyksos had limited control over Upper Egypt where they permitted the true Egyptian Pharaohs to reign. Pharaoh Seqenenre ’ s"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 100 sons Kamose and Ahmose ultimately raised an army in Upper Egypt and rebelled against the Hyksos King Apophis in 1570BCE. In 1567BCE, the Egyptians expelled the Hyksos from Egypt and established the prosperous New Kingdom. With the expulsion of the Hyksos, Kamose wrote: 350 Let me understand what this strength of mine is for! (One) prince is in Avaris, another is in Ethiopia, and (here) I sit associated with an Asiatic and a Negro! Each man has his slice of this Egypt, dividing up the land with me... no man can settle down, when despoiled by the taxes of the Asiatics. I will grapple with him that I may rip open his belly! My wish is to save Egypt and to smite the Asiatic! I went north because I was strong (enough) to attack the Asiatics through the command of Ammon, the just of counsels. My valiant army was in front of me like a blast of fire ... When day broke, I was on him as if it was a falcon. When the time of breakfast had come, I attacked him. I broke down his walls, I killed his people, and I made his wife come down to the riverbank. My soldiers were as lions are, with their spoil, having serfs, cattle, milk, fat and honey, dividing up their property, their hearts gay. One of the commanders of Kamose's fleet wrote that after his majesty had killed the Asiatics he sailed southward to destroy the Nubian nomads. 351 The Hyksos-Israelites escaped to Palestine. They remained there from 1567BCE until the Palestine campaign of Tuthmose III in 1480BCE. There was extensive fragmentation in Palestine during this period: 352 Now at that time, the Asiatics had fallen into disagreement, each man fighting against his neighbor. Tuthmose III ’ s 1480BCE campaign capitalized on this disarray to push as far north as Naharin on the Upper Euphrates and to the strategic city of Mari where the Israelite Patriarchs had initially come from. There the fierce Mitanni Empire of the Hurrians halted them. Thutmose III's troops then occupied the strategically important cities of Megiddo and Jerusalem, or Kadesh, in Palestine. A Hurrian- Semitic vassal of Egypt called Abd-Khiba still ruled Jerusalem eighty years later in 1400BCE. 353 The dislodged Hyksos re-established in a Syrian town that they also called Kadesh or Holy City . This was Kadesh on the Orontes River . Today the Orontes River forms part of the border between Lebanon and Syria just above Damascus. In 1291BCE, Ramses II again re-exerted Egyptian sovereignty over Palestine as Ses ô stris I and Thutmose III had done. He pushed up"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" 101 towards the Commagene and won a decisive battle at the Orontes River against the Semitic and Hurrian peoples lead by King Muwatallis. Ramses II turned his victory battle against the Kadesh the Deceitful into a symbolic battle against the allies of Seth the children of Apophis, the impious who haunt the wilderness and the desert . 354 He recorded this battle in grand bas-relief compositions in the Temple of Karnak, the Temple of Luxor, the Ramesseum and the Temple of Abu- Simbel. The scenes show Ramses II bringing order to his land, single- handed, as the personification of Amun. This is the same temple site where his predecessor Thutmose III recorded his plunder of Palestine. The Hyksos period of occupation provides the background to the image of Hyksos invaders as the children of Apophis . The Egyptian concept of order was Maat. It dominated the whole fabric of Egyptian society. 355 In his manifestation as Ptah, the Egyptians called Amun the Lord of Maat . His three-step pedestal is the hieroglyph of Maa t. 356 In opposition to Maat is Isfet , which denotes falsehood, injustice and whatever runs counter to the rightness of the world. 357 The leader of the embodiment of Isfet was the gigantic evil serpent god Apophis . He had no sensory organs, so could neither see nor hear. 358 He could only scream. We will see this serpent emerge repeatedly in mystery religion and literature. In Egyptian folklore, Set killed Osiris and Apophis reigned until the resurrected Osiris chased him away. Osiris represents the rising sun. The Hyksos provocatively identified their monotheistic Indo-Hittite god with the Egyptian Set. The Hyksos King Apepi I went even further. He associated himself with Apophis , the antithesis of order and stability in Egypt . 359 As a result, the Egyptians described the Hyksos invaders as the Children of Apophis. This is the reason Kamose identifies with the resurrection of Osiris attacking the Children of Apophis , the Hyksos, at dawn. The Persian region of Media provides additional evidence that the Indo-Iranian Hyksos invaders were the Children of Apophis . Here the Median kings took the title M â r , meaning snake in Persian. 360 This gave rise to the tyrant dragon dynasty of Media . Herodotus describes the later kings, in particular the last Median ruler Astyages (584-550BCE), as having the royal demonic title Rshti-veg â Azhi Dah â ka . Nowadays Azhdah â , the abbreviation of Azhi Dah â ka , is the only Persian word for snake."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" 102 The triumph of Ramses II at Kadesh on the Orontes River symbolized the victory of Maat or stability and order over chaos. It became the magnificent victory of knowledge over ignorance and good over evil. Kadesh on the Orontes had a similar special significance to Jerusalem. They both had the same Egyptian name of Holy City . Ramses II treated Kadesh with deference. He did not overrun and destroy it. Instead, he granted the Kheta Chief King Hattusilish III a generous peace treaty. The Hurrian King Tushratta of Urkesh had already set the precedent for ultimogeniture transfer of property. He gave his daughter Tatu-hepa as a bride to Pharaoh Amenhotep III. The Hurrian capital of Urkesh has been located in Syria, as Tell Mozan near Nusaybin on the border with Turkey. 361 In the same way, after some aloofness that King Hattusilish III of Kadesh was unable to placate by gifts of tribute, Ramses II finally agreed to marry King Hattusilish III ’ s daughter and thereby accept possession of the land by the principle of ultimogeniture. Archeologists discovered the records of the 1258BCE peace treaty with King Hattusilish III at both Karnak and in the Hittite archives of Arinna. 362 A seal on the treaty depicts the gods of the contracting parties. In the Hittite rendition of the seal, Set is Teshub meaning Storm God . His consort is Hebat meaning Lady of the Skies and Ra is Shamash . We will return to the god Shamash in Chapter 18. The Palestine campaigns waged by the Egyptians to stabilize occupied territories provided a number of opportunities for the capture and release of Israelites. From this we can speculate that an event resembling the Exodus could well have occurred in the 320-year period between 1470BCE and 1150BCE. Conventional Biblical dating at 1466BCE fits well with the earliest estimate. However, alternative dating sources do not confirm it. An Exodus in 1466BCE would have been a prompt release from the capture of Thutmose III rather than a release by Ramses II. 363 However, a release from Thutmose III is unlikely. Jacob, or more correctly Iakeb Aarhu (Jacob on the Ladder) Mer User Ra , was a Hyksos king that reigned immediately before Aa Pehti Set . 364 Many inscriptions on scarabs attest to him. Ramses II dated the commencement of the reign of this king Aa Pehti Set . He erected a stele in 1240BCE to commemorate the four hundredth anniversary of his dynasty commencing with Aa Pehti Set . From this, we can deduce that if Jacob of the Ladder was indeed the primary biblical archetype for Jacob"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" 103 and he was present in Egypt in 1460BCE, then the early 1466BCE date for Exodus is in some doubt. On the other hand, there us another most interesting late date for the Exodus. Amenhotep III ( Amen Hetep III ) held his first Jubilee in 1365BCE. Altogether, he had three Jubilees. The first son of Amenhotep III, crown prince Thutmose V, died before this Jubilee. The Pharaoh therefore selected his celebrated advisor Amen Hetep Son of Hapu to conduct the Sed Festival. This advisor took the place of the First Son, or Great One His Son ( Aa Siph ), in the role of the Sem Priest who deified the Pharaoh. In gratitude, Amenhotep III provided Amen Hetep Son of Hapu with a funerary temple in western Thebes, adjacent to his own. The Egyptians later deified the great advisor Amen Hetep Son of Hapu, as they had Imhotep. A Pharaonic decree inaugurated his mortuary cult. Amen Hetep Son of Hapu was born of unimportant parents in Athribis, the modern Benha, in Egypt ’ s delta. So great did he become that numerous statues in the temples of Amun and Mut at Karnak marked his illustrious career. These statues show him seated as a scribe holding a papyrus. One statue made in his eightieth year records that he hoped to live to one hundred and ten. Although an outstanding and respected architect, Amen Hetep Son of Hapu became renowned for his piety and turned to religious duties. His main designation of scribe of goodly young men described one who recruited for the Egyptian State Mysteries. As many young men came to his temple for ceremonies and he was a Sed Priest, he was almost certainly in charge of these initiation rites. Amen Hetep Son of Hapu is an early archetype for the Freemason ’ s legendary Grand Master, Hiram Abiff . The king Amenhotep III is correspondingly an archetype for Solomon, as is the temple of Al Karnak for the Temple of Solomon. One of Amen Hetep Son of Hapu ’ s key projects was the Ophet or harem for the God Amun, in the Temple of Luxor. 365 Amun traveled from Karnak to Ophet once each year to celebrate his sacred marriage with Mut. A great feast followed in the name of the holy family of Karnak. Far beyond the borders of Egypt, people celebrated the eminence of Amun ’ s perfect son Khonsu, the Advice Giver . Amun ’ s new Ophet or harem adjoined the temple ’ s existing Pylon and first court built by Ramses II. It consisted of a colonnade, second court, columned hall and innermost ceremonial temple. Chapter"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" 104 18 will provide more detail of Amen Hetep Son of Hapu ’ s building activities. The other reason Amen Hetep Son of Hapu undertook the Sem Priest role in the Jubilee was that the second son of Amenhotep III, who was Amenhotep IV, was too young at the time. Amenhotep IV became co-regent and erected his own Jubilee-Coronation Temple at Karnak in 1364BCE. In the Jubilee, Amenhotep IV took the new name Akhenaten ( Akhu En Aten ), meaning well pleasing to the Aten . The Aten ( Pa Aten ) appeared in each of the forty-two shrines of Egypt in the Jubilee Temple to bless the new king. At death, forty-two judges on earth and another forty-two in heaven would assess a Pharaoh ’ s soul according to its actions when in the body. Both the Israelite connection and the forty-two names of God are quite apparent. Akhenaten ceased work on the Temple of Amen Re in Karnak in 1350BCE. He switched to constructing the Temple of Aten in 1353BCE and established Yahweh-style monotheism in Egypt under the High Priest Meri-Re. In doing so, he rebelled against the ceremonies of the Afro- Asiatic sacred marriage practiced by his father Amenhotep III. So close were relations between the Amarna dynasty and the post-Hyksos kings of Assyria that in about 1365BCE Burnaburias II of Babylon even accused the Assyrian king Assuruballit of being vassal to Akhenaten. Akhenaten ’ s new religion was not to last. Egyptians quickly upset this Indo-Hittite innovation, which deplored the sacred marriage of Amun and was associated with the miseries brought to Egypt by the Hyksos. Although Tutankhamun returned Egypt to the traditional religion of Amun, Tutankhamun ’ s death without heir in the ninth year of his reign in about 1318BCE led to a crisis. Tutankhamun ’ s widowed queen arranged for Prince Zannanaz, son of the Asiatic Hittite king Suppiluliuma I, to be her husband and become the next Pharaoh. 366 The Egyptians respected Hittite king Suppiluliuma I for defeating the Mitanni, sacking their capital and creating a buffer state against the Assyrians. After suppressing the Mitanni, Suppiluliuma I installed Tushratta as a pro-Egyptian king to provide a Hittite buffer between Egypt and Assyria. Following Tushratta ’ s murder the Great King of Assyria, Assuruballit I, placed an Assyrian king called Artatama on the throne. Suppiluliuma I then retaliated and set Tushratta's son on the Mitanni throne. This created a Hittite buffer state against Assyria, which lasted until Suppiluliuma ’ s death. Assuruballit I then annexed what was left of the Mitanni kingdom."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" 105 Although Tutankhamen appointed Horemheb a hereditary prince and Lord of the Two Lands, Horemheb publicly disagreed with him and answered back, which enraged Tutankhamen. 367 A key reason may have been Horemheb ’ s discomfort with the Pharaoh ’ s Asiatics mercenaries. 368 With the prospect of another Hittite-Mitanni king in Egypt, General Horemheb seized control in about 1315BCE. Horemheb promptly expunged the whole Hyksos-friendly Amarna dynasty of Akhenaten, Smenkhkare and Tutankhamen from the records of Egypt. He demolished Akhenaten ’ s sun Temple of the Aten in Karnak and used its forty thousand blocks to build the Ninth Pylon of Karnak. In 320CE, Eusebius recorded the Greek historian Euhemerus ’ s visit to Manetho in Egypt in 300BCE. We only have St Jerome ’ s commentary on Eusebius ’ World Chronicle but it seems that Eusebius may have described how Akhenaten ’ s daughter, Scota, escaped to Tara in Ireland ’ s County Meath, with the Asiatic prince called Gaythelos. 369 The Irish and Scottish people adopted the legend as an integral part of their traditional history. Scota may be Akhenaten and Nefertiti ’ s second daughter of six, the princess Meritaten. 370 She was Tutankhamen ’ s stepsister, stepmother and should have become his wife. Instead, Tutankhamen married her younger sister, Ankhesenpaaten. The Scottish Scota legend says the Egyptian force buried Meritaten at Glenscota in County Kerry. 371 General Horemheb was Tutankhamen ’ s commander of the Egyptian army. As Horemheb had no sons, he put another favorite general on the throne as co-regent. This was General Ramses, son of the court official Seti. General Ramses was to name his son Seti after his own father. This son, Seti, inaugurated the nineteenth dynasty as Pharaoh Seti I. It is also notable as the first occasion since Hyksos domination that a Pharaoh took the name of a Canaanite god. It demonstrates that while General Horemheb violently opposed the military Hyksos of the Hittites and Mitanni, the Semitic Levant Asiatic contingent of the Hyksos successfully integrated into Egypt as high officers of state. These Semitic Hyksos married into Egyptian royalty from the time of the famous founder Queen of the eighteenth dynasty, Ahmose-Nefertari. Pharaohs' queens held the title of God's Wife of Amen .

Eventually the female Semitic"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" 106 Levant Asiatic bloodline successfully gave rise to the nineteenth dynasty of Seti I. A surprising outcome of this lineage of kings and queens is that these facts perhaps reveal the identity of Moses. 372 Furthermore, this theory supports an Exodus at the time claimed by Manetho and Josephus. The Sem Priest at the time of Ramses II (Ra Meses II) was Kha Em Uset, the fourth Crown Prince of Ramses II. He was a great restorer of monuments and erected the four hundred year stele mentioned previously, celebrating the king's first Jubilee in his thirtieth year (about 1249BCE). Kha Em Uset continued to celebrate the Jubilees until he died in 1230BCE. At his second Jubilee, Kha Em Uset built a special Jubilee temple at Memphis. This marked his position as High Priest of Ptah and keeper of the Apis Bull. This funerary temple for the Apis Bull, known as the Serapeum, was at Sakkara, just West of Memphis. With new economy, the series of tombs for the Bulls at the Serapeum ended the practice of separate tombs and Temples for each bull. Kha Em Uset ’ s name was visible to the notaries on the Serapeum ’ s Museum Notice , right down to third century CE when the practice of burying bulls ceased. From this a demotic romance of The Third Intermediate Period/Late Period, called the Setne Cycle, developed with Kha Em Uset as its subject. It tells of the tomb work carried out by Setne Khamwas and the tales of wonder of his magical son Si-Osiris, who defeated the Nubian magicians before his grandfather Ramses II, only to vanish from the court. His father grieved until another son called User Mont Hor was born. Crown Prince Kha Em Uset ’ s first son was also Ra Meses. Although he grew to an age where he could accept the office of High Priest of Ptah from his father, he did not do so for reasons we will examine. These offices, along with others due to him, passed to the second son called Hori. Hori then became the important Vizier of the North and later of Thebes. However, details of Kha Em Uset ’ s first son, Ra Meses, still exist. These include his estate, the name of his scribe (Hui) and some correspondence conveyed by the captain of his barge. An unnamed person who seems to be Ra Meses tried to obtain land in Per Ramesses, the new capital in the delta, by altering Temple records. The Chief Accountant of the Temple of Ptah in Memphis, Mose, inscribed the story in his tomb. 373 The cult of this great man regularly made offerings to him at the tomb. There they read of the one hundred"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" 107 year legal challenge in which Mose prevailed triumphant. The story also made its way into another demotic tale of the Third Intermediate Period where Mose described his father ’ s life, an oblique view of his own life and the expulsion of the followers of Set . Mose described the challenge of a powerful royal figure who tried to steal his mother ’ s inheritance. In the process, this person altered the records of the Temple. He fled in disgrace after the discovery. It is quite possible that the Chief Accountant ’ s one hundred year battle for the land of his mother was actually Egypt ’ s recovery of its Nile delta territories from the Semites who were growing ever more numerous. These Semitic Levant Asiatics in the delta were seeking land at a time when the borders of Egypt were already under considerable pressure from both Palestine and Libya. An attempt by Ra Meses to achieve the Semite goal by deception may have been the last straw. Notwithstanding what might have been Ra Meses ’ reason for leaving Egypt unexpectedly, he appears to have returned to Egypt from Syria shortly after the death of Pharaoh Merenptah ( Mer En Ptah ) in about 1203BCE, when Merenptah ’ s half-brother Amenmesse usurped the throne of Egypt. Three years later, in 1200BCE, Seti II deposed this usurper and gained the throne as the son and rightful heir of Merenptah. The deposing of Amenmesse occurred at the same time that the followers of Set called on the successors of the Hyksos in Jerusalem for help. This has led some scholars to suggest that Amenmesse is Messui or Moses. However, there is a more compelling argument. On his return from Syria, Ra Meses becomes Ra Meses Em Per Ra . The title meant he was a Prince of the Royal Dynasty the House of Ra and therefore one of the seventy grandchildren of Ramses II. He seems to have been active in deposing Amenmesse. Ra Meses, our candidate for Moses, became Kingmaker ( Arsu ) for the rest of the dynasty. Ra Meses also became Chancellor with the name Bai/Bay, or Si Osire, which is the same as name as the son of Osiris or Osarsiph who led the followers of Set to Avaris. 374 In 1188BCE, Ra Meses placed Queen Ta Usert on the throne and prepared a tomb for her although she subsequently abandoned it in preference for internment with Pharaoh Sethnakht. Sethnakht became Pharaoh in about 1186BCE. He promptly expelled Ra Meses and all his followers. 375 As noted with the story of Mose, Sethnakht ’ s twentieth dynasty always made a great point of Ra"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 108 Meses ’ expulsion from Avaris, calling his people the followers of Set . This expulsion was the same event that Manetho and Josephus understood as the Exodus. The fleeing Israelites took with them a belief in the importance of the rising sun as the rising soul of the newborn king and also the prayers of the sun from the Temple of the Aten at Karnak. 376 In 500CE, Stephen of Byzantine wrote of an Edomite-sect in Petra. They worshiped the honoured the rays of sunlight at dawn by focussing the rays onto a ritual meal with a solid bronze dish. 377 Even today, an orthodox Jew in his tallith and phylactery will orient his prayers to the direction of the rising sun rather than to Jerusalem. Sethnakht then provided co-regency for his son Ramses III to continue the new dynasty. In 1177BCE Ramses III, son of Sethnakht, vigorously defended his northeast border against the Keftiu or Sea Peoples . 378 These were refugee families from the collapse of Suppiluliuma II ’ s Hittite empire. At the time of Ramses III ’ s conquest the Israelites do not appear to have reached Palestine although the famous Israel Stela of Merenptah, dealing with a similar victory over a Libyan refugee incursion, had already mentioned Israel as being in Canaan. The argument can be summed-up as follows. The Semitic Levant Asiatics, who were later to become the Israelites, entered Egypt as Hyksos. They integrated into the administration of Egypt as Viziers and Governors. Ahmose did not expel them, in contrast to the militaristic Hurrians. Over the following centuries, the Semite female line intermarried with the eighteenth dynasty and many Semites rose to prominence. 379 These included the Amorite Meri-Re, Tuthmose III ’ s armor-bearer. His brother was the Priest User Min. Another was Arper- el, a Grand Vizier in Akhenaten ’ s government who was both an Israelite priest and a Memphis high priest of Aten. 380 As mentioned earlier in the chapter, Yanhamu was a prominent Semite mentioned in the Amarna letters. To continue, at the death of Tutankhamun without heir, General Horemheb preferred Egypt ’ s throne to pass to the Levant Asiatics in Egypt rather than to the Hittites. This created the nineteenth dynasty of Seti I who was the first post-Hyksos king to use the name of a Canaanite god. His son, Ramses II, commemorated the four hundredth anniversary of the nineteenth dynasty, commencing with the Hyksos Pharaoh Aa Pehti Set , in a stele of 1240BCE."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 109 The Biblical Moses was Ra Meses, a grandson of Ramses II. After political intrigue, dealings with the Jerusalem Asiatics and a land grab in the Delta, the new twentieth dynasty Pharaoh Sethnakht expelled Moses and the followers of Set from Egypt. Sethnakht ’ s son, Ramses III, continued his father ’ s vigilance against all peoples seeking to occupy the Delta. Placing Exodus in the reign of Sethnakht, about 1186BCE to 1184BCE, followed by 40 years in the wilderness as an itinerant tribe in fear of Ramses III, coincides precisely with the violent third eruption of the Icelandic volcano Hekla III in 1159BCE. While the forty years in the wilderness and the Exodus are most likely a metaphor of Afro-Asiatic religious rebirth, it is interesting to follow the literal interpretation for a moment. Hekla III erupted in 1628BCE and again in 1159BCE, during the rule of Ramses III, causing major global events and climate changes. 381 The 1159BCE eruption virtually depopulated northwest Britain causing many extraordinary phenomena recorded by the Chinese. These included double suns, pale suns, dry mists and frosts in summer. All around the world there was a momentous as the upheaval in civilizations. The Myceneans of Greece collapsed, as did the Hittite of Anatolia, the Egyptian New Kingdom, the civilization of late Bronze Age Israel and the Shang Dynasty of China collapsed. The effects would have included extreme, unseasonable changes in Egypt and Palestine. The shallow sand bar of the Dead Sea and Bitter Lakes, which then formed part of the Gulf of Suez, was dangerous when the North East trade winds abated allowing water to surge in from Yemen. Unexpected changes in the tide across the sandbar between the Great and Bitter Lakes could well have been the inspiration for a story of the parting and closing of the Red Sea. Another theory gaining support is that these tides allowed the Israelites to ford the Gulf of Aqaba, enroute to Saudi Arabia ‘ s Jabal al Lawz, the mountain of Moses and real Mt Sinai. Explorers Bob Cornuke and Larry Williams showed that a crossing could have been made from the in the shallows of the Strait of Tiran, where the Gulf enters the Red Sea. 382 The intrepid biblical explorer, Ron Wyatt, is certain that the Israelites crossed half way along the Gulf of Aqaba, on a sandbar some 300 meters underwater. He says he discovered a pillar on the Saudi Arabian shore carved with ancient Hebrew text, which stated that Solomon set up the pillar to mark the location of the transit and Pharaoh ’ s"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 110 defeat. He says he showed the pillar to officials of the Saudi Arabian Government, who removed it. The Exodus and effects of Hekla III would have been closely associated in the minds of the scribes who seem to have recorded some elements the story of Exodus in about 966BCE. However, Exodus 15: 16-17 may be the only part of the story written in early times as it is has close parallels in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Conversely, Exodus 13:28 to 15:22 appear neither in the Dead Sea Scrolls nor in Greek Corpus LXX Septuagint of about the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus in 250BCE. All this confusion is because the Jewish alphabet did not develop until after 1000 BCE, no Jewish history was committed to writing before the ninth century BCE and very little history existed before Mishnaic Hebrew or Assyrian-Hebrew in 725 BCE. 383 Reliable Jewish history only began sometime in the period between 650BCE, when the Babylonians overthrew the Assyrians, and 539BCE when the Persians conquerored the Babylonian empire and Cyrus allowed the Jews to return to Israel. During this hundred years of upheaval, the Jewish priests incorporated many Babylonina myths into the texts. Ezekiel rewrote Exodus about the time Josiah (640 to 609BCE) sacked the Edomite shrine of Bethel because the Edomites had sided with the Babylonians against Judah. Ezekiel excised the Calebite Book of Jasher because it showed Edom as the original religion, still practiced on high places instead of in Jerusalem ’ s Temple. 384 The phenomena of the desert sojourn in Exodus 14:19-21 are very much under suspicion as late insertions because these contrived verses encode the seventy-two-letter name of God: WHW YLY SYT OLM MHSh LLH AKH KHTh HZY ALK LAW HHO YZL MBH HRY HQM LAW KLY LWW PhHL NLK YYY MLH ChHW NThH HAA YRTh ShAH RYY AWM LKB WShR YChW LHCh KWQ MND ANY HOS RHO YYZ HHH MYK WWL YLH SAL ORY OShL MYH WHW DNY HChSh OMM NNA NYTh MBH PhWY NMM YYL HRCh MTzR WMB YHH ONW MChY DMB MNQ AYO ChBW RAH YBM HYY MWM Both the Zohar and Rashi ’ s twelfth century CE Bachir discuss this encoding of the name.

Each of these three verses in Hebrew contains exactly seventy- two letters. The seventy-two triplets of the great Name derive from one letter taken from each verse. The Bachir outlines the process of constructing the Name. The letters of the first verse apply in direct order, those of the second in reverse order, and those of the third verse in direct order. The first triplet is W (Vav) H (He) W (Vav). Another mass movement of Semitic Levant Asiatics occurred in 752BCE. Josephus explains that Lysimachos sets his estimate of the Israelites leaving Egypt at 752BCE in the time of Bokchoris ... Apion within the time of the seventh Olympiad, to be more precise in its first year . 385 This was the period when the Nubian Kushites from Napata brought the whole of Egypt under their control following its internal political collapse. At this time, there was a refugee exodus from the Delta. The defeat of the Semitic Levant Asiatic aspirations caused by the twentieth dynasty and the expulsion of Ra Meses (Moses) was a temporary setback. However, it was not necessarily decisive because the Pharaonic dynasties of Egypt had already integrated the Semitic Levant Asiatic bloodline. In stark contrast, the division of the kingdom about 1075BCE and its consequent loss by the twenty-first dynasty in 945BCE was fatal to Semitic Levant Asiatic aspirations. The enormity of the Semites ’ loss affected the stability of their homeland until 1948CE when the freedom fighters under David Ben Gurion gained control of modern Israel. Nevertheless, the Jewish presence in the Delta remained strong until at least 250CE when Hippolytus reported the presence of Essenes in Alexandria."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" 112 The next chapter provides the necessary background to the name of God.

However, Amun was not to be deceived. The post-Hyksos Egyptian deity Amun had learned invincibility from the god of the Indo- Hittites. His real name remained completely hidden because the Priests never defined it in the first place: 386 Your first form by which you have begun was Amun - namely, he who hides his name from the gods ... Amun is one! (He) who hides himself from the gods ... whose nature is unknown ... His nature is not recorded (or displayed) in sacred scriptures; he cannot be described and taught. He is too mysterious for his power to be laid bare; he is too great even to be asked about, too immense to be perceived. One would fall dead suddenly, in fear, if one were to pronounce the god's mysterious name, unknown to everyone. Not even a god can call him by his name, the vital one, because his name is secret. Three are all the gods, Amun, Ra and Ptah. Aside form these there is none. He who hides his name behind the word \"Amun\" is Ra at his head, Ptah at his body. His cities are eternal: Thebes, Heliopolis and Memphis - forever. The very best way of hiding Amun's true name was never to define it in the first place. The Israelite ’ s Yahweh could not overcome him; Yahweh could only join him in absolute ineffability. The more Yahweh developed, the more he became a transcendent god like Amun rather than a personal god. In recognition of his affinity and equality with Amun, Yahweh became increasingly unknowable. Eventually, his priests knew him by only the most fundamental of all existential statements: Ehiyeh Asher Ehiyeh ( HYHA RShA HYHA ), which means I am that I am . 387 Along with Yahweh's change in character, his secret names of Q're and Iahu became only partial labels. Yahweh subsumed or incorporated in himself the other gods that he defeated, and went on to embody the totality of Israelite' history in his name. He became the terebinth-god or oak-god Bel , Cronos the barley- god, Tammuz the harvest-god, Jupiter and Marduk . 388 In Jerusalem, Yahweh was the scarlet oak-god El . At Mount Tabor, he became Dionysus , the Daanan white-bull god. 389 He was Baal-Zephon , Baal- Zubul , Lord of the North or Lord of the Mansions , and Atabyrius . 390 As"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" 114 Atabyrius, he was the god brought out of Egypt by the Israelites and worshipped as a golden calf. He was the son of the Goddess Io , Hathor and Isis . 391 In a magical Egyptian-Jewish papyri Yahweh is Zeus, Thunderer, King Adonai, and Lord Iaooue. 392 Yahweh was Nabu the Babylonian god of Wisdom represented by the almond tree stem of the seven-branched Menorah. 393 Each branch represented a planetary power that symbolized one of the interests of the Mother Goddess: Sun (Helios) for illumination; the Moon (Selene) for enchantment; Mars (Ares) for growth; Mercury (Hermes or Apollo) for wisdom; Jupiter (Zeus) for law; Venus (Aphrodite) for love and Saturn (Cronus) for peace. 394 The final conception of Yahweh as Ineffable derives from the Indo-Hittite cosmic sky-philosophy. Yahweh, like Amun, is perfect. His unknowable names are so all encompassing that they are unspeakable. He contains everything including contradiction. Contradiction is at the very core of secret knowledge. The paradox of a bad, poor or even evil side to God is not a fault in God but rather our lack of clear or perfect comprehension. The knowledge God has of himself is unambiguous. All ancient polytheistic religions eventually developed the same understanding that every junior god is simply a different manifestation of the great hidden God. The Semitic tribes knew the great God as the Moon God. In Egypt he was called Atum or Amun and in Persia, Ahura Mazda. 395 The Moon God Sin was the Semitic form of the Sumerian Enzu meaning Lord of Wisdom . The Luna cycle gave Enzu a special position based on order and immortality. He was seen as the father of both the Sun Shamash and Inanna , the Queen of Heaven . Enzu was the central astral deity, father of the great gods and Lord of Heaven found in every Semitic land . 396 This triangular relationship between Sin , Shamash and Inanna can be rotated one hundred and twenty degrees clockwise to produce a new internally consistent relationship based on the Indo-Hittite primacy of the Sun god Shamash . If Yahweh, as the furnace or sun god Q're , substitutes for Shamash, the Moon God Sin and Queen of Heaven Inanna are the two subordinate deities to Yahweh. The Israelites indeed recognized these two subordinate deities as Yahweh's two wives Ashima Baetyl and Anatha Baetyl. 397 They represented the Moon and Wisdom respectively. 398 The sex change of Sin to Ashima is a fundamental subject of esoteric religion. Anatha was equivalent to Ishtar , the Indo-Hittite Lion or Cat goddess of love and war."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 115 She was the Queen of Heaven and Goddess of Plenty . 399 Together these three represent the physical sun, the moon that lights the intellectual darkness with wisdom and the light of love. Strabo, who lived from 63BCE to 19CE, describes a similar Persian triad of Mithras, Selen é and Aphrodite. The triad exists in the one true god Zeus: Now the Persians do not erect statues or altars, but offer sacrifice on a high place, regarding the heavens as Zeus; and they also worship Helius [the sun], whom they call Mithras, and Selen é [the Moon] and Aphrodite, and fire and earth and winds and water. The triangular group, representing a single deity, is also analogous to the ancient Vedic One True Existence , Paramathika or Brahm . 400 This single principle contains the three characteristics of creativity being Power, Wisdom and Love. Love, as Aleph , pronounced Ah , is the emanation of the ubiquitous heart, the first emanation or expression. Aleph , written A ’ a , is the Hurrian rendition of the god Enki and Ea. 401 The One True Existence is the Word or Divine Thought that is BAL in each of Arabic, Hebrew, Phoenician and Greek. 402 The sacred Name of BAL has the cabbalistic cipher of 33 ( B=two, A=one, L=30 ), as does the sacred word AUM . 403 Chapter 17 will investigate Aleph and the AA expression. In the Hebrew alphabet Aleph is the head of the three Mother consonants, Beth of the seven Double consonants and Lamed of the twelve common consonants. With sacred 3:7:12 proportions adding to twenty two, the divine Name covers the whole of the Alphabet and thus is inclusive of the Logos or Word of God . Thus, the twenty-two consonant alphabet is itself a name of God and each consonant is a visible part of the radiance of God. The Logos or radiance of God is the dawn rays of sunlight focused through a rose window, rock crystal lens, a water filled sphere or concave mirror onto the altar. 404 In this way, at Petra, the ancient Israelites focused the suns rays to light the sacrificial fire on the altar. 405 Nowadays in Olympia, every four years, a woman dressed as a high priestess lights the Olympic flame at the Temple of Hera altar. The priestess calls first on the Gods of Olympus to witness her act, offers a prayer and hymn to Apollo and uses a parabolic mirror to focus the sun's rays and ignite the flame. She then presents the first flames to the skies.

However, there are seven sacred vowels all together. The birth vowel AA , written as a long O ( Õ ), stands for Omega or the birth of birth . 407 The death vowel II is written Y or as the Royal consonant J . The seven vowels, arranged as Õ AOUEIY , represent the Divine wisdom or invisible radiance of the Word of God. 408 These vowels are the female Spirit of God . Even before the creation of the world, she moved over the surface of the water. The combined effect of the birth of birth vowel and the vowel of Royalty means the female Spirit of God that moved over the deep is a Virgin with Child . 409 Plutarch said of the Mithriac mysteries: God is a male and female intelligence, being both life and light he brought forth another intelligence, the creator of the world . 410 Orpheus, the mythical Thracian musician and poet who founded the ancient mysteries, sang of the hermaphrodite god Jove . While Jove is a male, Jove is also a virgin female. The Brahmins in the Sama Veda echo this with the will to create existed with the Deity as his bride . It was only after the return from the Exile in Babylon that Yahweh ultimately gave up his triple character. Even then, it continued into Christianity as esoteric wisdom of the vowels of his name. Christianity characterizes Ashima , who can be either male or female, as Jesus the Son. Anatha became both the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene. St Bernard referred to the Virgin Mary by Anatha 's title of Queen of Heaven and held that the great Lady Cathedrals of Europe embodied Mary Magdalene. The Oath that the Knights Templar swore to St Bernard required the Obedience of Bethany - the castle of Mary and Martha (the Magdalene). 411 According to the preceptor Radulphus de Gisisco, the Knights Templar sought and received the forgiveness accorded to Mary Magdalene: Et Dieu qui pardona la Maria Magdalene ses p é chiez, les vos pardoient meaning the forgiveness of God who pardoned the sin of Mary Magdalene . 412 Garcerandus de Teus gave the form of this unorthodox absolution as I pray God that He may pardon our sins, as He pardoned St Mary Magdalene and the thief on the cross . The concept of thief on the cross is also quite controversial because Gnostics regard this person, the thief, as Jesus. 413 The Johannites believe Jesus was a thief because he stole the"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" 117 Ineffiable Name of God from the holy of Holies, as described in the Toledot Yeshu. The original word for thief in Greek is lestai , which Josephus uses for zealot-bandits. 414 The rose logic of embracing resolves the Magdalene's cardinal sin and her apparent prominence over the Virgin Mary. It equates the two. Chapter 17 examines the rose logic of embracing further. Let us return to Yahweh. The reason Yahweh dropped his triple character during the Exile was that in Babylon the image of Yahweh became highly influenced by Zoroastrianism. There, like Ahura Mazda, Yahweh became a holy being of Light. The priestly blessing of Aaron spelled his name: 415 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them, The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: The Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them. The first three verses of Priestly Blessing when written in Hebrew consist of carefully prepared sequences with three, five and seven words respectively. The first three verses also have fifteen, twenty and twenty- five letters respectively: KRMShYW HWHY KKRBY KNChYW KYLA WYNP HWHY RAY MWLSh KL MShYW KYLA WYNP HWHY AShY MKRBA YNAW LARShY YNB-LO YMSh-Th WMShW The last verse explains that this formula spells out Yahweh's new code name, the Holy Tetragrammaton, YHWH, which the Jews call the Shem Hamphoresh . 416 Chapter 3 showed that the consonants are Life, Sovereignty and the Glory or Brightness ( JH ), Peace ( W ) and Light ( H ). The dimensions are Life on the horizontal and Wisdom on the vertical. The two theoretical dimensions, Light and Life, have a deep Biblical heritage. The Bible describes Moses' Midianite brothers-in-law as Nahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. 417 These names symbolize rising above, descending below, before and behind. Together they make the sign of the cross, which is the same sign the priests of Aaron make"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 118 with their hand while giving their blessing. It is the start of the secrets of blessing, the great Merkabah . In an ancient method of sacrificial killing, the priests placed the sacrificial king in a Birchwood box and suspended it between two tall poles ( Asherah poles ). 418 Allowed three loaves, one for each aspect of the deity or the Triple Goddess, he remained suspended at God ’ s mercy , between heaven and earth, until he decayed and his remains blew away. An esteemed Jewish scholar and Masonic Librarian once congratulated me on my work. Old and frail, he has now passed-on. But he generously gave me four great gifts that have since grown in value. Second only to his friendship, was his gift of the major Arcanum of the Merkabah. Showing me a piece of paper, which he had already cut into the form of a cross, he silently formed a hollow, perfect cube. This is the cubic throne, which is the vehicle in which one ascends toward the Light . It is the cube or unfolded sacrificial cross of the sacred marriage. A Druze candidate wears a blood sprinkled cube at his initiation ceremony, symbolizing that the cube unfolded is the bloody instrument of perfection. Similarly, a Masonic Knights Templar receives a cube. 419 The rose on the cross of the Rose Croix is the emblem of the sacrificial king. In alchemy, the new king emerges from the stone. The symbol is one of sacrifice and equally applies to both the divine triad and the Triple Goddess. Often priests symbolized the divine triad or the Triple Goddess by a cube sculpted into a triple-head. For example, a triple headed ram represents the perfection of the Egyptian God Amun. After the death of the old king, the officials led the new king to his coronation with a silk ribbon around his neck to remind the candidate of his brief reign with divine power. This is similar to the Scottish Rite ’ s 33 º degree ceremony. 420 In ancient times, the silk ribbon was a silken strangling cord, which symbolized the sacred obligation to kill the king after a nominated period, or when his vitality waned, so that the divine power may find a more youthful and vigorous incarnation. 421 The traditional period of the king ’ s rule was forty years. If he exceeded this time by a single day, his subjects and attendants killed him, saying His reasoning is already dimmed, and his insight confused . Pythagorean numbers six and seven represent Light and Life , respectively. The six by seven matrix has forty-two boxes. These correspond to Yahweh's forty-two names, one for each combination of Light and Life . 422 Perhaps this is how Douglas Adams, author of The"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 119 Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy , found forty-two was the answer to life, the universe and everything. A second horizontal crossbar represents the third dimension of Peace. However, it has a bloody heritage because the second crossbar is the arms of the fastened king. 423 Another way of showing this second crossbar is in three dimensions as a St Andrew ’ s cross or Chi-Rho cross of Emperor Constantine. The Merkabah is also the meaning of the pillars at the entrance to King Solomon's Temple. The spirally fluted pillar of Truth called Boaz, Bolaz or Abolloneus ascends and is the green pillar of growth. 424 It represents the strength of man ’ s Spirit . The name Boaz derives from the metathesis (letter jumbling) of the Hebrew Zahab ( ZHB ) standing for gold, and for Mercy and Judgment. 425 It means, as we shall see below, that there can be no righteous Judgment without Mercy. 426 Some associate Boaz with antimony instead of gold, because Boaz was a Bethlehem landlord and the saturine old man Antimon, is the gatekeep of the great mystery. However, it is the vertically fluted pillar called Jachin that represents the daughter of Mesahab ( MI-ZHB ), antimony, who is the companion of Zahab (gold). 427 Jachin is the sere pillar of Justice severity, sorrow and decay that descends. These two bronze pillars each measured between thirty-four and thirty-five feet and had a diameter of six feet at the base. The foundry cast the hollow pillars with a uniform wall thickness of about three inches. A sort of chain ornamentation covered the lower part of the capitals, with representations of pomegranates in two rows of two hundred. At the very top was a lily-work motive, an imitation of the Egyptian lotus blossom. Queen Hatshepsut built a red quartzite sanctuary in the Temple of Amun in Karnak about 1470BCE. 428 She erected two magnificent obelisks amid Pylons III to VI. These formed the entry to the chamber for the sacred barque and were the first cult focus in the temple. Two obelisks, together with four flagpoles, formed a classical temple front. Tuthmose III dismantled Queen Hatshepsut ’ s red quartzite sanctuary and the blocks subsequently became foundations for expansion of the temple of Karnak. Archeologists recovered three hundred of the blocks, which now form the famous Chapelle Rouge . One red quartzite relief shows Queen Hatshepsut dedicating two great pillars to the god Amun. The inscription says the Egyptians covered the pillars with white gold and so high that they pierced the skies . 429 "},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 120 Canaanite Ugaritic texts from the fourteenth century BCE call the two pillars cutter-twins . They are the Asherah poles called Shacharu and Shalim, meaning integration and completion respectively. 430 These two pillars support the deathly net of Asherah, the most ancient of all mother goddesses. In De dea Syria , Lucian described the two large phalli at the door of Astarte ’ s temple in Heirapolis. 431 These pillars were thirty fathoms high and hollow. Each year, a sacred king climbed inside and worked his way to the summit as a human sperm. There he conversed with the Gods to ensure fertility of the land. This means the priests killed him and ejaculated his blood through the phallus. This pillar later became the Rosicrucian tower of Mysteries and mason ’ s lodge room. The Degree of Heredom of Kilwinning , a prelude to Knighthood of the Rosy Cross , led to the building of many humble follies euphemistically called hunting towers. An excellent example of the tower is Lord Anson ’ s Tower of the Winds at Shugborough Hall, with its delightful baby-blue and gold ceiling based on Nero ’ s Golden House in Rome. Another notable tower is Dane Holger Rosenkranz ’ Pirkentavl Tower in Denmark ’ s Rosenholm Castle, which dates from about 1600. The tower or Heredom had the same esoteric role as God ’ s Mountain, the place of testing, as did the Tholos at Delphi. The Rosicrucians briefly described it in the Chymical Wedding by Christian Rosenkreutz, Knight of the Golden Stone, 1459. 432 The Danes know the tower as the first University of Jutland . It was an important library of Danish national treasures with an alchemical laboratory in the basement. The Rosenkranz family still tells of how Holger the Learned Rosenkranz and Gyldenstierne from M ø llerup (the neighbouring estate) met Shakespeare in an English inn. They told Shakespeare that ghosts haunted Gyldenstierne's guest room at Rosenholm. Shakespeare probably saw there a copy of Saxo Grammaticus ’ Gesta Danorum ( The Feats of the Danes ), dated about 1100 CE, and the Odyssey in which Ulysses ’ son Telemachus feigns a dullard and then like Horus killed Set, Telemachus killed his uncle to prevent his mother marrying a second time. 433 Interestingly, the root Telemach contains Hamlet ’ s name, reversed. Shakespeare decided to relocate his play from Greece to Denmark. Macrobius described how the two pillars represent the portal od the sun, Capricorn and Cancer, with the Milky Way between them. 434 One is the portal of men and the other the portal of the gods. It was"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 121 believed that souls passed through these portals when coming in light beams from the sky to the earth and returning from the earth to heaven. Another two columns, those of Osiris and Isis at Nysa in Arabia, were famous in antiquity.

I am the eldest son of Saturn; I was born of a brilliant and magnificent egg, and my substance is of the same nature as that which composes light. There is no place in the Universe where I have not appeared, to bestow my benefits and make my discoveries ... The inscription on the right column showed that Isis represented establishment: 436 I am Isis, Queen of this country. I was instructed by Mercury. No one can destroy the laws, which I have established. I am the eldest daughter of Saturn, most ancient of Gods. I am the wife and sister of Osiris the king. I first made known to mortals the use of wheat. I am the mother of Horus the king. In my honour was the city of Bubastis built. Rejoice, O Egypt, rejoice, land that gave me birth. B and I , the first initials of Boaz and Jachin, are also the first and last letters of the ancient Goidelic, Bronze Age Ogham alphabet, and symbolically stand for inception and death. 437 Together the two pillars B and I represent the stability of the universe and Gods One Body . 438 Their consummation with the keystone of a perfect individual, the lintel or arch of Peace, Equilibrium and Joy, is visible only to the initiated. 439 It is the royal or kingly secret. The Knights Templar represented this arch by the Pillar of Beauty , nicknamed the Apprentice Pillar , featured in Rosslyn Chapel. The Zohar ’ s alchemical formula says that the pillars of gold and antimony are to be firmly con-tempered and intertwined together. The consummation is Justice ( Tzedeq ) herself coupled with Judgment ( Meshephat ): 440 Come and see! When Tzedeq, Justice, is mitigated by that Meshephat, Judgment, then it is called TzDQH, Tsedeqah, Liberality. This same Liberality is the abode of Gods throne, the Merkabah : 441 And sometimes they call the same. MLKI TzDQ MLK SHLM, Meleki Tsedeq Melek Shalem, meaning Melchizedek, King of Salem."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 122 Liberality is fundamental to the highest degrees of Freemasonry. General Pike echoed it in the thirty-second degree of the Scottish Rite: 442 The Royal Secret, of which you are a Prince, if you are a true Adept, if knowledge seems to you advisable, and Philosophy is, for you, radiant with divine beauty, is that which the Zohar (Kabbalah) terms The Mystery of the Balance. It is the secret of the Universal Equilibrium ... Of that Equilibrium between Good and Evil, Light and Darkness in the World, which assures us that all is the work of Infinite Wisdom and of an infinite Love ... The thirty-two degrees also corresponds to the thirty-two paths of wisdom in the Kabbalah. The correspondence that God ’ s Name, Elohim, occurs thirty-two times in the first Chapter of Genesis intrigues Gematrists. In the Kabbalah, these paths bring Binah or Understanding from the heart. In the Sepher Yetzirah, the paths relate to Hochmah or Wisdom. We have an able demonstration of the Zohar ’ s expression of Liberality in Shakespeare ’ s Merchant of Venice (1596). Portia, the white maiden of Mercury discovered in lead, impersonates the civil doctor of law, Balthasar, to argue the famous message of Mercy in Judgment to Shylock the Jew: 443 Balthasar: The quality of mercy is not strain'd ... It is an attribute to God himself; And earthly power doth then show likest God's When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew, Though justice be thy plea, consider this, That, in the course of justice, none of us Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy; And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea. Greed drives Shylock the Jew to ignore Liberality . He therefore loses his legal case. This play is not really about Christian-Jewish relationships. While Jewish Rabbis would not be in wholehearted agreement with Shylock ’ s ignominious fate, they would agree that his intransigence justified the forfeit of his right to repayment. It is from the Rabbis ’ appreciation of Liberality that they earn their appellation of Humanists . The same Portia then lays intertwined with her alter ego, the civil doctor of law, Balthasar. She is the severity of Justice and he, as we have"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" 123 seen, is Mercy in Judgment . Thus merged we have the manna , the ultimate consummation of Liberality from Wisdom: 444 Portia: I will become as liberal as you; I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow ... ... I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio; For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me. Bassanio: Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow: When I am absent, then lie with my wife. Lorenzo: Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way Of starved people. The lines above are perhaps the most important philosophical statement in all Shakespeare ’ s works. Portia is just Pallas Athena in another guise. In Greek myth, Athene always displayed great mercy in a criminal trial at the Areiopagus. 445 When the judges ’ votes were equal, she always cast her vote to liberate the accused. In ancient Vedic terms, the two pillars B and I representing Mercy in Judgment and Justice , are the first Principle of Creation and Truth called Brahm â and the third Principle of Transformation, Destruction and Regeneration called Shiva . The consummate Pillar of Beauty that represents Liberality is Vishnu, the second Principle of All Pervading Light. The Scottish Rite sees the ultimate expression of Liberality in Christ ’ s unselfish dying words that seek Mercy in the judgment of his enemies Eli, Eli Lama Sabachthani meaning my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me, have pity on and forgive my enemies . 446 The play Initiation of Plato also explains the veiled nature of the Wisdom of Liberality . Plato argues that Science can remove the veil of Isis. The Priest or Patriarch counters it cannot: 447 First Patriarch: Approach without fear. Which is the most beautiful and noble study to which man can devote himself in passing through the world? Plato: That which has for its object the knowledge of what he is, whence he comes, and whither he goes; that which leads to a search for the laws of nature within and without him. First Patriarch: Isis and Osiris, the moon and the sun, both symbolize nature; when they represent it by Isis a veil covers her. What is its sense?"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 124 Plato: That of the inscription upon her statue in the Temple of Sais: ‘ I am all that has been, all which is, all that which will be, and no mortal man has yet raised the veil which covers me. ’ Plato: I think that is false.

First Patriarch: No, the difficulty is not removed! Thou canst [ i.e. can ] calculate the weight of the stars, their velocity, their distance, and the paths which they overrun; thou canst investigate the laws of light and electricity; and make the thunderbolt thy auxiliary; plane down or pierce the mountain, cruise the abyss.

Plato: It is the practical application of the law of rendering to all that which is his due. The Archbishop of Canterbury twice underlined the importance of Mercy in judgment at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II on 2 June 1953. 448 In her Coronation Oath, the Queen responded to the Archbishop of Canterbury: Archbishop: Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgments? Queen Elizabeth: I Will Later in the Ceremony, the Queen sat clothed in the Pall of Cloth of Gold called the Lord ’ s robe of righteousness with the armills or garments of salvation. The Archbishop invested her with the Orb, which he only delivers to kings or queens actually reigning, and never to kings and queens consort. The Orb represents the supreme political power of independent sovereignty. It symbolizes the world in the form of the primeval mound of Egypt. It also represents the star of redemption, which is the metal antimony that redeems gold, and the Orb surmounted by a cross is the chemical symbol for antimony. The Archbishop said:"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 125 Archbishop: Receive this Orb, set under the cross, and remember that the whole world is subject to the Power and Empire of Christ our Redeemer. The Archbishop then delivered two sceptres into the Queen ’ s hands, as in depicted in the enthronement of Pharaohs in Egypt. Into the Queen ’ s right hand, the Archbishop placed the Sceptre with the Cross saying: Archbishop: Receive the Royal Sceptre, the ensign of kingly power and justice. This is the Royal Scepter of gold, representing kingly power, complemented by the Scepter with the Dove with an Orb symbolizing the forgiveness and redemption role of antimony. Then, into the Queen ’ s left hand, he placed the Sceptre with the Dove saying: Archbishop: Receive the rod of equity and mercy. Be so merciful that you be not too remiss; so execute justice that you forget not mercy ... . The British Crown Jewels date from Charles II and so are relatively modern. Sadly, the Royal Sceptre lacks a magnificient rock crystal orb, which is the ancient emblem of divine kingship because it represents the priestly ability to compass the sun. 449 The orb in the Royal Sceptre is often referred to as the Star of Jacob because in the prophecy of Balaam, the Sceptre represents the Messiah: There shal come a Star out of Jacob, and a Club or Sceptre (Shaivet) shall rise out of Israel. While the English Crown Jewels lack a rock crystalorb, the Honours of Scotland include such an orb in the Royal Sceptre of King James IV. Either Pope Innocent VII in 1491 or Pope Alexander VI in 1494 presented the Royal Sceptre to hum along with a Golden Rose. After presentation of the Sceptres, a pivotal moment, the Archbishop then crowned the Queen saying: Archbishop: ... God crown you with a crown of glory and righteousness, that having a right faith and manifold fruit of good works, you may obtain the crown of an everlasting kingdom by the gift of Him Whose kingdom endureth for ever.

She founded also the sanctuary of Harran, and made on idol of gold, called Sinn. The earliest Biblical association with the Commagene is with Noah's Ark landing in the mountains of Ararat, rather than on Mount Ararat itself. Ararat is really the Akkadian word for the homeland of the Urartu people. This feared Indo-Iranian civilization at Tushpa on Lake Van in the Commagene existed from 1275BCE to 590BCE. 450 Josephus, the Koran, Kurdish Jews, Yezidis and Mandaean Sabians all hold that the true resting-place of the Ark was actually on Mount Judi, not Mount Ararat. 451 Mount Judi is probably the 2114-meter high peak, Cudi Da ğ i, near Sirnak, one hundred and four kilometers south of Lake Van and one hundred and sixty kilometers west of Harran. Lake Van is the central feature of the Commagene. Tradition holds that Noah ’ s son, Shem, dwelt on the west bank of this lake where a mountain now bears his name. 452 Biblical scholars often identify Shem with Melchizedek. 453 In myth, all Semitic speaking peoples descend from him. 454 Shem ’ s son Tarban, his thirty brothers, fifteen sisters and their husbands are reputed to have settled in the same area. Another of Noah ’ s three sons, Japheth, had a descendant called Hayk. 455 This giant-man reputedly helped build the Tower of Babel. Folklore suggests that he became the patriarch of the Armenians in this province on the northwest shore of Lake Van. Genesis records that Abraham sojourned in Harran on his journey from Ur of the Chaldees, which is Urfa or Edessa, to Canaan. 456 Rebecca drew water for Abraham ’ s servant in Harran to show that she was the chosen wife for Isaac. 457 Isaac ’ s son Jacob married in Harran. He spent fourteen years there, seven for each wife. 458 Jacob was reborn in Harran as Isra-El , meaning struggles with god , as described in Chapter 5. In Ancient Egyptian the name Isra-El stands for the visible, manifest face or soul of the Light of God . 459 "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" 128 The names Abi-ram (Abraham), Yasmah-El ( Ishmael ), Yaqob ( Jacob) and El-Laban ( Laban ) all appear at Mari near Harran, on the River Euphrates. The town of Abraham's brother Nahor also appears as Nakkur and Assyrian texts mention a town named after Abraham ’ s father Terah , together with names derived from the tribes of Gad and Dan. 460 The city of Mari controlled the southern trade route from Mesopotamia. Harran had equal strategic importance. It controlled the northern route from Mesopotamia to western Asia. Abraham's family was prominent in both these gateway cities so Abraham would undoubtedly have been an important person. A Chaldean Priest called Berossus prepared a history of the mythology of Babylonia in 280BCE. He says of Abraham: 461 After the deluge, in the tenth generation, was a certain man among the Chaldeans renowned for justice and great exploits, and for skill in the celestial sciences. Josephus agrees with this conclusion about Abraham. He tells us that Abraham ruled Damascus where he was a foreigner having come from the land above Babylon with an army. 462 We know little about Abraham's reasons for swiftly moving to Kadesh-Barnea in the Negev and the journey to Egypt. 463 He has military allies in the area and a mobile corps of three hundred and eighteen fighting men under his command. 464 Abraham ’ s Warriors of Jah (Yuddha or Yudh) mirror Brahm ’ s legendary fighters, the Ayodhya. 465 Ayodhya are Yehudiya or Judea. In Sanskrit, this means The Unconquerable . They remained aloof from the Amalekites and other non-believers in the ancient Indian philosophy of Yah, also called the Cult of the Material Universe. It appears that Abraham's military movements relate to the Hyksos invasion of Egypt: 466 Abraham and his family came from Ur in Sumer to Hebron in Canaan, probably about 1850BCE and there are good reasons for placing Joseph's migration to Egypt during the Hyksos period. The presence of Abraham's half-sister and wife, Sarai, amongst the Hittites who occupied Hebron confirms the Hittites were allies. The Hittite respect for Abraham is apparent from the Biblical passage that mentions the well-known field of Abraham: 467 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah. And Sarah died in Kirjath- arba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 129 came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchers bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulcher, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth ... And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan. And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a burying-place by the sons of Heth. Abraham's importance is also evident in early Aramaic documents and widespread ancestor worship of Abraham among Semitic peoples. This extended from Mari to Canaan and even to the Ka ’ aba, the central shrine of Islam in Mecca. 468 In the tenth century CE, the Arab writer Al-Kindi agreed that Abraham lived in Harran for four-score years and ten, worshiping the moon deity. Certainly several of the names in Abraham ’ s family are derived from the worship of the Moon God and seem to confirm this: Abraham ’ s father Terah , Laban , Sarai and Milcah . 469 Abraham is a synonym for Ab-ram and Ab-Sin the Moon God. This association was important because Abraham, like Sin, represents water and therefore fertility. 470 He was the giver of time and the principal ambassador of the unseen god whom the Mesopotamians called Marilaha meaning lord of all or Be ’ elshamin meaning lord of heavens . Kenneth Mackenzie's compendium of freemasonry, or rather irregular freemasonry, the Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia notes how the association of Abraham and Light was widely accepted by Freemasons in the early 1900's: 471 There is probably some truth in the statement that Abraham was acquainted with the doctrine of Aur, or Light, as he is actually described as coming from Ur, of the Chaldees, by which it is probably meant, that he came from one of the ancient Chaldean Colleges in which this mystical doctrine was taught."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" 130 The Hebrew word Ur means Light , fortress or castle. 472 All Hebrew names commencing with Ur generally have some interpretation relative to light. Uriel means fire of God , Urija the flame of Yahweh and the Uriah the light of Yahweh . The widespread honour accorded Abraham leaves us with an impressive portrait of the man. In contrast, the Bible humbly paints him as an unassuming herder and reluctant Patriarch. It is perhaps most appropriate to regard Abraham as an archetype of the emergent proto- Israelite political identity. Harran became the most successful centre of worship for the planetary gods from at least the time of Abraham until the Mongol Genghis Khan destroyed its last temple in 1260CE. The priests of Harran blended planet-worship with practical alchemy and with the Greek philosophies of Pythagoras and Plato over a period of at least three thousand years. Their gods included Hermes and the Good god Agathodaimon . Hermes is also the Muslim Prophet Seth , the third son of Adam . Agathodaimon is the prophet Idris or Enoch , and similar to Osiris . The Caliph Al Mamoun of Baghdad called the unusual people of Harran Sabians in 830CE. 473 When the Caliph noticed the unusual dress of the people, he challenged the town to establish its credentials. After some creative thought, the people gave their name as Sabians and their sacred book as the Corpus Hermeticum. The great Jewish philosopher Maimonides (1135-1204CE) had nothing but contempt for the excesses of these Sabians. 474 He writes in his Guide of the Perplexed that the Sabians believed the universe was eternal rather than created and the stars were the only divine beings. He confirms that they manufactured ridiculous stories about Adam, Seth and Noah and attributed the metals and the climates to the planets . He says that Abraham was the first to recognize the absurdity of the tales in which he had been brought up . 475 Maimonides says Abraham opposed the Sabian star religion, proclaiming the name of the Lord, the God of the Universe. The Sabians saw the planets as conduits for divine energy and available for everyone to understand. 476 Within the walls of Harran were seven temples. These represented the sun, moon and five known planets. Construction of each temple ensured that the presence of the God infused the entire structure. Additional temples existed to The First Cause , The First Reason , World Order , Necessity , The Soul and to Hermes Trismegistus ."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" 131 The main temples indicate an advanced knowledge of metallurgy and alchemy. The most important temple, indeed one of the most famous in antiquity, was for the revered Moon god, Sin . 477 It was octagonal although variously described as round. The Temple was white in color and had a cult image made of silver atop three steps. Other planetary temples were of different shapes, colors and had different numbers of steps beneath the cult image. The temple of the Sun was square, yellow and the golden image stood on a pedestal six steps high. Pearls and a crown adorned the image. Mercury ’ s temple was a square within a hexagon. The cult image was cast alloy from a mixture of all other metals. Mercury filled its hollow interior. The temple was brown in color and the cult image stood on four steps. The brown color suggests philosophic Mercury, which is antimony, rather than bright silver metallic mercury. The discovery of a vase, or perhaps an electrical battery, made from antimony and small amounts of iron in the Chaldean city of Telloh supports this. 478 The vase dates from 3000BCE. The Discovery Channel program Mysterious Universe presented in May 1998 showed that when filled with grape juice, this battery produced ½ volt and enough energy to electroplate a silver statuette with gold. The temple to Venus was triangular and painted blue. It had one long side. The cult image was made of copper and stood on five steps. Priestesses dressed in white played musical instruments. Mars ’ temple was rectangular and colored red. Weapons hung on the walls. The cult image was of iron raised on a pedestal of seven steps. The temple to Jupiter was a triangular building, made of green stone, with a pointed roof. Its cult image was made of tin and sat on a throne raised on a pedestal of eight steps. Saturn's temple was hexagonal and built of black stone. It had black curtains hung about it. The cult image was of lead and stood upon a throne raised on nine steps. The seven temples correspond to the number of planes of existence from the material to the spiritual and the seven main degrees of initiation (see Appendix 7). The seven temples are also analogous to the seven gates of the Underworld and are an ancient path of ritual. After the first two steps of preparation, the first proper initiation grade is that of the Moon (three steps), the second Mercury (four steps), third Venus (five steps), fourth the Sun (six steps), fifth Mars (seven steps), sixth Jupiter (eight steps) and seventh Saturn (nine steps). 479 Ascending through all the grades, equivalent to the seven parts of the soul, the candidate arrives at"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" 132 the last or eighth part properly qualified with an understanding of Righteousness, or Liberality. It was only then that the candidate is ready to receive the rights of emancipation. Harran was also the home of a school of translators who specialized in Greek mathematics and astronomy. This was a privileged sect under the well-known teacher Thabit ibn Qurra , a Sabian Syriac- speaking translator and scholar working in Baghdad who became one of the great names in the history of Islamic science, especially in mathematics, astronomy and medicine. His name derives from the same root, K û r , as the furnace and smithy-god. The school transmitted ancient Pythagorean wisdom to the Muslim world until at least tenth century CE when visited by the Arab writer Al-Masudi. 480 The school of Thabit ibn Qurra had a major part in the preparation of the romances of the Holy Grail, which had such a profound influence on the Knights Templar. Another mysterious esoteric school called the Sarmoung Brotherhood existed near Harran. 481 In his book, Meetings with Remarkable Men George Gurdjieff claims to have met with the strange Brotherhood in the late 1890s while living in Bukhara in western Uzbekistan. 482 He approached their secret monastery blindfolded. This secret headquarters was probably in the region of Nusaybin, also known as Nisibis, which lies south of Lake Van, about 200km East of Harran, on the Turkish border with Syria. 483 This school seems to be an archetype of the many forms of esoteric schools that existed over thousands of years in the same area. The Persian word Sarmoung means both bee and purified head . It is associated with traditional wisdom and those that transmit the mysterious power of Zoroaster. Sufi adepts use the analogy to make a head of gold to refer to ritual alchemy. We shall see in Chapter 18 how the Knights Templar also revered a metal head. Zoroaster was most probably born in the region of Uzbekistan around 1800BCE to 1600BCE. Uzbekistan is north of Bactria, the Jewel of Iran, where the priestly proto-Israelite tribe, called the Calani, lived before moving to the Anatolian Commagene. 484 Northern Afghanistan, then called Uttara Kuru, and was a great center of learning. 485 The red sand deserts of Kiz'il-Kum in Uzbekistan and Kara-kum in Turkmenistan also lie in this region. The Afghan Hindu Kush and Tajikistan Pamir extensions of the Himalayas border these vast deserts in the west and south respectively. In the north, the deserts cease at the great"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" 133 Oxus (Amu Darya) and Jaxartes (Syrdar î ya) Rivers and the Aral Sea. By 100BCE, the famed cities of Bukhara and Samarkand were part of the Silk Road. Yet, as we saw in Chapter 4, itinerant groups crossed these deserts many thousands of years before this time. Hundreds of ancient ruins in this early crucible of the Indo-Hittites are yet to reveal their secrets. Zoroastrian cosmic dualism is the earliest form of dualism exemplified by Zoroaster. His name means the living star or stream of the star . Zoroaster bears a great affinity with the Egyptian Thoth and Hermes Trismegistus. 486 Simple Zoroastrianism is cosmic or monarchical dualism. The Good Religion of Ahura Mazda maintains the world, which is a Good creation of God. 487 However, evil, sin and death constantly assail it. Ahura Mazda originally had a perfectly good son called Spenta Mainyu . Later, this Good son amalgamated with Ahura Mazda as the Holy Spirit . Ahura Mazda also had a perfectly bad son called Angra Mainyu or Ahriman who later became the rebel Watcher Azazel and ultimately became Satan . Angra Mainyu cannot help being evil because it is his predestined fate. The Good Religion of Ahura Mazda maintains that throughout life the moral choice between Truth or Good , and Untruth or Evil , confronts man. Death brings judgment. Those found Good are elevated to the House of Song . The House of Worst receives those who chose Untruth . A mixed region called Hamistagan awaits those people whose deeds are in precise balance. Shakespeare had an excellent grasp of the Good Religion . In Hamlet, the King's ghost could not pass to its rest because the poor king had not completed the task of shifting the balance of his acts toward Good . He was condemned to a long age of misery, darkness, ill food and the crying of woe. 488 Indeed, it was a vile crime to put any person into such a heinous situation, even worse than regicide. Through adherence to the Good Religion , through good deeds, piety and righteousness, man cultivates the divine element in himself to become a Good Man , friend and helper of the gods. 489 Good is destined to overcome Evil at the end time . This is twelve thousand years from the creation of the world. At this time, Ahura Mazda will resurrect the dead for final Judgment by pure fire and molten iron. 490 Man is an intrinsically Good creation destined for immortality in Paradise.

In this elixir of salvation, we can see the Philosophers' Stone, manna or dew . An early proto-Jesus also emerges from the amalgam of Ahura Mazda's perfectly good son Spenta Mainyu and the virgin born savior, the Saoshyant . East of Harran is the famous Hierothesion temple, built by the Commagene's most famous king, Antiochus I Epiphanes. He succeeded his father Mithridates in about 69CE. The Hierothesion displays a famous relief of Antiochus I shaking hands with Hercules in a way familiar to Freemasons. An abundance of evidence leads to the conclusion that Antiochus I was a leader of one of the mystery brotherhoods of the Commagene, such as the fabled Sarmoung Brotherhood . 491 Yet, there are many other possibilities of brotherhoods because the religiously tolerant Persian nobles had widely settled the interior of Anatolia after the invasion of King Cyrus in 546BCE. The successors of Cyrus claimed divine kingship through the grace of Ahura Mazda. For this reason the nobles would have enthusiastically supported the tolerant Zoroastrian philosophy. This same tolerance saw the Jews repatriated to Jerusalem, protected from the Samaritans and with sufficient funds to rebuild the Second Temple. Ostanes the Mede, Xerxes ’ (519-465BCE) brother-in-law, was a well-known Persian Magus and local administrator or satrap . Pliny the Elder and Georgius Syncellus of the ninth century CE note that Ostanes was known as the master of all magi , a father of alchemy and of medicine, mineralogy and botany. He taught priests and philosophers at Memphis in Egypt. 492 The great Jewish alchemist Maria the Jewess was reputedly a student or fellow instructor of Ostanes. She gave her name to the ubiquitous cafeteria bain-marie, the vessel of Mary. A cook fills a bain-marie with hot or boiling water and then places another vessel in it to slowly cook or keep hot. Another prominent sect in the area was the School of the Persians . Expelled from Edessa by the Romans in 489CE, the school relocated to Nusaybin. 493 The Christian Emperor Justinian closed down Athens ’ Platonic Academy in 529CE. The philosophers Damascius and Simplicius relocated close to Harran. Simplicius was a follower of Xenophanes ’ Eleatic School. These philosophers would have greatly enriched society"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 135 in and around Harran, strengthening its focus as the epicenter of hermetic thought. The work of Eudoxus of Knidos showed that the philosophies from Persia, Greece and Egypt combined in Harran. Eudoxus was a contemporary of Plato in four hundred BCE but known only through the writings of Aristotle and Simplicius. Studying in Heliopolis, he prepared sections of Euclid's Elements of Geometry and was renowned as the greatest of all Greek astronomers. He reputedly introduced Persian Zoroastrianism to the Greeks. Pliny the Elder noted that Eudoxus believed Zoroaster lived six thousand years before his time. The presence of these great men in the Commagene demonstrates a depth and breadth of religious and philosophical tolerance that is arguably as great as in any other country at any other time in history. The city of Harran has always had the special and mysterious status of a sanctuary. The Crusaders who held Edessa until 1146CE never invaded nearby Harran. Crusader arches and Gothic structures in the city may pre-date the introduction of Gothic architecture into France. 494 Sir Christopher Wren, the renowned architect of St Paul ’ s Cathedral in London, attributed the majesty of Gothic architecture to Knights Templar and other Crusaders in bringing back Muslim ideas on science and architecture from the Near East: 495 What we now vulgarly call Gothik ought properly and truly to be named the Saracenick Architecture refined by the Christians. Yet, religious tolerance in Harran had effectively ended some one hundred years before the Crusaders. The Seljuk Turks occupied Baghdad in 1055CE. The Sabian Schools of Baghdad and Harran made their way to Constantinople where Michael Psellus was leading a Platonic revival. 496 Michael Psellus later became Prime Minister of Constantinople. Although the Sabians of Yemen are quite distinct from the Sabians of Harran, there are many reasons to consider a strong connection between the two groups. The Sabians of Yemen claim to have derived from the prosperous city of Ma'rib in South Arabia. Many Arab tribes at the time of Mohammed claimed they took to the desert when their old and wealthy civilization in South Arabia declined. They were the Musri, which we discussed in Chapter 5. This region in South Arabia was Saba to the Israelites and pronounced Sheba . 497 Saba or Tsaba referred to an Arab version of Hindu Brahmaism. Tsaba, in Sanskrit, means Assembly of the Gods. The name"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 136 Saba also relates to Caba as in Kabbalah . 498 A colony of Brahmins from India founded one of the shrines in the Kaaba in the Temple of Mecca. The Brahmins made pilgrimages to worship Brahm and Abraham for several centuries after his time. 499 Today, some Israeli-born people are proudly nicknamed Sabras , meaning tough on the outside and tender on the inside . From a Biblicallament for the city of Tyre, we know that both Harran and Saba or Sheba traded in similar goods: 500 Harran, Canneh and Eden and merchants of Sheba, Asshur and Kilmad traded with you. In your marketplaces they traded with you beautiful garments, blue fabric, embroidered work and multicolored rugs with cords twisted and tightly knotted. Two other groups of Sabians also lived in Mesopotamia. These were the Soba , or Syriac Semites of Northern Mesopotamia, and the Subbhas who moved from Harran to Southern Mesopotamia. The Sabians also include the Mandaeans that followed John the Baptist and the Nazarenes. 501 All of the Sabians of Yemen, Soba , Nabateans and the Sabians of Harran followed a similar complex system of astral worship. The premier god was the Moon God who ruled over the god of the sun and the seven planetary gods. Ma ’ rib, the capital of the Sabians of Yemen, had an imposing temple to the Moon God Sin . The Moon God was known by a number of names such as ‘ Illumquh by the Sabians, ‘ Amm and ‘ Anbay by the Qatabanians, Wadd (or love ) by the Minaeans and Sin by the Hadramis. 502 The Moon God is the progenitor of the ancient Arabian high God al-Llah . Like El, his name simply means God and it is represented by the crescent moon. This is the symbol we see on the Arabic flags and in many paintings of the Virgin Mary based on the vision of John of Patmos: 503 A great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars. Diodorus Siculus notes of the Sabians of Yemen: 504 This tribe surpasses not only its neighboring Arabs but also other men in wealth and in their several extravagances besides. For in the exchange and sale of their wares they, of all men who carry on trade for the sake of silver they receive in exchange, obtain the highest price in return for things of the smallest weight. Consequently, since they have never for ages suffered the ravages"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" 137 of war because of their secluded position, and since an abundance of both gold and silver abounds in the country, ... they have embossed goblets of every description, made of silver and gold, couches and tripods with silver feet, and every other furnishing of incredible costliness, and halls encircled by large columns, some of them gilded, and others having silver figures on the capitals. Their ceilings and doors they partitioned by means of panels and coffers made of gold, set with precious stones and placed close together, and have thus made the structure of their houses in every part marvelous for its costliness; for some parts they have constructed of silver and gold, other of ivory and the most showy precious stones or of whatever else men esteem most highly. The Nabatean group was a second prominent Arab culture, centered on Petra in the Southern Sinai in the land of the Edomites. They traded with the Sabians of Harran over the period six hundred BCE to four hundred BCE. The Sabians of Yemen and the Nabateans had a very close affinity because both claimed the crucial female line of descent to Ishmael through Bashemath, the wife of Esau. Esau and Bashemath gave birth to Ruel the Midianite. Also called Jethro, he was Moses ’ father-in-law. Ruel then became a priest of Yaho the Moon God. Many biblical scholars believe that Moses was also a priest of the Moon God. The headdress of the Levite priests seems to confirm this as it displayed the crescent moon of Sin. The Nabatean storm god was Duchares who was later identified with Dionysus. Like Yahweh, the Nabateans worshipped Duchares on high rocky places. However, both Duchares and his consort, the fertility goddess, were subservient to the Moon God. We continue to see the triple character of God represented by three deities. A perfect ashlar or square block of stone often represented the three dimensions of this divine triad. Similarly, the Holy of Holies was a perfect cube in King Solomon's Temple that symbolized the wholeness of God. A Rabbinical tradition joins the Sabians of Harran and the Nabateans through one of the Kings of the Edomites who reigned before there were any kings over the Israelites. 505 The King was Mezahab after mezahah , which means the water of gold or aurum potable. 506 The"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" 138 Israelites never bestowed an important name such as Mezahab at random. It was in recognition of an important event or connection. 507 From aurum potable and the words of Diodorus Siculus, we can detect a metallurgical link of gold between Harran and Ma'rib. Mezahab may also be a half-hidden cipher name of Yahweh. In a similar way, modern computer encryption halves its cryptographic key for security. At least one thousand years ago Massoretic authors halved Yahweh ’ s name and encrypted it with the Atbash Cipher. The last four letters of Mezahab make Ahab , which is Hebrew for like the Father . The Atbash Cipher hides the first two letters MTz , which are Yd He, and the first two letters of YHWH (see Appendix 10 for a description of the Atbash Cipher). Similarly, Mitzvah ( MTzWH ), which means Commandment, deciphers to Jehovah ( YHWH ). Like the Egyptian God Amun, the name of YHWH signifies He Causes to Become . Yahweh achieves this from the Hebrew verb hawah ( HWH ) that means to become . Again, as with Amun, the priests hid from view Yahweh ’ s full name. 508 There is still a tribe of Sabians of Yemen in Oman on the Arabian Peninsula. They claim to descend from a great race comparable to the Egyptians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks and Romans. The tribe gathers frankincense resins in the old way. Frankincense resin was in such demand that it was equal in value to gold in ancient times. Due to the wealth from frankincense, the Romans designated the land Arabia Felix or Fortunate Arabia . There is a final intriguing parallel between the Commagene and Yemen. As we have seen with the dual Sabian populations, there were also two cities of Dilmun. One is on Bahrain Island and the other in the Commagene in Anatolia. The Sumerians believed they came from the former, the island of Dilmun, where the kings lived before the flood . 509 Geoffroy Bibby located this legendary Dilmun on Bahrain Island, just off the Sinai Peninsula, in 1956. This Dilmun was a city, the size of the Babylonian city of Ur, with its own seals and other commercial objects similar to Ur. It had a sophisticated underground water supply that allowed it to become a large trading centre between Ur and Mohenjo-Daro on the West Bank of the Indus River in Pakistan. 510 Sites on the coast of Pakistan at Dwaraka, in the Gulf of Kutch, and on India ’ s coast in the Gulf of Cambay, suggest a long tradition of advanced pre-inundation civilizations in the region.

This will underpin the Gnostic and hermetic interpretations of alchemy that are to come."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" 140 Chapter 9 Hasmonaeans, Pharisees & Zaddoki By the time of King David, the power of the sacrificing Levite and Aaronic priests was waning. David created an additional High Priest position alongside the High Priest of Aaron who was Abiathar. He installed a local Jebusite called Zadok in this position to administer the religion of Yahweh. 512 The Jebusites were elite Hurrians. Zadok, or Sadak, a supernaturally endowed snake priest of Brahm, traced his ancestry to the legendary Melchizedek, Abraham ’ s teacher of a millennium before. 513 About four hundred years after David, King Josiah and the Zaddoki expelled the Aaronic High Priesthood altogether. 514 After the return from Exile, Zerubbabel and Jesus ben Yehozedek, the Son of the Zadokite High Priest who had recommenced control of the Temple, rebuilt the Second Temple. Then, in 444BCE, Nehemiah ejected the Zaddoki from Temple Mount. His reasons are unknown although the implication is that the Zaddoki were out of touch with the assembly in Jerusalem. However, the Zaddoki were still present one hundred and fourteen years later when the Assyrian Greeks forcibly removed the High Priest Onias III in about 330BCE. The Zaddoki continued to support the Onian High Priesthood. The Dionysian Artificers who settled in Israel sometime before one thousand BCE founded the Cassidens or Assideans that later became the Chassidim . 515 They claimed to possess a special knowledge unknown to the mass of the people and the true knowledge of the scriptures transmitted to their order by Moses on Mount Sinai. 516 While this knowledge relates to Liberality , discussed in Chapter 7, it would also have included those laws first revealed to Moses in the wilderness. These were the Mosaic rules governing tithes, shewbread, wine-libations and sacrifices. 517 The Chassidim developed a particular system of written and oral law that brought them respect as a school of interpreters of the Law. On return from the Exile, the Chassidim adopted a moral code formulated by the descendants of the Aaronic Priests. 518 From the Chassidim arose the Pharisees and Rabbinical Judaism. The Sons of Zadok are mutually exclusive; the line of Zadok does not include any of the twenty-four Aaronid clans. 519 The commitment of the Chassidim to the common law led them"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" 141 to resist all Greek and other foreign influences that undermined their depth of tradition. Consequently, the Chassidim of this period supported the Maccabee Revolution because the Maccabean-Hasmonaeans upheld Divine Law. The Hasmonaeans led the tribe of Jehoiarib, which was the premier priestly family of the twenty-four families that constituted Judaism. They took their name from Hasmon, or Asmon, the great grandfather of Judas ben Mattathias. For his success in the 167BCE Jewish War of Independence, Judas ben Mattathias earned the nom-de- guerre of Maccabee , meaning Hammer of God . The term Maccabee derived from the shape of the Tau-cross. The makkabah, which is a hammer or pick, is similar. 520 With the Jewish War of Independence won, the Maccabees claimed the priesthood of the Temple. Syria, although defeated, accorded them religious freedom in 163BCE and in 142BCE granted political independence. With this Simon, son of Mattathias achieved recognition as High Priest Ethnarch of the Jews (142BCE-134BCE). The Maccabean-Hasmonaeans grew even stronger. Following recognition of Simon as the High Priest Ethnarch of the Jews, the Maccabees gained royal aspirations. They assumed the throne as Priest- Kings with popular encouragement by the fourth generation 103BCE to 76BCE. In contrast to the Chassidim who supported the Maccabean- Hasmonaean High Priesthood, the Zaddoki party rebelled against these interlopers. The Zaddoki claimed they profaned the Temple. Circumcision and sacrifice were two of the main issues at stake. The Zaddoki again found they were out of step with the Great Assembly. They introduced their eponymous ancestor Melchizedek into the Book of Genesis and Psalms and moved to the wilderness of the Dead Sea. 521 There the Zaddoki society lived in the exile of Qumran and other Dead Sea villages as the purified Melchizedekian sect of the Temple. A separatist group of Chassidim called Parushim, or Pharisees in Greek, evolved about the time of the Maccabee John Hyrcanus I, who was High Priest and Ethnarch from 134BCE-104BCE. These Pharisees were deeply affected by Zoroastrianism as implied by their Hebrew name Farsi , which means Persian . The Pharisees directed and measured all state, public and political affairs by the standard of Mosaic Law. They disregarded the Hasmonaean-Maccabees and the priestly-aristocratic Zaddoki. Mosaic Law and Pharisee interpretation formed a new cosmic"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" 142 system of Jewish common law. The Zaddoki or Jewish Christians sect was originally a subset of the Pharisees. 522 Yet, there was little empathy between the Pharisees and Jewish Christians or Zaddoki, whom the Pharisees regarded as sectarian despite their common heritage. Even though the Pharisees were an offshoot of the main body of Chassidim, they regarded the Chassidim with the same suspicion as the Zaddoki. However, the Moreh Tzedek had taught the importance of the future Zadokian High Priest, the Meshiach of Aaron. His followers originally formed the Zaddoki Party. The Pharisees believed that the Chassidim who came after the Moreh Tzedek improperly denied the importance of the Temple and daily sacrifice. In addition, they improperly maintained that a righteous life and prayer should satisfy the needs of sacrifice. Criminal jurisprudence was rigorous under the Maccabee- Hasmonaeans. When Herod the Great seized power from the Maccabees in 36BCE, he replaced the Great Sanhedrin with a Pharisee-orientated Sanhedrin, most likely under the great humanist Pharisees Hillel and Shammai. Herod declared a festival on the day he abolished the Great Sanhedrin. After gaining control of Jerusalem, Herod the Great ordered the drowning of the last Maccabean High Priest Jonathan (Aristobulus III) in 36BCE. Jonathan was Herod ’ s own brother-in-law. Herod then executed all Hasmonaean-Maccabeans within his reach. This included Herod ’ s own wife, the Maccabean Princess Mariamme, and their two sons. Herod promptly appointed Boethus from Egypt as his High Priest and married the daughter of Boethus, another Mariamme. He then made political appointments of non-eminent families to the Temple and the Great Sanhedrin. The Pharisees called them Sadducees, again meaning sectarian. Thus began a rigid and uncertain period of Herodian-Sadducee administration. The newly aristocratic Herodian-Sadducees included absentee property owners who lived in splendor while their tenants absorbed taxes on agricultural production. The Romans imposed a tax of twenty-five percent in addition to a twenty-two percent levy imposed by the Temple. There was a running stream of abuse between the Herodian-Sadducees property owners and their tenants, the Galileans. Talmudic commentaries advised true Jews not to let their daughters marry the people of the land because they are unclean animals . Rabbi Eleazar said The enmity of a"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" 143 common person toward a scholar is even more intense than that of the heathen toward Israelite . He suggested butchering common people on the most holy day of the year, a day forbidden to kill animals. Rabbi Joahanan added that one may tear a common person to pieces like fish . The Herodian-Sadducees had little empathy with the spiritual mission of the Jews. They upheld the importance of sacrificial rituals, regarded the literal Torah as sole authority and denied the immortality of the soul, resurrection after death and the existence of angels. 523 Josephus notes that the Herodian-Sadducees even showed a harsh and disagreeable spirit in their relationships with each other. 524 The Herodian-Sadducees proved no friends to the Zaddoki whom the Maccabean-Hasmonaeans had supplanted. The office of High Priest carried with it presidency of the Great Sanhedrin and responsibility for suppression of revolutionary doctrine. Herod and his Sadducee High Priest turned a ruthless blowtorch on their opponents including the Zaddoki. 525 As with the Jonathan in 36BC, all potential claimants for the position of High Priest were marked for particular vengeance. This policy was still in force when Annas, father-in-law of the High Priest Caiaphas, led the Great Sanhedrin to condemn Jesus the Nazarene to death for blasphemy. His crime was revolutionary insurgency and a valid Zaddoki claim to both the throne of Israel and position of High Priest. The same set of circumstances had already led to the death of Hezekiah and his son Judas the Galilean. It was also the reason that John the Baptist was beheaded. In 62CE, the High Priest Ananus ben Ananus had the next leader, James the Righteous, stoned for the same reason. Josephus wrote that their persecution was not so much because they claimed the throne, but because they were entitled to it. At the time of Herod, the Pharisees administered the Jewish legal system as Presidents of the Pharisaic High Court. There they dispensed Mosaic Law, ran the world system of synagogue worship and were responsible for suppression of heretical doctrine. Due to their absence from the political arena and importance in maintaining the fabric of Jewish society, the Pharisees became the only religious group tolerated by the Romans after the destruction of the third Temple in 70CE. Almost by default, the Pharisees became the sole religious authority of Israel. The absence of the central Temple was not an issue for the Pharisees because they were a cult of the legal system, not of the Temple. From the Roman perspective, the most important point was that they were not nationalistic militants."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" 144 Rabbinical Judaism subsequently developed from the Pharisees. The Rabbis continued to demonstrate three of the characteristics we have come to expect from the Indo-Hittite compression. They supported oral tradition , believed in the immortality of the soul , and sought to eliminate the matriarchal religion of the Great Triple Mother Goddess and frowned on so-called messianic bloodlines. The Pharisees developed standards of jurisprudence to such a degree that they recognized man as fallible and an unlikely paragon of virtue. They defined greatness in a sovereign as mercy in the judgment of others and greatness in a man as overcoming one ’ s own inherent bad side and doing Yahweh ’ s work. Indeed, the Pharisees took pride that many of the Torah ’ s great personae were seriously flawed. 526 Awkward Moses depended upon Aaron for strong leadership. After disobeying Yahweh, Moses died before reaching the Promised Land. Lecherous David coveted his neighbour ’ s wife and sent the unfortunate cuckold to certain death. So stained with war and death was David that Yahweh prevented him from building the Temple of Peace. Solomon tolerated many foreign wives sacrificing to false gods. Fratricidal Cain, fraudulently misleading Jacob, cowardly Jonah, inept Rehoboam, the list goes on. Now, the Pharisees descended from Benjamin. This provided them with a great depth of tradition and legitimacy because Benjamin was the last son of Jacob and Rachel in Harran. Another Benjamite, King Saul , was the hero who delivered Israel from the Philistines. 527 Finally, Judah and Benjamin were the only two tribes that remained faithful to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon. We have seen that the term Sadducee, as used by the Pharisees, means sectarian and potentially heretical. This generic term encompassed all sectarian groups including the widely differing Herodian-Sadducees, remaining Maccabean-Hasmonaeans, Chassidim and Zaddoki. These various groups were so completely unrelated in philosophical perspective that it is not very helpful to refer to all of them as Sadducees. In the next chapter, we use this background to understand Jesus the Nazarene from political and religious perspectives. He was one of the many brave messiahs of the Hasmonaean-Zaddoki in the turbulent time of Roman occupation."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" 145 Chapter 10 Zaddoki & Jesus All the priestly preservers of the holy traditions, including those of the Canaanite holy traditions, traced their heritage to Zadok. In his work about Phoenician religion, Eusebius of Caesarea described the association of Sydek (Zadok, the Just One) with Taautos (Thoth) and Esmun, who is Asklepios (Asclepius): From them were born Misor and Sydek, which means agile and righteous. From Misor was born Taautos ... From Sydek were born the Dioscurs or the Cabyrs ... Sydek, who is called the righteous ... became father of Asklepios. These events were written down for the first time by the seven sons of Sydek, together with their eighth brother, Asklepios, following the instructions of the same god Taautos. The sectarian Zaddoki groups during the turbulent Herodian times were harsh and uncompromising in their Judgment. Many biblical passages can be read either as ritual mysteries of rebirth or as messianic nationalism. The Zaddoki chose the latter. They were messianic, apocalyptic and believed in Holy War. The Zaddoki were comprised of four main sub-groups. These were the Essenes, Zealots, Sicarii and Nazoraeans. The purist Melchizedek Zaddoki was a smaller, less defined group that practiced the Mysteries. They took their name from the root Z-D-K , meaning Righteous , and wandered the Dead Sea communities such as Qumran teaching the Kabbalah and passing on arcane knowledge by word of mouth. 528 The scholarly Essenes had Academies at Engedi, Callirrho ë & Modein. The Essenes were pacifists in the same as way as the Edomites. Diodorus Siculus says of the Edomites: 529 They have no poor amongst their kind, they honour the meek and disposed, and they value mercy, peace and forgiveness of transgressions. Although closely related, there were many significant points of difference between the Essenes and Zaddoki. One was the Essenes ’ abhorrence of Temple sacrifice. 530 Thrice daily, the Sadducees pleaded with God to: “ Send thy curse, O God, upon the Nazarites! ” 531 The Zealots constituted the Lower Priesthood of the Essene Order. Josephus called the Zealots the fourth Philosophy. The other three were the Herodian-Sadducees of the Great Sanhedrin, the Pharisees and"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":" 146 the Essenes. As fanatical Maccabean-Hasmonaean royalists, the Zealots sought restoration of the Hasmonaean monarchy. Their name came from the Zeal for the Covenant of Aaron's grandson Phineas. In sparking the Hasmonaean-Maccabee revolution, the High Priest Mattathias cleaved the head of an Assyrian official. In doing so, he established the Zealots with his command: 532 Whosoever is zealous of the law, and maintaineth the covenant, let him follow me. Two hundred years later, in the 66-70CE uprising, the Zealots decimated the High Priesthood of the Herodian-Sadducees. A proactive wing of the Zealots, called the Sicarii, held out for six years against the Romans at Massada. It seems that amongst them was Jesus of Gennesaret, aged eighty. He was the last rightful inheritor of the Hasmonaean Kings of Israel. Some people believe Jesus of Gennesaret is the same person as Jesus the Nazarene. His faithful general Mennahem, grandson of Judas the Galilean, failed to recapture Jerusalem in 66CE. With Qumran reduced to ruins in 68CE, Jesus of Gennesaret and nine hundred and fifty Zealots awaited the Roman onslaught at Massada. It came on 15 April 73CE, after three years of exhaustive Roman earthworks. Jesus of Gennesaret reputedly prepared a scroll on the eve of Massada ’ s defeat. It disappeared from excavations at Massada in 1964. However, General Yigael Yadin, who was in charge of the excavation, strenuously denies that this missing fifteenth scroll of Massada ever existed. 533 Even more challenging, followers of Buddhism, Hindu and Mohammedan Islam believe Jesus escaped to India via an Essene college at Mayuam-i-Isa, meaning The place where Jesus lived , five kilometers from Damascus, and Anatolian Nisibis. 534 The last of the four Zaddoki groups is the Nazoraeans. Also known as Rechabites, they reputedly provided daughters for the Sons of Zadok to marry. Jeremiah is the first recorded person to have called these Zadokites by the name Rechabites and to note their Zeal. 535 At different times, the Nazoraeans were Nozri, Nazarites, Nazarenes, Naassenes, Palestinian or Jewish Christians, the Jerusalem Community, Ebionites or The Poor. The Nazoraeans have also been associated with the Nasurai priesthood of the Magi of Media, in present day Azerbaijan. Legend holds that their first priest was Enoch.

The traditional meaning of the enigmatic letters I.N.R.I on the titular of Jesus ’ cross is Iesus Nazareus Rex Iudaeorum or Jesus Nazarene, King of the Jews . In the context of the Gnostic ritual of St George, which we shall investigate in Chapter 15, the letters could also mean the deceptively harmless In Nobis Regnat Iesus meaning Jesus reigns within us . The Jesuits gave these letters the exceedingly odd interpretation Justum necare regis impios , meaning Just killing of the ungodly king . Another meaning, more alchemical, is set in the context of the temple Kur. I.N.R.I could mean Igne Natura Renovatur Integra , which translates to Fire renews Nature . 538 The Vesica Piscis is this fiery furnace of divine love and light. It is the flame vessel of the Fish . 539 The Visica Piscis has an obvious relationship to the female genitalia. It also suggests the old legends of the aquatic heritage of man, which we looked at from the perspective of genetics in Chapter 4 and will further investigate in Chapter 17. The alchemists also noted that in Hebrew each letter of I.N.R.I represents one of the four elements. 540 I is Iammim, Water. N is Nour, fire. R is Rouach, the air. I is Iebeschah, earth. Another major alchemical meaning is Igne nitrum raris invenitur , translated as Fire is discovered in nitrum . These many esoteric religious and alchemical meanings illustrate once more the seduction of hermetic drift . Occam ’ s Razor requires the simplest interpretation consistent with the facts. This is that Pontius Pilate insisted in the titular INRI to demonstrate the fate of future political and messianic leaders. The least complicated meaning of INRI is its traditional interpretation of Jesus Nazarene, King of the Jews . Rabbis generally believe Jesus to be the messianic hopeful Y'shua ha Meshiach, a Nozri who lived for many years among the Essenes, who was born in about 100BCE and died in 70BCE. 541 The Nazarenes believed Jesus was the son of Judas of Gamalas, a Jewish prophet and military commander.

A Ben Panthera of the first century was an auxiliary archer in the Roman infantry. His tombstone was at Bingerbr ü ck in Germany and is now at Bad Kreuznach. It is inscribed: 542 Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera of Sidon, aged 62, a soldier of 40 years' service, of the 1st cohort of archers, lies here. The legend in the Sepher Toldos Jeshu relates that Ben Panthera violated Mary (Mariam) the betrothed of John (Iohanan). 543 Mary conceived Y'shua, or Jesus ben Panthera. The child was an important person because he was the nephew of Queen Salome. 544 Iohanan deserted Mariam and her newborn child so his uncle, the Rabbi Jehosuah Ben Perachiah, adopted him. Rabbi Elhanan initiated Y'shua into the secret knowledge of the Kabbalah. According to the Talmudic authors of the Sota and the Sanhedrim, when King Janneus ordered the killing of all initiates, Jehosuah Ben Perachiah and the young Y'shua fled to Alexandria in Egypt. There a rich and learned woman received them. Y'shua found her beautiful, notwithstanding a defect in her eyes . This is a reference to Y'shua gaining the secret wisdom of Egypt. Y'shua declared his thoughts to Jehosuah Ben Perachiah who cursed him for following Egyptian ways and drove him away. Y'shua studied the Mysteries in Egypt for six years and the Egyptian priests consecrated him a High Pontiff of the Universal Secret Doctrine. 545 When King Janneus ’ persecution ended, they both Y'shua and Jehosuah Ben Perachiah returned to Palestine. Y'shua practiced magic, which is interpreted as preaching there as an Essene priest,. Due to his illegitimacy, Y'shua was driven from the Synagogue and he took refuge for a time in Galilee. The Rabbis wrote that Y'shua stole the Holy and Ineffable Name, the Schamhamphorash , from the cubic stone in the Temple ’ s Holy of Holies. It had been placed in the Holy of Holies by King David, who found it in the foundations of the Temple. Y'shua copied the characters on the cubical stone onto a piece of parchment and hid it in his thigh. This refers to Y'shua ’ s ritual laming, as we shall see below. Then Y'shua went abroad, disclosing the great mystery of the Temple to ordinary people and astounded people with his miracles: raising the dead and healing the leprous and the obsessed. The Sepher Toldos records the allegory that Y'shua was unable to displace the cubical stone of the sanctuary so Jesus fabricated one of clay, which he showed to the nations and passed off as the true cubical stone of Israel, leading led"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" 149 the people into idolatry. 546 In 70 BCE, forty days after his messianic proclamation, the Sanhedrin imprisoned Y'shua for forty days, flogged him for sedition, stoned him for blasphemy and crucified him. This was in Lud, Ludd, Lydd or Lydda, a town about 25 miles from Jerusalem. The Rabbis valued the law and always investigated their sources meticulously. They attributed great authority and antiquity to the Toledot Yeshu, also called the Sepher Toldos Jeschu. Ideas contained within this blasphemous tract can be traced to Celsus ’ second century CE attack on Christianity through Origen ’ s rebuttal in the middle of the third century CE. The Toledot Yeshu was only removed from the Talmud in 1520CE because of Christian indignation. Even then, the text was only replaced by circles and the story continued to be taught orally: 547 This is why we enjoin you, under pain of excommunication major, to print nothing in future editions, whether of the Mischna or of the Gemara, which relates whether for good or evil to the acts of Jesus the Nazarene, and to substitute instead a circle like this O, which will warn the Rabbis and schoolmasters to teach the young these passages only viva voce. By means of this precaution the savants amongst the Nazarenes will have no further pretext to attack us on this subject. The Talmud writes of Jesus Nazarene as both Jeshu-ha-Notzri and Balaam the Lame: 548 ... Commentators refer to Jeshu-ha-Notzri [i.e. Jesus] by mention of the wicked kingdom of Edom, since that was his nation. ... He was hanged on Passover Eve. ... He was near to the Kingdom [i.e. in order of succession]. Balaam the Lame [i.e. Jesus] was 33 years old when Pintias Robber [i.e. Pontius Pilate] killed him. ... They say that his mother was descended from princes and rulers, but consorted with carpenters. Jesus ’ royal lineage was important for his coronation as King of the Jews . His coronation used the ancient formula described in Psalms: 549 I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. The Jewish Nazarenes and Essenes considered this violently laming coronation essential in the creation of a Messiah. Through this"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" 150 ceremony, the priests physically crowned Jesus as king of the Houses of Judah, Benjamin and Levi . However, until his anointing at the completion of the coronation, Jesus was merely a man. The act of coronation conferred upon him the incarnate status of perfect man, Son of Man and the Second Person of the traditional Indo-Hittite male Trinity . 550 Thomas ’ Gospel defined Jesus ’ rights as those of a Messiah, mutually exclusive to both Caesar and God: 551 They showed Jesus a gold coin and said to Him, \"Caesar's men demand taxes from us.\" He said to them, \"Give Caesar what belongs to Caesar, give God what belongs to God, and give Me what is Mine.\" The unusual personal reception of Jesus, a non-Roman citizen, by Pontius Pilate confirms Jesus as more than just a local insurgent. The I.N.R.I titular placed on the cross by Pontius Pilate was not derisive but exactingly affirmative of his political status as a King and a dire warning to those that might follow. Yet, in the end, Jesus did not fulfill the prophecy of Ezekiel. He did not die by the sword as expected. Instead, he was crucified somewhat like his namesake predecessor Jesus ben Panthera. 552 For the Jewish Nazarenes, their Messiah Jesus had fallen short of millennium expectations. In contrast, the Greeks, led by Paul, saw not all was necessarily lost. 553 He was an initiate of the Mysteries and reverted to the ancient Afro-Asiatic definition of kingship in lieu of the Indo- Hittite. This meant that Paul defined Jesus as perfect from birth, rather than from his coronation. He was One with the Father , as in the Afro- Asiatic religion of the Mother Goddess. Jesus ’ death by crucifixion was a recognizable part of her age-old sacrificial king ritual. In crucifying Jesus, the Herodian Sadducees made a dreadful tactical error that has haunted them for two thousand years. Good King Josiah (640-609BCE) had prohibited crucifixion, declaring that it extinguished the soul. In undue haste to send Jesus ’ soul to oblivion, the Herodian Sadducees failed to recognize that crucifixion made Jesus ’ mode of death an Afro-Asiatic celebration of the sacrificial king ritual. Ironically, this was the very ritual Jesus sought to annul. Over the next forty years, the Romans ruthlessly purged Jewish nationalism. They nevertheless saw Paul ’ s intellectual version of Christianity as very close to their own Mysteries such as those of Mithras.

A combination of Pharisee Rabbinical law in Israel and international Pauline Christianity abroad became an expedient political solution to the Jewish Question. As we saw in Chapter 6, this situation had its roots in a failed coup in the Egyptian Delta over one thousand years before. Indeed, the holy unspeakable Name of God JHWH supported Paul ’ s Afro-Asiatic conclusion. 554 As we saw in Chapter 7, the First Person of the male Indo-Hittite Trinity is Light , meaning God, indicated by H . W meaning Peace represents the Second Person, Jesus, begotten by the Father before the entire world . The Third Person of the Trinity given by the letters JH is Light and Life , the formula for the Virgin and Son . The determination to identify Jesus with the Trinity, a heresy in itself to the Jews, had the unanticipated result of exploding into a plethora of Christian heresies. Some related to the righteous indignation that non- Jews had deified a man. Stubborn messianic zeal regrouped where it could. Cults of the Triple Goddess also adapted to the new paradigm and perpetuated the myth as a legitimate disguise for their practices. The Mysteries practiced around the known world looked on with condescension but mild support. The Gnostics subscribed neither to the theory that the Trinity is One , nor that Jesus was a myth. The Gnostics believed that Simon of Cyrene, the Traitor, died in place of Jesus. 555 They followed Basilides of Alexandria who taught that Simon Magus had written: 556 There is no resurrection of the flesh but that of the spirit only. And that the body of man is not the creation of God; and also concerning the world, that god did not create it, and that God knoweth not the world, and that Jesus Christ was not crucified but it was an appearance, and that he was not born of Mary, nor the seed of David. The Gnostics saw Simon of Cyrene as the Messenger of the God of Justice who sought to inflict a harsh and impossible law on man. In a curious anti-cosmic interpretation, they believed that Lucifer had Simon of Cyrene slain to protect men from oppression. This extraordinary interpretation will become clear in Chapter 15 when we look closely at the Gnostic Knight Rose Croix in his role with St George and the Dragon . The plethora of Christian heresies also included Virgin Worship called Hyperdulia , Marianity or Mariology . Despite the bloody efforts of both the Church and Puritans to eliminate it, Virgin Worship is still widely practiced today. 557 "},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" 152 Virgin Worship later became integral with Church theology. This was apparent at the coronation of Medici Pope Leo X. He paraded from the Vatican to the Church of the Lateran for the ceremony. The Florentine physician Gian-Giacomo Penni described how this grand procession passed through a magnificent new arch endowed by the banker Agostino Chigi. Priceless marble, alabaster and porphyry treasures of pagan Rome adorned it. On the approach to the arch, Pope Leo X read a message written in gold: 558 The time of Venus has passed: Gone, too, is Mars Now is the rule of Minerva. Immediately through the arch, Pope Leo X encountered a beautiful Greek statue of Aphrodite with the rest of the message in gold: Mars has gone and Minerva Reigns But Venus still our worship claims. Indeed, in 1964, the Roman Catholic Church finally succumbed to popular pressure for Virgin Worship . Pope Paul VI elevated the Virgin Mary to Mater Ecclesiae , the Mother of the Church . 559 From that moment, those of the Roman Catholic faith could only speak to God the Father through Mary the Redemptress . Perhaps the Medici Pope Leo X made the greatest Papal faux pas of all time when ebullient and jesting, he quipped to the Venetian scholar Pietro Bembo: 560 How very profitable this fable of Christ has been to us through the ages. We look at the survival of ancient Melchizedek traditions in Southern France in the next chapter."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":" 153 Chapter 11 Melchizedekians and Merovingians King Mel-chi-zedek the Jebusite is one of the most mysterious characters in all biblical myths. The Book of Genesis identifies him as a sacred Priest-King of Salem at the time it was in Hurrian or Amorite hands. The Hindu ’ s know him as Melik-Sadaksina, the great son of a Kassite king and magical priest of Brahm, who was Abraham ’ s teacher. 561 Another of Melchizedek ’ s names is Adoni-Zedek after the city god of Salem and King of Righteousness. 562 The Ammonites called him Zaduk. Melchizedek welcomed Abraham to Canaan after Abraham had returned from defeating Kedorla'omer: 563 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. He is a famous immortal: 564 Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life. Priests after the Order of Melchizedek are prominent over the millennia. One of the last Biblical references is when King David appoints Zadok as a joint high priest with the Levites. The final identification with Melchizedek occurs with Jesus. Among the many messianic aspirants of the time, Jesus was a particularly special messiah because he was a priest of Melchizedek. 565 The precise geographical location of Melchizedek's Salem is unknown. Biblical publishers readily assume Salem is the current Jerusalem because of the forthright deconstruction of Jerusalem into Jeru and Salem. 566 Josephus records that Salem became Jerusalem after the time of Abraham. 567 As we saw in Chapter 3, Jerusalem was the city of Salma the Son of Light . It therefore seems logical that Salem would have been a sanctuary town similar to Harran in the North and perhaps Ma'rib in the South. Certainly, Abraham had a compellingly similar relationship of familiarity, sanctuary and tribute to both Harran and Salem. The Teacher of Righteousness or Moreh-zedek of the Dead Sea Scrolls seems to be very much like Mel-chi-zedek. 568 Moreh and Moriah are the places of Yahweh's Covenant with Abraham. The Hebrew word Marah means salt sea . 569 Therefore, Mor-Iah and Mor-Jah translate to God of the Sea or God of the Salt Water . From this same root, Moreh- zedek translates as the Water of Righteousness or Dew of Righteousness ."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" 154 In the Damascus Document, known since at least the ninth century, the Qumran Covenanters swallowed the Teacher of Righteousness . He brings them a new Covenant with God. John Allegro first recognized the importance of swallowing (from teval c a ) in 1970. 570 He related the names Jesus and Joshua to dew and the semen that heals and saves. Swallowing is important in the Habakkuk Pesher (XI 4-5). The Wicked Priest pursues the Righteous Teacher to swallow him. Swallowing is again mentioned in connection with Wisdom in Aaron A – 4Q541 (2.8): 571 Behold a wise man will understand that I am seeing and comprehending deep Mysteries, thus I am speaking ... . parables. The Greek will not understand, But the knowledge of Wisdom will come to you, for you have received ... you will acquire Pursue her (Wisdom) and seek her and gain possession of her to swallow (her) down. Behold you will gladden many ... many (will have) a place. A most important function of the Melchizedek priests at the time of the Exodus was to set out the Bread of the Presence of God on a golden table in front of the Ark of the Covenant, also called the Ark of Alliance. Moses decreed that the Ark should contain a quantity of the Bread of Heaven or manna found by the Israelites in the wilderness so future generations would see what it was like. 572 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your generations. As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. Somewhat oddly, Moses commanded a renowned goldsmith and architect called Bezaleel to prepare the Bread of the Presence of God . Indeed, Bezaleel was the same goldsmith Moses had commissioned to create the Ark of the Covenant. Coincidently, the renowned architect of King Solomon ’ s Temple, Hiram Abiff, was not an architect in Biblical texts. 573 He was an expert artisan working in gold, brass and dyes."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" 155 Bezaleel and Hiram Abiff are also similar archetypes in other ways. Bezaleel ’ s father is Uri , which means Light . This makes Bezaleel a Son of Light . Hiram ’ s mother was a Naphtali woman from Dan. This probably identifies her as an Oracle or Priestess of the Benjamites. The Bible is more evasive with Hiram ’ s father, only commenting that he was also a master artisan. Josephus gives us the information we expect, that Hiram ’ s father came from Ur of the Israelites . 574 He confirms that Bezaleel and Hiram Abiff are precisely the same archetype, embodying an important story. In fact, Jesus ’ father Joseph is the same archetype. He is not simply a carpenter but an artisan in the archetypal sense. Bezaleel also bears a remarkable similarity to Azazel ( ‘ Az â zil in Arabic) or Shemyaza , the leader of the fallen Watchers in the Judaic- Christian apocryphal Book of Enoch. 575 Just as Prometheus presented man with fire, Azazel released to humankind the secrets of metallurgy, the manufacture of weapons and jewelry, and the use of antimony in art and medicine. He also taught women the art of cosmetics, to be promiscuous and to enjoy sex. For these transgressions, God condemned Azazel to remain forever bound in the desert of D û d âê l. As Shemyaza , he hangs upside down between heaven and earth in the constellation of Orion. The only known statute of this leader of the Watchers is in the choir of Rosslyn Chapel, in Scotland. There seems to be a distinctly alchemical key in the Qumran and Biblical documents. For example, the duality of the mysterious Sceptre and the Star is analogous to the red man of gold and his wife , the star of antimony . They correspond to the coronation ’ s Scepter of gold and Orb of antimony. Furthermore, they are comparable to the Messiah of Aaron and Israel . It is not surprising that the Covenanters had a metallurgical foundry with twenty-six tons of gold and forty-eight tons of silver at Qumran. Using the philosophical circular-saw of Occam's Razor to limit the entities, the Moreh-zedek or the Teacher of Righteousness can be seen as a common alchemical archetype with the dew or Bread of Life. In the same way Melchizedek, the King of Righteousness , is an archetype for the priest that manufactures the sacred bread. He provides this sacred bread to Abraham in a rite of kingship. A statue in the North Porch of Chartres Cathedral shows Melchizedek holding a long-stemmed chalice or cup in his left hand. It contains a solid cylindrical object that is the Moreh-zedek . Many think it is the Holy Grail or Philosophers' Stone. 576 The stained glass window on"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" 156 the North Fa ç ade shows Melchizedek again. An inside window of Paris ’ Notre Dame Cathedral also shows alchemy in action. 577 The blessing of Abraham with holy bread and wine at Salem suggests Salem was a special alchemical or metallurgy site from early times. The Palestine campaign of Thutmose III indeed confirmed this in 1480BCE. Jerusalem, or Salem, was Kadesh or the Holy City and seen as the most important city in Palestine long before King David made Jerusalem his capital. Chapter 9 described the ascendancy of the Pharisees over the Melchizedekian Sadducees. This was a major change in the power structure of religion in Israel. It marginalized the Melchizedek Priests, who retired to the wilderness. The ever-vigilant Pharisees recorded in Talmud that the heretical Melchizedekians continued to frequent Hebron to visit Abraham ’ s cave of Machpelah. 578 The contents of the cave have remained a mystery for eight hundred years. 579 The mosque that now conceals it admits neither Jews nor Christians. Benjamin of Tudela visited the cave in 1163CE and wrote that its innermost reaches contained six sepulchers. Josephus noted that these were of the finest marble. Perhaps a rabbinical tradition that formed part of an old lecture in the Masonic Degree of Knight Rose Croix holds the key. It described how Abraham discovered the sepulcher of Adam and Eve in a cave of the Jebusites. 580 They were lying on couches with lamps burning before them, which spread a rich perfume. The Melchizedek traditions along with those of the Calebite Dog Men were some of the very few to remain fresh with the remnant that evaded the Exile in Babylon. 581 In about 750BCE Amos prophesized the return from Exile with the Lord ’ s words: 582 In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old: That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, saith the Lord that doeth this. The Damascus Document then tells us that God: 583 Left a remnant to Israel, and did not give them over to destruction. But in the Time of Wrath He visited them (three hundred and ninety years after He had given them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon). And He caused to spring forth from Israel and Aaron a root of His planting to inherit the land."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":" 157 However, in response to the fanatical uprising of Zealot nationalism, the Romans systematically eliminated militant nationalistic groups, such as the Zealots, from Jerusalem and surrounding strongholds. Josephus records that over 1,350,000 people died at this time. The resilient Zaddoki and Essene cultures survived in Damascus, Alexandria and in other regions of the Diaspora. After 200BCE, the Jewish Diaspora accelerated with the decline of Hellenistic Egypt and Syria. Jews migrated to Italy and to Spain via North Africa. One of the far-flung lands of the dispersion was Gaul. In about 12CE the Romans exiled the brother of Herod Antipas, Archelaus, Tetrarch of Galilee and Perea. He settled in the Jewish district at Vienne, near Lyons, in France. 584 Some twenty-eight years later Herod Antipas joined him in exile as punishment for beheading John the Baptist. Jewish migration continued to Lyon, Arles and Bordeaux, culminating between five hundred CE and six hundred CE with a mass Diaspora movement to Marseilles and Barcelona. The Zaddoki-Melchizedek line enjoyed great prominence in the Diaspora of Gaul, especially with the Merovingian Frank Kings who defeated the Visigoths at Vouill é , near Aquitaine, in 510CE. The Visigoth territories in Gascony, Languedoc and Provence and in Northern Spain provided fertile ground for both Zadok-Melchizedek and Rabbinical-Cabbalistic streams of Judaism. The French Merovingian Royalty maintained that it was of a royal Trojan lineage that antedated the Roman Catholic Church. They rejected Church sponsored coronation. They also claimed to derive from the tribe of Judah through Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. The Merovingian kings placed great value on their long hair and believed that it gave them strength. 585 Samson ’ s name was common in the Royal Merovingian Household. The longhaired Monarchs identified with him as the hero Judge of the Tribe of Dan. 586 The Merovingians buried their last ruler, Dagobert II, in a cape studded with golden honey bees. Napoleon removed the honeybees from Dagobert's tomb and placed them on his own coronation cape. Displaying the same independence from Papal authority that characterized the Merovingians, Napoleon lifted the crown from the Bishop's hands and placed it upon his own head.

Eight years later Pepin III himself faced military defeat at the hands of the Islamic Saracens at Narbonne. The Jewish population came to his aid and opened the gates of Narbonne for his protection in return for Pepin III undertaking to elevate their principate city-state of Septimania to the status of an independent Davidic Princedom. Pepin III complied for reasons that seem to include the creation of a buffer state to keep the Umayyad Saracens at bay. 587 The granting of ancient privileges, high office, freehold land, the Jews ’ own system of law and royal protection to the Jews of Southern France invoked a bitter rebuke from Pope Stephen III in 768CE. 588 The grant of hereditary freehold tenure of land called allodial hereditamenta was particularly controversial. 589 It was contrary to both Papal and Carolingian policy. The Septimanian Jews established Davidic succession in their Princedom. The Nasi , or Jewish Prince in perpetuity, was to be descended from the line of David. 590 The first Nasi was Rabbi Natronai- Makhir. He was formerly the Exilarch of the Jews in Baghdad and a scholar-prince of the House of David , who the Caliph of Baghdad sent to Septimania. 591 Natronai-Makhir accepted the name Theodoric and took Pepin III ’ s sister, Alda, for a wife. 592 In return for the elevation of Septimania to a Princedom, the Rabbis endorsed Pepin III's own claim to Davidic Succession of the Holy Roman Empire for his son Charlemagne. Charlemagne later confirmed the status of Septimania in 791CE by establishing it as a permanent State. 593 The Princedom had grown in power and influence with the campaigns of Natronai-Makhir ’ s son, the great Guilhelm de Toulouse de Gellone, or William of Toulouse, into Spain. At this time, the Princedom encompassed a vast area from the Rhone to the Alb è res of the Pyrenees, including Nimes and Roussillon, and the Catalan counties in the March of Spain . These Catalan counties were Gerona, Vich (Ausona), Urgel, Pallars, Ribagorza and Barcelona. 594 Natronai-Makhir died in 793CE. His son Guilhelm de Toulouse succeeded him. In turn, Guilhelm ’ s son Bernard of Septimania became Prince. 595 Septimania then became a Jewish Kingdom, rather than the Princedom, which thrived until the end of Carolingian rule. The seed of David was to multiply in Southern France and produce one of its most famous sons, Godefroi de Bouillon. Godefroi ’ s admirers elevated him to a hall of fame called the nine nobles.

In Crathes Castle, between Balmoral and Aberdeen in Scotland, the 1602 owner asks (see Appendix 12): Gude reder tell me or thou pass Whilk of thir nyn maist Valliant was? The nine nobles theme was popular amongst surviving Knights Templar groups in Scotland. A number of castles depict the same theme in their ceilings, including at Glamis in the Vale of Strathmore. The theme derives from the beliefs of the Ishmaelite Assassins and the Druses, the old followers of Tammuz. 596 The Druses are not orthodox Mohammedans. Their heretical belief is that God constantly reincarnated in a series of semi-divine prophets and warrior-kings, called Imam, and of whom Christ was one but Mahomed was not. Only seventy reincarnations occurred. The Druses believe that final reincarnation was Hakim, the sixth Fatimate Caliph, after whom there can be no others. In his second coming, Hakim, the Druze Messiah, will conquer the world. The Assassins ’ beliefs were similar except that the Assassins considered their founder, Hassan, the Shiek-al-Jabul or Old Man of the Mountain in Lebanon , to be one of the reincarnations. In Chapter 12 and Chapter 17, we will see the importance of Mount Hermon in Lebanon. It is worth adding that at Crathes, the room of the nine nobles leads directly into the Green Lady ’ s room where the first image on the painted ceiling is that of the Triple Goddess. The floor of this room contained a skeleton and this led to legends that the ghost of girl carrying a baby haunts the room. At Glamis, a Grey Lady haunts the strikingly unconventional chapel, which has a magnificent window of St George and the Dragon. On his father's side, Godefroi descended from the Merovingians and on that of his mother and grandmother, the Carolingian. His Carolingian grandparents bequeathed Godefroi the title of Duke of Lower Lorraine. Storming the wall of Jerusalem on 15 July 1099, Godefroi de Bouillon was to shout the famous phrase expressing the Zaddoki belief that they were the only legitimate High Priests of Jerusalem Deus Meumque Jus, meaning God and my Right. 597 The thirty-third degree of the Scottish Rite adopted Godefroi ’ s motto. A gold ring worn by each member of the degree has the motto engraved within it. 598 It is also the Latin version of the motto of the royal arms of England Dieu et mon droit , adopted by Richard I the Lionheart at the siege of Gisors in 1198."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" 161 Following Godefroi de Bouillon ’ s successful assault on the walls of Jerusalem, he assumed the title of Guardian of the Holy Sepulcher . This title was Godefroi's preference over King, an uncharacteristically modest choice, continuing the tradition that there should be no king of Israel until the second coming of the Messiah. His brother Baldwin of Lorraine had no such inhibition. One year later, he became King Baldwin I of Jerusalem. Oddly, the circumstances surrounding the death of the glorious Godefroi de Bouillon remain a mystery to this day. Hugh of Champagne and his vassal Hugues des Payens explored Jerusalem in 1104 and in 1114. The second visit generated considerable excitement. Thirty-three members of the Fontaine family of St Bernard promptly joined the Cistercian Order. Hugh of Champagne donated land to the Order for the Abbey of Clairvaux with similar enthusiasm. His prot é g é St Bernard became Abbot of Clairvaux at the remarkable age of twenty-five years. St Bernard ’ s father Tescelin belonged to the family of Chevalier de Ch â tillion, who held feudal lordships in Burgundy and Champagne. 599 His mother Aleth was of the house of the Dukes of Burgundy. Having successfully infiltrated the Church and established a comfortable niche as Cistercians, the Melchizedek houses of Champagne, Anjou, Gisors and Flanders arranged for nine knights to journey to Jerusalem in 1118. The knights chose St John as their protector and called their Temple lodgings St John ’ s Hostel . They excavated the Temple ’ s foundations under the patronage of King Baldwin II, a cousin of Baldwin I. Hugh of Champagne joined the excavations in 1124CE. The Church had thought it was welcoming the troublesome Zaddoki-Melchizedek houses of France into the fold of Pauline Christianity, just as the Celtic Church successfully enjoined in 625CE. Instead, it had drawn fundamentalist, unshakeable heresy to its bosom. The Melchizedek houses of France regarded the unusual treasure beneath the Temple as their personal property. They set about recovering it for their own purposes, as we shall see in Chapter 18. The next chapter focuses on the tribe of Dan and its connection with the Melchizedekians and Rosicrucians."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" 162 Chapter 12 The Tribe of Dan In his desire to divorce Catherine of Aragon and remarry, Henry VIII lobbied the Pope on grounds of whether a man could marry his brother's widow. To strengthen his case, Henry sent the secret agent Richard Croke to Venice in 1529 to consult with the Jewish Rabbis and a Christian Cabalist theologian called Georgi. 600 The Pope declined so Henry VIII wrenched the English Church from him and declared himself both the supreme political and spiritual leader of England. In the ensuing cold war with the Vatican, the English monarch sought to justify his break from Catholicism by claiming a legitimate Davidic spiritual destiny to uphold Christianity by divine right – known as British Imperial Christianity. Geoffrey of Monmouth had written that the kings of Britain were descended from the Trojan Brutus. 601 The Tudors glorified Brutus ’ descendant King Arthur as the epitome of British Imperial Christianity ’ s kings who rule by divine right. John Dee was the son of one of Henry VIII's court officials. Dee believed that he too was descended from the ancient kings of Britain. He believed that he was a distant cousin of Queen Elizabeth I and it is true that the Queen seemed indulge him, keeping him near as her personal astrologer. John Dee wove together the threads of British Imperial Christianity from Trojan and Arthurian legends and the Hebrew Kabbalah into the Elizabethan Rosicrucianism. The real imperative in Elizabeth I ’ s time was to counter the forces of Catholicism and finance the defense of Britain through Amsterdam ’ s Jewish merchants and bankers. In 1290, Edward I had expelled the Jews from England. To reunite the English in a common identity with the Jews, Dee renewed the old legends of Britain ’ s Davidic heritage. The first record we have of this new British-Israelite identity is from John Sadler in 1649. In his book, Rights to the Kingdom , John Sadler proposed that the English descended from Israel's ten lost tribes. Sir Francis Bacon continued John Dee ’ s Rosicrucianism. He discussed a new British-Jewish alliance in his book titled New Atlantis . It was influential in having the Jews readmitted to Britain in 1664. The Welsh Triads are among the earliest of all British records that relate to the origins of the Celtic peoples. Although imperfect due to a"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" 163 mixture of history and tradition, these writings give us much intelligence respecting the aborigines of Britain. Eminent scholars support the authenticity of these Triads. However, we need to move to Ireland for much of Britain ’ s sacred history. Ireland preserved ethnic legends due to an absence of foreign invasions over many centuries, the continuity of tribal government and the existence of a special class of sages, the Druids, whose duty it was to maintain genealogies and keep alive the deeds of their ancestors. Their ethnic legends are wonderfully colorful and broadly consistent with western religion and archeology. The Book of Invasions , or Lebar Gabhala tells of the arrival of the five principal peoples: Partholan, Nemed, the Firbolgs, the Tuatha-De- Danaan, perhaps the lost tribe of Dan, and the Scots or Milesians. In Genesis, Jacob foretold what would befall each of the tribes. Of Dan, he said: 602 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days ... Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward. I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord. The Tribe of Dan became lost to the Torah, along with that of Dan ’ s female twin, Dinah. 603 Scholars characterize them as lost because the Book of Chronicles omits to record their descendants. 604 Scholars normally mean the ten lost tribes when they refer to ten tribes that the Assyrians dissipated in 721-718BCE. Judah was never lost. The other tribe that was never lost was Dan. After Genesis, the Torah simply excluded Dan. The tribe of Dan originally entered the promised land of Israel in the time of Joshua. They occupied a strip of coast country on the Mediterranean, west of Jerusalem. From the beginning of their settlement, they seemed to have played no major part in the internal affairs of the new nation, but preferred to engage in shipping and international commerce. The Bible says they were principally seamen: 605 Dan abode in ships. Deborah complained that the people of Dan preferred to remain with their ships, rather than taking to the field of battle in order to assist the other Israelites in the defeat of their enemies."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" 164 Dan, Asher and Naphtali began to participate with the maritime enterprise of the Canaanite Phoenicians and it seems likely that inter- marriage took place. Their ships of Tarshish (ancient Spain) created the Golden Age of Phoenicia: 606 For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart. An entire chapter of the Bible lists the trading enterprises of the Phoenicians and the numerous nations that shared in this commerce. 607 The Tribe of Dan expanded its territories by invading the north of Israel, just above the Lake of Galilee: 608 The Danites took Kirjath-jearim, and called that place Mahanehdan unto this day. Six hundred Danites then took Laish: 609 And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father. One can still visit the ancient city of Dan (or Layish) city in Tel Dan Park, near Kiryat Shemona. The city contains the world's oldest known arch. The northern city of Dan or Mizvar Dan (Fort of Dan) was a Canaanite sanctuary for the worship of Baal-Hermon. 610 The Greeks called it Paneas because of the cavern where they worshiped the god Pan. 611 Pan was their universal god and his name meant All Things because he represented fertility. The meaning of Jor-dan is the going down of the Dan and the Greeks thought the Jordan River rose in the grotto of Pan. 612 Biblical authors dropped tribe of Dan because the tribe became pagans. They inherited the tradition of pre-flood Canaanite Baal worship from the descendants of Canaan who occupied the northern area of Palestine at Mount Hermon. Canaan was the Phoenician hero Chnas. 613 The Danites captured the sacred idols of Micah including a silver phallus that Micah set up in his house: 614 And the children of Dan set up for themselves the graven image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and his"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" 165 sons were priests to the Tribe of Dan until the captivity of the land. These lines mean that for generations Moses' own grandson Jonathan and his descendants acted as priests of idol-worship in Israel. Jerome wrote of the Book of Enoch: 615 We have read in a certain apocryphal book that when the sons of God were coming down to the daughters of men, they descended into Ardos, which is the summit Mount Hermon. For those interested in UFO theories, Mount Hermon is where it all happened. Ancient legends attribute a sacred character to Mount Hermon. 616 It was supposedly the residence of the children of Seth at the beginning of human existence. 617 The Valentinians regarded these sons of Seth as Sons of God who led a pious and secluded life on Mount Hermon, musing about paradise. 618 Hermon is also the mountain of God, called Bashan: 619 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan. Why leap ye, ye high hills? This is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the Lord will dwell in forever. Modern surveys have located more than twenty temples on Mount Hermon, an unprecedented number in comparison with other regions of the Phoenician coast. 620 The Mount abounds with shrines to the Canaanite goddess Asherah or Astarte. 621 This led the Church father Jerome to write that Hermon was an anathema, by which he meant a forbidden place. 622 The name Hermon derives from the Laconian dialect for stone heap. 623 Hermon is He of the stone heap . Archeologists discovered such a heap of hewn stone within the ruins of a circular wall on one of the three secondary peaks. In fact, all monumental walls and buildings built of ashlars, or cut stones, represent Hermon. He is also equivalent to Hermes, or Thoth-Hermes, the biblical Ham. Pan or Mercury was Hermes ’ son. The Druids formed circles from monoliths and piles of stones on top of hills or mounds. They called these circles Si'un (Sions or Zions) or Caers. During their rituals, the Chief Druid stood in the center of the circle at the large, central Stone of the Covenant. The Irish called the central stone Bethel, meaning the house of God . Each May-eve and first of November the Druids built great fires on these Sions so the people all around could see the flames. 624 The same may be true of the many folly- towers in England."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" 166 The Bible does not state that David's throne will always be located at Jerusalem; it may be at Mount Hermon. In 1868 the founder of the Eastern Star, Robert Morris, wrote: 625 ... my eyes can scarcely withdraw themselves from Hermon soaring on my right hand. The expression in Isaiah v.26 occurs to me with added meaning. The Great Illumer describes Jehovah seated yonder on that lookout, from which all Palestine is clearly spread before the eye. The standard of the Tribe of Dan is very interesting. Jacob compared Dan to a serpent and the serpent became the tribe ’ s totem. However, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai, the Captain of the tribe of Dan whose initials are AA , shrank from carrying the serpent on his flag. 626 Dan ’ s standard became a white and red banner with the crest of a two-headed bird bearing a serpent in its talons. 627 This mysterious two- headed bird is often mistaken for an eagle. It is really the phoenix, which signifies the immortality of the Priests of Order of Melchizedek. 628 This Order has as its object the permanent and hereditary duty to worship the Most High God El Elyon, Yaho or Yahweh. 629 Many examples of early Danish and Irish jewelry show this Danite tribal symbol of an eagle bearing a serpent. We turn to the legends one of the earliest Diasporas to Ireland. In 2069BCE, Partholan and a band of Israelite warriors arrived from the Greek world, overcoming the aboriginal forest tribes called the Tuatha Feda. 630 This was probably the arrival of the early Bronze Age Picts, a branch of the Goidelic Celts. They settled at Inis Saimer, a small island in the River Erne, at Ballyshannon. Most of the colony died of plague after fifty years. Their graves are at Tallaght near Dublin. Those who did not die from plague fled. In 1739BCE, three hundred and thirty years after Partholan ’ s arrival, Nemed arrived from Scythia with thirty ships, each carrying thirty warriors. The Chronicles of the Kings of Briton tells the same story. They record that a chieftain called Barthlome arrived in Ireland from Spain with thirty ships. Barthlome told the English king Gwrgant that his party had originally come from Israel. The Domestic Annals of Ireland record that Nemed ’ s Irish name was Nin Mac Piel , meaning Ninus or Nimrod. Nimrod was the legendary"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" 167 son of Bel or Belus, who is the Baal, Bel, or Belial of the Old Testament. 631 Nemed laid claim to Irish soil but he also died from plague at a mountain called Ard Nemeid, at Queenstown in Cork Harbour. About two hundred and seventeen years after Nemed, the Phoenician Formorians invaded Ireland. 632 Just as Nemed ’ s people started to repel these Formorians, another leader called Morc arrived from Africa with sixty ships and occupied the country. Only one ship with thirty survivors escaped to Grecian Thrace. Among them were three of Nemed ’ s descendants. The next wave migrants were the Firbolgs, who are through to be British. Their five chiefs landed at different sites, subdued the whole country and ruled it from Leinster. Then in 1456BCE, about thirty-six years after the Firbolgs, the tribe of Dan arrived in ships, drove out other inhabitants and settled the land. This was the lost tribe of Dan. The Irish call them the Tuatha-De- Danaan or children of the Goddess Danu. They symbolized her with the moon. The Tuatha-De-Danaan defeated the Firbolg ’ s king Eochaid Mac Erca and drove his people from the country. Thirty years later, they also defeated the Formorians in a great battle. Nemedian legend says the Tuatha-De-Danaan were Nemed ’ s descendents triumphantly returning from Greece led by Ibath, grandson of the prophet Iarbonel, and great grandson of Nemed. The Irish legends consider the Tuatha-De-Danaan demi-gods and teachers of wisdom. They possessed a grail-like vessel and founded the Druidic priesthood. 633 Sometimes the Tuatha-De-Danaan appears as Tuatha De, meaning the people of God . The Psalter of Cashel records that: 634 The Tuatha-De-Danaan ruled in Ireland for about two centuries, and were highly skilled in architecture and other arts from their long residence in Greece. These Tuatha-De-Danaan were Danite-Phoenician seamen from the coast at Joppa who struck out in their ships and sailed west through the Mediterranean to Ireland. From 1100BCE to 800BCE, the Phoenicians monopolized the sea trade routes in the Mediterranean area and beyond. They settled the coasts of North Africa, Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, Spain and Britain.

The Tribe of Dan named a great many places along the shores of the Mediterranean, Ireland and Britain after their patriarch Dan. In Ireland, they left names such as Dans-Laugh, Dan-Sower, Dundalk, Dun- drum, Donegal Bay, Donegal City, Dungloe, Din-gle and Dunsmor, which means more Dans . In Scotland, we find similar names such as Dundee and Dunraven. Linguists have long been aware of a great similarity between Hebrew, Phoenician and the early Irish Celtic language. The name Dunn in the Irish language means judge, the same meaning as Dan in Hebrew. This is important because Jacob said that Dan would judge Israel and the Book of Judges is the history of the tribe of Dan. Samson was a Nazarite of the tribe of Dan. He judged Israel during the period of Philistine domination. In Paradise Lost , Milton describes Samson as the Danite strong . The Mediterranean coast settlers became independent of the parent Phoenician cities of Tyre and Sidon in Phoenicia (Lebanon) and founded the Carthaginian Empire. These Carthaginians demonstrate the Phoenicians' colonizing urge. A Greek historian, Heroticus, recorded Himilco the Carthaginian ’ s claim that in 500-480BCE the Carthaginians transported thirty thousand men and women in sixty ships on a colonizing venture beyond the Pillars of Hercules. According to the Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland , King David of Israel invaded Ireland to relieve the pressure from a drought in 1016BCE, near the end of his reign. His invasion of Ireland was successful and imposed a new line of Judah Royalty on the Tuatha de Danaan. The Irish hypothesis is that King David himself established his throne in Ireland where the Irish knew him as Ollamh Fodhla . Irish writers have not been able to identify the nationality of this most famous king of early Ireland but were aware that he had not been born in Ireland. Ollamh Fodhla means chief poet, as was David and Taliesin. The Chronicles of Eri say that the Olam (prophets) brought him up and that all eyes delighted to look upon him and that all ears were charmed with the sound of his voice. 635 This mysterious and wise king also reigned at the very same time as King David, and for forty years, the exact same length of time that David reigned in Israel. David reigned from 1056-1016BCE whereas the"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" 169 Irish histories record that Ollamh Fodlah reigned from about 1052-1012 BCE. According to Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland , Ollamh Fodhla was also a great warrior-king. He besieged the city of Tara and killed the king. Ultimately, Gede ’ s son, Ariel (Irial in Irish) ruled from Tara. Interestingly, three miles north of Tara Hill is an Irish town named Dowd's Town, meaning David's Town or Settlement of David. The local Irish maintain that Tara Hill is sacred as the burial place of a famous Hebrew Princess called Tea-Tephi, of whom we shall have more to say shortly. Like King David, the Irish recognized Ollamh Fodhla as a great sage and wise legislator. The Annals of Clonmacnoise record that the town of Ulster (Ulladh) took its name from Ollamh Fodhla and describes him as soe well learned and soe much given to the favour of learning . Ollamh Fodhla established a famous school of learning at Tara, which may be the Irish form of Torah. 636 He also established the Feast of Tara . This autumn festival lasted seven days and was very similar to the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles . The Irish also knew Ollamh Fodhla as a Cohawyn or a Cohen. Ollamh Fodhla organized the nation for efficiency. His governmental body consisted of the king for administration, the priests as the judicial branch, and the representatives from the common people as the Congress, or legislative branch. Thus, the separated powers of the three branches of modern democratic government hark back to Ollamh Fodhla . God honored good king Ollamh Fodhla when his sons: ... succeeded him one after another as kings of this land without any other coming between them, which good never happened to no other before him. Conservative scholars suggest that Ireland is too far away from the Middle East for David to have traveled there. However, the romantics are certain that David visited this remote outpost of the empire, where Israelite peoples had settled in the days since the Exodus and which was close to Cornwall, as part of his tin trade. The Assyrian empire was at its peak in 718BCE and its armies threatened all nations on the eastern Mediterranean seaboard. These Assyrians were a brutal, fearsome people who plundered everything of value. Their wall murals, some of which are in the British Museum, depict scenes of horrible savagery and torture. One shows the Assyrians"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" 170 skinning men alive and impaling piles of men on poles outside the gates of a city. The Danites and Tyrian Phoenicians each contributed ships and men to two great trading fleets. 637 The coastal colony of seafaring Danites used their fleet to escape persecution by fleeing to Ireland. The armies of Jabin, king of Canaan, and a large Syrian fleet engaged the Athenian territories in daily battles. When the Syrians vanquished the Greeks, the tribe of Dan that dwelt in Greece at the time fled to up the ancient amber route to Lochlinn, which is Scandinavia. The legends of Scandinavia mention that the inhabitants of Scandinavia welcomed the people of the Tribe of Dan because of their many sciences and arts. Danmark, which we now call Denmark, took its name from this contingent of the tribe of Dan. The Danes elevated Dan to the father of the most famous of the Norse gods, Odin, and said that Dan was the one from whom the pedigrees of our kings flowed in glorious series, like channels from some parent spring . We now return to Israel in the time of Babylon ’ s King Nebuchadnezzar. He conquered Judea but allowed the Davidic King Zedekiah to live. In 586BCE, Zedekiah rebelled and Babylon returned to crush Judea. Nebuchadnezzar captured the royal family, executed Zedekiah ’ s Sons and blinded Zedekiah. However, Nebuchadnezzar failed to realize that King Zedekiah ’ s daughters inherited the connection with the land under the ancient Israelite custom of ultimo-geniture. At first Nebuchadnezzar imprisoned the prophet Jeremiah but gave him food, cloths and money, and released him to travel anywhere he wished. 638 Jeremiah escorted his nieces, King Zedekiah ’ s daughters, to Mizpah, which is Fort Dan. Jeremiah found no peace in Mizpah. The Ammonites captured and carried away everyone including King Zedekiah daughters. 639 The glorious Captain of Dan ’ s Guard, Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai, raised a small army and drove off the Ammonites. He released Jeremiah and the daughters. Jeremiah, together with his secretary Simon Brach, Zedekiah ’ s daughters and a small remnant of Dan escaped to Ireland. This was fulfillment of the prophecy that Zedekiah ’ s daughters would take root downward and bear fruit upward, that is to settle somewhere and have children. 640 "},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":" 171 Jeremiah took Zedekiah ’ s daughters and, it is said, the Israelites ’ coronation stone to Spain and thence to Ireland. In Spain, one of Zedekiah ’ s daughters married into the Spanish royal family of Zaragossa. Jeremiah arrived in Ireland in 569BCE as an elderly, white-haired patriarch. The Irish histories sometimes call him a saint. With Jeremiah was the Zedakiah ’ s young daughter Tea-Tephi or Tephi for short. In 1301CE the Scots pleaded a case to the Pope in which they referred to legends of Tephi as Scota, the daughter of an Egyptian Pharaoh and wife of a Scythian nobleman who was among the Egyptians that pursued the Israelites to the Red Sea. As mentioned in Chapter 6, the legend of Scota ’ s flight seems to have come through Eusebius in 320CE. Eusebius knowledge was in turn based on that of Euhemerus, a Greek historian that visited Manetho in Egypt in 300BCE. 641 From comparison of Pharaohs ’ names, it appears the relavent Pharaoh is the controversial monotheist Akhenaten. Scota may be the princess Meritaten, his second daughter by Nefertiti. We mentioned Tea-Tephi, the princess buried at Tara Hill in Ireland, earlier in the chapter. She is the same archetype as an earlier Tea, a daughter of Ith, who lived in the days of David. Similarly, Eochaide Herremon seems to be the same as Gede the Herremon of David's day who married his cousin, Tea. Jeremiah ’ s royal party included Eochaide, the son of the king of Ireland. Legend says he was in Jerusalem at the time of the siege where he had become acquainted with Tea-Tephi. Eochaide married Tea-Tephi at Tara, shortly after 585BCE when the city fell. Eochaide was a descendent of Zarah ’ s family while Tea Tephi was of Judah ’ s Pharez line. David himself was descended from this Pharez line of Jewish kings. 642 The Irish believe Jeremiah died in Ireland and lies buried near the ruins of Devenish Abbey, on Devenish Isle in Lower Loch Erne, near Enniskillen, County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland. Tea Tephi gave Eochaide the prestige of a Davidic title. Succeeding his father, Eochaide became High King of Ireland with the title Herremon. Eochaide and Tea-Tephi ’ s 12-year-old son accompanied them to Ireland. He succeeded Eochaide on the throne of Ireland and the dynasty continued unbroken through all the kings of Ireland. Simon Brach, Jeremiah's scribe or secretary, also traveled to Ireland with Jeremiah ’ s group. Various writers give Brach ’ s surname as"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" 172 Breck, Berech, Brach, Brec or Berach. He seems to merit special importance as the person who originally set down Jeremiah ’ s story. One legend says he was son of the Spanish King and a descendant of the Pharaoh ’ s daughter, Scota. Jeremiah reputedly brought other remarkable things to Ireland including a harp, an ark, and a wonderful stone called lia-fail , or the Stone of Destiny. The Israelites crowned their kings either standing upon or next to such a pillar of stone. 643 Many European countries such as Sweden and Denmark also crowned their kings on a coronation stone or within a circle of twelve stones. King James I of England expanded his Royal Standard to include Ireland ’ s harp of Tara. He also combined the flags of England, Ireland and Scotland to become the Union Jack. King James VI of Scotland ascended to the English throne as King James I on the death of his cousin, Queen Elizabeth I in 1603. The British struck a gold sovereign (called a unite ) to celebrate the United Kingdom of England, Ireland and Scotland. The Latin motto on the reverse side of the sovereign reads Faciam eos in gentem unam , or I will make of them one people . This is a quote from Ezekiel, where God spoke of uniting the lost tribes of Israel under the throne of David. 644 The British also struck a special medal to commemorate Queen Elizabeth II ’ s coronation on 2 June 1953. It depicts the arrival of the throne at the British Isles. The English kept this Coronation Stone, Stone of Scone, or Stone of Destiny, in the base of the coronation chair in Westminster Abbey. The official Westminster Abbey guide labels the Coronation Stone as Jacob's pillar-stone. Jacob laid his head on this Stone when he had the famous dream of a ladder reaching to Heaven. 645 The Coronation Stone, which is a six hundred and seventy millimeter long block of dull reddish sandstone weighing 152 kg, may come from near the Dead Sea where such sandstone exists in Petra, Edom. However, the Dead Sea is one hundred miles from the white limestone at Bethel, where Jacob had his dream. This type of reddish sandstone exists within a few miles of Scone in Perthshire. The Irish crowned Tea-Tephi ’ s descendants sitting over the Coronation Stone until the 5 th century CE, when Fergus MacEarca of the same royal line took the stone to Scotland. His army invaded Scotland from its landing on the Mull of Kintyre in Scotland. Scotland then crowned its kings sitting over the stone until 1296 when King Edward I of England placed it beneath the Coronation Chair in Westminster Abbey."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" 173 The English finally returned the mystical Coronation Stone to Scotland on 30 November 1996, St Andrew ’ s Day, in preparation for Queen Elizabeth II to open Scotland ’ s new Parliament on July 1, 1999. The Coronation Stone is very important to Danite Britain because the Book of Daniel represents God ’ s kingdom as a stone. 646 Underling the importance of the Coronation Stone was the precautions taken for its safety in World War II. In 1940, when the German invasion threatened England, the British Government removed the stone from Westminster Abbey to a secret hiding place and sent the details of its concealment to Canada ’ s Prime Minister. The Scythian population also migrated to Scandinavia and ultimately to Ireland. This began with the Assyrian captivity of the ten northern tribes of Israel in 741BCE to 721BCE. The Assyrians took twenty seven thousand people to the southern shore of the Caspian Sea, which borders on Northern Iran. Cuneiform tablets of Sargon discovered at the ancient Assyria capital of Khorsabad, north of Nineveh record: I besieged and captured Samaria, and carried off 27,290 of its inhabitants as booty. The Bible tells of the same event: 647 Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years. In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. Some escaped. The gravestone inscription of a member of the tribe of Naphtali, among many in the Crimea, records that the deceased was one: 648 who went into exile with the exiles, who were driven away with Hosea, the king of Israel. The power of the Assyrian Empire began to wane after several decades. In 679BCE, some of the captives broke away and escaped into the mountains of Asia Minor. 649 In 675BCE, within forty-five years of Israel ’ s captivity, the Scythians first appear in the Assyrian Annals of Esarhaddon : I scattered the Mannaean people, intractable barbarians, and I smote with the sword the armies of Ishpaki, the Iskuza alliance with them did not save him."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" 174 These Iskuza or Scythians may be the survivors of the ten lost tribes of Israel. As their influence increased, they conquered the Medes. Herodotus relates that: A battle was fought in which the Medes were defeated, and lost their power in Asia, which was taken over in its entirety by the Scythians. However, they never returned to Israel. In the late first century AD, Josephus noted that the ten tribes had not returned to Palestine: 650 ... there are but two tribes in Asia and Europe subject to the Romans, while the ten tribes are beyond Euphrates till now, and are an immense multitude and not to be estimated by numbers. In 609BCE, the Medes defeated both the Assyrians and Scythians. The Medes drove the Scythians into Southern Russia and toward the West. According to Herodotus, these people of South Russia and the area of the Caucasus during the seventh century BCE were the Cimmerians. As we saw in Chapter 5, traditional histories hold that the Cimmerians became the Cymry. The Scythians prospered in Southern Russia for three hundred years. In 250BCE, the Sarmatians drove them from just west of the Black Sea into Western Europe. They followed the rivers to Saxony, Scandinavia, England and Ireland. As the Scythians moved westwards across Asia Minor and Europe, so the territory of Scythia moved west with them. In Roman times, Scythia was located in Scandinavia. A late Irish antiquary says the Irish named a part Ireland Gaethluighe, which is Gothland, from the Goths or Scythians who took possession of it. 651 People in the north of Britain, called these Scythian people Caledonians after the people of Calydon in Peloponnesian Arcadia whose emblem was a boar. 652 Herodotus notes that the Persians called the Scythians by the name of Sacae or Saka from the ancient Persian name for Israel. 653 The ancient Saxons took their name from the sons of Sukai, the Sakai Suna or Saksun. Of course, the name Saxon may also derive from Sons of the Sword or the archaic Latin word for a large boulder or stone, saxum. 654 Herodotus also mentions that the Scythians had a reputation for being drunk. He mentions that other nations would use the proverb to pour out like a Scythian , which seems to have been the equivalent of the later saying as drunk as a Templar ."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" 175 The church historian Bede wrote how these Scythians arrived in Northern Ireland: 655 ... coming from Scythia in their long boats, and, being carried by tempest to the northern parts of Ireland. According to Bede, the local inhabitants were relations of the newcomers and they persuaded them to move on and settle in Scotland. Scotland received its name from these Scotia or Scythae. The Scottish Declaration of Independence of 1320CE states that the Scottish people of that period traced their ancestry back to greater Scythia, which included the territory between the Black and Caspian Seas. As with the Trojans, there is considerable commonality between the customs of the Scythians and pre-Roman Britons. The Scythians buried their king together with his horses and various objects of gold and silver. Deep freeze conditions in Siberia have preserved even perishable items such as carpets. From these tombs, archeologists have found that ancient Scyths wore trousers, belts and pointed caps. In common with the early Britons, they had long heads and a fondness for tattoos. Object of art provide another clue to the association between early Britons and Scythians. A student on St. Ninian ’ s Island discovered a rich hoard of Celtic objects inlaid with gold, silver and enamel, with typical Celtic Zoomorphic decoration. 656 In 1988, a young Russian archeologist discovered an equally skillful cache of Scythian work, carried out in exactly the same style, in a remote spot west of the Caspian Sea. 657 Another interesting co-incidence is that Boudica, in her battles against the invading Romans, used the ancient Scythian technique of equipping chariots with scythe blades on the hubs. 658 The Milesian Scots that followed the Tuatha-De-Danaan into Ireland descended from the itinerant ten Tribes of Israel. 659 The Book of Invasions says that they originated in the Cretan city of Miletus, fled to Syria in the thirteenth century BCE, sailed to North Africa, traveled to Compostela in North West Spain and thence to Ireland. 660 Another legend in the Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland , the Milesian Scots were knights who arrived in Ireland in the time shortly after the Exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt and the conquest of Canaan. The Milesian Scots may be the descendants of Zarah, David ’ s brother, who migrated into northwestern Europe and thence to Ireland."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" 176 The insignia of the Milesians flag and coat of arms was a Red Hand. This red hand is the symbol of Zarah, the first born of Jacob. He was the first to emerge from the womb and the mid-wife placed a scarlet thread upon his hand. 661 Ulster has adopted the Red Hand as its symbol and the Northern Ireland flag includes it with the six-pointed Star of David. The Milesians also traced their ancestry to Gad, who was one of the sons of the patriarch Jacob. The leader of the tribe, Gadelius, was the grandson of the king of Scythia. The famous Sacred Banner of the Milesians, which they carried to Ireland from Asia and southern Europe, showed a dead serpent and the rod of Moses. This serpent symbol was the early family heraldic emblem of the Israelite tribe of Dan. 662 For the legend of how the Trojan Brutus landed in Britain, we turn to the patriarch Joseph in Egypt. Upon his death, the sons of Judea ruled according to the blessing of Jacob. The Keltoi Israelites fell from power and fled from Egypt to Troy, thence to Spain and London. The line of Zarah, the first-born of Jacob, arrived in Ireland from the Near East in the days of David. Earliest Greek legends about the son of Belus, king of the Spartans, give the story of Danaus who arrived in Greece with his daughters by ship. According to the legend, Danaus shared the throne of Egypt with his half-brother Aegyptus. Aegyptus drove Danaus, his 50 sons and his 50 daughters from Egypt. While the brothers established Jerusalem, the daughters, called the Danaides, traveled to the Peloponnesus via Rhodes. This was the expulsion of the Hyksos, which we investigated in Chapter 6. Manetho, Diodorus Siculus and other classic authors identify Danaus with Dan of Israel. Manetho said the final expulsion of the Hyksos from Egypt included that of a people known as the Danaoi. The Hyksos Israelites therefore conquered Greece and laid the basis for Mycenaean civilization. The arrival of the Danaides is the story of how the cult of the Mother Goddess and the agricultural orgies in the Mysteries of Demeter, called the Thesmophoria , arrived in Greece from Egypt. 663 In the course of the proceedings, the devotees carried in a basket the severed genitals of the sacrificial king or his surrogate. The Priestesses made their basket from wild asparagus and rushes, which were sacred and tabooed for ordinary use. 664 The Spartans called their festival"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" 177 the Helenephoria after the Goddess Helen. 665 The priestesses called her basket a helene . The Mysteries of Demeter became the established religion of the Arcadians and over the years developed into the worship of Diana. In recent times, the women of Aegina re-established this ritual, most likely in the spirit of protecting their husbands from the Goddess (see Appendix 13). There is an opinion that the Danaioi formed a peculiar military class amongst the Mycenaean Greeks. Diodorus Siculus wrote: 666 They say that those who set forth with Danaus, likewise from Egypt, settled what is practically the oldest city of Greece, Argos, and that the nations of the Colchi in Pontus and that of the Jews, which lies between Arabia and Syria, were founded as colonies by certain emigrants from their country. In the Peloponnesus, Danaus ascended the throne of Argos. In honor of Danaus, the local Pelasgian-Ionian Greeks renamed themselves Danaioi. Homer ’ s Illiad often refers to the early Greeks as Danaioi. Strabo quotes Euripides: 667 Danaus, the father of fifty daughters on coming to Argos took up his abode in the city of Inarchos and throughout Hellas (i.e., Greece). He laid down the law that all people hitherto named Pelasgians were to be named Danaans. Historians believe the Philistines are a Cretan people who became the Greek Pelasgians. The term Pelast in early Greek inscriptions means Philistine. These Pelasgians together with the Anatolian Ionians from the west coast of Turkey, Aeolians and the Danaioi formed the great Mycenaean civilization. The Anatolian Pelopid people subsequently destroyed the Mycenaean civilization and the Mycenaeans fled to the north where history records them as Dorians. Herodotus confirmed that these Dorians originally came from Egypt: 668 ...in what follows I give the tradition of the Greeks generally. The kings of the Dorians (they say) counting up to Perseus, son of Danae ... If we follow the line of Danae, daughter of Acrisius, and trace her progenitors, we shall find that the chiefs of the Dorians are really genuine Egyptians ...

After the 1100BCE, the Dorians returned and re-established their suzerainty. 671 The Dorians referred to their re-ascendancy as the return of the Heraclids, meaning the return of the sons of followers of Hercules. Hercules was a hero of the Danaioi based on Samson, the judge-hero of the tribe of Dan. The Spartans so loved their king that they called themselves Danaans, long before they adopted the name of Spartans. Like Samson, they wore long hair as a symbol of magical significance and great strength. The king ’ s hair represents the rays of the sun. While the Spartans considered themselves part of the tribe of Dan, there appears to have been a relationship between the Spartans and the Jews. In the Apocrypha, the Spartans say: 672 Areus, king of the Spartans, to Onias, the high priest, greetings. It has been found in writing concerning the Spartans and the Jews that they are brethren and are of the family of Abraham. In the Antiquities of the Jews, Josephus adds to our knowledge of the letter: 673 It is but just, therefore, that you, who are our brethren, should send to us about any of your concerns as you please. We will also do the same thing, and esteem your concerns as our own, and will look upon our concerns as in common with yours. Demotoles, who brings you this letter, will bring your answer back to us. This letter is foursquare; and the symbol is an eagle, with a dragon in his claws. The symbolism in last sentence strongly suggests that the letter applied to the tribe of Dan. This could be why Onias of Judah ignored it. The Spartan letter followed the invasion of Jerusalem by the Syrian general Antiochus Epiphanes. Onias subsequently died. His successor, Jonathan, wrote a letter of reply to the Spartans of southern Greece fifty years later. Josephus described this letter: 674 Jonathan the high priest of the Jewish nation...to the ephori and senate and the people of the Lacedamonians (Spartans), send greeting: When in former times an epistle was brought to Onias, who was then our high priest, from Areus, one of your kings, concerning the kindred that was between us and you, as the copy"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" 179 subjoined attests.

We may say that constantly on every occasion, at our festivals and on other appointed days, we make a remembrance of you in the sacrifices we offer and in our prayers, as it is right and fitting to remember brothers. Homer ’ s Illiad described the founder of Troy as named Dardanus, the son of Zeus. Dardanus ’ grandson Tros, was the namesake of the ancient Trojans and of their capital city, Troy. Tros had three sons: Ilus, Ganymede and Assaracus. Priam was the ruler of Troy at the time of its destruction. He was of the line of Ilus. The Spartans lived in Laconia, near Arcadia, in the southern Greek peninsula called Peloponnesus. Over the centuries, some of the group migrated northeast across the Aegean Sea to build the ancient city of Troy at Troad, or Troas, in Anatolia. The Greek name for these Pelasgian speaking Trojans was Pelasgoi. As they came from Hittite Wilusha (Ilios), they were also the Wiliosioi or Weshesh. The Greeks believed the first man on earth was Pelasgus, ancestor of the Pelasgians, who sprang from Boreas ’ teeth in the soil of Arcadia. 675 Boreas, as the North Wind, represented the primeval fertility, the spirit that fertilizes women, animals and plants. 676 Even until Roman times, educated men believed mares could turn their hindquarters to the North Wind and breed foals without the aid of a stallion. 677 The North Wind Boreas subsequently became the serpent of Israelite and Egyptian myth, constantly consorting with the Mother Goddess. 678 The despairing Trojan War began when Paris, a Trojan prince, fell in love with Helen who was the daughter of Zeus and Nemesis. 679 Paris abducted Helen from her husband, the Spartan king. The Mycenaean Greek Spartans waged war on the Trojans for a decade. Finally, as legend records, the Spartans successfully employed the ruse of the Trojan Horse. They rescued Helen, killed many of the Trojans and set fire to the city. In reality, the Trojan War was the final contest for control of the mercantile trade routes, which began with the fall of Knossos in about 1400BCE. 680 The Trojan Confederacy blocked Mycenaean access to the"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" 180 Black Sea. This meant the Trojans controlled trade in gold, silver, iron, cinnabar, ship ’ s timber, linen, hemp, dried fish, oil and Chinese jade. 681 With the Trojan War lost in 1185BCE, the Trojan Confederacy disintegrated and its people dispersed. Druid traditions support this dispersion and a second Trojan migration from Thrace, Greece and Asia Minor to Britain in 1115BCE. 682 Arriving in Britain, the Trojans from Hittite Wilusha became the Welsh. After 449AD, w ealas , the Anglo-Saxon word for foreigners , came to mean the dispossessed Britons in their own land. 683 Brutus and his father were among the Trojan royalty who escaped to Rome. Brutus returned to Greece after accidentally killing his father while hunting. In Greece, he freed the Trojan slaves and liberated the Trojan fleet. The he sailed to Hibernia where his Trojan brothers were already ruling. In 1115BCE, Brutus arrived in New Troy, which later became London. Britain derived its name from Brutus. In 60BCE, at the beginning of the Roman conquest of Britain, Diodorus Siculus confirmed that the Britains and the Trojans had common customs: The Britons live in the same manner that the ancients did; they fight in chariots as the ancient heroes of Greece are said to have done in the Trojan Wars -- they are plain and upright in their dealings -- the island is very populous -- the Celts never shut the doors of their houses; they invite strangers to their feasts, and when it is over ask who they are and what is their business. Some years after the end of the Trojan War, surviving Trojans moved north and west from the Black Sea. They followed the Danube River into Germany, Belgium and northern France, eventually settling in the Austrasia region of the province of Lorraine. The Spartans who migrated into southern France perhaps became the Merovingians. As we saw in Chapter 4, the ancient Druidic histories record the colonization of England by a megalithic Hyperborean Bear Race via the Aegean, in the fourth millennium BCE. This migration reputedly occurred because the Black Sea flooded Peloponnesian Arcadia. The Druidic tradition holds that Britain was Alba, Albania or the land of Albion. Albion was the tribe leader who led this fourth millennium BCE migration from the Aegean to Britain. Upon their arrival, the White Land of Albion became a special country of Apollo.

In Delphi, Apollo was worshipped as the wolf Lykogenos, equivalent to the British god Bran. 685 Diodorus continued that britains inhabitants are in a sense Apollo ’ s priests, an idea taken-up by Sir Francis Bacon ’ s Novum Organum . The White Cliffs of Dover and the white hills of Wessex provide a straightforward explanation for the name Alba or white land. 686 Gaelic speaking Celts from Gaul made crossed the English Channel at the shortest point. They arrived at the White Cliffs and called their new home Albion. Himilco the Carthaginian referred to Albion in c500 BCE but we only know of this indirectly. Circa 366CE, Rufus Festus Avienus translated the works of the Greek philosopher Eratosthenes. Eratosthenes (c276 BCE) had recorded Himilco the Carthaginian ’ s claim that he sailed through the Pillars of Hercules to a Sacred Isle, which lay near the Isle of the Albiones. Conventionally, the Pillars are thought to be Gibraltar but Plutarch ’ s De facie quae in orbe lunae apparet (the face that appears in the moon ’ s circle) suggests the Pillars are northwest of Britain in the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic Ocean near the Gulf Stream. 687 Aristotle said that the Pillars of Hercules were the Pillars of Briareus. Homer ’ s Odyssey refers to them as the Pillars of Atlas. 688 Tacitus wrote that in 12 BCE, Tiberius ’ brother Drusus Germanicus sailed into the northern seas to find the Pillars because rumour had it that the Pillars of Hercules still existed . 689 He turned back because of terrible weather. In the Odyssey, Homer ’ s Ogygia was a magical a paradise similar to the Eden of Genesis: 690 Clear water gushed out from four aligned springs, Close together but turning towards opposite sides; All around there were soft meadows of violets and celery In bloom. Even an Immortal coming here Would be enchanted in admiring this and be delighted in his heart. Shakespeare featured a Faroe Island in his play The Tempest . It may have been Prospero ’ s magical island but his daughter Miranda symbolized the Goddess Calypso and she was really the source of his power. As in Macbeth and Hamlet, Antonio was a usurping brother that introduced the ancient tree battle between the Kerm King and Terebinth"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" 182 King (see Chapter 14). Caliban was the ever-present wickedness often represented by a dragon or serpent. Geographers such as Ptolemy Avienus abbreviated Albion to Alba. Gaelic speaking Scots, the original Celtic Britons, still refer to their Scotland (the eastern Border country and Wales) as Alba. Caledonia, from the Caledonii tribe, is the old name for Scotland north of the Firth of Forth and Clyde. The Welsh Triads also relate that all but two people, of the first inhabitants of Britain drowned in a great flood. A ship, containing a man and his family, along with a male and female of every living creature were the only ones to survive the flood. The Triads then mention the arrival of the Cymry or Kymry. This name means the first race and later the British. As we saw in Chapter 5, the Greeks knew them as Kimmerioi. Others called them Cambria or Cumbria. They derive from the Welsh word Cymru, pronounced as Kumry or Kumri. Assyrian texts give the Israelites the same name. The Cymry came from ancient Albania, then located to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and bordering the western coast of the Caspian Sea: There are three pillars of the nation of the Isle of Britain. The first was Hu the Mighty, who brought the nation of the Kymry first to the Isle of Britain; coming from that which is called Defrobani ... Defrobani is Dyffynbanu or Dyffynalbanu, the deep vales or glens of Albania. This is the country between the Euxine (Black Sea) and Caspian Sea. 691 The Norse called this place Asgerd, the traditional home of their god Odin. They believed the city of Asgerd was located thirty miles north of Lake Van, in very area where the Assyrians settled the ten lost tribes of Israel. The British associated the ancient legends of giant Cornish megalithic builders with the Cymry. These giants shared similar mythical traits to the Watchers of the Book of Enoch, who were the Nephilim and their offspring with the Daughters of Man called the Anakim at the Danite sanctuary of Mount Hermon. The Cornish sources of tin, so famous in Roman times, came into production in about 1000BCE. The chief Phoenician port in Britain and the center of the tin trade was probably St. Michael's Mount in Cornwall, which is Strabo ’ s Ictis . The Odyssey also mentions a market for bronze in a country called Thamesis , which may correspond to the region of the Thames estuary. 692 "},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" 183 The early name of the British counties of Cornwall and Devon in southwestern England was Dumnoni, or Danmoni. The historian William Camden said Cornwall was: 693 That region which according to the geographers, is the first of all Britain, and... was in ancient times inhabited by those Britains, whom Solinas called, Dunmonii, Ptolomy (called) Damnonii, or (as we find in some other copies), more truly Danmonil which name ... derived from the ever-continuing mines of tin in this tract, which Britains call monia. The name Danmonia derives from moina , a tin mine, and Dan, the people who mined the tin. They nicknamed this ancient tin mining region Dan ’ s tin mines . Phoenician or Hebrew influence seems present in many ancient place names in Cornwall. These include Baal Rock, Boswidden and Chegwidden. The latter both mean house of the Jews. Ywedhyon, meaning of the Jews, is a suffix in several place names. The Welsh Chronicle , sometimes called Annales Cambriae , refers to a region in Wales near St David's or Mnyw (Menevia) as St. David's Moni Iudeorum. This may identify the area as a tin mining settlement of the Israelite tribe of Judah. The Vetus Chronicon Holsatiae says the Saxons, Danes and Jutes are Jews of the tribe of Dan. 694 These other Scythian groups arrived after the Roman occupation. In about 800CE, Nennius traced the Saxons back to Scythia. In his account of the arrival of the Saxon leaders Hengist and Hrosa on the Isle of Thanet, Nennius mentions that they sent their messengers to Scythia for reinforcements. Earlier in this chapter, we saw that Herodotus noted the Persians called the Scythians by the name of Sacae or Saka from their ancient name for Israel. The Saxons also attributed their own origin to the territory in which the exiled lost ten tribes settled. Strabo confirms the tradition that Sukasuna was part of the Roman province of Armenia. The opening paragraph of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle also says of the earlier Celtic inhabitants of Britain, whom the Anglo-Saxons displaced: The inhabitants of this land were Britons, they came from Armenia, and first settled in the south of Britain. In addition, Milton says: 695 "},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" 184 They (the Saxons) were a people thought by good writers to be descendants of the Sacae, a kind of Scythians in the north of Asia, thence called Sacasons, or sons of Sacae, who with a flood of other northern nations came into Europe, toward the declining of the Roman Empire. When the Saxons invaded the British Isles, they established towns with the Dans, Dons and Duns names such as Dundee and Dunraven in Scotland. They are as prolific in Scotland as in Ireland. We turn now to theories that the famed seamen of Dan reached America. In the days of Oliver Cromwell, Mennaseh ben Israel maintained that the descendant of the lost ten tribes of Israel were to be found among American Indians. Mennaseh ben Israel was a Dutch Cabalist Rabbi who petitioned Cromwell for the return of Jews to England. The Mormons later revived his ideas. In a public speech on May 10, 1844, Joseph Smith described how he envisaged the Mormons as part of the kingdom of Dan: I calculate to be one of the instruments of setting up the kingdom of Daniel by the word of the Lord, and I intend to lay a foundation that will revolutionize the whole world. A Mormon group called the Dannites , or Sons of Dan , was particularly active in Missouri. They developed the reputation of hard men, which mirrored that of the early Danites in Greece. Originally, the Mormons called this group the Daughter of Zion but later changed its name to Dannites and more recently to the Strengthening the Members Committee . Mormon Elders formed a Priesthood of Melchizedek. They claimed that in 1829, Peter, James, and John of the New Testament appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and gave them the keys of the Melchizedek Priesthood, which they had supposedly received from Jesus. The Mormons believed that sea-borne Israelites traded with America, exploiting copper resources in the period from 1000BCE to 800BCE. To substantiate his belief, Joseph Smith sought evidence in red Native American burial mounds. He found many bronze and copper tools in the mounds, although the American Indians did not make bronze. Radiocarbon dating of American copper working to 2000-1000BCE may in fact be consistent with visits by Phoenicians and Israelites. Plutarch provides a surprising confirmation that some of these primitive Bronze Age seafarers may have found and settled the coast of"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" 185 America in a time called the Atlantic period (5500-2000BCE) when the climate was mild. 696 In De Facie quae in orbe lunae apparet ( the face that appears in the moon ’ s circle ) he wrote that: 697 There are other islands beyond Ogygia [the Faroes] that are at the same distance from one another. Further across the great ocean: One reaches the great continent which surrounds the ocean ... The coast of the continent is inhabited by Greeks along the shores of a gulf having at least the size of Meotis, which flows into the sea at about the same latitude as the mouth of the Caspian Sea. The call themselves ‘ the Continentals ’ . Plutarch ’ s gulf with the size of Meotis , nowadays known as the Sea of Azov, aligns with the Canadian Gulf of St Lawrence. The early settlers were cut-off when the climate deteriorated in the Sub-Boreal Period (2000-500BCE), whose peak in the middle of the second millennium BCE corresponded with the Iron Age. 698 During this period, the glaciers advanced and the ocean became wild and impassable. In about 1300BCE the temperature began to rise again, which culminated in the warmer Medieval Period around 1000CE when the Leif Eriksson ventured once more to the continent he named Vinland. The cold set in once more in 1200CE and the North Atlantic route quickly became blocked. The temperature reached a minimum in the 18 th century CE and is now warming-up again. The legends of Danites expand Irish history in a colorful and romantic way. As we have seen, the legends form the basis of British Imperial Christianity. Monarchial British Israelism and Radical British Israelism follow as developments of the theme. Radical or Postmillennial British Israelism builds a controversial prescriptive paradigm around these same legends in quite a different way. Radical British Israelism began with Jacques Abbadie. He was a French Huguenot whom William of Orange elevated to Dean of Kilaloe in Ireland in recognition of his support. In 1723, Abbadie published a book Triomphe de la Religion in Amsterdam, which said: 699 Unless the ten tribes have flown into the air ... they must be sought for in the north and west, and in the British Isles Richard Brothers (1757-1824), a Canadian, applied these ancient prophecies in a new radical paradigm. He sought to prove that before Christ returns the English and Americans would establish the Kingdom of God on earth. Later he received a vision that he was a descendant of King"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":" 186 David and the English were Israelites. Brothers ’ delusion increased and he claimed the right to be king of England. In short shift, King George III convicted him of treason and confined him to an asylum. Modern adherents of Radical British Israelism now draw on Herbert W. Armstrong ’ s popular but controversial book The United States and British Commonwealth in Prophecy where he promotes the hypothesis that: 700 Our white, English-speaking peoples today--Britain and America- -are actually and truly the Birthright tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh of the lost House of Israel. Some fundamentalist Christian groups and the Klu Klux Klan promote Radical British Israelism along with the Protocols of the Elders of Sion to provide divine justification for their anti-Semitic, or rather anti- Judaic racial theories. The key radical theme is that Biblical prophesies prove that the tribe of Dan will judge Judah, which means today ’ s Jews. Jacob ’ s deathbed prophesy is the most important of these: 701 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days ... Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward. The second most important prophecy came from Ezekiel. He prophesized the overturning of David ’ s throne: 702 And thou profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, Thus saith the Lord God; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, abase him that is high. I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him. Ezekiel lived around 600BCE and was a contemporary of Jeremiah. God caused him to prophesy the downfall of the kingdom of Judah of that time, Jerusalem and the land of Israel. He prophesied a foreign invasion of the sword would come against Judah: 703 Let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain. Scholars point out that Ezekiel ’ s prophecy applied to ancient King Zedekiah, who Nebuchadnezzar conquered in 586-587 BCE. Nebuchadnezzar executed Zedekiah ’ s sons and Zedekiah never regained the throne. From that time, there has been no Davidic king of Judah"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" 187 reigning over the Jews. Therefore, the throne was literally overthrown three times in Judah, in 607-604, 597-596, and 587-586 BCE, just as Ezekiel ’ s prophecy stated. 704 However, there has been no Davidic king sitting on that throne ever the time of King Zedekiah and no king has sat on David's throne in Jerusalem. For all practical purposes, the Davidic monarchy ceased to exist in Israel. However, the prophecy goes on: it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is . British-Israelites teach that this passage refers to the period after God sent the nation of Judah into captivity and punished the wicked King Zedekiah of Judah. God used Jeremiah the prophet to take the King Zedekiah ’ s Daughters to Ireland, where one of them married into another royal line of Judah, Prince Herremon, and thus David's line continued in Ireland. The radical British Israelites say that was the first overturn. The second overturn occurred when God moved the line to Scotland. The third overturn was when God moved it from Scotland to England. The Radical British Israelites claim David ’ s line will not be overturned again until Jesus returns, whose right it is to sit on the throne of His father David. 705 To the Radical British Israelites, Psalm 89 confirms that God would not cut-off David ’ s descendants throughout the ages. 706 Furthermore, they say God promised David that his throne would endure forever without any conditions or reservations. This means that the throne of David would not cease to exist with the overthrow of King Zedekiah but continue somewhere on this earth. They say this was in Ireland, then in turn in Scotland, England and America. In the context of these prophecies, the Radical British Israelites interpret Samson's famous riddle as a prophecy that the descendants of the tribe of Dan will one day destroy the tribe of Judah: 707 Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. From the carcass of the lion symbolizing Judaism, the tribe of Dan symbolized by bees will produce a Golden Age symbolized by honey: 708 And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion. And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother,"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":" 188 and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion. The tribe of Dan has always been complementary to that of Judah. During the Exodus, Aholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan had the same Master ’ s position as Bezaleel: And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee. The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle. 709 In the wilderness: the standard of the camp of Dan shall be on the north side by their armies: and the captain of the children of Dan shall be Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai . 710 Jacob had said Judah was the old lion ’ s whelp: 711 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? Nevertheless, just before his death, Moses prophesied that the new lion ’ s whelp was the strong young lion of Dan:. 712 Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan . Psalm 22 echoes this, and in addition emphasizes the unicorn totem of the tribe of Ephraim: 713 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round. They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion...Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns. At the time of Solomon, the Danites were still a parallel force to Judah. They exceeded Judah in skills of architecture and the arts, sending Hiram to build the Temple. Hiram was the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan: 714 And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram ... The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" 189 In summary, Jacob had said Dan would judge, Moses continued that Dan would be the new lion and Samson the Judge that he would eat from the carcass of the old lion ’ s whelp. Obviously the Judah's Rabbi were not ignorant of Dan's prophesies. Neither were they comfortable with the prophecy of Jeremiah, which separates the children Israel from those of Judah. 715 Jeremiah says the Danite Messiah will judge of the sins of Judah. He adds that this Messiah will reign from the territory of Mount Hermon (Sion) in Dan rather than Mount Zion in Jerusalem: 716 And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob . This sequence of prophesies made the Church fathers such as Irenaeus and Hippolytus very uneasy about Dan. 717 They developed a novel theory that the Antichrist and Dan were one. This was because Dan worshipped idols, Dan would judge the Jews and because the snorting of His horses was heard from Dan. 718 Earlier in this chapter, we saw that God placed Dan in the north because of its idolatry: Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel ... Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan. And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan ... And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi . 719 They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan, liveth; and, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise up again . 720 The Church fathers saw their conspiracy theory confirmed in the Book of Chronicles, which omitted Dan from the tribes of the children of Israel. 721 Irenaeus suggested that this meant that Dan would not be among the one hundred and forty four thousand saved ones of the twelve tribes in the Apocalypse. 722 The full text of Jeremiah had said that the serpents of Dan and cockatrices would bite the people: 723 "},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":" 190 We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble! The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein. For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the Lord. Isaiah added to the worry of the Church Fathers by repeating that the cockatrice and serpent would scourge the land of Israel. He said: 724 Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent ... Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times. Jeremiah went further to say the whole land would be desolate: 725 For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim ... I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord, and by his fierce anger. For thus hath the Lord said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end. Little wonder indeed that the Rabbis of Jesus ’ time were highly antagonistic to a potential Messiah who prima facie fulfilled the prophecies of a Danite Messiah. The Rosicrucians, of whom we shall have much more to say in Chapter 17, championed the survival of the Danites, Nazarenes and Melchizedekians. In theory, they also look forward to the second coming of the Messiah. Their Rosicrucian symbol is the phoenix of Dan, the mysterious two-headed bird now called an eagle in Freemasonry. 726 As we have seen in this Chapter, it symbolizes the immortality of the Priests of Melchizedek. The standard of the tribe of Dan was red and white with this phoenix crest. The two-headed eagle emblem is often depicted in the colors of the Tribe of Dan, red and white. 727 The presiding officer in the thirty- third degree ceremony of the Scottish Rite robes in the manner of this crest. He dresses in crimson silk, edged with white fur and holds a drawn sword in his hand. 728 The officer represents heroic Ahiezer son of"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" 191 Ammishaddai, Captain of the children of Dan, who placed the serpent killer, the phoenix, on the crest of Dan. 729 In Chapter 16 we shall see the importance of Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai ’ s initials AA in secret Rosicrucian symbolism. Another important AA archetype existed in the tribe of Dan at the time of Exodus. As we have seen, this was Bezaleel ’ s fellow artisan, Aholiab son of Ahisamach. 730 In the context of the enigmatic Rosicrucian thirty third degree, it is interesting to note that the city of Dan and the nearby sacred Mount Hermon both lie at approximately 33 ° longitude and 33 ° latitude according to the French Zero Meridian in Paris. In 1884, by convention the Greenwich Zero Meridian replaced the traditional French Zero Meridian, which moved the longitude of Mount Hermon to 35.5 ° . The existence in Rosicrucianism of the Danite philosophy, the interpretation of ancient prophecies about the Second coming of Jesus, and the radical philosophy of man establishing God ’ s kingdom on earth before the Messiah returns, suggest an interesting conclusion. This is that John Dee ’ s Elizabethan Rosicrucianism carries forward the ideals of Monarchial British Israelism into a plan to fulfill prophecies of assisting a Danite Messiah judge Judah from his seat at Mount Hermon. Fortunately, the modern organization does not seem to carry this into the pitfalls and racial bigotry of Radical British Israelism. We now turn to examine the philosophical building blocks of hermetic thought through the history of the great Corpus Hermeticum."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":" 192 Chapter 13 Corpus Hermeticum & Gnosticism George Gemistos, known as Plethon, ran a Neoplatonist School in Mistra in the Peloponnese. 731 In 1438CE, with the encouragement of Cosimo de Medici, Plethon relocated his Platonic studies to Florence. There he was outside the influence of the Roman Catholic Church and he established a humanist movement with a belief in universal Platonic religion. Although Plethon never mentioned the Corpus Hermeticum, he declared that within a few years the whole world would have one and the same religion . This was not to be the faith of Christ or Mohammed, he said, but another faith, which is not so different from the faith of the Gentiles . Shortly afterwards, in 1463CE, Cosimo de Medici ’ s scholar Marsilio Ficino translated the Corpus Hermeticum into Latin. 732 The idea that God had spoken directly to the pagan Egyptians, Sabians and Greeks ignited intellectual Europe: 733 That God, however, has not cared for the Hebrews only, ... The Egyptians, counting up of their own race the names of not a few sages, can also say they have had many who followed in the steps of Hermes. I mean of the Third Hermes who used to come down to them in Egypt. The Chaldeans also tell of the disciples of Oannes and Belus, and the Greeks of tens of thousands who have the Wisdom from Cheirion. For it is from him that they derived their initiation into the mysteries of nature, and their knowledge of divine things ... The Corpus Hermeticum that fell into the hands of Cosimo de Medici was probably the personal copy of Michael Psellus, spirited away from Constantinople in 1453CE before the Arabs captured the city. Michael Psellus received this same copy from the Sabians of Harran in 1055CE. The Corpus Hermeticum is composed of Greek writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus. It is apparently a collection of doctrinal and inspirational writings by several authors, as is the Bible. 734 The Corpus Hermeticum has a number of key themes. These include the absolute goodness of God who is both One and All; self-revelation of the Divine Mind in the cosmos; the universe as an emanation of living beings"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" 193 in hierarchical order; a unique constitution of the human being as microcosm; the way to regeneration; and a direct knowledge of God. The close similarity of these themes with those of the Phoenician School of Philosophy of Elea, in southern Italy, which prospered two thousand years earlier, argues for their antiquity. Xenophanes of Colophon founded the School of Elea in 536BCE. His pupils included Parmenides and Zeno of Elea who developed the concept of metaphysics. Xenophanes ’ hermetic philosophy underlies that of Plato and Aristotle. It refers to a real but secret initiatory tradition. 735 Xenophanes advocated a single non-human deity underlying and unifying all worldly phenomena. He satirizes the polytheistic manlike deities created by the Greeks as athletic reflections of themselves. Some of the major points of his doctrine taken from fragments gathered by Theophrastus are: There is one God only, supreme among gods and men; neither in form nor thought like mortals. He sees all over, thinks all over, and hears all over. But without toil he sways all things with his mind. And he abides ever in the same state, moving not at all, nor does it befit him to move about. There never has been nor will there ever be a man who has clear knowledge of the gods, nor of those things of which I speak; for even if he does chance to say what is right, yet he himself does not know that it is so. There is nothing but opinion everywhere. A delightfully incisive rabbinical expression of this is: God is ineffable; all the rest is man ’ s cleverness. Both Greek philosophy and a free experimentation with Arabian alchemy underpinned the doctrines of the Corpus Hermeticum. Both components of the Corpus found a fertile environment in Renaissance Italy and Europe. A minimalist summary of the doctrine was set down in a treatise called the Emerald Tablet . It is brief to the point of obscurity. We shall understand it better in Chapter 16 where we look at the hermetic document Virgin of the World in an expanded alchemical context. The Emerald Tablet is part of the Lost Wisdom of Lamech . 736 Lamech ’ s three sons were Jabal , Jubal and Tubal-cain , respectively a mathematician, a mason and a metalworker. The sons preserved the ancient wisdom of creative science on two pillars called the Antediluvian Pillars .

Many say it contains the whole of the alchemists' art. The inset provides a 1680 translation by Sir Isaac Newton. 737 The Emerald Tablet is still the earliest of all alchemical works in the West. It first appeared as the Kitab Sirr al-Asar , a book of advice to kings of eight hundred CE. 738 Johannes Hispalensis translated this book into Latin about 1140CE. 739 The earliest alchemical text in Chinese is the second or third century BCE book XXV of Han-Shu in which Li Chao-Kiun tells the Han dynasty emperor Wu-Ti how to change cinnabar dust into gold. In 142CE, Wei Po-yang wrote the next alchemical Chinese text Ts'an T'ung Ch'i . It refers to alchemical experiments and using gold to extend life. The color of emerald green holds a great fascination. The colour is a kind of optical balm. 740 Pliny said no colour has a more pleasing appearance . 741 If the Emerald tablet really existed, it was probably rock crystal dyed emerald with copper sulphates. Diodorus noted that rock crystal could be baptized in divine fire to create a smaragdos, an artificial emerald. 742 The Wizard ’ s emerald city in L Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz demonstrates its enduring delight. However, it is as well to remember that the Greeks and Egyptians used the term we translate as emerald to apply to gem quality emeralds as well as green granite and green jasper. In medieval times, the emerald table of the Gothic kings of Spain was made of emerald green glass. 743 Another green glass dish, the Sacro Catino, is said to have belonged to the Queen of Sheba and been used at the Last Supper. Although it is wonderfully romantic to think of the Em erald Tablet as a sparkling gem, the green color simply symbolizes Wisdom. The Emerald Tablet is a formula of alchemy and messianic resurrection theology. It is closely associated with the alchemical Green Lion of the Philosophers ’ Stone. The discovery of the Corpus Hermeticum inextricably joined such diverse pursuits as hermetic philosophy, alchemy, industrial chemistry, glass making and medicine. Furthermore, the clandestine, scientific, anti- papal nature of these liberal arts disintermediated the Church from scientific pursuit based on inductive and deductive logic, and so"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" 196 encouraged all sorts of more radical and heretical religions. One heresy in particular, radical or extreme Gnosticism, led to many violent deaths. The difference between Hermeticism and Gnosticism was far more than terminology. Hermeticism conceived man as a rough stone, the rude material for perfection. A philosophical chisel knocked-off his rough edges, crafting him as a perfect human for the cosmic Temple. It was analogous to the stonemason producing a perfect cubic ashlar for a worldly Temple. This was the work of the supreme creator and goes back to Plato's Demiurgos. 744 Hermetic beliefs were uplifting and life affirming. Man is the image of the macrocosm and his body is the garment and weapon of his soul. 745 The body is an essential and indispensable part of the Good Creation. Celibacy and asceticism are not revered but consistently renounced. Cosmic Zoroastrianism holds the same belief. Radical Gnostics, such as Manichaeists and Cathars instead absorbed naive dualism, which lacked order from a vertically integrative element. Scholars also call this Radical Gnosticism anti-cosmic dualism . Through this odd framework, they perceived the radical Demiurge, or god of the material world, was the god of the Old Testament Yahweh. The Gnostics regarded him as mad and evil in the same way as the Egyptian Set and Zoroastrianism Ahriman was intrinsically evil. The major similarity was that both Yahweh and Ahriman received the material world until the End-time . Radical Gnostic religions twisted the elegant duality of pure Zoroastrianism, called Monarchical or Cosmic Zoroastrianism into a delaminated and intrinsically anarchical framework. They regarded the material world and the body as bad and the soul as good . As the body was bad , procreation was abhorrent. Death was welcome as a casting away of worldly baggage. 746 This ascetic existence is the complete antithesis of hermetic belief. Today, we occasional see a cult falling into the same radical Gnostic quicksand of soul is good and body is bad . In the 1990s, this led to mass suicides in the Order of the Solar Temple and Heaven's Gate. The seeds of the association of body with evil seem to have arisen with the Thracians who strongly believed in the beauty of death and immortality of the soul. 747 They celebrated death in their Dionysian or Bacchic Mysteries. However, the Thracians showed legendary bravery on the battlefield because of this preoccupation with death. This characteristic was so attractive to the kings of soldier states that it became"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" 197 a state religion. It crystallized into the Greek Mysteries of Orphism, the Eleusian Mysteries and even the Pythagorean movement. 748 The Radical Gnostics had their own form of the Emerald Tablet called the pearl of great price . The Ethiopian Legends of Our Lady sets out their belief: 749 Hannah, Mary and Sophia were three sisters and Hannah was the Virgin Mary's mother. 'The Virgin first came down into the body of Seth, shining like a white pearl.' Then successively entered Enos, Cainan .. Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech, Noah .. Abraham, Isaac, Joseph .. David, Solomon .. and Joachim. 'And Joachim said to his wife Hannah \"I saw Heaven open and a white bird came therefrom and hovered over my head\". This bird had its being in the days of old .. It was the Spirit of Life in the form of a white bird and .. became incarnate in Hannah's womb when the pearl went forth from Joachim's loins and .. Hannah received it, namely the body of our Lady Mary. The white pearl is mentioned for its purity, and the white bird because Mary's soul existed aforetime with the Ancient of Days .. Thus bird and pearl are alike and equal.' From the Body of Mary, the pearl, the white bird of the spirit then entered into Jesus at the Baptism.' In Europe, the Papacy called the Radical Gnostic-dualist tradition the Great Heresy of the Bogomils . The origin of the Bogomils is still unknown. They emerged from the Indo-Hittite crucible and developed close ethnic and cultural affinities with the northern Iranians. By the seventh century CE, their great Bulgarian Empire spread from the Ukraine to the Adriatic and Albania. 750 The Ottomans eventually conquered this empire in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries CE. Misrepresentation was common ploy in the Roman Catholic Church ’ s struggle to eradicate competing strains of Christianity. Their accusations of buggery vilified the Bogomils. If the accusations had any basis, it may have been the infamous ritual kiss in ano practiced by a number of esoteric societies to inculcate humility. Even today, the Bulgarians remain smeared with the accusation of this unnatural vice. In stark contrast to this reputation, the Bogomils may well have been the greatest puritans of the Middle Ages. The real sin of the Bogomils was to claim they represented the true and hidden church, the Nazarenes of Bethlehem and Capernaum. 751 Underlying this dangerous claim seems to have been the legitimacy of the Melchizedek tradition as with the Cathars in Southern France. To the"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" 198 Roman Catholic Church, this was as alarming as the worst of the Gnostic heresies, radical Manichaeanism. 752 The difficulty for all religious interpreters of the Great Heresy of the Bogomils is that the cosmic strand (three are one) and the anti-cosmic strand (one versus one) of Zoroastrianism are enormously convoluted. Generally, the omnipotent God is Good, except in the Jewish Talmud where he is both good and bad in the sense of being vengeful and unpredictable. The second son is also Good except again in the Jewish Talmud, which does not recognize him at all. The Qumran Covenanters recognized Michael instead. Satan is the real conundrum. Interpretations range from the respected agent of God (the Accuser in the Jewish Talmud) to a son of the Good God turned bad by his own choice, to a son of the Good God bad by design, further to the bad son of an intrinsically bad primordial god. Finally, Satan is a bad primordial god himself, the Devil of the New Testament. To complicate things even further the Old Testament changes its view of Satan at I Chronicles. At this point, Satan transforms from Yahweh's subordinate into the evil, archenemy of God. 753 Finally, to complete the mad m é lange, the radical Gnostics identified Yahweh as Satan. In all this confusion of dualism, the Roman Catholic Church was unable to differentiate between the various sects and eventually condemned the Bogomils and Cathars alike as Persian Manichaeists. The Cistercian papal legate Arnald-Almaric, General of C î teaux, encapsulated this at B é ziers in 1209CE with his infamous order: ... kill them all, the Lord will look after his own . Arnald-Almaric became Commander-in-Chief of the Albigensian crusade when the King of France declined this doubtful honor. After murdering seven thousand catholic women, children and priests celebrating a Eucharist in St Mary Magdalene, Arnald triumphantly reported to Pope Innocent: Today, your highness, twenty thousand citizens were put to the sword, regardless of age or sex. Inquisition records show that the Cathars ’ treasure was smuggled away on two or three occasions during the siege. 754 The Cathar deacon of Toulouse, Pierre Bonet, and a Parfait called Mathieu carried money and jewels to Pons Arnaud de Chateau-Verdun, at his castle near Ussat. Mathieu returned to collect some of the treasure that he had not been able to carry on the first journey. On the night before the final massacre, four"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" 199 Parfaits escaped, including Amiel Aicart, Hugues and Paytavi who signaled their successful flight with a fire on Bidorta ’ s summit. The Cathars ’ Holy Grail may have made its way to an English college of Cathars, called Bonhommes or ‘ good men ’ , at the monastery of Ashridge, near Berkhamstead. Edmund, Earl of Cornwall, maintained it. His mother ’ s family, the Counts of Toulouse, were traditional protectors of the Cathars. Edward III ‘ s son, the Black Prince, also marked the significance of the monastery. He gave it a great table of gold and silver, furnished full of precious relics, and in the middle of it a holy cross of the wood of the rue Cross, and the said table is garnished with stones and pearls, that is to say twenty-five rubies, thirty-four sapphires, fifteen great pearls and several other sapphires, emeralds and small pearls ... The Albigensian Crusade and subsequent ethnic cleansing by the Inquisition effectively eliminated both the Cathars of Southern France and the misnamed Great Heresy of the Bogomils . Notwithstanding the galvanization of heretical beliefs by alchemy, the Roman Catholic Church remained as intrigued with alchemy as the Gnostics. Alchemy was a widespread pursuit in the monasteries of pre-Reformation England. There were two types of alchemists, the monks and the secular licensees . Licensees practiced alchemy on the understanding that they would not counterfeit. They were required to report any success to the monarch. Prima facie, alchemy was not heretical despite alchemical texts being attributed to people of suspect faith such as Roger Bacon, Arnald de Villanova, Ramon Lull and Gerber. Few of these alchemical texts were directly heretical in any case. For example, Gerber, who was J â bir ibn Hayy â n, wrote the world's oldest book on chemistry called Summa Perfectionis or Summit of Perfection . It is so incomprehensible that its author's name gave rise to the word gibberish . Pope Alexander III banned monks practicing alchemy at the Council of Tours in 1163. He bluntly forbade the study of physics or the laws of the world . Following this, St. Dominic solemnly condemned all research using experiment and observation. Between 1243 and 1323, both the Dominicans and Franciscans prohibited the study of medicine, natural philosophy and chemistry. We see here the hardening of attitudes to Arabian chemistry and philosophy that would ultimately result in the indictment of the Knights Templar. Pope John XXII issued his Papal Bull Spondent pariter in 1317, after the trial of the Knights Templar. It condemned all magic."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":" 200 Following this, in 1380, Charles V of France forbade the possession of furnaces and apparatus necessary for chemical processes. Finally, Nicholas Eymerich decisively condemned alchemy as demonic in 1396. Although suppressed, clandestine alchemy continued unabated in the monasteries. Informally, the Church condoned its priors spending monastery revenue on alchemy to manufacture counterfeit currency. The Church never charged any of these priors with heresy. The English Parliament finally outlawed alchemy between 1403 and 1404 because Edward II employed a number of alchemists to counterfeit coin of the realm. Parliament legislated that the multiplication of gold and silver was punishable as a felony with sentences of death and forfeiture of goods. Although the English Parliament had banned alchemy, the Parliament itself sought to gain from it and established Parliamentary Commissions in 1456 and 1457 to ascertain whether alchemy could be a feasible method of paying off national debts. Shortly afterwards, Richard Carter was issued a license for alchemy in 1476. 755 He experimented with all kinds of metals and minerals. As late as 1680, Sir Isaac Newton was quietly experimenting with alchemy, whilst administering the Royal Mint. Success evaded Monarchy, Church and Parliament. Conventional wisdom came to regard alchemy as foolish at best and simply too tempting and wasteful because of the inherent greed of men: 756 Therefore the lesser evil is to abandon it, and to exert oneself in other good arts. Freemasonry eventually adopted this advice. Earlier on, this same advice would have been wise counsel for the Knights Templar. We shall soon see why they were condemned as heretics and their Grand Master burnt at the stake. We will look at the processes of traditional wet and dry alchemy before turning to these events."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":" 201 Chapter 14 Ancient Alchemy The name Alchemy most likely derives from the Arabic al-kimia or the Egyptian chem or khem meaning the stars. 757 In Greek, the root Chymia means to fuse or cast a metal. The most literal meaning in modern idiom is perhaps God ’ s mineralogy, metallurgy and chemistry . Alchemy is the art of preparing the Philosophers ’ Stone from gold. The chemical symbol of gold is the same as that of God \u0001 . The professed uses of the Philosopher ’ s Stone were to extend life and to convert base metals to gold. Both objectives remain controversial. Aurum potable was a synonym for the Elixir of Life : Make gold potable, and you will have the universal medicine. There are two traditional ways of preparing the Philosophers Stone, the wet way and the dry way. The dry way takes only eight days using double philosophic mercury. Nicholas to Flamel says the practice begins as follows: 758 9. Take thou in the first place the eldest or first-born child of Saturn, not the vulgar, 9 parts; of the sabre chalibs of the God of War [iron], 4 parts. Put this latter into a crucible, and when it comes to a melting redness, cast therein the 9 parts of Saturn, and immediately this will redden the other. Cleanse thou carefully the filth that arises on the surface of the saturnia, with saltpetre and tartar, four or five times. The operation will be rightly done when thou seest upon the matter an astral sign like a star [the Star Regulus]. 10. Then is made the key and the sabre, which opens and cuts through all metals, but chiefly Sun, Moon and Venus, which it eats, devours and keeps in his belly, and by this means thou art in the right road of truth, if thou has operated properly. For this Saturnia is the royal triumphant herb, for it is a little imperfect king, whom we raise up by a philosophic artifice to the degree of the greatest glory and honour. It is also the queen, that is to say the Moon and the wife of the Sun: it is therefore both male and female, and our hermaphrodite Mercury. This Mercury or Saturnia is represented in the seven first pages of the book of Abraham the Jew, by two serpent encircling a golden rod. Take care to prepare a sufficient quantity of it, for much is required,"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":" 202 that is to say about 12 or 13 lbs. of it, or even more, according as you wish to work on a large or a small scale. The ancient Egyptians reputedly used the dry method and called it the Saturn Regime . 759 The black powder of Khemeia, derived from the chemistry of the stars , acted on kmt, or the black soil of Egypt. 760 To the priests of Egypt, Khemeia was the body of Osiris in the underworld and said to have marvelous powers. 761 Fragments from the writings of Heraclitus of Ephesus, a Greek philosopher who lived about 500BCE, suggest that the dry and wet methods have the same result: Pleasure of souls is to become wet 762 The dry soul is the best of all and the most wise 763 The way up and the way down are One and the same 764 The wet way , from Persia, is convenient because it only requires a simple flask, although it can take up to eighteen months to complete. Appendix 2 describes the wet way of the alchemist Roger Bacon. Bakr Ibn Bishrun, who lived around about 1000CE wrote of the wet method: 765 With God's blessing, here is the treatment: Take the noble stone. Deposit it in the cucurbit and alembic. Separate its four elements, which are water, air, earth, and fire. They are substance, spirit, soul, and dyeing. When you have separated the water from the earth and the air from the fire, keep each one apart in its own vessel. Take the dregs - the sediment - at the bottom of the vessel. Wash it with hot fire, until the fire has removed its blackness, and its coarseness and toughness have disappeared. Blanch it carefully and evaporate the superfluities of the humidities concealed in it. It will thus become white water, which contains no darkness, dirt, or disharmony. Then, turn to those primary elements that are distilled from it. Cleanse them, too, of blackness and disharmony. Wash them repeatedly and sublimate them, until they become fine, subtle, and pure. When you have done this, God has given you success. Roger Bacon, like many other medieval alchemists, found the key to alchemy in a book called Sirr al-Asrar or Secretum secretorum ( Secret of Secrets ) by the great Arabic physician Abu Bakr Mohammed ar-Razi (865-925 CE). After it appeared in about 1220 CE, Sirr al-Asrar became one of the most widely read books of the middle ages. ar-Razi classified minerals into six divisions: 1. Four spirits: mercury, sal ammoniac, sulphur and arsenic."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":" 203 2. Seven bodies: silver, gold, copper, iron, black lead (plumbago), zinc and tin. 3. Thirteen stones including marcasite, magnesia, malachite, tutty, talcum, lapis lazuli, gypsum and glass (of sand and alkali). 4. Seven vitriols including alum and white, black, red and yellow vitriols (the impure sulphates of iron, copper, etc). 5. Seven borates including tinkar, natron and impure sodium borate. 6. Eleven salts including brine, common (table) salt, ashes, naphtha, live lime, urine, rock and sea salt. Preparing the Philosophers' Stone by the wet method involves a number of stages. The first three of these stages are: 1. Prepare the Secret Fire , a nitrate catalyst. 2. Elicit and purify the white vapor of Mercury . 3. Dissolve the Sulphur and prepare the Philosophers ’ Stone. Sulphur and Mercury are not the substances we know by these names but metallic Gold and the vapor of Antimony respectively. Other allegorical names for this regal pair are the red man and his wife , our gold and silver , the Sun and Moon , Sol and Luna , earth and water and Star and the Sceptre . Preparing the Secret Fire was a major Arcanum of alchemy and essential to the process. It has had an enormous number of allegorical names such as: 766 The spirit; the spirit of life; the water of life; the water of our sea; the mineral water; burning water; ardent water. The fire; the secret fire; fire against nature; the invisible fire; our fire; the fire of snowy whiteness; a fire continuous; digesting, not violent, subtile, inclosed, aerial, surrounding, altering, yet not burning, clear, close, circulating, penetrating and alive.

The most elementary source of the Secret Fire is a salt nitrate from man. From al-Razi ’ s eleven salts, we can see that urine is the only salt from man. Urine is a very weak solution of ammonia and nitrates. 767 An average quantity of five hundred milliliters to two thousand milliliters passed in twenty-four hours includes 4.6 grams of ammonia, seven to seventeen grams of nitrogen and many inorganic and organic components. An initiate in the mysteries of alchemy who did not recognize the statement Know Thyself! was not an alchemist . Alchemists who did not know where to start their chemistry were the same as Rosicrucians who could not find their Order. They were simply initiates who had not yet properly found and accepted themselves, and got on with life. The only qualification for an alchemical Rosicrucian was to know that the solution was literally within him. A true Rosicrucian knew the philosophical mystery of I.N.R.I and that the hidden, nameless god labeled Osiris or Amun was the god within himself. Chapter 10 introduced this topic, which is also the subject of the next chapter. The philosophical use of urine has much in common with the methods of eastern monks. Initiates learn to manufacture a medicine from their own urine over a period of nearly 6 months. After removing putridity from the stagnant urine, a white powder remains. It is often mistaken for the alchemical Philosophers ’ Stone. Other homeopathic remedies recommend drinking urine or applying it in a shatnez bandage. The ancients, who didn ’ t have nitric acid, derived their nitrogen from ammonia in urine and/or from distillation of dung and bones to get sal ammoniac. Ammonium compounds behave as weak acids and alchemists usually enhanced them with saltpeter (potassium nitrate, KNO 3 )."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":" 205 Fishing for Coral from Atalanta fugiens"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":" 206 To achieve a more intense reaction the alchemists of old increased the ammonia and nitrate in the solution with niter. Ammonium nitrate is very soluble and a concentrated solution will dissolve metals, although the reaction is very slow with metals less active than iron. This is where one of the Gnostic interpretations of I.N.R.I applied: Igne nitrum raris invenitur , or Fire is discovered in nitrum . Niter is saltpeter, the mineral form of potassium nitrate ( KNO 3 ), found naturally as an efflorescent rock salt in caves and as short fibers on rock surfaces. Potassium nitrate oozes into the cellars of old buildings near stables or barns with ruminant animals. When distilled with urine, saltpeter produces glassy-white crystals of niter that are quite beautiful. Distillation of excrement and bones produces ammonium. Egyptian priests produced ammonium from dung, bones and horns at the Temple of Amun in Libya. 768 Their product was the salt of Amun , sal ammoniacus or ammonium. The nearby Temple of Amun, in the Egyptian Oasis of Siwa is a place of mystery. The Egyptian priests may have used their Libyan ammonium for sacred chemistry involving an important substance used in the Pharaonic Rite of Passage. The Egyptian priests mixed salts of niter (potassium nitrate) and sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride, NH 4 Cl , then given the symbol of salt, X ) to produce a universal solvent. The presence of ammonia in this Secret Fire is very important because of a polarization effect that produces dipoles to increase the solubility of gold salts. Ammonium chloride ( NH 4 Cl ) and ammonium nitrate ( NH 4 NO 3 ) are still used in modern cyanide-based gold leaching processes. Stibnite, the mineral of antimony, dissolves in similar solvents: ammonia hydrogen sulfide ( NH 4 HS ), potassium sulfide ( K 2 S ) and hydrochloric acid ( HCl ). The gases given-off can be very toxic. Even though alchemists talked of a nitrate salt, it was actually a synthetic mixture of oxidizing and non-oxidizing acids. Today we produce this same odd combination of oxidizing and non-oxidizing acids by mixing one part by volume of nitric acid ( HNO 3 ) with three parts of hydrochloric acid ( HCl ). The result is Aqua Regia . 769 The great title of Aqua Regia derives from its ability to dissolve noble metals, particularly gold and platinum. Gold is inert to either of the component acids used separately. Aqua Regia is a powerful solvent because of the combined effects of the H + , NO 3 - , and Cl - ions in solution. These three ions react with gold atoms to form water, nitric oxide ( NO )"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":" 207 and the stable chloride ion ( AuCl 4 - ), which remains in solution. The chloride ion gives the solution a light green tint. While the alchemists cheered at synthesizing a solvent for gold, which they thought was the first step to the Philosophers ’ Stone, many failed to realize that they had created the highly explosive substance fulminating gold. This compound results from adding ammonia to Auric Hydroxide, which is the precipitate formed when potash (Potassium Carbonate) is added to gold dissolved in Aqua Regia. Really, gold is soluble in any solution that contains both a chloride ion and an oxidizing agent. Even common salt (NaCl) or laundry bleach (calcium hypochlorite) will provide a free chloride ion. Hydrochloric acid and ammoniac solutions also directly dissolve gold at seventy-five degrees Celsius. This requires an oxidizer such as cupric ammine, oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, or sodium hypochlorite. 770 Even at relatively low temperature, hydrochloric acid and hypochlorite produces chlorine, which provides a highly oxidizing environment. Hydrogen peroxide oxidizes when added to metallic gold in aqueous hydrochloric acid. Electron transfer directly creates the ion species AuCl 4 - , AuCl 3 ( OH 2 ), and AuCl 3 ( OH ) - . 771 Oxidation by hydrogen peroxide is a dangerously exothermic process leading to explosions. The advantage is that the process avoids nitrogen compounds, which are difficult to remove in the traditional wet process. A number of metals will dissolve gold, when the metals are at their melting point, for example metallic mercury (Hg) will dissolve a small amount of gold at room temperature. In about 1120 or 1150 CE, Artephius wrote of a process for dissolving gold in a particular metal. Shortly, we will look further into his method. First, we must look for the prima material, the starting point for Philosophical Mercury. An elusive alchemist called Fulcanelli riddled for us the common name from which Mercury has traditionally been prepared. He says it is an approximation, corresponding to the Oak tree and to the ram. 772 We will try to solve this riddle because it provides us with a unique insight into the fractal nature of hermetic drift . Fulcanelli suggested that we focus on the gall apples on the leaves of the oak. The Apple tree or Quert is associated with the Oak and the Oak is of the genus Quercus and generally linked with the God Q're . We know that apple trees have a deep mythical significance. In Thessaly, visiting Hyperborean Druids noted the apple tree and associated"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" 208 Dionysian goat-stag, the hiero-cervus, as their own symbols of man ’ s resurrection and hope for immortality. 773 The apple tree is also the Great Triple Goddess ’ symbol of immortality. This apple is the Cydonian apple or quince. 774 From this, the apple is elevated to the symbol of God because the Triple Goddess gives the apple of immortality to the young goatherd Ida . He is the young Dionysus, who was twice born. 775 The Greek words for apple and goat are the same (melon) and one of Dionysus ’ titles is the Kid . 776 Hercules, who combines Dionysus and Apollo into one, was also Melon. This was because the three Daughters of the West , the three guardian nymphs of the Holy Apples , really the Triple Goddess, gave him a bough of golden apples. 777 The goddess of the sacred grove is Nemesis. She carries the wheel of the solar year and an apple bough as a gift to her Heroes. 778 In later myth, she became the instrument of divine vengeance on proud kings. 779 The Greater Mysteries reiterated the symbolism of the golden apples. The neophyte received a golden bough as the sign that he was near the end of his testing. In the Initiation of Plato : 780 The Ceryce: Plato! Throw away that crown and take this golden branch, and deign to follow me. Knowest thou who is the most happy of all men? Plato: The most – the most happy of all men. According to Socrates, the most just; according to me the most liberal. The Ceryce: And the most modest? Plato It is he who understands himself the best. And later ... First Patriarch: Who is this foolish mortal who comes thus to trouble our mysteries? The Ceryce: Sublime Patriarch, it is the Neophyte, Plato of Athens; he bears the golden branch. First Patriarch: Let him enter if his conscience is pure. Only the apple tree mythically entangles the sacred white unicorn. 781 It is the tree of immortality through Wisdom . The apple tree represents the pure virgin called Wisdom. It is therefore the Tree of Knowledge and symbol of consummation. 782 The Pomegranate Apple or Love Apple halved cross ways shows a five-pointed star, the emblem of immortality. It represents the goddess Venus in her five stations from Birth to Initiation, Love, Repose and"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" 209 Death. Chapter 18 showed that it also indicates the order of the five centre vowels in Yahweh's name. 783 Although the drift possibilities with the Apple tree are extensive and engaging, we are no nearer the solution. We must return to the start of the riddle find another drift or current that will lead to a solution. Fulcanelli hinted that we should specially note the Oak tree that nourishes the kerm. This is the Gaulish kerm-oak. It is the scarlet-oak or holly oak ascribed to Nergal and Mars. 784 The kerm of this tree is actually a scarlet female cochineal insect Coccus ilicis or Kermes vermilio from which the Greeks extracted royal scarlet dye. 785 The counterpart of the kerm-oak is the terebinth tree or pistachio - oak, which is Abraham's tree. In sacred groves, the Kerm King and Terebinth King are twins and rivals for the affection of the Great Goddess. In ancient tradition, the Kerm King murders the Terebinth King and the son of the Terebinth King takes revenge on his uncle at the September New Year celebration. The son then becomes his principal mourner and inherits the kingdom. Shakespeare's masterpiece Hamlet echoes this very ancient plot where the Goddess-wife betrays her sacred king husband, who the tanist killed and the son avenged. 786 Nevertheless, the distraught son does not punish his adulterous mother because she acted with the authority of the Mother Goddess. Shakespeare was probably alluding in veiled allegory to the famous English instance of this plot. Roger Mortimer killed King Edward II at Berkley Castle in September 1327, consorted with Edward ’ s wife, Queen Isabella, and alienated Edward III from his throne. Edward III ’ s tortuous dilemma was precisely Hamlet ’ s dilemma that his mother ’ s second marriage would alienate his royal rights. 787 Hamlet ’ s indecision followed the myth of The Epigoni , the seven sons of the seven champions that fell at Thebes who swore to avenge their fathers. 788 This didactic myth teaches the instability of women ’ s judgment, the folly of men in humoring their vanity or greed, the wisdom of listening to seers who are beyond suspicion, the danger of misinterpreting oracles and the inescapable curse that falls on any son who kills his mother, even to placate his father ’ s ghost. 789 Eriphyle, as she lay dying, cursed Alcmaeon: 790 Lands of Greece and Asia, and all of the world: deny shelter to my murderers! The patriarchal Indo-Hittites who invaded of the Mother Goddess ’ realm wrongly characterized these age-old themes as parricide"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" 210 and incest. 791 It was the priests ’ intention to invalidate the Mother Goddess ’ religious axiom that motherhood is more diving than fatherhood. 792 The kerm-oak or Holly Oak is an evergreen twin of the common oak called Dann or Tann , and is the equivalent of the Gaulish word for Oak, Tinne . 793 Tinne is also the name of the Green Knight who appeared in the old English Christmas Play . He is the beheaded Fool who rises unhurt. 794 This represents the survival of the Roman festival of Saturnalia , which is the ancient myth of the emasculation of Uranus by his son Cronos or Saturn. In turn, Zeus or Jupiter, who is the son of Cronos, exacts vengeance upon his father by banishing him to the Western Underworld. 795 The little rough gall-apples on the oak leaves are called gall , or in Latin Galla . Galla in Sumerian means womb . It also describes the KUR who are spirits of the underworld. 796 The word Galla also suggests galena , which is lead sulfate ( PbS ). The ancient Egyptians knew of galena and used it along with stibnite as cosmetic eyeliner and eye shadow. 797 They mined it at Gebel Rasas , which means Mountain of Lead . It is located at the southern edge of the Nubian Desert on the Red Sea. This is now in modern Sudan, three hundred and eight kilometers east of Atabora. 798 The mineral galena is the primary source of lead or Saturn. The alchemical importance of galena is that it is auriferous (bears gold) and produces considerable amounts of antimony when it is refined. Other impurities include copper, zinc, silver, arsenic and selenium. In Chapter 8, we saw that in Harran the Temple of Saturn was hexagonal and built of black stone. The cult image was of lead. Its throne was on the highest dais, which had nine steps. 799 The mineral of lead is certainly appropriate for the Saturn Regime or Dry method. Chapter 7 mentioned that Shakespeare concealed Portia, the Virgin of Merchant of Venice, in lead. Isis ’ column at Nysa in Arabia also recorded: I am the eldest daughter of Saturn, most ancient of Gods ... This circumstantial evidence suggests that the prima materia we are searching for is quite likely to be galena, the mineral of lead sulfide. However, before we settle on galena as the prima materia of the wet method, we need to identify the link with the ram . Lead and tin have always been closely associated. The Egyptians regarded lead and tin as the same metal. Yet, Egyptian tombs often"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":" 211 contain items of tin rather than lead. The Gaulish word Tinne, for Oak, also implies the metal to which Fulcanelli alluded to might really be tin.

The ancient Phoenician dyers employed four species of shellfish that contained a sac of coloring matter: the Buccinum lapillus of Pliny, which is the Purpura lapillus or Purple haemastoma of modern naturalists, Murex trunculus , the plentiful Murex brandaris , and the sea snail Helix ianthina . 800 Reducing these mollusks with tin produced the malodorous dibromoindigitin , which is similar to the blue dye indigotin or woad . The best purple Dibapha cloth of the Tyrians was dipped twice, first in Murex dye and then in Buccinum . Tin is also associated with the oak-god Jupiter. The Temple of Jupiter in Harran was triangular with a pointed roof. The stone used was green and the image of Jupiter was made of tin. It sat upon a throne on a dais raised eight steps high. Eight is the symbol of rejuvenation or reduplication being 2 x 2 x 2. It is the sacred numeral of the chief God, Tinne , in the Boibel-Loth calendar. 801 The Boibel-Loth calendar, with three hundred and sixty plus five days based on the number eight, replaced the ancient Beth-Luis-Noin calendar of three hundred and sixty- four plus one days, based on the number seven. The base-eight calendar corresponds to the eight-fold name of the God of Light, JEHUOVA Ō . 802 The whitish wandering planet identified with Tin has the singularly important name of Z-D-K meaning Zedek or Zadok . 803 The Jews claimed that the Gentiles profanely called it Jupiter. We investigated the importance of Zadok and Righteousness in Chapter 11. Jupiter and other thunder gods such as Hercules, Zeus, Duir, Janus, Thor, Bel, and Hermes are all oak-gods. 804 Yahweh in his aspects of El or Jah , which are interchangeable terms, is also an Oak-god. The Roman poet Virgil, who lived from 70BCE to 17BCE, mentions the roots of the Oak tree. He says they run as deeply into the ground as the branches rise to heaven. The oak is therefore highly reminiscent of the fundamental hermetic maxim as above, so below . In the dimension of time, the oak stands at the turn of the year. 805 The Oak tree therefore symbolizes the annual resurrection god who rules Heaven and the Underworld, the ram-headed god Osiris, Hercules and all immortal gods, particularly Amun-Ra. Therefore, our drifting has brought us to tin as another possible solution to Fulcanelli ’ s riddle. The mineral form of tin is cassiterite , tinstone or tin dioxide. So perhaps cassiterite , rather than galena , might"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":" 212 then be the ultimate mineral associated with both the Oak tree and the ram for the wet method. Tin became a familiar additive for copper after four thousand BCE. Crete exported tin to Mari in Akkadian times. In Chapter 5, we saw the extraordinary campaign by Ses ô stris I to obtain tin and other minerals in Anatolia. The many traditional mines in Anatolia and surrounding the Aegean, such as the Laurion field, produced low-grade tin, copper, lead and silver. 806 The Black Sea sortie of Ses ô stris I may have focused on the cassiterite mines at Kestel/G ö ltepe and Bolkarda ğ in the Taurus Mountains of Anatolia. 807 Cassiterite was highly prized in Egypt. Howard Carter found a golden box full of cassiterite in Tutankhamen ’ s tomb. 808 Even today, the mineral often substitutes for diamond because of its high luster and light dispersion. Three hundred years after Ses ô stris I, in one thousand five hundred BCE, Czech/German miners began to exploit the main high-grade cassiterite sources in central Europe. As we saw in Chapter 12, the Cornish sources so famous in Roman times began much later in one thousand BCE. However, cassiterite is an oxide rather than a sulfide like galena . It is normally a drab brown rutile ore like titanium dioxide found in quartz, granite and gneiss. Even rich ore contains only five percent of tin and good ore only two percent. The bulk of cassiterite is other oxide rock or sands with quartz, fluorite, topaz, wolframite and pyrite. As compelling as the case is for tin, it does not provide the necessary antimonial basis for alchemical Mercury we have been seeking. A modern analogy to Fulcanelli ’ s riddle is that the alchemists' white rabbitt lives in the burrow of Mother Earth ’ s womb, among the roots of the mighty Oak-King from which the underground stream flows. The solution to this riddle is more straightforward. Isaac Babbitt invented an excellent antifriction metal for bearings in 1839. Babbitt metal combines eighty-nine percent tin with seven percent antimony and four percent copper. The antimony provides our enigmatic rabbitt under the Oak tree. Chapter 11 and Chapter 12 showed the archetype of Azazel , Bezaleel or Aholiab the son of Ahisamach of Dan released to mankind the secrets of metallurgy, the manufacture of weapons and jewelry, and the use of antimony in art and medicine. He taught women the art of cosmetics. We earlier noted that the ancient Egyptians used both galena and stibnite as cosmetic eyeliner and eye shadow. Stibnite added sparkle"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":" 213 in particular. It was the black powder called Koh ’ l or al kuhl (pronounced alcohol ). Heightening the appeal of stibnite is that it is an ore found along with gold. The Magi attributed antimony to the Constellation of Aries, or the Ram, as this is the first heavenly sign in which the sun takes its elevation. 809 This provides Fulcanelli ’ s link with the ram that we originally sought with tin. So finally, we may settle on stibnite, the black powder of the Egyptians called Khemeia . We may conclude that the prima materia that leads to the White Virgin of Mercury, or antimony, is either galena or stibnite. It seems the Egyptians were unable to differentiate between the minerals. 810 The most prolific mineral for Mercury is the ore of antimony, stibnite. A more recent source of antimony is Babbitt Metal, which we could call the Jupiter method because Babbitt Metal is 89% tin and 7% antimony. As was previously mentioned, Artephius described the process of the Philosophers ’ Stone using Antimony in about 1120 or 1150 CE. It rapidly became the divine Wet Method of producing the Philosophers ’ Stone used by all the great alchemists. Antimony Trichloride is today widely used as an excellent non-aqueous solvent, especially for chloride- ion transfer-reactions. It avoids troublesome nitrates altogether by using chloride ion transfer. Artephius ’ methods involved two distinct processes, called the first and second Perfections. In the First Perfection, the alchemist worked to achieve two things: 1. Precipitating pure antimony from stibnite (Sb 2 S 3 ). Pure antimony, called the Regulus, forms when iron substitutes for antimony in the sulphide. The reaction is Sb 2 S 3 + 3 Fe >> 2Sb + 3FeS. Iron substitutes for antimony in the salts because iron is above antimony in reactivity. Iron sulphide (FeS) forms a ‘ mat ’ that is fused to the Regulus. The products readily part, as the Regulus is heavier than the fused mat of iron sulphide. Roger Bacon ’ s Tract on the Tincture and Oil of Antimonii outlines the use of iron (see Appendix 2). 2. Creating Antimony Trichloride (SbCl 3 ), which is a colorless, transparent liquid or white deliquescent solid. The trihalidation of antimony only commences when the Regulus moves into abundance. A pentachloride, (SbCl 5 ) coexists with the trichloride. The pentachloride sublimates at 4 º C and depresses the melting point of ‘ our Antimony Chloride ’ from 73 º C to about"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":" 214 35 º C. SbCl 5 is a reddish-yellow oily liquid with an offensive odor. It readily loses a halogen at room temperature to become the trichloride. It cannot be distilled on its own without decomposition. Antimony Trichloride is particularly unusual in that it is volatile enough to be distilled using glass vessels. Iced water chills the collection vessel. The alchemist first obtained stibnite from a mine. Minimum scoria (clinker in lava, refuse or dross) in the stibnite is best. He pulverized the stibnite to a powder with a hammer. The alchemist then obtained the First Agent, Ignis innaturalis (Natural Fire) or Secret Fire, which was the liquid nitrate salt borne by man, or simply urine. Alchemists enhanced this with a chloride such as the traditional ‘ muriate ’ of alchemists, ammoniac (Ammonium Chloride NH 4 Cl). As potassium salts are amorphous with ammonium salts, they kept nitrates out by using a potassium-based chloride called Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride KCl). Chloride of Potash is another name for Muriate of Potash. Nowadays, there are even stronger oxidizing oxymuriates, such as Chlorate of Potash, which is Potassium Chlorate (KClO 3 ), and Sodium Chlorate (NaClO 3 ). The old treatises that suggest adding Nitre, which is Potassium Nitrate KNO 3 , also called saltpeter, are in error. Nitre reacts with sal ammoniac to produce Potassium Chloride and Ammonium Nitrate in the reaction KNO 3 + NH 4 Cl >> KCl + NH 4 NO 3 . Therefore, this is just a long way around to produce KCl. Ammonium Nitrate decomposes to nitrogen (N 2 ) and water. However, the alchemist should particularly avoid Nitre because KNO 3 dissolved in SbCl 3 produces the highly deadly reddish- brown gas NO 2 . Many people do not appreciate the great danger of exposure to this gas. While initial exposure may cause only pain in the lungs, death can occur a few days later from the resulting oedema. Other old treatises also suggest adding cream of tartar to make saltfire from sal ammoniac, salt of tartar and saltpeter . However, tartar is a flux for the Dry Method. It is very dangerous in the Wet Method. Salt of tartar added to Nitre plus stibnite creates gunpowder, which often explodes. Now, we return to the First Perfection, also called the distillation. The alchemist mixes the pulverized metals to form the Compost. Any mixture of metals is also a Rebis. It is placed into a distilling retort (say a 150ml flask empting into a 250ml receiver). The proportions are 3 parts"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":" 215 pulverized Stibnite; 1 part Iron powder; and 4 parts Secret Fire (urine with Potassium Chloride). The neck of the flask must be cooler than the base so the vapor of the Mercury will condense. If the neck is warmer, the vapor will expand too rapidly and explode the vessel. Alchemists call their vessels an Iimbic, Alembic, Kerotakis or Pelican. The alchemist gently heats the flask in a temperature controlled sand bath. The temperature range is 37 º C to 41 º C or blood heat, called ‘ the temperature of a hen on its eggs ’ and held constant for about 84 days. There is a slow reaction as the Compost absorbs the liquid in the first few days. It swells, and sweats with a ruddy appearance. This is the Rule of Saturn of the First Perfection. Eventually, a beautiful shiny star appears on the surface. This is the Regulus, which is pure antimony. The alchemists term Heat plus Dryness as ‘ Fire ’ . Only when the Regulus is formed does the Antimony Trichloride vapor arise and the ‘ cleaning ’ take place. Many alchemists erroneously assume that the Star Regulus of Mercury, this Star of Bethlehem or Morning Star at this point is the Holy Grail. The purified white vapor of Mercury , Shakespeare ’ s Portia, ultimately rises from the reaction. To the Alchemists this is ‘ Air, their term for Heat plus Humidity. It is the vapor of Antimony Trichloride that forms as a white ‘ metallic, volatile humidity ’ or sweat, similar to saliva. Alchemists call the vapor of antimony the ‘ Mercury of the Wise ’ , the ‘ white wife ’ or White Goddess of the First Perfection. When the gas is distilled, condensed and cooled in the receiver flask, it becomes a wondrously bright liquid. The alchemists call ‘ Cold plus Humidity ’ as ‘ Water ’ . Alchemists called Antimony Trichloride the ‘ water that does not wet the hands ’ . The condensed Antimony Trichloride is kept sealed in the receiving flask. It will fume slightly in air and is very corrosive, irritating and hygroscopic. This Mercury of Antimony Trichloride becomes the “ our vinegre ” or Secret Sophic Fire in the Second Perfection. The alchemist then separates the Earth from the Heat and the subtle from the gross. That is, when the Regulus is black with Iron Sulphide, the alchemist dries-off the water and removes the Regulus; which is the ‘ First Stone ’ , from the mat of Iron Sulphide. He also discards any oxide ‘ flowers ’ in the neck of the flask. The alchemist then pulverizes the Regulus with a hard mortar and pestle. In the Second Perfection, this Regulus will be called Mercury."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":" 216 The Philosophical Egg of the Second Perfection is formed from 8 drachms (28.8ml) of Azoth in a 100ml flask, which should fill the flask to ¼ . 811 The flask should have a thin narrow neck about six fingers high. The neck of the flask is hermetically sealed with a rubber bung because if something has to move the bung will be forced out. The Azoth, which is analogous to the Compost of the first Perfection, is made from a mixture (called a Hermaphrodite) of leaf Gold and Regulus, with the Secret or Sophic Fire of Antimony Trichloride. The Red Man of the second perfection is Gold. The ratio of the Hermaphrodite is Gold, 3 drachms (10.8ml), which is 2 ¼ teaspoons, with Regulus, 1 drachm (3.6ml), which is ¾ teaspoon. The alchemist forms the Azoth by adding 4 drachms (14.4ml), which is 3 teaspoons or 180 drops, of the Secret or Sophic Fire, liquid Antimony Trichloride from the 1st Perfection (remember, do not add Nitre to Antimony Trichloride!) A period called the Rule of Saturn takes 46 to 50 days to form the Black mass. In the period the alchemist repeatedly dissolves and coagulates ‘ Solve et Coagula ’ The alchemist keeps the Azoth at blood heat until it sweats and there is circulation. Always keep the heat moderate at say 37 º C to 41 º C but make sure the reaction actually starts. The Azoth of this phase sweats and the vapors or exhalations rise and fall (i.e. sublimates). When the sweat returns to the Azoth as rain, it perforates it and the Azoth desiccates or bursts in a bloody broth. With time, the moist slime changes to a dry coagulated substance. The alchemists term this ‘ Cold plus Dryness ’ as ‘ Earth ’ . The Lyon or Toad ’ s exhalations are the vapors seen in the neck of the flask. It is at first white, then yellow, bluish and blackish. Yellow represents the copulation of the man and woman. Some alchemists visualized the changing colors as a battle between the vapors and the Earth. They often compared it to two fighting dragons, one with wings and the other without. It is also likened to the two snakes of Hermes, which are the conjunction of opposites. Seven or eight successive volatilizations are necessary. Each follows sublimation. Some alchemists call the volatilizations Eagles. These Eagles feed on the Lyon and drip back down on the Earth as dead eagles. In addition, it is symbolized as a pelican feeding its young with its own blood. Eventually the Earth puffs-up, fully putrefied. A phase of calcination begins, which to leads to the black or Nigredo. The fumes cease. The Earth bursts and reduces into a into a"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":" 217 coal-black powder called the Crows Bill or the Raven, which swims in the dead sea. This is a major milestone called the Nigredo. Later, it will yield up the white stone. The Nigredo brings the end of the Rule of Saturn. The Rule of Jupiter begins. It takes about 56 to 60 days more to achieve the Peacock ’ s Colors. The alchemist slowly increases the temperature to fever heat to 41 º C. A water washes the Nigredo. It is called ‘ Diana naked ’ . Beautiful colors appear, very like the refraction of light on spilt oil. Alchemists know this as the Peacock ’ s Tail. It signals the end of Jupiter ’ s Rule. The Rule of Luna now begins. It takes 22 to 24 days more in Luna ’ s Rule to achieve the Second Stone, which is when the earth turns white. This is also called the ‘ albedo ’ , luna white or white dove. It floats on the water like a cream and grows more and more glorious for 20 to 22 days. This cream can be gathered and gently heated to evaporate the water, leaving fragrant white oil. This oil was the famous salve or universal unguent of the Knights Templar. It has been of widespread medicinal virtue until the advent of modern pharmaceuticals. The cream cured maladies such as gout, leprosy, stroke, dropsy, epilepsy, consumption and dehydration to fever and pestilence (see Appendix 2, Roger Bacon ’ s Method). The Rule of Venus (or love) is 40 to 42 days more with heat increased to 66 º C to 77 º C (150 º F to 170 º F). The King (gold) unites with the Queen (albedo). The Queen is also called Philosophical Mercury, rosa alba (the white rose). In uniting, the king and queen remove impurities from each other. The King and Queen produce the Green Lion. The Rule of Mars is 42 days, in which the Green Lion is overcome with azure, grey, citrine and finally changes to another red Hermetic Mercury. The Earth is red and called ‘ Sulphur ’ . The red Sulphur fixes the white Mercury and they dissolve into liquid state. The glorious Rule of Sol flavus is 40 to 42 days more with the temperature increased to between 100 º C and 121 º C (212 º F to 250 º F). In a moment the Tyrian color comes. It is a sparkling red oil of fiery vermillion. Alchemists call it the Red Rose; the perfect fixation and perfection; the Red Poppy of the Rock; and the precious tincture. This is at last the Philosophers ’ Stone or ‘ Third Stone ’ . When powder forms from the solution, the alchemist slowly increases the temperature to 150 º C (300 º F)."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":" 218 The red powder is gold chloride, although in its pure form gold chloride is an orange-red color. Gold chloride is particularly useful for medicinal purposes because when taken into the body the chloride acts as a dispersing agent in the stomach and makes the body capable of absorbing the compound. A major controversy continues over how safe it might be to ingest gold compounds. Some say homeopathic gold chloride is safe while chemical gold chloride, used as a medication for arthritis, may not be safe since the metallic gold precipitates out in the human body due to the body ’ s own pH. The wisest advice is always to fully understand the medical effects of any metals before ingestion. Traditionally, the blood red powder is the famous Philosophers' Stone and that it takes only a few days to multiply this powder into any additional amount of the red product. It is undoubted that the alchemists created this red-powder. For example, the noted alchemist Robert Boyle, who gave us Boyle ’ s Law of Gasses , bequeathed samples of red powder to Sir Isaac Newton and John Locke. Some alchemists say there is another lilac stone above the red, which is the true Philosophers ’ Stone. Whether these scientists managed to achieve the fabled lilac Philosophers' Stone in any significant quantity is another matter. In the second Perfection, alchemists seek to move gold through its oxidation states. Gold has five standard oxidation states but is mostly found in Au(I) and Au(III) compounds and complexes. These are uncombined gold, sulphide ore and arsenide ore. Refiners easily extract gold metal from simple compounds using cyanide complexes. In the commercial process for extracting gold from low grade ores, gold is oxidized in the presence of aqueous sodium cyanide: 4Au + 8NaCN + O 2 + 2H 2 0 -> 4Na[Au(CN) 2 ] + 4NaOH . The gold and sodium cyanide are then recovered in the presence of carbon 2 Na[Au(CN) 2 ] -> Au 2 + 2NaCN or zinc is added to release a gold metal precipitate: 2Na[Au(CN) 2 ] + Zn -> 2NaCN + Zn(CN) 2 + Au 2 . Natives in Indonesia, New Guinea and the Brazil still use the age-old metallic mercury (Hg) method. It recovers about two-thirds of the gold present. They wash to rock face with high-pressure water and break the ore in a hammer crusher; alloy the gold sediment with metallic mercury (called amalgamation) in a sluice-box; filter; and vaporize the mercury from the gold with heat. The mercury vapor that results can be"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":" 219 distilled and reused but is more often simply burnt-off. During the process, natives regularly inhale the poisonous metallic mercury vapor. Gold is unreactive, meaning it does not displace hydrogen from acids. Platinum is even less reactive. Therefore, oxidization of gold requires a very strong oxidant such as nitric acid, concentrated sulphuric acid or an ion transfer reaction the Secret Fire. Au(II) results from Au-Au bonding with ligands (such as halides or cyanide) holding the atoms together. Stepwise oxidation of gold by successive addition of halogens, such as chlorine, converts gold from simple Au(I), such as AuCl and Au2O, through to Au(II) with the Au-Au bond to Au(III). This produces various gold (III) chloride ions with antimony in the presence of Secret Fire. This takes place over a long period producing the colors of red (gold chloride), green beneath the red, and white as the doves in the green tree. Along the way, the alchemist removes antimony as a fragrant cream byproduct. As we saw in the last chapter, individuals, the Church, Monarchs and Parliaments experimented with alchemy in the quest for unlimited wealth. Transmutation or Projection is the process of converting large amounts of base metals such as lead and iron into gold. For transmutation, the alchemist melts metallic gold in a crucible. He then adds the red powder of the Philosophers ’ Stone in equal part to the crucible and pours the mixture into an ingot where it cools. The alchemist then breaks away part of the ingot and pours ten parts of heated Mercury onto it. He melts the new mixture. Finally, he tinges purged melted metal in a molten state to transmute it into pure gold. An adept can multiply the red powder ad infinitum. Theoretically, the amount of gold from transmutation is also infinite: 812 He therefore whom God has blessed with this talent, hath this field of content, which far exceeds popular admiration; First if he should live a thousand years, and every day provide for a thousand men, he could not want, for he may increase his stone at his pleasure, both in weight and virtue; so that if a man would, one man that is an adeptist, might transmute into gold and silver that is perfect, all the imperfect metals that are in the whole world; secondly, he may by this art make precious stones and gems, such as cannot be paralleled in nature, for goodness and greatness; thirdly and lastly, he hath a medicine universal, both for prolonging life, and curing all diseases, so that one true"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":" 220 adeptist can easily cure all the sick people in the world. I mean his medicine is sufficient. Yet, the success of physical transmutation has always been in doubt. Judah Ben Solomon declared that it was impossible in 1245. 813 Trickery produced small-scale transmutations. One technique involved adding to the crucible a small ball of wax or bitumen containing gold, to melt at the right moment. Medieval alchemists always found a reason for failing to turn the King's kitchen utensils into gold. They usually blamed corruption in the base metals provided for transmutation: 814 But many through ignorance doth mar what they made, When on metals uncleaned projection they make For because of corruption their tincture must fade, Which they would not away first from bodies take, Which after projection be brittle, blue and black: That thy tincture therefore may evermore last. Upon ferment thy medicine look thou first cast. Roger Bacon was an English philosopher and scientist who lived from 1214 to 1292. The alchemists accepted him as a great master of the art. 815 His play, The Alchemist , gives a wonderfully humorous insight into how misguided but enthusiastic practitioners compromised alchemy. In the end, alchemists became indistinguishable from charlatans. Appendix 2 contains Roger Bacon ’ s own alchemical methods. Some of the greatest philosophers and scientific minds of all time such as Baruch de Spinoza, who lived from 1632 to 1677, were prepared to believe in transmutation. The most likely reason for this may simply be that it is very difficult to distinguish real gold from salts, alloys, plating and fool's gold, which is iron pyrites or iron disulfide. 816 Alchemists carefully created many gold/silver/copper alloys, as the Incas in Peru did. 817 Indeed, most Egyptian artifacts from three thousand eight hundred BCE to 1085BCE were amalgams of gold and silver with up to ten percent copper. 818 The celebrated semi-transmuted coins of the alchemists are usually electrum plated. Other so-called gold substances produced by alchemists were often toxic metal salts that happened to have a yellow sheen such as lead antimonate ( PbSb 2 O 5 ) and metallic mercury ( Hg ) salts: 819 For gold of alchemy, made with corrosives, destroys the body - as Aristotle and many other philosophers have proven. It seems obvious that alchemical transmutation cannot be taken literally on a metallurgical level, else all humankind would be"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":" 221 unbelievably wealthy with gold and healthy into the bargain. This, of course, does not rule out that transmutation occurs in nuclear physics by the bombardment of atomic nuclei with neutrons. Intuition tells us that alchemical transmutation is not chemistry but didactic philosophy. Transmutation in alchemy can only be a hermetic process based on the perfection of metals, illustrated by symbols and veiled in allegory, designed to make good men better. Wisdom communicates from one man to the next without attenuation through use. This is symbolically the same as the lighting of candles by the congregation during the Paschal Praeconium in the Roman Catholic rites of Resurrection, celebrated at midnight on Easter Saturday. From the flame of the great Paschal Taper, the congregation lights multiple candles throughout the whole church. The great Taper though divided, suffers no loss from the communication of its light . 820 In the same way, the modern Olympic flame, ignited by priestesses in Athens with the rays of the sun, communicates with the Olympic host city. Zosimus of Panopolis, a highly regarded Jewish alchemist of about four hundred CE, clearly considers the Jews as the repositories of alchemical wisdom. 821 He suggested that they gained their sacred art from the Egyptians by surreptitious means. The infamous Jewish alchemist Count St. Germain, seems to confirm the Jews ’ illicit possession of alchemical knowledge. He wrote that Moses discovered a manuscript in an Egyptian monument that showed how to prolong life for more than a century. The manuscript was triangular in the same way the Sumerians codified the law of the God KUR on triangular tablets. 822 Moses concealed it in Asia under the device of a winged dragon. 823 Asia here probably refers to Byblos, identified with Gebal, which was the home of the Dionysian initiates in about one thousand six hundred BCE. 824 Appendix 11 provides a translation of this important manuscript. Saint Germain ’ s winged dragon is a magical talisman. Its tail lemniscates in a figure eight pattern and has a small head at its tip. The main head and the headed tail are pointing in opposing directions. The figure has wings and an arrow-shaped tongue protruding from the main head. It is one of three magical illustrations executed in gilt and several colors of ink. The symbol of the winged dragon refers to the legend of Hercules, glorious son of Jupiter and Alcmena. He fought and conquered the dragon at the entrance to the garden of Hesperides called Ladon. 825 "},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":" 222 Hercules was seeking the tree of life, the divine Apple tree in the Garden of the Hesperides that produced golden apples of felicity. 826 Mother Earth originally gave this tree with golden apples to the Great Goddess Hera as a wedding present. Hera placed the tree in her orchard on Mount Atlas with the Hesperides. 827 The three sweetly singing Hesperides were Hespere, Aegle and Erytheis. 828 Hercules' blade, reddened with the blood of the ferocious hundred-headed Ladon, who coiled around the apple tree, is the necessary key to enter the garden. 829 There the Hesperides, the Three Daughters of the West who really symbolize the great Triple or Mother Goddess, grant him wisdom. Such symbolism is patently alchemical with the Dragon, its blood and the golden Apple tree all being seen within an alchemist's flask during the Great Work. A sacrifice is necessary, but it is not always the Dragon. We will understand this further when we look at the legend of St George and the Dragon in Chapter 15. The aforementioned alchemist, Zosimus, was a highly passionate advocate for intellectual and academic honesty in alchemy. He inveighed against the jealousy, vanity and mean-spiritedness of those who concealed their alchemical wisdom asserting: ... everybody should possess a book of chemistry, which should not be hidden away. Zosimus openly criticized his contemporary Theosebia who kept her alchemical wisdom secret, only transmitting it under oath to small groups. Suggestive of the Mysteries and legends of St George, Zosimus clearly agreed that the procedures of alchemy are strictly preparatory to the purification and perfection of the soul. He wrote: 830 Perform these things until your soul is perfected. Another celebrated alchemist, Paracelsus lived from 1493 to 1534. He was born Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim but called himself both Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim and Paracelsus . Others honored him as the Swiss Hermes because he had learned the secrets of alchemy in Constantinople and from them developed the first cure for syphilis. In his Theory of Alchemy , Paracelsus proposed ritual Questions and Answers to confirm the perfection of the soul: 831 Q. What do the philosophers understand by their gold and silver? A. The philosophers apply to their sulphur the name of gold, and to their mercury the name of silver."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":" 223 Q. Whence are they derived? A. I have already stated that they are derived from a homogeneous body wherein they are found in great abundance, whence also they know how to extract both by an admirable process. Q. Is everything contained in this subject? A. Yes, but nature at the same time must be assisted, so that the work may be perfected and hastened, by means which are familiar to the higher grades of the experiment. Q. Is this subject exceedingly precious? A. It is vile and originally without native elegance. Fundamentally it is not saleable because it is useful in our work alone. Despite its complex chemistry determined by trial and error, medicinal success and high ideals, the prevailing view of alchemy has now become disdain. This is due to unremitting focus on alchemy ’ s more sensational aspects like counterfeiting and astrology. While it was the forerunner of modern chemistry, medicine and pharmaceuticals, these sciences have now subsumed the finest of the alchemists' art. Massive transmutation of metals to gold by tincture is clearly impractical. We must therefore ask if the real purpose of years of risky and dedicated work was simply to produce a somewhat limited quantity of red powder. There is perhaps a more ancient purpose of compulsive alchemy, in searching for something that was lost that long pre-dates the Aristotelian concept of perfection. In the next chapter, we look at earlier and increasingly arcane meanings in the art of alchemy."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":" 224 Chapter 15 St George and the Dragon In the last chapter, we saw that Hercules fought and conquered the dragon at the entrance to the garden of Hesperides. He was then able to enter and find the Apple tree that produced golden apples of felicity. There are many other representations of this same symbolism. For example, in the Treasury of the Residence in Munich a magnificent statuette dated 1586-1597 shows St George on a white charger plunging his crystal sword into a winged emerald green dragon (see frontispiece). The rubies over his enameled agate charger suggest blood and show the red cross of St George. This magnificent equestrian statue, fifty centimeters high, is the most gloriously jeweled object of its kind and the greatest achievement in late sixteenth century goldsmith work. 832 It originally housed a relic of St George given to Duke Wilhelm V, the Pious, by his brother Ernst, Archbishop of Cologne. They concealed this statue for thirty years, until 1617. Another famous literary representation of St George killing the dragon is Edmund Spencer's Faerie Queen . 833 Here the lovely woman Una brings her Knight of the Red Cross to the House of Holiness in which he finds Faith, Hope and Charity. Charity is the principal nature of the House. It is brotherly love, the Charity of God or manna . 834 The name Una means oneness and, co-incidentally, the three principles or neters are important clues in the rituals in the House of the Pharaoh Unas, described in Chapter 16. Prima facie, the killing of the dragon is simply the victory of good over evil. To the Church it was also the symbol of overcoming Tiamat, the Triple Goddess in her aspect as the destroyer Hecate or Demeter . The Pope uses the same allusion at a Consistory where the he elevates bishops, archbishops and priests to the College of Cardinals. As the Pope receives each candidate at his golden throne, he and hands the new cardinal a red biretta, the silk square-ridged hat that symbolizes his new rank as a prince of the church .

The hundred-headed hydra is just the same as the dragon. It is also called the Old Serpent , Lord of the Abyss , Leviathan , Lotan , Shaitan , Tiamat , Forsaker , Abandoner and Cthulhu . Sufi and Muqarribun writings make use of the term Abandoner referring to the power of Tajrid and Tafrid, which mean outward detachment and interior solitude respectively. The Greeks use the word Apollyon , Abaddon in Hebrew. 837 In Pompeii, this menacing dragon is shown both as a crocodile in the Villa of the Mysteries and the sea monster ketos in the legend of Andromeda and Perseus in the Mythological Room of the Imperial Villa at Boscotrecase. 838 Nicholas Poussin ’ s 1633 painting The Companions of Rinaldo , now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, shows the Christian knights Carlo and Ubaldo confronting the same fearsome dragon. This has the same meaning as the two warring knights in the Merchant ’ s Chapel of St Peters Church in Malmo, Sweden. Below them is a large picture of St George and the Dragon. A recent interpretation of the story of St George is George Lucas ’ blockbuster film Star Wars (1977). Initially, many studios rejected the script. It went on to gross two hundred million dollars and become the envy of the industry. Star Wars even redefined cinema in the twentieth century and became a popular trilogy. In the film, Daath-vader, so named after Daath meaning man ’ s knowledge , is man ’ s base nature or the Lover, balanced by his pure Son Luke Skywalker . Daath and Luke are two sides of the same coin. Swords of Light consummate their battle. Only initiates of the ancient Jedi Knights could wield these swords. So enduring and popular was the theme that George Lucas ’ used it once more in 1999, with the first of three prequels of a new Star Wars Trilogy. George Lucas is not alone in using this age-old theme. Michael Douglas ’ film The Game is an initiation sequence. Douglas conceals the dragon in a place worthy of the erudite complexity of Shakespeare. Gnostic Christianity modified the alchemy of the Greater Mysteries in a very imaginative way.

In this ceremony, it is the victor St George, who is sacrificed. 839 The killing of the dragon is, in fact, not a killing to death. When the sword of crystal light subdues the Dragon, the Knight of the Rose Croix becomes the perfect expression of life. This needs further illustration. In a bold defense of the Families of Love in 1580, called an Apology for the Service of Love , the Family describes how death is life. They assert that sin is repairable in life. The Apology is set as a three-way conversation in which the Exile , a Familist , seeks to convince two curious individuals that the Family of Love was neither heretical nor: ... the most detestable Sectaries or Hereticks, that ever reigned on the earth; yea, and as people not worthy to live in the Common- wealth. The Exile is seemingly a wild man , clothed in moss and coming from the mountains. He talks of Family Brethren walking upright, peaceably and brotherly amongst all people after their ritual: 840 To dye unto sin, to crucify the flesh with her lusts, to put on the new man of righteousness, to dwell in Christ and have him dwell in us, to have the same mind in us that was in Christ ... The odd character of the Exile in the Apology shows the author had a detailed and insightful knowledge of Ovid or the poems of Gilgamesh, written in about two thousand BCE. 841 Ovid variously describes how Perseus and Hercules enter the Garden of Hesperides. Hercules defeated the dragon at the gate. 842 Perseus defeated the giant Atlas, who is an archetype for the Exile . 843 In Gilgamesh and the Cedar Forest, a wild man called Enkidu is beguiled and persuaded to begin a new life among mortals. 844 Enkidu adapts to his new lifestyle but loses his strength and courage. Gilgamesh suggests that they seek out and kill Huwawa, a giant hideous monster with lion ’ s claws. Enkidu is hesitant but finally seeks out Huwawa at the mountain of cedars. Hu is the name of the cedar tree. The mountain of cedars is a forest of base natures. The fearsome alter ego of Enkidu dwells there. In a fit of rage, Enkidu kills his own base ego, as must the Rose Croix Knight. The Gnostic version maintains that instead of killing the Dragon, the Soul instead unites or merges with the Dragon via the crystal sword of light. This is not yet the sacred marriage. When pierced by the sword, the Dragon simply floats up the sword to merge with the Rose Croix"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":" 228 Knight. The united entity of Spirit and Soul takes the worldly form of the Dragon or, as San Francesco shows in his famous painting Crucifix , a Serpent. At this point, the united entity is characterized in two completely different ways. These are the Serpent and the Agnus Dei , or pure lamb awaiting ritual slaughter. The Gnostic Croix Knight, who has found his base nature, victoriously impaled it and merged with it, then prepares for the sacred marriage to the Goddess of Wisdom. The aspiring Knight of Holiness must wed her as Truth to regain life with a new purified Spirit. He must be reborn. The Goddess of Wisdom is the hermetic form of the goddess of death and love who is Aphrodite , Pallas Athena , Venus , Ishtar , Isis and Sophia . She is both the Lion Goddess and Water Goddess from an unusual event in astrological mythology associated with the real Gilgamesh, a Kassite-Hyksos Shepherd King who invaded Babylon. 845 He identified with the ancient legends of Gilgamesh and took on the symbol of the Ram because the relentless precession of the earth ’ s equinoxes had moved the sign of the Ram into the favored House of Spring in the Zodiac calendar. Amun and Yahweh followed Gilgamesh by taking the sign of the Ram. When the Ram pushed the Bull from the position of supremacy, the Crab simultaneously displaced the Lion at the Summer Solstice. As a result, the Love Goddess of the Summer Solstice left her Lion to become the Goddess of Water. We see this in Aphrodite ’ s birth from a seashell and the Virgin Mary reflected in many a convent garden pool. The Dragon, who has been female to this point, is now hermaphrodite , meaning both female and male. It takes on the male aspect of the Knight and prepares to mate with the Goddess of Wisdom. In the contrived process of mating, the Dragon disappears and all that remains is the purified, reborn Knight as the beneficent Star of Life , also called Phosphorous, meaning the bringer of light . 846 The Soul, of course, never dies and remains constant throughout the process. Revelation portrays this scene. 847 The number 666 is the number of a man and represents his Spirit: 848 Here is wisdom.

The Gematria sum of the Hebrew translation RSQ NWRN is 666. A rather complex solution to the puzzle uses the Atbash Cipher (see Appendix 10). The number 666 is the Atbash Cipher code for alphabetically transforming the Spirit ( RWCh ) to the spiritually pure Elohim ( ALHYM ). 849 Gematrists perceive the number 666 as six, six and six as in the combination of a safe. They transform the letters of the Spirit, RWCh (Ruach), through six places by cyclic rotation. RWCh becomes DLB , which is a Notaricon acronym for the Holy Alphabet (Aleph, Beth, and Lamed). Ch rotates by six to B, the first letter in BYTh . W rotates by six to the middle letter L in Aleph ( ALPh ), which is not a vowel but a consonant. R similarly maps to D, the last letter in Lamed ( LMD ). Thus, the Holy Alphabet is the Key to Resurrection. Finally, DML PhLA ThYB maps through the Atbash Cipher to Elohim ( ALHYM ). 850 Dante provided a straightforward solution in the Inferno . 851 The letters in the dragon ’ s name Apophis sum to 667. The victorious knight who vanquishes his own spirit, cuts-off the head of the dragon. Dante sees this as cutting-off the initial letter A from the name Apophis. The value of A is one so the remainder is 666. This is the age-old battle of Ra and Apophis in Egypt, Apollo and the Python in Greece, Thor and the serpent in Norse sagas, the Hittite storm god and a serpent on New Year ’ s Day, Enlil and Tiamat in Mesopotamia, Tishtrya and Apaosha in Iran, Indra and Vritra in India, Maui and Tuna in Polynesia and many other myths. 852 We now return now to the mating of the dragon and Goddess. The Goddess proceeds to destroy the Dragon embodying the Knight ’ s Spirit. At this point, the Gnostic ritual diverges from the ancient sacred marriage. In ancient times, the Knight would have been bound to an oaken Tau cross, representing God ’ s Divine Law, using the five-fold bond that joins wrists, neck and ankles together. 853 Flayed and hacked to pieces, the sacrificial king would become a Eucharist. A new son would have been naturally born of the Goddess after nine months gestation. Indeed, the purpose of priestess ’ sexual orgies was to ensure that at least one became pregnant for this outcome. In the Gnostic version, it was desirous to avoid the actual death of anything real, let alone murder the initiate. Instead, the Goddess ’ love destroyed his Spirit by figurative crucifixion on a Tau cross. The"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":" 230 crucifixion scene shown to the Knight is the same as San Francesco ’ s Crucified Serpent or the image of the serpent of bronze that Moses hung on his staff, the nehushtan . Another Serpent was born from the ashes of the Knight ’ s crucified Spirit. As this was an Easter ceremony, this new Serpent laid the glain or red egg , which the Goddess ate. 854 With the Goddess fertilized one way or another, the Rose Croix Knight was reborn in life as described by the Family of Love . The newborn issue of the sacred marriage emerged in the Rose Croix Knight as the new King. The Dervish maxim is: 855 The man must die that the saint may be born. The modern song Hero expresses the same sentiment: 856 Search for the hero inside yourself. Search for the secrets you hide. Search for the hero inside yourself. Until you find the key to your life. Ovid tells a legendary story of rebirth in the Doctrines of Pythagoras, where the Phoenix of Assyria renews and begets itself: 857 This bird, when five long centuries of life Have passed, with claws and beak unsullied, builds A nest on a loft-swaying palm; ... Then from his father ’ s body is reborn A little Phoenix, so they say, to live The same long years. When time has built his strength With power to raise the weight, he lifts the nest – The nest his cradle and father ’ s tomb – As love and duty prompt, from that tall palm And carries it across the sky to reach The Sun ’ s great city, and before the doors Of the Sun ’ s holy temple lays it down. The new King was his own Horus or Christ that was always latent within the Knight Rose Croix, thus the Gnostic interpretation of I.N.R.I being Jesus reigns within us. Jesus sayings, found in the primitive Gospel of Thomas, mirror this: 858 Jesus said, \"If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you.\""},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":" 231 Consistent with this, the Gospel of Philip maintains that resurrection of the spirit occurs before death and there is no resurrection after death. A Greek Orthodox cleric readily confirms the meaning of Easter: 859 We contemporary Christians should realise that the Resurrection of our Lord does not concern the dead but rather those who are still alive ... the victory of the Lord ’ s sacrifice over moral and spiritual death ... has nothing to do with the physical phenomenon we call “ death ” in our daily life. In 1429CE, Phillip the Good, Duke of Burgundy and Earl of Flanders, instituted the Order of the Golden Fleece. Excepting that its membership increased from thirty to seventy-eight, the Order remained unchanged for nearly four centuries. In some countries, such as Sweden, it became the most prestigious order of knighthood of its time. In 1469, forty years after the Order of the Golden Fleece was established, King Lewis IX created another important French Order, the Order of St Michael. 860 This Order traces the legend of St Michael ’ s worldly twin, St George. Its motto Immensi tremor Oceani means an immense shaking in the waters. The Order ’ s collar was composed of scallop-shells of gold. The jewel on the collar is a hillock on which St Michael tramples the Dragon. Pope Leo X, the Medici ’ s high Renaissance maecaneas, contributed to the Order in 1518. Pope Leo presented King Fran ç ois I with two of Raphael ’ s paintings, Saint Michael and the Holy Family , both of which now hang in the Louvre. 861 King Henry III of France established the Ordre du Saint-Esprit or Order of the Holy Ghost in 1578. 862 Henry ’ s purpose was to bind the French nobility to his side in the midst of religious turmoil. This included the now infamous Bartholomew ’ s Day Massacre. on 24 August 1542 where Henry III ordered the murder of hundreds of Protestants who were in Paris for the wedding of his sister Marguerite to the Huguenot leader, Henri de Navarre. The Order of the Holy Ghost became the most prestigious of all France ’ s chivalric Orders. Its emblems were a dove, knots of gold and the Fleur de Lys. The evening before a French Knight received this Order, he became an initiate of the Order of St Michael. The old French Ecossais Master or Architect ’ s Catechism follows the twin Orders of St Michael and the Holy Ghost.

If successful, he becomes a Knight Quadosh . Quadosh signifies Holiness, Dedication and Sanctification. 864 He is also called a Knight of the Feast of the Brotherhood because his ordeal is celebrated by the Feast of the Brotherhood held on Passover Eve, also known as the Agape or pure Feast of Brotherly Love. We shall discuss Moses ’ nehushtan further in Chapter 18. 865 It is, however, worth noting that the crucified serpent continued to be a very important image representing the crucifixion of Spirit on the cross of Divine Law, so the seed within the Spirit, that sinneth not , could emerge. Even Sir Francis Bacon, who wore the black hat of knowledge, chose the device of a serpent on the anchor of peace , as shown in the Crucified Serpent from the titlepage of The Faerie Queen, Part II (1617, dated 1613). Sir Francis Bacon ’ s foster father, Sir Nicholas Bacon, was responsible for the appointment of a prominent Family of Love personage, Robert Seale to court office. 866 The Bacon and Seale families both kept country houses at St Albans. Given these close ties, it is not surprising that Sir Francis Bacon was to use the Family ’ s symbolism of resurrection on earth in the Knights Rose Croix ceremony of St George. There is another confirmation of the close philosophical ties between Sir Francis Bacon and the Family of Love . While inveighing against moral injustices in the High Commission ’ s application of the law, Sir Francis Bacon was to call upon a substantial portion of the Family of Love ’ s Petition to James 1 . 867 The word Shakespeare is interchangeable with the identity of all dragon-slayers. It often describes St George. 868 Somewhat in confirmation of this, Shakespeare is reputed to have been born and to have died on twenty-third day of April, St George ’ s Day."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":" 233 Crucified Serpent from the titlepage of The Faerie Queen, Part II (1617, dated 1613)"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":" 234 The name William has additional significance since it derives from Hwyll , or Hu the cedar tree we saw in the poem of Gilgamesh. The final syllable is Helm, meaning helmet. It therefore means the glorious helmet of knowledge or Wisdom. Knight-heroes that attain their goal receive the same glorious helmet of invisibility worn by Pallas Athena. Only the true initiate can wear this glorious helmet. It hides the Countenance of the Lord from the profane. In 1605, the Brothers of the Rosy Cross circulated in Europe a manuscript titled The Restoration of the Decayed Temple of Pallas . 869 It contained their constitution. The cabalistic number of Rose Cross Knights was the perfect number one hundred. 870 Knights Rose Croix often signed themselves as 100 men, Century-men or C-men . The latter is also a humorous play on the Gnostic equivalence of semen and the carnal element in their ritual. They also used the device of a Pythagorean comma ‘ , ’ to represent their perfect number of one hundred. One hundred is also the exact Greek meaning of the name of Triple Goddess, Hecate, in her aspect of death. 871 Each of the hundred was a single lunation. One hundred lunations made up the Great Year of the Triple Goddess, at the close of which she ritually sacrificed the king. 872 We see the Knight Rose Croix and the Triple Goddess interacting in Shakespeare ’ s consummate play, King Lear. It drew on Geoffrey of Monmouth ’ s legend of King Lear, the king who seemingly divided the Kingdom of Britain into two parts. 873 Geoffrey of Monmouth says he obtained his mysterious book of histories from Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford. King Lear ’ s desperate attempt to avoid the sacrificial fate of kings has its origins in the ancient Triple Goddess ritual. To avoid death, or at least defer it for nineteen years, the king divided his kingdom into three parts and awarding one part to each of his successors. 874 The Judgment of Paris influenced Shakespeare. 875 In this archaic legend, Paris, awards his apple to Aphrodite who is the fairest of three goddesses: Athene the maiden, Aphrodite the nymph and Hera the crone. However, Shakespeare has realized that this is the wrong way around, as Homer and Hesiod knew. It is Aphrodite awarding the apple to Paris at the price of his life. The apple is Paris ’ passport to the Elysian Fields, which admits only the souls of heroes. Eve awards the same apple to Adam."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":" 235 Cinyras and Smyrna shows the correct orientation of the legend. In this myth, King Cinyras extended his reign beyond eight years by marrying his youngest daughter, the birth-goddess Smyrna. 876 In the normal scheme of things, another princeling would marry her and thereby inherit his kingdom. In other cases of planned prolongation, kings sought to increase the period of their sovereignty by giving away two thirds of their kingdom. 877 For example, Actor and Proteus both divided their kingdoms into three parts, retaining only one part and bequeathing the other two thirds to their successors. 878 In the Preface of this book, the author undertook to warn readers about outlandish hypotheses. Here is a major challenge: Geoffrey of Monmouth ’ s histories seem to bear little relationship to known historical facts. This may be because they are often about important events in Egypt two thousand years before his time. If this is indeed the case, these events had monumental importance for the Israelites, as we saw in Chapter 6. Shakespeare ’ s King Lear may well be the same age-old story that had its greatest moment in history in the twenty-first dynasty of Egypt, which divided the Kingdom of Egypt in 1075BCE. Thebes ruled Southern Egypt and Tanis, in the far northeast of the Delta, governed the new independent North Egypt. The folly of division weakened both states and opened Egypt to a Libyan invasion in 945BCE. The Libyan Pharaoh Shoshenq I overthrew all Egypt. This hypothesis explains the real inspiration behind the well known, despairing, yet unprovable legend of the division of Solomon ’ s kingdom between Solomon ’ s son Rehoboam and an official of Solomon ’ s court called Jeroboam. 879 The division of the kingdom between Rehoboam and Jeroboam may really be an allegory of the acrimonious rift between the parallel Israelite religions of Levite Judaism in the South and universal hermetic religion of the Tribe of Dan at Panias in the North. Now we look at division of the kingdom in the English context. In 1292, King Edward I of England faced the great cause of Scotland , whether he should divide Scotland. 880 His judges needed to decide a difficult question, whether the kingship of Scotland should be awarded to a representative of one of the three co-heiress daughters of David earl of Huntingdon (the younger brother of William the Lion) or partitioned between them. This was to rule on two important issues. The first was divisibility of the kingdom and the second was the proper moral and legal solution to a clash between Western primogeniture and the ancient"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":" 236 Israelite principle of ultimogeniture observed by the Scots. At issue was whether the son (Robert Bruce) of a younger daughter had a better right to the kingship of Scotland than the grandson (John Balliol) of an elder daughter. The Scotts called Robert Bruce of Annandale The Competitor . Eighty Scottish assessors, appointed equally by Robert Bruce of Annandale and John Balliol, failed to resolve the matter and it was turned over to Edward I. Edward I ’ s judges upheld English usage on succession, primogeniture, that the issue of an elder line must become exhausted before succession could pass to that of a younger line. After his loss, Robert Bruce pursued his second option, which was to split Scotland into its three original components of Lothian, Alban and Strathclyde and award these to the representatives of the three co-heiresses. He again lost the argument. Edward I ’ s judges decided the kingdom of Scotland was indivisible and impartiable. In this decision, however, Edward I unwittingly established the basis of Scotland ’ s future independence. We can clearly see Shakespeare ’ s King Lear reflected in Robert Bruce ’ s dilemma. He was eighty-one years old. Having been the nominated king and now all-but lost his kingdom due to Edward I ’ s legal ruling and his advanced age: would he seek to split the kingdom between the daughters, with the youngest one (his own line) receiving the choicest piece, or would he see the kingdom go in whole to a younger king? He endeavored to split the kingdom but as with Shakespeare ’ s King Lear, Robert Bruce The Competitor lost all. He died in 1294 but the Scots crowned his grandson Robert the Bruce king in 1306 and sixty five years later, in 1371, his great-great grandson Robert II, became the first Alanic Stuart king. Perhaps even more topical for the Elizabethans of Shakespeare ’ s time was the political folly of splitting the mighty kingdom of France. Jean le Bon, John the Good, in an acute lack of wisdom, divided the kingdom of France between the three younger brothers of the Dauphin Charles V, the Dukes of Berry, Anjou and Burgundy. Indeed, this division led to England winning the Hundred Year ’ s War (1337-1453) after the Duke of Burgundy sided with England to protect his lucrative Netherlands wool trade. There is no more compelling elaboration of Shakespeare ’ s brilliant dimensions – legal and esoteric - than his play King Lear. We have seen the legal dimension and now we turn to the esoteric."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":" 237 Shakespeare ’ s King Lear was aged and infirm with no son to replace him. He desperately sought to divide his kingdom among his three daughters to avoid his sacrificial fate in favour of a younger king. All he sought to retain was a troop of one hundred men for protection. He was a hundred-man . King Lear ’ s three daughters represent the Triple Goddess. To succeed with his plan he needed to experience the carnal love of the Goddess, which is the professed love of each of his daughters. In this way, he could satisfy the requirement of carnal involvement with the Goddess, without actually being involved. Shakespeare employs an exquisite Baconesque legal fiction. In return for a portion of the kingdom, each daughter is required to swear that King Lear has priority in love over her husband. To his youngest, most innocent daughter he offers the choicest portion of the kingdom in special recognition of her ultimogeniture. She denies him, withholding her carnal love for her own fianc é e. Winning only two daughters was not sufficient to subvert his impending fate. To others, King Lear ’ s mind seems to break. The astute King Lear recognizes that his clever solution has not worked and the time for sacrifice is upon him. In his rage, he banishes Wisdom from his kingdom in the form of his old friend. He violently berates his daughters to find a solution that will preserve his life. King Lear ’ s madness is really the essence of clear vision, as we would expect from such an illustrious King. Even this tirade against his daughters cleverly characterizes each as a traditional embodiment of the Triple Goddess such as Hecate. The King cannot escape his fate. Indeed, he and his three daughters all die in the moment of climax as the wicked Edmund kills the most innocent daughter, Cordelia, who represents the Goddess of Love. Edmund is Edgar ’ s evil alter-self. As with all Rose Croix Knights, Edgar must kill the evil base side of his own character before he can achieve the purity required for kingship. He kills Edmund and immediately emerges as the purified righteous King. Through this consummate tragedy, Shakespeare recalled a long history of Rose Croix tradition. The theological scholar Eusebius provides evidence of the importance of this Rose Cross tradition. Eusebius relates that even the great Emperor Constantine identified with the ritual by having himself depicted with his lance piercing a bristling dragon. 881 In fact, the Red Cross first became"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":" 238 associated with St George when Emperor Constantine used it to commemorate the beheading of his friend the martyr St George of Lydda on 23 April. 882 From the legend of St George and the Gnostic depiction of Jesus on the Cross as a Serpent, we can more readily understand the arcane significance of the Spear of Longinus . Longinus used this spear to pierce the side of Jesus. The legend of Longinus corresponds to that of Pelops, who killed the old king Oenomaus with his spear. 883 Pelops was Tantalus ’ lucky eighth son. Legend holds that Joseph of Arimathea also gave the Red Cross device to Prince Caradoc in his capacity of Defender of the Faith in Britain. From this, the Red or Rose Cross then became the device of the Christian flag of the British Church. It now dominates a St Andrew ’ s Cross on the Union Jack. In about 1195CE Richard I the Lionheart adopted St George as the patron saint of Britain, thereby displacing King Edward the Confessor as Britain ’ s patron saint. 884 He simultaneously elevated the Rose Cross to the emblem of Britain and instituted the new British battle cry For St George . Any knight who successfully scaled the walls of Jerusalem in the Crusades earned the reward of elevation to Companion of St George . 885 During a truce in the Third Crusade, Richard I initiated Saladin into the Order of Chivalry . 886 This seems to be a fact. In return, Saladin initiated Richard I into the lower degrees of Dervish mysticism. The Dervish tradition records that Richard I then initiated a number of knights including several Knights Templar into the same mysteries. The Dervishes, however, claim that Richard I never received the higher degrees of their system of thirty-three degrees and therefore Knights Templar and Freemasons only have the lower degrees. Richard II required that every British soldier wear a St George Cross over his armour. His decree remained in force until the sixteenth century. 887 The unequivocal meaning was that a Rose Cross Knight should serve his King as a Defender of the Faith . Richard I died before he could implement his dream to recreate King Arthur ’ s Order or Society of St George and the Round Table. King Edward III achieved Richard I ’ s aim by instituting The Most Noble Order of St George and the Garter in 1344. He consecrated the Royal Chapel of St Edward the Confessor, in Windsor Castle, to the new Order in 1348. 888 It was a society, fellowship and college of knights and their ladies , formed"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":" 239 with the object of Good Fellowship . The insignia of the twenty-six Knight Companions was a light blue Druidic thong or garter tied just below the knee. This gave them the colloquial name: Knights of the Blue Garter . The blue thong is the traditional Persian color of righteous sovereignty, kingship and rebirth. It reminded the Companions not to flee from defending Truth. Their purple robe further confirmed that they were equivalent to kings in courage, piety and devotion to Truth. Three sets of the Order ’ s regalia can been seen today. The Scots keep King James VII collar and his Great and Lesser Georges with the Honours of Scotland in the strong room at Edinburgh Castle. Another two sets of regalia are stored at Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen. Elizabeth I sent the first to King Fredrick II of Denmark in 1582. The museum claims it is the oldest regalia in existence. James I sent the second to King Christian IV in 1603. Political unrest at the time of Cromwell ’ s republic and Charles I ’ s execution led to the Danish not returned it upon Christian IV ’ s death in 1648. Given the heritage of the Order of the Garter , it is not surprising to find tiny roses in the golden garters of a Companion ’ s jeweled collar. The roses are the original five-petal dog rose , albeit red to signify the ritual of ardor. Elias Ashmole (1617-1692), the famed English antiquarian, Rosicrucian and Freemason was the historian of the Order of the Garter . 889 In his famous history of the Order, Ashmole traced the reward of military honour to the Trojans and Greeks. 890 The English King awarded the Order of the Garter to foreign kings and dukes as well as to Englishmen as a sign of the universal and chivalrous kinship of knights. 891 For example, Federico da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, received the Order of the Garter from King Edward IV in 1474. The Duke proudly showed his Order of the Garter in an exquisite parquetry studilio in his Palace at Gubbio in Umbria. The ducal studilio is now on-display in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The Order required all its Knights to meet at Windsor Castle on St George ’ s Day, twenty-third of April. 892 The English King guaranteed foreign members safe conduct on English soil for fifteen days either side of the grand Solemnity. England granted free passport even if it was at war with the foreign nation.

NATO ’ s meeting was in the midst of Serbia-Kosovo difficulties. European leaders well realized the importance of the day chosen for their anniversary. A replica Magna Carta in the Rotunda of the Capitol of the United States in Washington underscores the relevance of the Order of the Garter to the USA. This replica is a treasured gift from Britain. The case shows Jesse ’ s tree sprouting the white, five-petal Tudor dog rose, yellow daffodil of Wales, green three leaf Irish clover and violet Scottish thistle. Underneath the tree, barely perceptible, St George continues his battle with the dragon. Ashmole contended that Moses, Solomon and Hermes were the only three who excelled in the knowledge of the Philosophers' Stone. With it, they wrought wonders. This he learned from Mr. William Backhouse: 893 Jan 13, 1653: Father Backhouse lay sick in Fleet Street; and fearing that he would not recover, communicated to Ashmole as a legacy “ in syllables, the true matter of the Philosophers ’ Stone. ” The eighteenth century French scholar, J M Ragon, noted that Ashmole composed many of the original rituals of Freemasonry. 894 Ashmole's work seems based on the thirteenth century revisions of an even earlier system. While Ashmole's collection of twelve wagonloads of historical, philosophical and alchemical materials was to become Oxford ‘ s famed Ashmolean Museum, Ragon ’ s own unfinished manuscripts remained in the archives of the Grand Orient of France. The archives in Paris became relatively impoverished when the Nazis removed its documents during the occupation. The alchemical slaying of the dragon occurs in the ancient Mysteries, in the fifth degree of seven. This is the second degree of the Greater Mysteries (see Appendix 7). 895 This degree presents a dramatic reenactment to the candidate, the Arch-Mason or Chistophoris , as sole spectator. We are familiar with this play through scenes on ancient Greek pottery. Perseus , with the assistance of Hermes and Athena, decapitates the Gorgon called Medusa , whose name derives from the Sanskrit Medha meaning sovereign female wisdom . 896 Perseus overcomes the sea monster that seeks to devour Andromeda. 897 In a similar legend, Jason sails his magic boat, made from the prophetic oaks of Dodona to win the Golden Fleece. 898 He needs the help of the goddess Hera and his love Medea . 899 With magic charms from"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":" 241 Medea , Jason becomes invincible and is able to beguile the sleepless dragon that guards the Golden Fleece. We see the same symbolism in the Minoan myth of Minotaur , a half bull, half-human who is confined to a labyrinth. At Knossos, the cult of the bull succeeded the partridge cult. 900 Although easy to enter, the labyrinth is impossible to escape from without the help of the Goddess Ariadne. She represents love. To the Greeks her name Ariagne meant most pure or very holy ( qdeshah ). 901 She was the Moon Goddess honored in the dance of the labyrinth. Ariadne immediately falls in love with Theseus, who is to be the next meal for the Minotaur . She seeks the designer of the labyrinth, Daedalus, to obtain a ball of silken thread. 902 Theseus fastens one end of this to the door of the maze and unwinds it as he ventures in. After killing the Minotaur , he is able to emerge from his figurative death by rewinding the silken thread of Ariadne ’ s love (see Appendix 6). On Mount Sipylus, in Athens, Crete, Troy and in Palestine, dancers of the maze or cordax used a rope in the same way, explained as an aid to keep proper distance and execute the pattern faultlessly. 903 The Celtic people knew Ariadne ’ s castle of Light at the Corona Borealis as Caer Sidi . 904 The Welsh called the maze Caer-droia or Troy- town . The Greeks visualized the Corona Borealis as a crown of fiery gold and Indian rubies set in the shape of roses. 905 The divine smith Hephaestus created this crown. The same delicate gold wreaths with gemmed flowers were found in the Mochlos hoard. 906 Ariadne ’ s spiral castle is revolving, and remote, gloomy, lofty and cold. In Celtic myth, this spiral castle is a labyrinthine bridal chaplet and royal tomb. 907 To escape is to reincarnate. Many labyrinths are in a mountain cave. 908 The entrance is via a dark door on the side of a hill. The theme is modern as well as ancient. Fans of Superman will recognize the castle as the Arctic ice cave where Superman regenerated. A video clip called Frozen, from the American singer Madonna ’ s 1998 album Ray of Light, similarly shows Madonna as the Triple Goddess in her castle of Light at the Corona Borealis . 909 The spiral Guggenheim Museum in New York designed by Frank Lloyd Wright suggests the same fascination of spiral castle and beehive. The word Hero derives from the name of the Goddess Hera. 910 With his golden apple, the soul of her Hero travels to her paradise at the back of the North Wind."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":" 242 Only seven heroes harrowed hell to return from this paradise called Caer Sidi. 911 These are all sun-heroes: Daedalus with the assistance of the Moon Goddess, Theseus who killed the Minotaur, Hercules, Orpheus and 3 others. The last three will be among the heroes Amathon, Arthur and Gwydion in Britain; Harpocrates, Kay, Owain and Cuchulain in Ireland. Ariadne transported the sacrificed Oak-king to her spiral castle in the Corona Borealis. This was just dipping over the northern horizon at the time of the summer solstice. 912 In this castle, the Oak-king, like the blind Samson in Delilah ’ s prison mill, adds his weight to turn the Mill of the Universe. As Samson ’ s sacrificial Goddess, Delilah shaved the rays of the sun, his hair and his strength, before calling the Philistines, as the ages old Triple Goddess did before tearing to pieces the sacrificial king. 913 The dancing Great and Little She-Bears showed the ongoing turn of the Mill around the polar axis. 914 Nowadays, the relentless precession of the earth has disturbed this pattern. The Egyptians used labyrinths in their mortuary temples. That of the sixth Pharaoh of the twelfth dynasty, Amenemhe III, Ses ô stris I great- great grandson, was known to classical writers such as Herodotus as the Labyrinth and mysteriously described as Egypt ’ s greatest wonder of all . 915 In the Egyptian context, St George is Horus. In the second degree of the Greater Mysteries, mentioned earlier, Horus searches the hall with several masters bearing torches to find the cavern where Typhon , a hundred headed dragon, belches flames. Horus decapitates Typhon and casts the corpse back into the fiery cavern. In silence, Horus exhibits the dragon's heads. The candidate received the meaning of the drama and the word, Chymia . This united Mystery philosophy with alchemy and foreshadowed the importance of alchemy in the rituals to come. This fifth degree of seven also reminds us of the Egyptians ’ anguish when ruled by the Hyksos king Apophis, who fashioned himself as Typhon . Chapter 6 introduced this subject, which we will return to in Chapter 18. In the next chapter, we look at the colors of emerald green and lilac before again turning to the Red Cross of St George in the intriguing context of Roses and Rosicrucians. We shall also see the striking similarity between the symbolism in this degree and Mesopotamian myths outlined Chapter 18 and then look more closely at the ultimate aims of alchemy."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":" 243 Before concluding this phase of our alchemy investigation, it is as well to remember that there never was a Gorgon called Medusa. 916 The Gorgon was simply a fearsome ugly mask, a warning not to divulge or misuse the real contents of Pallas Athena ’ s magical goatskin bag. 917 These are the Mysteries of the Triple Goddess: a live and venomous serpent, the great secrets of alchemy, Palamedes ’ secret letters of the alphabet and a disc spirally engraved with the nine-letter name of the Goddess of Wisdom, JIEHUOVA Ō , Later, when the ceremony became patriarchal, Perseus owned the bag and the Holy and Ineffable name of God was the seven-letter name JIEUOA Ō . 918 "},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":" 244 Chapter 16 Green and Lilac There are further stages of alchemy that move beyond red to green and eventually lilac substances. Green has always been at the centre of alchemical mysteries as a Green Lion. The sixteenth century treatise Esh M ’ saref or The Refiners Fire discusses the Green Lion: 919 And it is known in the metallic mysteries that at the very outset there occurs the enigma of the Lion of the green growth, which we call the Green Lion, which, I pray you, do not reckon that it is called for any other reason but its color. For unless your matter be green, not only in that immediate state before it is reduced to water, but also after the water of gold is made thereof, you must remember that you must thus amend your universal dry process. ” The manuscript also notes that the true healer, that is the expert alchemist, must be as contemptuous of riches as the Prophet Elisha . 920 Michael Maier's Septimana philosophica links the Green Lion to an alchemical rose: 921 The centre of the rose is green and is emblematical of the Green Lion. Basil Valentine also discusses the Green Lion in his Twelve Keys : This is feeding, the Red Lion with the blood of the Green Dragon. The Green Lion you know what it is, it's the crude antimony. And the Red Lion is the Regulus. His words are mischievously obscuring because the Green Lion is not crude antimony as he says and the Red Lion is quite apparently not the Star Regulus of antimony. Though a master of misinformation, Basil Valentine skillfully left an important clue to those who can see. The words are you know what it is . Of this, we shall have much more to discover in Chapter 19. The Green Dragon exists within the alchemists' flask. It is crucial in preparing the Green Lion and often compared to the human characteristic of jealousy. Shakespeare ’ s Othello says: 922 IAGO O, beware, my lord, of jealousy: It is the Green-ey ’ d monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on. Minna Antrim (b1861) argues similarly in Naked Truth and Veiled Allusion that the absence of the Green Dragon means the alchemical reaction is not working:"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":" 245 The Green-Eyed Monster causes much woe, but the absence of this ugly serpent argues the presence of a corpse whose name is Eros. The emergence of a green substance beneath the red was one of the most hidden secrets of the Great Work. Fulcanelli said of the red substance: 923 ... according to the sacred language, the term philosopher's stone, means the stone which bears the sign of the sun. The solar sign is characterized by its red coloration, which can vary in intensity ... and 924 ...the philosopher's stone appears in the shape of a crystalline, diaphanous body, red in the mass, yellow after pulverization .. David Hudson says of the chemistry of the Green substance: 925 Monatomic gold as a chloride has a forest green color; commercial gold chloride is gold or a light green depending on how much you dilute it. No one offers monatomic gold commercially. Edgar Cayce says you should use gold chloride solution in his Wet Cell Appliance. When you put the green gold chloride solution in the wet cell it works about twenty times better ... When you dissolve metallic gold into aqua regia, you convert to chloride to get rid of all the nitric. All you really have is a cluster of metallic gold. I do not care how long you boil this; it never will dissolve to the monatom. The diatonic bonds of gold are so profoundly strong, and if you really think about it, gold has an electronic structure of 5d106s1 and that in itself tells you it will never go to the monatom. All of the other s1 elements are lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium; these are explosively reactive substances that we call the alkaline metals. If you throw them in water, they burn. Gold has the same structure as these alkaline metals. Gold gets a hold of itself and it will not let go. You can get it down to the diatom, but it will never go farther than that, so the best that you can ever hope for, is AU 2 CL 6 . You never lose the diatomic bond, and that's why when you refine gold, you always get 99.9% recovery, because it ’ s real easy to recover, it never loses its metallic character. But if you know how to take those metallic bonds apart and get monatomic gold, which is what mother nature did by literally dissolving it to a single atom when it comes up out of the earth, about ninety"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":" 246 eight percent of the gold comes up as monatomic gold, about two percent comes up as metal. Others have suggested that green gold is formed from gold isotope 192, while red is from the 195 isotope and white from 197. In contrast to the difficulty in raising green and red to white, white gives rise to both red and green. It is possible that a collapsing magnetic field or accurate chemical pH control also can remove neutrons to form the green. The mystery passion play of the Egyptian Sed Festival , which dates back to the first Egyptian dynasty, demonstrates the importance of both Red and Green. In this play, the Spirit of the Pharaoh Unas figuratively dies and then is reborn. Renewed, he rules Egypt wisely. The name Unas means Existence. The Pharaoh's Spirit or ka passes through the phases of the silvery white crown of the south ( Mercury ) representing the soul and the golden red crown of the north ( Sulphur ) representing the spirit, thereby uniting them: 926 Unas has sustained himself on the Red Crown; he has swallowed the Green One ... The signatures do not weaken in his hand for he has swallowed the wisdom of all Neters [Principles]. The Pharaoh is himself the great house. He is the living image of reincarnation and of return to the source of the divine Word. He represents the resurrecting Osiris. The image of the Pharaoh as the great House is similar to the early Persian meaning of Freemason , which is Master of the House . In the ceremony dedicating a new temple, the Pharaoh orients the temple, symbolically prepares the foundations and passes the house to its Master. 927 The resurrection ceremony of Anubis for the Unas Pharaoh continues: 928 Unas is liberated from the humanity that is within his limbs. This Unas seizes the great white crown from the hands of the two divine Enneads. Isis nurses him, Nephthys suckles him. Horus takes him in his fingers, eternally living. He purifies Unas in the Jackal Lake, he delivers the Ka of Unas in the lake of the Netherworld, he destroys the flesh of the Ka of this Unas for his body of resurrection, by means of what is on Ra ’ s arms ... . The two lands shine forth and the face of the Principles radiates while he leads the Ka of this Unas and his own body of resurrection toward the great mansion ... ..

It is Unas who is at the head of the Kas, who united hearts in the face of the supreme Sage, bearer of the divine scroll the Knower of wisdom at the right hand of Ra ... . Although this ceremony dates from the first Egyptian dynasty, the above description is from the Saqqara temple of Pharaoh Unas, the last king of the fifth dynasty. The Egyptians may have lost the secret of the green substance during the Hyksos invasion. 929 Pre-Islamic Persian Sufism provides a guide to the full significance of green: 930 Ours is the method of alchemy. It involves extracting the subtle organism of light from beneath the mountains under which it lies imprisoned. The Iranian Sufis drew not only on Islam, but also on the Zoroastrian, Manichaean, Hermetic, Gnostic and Platonic traditions that flourished in Persia. Sohrawardi the Martyr, who lived from 1153CE to 1191CE, was the chief Sufi Philosopher of the Orient . He carried out the great project of reviving the wisdom of pre-Islamic Zoroastrian Iran in Sufism. This wisdom traced the Orient of pure light to the celestial pole, the double constellation of the Bear and Pole Stars. In an important Sufi vision, oil collected from the constellation of the Bear is a pure spiritual substance given as initiation into the mystical rank of Ecclesia Spiritualis , the seven masters of initiation and intercessors. 931 The Great Bear , otherwise known as the Great Chariot , Arktos , the Big Dipper and Charlie ’ s Wain is the most prominent constellation in the Northern Hemisphere. The Little Bear or Little Chariot is the laborer ’ s Plough or Phoenix , which is reborn from ashes. Each night the Great Bear ’ s seven principal stars pivot around the axis of the North Pole. This axis is now located near the star Polaris but six thousand years ago the star Dracos was the axis. Dracos , the Arthurian dragon, lies in between the two Bears so that the Bears appeared to dance around the pole as the earth rotated. Ruzbehan of Shiraz, on turning his attention to the Great Bear, saw its seven stars as seven apertures through which God directly showed himself. Similarly, in Taoist tradition, the Ecclesia Spiritualis are the seven spiritual rulers in the constellation of the Bear and the Bear Star is"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":" 248 the Pivot of Jade . 932 Confucians call Polaris the Emperor and the Great Bear his Chariot. In Zoroastrianism, Ahura Mazda and Spenta Mainyu together evoked the bounteous septet of Amesha Spentas , the Beneficent or Holy Immortals. 933 These spiritual beings exorcise the deavas, who are major demons committed to ruination. 934 Jewish and Christian traditions adopted the seven Amesha Spentas as seven archangels. At the extreme east of the Iranian world is Transoxiania, very near Bactria, the Jewel of Iran that cradled Indo-Hittite Zoroastrianism. There, Sufi Najmoddin Kobra (d1220CE) made clear the pre-eminence of Green Light as the mystic Orient , light of the North or the heavenly pole. He writes that initiation in the lower mysteries merely takes the candidate from the dark night of unconsciousness to the luminous black night of superconsciousness, which is only to the realization that one is actually unknowing. 935 This is the same as the Tenebrae or Darkness in the Roman Catholic Matins and Lauds of Holy Week. 936 Lulled into psychological quiescence by Gregorian Chants and the gradual extinguishing of candles, an individual can find nothing in the empty silence and darkness except memories. Deprived of light, the individual is dispossessed of all that is Good. This is the doctrine of privato boni . Memories cannot help to grasp the current situation. The individual is said to be in the cloud of unknowing . St Dionysius referred to it as divine darkness and others as nigredo . The individual loses complacency and becomes one of the parvulis , poor in spirit, exiled or orphaned. The magnificent Miserere describes this experience: But what a mystery my life is, What a mystery! ... But where am I and what am I doing, how do I live? ... I see myself. I live in the soul of the world Lost in the depths of life! Miserere, miserable me, But I toast life! If there is night dark enough To hide me, hide me, If there is a light, a hope, Magnificent sun that shines inside me,"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":" 249 Give me joy to live That is not yet there. ... That perhaps is not yet there. A sharp sound cracks the darkness. Light is reborn. A priest returns a single candle to the stand. The candle symbolizes each individual ’ s magnificent sun , the knowledge of God that dispels the darkness of ignorance and despair. All then leave the Church in silence. Sufism identifies the state of Luminous Night with mystical poverty, described as poor in spirit . People in this stage have nothing with which to be, they cannot be sufficient unto themselves in order to be what they have to be. It is the in-essence of their essence. The Sufi philosopher Semnani said that passing from the Luminous Night to the brilliance of emerald vision is a sign of the completed growth of the subtle organism, the resurrection body hidden in the visible physical body. 937 The initiated know this experience as the happy gate of blackness ... which art the passage to this so glorious change . 938 It is the gate of Saturn. Apuleius describes his experience of Luminous Night with the mysterious words: At midnight, I saw the sun shining brightly with a splendid light. Installed master freemasons will know what he means. Red, the color of ardent pure fire, is the sign of vitality of spiritual energy, signifying the power to actualize. The importance of the color green is that it is the color of the heart and the sign of life of the heart. It is the color of resurrection, the celestial pole and the highest light of the Mystery. 939 It is the color of Mohammed. 940 It is also associated with the Great Mother Goddess in her Egyptian aspect as Isis, the Lady of Nature. Sohrawardi said in his Recital of the Exile : 941 Green is the color that outlasts the others. From this color emanate flashing, sparkling rays. This green may be absolutely pure or it may become tarnished. Its purity proclaims the dominant note of the divine light; its dullness results from a return to the darkness of nature. Goethe was a practical alchemist and he studied the Aurea Catena Homeri or Golden Chain of Homer by Anton Joseph Kirchweger and Opus magocabbalisticum et theosophicum by Georg von Welling. Much of his interest in alchemy comes through in his opera Faust : 942 If the polarity of yellow and blue has truly been grasped, if in particular their intensification into red has been well noted and it"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":" 250 has become clear how these opposites tend toward one another and reunite in a third color, then it cannot be doubted that the intuition of a profound secret is beginning to dawn in us, a foretaste of the possibility that a spiritual meaning might be attributed to these two separate and mutually opposed entities. When they are seen to produce green below and red above, one can hardly refrain from thinking that one is contemplating here the earthly creatures and there the heavenly creatures of the Elohim. Goethe's third substance that forms from green below and red above is lilac. The purple color of lilac or lavender is the color of wisdom and the end of the work. If the rock of the Green Lion is broken open, lilac is inside. Appendix 4 contains an excerpt from a very old hermetic document called the Virgin of the World, handed down to us by Stob æ us. It may well be the most esoteric institution of the Mysteries of Isis . 943 In the Virgin of the World , Isis pours knowledge over Horus in preparation for the Black Rite of Perfection , which she has already received. 944 Isis begins with an alchemical allegory of the creation of the world. In her story, the Philosophers ’ Stone is in compost . 945 The great French prot é g é poet, Arthur Rimbaud (1854-91), similarly describes in his Sonnet of the Vowels how each of the five vowels in the alphabet has a different color. 946 These are sequentially the alchemical stages of black (nigredo), white (albedo), red (rubedo), the peaceful pastures of green and finally OMEGA blue, or rather the violet of His Eyes . Buddhists similarly chant the vowels: Hum (black), Ni (yellow), Me (red), Pad (green), AUM (white) and Ma (blue). 947 The Roman Catholic Church has a systematic color symbolism for High Mass. Deacons wear a green tunicle or dalmatic over a white tunic when serving the Host at the altar. 948 The Priest wears a white linen robe, hood and girdle. He also wears a short band of silk called an orarium around the neck and a silk chasuble or poncho . While the color of the silk chasuble varies with feasts and seasons, it is purple for the most important High Mass on Maundy Thursday of the Easter Holy Week. These color sequences glow in an alchemists ’ flask. The reaction phases have many romantic names. 949 Virgil, Homer and Nicholas Flamel talk of the Palm of the Valley of Oddy , Mystic Rose of Kab , Tower of Ugolin and plant Moly . The roots of the plant Moly were black, the five"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":" 251 leaves green and flowers white. Homer ’ s description in the Odyssey suggests Moly is the sweet scented wild cyclamen. 950 It could also be wormwood ( Artemisia absinthium ), which is a psychedelic plant that causes the serious illness of absinthism suffered by Van Gogh. 951 Ovid identifies Moly as the plant or root that defied moon-magic by allowing Ulysses to overcome the wiles of Circe, wed her and rescue his men. 952 The Palm in the Valley of Oddy was Tamar the date palm. Ovid describes this lofty swaying palm in The Doctrines of Pythagoras . 953 The Phoenix builds a nest in the palm. This nest is both the tomb of its father and its own cradle. He also describes it as the plant of Myrrah, the beautiful daughter of Cinyras that lay with him as an instrument of the three Sisters (the Furies), who are of course the Triple or Mother Goddess. 954 Pregnant, Cinyras flees her father ’ s wrath to Saba ’ s soil (southwest Arabia), where she becomes a tree. Weeping, as does Isis, she bears a son. Using magnificent double entendre, Ovid observes: ... Those tears in truth Have honor; from the trunk the weeping myrrh Keeps on men ’ s lips for aye the name of her. Her son, child of his sister and grandfather, is the beautiful Venus of Venus and Adonis . 955 The Hebrew Tamar derives from the ancient practice of forcibly fertilizing date palms. The palm is dioecious and requires artificial pollination. Grove keepers bind the male flowers to the female flowers, once more representing the sacred marriage of the Triple Goddess. Judah ’ s union with Tamar in the Book of Genesis alludes to Tamar as a holy prostitute. As we might expect of the Mysteries, her payment is a young goat. 956 Similar visual images in Pompeii date from 15CE. These images show a tree between two columns at which a sacrifice is about to take place. The Goddess of death lies in wait between the columns. Her robe conceals the sickle with which she will emasculate the sacrificial king and he will bleed to death. These images are in the Black Room of the Imperial Villa of the Emperor Augustus at Boscotrecase and at Pompeii ’ s Casa dei Cubicoli Floreali. 957 In the Book of Genesis, Tamar is at first a regular prostitute beside the road called a zonah ( ZNH ). Later, Adullamite seeks her as a temple prostitute. 958 In this holy context, she is a Holy, Dedicated or Consecrated One or Qdeshah , the feminine form of QDSH . This derives"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":" 252 from the Akkadian qadishtu and Qudshu, the Syrian love and fertility goddess. 959 A monument in Memphis calls Qudshu ‘ the prostitute ’ . The holy prostitute Tamar offers cakes, presumably barley cakes, to Amnon before intercourse. 960 The Israelites eventually banned ritual or holy prostitution ruling there shall be no QDSH of the daughters of Israel . 961 It is also interesting to note that the Greek word for a Palm Tree is phoi ’ nix . Chapter 15 discussed the rebirth legend of the Phoenix. Shakespeare ’ s curiously alchemical poem The Phoenix and the Turtle echoes the profound role of the Araby tree. It begins: Let the bird of loudest lay On the sole Arabian tree Herald sad and trumpet be, To whose sound chaste wings obey. But thou shrieking harbinger, Foul precurer of the fiend, Augur of the fever's end, To this troop come thou not near. From this session interdict Every fowl of tyrant wing, Save the eagle, feath'red king: Keep the obsequy so strict. Only the eagle, feathered king is included in the ceremony. The poem ends with the Threnos in three-three time, the meter of the Triple Goddess: Beauty, truth and rarity, Grace in all simplicity, Here enclosed in cinders lie. Death is now the phoenix' nest, And the turtle's loyal breast To eternity doth rest, Leaving no posterity: 'Twas not their infirmity, It was married chastity."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":" 253 Archaic Temples of the Mysteries One of three shown in the Black Room of Emperor Augustus ’ Imperial Villa at Boscotrecase"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":" 254 The turtledove is Astarte ’ s bird and the song of the turtle is the ritual song or liturgy of Astarte wooing Tammuz to the sacred marriage and his death. 962 This is the Biblical Song of Songs or Song of Solomon. In alchemy, vile terms about excretions tend to repel the non- adept. However, they bring humorous delight to the alchemist who even uses dung ’ s soft exothermic heat to warm his flask and urine to provide nitrate and ammonia. The alchemist also calls his reaction residues by the name faeces or excrement. Nicholas Flamel's 1629 Original du D é sir é or Thr é sor de Philosophie identifies that the Philosophers ’ Stone is in the messy chemical substrate of the Alchemists ’ crucible: 963 There is an occult stone, concealed and buried in the depths of a fountain, which is vile, abject and valued not at all; it is also covered with filth and excrement, to which all names are given, although there is really only one. The same sort of imagery occurs when Samson of Dan scooped honey from the carcass of a lion and riddles: 964 Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle. It is exactly the same riddle as rose logic . That which the rose embraces, in-turn embraces the rose, as we shall see in Chapter 17. Although the Green Lion often occurs, only one technique in the literature uses the green substance to make another, lilac colored substance. This is in a seventeenth century manuscript in the Berlin Staatsbibliotek, suggestively called the Messiah of the Righteous . The name invites us to reflect both on the Teacher of Righteousness in the Dead Sea Scrolls and Melchizedek, the King of Righteousness and Priest King to the Most High: 965 This operation is the Messiah of the Righteous, and it is forbidden to give it to the ignorant. Take smooth green sulphur and quicksilver [never use this substance] and mix them together and grind them well, and cook them together with rosewater at night in a glass vessel, and the fire should be gentle, and the vessel should be sealed on top, and in the morning take it out and grind it and mix it with strong vinegar, and then return it to the vessel as it was. Do thus six times until the quicksilver dies. Then take these powders and grind them and distil them in a distillation, and of twelve ounces three ounces will remain. Then take one part of sal armoniaqe [ sal ammoniac or ammonium chloride] and one part of saffron of iron and ú br [A., eagle, sal ammoniac], and"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" 255 one part of linseed oil, and grind it all and mix it with what you obtained from the distillation, and grind and mix it well, and put these powders into a new flask, and put it into a pit full of dung, and cover it well for seven days and you will find in the flask something like a piece of metal, and make a powder and take the metal, whatever it may be, and heat it and put [some] of this powder on top and [word illegible] it, and then take of lead one part, and cut it up and throw its powder upon two parts of quicksilver, and when you see the smoke from the quicksilver rising, throw on it [some] of this powder, and take of this quicksilver one part, and one part of gold, and mix them together, and it will colour it to gold which will be good for all tests, and try it. And he who understands from this will be right, and will live to the end of days. The method is in code, which we learned of in the last chapter: Quicksilver is not metallic mercury but Philosophers' Mercury , Sulphur is gold, vinegar is something equivalent to aqua regia and the mysterious ú br [A., eagle, sal ammoniac] is not sal ammoniac or ammonium chloride. The term ú br probably derives from the ancient Egyptian word for gold, nub. Egyptian gold mines were predominantly in Nubia . The emblem of royalty, the eagle , and A for aurum or gold confirms that ú br is the red powder of the Philosophers' Stone made from gold. Chapter 3 compared the lilac Philosophers' Stone with the lilac plant or Syringa vulgaris of the Olive family. The lilac is a native of Persia and some mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. It arrived in Britain in the sixteenth century. Lilac found uses in homoeopathic alchemy and medicine. It dispelled parasitic worms, reduced fever, and treated malaria. Sometimes, lilac substituted for Aloe Vera. Scottish legends abound with alchemical symbolism and purple flowers such as the lilac. One Scottish folktale recounts how a young bride-to-be died on the eve of her marriage. She asked that lilacs grow on her grave. The lilacs bloomed white and remained so even after transplanting. This pure young girl clearly represents the female essence of philosophic Mercury. We saw the same white maiden as Ophelia in Hamlet and Portia in the Merchant of Venice. Another legend tells of a falcon dropped the first lilac seeds in an old woman's garden. The seed sprouted and grew into a beautiful bush, but it did not bloom. One day a young prince stopped to admire the bush."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":" 256 As he was leaving, a plume from his cap fell on the bush. From that day, the bush had plumes of purple flowers. This legend refers to the Rosicrucian symbol AA , which derives from the Apollo's anguished cry at the accidental death of the youth Hyacinth, described by Ovid (see Appendix 4). 966 The drops of Hyacinth's blood became rich purple flowers, albeit not the modern hyacinth but the blue larkspur or hyacinthos grapta , which has markings on the base of its petals resembling the early Greek letters AI . 967 Similarly, the Salaminians reported a new flower when Ajax died. 968 It was smaller than a lily, white, tinged with red and like the hyacinth bore the letters Ai! Ai! or woe! woe ! With the death of Hyacinth, Apollo also uttered the distraught cry from his heart, Ai, Ai , which are formed on the leaves of the hyacinth. 969 For boy and man alike these letters are the wail of woe foreshadowing ritual death. Ovid prophesies that Hyacinth will return a second time as a very powerful hero. 970 Elizabethan works refer to the Hyacinth as the herb or weed . 971 The Greeks write Ai as U , or upsilon, which corresponds to the English letter V , the invert of A . As we shall see in the next chapter, Sir Francis Bacon first used the AA sign in his literary headpieces, from 1577 on the Continent and 1579 in England. These enigmatic headpieces signaled that within lay a metaphor for one of the secret Rosicrucian mythological histories of ancient Britain when Britain was called Ortygie, the land of Leto the White Goddess. Leto was the mother of Apollo and Artemis ( AA ). William Blake ’ s hymn Jerusalem described this Hyperborean island of God (see also Chapter 17) where the inhabitants were, in a sense, Apollo ’ s priests and Apollo had a grand shrine and big circular temple: 972 And did those feet in ancient time Walk upon England ’ s mountains green? And was the Holy Lamb of God On England ’ s pleasant pastures seen? The AA , one A bright and the other A shadowed, symbolises that half the work is visible and half is veiled. Sir Francis Bacon later entwined the two letters with hyacinth flowers, or the herb Asclepias acida , representing the golden flower of alchemy .

In the next chapter, we look more deeply at the many rose allegories. We shall also see how they apply to the enigmatic Rosicrucians."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":" 258 Chapter 17 Roses and Rosicrucians In previous chapters, it has begun to emerge that the symbolism of the rose, like that of goats and honey, has two very different meanings. The first is related to the Afro-Asiatic sacrificial king myth, with its inherent carnality, and the other to Indo-Hittite mythology of purity, morality, virtue and longevity. We see the former evidenced in Canaanite rituals and the latter in Israelite rituals of Righteousness. In this chapter, we will look closely at the many layered and diverse symbolism of the rose beginning with perhaps the earliest Indo- Hittite reference to the rose on Tablet X of the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh . Here the Mesopotamian Noah tells Gilgamesh: Gilgamesh, I will reveal to you a hidden thing, a secret of the Gods I will tell you: There is a plant like a thorn, like a rose its thorns will prick your hands. If you hold that plant in your hand, you will find new life. Michael Maier's Septimana philosophica provides a complete example of alchemical rose symbolism: 975 The rose is the First, most beautiful and perfect of flowers. It is guarded because it is a virgin, and the guard is thorns. The centre of the rose is green and is emblematical of the Green Lion, That even as a natural rose is a pleasure to the senses and life of man, on account of its sweetness and salubrity, so is the Philosophical Rose exhilarating to the heart and a giver of strength to the brain. That as the natural rose turns to the sun and is refreshed by rain, so is the Philosophical Matter prepared in blood, grown in light, and in and by these made perfect. The rose is a special key in Apuleius' The Golden Ass . The hero Lucius became an Ass. He implored the Goddess Isis for help and she appeared to him. The hero became a man once more when he ate some roses: Then also the priest, all the profane being removed, taking hold of me by the hand, brought me to the penetralia of the temple, clothed in a new linen garment.

I would"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":" 259 tell you, if it could be lawfully told; you should know it, if it was lawful for you to hear it. But both ears and the tongue are guilty of rash curiosity. Nevertheless, I will not keep you in suspense with religious desire, nor torment you with long-continued anxiety. Hear, therefore, but believe what is true. I approached to the confines of death, and having trod on the threshold of Proserpine, I returned from it, being carried through all the elements. At midnight, I saw the sun shining with a splendid light; and I manifestly drew near to the Gods beneath, and the Gods above, and proximately adored them. Behold, I have narrated to you things, of which, though heard, it is nevertheless necessary that you should be ignorant. I will, therefore, only relate that which may be enunciated to the understanding of the profane without a crime. An elegantly beautiful depiction of rose logic dates from the three thousand BCE Sumerian settlement at Ur of the Chaldees. 976 There a jeweler modeled two golden rams in white shell and Lapis Lazuli. They stand on their hind legs and are bound with silver chains to a tall golden thorn bush, which has produced a golden rose. The identical use of rose logic occurs at Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac: 977 The angel of the Lord called out to him from heaven 'Abraham! Abraham!' He replied 'Here I am.' 'Do not lay a hand on the boy. Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son.' Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram caught by its horns. He went over, took the ram, and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son. The ram is the sacrificial son-lover of the Goddess, the bush is the symbol of the Goddess Wisdom who tangles the lover to embrace him and the dog rose is the symbol of the womb of transformation that will produce the resurrected son. Dog roses peculiarly fruit by self-seeding to reproduce without cross-pollination from a mate. The sign of the ram μ is equivalent to the Tau-cross on which the sacrificial king met his death. It is also the traditional sign of a Master of the Mysteries. In the Druidicalphabet, the Tau-cross is the symbol for a holy man . The Druids show it as a \"Y\" because it depicts a man standing erect with his hands raised in grand and royal adoration to receive the divine Light. 978 "},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":" 260 From its sacrificial context, a sprig of acacia has become the universal symbol of consigning the prematurely dead into the care of the Goddess. Abraham ’ s bush is the Hebrew hawthorn ( Sant ) or wild acacia with golden flowers and thorns. This shittim-wood still grows in Cyprus. 979 In midrashic tradition, Moses asked Bezaleel to make the Ark of the Covenant. Jacob obtains the wood by felling the sacred acacia grove at Migdal, beside Lake Gennesaret. Felling of the sacred groves with their Asherah poles is a reference to the overthrow of the Mother Goddess. The essential feature of rose logic is embracing. The lover embraces the rose and the delicate bud of the rose embraces the birth of the young lover, spiritually refreshed by passing through the womb. The rose is both a symbol of premature death and purity of rebirth. The ritual death of Jesus clearly uses rose logic. Mary Magdalene anointed Jesus in the same way that Sumerian priestesses anointed kings before sacrifice. 980 Jesus was destined consummate his marriage to Mary. He engaged her with kisses on the mouth that upset the disciples: 981 But Christ loved her more than all the disciples and used to kiss her often on the mouth. The rest of the disciples were offended by it and expressed disapproval. Mary Magdalene is then present at Jesus ’ crucifixion. 982 Later at the tomb, she mistakes Jesus as a gardener , which was the name given to the son-lover in Sumeria. 983 At the time, she is weeping as the Sumerian sacred high priestess weeps for the son-lover: 984 The harlot who anointed you with fragrant oil laments for you now. The harlot in this context is an honorable role. As with the Church, she receives all men as lovers for spiritual rebirth. Jesus interrupts Mary Magdalene's approach to embrace him further, which is the meaning of the Greek, saying: 985 Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father. Pope Gregory the Great (AD590-604) partly settled the vexed question of Mary ’ s complex character. This influential Pope declared that Mary Magdalene, Lazarus ’ sister Mary of Bethany and the sinner woman in Luke to be the same person. 986 Salome incongruously mirrors Mary Magdalene in Mark ’ s Gospel. Both women are present at the crucifixion and then the empty tomb. 987 Together the Gospels of Mark and Mathew suggest Salome is"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":" 261 the wife of Zebedee. Yet, this is not at all conclusive. Comparing the Gospels of Mark and Luke shows Salome associated with Joanna. 988 The only other Salome is the stepdaughter of Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea. Salome performed the dance of the seven veils, which is the lunar mystery of the seven days that the moon takes to remove her veils. In return for her dance of the Mysteries, Salome requested the head of John the Baptist. 989 This is the sign of a sacrifice to a divinity. 990 While this Salome is not mentioned by name in the biblical texts, Josephus does make mention of her. 991 The Romans later exiled Herod Antipas to Vienne in France for his execution of John the Baptist. Salome ’ s dance of the seven veils is reminiscent of Ishtar's descent into the underworld. Ishtar ’ s journey to the Underworld required her to remove an item of clothing at each of seven gates. Naked and defenseless, she entered the realm of the dead to plead for the rebirth of her lover Tammuz. While Ishtar is away from Earth, the crops fail, cattle become sterile and men and women lose the ability to procreate. With her plea granted, Ishtar returned to Earth and restored fertility to the land. The legends of the Holy Grail repeat this ancient story. The land wastes while Perceval struggles to answer the question: What is it the Grail has served and what is it it serves? When he successfully answers this question, Perceval ’ s earthly and heavenly spirits are reunited and the land recovers its fertility. Scholars have long recognized the theatrical nature of Jesus' passion accounts, the Gospel of Mark in particular. 992 On the broad sweep of Mark's stage, it is immediately apparent that he has introduced Salome to reinforce the rose logic of Mary Magdalene through Salome's role with John the Baptist. The Gospel of Thomas completes the triangle, stating that Jesus ’ wife was Salome. The Virgin Mary is the goddess of birth and Mary Magdalene is the goddess of carnal love. Salome completes the triad of the Triple or Mother Goddess. Esoteric writers also placed her at Jesus ’ crucifixion and empty tomb to contribute the Hecate or Demeter aspect of the Triple Goddess. We can see the rose logic symbolism exquisitely carved in Michelangelo's Piet à , originally sculptured in 1499CE for St Peters Basilica in Rome. With breast exposed to suckle the newly born infant, the Virgin Mary nurses the crucified Jesus. She represents the Church at the precise moment of her transformation from the lover who has just presided over his death, to the tender mother present at his birth."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":" 262 Michelangelo's Pieta is the most loved statue of Jesus. Its number of copies is almost countless. The botanical characteristics of roses bear considerable relevance to their historic importance. The earliest three roses, from which all other roses are derived, are the Rosa caninae , which is the five petal dog rose , Rosa gallicanae , also called the gallica rose , and the musk rose Rosa sysnstylane . Herodotus, who lived from 485BCE to 425BCE, visited the fabled gardens of the Phrygian King Midas in northern Greece. 993 He noted that King Midas had taken with him roses having sixty petals that were perhaps the double Rosa gallicanae or Rosa damask . At one stage, the Mother Goddess granted Midas ’ wish that everything he touched should turn to gold. This ability to transmute metals by mere touch is the characteristic of a man who has internally processed mercury. 994 Some Egyptologists recognize a rose in Ptolemaic texts. This is probably Rosa sancta or the Holy Rose of Abyssinia . 995 It was formerly Rosa richardii , the symbol of reincarnation. For one thousand five hundred years Christian sanctuaries in Ethiopia planted Rosa sancta as a symbol of reincarnation. Crusaders in Palestine also held the Cruciferae or cruciferous flower in high esteem as a symbol of resurrection because it could revive after being dried. While not a rose, they called it the Rose of Jericho or Cruciferous Rose. Roses entered royal heraldry in 1200CE and immediately became highly popular. Edward I of England (1272-1307) first adopted a golden rose in his heraldic crest. Later Henry IV (1399-1413), who issued many royal licenses for the practice of alchemy, chose a red rose. Edward IV (1461-83) selected a white rose framed in a circle of sunrays. This is a rose en soleil . Shakespeare writes of the dog rose or eglantine in The Noble Two Kinsmen. It is a story based on Chaucer's Palamon and Arcite . 996 In the Temple of Diana, a rose falls from its tree as a sign to the Vestal Virgin Emilia that she may marry. Shakespeare explains why a rose is best : 997 It is the very emblem of a maid: For when the west wind courts her gently How modestly she blows and paints the sun With her chaste blushes!

The dog rose, Rosa caninae is associated with the Dog Star Sirius, which is the brightest star in the sky. It represents the love of Venus, Ishtar and Isis. The five white petals are symbols of virginity. They are also the pentagon traced out in the night sky by the planet Venus in its eight-year cycle. In Zoroastrian tradition, the dog rose also stands for the illumination of love. 998 In contrast, a red rose represents the womb, its menstrual blood and the ardor of carnal love. It symbolizes the bloom of puberty. The Egyptians knew the constellation of Sirius as Apes, meaning the Head . Sirius was the Hawk, or sign of Horus. Chapter 14 showed Horus was a Christ-soul that fights the evil serpent and conquers it. 999 Professors Giorgio de Santillana of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Hertha von Dechend of Frankfurt University have shown in Hamlet ’ s Mill that astronomical events provide the source of many ancient myths. 1000 The rising and setting of Sirius and the constellation of Orion are particularly fertile sources of myth. One of the most intriguing and prevalent ancient beliefs is that there is a star gate at each end of the Milky Way. The southern gateway is near Spica at the tail of Sagittarius. The northern gate is close to the shake-hands position above Orion in Gemini. In the tradition of the African Dogon tribe, Sirius is Nommo . 1001 Nommo is also the name of the three Great Initiates or happy astronomers of the Christ Brotherhood of Sirius. One of these is the prophet Idris or Enoch. This inseparable trio of honorable sages is reminiscent of the Three Principals in Royal Arch Freemasonry. 1002 The importance of the Three Great Initiates can best be understood by analogy with the three great Indo-Hittite Principles of Creation and Truth ( Brahm â ) , All Pervading Light ( Vishnu ) and Transformation, Destruction and Regeneration ( Shiva ). Sir John Dee employed this early Indo-Hittite symbolism in his 1577 freemasonic tract General and Rare Memorials pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation . The three Great Initiates of Sirius supposedly came to earth eighteen million years ago, bearing the threefold Light of Love. 1003 They inhabited Hyperborea, the fabled land of rebirth beyond the North Wind. These creatures from Sirius were amphibious men giving Sirius the soubriquet of the Land of the Fish ."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":" 265 Queen Elizabeth 1 attended by the Three Great Initiates Act and Monuments by John Fox, 1563"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":" 266 There is a surprising confirmation of this mythology with the two goddesses of Anubis. The headdresses of Isis and Nephthys each contain fish tails that demonstrate a supreme fish lineage. The Mesopotamian Creation Epic provides further evidence of a fish lineage. Men wearing fish-coats depict Supreme fish-beings called Oannes . Many believe the name John , meaning man , derives from Oannes . In Egypt, early Christians identified John the Baptist with the Chaldean God Oannes . They believed he appeared regularly in the Persian Gulf to renew the revelation to the faithful. 1004 Every initiate of the Eleusian Mysteries was also required to pass through a love-right with the mermaid Love Goddess. 1005 She would hold a round mirror and golden comb. The mirror stands for know thyself , a maxim attributed to the Egyptian Pharaoh Ses ô stris I and later to Socrates. It reflects one ’ s past and seeks motives of hope in virtue for the future. 1006 In the words of Woody Allen: Know yourself, accept yourself and get on with life . 1007 We shall look more closely at the love-right in Chapter 18. The embellished letter C of John Fox ’ s Acts and Monuments of 1563 emphasizes that Elizabeth I is the true successor of Emperor Constantine. So revered was the book that it was placed on the altar, alongside the Bible, in every church in Britain. Within the letter C , the three Great Initiates are advising Queen Elizabeth I on her role of Priest Queen of the original British Church and restorer of the pure and true religion. 1008 In both Zohar and Mandaean sources, these are the three messengers, or uthras. These messengers precede the master of mysteries who brings the book of Wisdom to Adam. 1009 The Virgin Queen, Astraea , symbolized Elizabeth I. Romantic Elizabethans thought that Astraea ’ s return to earth would inaugurate a golden age of virtue, justice, peace and plenty. This age, the Age of Aquarius , is nowadays approaching. So enthusiastic were the portrayals of Elizabeth I as the legendary Virgin or Faerie Queen that there was a great outpouring of literature. As an icon for the new Age of Aquarius, every possible venue celebrated the Queen. One such venue was as the great public holiday Tournament declared to mark Queen Elizabeth I ’ s Accession Day. Increasingly lavish spectacles at Kenilworth and Woodstock matched even the Magnificences of Catherine de Medici. 1010 "},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":" 267 Elizabeth I commanding the Ship Europa, guided by Zeus the Bull 1011 & advised by the Three Great Initiates of Sirius From: General and Rare Memorials pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation by Dr John Dee, 1577.

It was a period when genealogy governed one ’ s legitimacy in royal circles. The genealogy of the Tudor family was impeccable. Bardic genealogies showed they possessed three particularly fine lineages. The first of these was to the Kings of Judah through Joseph of Arimathea. The second was to the Roman Emperor Claudius through Emperor Constantine and his son Ambrosius Aurelianus. The gloriously named Ambrosius Aurelianus had an intriguingly magnificient title: he was the Prince of the Sanctuary. The last of the key lineages was through the Romans to the ancient Great British High Kings. These included Cunobelinus, called Bran the Blessed, Caradoc, King Lear and Beli the Great. 1012 The Church anointed the Tudors at their coronations as Priest- Monarchs in true Davidic tradition. The Tudors regarded themselves as carrying with them the halo of light that signified they had received the full ancient initiate ’ s knowledge of Truth . 1013 The College of Heralds in London also believes Queen Elizabeth II to be the one hundred and forty fourth direct descendant of King David. 1014 The Tudors were also able to claim primacy in the Christian religion. They were relations of Linus, the priestly second son of King Caradoc. In tradition, St Paul appointed Linus as the first Bishop of Rome in 58CE. Iltigius wrote that St. Peter said: 1015 Concerning the Bishops who have been ordained in our lifetime, we make known to you that they are these. Of Antioch, Eudoius, ordained by me, Peter. Of the Church of Rome, Linus, son of Claudia, was first ordained by Paul, and after Linus' death, Clemens the second, ordained by me, Peter. Emperor Claudius then granted the British King Caradoc a palace in Rome in 52CE, called the Palatium Britannicum . It allegedly became the first organized Christian Church. Both St Peter and St Paul often enjoyed happy lodging at this British Embassy . Their impressive patronage led to its alternative name, the Home of the Apostles . More fortuitous still, this was in writing. St Paul had confirmed his familiarity with the British entourage in the closing paragraph of his second letter to Timothy. There he passed on the good wishes of Linus, Linus ’ sister Claudia and her husband, the Roman Senator Rufus Pudens: 1016 "},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":" 269 Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren. This odd paragraph has, of course, all the hallmarks of later insertion into the text of St Paul ’ s letter, in order to associate the Tudors with St Paul. Perhaps the helpful clerics could not resist overkill. As Roman Senator Rufus Pudens was a relative of St Paul, the letter pressed the inescapable conclusion that the Tudors ’ ancestors not only knew and worked with St Paul, but also were related to him. Sadly, there is no information concerning Linus that provides an independent verification of these claims in either Vatican or British royal records. It is here that Joseph of Arimathea enters the legend. He supposedly instructed the three Bishops of Rome: Linus, St. Clement and Mansuetus. Mansuetus was a constant visitor at the Palace of the British at Rome after Claudia had married Pudens. Indeed, there is some influential confirmation of Joseph of Arimathea ’ s role from four Church Councils: Pisa in 1409, Constance in 1417, Sienna in 1424 and Basle in 1434. These Church councils yielded antiquity and precedence to the Church in Britain because Joseph of Arimathea founded the Church in Britain immediately after the passion of Christ. The fruitful Bardic genealogies of Elizabethan times, based on their Druidic histories, also encompassed the original settlement of Britain. It derived from a megalithic Hyperborean Bear Race from the Aegean in the fourth millennium BCE. This migration reputedly occurred because the Black Sea flooded Peloponnese Arcadia. The Odyssey points to the home of the Hyperboreans, Boreas the North Wind and his brother winds, as being an Aeolian island, perhaps the Aegean island of Tenos north of Delos. 1017 Druidic tradition held that Britain was Alba , the land of Albion. Albion was the tribe leader who led this fourth millennium BCE migration from the Aegean to Britain. Upon their arrival, the White Land of Albion became a special country of God. As we saw in Chapter 12, tradition also held that a second Trojan migration from Thrace, Greece and Asia Minor occurred in the second millennium, about 1115BCE. 1018 Because of the two Trojan migrations from Arcadia, the Tudors identified closely with the ancient people of the Peloponnese. The Tudors also believed the Trojans to be the great ocean navigators, the Phoenicians, and the descendants of the Cymry . Ancient legends of giant Cornish megalithic builders, cherished as Cymry , confirmed this story."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":" 270 The pure White Land of Albion was Mary ’ s Dowry or marriage offering. Mary was in this sense Minerva Britannia , the daughter of the Triple Goddess in her guise of Anna. 1019 The nine Muses that interplay throughout Shakespeare ’ s Histories, Comedies and Tragedies represent this same goddess. Minerva Britannia is the sacred Muse of the Knight of Holiness. 1020 She represents his perfect and holy intelligence. Minerva is the patron goddess of Britain, who as Pallas Athena sprung from the head of Zeus after Vulcan split it open with an axe. Pallas Athen was shaking the spear of illumination at the dragon of ignorance, vice and selfishness. 1021 The nom de plume Shake-speare derives from this astonishing and beautiful British spear shaker . Ironically, she is the most important Goddess of the Achaeans, rather than the Trojans. The various writing styles evident in Shakespeare suggest the nom de plume was for a team. Probable members include Richard Field, Richard de Vere 17 th Earl of Oxford, Gabriel Harvey, Edmund Spenser, Sir Edward Dyer, Sir Philip Sidney and Sir Francis Bacon. Their interest seems focused around the players companies that performed each year on St John the Evangelist ’ s Day, December twenty-seventh, a traditional assembly day of Freemasons. Minerva is the light of the countenance of God. 1022 She bore the Word and Light of God as a Seed of Light from the heavenly Father to impregnate the Earthly Mother in the same way as the Shekhinah , or Immanent Principle of God , fell from the highest heaven to the abyss. 1023 Athena ’ s helmet and Minerva's veil only conceal in order to reveal and thus are equivalent to the white dog rose . 1024 Quite aware of this delicate hermetic drift , the Tudor Kings and Queens adopted the white rose as their symbol, as did the Calebites who adopted the white rose as the symbol of their heritage and their special land. Britain also adopted Michael directly as its patron protector in the same way as the Essenes had looked to Michael for protection of their land. Michael's name means He who is like unto God . Michael is the pre-eminent angel of the Heart of God. 1025 He carries the flaming sword of truth and a shield emblazoned with the red cross of St George. The companionship of the angel Michael and St George is not by chance. They are twin aspects of one. St George is the counterpart that is the human soul. We shall see this duality of twins in more detail in Chapter 22. Suffice that for the Tudors, the angel Michael and Knight St"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":" 271 George were both reminders that Britain is the land of the radiant heart and Rosy Cross, symbolized by the roses of Sharon and Minerva. This dual symbolism of rose colors fitted appropriately with the unification of the Houses of York and Lancaster. The unification followed the bloody Wars of the Roses from 1455 to 1485, finally ending on Bosworth Field. After this decisive battle, King Henry VII ascended the throne and married the daughter of Edward IV. From the union of the White Rose of York or Rosa alba semi- plena and the Jacobite Rose, Rosa alba maxima , the Tudor Kings Henry VII and Henry VIII created the unique Tudor Rose . This was a five petal white rose placed in the centre of a five petal red rose, surmounted by a crown. The union of the roses had meaning in a more esoteric context. It represented both the image of the rose of Minerva and St George, and the unification of the lineage of ancient Calebite-Zaddoki bloodlines with those of the Christian Church. The Tudor rose of Edward VI emerged from a pomegranate, the Israelite symbol of royalty and fertility. Queen Elizabeth I's Tudor rose bore the motto Rosa sine spina or rose without a thorn . It symbolized her identification with the Virgin Queen. The Stuarts followed the trend with their own rose, divided into two halves, with the thistle of Scotland added. The Stuarts issued many alchemical licenses and it is hardly surprising that they chose the spiny purple Scottish Thistle as their alchemical image of the Philosophers ’ Stone. Queen Anne's personal badge was also a rose and thistle, in this case growing from the same stalk. The Golden Rose became an Ornament presented personally by the Pope as the symbol of the living Church and its mysteries. The Count of Anjou first received it in 1096. 1026 This may have been Rosa gallica , the only wild rose found in Papal States. 1027 The Greeks and the Median fire worshippers of Azerbaijan and Persia knew the legendary medical properties of Rosa gallica as far back as 1100BCE. Roman military doctors grew it on campaigns as well as in Provins, near Paris, for over seven hundred years. Throughout history, few flowers have received the elevation of the rose and been so laden with symbolism. Now we can proceed to unravel some further paradigms of esoteric importance. The Dog Star Sirius symbolizes the great Triple Goddess in more than her aspect of love. The constellation of Canis Major has 64 stars and"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":" 272 Sirius represents the mouth and tongue of the Dog. 1028 Therefore, the celestial interpretation of the Triple Goddess is a dog . The analogy is further extended because of her promiscuity in love and because she eats corpses. 1029 Dogs such as the Egyptian Anubis have always guarded the land of the dead. The ancient initiates of Ishtar and Isis, the q ’ deshim , wore the dog mask of Anubis to honour her beauty. 1030 Traditionally, wherever three roads met, followers of the Triple Goddess sacrificed dogs to her as the deathly Hecate or Sheol . The Kenite Calebites, or Dog-men of Hebron and Ephrath, called themselves Sons of the Dog Star . They claimed to be the original people of Yahweh and the traditional landowners of Hebron, Jerusalem and Ephrath. 1031 The Dog Star was their Calebite badge for the House of David. 1032 Although generally regarded as a son of Judah, an old legend from Egypt holds that King David was a Calebite descended from Hur, suggesting the Hurrians. This is what Geoffrey of Monmouth, seems to imply in 1136CE: 1033 Gwendolen ’ s intention was that this everlasting honour should be done to Habren because her own husband had been the girl ’ s father. It thus comes about that right down to our own times this river is called Habren in the British language, although by a corruption of speech it is called Sabrina in another tongue. The Calebites and Israelites remained close allies as shown at the Battle of Rephadim. There, Hur and Aaron, representing the Calebites and Israelites respectively, assisted Moses ’ victory over the Amalekites. 1034 Somewhat oddly, this battle with the Amalekites at Jehovah-Nissi, close to the Mount of God, is Hur ’ s only recorded appearance in the Pentateuch. 1035 The memorable victory of Moses is a retelling of Abraham ’ s defeat of the Elamite king, Kedorla ’ omer, following Abraham ’ s own departure from Egypt. 1036 In Moses ’ tale Amalek is probably the god Melek Taus also known as ‘ Az â zil or the Peacock Angel . 1037 He is reputedly the chief of the giant Nephilim , described as Watchers in the Judaic-Christian apocryphal Book of Enoch, and their offspring from the Daughters of Man called the Anakim . Melek Taus is equivalent to Ahriman, Satan or Lucifer. In the same way, the battle between the people of Amalek and the Israelites is equivalent to the ever-pervasive battle between good and evil."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":" 273 The Nephilim had many different names. 1038 They were called the Fallen Ones, Terrors ( Emim ), Weakeners ( Repha ’ im ), Giant Heroes ( Gibborim ), Achievers ( Zamzummim ), Long-necked ( Anakim ) or Wearers of Necklaces, Devastators ( Awwim ) and Serpents. These people were a Neolithic tribe of seven-foot tall people, which flourished in Europe. The Hamitic Watusi in Equatorial Africa is an offshoot. 1039 After removing the Anakim, Joshua conceded Hebron to Caleb as his inheritance. It was the Nephilim, Arba, who established Kiriath-Arba or Hebron. Of all the Children of Israel that came out of Egyptian bondage, it was only Caleb and Joshua who crossed to the Promised Land following the death of Moses. 1040 Caleb then seized Hebron and ousted the four tribes of the Anakim, known as Arba ’ s son Anak and grandsons Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai. 1041 When we speak of Caleb, it is of the tribe that ended with Jasher, sone of Caleb, and Jasher ’ s daughter the famous leader and judge, Debroah. 1042 The line of Caleb flowed from Abraham to Isaac, to Hezron, Caleb, Jasher and Debroah. It was Jasher, not Joshua, that received Aaron ’ s rod from Moses, and who lead the Children of Israel into the Canaan. Caleb conveyed the Holy Spirit to Hebron. In Hebron, Caleb the Hurrian ousted Mother Goddess worship. 1043 For the Calebites, the religion of Yahweh continued as a patriarchal and stridently anti-mother right. 1044 This is to say, deriving from the Indo-Hittites above Israel, in the Indo-Hittite crucible of the Commagene, rather than from the Afro- Asiatic Semites. 1045 In this story, we can dimly perceive the occupation of Hebron by the Hurrians, which has always been such a mystery to scholars. The Hurrian Calebites of Hebron, the Kirjath-arba, Dog-men or Children of Heth, are therefore the mysterious roses on the Plain of Sharon. David ’ s battles with the Philistines also symbolize the ongoing process of eliminating the Anakim from Israel. Eventually the Israelites absorbed the Calebite heritage, as can be readily detected in one of the greatest guilt-myths of all time, that of Jacob and Esau. These brothers represent the smooth peoples of Judah and rough Calebites of Edom respectively. 1046 The Calebites of Hebron merged with tribe Judah, and the Calebites of Ephrath with the tribe of Benjamin. From this amalgamation of the tribes, the Pentateuch was to become a unique blending of both Israelite and Calebite history and religious development. This was the"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":" 274 key period when the Indo-Hittite compression finally fused the Hurrians and Israelites into the unique religious society we know today. The Calebite peoples were probably the group that avoided transportation to Babylon in the Exile. They were the remnant . Instead, these tented-peoples returned to their Kenite mother tribe in Edom for protection. There they retained the essential purity of the early Israelite- Calebite religion. This was in contrast to the main body of Israelites. Persian philosophies influenced them greatly during the Exile in Babylon. 1047 Six hundred years later Jesus was to continue the ferocity of the Calebite attack on the Canaanite religion of the Great Triple Goddess saying: 1048 I have come to destroy the works of the Female. Although Jesus participated in the ancient laming rituals of royalty, he rejected the Mother Religion immediately afterwards. 1049 In doing so, he also rejected his Kenite wife Mary Magdalene and never consummated the sacred marriage with her. 1050 For this reason Paul's adoption of Afro-Asiatic sacrificial king rituals, using Jesus as his archetype, was a direct affront to much Jesus stood for in his own country. The furor that ensued nearly led to the hanging of Paul and in fact resulted in his deportation from Israel. 1051 Nevertheless, the Roman Church was to further entrench this ritual by incorporating Afro-Asiatic carnal symbolism of rose logic into its buildings and ceremonies. We must defer this intriguing topic until later in this chapter. The Book of Matthew describes Jesus ’ second coming, drawing heavily on events of about 165BCE in the Old Testament Book of Daniel. 1052 The Book of Luke follows on to note that Jacob ’ s throne and royal line would to continue in existence through the centuries until Jesus Christ took it over at the second coming: 1053 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. Just as Samson was a Nazarite of the tribe of Dan who judged Israel during the period of Philistine domination, Jesus was from Nazareth, which means he was a Nazarene or Danite. His father was of Judah and his mother a Kenite. So Jesus fulfilled the prophecy of the"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":" 275 Midrash, the Messiah will have the reverse parentage to Samson. The Messiah would come from Judah and his mother will be of the Tribe of Dan. 1054 Returning to groups that used the rose as their symbol, we turn to the Prieure du Notre Dame du Sion. Claude Antoine Thory, the famous French Masonic Historian who co-founded the Rite Ecossaise Philosophique in 1775, tells us that the Essenes and Jews founded a School of Solomonic Wisdom in Alexandria. 1055 The School later divided into a variety of Orders known as the Conservers of the Mosaic Secrets , the Hermetic Secrets etc. This School reunited with Ormus. According to the French Rite of Memphis , Ormus was an Egyptian priest in Alexandria baptized by St. Mark in 46CE. 1056 His school was probably the sole trustee of the ancient doctrines of Egypt. The Knights Templar received these secrets from the Knights of Palestine, the latter day followers of Ormus. 1057 It is worth briefly diverting to understand the Rite of Memphis , which identified Ormus. Marconis was inspired to create his own system of ninety degrees in 1839 called the Rite of Memphis . It was essentially the defunct Rite of Mizraim , which probably dissolved because the final parts of its ritual had become unacceptably occult. 1058 While initially the Grand Orient of France supported the Rite of Memphis , it ultimately suspended this rite as well. The exoteric portion of the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim became the Ordo Templi Orientis . The Hermetic Brotherhood of Light reserved the more occult inner teachings. The two orders merged by about 1917. Notwithstanding the passing of the Rites of Mizram and Memphis, these degrees quite possibly included elements of scarce Rosicrucian histories gleaned by the Jesuits, such as the Initiation of Plato . 1059 While Ormus may have been an Egyptian priest, his name is likely to be an abbreviation for Ahura Mazda in the same way as Ohrmazd. 1060 In other words, his School reunited with the religion of Ormus, the Good Religion of Zoroaster. The symbol adopted by the Conservers of the Hermetic Secrets was a rose on a cross. 1061 The Prieure du Notre Dame du Sion claims its original foundation in this Alexandrian School of Wisdom. However, the mediaeval form dates from about 1090CE and later became public when the Knights Templar annexed it to accommodate Jews and Muslims within their Christian organization. 1062 By this time, the Prieure du Notre Dame du"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":" 276 Sion had inherited the Alexandrian Jewish knowledge of alchemy, which was also flourishing in the Jewish communities of France and Spain. The Knights Templar and Prieure du Notre Dame du Sion shared the same Grand Master until 1188. In this year, the Orders separated to allow the Order of Sion to focus on the restoration of the Merovingian lineage in France. This separation occurred at Gisors as the Splitting of the Elm . The Elm is the tree that supports the young vine. 1063 Some legends say the Rosicrucians originated with one of the elm ’ s branches at Gisors, known as Ormus. The priory of St Samson d ’ Orleans, so they say, protected the members in the priory of Mount Sion at St Jean Le Blanc. The emblem of Ormus was a red cross in a white rose. Since 1188 and to this day, a Supreme Master, called the Nautonnier or Navigator, has led thirteen members in their worship of Notre Dame. The Knights Templar and Prieure du Notre Dame du Sion effectively reunited at the marriage of Count Ren é d ’ Anjou. At least three Grand Masters of the Prieure du Notre Dame du Sion were well-known practitioners and publishers of alchemy: Nicholas Flamel (1398-1418), Robert Boyle (1654-1691) and Sir Isaac Newton (1691-1727). Although these Grand Masters were familiar with Jewish alchemy and Gnostic philosophy, they probably were not accomplished adepts of practical alchemy. Isaac Newton seemed very frustrated. Perhaps the Grand Masters suffered a similar vacuum of knowledge as the Rabbis who supposedly lost the secret at the destruction of the Temple. Nor were these Grand Masters of the Prieure du Notre Dame du Sion privy to the secret philosophy of the Sharon's Rose. The Rite of Memphis always held that the real principles of masonry were Chaldean. 1064 Their Rosicrucian ancestors had supposedly preserved this knowledge in the Temple of the Rose Cross at Damascus. 1065 The knowledge was preserved at an unknown convent of the Maronites, on Mount Liban. This probably refers to either the Assaasins and their Grand Master, the Old Man of the Mountain in a cave of Mount Lebanon. 1066 A 1660 Rosicrucian poem to the Societie by Francis Thynne honors the dedication of the Rosicrucians: 1067 The purple Rose which first Damasco bredd, adorn'd with cullor grateful to the sight ... Soe two faire dowries which man doth enjoye – true perfect love, and suer fidelite ..."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":" 277 both which. This damask rose doth well unfolde, as honest hart, which faith and love doth houlde. There is an important parallel between the stories of Arcadia in the Aegean Peloponnese and Damascus. The renowned alchemist Michael Maier writes that the Temple of the Rosy Cross is located by the spring Helicon on the double peaked mountain of Parnassus. 1068 This corresponds with the Greeks who originally worshiped the Muses at Mount Pieria in Thessaly but transferred to Helicon. 1069 Later they relocated to Delphi on the slopes of Mt Parnassus. 1070 The legendary winged-horse Pegasus sprung the well called Hippocrene at the sacred spring of Helicon, by striking his moon-shaped hooves on the ground. 1071 He was the native European pony. Because of his moon-shaped hooves, he was sacred to Demeter, the mare-headed Moon Goddess. She gave him the power to bring rain and install kings. 1072 Because of his abilities, Pegasus ’ spring was sacred to the Triple Goddess and her Muses as a source of poetic inspiration. 1073 The dialogue between Moth and Adriano de Armado (initials AA ) in Shakespeare ’ s Love ’ s Labours Lost refers to it: 1074 Moth ... the dancing horse will tell you. Adriano de Armado A most fine Figure! Moth: To prove you a cipher. A huge painting of the winged horse Pegasus was the principal feature of the Hall of the Inner Temple, an ancient mansion of the Knights Templar in London. 1075 It hung there for many centuries. The college of lawyers of Inner Temple in London adopted Pegasus as their arms. They erected a stained glass window with these arms in Temple Church, which was replaced the original circular church after 1160CE. In 1185CE, Heraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, consecrated the new, characteristically round church to the Blessed Virgin Mary in the presence of King Henry II. It served the London headquarters of the Knights Templar until 1307. The gushing spring of Helicon is equivalent to the source of the Jordan River at Paneas, sixty-three kilometers south of Damascus and twenty kilometers from the triple peaked Mount Hermon. As previously mentioned, Mount Hermon has more than twenty ancient temples, which is unusual for a Phoenician coastal site. However, many regard another mountain, the triple-peaked Mount Lebanon, as the legendary Mount Hermon."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":" 278 Mount Lebanon is also called the White Mountain , the Old White- headed Man , Jebel esh Shiekh or the Mountain of Ice, Jebel-el-Tilj. Josephus writes that the source of the Jordan is in fact even closer to Mount Hermon: 1076 There is a mountain here whose top is lost in the clouds; in the lower slopes is a cavern with its mouth concealed by vegetation, inside which a sheer precipice descends, nobody knows how far, to a cavity filled with still water: no plummet has ever reached the bottom, however long the cord. From the roots of the cavern well up the springs, which some consider the headwaters of the Jordan. ... The Jordan appears to rise at Paneum, but actually it flows out of sight underground from the pool called Phiale, 'the Bowl', to Paneum. Anyone going up into Trachonitis will find this pool fourteen miles from Caesarea Philippi, not very far to the right of the road. It is very aptly called 'the Bowl' because of its shape, which is a perfect circle. The water always remains level with its brim neither sinking nor running over. Panias was progressively renamed Caesarea Philippi, Neronias, then and Arabic Banias. At the Crusades, it became Belinas. The Jews called the city Dan or Mizvar Dan , meaning Fort of Dan. The Fort is still the most remarkable in the Holy Land. 1077 Syrians or Phoenicians originally built it and the Saracens and Franks added to it. The River Jordan takes its name from the Tribe of Dan. Jordan means the going down of the Dan . 1078 It flows through Galilee to the Dead Sea bringing extraordinary fertility to the land. 1079 Josephus describes how Galilee was excellent for crops, cattle and rich in forests of every kind. 1080 Its enormous agricultural productivity studded thickly the land with towns and villages, the smallest of which had fifteen thousand inhabitants. The Jordan River flows into Lake Gennesaret or the Sea of Galilee , which Josephus describes as delicious and pure with a sandy beach on every side. 1081 It is slightly salty due to warm saline springs that enter the floor of the lake. Josephus describes the species of fish in the lake and tells us that they differ in taste and appearances from those found elsewhere, but are very like the perch in the lake of Alexandria. Alongside the Lake is an abundant stretch of country that Josephus calls nature ’ s crowing achievement . Plants of every variety grow in its rich soil. Even those"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":" 279 naturally opposed elsewhere flourish together. Walnuts, grapes, figs and palms produce fruit all year around. As one of the many rewards for their successful revolution, the Maccabean-Hasmonaeans received the exquisite Plain of Gennesaret on the West side of Lake Gennesaret in Galilee. 1082 Thereafter it became the heartland of Jewish royalist resistance to the Romans. Finally, Jericho, at the approach to the Dead Sea, is renowned for its fertility. It is rich in palms and balsam. 1083 Cleopatra coveted the Jericho palm grove for its richness and finally received it as a gift from Antony. 1084 The Greek shrine to Pan gives Paneas its name as the legendary source of the marvelous Jordan River. It marks the site of transformation of man from the lowest earthly to the highest celestial form. Sir Francis Bacon was to write that what we know as the Church of Christ , was once the Brotherhood of Pan . 1085 Pan is the anthropomorphic or archetypal image of the evolution of the Spirit of Man. The waters of Pan are therefore an agent of evolution or regeneration. John the Baptist conducted his baptism rituals in the Jordan and even today people of some religions return there to immerse themselves in its waters for extraordinarily long periods, even to the point of almost drowning. The Nile and the Jordan River are similar in more than fine fish and fertile floodplains. The renowned alchemist, Zosimus of Panopolis, was to write: 1086 Go to the waters of the Nile; there you will find a stone which has a spirit; take it, cut it in two; put your hand in its interior and draw out its heart: because its soul is in its heart. There is a purpose for the forgoing description of the bounty of the Jordan River. This is to outline that the fertility of the river ’ s valley is quite possibly due to an exceptionally high level of gold and other regenerative elements. Its waters yield these metals by precipitation with sodium hydroxide, as shown in Appendix 3. With the Nile and Jordan Rivers, we just are beginning to understand the volcanic vent, riverbed and seabed sources of the Philosophers ’ Stone, which we shall return to in Chapter 19. The author is indeed indebted to a certain thirty-third degree freemason who grew dog roses in his front garden and many years ago related his excitement about the unusual topic of Jordan River water."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":" 280 While the term Rosy Cross has engulfed esoteric rose symbolism, it really has little to do with roses in any direct botanical sense. The term Rose Croix derives from the Latin ros meaning dew or Life , and crux meaning cross that refers to the chemical sign for Light . As we saw in Chapter 5, the cross of Light and Life has the same meaning as Yahweh's post-Exilic name. Yet, the rose is an evocative symbol of many other things that have synergy with alchemy. For example, the rose also stands for secrecy and silence. Many hotels in Europe such as those in the Vienna Wood have a rose on their billboard suggesting their hotels provide confidentiality for amorous liaisons. A rose in a dining room reminds people of the need for secrecy around the dinner table, or sub rosa in Latin. 1087 This reflects the Sign of Silence, which is a form of adoration given by raising one ’ s finger to the lips. Historically, it is the sign of adoration of a king reborn. The rose embraces the king. In the case of Horus, it is a lotus flower. Cupid, the son of Venus, symbolizes this image of beauty and love. He presents a rose to Harpocrates as the secret symbol of his forthcoming rebirth: 1088 In many places as well in England as the Low Countries, they have over their Tables a rose painted, and what is spoken under the rose must not be revealed; the reason is this; The Rose being sacred to Venus, whose amours and stolen sports that they might never be revealed, her sonne Cupid would needes dedicate to Harpocrates, the God of Silence. The Egyptians knew Harpocrates as Heru-pa-khret . It is from his Egyptian name that the Chi-Rho cross of Christ derives. KHeru translates in Greek as Criw meaning, I anoint . 1089 With this perspective of Harpocrates, we can again detect Indo-Hittite myth replacing Afro- Asiatic. Harpocrates, as the divine child, is victorious over the carnal lusts of Set. The Egyptian Saturnalia celebrated this event. 1090 In 1731CE, Corneille asserted that the great masters of the Rose Cross were Frer é s de la Rosee Cuite or Brothers of the Boiled Dew . 1091 He records that they gave themselves the initials FRC . Masonic fringe groups such as Fratres Rosi Crucis, Fraternity of the Rosy Cross and Fellows of the Rosy Cross took these initials. 1092 The earliest written reference to the Brethren of the Rosy Cross, or Rosicrucians, is a 1638 poem that associates them with speculative Freemasonry: 1093 "},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":" 281 For what we pressage is not in grosse, for we be brethren of the Rosie Cross, we have the Mason ’ s Word and second sight, things to come we can foretell aright . Amongst Elias Ashmole ’ s papers were his handwritten English translations of the Rosicrucian tracts Fama and the Confessio . In about 1653, Elias Ashmole wrote that he had learned from Doctor Molton that the Rosicrucians lived in Strasbourg: 1094 The Fratres RC: live about Strasburg: 7 miles from thence in a mon(a)st(e)ry. In fact, the Fratres were more widespread than this. In June 1623, the College Principal des Freres de la Rose-Croix, a group of protestant monks from the abbe d ’ Orval, was present in Rennes-le-Chateau and Rennes-les-Bains.. 1095 They were a Benedictine and Cathar order that derived from the Bogomils. The Thirty Years War brought European Rosicrucians to England. The war lasted from 1618 to 1648. In the 1620s, Catholic Armies overran most of Germany. The Christian Unions of Johann Valentin Andrea smuggled German Rosicrucians into Flanders. From there, they formed a Rosicrucian Court in Exile in the Netherlands. James I of England, a Stuart King from 1603 to 1625, became the main bastion of protection. Most Rosicrucians moved on to England. Dame Francis Yates observes that the Thirty Years War put paid to the Rosicrucians' attempt to build a Protestant esoteric empire in Europe. 1096 Johann Valentin Andrea, who organized the Christian Unions, is also considered the most likely author of the Rosicrucian manifesto Christian Rosencranz . He adopted armorial bearings of a St. Andrew's cross with four roses. 1097 The deeply meaningful symbol of a St. Andrew's cross was proudly worn at the establishment of the Royal Society where each fellow wore a St Andrew ’ s cross of ribbon on the crown of his hat. 1098 The Roman Catholic Church, refers to the St Andrew's cross as the Signaculum Dei or Seal of God . 1099 Yet, it remains a thorn to the established Church. It is a symbol of Archangel Michael and the lineage of Melchizedek Priests. 1100 The Testament of Amram found among the Dead Sea Scrolls highlights the strong similarity between Melchizedek and the Archangel Michael, Protector of Israel and Prince of Light. 1101 England did not prove a very safe refuge for the Rosicrucians.

Meanwhile the Hammer of the Witches organized by the Roman Catholic Church had spread to the Protestant Church in England. The escalation of fanaticism that led to the Hammer of the Witches had been in progress since the time of Emperor Constantine, who reigned from 306-307CE. After his conversion to Christianity, Emperor Constantine immediately banned all magic and magicians. Under this law, the State could sentence offenders to immolation. Shortly afterwards Constantine found it necessary to amend the law stating that his intention was only to prohibit deadly and malignant magic and that he had no intention of prohibiting magic used to cure diseases and to protect the crops from hail and tempests. Nevertheless, the Church's war on heresy and magic had begun. From 1200CE to 1500CE, the Church specifically targeted Cathars, Knights Templar, Jews, Muslims and Gypsies. It accused them of witchcraft, sorcery and satanic magic. Chapter 13 related how Pope John XXII directed his Papal Bull of 1317, called Spondent pariter, against magicians and alchemists. Pope Eugene IV followed with bulls in 1437 and 1445 exhorting inquisitors to be more diligent in searching out magicians and witches who produced bad weather. Persecution of all types of magic redoubled. Pope Innocent VIII issued the Summis Desiderantes in 1484. This bull sent inquisitors into Germany. The inquisitors ’ manual was the infamous Malleus Maleficarum or Hammer of the Witches . It ordered: Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live . 1102 Pope Julius II and Pope Adrian VI reinforced the purging of witchcraft with similar bulls in 1504 and 1523 respectively. Before Pope Innocent VIII ’ s bull of 1484, the Church had distinguished between magia and malificia . Magia was acceptable magic while malificia was magic used with criminal intent. The Church regarded magia as a social ill rather than heresy and tolerated it, provided it did not invoke the devil or other evil spirits. After Pope Innocent VIII's bull, all popular magic became malificia and heresy. Earlier, in 1252, the Church had sanctioned torture in Papal Inquisitions and permitted both secret trials and execution by burning. With the aid of Malleus Maleficarum , the inquisitors ordered ferocious witch-hunts against the rural classes. These peaked between 1580 and 1660. Inquisitors and Puritans in England, Europe and America executed hundreds of thousands of alleged witches over a two hundred and fifty year period. Many tens of thousands of these were in Germany alone."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":" 283 In concert with the widespread repression of the time, Dr John Whitgift's Star Chamber decree of 1586 restricted freedom of the press in England. 1103 Published manuscripts required the assent of either the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Bishop of London. Exceedingly harsh penalties caused most writers to cease publishing entirely. Only those with implicit Royal support such as Sir Francis Bacon continued to publish and even then under pseudonyms. By 1625, Rosicrucian scientists had also become victims of the witch-hunt. Even the fledgling Royal Society, established by Charles I on St Andrew ’ s Day, was obliged to go underground where it became the Invisible College in 1649. 1104 The Royal Society eventually emerged in 1662 under Charles II's sponsorship. 1105 He had an alchemy laboratory built under his bedchamber, with access by a private staircase. Sir Christopher Wren was a founding member of the Royal Society and frequented the Invisible College. There are scant records of Freemasonry at this time but Anderson's New Book of Constitutions of 1738 notes Wren, the Master of the London Operative Masons Company was a Grand Master of Freemasonry in 1685. 1106 Similarly, John Aubrey, an antiquary and fellow of the Royal Society, recorded that an order initiated Wren in 1691 at St Paul ’ s Cathedral. 1107 The Christian Unions of Johann Valentin Andrea, who organized the mass Rosicrucian evacuation from Germany, urgently needed stability in Britain. There were a number of ready havens for them. These included nobles who had been forming circles for the practice of the Mysteries. Dr John Dee had refreshed this knowledge from the Architects in Italy and Navigators in Holland. Other like-minded groups were the Family of Love , which we mentioned in Chapter 15, and lodges of operative Scottish builders and glassmakers. Operative Scottish builders' lodges were at the same time filtering into England as clandestine sanctuaries with unusual modes of secrecy, where the circles could pursue scientific discussion in the midst of widespread intellectual repression. Through their friendly joining of the operative lodge system, the Christian Unions of the Rosicrucians catalyzed speculative English Freemasonry into the grand institution it is today. By 1717, the Rosicrucians and Freemasons found it necessary to address the profusion of groups and rites that had developed since the days of Dr John Dee and Sir Francis Bacon. 1108 A great convocation was organized and John Toland rationalized the various legends. He"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":" 284 canonized their rituals to form the basis of Regular or Craft Freemasonry. 1109 Toland was a cosmological hermeticist who believed in the ideals of animate matter and a world spirit. After many more attempts at standardization, the Duke of Brunswick finally addressed the profusion of esoteric rituals in the higher degrees at Wilhelmsbad in 1782. 1110 Thirty sittings debated whether Masonry was a continuation of the Knights Templars. At stake was the controversial point of whether every Freemason was a Knight Templar. The outcome was in the negative, however the decision applies only to the degrees of Craft Freemasonry, not to the higher degrees. 1111 By means of the early rationalizations, Rosicrucians helped transform English Freemasonry from its literal Roman Catholic focus into a common forum for all religions, especially Gnostic Christians and Jews. The blending of Rosicrucian Indo-Hittite myths expressed by Zoroastrianism together with Afro-Asiatic mysteries of the Mother Goddess is perhaps the major reason why the flavor of Freemasonry is so unique. Two superimposed squares produce the Rosicrucians ’ eight- pointed star or foliated Rosy Cross. 1112 Its eight points represent the traditional number of plenty. This cross was marked on the Melchizedek shewbread in the Temple. 1113 Eight was the number of Osiris. It is also the special number of the Holy Ghost or Holy Breath and is the cipher number for Knowledge or Saturn. 1114 It refers to the Origin or Pole out of which the seven Spirits of God emerged. Seven is the number of holiness and ten the number of perfection. 1115 Many Knights Templar and St Clair gravestones in Scotland show the Rosicrucian eight-pointed cross with a sword and various Masonic symbols. The eight pointed cross is also reminiscent of the Melchizedek and papal tri-railed Cross-of-Salem. The three rails represent, among perhaps many other things, the light of the sun, the light of the soul and the light of knowledge. These are the three great lights in all Mysteries. Chapter 8 showed these three lights form an equilateral triangle with the Sun (Q're), the Moon (Ashima) and Venus (Anatha) at its vertices. These vertices also represent Shamash, Sin and Inanna. There are many other matching triads. The paradigm of three rails or lights has proven insightful in today's philosophy and psychology. A modern example is the philosophy of Sir Karl Popper. The three rails are equivalent to three worlds. 1116 "},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":" 285 World One is the material world; World Two the subjective world of each individual ’ s mind; World Three is objective structures that are produced by the collective action of human minds but once produced are independent. Within World Three is the knowledge of books, social organizations and techniques of communication. 1117 The US clinical psychotherapist Albert Ellis independently developed a famous system of cognitive behavioral psychology involving Activating experiences, Belief systems and Consequences of actions that closely corresponds to Popper's three worlds. 1118 His system of disputation and accountability is now at the heart of most clinical therapy. We now return to our Rosicrucian investigations. Very little information exists about the German Rosicrucian before their arrival in England. Even today, they are silent on the subject. Masons described the Rosicrucians in 1883 as follows: 1119 The Rosicrucians of Germany are quite ignorant of their origin; but, by tradition, they suppose themselves descendants of the ancient Egyptians , Chaldeans , Magi and Gymnosophists [Indian yogis]; and this is probably true. They had the name of illuminati , from their claiming to possess certain secret knowledge, and from their secrecy, they were also called invisible brothers. One of the very early irregular groups struggling to make the leap from Jewish alchemy to German Rosicrucianism was the Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross founded by Sigmund Richter in 1710. With uncertain beginnings, the Order quickly collapsed because it: 1120 ... upheld faith against skepticism, revelation against reason, Christian doctrine against deism or paganism, monarchy and established hierarchy against democracy, tradition and stability against change and progress. The failure of conservative Freemasonry is flippantly, yet succinctly summed-up by Sir Humphrey Appleby in the British Broadcasting Commission television series Yes Minister : Sir Humphrey: The issue is not good and evil, Minister - its about order and chaos. Minister: If you believe that Humphrey, you will most assuredly go to hell. Sir Humphrey: Minister, I did not know you were a Theologian. Sir Humphrey is asserting the primacy of order over good .

At the Paris Sorbonne, students violently protested against the Vietnam War. These Sorbonne protest erupted into France ’ s second revolution. Ten million French people went on strike over industrial conditions. In June 1968, President de Gaulle asked the people for the opportunity of reform and they granted it. Instead of reform, de Gaulle violently put down the protestors. The people dismissed him in April 1969. In 1968, Martin Luther King and Senator Robert Kennedy were assassinated. New York ’ s Columbia University Students rioted over US actions in Vietnam. In April 1970, the US blue blood establishment was shocked out of its complacency when six thousand of their sons and daughters rioted at Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Kent State University became the nadir. In May 1970, thirteen seconds of M1 fire by National Guardsmen saw four students dead and nine badly wounded. One student was bayoneted. The FBI and Special Grand Jury found the University administration clearly responsible. Thomas Jefferson highlighted the Freemasons ’ dilemma when he said: Those who desire to give up Freedom in order to gain Security, will not have, nor do they deserve, either one. In his day, progressive Freemasons turned to the objects of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. On July 4, 1776, the Congress of the United States adopted The Unanimous Declaration of The Thirteen United States of America , which stated: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, having its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":" 287 However, in drafting the US constitution, the fathers decided to subjugate liberty to order . They returned to the concept of order out of chaos . They regarded the definition of good and evil as a matter of theology, not government, and saw the rule of law as more important. When it came to that rule of law, it was the society that mattered, not the individual. The 1761 Bill of Rights overturned this mistake and reintroduced the importance of individual liberty in law. It remains a salutary warning to all literal Freemasons. While The Golden and Rosy Cross dissolved, the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia reused its rituals in 1793. 1121 The Societas Rosicruciana in Scotia and the American Societas Rosicruciana in Civitibus Foederatis are associates of this order. One Rosicrucian group, the Societas Rosicruciana of Pennsylvania, claims lineage to the original German Rosicrucians. It also claims a heritage to the original church of Jerusalem of the Nazarenes, which we also associate with the Great Heresy of the Bogomils . The Societas Rosicruciana is supposedly one half of the true order with the other half being invited Grand Masters of Freemasonry. Some believe this group unified Freemasonry since John Toland rationalized and formalized its rituals in 1723. The Rosicrucians in Europe associated with the Family of Love . 1122 They sponsored and educated Sir Francis Bacon and appear to have facilitated the protection of Britain by giving assistance to Sir Francis Walsingham's famous network of spies. The Family of Love or Houses of Love , a term also used recently by the Children of God cult, was formerly a mystery school or fellowship of scholarly adepts dedicated to preserve Mystery truths. 1123 One of its most enthusiastic members, Christopher Plantin, was a French printer in Antwerp. He published the 1577 edition of Alicat's Emblemata , which first contained the Rosicrucians ’ enigmatic AA emblem."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":" 288 The AA Device, from the Faerie Queen, Book 2, 1609 showing distinctive shading or Veil of the right A indicating Wisdom or the meaning of life needs to be discovered The Rosicrucian Family promoted tolerance, friendship, learning and artistry in service of truth. 1124 They regarded virtue, peace and the purity and strength of a person's inner spiritual life as far more important than any outer religious or political orientation. Charity or brotherly love was the most important of the virtues, as it is in Freemasonry today. The Family considered the outer form as unimportant and able to adapt to exigency. The branches of the Family ’ s tree could bend in the winds of the political and religious environment in each country. However, the inner form was quite different. The Family united its members with a common philosophy of man ’ s inner spiritual life. The Family claimed its members led the Italian Renaissance and produced great writers, teachers, healers, scholars, poets, artists and craftsmen. They also claim credit for great charitable works and educational schemes. Dr John Dee traveled to Rome to follow the Family and bring their Italian Renaissance stories back to England. The sentiment that underpinned the Family was only one part of society ’ s longing for better times.

Ophiuchus has mystical importance as Aesculapius the Serpent Holder and was held to be very significant because it marked the death of Queen Elizabeth I. 1126 Robert Fludd wrote that the planetary conjugations of 1603-1604 were a sign for the Rosicrucian Brotherhood to expand its membership in preparation for the great Restoration of Arts and Sciences of the World, which they called the Instauration. 1127 The Rosicrucians believed the arrival of the Golden Age of Aquarius would lead all men to embrace Righteousness. 1128 A supernova reputedly occurs in Cassiopeia every three hundred years on average. Each new star that appears in Cassiopeia symbolizes the birth of a new Christ or Child of Light who will be manifest on earth. People who received the Mysteries and put Righteousness into full practice showed the illumination of Joy in their faces. This was a Crown of Light . Josephus wrote that the reward for a righteous life: 1129 ... is not silver or gold; it is not a garland of olive branches or of small age, nor any sign of commendation; but every good man ... shall come into being again, and at a certain revolution of things shall receive a better life than they had enjoyed before. The Rosicrucian sign of this Crown of Light was the letter A given twice as AA . It derived both from the double A star formation in Cassiopeia and from Apollo's cry at the death of Hyacinth : Ai, Ai (see Appendix 4). The twin AA especially represents Circe ’ s sacred island named after Apollo ’ s cry, Aia ì e or Aeaea . There she granted men the Wisdom of initiation and symbolically turned them into pigs. The island of Aia ì e appears to represent the Aj people ’ s land ( a ì e ). The Rig-Veda mentions the Aj , who are also known as the ancient Hyperborean cult of Apollo that came from Airyana Va ê jo (or Airyana Aejo ) and settled in Britain. 1130 "},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":" 290 Less compelling perhaps, AA also suggests the Achaeans and Argeioi , the ancient names of the Danaans. 1131 Furthermore, in the twin peaks of AA, we can also recognise the KUR-KUR, Sumer ’ s sacred mountain, which we discussed in Chapter 5. 1132 Full or partial inversion of the AA device as VV or AV concealed it with greater mystery. For example, in Shakespeare's overt drama of the sacred marriage, Venus and Adonis , the sacrificed Adonis ’ blood brings forth a blood red flower, very similar to the purple flower of Hyacinth . 1133 Although a discus kills Hyacinth and a boar kills Adonis on Mount Lebanon, they represent the same individual. The AV combination, when superimposed, becomes the six-pointed Christ-star, which is the sign of a Master and symbol of a Freemason. 1134 The Rosicrucians often showed the AA device as a name such as Adriano de Armado in Shakespeare ’ s Love ’ s Labours Lost . A beautiful silk embroidery of Anna Austin ’ s funerary urn hangs in the hallway at Woodlawn Plantation, Virginia, the home of George Washington ’ s nephew Lawrence Lewis and Nelly Custis Lewis, George Washington's foster granddaughter. The urn for this unknown woman with initials AA bears the date November 11, 1797, age 56 years. A Masonic soldier and his lady in white stand by. The woman in white is a classic white goddess. Such was the skill of the embroiderer that she disappears entirely in the reflection of a mirror. Adepts of the AA figuratively slice their crown to open the spiritual pole of the human to heaven, in the same way as the discus scalped Hyacinth . 1135 This represents the unlimited and visual experience of boundless light and a knowledge that God is beyond understanding. 1136 To achieve this, a hairdresser arranges a square coiffure, which enables the release of spiritual consciousness through two small openings in the crown of the skull called the parietal foramina (see Appendix 7). 1137 A symbolic cap protects the shaven head and is a sign of the celestial vault. The cap is similar to Pallas Athena 's glorious helmet or crown of light that is God's Countenance, God's Word or Life . 1138 In the same way, the ancient Jewish Phrygian Cap or conical cap of Hades, which usually denoted a person of Anatolian or Persian origin, has always been the Indo-Hittite sign of an initiate and protective talisman against ritual slaughter. 1139 The earliest mythical wearer was Perseus (or Ptersus ) who reputedly brought initiation and magic to Persia, killed the Gorgon Medusa and founded the Magi to guard the sacred immortal"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":" 291 fire . 1140 Red Phrygian caps signified liberty in the French Revolution and the wearer was highly regarded as a true revolutionary. In the next chapter, we shall see how Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism prospered, while the Knights Templar apparently lost touch with the fine line between esotericism and heresy. The Roman Catholic Church accepted the former. It even incorporated it into its living church rituals. The latter included the notorious Arabic grimoire magia, necromancy and a m é lange of Gnostic sexual practices."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":" 292 Chapter 18 Architecture, Freemasonry & Knights Te m p l a r The most ancient architect known to the world is Imhotep of Egypt. 1141 He was Chief Minister to Pharaoh Djoser who reigned from 2630BCE to 2611BCE. Sekhemet, who reigned in 2603BCE, last mentions him. Imhotep, also called Imouthes , had a number of great titles. He was Seal Bearer or Grand Vizier , High Priest of Heliopolis , Chief Lector Speaker or Evangelist Priest , Director of the Great Mansion and Architect of Saqqara and Edfu . Later the Triad of Memphis deified him as the Son of God to replace Nefertum, the son of Ptah. It was in Imhotep ’ s day that the Heliopolian cult of Amun established the primary philosophies of Old Kingdom Egypt. They formalized these philosophies in the Pyramid Texts , so-called because pharaohs of the fifth and sixth dynasties wrote them in seven pyramids. These dynasties existed in the period 2800BCE to 2470BCE. The Egyptians raised Temples to Imhotep in Memphis and in Philae, on the Island of Elephantine. The Greeks subsequently worshipped him as Asclepius, the god of medicine and the son of Apollo. The great Imhotep is still highly regarded by the medical profession. The only other mortal to share the divinity of Imhotep was a sage of the eighteenth dynasty called Amen Hetep Son of Hapu. His cult shared a healing shrine with Imhotep at the Funerary Temple of Queen Hatshepsut in 1470BCE. This was located at Deir El Bahri in the Western Desert near Thebes. It operated until Christian times. Amen Hetep Son of Hapu was Chief of Works under Amenhotep III. 1142 He moved mountains of quartzite to erect the colossal monuments of Amenhotep III. These included the Colossi of Memnon, which are two great images of the seated Amenhotep III carved from the fine reddish sandstone of Gebel el-Ahmar. They are still at Luxor, near the road to the western desert. These statues are all that is left of Amenhotep III ’ s mortuary temple, the largest in Thebes. Amen Hetep Son of Hapu is also famous for constructing a complex of funerary Temples under the cliffs of Western Thebes. Freemasons have their own rudimentary chronology of Egypt, which records chief builders back to 970BCE. 1143 An ancient stonemason inscribed it in the Wadi Hammamat in 580BCE. It rivals the king lists of Manetho in importance, comparing the earliest chief builder to Imhotep."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":" 293 Great and pious architects such as Imhotep and Amenhotep Son of Hapu are prominent archetypes for Freemasonry ’ s Hiram Abiff. Tradition holds that Hiram Abiff was a member of a secret society of master builders known as the Dionysian Artificers . The Artificers appeared around one thousand BCE to erect King Solomon's Temple. From a base in Lebedos, they established builders ’ lodges in all Mediterranean lands, Syria, Persia and India. 1144 In Persia, Cambyses gave them great marks of favour. 1145 In Rome, the Dionysian Artificers became a branch of the Roman Collegia. The archetypal Hiram Abiff was a Grand Master of this noble order of builders, which took its name from the Greek God Dionysis . The builders were organized into lodges, claimed to possess secret knowledge and dedicated themselves to help the poor. 1146 The rose is an important Dionysian symbol and the Rosalia was one of their most important ceremonies . 1147 The Dionysian Artificers likened man to a rough ashlar. Reason could fashion rude material into a perfectly square stone, the symbol of God. Thus fashioned, each man became part of the living and Eternal Temple, without the sound of a hammer. All ashlars, or squared stones, represent God. As noted in Chapter 9, the Dionysian Artificers who settled in Israel reputedly founded the Cassidens or Assideans who later became the Chassidim . 1148 According to Philo and Josephus, the Cassidens joined with the Essenes . 1149 Both the Cassidens and Essenes disallowed women to their assemblies. The Dionysian Artificers were perhaps associated with the great Ionians who built the Temple of Diana at Ephesus in the eleventh century BCE. This temple was one of the Seven Wonders of the World. The Dorians similarly built the Temple of Apollo at Tripoli. At Marmaria, one and a half kilometers from Delphi, on the slopes of Mt Parnassus, are three precious ornaments also reputedly built by the Dionysian Artificers . 1150 These are two small Doric Temples and the famous Tholos of Delphi. The older of the two small temples is known as the Treasury of Massalia and dates from about 530BCE when the Python Priestesses moved around the hill from Delphi. Traditionally the Priestesses buried a young warrior under the temple threshold. 1151 Freemasons may recognize this practice. Chapter 5 showed that the name Treasury was usually an alias for a Temple of melissae priestesses. The Treasury of Massalia was one of the finest examples of Ionic architecture in Greece with spirals and"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":" 294 astragals on its walls of Parian marble . The two columns at its entrance were Ionic. Palm leaves, the symbol of life, curved curiously downwards to decorate their capitals. This type of embellishment became the Aeolic style. It reflects that Priestesses of Delphi worshipped only the Fates of Birth and Death. 1152 Close by is the exquisite circular Tholos designed by Theodorus in the fourth century BCE. It was Doric, built from Pentelic marble . Twenty Doric columns once stood around the exterior. The wall and molded podium of the Tholos are of Eleusian marble . They support a labyrinth of ten Corinthian columns. Two interlocking spiral S shaped staircases may have existed inside columns, similar to the Mycenaean Treasury of Atreus and the Temple of Apollo at Didyma. The great Chateau Chambord in the Loire Valley in France, thought to be the work of Leonardo da Vinci, includes a magnificent intertwining staircase of this type. The Tholos of Delphi is similar to images painted in frescoes of Pompeii. Bedroom B of the Villa of the Mysteries and Bedroom M of the Villa of Publius Fannius Synistor, at nearby Boscoreale, both show the mysterious Tholos , partially concealed from view by a veil. 1153 We shall have more to say of the Tholos and its enigmatic labyrinth of columns later in this chapter. It is interesting to note that all three societies of architecture and building, the Ionians, Dorians and Dionysian Artificers , advocated generous acts of benevolence. They practiced this charity along with their architecture and building. 1154 These groups were the archetypal forerunners of the Rosicrucians. Numa Pompilius, later called Pontifex Maximus, first constituted the Roman Collegia in 703BCE. 1155 Masonic tradition holds that Caesar Augustus, the first Emperor of Rome from 27BCE to 14CE, was a patron of Masons and Grand Master of the Roman College of Architects . 1156 He oversaw the Roman innovation of a new architectural order, the Composite Order, which was first apparent in 19CE. 1157 Certainly, Caesar Augustus ’ boast that he had found Rome brick and left it marble shows his high regard for architecture. Historians know Caesar Augustus as Octavian, although his name was originally Gaius Octavius. Later he became Gaius Julius Caesar because he was the grand nephew of Julius Caesar and succeeded him. Julius Caesar claimed descent to the twin boys Romulus and Remus who founded of Rome. They were the offspring of the pious Trojan Aeneas, a"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":" 295 prince of the royal house of Assaracus, who bought the sacred porpoise- ivory Palladium of the porpoise cult to Rome where the Vestal Virgins ’ guarded it. 1158 The legendary Palladium was a legless object, three cubits high, made by Athene in memory of her dead playmate Pallas. 1159 Athene originally set the Palladium beside Zeus ’ throne on Mount Olympus. However, when Electra violated it with her touch, Athene violently cast it to earth. Aeneas was the son of the Goddess Aphrodite and Anchises, King of the Dardanians and grandson of Ilus. 1160 The Arcadians and Trojans built shrines to Anchises as the god Adonis who was born from a myrrh-tree. 1161 As we saw with Tamar ’ s Palm in the Valley of Oddy in Chapter 15, the drops of gum shed by the myrrh tree were the tears shed for Adonis who was born from the tree. 1162 Ovid tells the same story of a father incestuously copulating with his daughter, Myrrah, albeit unbeknownst to him. 1163 There are many stories of father-daughter incest to prolong the dynasty. In the Israelite context, the daughters of Lot lay with him at Zoar. 1164 Similarly, Judah lay with his daughter Tamar. 1165 A Midrashim suggests that God assisted their incest. 1166 Like Horus, Aeneas was the Son of God. Both Julius Caesar and Caesar Augustus claimed descent from him. 1167 The myth of Aeneas became very important to the Rosicrucians in the seventeenth century. As previously mentioned, he is one of the nine noble warriors . Frederick II decorated his bedchamber at Sans Souci with esoteric reliefs of Julius Caesar and Augustus. Diocletian, Emperor from 284 to 305CE, endeavored to suppress Christianity, yet was lenient on the Roman Collegia despite many members being Christians. 1168 Nevertheless, he martyred four aristocratic patrons of architecture, called the Quatuor Coronati , together with four sculptor masons and an apprentice. Their emblems were the saw, hammer-mallet, compasses and square, cube, plummet, circle and level. These were the same emblems revered by the Roman Collegia and the mysterious Magistri Comacini . A member of the Roman Collegia called Vitruvius noted that those who wore the leather apron of the craft reserved the inner mysteries. 1169 The fall of the Roman Empire was to lead to a dramatic loss of Collegia skills. Vitruvius described how the Romans had made extensive use of cement and even hydraulic lime and silicate mortars that could set underwater. 1170 The magnificent dome of the Pantheon built in 110CE"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":" 296 still stands testament to their great achievement in building technology. In contrast, the great cathedrals and public buildings of Cologne, Milan, Bologna and Seville used porous sandstone. Time has proven this material inadequate and these cathedrals now require extensive waterproofing and repair. It is surprising to most architects and engineers that the Roman ’ s knowledge of cement and admixes was lost until the invention of Portland cement in England in the eighteenth century CE. The same catastrophic loss of skills occurred in glazes and glass making. Vitruvius tells us of the chemically complex color, Egyptian Blue, invented by the Egyptians before two thousand five hundred BCE. 1171 The Greeks, Romans and citizens of Pompeii enjoyed it. Rabbis once died the tassels of their tallith this blue. To this day, their tassels remain white because of its loss. Egyptian Blue was lost to civilization at the time of the barbarian invasions of Rome in 410CE, only to be rediscovered in the nineteenth century. It joined another rediscovered color, the royal Purple of Cassius , found again in 1685. Andreas Cassius precipitated gold, stannous and stannic chlorides with an alkali to obtain the famous glass colorant called the Purple of Cassius . Heating a mixture of antimony trisulphide, iron, mercury (Hg) and copper produced the violet Purple of Cassia . The skills and functions of the Magistri Comacini appear to derive from Brotherhoods, such as the Sarmoung Brotherhood , that we might call Mages of Commagene . 1172 Their involvement in the building of the great cathedrals of France seems to have had its genesis in the visit of Louis VII to Palestine during the Second Crusade in 1147CE. Shortly after his visit, the King adopted the Fleur-de-Lys as both his personal heraldic device and the Royal Coat of Arms of France. 1173 The Fleur-de-Lys derives its name from the flower Fleur-de- Luce . It is the sacred narcissus or leirion used in the ancient wreaths of Demeter and Persephone. 1174 It is the same flower that Gabriel gives to Mary signifying that a new king would emerge from her womb. The Fleur-de-Luce is the striking Nazareth Iris or death flower of the group Oncocyclus . 1175 St Bernard originally translated the word Nazarene as branch of the vine . Traditionally it means any lilac colored flower such as the lilac, iris, crocus or even a rose. It is the ultimate lilac or purple color that symbolizes Horus and the Philosophers ’ Stone. A further intrigue in the mystery of the French cathedrals is that the Fleur-de-Lys astrologically corresponds to the sheaf of wheat in the constellation of Virgo. The constellation of Virgo provides an uncanny"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":" 297 celestial map for the terrestrial layout of the great Gothic Notre-Dame cathedrals in northern France. 1176 These are Rouen, Chartres, Laon, and Reims etc. In this pattern the most important cathedral in France, Reims, represents the star Spica. It therefore symbolizes the Fleur-de-Lys in particular . In another surprising coincidence, the pyramids of Giza form the map of Orion over an area twenty kilometers by ten kilometers. However, the French Virgo is on a very much grander scale of two hundred and ten kilometers by one hundred and sixty kilometers. Nevertheless, both seem to express in tangible form the much clich é d dictum from the Emerald Tablet of Hermes as above, so below . The Virgo plan in France may either exist by chance or have been constructed to such a scale because Louis VII shared the expectancy that the next Messiah would be French and of royal blood. 1177 His adoption of the Fleur-de-Lys seems to confirm this and we shall see how poignant this was to be. Architects and stonemasons of the Magistri Comacini built the great Gothic cathedrals with a previously unheard of range of structural designs and construction skills. They taught the secrets of sacred geometry and construction based on the equilateral triangle of the pointed arch, called the ogive , which was the upper half of a vesica piscis . 1178 The structural innovations developed in the Paris basin between 1140 and 1240 were unparalleled until the invention of reinforced concrete. As we saw in the previous chapter, the ancient priests and mathematicians considered that the equilateral triangle embodied God. It was also the remarkable resolution of forces in construction that enabled the lightweight and soaring arches of the Gothic cathedrals. Knocking an equilateral triangle of bricks from a wall without compromising stability is elementary building theory today. Yet, the secret of building lightweight edifices to God, using the ogive principle of God, was enormously exciting to mediaeval architects. It embodied the glorious meeting of form and function. St Bernard marveled that God was length, width, height and depth and decreed that in his cathedrals there must be no decoration, only proportion . 1179 Gothic principles were certainly austere in the sense of being devoid of decoration. Yet, the new use of light in the upper sections of the cathedrals coupled with slender, logical proportions, based on the Golden Ratio, provided a delight for the senses. 1180 "},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":" 298 Simple trigonometry in Appendix 8 shows why the Knights Templar were distinguished by the Cross Patte é to mark their austere role as Knights of the Perfect Pyramid and Golden Ratio. St Bernard saw the Knights Templar as icons of mathematical perfection, replication and the womb of living Church regeneration. Geometry in architecture triumphed with the creation of spectacular height and roof spans, only limited by the compressive strength of the building materials available. This found its zenith at Beauvias Cathedral, which has a nave ceiling height at the keystone of forty-eight meters compared to thirty-two meters in Paris and thirty-six meters at Chartres. 1181 Due to repeated compressive failure in the stone foundations, the nave at Beauvias was never completed. After encountering this limit, the architects of God turned to their newly discovered dimension of expression, natural light, and increased window size. Their objective was to create a thin pillar shell, as found at Saint- Denis and Sainte-Chappelle. Saint-Denis is the true diaphanous cradle of the Gothic style. St Bernard motivated his ecclesiastical workforce by declaring that work is prayer . 1182 The Gothic cathedrals erected by this practical prayer became the magnificent New Jerusalem , rebuilt everywhere in Europe. 1183 After St Bernard's discoveries were incorporated into the great cathedrals, the Church rapidly lost interest in Jerusalem itself. With the discoveries of the Melchizedek knights safely hoarded away, even St Bernard never saw the need to visit Jerusalem. Quite pointedly, he asserted that Cistercian monks need only travel to Clairvaux Abbey where: 1184 Even now he stands in the courts of Jerusalem ... but not of that earthly Jerusalem to which Mount Sinai in Arabia is joined, and which is in bondage with her children, but of that free Jerusalem which is above and the mother of us all. And this, if you want to know, is Clairvaux. She is the Jerusalem united to the one in heaven by whole-hearted devotion, by conformity of life and by a certain spiritual affinity. The architect brethren of St Bernard ’ s cathedral builders, the Magistri Comacini , honored the martyrs Hiram Abiff and the Quatuor Coronati. Their meeting rooms were loggia and their symbols included King Solomon ’ s knot and the interwoven cord of eternity. They held that King Solomon had given them a Charge and incorporated them fraternally in the precincts of his Temple."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":" 299 The Enfants de Solomon or Children of Solomon was part of the operational wing of the Magistri Comacini . 1185 This is the same building group as the Sons of Solomon , an alternate designation of the Dionysian Artificers . After the suppression of the Knights Templar, the Sons of Solomon was considered clear of ill doing and became the Foreign Companions of the Devoir de Salomon . 1186 In the nineteenth century they were renamed Les Companions des Devoirs du Tour de France . 1187 The Magistri Comacini was in existence at least as early as 643CE when given privileges by the King of Lombard. 1188 Legend suggests that they lived on a fortified island in Lake Como that is now a ruin. 1189 As Lake Como today has only one island and it is a swampy mudflat, the island may now be part of the shoreline. It is most likely that Sir Christopher Wren referred to the Magistri Comacini when he remarked: 1190 The Italians (among which were yet some Greek refugees), and with them French, German and Flemings, joined into a Fraternity of Architects, procuring Papal Bulls for their Encouragement and particular Privileges; they stiled themselves Freemasons, and ranged from one nation to another as they found Churches to be built . The Papal Bulls alluded to by Wren are unknown and quite probably just part of the extensive folklore of the Magistri Comacini . They were active in Ravenna and Venice, although these cities show little evidence of the Romantic style. Ravenna is primarily Byzantine and Venice is Arabic without a single Romantic building. The construction arm of the Magistri Comacini , called the Compagnonnage , worked under Cistercian Masons and Knights Templar Master Masons called Fratres Solomonis to build the great cathedrals of France. 1191 The Compagnonnage first congregated in 1194CE to build Chartres Cathedral after a major fire. It took a mere twenty-six years to complete the great new cathedral of Chartres. Their construction philosophy was integrally associated with alchemy. Carved reliefs in Chartres and the other Notre-Dame Cathedrals of Paris, Reims, Amiens and Bourges graphically symbolize the steps of the alchemical process. 1192 In an immense accomplishment for the era, the Compagnonnage went on to build over one hundred and fifty monumental buildings in just one hundred years. At the time of Chartres, nearly twenty cathedrals of the same scale were simultaneously under construction in northern"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":" 300 France. 1193 An impressive two thousand seven hundred churches, chapels and cathedrals were finished in the Paris basin alone during the century from 1140CE to 1240CE. 1194 The limestone Paris basin contains over ninety percent of all the early Gothic churches. According to the Venerable Bede, who lived from 673CE to 735CE, the Magistri Comacini reached Anglo-Saxon England where they built a church in Northumbria. 1195 However, there was an even earlier tradition of Masonic guilds in third century England when the martyr St Alban commenced the building of abbeys. 1196 Around 935CE, Athelstan King of Wessex called an assembly of Masons at York and issued them with a charge. Some historians believe that at this time, ancient teacher of the arts, the Culdees, controlled the Masonic Collegia in York, Kilwinning, Melrose, and Aberdeen. An old Scottish tradition suggests that this Syriac Christian or Culdee heresy was preserved in Scotland and survived for some centuries after the Knights Templar suppression. 1197 These early efforts aside, it is likely that the main migration of the Compagnonnage building guilds into Britain was subsequent to the 1066CE Norman Conquest when they constructed Melrose Abbey and six other abbeys and churches in Scotland. These masons brought with them the basis of today's Craft Freemasonry, but this was to be developed and fashioned in a unique context. 1198 Although the Compagnonnage masons were nominally Christian, they carved a strange profusion of symbols into nearly all pre- Reformation Churches. The Reformation in England commenced about 1534 when Henry VIII prevailed upon Parliament to appoint the king and his successors to be the supreme head of the Church of England. Between 1536 and 1539, Henry VIII suppressed the Roman Catholic monasteries and seized their property. Over six hundred pre-Reformation churches throughout England, Ireland, Spain and France contain images of the Green Man and Sheela- na-gig carved in stone. 1199 The Green Man has always symbolized a vegetation god but he is not a happy character. 1200 The Greeks showed him as Tantalus dressed in fruit-hung boughs, in agony from flogging and horror-stricken by fear of drowning or immolation on a pyre. 1201 The Balkans flung their Green Man, whom they called Green George into a river as a pharmacos or scapegoat. People of Normandy ducked, beat and burned him at their mid-summer bonfire. 1202 "},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":" 301 The Green Man ’ s image as the male counterpart in rose logic is less recognized. He is St Bernard ’ s branch of the vine . Each year the immortal sacrificial king consummates a sacred marriage with the goddess of Wisdom who becomes his wife. He then dies, is resurrected and one year later consummates the sacred marriage again. 1203 As we found with the rose, the goat, honey and the dragon, similar images often have two quite different interpretations. This is the case even with the Sheela-na-gig. Her confronting vulva is ascetic and oracular. The Afro-Asiatic sacrificial king ritual involves death brought by the Goddess Demeter, also known as Hecate and Dana ë . Demeter is the barley Goddess of the witches. In Britain, a white horse often symbolizes her in the open countryside. Before we turn to the Sheela-na-gig in particular, we need to review the practices of the Triple Goddess. At Marmaria, near Delphi, archeologists have discovered that the ancient female rites involved vulva imagery. They found gold statues of women with their faces and genitals combined. The priestesses hid these statues in the floor of the Tholos , a stone circle rotunda dedicated to the Barley Mother at Temple of Demeter . We investigated the architecture of the site earlier in this chapter. The grim purpose of the grotesque statues discovered in the Tholos was to equate the right of the Goddess to bring both birth and death. The cat is a quintessential representation of a witch, and the particular symbol of the Barley goddess. The cat characterizes the dual right of birth and death because it mates openly and will devour its young. 1204 In some modern shops that sell esoteric items, one may see statues of cats with bloody mouths. A similar college of priestesses to that at Marmaria operated at Iolcus, the chief port of Southern Thessaly. This college demonstrated the continuum of the relationship between the priestesses and witches because its fifty priestesses maintained a close affinity with the Scottish witch cult. 1205 The Sanctuary of Athena lies near the Temple of Demeter on the hill of females at Marmaria. At the Sanctuary of Athena , kings contributed enormous wealth to the Python Priestesses of Demeter and were safe in the knowledge that the Goddess ’ priestesses would not demand their death in exchange for orgiastic favors. Instead, the priestesses sacrificed a male child each year of a king ’ s reign. 1206 The ancient Greek practice of deserting unwanted children, leaving them on"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":" 302 hillsides to die from exposure to the elements, probably provided many of the innocent victims. Child surrogates, now called interrex, extended the period between the sacrifice of a mature male from one year to five, then to seven and eight years. 1207 The priestess ’ euphemistic analogy for a male sacrificial victim was a piglet known as kolabros , which derived from the double meaning of a pig . The pig was the sacred son and lover. He related to the Goddess in her guise of a sow. In Thrace, the priestesses performed the bloodthirsty dance called the kolabros on the skulls of their victims. Kali performed the same dance in India. Apollo destroyed the Python at Delphi but retained the Python Priestesses. This legend, and another of the attempted rape of Daphne the bloody one, seems to record the capture of the Delphic shrine by the Achaeans in the thirteenth century BCE. 1208 This ended the tradition of royal sacrifices. 1209 Legend said that Apollo tamed the priestess ’ wild frenzy and led them in formal and decorous dances. 1210 When the Dorians returned, two hundred years later, patrilineal genealogy had replaced matrilineal. 1211 A prince no longer left the house of his father to marry a foreign princess, the princess came to him. Although the Mother Goddess rite continued, it was without the overt sacrifice of men. The image of the pig, hog or boar remained an icon of resurrection in Wisdom long after the time of the Python Priestesses. Ovid writes that Diana transformed Actaeon into a boar after he gained knowledge of her. 1212 Ovid ’ s Circe mixed an Oimellas of Wisdom to turn her visitors into swine at her palace on the island of Aiaie . 1213 It was a brew of barley, honey, strong wine, creamy curds and secret essences. The hog was the symbol of the initiate at Pompeii, as shown in the fresco above. Sir Francis Bacon also adopted the hog or boar as his symbol of Wisdom. Originally the Afro-Asiatic sacrificial king ritual required the death and rebirth of the leader or king, so the land would be fertile. Medea, for example, renewed the old king Aeson: 1214 ... She bade bring out The old exhausted king, and with a spell Charmed him to deepest sleep and laid his body, Lifeless it seemed, stretched on a bed of herbs ... Meanwhile within the deep bronze cauldron, white With bubbling froth, the rich elixir boils.

Then Aeson woke and marveled as he saw His prime restored of forty years before. As we have seen, the herding, protein-eating Indo-Hittites saw little merit in the Mother Goddess ’ analogy of male sacrifice. Under pressure of change at Delphi, the king sacrifice became the sacrifice of any male. Later a male child became a live sacrifice or sparagmos in the Mysteries of Demeter. 1216 Euripides ’ fifth century BCE play Medea tells of the return of Goddess worship to Athens and the inception of child sacrifice in response to desertion of the Mother Goddess religion by Jason: 1217 Men say that women cannot be good at anything, therefore I will excel at wickedness .. A women gives life to her children, it is her right to take it away. Medea ’ s expulsion, from Corinth and then from Athens, refers to the Hellenic suppression of her Triple Goddess cult. 1218 Philomela, the sister of Queen Procne, participated in a sacred marriage with King Tereus. Queen Procne later learnt of the affair and sought vengeance. As Hecate, she killed her son rather than the king: 1219 ... As Procne spoke, her son Itys, approached – she knew what she could do!"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":" 305 Looking at him with ruthless eyes, she said “ You ’ re so like your father! ” and she planned In silent rage a deed of tragedy. ...

Alive, And breathing still, they carved and jointed him, And cooked the parts; some bubbled in a pan, Some hissed on spits; the closet swam with blood. ... In rushes Philomela, Just as she is, that frantic butchery Still spattered in her hair, and throws the head Of Itys, bleeding, in his father ’ s face. In child sacrifice, the priestesses castrated a boy, tore him apart and consumed him in a Eucharist called the omophagia . Later, the priestesses baked his blood in baked barley cakes and ate the cakes in honour of the Barley Goddess. 1220 This is the esoteric meaning of barley cakes. Blood also anointed the Earth Priestess ’ omphalos stone. This was a navel shrine of the Earth Mother with the spiral python motif of immortality. 1221 It symbolized both the umbilical tie to the earth and resurrection for the sacrificial king. Rosettes, the ancient symbol of sacred marriage and royal resurrection, decorated the omphalos. The Priestesses constantly anointed it with blood and oil mixed with strands of woven wool. 1222 Both the city of Delphi and the influence of the priestesses at the Temple of Demeter declined after the Sacred Wars of 529BCE to 338BCE. The Gauls finally destroyed the Temple in 279BCE. Yet, the practices of Triple Goddess worship were entrenched elsewhere in Europe and horrifying myths continued to circulate. While the Indo-Hittite invasions of Greece stopped the practice of male sacrifice, the Goddess Demeter ’ s ensuing hostility to children demanded constant, covert appeasement. In the old myths of Europe, the male oak god Janus saved children from the witch Demeter. 1223 He was the oaken door of strength and security. Another name for Demeter was Cardea. If she penetrated beyond the Oak-king, the door , she would steal the children to drink their blood. 1224 This Hansel and Gretel factor, now presented as mere fairytale,"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":" 306 is still the most entrenched, pernicious and feared aspect of witch ceremonies up until the present day. Modern witches will still talk of stealing blood for their barley cakes from the pierced finger of a child. The Triple Goddess has constantly been with us, even if not immediately recognizable. Ludwig van Beethoven praised her in his triumphal Symphony No 9, Opus 125 Choral, dedicated to King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia. Beethoven composed this magnificent testimonial intermittently between 1792 and 1824. He was deaf by the time of its first performance in Vienna on 7 May 1824. In reaching the words Tochter of Elysium, the orchestra assumes moestoso and triple time for the crowning choral Finale , afterwards resuming common time.

Chapter 15 mentioned that the singer Madonna emulated the Triple Goddess in Ariadne ’ s castle of Light at the Corona Borealis. There are many other examples of the warm reception of the triple Goddess on the pop hit parade. In memory of Princess Diana, Sony Entertainment released an official compact disk of her favorite songs entitled Di ana, Princess of Wales – Tribute . It included a hugely popular song of praise to the Mother Goddess, Hymn to Her, by lead singer Chrissie Hynde and the Pretenders: 1226 Let me inside you, into your room I've heard it's lined with the things you don't show. Lay me beside you, down on the floor I've been your lover from the womb to the tomb I dress as your daughter, when the moon becomes round. You be my mother, when everything's gone.

I listen to you and I want some more And she will always carry on. Something is lost but something is found Let me inside you Lay me beside you I dress as your daughter And she will always carry on. Something is lost but something is found. We can now turn to the Sheela-na-gig . Masons often carved this crudely pornographic representation of an ugly, naked female figure displaying her genitals in churches. It immediately suggests the pagan carnality of the Mother Goddess. Even more offensive, erotic carvings depict monks and priests performing homosexual acts, wearing the heads of animals and in sexual poses with wanton young girls. In the hallowed chamber, such pornographic lampooning of the Church and its clergy is highly incongruous. Together with the Green Man, the presence of Sheela-na-gig would seem convincing evidence that the Church is little more than a pagan hall for the sacrificial king ritual. Yet, here once more, all is not as it seems. While these images do reveal a sharpened perception of the Church building as a womb , the Sheela-na-gig is remarkably specific to Indian yogic Tantrism in the same pre-Reformation period from at least seventh century CE to thirteenth century CE. Despite its sacrificial king context in Christian Churches, the Sheela-na-gig is quite removed from the Female , Triple or Mother Goddess Demeter. It is more characteristically an Indo-Hittite icon for the ascetic yogi practice of vulva worship called stripuja . 1227 Exaggerated ugliness of the female form deliberately reinforces that the sole feature of concentration is the vulva and its oracular function. 1228 A Yogi adept would focus his eyes on the vulva and his mind on Karma or lust. The object was to achieve an ejaculation but with the semen remaining in the body. Yogis consider this to give an upward flow of sexual energy in the spinal-tree called the kundalini experience. 1229 Human life force flows up the spinal-tree to the head where human consciousness and divinity meet."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":" 309 This meeting place is analogous to the altar in the church where the Bread of Life transubstantiates into God. Wanton poses with young girls shown in the churches are similarly not of sexual indulgence but of abstinence and testing that formed part of the greater Mysteries (see Appendix 7). The skilled Initiate demonstrated that he could control his sexual urges even when in a position of power and arousal. 1230 The Greater Mysteries held a similar test: seduction by the corporeal pleasures of life. A successful initiate would not divert from the true path of Wisdom: 1231 I have never knowingly done wrong to any person; nor forgot the respect which I owe to my kind; nor even to myself without profound repentance. I have followed the lessons of the Stoic Socrates, and overrun the world in my exertions to attain more wisdom. After having assiduously listened to the Priests of this land of Egypt, I descended to the gloomy empire of the dead, and interrogated the illustrious shades, or otherwise collected their luminous sentiments; then I traversed the flames, combated and slew in his cavern the monster of darkness – the genie of evil. Then having ascended the course of a river by swimming, after climbing a ladder which sank under me, I arrived at a delicious place where beautiful women with naked breasts tendered me pledges of love. From thence I was conducted hither. The most learned French Masonic scholar of the nineteenth century, J-M Ragon, argued that this test of carnal desire was of the greatest antiquity and really the last degree of perfect initiation. 1232 The Freemasonic Ancients also preserved it as the most important element of their rituals. A true Yogi can be perpetually stimulated over a long period and yet refrain from external ejaculation. He diverts sexual energy from the physical to the psychic plane. Homosexuality and bestiality were other ways to achieve the same sexual excitement while avoiding female physical contact and the risk of conception. 1233 Ritualized bestiality was also an advanced Yogi religious practice. The priests legitimized this practice with the legend that Shiva copulated with the female of each species to create the animal races. 1234 From the profusion of these images in pre-Reformation churches, there is little doubt that the Roman Catholic Church understood and"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":" 310 approved of these esoteric meanings. They are wholly consistent with a priest ’ s vow of celibacy. Yet, there is an even more striking element built into the most sacred part of the Church. Professor Gregory Webb of Cambridge University was Secretary of the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments. He discovered that ninety percent of all pre-Reformation churches in Britain hid pagan fertility symbols such as the stone image of a phallus in the Christian altar. 1235 Professor Webb's discovery is extraordinary. The builders and ecclesiastics clearly had an overwhelming desire to model the Church as a womb at the instant of conception, as graphically embodied in Michelangelo ’ s Pieta. The philosophy of alchemy infused both the Church and Freemasonry over a long period. The operative lodges of stonemasons and glassmakers already had vestiges of alchemical beliefs from the Compagnonnage. The Rosicrucians added their knowledge to these beliefs. This Rosicrucian model treated the sciences of alchemy and astronomy as its greatest practical secrets. The Rosicrucians had sprung from the same fundamental hermetic tree but concentrated on a higher level of perfection of the human spirit , through the symbolism of perfection in metals , rather than the traditional perfection of geometry, architecture and building in Craft Freemasonry. These two groups parallel the twin roles of building and alchemy in the traditional sequences of the Lesser and Greater Mysteries. These were set out in some detail in the late Renaissance Crata Repoa (see Appendix 7), printed in Germany in 1770. It draws on earlier sources such as the Ritual of Initiations by Humberto Malhandrini, published in Venice in 1657. 1236 English historians puzzled over the great French writers, especially the highly regarded Ragon , accepting both the Crata Repoa and Initiation of Plato as genuine when to English writers they appeared to be merely graceful fiction. 1237 However, in 1932 professor Amadeo Maiuri discovered the Oracle at Cuma in Italy, where the fabled Aneas come to consult his father in the Underworld. 1238 At nearby Baia, in 1967, Robert Paget and his friend Keith Jones discovered the great Underworld stage of Homer ’ s Odyssey, Orpheus & Eurydice and Vergil ’ s Fourth Eclogue. 1239 This was a complex of tunnels 880 feet long and 140 feet below the surface of the ground. 1240 The River Styx is integral to the"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":" 311 whole plan. It is potable water fed from underground streams and required a boat journey with the ferryman Charon. The connection between Homer and the Baian Oracle is strong. Strabo wrote that Baia took its name from Baius, one of the companions of Odysseus. 1241 The Anead describes Aneas ’ visit to the Oracle to consult his dead father. In the Oracle there is writing identifying the place as Illium (Troy) with a prayer to Hera and a niche, which contained a mason ’ s plumbob. The mistaken idea, that an Egyptian priestly heritage is impossible, is best summed-up by the French Protestant critic Isaac Casaubon who disputed the idea of Egyptian priestly heritage in 1614. Casaubon argued that the Corpus Hermeticum was a derivative concept, as there were no references to it in other works with compellingly similar themes, such as Plato, Aristotle and the New Testament. Although his theory was widely embraced at that time, modern scholarship now regards Casaubon ’ s logic as arrogant and faulty. Casaubon ’ s chief deficiency was that he lacked positive evidence. He also made two erroneous assumptions regarding the important theme of Righteousness. Casaubon maintained such a theme could not be widely shared. He also assumed that no single chain of succession could preserve the theme of Righteousness over a long period. Modern scholars are now more inclined to accept the merit of Sir Flinders Petrie ’ s argument that an Egyptian prisca theologia & prisca sapientia may date back at least to the period between the sixth and second centuries BCE. 1242 The conversion of metallic gold to the Philosophers ’ Stone involves putrefaction, corruption, generation and ultimately perfection. Colors change from black to white, red and finally green. Color change is important symbolism in the Church, Freemasonry and in much of the Elizabethan Canon of English literature. These color changes are particularly important in the higher degrees of Scottish Rite Freemasonry. Chevalier Andrew Michael Ramsay, Grand Orator of the Grand Lodge of France, foreshadowed the genesis of Scottish Rite Freemasonry. 1243 In a speech given on Charles Radclyffe ’ s appointment as Grand Master in 1737, Ramsay outlined the rediscovery of Freemasonry by the Knights Templar. His speech anticipated renewed royal patronage by King Frederick II: 1244 The word Freemason must therefore not be taken in a literal gross and material sense, as if our founders had been simple workers in stone, or merely curious geniuses who wished to"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":" 312 perfect the arts. They were not only skilful architects, desirous of consecrating their talents and goods to the construction of material Temples, but also religious and warrior Princes ... Scottish Rite Freemasonry officially commenced at the Jesuit Chapter of Clermont, which existed from 1758 to 1764, although it traced three of its four degrees of Harodim at least as far back as 1688. 1245 This Chapter of Clermont, or Mount of Clerics, produced the first statutes of modern Knights Templar. 1246 The word Heredom is a French derivative of Harodim . It was a term used by the Comacini builders of London, meaning a Master of the Builders of the Temple. According to the Roman Catholic Church, the Gaelic speaking Celtic Scots of Scotland ’ s eastern Border country were Pelagian heretics. 1247 Pelagius was a Gaelic speaking Celtic from Strathclyde in 429 CE. St Jerome called him a fat hound weighed down by Scottish porridge . A precursor to Germany ’ s Luther, Pelagius preached that demanding personal effort was the key to salvation, not a corrupt and morally lax Church. His libertarian concept of individual free will was at the core of all Mystery Religions that sought to make good men better by confronting them with their own mortality. In the Scottish Borders of the Dark Ages, the ancient doctrine compounded with Triple Goddess or Virgin Worship , in the form of a cult of Mary. 1248 This powerful cocktail underpinned the mysteries of the Knights Templar learned in the East. There is an old Scottish tradition that the Knights Templar rescued a group of Syriac Christians from the Saracens. These Syriac Christians were disciples of the Rose Croix and claimed descent from the Essenes. 1249 The Sepher Toldos Jeshu recorded the tradition that Hugh de Payens learned the truth of Jesus and early Christianity from Theocletes, Grand-Pontiff of the Johanite sect ’ s Order of the Temple. Theocletes designated Hugh de Payens as his successor. 1250 We looked at the Nazarene beliefs about Jesus in Chapter 10. The Knights Templar called those initiated into higher Johanite mysteries Knights of Palestine. The Nazarenes of Basra in Persia still have a tradition that their glorious and wealthy Brothers in Malta and Europe will eventually restore the doctrine of their Prophet Iohanan (St John), the son of Lord Jordan, and eliminate from the hearts of humanity every other false teaching. 1251 The Syriac Christians arrived at a mountain in Scotland called Harodim or Heroden , between the west and north of Scotland, 60 miles from Edinburgh. 1252 "},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":" 313 Many believe this place was the island of Iona, known also as Hy, Icolmkill and Innes nan Druidhreah (Island of the Druids). 1253 The Celts worshipped on Iona from ancient times. In 717CE, the Culdees of Ireland inhabited the island. In 1784, some French Freemasons wrote to their English brethren enquiring whether the Hebredian island, where the Culdees practised their rites, was the same as the Island of Mull where Pierre d'Aumont and seven other Knights Templar had landed. They asked: It concerns us to know if there really exists in the island of Mull, formerly Melrose ... in the North of Scotland, a Mount Heredom, or if it does not exist. In reply General Rainsford, referred them to the words Har Adonai , which means the Mount of God. 1254 The Mount of God is a place of ritual testing. However, other French masons record that the secret place of hiding was the concealed valley of Glenbeag, opposite the Isle of Skye, about one and a half miles south of Glenelg where there are two exceptionally well preserved Iron Age brochs called Dun Telve and Dun Troddan: 1255 Here were two old castles, built in a remarkable manner, of stone, with neither lime nor mortar, and which appeared to have served as places of refuge in the wars of earlier times. It was in these castles that the masters assembled in council, and consequently they received the name of Masters of the Valley, or Scottish Masters. These masons of the hidden valley survived and established a philosophical athenaeum called the Masons of the Orient or Brethren of the Rosy Cross of the Orient . 1256 They held their first Chapter of the Scottish Rite degree in a castle of the Knights of the Rose Croix in Edinburgh. The Superior Sovereign Grand Chapter traditionally met there until a schism in 1322. 1257 Marconis (de Negre) claims the group followed Manes ’ Manichean heresy. Manes propagated his sect of Magi in 304CE. 1258 A Mohammedan legend says Manes was born in the year five hundred and twenty-seven of the Astronomers of Babylon, which is 215 or 216CE. 1259 A more accurate date may be 257CE. Many of the Rose Croix Masons of the Orient fought in the crusades, adopting the name Knights of Palestine . 1260 Marconis notes that the Knights Templar followed this group and incorporated their ritual of the symbolic death of Hiram Abiff. 1261 The Rose Croix initiates within"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":" 314 the Knights Templar called themselves Sons of the Widow .

He says they were the descendants of the masons who had worked on the Temple of Solomon. Their documents consisted of their regulations, particular liturgy and an alchemical treatise attributed to the Roman Morien. 1263 In 1182CE, Robertus Castrensis translated this work from Arabic into Latin. 1264 It first appeared in Paris in 1559 CE. 1265 From 5BCE to 74CE the Knights of Palestine existed as Magi in Damietta, in Egypt, and kept the annals of the Order. After Titus destroyed Jerusalem in 70CE, they relocated to Scythia and a mystery place called ‘ the Thebaid ’ . The Johannite documents of the Knights of Palestine , also called the Knights of the Aurora and Palestine , may well be those same documents said to be sealed in three encased boxes in the vault of the St Clair's crypt in Rosslyn Chapel. In Chapter 11, we noted that the only known statute of Shemyaza hangs upside down in the choir of Rosslyn Chapel. It is a particular marker of the treasure in the crypt. According to the Mandaeans, this angel, as Razalel, was particularly distinguished in delivering the Book of Adam , which is known to scholars as the Codex Nasarous . The Rosslyn Chapel documents probably also include the notorious Toledot Yeshu , which the Johannites believed was written by the Apostle John, and the Mandaean Book of John (Sidra d'Yahya), which says that St John erred in baptizing the false prophet Yishu Meshiha (the Messiah Jesus), son of the devil Ruha Kadishta. It is supposedly the Knights ’ Templar true version of St John ’ s Gospel, which they copied from an original on Mount Athos. It says Jesus Jesus Christ was a false Messiah, sent by the powers of darkness, who disemminated throughout the world a perverted form of St John ’ s doctrine. The Bogomils, who also possessed this special version of the Gospel of St. John, placed it on the heads of their candidates during initiation.

Chevalier de Bonneville of the Jesuit College of Clermont in Paris established Rite of Heredom . 1266 To this day, Scottish Rite Freemasons know their eighteenth degree ceremony as the Jesuit degree or High Church degree . The Abb é Barruel claimed that this degree was the Easter Ceremonial of the Knights Templar. 1267 The Chapter of Clermont claimed to be the sole true descendant of the Knights Templar, fusing together the themes of chivalry, King Solomon ’ s Temple and alchemy. It taught that the Knights Templar recovered dishes marked for alchemical purposes of the Royal Art from a hollow corner stone in the Temple of Jerusalem. 1268 The dishes were for the preparation of an alchemical Eucharist, which we looked at in Chapter 1. They hint at the real discoveries in Jerusalem, which we shall learn more of in Chapter 20. Because of the discoveries in the Temple, Scottish Freemasonry has stronger links with alchemy than does Craft Freemasonry. The Scottish Rite focus on the Greater Mysteries reinforces it further. Frederick II (1712-86) established the thirty-third degree of the Scottish Rite in May 1786, shortly before his death. 1269 He formed this new degree to cap the existing system of twenty- five degrees. 1270 The number thirty-three has many esoteric associations. Chapter 7 showed thirty-three is a cabbalistic symbol of the sacred names of BAL and AUM . It is also the thirty-three year life of Jesus. Thrice three alludes to the Ennead of the Goddess, the Ennead of God and thrice through the Valley of Death , the third being physiological death. Frederick II, the second King of Prussia, ruled from 1740 to 1786. Old Fritz , the enlightened despot, was a highly successful military leader. He proved an able administrator, lawgiver, companion philosopher to Voltaire and d ’ Alembert, prolific writer, musician and patron of French Rococo artists such as Watteau, Pater and Lancret. 1271 Frederick was also an ardent political admirer of George Washington. While usually frugal, Frederick was an avid collector of three hundred extravagantly jeweled snuffboxes. 1272 He built the famous Masonic Rococo palace of Sans Souci at Potsdam in 1745. Sans Souci means without care . It gained considerable attention when Joseph Stalin, Harry Truman and Winston Churchill gathered at Potsdam in 1945 to decide the future of Germany. Believing"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":" 316 they were on hallowed ground, the world leaders shifted their meeting to a less controversial location. Following his role in the 1734 Rhine campaign of the War of Polish Succession, Frederick ’ s interest in philosophy accelerated. 1273 He corresponded with Voltaire in 1736, pursuing science and philosophy above all else until 1740 when he became King of Prussia. Frederick studied Christian Wolff ’ s essay Reasonable Thoughts about God in 1737. From 1740, Frederick embarked on victorious military campaigns. In 1747, Frederick commenced his celebrated supper gatherings in the Marble Hall at Sans Souci. Three years later Voltaire visited and wrote: 1274 Supper was usually taken in a small chamber whose most peculiar decoration consisted of a picture by Pesne, one of our best colorists, for which he had supplied inspiration. It was a beautiful bawdy painting. There were men embracing women, nymphs and satyrs, cupids playing games of Tag and Blind Man ’ s Buff, a number of people swooning with pleasure at the sight of these romps, cooing turtle doves, billygoats mounting nanny- goats and rams mounting ewes. Often the meals were no less philosophical affairs. Anyone entering unexpectedly and listening to our conversations would have thought he was listening to the Seven Wise Men of Greece in a house of pleasure. I do not suppose there is another house in the world where all mankind ’ s superstitions are discussed so freely and dismissed with more mockery and contempt. God Himself was not touched on; but there was no mercy towards all those who in His name had deceived mankind. Perhaps Voltaire is referring to one of the most famous French clandestine manuscripts, the profane Trait é des trois imposteurs , first edited in 1719 under the title L'Esprit de Spinosa . The Three Imposters is a highly controversial, vitriolic critique of Christianity, Judaism and Islam that refers to Moses, Jesus and Mohammed. A German officer named Tausendorff allegedly found it in the library of the Elector of Bavaria, after the victory of Hochstadt in 1703. In 1767, Voltaire actually mentioned this work, doubting its existence. However, Voltaire ’ s Sermon of the Fifty echoed it. 1275 Frederick died at Sans Souci in August 1786. His final resting- place is in a crypt at the palace. He lies with his horse and dogs in preference to the Potsdam Garrison church with his wife. This crypt is"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":" 317 quite intriguing. On 10 August 1744, Frederick commenced the terraced vineyards and crypt on the hill then known as W ü ster Berg. 1276 This was just seven years after Chevalier Andrew Michael Ramsay ’ s famous speech on Scottish Rite Freemasonry. Frederick constructed the special crypt on the topmost terrace well before finalization of the plans for Sans Souci Palace in 1745. 1277 The unusual importance of the crypt is reinforced by a beautiful rural supra porta over the door to the music salon in the palace. It shows the Havel River and palace together with a classical tomb bearing the inscription ET IN ARCADIA EGO . The artist has depicted a shepherd, shepherdesses, a flock of sheep and boatmen alongside the tomb. The famous inscription is of course the subject of Nicholas Poussin ’ s two Les Bergers d ’ Arcadie paintings of 1630 and 1640. 1278 In 1618, Il Guercino also named one of his works Et in Arcadia ego . Frederick II gave specific instructions in several wills for a quiet funeral and burial in the crypt. Perhaps to this day certain philosophical treasures lay in the classical tomb or with this great monarch in his extraordinary resting place. 1279 Louis of Bourbon, Prince of the Royal Blood of France assisted Frederick II promulgate the thirty-third degree of the Scottish Rite just before his death in May 1786. This may well have been Louis de Bourbon-Cond é , Count of Clermont and Abb é of St Germain des Pr è s, who was Grand Master of French Masonry and died in 1771. 1280 However, if the establishment date of May 1786 is correct then the Louis Bourbon in question could have been the Count of Clermont ’ s nephew, Louis Philippe-Joseph d ’ Orleans, Duke of Chartres, Prince of the Royal Blood. He continued as Grand Master until his abdication in 1793. 1281 Another prominent Louis Bourbon was the Count of Provence, who became King Louis XVIII in 1795. Louis ’ ancestry traced back to the Capetian king Louis IX (Saint Louis, 1214-1270). The line took its name from the Barons of Bourbon heir, B é atrix (d.1310), who married Robert de France, the Comte de Clermont and sixth son of Louis IX. The Count of Clermont, Louis, remained in exile in England during the French Revolution and Napoleon's rule. Following the death of ten-year-old Louis XVII, the Count of Clermont became titular king of France. France crowned him constitutional monarch, Louis XVIII, in 1814, following the abdication of Napoleon. Another heir to the throne through Robert de France, Comte de Clermont, was the Huguenot General, Henry III of Navarre. He provides"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":" 318 an important clue to the relationship of the Royal Blood of France to the lands of the Merovingians and the Jewish state of Septimania. The last Capetian king, Charles IV, had died without heir and his younger brother Charles Count of Valois assumed the throne. This Valois branch of the family then ruled France for two hundred and sixty-one years until 1589. The Dominican friar Jacques Cl é ment murdered the last of the Valois kings, Henry III (r1574-89), while he led a Huguenot attack on Paris. The childless and effeminate Henry III named his brother-in- law, the Huguenot General, Henry III of Navarre, to be his successor. Henry III of Navarre was both the nominated and the legitimate heir to the throne through his parents Antoine de Bourbon and Jeanne d'Albret, Queen of Navarre. He was born in Pau, in the autonomous Kingdom of Navarre, two hundred and eighty kilometers to the southwest. The original Basque state of Pamplona became Navarre in 824CE. It encompassed today ’ s province of northwestern Spain and the French department of Pyr é n é es-Atlantiques. It was also on the western edge of the Jewish Kingdom of Septimania indicating that Henry III of Navarre was not only a Prince of the Royal Blood but also perhaps a Prince of the greatest secret, the Royal Davidic Blood. Henry III of Navarre ascended the throne as Henry IV of France in 1593 after he finally renounced Calvinism declaring that Paris was well worth a Mass . His enthronement began 225 years of Bourbon rule. Henry ended the terrible Wars of Religion in 1598 with the Edict of Nantes, which legitimized Protestantism in France. Eight years later, Robert Naunton recorded Henry IV ’ s mystical activities in Paris. Naunton noted that Henry IV was to celebrate the Eleusian mysteries that Easter 1597. 1282 King Philippe Le Bel of France ordered the arrest of Knights Templars in France on Friday 13 October 1307. Scholars attribute his action to resentment for the riches of the Order and growing disillusionment with the cost of recapturing Jerusalem. The Order was wealthy. It owned sixteen thousand Lordships in Europe and forty thousand Commanderies. 1283 Yet, the severity of the indictment is still puzzling and not adequately explained by these factors alone. There is an absence of similar force against the Cistercians or against the Sons of Solomon . The Knights Templar was directly beholden to the Pope for its constitution. The Pope had the power to withdraw its mandate, dissolve the Order peaceably and transfer all assets. Indeed, the Pope had"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":" 319 endeavored to broker a solution before State seneschals arrested members of the Order. His plan was for the Knights Templar to amalgamate with the more conservative Order of Knights Hospitaller. However, both Orders were unreceptive to the idea. For unexplained reasons their long relationship had been uneasy. It occasionally flared with violence and it would undoubtedly do so again. In theory, the Pope could have compelled a restructure of the Orders. It was unnecessary to execute a mass arrest of all members of the Order, engage the Dominicans to extract confessions and risk the dissipation of property to overseas kings as subsequently occurred to Edward II in England. 1284 The Knights Templar could not have rebelled against a restructure or liquidation. Each knight was a monk of the Roman Catholic Church and had taken a vow of material poverty. Furthermore, if the Order had rebelled it would have had limited options for shelter. Envious monarchs continually eyed its productive land and were prepared to expropriate the assets of the Order at the first sign of any weakness in its legitimacy. The viciousness of the suppression has commercial and religious implications. Underlying the commercial imperative was a sudden decline in the fortunes of France. Philippe IV Le Belle was the eleventh king of the Capet dynasty. The House of Capet acquired the throne of France in 987CE when the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties were without immediate heir. For over three hundred years, Philippe IV's family had expanded their dominions at the expense of these dynasties and of English domains. In 1144CE, Capetian King Louis VII The Young conquered the Barons of Champagne. His son Philippe II Augustus added Flanders, Burgundy, Normandy, Maine, Brittany, Anjou, Touraine, Poitou and the Albigensian territories in the south of France. France became the most powerful nation in Europe. Subsequent Capetian ambitions proved less successful. Territories in southwest France were lost to the English by Philippe IV's grandfather Louis IX, called St Louis . Philippe III The Bold then unsuccessfully attempted to gain control of Aragon. Philippe IV had the same dismal fortune in his attempt to wrest Guienne in southwest France from England. These fruitless campaigns and France's decline from its status as the premier nation in Europe led to acute cost pressure on Philippe IV."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":" 320 Compounding his problem was the Knights Templar Order. It had absorbed a very large number of feudal estates and removed them from crown revenue. In desperation, Philippe IV increased taxes, devalued the currency and ruthlessly expropriated the assets of Jews and Italians. From a religious perspective, the Capetian family had staunchly supported the Church. It enthusiastically participated in the Crusades, suppressed heresy and formed a capable bulwark against the aspiring Merovingian and Carolingian families that threatened the fundamental legitimacy of the Church. In harboring the Melchizedek or Nazarene heresy, as we saw at the end of Chapter 11, the Knights Templar and Cistercians were negligent in their duty to the Church as an agency of that body. This also made them guilty of abusing their position of religious and commercial privilege. While Philippe IV acted because of financial pressure, his need to stabilize Capetian succession against the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties that had gained a stronghold within these Orders was perhaps the major determining factor in the indictment of the Knights Templar. The suppression of the Knights Templar therefore followed as a convenient means to achieve many aims. These were to annul debt and receive fees while piously pursuing heresy and once more disenfranchising the regal aspirations of the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties. Philippe IV ostensibly had both authority and propriety on his side. It appears that members of the Knights Templar received forewarning of their arrest. The evening before the seneschals opened their sealed orders, the entire Knights Templar fleet of eighteen galleys slipped anchor from the English controlled port of La Rochelle and headed for the Firth of Forth and the Western Isles of Scotland. Pierre d'Aumont and seven other Knights Templar, disguised as woking masons, landed on the Island of Mull They held their first chapter on St. John's Day, 1307. Robert Bruce then took them under his protection. On St. John's Summer Day, 24 June 1314, they fought with Bruce at Bannockburn against Edward II. In France, leadership of the Knights Templar passed to John Larmenius . His Charter of Transmission shows the degree of animosity felt by the French survivors towards their brothers in Scotland: 1285 I, lastly, by the decree of the Supreme Assembly, by Supreme authority committed to me, will, say and order that the Scot- Templars deserters of the Order be blasted by anathema, and that"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":" 321 they and the brethren of St John of Jerusalem, spoilers of the demesnes of the Knighthood (on whom God have mercy), be outside the circle of the Temple, now and for the future. In 1324, four years after Philippe IV suppressed the Order, Pope Harminius excommunicated the Scottish Templars. The Compagnionage claim to be the continuing Order: 1286 Our founder, Jacques Bourguignon Molay, born in Sossay in 1243. Grandmaster of the Commandery in Jerusalem in 1285. He returned to France in 1301, bringing with him the secrets of the Orient. The king and the pope were jealous of his science, of his knowledge and his authority ... He was executed on the outskirts of the citybut before his death, he gave his Master ’ s Charter to Jean de Larmenie who re-instituted our order. Our ancestors managed to purchase the head of our founder from the henchman who had removed it from the body before it burned. The skull was kept at Evreux for two-hundred years until Isaac Long – Knight - took it to Charleston where it remained until 1781 when Franklin returned it to Mans, where it lay until this day in the Temple de la Fraternite. ’ Philippe IV faced many issues of international incredulity in prosecuting the Knights Templar. However, the secrecy and arcane practices of the Order gave him the ammunition he needed. The Knights Templar learned basic Indo-Hittite philosophy through their contact with mystical Sufis. These ideas extended well past architecture and alchemy to an extended range of esoteric subjects. These included claims of heresy, homosexuality, murder and worship of a mysterious deity called Baphomet. Rumors surfaced of a second, even more mysterious Rule within the inner circle of the Order. The origin and exact meaning of the image called Baphomet is still unknown. Esoteric writers often reversed the letters of words as an elementary cipher. The Triangular Book of St Germain in Appendix 10 uses this simple technique. One solution of Baphomet reverses it suggesting: TEM OHP AB . 1287 Expanding this in Latin leads to Templi omnium pacis abbas , meaning father of the temple, universal freedom of mankind . Another solution was determined with the Atbash Cipher. Baphomet directly translates to Sophia , who is the Goddess of Wisdom (see Appendix 10 for the Atbash Cipher) . 1288 "},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":" 322 Repeated use of the Atbash Cipher can demonstrate that Baphomet is the name of the intercessor between Jehovah and the Messiah. The Atbash Cipher produces BphOM from Jehovah ( YHWH ). 1289 Using the Cipher once more, Baphomet ( BPhOMTh ) leads to Yahushua ( YHWShO ), which means The Messiah . 1290 Thus, YHWH with the letter Shin means Yahushua. Baphomet is therefore the partner of Jehovah and route to the Messiah . Thus, Baphomet figuratively gives birth to the Messiah from Jehovah. Baphomet therefore fulfills the age-old role of the Mother Goddess in the old sacrificial king rituals. She is Wisdom or Sophia, who brings forth the son of perfection. Thus, the repeated use of the Atbash Cipher through Baphomet, gives the same answer as the straightforward method, Sophia . Baphomet is therefore equivalent to the Shema or understanding that unites the one with God . This is the Shekhinah or the Virgin with Child . The contemplator who has found this understanding, himself becomes the Messiah or the self who has found purity. Chapter 15 demonstrated this with St George and the Dragon. Through this construction, the Kabbalah shows that YHWH encompasses the sacred marriage and the sacred son. Although Holy, the Virgin and child are simply component parts that unite in the Father: 1291 Shema Israel YHWH Elehenu YHWH EChad. Hear, O Israel, YHWH, our God, YHWH is one . A 1302 English seal of the Knights Templar of England shows Baphomet as Sophia . 1292 This seal depicts the star and crescent moon of Islam, together with a lion and two five-pointed stars. The star and crescent moon of Islam symbolize God, wisdom and love. Chapter 8 showed that the lion is the Lion of the Sun and of Judah and represents Q're . The two stars are Ashima representing both the moon and wisdom, and Anatha representing fertility and love. Investigators did not find Baphomet but they discovered a beautiful casket in the possession of the Knights Templar. Inquisition records describe it surmounted by: ... a great head of silver, most beautiful, and constituting the image of a woman. There was more than one gilded head seized from the Knights Templar. Marseilles held one. Vienna's Imperial Museum held others until at least 1818. 1293 There is little doubt that Baphomet represented Wisdom as the Moon Goddess Sophia . Yet, she is also God the Son because the Son, as"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":" 323 Wisdom, is also feminine. This is just the reverse of the Moon God Sin , who became Yahweh's wife Ashima . 1294 Recognition of the Son as both masculine and feminine is the key to understanding western religion. 1295 In this respect, the Son is no different than the original Edomite divinity of two thousand BCE, who was also androgenous. Elsewhere amongst the Knights Templar possessions, we would have expected to find images of the Sun and Venus, Inanna or Ishtar representing Love. In fact, the inquisition mentioned this very image of Venus, the cat goddess: 1296 ... a small image of a lion, probably of gold, with the likeness of a woman. On October 22, 1307, Jacques de Molay confessed to a group of academics at Paris University that the charges brought by King Philippe IV Le Bel were true. Jacques de Molay wrote an open letter to his Knights instructing them to confess freely. One of the leading members to do so was the Grand Treasurer, Hugh de Pairuad. He stated that he had been responsible for initiating many knights and had seen the Knights Templar god that granted them worldly wealth, made the land fertile and caused the death of their enemies. 1297 This description matches the Sumerian sun god Shamash or Zoroastrian Mithra of the broad pastures , who is not to be confused with the tauroctonous or bull slaying Mithra of the Romans. The Mesopotamian Mithra was the God of Light and Covenant with Man and a solar deity adjunct to the Persian deity, Ahura Mazda. 1298 Charles Dupuis' famous book Origin of the Cults, published in 1795, outlines that nearly all myths derive from the miracle of sexual reproduction or the movements of the planets. 1299 Along with the Lesser Mysteries of Egypt and Persia, the Knights Templar had seemingly encountered arcane Sufi and Orphic Mysteries that related to former ages of the world. 1300 We shall see the Knights Templar related to the second mysterious Rule of the Order, a version of the Greater Mysteries gone awry, through lack of information, adoption of Bogomil and Mandaean beliefs and association with the Assassins. As Vergil ’ s Fouth Ecologue shows, the shift from orthodox Christianity to the Mysteries was subtle. Vergil wrote that the Sibyl of Cuma prophesised Christ ’ s birth: 1301 We have reached the last era in the Sibylene song. Time has conceived and the great sequence of the Ages starts afresh. Justice, the Virgin, comes back to dwell with us ... The Firstborn of the New Age is"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":" 324 already on his way down from high heaven to earth. With him the Iron Race shall end and Golden Man inherit this world. Smile on the Baby ’ s birth ... this glorious Age will dawn ... the ox will not be frightened of the lion ... Your very cradle will adorn itself with blossoms to caress you ... Enter – for the hour is close at hand – on your illustrious career, dear child of the gods ... see how the whole creation rejoices in the age that is to be! ... Begin,then, little boy, to greet your mother with a smile ... Many eighteenth degree masons will recognize the seven ages of the world ’ s existence! But more than this, in their insatiable scouring of the Middle East for manuscripts relating to their Jerusalem discoveries, the Knights Templar may well have turned up two powerful Arabic manuscripts that explain the extreme sexual accusations against the Order in the context of previous ages of the world. These manuscripts are the Picatrix and the Dread Book of the Mad Arab Al Azif. In this context mad does not imply lunacy, but that Al Azif is a Magi from Media, in modern day Azerbaijan. The Picatrix is an infamous collection of Arabic astral grimoire magic that invokes the classic planetary gods of Harran, gives detailed information on the Lunar mansions and makes much of agape or fraternal feasts. 1302 The book is really the notes of the Brethren of Purity at Basra on the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus. The Picatrix title was Ghayat Al Hakim , meaning the Aim of the Wise . It seems much older than the medieval Key of Solomon does because the text makes many references to the Book of Buddha and the wise men of India timing their religious rites by Lunar Mansions, which has been the case since at least one thousand BCE. The Picatrix has a companion alchemical book called The Sages Step that specifies training in Euclidean mathematics and natural sciences as necessary for an alchemical aspirant. 1303 It also contains precise instructions for the purification of gold and silver by cupellation. The Picatrix may explain how the Knights Templar developed an understanding of the lunar system of religion in Harran. Yet, there is a much deeper mystery in the accusations against the Knights Templar. The Dread Book of Al Azif, also called the Book of the Practices of the Dead or Necronomicon, better explains this mystery. It is anmed after the Nekromanteion, a Greek Oracle of the Dead at Thesprotia, which began operating in about 800 BCE. Debate continues over the existence of this manuscript and its historical veracity. Some maintain that the Necronomicon is a hoax. Its"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":" 325 available publications seem to support this. Notwithstanding this doubt, the Magan text of the Necronomicon does reflect a number of authentic works from the Creation Epic of the Mesopotamians such as the Descent of the Inanna and with the same missing ending as traditional sources. In The History and Chronology of the Necronomicon, H P Lovecraft writes that Abdul Alhazred of Sanaa in Yemen originally wrote the Dread Book before his death in about 738CE. In 950CE, Theodorus Philetas of Constantinople translated it into Greek under the title Necronomicon . Pope Gregory IX subsequently banned the work in 1232. In principle, it remains officially suppressed today. The Dread Book seems to have some similarity with the horrific tortures carried out by Landulf II of Capua in southwest Sicily. 1304 This was the theme of black magic followed by Dietrich Eckart and Aleister Crowley. The Dread Book contains a collection of spells for awakening the monsters of the Abyss and dark places of the human imagination. We easily recognize this as St George ’ s dragon, but more on this later. The Magan text within the book deals with a time before worship of the Moon God. In fact, Dr John Dee translated part of the Dread Book as the Liber Logaeth while he was Warden of Christ's College Manchester from 1590 to 1604. 1305 Dee ’ s Liber Logaeth passed into the collection of Elias Ashmole and with Ashmole ’ s collection to the Bodleian Library in Oxford. It seemingly disappeared from the Bodleian Library following a break-in during the spring of 1934, at a time when the agents of Germany were collecting occult literature. The Liber Logaeth told the story of the Old Ones , who arrived on primal earth from dark stars . They swarmed from the oceans to build cities at the poles and raise temples to those cursed by the Gods. They ruled the earth in abomination until the Elder Lords finally acted: Casting them forth from the Earth to the Void beyond the planes where chaos reigns and form abideth not. And the Elder Lords set their seal upon the Gateway and the power of the Old Ones prevailest not against its might ... Loathsome Cthulhu rose then from the deeps and raged with exceeding great fury against the Earth Guardians. And they bound his venomous claws with potent spells and sealed him up within the City of R'lyeh wherein beneath the waves he shall sleep death's dream until the end of the Aeon ."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":" 326 We saw in Chapter 15 that the Dragon is an integral part of the Greater Mysteries. It is therefore likely that the older parts of the Necronomicon represent a Babylonian formulation of the Greater Mysteries. Its newer formulations, complete with symbols, are interpretations of the last one hundred and fifty years. Before turning our attention to the unsavory aspects of necromancy, it is helpful to understand a little more of the poem called the Descent of the Inanna . This poem appears in both the Creation Epic of the Mesopotamians and the Dread Book . Surprisingly, it allows us to outline the acceptable limit of magic in mysteries by reference to the rituals of the Roman Catholic Church. We begin with Marduk Kurios of the Double-headed Axe . Tiamat originally swallowed him but later the roles reversed. In claiming to slay the Old Ones on the Earth, Marduk was following in the footsteps of the first Indo-Hittite warrior prince in defeating the Goddess. 1306 This Gorgon-slayer was Ptersus the Destroyer . 1307 Marduk ’ s name means son of the righteous mound or KUR-KUR and is represented by a triangle of three dots. He is the son of the supreme physical god Enki, brother of Inanna, God of Jupiter and Lord of Magicians. We see him as St George killing the green dragon and as Perceval in the Arthurian romances. His color is royal lilac or purple. He is the manifestation of the Philosophers' Stone whose mark is interchangeably the Phoenix, eagle or Tau-cross hammer. The regal symbol of the double-headed eagle facing east and west is the ancient phoenix , often mistaken for an eagle. This symbol entered the rites of initiation in two ways. The Amazon-Scythian women used the famous double-headed axe or labrys , which became a popular Scythian and Greek symbol of death in the Mysteries. The dual curved blades represent the moon ’ s monthly cycle of waxing and waning. The Scythians represented initiates as a pure phoenix arising from the ash of its father. From the double- headed axe, the phoenix, too, became the double-headed badge of an Eastern Priest-King. It is the insignia of a Patriarch in the Eastern Church. In 1919, the Eastern Synod bestowed the double-headed badge of an Eastern Priest-King on the Archbishop of Canterbury. The double-headed phoenix derives also, or for the same reason, from Marduk's distinguishing emblem of the double-headed axe. 1308 The double-headed eagle represents the dual face of Marduk, Janus or Pan."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":" 327 The eagle is also the symbol of Jupiter. As time belongs to God, the double-headed divider separates eras, implicitly looking back to time past and forward to the time to come. The month January derives from Janus who symbolizes the winter solstice, the death of the old year and advent of the new. Janus also represents the death of the sacrificial king and crowning of the new king who will bring agricultural prosperity to the land. Marduk's double-headed axe is an instrument of division, the most important characteristic of a transcendent god. God created the world with this instrument of division. Division is how Yahweh created the difference between light and darkness and separated the upper firmament from the lower. 1309 Marduk similarly divided the body of Tiamat into two parts. 1310 He created the sky and earth from the waters of these halves. All sacrificial oak kings fell beneath the sacred double-headed axe, known as the labrys . 1311 This ancient weapon was the emblem of Cretan sovereignty. 1312 It combined the power of Poseidon ’ s trident with Zeus ’ thunderbolt. 1313 The priestly corporation at Delphi, the Labryadae , which still existed in Classical times, took its name from this Cretan two- headed axe used in the ceremonies. 1314 The labrys was the instrument of death and correspondingly of rebirth, represented by the two-headed bird called the phoenix. Phoenix is the masculine form of Phoenissa, the red or bloody one , a title given to the Triple Goddess who brought Death-in- Life . The smithy-god ’ s furnace and his sword, or Word in the Revelation of John of Patmos, again demonstrates the double-edged instrument of division: 1315 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. The two-edged sword is the ancient instrument of dichotomy or sorting. It is the same as an axe, divider or compass. These instruments all divide the firmament to create the world at its centre. The same act of division or measurement creates individuals. The god that wields the axe"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":" 328 or holds the hinge of the compass, which represents the unity of the whole and the order of chaos. In the Mesopotamian poem, Descent of Inanna , the goddess descends into the underworld to overcome her sister, the serpent of chaos Tiamat or Ereshkigal. She makes this perilous journey to achieve the wisdom of the Underworld: 1316 Father Enlil answered angrily: My daughter craved the Great Above. Inanna craved the Great Below. She who receives the 'me' of the underworld does not return. She who goes to the Dark City stays there. The me of the underworld is Inanna ’ s own base nature. Her death is analogous to that of St George. Inanna, like Isis and Ishtar, symbolizes resurrection and the efficacy of the elixir of life. 1317 In the underworld, Inanna falls prey to the spirits of darkness. Love becomes death. After three days, the messengers of life discover Inanna ’ s corpse impaled on a rod and resurrect her. 1318 Inanna is an image of love crucified, the earliest rose on the cross of Mesopotamia dating from at least two thousand BCE: 1319 The Annunaki, Dread Judges, Seven Lords of the Underworld drew around her. Faceless Gods of Abyss. They stared and fixed her with the Eye of Death. With the Glance of Death they killed her and hung her like a corpse from a stake. And the Elder Lords were rent with fear. Our Father Enki, Lord of Magick, receiving word by Inanna's servant Ninshubur, hears of Ishtar's sleep in the House of Death. To the Kurgarru he gave the Food of Life, to the Kalaturru he gave the Water of Life. With haste they fled through the Palace of Death, stopping only at the corpse of Inanna, the Beautiful Queen, Mistress of the Gods, Lady of all the Harlots of Ur, Bright Shining One of the Heavens, Beloved of Enki, which lay hung and bleeding from a thousand fatal wounds. Upon the corpse of Inanna sixty times they sprinkled the Water of Life of Enki. Upon the corpse of Inanna sixty times they sprinkled the Food of Life of Enki. Upon the corpse, hung from a stake, they directed the Spirit of Life and Inanna arose. The image of a serpent crucified on a tree is prominent in Israelite literature. Moses hung a bronze serpent called the nehushtan , Ne-Esthan in Greek, on his staff for the healing of the plague. 1320 The Ark of the Covenant safeguarded it for many years until King Hezekiah broke the"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":" 329 nehushtan into pieces to prevent its worship. 1321 We saw in Chapter 17 how the Rosicrucians adopted the nehushtan as their symbol of the Greater Mysteries. Moses' renowned staff had an equally miraculous history. Seth took it from the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Eden. Moses turned it into a serpent to overcome the magicians of the Pharaoh and used it to part the Red Sea. He also brought forth water from a rock at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin. 1322 It then reputedly became a structural beam in King Solomon's Temple. A serpent on a tree often symbolizes the crucifixion of Jesus, which derives from the Revelation to John of Patmos: 1323 As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up. Inanna, Jesus, St George and Lucifer are all impaled on a staff or tree. As incongruous as it seems, Jesus is Inanna as Love impaled on a staff. After three days, he receives the gifts of Wisdom, Love and resurrection. Jesus is also the serpent of Wisdom on Moses' staff, as Lucifer is the serpent on the Tree of Life. The morning star of Inanna or Venus that rises before the Sun represents either Jesus or Lucifer: We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eye-witnesses of his majesty ... And we have the word of the prophets made more certain, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. 2 Peter 1:19 has a similar verse: We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts However stark and confronting, the comparison of Jesus with Lucifer and Inanna depends very much on religious context, as we saw in Chapter 13. For example, the Roman Catholic Paschal Praeconium of Easter Holy Week refers to the two co-existing lights of Jesus and Inanna or Venus. The first is the candle of Christ as Wisdom dispelling the Luminous Night and second is the morning star of knowledge that rises from the netherworld: We beseech thee therefore, O Lord, that this candle, consecrated in the honour of thy Name, may continue to dispel the darkness of this night. And being accepted as a sweet savor, may it be united"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":" 330 with the lights supernal. May the morning star find it burning: that morning star, I say, which knows no setting. That which being returned from the depths, shineth serene upon the human race. Within this convoluted theological milieu, it is not surprising that the Knights Templar possessed a cult image of wisdom that simultaneously represented both Jesus and Inanna. Nor is it surprising that they gave testimony of a god analogous to the Son who is Life. The deity rescued from the underworld is the Son who is Life . Every year the success of his resurrection repeats with the agricultural cycle. As Isis searched for Osiris, so Inanna searches for and resurrects Dumuzi : 1324 Inanna and Geshtinanna went to the edges of the steppe. They found Dumuzi weeping. Inanna took Dumuzi by the hand and said: You will go to the underworld half the year. Your sister, since she has asked, will go the other half. On the day you are called, that day you will be taken. On the day Geshtinanna [your sister] is called, that day you will be set free. Inanna placed Dumuzi in the hands of the Eternal. In the genealogies of Sumer and Semitic Akkad, the worldly sacrificial god Dumuzi is Tammuz. Both are. In contrast is Inanna's transcendental brother, the Sun God Utu. Utu cannot impregnate Inanna even though this is Inanna's wish. He arranges Inanna's marriage to his worldly twin, the god Dumuzi: 1325 Sister, your bridegroom will go to bed with you. He who was born from a fertile womb. He who was conceived on the sacred marriage throne. Dumuzi the Shepherd! He will go to bed with you. However, Inanna acquiesces to the marriage only when Dumuzi likens himself to Utu. Transcendental Utu the Sun God is identical with Shamash the God of the Sun and God of the Covenant with man . Utu- Shamash and Inanna are children of the supreme Moon God Nanna , who became the God Sin . Utu-Shamash is also Mithra of the broad pastures and he is the perfect Gawain of the Arthurian romances. Dumuzi-Tammuz and Utu-Shamash also coalesce as twin aspects of the same individual. We have already looked at the twin character of St George and the angel Michael and in Chapter 22, we shall look further at the fundamental issue of twin characters. This factor unifies the"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":" 331 majority of Indo-Hittite myths, including the Arthurian romances of the Holy Grail. As we have seen, the Roman Catholic Church embraced these deeper mysteries and enacted them throughout the year with the involvement of the congregation. This gave rise to the Catholic description of the mysteries as the living church . Obscure as they may have been to the general congregation, these mysteries alone would not have led to the furious indictment of the Knights Templar. We have already seen that the building associates of the Knights Templar, the Sons of Solomon, carved Indian tantric kundalini images into more than six hundred pre-Reformation churches in England, Ireland, Spain and France. The problems of the Knights Templar involved even more esoteric aspects of rediscovered wisdom than we have so far discussed. Necromancy was a traditional path of scientific and philosophical investigation. Homer ’ s Odyssey described how to conjure up the dead with the same pit Romulus dug when he founded Rome: 1326 When you, hero, land there, as I tell you, Dig a pit ( ‘ b ò thron ’ ) one cubit long and wide, And around it pour out the libation for all the dead: Firstly with honeyed milk, then with sweet wine, Thirdly with water, and sprinkle white flour ... After invoking the illustrious ranks of the dead with vows, Sacrifice a ram and a black ewe, Turning them to the Erebus, but you must turn elsewhere To the river stream. There many Of the deads ’ souls will come ... In learning about Iranian and Indian mysteries, the Knights Templar would have had difficulty resisting its appeal. In fact, the Knights Templar had its own legend of necrophilia: 1327 A great lady of Maraclea was loved by a Templar, a Lord of Sidon; but she died in her youth, and on the night of her burial this wicked lover crept to the grave, dug up her body, and violated it. Then a voice from the void bade him to return in nine months ’ time, for he would find a son. He obeyed the injunction, and at the appointed time he found a head on the leg bones of the skeleton (a skull and cross-bones). The same voice bade him"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":" 332 “ guard it well, for it would be the giver of all good things, ” and so he carried it away with him. It became his protecting genius, and he was able to defeat his enemies by merely showing them the magic head. In due course it passed into the possession of the Order. Mystics have always ascribed considerable power to the god Saturn, the keeper of the last Gate. Techniques to pass through the Gate included tantric sexual magic, Indian kundalini yoga, homosexuality and Gnostic Agapoi love feasts involving male and female secretions. 1328 The infamous Aleister Crowley actively pursued these occult rituals. He joined the Golden Dawn in 1898. In 1912, he practiced sexual magic in a spurious and clandestine lodge of the Ordo Templi Orientis in Berlin. 1329 This included homosexuality, masturbation and the concocting of an elixir of life from male and female secretions. Aleister Crowley then plumbed even more perverse and highly sadistic sexual practices at the Abbey of Thelema or Thule Abbey in Sicily. 1330 This included animal sacrifice, orgies, bloody scourging, sodomy and invoking the Anti-Christ to raise the magic power of evil. Radical behavior seems normal once a consistent, albeit illogical, frame of reference emerges. This particularly applies in the absence of checks and balances. When brought to account, many people who have participated in unpleasant acts cannot understand why they thought it was acceptable at the time. The old homily absolute power corrupts absolutely bears out repeatedly. Although the Inquisition made such accusations against the Knights Templar, it is still inconclusive whether the inner circles of the Knights Templar strayed into such a frame of reference. It appears from testimony given to the inquisition that lower levels in the organization were relatively ignorant about practices at higher levels. In his righteous fever, Philippe IV would have been better to impeach only those in the inner circles rather than attempt to net the whole Order beginning with fifteen thousand members in France. It was not for another six hundred years that Vilfredo Pareto enunciated his celebrated eighty-twenty maxim. In this instance, Pareto's rule would simply hold that eighty percent of the problem, if it existed, was with twenty percent of the group. However, records show that the Pope would not intercede on behalf of the Knights Templar. The Grand Master of the Knights Templar, Jacques de Molay, declared to the Dominican Inquisition on November 26, 1308:"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":" 333 I would like to tell you certain things, if only you were not the people you are, and if you were authorized to hear it. Two days later, on November 28, 1308, Jacques de Molay again sought to confide in Pope Clement V. Pope Clement V avoided him. There was an underlying reason why the Pope did not want to be associated with his confession. The Pope even attempted to escape Paris for Rome to avoid the radical imbroglio. As with the Sons of Solomon , the Pope decided against assisting or defending the Knights Templar from accusations of unacceptable practices that may have easily entrapped him. It is highly likely that he well knew these practices included the torrid secret of the goddesses of love and maternity, Inanna, Ishtar and even Mary. They were a highly esoteric part of Church ritual as well as unusual practices within the Knights Templar. Before the son could be reborn, the lover had to die. The Knights Templar directly employed this symbolism. They said that their devotions began and ended with Mary, although these were respectively the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene. Chapter 14 showed that the Apple cut crossways shows the star of the goddess Venus, Ishtar or Inanna in her five stations from Birth to Initiation, Love, Repose and Death. Similarly, the Cistercian St Bernard described the five-petal rose as the five virtues of Mary. 1331 John Donne writes in The Primrose that this five-petal flower is sacred to the Muse. 1332 The fifth station, of Saturn or Death, is the goddess in her manifestation as a cat or lion goddess consuming the lover. Appendix 3 provides Sir Francis Bacon's own chilling description of the inescapable goddess. Fulcanelli highlighted the uncanny thread between alchemy and the religion of the Mother Goddess ’ barley cakes made with sacrificial blood at the end of the twelve nights of Saturnalia festivities: 1333 “ Gala, ” in Greek means milk, and mercury is also called Virgins ’ Milk (lac Virginis).

The Goddess ’ cycle from Birth to Initiation, Love, Repose and Death can be dualistic, being either life affirming or life rejecting. The life-affirming variation presents Death as Death-in-Life or rebirth. In the life rejecting or radical version, death is the central focus of a cycle filled with woe: The woman, because of her vulva, what harm she did! Inanna because of her womb, what did she do! All the wells of the land she filled with blood ... We have also seen from Inanna's trials in the Dread Book that the powers of darkness overcame her. These beings dwell beyond the final Gate guarded by Adar the God of Saturn. The cruel demons of the dead are Iggi from the Sumerian IGI meaning face or presence . 1335 The Iggi provide assistance in both good and evil. Marduk enlisted these foul spirits to help him overcome the Old Ones . The formulae and acts required to evoke the beings and monsters that dwell in the outer reaches of the human psyche are detailed elsewhere. 1336 A number of Christian cults such as the Cathars and Manichaeans worshipped death as well as life. In the extreme, these death rituals involved sodomy, necrophilia and cannibalism. 1337 We ponder whether the accusations of certain practices within the Knights Templar such as obscene kisses of humiliation had the same arcane significance. 1338 Drug use and sexual exploitation existed with the Arabian associates of the Knights Templar, the Assassins. Experiments in"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":" 335 the East would have involved sexual energy to raise the Iggi into visible appearance, as Solomon reputedly did. Thrill of illicit practices and the ease of trapping new initiates into the quicksand of radical dualism remain with us today. For example, many so-called neo-Templar and Rosicrucian orders ultimately exploit phallic symbolism and tantric sex. Freemasonry has repeatedly purged itself of these rituals and, along with it, much of the visible symbolism related to alchemy and the ages of the world. Gone are images of a maiden weeping over a broken column, beehives, Egyptian temples and mummies, Orphic and Mithriac mysteries and even Poisson's celebrated paintings embodying secret knowledge. The truly insightful Freemason finds little vestige of this rich heritage today. Scottish Rite Freemasonry is not quite so obscure, but it has extensively adapted the Greater Mysteries towards its own needs. In this chapter, we noted that the Hebrew word Nahash means serpent. This same word has two other literal meanings, which are He who solves Secrets and He who Knows Metals . 1339 In the next chapter, we shall see how poignant these additional meanings can be."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":" 336 Chapter 19 The Philosophers ’ Stone and Manna The Jews in Alexandria and the Rosicrucians ’ Sabian forebears in Damascus independently preserved the secret of the Philosophers' Stone. To this day, each retains its independence. We have seen that the Rosicrucian route leads back to Anatolia, to the Indo-Hittites and the scientific philosophies of metallurgy, alchemy, medicine and immortality. This route is relatively obscure because of the Rosicrucians ’ traditional low profile and intentional lack of records. Over the last three thousand years, discovery of significant documents such as the Corpus Hermeticum , Picatrix and writings of the Family of Love have been rare. In contrast, the Jews objectively documented their story through wide study of the Bible and candid writings of the great Jewish alchemists. Jewish alchemy seemed to start at the Hyksos invasion of Egypt in 1801BCE when the Israelites participated in the royal secrets of the Philosophers' Stone, known to the Old Kingdom Pharaohs. As we saw in the last chapter, the Egyptians knew the true secret of the Philosophers' Stone at the time of Imhotep, if not earlier. The annual rituals of Unas described in Chapter 16 used the Philosophers' Stone to refresh the spirit of the Pharaoh and thereby to refresh the order and fertility of the land. The Egyptian king-making ceremonies were rites that introduced the Philosophers' Stone to the new Pharaoh. They described how the Old Kingdom Pharaohs never died, but ascended a stairway to heaven. Strangely, true to the tradition, the bodies of the oldest Pharaohs and their high priests remain undiscovered. 1340 The texts of the Old Kingdom gave the Philosophers' Stone many names. It was called the golden tear from the eye of Horus , that which issues from the mouth of the Creator (the Christian Word ), and the spittle or the semen of the Father in Heaven . With the rise of the Heliopolian Amun, it later became the hidden Light : the unknowable name of the God whose title was Amun and whose symbol was the ram. Perhaps the most enigmatic name for the Philosophers' Stone was in the negative or hidden form of a question-name: What is it? This is what Basil Valentine was referring to when he said of the Green Lion: you know what it is . We shall have much more to say about the name posed as a question in Chapter 22, where we look at the Holy Grail."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":" 337 Ses ô stris I offering Shewbread to Amun in the White Chapel at Karnak"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":" 338 The Kabbalah interprets the name-question: What is it? as the word manna . 1341 It comes from Genesis and Exodus, which are probably the greatest alchemical texts ever written. Exodus tells the history of the Israelites and their reliance on manna for sustenance of the spirit: 1342 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host. And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground. And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat. With the Word of the Lord, the manna , the Israelites did not grow old nor suffer illness, suggesting a ritual experience: 1343 And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness ... And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live. Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years. The Egyptian and Tigris-Euphrates Valley societies both symbolized the Philosophers' Stone as an elongated pyramidal or conical shaped stone, about twice as tall as it is wide. It was similar to the Ben Stone and the point of Thutmose III's column, now the misnamed Cleopatra ’ s Needle in London. 1344 In Harran, in the Commagene, the 550BCE stele of Nabnoidus of Babylon depicts the royal sceptre topped with a similar wedge shape representing revealed wisdom of the Moon God Sin. Chapter 5 showed the same cone shape is the symbol of the Sumerian KUR and Q're. 1345 In Chapter 3 we looked at the sacred treasures of King Solomon's Temple recorded in the Temple of the Al Karnak, particularly the plunder from the Palestine campaign of Thutmose III. Detailed examination of these treasures shows the same elongated pyramidal or conical shapes under the items of gold. This is white bread or shewbread . 1346 This same shape is shown even earlier in the White Chapel at Karnak, where the twelfth dynasty Pharaoh Ses ô stris I presents the conical shewbread to Amun. 1347 "},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":" 339 Shewbread is Offered to Anubis Guardian of the Secret, Nineteenth dynasty, Abydos"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":" 340 In another famous bas-relief from the Pyramid Texts, the Pharaoh is shown offering shewbread to Anubis who is sitting on an ark. Anubis symbolizes the guardian of God over the secrets. 1348 Sometimes he has a sceptre made from the mysterious metal tch â m , which like orichalcum , may be platinum. 1349 Plutarch notes that Anubis, the jackal god, was born of both sisters Nephthys and Isis, who were two aspects of the same divine person: 1350 By Anubis they understand the horizontal circle, which divides the invisible part of the world, which they call Nephthys, from the visible, to which they give the name Isis; and as this circle equally touches on the confines of both light and darkness, it may be looked on as common to them both. The chest that Anubis guards represents the prime secret on which the sovereignty of the king depended. 1351 So important was this secret to Hercules that he descended into the Underworld to recover the guardian dog Cerberus . 1352 Cerberus , a dog with three heads, was the grim, watchful guardian of the entrance to Hades. The secret of preparing the Philosophers' Stone was seemingly lost to Egypt in the tumult of the Hyksos expulsion. The old legends of Zosimus and St Germain imply the Israelites plundered the secret from the Egyptians, as we saw in Chapter 14. The Bible also talks about the plunder of gold and silver from the Egyptians: And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty: But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians. 1353 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: And the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians. 1354 When the Israelites departed from Egypt, Moses knew how to make the substance known as the Philosophers' Stone , manna , chrysopoeia , aurum potable or the water of gold . Moses' skill as an alchemist is clear in the episode of the golden bull. The Israelites apparently carried through the desert sufficient gold for the Ark of the"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":" 341 Covenant, large tabernacle items like the golden vessels weighing twenty- nine talents (over one ton) each and the golden bull Atabyrius . In finding the Israelites worshiping the golden bull, Moses was outraged: 1355 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount. And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it. It is possible to dissolve and drink calcinated gold as described here. Calcination is the burning of gold in fire with deer antler or animal horn as the traditional source of calcium. Chapter 11 showed that Moses then commanded Bezaleel, the Son of Light who built the Ark of the Covenant, to prepare the Bread of Life or Bread of the Presence of God . The Melchizedek Priests set this Bread on a golden table in front of the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies. Once a week they ate the Bread of the Presence of God and more was set in place. After entering the Promised Land, the Israelites no longer consumed the Bread of Life . 1356 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year. Jesus, a Melchizedek Priest, refers to the loss of manna when he turns down the request of the masses at Capernaum: 1357 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead. Rabbinical tradition holds that the secret of the Philosophers' Stone was lost to the Israelites at the destruction of the First Temple. David Hudson has reported that in answer to his question about the existence of white powder gold, a Rabbi of Temple Beth Israel in Phoenix answered: Oh yes Mr. Hudson, but to our knowledge no one has known how to make it since the destruction of the first temple ... The white powder of gold is the magic. It can be used for white magic or black magic. Following the destruction of the First Temple, alchemy and the Philosophers' Stone remained subdued until the Hellenistic times in Alexandria."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":" 342 From four hundred BCE, until the time of Jesus, there was a remarkable acceleration of learning in Alexandria under the Ptolemaic kings of Egypt. 1358 This commenced with the break up of Alexander ’ s empire in about 321BCE, when Alexandria became the enforced home of a massive number of Palestine Jews. Ptolemy I Soter who reigned from 323BCE to 285BCE enslaved one hundred thousand Jews and brought them to Alexandria where the men served as military conscripts. His son, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who reigned from 285BCE to 247BCE, subsequently released all Jewish slaves. There were more than one hundred and ten thousand at the time. Jews then resided all over the city and a Jewish aristocracy became established on the elite east side of Alexandria. Ptolemy I Soter built the great Library of Alexandria. His son Ptolemy II Philadelphus expanded it and ordered the translation of the Torah into Greek for the benefit of the large Jewish population of Alexandria who could no longer speak Hebrew. The result was the Septuagint, finalized about 150BCE. Far from being jubilantly received, many Jewish scholars lamented that the Septuagint divulged to Israel ’ s enemies their innermost secrets and shame at the evil deeds done by their ancestors and God ’ s continual punishments for backsliding. 1359 The Alexandria Library reputedly contained five hundred thousand manuscripts and scholars could live there to study for as long as they wished. Euclid was among the first scientists to work there. It was at the Library that Aristarchos produced his remarkable treatise suggesting the moon received its light from the sun. He also studied the relative sizes and separations of the sun, moon and earth using a three hundred and sixty degree system. This era of enlightenment was not to last. Diocletian, Emperor of Rome from 284CE to 305CE, was paranoid about Christianity and the occult. He sought out and burned all Egyptian works that concerned the chemistry of gold and silver. His reason for this was to prevent his enemies making use of occult science against the Romans. 1360 In a last effort to block Christianity, he declared Mithraism as the official religion of the Roman Empire. Diocletian may have been concerned about rumors of a fearful alchemical secret, that of the legendary Shamir . In Rabbinical tradition, the Shamir was a giant worm that could cut stones. 1361 The secret of the Shamir was probably in the hands of the Essenes in Alexandria. We know from Philo of Alexandria, who lived from 20BCE to 50CE, that the"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":" 343 influence of the Essenes of Egypt, known in the first century CE as Therapeuts, was particularly strong in Alexandria. 1362 Hippolytus recorded Essenes were still in Egypt in 250CE. Excavations at Qumran have shown that the Essenes operated a furnace and carried out metallurgical works. 1363 Alchemical works continued in this same area long after the Roman campaign against Massada. For example, the nearby village at the spring of Engedi was engaged in esoteric activities. Engedi was the site of a famous Essene college similar to Callirrho ë and Modein. A mosaic inscription in the floor of the fourth century CE synagogue at Engedi includes a curse, which is the only sinister curse ever discovered in a synagogue: 1364 Whoever reveals to the gentiles the secret of this village, the one whose eyes roam over the entire earth and sees what is hidden will uproot this person and his seed from under the sun. One theory is that the Essenes collected white salts from evaporated holding ponds in the Dead Sea. They sought material at the surface where sodium chloride had already dropped away by fractional crystallization. They manufactured alchemical gold employing a tower five hundred meters up the hill for a gravity feed to a reverberatory furnace. The tower still exists. Appendix 3 describes the method supposedly used by King Solomon to make his one hundred thousand talents (about three thousand eight hundred tons) of alchemical gold . The priestly secret of alchemy had much in common with the secrets of early glass manufacture and fabric dying. During the Roman period, the great glass-making site of Jalame in Western Galilee produced excellent Roman glass. 1365 The special timbers required in firing this low potassium, low magnesium Roman glass were the symbolic trees of Beech, Oak and Apple. 1366 A traditional source of glass making sand was at the mouth of the Belus River. This was the town of Ptolemais, now called Acre. 1367 Josephus and Pliny mention it, noting that the sand here would form crystals. These were crystals of quartz and chalcedony in the presence of calcium from decayed seashells. 1368 Josephus writes that many ships called to load sand for glassmaking and that nature constantly replenished it. Josephus described a very unusual property of these crystals: if they overflowed the basin, they reverted to ordinary sand. Josephus preserves alchemical secrets in his writing. He does so elsewhere. Quite out of context with his discussion of the hilltop fortress of Machaerus, Josephus refers to a certain root growing at Barras. This is"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":" 344 Pliny ’ s mandrake and it is an allegorical description of the Great Work: 1369 In a ravine which protects the town on the north is a place called Baaras, where grows a root of the same name. This is flame- colored, and at dusk it sends out brilliant flashes so that those who come near in the hope of plucking it cannot take hold of it, as it slips away and will not stay still until it is drenched with a woman ’ s urine or menstrual blood. Even then to touch it means certain death, unless one happens to have brought an exactly similar root dangling from the wrist. It can also be secured another way without risk, thus – they dig right around it, so as to leave the smallest possible piece of root in the ground; then they tie a dog to it and when he springs forward to follow the man who tied him, it is easily pulled up, but the dog dies instantly – a substitute for the person who was going to remove the plant; for no danger remains for those who subsequently handle it. Despite the greatness of the danger it has one virtue that makes it sought after; for the so called devils – in reality the spirits of evildoers that enter the living and kill them if they are not rescued – are quickly cast out by this plant if it so much as touches the possessed. Here too flow springs of hot water differing widely in flavor, some being bitter and others very sweet indeed. There are also many fountains of cold water, and these do not all issue from wells on low ground in a row; the truth is more surprising, for there is a cave to be seen nearby, not hollowed out to any great depth, but sheltered by a rock that juts out. Above this protrude, as it were, two breasts a little way apart, sending out water, in one case icy, in the other boiling hot. When mixed these furnish a most pleasant bath, beneficial in many sicknesses and giving special relief to tired muscles. The region also contains sulphur and alum mines. The real mandrake or Mandragora officinalis is one of the most striking plants of Lebanon and the Plain of Sharon. It has a central bunch of dark-blue, bell-shaped blossom on a flat disk of very broad primrose- like leaves. Wei Boyang, a Chinese alchemist of the second century CE, relates a similar tale: 1370 One day Wei Boyang Passed into the mountains to prepare numinous elixirs. With him and went three disciples, two of"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":" 345 whom were, he felt, lacking in faith and sincerity. When the elixir was achieved he decided to make a trial of them. The gold elixir is now made, he said, but it ought first to be tested. Let us give it to this white dog; if the animal lives and can soar into the air then will be safe for human beings, but if the dog should die then it is not to be taken. So Wei Po-Yang They did it to the dog, and the dog immediately fell down dead. Turning to the disciples he said: I feared the elixir was not perfected. As it has killed the dog into would seem that we have not grasped the fall of theory of spiritual power. If we take it now I am afraid that we shall go the same way as the animal. What do you think we should do? The disciples, perplexed, replied by another question: Would you, sir, dare to take it yourself? He answered: I abandoned worldly ways and forsook family and friends to enter into the mountains; I should be ashamed to return without having found the Tao of the Holy in Immortals. To die of the elixir would be no worse than living without it. I must take it. And he did, whereupon no sooner was it in his mouth than he fell dead. One disciple took the elixir and died. When the other two had gone, the seemingly dead master, his disciple and the white dog recovered and journeyed along the mountain path of the immortals. This elixir was made from the climbing plant Asclepias acida ( “ AA ” ), which is milkweed. This is a similar herb to the European swallowwort or Vincetoxicum hirundanaria . It is a medicinal antidote whose name means defeat the poison . The first century CE Greek physician and pharmacologist, Dioscorides, called the plant the dog strangler and wrote that the leaves it mixed with meat could kill dogs, wolves and foxes. 1371 In the Switzerland, swallowwort is called the Master Herb and in Austria Jewish herb or White Cross herb . The Persians and Indians both made their sacred drinks, Hoama and soma , from fermented Asclepias acida juice, mixed with milk, butter or honey. 1372 After drinking the nectar, the adept entered a death-like state for several days. Upon waking, he experienced a state of ecstasy for a few days with higher consciousness, visionary powers, inexhaustible strength and vitality. All 114 hymns in the ninth book of the Rig Veda (circa 1500 BCE) are dedicated to soma : 1373 We have drunk soma, we have become immortal; we have gone to the light; we found the gods."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":" 346 The Soma plant Asclepias acida has small, fragrant white flowers at the end of its branches and few leaves. Christian graves in Rome ’ s catacombs have drawings of a variety of this plant showing long fruits, which is not found in Europe. The early Israelites and Edomites used the burning bush datura stramonium, commonly called the thorn apple. It is the only plant to grow on rocky high places such as Jebel Madhbah at Petra. The spiny black fruit has long been used as a folk medicine and intoxicant. Diodorus Siculus wrote that the priests used its fruit to bring on fantasy, which they say is the voice of their god . 1374 It seems that the thorn apple is Eden ’ s forbidden fruit because the peculiar feature of the thron apple is that it produces a vapour that burns without the bush being consumed. There are references to the thorn apple in Homer ’ s Odyssey and Shakespeare ’ s plays Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, and Anthony and Cleopatra. In recent times it has been found to control severe brain cancer. 1375 While in times that are more recent, the Persians made Soma from Asclepias acida , some scholars now suggest that the ancient recipes in the Rig Veda strongly imply that Soma was made from two stones or rocks ( adrau ) in the mountains ( girau ). It is quite likely that Soma had its true source in metals before they used hallucinogenic plants like Asclepias acida and more recently, Cannabis At the end of Chapter 2, we saw that volcanoes produce ores with iridium and rhodium that can be used to manufacture ORMES and healing monatomic materials. Rig Veda recipes say that a divine Eagle fetches Soma from Heaven. 1376 The Eagle extracts it from a metal fortress in the form of golden-yellow ( hari ) and reddish-brown ( aruna ) rocks, which are probably yellow gold-quartzite and reddish-brown gold- platinum ores. The Rig Veda also says the priests crushed the collected material with noisy grinding stones, which sounds more like heavy ore grinding than squeezing plants. Then they washed it free of impurities, filtered it through a woolen fleece ( avi ) and cooked it in water. The Rig Veda says the final product is clothed in robes of milk . They called it the Milk of Heaven or Milk of God . Returning to the manufacture of glass, we find the metals of alchemy used extensively, such as gold for ruby red color and antimony as a decolorant and opacifier. 1377 This red-golden, transparent, antimony glass symbolizes the new Jerusalem. The glassblowers of Murano, north of Venice, still manufacture rose lamp glass from gold. Many of these"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":" 347 precious lamps decorate churches, in particular Jesus ’ tomb in Jerusalem ’ s Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Although invented by Johann Kunkel in Potsdam in about 1680, the earliest example of ruby-glass dated with certainty is a pair of fine Baroque ruby glass beakers in the Treasury of Copenhagen ’ s Rosenborg Castle. Duke Julius Franz of Saxony-Lauenburg polished these beakers in 1689. The Egyptians used antimony in glass making since at least the time of Tuthmose III. The religious secret of antimony glass provided the wondrous translucency of the stained glass windows at Chartres Cathedral. 1378 The alchemical technology for this special glass suddenly appeared in the first quarter of the twelfth century CE and just as abruptly disappeared in the middle of the next century. 1379 The famous Purple of Cassius was, for example, a colorant made from the body of God . It was in use long before its official discovery in 1685. The presence of the Purple of Cassius in glass figuratively endowed light with the body of God . Chartres ’ Blue was similarly a particularly beautiful unsaturated blue that delighted the senses. It was a feature at Chartres Cathedral. 1380 As the Essenes were quite familiar with glass making and the chemistry of gold, they would have been in possession of the materials to make the explosive called gold fulminate. Gold, Aqua Regia and potash make this highly unstable explosive. Aqua Regia dissolves the gold and the addition of potash precipitates gold hydroxide. Potash is potassium carbonate from the ashes of burnt wood. Adding ammonia ( sal ammoniac ) to the gold hydroxide then forms gold fulminate. It becomes very explosive when dry and is difficult to handle. Dissolving silver oxide in ammonia makes fulminating silver, which is also very explosive when dry. The alchemist masons who employed gold fulminate as an explosive would have prepared it on-site. To cut a block or stele with precision, the masons would have poured a fulminate slurry into a series of chiseled-out hollows, allowed it to dry and then set off a chain reaction to separate the rock. Modern gunpowder is a less expensive explosive made from seventy-five percent potassium nitrate, ten percent sulphur and fifteen percent charcoal. The alchemist monk Roger Bacon first revealed it in the West in the early fourteenth century CE. 1381 At that time, gunpowder was a mixture of Brimstone, Sulfur and Saltpeter. China first discovered the secret in one thousand CE. As soon as gunpowder appeared in"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":" 348 England, the Crown seized the rights and began to manufacture it under Crown monopoly. Both fulminating gold and original gunpowder used regular alchemical raw materials like saltpeter, which was a common source of nitric acid for Aqua Regia. Yet, only fulminating gold is likely to have been the Shamir . This is because it had two characteristics that would have disenchanted monarchs and therefore allowed it to remain comparatively secret. The first was that any significant use of fulminating gold required a monarch to delve deeply into his gold reserves. The second reason was that the strategic use of the fulminating gold was severely limited because it was unstable. Unskilled soldiers could neither prepare nor handle the dangerous substance. Moses and the authors of the Bible at the time of King Solomon may have known about gold fulminate. For example, Moses referred to the massive destruction the Lord would wreak on the land with brimstone and salt if the Israelites abandoned his covenant: 1382 And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the Lord overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger? It is also possible that the story of Joshua ’ s destruction of Jericho is an indirect reference to the terrible power of the Shamir . 1383 In fact, Joshua reserves the metals in the city for the Lord ’ s treasury, perhaps with an eye to replenishing his stores. 1384 In old Masonic tradition, the Shamir is one of the secrets that Hiram Abiff refused to surrender to his murderers. The Old York ritual refers: 1385 ... to the wonderful properties of that noble insect the SHAMIR, which cut and shaped all the sacred utensils and holy vessels in King Solomon ’ s Temple... the wonderful creature that could cut stones . The crest of Earl St Clair of Orkney and the documents in the St Clair libraries prominently show the Shamir . Earl St Clair was the Scottish ruler who sheltered fugitive Knights Templar and their fleet, when it escaped Philippe IV ’ s suppression order. His family subsequently became hereditary Grand Masters of Freemasonry.

The secret still holds fascination but today it is likely to be one of those empty secrets that are now all too common in hermetic alchemy. Following the destruction of alchemical works by Diocletian, the famous Library of Alexandria was itself burnt to the ground by a Christian mob in 390CE. This loss of the Library, followed by the gruesome murder of the beautiful mathematician Hypatia by a gang of monks twenty-five years later, ushered in Europe ’ s Dark Ages. The story of the Philosophers' Stone lay dormant in the West for another six hundred years, until the time of the Crusades when rumors seeped out that the Knights Templar had found something very exciting. Troubadours of the Holy Grail romanced this discovery to a fascinated Europe, as we shall see in Chapter 22. Alchemists and kings vigorously sought the Philosophers ’ Stone as a wonderful medicine that had the power to repair the human body and increase human life almost indefinitely. The Bible itself had declared that Melchizedek the King of Salem, who first possessed the Philosophers' Stone, would live forever. 1386 Flavius Josephus seemed to confirm this when he recorded that the Essenes had extraordinary lifetimes of greater than one hundred years. 1387 Georgian people in the mountains above Colchis reputedly enjoyed similarly bounteous lifespans of one hundred and ten years. 1388 In 1220CE, with Grail romances echoing around Europe, the alchemist Artephius claimed he had lived a thousand years. 1389 The Comte St. Germain was supposed to have lived for more than one hundred years. He was a prominent Jewish alchemist who made known that his special color was, as we might imagine, green tinged with blue. Baron de Gleichen, who knew St. Germain well, refuted his long life maintaining that St. Germain had said to him: These stupid Parisians believe that I am 500 years old; I confirm them this idea since I see that it gives them much pleasure. However, this does not mean that I am infinitely older than I look. Various sources 'sighted' St. Germain in 1835, 1926 and 1934, although his death is well recorded on February 27, 1784, and by his own admission he seems to have been ninety-two or ninety-three at the time. The year of his birth is unknown. Nicholas Flamel who lived from about 1330 to 1418 was a Grand Master of the Prieure du Notre Dame du Sion and a well-known"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":" 350 alchemist. He is also reputed to have been alive some three hundred years after his recorded death. Paul Lucas wrote in 1712 that he met a Dervish in the streets of Bursa in Turkey who said that he had come from Uzbekistan. The Dervish related in great mirth that Flamel and his wife were living in India. Ayurvedic Indian alchemy, called Rasa Shastra , claims people alive today aged three hundred years. The Ayurvedic texts repeatedly say gold is immortality . 1390 Following the translation of the great Arabian sources, the flurry of Grail Romances and suppression of the Knights Templar, alchemy became dormant for a further three hundred years. As we saw in Chapter 17, the Church had prohibited alchemy and all scientific investigation. Only scattered Jewish alchemical scandals and anonymous alchemical publications punctuated this blanket of silence. Alchemy gave birth to modern chemistry in the sixteenth century. The key event was when Antoine Lavoisier showed that water separated into hydrogen and oxygen, and then recombined as water. He wrote that oxygen sustained combustion, oxidized the elements and was susceptible to recovery. Lavoisier summarized his big bang in chemistry with the words: Nothing is created and nothing is destroyed, all is transformed . Following his discovery, reason totally prevailed over metaphysics in chemistry. For all his greatness, poor Lavoisier had a sad end on the guillotine because he was also a State farmer-general at the commencement of the French Revolution. Yet the new chemistry he catalyzed made rapid scientific advances. It quickly distanced itself from alchemy's inherent imposture and fraud. The Rosicrucian influence then revived once more with Dr John Dee, Shakespearean literature, the cautious writings of Paracelsus and the mystical works of Fludd and Maier in the seventeenth century. This tiny trickle received some impetus with the Invisible College and Royal Society. It became a gentle stream when the English chemists and physicists Robert Boyle, William Cooper, Eireneus Philalethes and Sir Isaac Newton began to bring bona fide chemical and alchemical investigations some respectability. The tentative revival of alchemy then became a veritable flood in the late eighteenth century with the popularity of Freemasonry in England and Rosicrucianism among German Masonic-alchemical groups. It is at this time that we see the emergence of groups with remarkable names such as the Brothers of the Boiled Dew ."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":" 351 Many of these fringe groups were reviving Jewish traditions preserved in Rabbinical and Arabian treatises. In the next chapter, we look at one of the most intriguing aspects of alchemical studies, Jewish traditions that allude to what the Knights Templar really found under King Solomon's Temple."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":" 352 Chapter 20 The Ancient of Days The philosophy of the qabb ³ l â or Kabbalah is set out in the Sepher Yetzirah or Book of Creation , written in three hundred CE. It describes a cosmology based on numerical correspondence, such as the sevenfold planets with the seven days of the week and the seven openings in the head. Another is the twelvefold zodiac with the twelve directions of space, twelve months of the year and twelve organs of the body. It teaches that dualistic good and evil do not tear the cosmos. Instead, positive and negative energies hold the cosmos in polarity. The method of salvation is through becoming aware of oneself as a microcosm. This seats the King on his Throne in the centre of life. The concept of the King on his Throne was a common symbol for Osiris in ancient Egypt. The throne was Isis and she was the female counterpart of the male, making the whole of God. 1391 The young Horus often sat on her lap as the king reborn. Many a Pieta shows the young Virgin Mary as the throne, nursing Jesus. The Zohar or Book of Splendor is the magnus opus of the Spanish-Jewish Kabbalah. 1392 Its name derives from ZHR meaning to illuminate . It is both a mystical novel based on the Torah and a commentary of the Pentateuch. Rabbi Simon bar Yochai wrote the Zohar in the second century CE but it was apparently edited by Moses bar Shem Tov of Leon of Granada who died in 1305. Moses of Leon published the Zohar in 1290. Just before his death, he added three influential and enigmatic books. 1393 These were the Book of the Concealed Mystery (BoM), the Greater Holy Assembly (GHA) and the Lesser Holy Assembly (LHA). Together they represent only three percent of the Zohar. In the Lesser Holy Assembly , Moses of Leon is dictating from his deathbed: 1394 The Reapers of the Field are few And only at the edge of the vineyard. ... Rabbi Shim ’ on sat down He cried, and said, ‘ Woe if I reveal! Woe if I do not reveal! ’ His dying breaths imparted the secret knowledge of manna and the Ancient of Days : 1395 And all of them (the holinesses) come from the upper head of the skull ... from the direction of the upper brains ... and this blessing"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":" 353 flows into all the vessels of the body, until it reaches those that are called the ‘ hosts ’... And, that flow, after it is collected there, it stays there, and then goes to that holy foundation. It is all white, and therefore it is called ‘ mercy ’ . And this mercy enters the Holy of Holies, as it is written (Ps 133:3): ‘ For there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore. ’ Here blessing and mercy are two of the original Hebrew names for manna . 1396 Another is the charity of God . Both the Zohar the Denudata , another Kabbalah text, describe The Ancient of Days as having a furnace and three skulls. The prophet Daniel, reputedly a great alchemist, wrote of the Ancient of Days in the Book of Daniel: 1397 I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him ... and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of Days ... The Ancient of Days had only one eye known as the Eye of Providence . It shone with blinding brightness. The Ancient of Days ’ sophistication is similar to Hephaestus ’ legendary robotic smithy on Mount Olympus, where he manufactured some sort of vehicle: 1398 He was making twenty tripods To place around the walls of the fine hall: He was fitting golden wheels under their bases, So that they by themselves could enter ( ‘ aut ò matoi dysaiato ’ ) the gods ’ meetings, Then return home ( ‘ pr ò s d ô ma neo ì ato ’ ). It is wonderful to look at! ... Two golden maids ... Looking like living girls, Had a mind in their breasts ( ‘ n ò os met à phresin ’ ), they had voice And strength. ...

Our investigations have been conventional to this date. The foundation has been reasonably scholarly. We now dip well below the scholarly threshold into the kaleidoscopic realm of speculation. British engineers George Sassoon & Rodney Dale have interpreted this description of the Ancient of Days as a machine for manufacturing manna , a kind of still, described in anthropomorphic terms. 1399 The engineers saw the still as a bacterial multiplier for manufacturing bread. They may well have been on the right track, but misinterpreting common bread for sacramental bread. Stills similar to the description of the Ancient of Days are commonplace in alchemy, particularly the double pelican with two interlocking cucurbits. 1400 Moses of Leon describes the operation of the Ancient of Days as follows: 1401 Into the skull ... distils the dew from the white head ... and covereth it. And that dew appeared to be of two colors and by it nourished the field of the holy apple trees. And from this dew of this skull is the manna prepared for the just in the world to come. And by it shall the dead be raised to life. And the manna did not appear to be derived from this dew except at one time: the time when Israel was wandering in the desert. And the Ancient One of All fed them from this place. But afterwards, it did not fall out so more fully. The ceasing of the manna in the Bible is analogous: 1402 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":" 355 Caleb seems to have taken the machine that made manna to Hebron: 1403 I conveyed the Divine Spirit through the water of Jordan to the level of the vale of Hebron. The two British engineers also believe that the Israelites relocated the Ancient of Days to Shiloh after it ceased production in Hebron. Shiloh is forty kilometers north of Jerusalem. The Children of Dan supervised the holy objects. 1404 Amongst them was a dedicated band of priests called the Reapers of the Holy Field . 1405 Their name derives from those who collect the manna from the dew in the field of holy apples . 1406 The engineers contend that Psalm 133 of David is included in rituals of the Zohar , Knights Templar initiation and Freemasons initiation for a special reason. It is a perpetual reminder of the Ancient of Days and the dew , manna , Philosophers' Stone or What is it? that was lost: How good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in unity! It is like the precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running down Aaron ’ s beard, down upon the collar of his robes. It is as if the dew of Hermon was falling on Mount Zion. For there the Lord bestows his blessing, even life forevermore. In addition, the Zohar says the same thing: 1407 “ Come and see: Every single day, dew trickles down from the Holy Ancient One to the Impatient One, and the Orchard of holy Apple Trees is blessed. Some of the dew flows to those below; holy angels are nourished by it, each according to his diet, as it is written: ‘ A human ate angel bread' 1408 Israel ate of that food in the desert. Rabbi Shim ó n said: “ Some people are nourished by it even now! Who are they? The Comrades, who engage Torah day and night. Do you think they are nourished by that very food? No, by something like that very food; two balancing one. ... The food that comes from higher above is finer food, coming from the sphere where Judgment is found."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":" 356 ... Happy is the portion of the righteous! As we saw earlier, there is manna is Mercy and there is no Judgment without Mercy. Also from the Skull of the Microprosopopeia : 1409 When the White Head decided to add to its beauty with an ornament, it sent out a spark from its own light. It breathed on the spark to cool it, and the spark grew firm. It expanded and hollowed itself out, like a blue transparent skull enclosing thousands, myriads of worlds. This cavity is full of external dew, white on the side of the Father, red on the side of the Son. It is the dew of light and life, the dew that engenders and resurrects the dead. Some are resurrected in light, others in fire. Some are in the eternal whiteness of peace, the others in the redness of fire and the torments of war. “ The wicked are the disgrace, so as to speak, of their father, and it is they who cover the face with its redness. In this skull of the Universal Man, only begotten Son of God, resides Knowledge, with its thirty two paths and its fifty gates. ” However, not everyone enjoyed manna . The fearful Watchers of the Book of Enoch, the Nephilim , had such large appetites that God gave them manna, of many different colors. 1410 They rejected God ’ s offer, preferring the flesh of animals and man, fouling the air with sickly vapors. It was then that God decided to cleanse the earth. The Zohar ’ s explanation makes compelling evidence that the manufacture of manna or dew is the great secret that was lost. Other descriptions by Jewish alchemists support this somewhat unconventional conclusion. For example, Michael Maier writes of Maria the Jewess: 1411 But the whole secret, she says, is in the knowledge of the Vessel of Hermes , because it is divine, and is, by the wisdom of the Lord, hidden from the gentiles. Among the many names Elias Ashmole lists as being applied to the Philosophers ’ Stone is the Hebrew Tetragrammaton jud he voph h é . 1412 The finding of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton is hermetically equivalent to finding the secret of the Philosophers ’ Stone. Abraham Eleazar ’ s talks of the Tetragrammaton in his fourteenth century book Uraltes Chymisches Werck , the Book of Light . A much earlier source called The Great Secret of the Master Tubal-Cain gave him the secret: the Hebrew Tetragrammaton is in a cave at the bottom of a"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":" 357 long passage, five hundred spans under the Holy of Holies. A fire that kills protects it. The Copper Scroll of the Dead Sea Scrolls reveals that foundations of the Temple concealed large amounts of gold and important texts at the time of the Roman assault of 67CE to 70CE: 1413 Item 7: In the cavity of the Old House of Tribute, in the Platform of the Chain: sixty-five bars of gold. It may be that the six hundred talents of gold (about twenty-three tons) under the Temple was an input for an alchemical process rather than simply a store of wealth. It may have been feedstock for making the Philosophers ’ Stone. To encourage the Jews to redouble their efforts to find the lost Philosophers' Stone, Abraham Eleazar writes: For you should know that God the Highest will promise and give you His blessing so that you should enjoy the breadth of the land and drink the dew of heaven. This is the same exhortation as found engraved on copper tablets in the manuscript of Samuel Baruch . 1414 Samuel Baruch writes that the ultimate achievement is: the great mystery of the world, the life and food of the holy souls and angels, out of whose dew the heaven comes and the fatness of the earth . In addition, he adds: My sons, I have sketched in figures the secrets of the great world, and also its meaning according to its inner secret understanding, as Moyses our brother had learned it from Tubal-Cain, and left it behind, to your great joy, to find the Mighty One in Israel, in figures, as well as His servants and angels, together with the powers of the innermost receptacle in centro of the natures . Finally, alchemists from generation to generation hand down a dire warning: That quintessence is a holy balsam and also a poison. This is all medicine, and without the help of God it is without fruit, it kills and destroys.... This is the great secret of the fathers, this is what God gave them as a consolation, which they used when they were in plight and trouble; otherwise they did not use it, because they were satisfied with the Highest, and with little. This was the masterpiece of the wise masters with which they prepared everything necessary that belonged to the Temple."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":" 358 We now delve even deeper into the realm of speculation. The Jewish stories show that the French knights who excavated the foundations of King Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem found more than gold. Let us hypothesize that they found the secret treasure of the Melchizedek Priests that they were looking for. It was an old gold processing machine that had long been disused and was almost forgotten. The Holy Order of Knights Beneficent of the Holy City tell the legend of how Hugues des Payens and the first Knights Templars, while repairing the house King Baldwin II of Jerusalem gave them, excavated in the ruins for materials. They found an iron trunk with many extremely valuable things, including the scientific process of the Great Work taught to Solomon and his confidants by Hiram Abiff, whom Solomon ’ s friend and ally, Hiram King of Tyre, sent to them. 1415 The Knights Templar fervently scoured Europe, Palestine, Arabia, Persia and Ethiopia for knowledge of the operating instructions. It is highly probable that any mysterious technology they found was as puzzling as it had been to the Reapers of the Holy Field . They would have followed the only time-proven course of action. This was to adhere to the advice of the Jewish Rabbis and Sufis and hide the machine until time or circumstance should provide a clue to its unique benefits. Where is it ? This question is as enigmatic as the original question-name: What is it? The exact location of the Israelite secrets lies with the descendants of the Cistercians. The Knights Templar Order, for all its intrigue, was only the minder of the secret. They protected it but did not necessarily know the meaning of it nor understand it. Initially, the knights of St Bernard were laymen. They received their constitution or Rule as Knights Templar, as a reward for their success in finding the secrets of the Temple. The new organization also provided protection for the coveted secrets. While the Knights Templar has always been of considerable esoteric interest, it was the Cistercian Order that owned the secret and controlled the Knights Templar. The Cistercians were a monastic order founded in 1098CE at C î teaux by Benedictine monks from the Abbey of Molesme. St Bernard, who lived from 1090 to 1153, joined the monastery of C î teaux in 1113. Two years later, he became the founding abbot of Clairvaux. The Cistercians then became the most influential order within the Roman Catholic Church. Over the next fifteen years, they established more than three hundred monasteries. St Bernard built sixty-eight of these. The"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":" 359 number of Cistercian monasteries eventually grew to over seven hundred throughout Europe, Britain and Palestine. The mother order of the Cistercians was the Benedictines, created by St Benedict at Monte Cassino in 529. People commonly called them black monks because of their black tunic and scapular. In stark contrast, the Cistercians adopted a white or grey tunic. It was an emblem of the purity fitting of their Jerusalem discoveries and they became the white monks . In April 1310, Brother Aymery of Limoges lodged a defense in the name of the Knights Templar that highlighted the central role of St Bernard in establishing the Order on behalf of the Cistercians. He addressed the Order ’ s defense to God and said: 1416 Thine Order, that of the Temple, was founded in General Council in honour of the Sainted and Glorious Virgin Mary, Thy Mother, by the Blessed Bernard, Thy Holy Confessor, chosen for this office by the Holy Roman Church. It is he who, with other upright men, instructed the Order and gave it its mission. Nine lay French knights, led by Hugues de Payns, excavated under King Solomon's Temple on Mount Zion in 1118. A decade later, in 1128, the knights returned from Jerusalem in triumph because their excavations had been extraordinarily successful. St Bernard says he sent his triumphant knights to Champagne and Burgundy under the protection of the Count of Champagne: 1417 The work has been accomplished with our help. And the knights have been sent on the journey through France and Burgundy, that is to say Champagne, under the protection as we shall see, of the Count of Champagne, where all precautions can be taken against all interference by public or ecclesiastical authority; where at this time one can best make sure of a secret, a watch, a hiding place. The ingenious St Bernard sent his knights and their precious charge to the ancient Merovingian region in southern France. They ultimately hid their Israelite cargo at Mt Cardou near Rennes le Ch â teau. 1418 German miners burrowed out a cache in the mountain for their treasure. 1419 This is consistent with old traditions that suggest the Holy Grail rests in a lonely chapel on a mountain. 1420 There is a surprising piece of evidence that precisely confirms the importance of Mount Cardou: King Philippe IV ’ s harsh suppression of the Order exempted the Mallorcan Mas Deus Commandery of Knights Templar at B é zu who guarded Mount Cardou from nearby Blanchefort"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":" 360 Castle. 1421 There were a number of preceptories and lookouts that did not immediately fall to Philippe Le Bel because they were on lands controlled by nobles. Such areas included Champagne, Lorraine, Savoie, Provence. In the Pyrenn é es, the counts of Carcassonne and Toulouse, the nobles of Barcelona and Aragon, and the Roussillon clans which included the family Fenouillet controlled areas around Renne le Chateau including B é zu, Les Tripl é es, Commes-Sourdes and Lavaldieu. With the dissolution of the Knights Templar, the Cistercians went into decline and reform. The Feuillants emerged as a reformed Cistercian order in 1586. For the sins of their mother Order, they paid the penance of eating only bread and vegetables seasoned with salt. They drank only water and the Order permitted no furniture for their comfort. Total silence, prayer and manual labor occupied their days. A second group of reformed Cistercians, called the Trappists , began a similar penance in 1662 and became known as the Cistercians of the Strict Observance . They devoted themselves to absolute silence, prayer, reading and manual work. They did not eat meat, fish or eggs. With the emergence of the Trappists , the original order became the Cistercians of the Common Observance . It is certain that at the time the Knights Templar were indicted, the Cistercians would have been under at least as much pressure and given up any outstanding secrets to the Pope. Yet, there is no indication the Cistercians delivered their secrets at any time. Chapter 18 showed that the Pope was unwilling to help the Knights Templar or even listen to their secrets. From this we may conclude that the Church already had knowledge of the great find and considered that the Knights Templar had nothing further to add to this knowledge. Papal indifference to the Knights Templar suggests that the secret still lies concealed in the place where St Bernard's knights originally buried it, at Mt Cardou. The cellars of the Cistercians and the cache in Mt Cardou near Blanchefort Castle are not the only repositories of Knights Templar secrets. The Melchizedek families would have followed their age-old policy of hiding the secrets in at least three places, as was the Essenes ’ policy with the Dead Sea Scrolls. For example, documentary evidence is also likely to be stored in the extensive vault of Earl St Clair ’ s Rosslyn Chapel, five kilometers south of Edinburgh in Scotland. The Chapel is only seven kilometers from the ruined Scottish headquarters of the Knights Templar at Balantrodoch, now called Temple.

Over three years and nine months he collected an immense fortune. He brought unusual plants from China, including the everlasting Lord Anson's Blue pea . Richard Walter and Benjamin Robin recounted his famous voyage in their book Anson's Voyage . George Anson entered the Royal Navy at fifteen years of age. Commissioned at twenty-one, Anson commanded his own ship at twenty- seven. After his epic circumnavigation of the world, the Navy promoted Anson to rear admiral. His heroic feats led to a stream of decorations. In 1747, Anson defeated the French fleet off Cape Finisterre. The Navy elevated Anson to vice-admiral and the King raised him to the peerage. It seemed no adverse circumstance could shake his rational calm. One year later Anson achieved full admiral and became a First Lord of the Admiralty. Incongruously, he then disappointed everyone. In 1761, only a year before his death, he ascended to the highest rank, Admiral of the Fleet. In this year, he conveyed the seventeen-year- old bride of George III ̧ Sophia Charlotte, Princess of Mecklenburg- Strelitz, in the Royal yacht Charlotte from Harwich to Cuxhaven, Germany. Anson died soon afterwards, in 1762. Anson ’ s booty made him one of the richest navy men of the era. In 1743, he received the fabulous sum of £500,000 as his share of the treasure of the Nuestra Se ñ ora de Covadonga . In 1747, he received £300,000, from the capture of one of the transports that La Jonqui è re forfeited after Anson ’ s Cape Finisterre victory. With his fortune, Anson created a magnificent seventeenth century house and garden at Shugborough Hall, in rural Staffordshire.

His Victorian rose garden still has a beautiful collection of rambling roses and bush roses. The most unusual antiquity of all is the Shepherd's Monument. It takes its name from a marble relief based on a painting by Nicholas Poussin Les Bergers d'Arcadie II (also known as Et in Arcadia Ego ) carved by the Dutch artist, Scheemakers. He sculpted this painting in mirror-reverse, typical of a bas-relief made from an engraving of the original painting kept in the Louvre. Reversed back from a mirror image to normal font, the inscription Et in Arcadia Ego is normal forward text. Poussin ’ s painting Les Bergers d'Arcadie II was very important to the Ansons. In 1751, Thomas Hudson painted Lady Anson holding a partly rolled copy of an earlier Poussin painting on the same theme known as Les Bergers d'Arcadie I. The Duke of Devonshire owned the original Les Bergers d'Arcadie I at the time. He lived at Chatsworth, quite close to Shugborough. In 1967, an anonymous seller sold Hudson ’ s portrait of Lady Anson at Sotheby ’ s to an equally anonymous buyer. Today, Chatsworth ’ s Chapel proudly displays Bartolome Esteban Murillo ’ s 1660 painting of the Holy Family adjacent to Nicolas Poussin ’ s Les Bergers d'Arcadie I . The Holy Family warrants comment because it shows Mary in a red dress. This is traditionally the symbol for a woman who is no longer a virgin and Murillo is probably denying the virgin birth. Artists usually depict Mary Magdalene in a red dress. The famous Parchment 2 found by Abb é Berenger Sauniere at Rennes le Ch â teau tells of the supper in Bethany at which the recently raised Lazarus sat at the table with Jesus. It was at this meal that Mary Magdalene anointed Jesus ’ feet with her hair. Abb é Sauniere ’ s parchment contained a coded message that included the words Poussin Teniers hold the key. Sauniere went to great lengths to obtain copies from the Louvre of Les Bergers d'Arcadie II by Poussin and St Antony and St Paul by David Teniers. These were the same paintings held at or near Shugborough one hundred and thirty years before Abb é Sauniere ’ s 1886 exploits. David Teniers ’ St Antony and St Paul shows the Holy Dove flying down with the host in its mouth. It is a painting of what the hermit told Parsifal on his quest for the Grail: 1422 Its holiest power and its greatest, they shall be renewed today.

His servants He feeds for ever, the Grail their needs and care. The marble relief of Poussin ’ s Les Bergers d'Arcadie II in the gardens of Shugborough has some unusual features. Scheemakers adjusted the hand of the first shepherd so that his finger still pointed to the word Arca in the inscription Et in Arcadia Ego . Furthermore, Scheemakers placed a smaller sarcophagus on top of original tomb or plinth. This new Arca , which is an ossuary or bone container, is ogee sided with an Egyptian pyramid for its lid. Scheemakers also introduced a jolly vegetation god under the foot of the shepherd standing next to the goddess. In the original Les Bergers d'Arcadie II , this shepherd merely rests his foot on a rock. This barely perceptible element of Scheemakers tableau would have been highly risqu é for the period because the vegetation god is looking forward to receiving blood from the sacred marriage of one shepherd with the goddess that results in an age-old sacrifice. In fact, the vegetation god is trying to hurry the goddess to consummation by showing her a very earthy erection. Urged on, the goddess has begun her encounter by placing her arm on the shoulder of a shepherd symbolizing that he is the chosen one for rebirth. The shoulder has always been an important icon of selection. In Greek myth, the sacrificial king Tantalus set a shoulder before Demeter at a banquet of the gods. 1423 Even in Jerusalem, the shoulder was the priestly perquisite. 1424 Further over to the right is a five-petal dog rose of the goddess that suggests encounters past. Most incongruous of all are two simultaneous images of Lord Anson ’ s dogs, one holding out his paw.

Les Bergers d'Arcadie II shows a goddess with voluminous robes because she is Demeter or Hecate. This goddess of truth in death , held a sickle beneath her garments ready to dispatch the sacrificial king, or a surrogate representing the dark side of his nature, after he had consummated the sacred marriage. Originally, the spilled blood of the sacrificial king fertilized the land for the next year of crops. Much later, it became a personal ritual of renewal where only the hypothetical base nature died. The earliest Arcadia painting that uses Virgil ’ s Et in Arcadia Ego theme is by Il Guercino of Bologna. Il Guercino painted The Arcadian Shepherds for Cardinal Francesco Barberini in 1618. It shows the smooth skinned Cain in contemplation about the death of his rough skinned brother, Abel. 1425 Abel is the hairy, base side of Cain ’ s nature. The vegetation god in Les Bergers d'Arcadie II is the same as the ground god mentioned in Genesis 4:18 as opening its mouth to receive Abel ’ s blood from the hands of Cain. Il Guercino included a watching owl, the bird of death, to imply both the passing of time and wisdom in the events of the night. In Les Bergers d'Arcadie I Poussin transformed the owl into Pan, the universal god , who pours water to show the passing of time. In Les Bergers d'Arcadie II Poussin further transforms Pan to a shepherd-god. This new shepherd has no need of sandals like the mortal- shepherds who will shortly be involved in the drama. The drama that will ensue has always been associated with initiation and renewal under the auspices of the goddess. Another Et in Arcadia Ego painting in Frederick the Great ’ s Sans Souci palace in Potsdam shows only one shepherd with a group of goddesses. The three goddesses represent the goddess triplet of marriage, birth and death. While these various esoteric layers in Poussin ’ s painting are important in their own right, we turn to another level of meaning represented by the additional ossuary and the perplexing letters engraved below the bas-relief. These letters are D.O.U.O.S.V.A.V.V.M. The beginning D and the last M are set on a lower line to the rest of the letters. Until now, these letters have remained undeciphered.

Genesis 50:25 had the sequence in reverse order: visitabit vos asportate vobiscum . How very appropriate. This is the most important part of the very last chapter in Genesis, which deals with the Death of Joseph in Egypt . It expresses Joseph ’ s request that his expatriate compatriots in Egypt hide his bones safely outside Egypt. 1426 There is more in Genesis 50:25 than just the sequence of the four starting-letters. The initial D precedes these as Deus , or God. Then another two letters follow, the letters O and M from ossa mea , meaning my bones . Altogether, seven of the ten letters needed are present. Genesis 50:25 reads: Deus visitabit vos asportate vobiscum ossa mea de loco isto which translates to: God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place.

Similarly, Joseph swore to his father Jacob that he would to remove Jacob ’ s remains from Egypt: 1427 Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years, and the years of his life were one hundred and forty seven. When the time drew near for Israel to die, he called for his son Joseph and said to him, “ If I have found favour in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise that you will show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt, but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt, and bury me where they are buried. “ I will do as you say ” he said. “ Swear to me ” he said. Then Joseph swore to him, and Israel worshipped as he leaned on the top of his staff. In many instances of biblical prophecy, it seems the priests recorded prophecy well after the successful completion of the prophesized act. It is intriguing to contemplate whether this may be the case with the removal from Egypt of the remains of Jacob and Joseph. That is, their compatriots removed their bones to Hebron or Jerusalem. In Hebrew, Hebron is the word Khev ’ run. Kever in Hebrew and Khab ’ ru in Sanskrit both mean tomb ."},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":" 373 Remember, it was Caleb who said: 1428 I conveyed the Divine Spirit through the water of Jordan to the level of the vale of Hebron. Now we can ask, does the Shugborough Monument refer to taking the patriachs ’ bones or mummies to Hebron, and later Jerusalem? The artist Nicholas Poussin included Mount Cardou in Les Bergers d'Arcadie II. Various authors have attributed something very special to this mountain. Its intrigue involves both the mystery of Rennes le Ch â teau and the secret treasure of the Knights Templar. It was to Mt Cardou, near Rennes le Ch â teau, that the resourceful St Bernard sent his knights with their precious charge. This is where they ultimately hid their amazing Israelite cargo. Bertrand de Blanchefort was the fourth Grand Master of the Knights Templar from 1153CE to 1170CE. He was perhaps the most significant Grand Master, transforming that organization into a well- disciplined and powerful political institution. Bertrand involved the Knights Templars deeply in European politics of the day. Bertrand de Blanchefort granted the Knights Templar his lands around Rennes le Ch â teau and Castle Blanchefort. The Knights Templar immediately built in the area and the village of Rennes le Ch â teau evolved as their regional headquarters. Somewhat incongruous as the center of Christendom, the town ’ s coat of arms is a Star of David. Mount Cardou ’ s gold had been depleted by Roman armies many years before Bertrand de Blanchefort ’ s German speaking miners arrived. Yet they apparently dug for a considerable period. Was this for gold or did they hollow out a cache of burial chapels in the mountain? Intriguingly, the miners may have carved the face of a reclining or buried man on the side of Mount Cardou. 1429 Genesis 50 deals with the death of Joseph and the dispatch of his bones to rest with his ancestors in Jerusalem. So perhaps the Knights Templar found Joseph ’ s Egyptian mummy under the Temple in Jerusalem. This explanation is consistent with Shugborough ’ s inscription and the additional ossuary with its Egyptian pyramid top. An exact correspondence between seven of the ten enigmatic letters and Genesis 50:25 was a good start. Furthermore, the Biblical verse is a prophecy. Anybody that found the bones would describe the discovery as past sense. If the Knights Templar found the bones, they would describe removal of the bones from a threatened Jerusalem to Mount Cardou: 1430 "},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":" 374 The work has been accomplished with our help. And the knights have been sent ... where all precautions can be taken against all interference by public or ecclesiastical authority; where at this time one can best make sure of a secret, a watch, a hiding place. The challenge remained to identify the remaining three letters S.U.O. The computer could not locate this sequence in biblical verse. A list of archaic Latin words provided an unexpected answer. U stood for upilio , the archaic word for shepherd , the theme of the Shepherds ’ Monument. While it is possible that the letter S could stand for sunt or they are as in my bones they are dispersed , this necessitates a new phrase with accompanying verb. It is more likely the letter S represents the adjective sancta , meaning holy or sacred . With these substitutions the words sancta ossa upilio mean the shepherd ’ s holy bones . This provides an elegant solution to most of the problem: Deus visitabit vos asportate vobiscum sancta ossa upilio o ... m ... meaning: God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry away the shepherd ’ s holy bones o ... m ... The letters O.M. remained a hurdle. In the middle of the biblical verse, these letters stood for ossa mea . However, the hypothetical solution no longer needed my bones . The bones being were those of Joseph and perhaps his father Jacob, not my bones but their bones . Earlier chapters showed that Jacob, or more correctly Iakeb Aarhu (Jacob on the Ladder) Mer User Ra , was a Hyksos Shepherd king that reigned immediately before Aa Pehti Set . Many inscriptions on scarabs attest to him. Ramses II dated the commencement of the reign of this king Aa Pehti Set . He erected a stele in 1240BCE to commemorate the four hundredth anniversary of his dynasty commencing with Aa Pehti Set . If their bones were those of Jacob and Joseph, the Knights Templar indeed carried shepherd ’ s holy bones away from Jerusalem, the holy bones of a Hyksos Shepherd king and his son. It is quite consistent with our chronology that the Semitic contingent of Hyksos may have carried these bones to Jerusalem during the period of Hyksos rule in Egypt. The troublesome word beginning with letter M could not be a word in the middle of the sentence, as it had been in the biblical verse. The physical layout of the inscription shows it should be an end word. A"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":" 375 small depression following each letter confirms the forward direction of the sentence. The position of the letter M as an end word is also likely because tracing the inscription yields a St Andrew ’ s cross. As we have seen, this was a very important symbol in Lord Anson ’ s day. A St Andrew ’ s cross is the symbol used in old initiation and sacrificial rites to represent resurrection. It is a symbol of Archangel Michael and the lineage of Melchizedek Priests. Within the Roman Catholic Church, it is the Signaculum Dei or Seal of God . The St Andrews cross is achieved on the inscription by following the rising diagonal line from D on the lower left to the first V on the top right, then running right to left across the main row of letters. Finally, a downward diagonal from the top left O to the bottom right M completes the cross. The symmetry implicit in a St Andrews cross would have been important to Lord Anson. He established a fine garden of dog roses, the symbol of resurrection of the men of the Plain of Sharon. Following the small depressions and the St Andrews cross places the letter M as the first letter of the last word. The preceding word begins with O. The right words came once more from the archaic Latin word list: occulto maneo , which translates as to remain concealed . At last the whole sequence of letters was in place: Deus visitabit vos asportate vobiscum sancta ossa upilio occulto maneo which means: God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry away the shepherd ’ s holy bones to remain concealed. Now Lord Anson ’ s mysterious letters at Shugborough have a solution. The inscription implies that Lord Anson knew the Knights Templar found Joseph ’ s mummy under the Temple in Jerusalem. They removed it to a shrine in Mount Cardou. Poussin showed it in his famous painting Les Bergers d'Arcadie II . The shrine may still be there. Possibly the bones or mummy of Jacob is there as well. The famous rose line of France supports for this solution. On the official maps of the day, the rose line passed through Mount Cardou and the unusual meridienne of Paris ’ St Sulpice. Meridiennes are brass plaques and strips in a church. A ray of sunlight highlights the meridienne at noon and is used calibrate the village clock."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":" 376 St Sulpice ’ s meridienne is special for three reasons. Firstly, the eminent English astronomer, Henry Sully (1680-1728), installed it in 1727. Henry, who lies in St Sulpice, spent most of his life on the Continent. From 1718 he worked under the protection of the Philippe II, Duc d'Orl é ans (1674-1723). Philippe came to power in 1715 as R é gent de France, because Louis XV was in his minority. Henry Sully played a major role in solving the problem of longitude. Historians regard his 1724 timepiece C as one of the twelve most important marine timekeepers in the quest for longitude. It pre- dated John Harrison ’ s first attempt by 11 years. Secondly, the St Sulpice meridienne is important because French astronomers adjusted it in 1744, about the same time Lord Anson was beginning Shugborough Hall. Finally, the church of St Sulpice received exceptional artistic endowments in the century following the installation of its meridienne. The Abbey of St Germain des Pres established St Sulpice as a peasant church. In 1732, the authorities decided to remodel it and advertised an architectural design contest. Florentine architect Servandoni won the contest with a proposal to change the Graeco-Roman fa ç ade to fine Antique style. Although Servandoni ’ s designs were adopted, they were extensively modified by Maclaurin and then by Chalgrin. Twenty artists worked on the interior murals and the genius of Bouchardon, Pigalle and Delacroix excelled their work. The Eug è ne Delacroix Romantic murals from 1849 to 1861 astound us. As with Henry Sully, Delacroix was supported by a Duc d'Orl é ans, Louis Philippe (1773-1850). The French crowned him king after the 1830 July Revolution. On the vaulting of the first chapel on the right, Delacroix painted St Michael killing the dragon. St Michael is the patron saint of Israel and England. On the right wall, Delacroix painted angels driving Heliodorus, the King of Syria ’ s minister, from the Temple. The angels struck him down for coveting the Temple ’ s treasures. One of the angels is on horseback, like a Knight Templar. On the left wall, Delacroix painted Jacob struggling with the Angel of God. Both the Bourbon and its cadet d'Orl é ans dynasties were closely associated with Knights Templar succession. Philippe II, Duc d'Orl é ans (1674-1723) signed the famous Larmenius Charter of Transmission in 1705 as Grand Master. 1431 Louis Bourbon of Maine succeeded him in 1724, followed by Louis de Bourbon-Cond é in 1737 and Louis Fran ç ois Bourbon-Conty in 1741."},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":" 377 Louis de Bourbon-Cond é was also Grand Master of French Freemasonry. He was succeeded as Grand Master of French Freemasonry by Louis Philippe-Joseph d ’ Orleans (1747-1793), father of the Louis Philippe who supported Delacroix. The Valois King, Philip VI originally created the Orl é ans cadet branch of the Valois family for his son Philippe in 1344. However, Louis XIV ’ s brother, Philippe I (1640-1701), Duc d ’ Orl é ans founded the house of Orl é ans , which is the collateral branch of the Bourbons. The original Latin name of Aurelianensis highlights that Or in Orl é ans means gold. Members of the French royal family frequently used the name Aurelianensis. Its esoteric meaning is Prince of the Sanctuary , similar to the fabled Ambrosius Aurelianus of England. St Sulpice benefited from one hundred years of sponsorship by the Princes of the Sanctuary, the Dukes of Orl é ans, Bourbon-Cond é , Knights Templar Grand Masters and French Freemasonry Grand Masters. Out of this, Henry Sully and Eug è ne Delacroix delivered us an extremely impressive church with magnificent images of Jacob, the defense of the Temple treasure and the patron saint protector St Michael fighting the internal enemy - directly attached to Mount Cardou by the rose line ! In the next chapter, we look at the stories of the Holy Grail, in particular the Didcot Perceval manuscript of about 1200CE, which is now in the French National Library. The anonymous author claims it is the story of a monk called Blayse, the most authentic source of all the Grail stories. 1432 In this story, Merlin asks Perceval the big question: What is it that the Grail has served and what is it it serves ?"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":" 378 Chapter 22 The Holy Grail The Didcot Perceval is one of the most authentic romances of the Holy Grail. Its name originates from an early owner of the manuscript called Didcot. In the romance, Perceval ’ s famous make or break question is: What is it that the Grail has served and what is it it serves? Chapter 19 showed the question-name What is it? stands for the Philosophers ’ Stone, sacred manna or dew. Perceval's unusual question makes little sense without one of these substitutions. The question then becomes a strong statement of the Grail's existence. It has supplied manna throughout history and still does: Manna that the Grail has served and Manna it serves. Wolfram von Eschenbach ’ s Grail romance Parsifal written in 1220CE identifies the Knights Templar as the protectors of the Holy Grail and the Grail family. In Wolfram's romance, the Grail is a stone left on earth by a host of angles. The Grail's wondrous properties include the capacity to heal and rejuvenate. 1433 After their Jerusalem discoveries, the Cistercians and Knights Templar searched everywhere for more information. The Abbot of C î teaux, Etienne Harding, was an Englishman credited with formulating the instrumental Charter of Charity of the Cistercian order. He and St Bernard committed the whole resources of the C î teaux to studying their newly discovered texts. 1434 To assist their work they engaged rabbis from High Burgundy in return for political protection. It is probably from this circumstance that the Kabalistic Rabbis conceived the final books of the Zohar. In their search, the Knights Templar also discovered Sufi chivalric Holy Grail imagery with its associated Order of Knights and lineage of custodianship . This existed long before medieval times. The Sufi Master Sohrawardi the Martyr was central in preserving the endangered culture. Medieval troubadours of the day presented these Sufi images and stories of the Holy Grail to a thrilled Europe. With the aid of UNESCO funding, Henry Corbin researched Sohrawardi's approach to the Holy Grail. 1435 The Holy Grail around which Iranian Knights assembled was the Zoroastrian xvarnah or light of glory . It is identical to the oriflamme , golden flame or flaming gold . The"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":" 379 light of this flame enabled the Knights to behold Isr â q î y û m, which was the source of the knowledge of the Orientals . The Knights Templar also placed a round table with a flame in the centre of their church. 1436 Their octagonal church was the traditional church of the god Q're , the Sumerian KUR and the Moon God Sin . The oriflamme in the center would have cast eerily magnified shadows of the knights on the inner wall of the Church or Temple providing a deeply moving ambience. The Church demolished these octagonal churches to erase the practices of the Knights Templar and their seemingly occult philosophies. Temple, at London ’ s Law Court, is a rare example of a Knights Templar church. In Chapter 5, we saw that the Arthurian legends have deep roots in Iranian speaking tribe of Sarmatian Alans called the Kalybs. In the Romances of the Holy Grail, Perceval or Parsifal is the same character as the Iranian Knight Kay Khosraw . Indeed, Kay Khosraw ’ s legendary characteristics are the same as those of Cei in the Celtic Mabinogin, Kay in Norman stories and Lancelot. Sinai Mysticism of Mount Q â f and Salvat Hill and the hermetic emerald stone directly integrate Sufi stories and the Holy Grail. The pursuit of the Holy Grail by Perceval or Kay Khosraw has more dimensions than solely an alchemical pursuit of the Philosophers' Stone. As we saw in Chapter 20, the use of the Stone demands a pure heart. We recall that Samuel Baruch said: That quintessence is a holy balsam and also a poison. This is all medicine, and without the help of God it is without fruit, it kills and destroys. We turn now to Wolfram ’ s story to understand the importance of a pure heart. There was a small introduction to manna and the Grail in the last chapter, in reference to David Teniers ’ s painting of St Antony and St Paul at Shugborough Hall. Wolfram says he heard his Holy Grail story from Guiot de Provins a vile and filthy monk in the Holy Land who supposedly belonged to many Christian and Muslim orders. 1437 Guiot is sometimes written as Guyot or Kyot. Guiot told Wolfram of a heathen named Flegetanis who worshiped a golden calf and was the original author of the Grail stories. Flegetanis is Persian for familiar with the stars . Flegetanis says that, with his own eyes, he saw the Grail and other hidden mysteries in the"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":" 380 constellations. This is exactly reminiscent of the visions of the Sufi, Ruzbehan of Shiraz. Flegetanis is supposedly descended from Solomon, begotten of Israelite kin from ancient times and to have lived one thousand two hundred years before Christ. Identifying Flegetanis as worshipping a golden calf is meant to suggest that he was with Moses in the Exodus at the time the golden calf Atabyrius was calcinated by Moses and drunk by the Israelites. In all likelihood the Sabian School of Thabit ben Qorah was really the character Flegetanis . This School played a pivotal role in keeping alive the Iranian traditions of the Holy Grail. This school was still active in Baghdad at the end of the ninth century and translated the texts of Hermes Trismegistus from Greek into Arabic. 1438 Much of the Grail quest is about achieving purity of heart and understanding the true nature of pure charitable love. Wolfram sees the Quest as one where the individual struggles toward a sense of wholeness. 1439 The Grail expresses the source of this wholeness. In his prologue, Wolfram says that every act has Good and Evil results . He says its best to err on the side of good so the natural and spontaneous man will always choose the Good . This maxim elegantly delineates Zoroastrianism. Parsifal ’ s important question in Wolfram's romance is different to Perceval's question What is it? in the Didcot Perceval. Parsifal ’ s question instead reflects the alternate theme of purity and true love through empathy with another's pain: What ailes thee uncle? It conceals the main theme of the Philosophers' Stone with an admirable and intricately related alternative of love and charity. Wolfram ’ s prologue also alludes to the reason for the difference between these two interpretations. He says that he obtained the true story from Mazadan who had the exact record of his family. That record is the Sufi tradition of Sohrawardi and Mazadan is most likely the Zoroastrian God Ahura Mazda. Wolfram ’ s story is about the achievement of Perfect Nature by an individual. We see this with Gawain and Parsifal who are twin aspects of the same individual. Gawain is the perfect knight who represents the peak of worldly chivalry. Parsifal is the perfect knight within the transcendental realm of the Fellowship of the Grail ."},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":" 381 Chapter 16 investigated the importance of the color green in Sufi's philosophy. Green light is the philosopher ’ s angel . 1440 Underpinning this is the Sufi belief that there is an angel or heavenly partner for each of us called Perfect Nature and this angel performs the function for us of a heavenly witness . It is the same in Christian theology. God assigns a guardian angel to each person at birth. 1441 This angel ministers divine guidance by bringing God's love and wisdom. The angel guards against the powers of darkness and bears the individuals prayers to God. In Sufism, a substance sees and knows only its like. We are our own Perfect Nature . The Zoroastrian explanation of Perfect Nature makes the heavenly and worldly aspects of the same being quite clear. 1442 Our Favareti and our Daena make up our Perfect Nature . Together, they represent the flame of our being, the Xvarnah . X-File enthusiasts might see that Dana Scully is Fox Mulder ’ s protective angel. Each being has his Favareti in the heavenly world that assumes the role of a guardian angel, the angel that chooses one ’ s faith. The Daena exists within one ’ s physical being. She represents the visionary organ of the soul and the light that makes seeing possible. Those who have the eyes to see can see this light. She is the essential individuality and the celestially transcendent self. Kundalini yoga visualizes the Daena as a tongue of flame above the head. It is the final liberation of the spirit through the sun-door in the dome of the skull. 1443 The two lights of Favareti and Daena are in addition to the sun. Robert Fludd, a Rosicrucian writing in the seventeenth century, explains that the fire of the philosophers had three parts: A visible fire which is the source of physical light and heat; An invisible or astral fire which enlightens and warms the soul; A spiritual or divine fire which in the universe is known as God and in man as the spirit. They are the same three rails of the tri-railed papal Cross-of- Salem that we considered in Chapter 17. The vertical axis is Light . The top and middle rails are one ’ s Favareti and Daena , which together represent the flame of our being, the Xvarnah . The bottom rail is the worldly or physical self. The supreme Arcanum or Arcanum arcanorum of Sufism is the celestial pole and the Most High is the God of the Polestar. 1444 He sits at the North Pole of the Heavens, which is the highest celestial spot of the Cosmos. His floor is made of meteoric iron. 1445 The floor is rectangular"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":" 382 and each corner rests on a pillar. Many Freemasons will recognize the floor of the gods as the tessalated pavement of their lodge. All arks, chests, tholi domes and rounded hats, especially conical Phrygian caps with the top turned forward or caps like Mercury ’ s winged cap, are emblems of his celestial vault. The Sufi's object of search is divine light from the North celestial pole. Palaces there are ablaze with immaterial matter . This blazing light emanates out of the other good beings that have died and ascended to the mansions of light. The seeker is a particle of this same light. He finds himself drawn to this celestial pole at the Corona Borealis. As we saw in Chapter 17, an initiate must pass through the luminous darkness that surrounds the Pole to achieve a reunion with his own dimension of light. Then he must look vertically upwards from the terrestrial toward the celestial pole. The stairway to heaven is a Jacob ’ s ladder. It leads to the constellation of the Bear, Ursus Major. This same stairway to heaven existed in Dilmun for the Sumerians and Pharaohs of Egypt. In the first Chapter, we saw that modern science stumbled onto the fabled Philosophers' Stone that had evaded the alchemists for thousands of years. There is of course a considerable amount of disquiet about this discovery for the reasons Samuel Baruch described in Chapter 20: This is the great secret of the fathers, this is what God gave them as a consolation, which they used when they were in plight and trouble; otherwise they did not use it, because they were satisfied with the Highest, and with little. This was the masterpiece of the wise masters with which they prepared everything necessary that belonged to the Temple. "},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":" 383 Conclusion The goal of this book has been to bring the mysteries to life by tracing the provenance of a single tangible element common to all Mysteries from time immemorial, which is the Philosophers ’ Stone. It has many forms in different eras, from the ancient alchemy of the Anatolian Indo-Hittites, Mesopotamians and Egyptians, to the new sciences of sacred chemistry. It has taken us from Pyramid texts to Ovid, Shakespeare, Star Wars, Superman and Madonna. The closely associated story of St George and the Dragon, which represents the Rite of Righteous, has never varied. Old Kingdom Pharaohs and priests knew of the Philosophers' Stone in Egypt from at least the time of Imhotep around 2800BCE. The Israelites learnt of it in Egypt when they took part in the Hyksos invasion following provocation by the Pharaoh Ses ô stris I. A nationalist revolt by Ahmose and his brother Kamose expelled the Hyksos in 1567BCE. The Israelite contingent did not return to Anatolia but congregated in Palestine and made the ancient sanctuary of Kadesh, previously known as Salem, into their city of Jerusalem. An expeditionary force of Tuthmose III captured Jerusalem in 1480BCE. The Pharaoh recovered its treasures and artisans to Egypt. This was quite probably the enslavement of the Israelites. Ramses II shows us that Tuthmose III's Jerusalem campaign and his own campaign to Kadesh on the Orontes River became the primary symbolic act of a Pharaoh's goodness. Through suppression of the Hyksos peoples, the Pharaoh reaffirmed the stability of Egypt and his own identification with Amun. Nearly two thousand five hundred years after Tuthmose III, a group of French knights, who were later to become the Knights Templar, excavated under the temple in Jerusalem and found caches the Romans had not discovered. 1446 They found Salem hidden records, wealth and technology. Perhaps they also found the mummies of Jacob and Joseph. Salem ’ s technology included the secret double pelican with two interlocking cucurbits for producing the sacramental Philosophers' Stone. It was called the Ancient of Days . The Cistercians owned the secret for a time and created the Knights Templar as guardians of the physical evidence. Stories of the important find leaked out to the public as Iranian Sufi inspired romances"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":" 384 of the Holy Grail. Both the Cistercians and the Knights Templar became immensely wealthy in just a few years thanks to privileges and donations from nobles all over Europe eager to become involved. The Knights Templar developed into a multinational agricultural, transport, banking and security group. Eventually these trustees of the secret seemed to loose touch with their legal beneficiary, the Roman Catholic Church. The inherent flaw in the Knights Templar was the Melchizedekian heresy they harbored, which the Roman Catholic Church had been desperate to eliminate for almost a millennium. This seems to have included a rejection of Church mysteries in favor of a direct experience of the ancient mysteries. As priests of the Order of Melchizedek, they believed themselves to be immortal through rebirth. Ancient myths also present Pan as Saturn, the one first king and universal god. Approaching the door of Saturn, the Melchizedek priests of the Knights Templar may have experimented with arcane sexual practices as part of the Assassin ’ s practice of the Greater Mysteries. These might have been acceptable in Persia or India, but not in Europe. After the rapid and violent suppression of the Order, its Iranian chivalric Mysteries and Melchizedek aspirations blended into Scottish Freemasonry. Rosicrucian traditions from Egypt and Harran fortified the mysteries. Freemasonry experienced a duality. From the perspective of Heliopolian cosmology, Rosicrucianism prided itself as the mind of God or Ra. Craft Freemasonry was the torso of God or Ptah. The Israelites appear to have refined gold from salts at the time of Solomon, yet none of the Jewish alchemists, Cistercians, Knights Templar or Rosicrucians since this time seems to have made the Philosophers' Stone in any significant quantity. The Rosicrucians and their Indo-Hittite forbears have successfully kept a low profile for at least five thousand years, yet the awareness of this secret substance and the role of the Rosicrucians is widespread. Notwithstanding an abundance of evidence to the contrary, the peculiar Jewish position continues to be that there has been no Jewish involvement in alchemy. 1447 Along the way, great scientists such as Sir Isaac Newton and Paracelsus worked covertly to achieve alchemical success. The world is much indebted to the alchemists who furthered the sciences of metallurgy, chemistry and pharmaceuticals. Today we understand chemistry and metallurgy to a more advanced degree. Respectable scientists fashionably ridicule the chemistry of the medieval alchemists. They regard the"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":" 385 alchemists ’ experiments of trial, error and danger as misguided and even pathetically laughable. However, the Ouroborus has now come full circle. Alchemy is itself the rose. While Pharaohs, kings and priests of ancient societies embraced it as their Kingly Secret , now the modern Philosophers' Stone has the potential to embrace our whole society. With enough perseverance and a good laboratory, any of us can make a small quantity of the Philosophers' Stone, be it by traditional wet alchemy, the high technology method of Whitegold, the simple method of King Solomon or the peroxide method of the mining industry. Yet, this book leaves us with at least one important and unavoidable question. All the evidence available to our archaeologists suggests that ancient civilizations did not possess advanced science. We must therefore ask how the ancients knew of such an important substance as the Philosophers' Stone. Concrete and Egyptian blue were rediscovered fifteen hundred years after they were lost. Why does the Philosophers' Stone remain a mystery?"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":" 386 Appendix 1 Preparing the Philosophers' Stone The Philosophers' Stone is prepared from metallic gold by the following process developed by David Hudson. The product is colloquially called \"Whitegold\" and technically known by the acronym G- ORME, which stands for the Orbitally Rearranged Metallic Element of Gold: 1448 1. 50-mg gold (99.99% pure) was dispersed in 200-ml Aqua Regia to provide clusters of gold atoms. 2. 60 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid was added to the dispersion and the mixture was brought to boil, and continued boiling until the volume was reduced to approximately 10-15 ml. 60 ml concentrated HCl were added, and the sample brought to boil and checked for evolution of NOCl fumes. The process was repeated until no further fumes evolved, thus indicating that the nitric acid had been removed and the gold had been converted completely to the gold chloride. 3. The volume of the dispersion was reduced by careful heating until the salt was just dry. \"Just dry\" as used herein means that all of the liquid had been boiled off, but the solid residue had not been \"baked\" or scorched. 4. The just dry salts were again dispersed in Aqua Regia and steps (2) and (3) were repeated. This treatment provides gold chloride clusters of greater than 11 atoms. 5. 150 ml 6M hydrochloric acid were added to the just dry salts and boiled again to evaporate off the liquid to just dry salts. This step was repeated four times. This procedure leads to a greater degree of sub- division to provide smaller clusters of gold chloride. At the end of this procedure an orangish-red salt of gold chloride is obtained. The salt will analyze as substantially pure Au2Cl6. 6. Sodium chloride is added in an amount whereby the sodium is present at the ratio of 20-mole sodium per mole of gold. The solution is then diluted with deionized water to a volume of 400 ml. The presence of the aqueous sodium chloride provides the salt Na 2 Au 2 Cl 8 . The presence of water is essential to break apart the diatoms of gold. 7. The aqueous sodium chloride solution is very gently boiled to a just dry salt, and thereafter the salts were taken up alternatively in 200 ml deionized water and 300 ml 6M hydrochloric acid until no further"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":" 387 change in color is evidenced. The 6M hydrochloric acid is used in the last treatment. 8. After the last treatment with 6M hydrochloric acid, and subsequent boil-down, the just dry salt is diluted with 400 ml deionized water to provide a monatomic gold salt solution of NaAuCl 2 'XH 2 O. The pH is approximately 1.0. 9. The pH is adjusted very slowly with dilute sodium hydroxide solution, while constantly stirring, until the pH of the solution remains constant at 7.0 for a period of more than twelve hours. This adjustment may take several days. Care must be taken not to exceed pH 7.0 during the neutralization. 10. After the pH is stabilized at pH 7.0, the solution is gently boiled down to 10 ml and 10 ml concentrated nitric acid is added to provide a sodium-gold nitrate. As is apparent, the nitrate is an oxidizer and removes the chloride. The product obtained should be white crystals. If a black or brown precipitate forms, this is an indication that there is still Na 2 Au 2 Cl 8 present. If present, it is then necessary to restart the process at step (1). If white crystals are obtained, the solution is boiled to obtain just dry crystals. It is important not to overheat, i.e. bake. 11. 5 ml concentrated nitric acid are added to the crystals and again boiled to where the solution goes to just dry. Again, it is essential not to overheat or bake. Steps (11) and (12) provide a complete conversion of the product to a sodium-gold nitrate. No chlorides are present. 10ml deionized water is added and again boiled to just dry salts. This step is repeated once. This step eliminates any excess nitric acid that may be present. The NaAu hydrolyzes with the water and dissociates to form HAu. The product will be a white precipitate in water. The Au atoms have water at the surface that creates a voluminous cotton-like product. 12. The white precipitate is decanted off from any dark grey solids and filtered through a 0.45-micron cellulose nitrate filter paper. Any dark grey solids of sodium auride should be redissolved and again processed starting at step (1). 13. The filtered white precipitate on the filter paper is vacuum dried at 120 ° C for two hours.

After cooling, the ignited white gold can be cleaned of remaining traces of sodium by digesting with dilute nitric acid for approximately one hour. 16. The insoluble white gold is filtered on 0.45-micron paper and vacuum dried at 120 ° C for two hours. The white powder product obtained from the filtration and drying is pure G-ORME. Notes for the Experimenter 1. The acids used in this Patent are highly corrosive and very dangerous. 2. Wear protective clothing, particularly rubber gloves and eye goggles. 3. Work outdoors and remain up-wind of all fumes. 4. Do not use any metal at all in the preparation. Instead, use glass or Teflon spoons and glass containers such as Corning Pyrex. 5. Use a gas burner for heat. Do not use an electric element, magnetic stirrer or nearby motors. 6. Step (1): dissolve the gold in the Aqua Regia. Once the gold is dissolved, the process can start right away. It is not a critical step. 7. Steps (2) to (5) convert Au 33 Cl 99 to Au 33 Cl 33 . Even though monotonous, repeat the boiling down and addition of acid about one hundred times. ‘ Just dry ’ is very difficult and time consuming. At any time, stop the process and resume later. Use gentle heat and when crystallization begins, reduce further. Gold clusters will recombine and shine in the beaker. When this happens, add more Aqua Regia and boil down with HCl. Repeat this at least eight times. Each time there should be less macro-clusters of gold settling out. To speed up the process, filter out the gold clusters and add them to the Aqua Regia for later attempts. Eventually, the solution changes from a red acid liquid to dark red-brown crystals of gold chloride, which produce a purple stain if splashed. 8. Steps (6) to (8): lead to the monotomic salt NaAuCl 2 .XH 2 O. Boil with water, crystallize, add dilute HCl, boil down. Repeat many times over. If Step 7 is successful, the solution eventually alternates between the grass Green Lion when concentrated HCl is applied and citrine yellow gold chloride when the acid is diluted. The final acid treatment produces the Green Lion if the metal-to-metal gold bonds have been adequately dissolved. The color will lighten from orange to lemon yellow and then pale yellow. Larger gold chloride clusters, which have not broken down, concentrate to a darker orange-red region at the bottom"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":" 389 of the yellow liquid. Completely drying the gold chloride solution and further heating it causes the 33 atom gold molecules to reform. This defeats the process and the experimenter needs to restart the process. When no more lightening occurs, decant the colored liquid from the white crystals and recycle it to the Aqua Regia bottle. Dissolve the remaining snow-white salt crystal mass in water and use a coffee filter paper to filter out any remaining gold clusters or large debris. Boil down to ensure there is no color change due to large clusters still forming. It is essential to achieve snow-white salt crystals at this stage or the pH adjustment, Step (9), will fail and Steps (2) to (5) restarted. 9. Step (9): pH adjustment requires patience. The initial adjustment must not be faster than 2 hours. If you change the pH too quickly, it will alter the reaction and revert to black, dark blue, brown or brick red. It is best to adjust slowly over 3 days with constant stirring. The pH moves a lot at first and then more slowly. Use a non-metallic stirrer. Except for spot checks, a pH meter is of limited use. The probe requires frequent rinsing and will eventually fail. Follow the directions in the patent: bring the solution gently to pH 7.0 and check that it stays there for 12 hours of stirring. 10. Step (10): is very dangerous. Adding nitric acid to remove the chlorides of the salt crystals produces thick, brown, noxious fumes. Work in the open, upwind and away from the fumes. 11. Step (14): It is essential the tube furnace heats to 800 degrees. Two gas tanks are required, one with argon and the other hydrogen. First heat the precipitate in the tube furnace in air, which produces brown oxide. Purge the tube with argon. Heat the product under argron. Slowly introduce hydrogen and turn off the argon. Allow to cool and slide the quartz boat back and forth, which turns the brown oxide to black hydride. This looks like iron filings. The hydrogen is removed to leave a white powder by repeated heating and cooling under argon: 15-20 minutes in, then out etc for a number of days. It can be turned-off at night and restarted the next morning. 12. Step (16): Filter out any black or grey solids with average filter paper. This may produce a clear liquid instead of the precipitate mentioned in the patent. Instead of using 0.45micron filter paper that clogs up immediately with precipitate, boiled down the precipitate to remove most of the water.

Monatomics in solution may go to a gas if not stabilized with salt in the solution."},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":" 391 Technical Description of the Process An Aqua Regia solution of metallic gold is prepared. This solution contains clusters of gold chlorides of random size and degrees of aggregation. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added to the solution. The acid is evaporated with a large excess of common salt (NaCl, 20:1 moles Na to moles Au) to moist salts. Addition of acid and evaporation is carried-out repeatedly. The addition of NaCl allows the eventual formation of NaAuCl 4 , after all HNO 3 is removed from the solution. The sodium, like gold, has only one unpaired ‘ s ’ electron and, accordingly, tends to form clusters of at least two atoms. The sodium, however, does not orbitally overlap the gold atom in the ‘ d ’ band, as it has no ‘ d ’ electrons, resulting in a surface reaction between the sodium atoms and the gold atoms. This results in a weakening of the gold-gold cluster stability and causes the eventual formation of a sodium-gold linear bond with a weakened d orbital activity in the individual gold atoms. The sodium-gold compound, formed by repeated evaporation to salts, will provide a chloride of sodium-gold. In these salts the sodium and gold are believed to be charged positive, i.e., have lost electrons: and the chlorine is negative, i.e., has gained electrons. When the salts are dissolved in water, the pH slowly adjusted to neutral, full aquation of the sodium-gold diatom will slowly occur and chloride is removed from the complex. Chemical reduction of the sodium-gold solution results in the formation of a sodium auride (NaAu). Continued aquation results in disassociation of the gold atom from the sodium and the eventual formation of a protonated auride of gold as a grey precipitate. Subsequent annealing produces the newly patented G-ORME. The above general description for the preparation of G-ORME from commercially available metallic gold is equally applicable to the preparation of ORMEs from the remaining Transition metals through reaction with nitric oxide (NO) gas. The Transition metals include platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, ruthenium, and osmium. Nitric oxide is unique in that it possesses the necessary chemical potential as well as the single unpaired electron."},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":" 392 Appendix 2 Roger Bacon ’ s Method Oleo Antimonii Tractatus & Tract De Oleo Stibii. 1449 ROGERII BACONIS ANGLI Summi Philosophi & Chemici. Stibium, as the Philosophers say, is composed from the noble mineral Sulphur, and they have praised it as the black lead of the Wise. The Arabs in their language, have called it Asinat vel Azinat, the alchemists retain the name Antimonium. It will however lead to the consideration of high Secrets, if we seek and recognize the nature in which the Sun is exalted, as the Magi found that this mineral was attributed by God to the Constellation Aries, which is the first heavenly sign in which the Sun takes its exaltation or elevation to itself. Although such things are thrown to the winds by common people, intelligent people ought to know and pay more attention to the fact that exactly at this point the infinitude of secrets may be partly contemplated with great profit and in part also explored. Many, but these are ignorant and unintelligent, are of the opinion that if they only had Stibium, they would get to it by Calcination, others by Sublimation, several by Reverberation and Extraction, and obtain its great Secret, Oil, and Perfectum Medicinam. But I tell you, that here in this place nothing will help, whether Calcination, Sublimation, Reverberation nor Extraction, so that subsequently a perfect Extraction of metallic virtue that translates the inferior into the superior, may profitably come to pass or be accomplished. For such shall be impossible for you. Do not let yourselves be confused by several of the philosophers who have written of such things, i.e. Geber, Albertus Magnus, Rhasis, Rupecilla, Aristoteles and many more of that kind. And this you should note. Yes, many say, that when one prepares Stibium to a glass, then the evil volatile Sulphur will be gone, and the Oil, which may be prepared from the glass, would be a very fixed oil, and would then truly give an ingress and Medicine of imperfect metals to perfection. These words and opinions are perhaps good and right, but that it should be thus in fact and prove itself, this will not be. For I say to you truly, without any hidden speech; if you were to lose some of the above mentioned Sulphur by the preparation and the burning, as a small fire may easily damage it, so that you have lost the right penetrating spirit, which should make our whole Antimonii corpus into a perfect red oil, so that it also can ascend over the helm with a sweet"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":" 393 smell and very beautiful colors and the whole body of this mineral with all its members, without loss of any weight, except for the foecum, shall be an oil and go over the helm. And note also this: How would it be possible for the body to go into an oil, or give off its sweet oil, if it is put into the last essence and degree? For glass is in all things the outermost and least essence. For you shall know that all creatures at the end of the world, or on the last and coming judgment of the last day, shall become glass or a lovely amethyst and this according to the families of the twelve Patriarchs, as in the families of jewels which Hermes the Great describes in his book: As we have elaborately reported and taught in our book de Kabbalah. You shall also know that you shall receive the perfect noble red oil, which serves for the translation of metals in vain, if you pour acetum correctum over the Antimonium and extract the redness. Yes not even by Reverberation, and even if its manifold Beautiful colors show themselves, this will not make any difference and is not the right way. You may indeed obtain and make an oil out of it, but it has no perfect force and virtue for transmutation or translation of the imperfect metals into perfection itself. This you must certainly know. AND NOW WE PROCEED TO THE MANUAL LABOUR, AND THUS THE PRACTICA FOLLOWS. Take in the Name of God and the Holy Trinity, fine and well cleansed Antimonii ore, which looks nice, white, pure and internally full of yellow rivulets or veins. It may also be full of red and blue colors and veins, which will be the best. Pound and grind to a fine powder and dissolve in a water or Aqua Regis, which will be described below, finely so that the water may conquer it. And note that you should take it out quite soon after the solution so that the water may conquer it. And note that you should take it out quite soon after the solution so that the water will have no time to damage it, since it quickly dissolves the Antimonii Tincture. For in its nature our water is like the ostrich, which by its heat digests and consumes all iron; for given time, the water would consume it and burn it to naught, so that it would only remain as an idle yellow earth, and then it would be quite spoilt. Consider by comparison Luna, beautiful clean and pure, dissolved in this our water. And let it remain therein for no more than a single night when the water is still strong and full of Spirit, And I tell you, that your good Luna has then been fundamentally consumed and destroyed and brought to naught in this our water."},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":" 394 And if you want to reduce it to a pure corpus again, then you will not succeed, but it will remain for you as a pale yellow earth, and occasionally it may run together in the shape of a horn or white horseshoe, which may not be brought to a corpus by any art. Therefore you must remember to take the Antimonium out as soon as possible after the Solution, and precipitate it and wash it after the custom of the alchemists, so that the matter with its perfect oil is not corroded and consumed by the water. THE WATER; WHEREIN WE DISSOLVE THE ANTIMONIUM, IS MADE THUS: Take Vitriol one and a half (alii 2. lb.) Sal armoniac one pound, Arinat (alii Alun) one half pound / Sal niter one and a half pound, Sal gemmae (alii Sal commune) one pound, Alumen crudum (alii Entali) one half pound. These are the species that belong to and should be taken for the Water to dissolve the Antimonium. Take these Species and mix them well among each other, and distil from this a water, at first rather slowly. For the Spiritus go with great force, more than in other strong waters. And beware of its spirits, for they are subtle and harmful in their penetration. When you now have the dissolved Antimony, clean and well sweetened, and its sharp waters washed out, so that you do not notice any sharpness any more, then put into a clean vial and overpour it with a good distilled vinegar. Then put the vial in Fimum Equinum, or Balneum Mariae, to putrefy forty (alii. four) days and nights, and it will dissolve and be extracted red as blood. Then take it out and examine how much remains to be dissolved, and decant the clear and pure, which will have a red color, very cautiously into a glass flask. Then pour fresh vinegar onto it, and put it into Digestion as before, so that that which may have remained with the faecibus, it should thus have ample time to become dissolved. Then the faeces may be discarded, for they are no longer useful, except for being scattered over the earth and thrown away. Afterwards pour all the solutions together into a glass retort, put into Balneum Mariae, and distil the sharp vinegar rather a fresh one, since the former would be too weak, and the matter will very quickly become dissolved by the vinegar. Distil it off again, so that the matter remains quite dry. Then take common distilled water and wash away all sharpness, which has remained with the matter from the vinegar, and then dry the matter in the sun, or otherwise by a gentle fire, so that it becomes well dried. It will then be fair to behold, and have a bright red color. The"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":" 395 Philosophers, when they have thus prepared our Antimonium in secret, have remarked how its outermost nature and power has collapsed into its interior, and its interior thrown out and has now become an oil that lies hidden in its innermost and depth, well prepared and ready. And henceforth it cannot, unto the last judgment, be brought back to its first essence. And this is true, for it has become so subtle and volatile, that as soon as it senses the power of fire, it flies away as a smoke with all its parts because of its volatility. Several poor and common Laborers, when they have prepared the Antimonium thus, have taken one part out, to take care of their expenses, so that they may more easily do the rest of the work and complete it, They then mixed it with one part Salmiac, one part Vitro (alii. Nitro, alii. Titro), one part Rebohat, to cleanse the Corpera, and then proceeded to project this mixture onto a pure Lunam. And if the Luna was one Mark, they found two and a half Loth good gold after separation; sometimes even more. And therewith they had accomplished a work providing for their expenses, so that they might even better expect to attain to the Great Work. And the foolish called this a bringing into the Lunam, but they are mistaken. For such gold is not brought in by the Spiritibus (alii. Speciebus), but any Luna contains two Mark gold to the Loth, some even more. But this gold is united to the Lunar nature to such a degree that it may not be separated from it, neither by Aquafort, nor by common Antimonium, as the goldsmiths know. When however the just mentioned mixture is thrown onto the Lunam in flux, then such a separation takes place that the Luna quite readily gives away her implanted gold either in Aquafort or in Regal, and lets herself separate from it, strikes it to the ground and precipitates it, which would or might otherwise not happen. Therefore it is not a bringing into the Lunam, but a bringing out of the Luna. But we are coming back to our Proposito and purpose of our work, for we wish to have the Oil, which has only been known and been acquainted with this magistry, and not by the foolish. When you then have the Antimonium well rubified according to the above given teaching, then you shall take a well rectified Spiritum vini, and pour it over the red powder of Antimony, put it in a gentle Balneum Mariae to dissolve for four days and nights, so that everything becomes well dissolved. If however something should remain behind, you overpour the same with fresh Spiritu vini, and put it into the Balneum Mariae again, as said before, and everything should become well"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":" 396 dissolved. And in case there are some more faeces there, but there should be very little, do them away, for they are not useful for anything. The Solutiones put into a glass retort, lute on a helm and connect it to a receiver, also well luted, to receive the Spiritus. Put it into Balneum Mariae. Thereafter you begin, in the Name of God, to distil very leisurely at a gentle heat, until all the Spiritus Vini has come over. You then pour the same Spiritum that you have drawn off, back onto the dry matter, and distil it over again as before. And this pouring on and distilling off again, you continue so often until you see the Spiritum vini ascend and go over the helm in all kinds of colors. Then it is time to follow up with a strong fire, and a noble blood red Oleum will ascend, go through the tube of the helm and drip into the recipient. Truly, this is the most secret way of the Wise to distil the very highly praised oil of Antimonii, and it is a noble, powerful, fragrant oil of great virtue, as you will hear below in the following. But here I wish to teach and instruct you who are poor and without means to expect the Great Work in another manner; not the way the ancients did it by separating the gold from the Luna. Therefore take this oil, one lot, eight lot of Saturn calcined according to art, and carefully imbibe the oil, drop by drop, while continuously stirring the calx Saturni. Then put it ten days and nights in the heat, in the furnace of secrets, and let the fire that this furnace contains, increase every other day by one degree. The first two days you give it the first degree of fire, the second two days you give it the second degree, and after four days and nights you put it into the third degree of fire and let it remain there for three days and nights. After these three days you open the window of the fourth degree, for which likewise three days and nights should be sufficient. Then take it out, and the top of the Saturnus becomes very beautiful and of a reddish yellow color. This should be melted with Venetian Boreas. When this has been done, you will find that the power of our oil has changed it to good gold. Thus you will again have subsistence, so that you may better expect the Great Work. We now come back to our purpose where we left it earlier. Above you have heard, and have been told to distil the Spiritum vini with the Oleum Antimonii over the helm into the recipient as well as the work of changing the Saturnum into gold. But now we wish to make haste and report about the second tinctural work. Here it will be necessary to separate the Spiritum vini from the oil again, and you shall know that it is done thus: Take the mixture of oil and wine spirit put it into a retort, put on a helm, connect a receiver and place it all together into the Balneum"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":" 397 Mariae. Then distil all the Spiritum vini from the oil, at a very gentle heat, until you are certain that no more Spiritus vini is to be found within this very precious oil. And this will be easy to check; for when you see several drops of Spiritu vini ascend over the helm and fall into the recipient, this is the sign that the Spiritus vini has become separated from the oil. Then remove the fire from the Balneo, though it was very small, so that it may cool all the sooner. Now remove the recipient containing the Spiritu vini, and keep it in a safe place, for it is full of Spiritus, which it has extracted from the oil and retained. It also contains admirable virtues, as you will hear hereafter. But in the Balneo you will find the blessed blood red Oleum Antimonii in the retort, which should be taken out very carefully. The helm must be very slowly removed, taking care to soften and wash off the Lute, so that no dirt falls down into the beautiful red oil and makes it turbid. This oil you must store with all possible precaution so that it receives no damage. For you now have a Heavenly Oil that shines on a dark night and emits light as from a glowing coal. And the reason for this is that its innermost power and soul has become thrown out unto the outermost, and the hidden soul is now revealed and shines through the pure body as a light through a lantern: Just as on Judgment Day our present invisible and internal souls will manifest through our clarified bodies, that in this life are impure and dark, but the soul will then be revealed and seen unto the outermost of the body, and will shine as the bright sun. Thus you now have two separate things: Both the Spirit of Wine full of force and wonder in the arts of the human body: And then the blessed red, noble, heavenly Oleum Antimonii, to translate all diseases of the imperfect metals to the Perfection of gold. And the power of the Spiritual Wine reaches very far and to great heights. For when it is rightly used according to the Art of Medicine: I tell you, you have a heavenly medicine to prevent and to cure all kinds of diseases and ailments of the human body. And its uses are thus, as follows: AGAINST PODAGRA or GOUT In the case of gout one should let three drops of this Spiritu vini, that has received the power of the Antimony, fall into a small glass of wine. This has to be taken by the patient on an empty stomach at the very moment in time when he sense the beginning or arrival of his trouble, bodily ailment and pain. On the next day and afterwards on the third day it should also be taken and used in the same way. On the first day it takes away all pain, however great it may be, and prevents swelling. On the"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":" 398 second day it causes a sweat that is very inconstant, viscous and thick, that smells and tastes quite sour and offensive, and occurs mostly where the joints and limbs are attached. On the third day, regardless of whether any medicine has been taken, a purging takes place of the veins into the bowels, without any inconvenience, pain or grief. And this demonstrates a great power of Nature. AGAINST LEPROSY To begin with the patient is given six drops on an empty stomach. And arrange it so that the unclean person is alone without the company of any healthy people, in a separate and convenient place. For his whole body will soon begin to smoke and steam with a stinking mist or vapour. And on the second day his skin will start to flake and much uncleanliness will detach itself from his body. He should then have three more drops of the medicine ready, which he should take and use in solitude on the fourth day. Then on the eighth or ninth day, by means of this medicine and through the bestowal of Divine mercy and blessing, he will be completely cleansed and his health restored. AGAINST APOPLEXIA OR STROKE In the case of stroke, let a drop of the unadmixed tincture fall onto the tongue of the person in need. At once it will raise itself and distribute itself like a mist or smoke, and rectify and dissolve the struck part. But if the stroke has hit the body or other members, he should be given three drops at the same time in a glass of good wine, as previously taught in the case of Podagra. AGAINST HYDROPE OR DROPSY In the case of dropsy give one drop each day for six days in a row, in Aqua Melissae or Valerianae. On the seventh day give three drops in good wine. Then it is enough. AGAINST EPILEPSIA, CATALEPSIA, & ANALEPSIA. In case of the falling sickness, give him two drops at the beginning of the Paroxismi in Aqua Salviae, and after three hours again two drops. This will suffice. But if further symptoms should occur, then give him two more drops as above. AGAINST HECTIC In case of consumption and dehydration, give him two drops in Aqua Violarum the first day. On the second day, give him two more drops in good wine. AGAINST FEVER"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":" 399 In cases of all kinds of hot fevers, give him three drops in a well distilled St. Johnswort water or Cichorii at the beginning of the Paroxismi. Early in the morning on the following day, again give him three drops in good wine on an empty stomach. AGAINST PEST In the case of pestilence give the patient seven drops in a good wine, and see to it that the infected person is all by himself, and caused to sweat. Then this poison will, with Divine assistance, do him no harm. FOR THE PROLONGATION AND MAINTENANCE OF A HEALTHY LIFE. Take and give at the beginning and entry of spring, when the sun has entered the sign of Aries, two drops; and at the beginning with God's help, be safe and protected against bad health and poisoned air, unless the incurred disease was predestined and fatally imposed upon man by the Almighty God. But we now wish to proceed to the Oleum Antimonii and its Power, and show how this oil may also help the diseased and imperfect metallic bodies. Take in the Name of God, very pure refined gold, as much as you want and think will suffice. Dissolve it in a rectified Wine, prepared the way one usually makes Aquam Vitae. And after the gold has become dissolved, let it digest for a month. Then put it into a Balneum, and distil off the spiritum vini very slowly and gently. Repeat this several times, as long and as often until you see that your gold remains behind in fundo as a sap.

Viz. that you instead of such prepared gold take one part Mercurii Solis, the preparation of which I have already taught in another place by its proper process.

Put it in a vial, well sealed, into a heat of the first degree of the oven of secrets, and let it remain there for ten days and nights. You will then see your powder and oil quite dry, such that it has become a single piece of dust of a blackish grey color. After ten days give it the second degree of heat, and the grey and black color will slowly change into a whiteness so that it becomes more or less white. And at the end of these ten days, the matter will take on a beautiful rose white. But this may be ignored. For this color is only due to the Mercurio Solis, that has swallowed up our blessed oil, and now covers it with the innermost part of its body. But by the power of the fire, our oil will again subdue such Mercurium Solis, and throw it into its innermost. And the oil with its very bright red color will rule over it and remain on the outside. Therefore it is time, when twenty years have passed, that you open the window of the third degree. The external white color and force will then completely recede inwardly, and the internal red color will, by the force of the fire, become external. Keep also this degree of fire for ten days, without increase or decrease. You will then see your powder, that was previously white, now become very red. But for the time being this redness may be ignored (is of no consequence), for it is still unfixed and volatile; and at the end of these ten days, when the thirtieth day has passed, you should open the last window of the fourth degree of fire, Let it stay in this degree for another ten days, and this very bright red powder will begin to melt. Let it stay in flux for these ten days. And when you take it out you will find on the bottom a very bright red and transparent stone, ruby colored, melted into the shape of the vial. This stone may be used for Projection, as has been taught in the tract on Vitriol. Praise God in Eternity for this His high revelation, and thank Him in Eternity. Amen. ON THE MULTIPLICATION LAPIDIS STIBII. The ancient sages, after they had discovered this stone and prepared it to perfect power and translation of the imperfect metals to gold, long sought to discover a way to increase the power and efficiency of this stone. And they found two ways to multiply it: One is a multiplication of its power, such that the stone may be brought much further in its power of Transmutation. And this multiplication is very subtle, the description of which may be found in the Tract on Gold. The second multiplication is an Augmentum quantitatis of the stone with its former power, in such a way that it neither loses any of its power, nor gains any, but in such a manner that its weight increases and keeps on"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":" 401 increasing ever more, so that a single ounce grows and increases to many ounces. To achieve this increase or Multiplication one has to proceed in the following manner: Take in the Name of God, your stone, and grind it to a subtle powder, and add as much Mercurii Solis as was taught before. Put these together into a round vial, seal with sigillo Hermetis, and put it into the former oven exactly as taught, except that the time has to be shorter and less now. For where you previously used ten (alii thirty) days, you may now not use more than four (alii ten) days. In other respects the work is exactly the same as before.

King Solomon's Method King Solomon ’ s people swept up the white material present when a lake dries. They did not dig because they only wanted the material on the surface. They fired this material with sulfur, put silver on top of it and mixed in iron. Using this method and a reverberatory furnace, they poured 100,000 talents of gold. Both damp evaporated salts and water from the Dead Sea produce a quantity of precipitate. Reconstituted Dead Sea salt water is far more concentrated, produces a much greater amount of precipitate and requires much more lye (dilute NaOH) to bring it up to the desired pH level. The procedure for extracting monatomic elements from dry material such as sweepings from salt and alkali flats, rock powders, etc. is as follows: 1. Grind the dry material to as fine a consistency as possible. 2. Add lye to cover the dry material with a thin layer and stir in distilled water sufficient to cover both by approximately 50mm. 3.

Titrate the liquid that passes through the coffee filters to a pH of 8.5 with hydrochloric acid while stirring. This causes m-state and Mg(OH)2 to precipitate. The titration must be slow with thorough mixing. If you go too far, the pH will abruptly shift and you will have to start over by adding lye quickly to bring the pH back up to 12 and return to Step (5) above. 7. To eliminate the Mg(OH)2, continue lowering the pH with acid to pH 5-6 to dissolve both the m-state precipitate and Mg(OH)2 precipitate. 8. Add lye to raise pH to 8.5-8.7.

The time was come for the cosmos to awake, and this was no-one ’ s task but His alone. “ We pray Thee, then ” , they said, “ direct Thy thoughts to things that now exist and to what things the future needs. ” 7. When they spake thus, God smiled and said: “ Nature arise! ” And from His word there came a marvel, feminine, possessed of perfect beauty, gazing at which the Gods stood all amazed. And God the forefather, with the name of Nature, honored her, and bade her be prolific. Then gazing fixedly on the surrounding space, He spake these words as well: “ Let Heaven be filled with all things full, and Air, and Æ ther, too! ” God spake and it was so. And Nature with herself communing knew she must not disregard the Sire ’ s command; so with the help of Toil she made a daughter fair, whom she did call Invention. And on her God bestowed the gift of being, and with his gift He set apart all them that had been so- far made, filled them with mysteries, and to Invention gave the power of ruling them. 8.

The unknown compiler had as his purpose a restoration of the ancient Mysteries based upon the hints and illusions contained in classical writings. Most of the great philosophers of antiquity were initiates of State Mysteries. In their writings, these men frequently allude to some fragment of the initiatory rites. These hints have been carefully organized, placed in sequential order, and connected with an editorial tissue. The result is a restoration founded on the actual words of the initiates themselves. The seven degrees of initiation described in the Crata Repoa equate to the last seven stages of the Great Work of Alchemy. There are twelve stages altogether. The first four are preparatory, the fifth is a threshold to the three degrees of the Lesser Mysteries that teach the Humanities. 1454 The final four degrees are the Greater Mysteries of the great manifestation of Light. These latter Mysteries teach love or agape in the sense of charity. The steps of the ancient Egyptian Mysteries are: Preparation and Threshold Circumcision and meditation. The Lesser Mysteries 1. Led by the Thesmophores (Guide or Tester) to the Gate of Men, the Candidate is initiated as a Pastophoris (Apprentice). Having taken an oath, light is restored to him and he is placed between two square columns. Between the columns is a ladder with seven steps and an allegorical figure portraying eight doors. The Hierophant (Teacher) exhorts the Pastophoris to guard his prejudices and passions that might draw him from the road to happiness. The Pastophoris then ascends the ladder and is taught that it is a symbol of alchemical transmutation or Metempsychosis . He is then given the word of recognition, taught the handgrip and dressed in a hood, apron and collar with tassels. His duty is then to guard the Gate of Men. 2. After a year of Apprenticeship, the Pastophoris is feasted by beautiful temple virgins and invited to make love to them. He must prove he has command over his desires. If worthy, the Thesmophores (Guide or Tester) then addresses more questions and if found satisfactory, the candidate is introduced to the Assembly. There he is sprinkled with water"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":" 413 by the Stolista (Baptiser) and accepted as a Neocoris (Craftsman). His courage is then tested with a live serpent being thrown over him and he is made to imagine the chamber is filled with serpents. If his courage is proven, the Neocoris is led to two pillars with a griffin between, pushing a spoked-wheel representing the four seasons and earth, water, air and fire. There he is invested with a caduceus, taught the word of the degree and taught of the fall of the human race. He was instructed in architecture, geometry, mathematics and measures. His duty was to wash or anoint the pillars. 3. When meriting the next degree of a Melanophoris (Master Mason), the candidate was led underground through the Gate of Death to a gloomy crypt containing the coffin of the assassinated Osiris. The new Melanophoris was then led into the presence of the Pharaoh, where all the other Melanophoris were assembled. The Pharaoh offered him a crown of gold representing material power and wealth. The Melanophoris was to reject and trample on this crown in order to gain the spiritual crown of truth, morality and virtue. This incurred the wrath of the Pharaoh and the Melanophoris suffered accordingly. Brought back with a peculiar embrace expressing the power of death, the Melanophoris was given the word Monach Caron Mini meaning I count the days of anger . The term of anger is the time needed to master one ’ s own base or animal soul. He was then instructed in alphabet, drawing, painting and rhetoric. He was also taught the history, geometry and astronomy of Egypt. His work was to attend upon the dying and dead. The Greater Mysteries 4. After eighteen months the resurrected adept was invited to the Greater Mysteries. He is then known as Moses , meaning He who is drawn out of the waters (as were all new-born Sun gods such as the Indian Agni or Surya, the Greek Perseus, Finnish Kullervo, Romulus and Welsh Taliesin). Armed with a sword and shield, the Moses has then to fight his way through labyrinth galleries where masked men with flames and serpents attacked him. He was then led blindfolded to the Hall of Maat . Maat is the goddess who represents the full illumination of the human soul. She was represented by a white ostrich feather or jar. In the Hall of Maat he was presented to the Pharaoh and Officers of the Society and there made a Chistophores . They set his arms and legs spread eagle, the Phoenix position. This was a posture similar to the St Andrew ’ s cross used in the old rites as the symbol of resurrection. He then drank a cup of bitter herbs and was dressed in buskins and a mantle, invested with the"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":" 414 armour and weapons of God. The bitter cup is a play on the meaning of Miriam or the goddess Venus as Miriam means bitter as well as the mare or sea. He was to use his weapon to strike off the head of the beautiful but dangerous female aspect of Chaos, the Gorgon Medusa, whose head he presented to the Pharaoh. 1455 In return, the Pharaoh recorded the Chistophores in the Book of Adepts of Egypt. He received with new robes for his spiritual body, tied about the waist by a cord representing truth, life and brotherhood. This cord was tied in a half bow or Ankh representing the strength and frailty of the brotherhood. The Chistophores was presented with the Code of Laws and the emblem of an owl representing Isis, later Athena for the Greeks and Minerva for the Romans. He was taught the secret Ammonitish language and sciences of the human soul. The new Chistophores became a courtier, sustained by the court and able to communicate freely with the Pharaoh. 5. The Chistophores could then demand the degree of a Balahate or Philosopher. He was seated as the sole spectator to a drama where Horus slays and beheads the hundred-headed dragon, Typhon. In silence Horus exhibits the vile head emblematic of the mastery of ones own base nature. The new Balahate was then given the word Chymia and taught the skills of Alchemy. 6. The aspiring Chistophores was led in irons to the Gate of Death through which a crypt was filled with water. He was rowed across in the Barque of Caron and received by the Assembly. There he was made a Maawr , meaning Seer or Priest of Astronomy, and received the history of the gods. He was told of the One God from whom they all emanate. The new Maawr was then taken to the Gate of the Gods and presented to the pantheon. There the Demiurgos (Chief Prophet and Initiator) taught him the secret history of Egypt, the world and the universe. He received the history of the Society, its Order and a list of all Chief Inspectors of the Society and members throughout the world. He was then instructed in astronomy and the Priestly Dance of the movement of the stars and constellations. The word of the degree was Ibis , the symbol of the wise god Thoth. 7. Entry to the final degree was by invitation from the Pharaoh. A grand reception was arranged for the Maawr and it formed a public procession called the Pamylach , meaning circumcision of the tongue representing the higher self. Formerly, the Maawr ’ s penis was circumcised as a sign of purification of the lower self. At the end of the"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":" 415 procession an Assembly was held in a special room called the Maneras , meaning the house of Manes with equivalence to the Indo-Hittite god- king Manu. There the Maawr was made a Saphenath Pancah or Man who knows the Mysteries . He drank of the Cup of Sweetness , the heavenly ambrosia beverage Oimellas , and was told that he had arrived at the end of all the proofs. He received an Ankh to wear on his heart, meaning that he had become a life source or life bestowing spirit for others. He also received a beautiful striped robe called the Etangi representing the blazing White Light of the illumination and discipline in which he lived. His head was next shaved with a square coiffure, called the tonsure. Together with the skull, the tonsure forms a squared circle: 1456 ...the squaring of the circle was a problem that greatly exercised medieval minds. It is a symbol of the opus alchymicum, since it breaks down the original chaotic unity into the four elements and then combines them again in a higher unity. The tonsure therefore represented the third eye. It was based on releasing the spiritual consciousness through the Gate of the Gods . These are the two small holes in the skull called the parietal foramina . The Saphenath Pancah was then given a complete explanation of the Mysteries and permission to read the Books of Hermes, including the royal key to the scriptures of other nations. The greatest attribute he received was the right to vote in the election of Pharaoh and it was from his new rank that the Officers of the Society were drawn. The Pharaoh represented the mind of God, Ptah . 1457 These Officers of the Society represented Ra , or the body of God, and governed the four main temples of Egypt, Hermopolis, Memphis, Heliopolis and Thebes."},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":" 416 Appendix 8 The Perfect Pyramid The following calculations show that the Perfect Pyramid is a function of the Golden Ratio.

In history, only Herodotus has alluded to it. 1458 The key is that the area of a side face is equal to the square of the height of the pyramid. Herodotus ’ statement turns on the translation of the Greek word epipol ē s , which means either in elevation, by the lateral surface or simply in surface . 1459 (5) A = h 2 equating (5) with (4):"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":" 417 h 2 = ½ .s. √ (s 2 /4 + h 2 ) and rearranging to make the apex height (h) the dependant variable: h 2 = ¼ .s 2 .(1 + √ 5)/2 Now (1 + √ 5)/2 is the Golden Ratio Φ so: h 2 = ¼ .s 2 . Φ So the unique formula for a Perfect Pyramid is that the square of the height divided by the square of the side length is equal to the Golden Ratio divided by four: (6) h 2 /s 2 = Φ /4 h 2 /s 2 = 0.404508 h/s = 0.63601 The inverse of h/s is 1.5723. This approximates to Φ (1.618) with an error of only 2.8%. Thus the ratio of the side to the height of the Perfect pyramid is also the Golden Ratio Φ . The area of all four faces is: Area of all four Faces = 4.A Applying the key of Herodotus (5): A= h 2 Area of all four Faces = 4. h 2 Substituting (6) h 2 /s 2 = Φ /4 Area of all four Faces = Φ . s 2 Since the Area of the Base of the Pyramid is s 2 Area of all four Faces = Φ x Area of the Base of the Pyramid Thus the Area of all four Faces is purely a ‘ replication ’ of the Base by the Golden Ratio. Isis was the Goddess of replication and this equation explains why she was described as Mistress of the Pyramid in the Inventory Stele discovered in 1800 CE by Auguste Mariette. The Great Pyramid was the mathematically pure womb of Isis for regeneration of the king as Horus."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":" 418 On rearrangement the equation becomes: Φ = Area of all four Faces / Area of the Base of the Pyramid This means that the area of the Base and the sum of the area of the side faces provide the Golden Ratio. The only measurements necessary are Side length and Side height. This is vividly shown in two dimensions if the Perfect Pyramid is laid flat. The result is a Cross Patte é , the insignia granted to the Knights Templar by Pope Eugenius III in 1146. 1460 The Knights ’ Templar mantle with the Cross Patt é was therefore a visible and perfect calculation of the Golden Ratio and symbol of the Perfect Pyramid. Cross Patté. The Golden Ratio is not the only primary constant inherent in the perfect Pyramid. While the Perfect Pyramid has no need for the knowledge of π , nor precisely demonstrates π , it is the case that ‘ 2/ π ’ is an arbitrary value very close to the perfect value for ‘ h/s ’ in (6) above of 0.63601. The exact value of ‘ 2/ π ’ is 0.63662 so the error is very small indeed, only 0.096%. Squaring the Circle Using the dimensions of the side length and pyramid height, the approximation ‘ h/s ≈ 2/ π ’ provides a good physical estimate of both the Golden Ratio and π . (7) π ≈ 2.s/h This equation can be interpreted as relating the perimeter of a circle with radius ‘ h ’ to the perimeter of the square base ‘ 4.s ’ : (8) 2 π h ≈ 4.s In other words, in an elevation view, the vertical circle drawn through the apex of the pyramid, having its centre at"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":" 419 the middle of the pyramid ’ s base on the ground plane has the same perimeter as that base in plan view. The error is 0.096%. We can even proceed a little further to find a solution to the classic problem of ‘ Squaring the Circle ’ . This is to find a technique of drawing a circle with the same area as a given square, using only geometric means. It has engaged mathematicians for many thousands of years. 1461 Again, let the Perfect Pyramid be laid flat so the sides splay into a Cross Patt é . The area of a circle inscribed within the Cross Patt é is: Area of Inscribed Patt é Circle = π k 2 (pi x radius squared) Substituting (1): k 2 = (s/2) 2 + h 2 Area of Inscribed Patt é Circle = π [(s/2) 2 + h 2 ] = π .s 2 [ ¼ + h 2 /s 2 ] Substituting (6): h 2 /s 2 = Φ /4 Area of Inscribed Patt é Circle = π .s 2 [ ¼ + Φ /4] = ¼ . π .s 2 [1 + Φ ] The exceptional property of the Golden Ratio is that: 1 + Φ = Φ 2 Area of Inscribed Patt é Circle = ¼ . π .s 2 [ Φ 2 ] Since the Area of the Base of the Perfect Pyramid is the side length squared, s 2 : Area of Inscribed Patt é Circle = [ ¼ . π . Φ 2 ] x Area of Base The value of [ ¼ . π . Φ 2 ] is 2.056199, almost the integer two. Substituting the approximate value of two for [ ¼ . π .

This was to take a Perfect"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":" 420 Pyramid, make it into a Cross Patt é and inscribe a circle. The area of the circle is twice that of the square base of the pyramid. Using a square made from the diagonal of the base of the pyramid rather than the base of the pyramid itself, the ‘ twice ’ factor disappears. This is because the diagonal measures s √ 2. The area of such a square is 2.s 2 . Thus the esoteric solution from the Perfect Pyramid is: Area of Inscribed Patt é Circle ≈ Area of a square of the Hypotenuse of the Base of the Pyramid This formula is based on an assumed value of [ ¼ . π . Φ 2 ] of two, which introduces an error of 2.8%. An even better approximation derives quite simply from a Jerusalem or Teutonic Cross. 1462 A Chessboard solves the problem of ‘ Squaring the Circle ’ : 1463 1. Divide the Square into a Chessboard matrix. 2. With a pair of Compasses centered in the middle of the Chessboard, draw a Circle so it passes through points on each side, each two squares in from each corner. This circle has an area that equals that of the square with an error of 1.8%, less than the 2.8% inherent in the Perfect Pyramid method. Schoolchildren sometimes prove the areas are equal using paper. They cut away the corners of the square and rearrange these trimmings to fill the segments of the circle. 3. Again with the Compasses draw a circle so it passes through points on each side that are one square in from each corner. This circle has the same perimeter as the square. The error is also about 1.8%. Ancient architects often wanted to Square the Circle to create a circular column of known cross section that could be set onto a square base.

Britain ’ s geography bears no relation to this shape. Ehe dimensions Caesar obtained are esoteric and the represent sacred dimensions of a holy isle.

The sides of the isosceles triangle are each 1 unit, the same as the sides of the original square. 4. Draw another circle passing through the three corners of the triangle. This is a trial and error procedure but quickly achieved. 5. Draw new triangles using the previous triangle as a template. Rotate the template triangle clockwise. The diagram shows the second position. Discard the external circle and 2x1 rectangle for simplicity. 6. Completing the rotation of the template triangle forms a perfect pentagon within the circle. Inside the pentagon is a five-pointed star. This is the star of the Goddess. Virgin with Child A smaller, inverted pentagon exists in the centre of the Star and Pentagon of the Goddess. The new little pentagon in the centre of the star of the Goddess is therefore analogous to a perfect child. The Goddess therefore is the House of God to the Son, a Virgin with Child. The child is inverted, analogous to a human foetus awaiting birth. The recursive process of forming a star from the pentagon and a new pentagon from the new star demonstrates the infinite procreation of the Goddess.

He is highly acclaimed as an author, poet and classical scholar. His histories of Roman and Greek times in I Claudius and the Argonauts received many accolades. I Claudius became a successful television series. Graves ’ books demonstrate extensive academic investigation. He corresponded with collaborators such as Sir Ronald Storrs, Classical Scholar and Orientalist, who was also a successor in office to Sergius Paulus and Pontius Pilate. One of Robert Graves ’ major achievements is the least understood. He re-established the lost knowledge of the Celtic Bards by deciphering their holy tree alphabet. A key feature of Graves ’ method is that he publishes in true Popperian fashion, baring all to public criticism. There is rarely much criticism because few can keep up with his logic and even fewer can critically match the breadth of his argument. Graves' independent career risked all on the maintenance of reputation and he is highly respected for this. His non-fiction book The White Goddess and historical fiction novel King Jesus are prime examples of Graves' straightforward ‘ semi-circular saw ’ analysis. Graves is always incisive, eloquent, tested, important and scarce. He constantly thinks about his own thinking in a feedback correction that consciously avoids bias. His cognitive approach to personal psychology and honest authorship based on argumentative self-disputation were not formally recognized by US pioneer psychologists like Albert Ellis until at least 20 or 30 years after Graves used it. Furthermore, despite the awesome power of his mind, Robert Graves is a humble man. His respect for the beliefs of all parties and the careful language of his books demonstrates this, while not obscuring the thrust of his scientific approach to mythology."},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":" 426 Appendix 10 Atbash Cipher The Atbash Cipher is an old cipher used in the book of the Prophet Jeremiah based on the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew Alphabet. 1465 The cipher is applied by substituting the first letter of the Hebrew Alphabet aleph with the last letter tav , the second letter beth by the penultimate letter shin , and so on. The new word that results from the encryption is equivalent to the original word. It is very easy for the person employing the cipher to create new words since the new word only has consonants like its originating word. This is because the Hebrew Alphabet is composed of twenty-two consonants and excludes vowels. Hebrew Letter Name English Letter Equivalent Aleph (silent) Tav A Th Beth (B/V) Shin B Sh Gimel Resh G R Dalet Qof D Q He Tsadeh H Tz Vav (V) Feh W P Zayin Ayin (silent) Z O Chet Samech Ch S Tet Nun T N Yod Mem Y M Kaph (K/Kh) Lamed K L The Atbash cipher converts Babel ( BBL ), meaning Babylon, to Shishak (ShShK). 1466 This is achieved by substituting Beth, Beth and Lamed with Shin, Shin and Kaph respectively. A second Atbash method is cyclic rotation with the alphabet as an endless loop. This is an example of a cipher-wheel or alphabet clock. A particular output letter is found by moving either clockwise or anti-clockwise a certain number of steps from the input letter. Another numerical sequence such as six, six, six or eight, ten, twelve, fourteen is provided from other information. This indicates the"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":" 427 particular number of steps to shift. The shift direction can vary from clockwise to anticlockwise for various letters in the same word. Cyclic rotation together with regular letter substitution gives rise to the full Atbash Tableau called the Alphabet of Hiyya. 1467 It has 22 rows and 22 columns. The Atbash sequence AThBSh is the first row. The second is AShBR through to the twenty-second row, which is AABT . Multiple versions of the Alphabet of Hiyya result from irregular letter substitution. This gives rise to 484 different permutations of the Atbash Tableau. Other cipher techniques include writing a word backwards, called Thrashraq (see Appendix 11 for an example in the Triangular Manuscript of St Germain ), and Gematria extension and contraction of words keeping the same numerical value. Full text cipher techniques sometimes vary the calligraphy to create irregular size letters or misspelling. These imperfections might indicate the intended letters. Sometimes the correct letters are a certain number of places to the right or left of an imperfection. Alternatively, a whole text can use equidistant letters sequences to build words. The word Torah exists in Genesis. Another full text technique is to use the physical layout of the scroll or parchment to create words vertically or diagonally for those who have the eye to see. This is how Daniel read the words on the wall in Babylon. 1468 It is also the way that the Priestly Blessing embodies the Holy name YHABLAWN . 1469 Further cipher expansion and contraction is required to achieve a final solution. 1470 Yah is the God of Jedediah, Baal the God of the King of Tyre and On the God of Hiram Abiff. 1471 These are just three of the many names of God."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":" 428 Appendix 11 Triangular Manuscript of Comte St Germain Manly P Hall of the Philosophical Research Society described the Triangular Book of Le Comte Saint Germain as the ‘ rarest of occult manuscripts ’ .

There remain a number of remarkable contemporary testimonies and unsolved puzzles. As for hard evidence, there is none. St. Germain has been described as the greatest of the European adepts. His prodigious knowledge of history and philosophy was often commented upon in his day. In a letter to Frederick II, Voltaire described St. Germain as \"the man who does not die.\" This manuscript bears an attribution on its face not independently verified in any source. The Translation : Robert Word studied the Triangular Manuscript in French and made an English translation in 1979. The Philosophical Research Society gave him ready access in several stages. First, he received the Triangular Book itself, which is cipher plus diagrams. From this he copied out pages of the cipher text and attempted to decipher it. Then he was given the cipher key and later the French text to translate this French text to English. While Robert Word believes his translation to be accurate, it is possible that the French text did not encompass all of the cipher text. Furthermore, the colored figures are an important part of the part of the manuscript. Robert Word was also able to review the notes of Manly P Hall made on the text. Manly P Hall was apparently trying to turn \"ton Levite\" into \"Ton le Vite\" and allude to vibratory chanting. A feature of the manuscript is Thrashraq, which is writing important words or names backwards to produce an elementary cipher. 1473 "},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":" 430 The Triangular Book of the Count of St. Germain The Holy Magic revealed to Moses discovered within an Egyptian monument and preciously preserved in Asia under the emblem of a winged dragon. 1.

Chapter VII THE ADONIS RITES OF JUDAH. The vision of Ezekiel in circa 594 BCE 1 gives a clear picture of the secret rites of Tammuz. He starts as follows: He “ brought me . . to the door of the inner gate that looks towards the north where was the image of Jealousy which provoketh to jealousy. ” What was the “ Image of Jealousy ” opposite the north gate — the symbolic place of darkness? It was Ashtoreth, that is to say, Astarte, the Great Mother, the Lover of Tammuz. In II Kings 2 we read that the good king Josiah broke down and defiled the high places “ which Solomon the King of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth, ” and also for Chemosh and Milcom. So that there should be no doubt of the situation of the shrine of Ashtoreth, we are carefully told that it was on the right hand side. As the temple had its Sanctuary in the west it follows that the right hand side was on the North. The exact spot on which the shrine of Astarte stood was the Mount of Olives. Jeremiah 3 about B.C. 600, gives us the following significant details concerning one of the ceremonies performed in honour of Astarte, whom he calls “ The Queen of Heaven, ” which was one of her later titles. “ Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? The children gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women kneed dough to make cakes and to pour out drink offerings unto other Gods. ” Here we should note the use of bread and wine for a sacra mental feast, while we know from similar observances else where, which survived in Europe up to the 19th century, that these cakes were in the shape of the male organ. 4   1 Ezekiel 8. 3. sq. 2 II. Kings, 23. 13. 3 Jeremiah 8.17 sq. 4 N.M. Penzer, “ Ocean of Story, ” Vol. H. p. 13. Note 3."},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":" 439 Moreover, Jeremiah complains that even the remnant who fled to Egypt after the fall of Jerusalem would not abandon this custom, and to his protests gave an answer which explains exactly the purpose of these obscene emblems, and of similar incidents connected with the worship of the great Fertility Goddess, who by then had largely absorbed the attributes of the Moon, just as her son and lover has partly absorbed those of the Sun. They “ answered ” Jeremiah saying 5 , “ The Word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the Lord we will not hearken unto thee, but will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of bread, and were well, and saw no evil. But since we left off to burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine. “ And when we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her and pour out drink offerings to her without our men (husbands). ” 6 From this answer we learn that the worshippers believed that unless they offered the Goddess these Phallic cakes they would receive from her no harvest. The reason is clear: the corn God represents the seed which is buried in the womb of the earth. The male organ of the drone bee is literally plucked out by the Queen bee and remains embedded in her for the rest of her life; it is in this way that she is fertilised, but at the cost of the life of the drone. In like manner Attis and Tammuz die that the earth may be fertile, hence the reason why the Priests of Cybele and of Artemis at Ephesus had to castrate themselves and offer up their male organs to the Goddess. Therefore the Jewish women, like other worshippers of the Great Goddess, offered as substitutes for the male organs of their husbands, models made out of the “ Flesh ” of the slain corn God, and poured out   5 Jeremiah 44. 16 sq. 6 It was the women alone who carried the obscene emblems in the procession of Isis in Egypt.

In order to make themselves one with the God, the worshippers ate the bread and drank some of the wine. Similar rites were performed all over the world to the Goddess of Fertility, and here we have clear evidence of their survival among the Jews up to B.C. 587. We learn further that naturally these offerings of cakes were made only by the women and at the shrine of Astarte at the north gate. No doubt it was at this time that the women wept for Tammuz slain, whose sad fate they thus commemorated while hoping thereby to gain an abundant harvest. We also see why fire played an important part in these old rites. The children gathered the sticks; at one time they formed the fuel for the sacrifice of burning! The men lighted the fire; they had begotten the children, and hence the symbolism of the act! It was the women, however, who made the cakes, for from them come forth men, as does corn from the Earth. But what were the men doing while the women were busy at the north gate? We shall find that some of them were at the centre in a hidden vault, namely the tomb itself, while others stood watching the east so that they might proclaim the resurrection of the slain God; that the corn would come forth from the womb of Mother Earth; that a new son of the Goddess would be born, destined like his father to wed the Goddess and thereby lose his life. Thus Astarte was every year a widow, and her son posthumous. But though the women had their duties outside the closely barred door of the hidden mysteries, they were evidently not admitted therein. This was the men ’ s house and therefore we will return to Ezekiel and see what he says on the subject, having thus decided whom the “ Figure of Jealousy ” represented and what was taking place before it."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":" 441 The Altar of Sacrifice Ezekiel dismisses most of what is taking place before Astarte with the words, see ” . . . . the great abominations which the House of Israel committeth here, ” 7 and then turns to something which seemed to him even worse, “ And He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall; 8 Then said He unto me, Son of man dig now in the wall; And when I digged in the wall, behold a door.

The creeping things, etc., would be the animals and beasts, such as the bee, the serpent, and the goat, sacred to Astarte, who with the other Gods were painted in frescoes round this chamber. We also notice that the prophet does not call these the Gods of the Canaanites but of “ the house of Israel, ” a most significant fact. What was happening in this close shut chamber away from the light of day? “ And there stood before them the seventy men of the Ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan, with every man his censor in his hand, and a thick cloud of incense went up. ” The first fact that strikes us is that there were seventy, plus a Master of Ceremonies, whose name is given. We are told these were the ancients of Israel, and as we know that the Sanhedrin at the time of the second temple consisted of 72 of the elders of Israel, we can hardly fail to recognise that these men are the Sanhedrin. This would explain the bitter indignation of the true prophet who thus saw the spiritual rulers of the people presiding at what, to him, were unholy rites. But there were only 71, where then was the missing member? We may be sure he was there, but perhaps he could no longer speak, and was either simulating a corpse or, more probably, in grim earnest lying stiff and cold. He no doubt was the representative of Tammuz whom the women were bewailing above ground at the North gate. This explanation is supported by the emphasis laid on the use of incense. There were apparently no statues in this rock hewn tomb, for otherwise assuredly Ezekiel would have mentioned them. He carefully says, however, that the figures were painted on the walls of the chamber, and incense is not offered to frescoes in religious ceremonies. Let us refresh our memories as to what happened in Babylonia at the lamentation for Tammuz. “ The dirges were seemingly chanted over an   9 This actually exists to-day in the South East corner of the “ Rock ” of the altar of sacrifice and leads into the vault.

The Babylonians who were more civilized at that epoch than the Jews may well have substituted an image for a man, just as the Greeks did later; perhaps when all went well the Jews also had learnt to do the same, but in the hour of dread and danger, blood, and only human blood, could satisfy the Goddess. The prophets of Jehovah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, had pro claimed that He had doomed Judah to destruction. What then of the Great Mother. Perhaps she at least would hear them? But in this hour of extremity no paltry substitutes would suffice. We may well believe that the frenzied worshippers of Astarte cried, “ It is meet that one man should die for the whole people. ” And who but the High Priest of Tammuz could prove an acceptable sacrifice? But Ezekiel leaves us in little doubt on the point, for in the next chapter but two he says : —‘ Moreover, the Spirit lifted me up and brought me unto the East gate of the Lord ’ s house, which looketh eastwards, and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men, among whom I saw Jaazaniah, the son of Azur, and Pelatiah, the son of Benaiah, Princes of the people. Then said He unto me, Son of Man, these are the men that devise mischief and give wicked counsel in this city: which say, Let us build houses: this city is the cauldron and we be the flesh. ’ 11 The meaning of this phrase seems obscure, but we will follow it up in a moment. Meanwhile we obtain one of the keys to the problem, two verses further on, in the fiery denunciation of the Prophet. “ Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, ye have filled the streets thereof with slain. Therefore, thus saith the Lord God; Your slain whom ye have lain in the midst of it they are the flesh and this the   10 Frazer, “ Adonis, Attis, Osiris. ” 3rd ed. Vol. I. p. 9. 11 Ezekiel 11. 1 sq."},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":" 444 cauldron. . . . Ye have feared the sword, and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord God. ” Here, from the burning and justifiable wrath of the prophet we learn that these twenty-five men, in order to avert the threatened attack by the Babylonians, had recently had a great “ Day of Blood, ” no doubt like that of Cybele in Rome, but with fatal results. We learn also that Jaazaniah was one of the Princes of Israel, and have previously seen that the old Syrian Kings considered that they were incarnations of the God Tammuz. Thus there can, I fear, be little doubt as to whether it was a real or simulated corpse which lay in the rock hewn tomb while the voice of lamentation went up at the North gate. The reference to the cauldron and the flesh must now be considered. Jeremiah when the Lord asked him “ What seest thou? ” answered, “ And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is towards the North. ” It will be noticed that the face of the pot is towards the place where stood the shrine of Astarte: the place of darkness and of the Underworld, which is most significant. At first sight it might be thought that this pot was merely a parable, but it appears that it was really one of the chief causes of the wrath of Jehovah, since it stood for a Pagan Rite which He abominated. There is a widespread magical process of which we find many traces whereby if a man is slain, cut up and boiled in a pot, he will be restored to youth and life. According to Greek legends Medea took advantage of this superstition to encompass the death of her father-in-law, and the ancient British God of the Sea had a magic cauldron in which he placed the bodies of men who had been slain in battle and brought them back to life again. 12 In the High History of the Holy Graal we have a very unpleasant story concerning such a cauldron. The Son of a King who followed the Old Law was slain by a Giant. 13 Sir Gawain killed the Giant and brought back the boy ’ s corpse, whereupon to his amazement the father took the corpse, cut it up, boiled it in a cauldron and then distributed the pieces among his chief men. 14   12 Jeremiah 1. 13. 13 Mabinogion pp. 87, 44.

Every- man ed. p. 76"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":" 445 Many competent critics now consider that the Graal legends incorporate incidents from the old cult of Adonis, 15 a view with which I agree, and if so we at once see that this cauldron was used by the Jews to perform a ceremony intended to assist in the rejuvenation and resurrection of the slain Adonis, and for this reason it was placed with its face towards the North. Whether the worshippers, like the King and nobles in the Graal story, partook of the ghastly food, we cannot definitely say, but unfortunately this seems probable. We know that similar cannibalistic feasts take place among savage tribes; we know that the corn was spoken of as the body of the Dead God, and as such was consumed as a sacrament by the worshippers; we know that the wine was likened to his blood, and that these substitutes were an amelioration of an older cannibalistic feast. Therefore, at a time of crisis we may well fear that the frenzied Jews who followed this cult would not hesitate to go so far. Indeed, the very denunciations of the prophet point in this direction. We know that the Prophet of Jehovah after referring to some idolatrous practice constantly says a similar fate shall fall upon the whole nation. 16 For example, in this very passage Ezekiel, after referring to these slayings, says that the men who did them shall in their turn be slain. Moreover, a few chapters later in denouncing Judah he says : — “ Thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast born unto Me, and these hast thou sacrificed to devour them. Thou hast slain my children and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them. ” 17 The combined effect of these two passages indicates quite clearly that not only were the children sacrificed by means of fire, but they were actually eaten. In verse 13 of chapter 2, Ezekiel tells us that Pelatiah died. Perhaps herein we receive a hint as to who was the silent corpse in the, secret chamber, for there Jaazaniah alone is mentioned by name. But there were other incidents connected with these rites of Adonis, for “ He said also unto me, 18 Turn thee yet again, thou shalt see greater abominations that they do. Then he brought me to the door of the   15 J. L. Weston, “ The Quest of the Holy Graal. ” 16 See also the fate of the false prophets in Jeremiah 14, 15. 17 Ezekiel, 16. 20 sq. 18 Ezekiel, 8, 13."},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":" 446 gate of the Lord ’ s house which was towards the North; 19 and behold there sat women weeping for Tammuz. And he said unto me, Hast thou seen, 0 Son of Man? turn thee yet again, thou shalt see greater abominations than these. And he brought me into the inner court of the Lord ’ s house, and, behold at the door of the Temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs towards the Temple of the Lord, and their faces towards the east; and they worshipped the sun towards the east. ” We learn further that “ they put the branch to their nose. ” This might appear to be only a sign of derision, but a branch or a tree is always closely associated with Tammuz, as we have already seen, and Mr. Stanley Smith of the Assyrian Department of the British Museum agrees with me that this also was one of the ritual practices of the cult. The soul of the slain man was sup posed to enter into a tree, which symbolically grew out of the grave. The original idea was that the seed which was planted and died transmitted its soul to the plant or branch which grew therefrom. That the Jews enacted a tree drama, similar to that in the Cult of Attis, is shown by Jeremiah. “ For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe. They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not. They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be born, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them. ” 20 This clearly indicates the ceremonial carrying in of a decorated tree, probably with an image of Tammuz fastened thereon, as we find elsewhere, particularly in the worship of Attis. We know that they said of a stock, i.e., a pillar of wood, “ Thou art my father. ” These stocks were plain pieces of wood, merely trunks of trees, and it is clear that they were not only symbols of the phallus but also the residing place of the Spirit of Vegetation. Among many primitive   19 Where stood the figure of Astarte and apparently the seething cauldron. 20 Jeremiah 10. 3. sq."},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":" 447 races the belief is current that the souls of those waiting to become incarnate dwell in the trees, so much so that many races think that a woman can become pregnant if the seed or flower of certain trees falls on her. Thus certain Central African races believe that if the purple blossom of the banana tree falls on the back of a woman, even though she be unmarried, she will have a baby. 21 In this belief we have the cause and origin of many stories well known to the students of folk-lore in which a virgin gives birth to a child because she has smelt a flower, eaten a fruit, or perhaps merely handled either. For example, Attis himself is said to have been born because his virgin mother, Nana, placed a certain seed in her bosom. Nana, incidentally, means Mother, and is of course the name of the Great Mother. Probably the answer given to the inquisitive child to-day who wants to know whence the new baby has come, namely, that it was grown on a gooseberry bush, is the worn down tradition of this once almost universal belief. Fantastic as it sounds, even now many tribes do not know that a woman cannot become a Mother without the help of a man. 22 They say that she becomes a mother only when a soul which is waiting for the opportunity can slip inside her, and the most common method adopted by these waiting embryos is to hide themselves in a seed or flower, or merely fall from a bush on to a woman. Races who still hold these beliefs are the tribes of New Guinea and the Australian blacks. Hence to these people there is nothing very remarkable in a virgin birth. Now all these tribes believe in re-incarnation, and their line of argument runs somewhat as follows: — We bury our dead in the ground, and lo, a tree or plant grows from the spot. This contains the life-principle of him who dies, his soul is in it, and from it he leaps into a woman and so once more is born. Frankly, the modern man who, while acknowledging that a human being has a soul, appears to believe that that soul is created by the same procedure that creates the infant ’ s body is even more illogical, for how can a material act create an immaterial and immortal being? The doctrine of re-incarnation attaches to the Spirit of Vegetation in a much higher degree. The God dies and is buried, a tree springs up   21 Rev. J. Roscoe, “ The Baganda, ” pp.47 sq. 22 Prof. Malinowski, “ The Beliefs of the Trobriand Islands, New Guinea. ”"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":" 448 from his grave, and therein resides the soul which can again enter into flesh. So powerful is this divine soul that it can, as it were, eject, or at any rate overshadow, the ordinary human soul resident in a suitable body, and take its place. Therefore certain of the ceremonies of the Vegetation Cult include elaborate details for transferring the soul of the dead God-man into a strong and healthy physical body, which hence forth is supposed to possess the Divine Soul, and ultimately suffers the same fate as its predecessor. Among such rites are raising the Corpse and drawing in the dead man ’ s breath; stepping over the corpse or over its grave, etc. Thus it would appear as though the transference of the Divine soul of Adonis in Judea was made by someone sniffing a bough which had either formed part of the Adonis tree or had been planted on his grave. This fact explains the significance of the sprig of acacia in masonry. We now understand why the Jews said of a tree trunk or “ Stock, ” “ Thou hast begotten us. ” The actual passage is as follows : — “ Saying to a stock, Thou art my father: 23 arid to a stone, 24 thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned the hinder part of their necks to me and not the face. ” 25 The authorized version says, “ Backs ” but the above is the literal Hebrew and conveys an important piece of information. “ Their backs ” might be merely allegorical, but the other phrase admirably depicts what the twenty-five elders were doing, i.e., with heads bent back gazing upwards, watching for the sun to rise above the horizon, which would indicate that the soul of the dead Tammuz had arisen and passed into the bough which his successor was about to sniff. Thus we see in both scriptural passages a reference to the worship of the sun and to a tree, and in each case the primitive idea is clearly rebirth, or the resurrection of the slain God, Tammuz, over whom the women at the north gate were weeping, while the seventy and one elders in the tomb were by means of prayer and incense striving to raise him. We can have little doubt that a sprig, possibly of acacia, was sticking in   23 or “ Hast begotten me. ” 24 These seem to have been flat stones with a socket into which the “ Stock ” was set. These would symbolise Mother Earth, and the “ Stock ” the Spirit Vegetation.

For example, the mourning for Adonis lasted three days, which is meaningless if he was either a purely Solar or a purely Corn God, whereas the Moon vanished from the sky for three whole days every month. On the other hand, this occurs thirteen times in the year and not once a year, as does the burying of the seed. Astarte also takes on, at quite an early date, the attributes of the Moon and of Venus, a point which is of some importance to us. It should also be noted that she was from the very earliest not only the Goddess of Love but of War and Destruction, therein showing her similarity to Kali in India, and giving a good reason why her mate should bear such a title as “ He who destroys. ” The date of the mourning for Tammuz seems to have been near Midsummer in Judea, in other words, at the gathering in of the Harvest, which in Palestine takes place in two sections : — the barley in April and the wheat towards the end of May and the beginning of June. The second half of June and the first half of July is still called Tammuz by the Jews. The mourning synchronized with the threshing, 27 hence the significance of the fact that the Temple was built on the threshing floor of Arunah the Jebusite. It is generally believed that it actually occurred about Midsummer Day, or St. John in Summer, as we should call it, and Professor Jastrow says : —‘ ‘ The calendar of the Jewish church still marks the seventeenth day of Tammuz as a fast, and Houtsma has shown that the association of the day with the capture of Jerusalem by the Romans represents merely the attempt to give an ancient festival a worthier interpretation. ” 28   26 Compare the ritual death and resurrection rite among the Australian Blacks. See Chap. XX. 27 Frazer, “ Adonis, Attis, Osiris. ” 3rd ed. Vol. I. p. 231. 28 Prof M.

Let us now recapitulate what we have discovered concerning the Rites of Adonis among the Jews, as revealed in their own writings. There were three courts in the Temple of King Solomon, which may hint at three degrees. The first was the women ’ s court, beyond which they were not permitted to pass, and which therefore would symbolise birth. The second court was that of the men, and obviously symbolises life in this world of work and war. The third was restricted to the Priests, and it was here that the great natural rock altar of sacrifice stood; on this the burnt offerings were made, and beneath it was the mysterious rock- hewn chamber, still in existence. Is not this the open grave — the tomb, the symbol of death and also, be it noted, of sacrifice? Beyond this lay the porch, whence the twenty-five elders looked east towards the Sun. Here at times stood the throne of the King; may we not call it the chair of the Master? Behind lay the enclosed part of the Temple, divided into two, and into the Sactum Sanctorum only the High Priest himself might enter. To us the porch would symbolise the Installed Master, the risen King, and beyond lay the mystery of the unity of the God head and the Sacred Name, while the innermost secrets were reserved for the High Priest, who would correspond to the J. of the R .A., and his ceremonies to the Masonic degree of High Priest, which seems to have been originally part of the secrets of J. 30 It will be noticed that if so, the King or Master sat in the West, which is precisely what we still find in an Operative Lodge, and the   29 Josephus, “ The Wars of the Jews, ” 11.8: “ Antiquities ” 18.5. par. 9: 18. 1. par. 5. 30 Ward, “ An Explanation of the R .A. Degree. ”"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":" 451 present position in a Speculative Lodge may be due to the increasing triumph of the Solar Cult over the old Vegetation Cult. Students are of the opinion that the Kings of Judah were anointed, crowned and enthroned between the Pillars, and we know that Adonis in other Syrian Kingdoms was the Divine King of the city. His robes were red, like those of the Z. in the R .A., and when the Roman soldiery in mockery crowned Jesus they robed him in Royal red 31 in a manner similar to that in which the figure of Adonis lay in state. The women were certainly not in the secret vault, that is clear, and therefore the regulation which debarred them from approaching nearer to the altar than their own court was not exclusively a Jehovistic command. It is thus quite probable that there were in Judah, just as there were in other ancient religions, an exoteric and an esoteric Cult. The ordinary worshippers never got further than the substituted secrets, which in this case would be an explanation that the ceremony was a magical one intended to increase the fertility of the soil; the Priests, however, who entered the Temple itself, learnt there not merely an allegorical interpretation of the external ceremonies, but, still more important, that God was one, and one only. This teaching, which as masons well know, forms the essence of the R .A., is common to many faiths, but in Judea it seems as if some members of this supreme degree, filled with zeal for the true God, refused to remain silent. They shouted from the house tops their great discovery that there was but one God, and, despite persecution, and probably in many cases death itself, persisted in their teaching. Nevertheless, there may have been other spiritually minded men who, while recognising that the old Adonis Cult as it then stood contained much that was repulsive, perceived that it also contained much that was good, and therefore set themselves to purge it of certain objectionable elements. And we shall see in the next chapter, in the writings attributed to King Solomon, there seems to be the beginning of an attempt to attach an allegorical meaning to some of the ceremonies. After the Captivity this school of thought, I suggest, used this Cult as an allegory, and by dramatic representations taught the great truth that death does not end all, for beyond the grave of the willing sacrifice lies the resurrection, and only   31 Purple in Biblical and classical times means “ Red, ” not the violet colour we now call purple."},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":" 452 by that path can men truly enter into the knowledge of God. These men, I consider, were represented in the days of Josephus by the Essenes. Let us now concentrate on what the Adonis Rites were: (1) There was a tree and the slaying of a God-man; which ceremony may in times of prosperity have been merely a dramatic representation, but in times of stress, as even to-day in India, 32 no doubt men were slain. (2) There was a ceremony with a cauldron. (3) The women offered cakes in the form of the phallus to Astarte, and wept for Tammuz, the cakes being clearly a substitute for the male organs of their husbands. (4) Meanwhile in a secret cave under the altar of sacrifice the Elders were endeavouring to raise the slain man to life. (5) In front of the altar, and facing the rising sun, twenty- five other Elders were invoking the Sun, waiting for it to rise, as that was the sign that he who had died as a man had entered into Heaven as a God. (6) After that a branch of a tree played an important part and was sniffed by some of the worshippers. This branch was apparently growing out of the grave of the dead man. (7) There was a sacramental meal consisting of bread and wine, symbolising the body and blood of the Vegetation God, which in all such Rites replaces a more cannibalistic feast, hinted at in the presence of the cauldron, which later appears in the Graal legend, even in the 12th century. This feast seems to have been an integral part of the Essene Rites.

Moreover, we have not yet exhausted all the information concerning these ceremonies which we can obtain from the Bible itself, and in the next chapter we shall learn a good deal from two books which are supposed to have been written by King Solomon. There existed, however, among the Jews not only the open Rites of Adonis but also an inner secret ceremony. Can we there fore trace any further features of the Adonis Cult, and in particular what was supposed to befall the Soul of the representative of Adonis during the three days between his death and resurrection? This quest we will take up in the next chapter but one, for there is no doubt that the legend of Jonah deals with this theme. CHAPTER XII - THEIR SURVIVAL UNDER THE ESSENES. The Jews, like the nations around them, had a mystery system at the beginning of the Christian era. This consisted of the four degrees of the Essenes 33 and has always been a problem to students of antiquity, for our knowledge is, alas, somewhat limited. What we have, however, is definite enough and will bear recapitulating here. They were a celibate order among the Jews, first mentioned in the time of Jonathan Maccabee (161 -144 B.C.), but although this is the earliest record of their existence the authorities agree that they were of a far earlier origin. The three earliest authorities are Philo, 34 Pliny the elder 35 , and Josephus. 36 Eusebius quoting a lost book of Josephus also gives us some interesting details, and one of the last references to them is in Epithanius, who died in A.D. 402. Our best account is that given by Josephus, in which he tells us that the Essenes were mostly ce1ib but that a few of them did marry. That they formed a kind of brotherhood and could recognise each other, so that   33 Encycl. Brit. Vol. 9. p. 779, also Vol. 2. p. 457 sq. 34 Philo, “ Quod omnis probus. ” 35 Pliny, “ Nat.

They held all goods in common, despised riches, and led very frugal lives. As he seems to have been admitted to the first degree, although he went no further, he undoubtedly knew of what he was speaking. He says, “ As for their piety towards God, it is very extraordinary, for, before Sun-rising, they speak not a word about profane matters, but put up certain prayers, which they have received from their forefathers, as if they made a supplication for its rising. ” On ceremonial occasions they clothed themselves in a white garment and we are also told that they assembled in “ an apartment of their own, into which it is not permitted to any of another sect to enter; while they go after a pure manner into the dining room, as into a certain holy temple. ” We learn that they were famed for their fidelity, truthfulness and mercy, were particularly charitable to the poor and distressed, while they abominated lax conduct or profanity. THE INITIATIONS. “ Now if anyone hath a mind to come over to their sect, he is not immediately admitted, but is prescribed the same method of living which they use for a year, while he continues excluded, and they give him also a small hatchet and the aforementioned girdle and the white garment. 37 And when he has given evidence during that time that he can observe their continence, he approaches nearer to their way of living, and is made a partaker of the waters of purification; yet is he even now not admitted to live with them; for after this demonstration of fortitude, his temper is tried two more years and if he appears to be worthy, they then admit him into their society. And before he is allowed to touch their common food, he is obliged to take tremendous oaths, that in the first place he will exercise piety towards God and then he will observe justice towards men, and that he will do no harm to anyone, either of his own accord or by the command of others; that he will always hate the wicked and be assistant to the righteous; that he will ever show fidelity to all men and especially   37 Note the axe, the emblem of Sandan, etc., and the same as the gavel, likewise the cord and the badge of innocence."},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":" 455 to those in authority, because no one obtains the government without God ’ s assistance. That he will neither conceal anything from his own sect, nor discover any of their doctrines to others; no, not though anyone should compel him so to do at the hazard of his life . Moreover, he swears to communicate their doctrines to no one any otherwise than as he received them himself; that he will abstain from robbery, and will equally preserve the books belonging to the sect and the names of the Angels. 38 These are the oaths by which they receive their proselytes to themselves. But for those that are caught in any heinous sin, they cast them out of their society. . . . What they most honour, after God Himself, is the name of their legislator, 39 whom if anyone blaspheme, he is punished capitally. 40 They also think it a good thing to obey their elders and the majority. Accordingly, if ten of them be sitting together, no one of them will speak while the other nine are against it. ” Now if my brother masons will cast their minds back to their own ob. and to the charge after initiation they cannot fail to be struck with the similarity. Josephus further informs us that the society was divided into four distinct degrees, one above the other, that the members believed that man had a soul which survived death, therein differing from the Sadducees, and that after death the souls of the righteous go to Paradise, whereas the wicked are “ in a place of punishment. ” His words are: “ But when they are set free from the bonds of the flesh they then, as released from a long bondage, rejoice and mount up wards. And this is like the opinion of the Greeks that good souls have their habitations   38 The phrase, “ Names of the Angels ” has always puzzled the commentators, who suggest “ messengers. ” A more probable explanation is that the names of the angels were the pass words of the degrees. 39 Some commentators suggest that this legislator was Moses, but without producing the slightest evidence. On the contrary, had it been Moses undoubtedly Josephus would have said so. Who this semi divine legislator could have been we can only surmise, no doubt he was a reputed founder of the Order, perhaps Solomon — possibly Hiram Abiff. 40 This means having the head cut off. Clearly the legislator who could be “ blasphemed ” must have been semi-divine."},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":" 456 beyond the ocean in a region such as is refreshed by the gentle breathing or a West wind, that is perpetually blowing through the ocean; while they allot to bad souls a dark and tempestuous den, full of never ceasing punishment. And indeed the Greeks seemed to me to have followed the same notion when they allot the Islands of the Blest to their brave men, whom they call heroes and demigods; and to the souls of the wicked, the regions of the ungodly, in Hades. ” From the concluding lines it is clear that Josephus means that the Essenes, like the Greeks, believed that the Paradise of the good was in the Isles of the Blest. Later on he tells us that the Pharisees also believed in the immortality of the soul. “ They say that all souls are incorruptible, but that the souls of good men only are removed into other bodies, but the souls of bad men are subject to eternal punishment. ” This passage seems to imply that whereas the Essenes believed in the ultimate re-incarnation of both bad and good after a period spent in Purgatory or Paradise, the Pharisees believed that only the good were ultimately reborn on earth (in a body) ; the wicked remained in perpetual torment. He further tells us that the Sadducees did not believe in any form of immortality at all. If the Essenes were descended from the old worshippers of Adonis we should certainly expect some trace in their beliefs of re- incarnation, since that doctrine underlies the whole of the beliefs associated with Tammuz. In any case Josephus ’ account is of great importance to us for it records several details which indicate that the Essenes were really a reformed version of the old Tammuz cult, and that they are a very probable link in the chain of the evolution of that cult into modern Speculative Free masonry. Firstly the worship of the sun is very remarkable in an orthodox Jewish sect. Ezekiel thundered against it at the time of the Babylonian Captivity, and yet we thus find it still going on among a recognised sect of the Jews, circa 70 A.D.. More significant still, his denunciation of the Solar Worship is linked up with a denunciation of women weeping for Tammuz. And from that account we learn that Ezekiel either in the flesh or, more probably, in a vision saw three sets of heathen practices taking place about the same time in the Temple itself."},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":" 457 (a) The elders of Israel in a secret underground chamber offering incense to all the Gods of the Syrians and Canaanites. (b) The women weeping for Tammuz at the North Gate. (c) Twenty-five Elders of Israel, with their backs to the Temple itself, looking towards the East and invoking the Sun. Thus we see that the worship of the sun and the lamenting for Tammuz were closely interlocked, and yet we find the Essenes invoking the Sun at Dawn. Moreover, Ezekiel accuses the King of Tyre of claiming to be a God, a claim which the King would certainly consider himself entitled to make as an incarnation of Tammuz. Therefore we are bound to conclude that Ezekiel was attacking a semi-secret cult of Tammuz, or Adonis, popular in Jerusalem, which acknowledged the King of Tyre to be the living representative of Tammuz. It is obvious that Hiram of Tyre, who lived in the days of King Solomon and David, could not have been alive 500 years later, and yet Ezekiel speaks as if it were the same man who had helped to build the Temple. He even says that he walked in Eden, which itself seems to imply that he knew and believed the Rabbinic legends which say that Hiram was allowed to enter Paradise alive because of the important service he had rendered to King Solomon. The only feasible explanation is that Hiram, like Pharaoh, is a title, and that Ezekiel, hearing men speak of a Hiram, King of Tyre, thought that he was the same man as had helped Solomon, and this probably explains why he seemed so distressed at having to denounce him for what he regarded as a falling away from the light. What, however, we must now realise is that a rite which involved invoking the sun at dawn, and which was denounced by Ezekiel in the 6th century B.C., was still being performed in 70 A .D. by an Order which had secret initiation Rites, and taught the doctrines of the resurrection and of re-incarnation. This Order, I suggest, was merely a reformed and purified survival of the old Tammuz cult. If this be so we can well understand why they tested their candidates so rigorously and bound them by tremendous penal oaths. The more closely we investigate the Essenes the more clear it becomes that on the one hand they were derived from the old Cult, and on the other passed on some of their ceremonies to kindred secret societies,"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":" 458 such as the Dervish rites, which still survive in Palestine. The ceremonial bathing or kind of baptism which the Essenes practised was always associated with the Adonis and Attis rites. It has survived in the Operative rituals to day, although it is no longer enforced. According to the ritual the candidate has to step right into a bath, after which he is clothed with a long white garment, opening in front. I know quite a number of men who had to go through this ceremony only ten or twelve years ago. Although the bathing has now been omitted the white robe is still used, and similar robes were in use in old Dundee Lodge, a Speculative Lodge, in the 18th century, and were still in existence, though not in use, up to 1904, when they were destroyed. 41 Similar robes were in use in Boston, U.S.A. in 1914. 42 The convenience of these robes when testing a man ’ s virility is obvious, and this was a custom which had not died out in Wales 40 years ago. 43 The celibacy adopted by the majority of the Essenes was almost certainly a mild substitute for the emasculation at one time demanded by the Great Mother, which still at this date (A .D. 71) was exacted from the Priests of the more primitive forms of the cult at Heirapolis and elsewhere. The four degrees have a striking similarity to the Masonic arrangement of the three Craft degrees and the R .A.. It is also worth mentioning that the Essenes had a strong objection to slavery, and protested against it as unjust and a violation of the brotherhood of man. Have we here the origin of the Masonic objection to receiving into the Order anyone who is not free? At any rate we may feel sure that any slave made an Essene was immediately set free, and therefore the Order would contain only free men. It may be noted that this humanitarian attitude was unique at that time in the ancient world. Even the best Pagans saw no harm in slavery, indeed accepted it as inevitable. The very name Essenes presents an interesting problem. The commentators have been entirely unable to suggest its derivation, except that it may come from a Persian word, and here their arguments are far from convincing. Now Diana, or Artemis of Ephesus, who was of course merely another form of Astarte, had an order of Priests who were either   41 A.

It therefore seems probable that this Jewish secret society derives its name, not from a Hebrew word meaning the “ Pail, ” as some have suggested, but from the name also applied to the Priests of the Great Mother at Ephesus, who like them were naturally celibates. The emblems of this goddess were the bee, the lion, the goat and the bear, and three of these are closely associated with Freemasonry. The striking similarity of their obligation to ours and to our E . Charge seems to link this order with Freemasonry. That all traces of the old fertility cult were not extinct even among the orthodox Jews is shown by the Festival of Purim. This feast, right down into the 18th century at any rate, had nearly all the characteristics of the Roman Saturnalia, and one of the most extraordinary features was the hanging of a figure of a man on a tree or cross. The man was said to be Haman, but modern critics are agreed that this is a substitute for the old fertility god. 4546   44 See “ Artemis. ’’ Encyl. Brjt. Uth. ed. vol.
