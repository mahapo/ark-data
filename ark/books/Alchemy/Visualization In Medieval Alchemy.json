[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" 1 Visualization in Medieval Alchemy by Barbara Obrist 1. Introduction Visualization in medieval alchemy is a relatively late phenomenon. Documents dating from the introduction of alchemy into the Latin West around 1140 up to the mid-thirteenth century are almost devoid of pictorial elements.[1] During the next century and a half, the primary mode of representation remained linguistic and propositional; pictorial forms developed neither rapidly nor in any continuous way. This state of affairs changed in the early fifteenth century when illustrations no longer merely punctuated alchemical texts but were organized into whole series and into synthetic pictorial representations of the pr inciples governing the discipline. The rapidly growing number of illustrations made texts recede to"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 2 the point where they were reduced to picture labels, as is the case with the Scrowle by the very successful al chemist George Ripley (d. about 1490). The Silent Book ( Mutus Liber , La Rochelle, 1677) is entirely composed of pictures. However, medieval alchemical literature was not monolithic. Differing literary genres and types of illustrations coexisted, and texts dealing with the transformation of metals and other substances were indebted to diverging philosophical traditions. Therefor e, rather than attempting to establish an exhaustive inventor y of visual forms in medieval alchemy or a premature synthesis, the purpose of this article is to sketch major trends in visualization and to exemplify them by their earliest appearance so far known. The notion of visualization include s a large spectrum of possible pictorial forms, both verbal and non-verbal. On the level of verbal expression, all derivations from discursive language may be considered to fall into the category of pictorial representation insofar as the setting apart of groups of linguistic signs corresponds to a specific intention at formalization. The main form of these are lists and tables wh ich may or may not be combined with linear, diagrammatic constructs. Occasionally, discursive language is also used to construe figures or part s of figures and sometimes they include portions of texts (Figures 1 & 2)."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 Figure 1: Venise, Biblioteca nazionale Marciana, ms. gr. 299, fol. 188v (tenth to eleventh century).

Whether they are composed of word s or of lines, the basic forms of diagrammatic figures of alchemical documents are rectangular and circular.

In the Platonic and neo-Platonic philosophical and theological traditions it expresse s perfection; in the Aristotelian context of natural philosophy it refers to cyclical processes within the spherical cosmos. Figurative representations, anthropomorphic or non-anthropomorphic, may be a dded subsequently just as they may stand alone and form complete scenes. In connexion with alchemical texts, pictorial representation relates either to observable or to unobser vable objects and processes, and to conceptual schemes. The cate gory of visible and observable things comprises, above all, a pparatus, furnaces and vessels, characteristics of substances, and stages of transformation. While furnaces and vessels are depicted by direct imitation, observable characteristics and their altera tions are visualized either diagrammatically or by way of similes previously developed on the discursive level. The category of the invisible and unobservable includes the so-called occult or hidden qualities of substances and change of qualities supposed to be either latent and interior to a given substance or subterranean. A bove all, it comprises that of substantial change, which was unde rstood, following Aristotle, as the passage from generation to corruption and vice versa (Ganzenmüller 1939) . All of th ese are also visualized by diagrammatic figures and by ve rbal similes that have been transposed onto the pictorial level. In this case, tables and more elaborate diagrammatic figures tend to relate categories of the visible to categories of the invisibl e, for instance lists of observable celestial data to processes of s ubterranean natural generation and to the transformation of substances produced by human art. As to conceptual schemes, they are visu alized, above all, by geometrical figures and by diagrams to whic h may be added personifications"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 and other figurative elements, and which occasionally develop into figurative representations. Verbal and pictorial similes in alchemical documents may be divided into two main groups: analogies , on the one hand, and diverse rhetorical forms of figurative speech – allegory, metaphor, enigma – on the other. While the basic function of analogies is to help finding unknown terms and to name them, the other category of similes relates to persuasion, clarificati on, and simple comparison. This division, however, merely indicate s major tendencies. Hybrid forms are frequent and even the rule as literary genres of alchemical writings diversify in the later Mi ddle Ages. Moreover, similes taken from the macrocosmic, microcosmi c, animal, and vegetal realms do not only have a heuristic function but they are also intended to conceal and to mislead. Following a recurrent complaint, the ensuing confusion was one of the many problems alchemists encountered when choosing the ingr edients for thei r work. Indeed, from its very beginnings in Alex andrian Egypt, alchemy was the only scientific discipline to systematically resort to similes. However, the use of symbolic signs, which were an integral part of Greek alchemical documents[2] (Figur e 1), remained sporadic in the Latin West between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries. One of the few instances of symbolic notation for metals, which were partly derived from planetary pictogram s as well as for sulphur and arsenic, occurs in a late thirteenth-century copy of (pseudo) Albertus Magnus, De alchimia (also entitled Semita recta ).[3] And in the early fifteenth century the richly illustrated Book of the Holy Trinity used, besides planetary symbols, diverse signs similar to those found in magical texts, such as configurations made of dots and small circles, the swastika , and also letters from the alphabet.[4]"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 The presence of pictorial forms in medieval alchemy raises, above all, the problem of their function in medieval scientific texts as well as in texts that deviate from cont emporary criteria of scientificity. Medieval alchemy defined itself as scientia and as ars . That is, alchemy was not merely a contem plative discipline – the proper concern of ancient and medieval science –, but it was also aimed at efficiency, at bringing about change in the realm of corporeal substances. Its operations resulted in innovations – especially in the era of distillation products – in need of explanation. Accordingly, medieval alchemy made a continuous, always renewed effort to become part of an universally approved and institutionally transmitted cosmological system. But although is was occasionally acknowledged as a science, its scie ntific status was frequently put into question and even denied, it being considered either a mere craft or the activity of charlata ns. Indeed, the problems alchemists encountered highlight a specific medieval reality, namely the gulf between science and the crafts. Whil e science was considered to be an intellectual, rational activity based on true principles, crafts were defined as being based merely on empirically acquired knowledge, on experience. Thus, due to its claim to adopt scientific principles as guidelines for operating, alchemy deviated from standard conceptions of science, ju st as it stood in sharp contrast to most medieval crafts. Not only did the elaboration and the transmission of its general theori es of natural and artificial formation and transformation of su bstances hinge on literacy, but even the knowledge of its reci pes was ultimately based on the written word. Despite the fact that medieval alchemy defined itself as a science, it cannot be termed ‘chemistry’, nor can it be considered to represent a stage in the history of chemistry and of experimental"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 science. Its general theories of na tural and artificial formation of substances were cast in terms of the prevailing Aristotelian and neo-Platonic philosophical frameworks. As long as the conception of the universe as an organic whol e prevailed, its dismembering and the experimental reproduction of na tural mechanisms were neither thinkable nor realizable.[5] Despite multiple attempts at all- embracing explanations of substant ial change, natural and artificial, as well as at systematization of operational procedures, theory remained divorced from experime ntal data. Despite its claim to universality through unifying theory and widely circulating texts, particularism prevailed in alchemy in the same way it did in all traditional crafts of pre-industrial societies due to specific local working traditions, vocabulary, and the practice of secrecy. Lastly, minerals, metals, salts, and other substances used by alchemists varied widely from one geographical area to another in terms of composition and impurities. On the grounds of these consid erations, the analysis of visualization will be based on a historical evaluation of alchemy following the then prevailing philosophical and theological conceptions. Reasons for the abse nce or presence of pictorial forms is best evaluated with resp ect to contemporary criteria of scientificity and forms of conveying knowledge, and to the corresponding epistemological issues. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 2. Alchemy as scientia naturali s and ars : the analogical ar gument and visualization In Arabic classifications of science and philosophy, which were adapted in the twelfth century, alchemy was defined as a sub- branch of natural philosophy ( scientia naturalis ), sharing this definition, above all, with medici ne. Thus, about ten years after the first translation of an alchemical text into Latin (Morienus, De compositione alchimie ), Dominic Gundissalinus described alchemy as belonging to physics in his De divisione philosophiae (ca. 1150).[6] It was a science and an ar t aimed at the transformation of species.[7] Subsequently, by the mid-thirteenth century, Aristotelian philosophy of nature had become the framework for all physical studies in medieval universities. And, since at that time the general attitude was rather favorable toward the teknai , discussions of the artificial production of metals a nd other mineral substances took place in the context of the study of Aristotle’s Meteorologica . Together with its frequently unacknowledged Avicennian appendix on the formation of metals and minerals (also transmitted under the title De congelatione et conglutinatione lapidum ),[8] the Meteorologica served, from 1200 onward, as a theoretical basis for the alchemist’s manipulation of substances. In order to integrate alchemy into generally accepted theories of scientianaturalis (or physica ), use was made of an analogical argument, analogy being understood in the sense of a principle of scientific explanation where, as Shmuel Sambursky put it, \"one phenomenon is explained in terms of the functioning of another we are acquainted with or have got used to\".[9] The argument links three levels: the level of general cosmologic theories, the level of"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 particular areas and substances, and the level of art imitating macrocosmic processes.[10] (1) The overall cosmological level was cast in Aristotelian categories of qualitative physics and its neo-Platonic elaborations.[11] Aristotle explained change in the sub-lunar, corporeal part of the world in terms of the cyclical association and dissociation of two pairs of opposites, the cold and the hot, the wet and the dry. From this process result the elemental consti tuents of fire, air, water, and earth. The annual local movement of the sun is the cause of the continuous change of one element into another and of all natural cycles of generation and corruption.[12] As to the neo-Platonic philosophical tradition in its Western form, it allowed, above all, to introduce the sphere of the divine; in its diverse Arabic elaborations, it helped account for a more diversified celestial influence made in terms of astrol ogy and of celestial virtues. (2) The general theory of the na tural formation of subterranean substances was based on Aristotle’s final part of the third book of the Meteorologica where the Philosopher puts forward that metals are formed from compressed humid exhalations, and on the fourth book where the active, formative prin ciple of metals is said to be the cold.[13] The more specific theo ry of the generation of metals in terms of their basic material a nd formal constituents, namely quicksilver and sulphur, wa s set out in Avicenna’s De congelatione et conglutinatione lapidum . Here, the active, formative principle was supposed to be heat, the duration and intensity of coction being responsible for the differentiation among metals. (3) The relation between nature and art was conceived in Aristotelian terms of mimesis : art imitates and completes but never replaces nature. The idea of the inferiority of art ( ars ) was"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 intrinsically linked to the conception of nature as an organic whole and of nature as an intelligent artisa n. As an artisan, nature induces movement internally, thereby producing essential change, namely generation. By imitating nature, the human artist merely brings about external, ‘mechanical’ change while the substance remains identical.[14] In principle, the Aristotelian physical system prevailed in medieval natural philosophy. Nevertheless, Platonic and neo-Platonic philosophical positions were adopted by major thirteenth-century philosophers, and alchemical texts usually combine these differing philosophical traditions. In the Aristotelian physical tradition, analogies function in relation to identical causal schemes; either nature or the human artisan induces movement in the sense of qualitative change.[15] Thus Aristotle explained the formation of the foetus by analogical inference from the art of cooking: it is a kind of coction due to the action of heat deriving from sperm.[16] Adopting the Aristotelian scientific method, Albert the Gr eat (d. 1280) gave, in his mid- thirteenth-century Mineralogy , an account of the natural formation of metals and minerals by an alogy from the cooking of the alchemists – in his estimation the best imitators of nature – and from current scholastic medical theories on the formation of the foetus.[17] Those major thirteenth and fourteenth-century alchemical texts that were concerned with establishing a physical theory – in the sense of scientia naturalis –, or at least with transmitting it, reversed the analogical relation: alchemical theory and practice were based on the model of natu ral macrocosmic and microcosmic processes. Artificial generation of metals and minerals was, among"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 others, explained with reference to the biological model of animal (human) generation. In these, the rhetorical use of similes for the purpose of either clarifying and illu strating abstract principles or for avoiding to name certain substa nces and procedures are absent or at the best very limited. As pointed out by Albert the Great with respect to those alchemical writings which do not conform to the scholastic Aristotelian concept of science, they conceal their meaning in metaphorical language, \"which has never been the custom in philosophy\".[18] In Platonic and neo-Platonic theories of knowledge, the analogical argument hinges on the assumption of an essential link between the intelligible model and its visible c opy, between intelligible realities and mental constructs. The cor poreal world is thought of as a visible (and tangible) manifestation of intelligible mathematical patterns and in particular of the spherical form, the most perfect one. Due to the divine part of his mind, the human artist is able to apprehend and to reproduce thes e patterns.[19] The divine – divinity and the cosmos in its divi ne dimension – and things of great spirituality were thought of as being beyond comprehension and as being conceivable only with the help of corporeal similes. Thus, in both the Platonic and neo-Platonic medieval philosophical traditions, similes – verbal or pict orial – were considered essential to help conceive and to represent first principles. Pictorial forms occur in Aristote lian and in Platonically or neo- Platonically oriented thirteenth-century and subsequent discussions of the natural formation and artificial production of metals. However, while figures were rarely used in the context of Aristotelian natural philosophy, thi ngs were different with Platonic cosmology. Here their function was intrinsically linked to the physical system, since Plato had c onceived of the elementary parts"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 of the world in terms of geometrical configurations. In thirteenth-century Aristotelian natural philosophy are to be found some instances of the use of geometrical figures. Yet, just as Aristotle himself did not make frequent use of geometrical demonstration, his medieval followers never developed it into a widely used method of proof in either medieval Aristotelian natural philosophy or alchemy. As far as th e classification of sciences goes, Albert the Great, for instance, rejected Plato’s subordination of physics to mathematics and to divine realities: the physicist may prove things geometrically, but by doing so he merely establishes the fact ( quia ), not the reason for the fact ( propter quid ).[20] In order to conceive of the natural formation of metals and also to explain it, Albert the Great himsel f made use of two figures in his Mineralogy (1250-1252),[21] the one work that established a theory of mineral and metal formation then deemed worthy of Aristotle. Both occur in a context of analogical inference from the visible procedures of human art to the in visible workings of nature. Being the best imitators of nature, al chemists construe vessels which reduplicate natural conditions under which metals are generated (Figure 3):[22] When they [the alchemists] wish to make the elixir which is to have the color and tincture of gold, first they take a lower vessel big enough to hold the materials of well-purified sulphur and quicksilver or other things which they put into the elixir. Next they arrange it so that on the top of this there may be a vessel having a long, narrow neck; and over the opening of this neck is a cover of clay in which is a very small, narrow opening [¼ ] The better operators make the vessels of glass; and the character of the first vessel is like a urinal, and the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 second stands on top of it and receives all the vapour which rises from it.

The creation of metals. Albert used another geometrical figure marked by letters when setting forth his theory of metal formation in different places in the ground, porous or non-porous. Acco rding to Albert, vapor mixed with earthy parts penetrates into the pores of the earth before solidifying into a metal, which he exemplifies by pouring liquid metal onto the ground. He then gives instructions for drawing a circle a b c which is to represent the metal spread on the ground; two lines, c d and a g , represent the way the metal penetrates into the earth, namely through veins. This type of geometrical demonstration follows Aristotle’s method for proving the sphericity of the elemental layers of the world.[23] In the thirteenth century, representatives of Platonically-oriented cosmology and natural science such as Robert Grosseteste (1175- 1253) defended a systematic use of geometrical representation. Following Grosseteste, \"all caus es of natural effects must be expressed by means of lines, angles, and figures, for otherwise it is impossible to grasp their explanation\".[24] The corresponding theory of knowledge was neo-Platonic and Augustinian. The intelligible order underlying the physical, corporeal world was thought to be apprehensible by the divine part of the soul, by the ‘eye of the soul’, and geometri cal figures (as well as number patterns) were used as ‘ladders’ leading to eternal truths. In this respect, John Scottus Eriugena’s ninth-century Periphyseon exercised considerable influence on thirteenth-century philosophers such as, above all, Ramon Lull (about 1232-1315) and"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 on the authors of the pseudo-Lullian fourteenth-century alchemical corpus. In order to explain first causes and their progression into multiplicity, the teacher of Eri ugena’s dialogue makes use of a \"visible and corporeal figure\", namely of a circle with lines radiating from its centre to the circumfe rence. Learning \"outwardly by sense\" and apprehending on geom etrical grounds is being both opposed and paralleled with \"understanding inwardly, by imagination\". In one way or anot her, geometrical figures were mental constructs made for the purpose of meditation and contemplation, but without being in a mimetic relation to anything.[25] Thus, adopting this kind of theory of knowledge did not necessarily imply that of Platonic cosmology with its geometric elementary shapes, which do reflect pre-existing patterns. From the thirteenth century on, the comb ination of Aristotelian physical principles with neo-Platonic epistemology was quite common in alchemical texts. But only very fe w instances are to be found where geometrical figures are used in terms of the Timaean theory of elementary shapes.[26] In alchemy, the earliest so-far known Western document to use pictorial forms in a neo-Platoni cally oriented epistemological context is the Book of the Secrets of Alchemy compiled in 1257 by a student of medicine, Constantin e of Pisa.[27] The corresponding theory of knowledge is set forth in a few topoi . Concerning the etymology of the letter ‘L’, th e author notes: \"According to etymology, it [‘L’] is so called from lucidando and from illuminando ; illuminando, i.e. making clear that which is obscure, and throwing a greater light on that which is intelligible [¼ ] for the intellect is the eye of the mind\".[28] Being \"beyond understanding\", God and his eternity can be grasped neither \"by reason nor by working\".[29] Essentially a set of lecture notes , this document gives precious"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 insight into current mid-thirteenth discussion on natural formation of metals and it sheds light on the effort to deal both verbally and pictorially with alchemy as a novel discipline. On the level of cosmology, it juxtaposes the physical theory of Aristotle’s Meteorology and its Avicennian prolongation with Platonic and neo- Platonic traditions. More specifically, Constantine – or rather his unknown teacher – tried to provide alchemy with not only a physical but also a theological basis. The overall cosmological model is still that of the Biblical creation in its Platonically oriented twelfth- century interpretation. In order to achieve this particular goal, use was made of an analogical argument and of corresponding figures, above all, of what may be ca lled the ‘creation diagram’. With respect to the creation of metals, the argument is that God brought forth the six metals within the six days of creation by differentiating homeomerous bodies.[30] The corresponding diagram is composed of a vertically laid-out sequence of seven circle segments bearing the na mes of the planets and their corresponding metals. At the bottom the series is terminated by segments with inscriptions naming earth, air, and the Dead Sea (Figure 4). In a Flemish fourteenth-century versified adaptation of this document ( The Book of the Secrets of My Lady Alchemy ), the ‘creation diagram’ has been considerably developed through additions and modifications. At the top is added a circle enclosing the hand of the creator; below, personifications (heads) of the planets and of the earth; and the ci rcle segments that refer to the sublunary world contain birds, land- animals, fish and a mask as the origin of waters. In both instan ces, the arrangement of semi- circular and circular segments of the diagrammatic structure is determined by the hexaemeral leitmotif \" In principio creavit Deus celum et terram \".

Following this, the motif of the Platonic Biblical Divine Artisan, who brings order into previously create d matter, is interpreted in terms of alchemical operation and the sepa ration of the four elements out of chaos, which serves as an analogous model for the solidification of quicksilver brought about by the alchemist.

And just as it is told of the Spirit of the Lord moving upon the waters as the first cause, so this work consists of twelve waters [¼ ]. In the Book of the Secrets of Alchemy , astrology plays a major role in helping understand alchemy as a science and also in guiding its operations. The corresponding tables serve as a tool for causally relating heavenly phenomena to natu ral generation and to artificial transformation of metals; they also help establish analogical relations between the visible and the invisible. As is the case with the other figures of this text, their specific function is made explicit. A first set of astrological tables depict the physical theory in its astrological extension according to which not only the sun but also the other planets cause generati on in the sub-lunar realm. The respective tables are announced t hus: \"It is necessary to know the order of the planets with respect to homomereous things, i.e. metals, as given in this table [¼ ]. \"[33] \"In order, therefore, to gain knowledge of the science, one must understand the motion of the upper bodies with respect to homom ereous bodies by means of this table, called the House of the planets, as they are in their signs\"[34] (Figure 6)."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 Figure 6: Wien, Österreichische Na tionalbibliothek, ms. 2372, fol. 35r (second half of the fourteenth century).

Both the ‘creation diagram’ and astrologi cal charts are construed on the principle of visual substitution: ol der pictorial forms are altered to express theories of the formation and transformation of metals, as well as to give instruction for the alchemist’s operations. Astrological tables traditionally used in a medical context for listing the moon-microcosm correspondences have become invested with the names of metals. Likewise, in the ‘creation diagram’ references to stellar causality and metals are inserted into the combined pictorial schemes of Genesis illustrations and of the elementary and stellar orbits that have been reduced to segments spread out in a row.[37] In the vernacular four teenth-century version of the Book of the Secrets of Alchemy ( The Book of My Lady Alchemy ) , figurative elements such as the ha nd of God and personifications of planets are added to the basic structure of circle segments.

The observation of accidental qualities : visualization and metaphor Albert the Great’s and Constantine’s treatises represent the few thirteenth-century documents to include figures visualizing conceptual schemes relating to the natural formation and to the divine creation of metals. Subse quently, within the all-pervasive system of Aristotelian natural philosophy, emphasis was laid on observable accidental qualities. However, despite the recurrent urge to view the characteristics and behavior of substances, the transition to their pictorial representation took place merely in alchemical documents dating from th e second half of the fourteenth century. Moreover, these observable characteristics and stages of transformation were visualized by transposition of verbal metaphors onto the pictorial level, ‘metaphor’ being understood in its classical Quintilian definition as alieniloquium . Thus, although the conceptual basis for putting observational data to the fore was thoroughly Aristotelian, visualizati on of these by way of metaphors did not agree with the standards of the scholastic scientific method and its syllogistically conduced ar guments. It should be noted that not only authors and compilers of derivative literary products favored the use of similes for comparison and for didactic purposes, but that in the 1330s even a scholastically trained theoretician like Petrus Bonus justified and re commended the use metaphorical language in alchemical writings.[38] The scholastic Aristotelian method adopted by all major alchemical treatises from the mid-thirteenth century on was that of combined deduction from general principles and induction based on sense data, that is, on the observation of accidental qualities of substances. In metals, these were, in Albert the Great’s words, \"their being liquefiable and malleab le, their colors, tastes and odors"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 and their ability to be consumed by fire\".[39] In his Mineralogy , Albert explains that[40] When dealing with many particulars we must first understand the natures from the signs and effects [observed] [ ex signis et effectibus ] and proceed from these signs to their causes and compositions; for the end effect s are more obvious to us. But in dealing with the nature of universals [¼ ] we have to proceed in the opposite way, [reasoning] from the cause to the effects and powers and signs. Examples from the Mineralogy for reasoning in terms of experience and signs are:[41] The production of metals is cyclical, from each other. Experience shows that this is the case [ probat autem hoc experta ], both in the operations of nature and in the techniques of art. As to natural processes, I have learned, by what I have seen with my own eyes [ visu proprio didici ], that a vein flowing from a single source was in one part pure gold, and in another silver having a stony calx mixed with it [¼ ]. Elsewhere, Albert states that[42] iron is subject to rust, the cause of this being that it contains burnt earth; for what putrefaction is to moist things, rust is to iron. For when the moisture is removed, what is left behind is parched, dry, and burnt, and is reduced to ashes. Evidence [ signum ] of this is that iron is espe cially affected by rust if something burning is thrown upon it – such as salt, sulphur orpiment, and the like. Albert’s Mineralogy set the standards for a rich tradition of alchemical writings in which expressions such as ‘to see with one’s"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 own eyes’, ‘observation’, ‘signs’, ‘experimental evidence’ and ‘experience’ were extensively used.[43] On a theoretical level, reference to observational data, experimenta , helped confirm previously reached conclusions. The main document of this tradition was alternately entitled Semita recta and De alchimia . In this widely read and often varied-upon pseudo-Albertian treatise, the expression ‘I have seen’ ( vidi ) is systematically used in theoreti cal discussions, as the following instances illustrate.[44] We see different species receiv e different forms at different times; this is evident by decoction, and constant contact: what is red in arsenic will become bl ack and then will become white by sublimation [¼ ] If, by any chance, someone should say that such species can easily be transm uted from color to color, but that in metals it is impossible, I will reply by citing the evident cause through evident indications and proofs [¼ ] For we see that azure [¼ ] is produced from silver [¼ ] We see, furthermore, that copper receives a yellow color from calamine stone [¼ ]. Alchemical treatises that adopted the Aristotelian scientific method all agree that observation leads no where unless it be guided by the knowledge of principles, divine or natural. The pseudo-Lullian fourteenth-century Codicillus , for instance, asserts that[45] The art is nothing unless the artisan starts out with certain and determinate principles; and he must regulate himself on demonstrative signs, namely th e colors which appear in the process of working. Roger Bacon’s theory of experi mental science also exercised"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 considerable influence on alchemical texts, especially on the fourteenth-century pseudo-Lullian alchemical corpus where one finds expressions, such as \" sicut ostendit ratio naturalis et experientia nobis certificat \", as has recently been shown by Michela Pereira.[46] Given the impact of this scientific tradition the main points of Bacon’s theory may be recalled in his own words.[47] There are two modes of acquiring knowledge, namely, by reasoning and experience. Reasoning draws a conclusion and makes us grant the conclusion but does not make the conclusion certain [¼ ]. Bacon exemplifies his assertion that \"authors write many statements and people believe them through reasoning which they formulate without experience\" with a reference to the belief that diamonds cannot be broken except by goat’s blood: But fracture by means of blood of this kind has never been verified [¼ ] and without that blood it can be broken easily. For I have seen this with my own eyes, and this is necessary, because gems cannot be carved except by fragments of this stone [¼ ] Therefore, all th ings must be verified by experience. On the level of alchemical operation which were exposed in sections concerned with practica , the main accidental qualities of substances to be observed were colors. Their appearance and disappearance increasingly helped mark stages of transformation and the number four was to become canonical in fourteenth- century alchemical texts such as the pseudo-Lullian Codicillus .[48] In a Rosarius attributed to John Dastin (f irst half of the fourteenth century), the author writes:[49]"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 There are four principal colors: bl ack, white, yellow, and red [¼ ] Colors will then teach you how to handle fire, for they show how long and when the first, the second, and the third fire are to be made.

Here it is stressed that the alchem ical process is to be performed entirely in one vessel of thick herm etically sealed glass so that the operator may observe the changes.[50] In alchemical treatises where schol astic Aristotelian principles of natural philosophy prevailed, the fi rst step toward visualization was made in relation to instructions for construing apparatus, furnaces, and vessels. These are given in thos e sections of thirteenth-century treatises that are concerned with practica , with instructions for operating and recipes. Frequently the practica is preceded by a theorica , but practical instructions alone were also circulated. The major alchemical document of the thirteenth-century scholastic Aristotelian alchemical literature, the Summa perfectionis magisterii of (pseudo)-Geber,[ 51] systematically describes apparatus used in diverse alchemical operations ( sublimation, descension, distillation, calcination, solving, coagulation, fixation, ceration ). However, the text does not yet refer to figures. In the ol dest manuscripts of the Summa , these are drawn in the margins, as is the case with the late thirteenth-century copy bearing the title Summa collectionis complementi occulte secretorum nature (Bibliothèque nationale de France ms. lat. 6514, fol. 68r-71r).

The author of this text without title identifies himself as Gratheus.[59] He was obviously a craftsman and aimed at a popular public without knowledge of Latin.[60] The abse nce of philosophic discussion of transmutation is counter-balanced by a theme that should become increasingly important toward the end of the Middle Ages and in the sixteenth-century: bookish learning and textual parables lead to errors.[61] In order to avoid th ese, Gratheus recommends reading the book of heaven, a \"manif est mirror and examplar of alchemy\".[62] There, one may perceive with one’s own eyes the whole work of alchemy and all ty pes of vessels.[63] This argument applies and old exegetical topos to alchemy. As pointed out by Augustine, the book of nature ma y be read even by the illiterate ( idiota ). Emphasis is laid on technical aspect s of the work, the fabrication of vessels appropriate for different op erations and of apparatus such as an oil press made of steel ( stal ) and wood.[64] In the first part of the treatise a wide range of differing vessels are described and depicted. Instructions for their fabrication are interspersed with recipes. Artificially created names for vessels ( bima , alpha , fumera , etc. ) clearly have a mnemonic function, and the same applies to stars and their unusual depictions (some hundred and fifty stars are provided with faces), which play a major role in the text.

Primus puer , the first offspring from Ylarius and Virgo. Gratheus’ text emerged as a majo r – and possibly first – document testifying to the transformation of analogical relations, particularly between animal generation and the formation of metals, into metaphors. Both linguistic and pi ctorial metaphors were used for comparison, persuasion, and the conveying of knowledge in the most efficient manner. Analogical relations disappeared together with the corresponding philosophical context and their terms were no longer made explicit. Depicted within glass vessels, the principal metaphorical motif became the union of opposite principles, male and female, in the form of a queen and a king and their subsequent procreation. The purpose of this derivative type of literature was not the elaboration of theories and knowledge, but the transmission of theoretical principles, which were progressively reduced to ‘sayings of philosophers’, of principles relating to practica , and of recipes. In order to make sure that these were understood and memorized, authors such as Gratheus condensed them into striking phrases. Rhyme, an artificial and apparently arbitrary nomenclature, and personificati ons behaving in the most extravagant manner, were employ ed as mnemonic devices.[73] Corresponding pictures punctuated crucial points and, as if this were not sufficient, Gratheus fre quently made verbal statements concerning their presence and invi ted the reader (or the audience) to look at them. This type of document does not develop philosophical arguments in order to demonstrate the veracity of alchemy. Instead, striking pictorial forms reinforce the pers uasiveness of the written word, itself centerd on rhetorical effect iveness. Moreover, in order to ground pictorial representations in the order of natural (and divine)"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33 things and to distinguish them from arbitrary linguistic signs, Gratheus resorted to the ficti on of their heavenly appearance. Obvious to everyone, on the firm ament there are not only objects to be copied by human art in drawings and fabrication, but also visible forms relating to Christ as both a human and a god, namely the cross, the Holy Sepulcher, and th e judge of the Last Day.[74] Of these christological motifs, only that of Christ’s haloed head surrounded by glass vessels and that of the holy grave (Figure 14) are pictorially represented. The early fifteenth-century Aurora consurgens marks a further step in the elaboration of pictorial metaphors combined with glass vessels. The oldest and most spectacular copy of this document dates from the 1420s (Zürich, Zentralbibliothek, ms. Rh. 172). On a purely pictorial level, an inventiv e and high-quality artist developed a core of recurrent alchemical me taphors that relate to human and animal procreation, the dismem berment of bodies (symbolizing calcinations and putrefaction) and motifs such as the eagle and the dragon, which denote mercury as a volatile and as a solidified substance, respectively.[75] In and around glass vessels, the artist metaphorically depicted stages of operation relating to the alchemical art of transformati on as well as cosmological and philosophical principles of the ar t, such as \"two are one\" and \"nature vanquishes nature\". Two or more principal metaphors are frequently combined within a single picture, reflecting the increasing use of chains of me taphors. For instance, one of the illustration combines the motifs of Mercury decapitating the sun and the moon with a vase filled with silver and gold flowers (Figure 11)."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 34 Figure 11: Zürich, Zentralbibliothek, ms.

The thirty-seven illustrations of the Aurora consurgens provide a wide range of comparisons taken from nature, whereas practical considerations are pushed into the background. This shift might be explained by the intended readership, since the richly illuminated text was clearly addressed to a milieu of princely patrons.[76] However, these patrons were not me rely interested in aesthetic and poetic contemplation but also in personally exercising the art of alchemy, as apparently were the margrave of Brandenburg and Barbara of Cilli, the wife of th e emperor Sigismund to whom the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 author of the Book of the Holy Trinity offered his services during the Council of Constance.[77] The Aurora Consurgens is also an important testimony to another late medieval pictorial evolution, namely that of synthetic representations of the principles governing alchemy. The document transposes onto the pictorial level an ekphrasis in all probability of late antique origin, which has been transmitted to the West by a treatise of Ibn Umail, the Tabula chemica (tenth century).[78] This description of wall paintings of a subterranean chamber in a pyramid is combined with that of the purportedly hieroglyphic signs carved into a marble (or emerald) slab resting on the knees of the statue of Hermes, the mythical founder of alchemy.[79] Then follows the interpretation of the pictograms. Two birds holding one another and appearing like a circle symbolize the topos of ‘two in one’; these birds also take on the form of one of the oldest metaphorical designation for a cosmic principle of unity, namely the dragon biting its tail. Further, the unification of the opposite principles female/male, passive/active, cold/hot, moist/dry finds expression in the coupling of the sun and the moon, a cosmologic motif of central importance since it symbolizes the generation of all things (Figure 12)."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 Figure 12: Pandora, das ist die edelste Gab Gottes , (Anonymous, 1582, p. 241).

It is associated with the symbols of the sun, moon, mercury, and sulphur.[80] According to the narrative of the Tabula chemica , the pictures that had been hidden in a pyramid were not only discovered and described but also copied. Thus, the author guaranteed the integrity and truthfulness of the learning deposited by Hermes himself.[81] It may be stated that the Aurora consurgens gives a first forceful visual expression of a myth that should become a major theme in the Renaissance period, i.e. the myth of the recovery of original knowledge and its methods of deciphering and interpretation. Indeed, the pictoria l representation of the discovery of Hermes and his testament dates from the very period of the 1419 recovery of the late antique Hieroglyphica by Horapollo. Regarded as the script of divine order, vi sual hieroglyphic expression became a guarantee for the preservation of original knowledge and of its faultless transmission. Deformatio n by arbitrary human (verbal) interpretation could not affect the veracity of divinely instituted pictorial signs. Subsequently, the principal pictorial forms of the Aurora consurgens were divided into many branches, but the chronology of this evolution is yet to be esta blished. Major documents of these are a Rosarius printed in Francfurt in 1550 and its variants, sometimes bearing the title Donum dei .[82] The adaptors maintained that everything depicted has previously been observed, including the appearance of the dragon, thus suggesting a strong relation between observation, truthf ul imagination, and pictorial representation (Figure 13).[83] On the pictorial as well as on the verbal level, a limited number of topoi were subject to continuously varying combinations.

Now, on th e metaphorical level, colors were associated with specific shapes of the ingredients, which were described and depicted in the form of allegorised protagonists.

Spiritual Fransciscans, alchemy, and visualization The first part of the early fifteenth-century Aurora Consurgens interprets the Old Testament in terms of alchemical operation; but, except the figure of Solomon,[84] there are no corresponding pictorial motifs. The aforementioned late fourteenth-century treatise by Gratheus appears to be among the oldest known alchemical documents that include religious pictorial motifs. However, these are exclusively of a christological character: the head of Christ surrounded by a ring of vessels[85] and the resurrection of Christ (Figure 14). Following Gratheus, the tomb of Christ appears on the firmament in the form of a constellation. Here, the cosmic exemplar functions not only as a general model for operation, but also as a didactic exemplum . The repeated use of the term ‘ exemplum ’ by the author clearly indicates a fusion between these levels.[86] Figure 14: Wien, Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, cod. Vind. 2372, fol. 57va (second half of the fourteenth century) (Birkhan 1992, vol. II, p. 54). Gratheus, Introduction to Alchemy . The resurrection of Christ as an exam ple for the process of sublimation."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40 The origins of textual and subsequent pictorial christological motifs in alchemical texts point back, once again, to the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. Here too, in its original doctrinal context, the relation between alchemical theory and operation, on the one hand, and the overall cosmological model, on the other, was one of analogy: the figure of Christ served as a prototype for the relations between the realm of na ture and the realm of the supra- natural, the celestial and the earthly, the divine and the human. Afterwards, the earthly life of Christ should become a particularly welcome illustration of diverse operations with the metals. As pointed out by Gratheus, the \" experimenta iudeorum are exempla \" for the treatment of mercury, which has to be \"captured, tortured, beaten and deprived of its soul\".[87] In the thirteenth-century doctrinal context, Aristotelian natural philosophy was, as a rule, not supposed to deal with revealed, supra-natural truths, such as Crea tion, the Trinity, Christology, the sacraments, or the end of the world. Instead, these were the subject matter of theology.[88] With very few exceptions – Constantine’s On the secrets of alchemy being a point in case – Western alchemical texts written in the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries conform to that rule. Differing, anti-scholastic views were put forth in circles of Franciscan spirituals, such as Ar nald of Villanova (1240-1311) and John of Rupescissa (d. after 1356). Alchemical documents belonging to this orientation related supra-natural phenomena to the realm of nature and declared ar tificial transformations achieved by alchemist as being natural to a certain point. Beyond this, namely on the level of substantial transformation, they considered changes miraculous and therefor e not apprehensible by rational scientific investigation but only by experiment and illumination.[89]"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 As a consequence, explicit para llels were established between alchemical transmutation and the Eucharistic transformation. The development of the pharmaceut ical branch of alchemy was a major factor for adopting a cosmological model that combined the realms of nature and the supra-natu ral. This branch specialized in the preservation of the human body and the prolongation of life[90] due to a major innovation, namely the distilling of alcohol.[91] Alcohol ( aqua ardens, quinta essentia , aqua vita ) was considered incorruptible and rendering the human body unalterable. In his authoritative mid-fourteenth-century treatise on distillation, John of Rupescissa argued that this substance could not be explained in terms of the association and dissociation of elementary qualities (cold/hot, dry/moist). He further promised to demonstrate experimentally ( demonstrabo ex experimenta assumpta ) how a bird, a fish, or a piece of meat once immersed in this liquid is no longer subject to decay.[92] Rupescissa tried to account for the presence of something unalterable within nature by analogy with the Aristotelian first (fifth) essence. [93] However, this theoretical effort proved to be insufficient due to an essential feature of Aristotelian cosmology, namely its strict division between the divine, heavenly and the infra-luna r spheres. As a consequence, the mediator-figure of Christ became the center of a complementary explanatory model. The distinctive doctrinal features of the corresponding alchemical literature were derived from the theology of the Catalan physician Arnald of Villanova.[94] Briefly out lined, the Arnaldian views, which served as a basis for major developm ents of late medieval trends in alchemy, are the following. Being the exemplum of all things, Christ is the supreme physician ( Summusmedicus ), while the human physician acts as God’s instrument[95] ( Ecclesiasticus 38. 1-11).[96]"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 42 In turn, in their conforming to Christ’s life, the \"little ones of Christ\" ( parvuli Christi ) become exempla of evangelic perfection[97] and, as the last times approach, they help regenerate nature and man both on the corporeal and spiritua l level. Their knowledge is acquired by revelation or experiment ( revelatione vel experimento ),[98] by way of signs in nature and in the Holy Scripture.[99] In his Parabolae medicae , Arnald made use of the exegetical method of distinguishing between the literal and the spiritual meaning. Parables, similes, and examples of visible things refer to invisible spiritual entities. In this respect, Arnaldus was particularly fond of the Wisdom of Salomon.[100] This hermeneutic principle was adopted in late medieval alchemical textual and pictorial documents, where Biblical texts were systematically interpreted in terms of alchemical work. The introductory words of the Tractatus parabolicus – the main pseudo-Arnaldian text that served as a source for writings and for illustrations referring to the incarnation, the passion, and the resurrection of Christ – quite clearly sets the tone:[101] This art [alchemy] may be comprehended through His coming [¼ ] for He is the example of a ll things. And our elixir may be understood according to the conception and generation and nativity and passion of Christ, and be compared to the predictions of the prophets [¼ ] And on earth he suffered passion and underwent resurrection, and he visibly ascended from earth to heaven where he rested [¼ ]. Do understand how to deal with mercury following the example of Christ. Christ had suffered four passi ons, and so does mercury. Among others, mercury had to be put into to a coffin and it had to stay there just as Christ did, and so on."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 43 Regarding the passion of Christ, the Tractatus parabolicus is a perfect example of the late medieval tendency to describe Christ’s earthly sufferings in the crudest possible way and to exhibit them for viewing in paintings and in sc ulpture. Moreover, the story of Christ was amalgamated with metaphors taken from human procreation. The operating alchemist had to follow instructions such as:[102] Take the pure mother, put it to bed with her son, then subject them to the strictest penitence until they are cleansed from their sins. Then the son will be captured, flagellated, and turned over to the Jews. The son is put back to bed, captured again, and crucified. The sun and the moon will then be darkened. Then the resurrecti on of the Son will soon take place and you will have to increase the fire. The Franciscan spiritual movements with their distinctly eschatological outlook conferred a particular social dignity to alchemy: the products of alchemical transformation helped poor and pure Franciscans to fight the impious.[103] This tradition culminated in The Book of the Holy Trinity where means provided by alchemy were offered to help establish the reign of a last emperor. In this document from the period of the Council of Constance, which was dedicated to Frederic, margrave of Brandenburg, in 1419,[104] pictorial motifs relating to political views, theological doctrines, and alchemical transformation of metals were all combined and fused into a single iconographical program.[105] Diverse tortures inflicted on Christ, which had first been described in pseudo-Arnaldian texts and by Gratheus, were now depicted. Christ is shown as a tortured human – mercury – as well as the resurrected god – gold. "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44 5. Geometrical figures as cognitive tools : the Lullian alchemical corpus The pseudo-Lullian corpus of alchem ical writings represent a major late-medieval instance of visualizat ion in so far as figures are no longer a posteriori additions, but the very basis of the doctrinal system as well as instruments for organizing its elements, ranging from the most abstract principles to ingredients for recipes. The Catalan philosopher and theologian Ramon Lull (about 1232-1315) made use of figures in the cont ext of neo-Platonic emanantism. Progression from the divine principle down to matter and retrogression from matter up to divinity are graphically represented by way of geometrical figures, above all the circle, together with letters of the al phabet.[106] Lull had intended his Ars generalis to be applicable to all sciences; he himself applied it only to astrology and medicine.[107] In the first half of the fourt eenth century, followers of Lull formulated alchemical theory a nd practice along the lines of his categories. Michela Pereira, to whom we owe the groundbreaking work in the field of pseudo-Lullian alchemy, has identified as a main document the Testamentum (ca. 1330-32).[108] She has also reproduced the corresponding figures in drawings, thus laying the ground for further analysis. Since it is impossible to convey an accurate idea of the multiple f unctions that these figures fulfil within the highly formalized system of pseudo-Lullian alchemy, the following is merely a note intended to draw further attention to this corpus.[109] Following a by then well-established tradition, (pseudo)-Lullian alchemy combined neo-Platonic theories of knowledge with tenets of Aristotelian natural philosophy and scientific method. For"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 instance, the unknown author of the Codicillus pointed out that for apprehending intelligible principles the alchemist must use the eyes of his soul, whereas in relation to signs, i.e . the qualities of the means and of the extremes, he has to take his senses for a guide. In this corpus, neo-Platonic emanantism also appears on the cosmological level, divinity being the beginning and the end of all things. Three principles underlie the physical world: an artificial one, God the creator; an exemplary principle, wisdom; and created matter.[110] Regarding the functioni ng of the world, the Aristotelian theory of contraries became a cent ral explanatory device and a rule for operating. On the level of general physical principles, hot and cold combined through the medium of dry and moist; on the level of the theory of the formation of metals, the two extremes of quicksilver and sulphur were linked with each other by the chain of intermediate metallic bodies. These means were gradually transformed into extremes either naturally or artificially. In the corpus of pseudo-Lullian alchemy, the entire body of cosmological, physical, and operationa l theories were cast into the form of tables, circular diagrams , and geometric figures, such as the square, the triangle, and letter symbolism. Typically, the basic figure of the pseudo-Lullian alchemical ars , the circle, symbolized perfection in a neo-Platonic doctrinal context, just as it stood for the Aristotelian concept of the cyc lical transformation of the four elements, which in turn determined the natural and artificial transformation of metals. Combined with geometrical configurations, the letters of the alphabet allowed the alchemist to perceive infra-cosmic relations in an evident way and to know how to perform corresponding operations. Nature rotated the world and its elementary parts,[111] and the alchemist faithfully imitated her:[112] figures both visualized natural mechanisms and indicated how the operator had to proceed ( figura sequens ostendit quomodo"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46 [113]) (Figure 15).

"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 47 6. Conclusion The diversity of pictorial forms in major documents of medieval alchemy sheds significant light on the discipline itself. Indeed, alchemy was unique in continually adopting various cosmological models and philosophical theories for justifying artificial transformation of substances and in abandoning them again as quickly. Theory and practice, especially in its innovative aspect, never complemented one another for any length of time. Only toward the end of the Middle Ages, a somewhat codified pictorial tradition emerged out of very diverse tendencies in visualization. It had an impact that went beyond restricted circles of alchemis ts, which was in part due to printing, and it consisted of pictorial metaphors associated with glass vessels. These metaphors related to observable accident al qualities of substances, to their effects, to stages of transformation, and also to philosophical principles governing the discipline. The principal theme of these pictorial (and corresponding textual) metaphors wa s human procreation. Its underlying biological model, which had once been used for analogical inference to mechanisms of the natural and artificial formation of metals and minerals, was no longer made explicit. However, literary documents with this type of visual forms increasingly divorced from practice. The second major tendency in late medieval alchemical imagery consisted in presenting synthetic tables of the theo retical principles that governed the discipline. Here, pictorial units were combined with corresponding doxographic verbal units. These tables were intende d to convey the essence of the art, based on the the idea that, unlike the arbitrariness of linguistic signs, pictorial forms can preserve original knowledge. The third category of late medieval alchemical documents where pictorial forms played a central role was pseudo-Lullian alchemy. Unlike the didactically oriented documents, they continued to carry the body of scholastic Aristotelian natural philosophy along with tenets of the neo-Platonic philosophical tradition regarding the cognitive function of visual figures. Ultimately, however, the bulk of practice oriented alchemical writings, which tended to be centred on distillation, was devoid of pictorial forms other than those of apparatus."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48 Notes [1] The supposedly first translation of an alchemical work is Morienus 1974.
