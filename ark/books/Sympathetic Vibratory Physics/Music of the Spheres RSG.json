Amid the busy hum of life, let us pause awhile to note t he grand har mony of nature's choir; the deep anthem of the mighty ocean, t he s oft whis peri ngs of the leaves on the trees , or the plaintive rustle of the dead leaves at our feet. Listen to the joyful carol of the bir ds , the ri pple of the waves , the thunder of the tempes t, a nd the ves per hymn of the eve ni ng br e eze, and do we not ex- claim wit h Watts : “ S t ran ge! th at a ha rp of a thou s a nd stri ngs, Shoul d kee p so lo ng i n tune .\" With regard to the mus i c of the s pher e s, Pythagoras , and s om e of his e ar lies t disciples , taught that the stars a nd planets, during their r e volut ions , om itted m us ical s ounds of va r ious intensities , acc or ding t o their distanc es f rom the earth, all of w hi c h, however, were s upposed to be inaudible to men. The f ollowing is the acc ount given of the s upposed disc over y of the har monic numbers: “It is s tated that whe n pass ing near a forge one da y, Pythagoras not ic ed that the hammers gave out very a ccurate mus ical conc or ds . He had them weighe d, a nd found that of thos e whic h sound- ed the octave, one weighed twice as much as the other; of those which m a de a perf ec t fift h, one weighed one-thir d more t ha n the other, and in the c ase of a fourth, one-quart e r more. After hav- ing tr ie d t he hammers, he took a string stretched with we ight s , a nd f ound that whe n he had ap- plied a given w eight in t he f irst ins tance to make any parti c ular note , he ha d to doubl e the weight to obtain the octave , t o add one - third extra only to obtain a fif th, a quar ter f or the f ourth, an eighth f or one tone, and about an eighteenth f or a half- tone. More simply still, he s tr e tched a cord, and then when the whole l e ngth s ounded any note, when stoppe d in the mi ddle it gave the octave, a t the third it ga ve the f ifth, at the quar ter t he four th, at t he eighth the tone, and a t the eighteenth the s emi- tone . \" According to Pl uta r ch, the inter va l from the earth to the fixed sta r s was cons idered the diapas on, or extent of s even tones , a nd the dista nces of the seve n planets, including the sun and moon, fr om each other, wer e expres sed by tones a nd se mi -tones in di fferent propor tions . “The s phere of the s tars was the common enve l ope or c ir cumference of the univer s e, and Saturn, immediately below it , cor res ponded to the thirty- s ixt h tone and the earth to the fi rs t , and the oth- er planets w i th the s un and moon at the various harmonic distance s. One tone was r ec koned f rom the earth to the moon, ha l f a tone fr om the moon to Mercury, another ha l f-tone to Venus , one tone and a ha l f f rom Venus to the s un, one f rom the s un to Mars , a s emi-t one from M ar s to Jupi- ter, half a tone f rom Jupiter to Satur n, a nd a tone and a ha lf f rom S a t urn to the fixed s tars, but thes e dis t a nces were not universally agreed upon.\" (\"Astronomical Myths,\" p. 167.

Cicero a nd M acrobius also expr e ss ed opinions with r e- gard to thi s c elestial concert. “Such great mot ions , \" wrote Cicero, “cannot take plac e in silence , and it is natural t ha t the two e xtr emes should ha ve relate d s ounds as in the octave .

True, no one has ever heard these s ounds, but P ythagoras could have ans wered such an ob- jection as follows, when he said: “We are always surr ounde d by this melody, a nd our ears are ac- cus tom e d to i t f rom our bir th, s o that, having nothing diff erent to compare it with, we cannot perceive it. \" “ The re' s no t the sm al lest or b, tha t th ou beho lde s t , But i n his mot ion li ke a n a nge l sings, Sti ll qui rin g t o the yo ung-e yed c heru bim ; Such ha rm ony is in im mor ta l s ou l; But , whil st thi s m uddy ve s t ure of de ca y Doth gr os sl y c lo s e i t in, we ca nnot he ar it .\" The doc tr ine of c elestial harmony, by w hi c h wa s meant the m us ic of the spheres , was c omm on to all the nations of the Eas t . T o this divine music Eur ipe des alluded in the f ollowing words: “Thee I invoke, thou s elf -created B eing, who gavest birth to natur e , and whom light and da r knes s, and the whole t rain of globes encircle with eternal music . \" S c huber t, in his Sy mboli s m of Dr eams , has the foll ow i ng pass age relative to mus ic: \"It may be asked whether that language which now occupies so low a place in t he e stimation of man, be not the actual making of the higher regions , while we, aw ake, as we f anc y ourse l ve s, may be sunk in a sleep of many thousa nd ye ar s , or, at leas t, in the echo of their dr ea ms, and only intelligibly ca t c h a few dim words of that l a nguage of God, as s leepers do s cattered e xpr es sions from the l oud conversa ti ons of t hos e ar ound them. \" The R osicrucians ' theories, wit h regard to the mus ic of the s pheres, a r e ably desc r ibed in H ar - grave J enning's book, upon their ri te s a nd mysteries . They vie w the w hol e world as a m us ical in- strument; that is , a chromatic, sens ible instrument. “T he common axis or pole of the w or ld c eles- tial is inter s ected–whe r e thi s s uper ior diapa son, or heavenly c hor d, is di vide d–by the s pi ritual sun or ce ntr e of s entience. Every man has a litt le s par k (sun) in himself. T ime is only protracted cons ciousnes s. Earthly mus ic is the faintest traditi on of the ange li c s tate; it remains in the mind of man, a s the dream and regret for the ‘Lost Paradise.'

The Cabalis ts imagined that the arrangement of the stars in the s ky, a nd t he varyi ng s peed of the planets of the s olar sys tem, pr oduce d harmonious s ounds. They taught that God “made the world\" by the “ means of music;\" that mus ic, as man know s mus ic, is ess entially a power; that (thr ough it originally) everything was pos sible, a s the gift of God; which explains the class ic fables of Orpheus , Amphion, and the mythological wonder -workers in mus i c .
