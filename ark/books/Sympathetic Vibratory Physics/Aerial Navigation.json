M aintaining that a n abs tr a ct idea or a natur a l law m a y in one sens e be invented, he give s it as hi s opinion tha t Newton did not disc over the theory of gravitation but inve nt e d it; that he may ha ve bee n at work on the problem f or ye ar s , inventing theory aft e r theory to which he found i t imposs i ble to s hape his f ac ts. Thi s is precise ly what Keely ha s be en doing i n the c onstruction of his sys tem of s ympathetic phys ics; so adverse is it in all its c anons to thos e of mechanical phys ics. He ha s been unr ave li ng the mysteries of sympa t he ti c ass ociation, whil e sea r ching to wr es t fr om nature the secrets of pl a netary sus pension, and what Nor ma n Lockyer calls “the law of sympathetic vibrati on.\" Edi s on does not call himse l f a disc over e r . He sa ys that most of his inventions have been the result of long and patient labor, of countles s experiments a l l directed towa r d s ome well defined object; and the sa me may be said of Keely in his inventions , for he is bot h a dis coverer and an inventor . E xpe r imenting in the f ield of vibration, but in quite another line t ha n that of sympathetic vibr a ti on, he made his discov- ery of a n unknown energy. Be l l filed the telephone a s an invention be f ore he had discovered that arti c ulate speec h c oul d be con- veyed a long a wir e . Re aching out into unknown realms, on the line of i nve nti on, he laid hold of a dis- covery when specula t ing on t he nature of s ound. I n the same manner K eely’s specula t ions , in the field of acous tics, led him into t ha t gr e at unknown tract w hi c h lies beyond the horizon of ordinary matter. It wa s in s ubjecting wa t e r to the a ction of multiple vibrations i n a ma chine which he c alled a hydr o-pneumatic- pulsa t ing-vacuo engine that his lever s uddenly regis ter e d a pr e ss ur e of two thous and pounds. It was s ix years la t e r that e xper imental res earch, on the line of vi bration, enabled Ke ely to pr oduce this manipulation of energy a t will; for he had no ide a a t what number of vibrations the water ha d bee n disin- tegrated. Commenc i ng with one hundred per se cond he proceeded until his instrument regis ter e d for ty- two t hous and eight hundred, when the same press ur e was a gain s hown, and the problem was solved. It was about this time that s ome distinguishe d men of scienc e, who w er e called in to acc ount f or the phe- nomenon, found it eas i e r to denounc e Ke ely a s a cha r latan than to explain the na tur e and source of the energy; one of thes e men has recently said t ha t he thought a m a n who could produce a regis ter e d pres- sure of fr om two to t w enty thousa nd pounds and pr ofes s to be ignor a nt of its source must be a fr aud. Des ert e d and stigmatized by physicists , Keely's only hope in the l ine of utilizing t his unknown energy lay in thos e men who had in 1872 or ga ni z ed a Keely M otor C ompany 1 i n or de r to f urnish the “sine ws of"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Aer ia l Navi ga ti on - pa ge 4 of 8 war\" that could e nable him to battle with a nd conquer the invi s ible genii he had im prisone d by s eeming chanc e in his vacuo-engine, and which had alr ea dy reduced hi s funds t o “vacuo.” That Ke ely would eventually ga i n the mastery of this va por , no one ha d a s hadow of doubt who knew t he indomi table will, energy and persis tency of purpose poss ess ed by i ts discoverer, c om bine d w i th his inve nt ive ge ni us , a s made known in the novel construction of the engine which gave bir th to t he vapor that they then named Keil. But w hen the men who as sumed the dir ec ti on of t he aff a i rs of the company found that t he demon, thus evoked, c oul d not be kept unde r lock and key, and t ha t it had no intention of r eturning in any form the gold t he y ha d poured out like water, they soon evince d, by t he i r course toward Mr. Keely, tha t they were unacqua i nte d with the history of scie nt ific discove r y, a nd of the length of tim e that has a lways elaps ed betwee n the revelation to man of an unknown force of nature and its application to the arts. Of this we l l- known f ac t the distinguished physicis t, P rofess or Dewa r of the Royal Ins t itution of Gr e at B r itain, wrote in 1890: “ I f Mr. Ke ely s uccee ds in making hi s discovery practically useful, as it is said he is demons tr at- ing hi s abilit y to do— if thi s i nformation be true, it is strange to c ont ras t the pas t his tor y of s cience with the pres ent. Fanc y the disc overer of e lectr ic i ty having suc ceeded in inventi ng the modern dynamo ma- chine! T his would mean the c oncentr a ti on of hundreds of years of sc ientif ic discove r y and invention into the single l ife of one ma n. S uc h a r e sult would be simply marvelous.” Yet s o sa nguine were thes e men of immediate s ucce ss t ha t they made promise s, base d on the alwa ys sa nguine hopes of a n inventor , which Kee ly was una ble to f ulfill; with the conse quence that the Keely Motor enterprise c ame to be regarded a s a f raudulent undertaking, Keely himse lf a s a s windler, a nd his adherents either dis r e put a ble gamblers in s tock or the dupes of hi s wiz ar d artif ices . At this juncture one of his ci-devant mana ger s , J ohn H. Lori me r , and one of his s t oc kholder s , Oliver M . Ba bcock, ca me f orward with a t te m pts t o remove fr om Kee l y' s shoulders the load of obl oquy which, joined to the total cutting off of the funds ne eded to pursue his resea r che s, had so de pr ec iated his vitality as to l e ad him to contemplate suicide and to destroy devices f or rese ar c h which had been t he l a bor of years. T ogether t he se two loyal, s teadfast f riends lift e d the veil of mys tery which had gather e d around Keely's wor k, and one by a minor ity repor t and the other by a se r ies of lectures made it pe r fectly clear and without a s hadow of doubt that ce r tain of the company's director s were res ponsible for the existing sta t e of affairs. About this time, a small pamphlet written by Mr. Babcock, “Fraud, Force, Facts,\" fell into t he hands of H. 0. Ward, who, c onvinced thereby of the integr ity of Keely and of the uns cr upulous greedines s of some of the directors or m a nagers of the company, c ame to the r es cue with the required f unds f or the continuance of res earches ; and Keely, thus e ncour a ged, purs ued his work with renewe d enthusias m. Of that winter , 1881- 82, , he a l w ays spe aks as the darkest period of his li fe. To thi s t rinity of united e f fort in behalf of tr uth and j us tice, dr aw n together by an overr uling Providence, the stockholde r s of the Keely Motor Company ow e wha t e ver commercial s ucces s the e nter prise may br ing to them i n the f uture. To the world at lar ge it does not matter whether t his century or the next sees the viewless pathways of the air opened t o navigation, so long as it is authoritatively announc ed that t he conjec t ures of the late Pr of. Jos eph Leidy and of D r . Ja mes M . Willcox, ma de in 1889, that Kee ly was on the road t o the solv- ing of this problem, are now ver ified by his succ ess as well- founded conje ctur es . This s ystem is the only one by which a er ial navigation can be r e nder e d s afe; for it is in copying nature's methods that the over - coming of gr avity has been gained, and t he operating principle is the sa me that guides and c ont rols the heave nl y bodies in their orbits and under lies planetary s uspens ion. The s ystem of this “ Newton of the mind\" demons tr ates , on the mate r ial plane, the superiorit y of the spiritual or e t he r e al power s ; and the unity of nature, of s cience and philosophy become s evident. “Its broad and reac hing philosophy,\" to quote the opinion of Pr ofes sor Dewa r , “has a physical genesis , and is the result of the patient and persis- tent res earches of ye ar s . \" B ut we are not dealing now with t he philosophy, rather wit h the events which gave bir th to it; for up to this tim e Kee ly had devoted m ore thought to e ngines than to sys t e ms.

Mr. B abcock’s res umé of the situation, made in 1881, is no longer complete; such great a nd un- dreamed-of advance s ha s Ke ely effected s ince that ti me in the unexplor ed terr itory that lay befor e him, wherein he had not then ga i ne d even so much as a f oothold; f or he was too nea r '”the s hadow rea l m\" in which those physicis t s a r e now groping, who have pa ss ed from the inve stigation of ordinary, visible matter into that of the structur e of the e ther . T wo years later, in 1884, Keely disc over e d that the occult vapor which he had imprisoned is t he ether; a nd for f our years he bent all his energies upon the cons tr uc- tion of an engine that would hold it in rotation; f or so only c ould it be “us ed a nd c ontr olled, a s we now use and contr ol s t e am, \" to quote Prof es sor Rucke r 's surmise, m a de in his paper r ea d be f ore the meeting of the Briti s h As soc i a ti on at Cardif f s even years later, i n October, 1891. In 1888, Ke ely made a ve r bal contract with H. O. Ward, to do no more work on an engine , for the Keely Motor C ompany, until he knew more of the properti e s of the ethe r , and in 1889 t his contract was legally exec ut e d. It was during t his pe r iod that Ke ely dis covered that the ether is not the ene r gy itself, but the medium of one of the curr e nts of a tr iune pola r flow, of which he ha d now gained the control, for a er ia l na vigation, hooking his machinery on to the machinery of nature, t o quote Tesla's wor ds .

Phys ical in- ves ti ga ti on will be s ti mulated by the unfolding of Ke ely's s ystem of philos ophy, as well as by the dem- onstrations that he w i ll be able t o give, whe n his mecha nical w or k is done, of the exis tence of “mind flow. \" Physicis ts will then no longer s hr ink fr om i nve stigations on this line, in f ea r of the r idicule which orthodox scienc e deals with no uns pari ng hand upon the va nguard that has approached the bor derland of its mysteries. As has a l ready been show n, when M r. Ba bcock delivered his l e ctur e s both Kee l y and himself believed it to be poss i ble to use a nd c ont rol the vapor ous pr oduct of t he dis sociation of the ele m e nts of wate r in his disintegrator, but Ke ely found i t imposs ibl e to test its natur e in any wa y. As long a s it was ke pt in r ota- tion energy was manif es ted. All his devices to hold i t, in this rotating conditi on, failed to operate beyond a li mited tim e ; and to “s top the leak \" wa s equally imposs ible. Nothing wa s le f t but atmosphe r ic air, af - ter it s esc ape fr om the engine. T he r e wa s also s omething so mysterious, so occ ult , in it s operation as to lead Ke ely, in 1882, to t ry to cons tr uct a n automatic device, by the use of which e ach man could effect its contr ol, a ccordi ng to the degree of his energy of will. Two mor e years were thrown awa y on thi s line of r e search, when the s ugges t ion w as made t o Keely that he must have dis sociated hydrogen, c lass ed as a s i mple by s cience. His answ er wa s, “ P e r haps I have ; it may be poss ible. ” T hus his attention was turned to s tudying hydrogen, wit h some mar ve l ous res ul ts in the l ine of as tr onomica l resea r che s. In 1884, the same sugge stion wa s m a de to L ord R aleigh, who r e- plied by off e r ing t o sta ke ten thousand pounds that hydrogen is not a compound. But t he s eed di d not fall on rocky ground in Keely’s great mi nd; and when, followed by other sugges tions, it germinated, Keely was not long in pr oving to his own satis f ac t ion that by the di s soc i a ti on of hydrogen he had impr is oned the ether. F our yea r s later P rofess or Henr i H er tz, of Bohn University, announced tha t the ether was he ld, bound as it we r e, in a l l electrom a gnetic engines . Advanced physicists in Eur ope then bega n to as k, “I f we have im prisone d the ether without know i ng it, why may not Ke ely have done the s ame?” Taking up a new s tandard of r es earch, Ke ely pursued it by day and ni ght, often wor king eighteen hours out of the twe nty- four , until the subtle ethe r ic vapor , which had eluded his eve r y ef fort to continue w i th- in walls of metal, and baffled his every attempt to c ontr ol, was revealed t o him as the medium of na- ture’ s mos t powerful agent, the tr iune polar flow, which he ha s now harnes sed f or navigating the air . Sir John Hers chel said; “T he r e is a principl e in music which has yet to be dis covered.” This is the pr inci- ple which Keely has laid hold of and utilized, af te r more than twe nty years of effor t to wres t it f rom the great s t orehous e of nature’ s s ecrets - thus f ulfil ling K epler ’s pr ophe cy, that God would reveal to this age the mys ter ie s a t tenda nt upon the oper a t ion of gr avity; a nd provi ng that the Pythagorean conception of music as the principle of the creation’s order, and the mainstay and s uppor ter of the material world, is strictly i n ac cor da nce with the marvelous trut hs r eve aled in Ke ely’ s s ystem of s ympathetic vibr atory"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Aer ia l Navi ga ti on - pa ge 8 of 8 physic s.
