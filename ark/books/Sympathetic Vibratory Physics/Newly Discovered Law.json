T ha t any c onsiderable a mount of developed li ght or heat could be precipitated fr om them dir e ct upon their planets through such a medium as must exist in spa ce, is ve r y improbable, if not abs olutely impos sible.

THE SUN Philosophy a nd mathematics have not a l w ays been ha ppi ly blended in the tea ching of as tr on- omy. The popular mind, often less skilled in figur es than in mechanica l principles and their rela- tions to practical life, cannot always see in extended problems a f ull illustration of the subject it tri e s to compas s.
