Whether scienc e turns it s glas s out into t he immensities of s pace, or in toward the equally fathomles s abys ses of the minute, there s eems no bounds to the pos sibilities of discove r y r ega r ding the proces ses of nature. Yet each and e ver y pathway leads at least to impenetrable mystery. What use to know of the ultimate molecule and atom, if we a r e neve r to l e ar n wha t endows it with lif e . What is life? What is death? What is pain? What is color? Per fume? What is there in a minor chor d to make one we ep? Thousa nds of hungry eyes are pee r ing i nto the dark in sea r ch of clues to thes e e ncir - cling mysteries . B ut a litt le r ift has appeared in the veil, thr ough w hi c h some think they c an se e a great and il luminating tr uth. Thi s truth is ca ll e d s ympathetic v i br ation . A new era da wned, we pas sed under a ne w s cientifi c dis pensa t ion when heat and light were pronounced simply modes of motion, and whe n the hither to solid eart h was found to be onl y se emingly so, whil e in reality it is a c ongeri e s of whirl ing atoms. Under this new dispens ation the door hiding those two baf - fli ng mys teri e s, m a tt e r and force, begins to yield. T he former ha s s ur rendered its s ecrets down to the ul- timate atom, and now we a r e told that energy, that insc r utable thing which makes m a tt e r its s lave and plaything, is simply a mode of moti on in the atom. The initial impulse is s til l as r emote as ever. We have not yet di s covered on what our tortoise stands . What impar ted the f irst m ove ment to the atom, may be an ever rece ding mystery; but an e nor mous ad- vance has been made upon the outlying territor y. 'c i e nce has gone one generation farther bac k in the pedigree of energy; for the l a w of s ympathetic vi bration m us t be the L aw of L aw s . We are told that wha t we have known a s sound, hea t and li ght are s imply as cending stages of i nc r ea sing rates of ve l oc it y, in atmos pher ic or ether ic atoms . Betwe en s ixteen a second and thir ty-eight t hous and a se cond thes e vibrations a r e appreciable by the human ear, and we call them s ound . As t he rate of veloci- ty inc r ea ses thes e a r e lost in s ilence, and fi na ll y reappear t o the sens e as heat . T he n, af te r they a r e fur ther acc elerated, the optic ne r ve begins to tremble a t their appr oa ch, and we call them light . Nor can we sup- pose this to be a f inal l imit, but must be li e ve that, acce ler a t e d to s t ill highe r ve locity, they may reach us in s ome new for m, which to man's perception, at lea st, is not sound, nor he at, nor yet light, and which, perhaps, w e ca ll electricity. But this protean thing, it will be obse r ved, is one and the s ame throughout . I t is energy, evolved into higher and highe r forms, under the a ction of the law of vibration. Nor can we stop her e . W hat ri ght have we to suppos e t ha t the sta ge bounded by our per c eption, is fi na l? M uch mor e ea sy is it to believe that the process goes on, a nd forces are developed as f a r beyond electricity as electricity i s beyond our sta r ting point, s i xte en vi brations a s econd; and so we a r e inevitably led to a conception of potential energies ly- ing a l l around us , suff ic i e nt to hold the s tars i n their course s, or to t e ar them from their orbits. Thus f a r we are standing on solid scientific gr ound. He who doubts t his asce ndi ng ladder of ene r gy, ar - rays hi ms elf against so high a n authori ty as Prof. Tyndall.

As man has ris en to higher stages of development he has appr opriated progr es sively higher stages of ene rgy.

T he waves of light and heat must be like the heavy beatings of the surf , and the moti ons of electricity gross and s luggish, compared with the r hythm of those ethereal vibr ations which could only be wielded by Omnipotenc e! And is i t not ob- vious that t he age nt which sympathe t ic ally reache s these, mus t be come c or res pondi ngly fi ne ? Is thought suc h an agent?

Have we by ine vi ta bl e steps reached the verge of that kingdom we have be en acc ustomed to regard a s se par a te and distinct? I f so, matter is lifted f rom its long a baseme nt . The pulsations in the heart of gr an- ite are t he thr obbings of the Divine, as tr uly as when it makes the s oul of man tremble with ne w lif e . And wha t wonder that mus i c thr ills , if it be a manifestation differ e nt in degree, but identical in kind, with the spiritual e ner gy which nour is hes the universe ? If the phe nomena of matter and of spirit are control led by t he s ame force, only in diff erent degrees of de- velopment, then r ea sonable caus e a nd effect take the place of magic and of mys ter y. If it be true t ha t spiritual atoms , no les s than material ones , ar e arranging themse lves according to their velocities , then every r e lation, human and divine, is comprehens ible. If this law underli e s both w or lds , then those spiri tua l a t oms numer ic ally a nd r hythmically allied have a n \"affi nity\" f or each other; they rush together in irresis ti ble embrace; and t he r e is a scientific ba sis for human a f fections , f or c onduct, and for praye r !

Observe that whe n you sing a C not e over the piano, not alone the C s tr ings , but E, G and B vi- brate respons ively, bec ause ha r monious l y related. So two beings who love each other may make a richer harmony for not having identically the s ame r hythm in their souls. But on the other ha nd, union with one outside this harmonious gr oup is impos sible. Discord is a vi ola t ion of natur e . Two notes inharmoniously related can never combine. T hey may be s imult a neously sounded; but they do not blend. D i s cord is in its es sence a destructive f orce. Unha ppy marr iage s, in fact one-half the tragedies of human lif e, find their solution in the laws which govern music; and the language of metaphor is pr ofoundly and scie nt ifically true.
