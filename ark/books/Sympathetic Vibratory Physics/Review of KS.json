He has proved by demonstrtion that the s ubdivi s ion of ma t te r under diff erent or ders of pro- gress ive vib. evolve s by suc h s ubdi vis ion entirely ne w and distinct elements, too mult iple to enumerate. He has sys t e matized the proper vibrator y chords, progr e ssive l y, from the intr oduc- tory molecular to the inter-etheric, embr a cing 7 distinct orders of tri ple s ubdi vis ion. He has elaborated a s ystem of inducing s ympathetic negative a t traction on metallic mass es, with gr e at range of mot ion, a nd instant depolarization of t he s ame, by vibratory change of their ne utr al centers . Kee l y controls t he transmis sion of t he se sympathetic streams by a medium of high mo- lecular density, viz., dr awn wires of dif ferentiated metals, gold, s i lve r , platinum, German silver, etc. 4.

In gravity i t would be more correct to spe ak of triple c onnective links, as there is no flow of gravity. 5.

M y res earch- es have proved to me the subtle and pur e conditions of the pow er of negative attraction and positive pr opuls ion. 6. These sa m e rese ar c h have enable Keely to pronounce defini te l y as to the nature of what is recognized as gravity, as ever- e xisting, eternal force, coexis tent with t he compound etheric, or high luminous , enter ing into all f orms of aggregated matter at t he i r bir th. Keely thinks that gravity is the source f rom which all vis ible matter s pri ngs , and t ha t the ( s ympathetic) or (neu- tral) center of such aggregation bec om e s at birth a ( c onnective concordanct link) to all neutral centers that have prece ded it and to all that may s ucceed it, and tha t disturbance of equilibri um, like gravity, is an ever- e xi s ting for c e. 7. Keely has cons tr ucte d instruments by whic h he is endeavoring to determ ine the natur e of the (tr iune) a ction of the ( pola r ter res tr ial stream), or envelope, a s regards its vibr a t ory phil os ophy. He is seeking to demons tr a t e its (sympathetic ass ociation) with the (celes t ial stream), or (l umi- nifer ous track), the (compound ethe r ic f ield), fr om which a l l planetary mas se s spring. He con- side r s the electric s tr e am to be one of the ( triune s ympathetic s tr e ams) whic h help to build up, in their or der of tr iple concentrtion, t he high vi ta l ity of the (polar) stream, or more cor rec t ly, the magnetic-electric te r res t rial envelope, without which all living or ganis ms would ce ase to e xi s t. He clas ses the cohes i ve for c e of molec ular mase s as the dominant or de r of the e lectr ic stream, the m ole cule owing its negative a tt ractive quality to the magne t ic element. I n Keely's bea uti ful experiments in anta goni z ing the pol a r stream, recently given before men of s cience, he has cop- ied i n his instrument the conditions which Na t ure has es tabli s hed in all her terr es tr ia l ranger, conditions neces sa r y in order to e quate a s t a te of s ympathetic dis tur ba nce for the r e vit a li z ation of what is continually being displace d by negative dis persion. Thes e mec hanical c ondit ions are principally (dif ferential vibratory s etti ngs ) on m ole cular aggregations of the metallic mas ses of gold, silver, and platinum . 8. He has discove r e d that t he range of molecular motion in all quies cent m a ss es is equal to one- thir d of their diameters , and that all extende d range is i nduc ed by sound-for ce , set at chord of the t hirds which are antagonis tic to the combined chords of the ma ss of the neutr a l cente r s that they r epres ent, no two mass es being alike, and that a certain increas ed range of molecular a c- tion, induced by the pr oper acoustic for ce , the molecules be come repellent, and that w hen the sympa t he ti c cente r s are inf luenc ed by a vibration c oncor da nt to the one that exis ts i n them- se lves, (the molec ul e s become attr ac ti ve ; that the repellent c ondit ion see ms t o take place at a distanc e of a bout ten of the diame t e r s of the molecules ) , this dista nce repres enting the neutr a l line of their attr a ctive force, or the divi ding line be t w een the (attr ac ti ve ) and the (r e pellent) . Be yond this line, perf ec t tri ple s eparation takes plac e, ( ins ide of it, perfect att rac t ive as sociation is the res ult) . T he for ce which Mr. Keely uses in r unning machinery is the ( s ympathetic atr ac - tive). For aerial navigation he will us e a negation of this f orce. 9. Keely has disloca ted joints of his fi nge r s and thumbs, he has broken his ribs, he has had his left s i de paralyzed for weeks , he ha s l os t the sight in one eye f or months , in his hand-to- hand fight with the genii that he has encountered, and cannot c ompl e tely s ubdue until he has effected the conditi on of (polar iz ation and depolarization which is neces sary f or the control of rotation and r e ver s ion) in his commercial engine. An illness of 9 weeks followed his a bandonment of water i n disintegrating; and he was obliged to return to i ts us e, to a voi d the per c ussion that wa s induced by the rapid vibration of the atmospheric sid. 10.

(169) The s ystem of arr anging intr oductory ether ic impulses by compund c hor ds s et by dif ferential harmonies, is one that the world of s cience has never rec ogni z ed, simply be cause the struggles of phys icists, c om ba ti ng with the solution of the conditions governing the four th or der of mat- ter, have been i n a di rec t ion thor oughly antagonistic, a nd opposite to a right one. I t is t rue that luminosity ha s been induc ed by chemical antagonism and, im my m ind, this ought to have been a stepping-stone towards a more per fect condition than was acc epted by them; but independe nt of what might be neces sary t o its analusis , the ba r tr uth r ema i ns that the c ondit ions we r e isolat- ed - robbed of their most vit a l es sentials - by not having the medium of etheric vibrtion as soc i a t- ed with them. In order to subdivid the atoms in the atomic triplet, the molecula r ether, li be r ate d fr om the molecule, is abs olutely nec ess ar y to e f fect the ruptur e of the atoms; and so on, pr ogres sively, in e ach order of ether, m ole cular , intermolecular, atomic, inter- atomic etheric, inter- etheric, the ether liberated in ea ch s ucces sive division is e sse nti a l to the next subdivision. The keynote of M r . Ke ely's r es earches is that the movements of e l e ctr ic are r hythmical, and be- for e he had reac hed his prese nt sta ge in pr oduc i ng vibr a ti ons , on the pri nc ipl e of res onance, he has had pr oble m s to solve which needed the full meas ure of ins pir ation or apperception t ha t he has received. Keely has produced, us i ng an atmospheric me di um alone, 519,655, 633 vib. per se cond; but , in- terposing pur e hydrogen gas be tween s oap f ilms and using it as a m e dium of ac celeration, he as serts that on the e nhar monic thir d a rate of vibration may be induce d which could not be set down in figur es , and could only be represe nt e d in sound c olour s . He has invented instruments which demonstrate i n many var iations the colours of sound, registering the number of ne ces- sa r y vibr a t ions to pr oduc e ea ch variation. The tr ans miss ive s ympathetic chord of B f lat, third octave, w hen pas sing into inaudibility, wouls i nduc e billions of billions of vibr ations represent- ed by s ound colours on a sc r e en illuminated from a solar r ay. But thi s e xper iment is one of in- fini te diff iculty, fr om the a l mos t utter impos sibilit y of holding the hydrogen be t w een the two fil ms long enough to conduct t he expe r iment. Keely made over 1200 tri a ls bef ore succ eeding once in inducing the intenc e blue f ie l d neces sa r y, cove r ing a s pace of 6 weeks 4 hours at a time daily, and should he eve r succ eed in his pr e sent ef forts t o produce a film that wil l stand, he an- ticipates being able to register the range of m otion in all m e talli c mediums.

I n submitting wa ter to the inf lue nce of vi bratory trans m is sion, even on s im- ple t hirds, the high a ction induced on the hydrogen a s c ontr as ted w i th the one on the oxygen (under the same vibr a t ory stream), cause s t he antagonis m betwee n thes e e lements that induces diss ociation. The ( diff e r ential antagonistic range) of motion, so favour ing the a nt a gonistic thir ds a s t o become thor oughly r e pellent. The ga seous ele m e nt thus induced and regis t e r ed, show s t hous ands of times much gr ea ter for ce as regards tenuity and volume than that induc ed by chemical dis integr a ti on of heat, on the s ame medium. In all mol e cular (dissoc iation) or (di s - integrastion) of both simple or compound e l e m e nts, whether gaseous or solid, a s tr e am of vibra- tory antagonis ti c thirds, sixths , or ninths, or their c hor d mass will compel progr e ss i ve s ubdivi - sions . In the disintegration of water the instrument is se t on t hirds, s ixths and ninths , t o get t he bes t effects. These tr iple conditions are focalized on the neutral c enter of s aid ins t rument so as to induce perf e ct harmony or ( conc or da nce) to the chord-not e of the (m a ss - chord) of the instrument's f ull combination; after which the (diatonic) and the (enharmonic) is thoroughl y harmonized w i th the scale of ninths which i s pla ced a t the base of the ( vibratory transmitter) with the telephone head. T he next step is t o disturb the harmony on the conc entr tive thir ds , between the trans mi t- ter and disintegrator. This i s done by r otating t he (syren) s o as to induce a s ympathetic c om mu- nication along the nodal trans m itter, or wire, that a ssoc iates the two instruments.

We can appreciate the difficulty of conve r ting such a medium to a unif orm molec ul a r link, by knowing that it can be a ccomplished only after the r e movi ng of all nodal interf e r enc e, by inducing be- tween the noda l wires a conditi on in which they become subse r vient to the inter -sympa t he ti c vi- brator y molecular link of such a structur e or wire. Ther e f ore, it is nec ess ary to s ubmit the wir e to a s ystem of gr adua ti on in order to f ind what the combined chords of these nodal interferences represent when f oca li z ed to one ge ner a l center. Then the dif ferentiation betwe en thes e nodal wa ves and the inter- molecular l ink must be e quat- ed by what I call a proces s of vibrator y induction, so as to induce pure conc or danc e be t w een one and the other.

(181) A spun shell of 12\" i nte r nal diameter and 1/32\" thi c k has a volume of 904. 77 cu. in. On deter- mination by r e search we f ind the s hell to be on its res onating volume B f lat, and the molec ular volume of the metal that the sphere is composed of a natur a l. This or any other antagonistic chord, as betwee n the chor d mas s of the s hell and its atmospheric volume, w oul d not interfer e but w oul d come under subs ervience. We now pas s a steel shaft thru its ce nt e r 1/2\" i n diameter, which r e pr es ent its axial r e st. T his sha f t subjects the atmospheric volum e of the shell to a cer- tain dis placement or reduction, to correct w hi c h we fi rs t register the chord note of its mass , and find it to be a nt a gonistic t o the c hor d mass to the s hell, a c er ta i n port ion of an octave. T his must be c or rected. T he molecular vol ume of the shaft mus t be reduced i n volume, either by fil ling or tur ning, s o as to r e pr es ent t he fir s t B flat chord tha t is r e ached by s uch reduction. When this is done the f irst line of interference is ne utr alize d, and the condition of wympa t hy is as pure be tween t he parts as it wa s when the globe was minus i ts axis . There is now intr oduce d on i ts axis a ring which has 7 tubes or gr adua t ing resonators, the ri ng being t w o- thirds the diam- eter of t he globe, the r e sonators are 3\" long and 3/4\" diameter, eac h one to be se t on the chord of B flat, which is done by s lidi ng the small diaphragm in the tube to a point that will indica t e B flat. This setting then control the metalli c dis pl a cement of the metallic combination, as also of the ar ms nec ess ary to hol d the ring and res onator s on shaft or axis. Thus t he s econd equation is es tablished both on r es onation a nd displac ement.

T his antagonis m mus t be thor oughly sen- sitive to the chord mas s of one of the hemis pher e of whic h the globe is compos ed. The axis of the scale ring must r ota t e loose ly on t he globe's s haf t without revolving with the globe itself; which it is pr e vented from doing by being weighted on one side of the ring by a small hollow brass ball, holding about two ounces of lead. T he remaining work on the device is finishe d by painting the interi ours of the globe, one hemisphere bl a ck a nd one white, and a tt a ching a rubber bulb s uch as is used to s pr ay perf ume, to the hollow end of the s haft .

The action induce d by the mouth or gan, trans m itted at a dista nce from the sphere without any connec t ion of wire, demonstrates the pur ity of the principle of sympathetic tr a ns- miss ion, as negatized by dis cor da nts; which, focalizing on the r es onating s evenths of res ona- tors, or tubes attac hed to r ing, the sympathetic fl ow is by this means trans m itted to the f oc aliz- ing c enter, or center of ne utr ality, to be re-distri buted at each r evolution of sphere, kee ping intact t he s ym pa thetic volume dur ing sens itization, thus pr eve nt ing the e quation or s toppage of its r otation.

T he nega t ive sympa t he ti c polar s tr e am is the m a gnetic flow proper, and it is in syma t he ti c coincidenc e with the s econd atomic flow; the e l e ctr ic curr e nt is the first and s econd order of atomic vibr ation, a dual force, the f low of which is too tenuous to dis place the mole- cules .

If a ba r of ste el or iron is brought into c ontact with a ma gnet, t he latent f orce that the ste el or iron is impr e gnated with is ar ous ed, and shows its interstitial latent action by still holding an- other bar.

II I. Law of the Dominant: every such object is suc h by virtue of the higher or domi na nt force which contr ols thes e t w o tendencie s. Applying t he se fundamental la ws to an explana t ion of the universe, as it is brought to human cognition, all manifestations of for ce may be tr e ated as modes of vibrations. The es se nt ia l dif - fer e nces give r is e to thr ee modes of vibrations:- I. The Radiating: called also the \"Dis persing, \" t he Propulsive, the \" P os itive, \" a nd the \" E nhar m onic.\" II . The Focalizing: ca ll e d also t he \"Nega ti ve , \" the \"Ne gative Attractive, \" the Polarizing, \" and the Harm onic . \" II I. The Dominant: called also the \"E the r ic,\" or the \" Celes tial. \" These it will be noted corr e spond t o the thr ee laws of be ing. It is not t o be understood that may one of thes e three modes of vibration ca n exis t independe ntl y.

The (evolut ion) of what is called \" matter \" fr om the differ e nt modes of vibration is through the action of the second law , that of focaliza ti on, or \" negative attraction, \" or \" negative aff inity.\" Where the vibrations under this mode mee t , and are maintained in a s tate of mutual affini ty or equilibri um, t he r e is es tablished what is called a \"ne utr al cente r ,\" or , as otherwise expres sed, \" A center of s ympathetic coincidence . \" The ter ms \"neutral attr a ction, \" \" neutr a l a f finit y,\" \" negative attraction, \" or \"pola r negative attraction,\" are employed to e xpr e ss the property of a mode of vi- bration to di rect its components towards such center.

I nter-etheric In this li s t the f orms of matter are arranged in the mathematica l se quence of t he rapidity of the osc il la t ions of t he i rcons tit ue nt m e mber s : the propor tion being proved by expe r iment to be a s foll ow s: for the molecular orders: 1: 3: 9: 27: 81: 243 Thi s arithmetical progr es sion c hanges i n t he atomic order s to a ge ometr ica l pr ogres sion as f ol- lows: 3: 9: 81: 6561: 43046721, etc. Thi s sa m e method of progress ion i s believed to hold in all the order s of vi brations above the molecular, and s oon pass es into mathematical infi nity. A ctually, however, a ll matters of which we are capa ble of cognition through the medium of our s enses is in one of thr e e form s of a ggr e- gation: I . M olecular II . Atomic II I. E the r ic in e ach of which the controll ing mode of vi bration i s res pectively, I . The Enharmonic II . The Har monic I II . The Dopminant But it mus t be understood tha t each of thes e modes is a positive and r ea l constituent of every atom a nd molecule. It will be seen that as every form of material aggregation is to be cons i de r ed as a \" neutr a l center of attr ac ti on,\" whe r e the vibratory f orce of all thr ee or ders ar e held i n \" sympathetic c oi nc idence,\" that is, in balanc ed a ctivit y or har monize d motion, a nd not by any means ca ncelled or mutually des tr oyed, there is no diminution of for ce , but only tempor a r y suspe nsion of its r a diati ng or pr o- pulsive activity or e xpr es sion. T his is the f oundation of Kee l y's doctrine of \"latent force,\" and of the indefinit e power whic h can be obtained by breaking up the harm onious balance or equation of f orces of eve r y mode, which exists in eve r y \" neutr a l c enter ,\" that is to s ay in every ma ss of mater. In s o muc h as every mas s of matter consis ts thus, in fact, of vibrations in harm onic equilibrium, related by simple proport ions of thir ds , it f ollows that e ver y mass of every de scription stands in harmonic relation to e ver y other mass .

Ever y visible or ta ngi ble mass of matter mus t be regarded as an aggregation of m ole cules; the molecules be i ng the tr ue c enter s of the equated for ce s of \"ne utr alize d attraction.\" These mole- cules have been experimentally proved by Keely to be f ound of all three m ode s of vibr ation; the proof being tha t they r es pond to all three modes when subjected to the tes t s of compound con- cordant impuls es. When in t ha t s t a te of neutr a l aggregation which we know as m a tt e r , e ach m ole cule is in perpetual osc il la t ion, the range of the oscillation being 1/3 of the mol e cule, and its rapidity 20,000 oscilla- tions i n a s econd. It is t hrough the disturbance of t his os cil la t ory e qui librium, by means or reso- nant impul s es , that K eely alter s t he relations of t he vibratory impulse s which constitute matter . (T his he does by s tr iking the s ame chord in thr ee octaves , representing the third, s ixth, and ninth of the sc ale). O f thes e, the sixth reduce s the range of molec ul a r vibrations or os cillations; a nd, by t hus br inging nearer to each other the neutral ce nt e r s , increase s solicification. The ninth ex- tends the range of molec ul a r osc il la t ion, and t hus tends to give grea t e r tenuity to the mas s. It in- duces \" t rajec t ile velocity\" f rom neutral ce nter s , or \"neutral radiation. \" Experi me nt shows that molecular dis sociation does not take place unti l the molec ul e attains an oscillation a ppr oac hing, if not f ully r e aching 2/ 3 of its diameter. T his c an be effected by m e ans of the action of the \"en- harmonic\" or \"radiating\" c ur rent applied to the mas s, a f ter its molecules have once been dis- turbed by an \"introductor y i mpuls e;\" that is, by the musical note above me nt ione d. T he t hird repr e sents the \" dom inant,\" and when br ought under c ontr ol of a harmonic res onant impuls e in- duces a complete rearr ange ment of the modes of vibr a ti on and os cillation; in other wor ds , will transfor m the mas s either into its component initial forces , or into some other f orm of ma t ter. It is the s tudy of the dominant to which Keely has devoted his recent res earches. He aims to con- trol the power he evolves by a l te r ing the dominant or etheric mode of vibration in the triplicate flows of f orce. As all mol e cules and m a ss es are mere centers of harmonized vi brtions, tempo- rar ily held in s uspe nsion by simple l a ws i de nti c al with thos e of res onance, it follows that thes e centers can be br oke n up or divided by certain orders of vibration impingi ng upon and dis t urbing them. I t is a familiar fact t ha t a chord in vibr ation tends to produce a similar vibr a ti on in a cord placed near it . Thi s proper ty be longs to all vibrations whether resona nt or not, and they exe r t it in propor tion to the \" order \" to which they be long. The dis t a nce in s pace to whic h thi s power extends , or c an be extended, is w hat is called \" the sympa t he ti c outr e ach\" of the current or fl ow . In this manner we ha ve \" sympathetic positive pr opuls ion, \" with r eference to t he \" outr ea ch\" of the thir d or dominant current of the stream, whic h is allied to the order of e ther ic vi brations. Each molecule of a given mas s of ma t te r repres ents the same harmoni c chord or note in its osc i llatory motion. Yhe \" chor d of the mass \" is, therefor e , t he chord of every molec ul e of the mas s. But a s the condition of abs olutely stable equili brium is theor e t ic al only, a nd does not exist in na t ure, the chord of the mas s i s c onstantly c hanging. Ye t we must le ar n to control this \" chor d of the m a ss \" by resonant induction, i f we would command of the molecular f orces . Kee ly be li e ves he ha s solve d t his probl e m by the invention of a mechanical de vi c e which brings the chords of a l l mas s- es within the conditions of a f ew s i mple acous tic tes ts. T he r a nge of molec ular osc i llation is af - fected di fferently in differ e nt subs tances whe n submitted to the same vibr a t ory i mpuls e, and thes e ranges can be meas ur e d. I n the three metals , silver, gold, and pl a ti na , w e obtain the pr o- porti ons - 3: 6: 9 - As this is the pr imary r e l a ti on of the modes of vibration, a wire ma de of thes e three metals i s pe culiar ly adapted to transmit c oncordant inpulses ; and node s m a de of thes e subs tances place d upon a wir e, transmitting resona nt vibr tion, indicate, bu the differ e nt or - ders of vibr a ti on induced in them the rate of oscillations of the atomic c onstituents.
