T. HENRY MORAY The Words \"Radiant Energy\" and \"Dr. Moray\" have been synonymous for the past twenty years. The reader should bear in mind that most of the ideas as set fort h in the following pages, as also later date, were first given to t he world by Dr. Moray from 1911 to 1931, and therefore should be read with that thought in mind. In the past we permitted ourselves to be put on the defensive in our at- tempts to prove our stand. This was a mistake, as TRUTH should n ever be put on the defensive. The system of instruction of the Far East rathe r than that of the Western World should be used in advancing new discoveries of truth. In the Far East the teacher does not stop to prove each theory or fact. The message is delivered whether his hearers agree with him or not. He does no t care whether they all agree with him or not, for he feels sure those who are ready for the truth he teaches will recognize it, and for the others, if they are not prepared to receive the truth, no amount of argument will help matters. The Eas tern teach- er knows that much of his teaching is but the planting of seed w hich will grow and be recognized only after the lapse of time. We do not mean that anyone should blindly accept everything pres ented to him, but history, repeating itself, does prove that mankind goes on from one generation to another blindly closing its mind to new lines of thought only be- cause he does not or will not understand or grasp the situation a nd the laws involved. Just as those who should have known better rejected the telephone as impossible because, to quote, \"It is impossible to transmi t the human voice over a copper wire.\" That was true when the telephone was disc overed by Josia Coppersmith, it is true today and it will always be true. It is impossible to transmit the human voice over a copper wire. Yet in spite of tha t, the telephone does work. One might even go so far as to state there is no such thing as a hu- man voice, yet man transmits his thoughts to one another by what w e com- monly refer to as \"speech\" and \"hearing\" in spite of the fact th at man's vocal chords are not transmitters of other than mechanical vibrations and all the so- called sound originates in the skull of the hearer and not in the vocal chords of the speaker. As we asked the question over fifteen years ago, we repeat that question"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Rad ia nt Ene rgy - pa ge 4 now: \"Why should man waste his time and efforts in trying to spli t the atom when nature is doing it all the time for us out in space?\" Why no t use the ener- gy offered us in place of worrying about why grass is green in the hope it will discover for us a new source of energy which has been sittin g on our doorsteps since the World began? The salt of the earth is energy and the evolution of matter and the evolu- tion of forces in the process of the creation of all things. By the proper uses of these natural laws of energy and matter, matter is turned into ene rgy. That is something we all agree can be done, but do we understand that ma n can by the proper use of these same laws take energy and reverse the process and change energy into matter. It is not a question of finding new elements, but of being abl e to use energy and matter in whatever wave length one finds them and of changing them to any desired wave length or frequency by letting nature do our \"a tom splitting\" for us. It is cheaper, faster, more sure, and the potential poss ibilities far exceed any puny efforts of man. I say puny, for, while man may discove r new means of causing explosions and of creating explosives, he has not a nd cannot split the atom. It is merely a question of a change in form, no less matt er and no less energy. We separate energy only to have it join elsewhere. I f we can split the atom actually, we will have split the chain that holds the cy cle of the Universe together and, like one drop of gasoline exploding all the othe r drops of gasoline near it, so will the chain of atoms, go right on splitting ev ery other atom of the Universe, and that cannot be done any more than one can compress water. In the laboratories of the Universe we find the uranium and radium series changing from uranium to radium, radium into radon and radium A, B, C’, D (radio lead), radium E, F, and finally into lead, and if we fol low the process, lead into gold and so on. In the laboratory we have changed le ad into gold and by reversing the process changed lead into polonium or radium F. If this step can be taken either way, is there any reason why further steps cannot be tak- en? This is not a case of splitting the atom, but merely of additi on, multiplica- tion, division and subtraction of the combinations of the atoms, but not the breaking into of the chain of the Universe. It is plain evolu tion of matter and evolution of forces and there is no need in highly overestima ting the accom- plishment under false interpretation of the facts. As frequency or oscillations is the basis of the existence of all animal, vege- table and mineral matter, one could explode matter from any distanc e to which the proper oscillation could be transmitted. Our experiments have proven to our complete satisfaction that stores of ammunition on the land, in the air or on the sea can be thus destroyed. Our experiments have also satisfied us that gravity is akin to , if not an electrical oscillation so well balanced that we might, for the lack of a better name, almost call it a \"Wattless current\" until some force is e xerted to oppose"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Rad ia nt Ene rgy - pa ge 5 its potential and then gravity opposes such force. This means gravity can be controlled and unlimited advancement made in air navigation, with the only concern left being air speed and momentum. There is much of value to be developed in fields that have no t even been touched and about which very little is known in research in the atomic nucle- us. We have made some astounding discoveries in artificial ra dioactivity set up, not by the usual expensive method with the cyclotron, but by the Moray meth- od. A new world is to be entered through ultra sonics, hyper and ultra high fre- quency currents created through the use of certain tube discoveri es working in ionizations as well as electronic action. Too little work has been done with rays or frequencies around 10 6 to 105 A. U., no doubt, because the mechanical means used in working i n this field has been attempted with practically the same type of equipment used in the one-meter field. We might as well try to carry water in a siev e. It is my belief that television also will never be a compl ete commercial suc- cess until the method of approach is changed to a celestial w ave rather than the present approach. One should not enter these experimental fields in the gamma band without the proper protection, for one will be risking his life in this work without a proper absorber. Water, the common means of protection, has proven of little value as an absorber in most of our investigations. Neither has boric acid water or hydrogen gas proven too satisfactory as an absorber. In September, 1943, a letter was written by us on transmutation of metals to some parties interested in mercury experiments, part of which letter follows: In the reducing of colloids from a non-crystalline state to a c rystalline state, the current and rays used must be such as to produce a syn chronous action. It is well known that colloidal \"solutions\" do not obe y the solution laws: the alterations of the boiling and freezing points are inappreci able and the os- motic pressures very small. A colloidal solution is, in real ity, a disperse system, and in the case of attempting to \"knock down\" the suspended metal lic colloid one must cause what might be called coagulation and precipitati on of the me- tallic colloid found in metallic sulfides, chlorides or sal ts of a metal in a non- crystalline form to a coagulated and crystalline state. Now, whatever frequency of current used and whatever ray or rays used, the frequency of the current and the wave length of the ray or ray s used should harmonize so as to blend or synchronize with the natural frequency or wave length of the substance treated so as to produce the synchronous action that will set up a vibration for which we might \"coin\" an expressio n and call this ac- tion a \"Superultra sonic reaction\" between the frequency of curren t, the wave length of the ray, and the vibratory rate of the substance treate d to cause the desired metabolic or catalystic reaction which will result i n, I am convinced, a complete change in the mode of mining. That the mining of the fut ure will not"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Rad ia nt Ene rgy - pa ge 6 be done in the crude ways of the past. Man's work with animals, vegetables, fruits, flowers, and all sorts of animal and vegetable life has shown that he can improve on the things that nature produced. Man must first go to natur e to learn, but then he must learn to improve over nature's ways. I am p ositively convinced that man can improve nature's mineral deposits by making \"colloids\" \"grow,\" if one does not object to such an expression. Or, in other words, speed up nature's action and obtain the same or better results in a fracti on of the time taken by nature. In the catalystic production of metals from \"colloids,\" one mus t remember that like begets like, and one cannot obtain copper from the \"sa lts\" of some oth- er metallic deposit. In the catalystic production of metals from colloids one must n ot confuse this process with the evolution of forces and the evolution o f matter, the former being the process of \"growing\" from colloids, the latter the a ctual phenomena of energy becoming matter and matter, energy. This still is not a p rocess of split- ting the atom, but changing the arrangements of them. The real test of science in modern destruction lies not in the explosion of matter by matter or matter by energy; but energy by energy, \"super\" ultra son- ics against the vibrations of matter. GENERAL STATEMENT Compiled in Los Angeles, California, January, 1939, from Moray note s and printed booklets written by Dr. Moray from 1913 to 1926. See \"Beyon d the Light Rays\" and other publications. This account may lack continui ty. This account will endeavor to give a brief explanation of the Moray Radiant Energy device whereby it is possible to utilize the vast so urce of energy of the universe without a prime mover through the splitting of the atom by the action of the universe not man-made splitting of the atom. The Moray device is not perpetual motion, but it utilizes energy that al- ready exists and transforms it into useful forms. An electrical generator is in the true sense not a generator, as it creates nothing. Electric ity is not made by the generator, it is merely pumped. From that standpoint, an elect ric generator might be referred to as an electric pump and the Moray Radiant Energ y as a high-speed oscillating atom turbine. On page seventeen of the \"Nature of the World and of Man!' (compil ed by the technical staff, Chicago Institute of Technology), we fi nd it states that our planet is receiving energy from the sun continuously at the rate of 160,000 horsepower per inhabitant of the earth at the present time. The following is taken from \"Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency,\" by Nikola Tesla, page fifty-eig ht, written in 1904:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Rad ia nt Ene rgy - pa ge 7 \"Ere many generations pass our machinery will be driven by power obtain- able at any point in the universe-Is this energy Static or Kinet ic? If Static, our hopes are in vain; if Kinetic, and this we know it is for cer tain, then it is a mere question of time when men will succeed in attaching their machi nery to the very wheel work of nature.\" The aurora borealis is considered to be very definitely an el ectrical phe- nomenon produced by the passage of electric charges through the rarefied gas- es of the higher atmosphere. The conversion of matter to energy in the stars is now very ge nerally ac- cepted as demonstrated, and reasoning from what occurs in radioac tive disin- tegration, during which energy waves are radiated, we may conc lude that ener- gy waves of very high frequency are sent out from the stars, o ne of which is our sun. As in the reception of radio waves, so in this case the circ uit is a tuned ar- rangement to respond to the particular wave frequency \"oscillati ons\" which it is desired to intercept. Dr. Moray uses a \"valve\" to prevent return of the energy to the outer circuit and force it to go through the power applicatio n circuit, Experiments have been made at different places many miles away from all power lines, one experiment being given at a point more than 50 miles from all power lines, and 26 miles from even a farmer's telephone. The pl aces for these experiments were selected by the members of the parties making the test and not by the inventor, and the places were not prearranged but sele cted by them as they drove along in their own car, not the car of the invent or, looking for a place to make the test. The device on an endurance test was operated under standard R. R. seals for a total of 157 hours and 55 minutes, when the seals were brok en and the device put under severe strain and tests made for about an hour lo nger and then shut off. Close examination of the device disclosed that all parts wer e in perfect shape and could have been run indefinitely. During the entire test the lights burned evenly and brightly without flickering and there was no change in the brilliancy from day to day. The quantity of current passing through the secondary of the transf ormer is sufficient to burn up wire of that size if ordinary current wer e used, yet there is no heating of the transformer even though there is no circulat ion of air through it to cool it, as it is completely enclosed. All part s of the machine run absolutely cool, regardless of the length of time operated. It makes no difference whether one fifty-watt lamp is used or w hether fifty or more of them are connected to the machine, the draft of current is adapted to the load."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Rad ia nt Ene rgy - pa ge 8 There is not a sound from the machine when in operation, there bei ng no moving parts. In 1931 an experimental demonstration was made in the presence of a na- tionally known physicist, a professor in one of the greatest universities of the country, at which time he noted and mentioned the following: \"That when the oscillators are connected in the circuit, the co ndensers fill slowly, and the longer the current is applied to charge them, th e greater the charge they take, up to their maximum for the applied voltage, muc h as in fill- ing a bucket by pouring the water into it, instead of taking the charge practical- ly instantaneously, as is ordinarily the case with condensers . \"That the lights on one spot are much hotter than is ever the cas e with any current used at the present time, due to the incandescence of the gas in the globes under the influence of the very high frequency that the r est of the globe remained cool. \"That the size of wire in the transformer could not carry the ampera ge passing through it without burning up, if ordinary current were used, yet the wires remained absolutely cool no matter how long the machine o perated.\" \"The above points show that there is developed something whic h is entirely out of the ordinary, and cannot be accounted for on the basis of induction from existing power lines or current from batteries.\" In later experiments tests were made successfully while the device was set up in a moving automobile. Beginning in 1925 many men of science have come from foreign co untries and from the East and West and have witnessed experimental demons trations and not one of them has been able to find any fault with what the y have seen or heard. Names of these men of science will be furnished upon request. These men have had the device opened for their inspection and have pr onounced the experiments wonderful, that the current is high frequency, the col or of the light different, that the device carries many times as much current wit hout even get- ting slightly warm than any other electrical device of like c onstruction known to man today could do without bursting into flames. That the tubes used are far more powerful than anything known to science today. The drawi ngs, cir- cuits and theory have been pronounced by leading men of scienc e as scientif- ically, electrically, mechanically sound and correct. It is generally accepted now by science, and Dr. Moray's dev ice proves, there is energy coining from somewhere. that the earth is surround ed by such a field of energy. This energy, or as Dr. Moray explains it-these oscillations of Energy, are picked up by the device through the oscillators, or neutron bomba rdment. As"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Rad ia nt Ene rgy - pa ge 9 stated, these surgings or oscillations of Energy coming and g oing as the waves of the sea are picked up by the Moray Device because the Mora y Device is tuned to oscillate in harmony with the oscillations of the univ erse. Every oscil- lation, whether large or small, is completed during the same in terval of time. The beat note of time, the heart beats of life, the oscillati ons of the Universe all prove the same great fact that oscillations are all governed by the same cycle of time, completed during the same interval of time, and as I state d before, these waves of energy have a regular beat note of time, coming and going as the waves of the sea, but in a very definite mathematical order of time, coming to the earth from every direction with a regular beat note that might be referred to as the Father of Time, the Sire of Gravitation. This energy has a definite elastic rigidity and density. whi ch is subject to displacement and strains. When the strain is removed, this medium will spring back to its old position and beyond, surging back and forth as t he waves of the sea, and will continue to oscillate until the original pressu re is used up. If the internal impedance is too great, there will be no oscillation s, but it will merely slide back in a dead beat to its unrestrained state. Cutting dow n the resistance to the minimum and by synchronous actions of the device with the actions of the Universe, recovery will be quicker and quicker until inert ia will assert itself and lengthen out the time of final recovery by carrying the reco il beyond the natural oscillation and thus prolonging the vibrations by oscill ation. When the recovery is distinctly oscillatory and harmonics set in the o scillations will go on forever because of the oscillations of the Universe. As I s aid, these electric oscil- lations are not simple oscillations, but surgings with a defi nite beat note of the evolution of matter and the evolution of energy. It is not claimed that all of Dr. Moray's theories are proven, b ut it is claimed that the device works. The results are certain and that in the absence of better explanation as given in the 1931 edition of \"Beyond th e Light Rays,\" Dr. Moray's explanation is as good as any. In explaining this theory in 1929 to a well-known and noted Americ an Sci- entist, he remarked, \"You go in your theory back of the law of g ravitation.\" We may readily take it for granted that a perpetual light, like p erpetual mo- tion, is an impossibility. I say that because I do not belie ve in perpetual light or motion, which, in a sense, is one and the same thing as getti ng something for nothing. In this day and age it is not well to say anything is imposs ible, but getting something for nothing goes beyond my conception of thought. What I have done in Radiant Energy has been and is perhaps rightfully called \"radical.\" Nev- ertheless, of the great number of learned men who have seen and heard of my work, not one has been able to disprove my claims, theories o r discoveries. Among those in question have been some of America's foremost in Science, al- though they have spent from many hours to days on my theory and cla ims and test demonstrations. Hence this further explanation of the Moray theory, on which Moray has spent his time from boyhood."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Rad ia nt Ene rgy - pa ge 10 The facts and theories herein contained are not contrary to idea s that sci- ence has now accepted. They are, however, original with me i n application and when I first publicly advanced them in 1925 they were \"killed\" as it were by those who heard them before they got very far. Be that as it may , I have taken \"Radiant Energy\" and found a means of using it. Heat, light, etc. , are not things in themselves, but sensations or effects produced by this \"Rad iant Energy\" di- rectly or indirectly from matter. Electricity is vibrations or radiation. Where ether. (or if you do not like that name, call it what you will) is quiescent, we see nothing. Light causes vibra- tions of this \"ether\" and it is these vibrations which cause o ur eyes to detect. All substances are really combinations of one primordial substa nce, i. e. elec- tricity, or, in other words, electricity is specifically mo dified ether. Electrons in motion go to constitute an electric current. Ether waves in motio n go to consti- tute an electric current. What electricity is to matter, so is electric force to com- mon mechanical force, and electrical inertia to common inertia. By inertia, I mean the ratio of force to acceleration. Perhaps electric ine rtia might be defined as the ratio of electric motive force to the acceleration of electric displacement. Below will be found some excerpts from some Scientific books . \"ASTRONOMY\", by Robert H. Baker, Ph. D. Professor of Astronomy, Unive r- sity of Illinois, page 303: \"Another problem relates to the apparent lavish expenditure of this radia- tion. Of all the energy that pours forth from the sun, less than o ne part in 200 million is intercepted by the planets and their satellites. Th e remainder spreads through interstellar space with little chance, so far as we c an know, of being re- covered. The suggestion that the sun shines only in the direct ion of material that can intercept it makes an appeal from the point of view of economy, but appears to have little else to recommend it. It would seem tha t nature is squan- dering its resources of energy so prodigally that it must end i n bankruptcy; but we doubtless have at present an imperfect account of the situa tion.\" \"FOUNDATIONS OF THE UNIVERSE\" by M. Luckiesh, D.Ss. Director of Lighting Research Laboratory, General Electric Company, printed in 1925, page V: \"In the far-off stellar crucibles we see the same laws being obeyed as in our laboratories. As we trace down to the almost infinitesimal con stituents of the extremely minute atom we find that apparently it does not exist at all as the re- alistic matter which we have supposed it to be. There at its very foundation it seems to consist of electric charges which probably simulate the motions of ce- lestial bodies * * *. It is becoming more and more certain that the apparent complexity of nature is due to our lack of knowledge. As the p icture unfolds it promises a marvelous simplicity.\" Again quoting from \"FOUNDATIONS OF THE UNIVERSE,\" by Dr. Luckiesh"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Rad ia nt Ene rgy - pa ge 11 of General Electric, pages 41-43: \"The great success of the atomistic principle as it is invol ved in the kinetic theory of matter is one of the wonders of the modern scientific age. It is to be expected that it has found other applications equally fascinat ing and promis- ing. It is now being pressed further into the service of explaining the structure of matter . . . .” \"When Maxwell (1873) propounded the electromagnetic theory of lig ht (radi- ation), his achievement was epochal. The exact manner in whic h the radiant energy traversed space was not known, and the exact epochal e vent was the founding by Planck (1900) of the quantum theory. Here we have the atomistic principle applied to energy instead of being confined to the material of the uni- verse as it had been. In other words, in the quantum theory we ha ve the ato- mistic idea applied to physical processes. We now have the atom of matter, the atom (electron) of electricity, and the atom (quantum) of actio n (a product of energy and time). Planck assumed the emission of radiation (fro m the sun, a lamp filament, etc.) to occur discontinuously. He conceived elements of energy of equal magnitude analogous to the equality of electrons, or atoms of a given element. Radiation or radiant energy is emitted of various wave lengths or fre- quencies which must be taken into account in laws of radiation. . . . Now the physicist uses quanta as commonly as he does electrons and at oms and mole- cules. Bodies are built of molecules, the molecules of atoms , and the atoms of electrons (and protons). Here we see the atomistic principle applied to \"materi- al\" (matter) and then to electricity (What shall we call it?). Finally, a physical process the radiation emitted by the electrons-is divided into quanta. With such pictures of the universe being constructed we may cease to be surprised at anything, but our interest and admiration will grow. Will we e ver get to the final foundation?\" \"One of the most marvelous relationships that has ever been revealed in the entire science of physics is that between light and electricity. Knowing what we do at the present time in regard to the structure o f atoms, this relationship is not. quite so surprising. However, consi dering the total ab- sence of knowledge a half century ago, pertaining to the exis tence of electrons in atoms of matter, the sudden revelation that light (and radiatio n in general) was an electrical phenomena was very startling and revolutiona ry. Even today these persons who are unfamiliar with fundamental physics find i t difficult to believe that energy traveling from yonder star to the eyes is electromagnetic in nature. But that it is so has been amply proved. The atom in those distance stellar crucibles having moving electrons which are emitting electromagnetic waves of many wavelengths or frequencies.

H. Moray 2484 South 5th East St Salt Lake City, Utah. Dear Sir: We wish to thank you for the recent business you have given us, and hope we may have the pleasure of serving you again. For your information we wish to state that in all cases where n egatives includ- ed any of your lights we found them to be of greater intensity than ordinary il- lumination. They seem to burn in the negative to such a degree t hat we found it necessary to cut special masks to hold back the immediate area of illumina- tion in order to obtain any outline of the globes whatever. We found the average negative required about ten times the normal exposure in the area s where lights were used. This is especially interesting as in phot ographing ordinary lights when shining directly into the lens of camera the light outline can be plainly seen even though the negative is dense at point of i llumination and in the case of your lights the only detail possible to obtain ha d to be brought out through holding back dense area as mentioned above.

Hundreds of thousands of dollars are being spent for apparatus wi th which to effect transformations and many of the greatest scientists a re giving their en- tire time to this work. All this time and money could be saved if we would but realize the fact that nature is splitting atoms all the time for us. That is the source of energy of the Universe being given to us free of charge. The Carnegie Institution of Washington, D. C., has its Atomic Phys ics La- boratory. At Harvard University mercury has apparently been turned i nto gold by the cyclotron. This experiment was reported in Washington to t he American Physical Society by Dr. Sherr and Professor Bainbridge. The report shows, however, that the amount of gold obtained was so ex- ceedingly minute that its presence was shown only by an indire ct method. Fur- ther, it is in a form of gold that vanishes rapidly. It decays like radium. With one form detected, after 48 minutes half of a given amount was g one; after an- other 48 minutes half of what remained was gone and so on. Other forms last- ed but a few days. Small amounts of platinum were also formed by transmuta- tion of mercury. A tiny amount of gold was mixed with about a pound of the bombarded mercury as a bait to draw the transmuted gold atoms together. One can see, therefore, that transmutation of metals is an acco mplished fact, something which twenty years ago would have been calle d impossible by the same institutions that are spending so much time and money tod ay on this research. So again it is with great satisfaction that the Research Instit ute and its pre- decessor, the Moray Scientific Laboratories, sees that the wo rk it has been do- ing and for which it was called all sorts of kind (?) names is being followed by others. We say followed by others advisedly, because as early as 1911 the personnel which is now a part of the Research Institute, advanced as fac ts, discoveries of rays of the universe and of matter, which today are being substa ntiated in the greatest institutions of the world. As early as 1925, by a method far less complicated and expensi ve, the Mo- ray Scientific Laboratories, the fore-runner of the Research Insti tute, changed common lead so that it could be heated to a white hot heat befo re melting. Oth- er treated lead which contained no precious metals before treat ment assayed as follows: May 28, 1940, from one ounce of lead treated at Sal t Lake City, Utah, and assayed at the Boaz Mine, Norris, Montana, assayed 35c in gold. Five ounces of untreated soil assayed blank while the same a mount of treated soil assayed at the rate per ton of $122.50 in gold.

Sample serial No. 88193. Test serial No. 7209 made July 27, 1.941, on another sample treated, assayed 70c in gold and 43c i n silver. It must not be understood that this was done on a commercial basi s but in the laboratory just as the results given above that were obtai ned at Harvard. The only difference was that the gold, silver and platinum obta ined at the Re- search Institute was not in such tiny amounts that their presence could only be detected by indirect methods, but that they were in great eno ugh quantities that they could be assayed. They could be milled and separated from the other metals and could be weighed. Furthermore, none of these precious metals van- ished, but still exist and can be examined by anyone. In America and abroad, especially in Germany, scientists have devised the thermal diffusion method which has proven to be one of the most e fficient methods of separating the different forms of isotopes of the e lements. With this method scientists have separated not only the isotopes of chl orine, but those of neon, krypton and others, but again this is an expensive proces s. By the methods used in the laboratories of the Research Institute very in- teresting results have been had with copper, lead, aluminum and ma gnesium. A cheap alloy which blends well with other metals has been e xperimented with, the commercial price will be much less than magnesium, yet the atomic weight is about the same after it is fused by special rays and freque ncies of a Radiant Energy device developed in the Institute laboratories. Successful experiments were also carried on in 1940 to greatly increase the radioactivity of carnotite, uranium and other radio-active substan ces. This method brings results heretofore not obtained by any other method. Hollywood, Calif., May 20, 1942. Dear Mr. __________ With reference to our recent conversations and as a means of cl arifying my position, let me repeat some of the statements I have made to you. At that time and other times I wrote you, among other things, the f ollowing, which I will again repeat: \"It is recognized that in addition to possessing kinetic energ y, the atom is capable of absorbing energy internally. This internal energy w ould Seem to be associated with the configuration of the particles of which t he atom is com- posed. While under ordinary conditions an atom is in what is know n as the normal state, or the state in which we find matter apparently nei ther giving off, nor absorbing energy. The internal energy of the atom can be alte red; for while under ordinary conditions an atom is in what is known as the normal state,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Rad ia nt Ene rgy - pa ge 15 when the internal energy of the atom exceeds that of its normal state it is said to be excited. Excitations may be caused in several ways, a mong which is the collision of the atom with rapidly moving positive or negative particles , or as in the breaking of the lines of force in the modem electroma gnetic generator, which I prefer to call an electric pump, for the electric gene rator does not create the electrical energy any more than the water pump creates the w ater. Kinetic energy is given up, or, in other words, this excitation cause s these rapidly mov- ing particles to give up some or all of their kinetic energy to the atom during the collision. A limiting case of excitation is ionization, in which energy is ab- sorbed by the atom sufficiently to allow a loosely bound ele ctron to leave the atom against the electro-static force which tends to hold it w ithin the atom. An atom which has given up one or more electrons is said to be io nized. It is possible that ionization, or in other words excitation, ma y take place in successive steps through absorption of quanta energy, or, in o ther words, through the evolution of matter and the evolution of forces, matter is continuously changing into energy and energy continually changing into matter. The return of an ionized atom to a state of lower energy is associated with electromagnetic radiation. So also from the process of io nization which may result from a number of causes, and the one we are interested in is through cosmic radiation, electric energy becomes associated with the oscilla- tion or sonic of the universe. The higher the frequency, the gre ater the ioniza- tion or excitation. Or, as I have stated before, matter is sus ceptible to motion; the universe continually changing into energy and energy into ma tter. All ener- gy appertains either to matter or excitation of energy and conti nually passes from one to the other, or in other words, continually possessing kinetic energy. There, at its very foundation, matter consists of an electric charge which gov- erns the very motion of the planets and suns. I consider gamma ra ys or radio activity an electrical action only of a different rate of vi bration. If one, therefore, sets up a sonic oscillation, a sonic osc illation existing in the realms beyond the light rays, one will be in harmony with th e oscillations of the universe, the energy that is coming to this earth continuousl y, oscillating back and forth in a definite sonic. Some call it radio activit y. Relativity theory suggests that radiation of any large amount of energy is accompanied by a like loss of mass. This loss of mass is given up as the loss of energy. If in the formation of an amount of energy we have an ac complished loss of mass, as has been explained by astro-physicists to account for the radi- ant energy of the sun and the stars, it is equally reasonable to believe that en- ergy in returning back to the source from whence it came, is ca pable of again creating mass, and through this process we have a lowering in the potential with no less mass and no less energy. The energy used to driv e any of our great power systems has not been absorbed, it merely sinks back to the place from whence it came, as water over a wheel. There is nothing about this that sug- gests perpetual motion, but it is merely a case of the evolut ion of matter and the evolution of forces. This might be called the economy of the universe, for if it were not so, nature could be accused of squandering her reso urces of energy so prodigally that nature would eventually end up in bankruptcy, b ut doubt-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Rad ia nt Ene rgy - pa ge 16 less in our present theories, we have a very imperfect accou nt of the situation. If we reverse our imagination on what the telescope has taught us of the stellar universe, we will find that beyond the microscope we have the particles of which everything about us consists, obeying every law tha t is found every- where from stellar space to atomic space. We find bodies in m otion and when we think how small the proton and electron are, and yet obeying the same laws of the universe, we may see the economical uselessness of science trying to crack the atom, when nature, or call it what you will, is accomplishing the same thing for us in stellar and interstellar spaces. Why do something nature is already doing for us? Let's use what nature offers as I first suggested in 1926 and again in 1931. In the great laboratories of the univer se we are hav- ing done for us something that far excels in its performance any thing that we may hope to accomplish in our laboratories. Why try to do in our s mall way something which nature is already doing for us? From this concep tion we might see that Democritus came close to a great scientific t ruth in his bold statement, when he declared that all physical phenomena reduced itself to one single item-motion, or, as we might repeat, the sonic of the un iverse. Let me re- peat, do not forget the atom is but a counterpart of the universe itself, and that light and other radiations exert a mechanical pressure upon every object they strike, and that all these radiations are essentially electri cal in their character. There is a breaking down and a building up of the atom continuousl y, and it is the evolution of matter and forces which is producing, eternally , unlimited pow- er. May it not yet be shown that the dissipated energy which result s from so much transformation of matter which has heretofore been unavailable --or we should say unused by us where it has only appeared to be unavai lable -- should now become available to us as an unlimited source of po wer through the Moray discoveries of application of these forces? In the Gamma Rays we find potentials which are equivalent to as much as 2,000,000 volts, yet their wave lengths are not the shortest kn own to physi- cists. In octaves still higher lie rays which are known as Cosmic Rays. Who can draw a definite line and say how much higher other octaves exi st than those of known Cosmic Rays? Our starting point for the discovery of these different rays was electrical conductivity of the air. It has been discove red that conductivity is just as strong by night as by day, so that radiations emitted by the sun can scarcely be the cause of this energy. May we not, then, acc ept the theory that the sun, in and of itself, has no energy, but is merely a rebro adcaster of the great generator the sonic of the universe itself ? That these two, then, matter and energy, are possibly one, is the sum total of all that has been found out during the centuries of constant research, to be judged by that s mall portion of the universe which is visible to man, who is only armed with his infinitesimal telescopes, or with the most powerful spectroscopes ever mad e by man. It is the belief of the writer that all space is saturated wi th energies which are doubtless electrical in their ultimate energies or very c losely allied to elec- trical action. The relation of matter to energy and energy to ma tter then be-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Rad ia nt Ene rgy - pa ge 17 comes the potential of the universe, one continuous series of oscillations, oscil- lating to and fro like a great pendulum across the universe. One might ask, \"How can one get a steady source of energy fro m such surges?\" Could not a steady flow of water be obtained from the surgings of the sea ? The history of every major scientific discovery has proven t hat argumenta- tion on the merits of a discovery, when judged by private inte rpretation of the scientific facts in question, has proven them all impossible and their discoverer a charlatan. The above, with all of the other data which has been furnished you in the past, such as my general statements on Transmutation of Metals; E lectricity in Medicine; the Patent Situation; the Pictures; and the General Stat ement on Ra- diant Energy; Electromagnetic Radiation, written in Los Angeles i n 1939, which contains some quotations from my pamphlet, \"Beyond the Light Rays,\" which was written many years ago and printed in 1931, should be of suff icient help to you in forming a conception of the facts. If you should need additional information, do not hesitate to req uest the same. I would like to further clarify another point. I have not come to you, nor to anyone, trying to peddle Radiant Energy. You came to me in regard to Radiant Energy, and I have tried to help you to understand my conceptions and the facts surrounding the discoveries I have made. If the world wa nts what they have to offer in Radiant Energy, Transmutation of Metals, Ultra Son ics, and Electrotherapy, and the other kindred discoveries that I have made , I am more than willing to help them to do so. If not, I can and will work out every problem by myself. With kindest regards. Most sincerely yours, T. Henry Moray, May 20, 1942 RESEARCH INSTITUTE, INC. 2484 South Fifth East Street Laboratory: South Fourth East Street Salt Lake City, Utah April 17, 1942 Dear Mr. Your kind letter of April 14, special delivery, came last night . Letter writing is such an unsatisfactory method of trying to put o ne's ideas"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Rad ia nt Ene rgy - pa ge 18 over, that I hesitate in trying to express myself by letter, but this may serve to review some points in our minds, which, however, from the conve rsations we have had, I feel are fully understood by you. As to an explanation of my theories of why the Moray discoveri es of Radi- ant Energy have given the results demonstrated, I have in the pa st given many complete accounts to men of science and others. The data you h ave had from me goes into considerable detail proving the fact that the dev ice does all that is claimed for it. Naturally no attempt has been made to give, nor w ill such infor- mation be given, as to why or how the results are obtained. I feel that yo u readily appreciate the fact that from a standpoint of law and pub lic use patent- ability and a general safety standpoint, there is a definite disadvantage in dis- closures up to the time when one has on file in the United Stat es and desired Foreign Countries all applications which it is desired to file . However, the im- portant thing is that the machine or device operates and therefore at this time theories of operation are unimportant. For instance, the explanati on of the \"back rush\" effect of condensers should be sufficient to satis fy anyone as to the operation of the condensers in acting as reservoirs for the di stribution of ener- gy. This is equally true of the statements about the device o scillating in harmo- ny with the oscillations of the universe, in face of the ev idence of operation which is now in your possession, and the data you turned back to me. The conversion of matter to energy in the stars is now very ge nerally ac- cepted as demonstrated, and reasoning from what occurs under radio activ e disintegration , during which energy waves are radiated, we may co nclude that energy waves of very high frequency are sent out from the stars , one of which is our sun. As in the reception of radio waves and radio active waves , so i n this the circuit is tuned and by the right arrangement of our own type of s pecial oscilla- tors, frequencies are reduced so they may be made to respond to the right ar- rangements of inductances and capacities and of a special \"va lve\" of our own construction, to prevent the return of the power to the outer circu it and force it to go through the power application circuit. Ordinarily when a po tential is ap- plied to the terminals of a condenser, a full charge is acquir ed almost instanta- neously, but with the Moray oscillators filling up somewhat as when water is poured into a bucket, the longer the energy is applied, the gre ater the charge taken, up to the maximum capacity for the given potential and freq uency. This was explained in the data you had, that these oscillations of energy are picked up by the Moray device and, as stated, these surgings or osci llations of energy are coming and going in a regular beat note of time. This energy has a definite elastic rigidity and density which is subject to displaceme nt and strains. When the strain is removed, this energy will surge back and forth as the waves of the sea and will continue to oscillate as long as the internal i mpedance is kept within certain limitations and by synchronous actions of the dev ice with the ac- tions of the universe, recovery will be quicker and quicker un til inertia asserts itself and the action will become distinctly oscillatory an d harmonics set in. Then the oscillations of the device will continue with the o scillations of the uni- verse. As stated, these oscillations are not simple oscill ations, but surgings"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Rad ia nt Ene rgy - pa ge 19 with a definite beat note, elastic rigidity and density.

Henry Moray, QUOTING FROM \"BEYOND THE LIGHT RAYS\" (First Written in 1928 from Notes of 1913 to 1918 and First Printed and Pub- lished in 1931) In writing this very short account of the oscillating theory of the Moray \"Ra- diant Energy\" discoveries, one can only touch the high spots a s many large books would have to be written to even in a small way cover the subject. Another difficulty which has hindered man in forming a true picture of the objective world is that mixed blessing -- egotism. In early centuries he could not escape from the false assumption of his own preeminent impor tance, and these same shackles are still prejudicing the observations o f most persons. In reference to electrons, neutrons, protons, and ions: It is my theory in using these terms that they are the energy of the universe, that by some un- known means have become disassociated here and there, and thes e innumera- ble infinitesimal particles of electrified particles consti tute (by the forces they exert and the disturbances they originate) the substratum of what our senses term as matter, and by nature splitting matter the energy of the uni verse is born. Matter is susceptible to motion. Ether is susceptible to stres s. All atoms appertain either to matter or energy, and continually pass from one to the oth- er, thus producing kinetic energy. There at its very foundation m atter consists of electrical charges which govern the very motion of celes tial bodies . . . i. e., radio active radiations of energy and matter. The evolution of matter and the evolution of forces (energy). There are ample writings acknowledging that there is unlimited e nergy in the Universe, but to say one is able to tap this supply is a nother matter. If I tell you there is water, good cold water, in a glass on your table , but you cannot drink it for a million years, what would you think? You know how to get the water out of a glass. Well, it is as easy to tap this energ y now out in space at it will be in a million years from now. If it can be done then, i t can be done now. For me to go into a technical account of how to harness this en ergy, would mean the writing of volumes. The whole thing might be said in t he few words of Nikola Tesla: \"Throughout space there is energy. Is this energy static or kinet- ic? If static our hopes are in vain; if kinetic and this we k now it is for certain, then it is a mere question of time when men will succeed in a ttaching their ma- chinery to the very wheelwork of nature.\""},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Rad ia nt Ene rgy - pa ge 20 This I have been able to do through the use of certain valves and oscillators that I have made and of which doctors of science have said a re the most power- ful devices known to science today. When an elastic substanc e is subjected to strain and then set free, one of two things happens. The substan ce may slowly recover from the strain and gradually attain its natural state, or the elastic re- coil may carry it past its position of equilibrium and cause i t to execute a series of oscillations. In ordinary language there may be a continuous flow of energy in one direction until the discharge is completed, or an oscil lating discharge may occur. That is, the first flow may be succeeded by a back -rush, as if the first discharge had overrun itself and something like a recoil set in. The device thus becomes more or less charged again in the opposite sense , and a second discharge occurs accompanied by a second back-rush, the oscil lations going on until the energy is either radiated or used up in the heating of the conductors. And if your device will oscillate in harmony with the oscill ations of the Uni- verse, or in other words, if the device is capable of synch ronization with the vi- brations of that energy through space, then the oscillations wi ll go on forever. No one can call such an arrangement perpetual motion any more than o ne can call the motion of the earth perpetual motion. My device oscil lates because of the oscillations of the Universe caused by the disintegratio n of matter. Extracts from the notes made in 1918 follow, although they may in a way repeat what has already been given, but are repeated in order no t to break the line of thought. I fully realize that whatever the difficulties in discovering new truths, there are still greater difficulties in getting them recognized, for as Mark Twain said, \"It takes twenty years to get a new idea fixed in the human min d,\" and I should be armed with scant philosophy if I remained for long surprised at the attacks of some, or the exasperation of a certain number of worthy peopl e, and at the silence of the greater number of scholars, who have heard of my experiments. Heat, light, etc., are not things in themselves, but sensatio ns or effects pro- duced by radiant energy directly or indirectly. We speak of generating electricity: To be exact, we only tra nsfer it from one place to another (pump it, if you please). We cannot generate i t because we can neither create nor destroy it. After we have used it to light o ur homes or do oth- er work, it is like water over the wheel -- no less water, o nly the lowering of po- tential. The electricity has only sunk back from whence it cam e, ready and waiting for nature or man to raise its potential, when it again is ready to do man's bidding, or in other words in the evolution of energy it si nks back from whence it came as it is naturally very slowly but steadily being liberated from the ether. Man may by proper means make the process of liberation rapid rath- er than the natural slow way of nature. I fully realize elements maintain an equilibrium by rotations, att ractions and repulsions, but this does not interfere with a transformation o f equilibri- um, which when the transformations of equilibrium are rapid enough b ecome heat, light and electricity, or matter is turning into energy and energy into mat-"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Rad ia nt Ene rgy - pa ge 21 ter. There can be no production of current electricity without an inter ruption of equilibrium. Whatever the quantity of electricity it will produc e no energy if there is no disturbance of equilibrium, that is to say change o f potential or electrical level. When one thinks of the oxygen and nitrogen molecules of the air all about us moving with the speed of bullets and striking us and everyth ing with this speed, one can form some idea of the agitation taking place i n the Universe. The oscillations of the Universe are a part of this agitatio n, although some of them are from .06 to .01 Angstrom units and shorter, they may be made to do the bidding of man. The oscillations of these electrons, protons, etc., out there in space are emitting electromagnetic waves of many wave lengths and frequ encies. In the Moray device we have one frequency on the high voltage or pri mary side, and for commercial purposes, the device is so constructed that the frequency is very much lower on the secondary side. I will now go on to the account promised above on the back-rush effect of condensers and electromagnetic radiation. But first let me state that all radiant energy is now believed to possess mass or something equivalent to it. Mass and radiant energy are even consid- ered to be interchangeable. I am convinced it is active radia tions produced in nature's cyclotrons by the evolution of matter into energy and en ergy into mat- ter. Ether demanded by Electric Phenomena-an Electric Charge a Charge of Energy and an Electric Current a Flow of Energy: To account for the propagation of heat and light and other radiant energy -- we have postulated the existence of a medium filling all space. But the transfere nce of the energy of radiant heat and light is not the only evidence we have in fav or of the existence of such a medium. Electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic phenome na (and gravitation itself) point in the same direction to gamma rays a nd the splitting of the atom by nature, the evolution of matter and the evolution of f orces, or, in other words, matter turning into energy and energy into matter. It is a matter of common observation that attractions and repulsio ns take place between electrified bodies, magnets, and circuits con veying electric cur- rents. Large masses may be set in motion in this manner and acqui re kinetic energy. If an electric current be started in any circuit, corres ponding induced currents spring up in all neighboring conductors; yet there is no visible connec- tion between the circuit and the conductors. To originate a curre nt in any con- ductor requires the expenditure of energy. How then is the energ y propagated from the circuit to the conductors? If we believe in the conti nuity of the propa- gation of energy -- that is, if we believe that when it disa ppears at one place and reappears at another, it must have passed through the interveni ng space,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Rad ia nt Ene rgy - pa ge 22 and therefore have existed there somehow in the meantime we are forced to postulate a Universe filled with matter and energy. When a body is electrified, what we must first observe is tha t a certain amount of energy has been spent; work has been done, and the res ult is the electrified state of the body. The process of electrifying a conductor is therefore the storing of energy in some way in, or around, the conductor in some medi- um. The work is spent in altering the state of the medium, and whe n the body is discharged the medium returns to its original state, and the s tore of energy is involved. Similarly a supply of energy is required to maint ain an electric cur- rent, and the phenomena arising from the current are manifestations o f the presence of this energy in the medium around the circuit. Formerly an electri- fied body was supposed to have something called electricity residing upon it which caused the electrical phenomena, and an electric current was regarded as a flow of electricity travelling along the wire, while the energy which ap- peared at any part of the circuit (if considered at all) was s upposed to have been conveyed along the wire by the current. The existence of induction, how- ever, and electromagnetic actions between bodies situated at a distance from each other, lead us to look upon the medium around the conductors a s playing a very important part in the development of the phenomena. It is, in fact, the storehouse of the energy. Upon this basis Maxwell founded his theory of electricity and magnetism. and determined the distribution of the energy in the various parts of the field in terms of the electric and magnetic forces. The ether around an e lectrified body is charged with energy, and the electrical phenomena are manife stations of this energy, and not of an imaginary electric fluid distributed over the conductor. When we speak of the charge of an electrified conductor we ref er to the charge of energy in the ether around it, and when we talk of the elect ric flow or current in a circuit we refer to the only flow we know of, viz., the flow of energy through the electric field into the wire. Now consider the case of a body changed alternately, positiv ely and nega- tively, in rapid succession. The positive charge means a po sitive polarization of the ether, which begins at the conductor and travels out through s pace. When the body is discharged the ether is once more set free and res umes its former condition. The negative charge now entails a modification of the ether or polari- zation in the opposite sense. The result of alternate charges o f opposite sign is that the ether at any point becomes polarized alternately in oppo site directions while waves of opposite polarizations are propagated through s pace, each car- rying energy derived from the source or agent supplying the ele ctrification. Here, then, we have a periodic disturbance of some kind occurri ng at each point, accompanied by waves of energy travelling outwards fro m the conductor. The phenomena of interference lead to the conclusion that light is the re- sult of a periodic disturbance, or vibration, of the ether, but a s to the nature of the vibration -- that is, as to the exact nature of the periodic change or what it is that changes, we possess no knowledge. From the foregoing we see that al- ternating electric charges are accompanied by corresponding cha nges of state,"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Rad ia nt Ene rgy - pa ge 23 or vibrations, and if the charge be varied periodically and wi th sufficient rapidi- ty, we have a vibration at each point analogous to, and perhaps identical with, that which occurs in propagation of light and of other vibrations higher than the gamma rays and beyond."}]
