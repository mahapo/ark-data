By MR S . B L OO MFI ELD M OORE. New York Home Journal, Volume I I, Ja nuar y, 1896 Long ago Mr. Keely said: “Science must hol d the helm before the commercial value of my di s - coveries can be made know n and compr e hended.\" The spec ul a ti ve manage m e nt prevailing has se ized the reins of guidance so of te n that it has now become neces sary to place the helm beyond its r e ach, in order that this r ichly f reighted barque may not aga i n be diver ted fr om it s proper course. M r. Keely ha s been accus ed of refusing to teac h his process es , but until within five years he had nothing to teac h. I t was Nature's sec r e t s that he was doing battle with and daily risking his lif e to conquer. Since 1892 he has held hi ms elf in readines s to ins tr uct Pr ofes sor Dew ar (t he reside nt physicis t of the Royal I ns ti tution of Gr e at B r itain) in his pr oce ss of diss ociation; one of our be st know n American physicis t s ha vi ng ref us ed t o receive this i ns tr uc ti on, s imply beca use of the “ stock- booming\" operations tha t have invari a bly foll ow ed upon all effor ts of men of s cience ( or of capi- tal) to acquaint thems elves with the merits of the cla i ms made by ot he r s for Kee l y. The article pr epa r e d in 1893, by the R ev. Dr. Pl umb of Bos ton, in its des cr iption of what lh called \"a subs idiary engine,\" br ought f res h dis cr e di t on Ke ely in the opinion of educated and able men, and avalanche s of r idicule fr om the ordinary journalists. The wheel described by Dr. Plum b was not an e ngi ne in any s ense of the wor d. It was a ma chine that is a marvel of construction, en- tir e ly independent of centrif uga l action, for diverting the polar curr e nt of apergy to do i ts work on i ts mec hanical ha r nes s. The Philadelphia Inquirer gave out, in printing this paper, that it had be en written by an eminent sc ientist of Boston. The s tatements made therein were suffi c i e nt to e stablish in the minds of men of s cience the c onvi c ti on that Ke ely, whom they held res ponsible f or the m all, was the “perpetual motion crank\" he had been c alled, and too darkly ignorant of the simples t canons of or thodox physic s t o know t he blunders he w as making in hi s s tatements . W. L. S. , a Bos t on man of scienc e, r e senting t his as se r tion of the Inquirer , undertook to r eply in behalf of hi s ma l igned as sociates , suc ceeding - so well that all men unacquainted with the sys tem of vibrator y physics c onsidered Keely c om ple t e ly annihilated and thought he would never be heard f rom aga in. S a i d W. L. S .: \" T ake the desc r iption of t he s eventy-t w o pound wheel, with eight s pokes and a hollow hub, but no r im, running at a speed so f a st tha t the camera c oul d not catch it and obtain a s har p image. If we estimate, from this and the des cr iption, the pr oba bl e spe ed a nd then allow twenty-fi ve per cent for s af e t y, a nd figur e out the centrif ug al tens ion in the spoke s, as suming bot h spoke s and hub made of the bes t wrought iron, we f ind it would come out some t hing like one hundred a nd fif ty ti mes the breaking s tr e ngth of the ir on; so it se ems to me it would be exc eedingly dange r ous to stay long within range of that wheel . . . . . I wil l end by call- ing D r . Plumb's attention to t he fact t ha t there is in Bos t on, not half a mil e fr om the pos t offi c e, a perpetual m otion machine now on exhibiti on; where the unwary a r e invited to enter, examine and subs cr ibe .

It is no matter of surpri s e t ha t, af ter such an a ppar e nt expos ur e of Ke ely's i gnorance , New E ng- land j ournals which had up to tha t time printed a r ticles defending Keely, refused them after- wards. A brief mention of the helpers on this underground road, which Keely had s o long been traveling without ga ini ng a r a y of light, should be of i nteres t, now that the labyrinth is lighted with the eff ulge nce of \"The Da wn, ” in his disc over y of the curr ent of apergy."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Som e Tr ut hs Abou t Keel y - pa ge 3 of 4 About f ifteen ye ars a go H. O. W ar d became interested in Ke ely's discoveries by hearing two Engl is hmen on board of a s t e amship di s cus sing the nature of t he myste r ious for c e which they had been sent over by the Engl is h Gove r nment to inves ti ga te. Posse ss i ng certain e ccentricities of characte r , s uch as pe r s istency of purpose and a determination to r e ach t he root of things before adopting the opinions of others r ega r ding them, a vis it was made in time to Ke ely's wor ks hop, which eventually le d to the for ming of a c onjectur e that Keely might have di s soc i a ted hydrogen. Upon sugges ting this poss ibi lity to him, he replied: “Perhaps so, I do not know,\" but the sugges - tion fell on pregnant s oil and started Keely into making effor ts to vi brate hydrogen, with s uch re- sults that his f ield of experiment wa s greatly widened. The s ame poss i bility named to L ord R ay- leigh brought t his ans wer: “I wil l bet you ten t hous and pounds he has not; hydr oge n is an element.” “ I know it is class ed w i th the e l e ments,” wa s t he ans wer, “but s cience, s tarti ng with three only, now has over s eventy. Why may not mor e compounds be f ound? ” Lord Ra yl e igh a few ye ar s la t e r r e f us ed to r e peat his bet. In 1884, M acvicar's “Sketch of a P hilos ophy” wa s br ought t o the not ic e of H. O . Ward (by Dr. Andrew of King's College Belfast), who compil e d fr om it “Ether, T he T rue Pr otoplas m .\" The late Robert B r ow ni ng, be f ore r e ading the monogr aph, remarked to its wri te r that the word “protoplasm” was not a s uit a ble one to employ in conne ction with the ether. T he writer replied: “I a m hoping to convince the world of science that ether is matter. ” 1 Dr. Ric har d Garnett, the learned li brarian of the B r itish Mus eum, sent the ma nuscript to t he late Dr. Chapman, then editor of the The Wes t m i ns ter , w ho gave his opinion that i t was fif ty years too soon for its publ ic ati on. The Home Jour nal of iiew York then became one of the he l pe r s on the road and publis hed it en- tir e . Those who cons titute the vanguard of s cience are now ready to receive many of Dr . M acvica r 's views , which we r e not a ppr ec i a ted in his l ifetime. Kee l y at onc e unde r s tood them, and knew t ha t he had imprisoned the e ther ; though making the error of thinking that it was the f orce itself, in- ste ad of the always ne cess ary medium of it s manifes tation in our atmosphere. Thi s w as f our ye ar s be f ore the dis t inguis hed He nr i Hertz, late profess or of phys i c s in Bonn Uni- versity, announce d in t he Revue Scientifique that all our e l e ctr o-magnetic engines held the ether fast bound without this fact having bee n s o much as sus pected. Then, one of the be st-known B r it- ish physicis ts said; \"If we have done this, why is it not pos sible that Ke ely has done the same? ” A copy of “ E ther the Tr ue Pr otoplas m, ” published in 1884, in galley- proof s li ps , was s ent, in 1885, to Profess or Rueker, of the Kens ingt on School of Scie nce, who paid no attention to it, much t o the di s appointment of i ts writer at the time; but in 1889, in an a ddr es s delivered a t Ca r - diff befor e the R oyal A ssoc iati on, he remarked tha t men of scienc e we r e then inve stigating the structure of t he ether, which might prove to be the source of all m a tt e r , and which mi ght yet be use d and control le d as we now use and c ontr ol steam. Pr of. Dew ar se nt a copy of this pape r to H. O. W ar d, who replied with a reques t that the profes- sor would infor m the lea r ned physicis t that Keely had s pent yea r s of his life in vain a t te m pts to use and control it in engines only to f ind that this can never be acc ompl is hed.

I t was on a pa ge of this record of t he wis dom of the ancients that Keely lea r ne d he had c aptur e d one of the c ur rents of a tr iune polar s tr ea m of for c e; and fr om t ha t hour be abandoned all e f fort s to imprison the ethe r in a metallic s tr ucture; devoting his days , and often hi s nights , to the gain- ing of a knowledge of the operations of apergy in natur e . I n 1893 he suc ceeded in demons tr a t ing to his own sa t is f a ction that he had fastened his machinery to the ve r y wheelworks of the uni - verse. 2 Until this time he held thi s “ secret of nature” loc ked within hi s own breast; f or never once, in his near ly quar ter of a century of r es earch, has Mr. K eely broache d a theory until he has prove d it by demonstr ation. The pos it ion taken at the last stockholders' meeting gi ve s evidence that Ke ely's m a gnanimit y of characte r has never be en apprecia t e d by those who have taken advana t a ge of it in their bus iness transac t ions with him . B ut he cannot be forced i nto fur ther c oncess ions nor into fur the r delay. The ultimatum is reache d. T he r is k of the loss of the se discoveries to t he world is too gr ea t to a d- mit of giving one thought t o mistaken and short- s ighted couns els. Scie nce mus t not be robbed of her birthr ight to s atisfy the gr e ed of M ammon. Ther e are f rom twenty to thirty instruments to be patented in Ke ely's sys t e m of s ympathetic vi- brator y physics . Months of va l ua ble time ar e lost, whic h might have been occupied in prepara- tions f or t he taking out of patents , had K eely's generous pr opos ition been acc epted a s promptly as it de served to be. The s pir o-vibrophonic s ystem alone requires eight or t e n patents ; the r e so- nating five or six mor e; the vitalizing six, which must be precede d by the s etting up of a vibrato- ry dynamo that would take w eeks to c onstruct and gr a duate. T he s ympathetic transmitting s ys- tem w i ll r e qui re months, with its adjuncts , to get into a patentable condition; and the s ympathetic governor of course must be patented if the other ins tr uments are. Mr. Kee l y will not again yie l d his judgment to t he wis hes of others, as he did in thi s ins tance to his co-wor ke r ; f or both have see n the f olly of it. F rom the fir s t he has maintained hi s c onvi c ti ons that no physic i s t will be able to s tand by him until his work i s c om ple t e d; owing t o the ma ni pula - tions in s t oc k that have f ollowed any c onsent f rom dis tingui s hed m e n of s cience to witnes s his process es , each ti me H.

Kee ly's syste m s will now be brought out on royalti e s f or the benefit of the sha r e hol de r s and of the w or ld, inste ad of for monopolies.
