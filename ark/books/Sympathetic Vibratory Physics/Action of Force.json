Keely's late st dis covery—that of the spiro-vor tex action of curr ents of force—is so over- whelming in its simplicity of demons tr a t ion that it needs but to be w i tnes se d to c onvince phys i- cis t s that vibr a t ory physics will pla ce s cience on a height never before a t ta i ne d.

Keely spe aks of this di s covery of spiro- vortex a ction as a n acc i de nt; but there is no s uch thing as ac cident in di s covery. While seeking to es tablish in his new instrument a way by which a neu- tral ce nt re could be more s im ply and def initely f ixed, he resorted to an experiment that he had never m a de be f ore. His indicator was regis ter ing about one hundred revolutions per s econd, in- duced by the curr e nt at a rate of nearly two hundr e d thous and movements in the s ame time, whe n Keely held the conducting wir e agains t s ome cotton f ibre at the open e nd of a tes t tube. To his surprise, upon its r emoval he f ound that the tube wa s cut through and thr ough, s pir a ll y, from the interior , breaking t he glas s at the top in it s pa ssa ge out, but leaving the tube othe r wis e intac t . Up to this tim e Kee l y had been wor king on the theory that t he action of the cur rent was circu- lar in the polar a nd depolar cir cuits of the propeller of his air- s hip, both in the i r separate and i n their combined action. But ther e is as wide a di fference between tr uth and c onj e ctur e as there is betwee n facts and theor y.
