The simple existenc e of Qua nt um Arithme- tic tends to support the idea of ancient civili z a- tions, and the legendary f e ats they could per- for m. The sophistica t ion and r igor w hi c h is achieva ble in Q uantum Arithmetic points to- ward the Atlantean Civili z ation of 12, 000 years ago. M ost of their literature was de- stroyed w hi le it lay in t he libr a r y of A l e xan- dria. We cannot recla i m those 600, 000 to one milli on volum e s w hi c h were burned. We do have several s urvi ving pi e ces such as the Rhind M athematical Papyrus, The Egypt ia n Leather R ol l, the Mos cow P a pyr us and a f ew others. We als o have the r e covered portions of Euclids Geome t ry. Several others have sur- vived t o give us confidence that Q uantum Arithm e ti c is on the right track. Quantum Ari thmetic s eems to start out with or dinary math. It leads us on a far dif fer- ent path t o Quantum Numbers use d by nature. These number s take on whole new and dif fer- ent meaning in a s cientif ic context. I t continu- ally branches out to cover all areas of curr e nt math pr a ctices and belief, disproving some of those beliefs. T here are ot he r branches whic h reach into entir e ly ne w ar e as. Many of these new areas will occ upy rese ar c hers for dec ades . These t hree volumes of Pythagoras And The Quantum W or ld break prec edence with the past.

Conve nt iona l mathematics is a n invente d device. Qua ntum Ari thmetic is entir ely Natu- ral Math as nearly as it ca n be understood.

The pr e vi ous proof s of Qua nt um Arith- metic take Number theor y and turns it int o Number Law. A better under s tanding a bout prim e numbers allows one to f orm s olid proof s of the theories of Number T he or y. T his leads to a ddi ng other features which exte nd the Law.

T he y are commonly termed, \" harmoni c \" fr e quen- cies . T he vibration may be (1) the tone of a musica l tone, or it c an be (2) the ene r gy state of a n elec tr on of an atom. it can be (3) the s pe- cific qua nt um color of a bea m of light. (4) it could be a single mus ical tone. It all depends upon which Myriad we a r e conc erned with a t the t ime. We ma y take any one of thes e four \" gates \", but it is most a ppr opriate. to ta ke the gate into music be cause we understand the full seve n octaves . In the ca se of matter and electrons. Ther e are als o se ven octave s in t he Peri odic Table of E lements , but m uc h of our knowl- edge is tied up in theory. It would be inappro- priate to take t he M yri a d of Li ght bec ause we have only one of the seve n octave s. Although the M yri a d of Sound energy is one Myriad, it extends upwa r d into the M yr ia d of Ultr a Sound.

It is ver y pot e nt in emo- tionalism a nd brain functi ons . So we lea r n to extrapolate, from one Myriad to another , as we travel down t his straight and narrow path, when and where e xtr apolation is valid. We must r emembe r the r e is cha nge ratio of per- haps 10, 000 fold i n the unit of meas ur e whic h applies . The S ub-s ound Myriad is impor tant to us beca use i t contains f requencies in the same range as our brain and nervous sys tem. It is als o t his r a nge of frequencies which control our emotions.

I t sta r ts with the beginning of the s t raight a nd narr ow way. (Shown in Table I in the appendix of this book). That beginning was in the ca l c ulating and organizing of the i nte ger s f or each pri me Pythagorean triangle into a block of 16 or 20 numerical values . Each of these blocks fell into an increasing numer ic al se quence f or the root \" b\" in vertical li ne s, in columns across the page. There are also inc r ea sing value s for root \"e \" i n the horizontal li ne s across the page. The growth of Quantum Ar ithmetic begins with the investigation of the great number of prim e Pythagorean tri a ngl e s. In the beginning of ac cepted ( male), tri angles , each has a base dimension which is divisible by f our. Each al- titude is an odd number f or male tr iangles , a nd an even ( 8n) number f or the female t riangles . Each tr iangle c an be teste d in that the s um of the s quar e s of the bas e and alti tude will equal the square of the hypotenus e. Thi s f ur- ther r es tr ic t s the number of right triangles which apply to Quantum Arithmetic. It ap- pears that ultim a tely there are only a bout 10,000 such tr iangles which m e et the require- ments. We are s pecially concerned with the fir s t 5040 tr iangles . The number 5040 is the \"magic \" number which is equal to 7 or 1x2x3x4x5x6x7. Ever y such triangle has four r oot numbers which are all prime to each othe r . T hes e have been given the des i gna ti on of \"b, e , d, & a\" and a r e a r ranged in s uch order that b + e = d, and e + d a. . In ot he r words t he y f all in Fibo- nacc i configur a t ion.

It consis ts of four integers, of which the two center ones are pr ime to each other a nd the r ema i ning ones are the s um and dif ference of thes e two. According to E uclid's pr oof, a l l four numbers will be pr ime to the t w o center num- bers.

That is the bas i s upon which t he whole ar rangeme nt of creation is se t, i n order to maintain everything related to everything else, but yet unique f rom each oth- er.

TABLE 2 i n appe ndi x B , has bee n che cked, but i t should be f urther c hecked by the reader. The first check, w hi c h wa s applied, wa s that Y + F = W. Since W was derived from W = de + K and the \"de \" can be take n as C/2, the f ormu- la W = F + Y che cks K f rom the ellips e, a nd als o checks C and the r oots a, b, and d & e.

The va l ue of \" e\" als o starts w i th a value of 1 a nd continues down the page to 7. After t he se values are en- tered in all f our pages , the next two va lues a r e added in the top line of each block. These a r e \"d\" whic h is d = b + e, a nd a= e+d. The next operation is to ca lculate the four values in the se cond line of e ach block. T he y are B, E , D, and A as squa r es of b, e, d, and a, respec ti ve ly. The r ema i ning operations s hould enter the value of each e nt ry in all blocks of the table. The legend is given on t he top l e f t corner of the first page . So the value of C = 2de, is add- ed to line t hree of e very block.

G = D + E is the thir d entry on the third l ine of eve r y block. L = abde/6 is the fourt h e nt ry on the third line of every block. The fourth line of all blocks ar e H, I , J, a nd K, which the legend s ays are related to circles and ellipses . T hey are e nter e d in the order of: H = C + F f or the fir s t entr y on the fourth line. I = C - F or F - C giving the abs olut e value, (positive va lue) , of t he diff e r enc e betwe en H & I, for the s econd entry of the f ourth line. J = bd, is the perigee of an ellips e for the thir d entry on the fourt h line. K = ad, is the apogee of an ellipse for the four th entr y in the four th l ine . Thi s completes s ixteen entries on Table 1, leaving only four mor e t o c alculate in the fifth line of each block, for the r emaining four en- tri e s. Thes e all per ta i n to the Equil a t e r a l and isos celes triangles. If any pr e vious entr y was change d in a given bl oc k, the entries of W, F, Y, and Z will cha nge in t ha t block.

F = F , (fr om a bove) f or one division of the bas e, and Y = C + E, for the other di vis ion of t he base of t he triangle. One can se e that Y + F mus t equal the s ide of this tr iangle, or Y + F = W. Thi s provides a n int e r im che ck on most c alcu- lations up to this point. The t w enti e th a nd las t entr y is the length of the line which wil l divide the tr iangle. I t is Z = G + C /2, or Z = G + de.

Several charac t e r is ti c s of night- side energy have be en found. (1) It is as sociated with cooling rather tha n heating. This i s the most notable c har a cteri s - tic.

In a highly deve loped anc i e nt civilization, s ome aspec ts of nights i de e nergy appea r to have been brought about by a s im ple but c oncentrated menta l eff ort. One narr a t ive des cr ibe s the simple dr a wing of a cir c l e on the ground wit h a c r os s within the circle. Through mental eff ort, a Nightside flame is pr oduc ed in the c ir cle so long as the cir c ul a r li ne is un- broken. It i s a consuming flame which will cons ume any material object which i s brought in contac t with the flame. O t he r tha n that, the flame a ppears to utilize only aetheric e nergy for it s fuel. T his ene r gy can a ppear in a ny for m that conve nt iona l energy often appears. Joha nn E rnes t Bes sier was born in Zattu Germany in 1680. He was generally know n as Orf fyreus, and in 1712 he gave a demonstra- tion with a three-f oot diameter whee l, on which it is s upposed that he had placed s pe- cially ground harmonic conch shells. Whe n this wheel wa s s et into motion it would contin- ue unabated to rotate until physically stopped. In 1948 John Roy Robe r t Searl , at 15 years of a ge, had cons tr uc t e d a s mall model in his kitchen.

Ther e are gene r al f ea t ures which produce Nightside energy. This has been pri nc ipally electricity, but mos t ha ve demonstrated some levitation qualities as well. Another effect is that Nightside energy see ms to have a cleans - ing a nd balanc i ng eff e ct on the environment. Nightside and Da yside energi e s a r e every- where in paired and bala nced qua nti ties . In that state, neither one i s manif e st since they counter one a not he r . If one of the m i s re- moved, the other becomes manifes t in its ef- fects. Ther e a r e probably thousands of ways in which this new e nergy can be pr oduc ed, as we have see n in the reporting of acc i de nts whe r e harmonics ar e involved.

We agr e e that there are four f orces which, probably s hould be considered, but P rofess or Searl is probably cons ideri ng energies rather than f orces . We may be talking about the same thing but on diff e r ent levels . In the end, he is probably considering t he s ame geometric con- figur ation in w hi c h he will pair up a thi rd pair which is , again, at ri ght angle s to the fir s t t w o pairs.

When we bring in Qua nt um f requencie s, some amazing things happen a nd amaz ing re- lations between them de velop. Apparently Sparky Sweet reached the t op of the M yr ia d in which he was working and the device we nt out of c ont rol. It created a violent uncontrolla- ble a etheri c energy vortex, and the device be- gan to levitate. Ess entially the sa m e thing hap- pened until P rofess or J ohn Searl learned to control it in his Inverse-Gravity disk. Searl ap- pears to have learned how to contr ol it to a point, that he appears to have gone f rom one Myriad to poss ibly two Myriads above with the three \"ri ng-plates \". E a ch of thes e rings a nd their r unne r s gr a duated the ene r gy to a higher level in the next higher Myriad.

Knowing the mathematica l parameters of energy will he lp to understand when the dan- ger can become a pr oblem. Knowing a prob- lem may be developing, one can take pr ec au- tions as Sparky did by l imiting hi s device to Five K - watts . But t he r e can be other unknown a nd unpre- dictable dange r ous events. Pr ofes sor S e ar l a nd his \"Law Of The Squares\" enabled him to op- erate in, ( a nd know he wa s operating in), a \"qua nt um mode\" . Dr. Elkins, now r efines t ha t fur ther. The bigges t pr oblem is that M usic of the Spheres sets up some powerf ul harm onic s. That is the energy we are tr ying t o tap. In ordi- nary engineering thes e harmonics may devel- op ac cidentally, c ausing a complete failur e of a des igned structure or de vi c e.

T hat j udge ment cannot a l w ays be tr us ted, beca use it may be flawed by an emoti on of calmnes s and over-conf idenc e on the one hand, and by the emoti on of f e ar on the other extreme. These are both evident, and I have created both of them in demons tr ation. Lor d Rayleigh was absolutely wr ong I n sta t ing that a fr e quency pr oduc es all of the harmonics above it . H i s proof is abs olut e ly backwa r d. Muc h of our knowledge about e l e c- tri c al frequencies has Lor d Ra yleigh be hi nd its theories. If he w as wr ong, then how much else is w r ong? Energy cas cades f rom a M yr ia d above. T hos e higher ha r monics exist as wa ve- lets which cas cade to the lowe r M yr ia d, thus creating t he s i ngle tone we s eem to hear. On the technical side , the mathematical Pa- rameters of Energy w i ll help one avoid, or a t leas t be aware of danger spots i n the res earch, which we are doing. J ust do not l e t the units which you a r e cons tr ucting, do you in, be- caus e of ignorance of the mathema t ica l param- eters and what t he y may portend in the areas of t he unknown.

All units of meas ur e are r e lated to one another, whether they a r e t he measurement of an atom or e l e ctr on, or meas ur ements on the cos m ic sc ale. Natural f reque ncies occur within this meas ur e m e nt s ystem. Ther e is de f inite relationship between the Pr ime Pyt ha gor ea n T riangles and the L aw of the Squares as used by Pr ofes sor Searl in his generation of the Searl Ef fect through the Ma gic Squares .

The mathematics of the Zero- Point Energy was disc overed ne arl y 30 years ago, but did not go beyond that, to se e exa ctly what it was . It se ems that Einstein's \"B lack Holes\" have gone dow n the drain. T here is a s mall grain of trut h to them, but there are e xt e nsions of it which are ve r y wrong.

The e lectron's wavelets w i ll interact with the wavelets of electrons in adjacent atoms pas sing t he i r energy to, or from , the m through the weak force thus pas sing on and movi ng the energy. Jus t t his one c hange in interpreta- tion begins to explain many anomalies whic h are f ound in conventional scie nce. The electrons are bonded to the nucleus by the strong f orce of the male/female bond. B oth electrons and protons are formed of dens if ie d aether, which for med them in their origi na l creation. Quantum Arithmetic defines the diff er- ence betwee n malenes s a nd femalenes s. In general the odd numbers de not e \"male\" and the even num be r s de not e \" f e m a le\" in the ancient ter ms . T his is found to have modern connotation. Ther e is a great de al more to this in that male and female have strictly defined mathematical characteris- tics. In thes e c har a cteri s tics, we f ind that the differ e nce betwe en the c onventional energy and Zer o-Point energy seems to foll ow along with thes e s ame generalities. The ge nerali ties ar e hot vs. cold, gravity vs. anti- gravity, or levitation, a nd elec tr ons vs. protons. With that i n mind, it see ms that t he pro- tons of the atom should relate to Nights i de energy, and the electrons seem to de not e conventional e ner gie s. T his se ems true s o long a s w e dea l only in Quantum s t a tes. Thi s distinction di s appears in the pres ent chaotic a ppr oximations of c onventional sc ience. We seem t o be ready to go deeper into s ci- entific terms and definit ions . Not onl y have black holes dis appeared, -- they are defined in diff erent terms than we have us ed until now. A black hol e s eems to occur at the top of M y- riads of the quantum E nergy, but we do not have to dea l with tha t ri ght now.

If thi s proves out, it is a new beginning in scie nce. The be gi nning has to be made f irst in our mathe m a ti c s.

I t i s the natural mathema t ic s of t he futur e without a ny invented de vices or ar tificial rules. It operates within the divine rules of Nature and proves them a s it goes along. So long as one f ollows the rules, many things become a ppar e nt. B ut one must a lways be aware that, a l though cer- tain features are \"apparent\" , t he interpr e tation is c r itical.

C onventional scienc e makes an interpretation, which is not valid. T his turn of events has been s o rampant in the pas t t ha t it has thrown conventional scienc e into cha os. Ther e are two prime examples. Rayleigh's \"proof\" that a s ingl e tone produces innumera- ble higher harmonics, is one example. T he other is the much older di s covery by Fi bona c- ci and \" His Series\" . Today, s uch misinterpre- tations, are practically a daily occurr e nce.

In summation: All of our e ner gy c om e s di- rectly or indi rectly from an active a ether which is in a continuous s tate of vibration, a nd varying s tates of dens if ication or rar ification. The e ner gy fr om the aether c onsist of four kinds, all of which a r e in perfect ba l a nce.

We are not yet able to relate an obje ct to its Q uantum Number, becaus e many objec t s w i ll have com- plex m ultiple or \"chain\" Quantum Numbers. The orbit of our Moon i s one of thos e c om ple x Quantum Numbers becaus e it is a combination of two Qua nt um Numbers which crea t e the Li s sa j ou Or bit of the Moon, rather than a sim- ple elli ps e.

For a better understanding of how \"har- monics\" operates, and the mathematical laws which are involved, one should s t udy the chapter in Volume 11, which i s e nt itled \"Syn- chronous Harmonics\" .

H A R M O N I C S - - I T I S T H E L A W With regrets, I send my c ondol e nces to Lor d Rayleigh. Thes e condole nces are also be- ing s ent to the s cientifi c community for the acts of L ord R ayleigh. Har monics is not as Lor d R ayleigh so inaccurately proved. T his has put sc i e nce int o a s pi n for the past century. Ther e is a flaw in his mathe m a ti c al proof . He employed time reversal, unknowingl y in his proof . Some scientis t s began to s ense the true con- ditions required of H ar monics and knowingly, or unknowingly circumvented R ayleigh. T he \"trans positions\" which be came s o nece ssa r y in clos ed circuit telephone s ystems , wa s made nece ssa r y by thi s m is understanding of har- monics, but they were put in for the wrong reasons . The harmonic r e sonanc e of tall build- ings f or seis mi c protection, has never be en a full s ucces s, becaus e the wr ong parameters have been utilized. The e xpl a nation of w hy the female voice is one or more octave s above the average ma l e voice, a lso de pends upon a corr e ct expla nation of the r ole of harmonics. But, to explain how harmonics wor ks , it is nece ssa r y to go bac k to the ver y beginning. What R ayleigh pr oba bl y wa s proving, and ca n be logically proved a s he tried to prove, was the time-r e ver s al as pect of harmonics and sound. In s hor t, the proof was backwa r ds . A single audible sound doe s not produce a l l of its higher harmonics. T he higher harmonics are a priori to the audible sound, even though thes e higher ultr as ounds cannot be s ense d as sound. In our material world, these higher har- monics begin at the sc ale of the atom and its electrons. For the proof of this , one mus t go back in mathematics to s tr aighten out some misunders t a ndings which we r e fi rs t given to Ra yl e igh, and to scienc e. The pr oblem goes back to mathematics be- caus e what we us e, is an invented mathemat- ics . It is not the natural mathematics which was used m ore than t w o thousand yea r s ago. So w e mus t be gin with the ancient t imes . We must fir s t di s cover the laws w hi c h gover n this mathematics . W e must dis cover the real us e of the prime num be r s , where all m a thematics be- gins. The prime numbers li e behind a l l mathe- matics . We must e ventually adopt this mathe- matics . When we f ina l ly adopt it, mathematics will become a primary a r e a of res earch. It will not be the dr y and dull mathematics w hi c h is taught today. It will become exciting and ad- venturesome, in learning the laws which a pply and how they ca r ry over into and be yond the most advance d sc iences of today. Ma ny of our definit ions within mathematics are awry and/or def icie nt . T he defini tion of prim e num be r is one of those de f initions. T he impor ta nt aspe ct is i n one integer be ing PRIME TO another integer. Any indivi dua l integer can be prim e only whe n there is a t leas t one other integer to which it is pr ime. The fir s t thing which becomes clarif ie d is the reas on and the place of twin- primes. In ef- fect, all so-called prim e numbers are one of a"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"24 pair of twin primes . So l e t us start by going through and lis ti ng them up to 100. T hey ar e : 5-7, 11-13, 17-19, 23-25, 29-31, 35-37, 41-43, 47-49, 53-55, 59-61, 65-67, 71- 73, 77- 79, 83- 85, 89- 91, 95- 97, 101-103. Note t he tot a l ab- se nce of the pr ime number 3.

The fir s t s eeming exception to pri mene ss is the use of 25, which is followed by 49, and the next s imil a r exception is 121. Any power of a prim e num be r , is fundamentally pr ime and takes the pl a ce of its root . In harmonics , the squa r e of a def ined prime number is prime, and it will s upersede and m inimize the p hysi- cal a ppl ic ation of its r oot. Thi s begins to ex- plain many things within ha r monics . T his anomaly fir s t showe d up in Synchr onous Har- monics and the. inter a ction between e nergy waves . The s econd exc eption cons i s ts of another type of pr ime number. T hes e are integers which have two smaller pr ime f a ctor s . In the above li s t, these are: 35, 55, 65, 77, 85, 91, and 95. 35 = 5x7; 55= 5x11; 65= 5x13; 77=7x11; 85=5x17; 91 = 7x13; and 95= 5x19 These are products of 5 or 7 and a larger prim e number, being 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19 in thes e ca ses . Fr om the above analys i s it be comes very apparent that the i nte ger \" 3\" plays a s i gnifi- cantly differ e nt part. O t he r t ha n 1-3 and 3-5, there a r e no ot he r twin primes with the factor of 3, which can be one party of a twin pri me as c an 5, and 7. The int e r vening number in any twin pr ime is divisible by 3 and there a r e four integers between twin primes. T hes e a r e the only two types which have not a gr ee d with our conve nt ional defini tion f or t w i n pri me s.

In or de r to understand the NAT- URA L mathematics, one mus t relate the con- ventional definiti ons to the definit ions as the y occur i n NATURAL ma t he matics. In tha t re- spe ct, the ne w definition of prime numbe r will not be exac t ly the s ame as the conve nti ona l definiti on.

Ther e i s too much detail withi n Q uantum Arithm e ti c t o give i n this text, but it is pos si- ble to tell some of the basics , which a r e famil- iar. One of the basics of Qua ntum Arit hme t ic utilizes what are called \"Fibonacc i type num- bers\" , but it is fir s t neces sary to c l a r ify our un- derstanding of Fi bona cci. He gave us wha t he could glean in his time. Wha t he gave us is far fr om complete . A more complete de scription is that given in Euclid Book VI I, Pr opos iti on 28. \" T h e sum of two nu mbers which are prime to each ot her , are also prim e to t hem. The dif ference of two numbers which are prime to e ach other is als o prime to t hem. \" Thi s gives us a series of f our i ntege r s in the Fibonacci confi guration. B ut let us go bac k 1500 ye ar s be f ore E uclid, and we find they als o used the se 4 intege r c om bina t ions in their calcula t ions in the Rhind Ma thematical Papy- rus. In thi s f our i nte ger combination, the third integer is the mean of the f irst a nd f ourth. T he se cond is their vari a ti on f rom the m e an. T his is presently a part of \" St a t is tical Analysis \", s o we are s til l on familiar ground. We begin to l e ave f a mi liar gr ound when we study the method of mult iplication as us ed in Quantum Arithmetic. This w as taught up to 80 years ago, but has now be en ge nerally dropped from our educ ation s ystem. The s ystem of multiplication of two inte- gers, in Qua ntum Ari thmetic, is to cons ider they are the f irst and f ourth integers of a Fibo- nacc i c onf iguration. Their product is found by the subtraction of the squa r e of the i r variation fr om the s quare of the i r m e an. This is one of the ba sic operations within Quantum A r ithmetic, Only the f irst and fourth integer are required to s olve any pr oblem i n Quantum Arithmetic. They, along with their sum and diff erence form the four \" r oots \". With these roots, we ca n s olve any problem, but it is fi rs t neces sary to f ind the corr ec t prim e ratio betwe en the mean and the varia- tion. Quantum Ari thmetic provides the means to pe r form this operati on. The operation is called \"Quantizing\" but the rest of Qua nt um Arithm e ti c mus t be explaine d and unders t ood, in or de r to comprehend how and what the rules are. Esse nti a ll y, the sec ond a nd third integers of the Fibonacc i confi guration, become the squa r e root s of the vari a t ion, and of the mea n betwee n the Hypotenuse and the Altitude of an unique Prime Pythagor e an T riangle. T he origi na l t w o int e ger s are the s quare r oots of the s um and diff erence of t he Bas e and the Hypotenus e of tha t s ame Prim e P ythagorea n tri a ngle. T he square r oots of thes e four squa r es , a r e the four integers w hi c h ar e the roots of the s elected pr oblem and the y will be in Fi bona cci confi guration and are the Quan- tum Numbe r of that t riangle. They are als o the roots of all ot he r pl a ne geometric figures, in- cluding the equilateral tr ia ngl e , the isos celes tri a ngle, the ellipse, and a s er ies of the e ll ips e, and a s eries of integral c oncentr ic circular fig- ures. The numbers 59, 1, 60, 61, in Fibonacc i configur a t ion are cons i de r ed to be the Quan- tum Number of E arth Or bit.

Once a ny two of the r oots a r e obtained a nd proper ly quantized, it is a simple m a t te r to de- termine all of the pa r ame t e r s of a n orbit ing or vibrating body. A n exa m ple will pr oba bl y demons t rate the procedure: In fi nding t he precise or bit of the E arth- Moon sys t e m about the Sun, the perigee of the orbit will be the smaller number, and the apo- gee will be the l a r ge r number . Thes e two num- bers, in whatever units, will be put thr ough the \"Q uanti z e\" Proces s. They turn out t o be 59 and 61. Their mean is 60 and their variation is 1. Multiplyi ng 59 t imes 60 will give us 3540 quantum units of the perigee. Multiplyi ng 61 times 60 will give 3660 f or the quantum units of the a pogee. If our or iginal i nput is in mi le s, we find there are 25834. 3 miles* per quantum unit. Ther e will be 240 poi nts i n the orbit around the S un in which the meas ur ement's in quantum units will be integers of quantum di s - tance fr om t he Sun, and wil l also be i n inte- gers f or the dis tance f rom the se condary focus of the elli ptica l orbi t.

It will also be poss ibl e to calculate the pre- cis e distance, at any precise t ime, in r e ctangu- lar coordinates from the S un. W i th that c alcu- lation it is pos sible to plot the precise pos ition of the Earth/ Moon syste m within a tolerance of one mile ac cur a cy.

The Quantum numbers , and similarit y be- tween Quantum numbers, will then tell whe r e bonding will likely take place between t w o elements , a nd at what energy state, and i n what proporti ons they will combine, as well as give t he relative strength of the bonding. Thi s pr oce ss is too complex and detailed to des cr ibe here. T his is where har mony comes in. There is har mony betwee n ene r gy sta t e s of atoms, just as there is ha r mony betwee n the various planets of our planetary syste m . T he sa me s ystem of harmony also applies betwee n the c ol ors of the rainbow, and i t applies to notes of mus ic. This latter, is where the Music Of The S phe r es c om e s i n.

It points out so ma ny of the deficiencies , omi s - sions , and err ors in our sys tem of theor ie s.

In the Myriad of Mus ic, e ach octave ha s four prim a r y notes which are produced by the ordi- nary bugl e . T he y are C, F, A , and C. As blue is ha lf the w avelength of r e d, s o is the upper C one octave a bove the w avelength of the lower C note . So, w e can a ssume ther e ar e seve n oc- taves in the M etaphysica l Myriad.

This a l l started in 1942 w hen I was com- pleting my f inal course in ca l c ulus. Yes , I un- derstood the c alculus, but a thought kept run- ning thr ough my mind that, \" T here must be a better and m ore di rec t way to pe r form these mathematical operations . \" W it hin ten ye ar s I was on the w ay to the dis covery of this anc i e nt mathematics . B ut let me say, I will eve ntually be given c r e di t for the di s covery. but t ha t credit i s mi s placed. My only contr ibution was to follow through. As Socrates said, \"I ca n teach a boy all there is to know without t e l ling him anything. I will as k the boy ques ti ons and he w i ll der ive the ans wers fr om his own mind. \" That is the way Qua nt um Arithmetic was developed. While I wa s as leep, I would be par tially a wak- ened and a ques ti on would be placed in my mind. I could not go back to sleep as the ques - tion was aske d over and over for wha t seeme d like hour s on end. Quite some t ime later I di s - covered that I could get up and write down the ques ti on, with the intent of answ er ing it dur- ing t he next day or days . T hen and only the n could get a sound sleep for the res t of the night. The ne xt day I w oul d ans wer the ques - tion, a nd that is the wa y Quantum Arit hme t ic was de veloped s tep-by- s tep ove r a per iod of 50 years. Now I w i ll skip to the ending which was in Augus t 1988. Thi s was after s ome 40 years and between 5, 000 and 10,000 se parate ques - tions I had to ans wer and after I had develope d Quantum Ar ithmetic. I had been ke pt awake for thr ee days a nd three nights exc ept for a bri e f 2 or 3 hours of sle ep betwe en 3 and 6 AM.

Then he answe r ed me with a s i ngle word, -- \"Archimedes . \" I mused on that for a while and then t old him that I must mow the lawn for the e xer c ise, but it als o neede d mow- ing, being more than an acre i n size , and ha d not be en mowed for over a week. I the n, went out to the equipment shed where my riding m ow er was kept a nd s tar te d it up. I mowed the outer pe r imeter of the law n and wa s half way through with t he second round when Archimedes said, \" I 'd like to do that!\" I was t ired and thought I would get off the m ow er for only a minut e . But i t was only my as tr a l body which got off and went out to stand or, the lawn. Archi- medes took over a nd f inishe d m ow i ng the lawn. I marvelled as he clipped by trees a nd other obstructions by le ss t ha n on- ha l f inch a t a full t hrottle and about 10 mile per hour spe ed. I s tood in the middl e of the l a wn the whole time in my as tr a l body, s eeing a s mall strip of gras s here and there that he ha d miss ed. I wondered how he would corr ec t that, and he did. He finished the lawn i n the highes t spe ed in 40 minutes, which was half t he ti me it w oul d have taken me. I put the m ow er awa y and Archimede s had di s appeared. I (di d not se e him again f or more than thr e e years, in which time I started writi ng the prese nt edi- tions of P ythagor as A nd The Quantum World . I went to the hous e a nd got s ome food a nd much needed rest. That was the end of Archi- medes . Archimedes ha d given me the ques t ions to ans wer over that pe r iod, from about 1946 t o 1988, f or me to learn Quantum A r ithmetic. The questions w er e qui te regular with thr ee to five ques tions e ver y week in that 40 years. So, there were be tween 8000 a nd 10, 000 e ncoun- ters with A r chimede s. It is Archimedes to whom credit must be gi ve n f or this redis cov- ery of Qua ntum Arithmetic. I des er ve onl y the credit for following through on hi s que stions. All of his e ar ly ques tions led up t o the ques - tion, \"is the r e s ome kind of order to the Pri me Pythagorean Tr iangles ?\" ( The ans wer is in Ta- ble 1). T o ans wer tha t ques tion, I ha d to fir s t derive the F ibonac ci type Numbers which lea d to e ach t riangle. To ge t the F ibonac ci numbers in the proper context I had to read and res tudy the e nt ire 13 Books of E uc l id. It was Proposi- tion 28 i n Book VI I of Euclid, which wa s the key in this cas e. June 1976 1 was given the ke y between the Pr ime Pythagor e an Tr ia ngl e s and what tur ne d out to be P rime (Quantum) Elli ps es . T hree years later in 1979, 1 was into the s oluti on of Mus ic Of T he Spheres, a nd sta r ted to deve lop that music, which I continued well up int o 1991, for about 12 years. That is a very brief history of how Q uantum Arithm e ti c wa s developed. B efor e Archi- medes would acce pt my a nswer to a question, he would always have the additional question, \"W hy?\", and I had to gi ve him the pr oof, These proof s would be give n a l ong the line of \"Proofs\" which were give n in Chapter I X of Volume I of \" P ythagor as And The Q uant um World \". Another s i milar exa m ple of devel- oped pr oof is given on pages 124 & 125, in Volume 2 of \" P ythagor as A nd The Q uant um World \". Quantum Ar ithmetic has now begun to take, its place in the search for New (aetheric) Ener- gy. Mos t, if not all, of thes e res earchers will have to incorpor a t e it in the i r s earch, to reac h suc cess .

I t was on my mind, ques tioni ng what r e ally happene d behind the s cenes . In 1989 I joined a local Dowse r Society. Dows ers do not just find water s our c es. T he y learn t o have acc ess to a much wide r knowl- edge. T hey have a question and the f irst thing they as k of \"a higher power\" is, \" Can I; May I; and Should I inquir e to that cert a in s ubject?\" If the ans wer is \"No\", ther e w i ll be no sea r c h even though no reas on is given. I f the ans wer is \"Ye s\", t he n the Dows er is allowed to pro- cee d. W e are not allowed to i nte r fere with the lif e and well being of another. N or ar e we al- lowed to acc ept gratuities f or our work. One of the fir s t t hings I inquired into was my ow n se lf and c ondit ion of my ow n s pi rit. I was told by ot he r dows ers that I had two spir- its, and a kir illian photograph a lso s howed a diff erent a ur a on the two s ides of m y head. I dows ed the ques tion and it wa s true. T he other Dows er said it appe ar e d that my sec ond spirit was f oreign. I dows ed, and found the second spirit was f rom the Star sys tem of S irus. His spirit had wanted to reinca r nate on Eart h. He wanted to learn mor e about our human s ocie- ty, but did not want t o go through the child- hood or a dolesce nt ye ar s . He ha d been a major ruler of one of the Nations in his Star System. It wa s he who walked me out of the woods af- ter I died. He s tayed with me thr ough the heal- ing proces s. What wa s unus ual was that he agreed to a c- company my orginal s pir it in his learning pro- ces s. We would both live together in one, body. Thr ee or four years ago, another Dows er who is a clos e and dear f riend, conf e ss ed to me that tie was a \" Walk- in\" since he was in his t e en years. He f elt then, 50 yea r s ago a nd feels now, that lie is s till a for eigner in this land. He desc r ibed his li fe as a \" walk-in\", It was then t ha t I realize that I wa s also a \" part walk-inâ. I kept track of my two s pir its through dows ing. About the first of 1996, my or iginal spirit decided that it wa s ti me to move on, since most of t he books were written conc er ning my pas t 50 years of r es earch in Quanturn Arith- metic. Thi s left me in the good ha nds of my \"w alk- in\" spiri t, but all of my original memo- rie sta y with me. I have neve r - bee n pr ivy to the pa st memories of my \" walk-in\". My origi- nal s pir it has moved on beyond the As tr a l plane while the Sirus s pir it has put on this old overcoat of a body. He is able to keep it going in s pite of s erious setbac ks.

This in- volves s everal octaves in the mi ddle portion of the Me t a physical M yr iad, pr obably the third or four th octave f or memor ies . The \" consc i ous \" is that pa r t of the uncon- sc ious which applies only to the materi a l world. Ther e ar e several sta ges of the uncon- sc ious. The par t of the uncons cious which re- tains the his t ory of an i ndividual s oul, is ca l le d the memory, and the memory of that soul lives on even a f ter the body di e s. When a spirit returns t o Ear th in a new body, the uncons cious also returns to the new body at s om e t ime a f ter birt h. T he r e a r e records, in I ndia, which s how cas es of the s oul not being joined to the body until one child was six years ol d, but generally the soul joins the body at or shortly after birth. W i th the joining of the s oul to the spirit, the memories of the previous earthly lif e will r e t urn to t ha t child. Parents a r e so prone to er a se t hos e prior memories becaus e they are i n the c ontext of a time per ha ps two hundr ed years e ar lier. Sure- ly, s om e of the memor ies ar e outdate d, but the child will reorganize, and save those memo- ries which are in c ontext with his or her new lif e . T he outdated memories will be bui lde d upon a nd revised to meet conditions. After many lif etimes e ach soul can gain e nor mous knowledge, and part of that knowledge is \"K now T hys elf \" . In the stateme nt , \"Know Thyself\" one must know their soul which has been term e d by var ious na m e s. One of those names is the \"uncons cious\" of a person. Thi s brings us to the ver y reason f or our be- ing. Our being on Eart h is to gain knowledge.

These ar e given as a basic e xamples of the problems which c onf ront us i n gi ving our s oul a cha nce to expr e ss i ts unconsc i ous memor ie s. But therein lies a n answer. T he s pir it and s oul is a microcos m of the universe. T his soul does not need to be educa t e d, beca use it already has all knowledge. It has a l l of the knowle dge of the pas t , but being free of the s pace/time di- mens i on, it als o has all knowledge of the fu- ture. We do not recogniz e this beca use ver y few are in t ouc h with their uncons cious, or with their soul, to that depth. Ther e ar e two ways to get in touch with our soul. One way is thr ough meditation, but it is a very unsure wa y becaus e thos e untr uths in our cons cious me m ory ge t in the wa y. We can not be sure of, or tr us t the r e velations w e receive through meditation. T he other w ay is the natu- ral wa y which has been set up through the laws of C r ea t ion. It is a slow and tedious wa y but its res ult s a r e s ur e, i f one follows the other laws of Creation. One pa r ticular s et of laws are t he laws of Love, Cha r ity and Gratitude. Thi s way l e ads to the gaining of knowledge and tr uth at ea ch s ojour n on Earth. Ma ny have run a f oul of these laws in their progr es s toward perf e ction.

My present Si rian spirit wanted a short sojourn on E a r th to persona l ly learn and ob- se r ve Ear th's human civilization. The first thi ng about which we must l e ar n the tr uth, comes in the term \" Know T hys elf !\" What is a human being? We have come to a c- cept that our capabilities are s o r es tr ic t e d t ha t there is not much hope. T his is not true. T he human be i ng is a micr oc osm of the univer s e. Each human being is capable of anything which c an be imagined. But ea ch person mus t know themselve s f irst. Those who believe we are s uper intelligent, t e nd to ignore any inf or- mation about a s pir it or s oul . T hey call them- se lves \"s keptics \", a nd probably will always be. The hum a n being is much mor e than jus t a body. The body is only the temple i n whic h the major pa r t of the human being, resides for a time. We need, to drastically cha nge our thinking about the space time dim e nsion. These apply only t o the mate r ial wor ld i n which the human body resides . Beyond this there is only the spirit and the Soul . A major problem aga i ns t a ny cha nge, comes fr om our interpr eta t ion of s pir it and soul. The interpre- tation of today w as t o us by or ga nized relig- ion. It has no scientific ba sis. I n the quantum world each octave is per- mitted to have 5040 frequencies , but only the 144 are strong enough to be cons i de r ed s epar- ately. T ha t leaves 4896 frequencies which a r e much weaker quantumwise. Of the 144 fre- quencies us ed 12 to 18, are much stronger than the r e st. Of this 12-18 frequencies , seve n fr eque ncies are still s t ronger, and of these s ev- en the r e are four which are rea l ly i mportant. Thi s see m s to e stablish an hierarchy within eac h Myriad a nd within the s ystem of octaves of eac h Myriad. We find this hier a r c hy in mu- sic , Matter, and Light . I s this s ame hier a r chy found in t he M etaphysica l Myraid? We can us e this generality extend to the other four Myriads of e ner gy being the first, Creation; t he s econd, M etaphysics ; the fi fth, Ultra Sound; a nd t he seventh, Sub- s ound. B ut there ar e other generalities which can als o be use d to study these four miss ing M yr ia ds. They are miss i ng pri ma r ily becaus e we do not have the se nsory organs to perceive fr e quen- cies in these other four M yr iads . We have als o failed t o es tablish any empir ica l number val- ues in t he m. We have s ome e vi de nce of the Meta physi- cal Myriad. W e c an a ss um e there are seven octaves , but cannot prove it. If it does, it would se em tha t the lower octaves will s tart with the Spir itual domain. Quite poss ibl y the Christ spirit is in the s eventh octa ve or the top of the Myriad. Can we find a way to fi t other methaphys ical artif ac ts within thes e intermedi- ate octaves ? Thi s pr oble m c annot be solved overnight. If we keep working at i t like I have w or ked for over 50 years in developing and r e covering Quantum Arithmetic, it is pos sible that this problem can be concluded. Possibly the bigges t part of the problem is f or one to over- come the tendency of the general population to tr y to maintain the status quo a nd r efus e to disc uss the M etaphys ical M yr iad in any terms. It is only a mental block br ought on by a us e- les s t a boo in our civil iz ation. All things which are created a r e c r ea t e d out of the e ner gy of the aethe r . The more the aeth- er is dens if ied the m ore complex w i ll be the thing which is c r ea ted. So, t he metaphysica l Myriad consis ts of a s eries of bound ae ther ic energy fields which are les s dense than the matter of which we are compose d.

From thes e anc i e nt repor ts , and from our prese nt anec dot a l repor ts , it is pos sible to tr a ce a trail which one travels fr om lif etime to lifetime.

T he r e is the person's spirit hove r ing over t he dis card- ed body and looking down on it and its materi- al surroundi ngs of famil ia r people and things. As f ar as the f loa t ing s pir it is c oncerned, the y have e nter e d a period of timeles snes s, so it is imposs ibl e for a victim to know how much time pa sse s, in t e r ms of time on Eart h. The next step along the way is the appear- ance of a long tunnel which invites the spirit to enter. I n my own ca se, this long t unne l se emed to be a metallic pipe about twenty f ee t in diameter and wa s s naking away towa r d the north. In my own ca se, I was determined, and s aid, or gave out the thought, \" I can't go just now. I have much work still to do in Q uantum Arith- metic\". With that I w as still in the as tr a l realm. My unconscious body was being c ar ried, or manipulated to walk in the unc onscious state for nearly a quart e r mil e . Dur ing thi s wa l k there w er e a few incide nt s in which consc i ous - nes s returned for me to ma ke cons cious deci- sions a bout the pathway back to safety. My spirit sa vi or did not s eem to know where I must go f or home and sa f ety. In betwee n these moments of l uc idi ty I was again unc onscious but this tunnel fol lowe d me all t he wa y bac k to my door. I n f ollowing me I not e d that it se emed to pass through the objec t s whic h were in its path. I knew nothing of the w alking back home.

One of my f riends rece i ve d hi s walk-in when he was 16 years old. He did not spe ak of any accide nt but he said there w as a sudde n turn in his personality a t that time. He is now 70 years old and tells me that he knew he was not like other people. He felt out of place in any group of people, and does so, t o t his day. It was m a ny years be f ore he he ar d of wa lk- ins and knew immediately that his spirit was a walk-in. He ha s lost his c hil dhood memories and had memories of having li ve d in a dis t a nt galaxy in outer s pace. The sec ond friend is much younger, be ing in his mid 40's toda y. At some di fferent ti me and plac e he voluntarily came to Earth know- ing that the civilization he de cided to enter would be bac kward and pri mitive. He feels some what out of place here. He has lived he r e to experi e nce the e ar th-living in many coun- tri e s and c li mes . He is a scientis t of much a c- complishment. I n a previous lifetime he was bril liant. In his work he pi loted a spa ce s hip fr om s ystem t o sys tem gathering inf ormation. It wa s an advanced mentally evolved soc i e ty to which he be l onge d then. E ve n now he gets input from metaphys ical areas which are be- yond anything which contemporar y s cience has c onsidered, or wil l even begin to consider. So he does not talk to many people a bout thes e strange thoughts. He is a walk-i n w i th a spirit from an extr a terr e strial s pace. His conce r n today is with t he greedy. Their lack of t rus t has them fearf ully gatheri ng mor e and more fears, caus ing mor e and more imbal- ance . T his must be cor rected and harm ony re- stored. For him he must s tay res erved not do himself too much harm while still using the fr ee dom that i s granted him. Fr om these two fr iends I have learned muc h about walk- ins . Fr om the othe r two I know lit- tle e xcept they ar e also of extra- terrestrial ori- gin, I find many parallels between their stories and my own pr e sent conditi on. That is a poss ibili ty in my cas e. I n these cas es, the ne wly occ upied body, ( mine), re- tained its memor ies . The bac k gr ound and ob- jectives of the ne w walk-in is generally adde d on to current memories , but was not in my cas e. These pe r s ons who now admit they have a \"w alk- in\" spirit had notice d no appreciable change until others had told the m about a \"w alk- in\" . The new spiri t wil l ge nerall y con- tinue the sa m e agenda, and will try not disrupt the previous existence . It will be a mor e ad- vance d spirit tha n t he one it is replacing. T he walk-in spiri t will also have adde d memories and ca pabilit ie s which the or iginal body ha d not lea r ned, but any such pr e vi ous memories are pass es on to me only ve r y wea kly.

By t his time, many will be saying, \"B ut what has thi s got to do w i th Qua nt um Arith- metic?\" It really has eve r ything t o do with it. Thi s is the domain whe r e Quantum Arit hme t ic got i ts s tart. I f it were not for tha t , and the many years spe nt in developing Q uantum Arithm e ti c and then deve lopi ng the proofs, we still would not believe the r e could be another way to use number s to t ie e ver ything together, as well as the development of a us eable c alcu- lation method. In the past ove r 2000 years ago, the devel- opment of philosophy originates with mathe- matics , and wa s well deve l ope d by the G r ee ks, the Arabs, a nd Egyptians. I f t he reade r under- sta nds Qua ntum Ari thmetic suffi c iently, it i s a logical c onclusion that ther e are s uch things as atoms.

I ndee d, thi s fourth dimens i on 'in the Me taphysical Myriad i s the heart a nd soul of Quantum Ar ithmetic. Thi s chapter, and the next, attack the one obsta cle which stands in the way f or the adop- tion of Qua nt um Ari thmetic. The one reas on that Quantum Ari thmetic has not been adopt- ed, is that it ha s run into a s tone wall of taboos which have been pla ces within our s ociety. One of t hos e taboos is that children are t a ught that it is impr ope r f or them to have invis i ble \"playma t e s\" . I t is pos sible that Q uantum Arithm e ti c can be started a s earl y as kinder- garten, if the proper devices , t oys and instruc- tion are given to them. By t he time children have developed a knowledge of the ba sic a r ithmetic of addition and m ultiplication, they a r e r e ady to be gin study in e arnest. Whe n they can get started on working out the T able which starts the ball roll ing in the first text book, QA - 1, they a r e ready to c onti nue with the le ssons . E ven be- for e that, if t he y can operate a pocket ca lcula- tor, they can begin working on that t a ble, in QA-1. This is pr e cisely how it wa s int roduce d in one cas e, to t hree children in a family. Ther e was an a m a zing transition in a ten- year old boy, the younges t of the thr e e, whe n sa w tha t the numbers in the table were running in many dif ferent number s er ie s. He no longer had to calculate the numbers in ea ch block. He could just go to t he next numbe r in the series which he saw and had selec t e d. H i s eyes light- ed up and he be came very excited about fin- ishing the ta bl e . That never happens when a child s tarts t he rote lea r ning of arit hme t ic.

I allowed him t o tell me about his \"invis i ble playma t e s\" and the times whic h he spent with them. Wha t he had to tell m e w as very emotional with him. He wa s s o tied up up up wit h these mem- ories that his parents were having extr eme dif- ficulti e s wit h him.

A s pecial part of every vis it was the r itual of feeding the fish in my tr out pond. After that we would do other things fr om picking apples or be r ries, working in the ve getable garden or any other work I had schedule d for m ys elf. I gave him and his parents some copies of the tapes . Thi s boy has now grown and has become a respons ible 15- yea r old who is very adult i n his activity.

He still had no r e cognition of t hos e people about whom he had previous ly been so e mot ional and ec static. So I changed the conversa t ion to the pr e sent. Those \" play- mates \" had be en e r as ed f rom his c onscious memory by the very society which could have eventually be en able to recover s om e of the technology, which I pres ume is still within his subc onscious memory.

Ever ything in the woodlands was s oaked a nd wet and there w as much mud on parts of the trail. I had m y r ubbe r boots on my feet but Billy onl y had canvas tennis s hoes.

He would s ometimes come over to a ccom- pany me on these f ee di ng excursions. We would talk on these wa lks. R ather early on, I had told him of a book I had been r ea ding about John Tyndall, the sound r e searcher of the 1870's who ha d dis covered that there a r e certain, (unexplained) times when high pitched sounds travelled much f urther than low pitche d s ounds.

Sometimes, un- expec t e d t hings happened. But most of the time it was only the r oar of the jets whic h would be hea r d. One day whe n walking t o feed the fish, Bil- ly noticed the high pitched whine of a plane pas sing over he ad H e remarked, \" T his will be a fall- down day. \" He w as e ss entially saying t ha t the high pitched whine portends a time of a c- cidents or mis f ortune. It was many years befor e I fully unde r s tood how he had made the c onnection. I was s oon to le ar n that B i lly had memories which s eemed to date 2000 to 8000, or more, years ago, and we will s oon get into that. it eventually occurr ed to me tha t leaders in those early ti me s depended a great deal on their ora- cle advisors. The oracle's attention to conditions may have included lis tening to the pitch of the pre- dominant sounds . T he n the oracle may have for ec ast some of his or her prognos t ic ations on the ba sis of whether the sounds were predomi- nantly high or low pitched, or mixed.

His memori e s containe d nothing a bout dea t h. He was fi rs t a soldier, then a L ord, the n he was a hunter. He had not se par a ted them i nto dif ferent lifetimes. I ha d not told him of my pa st life memories, but this las t was certainl y Atlantis. I t se ems that B illy and I had li ve d i n the s ame country a t the sa me tim e in some of his recountings of his pas t lives. I had lived in Atlantis in 11, 000 B . C . a bout 1000 ye ar s be f ore the sinking. Plato cla i me d that i t sa nk about 10,000 B.C. The story B illy tells of Atlantis is ver y much like the de scrip- tion which was given in the book, â Dweller on Two P lanets \". I have pr e sent memories of having lived on Atlantis, as a scie nt is t, in roughly that same time f rame but about 1000 mi le s wes t from the C apitol. I had not t old Billy about my memories nor did I tell him at t his time. He conf irmed a week or s o later, t ha t he knew me in a nother lifetim e , perhaps 1000 years af- ter the sinking. Billy previous l y mentioned the \"ve r y dee p snow\". I had aske d B ill y a bout this. Billy told of living in a cave a t the hea d of a valley only a mile or s o from the se a- shore. He told of ' a plane flying over he ad a nd dropping a bottle on a parachute. I ns ide the bottle was a piece of pa per , but no one in the sma l l tr ibe could r e ad it, eve n though they ha d ancient books hidden in the ca ve w hi c h had the same wri ting in them. I remembered the books and I couldn't read t he m either at the time but I knew nothing about the bottle with the m e ss age. I believe thes e were the books which Nos - tradamus; f ound in s outhwest Fr a nce, and later burned. He sa id they contained information \"from the ancients .

H e was becoming more a t eas e with hims elf and re- laxed both here and i n his home. He had not corr e lated his memories with today's ha ppen- ings but was more at e ase with them. It is quite clear that he was dea l ing with much more than the one lif e ti me which he cons id- ered i t to be. Two ye ar s ha d pa sse d and I ha dn't s een Bil- ly, in that time. I as ked him \"How are things with Bayalla? \" His ans wer wa s a blank stare. He ha d abs ol ute l y no r e collection of Baya l la or what I was talking about. Billy had his brains was hed out as far a s those memories were concerned. Only two years be f ore, he had ha d such a n emotional attachment to B ay- alla, that I could not imagine it not s urf ac ing now three years l a t e r . There was not a ves t ige of recognition of t he name \"B ayalla\". Thi s chapter gets a long way f rom the m a in subje ct of Q uantum Ar ithmetic. Billy's story was so real to him that it gives us an i de a of how the br a in, the spirit , and memor ies work. I believe t ha t as Billy grows to adulthood, a nd then ages a bit, he will be gin to r e member some of these s tor ies . His s ubconsc i ous will have put them in a mor e rea sonable perspe c- tive for him, as his worldly know l e dge gr ow s. I believe they wil l r e side in his subcons cious and only be r e member e d when B il ly decides to reca ll them. Be t w een lif e t imes , thes e memories mus t have resided somew her e as a n organized fi e ld of energy in the ae t he r , poss i bly attac hed t o his spiri t i n another dimension.

But one must sta r t with the beginning of the gene r al organization of our cr e ation under the l a ws of Creation. Ther e is a dr a stic change in the idea of cr e a- tion as given to us by Genes is. T he ver y top level of creation i s Creation its elf .

T he se laws , then produce Creation and man af te r se eing this , creates the God to which we pr a y. W e pray to God, but it is Creation which he ar s a nd grants our prayers. We ca n pr obably s ay that Creation is God, \"The Creator\", and below God is t he s par k or spirit of the Christ Spirit. This Christ Spirit governs all r e li gions , - - not jus t the C hr is t ian religion.

T H E V T A - A cas e in point is that of the VTA pr ojec t by F loyd \"Sparky\" Sweet. He had develope d the VTA, ( a bout the s i z e of a breadbox) to the point that he could draw e nergy f rom it. It was not the size of the machine but one pr operty of the energy he wa s pr oduc i ng, which c ause d his probl e m. I t was cold energy or as some called it, \"Zero- Point- Ener gy\" . It was the sa me as that, which these books call, \"Night- side E nergy\". The proper ty was tha t t he ma- chine would fur nis h as much ene r gy as Sparky des ir ed to draw f rom it. That was the beginning of his dow nf all. He told me that he could draw five ki lowa tt s from it. But if he went to anythi ng above that, the machine would begin to l e vit a te, i n pr oduc ing this extr a powe r above 5 kilowatts. In addition to that it created a mas sive energy fi e ld whic h for med a howling vortex. It was apparently a n aetheric vortex. I t bega n to shake the gr ound and the surr ounding countr ys ide. T his is wha t Sparky told me over the phone. H e had to di s - able the VTA to gain contr ol of it. Be that, as it may, Sparky we nt ahe ad a nd obtained a pa tent on the VTA. Now having the patent pe ndi ng, he s old manufacturi ng r ights to one of the major auto make r s . He neve r di s - clos ed, to me, the s um but i t allowed Sparky to build f or hims elf , a fir s t clas s r e search la- borator y, (Which he t old me c ost $40,000). Thi s money, a ppar e ntl y was fur nis hed by his financial source, on the strength of the li- cens e he ha d s ol d to the auto maker. One ye ar later Sparky had still received no money from the L icens ee auto make r , Sparky told me. Sparky never told me the amount to be pa id him for the licens e, but he tol d me other things of eve nts which ha d occ ur red earli e r . -- His fi- nancial source was pres suring Sparky to sell to them the complete rights to the VT A , or to agree to stop any f urther de velopment of it. I do not know who his f inanc i a l s upport wa s, but it was implied that it was some corpora- tion in the e ner gy busines s. He s aid that, at lat- er date, three men dress ed entirely in black had c om e to his door and de l ive r ed a physica l threat to S pa r ky. He could not identify them, but they were ver y fr ightening. Sparky was e m ploying the s calars and ve c- tors of quaternions in deve l oping the VT A.

At this ti me he would ref e r me to his \" helper\", who was not r e ally studying either. I phoned him again about the middle of June 1995.

My l a st call to Sparky was on July 5th, 1995. 1 had a feeling that Sparky wanted me to call that morni ng, but I ha d nothing spec i a l to te l l Spar ky.

And since I started int o this dis cuss ion about dif ficulty w i th provi de r s of f inanc i a l as - sis tant, I was told that seve r al moving trucks came in the very ne xt day and hauled aw ay all of Sparky's records , data, and equipment, in- cluding t he two books I had se nt him. T ha t brings thi s t o a close . So, what is the a nswer to this pr e di c ament? The ans wer to this pr edic ament is quite sim- ple. The answe r is to w or k small and DON'T GET GREE D Y. I s ee in a n adve r tizeme nt , in today's m a il that a health pr oduc t , which can be manuf a ctur e d for less than $2 pe r gallon is being s old for as much a s $60 per half pint. The r es t of the cost is in packaging and mar- keting, but it doe s not run the cos t up t o $60 per half pint, which amounts to $960 per gal- lon f or a product which costs le ss than $2 to produce.

I t may dis appear and re- appea r at a dif ferent pl a ce, giving the appear- ance of movement. That i s exactly the way I perceived it during my NDE. All of t he pic- tures I s aw wer e stop-fr ame pictures. If t he r e was movement, it w as shown as the pos iti on befor e the move, and anothe r picture after the move. Thi s be gi ns to explain the paradox of con- temporar y s cience of \"is it a w ave? Or is it a particle?\" I t a ll depends upon the dimens i on in which s omething is considered. All particles are in third- dimens ion. All ene r gy is in the higher s o- called, \" f ourth dimens ion\". To br ing this down to earth, cons ider mak- ing a movie of a s peeding automobi le . On the fil m it will appear as a series of stop frame po- sitions of the automobile, at intervals of 1/16 of a second. I n televis ion all the pictures on the s creen ar e stop f rame at 1/32 of a s econd. Our viewing it from the third dimension gives us the appea r anc e of movement. In r evie wing the t e chnology we fi nd no te chnology in the Me taphysical Myriad which dis closes a ny movement. E verything is s top f rame. I t is as though time and m ove ment, or spac e, ceas e to exis t . I n this M etaphys ical Myriad it may be poss ible to move forward or ba ckward in tim e / spa ce. So, that is the reas on that it is all but im pos - sible to picture energy f rom our s tation within the third dimension. T he s ine wave of e ner gy is a compilation of c onsidered s t op-fr a m e pic- tures, as we try to make a smooth tr ans ition fr om one condition, or position to another. It apparently cannot be done. . It i s another di- mens i on and it is all qua ntum in N atur e. At any give n instant it e it he r \"it is\" or \"it is n't\", depending on whether the pictur e is quantum or whethe r it is in third dimens i on. Thi s is a big jum p to make in studying ener- gy. We ca n c onsider it only in the thir d dimen- sion. This makes it dif ficult to se parate the NIGHTS IDE reac t ive ene r gy fr om the Day- side male, active, energy. In knowing a bout the Dayside and the Night s ide energi e s, we learn more a bout the M etaphysica l Myriad. In the colors we can s t ill s how the r e sults. In nearly any other type of energy the pictur e will be virt ua l and can not be visualized by us . Ener gy is simply a vibr ation in seve r a l dif- fer e nt modes . W e unders t a nd fr e quencies or periods, and wave l e ngths, but that is not s uf fi- cient to sa y that we unders t a nd ene r gy. We can deve lop a n unde r s tanding in the differ e nt modes of vibr ation. Ther e are three. In stee l strings, one mode is simply a la t e r al vibration. In t he second there ca n be a circular vibration, and the thir d is longitudinal and r e lated t o compress ive vibr a t ion. John Tyndall these dif- fer e nt m ode s in the 1870's, but his results a r e not expansive enough to make compa r is ons in various materials or densities of the vibrating materials. In s tudying the two forms of energy, we must know more a bout the Metaphys ical M y- riad. I t is sort of a catch-22. I n order to know more about the studying t he two, Days i de / Nightside, f orms of energy, metaphysic al M y- riad, will help. Ther e have bee n rese ar c h res ul ts from vari- ous recent New Energy projects . The results show there are several differ e nc- es be t w een conventional e nergy and Nightside energy. (1) They are complimentary t o one another in the range of color . (2) T he y are opposites in r es pect to temper- ature and heat. One heads f or solar tempera- tures, the Nights i de heads downward to frigid temperatures to a bsolute ze r o a nd poss ibl y be- yond. (3) Nightside energies ar e related t o anti- gravity and then suppos edly, Dayside e nergy leads to gr avitational pull.

T he r e are als o thought ener- gies , which are apparently a t a very high fre- quency, and pr oba bl y near the top octaves of the M etaphysic al Myriad. One conce ntr ate d area of t hought ene r gy is to be found in the practice of dowsing. Thought e ner gy is stored as an e ner gy field. Quite often that energy field is s tationar y and can be located and i de nti fied by a dowser s ep- arate fr om the dows er who cr e ated it. Re m ote dows i ng is practice d by mos t dows ers after they ha ve beca m e prof icient at on-site dows - ing for anything. D O W S I N G I N T H E M E T A P H Y S I C A L Dows ing se ems to be an anoma l y to mos t people. Many, i nc ludi ng Dows ers, know ne xt to not hing about how dowsing works. The cu- rious part a bout it is tha t nearly anyone with the wil l to do s o, can become a prof ic i e nt dows er wit h pr ac t ic e, pa t ie nce, and experi- ence . We can be sure that dowsing is in the Me taphysical M yr iad, and can teach us s ome- thing about that M yr ia d. The fir s t thing with which a Dows er begins is an objective to be r ea ched. The Dow ser the n as ks permiss i on from the C r e ative f orces to pursue this objective. Per mis sion is gained, by dows i ng for an a nswer to \"C an I? May I ? Should l?\" If per mis sion is approved the dows er may proceed. I f it is not approved, the Dows er is prohi bited fr om goi ng fur ther. Mos t people c onnect Dows ers with loc ating a s our ce f or water. T his ha s been the m a in goal of dowsing since prehistoric ti me s. Dows ers have now br anc hed out into nearly every f ie l d of i nformation. T he y have a l s o de- veloped ins tr uments along technical lines , a nd methods, to answ er many var ious ques tions. Dows ing is one of t he few w ays to enter the Me taphysical M yr iad. it requires that one be able to get in communication with one 's own uncons ciousnes s. A main requirement is t ha t the dows er operate on f a i th in their abilit ie s, and not have unwa r ranted skepticis m. Nor does one question the answe r s given by the Creative forces, Howeve r , one is not requir e d to a ct on the ans wers to any ques t ion. Dows ing has ethica l laws which are not t o be broken.

I had to as k the ques tions such that the y could be ans wered \" yes\" or \"no\" , and I had to have permiss ion to pose the ques tions. The an- sw er to each ques tion le ads up to to following ques ti ons . The que stions began with the c ause of the crash, w hether it was mec hanical or was it caus ed by human or other fac t ors . I t was caus ed by mecha ni c al failure, and the failur e was in the inboard motor on the right w i ng. Fr om here the ques ti oning continued with the seque nces after t he failure. The motor be- came unbala nced and the t urbine literally blew up. It exploded outward from the f us elage, a nd badly damage d t he r ight wing surface a nd structure. It tore thr ough the r ight wing tank and relea sed a l l of its jet fuel but did not c ause a fir e or, explos i on of the gases . At the same time, the outboar d motor on the right w i ng was still oper a ti ng at full power for suff ic i e nt time f or it. to pull the outer wing f orward, hinged as it were by the remaining structure of the. wing. The motor a nd the outer wing the n contacte d the nose of the plane. T his r emove d the nose cone of the plane. The fire in the re- leas ed gass es fr om the jet fuel cloud, then ex- ploded in t he air fr om c abin elec t rical spark- ing, caus ing t he first explosion heard f rom the ground. The plane wa s tr a vell ing approximately 400 miles per hour .

To c ont inue on with my questioning, whic h came somewha t later, I as ked as to the welf a r e of the victims of the crash. T o t hos e ques tions, there we r e some what les s than half of t he m had gone through the por tal to the spirit ua l part of the Metaphys ical M yr ia d.

Ther e w er e cert a in pe r s ons on board whose des ti ny called for them to stay f or a pe r iod in the astral world. The que stioning the n turned to the caus e of the motor failure.

Anyone can learn to enter the M etaphys i c al Myriad by this route or this portal. Ther e i s nothi ng magic about it , although many of the readers un- doubtably believe otherwis e.

E ach of the se octaves needs inves tigation a nd filling in. Be l ow t his is the LIGHT ENERGY M YRI- AD. Light is only one octave in the m iddle of this myriad.

In colors, there ar e three c om bina t ions for the three primary colors, r e d/ ye ll ow , red/blue, and yellow/blue, may be matched. Each of thes e will ma ke one of the three sec ondar y colors. In M usic we have the three notes C, F, and A, which match the thr e e pr imary colors. Then the r e are the thr ee notes C, E a nd G which s eem to m a tch the seconda r y colors.

These are t he odd and the eve n integers. It a lso divides t he items which they repr e sent into t w o categories. One category is the c om pliment and oppos i te of the other. T he other number, \"3\" , has not been f ina l ize d, but it prepares us f or the Thir d Dimens i on. I t was als o dis cuss ed previous ly that it s ets out the Twin Pr imes , i n the Syste m Of Numbers, after the pr ime number s a r e created. The C r ea ti on has one mor e thing to create. It must create s omething to count and ide nt ify. So, energy was created. E nergy, worki ng in compliance with the numbers, s tar te d the pro- ces s of c r ea ti ng all else . A single e ner gy is a single vibration, a nd the r e we r e 5040 differ e nt Quantum Vibrations. T he number 5040 was chos en be cause it is factorial 7 or the pr oduc t of the f irst 7 intege r s . T he Greeks ca l le d it the \"magic \" num be r . (It is al s o 7x 8x9x10 a nd aga in it i s one un it le s s tha n t he s q uare of 71. ) E a ch num be r e d vibration was a ssigne d a unique Q uantum Number value which is des i gna ted by four in- tegers. These number e d vibrations worked with other numbered vibr a ti on, so t ha t ther e was harmony betwe en them, or va r ing degrees of disha r mony betwe en them. Two numbered vi- brations, in harmony, would be attracted to eac h other. Two numbered vi brations which ar e in di s - harmony would tend to repel ea ch other. T his was in line with the la w of oppos i tes whic h was esta bl is hed previously by the number \" 2\". (T he Law of Ha r mony is discus sed in V ol ume 2.) So, now ther e are two f orces , or the pus h/ pull of nature. This characteristic of e ach ener- gy value is des i gna t e d a s male/female, or Day- side / N i ghts ide, or hot/cold ene r gy, or right/ left, Nor th/South, etc.. Yes , cold is not just the abs ence of heat. It is a distinct e ner gy type. Creation, now needs another category s o it creates the number \"4\". T his divides ea ch of the two pr e vious c ategor ie s into two parts, making a 4-way divi s ion within t he System of Numbers. T he even numbers ar e divi de d into those di vis ible by only 2, a nd those divis i ble by 4. The odd numbers we r e divided into the 4n-1, and the 4n+1 odd num be r s . T hes e a r e des cr ibe d in Definiti ons by Euclid i n B ook VII . In t he se pr e sent vol ume s t he even num- bers are c alled \" 2- pa r \" and \"4-par\". The odd numbers are ca ll e d \"3-par\" and 5-par\" respe c- tively. The number s ass igned t o var ious ener - gies wer e also di v i de d by 4, but on a differe nt basis . We ar e not ready to di s cus s thes e until we get into t hr ee dime nsional Quantum Arith- metic, and into New Ener gy applications. T he re ader is asked only t o anticipate this . The Creator continues by creating the num- bers \" 5\" and \" 7\", filling out the ma i n c atego- ries of its f iling sys tem.

What has be en des cri be d, is one s cale of the creation of e ner gy which will be called \"One Myriad\" of seve n similar myr ia ds. E ac h Myri- ad r e aches fr om 1 to approxi ma t e l y 10,000 hertz. T he wor king myriad ac t ua ll y r ea ches fr om 1 to 5040 her tz. Betwee n 5040 hert z a nd 10,000 her tz i s es sentially an overflow area. The higher the number of hertz in a ny Myriad, the weaker is the quantum e f fect. In s etting the wor king M yr iad to a maxi- mum of 5040 hertz, a l s o lim its t he prime num- bers which ca n r e asona bl y used in a Q uantum number of a thi ng. The value 5040 is der ive d as t he product when the s even prim e factors are multiplied togethe r . Above that, the value 5041 i s 71 squa r ed. The pr ime number, 71, ap- pears to be the highest prime number which can use d for the mean, (d) , w i thin any Quan- tum Number. That will limit the highes t inte- ger, (a) of a Quantum Number at s omethi ng les s than t w i c e 71, or to prim e numbers be l ow 142. These are, roughly, the parameters of a Myriad. To make the s pan between the beginning, (Creative) M yr iad, which has a top value of approximately 4 Quadrillion her tz and a value acc ur ate to one he r tz, down to one hertz vibra- tions. The Creator then di vide d this whole spa n i nto s even Myriads, each of which has the same parameters a s those layed out above. They w i ll be called (1) T he C r e ative M yri a d; (2) T he Metaphys ical M yri a d (3) T he L ight, or E lectromagnetic Myriad; (4) The Chemis m Myriad; ( 5) t he Ultra-S ound Myriad; ( 6) the Sound, or M usic, Myriad; and (7) the Emo- tional Myriad eac h be ing of lower vibr a ti ona l fr eque ncy of about a magnitude of 10, 000 : 1. The lowes t Myriad is the one which create d \"H um a ni ty\" . It is the range of fr eque ncies a t which the e mot iona l br ain ope r ates . I t runs a t some t hing like a vibrational peri od of one vi- bration every four sec onds which is 1/4 hertz, and f rom the r e up to about 25 or 30 hert z , to make up s even octaves . The next lowes t M yr iad i s the M yri a d of Sound and M usic. In music there are aga i n se ven octave s. They are relatively well identi- fied, as to the ge neral characteristics of each octave. T he prec i s e beginning and ending of eac h octave is not well s et, but they c an be de- termined with the r ec over y of Music of T he Spheres.

T his appea r s t o be an a nalog to the way colors from the Light M yr ia d can be ca scade d t o the Che m is m M yr iad as photo- s ynthesis . T his process is called, \"Ca scading\" . The cri tica l feature which must be maintained is that the diff erent notes must be harm onic to one an- other, and there may be up to seven of these notes , wa velets, of the upper M yr ia d, whic h are involved in a cas cade to the lower Myriad. The s ubj e ct of \" Harm onic s\" is di s cus sed in Volume 2 of Pythagor as And the Q uant um World , i n chapter 5 with the definit ion given on page 81. The f ourth Myriad f rom the bott om is the Myriad of Che m is m, or chemicals . It begins with the Periodi c T able of Elements. Again, there a r e se ven oc taves or Periods in this table. The s econd and thir d oc taves have s even ele- ments plus a noble eleme nt . The fir s t octave contains only Hydrogen and He l ium plus their isotopes . T he 4th and 5th oc taves have 18 ele- ments in each. (Ma t he matically there are 18 prim e fractional part s int o which an octave can be di vide d with fractions runni ng down to 1/7, and up to 7/7.) The sixth and se venth oc- taves of the Periodi c Table of E lements have 14 e lements r es pectively inserted a f ter the thir d regular e lement. The s ixth oc tave con- tains 18 elements in addition to thes e 14 ele- ments. The seve nt h octave is conside r ed to be incomplete. Many of the elements in thes e t w o highes t oc- taves are unstable and r adioac ti ve . T hat is t o be e xpected with their higher, a nd weaker, Quantum Number s to hold them toge t he r . One can liken thes e t o notes in the highes t octaves in the Mus ic Myriad. Thes e elements will als o transmute into na t ural e l e ments with much lower Quantum Numbers. Ther e has been re- cent publica ti on of be ing able to trans m ute elements , to a limi te d degree, in the C old Fu- sion E ne r gy devices of Fleis hm a nn- Pons. The fif th M yr ia d f rom the bott om, or third Myriad from t he top is the one which contains the one octave of Visible L ight. T here are a t leas t two octave s of Inf ra-Red light below the octave of V i s ible Light , and a t least two oc- taves of Ultra- V i ole t above the octave of visi- ble L ight. As noted before, it is reasona ble to believe that the thir d octave below L ight ma y be the tr ans for mation of energy in c asca ding downward into the Chemis m Myriad of M at- ter. There may als o be the third octave above light which als o ac ts as a tr ans f orm f rom the Myriad above, as note d in a previous c hapter conce r ning discarnates who have died but have not rea ched the Portal to the upper Myri- ad. So f a r , our five se nses ar e cr e dit e d f or near- ly the s um t ota l of all of our so-called firm knowledge in scienc e. The Music M yr iad is acc ess ibl e thr ough our hearing. The Li ght M y- riad is a cces sible f or one oc t a ve to our s ense of s ight. T he C hemism Myriad accounts for the other thr e e of our s enses of Matter, whic h are t ouc h, taste, and smell. Now to go to t he s econd Myriad f rom the top, the Meta physical Myriad, we have touched on the movement of dis carnates into the ne xt dimension w her e spiritual as cens ion is thought to exist. This a lso seems to be the Myriad where mos t of the thought ene r gy be- comes poss ible. T his is i n contr a st to the low- es t Myriad, where the emoti ona l energy is known to exis t.

Does that not explain the Book of \"G enesis \"? The four intege r s and/or their product, or the pr oduc t of it s pr ime factor s , is wha t is called a Quantum Number . As f our integers, thes e four integers become the \"roots\" of a ny practical pr oble m which can be devis ed.

C r e ation als o se ts up the s ystem of pr ime numbe r s , ea ch of which is i nde pendent, and unique, but is joined to the s ystem t hrough t he Creator, \"O ne\". Each of these numbers, 1, 2, 3, 5, & 7, is already prime but Creation continues to se t up the l a r ger pr ime numbers in hier a r chia l or- der.
