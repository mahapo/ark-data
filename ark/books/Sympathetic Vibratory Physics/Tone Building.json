S ome may say that S trad solved all the problems of violin t one p- roduction, a nd that fur- ther experimentation is use less as w ell as nee d- les s. This is t rue in one se nse, and not true in a n- other. In ma ki ng the \"D ol phin\" Strad a nd the \"Tusc an\" St rad, Stradi- varius undoubtedly solve d a ll the problems and left no room for fur- ther e xper imentation so far as those two instr u- ments wer e concer ned . But each violin made —no matter by whom it is made—pres ents the same diff ic ul ties f or solution, and making the \"D ol phin\" per fec t c oul dn't help Str a d very much in m a king another violin perfect. All his violins were not perfect—all w er e not r ea l ly fir s t- clas s—a nd this pr oves that violi n-making is an art—an experi me nt a l art—and not by any means a mechanica l occupa ti on or proces s. The Va r io us S tr a d M odels Why did St rad produce only one violi n equa l to the \"D ol phin,\" only one equal to the \"Tusca n\" ? This is a que stion many vi olin-makers have tried hard to solve , though ver y few have found the tr ue s olu- tion. Those of us who have been so for tunate as to have in our hands , f rom tim e to time, two or more of Str a d's ins t ruments, know \" they're dif ferent\" ( to use an ultr a - modern te r m). St radivarius was a tir e - les s experim e nt e r . Ins t ruments he made in 1707 show , under the c aliper s , a top-plate thickness of 2 8-10 m m. at position of bridge, tapering to 2 7- 10 mm. at the edges , while a Strad of 1708 show s a unif orm top- plate thicknes s of 1/8 throughout the enti re plate. Arching also var- ies . The height of arch in one Strad differ s fr om that of another. Bac k- plates vary als o— some instruments having a comparatively high- arched back, while oth- ers—of the same peri- od—have a modif ied arch in the back-plate. Even f holes var y—both in dimens i ons and loca - tions. It is a self- e vi de nt fact that to make the \" Dol- phin\" Str a d s uch a ve r y fine instrument, Stradi- varius mus t have pr ede - termined exa ctly what manner of cons tr uc t ion would bes t meet the r e - quirements of the tim be r he had on his bench for the making of that \" Dol- phin. \" Had he adopte d any othe r top-plate t hic k- nes s than the thickne ss he adopted; or any othe r height of ribs; or any other degr e e of back-plate arch, or in any wa y f a il e d to make the constructive details fi t the wood's cha r ac ter is tics or peculiari- ties, the \"D ol phin\" Str ad w oul d probably now ne v- er be heard or heard of.

He has an acute ear a nd c an dis tin- guish very poor tone fr om f a ir tone, but he could no more point whe r ein the diff erence lies than he could give, offhand, the reason for blue being blue instea d of red, or blac k. Nevertheles s, there a r e many reas ons why tone isn't all pure tone—all f ine tone. T one has been lit- erally \" diss ected\" by makers of pianofor te s, wind instruments, etc. , to s uch an extent that a de f ec t in tone-quality c an be named as w ell a s noted. J ust about twelve di fferent tone-qualities are r equired to insure perf e ct viol in tone. T his i s a greater num- ber than is r e quir ed of any other sort of t one . Tr umpet-tone r e quir es only shril lnes s a nd pe netr a - tivenes s; guitar tone requires only r ich s of tnes s; flut e - tone requires only mell ow s weetnes s with f a ir carrying power. But violin- tone r e quir es about twelve dif ferent charac t e r is t ic s—neither one domi- nating the other, but eac h e qually apparent—else it isn't f ine tone.

Be autif ul har monic tones (over tones ). 10. Agreeable double-stop t one s. 11. Roundne ss of tone. 12. Re sponsive ness to bow- pres sure. Of the twe lve individual tone-values given, I have found but two which are absolutely at command of the ma ker at all ti me s. T hos e two are the qualities of pi tc h a nd vol ume . No matter what the quality of wood may be, vi olins equal in t one - pitch a nd equal in volume of tone may be reproduced indefinitely."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Ton e Buil di ng - pa ge 5 of 11 To reproduce t he remaining t e n individual t one - values at will, and a t all t imes , is wherein lies the \"a r t\" of violin- making. Of the remaining num be r , I find thr ee which are approximately at c om ma nd of the maker, namely, intens ity of tone , evenne ss of tone-power, and freedom f rom dis sonant over- tones . Con s tructiv e De ta ils Res p onsib le Fo r Th e Variou s Ton e -v al ues Pr imarily, violin-t one , no matter what its quality or value, is not hing m ore nor les s t ha n vibr a ti ons . T he open s tr ing s ounds dee per t ha n the stopped s tr ing simply beca use the vibrations of the long s tr ing are slowe r t ha n the vibrations of the shorter or stopped string. But a violin is mor e than four strings. It is an as - se mbl a ge of many pa r ts . And eac h and every par t has a vital function, a de cided bearing on the eve n- nes s or the quality, or the power of the string's tones . The s tr ings thems elves, t he finger- board, the bridge, the sounding-boar d, the pos t , the bac k, the bar, the blocks, the ribs, the linings, the degree of sounding-board arching, the location and size of f holes , the size of the violi n and its cubic air capa ci- ty—all thes e and many other e l e ments s core impor- tant pa r ts in t he production of s uperior violi n-tone. It is poss i ble to produce viol in-tone of a lm os t any des ir ed quality or character when one unde r s tands thoroughl y the action of thes e var ious factors and develops or m odifies the action of each i ndividual factor in the proporti on to pr oduce the des i red tone-quality. Some of the factors enumerated, s uch as the r ibs , the blocks and the linings , effect more than one quality of tone. As a matter of f a ct, each of t he se three factors e f fects thr e e tone-qualiti e s, and where one factor effects three t one - qualities , e i the r one of the three quali ties may be developed at the expe nse of the other two, or all three qualities may be de - veloped approxim a t e ly equal. As a n illus t ration of jus t wha t may be ac com- plished by the intelligent maker with any f a ctor which effects mor e tha n one tone-quality, we wil l take the e xi ts , or f holes, which we will presume to be about the proper area. Now, inc r ea sing the area of t he se exits , or f holes , raise s tone-pitch, increas - es volume of tone, and dim inis hes int e nsity (carry- ing pow er ) of tone. And dim inis hing the area of thes e exits lowers tone-pitch, dimi nis hes volume of tone and increas es intensity (carr ying power) of tone. Cha ngi ng the pos it ions of f holes , placing them nearer to, or f urther away fr om bridge will increa se or dim inis h volum e of tone; moving exits away fr om bridge dim inis hes volume of t one ; moving exits nearer to br idge increas es volum e of tone. Other similar instanc es of the ac ti on of c er tain fac - tors on c er tain tone-qualiti e s might be cited, but this one factor may be take n a s an indication of what may be accomplishe d with any other factor as a basis . And in t he developing of any given tone-value to the \"limit\" c ar e m us t be exercis ed by the maker. The production of superior tone- va lues indica tes the entire absenc e of undes ir a bl e t one - qualities . For instance , volume of tone may be deve loped at the expens e of carr ying power of tone; carr ying power of tone may be developed a t the expe nse of smoothnes s or li quid quality of tone, or both. It is the ma sterly blending of tone-values that ma kes the re all y great violin, and gives to i t its s uperb, smooth, liquid; ringing tone. The Importa nce of a Knowledg e of Tone-v alu e s Any individual t one - quality tha t is de veloped to the utmost—to the \"limit\" of usefulness —is known as a tone-value. Some, in f a ct very many violinists , pref e r great volume of tone to any other tone - value. I n other wor ds , they will gladly a ccept a coarse - toned instrument, one with little br illiancy and no t rac e of that s oulf ul \"liquid\" value , just so they ge t gr ea t volume. T his is to be deplored, of course. One's t a ste in vi olin-tone is largely a ma t ter of e du- cation.

New violi ns there are, quite a few of them, that are an hundr edfold bett e r than pr ac ti c ally all ol d violins. I do not think it would be anything of an exa gger a - tion to claim that I can make a viol in with any va - riety of tone-quality, varying fr om an ins tr ument with the shrill t one of the picc ol o down to the broad, swe et tone of the ‘cello. And thi s is done— not by making the violin smaller or larger, t o br ing out the tone desired—but by ar c hi ng the plates , regulating size and thicknes s of ribs, weight of bas s-bar and pos t , size of f holes , etc. And no mat- ter how thin or how br oa d the tone brought out i t can be made tr ue and e ven on a l l strings, in all the se ven pos iti ons . So, it s hould be apparent to the r ea der t ha t he can have a n instrument intoned to his individual liking, or intoned to t ha t \"s tandard\" in depth, brea dt h, bril- liancy and ca r rying power which stamps the great violin. Violinists, as a clas s, are awa kening to a renewed interest in a ll t ha t pert a ins to violin-tone. They are studying the que stion from all viewpoints; w eigh- ing the value of this quality of t one as against that quality of tone; findi ng out what qualities a nd in what pr oportions this or that quality of tone is es - se nti a l to a great vi olin. In a wor d, they are analyz - ing violin-tone. Never in t he whole his tor y of the vi olin has there been such a demand f or gr eat violins as exists to- day, and—ow i ng to the fact that the vast majori ty of old violins ar e lacking in t one - powe r suff icient for the demands of pr e sent-day auditor ium and mu- sic - hall cons tr uc t ion—the modern violin, with its greater intensity of tone, and a t t he same time pos - se ss i ng that r ic h, smooth, s onor ous , expr ess ive quality of tone which i n all ages ha s stamped the violin king of mus ical i ns tr ume nt s , is fast s uppl a nt- ing the \"old\" and ineff icie nt ins tr uments of earl ie r makers.

Violinists know s uch knowledge is har d to acquire and that it t a kes years to ac quir e it. T hey als o know that this is an age of \"graft\" and that the grafter's most f e r tile f ield is t he violin market.

I f I could m a ke a perfect vi olin at e ach at- tempt I would gradually introduce machinery and turn them out by thous ands, a la Saxony. I don't mean to inf e r that violin- making is a \" hi t-or- miss \" proposition. But I do say it is an art. A n ar t defies duplication ad libit um . My ve r y be st violins I value at fr om $300 down to $150, and I invit e a comparison of t he se with any violins, not e xcepting the f ines t Cremona viol ins . And the violinist who has a violin w i th the \" bot- tomless \" tone of a \" Collingwood\"—guaranteed to carry 1,500 f e et i n the open air—will find, if he has the tec hnical ability to bring out the f ull beauties of fine tone, t ha t hi s chanc es of failur e as a soloist will be reduced to the mi nimum.

In the beginning of my career I looked upon both the Str ad model and the Guarnerius model as things too s acred to be tampered with. But I have concluded, as every make r mus t eventually c on- clude, that a f ine violin cannot be made by foll ow - ing a ny s et model. Both Strad and Gua r nerius m a de slight cha nges in the model of every ins tr ument they wr ought—no two being exac tl y alike. Invar ia bl y I a m guided by the materials I am work- ing, making s uch changes in the model as that ma - terial seems to ne cess itate. C ert a in points i n both the Str a d and the Guarnerius models I a lt e r ve r y fr eque ntl y. I aim to get all t he refi ne m e nt and depth of the Guarnerius model, a nd ye t retain the breadth and solidity of the S trad m ode l. How well I have suc - cee ded in thi s my violi ns w i ll testify. The Collingwood models I m ight s ay, is s omewhat sma l le r than the Str a d m ode l, but its tone is quite as \" bi g\" a nd quite as soulful. Ton e -q ua lity The dis tinctive c har a cteri s tics of C oll ingwood tone are: penetration, solidity, roundness and soulful- nes s. The tone is \" big\" without being hollow, and is characte r ized by unusual depth.

I feel j us tif ied in pr omis i ng good results to a ny one entr us ting r epa i ring, reva r nis h- ing or t one - adjus ting of any sort to me. I ha ve repaired some very valuable Cremona in- struments, and have neve r yet failed to i mprove the tone-quality of an ins t rument se nt to me for tone - adjus t ing. Ther e are very few ol d violins that will not respond nobly to t he t ouc h, here and there, of a maste r hand. In the very nature of things, a violin must change s omewhat with use. I n \" developing, \" a vio- lin doesn't alwa ys \"deve lop\" evenly—one s tr ing may lose in quality of tone while another s tr ing gains ; or one position m a y los e in s weetnes s while other positions c ome out beautiful ly. In r e alit y, a good violin s hould be adjusted once each year— at leas t. The s ound- pos t—a seeming tr ifle—can, by being se t just a tr ifle from its true pos ition, s o mar the tone of a good violin that it w i ll s ound no be t te r than the ten-dollar factory f iddle.

Posts will fall , and inexperienced hands will attempt to res et them; the result is , oftener than not, the violin suffer s a great loss in tone- va lue. Continued exposure to exce ss i ve dampnes s will of- ten c ause glue to los e its \"grip\" and allow the lin- ings, or the bl oc ks, to \"c r e ep. \" Or that na t ural dis in- tegration which c omes to all unprot e cted wood parts may attack the sound board. Fr om natural un- evenne ss of growth w hi le yet in the tr e e trunk, some parts of t he sound board will s uccumb to at- mosphe r ic a t ta cks be f ore other parts. And this dis - integration \" in spots\" f requently introduces the \"w ol f\" into violin-t one . Or, a phenomena just the r e ver s e of dis integr a t ion may ta ke place —t he wood m a y \"s well\" in spots . Dampnes s, perspiration, a raindrop, in fact the caus es of \"sw elli ng\" are too nume r ous to mention. Li ke a fi ne watc h, a violin i s c omposed of numer- ous de l ic ately wr ought and de li c ately adjusted parts. And, again like the watch, the violin should be \" adjusted,\" or \" r e gulated\" oc casiona l ly. Et e r nal vigilance is t he price of superior violin- tone . Upon receipt of a violin sent for adjusting I wil l immediately gi ve it a thorough e xamination and write to the owner giving m y sugge stions and the cos t for ca r rying t he m out. In most cas es I c an te l l in a dvance just what w i ll be t he res ul t of my wor k on an old instrument, and I invari a bl y quote price and await approval of s ame befor e commencing the wor k. Cha r ges for such work naturally vary in proport ion to the natur e and amount of work the i ns tr ume nt r e - quires. As a r ule, my price for s uch work runs fr om $10.00 to $25. 00, or if revarni s hing is ne ces sary, price ma y be as much a s $50. 00. The safest, as well as t he c heapes t, way to send a violin f or repairs is in a pla i n, wooden box about five inches de ep, eight and one-half inches wide and twenty-six inche s long, m a de fr om one-half- inch l umbe r . Pack the vi olin in the box s ecurely, using pape r or excels ior for pa cking. Always place your own name and addres s on the box as well as mine, and prepay expres s charges. Do not s hip in the violin ca se only—by s o doing the e xpr es s charges are gr e atly incr e ased. When de li ve r ing the violin thus packed to the express company, be sure to give them the valuation, and they will then be r e - spons ible for its sa f e tr a nsit. Repairin g Ti me is the important item i n the c ost of r epa ir s . One who ca n do high clas s work can not work un- der a ce r tain fixed price ba sed on the value of his time. For repairing I c har ge only what my time and ma - terials are worth, and solicit the r e pair ing of vio- lins, conf ide nt that the little tr ouble involved in the shipping of the violin to me will be f ar outweighed by the value of the wor kmans hip, f rom both the ar- tistic and tonal viewpoints.
