If it is not la t e nt for ce that is thus liberated by its"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Lat en t For ce - pa ge 3 of 6 [ P003 1488 ] exciter, a mer e s par k, w hat is it? Are not t he gas es - that are e volved in s uch great volum e and power - held in t he molecular em- brace of its aggregated matter, latent, befor e exc i ted into a ction? If this force i s not compress ed there, nor placed there by absorption, how-did it get there? and by what power was it held in its quies cent s tate? I conte nd that it was pl a ced ther e at the bi rth of the m ole cule, by t he infinite law of s ympathetic etheric focaliza ti on, a s towa r ds the negative centr e s of neutr a l ity, with a velocity as inconceiva- ble i n its character a s would be the s ubdivision of m a tt e r to an ultim a t e end. Again: What is the for c e that i s held in the molecula r embrace of that small por tion of dyna mi te , which, by slight concus sion, another order of vi bration, evolves volumes of terrif ic force, r iving the solid rock and hurling ma ssive projectiles f or mi le s? I f i t is not latent power that is excited into ac ti on, w hat is it? Finally: Wha t is held in t he interstitial corpuscular embr ac e of water, which, by its proper exc i t- er, another for m of vibration, is liberated, and shows almost imm e asurable volume and power? Is not this for m of e ner gy late nt , quiet, until br ought for th by its s ym pa thetic negative exciter? Could the force thus e vol ve d f rom these dif ferent mediums be confined aga i n, or pr es se d back and absorbed into t he interstitial s paces occupied befor e liber a t ion ? - whe r e the s ympathetic neg- ative power of the Inf inite One originally plac ed it. 1 If l a tent for ce is not accumulated and held in all corpuscular a ggr ega t ions why is it that progres- sive or ders of dis int e gr a t ion of water induce pr ogress ive conditions of increas ed volume and of higher power? I hold that in t he evolved gas es of all explos ive compounds, dynamite, or any oth- er, there exis ts, deeper down, in the corpusc ular e m brace of the gas eous element induced by the fir s t explos ion, a still greater degr e e of latent e ner gy that could be aw akened by the proper condi- tion of vibration, and still fur the r on ad inf initum . Is it possible to imagine that m e r e molecular diss ociation could show up such imm e nse vol ume s of ene r gy unass ociated with the medium of latent f orce? The ques tion arises , \"How i s this s sympathetic i nfinite powe r held in the int e r s tit ia l corpuscular position?\" Answe r . - B y the inf inite and incalculable velocity of the molec ul a r , a tom ic, and e t he r ic cap- sule s; 2 which ve l oc it y repres ents billions of revolutions pe r s econd in their rotations. We will i m- agine a sphe r e of twe lve inc hes in di a meter , r e pr es enting a ma gni fied molecule, s ur rounded by an atmospheric envelope of one - s ixt e enth of an i nc h in depth, - the enve lope rotating at a veloci- ty of the s ame increase d r atio of t he m ole cule's magnification. At the very lowest es timate, it would give a velocity of s ix hundred thous and m iles per s econd, or twenty four thous and ti me s the c i rcumference of the earth in that time. Is it pos sible to compute what the velocity would be , on the sa m e ratio, up to the earth's diameter? 3 I t is only under thes e conditions that we can be brought to even faintly imagine the wonde r ful sympathe t ic activity that exists in the molecular realm. An atmospheric f ilm r otating on a twelve-inch sphere, at the same ratio as the molecular one, w oul d be impenetrable to a s teel-poi nted projectile at its greate st velocity, and would her - metically enclose a r es isting pr es sure of many thous and pounds pe r square inch. The latent force evolve d in the dis i nte gr ation of wa ter pr oves this f a ct, for under etheric evolu- tion, in progr e ss i ve orders of vibr a t ion, thes e pr es sures are evolved, and show their energy on a lever e specially constructed f or the pur pos e, -- strong enough f or me asuring a f orce over three times that of gunpow der ."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Lat en t For ce - pa ge 4 of 6 [ P003 1488 ] We will continue this subject a little f arther, and this little farther will reac h out into inf inity. The spec ul a t ions of the phys icists of the prese nt a ge, in regard to l a t e nt energy, would neutralize the s ympathetic c ondi tions that are ass ociated w i th the governing for c e of the c erebr a l over the physic al organis m. T he e vol ution of a thought, t he infinite exciter, arouses the latent energy of the physical organism to do its work, - - dif ferential orders of brain-f orce ac t ing agains t ea ch oth- er under dual c ondit ions . If there were no latent energy to a r ous e, sympathetically, there would be no action e vol ve d on the physical mas s, nor on any other, as all force is mind force . All evolu- tions of l a t e nt power, in its va r ied mul tiplicity of ac ti on, induce d by its pr ope r e xciter s , pr ove the connec t ive link a s be tween t he ce l e stial a nd the ter res tr ial, the fi nite and t he infini te . Ther e would be no life, a nd ther e f ore there would be no action on aggregated ma t te r , had the la- tent ne gative force, the soul it is i mpregnated with, been left out of it. If a bar of s teel or iron is br ought into c ontact wit h a magne t , the l a tent force that the steel or iron is impregnated with i s aroused, a nd s hows its interstitial latent action by still holding another bar. But this experim e nt does not give the most remote idea of the immensity of the for c e that would show its elf on mor e progress ive exciters. Enough alternate active energy could be e volved, by the proper sympathetic exc it e r , in one cubic inch of s teel to do the work of a hor s e, by i ts sympa- thetic ass ociation with the polar force in alternate depolari z ation. Thi s is the powe r t ha t I am now getti ng under control ( us ing the pr oper exc it e r s , as ass ociated with the mechanical media) to do c omm e r cia l work. In other wor ds , I am m a ki ng a s ympathetic harness for the polar terr e strial f orce : f irst, by exc i ting the sympathetic concordant for c e that ex- ists in the corpuscular interstitial domain, which is concordant to it; and, s econdly, a f ter the con- cordance is es tablished, by negatizing the t hirds, sixths, a nd ninths of this c oncor da nce, thereby inducing high velocities with gr e at power by interm ittent ne gati on, as ass ociated w i th the dom i- nant t hirds. Again: T ake a way the s ympathetic la t e nt for c e tha t all matter is impregnated with, the c onnective link be tween the f inite and the infinite would be dis sociated, and gravity would be ne ut ralize d, thereby bringing a l l visible and invis i ble aggregations back into the gr e at etheric r e alm. Here let me ask, what does the term cohes ion mea n? What is the power that holds molecules tog- ether, but elec tr o-magnetic negative a t traction? What is the state that is brought about by certain conditions of s ym pa theti c vibration, caus ing molecules to r e pel e ach othe r , but elect-magnetic r a- diation? It mus t not be understood that the character of the a ction of the latent force liberated f rom liquids and ga ses is t he sa m e in its e volut ion as tha t of t he latent for c e exis t ing in metals. The for mer show s up an elastic energy, which e manates fr om t he breaking up of their rotating enve l ope s; in- creas ing, at the s ame tim e , the range of t he ir corpusc ular a cti on; thus gi ving, under conf ine m e nt, elas tic f orces of a n a lm os t inf inite charac t e r . By liberation f rom the tube it is confi ne d in, it see ks its medium of conc or dant tenuity with a ve l oc i ty greater than that of light. In metals , the latent force, as excited by the s ame s ympathizer, extends its range of neutral sym- pathetic attraction without corpuscular ruptur e, and reaches out as it were to link itself with its harmonic sympathizer, a s long as its e xciter is ke pt in ac t ion. When its exciter is dis sociated, its outreach nestles bac k again into the corpuscular e mbr ac e of the molecular ma ss that ha s been acted upon.
