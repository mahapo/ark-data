Love has been the bas e of most religions, societies and famili e s fr om the da wn of time and a cts as the foundation f or the New Age phil os ophies. Unfor - tunately scie nce and society, in the weste r n world, has wande r ed far a stray f rom this ba sic and most powerful of f orces . T he c ustomary s hunning a nd de nyi ng love is being tr a nsfor med into giving and accepting L ove !

This is happening right now, before our ve r y eyes , i n our very he ar ts . When two objects are i n harmony on multiple ha r monic levels, t he vibrations acting between the two are as a communication of intent and quality of t he i r s tate of being of one t o the other . An object’s sta t e of being, vibrator ily spea king, manif e sts as its c hor d of mas s or vibration signature or that collection of fr e quencies of which i t is made and theref ore is. When tuned to a unison the vibrations emitted by one object are perf e ctly r ec eived and as similated or unde r s tood by the oth- er. It i s well known i n mus i c al cir c l e s that pr ope r ly tuned musical instruments will respond sym- pathetically to eac h othe r . T his ha ppens when vibration r a tes of strings are tuned at exact unis ons betwee n two or more ins tr uments . Pluck or bow a finely tuned s t ring on one instrument a nd other instruments will respond with the same note. T he two individualized objects begin to res onate AS O NE instrument with per fect cadenc e a nd concordanc e. What were once s eemingly s eparate things are now intimately and dyna mi c ally conne cted vi bratorily at the inner mos t harmonics . The connecting link res onates t hrough the hi ghe r ha r monics and not the l ow er physical form . What ha ppens to one becomes an expe r ience f or both s im ultane ously and intimately - fr om w i th- in - as an evoked s ympathetic res ponse. Thi s s pecial kind of vi bration is called a Sym pat he ti c V i- bration . This def inition c oincides perf ec t ly with that of Unconditional Love . Ge ner a l ly consid- ered love means t w o or more persons e xper ienc e lif e a nd e ach other as though they exist as one unit resona ti ng in unison each acting c oncor da nt ly upon the ot he r . Sympathetically vibrating structures me ans two or more objects vibr a t ing a s one unit res onating in unison ea ch acting con- cordantly upon the other. B ecaus e sympathe t ic vi bration ca n and does conduct or convey energy sufficient to ca use motion in a distant a nd see mi ngly separate obj e ct it is t he r efore taken to be dynamic energy. Love r a diating from one individual can and does move other indivi dua ls. Love is theref ore a dyna mi c for c e. Thi s S piritual Scienc e was ori gina l ly developed (as far as w e a r e conce r ned) mor e than 100 years ago in Philadelphia by John Worr e l l Keely ( 1827-1898) {3 } . Re di s covering a nd developing his origi na l work promises great benefits f or s ociety.

One of Keely’s original inventions was a Mus ical Dynas phere {2 } . T his beautif ul machine w as des igned to r es pond sympathetica l ly to earth vibrations.

This will only occur after the e stablishment of a Neutral Ce nter withi n the device. Kee ly claimed the discovery of the N eutr al C enter as his greates t ac hievement. A Neutral Cente r (similar in s om e ways to Zer o-Point) is that which is the s elf -identity of the mechanis m. I t is t he veritable heart of the or - ganis m . I s ay organism becaus e the overall mechanis m is as a living organism i n that it has com- bined as O ne t he dyna mi c a nd m ulti-harm onic e ner gies of Terr e stri a l a nd C elestial for c es.

The Ne w Sciences are be gi nning to work with vort i- ces and implosion which repr e sents the f emale side of nature. T he Dynas phere works with both of these plus the t hird Neutral s tate being a derived combination of the two. T he two polar for ce s come together in a pure s tate of sympathetic vibr a t ion to form the Neutr a l Cente r . It is fr om this harmonic union of divine-l ike for c es that renewa l or regeneration comes. Through this mecha- nism may be developed and li be r ate d fur ther “lif e BEing” properties. The Dynasphere is the fir s t multi-dim e nsional mechanis m born of a s cience and philosophy that acknowle dges and res pects that whic h N atur e is . Thr ough the development of this t e chnology we are being a f for de d insights into Na tur e’s f iner for c es thus allowing an expa nding abilit y t o per - ceive with growing c l a r ity how everything is intimately as sociated and coope r atively working to- gether. A reverential atti tude towards the divinity of nature a nd a ll of i ts aspec t s is ess ential f or the proper a nd more complete unfoldment of the Ne w S c i e nces . It a l s o gives us an understanding of Nature’s i nne r wor kings whe r eby a whole new per s pective on sc ience, philosophy and engi- neering c an take place . As the world awakens to this emer ging New Age of increas ed self i de nti ty bas ed on L ove it transfor ms the reigni ng s ocial s t ructure and practices base d on F e ar . T he under lying feelings of love motivates and propels thes e change s. The letting go of fear and apprehension ca n be scary to some. Allowing one’s s elf to be in a state of L ove ( wide ope n and see m ingly defens eles s) can be jus t as sc ar y. Whe t he r one acts or reacts in love or fear become s a personal a nd consc ious choice.

I f w e live in fear we ins t inc t ively react to these new feelings of openness in old fashioned and no longer us eful wa ys. We react with fear and all of its eff ort intensive mechanis m s of reactionary s elf -defense , flight or f ight, guilt, victimization, calumnies a nd conde mnations of se lf , others and pretty ne ar all else .
