Circumference is the distance around the outs ide edge of the circle. T he diameter is the maximum s tr a i ght li ne length whic h can be contained by the c ir cle . Thi s r elations hip is represe nt e d by the Gr e ek letter Pi (sounded like pi e ) having the s ymbol ! or \" .

The a r ea of the square could be e asily calculated by mult i- plying the le ngt h of each side of the square. The area of t he circle will be some exact fractional part of the area contained within the square. Thi s fr a ctional part has been know n f or c entur ies to be equal to Pi divided by four . Finding the e xact relationship between t he area of the s quar e and tha t of the circle has been called the problem of ' QUA DRA T UR E OF T H E CIRC L E'.

The polygon approximation method does not give an e xact nor acc ur ate value for P i due to the inappropr iate ass umpti on that the dif f e r enc e between a curved line and a straight line ca n be made va nishingly sma l l.

The s ame could be s aid of each 'meas uri ng' square (these a r e t he small squa r es c ontained by the Rectangle and Squar e ) . There ar e two 'r ight' tr iangles in each 'meas ur - ing' s quare. Each 'right' triangle of t he 'meas ur ing' square has a ba se length of 1 / 2 inch and a height of 1 / 2 inch. E ac h 'r ight' triangle contained in the 'me asuring' square ha s an a r ea of 1 / 2 times 1 / 2 inch tim es 1 / 2 in c h ; the product equals 1 / 8 square inch. T here are two right triangles i n e ach 'meas ur - ing' s quare making an ar e a for the measuring square of 2 times 1 / 8 square i nc hes; the product equals 1 / 4 square inch. Notice that the a r ea of the me asuring square ca n also be c alculated as 1 / 2 inch squa r ed. 1 / 2 inch times 1 / 2 i nc h equa ls 1 / 4 s quare inch. T he s um of the area of the two r ight t riangles in the 'meas- uring' s quar e is exactly equal t o the ar e a of the 'meas uri ng' squa r e. If we multiply the tr ue area of t he 'meas ur ing' square ti me s the number of meas ur ing squares in the lar ge s quare we f ind that the area of the lar ge squa r e is 1 / 4 square inch tim e s 16 w hi c h equa ls 4 square i nc hes. The ar e a of t he lar ge r ight t riangle was calc ul a ted to be 8 squa r e units of area. 1 / 4 squa r e inch t imes 8 squa r e units gives an a r ea of 2 square inches . T he 2 s quare inc h area of the right tr ia ngl e is 1 / 2 the s i z e of the 4 square i nc h area of the l a r ge r Squar e . Thi s exe r cis e has demons t rated t he proper ty of proportion of length and area between, and w i th- in, the two sha pes of the 'r ight' triangle and the Square. When one shape is a fixed par t of another the pr oportion of ar ea is maintained betw een the two s hapes independent of their absolute s i z e or the standar d of meas ur e us ed to de- sc ribe them.

Calculati ng t he Length and An gle s of t he 'Right ' T r i angle The side opposite the two side s f orming the 90° angle is called the hypotenuse af ter the Greek words ' hypo ' m e aning unde r and ' t e inein ' meaning 'to s tr e t c h' conve ying to us the conc ept of 'stretched betwee n' or 'under t e nsion'.

Ellipt ic al Ec cent r i c it y By m e asuring the major and m inor axis of the ellipse a number can be determ ine d that describes the var ia t ion of orbit a l path f rom that of a perf ec t circle. This meas ur e is called the e ccentricity of the or bit and is des ignated by the it a li c ized letter ' e '.

From the se numbers we deduce that bot h orbi ta l paths would appear more c ir cular than as s hown by the dr awing. Kepler's Third Law Appl ie d T o T h e Solar S ys tem In 1619 Kepler f urther r e f ined his theor ie s to include a third pr inciple of orbiti ng bodie s. His thir d pr inciple states that for orbit ing planetary bodies ( the law is applicable to other orbi ta l pr o- ces ses ) t he r atio of t he square of t he t ime that they take to complete one e ll iptical orbit P 2 di vid- ed by the cube of 1/2 the major diameter a 3 is a cons t a nt . W ith a perfectly circular orbit the rates of movement would be cons tant at all points. In either the cas e of the elliptical or circular orbit s the rate of m ove ment meas ured over 1 complete circle of travel will produce 1 mea sure of time and 1 meas ur e of ave r age ve locity. Thi s average s peed must be pr oportional to the area enclos ed by the orbital path. The orbital path can be t hought of as being the circumfer e nce meas ur e of a circle with an appropriate diameter . T hus the elliptical orbit by meas ure of area can be des cr ibed by the m e asure of 1 circle and the meas ure of 1 orbital period P as tha t of 1 cir cula r cycle of 1 360° meas ur e of arc. Li s ted below are the eccentricity ( e ), periods of r otation ( P ) and average distanc e ( a ) fr om the sun f or four of the pla nets in our solar s ystem. The time for the ea r th t o r e vol ve once around the sun is taken as being 1 unit of ti me . T he average distanc e of t he ea r th f rom the s un is taken as 1 unit of di s tance. T he rot a ti ona l periods and t he ave r age dis t a nce f rom the cente r of the sun of the other 3 planets have been converted to these units of meas ur e by divis i on.

Gravitat ing Sys t e m The 'real life' 3 body gravitating s ystem de scribed in C hapter 8 demons t rated t he exact cor rela- tion between circumfer e nce, time and diameter using the relationships embodied by the three numbers 20612, 5153 and 6561. The planetary or bits and s pher ic al s hapes a r e portions of true continuous curved lines and are not the pr oduc t of s tr a ight line approxim a t ions . The f inal f ind- ings of C hapter 8 have f ully confir med the f undame nt a l and tr ue na t ure of Pi de scribed as being 20,612 parts of circumf e r enc e divided by 6,561 parts of radius. In the 3 body gravitating sys tem of Chapter 8 we s aw that the number 20, 612 as a unit whole stood for the representa t ion of circumference and also as 1 period P of r evolution. S imilarly the number 6, 561 as a unit whole s tood f or diamete r a nd was used to extr apola t e the diameter of the earth to the ne cess ary radius of diameter of the ea r th or bit about the Sun.

In the box a t the t op of page 9.4 are dr a wn two cir c les. The l e f t hand c ir cle contains four ellipse s all having a major dia m e ter of 1 and a minor diameter ranging f rom 1 to 0.

The dotted lines dir ec t the vi e wers eye s howing that the shape of an e ll ips e can be thought of as a cir c l e dr aw n at an angle to the viewer . An ellipse with a major and minor diameter of 1 we r e cognize as being a circle having a diameter of 1. An ellipse having a minor diamete r of 0.7 appears to be a circle dr a wn a t an angle of 44.43° to the viewe r . A minor diameter of 0. 3 appe ar s to be a cir c l e dr awn a t an a ngl e of 17.43°.
