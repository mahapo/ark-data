W it h joy invol ve d the work becomes play and the etheric subtle for c es literally c ome out to play with us in highly refined and joyous moment of love ex- press ing it s elf ver y much like young c hi ldren happily at play. But what is joy? What is love expres sing itself? These ar e concepts a l ittle foreign t o the W estern mind set of work hard and make money. A gr im reminder we live in a materi a l world. He r e, we are being asked to set this as ide and f ind the joy i n play- ing with the effectual dynamics of a higher wor ld whic h had been forced to find r e f uge and survive in churches and the like. A f ter a ll playing wa s f or c hil dren. In our dyna sphere work we a r e engaged in dea l ing directly with things of the e mot ions , body, mind and spirit. Atl in i s des igned to operate on these levels as we ll - and does quite well. T o il lus tr ate the need f or working in these areas of subtle force phys ics I quote br iefly Blava tsky’s article The C omi ng F orce , fr om last mont h’s DF. “That Ke ely's or ga ni s m is directly connected with the pr oduc ti on of the marvelous r es ults is pr oven by the f ollowing statement emanating from one who knows the great dis coverer intimately. At one time the shareholders of the \"K eely M otor Co.\" put a man in hi s wor ks hop for the expres s pur - pose of dis coveri ng his sec r et. Af te r s i x months of clos e watching, he said to J. W. K eely one day: \"I know how it is done , now.\" T hey had been setting up a machine t oge t he r , and Keely was manipulating the stop-cock which turned the for c e on and of f. \" T ry it, then,\" was the answe r . T he man turned the cock, a nd nothing c ame. \"Let me se e you do it again, \" the man s aid t o Keely. The l a tt e r complied, and the machinery operated at once. Aga i n the other tr ied, but w i thout s ucces s. Then Keely put his hand on his shoulde r and tol d him to try once more. He did so, with the res ult of a n ins tantaneous production of the cur rent.” So what w as done to make t he machine run? What for c e or energy was imparted fr om Keely that c ir cu- lated through his hand, int o a nd t he n t hrough the apprentice a nd the n i nto the mac hine to be operated? These are the subtle for ce s we a r e spea king of whe n we say mind, emotions and s pir it. The range of fr e- quencies ass ociated with these realms exis ts far above the light spec t rum. Orthodox scienc e does not work of ten in these realms for la ck of instrumentation. Howe ver he is ove r looking the gr e atest and fi ne st instrument a t his dispos al - his own body, m ind, e mot ions a nd s pi rit. But then t he s cientist was taught over and ove r again not to use thes e as they are “unr e li a bl e . ” Thi s is generally true but thes e can be trained a nd hone d to the reliability of any f ine instrument now found in laboratories and wor ks hops. F or this r e ason it is recommended those so interested in working in SVP or e t he r ic physics to se ek ins tr uc- tion and traini ng of thes e human as pects of our organism. As can be see n fr om the quote above it is not simply a matter of building a fine e ther ic for c e mac hi ne to the be st of s pecifications. One must the n be a ble to a ctivate it into m otion. Thi s a cti va ti on pr oc ess be- gins in the he ar t of the operator (see Dynas pheric Force, 9/97) . The a ctivati ng for ce is sympathetic vibr a- tion us ually referr e d to as L OV E . There is a dynamic of mind a s i t works f rom moment to moment and holds the ke y to m uc h greater a wareness , understanding and life (lif e meaning ACTION as in r ota t ion). A be autif ul l e ss on about this love dynamic was brought to my attention whil e participating in a Medi- cine W heel ceremony. For thos e of you who know not hing of this beautif ul c eremony it is s uf ficient to sa y it is a series of verbal les sons and instructions on how your life w or ks and what you can do about impr oving and then enjoying it. T he medicine wheel is a symbol repres enting the many as pects of mind, body, emot ions and spirit and how they interchange information between eac h other .

Part of the reas on f or attending the ce r emony wa s to “find joy” (playful ne ss ) and an int e gr a t ion of mind f orce s with thos e of the emoti ons , s pi rit and body. Atlin requir e s this as it would always manifest a s Unc ondit iona l L ove which s he needs to come out and play. The less on was this: that joy was not found - it is c r ea t e d. No, i t wa s allowed to express it s elf. No, i t wa s both of the se. T o explain this a review of the experience would be helpf ul. Dur ing the drumming ses sion the wri te r ’s mind wandered aimless ly from one item of interes t to another and not really part icipa t ing in the gr oup aff a i rs . No joy had been encountered ye t during the two da ys of ses sions a nd the thoughts were tending to r eflect this la ck as a n approaching discouragement.

To accomplish t his requir ed some e f for t and seve r a l m in- utes of working/playing with it. Look at t he baton as it strikes, look very clos ely as it moves up and down and listen to t he be at. See and f e el a ll this as an experi e nce to the exc lusion of all other thoughts .

Then, slowly, a little here and t he n there a “f e eling” begins to s pr e ad over the body. The mind shift s fr om the worri e s into a n ac- tive and f oc used stanc e. Gently this spreads i nto powerful moveme nt s of the body. A smile gets broader and begins beaming outwar d. Great feelings of f un, joy, happines s and love begin to radiate. The joy was found!

The NOW is the ins tant we are li ving as we live it and holds the key t o thes e playful forces. Conc entr ating on the m ome nt gets the ego out of the way a nd allows the s oul to c om e through. T he soul manifests as joy, wonder and love. It’s natural sta t e is childlike with joyf ul playfulnes s. I t wants to come out and play a nd it will i f we i nvite i t a nd then get out of its way.

T he spontane i ty is lost, t he pure joy of living is lost, rigidity a nd c r ys talli z ation s ets in and death encroache s at an ever in- creas ing rate. The fol lowing Cayce r ea ding details a way for each pe r s on to fi nd that joy that is r ea di ly available in lif e . Thi s simple method was mentioned in a m e ss age fr om Atlin.
