It is not my pur pos e to tr a ce the development of this thought f rom the very beginning of its r ec or ded hi s tor y.

Dur ing the da r k age s following t he decline of the Roman Empir e, the gloom that pe r vade d the w or ld's mind acted almost a s a n eff e ctual curtain for the c oncealment of any hope that might still li nge r in the br ea sts of the oppr es se d people; yet eve n then, s ome few waves of s ocialistic thought penetrated r e ceptive mortal brains , e xhibi te d mostly i n the c om mu- nistic idea s held by the M endicant Orders, by the Anabaptis ts in Germany, and by the Levellers in England. T hes e ideas are c l e arl y expr e ss in a Flemis h poem of the thirteenth ce nt ury written by Jac ob Va n M aerlant ( 1235), and entitled \"Wape ne Martyn. \" Two pass ages f rom this poe m , translated by an English Socialist, read as follows: ( \" Martin, the Germ a n law relates that f rom unright e ous violence, ownership is come.\") ( \" T wo w or ds in t he wor ld there be , thes e simply mine and thine . C ould one take them a way, peace there would be and f reedom.

I m us t not for get, befor e tur ning to later times , to quote a f ew say- ing of some of the early C hr is t ia n Father w ho held the t hought in their l e ader, Jes us.
