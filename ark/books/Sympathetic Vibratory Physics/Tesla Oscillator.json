J ar vis Patten. New York Home Journal, 7/1895 The fir e which, s ince our last issue went to pres s, des tr oyed the la bor atory of Nikol a Tesla in this city a nd reduced to as hes all t he recent devices of his ingenuity, has aga i n aroused public interes t in the work of this world- renowne d inventor. By t he creation of the rotary field motor, which now, s om e s ix or s even ye ars from its bir th, is a commercial s ucces s, a nd the br illiant inves tiga- tions he s ubse quently made in the dir e cti on of high f requency phenomena - not ye t so far ad- vance d - Tesla has es tablished his r ight t o be r e gar de d as the most pr omising inventor in e l e ctr ic- ity that we have toda y. I t i s , theref ore, only natur a l that when without warni ng all his records and more recent apparatus are s uddenly wiped out of existenc e, the public should be e ager to know what he ha d in prepa r ation f or his next surprise. The s o- c alled “O scillator\" w as near to a practica l working for m when t he fir e occurred, and as this machine, in a les s f inis hed s hape, had been exhibited at the C hicago E xpos i tion, and has re- ceived a lar ge s har e of his attention since that time, he has cons i de r a t e ly given t he public some photographs and de t a il s of t he more a dvanced f orms of this engine. Tesla's res earches and i nve n- tions have her e tof ore been c onf ined to purely e lectr ic al problems, and electricians were natur a ll y expec t ing a continuation of s uch work, but this inventor a ppears t o delight in surpr is es, a nd when the Oscillator wa s announced f or the fir s t time, the ge neral conelus ion that T es la ha d contrived some way of sha king the earth's electri c charge, or ha d made some other ultra s cientifi c s t e p of a like c haracter, was far fr om t he truth. Of all things ye t produced by him the Os cill a t or is c ert a i nly the mos t thoroughly mecha nical and poss ibly the most pr ac t ic al. T he term “Os cillator ,\" in fact, was e vi de nt ly se l e cted by him in or der to dis tingui s h it f rom other well- known for ms of vibrator, and gives hardly a ny idea either of the machine itself or the functions it is designe d to pe r form . There i s , indeed, no connection between this machine and his for me r pr oduc t ions , except thr ough the fact that its purpose is to economize the wor k of the steam-engine and the dynamo a t the same time, and s o mate r ially t o increas e the output of the se, two ess entials of every la r ge electric generating plant, the combined we i ght and cos t of the two being greatly reduced. The Os cillator , in f a ct, is an “e ngine dynamo,\" consis ting of a novel form of s team e ngi ne com- bined wit h and operati ng on the s ame bed plate a nove l for m of dynamo. T o understand how suc h a contri va nce can ha ve a ny practical value in electric ge ner a t ion it is nece ss ar y f irst to con- side r the es se nt ia l features of any or dinary e l e ctr ic plant, their relations to ea ch other, and where any loss es of power s eem una voidably to enter . In plain terms, all such plants at the present tim e cons ist of t w o independe nt parts, the steam-engine and the dynamo. This the engine dr ive s gen- erally by indir ec t methods, a s it would a ny other piec e of ma chiner y, a s a lathe or a planer, through a sys tem of s haft ing and belti ng. True, in modern pla nt s , where l a r ge units are employed of five hundred hor s e-power or upwa r d, the moving part of the dynamo is secured dir ec tl y to the driven s haft of the engine. T his plan is known a s di rect coupling, and t hough it introduces no sma l l degree of economy in operation, it se ems, ac cor ding to Tesla, to be onl y a step in the r ight direction. I t save s, for instance , at lea st one unnece ss ar y line of shafting with i ts attenda nt fr ic- tion; als o, the work wasted in driving the belt or ge ar ing of some kind be tween t he engine and the dynamo, which is a far greater us eless drain upon the steam-power. Direct c oupli ng is, therefor e , all very w ell, so f ar as it goes , but we have not s aved muc h, i f any- thing, in floor spa ce, or in w eight, f or we have still an ordinary engine and an ordinary dynamo as before.

Cons ider the steam-engine f irst. He r e we have a s team c yli n- der in which is produced the reciprocating mot ion of the pi s ton rod, and thi s motion, which r e p- resents the active power of the engine, is next converted into r otary motion thr ough a s ystem of auxiliary parts, na m e ly, t he conne cting rod, the crank, and the attached f ly-wheel. These parts all cons ume work by fr iction, but by far the gr ea test l os s lies in the change fr om t he reciprocating, or to and fro, pi s ton motion to the rotary motion of the crank, the actual power of the piston working, as it does , at e ver y point of the circle a t a disadvantage , owing to t he varying inclina- tion of the crank and pis t on rod in all positions . Rotary motion onc e obtained, how ever, we ha ve to reconve r t a portion of it back again through further auxiliary appa r atus - the ecc entr ic with its rods and valve s - to the r e cipr oca ti ng motion of the valve i n the steam ches t , w hi c h latter by its great friction, due to the s team pres sure, was tes no incons iderable a m ount of power. T hus w e s ee that in the s team-engine all the apparatus except the pis t on and steam cylinder are auxili a r y to it, and all was te, or us e up without doing a ny work on the shaft of the engine, s ome of the energy delivered by the expanding s team to the pis ton hea d. I n f a ct, it is plain that our conversion of the reciprocating motion of t he pis t on to the rot a r y one of t he fly- whe el is was teful , a nd if done away with a cons ider a ble s aving of pow er could be effected. Unfor tunate l y, how ever, in all the machinery f or whic h the steam-engine has been heretof ore use d as a motive-power or driver , the rotar y motion was required in the a ppar a tus, and was, therefor e, ma de in t he s team- e ngine which drove it; a ll machinery, in fact, with ver y few e xcep- tions, being ess entially rotary. On the other ha nd, if we e xamine the dynamo w e s hall find that we have ma de the dynamo a ro- tary mac hi ne only be caus e the stea m -engine is, and to ac commodate it to the latter . The dynamo had to be dr ive n by a s team- e ngine, and in its evoluti on was naturally first ma de rotary in or der to a dapt it to existing f orms of the steam-engine. It is well know n to e lectr ic al enginee r s that the s impl e st a nd mos t economical f orms of dynamo have recipr oc ating parts only, and that the rotary form can only be contrived a t a certain loss of eff ic i e ncy. We may, theref ore, s tate in general terms that the usua l for m of engine, rotary, i s not adapted to the bes t for m of dynamo, while the bes t type of engine f or driving the simples t and most economical f orm of dynamo, that having a reciprocating mot ion only, has not yet been con- tri ve d or des igned; not becaus e of any inherent dif ficulty in the des igning of s uch a n engine, but simply becaus e s uch a machine has heretofor e had no pa r ticular s phere of usefulness . The Tesla Os cill a tor is r evolutionary in this r es pect, that i t reverses the existing f orms of engine and dynamo cons tr uc ti on by ma ki ng them both r e cipr oc ating in the i r action, thus coupling an ef- ficient dynamo to a stea m- engine, w hi c h, being als o reciprocating, has no wasteful auxili a r y parts, and no wa steful conve r s ion of the ori gina l recipr oc ating motion to the rotary for m of mo- tion. Such, in gene r al term s , is the Tes l a Os cillator . It aims s im ply at a higher e conomic con- struction of the two ess ential pa r ts of an electric generating plant, and in for mulating thi s idea Tesla makes one machine of the two on one bed-plate, and thus again make s no little s aving of spa ce and we i ght. While thi s c onstruction, as desc r ibed f or sake of s i mplicity, might s eem easy at first gla nce, a few e ngineeri ng diff iculties of a purely mecha nical cha r a cter soon become evident t ha t render the solution of the probl e m one of extreme difficult y. Briefly s t a ted they are a s f ollows . T he dynamo to be e conomical requires an extr e m e ly high rate"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Tes l a O s cil lato r 4 of to-and-f ro motion m otion say at le ast eighty to one hundred s tr oke s a s econd, while the s team- engine, on the other hand, owing to it s ne cess arily heavy parts, requires a ve r y slow r ate for a dy- namo, s ay ten strokes a sec ond, and thes e a dver s e r equirements of the two mac hines must s ome- how be reconc i le d. Again, the conversion to rotar y motion in t he s t e am- e ngi ne fr om the reciprocating f orm through the m e dium of the crank, serves a very us eful purpose, es pecially i n the case of hea vy and pow- erf ul engines . T his connec t ion of the pi s ton to the c r ank caus es the pis ton to start up slowly un- der the enormous pr es sure of the s team, attaining i ts highes t s peed onl y for an ins tant about mid- way of the stroke, then s lowing gradually dow n to the end of the s tr oke , where it is z er o. The piston is t he n ready to resume its backward j ourney in the same manner w i thout shock or jar to the structur e . We thus s ee t ha t there is a t leas t one compensa ti ng feature in our conversion loss, for it would evidently be imposs i ble to s end t he hea vy piston, we i ghing, pe r haps , a t hous and pounds, a t full spe ed from one end of t he cylinder to the othe r , then instantly a r res t its moti on at the exact poi nt and send it back again at the same rate. T o do this a few times a se cond would be certain di s as t e r but to do it a t a hi gh rate of speed would be as ce r tainly im pos sible. In the Os cil- lator the piston travels its journey to and fro a hundr e d times a second, a nd ca n go m uc h faste r if requir e d, but the m e chanical conditions ar e all di fferent. I n the first pla ce, the pa r ts are all s mall and extr e mely light, it being claimed that an engine of a given power on thi s pla n can be made about one- fortieth the weight of a n ordinar y engine of the same power; s econdly, the pis ton stroke is ver y small, being in no cas e more tha n a f raction of an i nc h; and, finally, automatically operated air cus hi ons , or springs, a r e use d, that s er ve to check and s low down the motion of the piston gr a dually at the end of the stroke. In one f orm of the Os cillator two pis tons ar e us ed that go out and in the oppos ite ends of t he sa me cylinder at the same time, thus balancing t he motion and relieving the apparatus fr om t he rapid s hock of vi bration. Li ke the engine having two pistons the dyna m o is double, or rather there a r e two, one f or e ach pi s ton, each of which carr ies a light armature tha t it rapidly thrusts into and withdraws f rom a very i ntens e magnetic field. The vibratory for m or osc i llatory form of dynamo i s not ess entially ne w. S e veral earlier laboratory mac hi ne s having bee n made this way, perhaps the m os t remarkable of which was the Edison tuning- for k dynamo, remarkable c hief ly, however, for its utt e r inapplicability to any us e. Perhaps the mos t remarkable fea t ure about the T e sla apparatus is a nove l sys tem of s team pack- ing introduced, which enables him to use a stea m press ur e of three hundr ed and f ifty pounds without any perceptible l e ak. T his , taken i n conjunction w i th the ve r y high rate of piston s peed use d, which, of course, only compens ates f or the very short s t roke, s hould produce an e ngi ne of high e conomy. As f or t he dynamo, the type c er tainly admits of high ec onom y in c onstructi on, and it is claimed t ha t in one for m there is abs olutely no ar ma t ure wir e that i s not cutting lines of for ce and doing work. While it is too ea r ly to predict the eventual outcome of such r e vol utionary steps in both stea m and electrical e ngi ne er ing the de velopments thus f ar seem to have been of the most e ncour a ging sort.
