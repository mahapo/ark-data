T he term phys ics is derived from a Greek wor d sig- nifyi ng “natur e . \" Nature does not li mit hers elf to matter and m e chanism.

A s S pe nser ha s s aid, For of the soul t he body f orm doth take; For soul is f orm, and dot h the body make. Huxley tells us that sc i e nce pr os pers exac t ly in pr oportion as it is r eligious , and that religion flour is hes in exa ct propor tion to the scientific depth and f irmnes s of its ba sis. “Civilization, soci- ety, and mor a l s , \" s ays Figui e r , \" are like a s tr ing of beads , whose fastening is the belief i n the i m- mort a li ty of the soul.

T he “compound s ecret\" ass ociated with Mr. Keely's dis- covery shows that no apology i s ne eded, -that the mol e cule is a perf e ct organism, which, like the perf e ct, vibr a t ory engine of Mr. Keely, may be wor ke d backw ar d as well as for wa r d. All the light that is needed for the ful l c ompr ehe nsion of its intelligent action will be f ound in M r.

Or, if we t hink it m ore natural t o attribute this pow er to the vi s cera, - the stomach, for example, -we only cha nge the thesis . It w i ll be s aid that it i s pantheism to as sert that matter, under all the for ms w hi c h it pres ents, is only groups of aggregate s of sympa t he t ic molecules, of a s ubstanc e unalterable in its indi vidua l i- ties; a thi nking, acting s ubstance . Let us not deny what we are una bl e to explain. God i s all that is, without everythi ng that is being indivi dua l ly God. E the r ic f orce has been compared t o the trunk of a tree, the roots of which rest in I nfinity. The br a nches of the tree corr es pond to the var i- ous modifications of thi s one f orce, -heat, light, elec tr icity, a nd its antagonistic for c e, magnetis m. It is held in s uspe nsion in our atmosphere. It exists thr oughout the unive r s e. A ctual sc i e nce not admitting a void, then all thi ngs m us t touc h one another. To touc h is to be but one by contiguity, or there would be between one thing and another something which might be te r med space , or nothing. Now, as not hing cannot exis t , t he r e must be something between “the atomic tr iplets \" which are according to the Ke ely t he or y, f ound in each molecule . T his something in the mole- cule he affir ms to be “the universa l fluid, \" or molecular ether. One thing touching another, all must therefor e be all in all, and thr ough all, by the s ensitive combination of all t he m olec ules in the universe , a s is demonstrated by electri c it y, galvanis m, the loadstone, etc. If we acc ount f or the intelli ge nt ac t ion of molec ul e s by a t tributing it to w hat has been var ious ly c alled \" the univer - sa l f luid,\" “the electric flui d,\" \"the galvanic f luid,\" \" the nervous fluid, ” “the magne t ic f luid,\" it will only be subs titut ing one name f or another; it is still some part or ot he r of the organization which discerns and joins to itse lf a por tion of one of the fluids ref e r red to, or one of these fluids which di s cerns and mingles with the material molecules ; it is still the lif e of the part, the life of the m ole cule, lif e individualized in all a nd through all. Admitting, then, that ther e is a universal flui d, it must exis t in and t hrough all things . I f void doe s not exis t, eve r ything is ful l; if all is full , eve r ything is in contact; if everything is in contact, the whole inf lue nces and is influenced, be cause a l l is life; a nd life is movement, beca use movement is a c onti nua l disunion and union of all the molecules which compose the whole. The ancient philosophers admitt e d all this. Under the diff erent name s of “macrocos m, \" \"microcosm, “corpus- cules , \" \" emanations,\" “attr a ction, \" \"repuls ion, \" \"s ympathy, \" and \"a nt ipathy,\" - -all names which are only one, - their va r ious propositions were merely the pr oduc t of inductions inf luence d by their modes of obs erving, as the deduc ti ons of scientists a r e inf lue nced in our day. Ba l z ac tells us that everything her e be low is t he product of a n e ther e al s ubstanc e, the common bas is of var ious phenomena, known under the inappropriate names of elec t ricity, he at, light, gal- vanic and ma gnetic f luid, etc. , and that the universa l ity of its transmutations constitutes w hat is vulgarly called matter . W e ca nnot take up a book on phys ics ( written with t rue scientific knowl- edge) in which we do not f ind evide nce that its a ut hor ac knowledges that the r e is , c or rectly spe aking, but one force in nature. Radcliff e tells us t ha t what is ca ll e d electricity i s only a one- side d as pect of a law which, when f ully revealed, wil l be found to rule over organic as we l l as in- organic na tur e, -a law to which t he disc over ie s of scienc e a nd the t e achings of philosophy alike bear tes ti mony, -a law which does not entomb lif e in m a tt e r , but which transfigur e s matter with a lif e which, whe n traced to its source, will pr ove only to be the effl ue nce of the Divine lif e. Ma cvicar tea ches that the nearer we as cend to the f ountain-head of being and of a ction, the more magical mus t e ver ything inevitably bec om e ; for that f ountain-head is pur e volition. A nd pur e vo- lition, as a mus e, is precis ely what i s meant by magic ; for by magic is mea nt a mode of pr oduc- ing a phenome non wit hout me chanical applianc es, - that is , without that s eeming continuity of r e- sis ting part s and that leve r age which sa ti s fy our mus cular sens e and our imagination and bring the phenome non int o t he category of what we call \"the natur al;\" that is, the s pher e of t he elas t ic , the gr avitating, -the s phere into which the vis iner t iæ is alone admitted.

T he sc i e nce of learning, says Lesley, a nd the scie nce of knowledge are not quite identical; and learni ng has t oo often, in the c ase of i ndividuals , overwhelmed and smothered to dea th knowledge. I t is a f a m iliar fact that great disc over ies come at long intervals , brought by specia l ly-commiss ioned and highly-endowed mes sengers ; w hi le a perpetual proces- sion of humble s ervants of nature arrive with gift s of less er moment, but e qually genuine, cur i- ous, and int e r es ting novelties. From what unknown l a nd does all this wealth of inf ormation come? who are thes e bearers of it? a nd who intr us ted e ach wit h his particular burden, which he carries alof t as if it dese r ve d exclus ive admiration? W hy do thos e who br ing the bes t things walk so se r ious ly and modestly along, as if they were i n the per formance of a sac r ed duty, for which they scarcely es t e em thems elves wort hy? The B i s hop of Carlisle, in hi s pa per on “T he Unifor mity of Nature, ” sugge sts the a nswer to all who are prepared to a ppr oa ch the abys s whic h has hitherto divided phys ical sc ience from spiri tu- al scienc e, -- an abys s which i s soon to be illumined by the sunlight of demons tr ation and spa nned by the bridge of know l e dge. T o quote from the pa per of the B ishop of Carlisle, \"There are ma t te r s of the highest m ome nt which ma ni fes tly do lie outside the domain of physical sci- ence . T he pos sibility of the continuance of human existe nce in a spiri tua l form after the ter mina- tion of physical lif e is , beyond contr a di c ti on, one of the grande st and mos t momentous of possi- biliti e s, but in the nature of things it l ie s outside physics . Yet there is not hing abs olut e ly abs urd, nothing which contr a di c ts a ny human ins ti nc t , in t he suppos ition of such poss ibil ity; c onsequent- ly, the s tudent of physica l sc i e nce, even if l ie cannot find time or i nc li na ti on to look into s uch matters him s elf, m a y well have pa ti e nce w i th those who c an. And be may e asily af ford to be gen- erous; t he field of phys i c al s cience is grand enough for any ambit ion, and there is room enough in the wide wor ld both for physic al and f or psychica l resea r ch.\" But doe s ps ychical rese ar c h lie outside the domain of physical s cience? What is the supe r natural but the higher workings of laws which we c all na t ural, as far a s we have bee n able to inves tigate them? Is not the supernatural, then, jus t as legitimate a subjec t of conside r ation, for the t ruly sci- entific mind, as i s t he natural? If it expla i n, satisfactorily, phenomena which cannot be other wis e explained, there is no good rea son why its aid should not be invoked by t he men of scienc e. The trut h is, that the or dinary c our s e of nature is one continued miracle, one c ont inue d manif e station of the D i vine mind. \"Ever ything which is, is thought, \" s ays Amiel, \" but not c onscious and i ndi- vidual thought.

And dur ing t he se t w enty years of “dead-work\" t he dis- coverer of e t he r ic f orce has pursued t he even tenor of his way, under circums t a nces which s how him to be a giant in i nte l le ctual greatnes s, insens ible to paltry, hostile criticism, patient under op- position, dead to all temptations of s elf -interest, calmly superior t o t he mi s judgments of the short-sighted and the ignoble; noble means as indispens able to him a s noble e nds; fame and r ich- es les s im portant t ha n his honor; his joys arising from the accomplishme nt of his work and the love and t he sympathy of the few who have comprehended hi m! \" Only the noble-hearted can un- derstand the noblehearted. \" M r .

It ha s been jus tl y s aid that we have no ground f or as suming that we have approache d a lim it in the field of dis covery, or f or c l a im ing f inality in our int e r pretations of Nature; that w e have, a s yet, only li fted one c omer of the c ur tain, enabling us t o peep at s om e of the machinery by which her oper a t ions ar e effected, w hi le much more remains c oncealed; and that w e know little of the marvels which in course of time may be made c lear to us . Ear ne st minds in all age s and in all countries have arr ive d at the same i nference s which M r . Kee- ly has reached in his res earches , - viz ., that the one int e ll ige nt f orce i n natur e is not a mere mathe- matical dyna mi s m in s pace and time, but a tr ue Power exis t ing in its type and fulnes s, -i n one word, God. You ma y sa y that such an inference belongs to religion, not to scienc e; but you can- not divorce the two. No sys tematic distinction between philosophical, r eligious , and scie nt ific ideas ca n be main- tained. All the three run into one another with the most pe r fect legitimacy. Their di s soc i a ti on can be effected only by art, t he ir divorce only by violence .
