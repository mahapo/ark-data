FARADAY. The working pa r t of this device c onsists , f irst, of an outs i de ring ca r rying on its i ns ide face nine pieces -- equidis tant fr om each other -- - called pola r accele r ators; which c onstitute the polar field or polar c i rcuit. Second, anothe r r ing of less diame t e r , s ituated ins ide of the larger ring, and carrying on i ts face eight di s ks, with a triple grouping in each, repres enting the depolar field, or field of high polar interf erence . In the Centre i s plac ed a resona t ing intensifier, t hrough which the sympathetic curr e nts pa ss . By a spiro- vibrophonic a r rangement these currents ar e diverted towa r d the ne ut ral Centre of the earth. T his de vi c e is the sympathetic mult iplying agent for the polar field, and the negatizing agent f or t he anti-polar field. When under action i t is entir ely subs ervient to t he transmitter, both in regard t o high intens if ica ti on and t horough neutr a l iz ation of polar a nd depolar i ntercha nge. THE PHI LOSOPHY OF I TS AC T ION. The circles containing the s ensitize d disks -- both pol a r and de polar - are i n sympathe t ic relation to the polar nega t ive circuits of the e art h, a nd in a condition t o be br ought int o action by the negative tr a nsmitter . The sympathetic conditions of the polar and depola r f ield of the cir c ui ts remain latent until the tr ans mitt e r is ass ociated and the intr oductory i mpuls e given. Then conditions ass ert thems elves which demonstrate the wonderful power of sympathetic action in abeya nce to the la ws by which they a r e governed. The introductor y impulse r e pr es ents the s ympathetic chor d of unity to polar attraction. When thi s is given, the pol a r outr ea ch is immediately establis hed in the polar cir cuit, which se eks to as similate its elf to the anti-pol a r , or triple groupings; but as the alternation of the two c ir cuits repr e sents a condition of s ympathetic a ntagonism ( as 8 is to 9), an intens if ied diff erentiated wave motion is induced between the two, thus de velopi ng eight a lt e r nations , or waves , to one revolution of the device. Cons equently, an equation c annot be esta bl is hed on acc ount of this negative int e r ference, w hi c h repr e sents the power exe r ted to bring about sympathetic equation between the neutral centre of terr e stri a l gravity and sympathetic outreach, 1 t he power that induces plane tar y sus pension. Ever y revoluti on of the cir c ui ts represe nts e ight distinct polar and depolar wave s. When the maximum (fi ve hundred revolutions per minute) is reache d, t he r e are f our thous and polar and depolar interchange s. In s ympathetic philos ophy the polar circuit represents the brain power of the i ns tr ume nt , or t he medium of im pregna t ion f rom c elestial r a diating outfl ow ; the depolar circuit represe nt s the organism, which is actuated to do t he s ym pa thetic work a s dictated by the sa me powe r , or e l e ment, 2 t ha t virt ua ll y operates our phys ical organis m s ; the work done repr e senting the powe r expended to equa t e the power transmitted, although t he movements in t he physic al organism are much mor e complicated.

The ae r ial pr ope l le r has a sympathetic polar accumulator a nd dis per s er in one ins tr ument, which is entir e ly distinct f rom a ny of the devices intended for terr es tr ial use; also other mecha nical adjuncts not needed on land nor water. All forms of non- s ympathetic ma chiner y have, a ssoc iated with them, conditions of centri fugal for ce on the ratio of t he velocity induced; the diverging power f rom the centre of i nduc ti on being governed specifically by its gr a vi ta l weight according to t he diameter i t occupies in it s c i rcle of rotation. In a sympathetic negative circuit this or de r of conditions is r eve r s ed; for the power of neutral attraction draws the molecules of any mass , no matter what the weight, toward the centre of rotation (instead of toward its periphery) according to the intens ity of the negative vibr ation that is induced upon that par ticula r cir c l e . Our ea r th, in i ts routine of r evolution, is governed by the same law i n every pa r ticular; its mas s tending towa r d its centr e of ne ut rality w i th a f orce that is equivalent to the character a nd velocity of its rot a ti on. 3 If it s rotation w er e increas ed, the te ndency of everythi ng as sociated with it would be incr e ased toward its centre of neutralit y on the sa me ratio. T ha t is, a pound i n weight would, under c er tain conditions of increase d velocity, bec om e two pounds i n weight. The laws governing the sympathetic rot a ti on of vibrator y machinery a r e the s ame laws that gove r n planetary suspe nsion. To those who have not witness ed the operation of my device s, my theories must indeed seem wild; but the laws of na t ure are the sa m e yes ter da y today and forever. T he y know no change ; and sympathetic physics , demonstrated mechanically, mus t tri umph over all ridi c ule and opposition i n the end. T o contr a dict the laws governing s ym pa thetic rotation is to contradict the laws governing plane tar y sus pension, a s I am prepared t o demons t rate. If the e ar th were rotated on a sha f t by mecha nical force, the pr es ent c ondit ion of its r otations would be reverse d; everything on its s urf ac e would f ly off at a tangent, on t he ratio of the velocity i nduc ed. T he equilibri um of all things would also be c hanged. The gyrosc ope reveals as tounding facts in r elation to this philosophy, even when operated mechanic ally. No other known device is so nearly as socia t e d with sympathetic vibr atory phys ics. The vitalization of the dis ks f or t he polar a nd depolar field i s e stablishe d on t he ratio of thirds, sixths , and ninths ; the nint hs be i ng the cir cuit occupied by the polar field, must repres ent, in the sc ale of vi ta l iz ed focalized intensity, 100 in my s ystem: sixths in the depolar field, or 66 2 / 3 ; a nd in the neutral field, or thirds, 33 1 / 3 . The t riplets must r e pr es ent one true c hor d of equation. The sympa t he ti c transmitter transfers any degr e e of intens ity des ir e d fr om zero up to disintegration; all the transfers being made above the l ine of the f irst inaudible, as as sociated with my r e sonating sys tem of t rans f e r .

T he peculiarity of the sympathetic conditions which c onserve a magne t to polar and anti-polar curr e nt s of t he ea r th, prove pe r fect sympathetic equation be tween r ec eption and distribution in tha t part of the electrical f ield which is cla ssified, in my sys tem, as inter- atomic vibrator y oscillation. Thi s os cillation represe nt s , in its corpusc ul a r f ield of action, an alternating wave - motion of one hundred a nd twenty-eight thous and four hundred vibratory exc hanges per s econd, betwe en polar reception and depolar distri bution, thus es tablishing its perfect s ympathetic concordance to that thir d of the electric triple s tr ea m which r e pr es ents the sixths in vibrator y sympathe t ic physic s. The s ympathetic a ction of the magnet, when electrically s ensitized, be comes subs ervient to pol a r attraction as a medium t hrough which a port ion of its f low is diver te d; no longe r latent, but highly ac ti ve as long as its m a gnetic s ympathy (as elec t rically induced) continues , and it will then ass ociate i ts elf with e ver y medium in natur e in which this element exists in i ts latent state, fr om steel to oxygen at a low temper a tur e. We have now reac hed a sta r ting-point fr om which to obtain a conception of the ma nner in which a magnet c an be neutralized, that i s , robbed of its coincident unity, or subs ervi e nce t o polar negative attr a ction. The vibration of the polar magnetic flow represents one hundred a nd twenty-eight thous and four hundred os cillations per se cond, or one-thir d of the triplet of electri c al induction, cons equently the m a gnet mus t be in pure c oncor da nt sympa t he ti c union wit h this r a t e of vibration, in its polar field, to become a medium of receptivene ss as well as a m e dium of distribution of polar negative sympa t hy.

If a c ondit ion of antagonis ti c vibration is brought to be ar upon this focal centre - the magnet - its concordant sympathy t o the pol a r sympathetic volume is broken up, i nduc ing sympa t he ti c diss ociation; which means pos it ive neutralization, as far as its latent e nergy can be di s tur be d or diverted from receptivenes s and di s tr ibution.
