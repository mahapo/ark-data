S ome slight expla nati on of the na tur e of s ound, a nd of certain of its phenomena, may be nec ess ary to make clear to t he general reade r t he se ex- periments of Mrs. Hughe s. A simple conception of a s ound- wa ve m a y be gained by the use of a device of P rofess or Tyndall. A small c ol lodion ball oon f illed with explos i ve gas es is ignited. T he repor t se ems to reach the ea r as the f las h is s een, but there is a fr ac ti on of a s econd betwee n them. T he s ound has bee n traveling from the poi nt of explos ion to the ear of t he obs er ve r . It has not been con- veyed bodily, a s matter shot out f rom that c en- ter, nor borne to it by the movement of the air. If s uch had been the ca se, the liste ner would have bee n s tr uck by a hurr icane progress ing a t the rate of about se venty- five miles an hour. The wa ve- motion constituting s ound adva nc- es , w hi le the medium in which the wa ve is for med – the air – only oscillates . Thi s is tr ue of wa ve- motion generally.

An or dinary s even-octave piano ranges from 33 vibr ations pe r se cond, three octaves be l ow the middle C, to 4224, four oc taves above the middle C . The s implest f orm of musica l vibration is t ha t generated by a s tr etc hed string.

T ake a common piece of boa r d a bout for ty-two inches long, a piece of f ine br a ss wire, or , better still, a violin or guitar string about s ixt y i nc hes long, a tape-meas ure, a nd two triangular bits of w ood an inch and a half long on the vert ic al s ide a nd with an inc h bas e.

Fas ten the wir e to one sc r ew - eye , and, letti ng it pas s over the two bridges and through the se cond s crew-eye, weight it by f a stening a f la t iron on the over- hanging end. Having put some bit s of pa per cut in a Y shape astride the string, set the string into mus ical vibr ation by gently pluck- ing i t at its middl e point. It wil l sw i ng bac k and fort h past the dotted line which indicates its position when at res t, taking pos itions A a A and A a' A (Fig. 2) in rapid succe ss i on. T he paper r ide r s , are t hrown by the vi bration. Now touch lightly with the finger the point ove r the number 18 and pluck the s tr ing at 27. T he light touch of your f inger, or even of a feather, will serve as the fr e t does on t he guitar – t he r e are now two s tr ings practica ll y half the former length. Ins t e ad of vibrating as a whole , like A, it first t a kes the position IB, a nd then 2B, a nd back and forth, going f rom one to the other with light ning-like r a pidi ty. I t is ea sy to see that the middle point of the s tr ing is compara- tively m otionles s; suc h a point of rest in musi- cal vibration i s called a node. T he riders re- main on the node, but ar e t hrown from the vibrating segments . A gave out a c er ta i n not e ; B, being half as long, gives out a note a n oc- tave above A. Again put the r iders on t he wire, touch with a f e ather the point 27, a nd pluc k the s t ring half- w ay between 27 and 36 ( Fig. I ), the touch a t 27 makes of tha t point a node, but bes ides that it m a kes a node at 18 and at 9. The string C (Fig. 2) is practica l ly one - fourth as long as it wa s at first; it has f our vibrating or ventral s egments and t hree nodes , and is equal to f our nine-i nc h s tr ings vibr ating to- gether. P utting the riders along the stri ng you will s ee that the y s ettl e at the nodes c c' c '' a nd are thr own violently off from the vibrating se gments. The apparatus i s so rough t ha t the nodes are not really points of r es t, and the rid- ers ma y not stay on, but the agitation is mani- festly very much less a t the nodes than on the ventral segments of the s tr ing. With the a ppa- ratus desc r ibed I have suc ceeded a num be r of times i n agitating the s tr ing s o that the r iders on the nodal points r e m a i ne d while those on the ventr a l se gm e nts w er e all di s mounted. A string is a very simple vi brating body a nd moves only in one vertical plane , but it s er ve s, for that very reas on, as t he bes t illustrati on of vibrating se gments and nodes . In t he m ove ment of B a nd C f rom position I to 2 there is not the violent reversal tha t t he r e ap- pears to be – the wa ve gene r ate d by t he pull a t a (IB a nd IC) runs along the s t ring to the end, and fr om that point it is ref le cted back in the direction 2B and 2C. If t he att e mpt is ma de to touch t he s t ring, or dampen it, as it is techni- cally called, at a ny point not a n e xact divi s or of 36, the r es ult would have bee n a joggle, not a vibr ation; the wa ve would not have reache d the far end of the wir e in the r ight phas e to be ref le cted ba ck regularly. So f ar we have only been considering the sim- ples t vibr ations , a single wave running bac k and for th on a string; but in sound-waves , as in water- wa ves, motion is superpos ed up on motion, ripples upon waves, in an inconc eiva- ble complexit y. If we could produce by the sonorous body only s uch simple vibrati ons as thes e w e ha ve been examining, all musical in- struments, including the human voice, would sound exactly alike, so f ar as quality is con- cerned. The only possible dif ference would be in r ange and intensity. W e c ould not distin- guish the notes of a F rench horn f rom t hos e of a guitar.

The hi ghe r notes produced by these latter vibr ations a r e c alled the harm onics of the string. And s o it is with othe r s ounding bodies ; we have in a ll cas es a coexis tence of vibrations. Higher tone s mingle with the fun- damental one, and it i s their intermixtur e which determines wha t , for want of a better term, we call the qualit y of t he sound.\" A nd again, later on, he says : “Pur e sounds without overtones would be li ke pure water, flat and dull. The tone s, for exa m ple , of wide-stoppe d organ- pipe s are almost perf ec tl y pure. . . . B ut the tones of s uch pipes , t hough mellow, would soon weary us; they are without f orce or char- acter, and would not satis f y t he demand of the ear f or brightnes s and e ner gy.

I n this way, where the vibr a t ing body it- se lf is inca pable of furni s hing the over tone s, they are s uppli e d f rom external sources . \" In fact, the ca r demands that each note sha l l be a harmonic chord, pow er fully dominated by the fundamental tone though it may be. The determini ng value in the overtones of an instrument wa s felt, pr a ctically, l ong befor e their exis tence was known in theory. Makers of musical ins tr uments learned long ago how to que nch ce r tain objectionable over tone s, even before t he y knew jus t wha t they were do- ing. Imagine what the air would l ook like if it could be made visible when an orchestra is se t into vibration, with thousands of tones a nd their attendant ove r tones cross ing and recross - ing with inf inite complexities of for m. T he diff erent notes are not e ach making its s epar- ate mark, but all have combined, helping or hindering one another, and coming as a s i ngle full harmony to the ear, where ther e is a r es o- lution of the compos i te moveme nt ; and this marvelous “lut e of thr e e thousa nd strings\" takes up the tangled s kein of sound, s eparates it int o its c onstituent tones, and conveys t he m se par a tely to t he brain. The ide a of getting a vis ual e xpr es sion for mu- sic al vibr ations occurr e d t o C hladni, a physi- cis t of the las t ce nt ury.

Squar e plates of glas s or metal sc r ew ed or even glued to a c en- tral support c an be made by the meres t tyro with tools , and give wonderful results (F ig. 3). A plate, like a string, has one rate of vibration which belongs to it, but again, like a stri ng, by “dampening” it with a touch of the f inge r or finger s i n diff erent points along t he e dge the note c hanges and with i t the figur e made by the s and. The lines on the pla t e where the sa nd se tt le s are the nodes , the lines of c om pa r a t ive rest. T he violent agitation in the parts left ba r e can be s hown by m ixing a little lycopodium powder with the s and; this is exces sively light, and is c aught in t he little whirlwinds of air generated about the vibrati ng se gments.

A li ttle instrument invented by Profess or Sed- ley Taylor , and c alled the phoneidos cope, gives a mos t exquis it e illustration of music made visible. It cons ists of a tube which termi- nates i n a hollow cup or f unnel-sha ped en- largement; over the mouth of this f unne l a thin she et of metal or pas teboard with a smooth- edged and symmetrical opening is made. Across the opening a f ilm of soap-suds is drawn and l e f t to s tand till colors be gi n to for m. These s oap-bubbl e colors, a s is very well known, are due to the thickne ss of the fil m. In an ordinar y soap-bubble they flit over the surface irr egula r ly. This is bec ause from the e xposed oute r surf ac e of the bubble , and the irr e gul a r force which i s expanding it from within, the film is always va r ying in thicknes s. The color s tell ine xor ably jus t how much this variation is at every point of the surface. A spe cial f luid, made ve r y carefully, is nec ess ary for experiments with the phoneidoscope, be- caus e the s oap- film must thin sufficiently to show bright c ol ors and yet be strong enough to s t a nd the vibrations into which it is thr ow n by t he voice. When the colors ar e we ll es tablished in the fil m a s ustaine d musica l note should be su ng into the open e nd or m outhpiec e of the tube, using care not to br e athe or blow into it. T he colors begin to move, and, if the note is sus - tained, whirl into the most beautiful gyrating figur es . M r . B ehnke, in a discus sion befor e the Mus ical Ass ociation of E ngla nd, says : \" I have for many years tried to get what help I c ould fr om scie nce in the tr e atment of the human voice, a nd when Prof es sor S e dl e y Taylor some years ago brought this phoneidoscope under my notice I was very highly delighted. He told me it would be pos sible by means of a soa p- film to ge t dif ferent figures f or differ e nt pitches , for dif ferent intens iti e s, and for dif fer- ent qualities of tone. .. . I did not f ind the pho- neidos cope answe r in prac t ice . In the fir s t place there was great diff iculty about these fil ms , which w oul d continually burst. In the se cond plac e there w as no doubt I did get a va- riety of fi gures , and not only that, but a vari e ty of exc eedingly bea uti ful c olor s . T he experi- ments were most fas cinating; but I did not ge t the same figures regular ly for the sa me c hang- es in either pitch or i nte nsity or qua li ty, a nd therefor e, s o far as practical res ul ts were con- cerned, the instrum e nt was of no use.. .. Of course it does not foll ow be cause we ha ve not yet succe eded in these matters we ne ver sha ll .\" We are now upon the ver y threshold of M rs. Hughes 's voi c e-f igures, and have r ea ched it by the s ame path which brought her to t he m in the fir s t instanc e. H er eidophone is construct- ed on the s ame principle as the phoneido- sc ope; instea d of the frail lamina of s oap-suds she has a s tr e t c hed membr a ne of india-rubber to receive the vibrations, and on this is sprea d a thin layer of some pas ty subs tance which will retain the r e cor d made by the vi brations of the me m brane. These voice-fl ow er s are not the s imple vis ual for ms corresponding with the vibrations of the air s et in motion by the voice. T he waves generated in the closed bowl of the eidophone are reflected again a nd aga in fr om the sides of the vess el. T he vol ume of air inclose d has its own rate of vi bration; the stretched membrane has als o its own rate, which in turn is modif ied by the character a nd thicknes s of the pa ste s pr ea d upon it. A dded to thes e a r e molecula r for ce s of cohe sion and ad- hes ion between the par ticle s of pas t e , a nd again betwee n the pas te a nd the membrane. The f orm w hi c h grows into sha pe is the r e sul- tant of all t he se complicated for ce s, and, i n some instance s, new e l e ments of cha nge have been added. A glas s plate is placed on top of the vibr ating membr a ne a nd moved over it. We have a new body intr oduc ed wit h its prop- er r a te of vibration, bes ides a mec hanical mo- tion furt he r to complicate the pr oblem. The res ult s a r e very w onder ful and bea uti ful, and open up a f ield f or investigation w hi c h is most interesting, but so f a r we have the r e sul- tant of many f orces , not one of which has bee n weighed and meas ured. I n a letter fr om M rs. Hughes , replying to some ques ti ons aske d in the hope of gr e ater accurac y, s he s ays: “T he notes producing the figures vary ne cess arily with the weight of mate r ial us ed and the ten- sion of t he membr a ne, so that any one note may, under di fferent cir c umstances , produce diff erent figur e s, and, conve r s ely, differ e nt"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Vis ib le So und - pa ge 12 of 12 notes may, unde r diff erent circumstance s, pro- duce similar figur e s.\" The daisy forms were s ung int o s hape, she sa ys, by extremely low notes ve r y softly sounde d, some of them by A in the fir s t s pace of the bas s clef – a wonderf ul note to be reached by a woman's voic e, whose highes t note is the B-flat above the tr eble c lef , a com- pas s of over three octaves .
