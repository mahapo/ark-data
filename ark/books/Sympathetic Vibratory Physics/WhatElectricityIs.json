It was only par- tially deve loped under t he conditions of this quadruple force. In the year 1888 the tea chings of “The A ncients\" regarding what we call e l e ctr icity and magne ti s m we r e brought to Ke ely's notice; and taking up another line of r e search, he soon became convince d that t he for c e he had discov- ered f ourteen years bef ore, is the thir d curr ent of the triune stream of electri c it y or “nega ti ve at- traction. \" “The A ncients \" t a ught that t he se f orces w hi c h we call electri c it y and magnetism ar e one and the sa me, and tha t between them is \" a ne ut ral f orce.\" When a force becomes neutral it is ina ctive, and is no longer a for ce ; cons equently the name given is mislea ding, Keely c alls t his third ele - ment “ the latent neutral, \" which is a better name for it. Dr. Pancoas t , in his book on the Ka bbala, gives the Kabbalistic teachings in hi s ow n words, regarding nature's mos t powerful agent, the tri une polar flow. He wri te s: “ E lectricity is a peripher a l, pol a r f orce moving out of equilibr ium, i. e., independently. Ma gnetism is a polar for c e moving in equilibri um. They ar e one and t he s ame in e ss ence and powe r ; and their s ource is light:\" the light f rom the gr e at ce nt ral sun of the uni- verse, a r ound which all sola r sys tems r evolve. Ther e is but one diff erence betwe en them. In e l e ctr icity two forces are ne ver found in one s ub- sta nce. In the tr ue magnet t he y are both prese nt in a n active state , but in e xact equilibrium. I n a magnetic body both ar e prese nt, neutr al and i na ctive. Ter res tr ial magnetism is the earth's electricity. T he atmosphe r ic vapors of the e ar th abs or b the greater part of the ca lor ific rays , and the actinic r ays pa ss almost entir e ly into the earth; the f or- mer bec ome cha r ged with the positive, and the l a t te r with the negative f orce; and thus the nega- tive be comes characteristic of the earth, and the positive of the a i r. Then the rain falls and the hail a nd the snow, be ar ing the pos iti ve with t he m; which, upon enteri ng the eart h, is compe l le d to c om e into a s t a te of ha r mony with the earth's negative; the two poles a cting in e quil ibrium cons ti tute magnetism. He nce t he earth i ts elf becomes a powerful magnet; and e ver ything earthl y partakes of its nature, in s ome de gr ee . What Far a day c all e d diamagne t ic bodies are bodi e s containing one electric force only, and con- se quently are not magnets in any s ense of the word. In both electri c it y and magnetism t he r e are the two opposite f orces , the pos it ive and the ne gative. In both, the two for c es attr a ct ea ch other, and each r e pels it s kind. In e lectr ic i ty the two are ne ver present in the sa m e body. In both there is betwee n the two for ces a \"NEUT R AL FORCE, \" whic h places its elf , in electricity, as a r es istant wall betwe en two opposing clouds, or a positive cloud and the magne t ic earth. In a magnet, where the two f orces a r e always pres ent actively in the one subs tance, the neutral appe ars midwa y in the subs tance; sepa r ating the two, a nd thus preventing their blending wit h and neutr a li z i ng eac h other. I n the natur al magnet t he equator shows neither attraction nor repuls ion, becaus e the attr a ctive powe r of eac h ingredient of the natural is rendered inoperative by the pres ence of the ot he r . (See \" The T r ue Science of Light , \" by S e t h Pancoas t, M.D.) Thi s late nt neutral force K eely ha s dive r ted, a nd brought about “coordination betwee n the two mediums, c elestial r adia t ion and t e r res t rial sympathetic outr ea ch. \" But light is not only t he s our ce of thes e f orces , it is also the great electro-m a gnetic polarizer. In the f ormation of the atom it r e ceives the pol a r energy that gives it its individualit y; its pol a r ity cons tantly change s i n droppi ng old a nd putting on new af finities; but the tendency i s to equilibr i- um, or harmony.

(S e e “ R ed and Blue Light , \" by the la t e Dr. Seth Pancoa st.) \"W i th our prese nt knowledge,\" wr ites M r. Keely, \"no defini tion can be given of this latent force; which, pos ses sing all the conditions of attr ac ti on and r epuls ion as soc i a t e d with i t, is free of m a g- netism. If it is a condition of e lectr ic i ty, robbed of all e l e ctr ica l pbenomena, or a magne t ic for c e, rebellant to the phe nom e na a ssoc iated with magnetic de velopment, the only phil os ophical con- clus i on I can arr ive at is tha t this indefinabl e elem ent is the soul of matter . W er e not e ver y for m of matter, even to the cerebral convolutions of the br a i n, impregnated with this latent element of for ce , which is s ympathetically s ubservient t o celes tial radiation, nature would be l ike a still- born child, or a marbl e s t a tue - de ad to the s ympathetic a ssoc iation that i nduc es moti on.

Spirit ua l sc ience, religous scienc e, teache s tha t when the fiat w ent for th, “Let t he r e be li ght!\" the la t e nt celes tial radiation t ha t illumi ne s t he universe was liberated. When \"the breath of life\" was breathed into man, he was impregnated wit h that la t e nt soul ele- ment tha t made him “a living and moving being.\" “In wha tever direction one pursues phys ical s cience,\" writ e s P rofess or Dolbear, \"he is at l a st c on- fr onted with a physic al phenomenon with a supe r phys ical a nt e cedent where all physical methods of inves ti ga ti on are impotent.\" But Sym pa thetic Physic s shows us that the ways of D eity are not pas t findi ng out; and He who was endow ed with wisdom from on high “proved His di vine authority by r eve aling thes e wa ys t o His disc i ples , and by conformi ng to them in all thi ngs Hims elf . “ “How blind we have all be en! \" writes the r eve r ed Dr. Fur nes s, D.
