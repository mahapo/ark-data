[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Psychological Armoring Dale Pond 01/24/06 updated 01/28/06 The REAL issue or question (in religious or political discussions) is why do so many seemingly intelligent people grab onto religious beliefs as a drowning man grabs onto a fl oat? Why do these people hold themselves and their narrow understandings as the be all and end all of knowledge or so-called TRUTH? Why do these unquestioning believers hold strictly to their own version of (un)reality and scorn all others? Thus condemning (instead of loving as Jesus and Buddha taught) all those who believe differently? Why do people hold such rigid and unyielding beliefs in the face of common sense, history, syllogistic logic and solid scientifi c evidence? The answer, I've come to learn, is FEAR. The greater the fear these people have the greater the tenacity they hold onto some/any belief system they feel relieves or abates their always imagined FEARS - or so they misthink. These ones are TERRIFIED of life and people (they've been hurt too much and too often) and are therefore using whatever handy religious or political (sometimes both) beliefs as a fortifi cation, a barrier, wall or armor against life coming in and hurting them again. People who use seemingly infi nite excuses to not engage in social activities such as: they are liberals, they are conservatives, I/they can't dance, they are baptists or catholics or jews or homosexuals or whatevers - which libelous labels serve only to divide and separate from \"them\" so as not to engage others preventing being hurt again. Another form or source of terror is the belief one will not make it into heaven or one's soul will be lost if time and attention are not devoted to studying the Bible. It is supposed this fanatical belief originates in a fear of death or maybe the fear of the unknown associated with death (loss of consciousness or sense of self). Sometimes, it is theorized, this adherence to this belief in religious authority originated because one has greatly suffered in relationships, business and other social situations (life in general). In trying to come to terms with all the pain, suffering and fear one is driven into the arms of any authority that shows some level of comfort, protection, hope and greener grass. In short, it is still fear that drives these ones into sundry belief systems created to appear to abate fear and give hope. This state of mind also permeates modern organized structures such as large hierarchal businesses and governments where a fear-fi lled person seeks out a niche wherein they perceive themselves as being safe, comfortable and having some degree of control over their lives. These ones are especially dangerous as they adapt the so-called \"law of the fi ttest\" to protect their pitiful little niche from all comers. Those motivated by fear are dangerous in direct proportion to their fears. The more threatened they feel themselves to be the more inclined they are to use violence to abate that fear or protect that which is perceived as their security. Hence our history of inquisitions, religious and political persecutions,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"conquests of countries, etc. All the ills of our histories can be laid at the feet of fear and its abatement. This erection of walls, boundaries, barriers and etc. is called \"psychological armoring\" by the psychiatric profession. Denial is a powerful barrier and is usually the fi rst tactic to fend off a perceived threat. Invalidating anothers' opinions and/or beliefs is a strong barrier that usually precedes violence. Racism (another form of invalidation) is an undeniable barrier and armoring. Religious arrogance and political bigotry are armored barriers. Psychological armoring is not an illness unless carried to extremes (like religious or political fanatics sometimes do) but instead is a trait shared to some degree by almost everyone. Diverse people express this armoring in diverse ways. I have it; you have it and most likely everyone we know practices armoring to some degree. In some disciplines armoring is considered as a method or tactic used \"to not feel love\". For some, being open and loving is terrifying so keeping people and circumstances at bay beyond the armor effectively shields one from being intimate, trusting, open and loving. Goggle \"psychological armoring\" and see how this dynamic works though most of what you will fi nd is focused on the physical body as in a stiffening of the body against imagined attack. Armoring also brings about a 'stiffening' of personality, attitude, opinion, will and character as in obtuse, opinionated, fanatical, hard headed, wrong headed and bull headed people can sometimes be. Armoring is a form of warfare waged upon those we wish to distance ourselves from with the use of walls, armor, barriers, etc. Armoring can be dissolved in diverse ways through therapies, workshops, etc. It is sometimes called 'moving into love' or allowing one's self to again know God's Love by letting go of self-created and imagined fears. The complete letting go of armoring is as what we've been calling \"Awakening\" which was shown to us by Jesus when he awakened from those beliefs around him into all encompassing and unconditional Love for everyone regardless of their social backgrounds or religious beliefs."}]
