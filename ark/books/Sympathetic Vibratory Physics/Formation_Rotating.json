Rogers on Rota ting Rin gs of Air and L iqu ids ON ROTATING RINGS OF AIR A ND LIQ U IDS It has long been a familiar fact tha t the bubbl e s of phosphuretted hydr ogen gas cons isting of P H 3 with an admixture of PH 2 , give rise by t he i r explos ive combustion in the air to a r ing of white vapor- like phos phor ic acid, which dilating a s it as cends exhibits a rotati on of e ach ver tica l ele- ment around the curved axis of t he figure. A similar motion i s sometimes dis cerni ble in the smoke fr om a c annon, and i n the steam which e sca pes by momentary puffs f rom a s t e am- pipe , and as e xper t s moker s know, suc h revolving ri ngs are rea di ly produced by ejecting the smoky breath in a peculiar manner from the r ounde d opening of the lips . In s tudyi ng recently the phenomena of air-j e ts, I have been led t o a somewhat criti c al exa m i- nation of t he conditi ons under which these ring-di s charges ar e pr oduce d. By the us e of s uitable arr a ngements I have bee n able not only t o trace t he development of the rings produced in air projected f rom a per tures , but to detect similar movements in t ha t which is r e lease d by the burst- ing of an or dina r y bubble.

I. Of the air-rings f or med by momentary dis- charge s f r om an ape rture. 1. M ode of produc i ng t he air-rings . - To ren- der the for m and inter na l movements of t he es - caping air in such c ases dis t inctly vi s ible, I us e a large glas s rese r voir, (fig. 1) in which the a i r is kept opaque by a continual supply of chloride of ammonium ge nerated wit hin. To t he top of the jar is a dapted, by gr inding and a n unctuous c e- ment, a zinc or glas s cover pierced with t hree holes , viz . : a central round apertur e one i nc h in diameter, a nd two others of much sma l le r s ize, eac h fur nis hed with a short s ocket-tube r is i ng above the plate. Of these , one i s intende d for con- necting w i th tubes of dis charge, and is kept c losed w hen the c entr a l or ifice i s in us e. The other receives a s lender glas s tube, entering above by a rectangular bend and de scending to wit hin two inches of the bott om of the jar. At i ts outer end this is connected with a f lexible pipe through which the ope r ator, i mpe l ling the a ir in s ucces sive puffs into the lower part of t he vess el, c an at will eject corr e sponding volumes of the cloudy air through either of the apertur e s. For t his pur - pose he may either us e the m outh, or a gum- e l a stic bag attached to the end of the tube - the for - mer be i ng in m os t c ases the preferable ins tr ument. At equal di s tances on opposite s i de s of the central hole, two hooks are affi xe d to the lower s ur face of t he plate, f rom which a r e sus pended long s lips of thick cotton cloth. To prepare the apparatus for experiment, we remove t he c over and pour into the j a r common hydrochlor ic a cid t o the de pt h of half an inch, adding to it one or two c ubi c i nc hes of nitr ic ac id."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Pag e 3 P r o fess or W.

The included air quickly becomes opaque with the dens e cloud of chlor ide, and by applying the lips to the fr ee end of the flexible tube may be expelled f rom the apertur e which i s left un- clos ed, either in the f orm of s ucce ssive puffs or of a c onti nuous jet. It is almost nee dl e ss t o s ay that in making the experiment the s ur rounding air should be as littl e moved as pos sible, the slightes t agitation near the apertur e sufficing to mar the s ymmetr y of the eff ec t . 2. Stages of the ring-formation.- When by a m ode r ate l y s tr ong impulse the cloudy air of the jar is to iss ue in a succ ess ion of quick but not viol e nt puff s , e ach little cloud ass umes near the a per - ture the f orm of a ring, which gr adua ll y dilating as it r is es retains it s s ymmetr y until it ha s reached the height of two or sometimes eve n of three f ee t above the opening. Us i ng a gentler a nd les s sudde n impulse we caus e t he ring as it asc ends to ca r ry w i th it a tr a in of c l oudy air which forms the downw ard contin- uation of the inner por tion of the coil. With a s till lighter breathing at the mouth- piece we may expe l the air in s o gentle a wave as to be able to mark t he es caping cloud rolling slowly over on each side of the a per ture without breaking its conne cti on with the central mas s - the whole thus as suming the appea r anc e of the top of a column adorned with volutes . I n these experiment no actual r ing is generated, but we have the opportuni ty of watching the beginning of s uch a form and tr a cing the mechanica l movements to which it owe s its development. In fig. 2 the earliest s t a ge is indicated by a , a nd the imperf ec tl y for me d ring wit h part of the attache d train by b , the lateral sections of the ri ng only be i ng repr e sented. When the disc harge i s pr oduc ed by a stronger impulse than in the cas e f irst mentioned, t he r e- sulting ring darts upwa r d s o rapidly as to br e ak away f rom its train, leaving the latter either to lag be hi nd as a form le ss mass , or , when r eta i ning suff icie nt velocity, to evolve from its ow n sub- sta nce a s econd and s maller r ing which is se en quickly pur s uing the fir s t. B y applying a yet more energetic f orce, we may ca use the ejec t e d air to form thr e e, f our, or even a greater number of s uch s ucces sively developed r ings . The size of the ring when first for med i s depende nt chief ly on the width of the apert ure, and in some de gr ee a l s o on the s tr e ngt h of the bl a st. With a hole one and a half inch in diameter, and a propor tionally lar ge injecting tube, it is eas y, by a s uitable impuls e of t he breath, to generate rings of from two to three inches in diameter of the most pe r fect symmetr y, a nd having force enough to as cend unbr oke n to a height of six or eight feet. In this way we ma y render thes e beautiful phenome na vis i ble over a large apartm e nt, causing the smoky w r ea t hs to chas e e ach other until flattened agains t the ceiling. If ins t e ad of the mouth we use the e lastic bag as a means of impelli ng the cloudy air, we find that a quick pr es sure and subs equent withdrawal of the hand give ri s e to r ings of gr e at symmetry, and that thes e are usually unac companied by any train. The latter res ult i s evidently due to the sudde n r e coil of the bag, and the c onsequent retraction of the latter part of the cloudy ma ss back into the r e servoir . By continuing the pr e ss ur e s o as to prevent the recoil we may produce the sa me phas es of the phenomena as when the impulse is given by the br ea th. 3. R otation and struc t ur e of the air-rings . - To obtain a dis tinct view of the motion a nd inter - nal structur e of the ring, it should be view ed in a nearly horizontal dir e cti on, and by a strong"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Pag e 4 P r o fess or W. B. Rogers on Rota ting Rin gs of Air and L iqu ids transmitted light. This is conveniently done by placing the apparatus on a table a lit tle below the level of a gas lamp, but at a cons iderable dis t a nce fr om it. It will then be se en tha t the r otation of the ring, either in i ts incipient stage, or w i th the at- tached train, or when entire and separate, has al- ways one direction, the inner cir cumference being carried for w ar d or in the ordinary mode of e xper i- ment upward, and the out e r in t he revers e direc- tion, as shown in fig. 3. I n order that t he eye may readily f ollow this m otion in the interior of the ring while it retains its per fect f orm and r apid r o- tation, the air of the r e servoir should be only mod- erately cloudy, and the impelling for c e quick without being viol e nt. Under thes e circumstanc es we observe the ring to be made up of a coil of c loudy air - betw een the f olds of which is rolled up a s imilar coil of t r anspar ent atmos phere . When the r ing carr ies a train it i s e asy to dis cern that the cloudy spiral is c ont inuous with this attendant m a ss , a nd really iss ues f rom it ne ar the inner circumference of the r ing. In a yet e ar lier sta ge of the action we are able to mark t he beginning of this two-f old spiral by observing how eac h volute a s it dr aws its supply f rom the central mas s gather s in a portion of the c lear external air to be e nf olded between its t urns . 4. Or igin of the rotation. - This is obvious ly pref e r a bl e to the combined age ncy of the out- ward impulse and the resis tance whic h the sides of the iss uing mass encounter from the edge of the opening, and fr om the air into which it i s im pe ll e d. T he for me r of thes e for ce s, due to the tens i on propagated through the res er voir, mus t to some e xt e nt ope r ate in diverging directions, while the r es istance acts in nearly opposite lines . T hus , a t the outset, there would be pr oduce d a reversion or cur ling of the iss uing cloud around t he apert ure, which, a s the ac t ion c ont inued, would be deve l ope d int o the spreading volutes be f ore des cri be d, and at length into the perfect and r a pi dly r e volvi ng ri ng. The dilation of the ring in its asce nt would se em to be the natur a l r e sult of the divergent c har - acter of the impulse impress ed upon the a ir as it pas ses from the or ifice. 5. Horiz ontal bands of t he r ing. - On examining a ring in which t he cle ar and cloudy s pir a ls are pl a inl y distinguishe d, i t will be f ound to ha ve the appearance of alter nati ng layer s or bands of cloudy and compar atively clear air ar ranged horiz ont ally, but which ar e mos t s t rongly marked towards the top and bott om of the r ing, a nd c eas e t o be dis cerned near the m iddle. When the air employed is only moderately cloudy, and the rings a r e large and perfectly developed, this banded appe ar a nce is admir a bl y brought out by a mil d transmitted light, and adds not a lit tle to the beauty of t he revolving and expanding wr e ath. It is eas y t o s ee that this appa r ent s tr uc t ure is a n opt ic al illus i on due to the pas sa ge of the light alternately through a greater and a les s thi c kness of the cloudy lamina of t he compos i te ring. Thus it will be observed ( fig. 3) tha t the rays coming t o the eye in the horizontal plane which pas ses through the upper part of the cloudy s pir al will be much more obs cured than those which pas s in a parallel plane thr ough the clear s pace immediately beneath, the for me r ha ving to pas s lengthwise through a considerable distance in the cloudy l a yer , w hi le the la t te r tr ave r s e little more than twice its thicknes s. T he same relations mus t hold f or the next inner tur ns of the s pir a l, but as its circuit grows na r rower the diff e r e nce between the aggregate of clea r and cloudy por - tions pa ss ed through must continually grow le ss, and near the equa t or of the r ing be come quite inse nsible; hence the bands which are s o distinctly ma r ked towards the top and bottom of the ring disa ppear as we approach its m idwa y line. 6. On the effects produced by a continuous blast.- By s light ly prolonging the im puls e either"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Pag e 5 P r o fess or W. B. Rogers on Rota ting Rin gs of Air and L iqu ids fr om the mout h or the bag s o as t o expe l a comparatively large amount of t he cloudy material at a moderate velocity we are able to mark the pa r tial for mation of a se cond ring in the swollen pa r t of the tr ain which s till a dher e s to the fir s t, and even of a thir d yet more im pe r fect one in the train prolonged below the se cond, the whole s t ill for ming a unit e d mas s. With a c ont inuous and uniform blast of moder a te force the appe ar a nces ar e even more curious and ins tr uc t ive. The column in this cas e retaining it s s mooth cylindrical outline f or only a s hor t dista nce above the apertur e , presents higher up along its sides , and at nea r ly equal in- tervals, a suc cess ion of whorls or volutes, more and more developed as we as cend, and whic h not unfr eque nt ly ter - minate at the top in a nea r ly perf e ct and s eparate r ing, (fig. 4). O n ur ging the blast with a much increas ed velocity thes e lateral marki ngs of the c ol umn become les s conspic- uous, and as sume throughout, ne ar ly to the s ummi t, the as pect of a s er ies of s hor t proj e ctions curving s teeply downwards , like the lowe st and lea st developed vol ute s in the pr ec eding expe r iment. On examining these la t e r a l gyrations as shown in the figur e i t w i ll be see n that each is for me d at the expe nse of the adjacent par ts of the column both above a nd below it. The central arr ows point ing divergingly upward indicate the direction i n which the inner portions of the stream ar e deflected t o unite with t he wider part of t he spiral; the e xt e r ior arr ows dir ec ted downwards mark the r e lati ve ly r etreating motion i m- press ed by the r es istance ac t ing at the s i de s, and show the c our s e of the particles pas sing int o the spiral f rom above . It would seem that thes e movements m us t have the effect, s uperf ic i a l ly a t le ast, of dividing the column into alter na t e t racts of rarefi e d and condense d air , the f ormer situated about midway betwee n the s ucce ssive c oil s , and the latter directly above where the coils unite with the main mas s. Thes e regular a l te r nations , vir tually equivalent to a sys tem of wa ves or vibr a t ions ge ner - ated in the e f fluent stream, indicate the ana l ogy in c ondi tion of large streams of ga seous matter, and the s lender jet in which suc h vi bratory movement has alr e ady been demons tr ated, and point to one of the agenc i e s which may be concerned in the la t te r phenomena. T hey at leas t furnish conclus ive pr oof that e ven a large str eam of gas dischar ged under a s t e ady pres sur e does not flow with continuous uniformity, but be come t he se at of per iodical mov ements at equally r ecur- ring intervals . II . O f th e motion of the ai r pr oduced by the rupture and by th e explos ion of bubbles. As the bea uti ful rings developed by the explos ive combus t ion of phosphuretted hydrogen ga s are f ormed under the i nfluence of f a r more energetic f orces t ha n a r e brought int o play by the ruptur e of a bubble of c om mon air, it becomes impor tant to determine what kind a nd amount of eff e ct is due to the simple bur s ting of the bubble independent of any explosive ac t ion. I have , therefor e, made numer ous experiments on bubbles of common air r e nder e d cloudy as in the pr e- vious experiments, and ha ve be en much intereste d by discove r ing that in all such cas es a distinct rotar y moti on is produce d cor res ponding w i th that of t he air rings alr eady descr ibed. 7. Mode of exper imenting w i th float ing bubbles of air.- In order to observe the movement of the air occas ioned by the bursting of the bubble I use a deep gla ss bowl, into which is pour ed a layer of wate r containing soa p enough to gi ve durabili ty to the bubbles when f ormed on it s s ur -"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Pag e 6 P r o fess or W.

Placing this on the table near the ri ng appa r atus ( fig. 1) previous ly c har ge d with very opaque air, I attac h to the tubulated aperture of the j a r a flexible pipe terminating in a glass tube of about one-tenth i nc h in di a meter. Dipping t he end of the tube into the soa py wa ter so that it may take up a s hor t column of the l iq- uid, I hold it centr a ll y over the w ater and clos e t o the surface. Then br ea t hing carefully into the mouthpiece, pr ovided for this purpose with a na r row opening, I for m a f loating bubble of any siz e f rom a half inch to t hree inc hes in diameter. This being done the gla ss be ak is to be gently lif te d awa y, and t he bowl covered with a glas s pl a te, br ought over it with a s l iding motion. The bubble mus t now be left undis t urbed f or fift e en or twenty sec onds, to allow it s c ont e nt s a nd the air of t he bowl to c om e to r e st, at which time the suspe nded c loud will be s een to have s ubsided a littl e fr om the a pex, showing a le vel s ur face above. As it is ne cess ary for a sa ti s factor y obse r va t ion that the ruptur e of the bubble should begin ex- actly at the t op and extend s ymm e tr ically ar ound that point, and as in the s pontaneous bursting this only occas ionally occ ur s , i t is e xpedient not to wait for the rupture but to f orce it by mea ns of a wir e inse r ted verti c ally through the apex a nd quickly wit hdrawn, the glass c over having first been r e m ove d by a gentle sliding motion. When this ha s be en done so as to avoid a gi ta t ion we se e a cloudy c ol umn rising some inches a bove t he liquid, a nd rolling ove r in delicate volutes at the t op. With a bubble of from one to one and a half inches in diameter the symmetry of the resulting column is quite striking and its cor res pondence in motion and shape w i th that alre ady descr ibed as an ear ly s tage of the r ing formation is not to be mistaken. I n many c ases a perf e ct and almost se par a te ring is developed a t the top, and w hen the a ir is not too opaque the alter na te coils and the resulting horizontal bands are perf e ctly distinct. But fr om the feeble ness of the r otation thes e appea r anc es are only mom e ntar y. When the bubble is two or three inches i n diamete r , t he out- ward and downw ar d curling at the top of the cloudy mass is s till quite observable, a l though much les s marked than in the preceding c ase . W hen very s mall bubbles a r e br oke n, the mot ion i s too quick and the cloud too small f or s atisfactory obs ervation. (8. ) Origin of the rotation. - It thus appears that in the mechanic al r upture of a floating bubble for ce s are brought into play s imi lar in kind a nd general dir e ction to those ope r a t ing on t he r ing- disc har ge s f rom an ori fice. Of thes e, one is evidently the tensional action of the liquid film drivi ng t he cloudy air through the opening, another is the res istance of the adjoi ning ai r into which t he mas s is impelled. The f ormer corr e sponds in effect to the tens ion propagated through the rese r voir in the previous experi me nt s , the latter is the s ame in both case s; and we may con- side r the w i de ning apertur e of the bubbl e thr ough whic h the air is thus as it we r e squeez ed, a s ans weri ng to the orif ice on the top of t he jar. Thi s view of the mode of a ction of the fi lm is confir med by the very curious effect which r e- sults whe n the bubble is punctured on one side. T hus a pplyi ng the poi nt of the wir e near t he bas e we s ee the cloudy column rushing out in a nearly horizontal direction on that side. If we pierce the bubble at an i nte r mediate height t he air is projected obliquely upwa r d toward the hand. I t can hardly be doubted therefor e that in all case s the bubble is des t r oyed by a progr ess ive and re gular enlar gement of the opening fir st made, and that this takes place w i th sufficient slow ness to allow the apertur e to give dir ection to the e xtending for ce. (9. ) R ings gene rated from s pherical bubbles . - T he effects jus t de scribed are pr oduce d in a still more striking degree by the rupt ure of the bubbles of c om ple t e ly spherical form. I n this as in the for mer experiments the utmos t care must be taken to protect the adjac ent air from agitati on. With this view t he bubble as soon as blown should be de posited at the bottom of the glass bowl on a piece of s of t cloth or a flake of ca r de d cotton, a nd le f t undisturbed f or ten or fif teen s econds . On piercing i t at the top with a ver y s lender w i re we s ee its contents suddenly pr ojected up war ds som e inches, for ming a cloudy column whose summit r olling over on all s ides de velops a beau- tifull y dis t inct ring which at times a scends s o rapidly a s t o se par a te from the ge neral train. The effect is best seen with a bubble of fr om three-four ths to one i nc h in diameter. Whe n the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Pag e 7 P r o fess or W. B. Rogers on Rota ting Rin gs of Air and L iqu ids contiguous air is perf ec tl y qui e scent the r ing retains i ts for m even a bove the top of the bowl, af fording a clear though momentary view of its twofold spiral and the re- sulting hor izontal bands, as we l l as of the direction of i ts rotation. When pierced at the s ide ins tead of the apex, the bubble, a s might be expected, pr ojects it s contents to- wards t ha t side in t he dir e ction of t he wire, s howing though less perf ec t ly the s ame configur ation. B oth ef fects are r udely indicated i n fi g. 5. As thes e experi me nt s on the r upture of bubbles will be found to have much inter e st, I m a y s uggest that they c an be eas il y repeated by f orming the bubbles with tobacco- smoke blown from the s t e m of a c omm on pipe, f rom which they ar e readily tr ans fer red to the s oapy w ater as sphe r ica l s egments or to t he c lot h s ur face as entire sphe r es . But it must be r e m e mber e d that even a slight motion of the contiguous air will de f ea t the observation. I nee d sc arcely add that the tens i ona l action of curved fil ms of liquid, s o strikingly show n in these phenomena, has be en illus t rated by Pr of. J oseph Henry i n a s er ies of interesting experiments of which an ac- count was published some years ago. In the pres ent ca se t he most im portant inference to be drawn f rom the r e sults is that the de- struction of the bubbles proce eds not fr om a subversion of cohes ion irregular ly thr oughout the fil m, but from a uniform ly pr ogres sive e nlar ge m e nt of the opening f irst formed, by the c ont inu- ous retr a ction of its edge. (10. ) Of the rings pr oduced by float ing bubbles of phosphur etted hy drogen gas, when ex- ploded.- I n what has jus t been s tated w e mark the eff ec t s s im ply of the mecha nical ruptur e of the bubble, ca l ling int o play as a m otive agent the tens ile force of the film, or what is equivalent, the expans ive action of it s c ontents r e l e ase d fr om the pr e ssure under whic h they have been held. But in the pres ent ca se the r upture ha s no sooner begun t ha n a c hemi c al action of great i nte nsity se ts in betwe en the i n cluded gas and the air. Thi s commenc ing usua l ly at the apex and extending downwards and laterally in a sy mmetrical m anner give s rise to a powerf ul e xpansive force hav- ing an obli que ly upwa r d direction on a l l s i de s. The pr oduc t s of the combus t ion are thus impelled into t he c onti guous and comparatively quies cent air unde r conditions very analogous to those of an e ner ge ti c momentary discharge f rom the ring apparatus of the for mer expe r iments . T he r e- sis tance at the sides of the asce nding and spreading c ol umn, combining wit h the upwa r d im pul- sion of the interior will, t he r efore, give rise to a similar rotation of the cloudy mass , rolli ng it up into the spirally c onstructed ring in which it pr e sents itself at the close of the explosive action. It will be remarked that these explosive r ings are more rapid in their expa nsion as well a s their rotation than the rings produced by mec hanical di s charge, a result due doubt le ss to t he greater energy of the f orces by which t he y are developed. A s m ight be expected, rings of the latter kind approaches mor e nearly to t he f ormer in these pa r ticulars when a vigorous impulse i s applied in producing them. In most cas es the wreath of phosphoric acid is so opaque as to preclude the examination of its interior structure, but when m ore diluted, we are able to trace within it , as in t he other r ings , the two-f old coil of c l oudy and clear atmos pher e . In experim e nti ng w i th the e xplosive bubbles every one must have notice d the f requent oc cur - rence of ir regularities and f ailures in the production of the ring. This is a natural c onsequenc e of the r upture beginning on t he s ide or a t more than one spot, inste ad of c om me ncing at the a pex of the film and accordingly in s uch c ase s it wil l be remarked tha t the flame a nd s m oke dart out lat- erally, pr oduc ing a br oke n and almost f ormless wreath."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Pag e 8 P r o fess or W.

Yet so f a r as I am aware no a t te m pt ha s hitherto been made to determine, the structur e and movement of these rings, or the precis e conditions under which the y are generated.

Operating w i th these precautions , and view i ng the r es ult from a point a lit tle lower than the level of the f luid, we see that the drop, soon after merging in the liquid, gives origin to a ring of exquis i te symmetry, which rotates and enla r ges as it des cends , pr ec isely a f ter the manner of the gas - rings already described.

B. Rogers on Rota ting Rin gs of Air and L iqu ids 12. Motions and str ucture of the liquid rings . - T he rotation of the liquid r ing on its c i rcular axis is directed upwards on the outer circumf erence a nd downwa r ds on the inner; or viewed in relation to the pr ogres sion of the mass , it prese nt s an advanc ing m ove ment of the inner and a r e- treating movement of the e xt e r ior peripher y. I t is t hus identical with the rot a ti on of a gas - ring impelled in a desce ndi ng direction. The liquid ring, mor e over , res embles that of ga s i n being composed of a coil of colored f luid enfolding a parallel uncolored coil. Indeed, when s uf ficiently tr a nslucent, it exhibits quite dis- tinctly the horizontal bands which, in the c ase of r ings of cloudy air, ha ve been shown a bove to be a n optical result of this t w of old s tr ucture. The correspondenc e betwee n the phenomena is rendered s till more c ompl e te by the f a ct, that the liquid ring is followed by a residua l y colored mas s, which, when the f orming impulse is f e eble, remains attached to it a s a train. 13. Formation of liquid r ings by impulsive dischar ge. - T he observed ide nt ity of motions and structure in the two class es of ri ngs led me to attempt t he pr oduction of li quid rings by a me- chanica l proces s similar to that used in f orming the rings of air. For this purpose I lowered the beak of the pipette so a s to im me r s e it a litt le below the surface of l iquid i n the res er voir, and clos i ng the s t opc ock applied a sudden and transient press ur e of the f ingers to the fl e xibl e tube . The experi me nt wa s eminently succe ss f ul. The colored l iquid thus dis charged was s een to shoot downwards in the f orm of a very perf e ct ring, in all r e spects res embling thos e above des cr ibe d, exce pt that its rotation and expansion were more r a pi d. Modifyi ng the arrangement by attaching to the s t op-cock a small but thick gum-elas t ic bag, I have found it eas y to regulate the impulse so as t o de velop t he r ings a s slowly as may be des i red, and thus to repr oduc e with the c olor ed liquid all the stages of the phenomena previously mar ke d in the c ase of r ings of air. In this w ay, by a gentle and rather gradual f orce, I can caus e the es caping fl uid to rise up intolateral volutes, or, increas i ng the action, to for m the opening ring with its att a ched train; or, by a ye t quicker and stronger impulsion, I can c ompel the ring to s hoot rapidl y away, leaving the tr a i n either to break up irr e gul a r ly or to form by its own m otion, a s econd s maller r ing, as in the cas e of disc harges of air. The rings thus for me d in the m ids t of the liquid will, of course differ in size, according to the amount of liquid expelled a t each impuls e. As, however, thi s is never so s mall as a drop, and the velocity of the action is comparatively great, t he rings thus for med are always larger than thos e resulting f rom the dr opping process . They ar e , theref ore, better s uit e d for observations on the internal motions and duplica t e structure of the liquid ring. It is ess ential in such observations , however the ring may be f ormed, to m a ke us e of a par tially tr ans parent liquid, suc h as a dilute solution of s ulphate of indigo, or a thi n mixt ure of cobalt blue, and to view the r ing by a moder - ately strong light. I n the se cir c umstances t he double spire and the horizontal ba nds become beautifully apparent. 14. Or igi n of the liquid r ing, and of its r otation. - C onsidering the e nt ire a gr e ement in s tr uc- ture and motions of the liquid ring as c ompar e d with the mechanica ll y f ormed ring of a ir , it is natural t o conc l ude that s i milar conditions of for c e a r e conc er ne d in their production. Such is evidently the fact with r ings generated by the process last des cribed, that is, when the orif ice is at or below the leve l of the res ervoir . Here, the impulse of disc har ge acting downward and la t e r al- ly, and the res istance of t he apertur e and of the conti guous medium ac ti ng backwards, prese nt a combination of f orces precis ely s uch as, a ccording to t he previous explanation, ope r ates in the production of the ri ngs of air . In regard to the for mation of rings by t he dropping pr oce ss , the me chanical conditions, al- though a ppar e ntl y diff erent, are such as I think would naturally give rise to the same combination of mot ions . In cons i de r ing the mode of action of the dr op it is pr oper to distinguish be t w een the cas e of a dr op which impinges upon the sur f ac e of the medium with a se nsible velocity and that of one simply laid upon it fr om the be ak of the droppi ng tube.
