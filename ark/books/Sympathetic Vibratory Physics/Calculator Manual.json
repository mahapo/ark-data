There are at least two accepted methods of counting musical intervals.Counting notes and count- ing steps between the notes. I have found both methods to be confusing. In an effort to rid myself of this confusion I created the following Musical Interval Calcula- tors.Using these calculators eliminates all the confusion of counting because counting has been eliminated.Simply point the pointer to the note being counted from and read off the interval be- tween that note and whatever note desired. Later I will be adding calculator centers for calculating in more than one octave and quite possi- bly another to calculate the more obscure intervals. To use these calculators simply print out the Colored Note Ring preferrably onto card stock. Next print out each of the Center Calculators, also on card stock. Cut out the two center calcula- tors. Pin the center of the Center Calculator through the center of the Colored Note Ring and it is ready to go.Switching calculators is a simple matter depending on what you wish to calculate. Enjoy! Have fun!

Happy intervaling! A Bit on Intervals “The distance between any two sounds. In dis- cussing all subjects relating to melody, or to the construction of chords, it is necessary to find names for the various kinds of intervals. Hence, in the earliest treatises on music they are divided into classes. The old axiom that consonance depends on simplicity of ratio nat- urally led authors to draw a line at the point at which two sounds ceased to be consonant and became dissonant. Among the Greeks, the uni- son, octave, fifth and fourth were considered more perfect than the third and sixth and other intervals. In medieval treatises an interesting division of intervals into perfect, medium, and imperfect is found; the unison and octave be- longed to the first class, the fourth and fifth to the second, the third and sixth to the last. In later works appeared a division which is to this day followed by many writers, namely, into Perfect and Imperfect. So far, this division seems plain enough. But modern music requires that intervals shall be designated according to their scale value. Hence a perfect interval when accidentally flattened becomes imperfect and a major inter- val becomes minor. But the application of the word imperfect to a perfect interval made smaller led to serious confusion, because, an imperfect fifth came as a subdivision of per- fect intervals, while imperfect intervals of themselves formed a separate class. To avoid this cross-division, theorists have in the last few years used the name diminished for per- fect fifths reduced by one semitone. But it is important to note that by this change of a name a new difficulty arises, for diminished has almost by universal consent been applied to certain intervals when made less than mi- nor, for example, C# to Bf is a diminished seventh, C# to B# a major seventh, C# to Bn a minor seventh, C# to Bf one semitone less than minor. The word diminished when ap- plied by these authors to a fourth or fifth signi- fies that it is reduced from its normal state by one semitone, but the same word \"diminished\" when applied to a seventh signifies that it is reduced by two semitones. That utter confu- sion should result from such an undigested system is absolutely inevitable; and it will be found that professors and teachers of music to this day are unable to talk intelligibly to each other on the simple subject of Intervals . For many years a system has been taught in Ger- many which makes the whole matter perfectly plain. It is this: How to Use the Musical Interval Calculator"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"1) Intervals are reckoned upwards, inclusively, and by the number of notes they contain. 2) Intervals are in their normal state when reckoned from the first note of the major scale. The lowest note of the interval being considered for the time as a tonic. 3) Normal intervals are major. Thus, D to F# is a major third, because F# is the third degree of the scale of D; F to Bf is a major fourth, be- cause Bf is the fourth of the scale of F; B to F# is a major fifth, because F# is the fifth of the scale of B; and so on. In other words, all the intervals of any major scale reckoning up from the tonic respectively are major. 4) Intervals one semitone less than major are minor. Thus, C to Df is a minor second be- cause it is one semitone less than the normal D in the scale of C; B to Fn is a minor fifth be- cause one semitone less than the normal F# in the scale of B; and so on. 5) Intervals one semitone greater than major are augmented. Thus, C to D# is an aumented second, because it is one semitone greater than C to D, the normal interval; C to G# an aug- mented fifth; and so on. 6) Intervals one semitone less than minor are diminished. Thus, F# to Ef is a diminished seventh; C# to Gf, a diminished fifth; C# to Ef, a diminished third; and so on. The simplicity of this system is already appar- ent. The following shows it at a glance: Tonic C Major 2nd D Major 3rd E Major 4th F Major 5th G Major 6th A Major 7th B Major 8th C Tonic C Minor 2nd Df Minor 3rd Ef Minor 4th Ff Minor 5th Gf Minor 6th Af Minor 7th Bf Minor 8th Cf Tonic C Augmented 2d D# Augmented 3rd E# Augmented 4th F# Augmented 5th G# Augmented 6th A# Augmented 7th B# Augmented 8th C# Tonic C or C# Diminished 2nd Dff Df Diminished 3rd Eff Ef Diminished 4th Fff Ff Diminished 5th Gff Gf Diminished 6th Aff Af Diminished 7th Bff Bf Diminished 8th Cff Cf It will be seen from this that diminished inter- vals are produced in two ways - either by making the upper note of a minor interval flat- ter, or by making the lower note of some inter- val sharper. Hence it is that some intervals have to be calculated from notes not having a diatonic scale of their own; thus, B# to An. In such cases, the nature of the interval is readily found by temporarily reducing the lower note; thus, Bn to An is a minor seventh, therefore B# to An, being a semitone less than minor, must be a diminished seventh. The following is the simplest form of stating the rule for naming intervals according to this system: \"When asked the nature of any interval, bear in mind the major scale of the lower note, then, if the upper note is higher by a semitone than it would be in the major scale of the low- er note, it is augmented; if the upper note is actually a note of that major scale it is major; if it is less than major by one semitone it is minor; if it is less than minor by one semitone it is diminihed. When the lower note is a sharpened note, which has no scale of its own, consider it as one semitone lower, e.g., C## to G# is a minor fifth, because the interval is one semitone less than C# to G#, the normal fifth."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"When the lower note is a flattened note, which has no scale of its own, consider it as tempo- rarily raised before determining the nature of the interval, thus Cff to Gf is an augmented fifth, because it is one semitone greater than the normal fifth Cf to Gf.\" The only obstacle to the general adoption of this excellent method of tabulating intervals is to be fund in the pertinacity with which pro- fessors adhere to the expression perfect fifth and perfect fourth, and abhor the term major fifth and major fourth. This absurd prejudice, which arguments drawn from the history and science of music seem to have no power to re- move, must be allowed to die of old age. If there is any real distinction between the per- fection of a fifth and the imperfection of a third, it might even then be allowed to stu- dents to call fourths and fifths majors, on the understanding that they also possessed a re- marable perfection which no other intervals possess. It has been suggested that intervals should be called, instead of (1) minor, (2) major, and (3) augmented; (1) minor, (2) normal, and (3) ma- jor. This would certainly be a better system than any yet devised; but it is to be feared that it would be impossible to disturb the univer- sally accepted meaning of the word major. Intervals greater than major or normal have been termed (besides augmented) extreme, sharp, superfluous, pluperfect, etc.” A Diction- ary of Musical Terms , Novello, Ewer and Co., London, pre-1900 An interval is a combination of two tones. It is also the distance between or the difference be- tween two tones. When these two tones are sounded together the result is an harmonic in- terval, and when they are sounded one after the other the result is a melodic interval. The quality of an interval is determined by its size and by the relationship of its position to the keynote. There are five types of intervals: major (in- dicated by M), minor (m), perfect (P), dimin- ished (dim.), and augmented (Aug.). A major interval contracted - by lowering the upper note or raising the lower note - by one half step becomes minor, and contracted by another half step becomes diminished. A perfect interval contracted by a half step becomes diminished, and contracted by an- other half step (not usually practical), becomes doubly diminished. A perfect or a major interval expanded by a half step becomes augmented.” Basic Princi- ples of Music , Joseph Brye"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"INTERVAL RATIO Unison 1:1 Pythagorean Komma 81:80 Enharmonic 128:125 Lesser Chromatic Semitone 25:24 Diesis 25:24 Greater Chromatic Semitone 135:128 Minor Diatonic Semitone 17:16 Major Diatonic Semitone 16:15 Limma 16:15 Minor Second 27:25 Smaller Step or Minor Tone 10:9 Greater Step or Major Tone 9:8 Major Second 9:8 Augmented Second 75:64 Minor Third 6:5 Major Third 5:4 Diminished Fourth 32:25 Augmented Third 125:96 Perfect Fourth 4:3 Augmented Fourth 25:18 Tritone 45:32 Diminished Fifth 64:45 Diminished Fifth 36:25 Perfect Fifth 3:2 Augmented Fifth 25:16 Minor Sixth 8:5 Major Sixth 5:3 Augmented Sixth 125:72 Harmonic Seventh 7:4 Dominant or Minor Seventh 16:9 Minor Seventh 9:5 Tonic Seventh 9:5 Major Seventh 15:8 Diminished Octave 48:25 Augmented Seventh 125:64 Octave 2:1 Minor Ninth 32:15 Major Ninth 9:4 Harmonic Minor Tenth 7:31 Minor Tenth 12:5 Major Tenth 5:2 Perfect Eleventh 8:3 Harmonic Eleventh 11:4 Augmented Eleventh 45:16 Perfect Twelfth 3:1 Augmented Twelfth 25:8 Minor Thirteenth 16:5 Harmonic Thirteenth 13:4 Major Thirteenth 10:3 Harmonic Fourteenth 7:2 Dominant Fourteenth 32:9 Tonic Fourteenth 18:5 Major Fourteenth 15:4 Double Octave 4:1 Musical Intervals This list contains all the intervals I’ve found in many old music theory books that had nu- meric values. There is much license in interval definition. Some authorities give the intervals as so many semitones and tones without an accurate defi- nition as to the relative frequency of either. In this publication we will try to stick with the numerically defined ratios thereby diminish- ing ambiguities. The Greek mode intervals have not been in- cluded though I may create a calculator for them at a later date. ----- If you learn music, you learn history. If you learn music, you'll learn mathematics.
