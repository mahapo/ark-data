is diseas e.” Kee ly , ci rca 1885 Li fe and a ll of its ac ti vities and conditions are a direct r e sult of the two s tates of being and activi- ty: har mony and discor d . T he r e is a little- know n thir d s tate - mi dw ay between thes e two extremes - that contains ele m e nts of them both and is called the N eutr al or Dominant. Life is a vibrato- ry or cyclical expe r ience w hi c h is t he ma ni fes ta- tion of these thr e e s t a tes. Perhaps it could be said this way: “ Har mony (in body , mind and spirit vibrations) is health - di s - cord (in body , mind and s pir it vibrations) is di s - eas e.” Before one can properly inter pret the sim- ple li ttle phrase above it is imperative t o understand the t e r ms given. He al th means what? That all the parts a nd f unc t ions of the human or- ganis m ar e in perfect Har mony . T he r es t is sim- ple - dis ease then is the oppos ite sta t e , i. e., di s - cord or di s cordance between the par ts a nd functions of the body . O nce we unde r s tand the inner s tr ucture and intelligenc e that is Harmony then we can go about planning and exe cuting that which is es sential to c r ea t ing and maintain- ing conc or danc e in one’ s body , mind a nd L ife. \" H a r mon ize thy lif e as y e do the tone s of na ture it sel f; a nd more joy and bea uty wi ll be i n t hy dai- ly ex peri enc e. \" Ca yc e (262- 121) But what is har mony? Ha r mony can best be de- fined in a t e chnical manne r a s: “HAR MONY i s the simul tan eous v ib r at ion of tw o or mo r e bodi es whose h armonic s d o not pro- duc e disco r d s , and whose fund ament al pit che s are harmoni cs of t he low est pi tc h, or are a unison wi th th e resul tant note s or o ve r t one s , or unde r - to nes, o f any t wo or more of t hem. ” Kee ly , 189 4 Thus e ach i ndividualize d thing ha s its own set of vibrations more or less in tune w i th and betwee n themse lves. For s omething to be hea lt hy it mus t be in tune or harmony . Ther e f ore to heal s ome- thing not in tune or s ick there m us t be added or brought to bear on thes e out-of- tune vi brations that which will harm oniz e them. Ther e are three wa ys of improvi ng har mony . 1) Add or empha size the existing harmony; 2) de- creas e or de-emphas ize the di s cords or e li minate the cause of dis cords; 3) all of t he above . T he three nobl e metals composing t he Divine T ripl e t - gold, silver and platinum - poss es s c har a cteri s - tics that w hen properly applied will contribute, in a significant wa y , to t he re-establishme nt of harmony within t he vibr ations of the huma n body thereby r e establis hi ng the Grand Harmoni- um we call health. A T r i pl e St udy o f T r i pl et s So our work her e will be of a three-f old nature. W e wil l delve into the 1) physic al pr ope r ties of the three metals of interest being silver , gold a nd platinum; t he n we will endeavor to explor e the 2) inner “subs tances ” or ess ences of these metals being their vibrator y inner natur es – their r eal re- alities; and 3) we will lea r n what thes e vi brations are and how they interact. Be gi nning t he n with the mos t r e cognized form of these metals, their physical substa nce, we ca n get an idea a bout each of them as a “thi ng” . From their “ thi ngne ss ” we will be gi n to s ee and r e cog- nize s ome of their higher attr ibutes derived as a result of their inner vibratory s tr uctures and mo- tions.

The truth is t he metal has a plethor a of vibrations, all of which are important, and a r e all in tune with a harmonic or partial of its funda- mental or keynote vibr a t ion. The keynote is the tone ( fundamental t o the c hor d or sc ale) in whic h a tune is written and played. All notes to the chord or s cale are a har monic (arit hme t ic multi- ple) of thi s ke ynote. T he circle of keys and notes on this page show all the mus ical keys a nd their respec ti ve notes . The keynotes of e ach key a r e the hollowed notes w i thin each mea sure.

The full scale of chr oma t ic notes as played on the piano are give n on page 6. Another f ac t or is that of the keynote. Each of thes e e l e ments has an audible or discernible key- note tone which is a r e sult of the higher t one s or vibrations of the e l e mentar y part ic l e s making up the element. T his proces s of a high f requenc y cas cading down to lower frequencies is s ynony- mous w i th t he demodulation ideas of radio s ci- ence . Also i t bears mention here that the One Substanc e or O ne Force of the unive r s e is undif- fer e nti a ted and i s gene r ally r eferred to as W hi te Li ght. This White Li ght or har monica ll y bal- ance d range of fr eque ncies is de- modulated when it strikes a lowe r fr e quency usua l ly from a molecular or atom a nd ca n then be seen as colors in a rainbow . The single tone of the U ndi f feren- tiated Li ght is r efracted into a plethora of c ol ors or tones of color jus t as a ke ynot e or f undame nt a l of mus ic is r e f racted into notes of a s cale . T his sa me pr inciple holds t rue for a tom s , molecule s, the human body or w hatever . The keynote sets the tone ( as in the Domi na nt - which is another musica l te r m for the ke ynote) a nd all othe r s eg- ments or c om pone nt s of the whole fall i nto ste p or are r eje cted or e j e cted by reason of its discor- dant tones. Dis cordance means having pitches not harmonic to the chor d of the whole or mas s. These discor ds will for m beat fr equencies which are cons ider e d extr e m e ly har s h and des tr uc t ive to the integrity of the whole .

When tones are de veloped that a r e not harmonic but form disc or ds wit h the keynote or f unda mental t he r e develops a di f ferent clas s of scale or series of tones . Thes e would be considered e nharm onic and a nathema to harmony or concordance of tone. T he r e can exis t states that are not fully har - monic or ful ly enharmonic.

Although these laws dis covered and develope d by Keely in the late 1800s are a bit cr yptic a nd dif f icult to gras p they are es sential for t he ideas and conce pt s that f ollow . If it is true t he huma n body is a collection of pa r ticles which are ulti- mately c entr a l iz ed vibrations i t is imperative to understand the na t ure of vibr a t ion in all its forms .

Gold is a meta l . T he body uses traces of elements throughout i ts sys tems for proper functioning. Thr oughout the body ar e f ound t he se a nd other metals in micr os copic trace amounts. Gold is a n element much l ike magnes ium or the other trace elements and as suc h is r e quir ed by the body for it t o be a more complete and f unctioning whole. It is known and accepted that magnes ium, for in- sta nce, works w i thin the electrol yte use d by the nervous s ystem for a more proper and whole functioning of that s ystem. Gold is not much dif- fer e nt. J ust as certain metals have certain proper- ties tha t no othe r metal has so too doe s the gold, silver and plati num m e tals. T he y each pe r form certain and spec i fic functions within the body . The f ollowing quote mentioning how the vibra- tions of the gold ar e t o act upon the ner ve impuls - es [so] as to be a cr e at iv e for c e . One of the prop- erties of gold we a r e c om ing to recognize is its ability to ampli fy , encourage, s ti mulate or eve n ener gize a par ticular ki nd and r ange of vibra- tions. No ot he r element or mol e cular c ompound has this qua l ity . \" T he vi brati ons (vi a We t Ce ll) f rom the G o ld So- lu tio n are to ac t u pon t he ne r v e impul se as to be as a c r e ati ve forc e or to bec ome ac ti vat iv e as an in flu enc e t o the gla ndul ar sy stem t hrough t he a s - simi lat ing bod y. \" Cay ce (1853) The above quote mentions the “W e t Cell” de- vice 6 . This is a s m a ll contrivance whos e dir e c- tions f or cons tr uc t ion and us e were also give n through Cayce . The function and purpose of this device was to impar t the hi gh vibr at ions of gold or s i lver t o the human body . It wa s held by the readings that the c er e br o-spinal sys t e m and the sympa t he ti c ner ve sys t e ms (endocrine glandu- lar sys tem) of the body are, w hen healthy , coor - dinated together in their f unc t ions . The gold a nd silver bring a bout a har moniza ti on or coordina- tion between these two sys tems and other s ub- sys tems. The body may be seve r e l y “out of wack” in either the mental, emotional or physi- cal a spects without pr ope r coordination of these sys tems. T his i s not unlike an orches tr a whe r e the horn s ection i s out of t une with the string se c- tion or the i r timing may be of f . E ve n t hough the sa me music is before ea ch they a r e each pl a ying to a dif ferent conductor and the r e sultant “mu- sic ” is not mus i c but noise. T he vibr ations of the gold and other noble metals allows the DNA a nd RNA to get their ac t together . B ut also the gross functions of these sys tems can begin to “hear the music” and get the c lear instructions fr om the conductor ( on high) and the music begins to har- monize onc e more and he alth results. A fine e xample of how thi s i s , how this takes place a nd what a corr e cting pr oce dur e may be ; we br ing i n this quote f rom the Cayc e readings which des cribes jus t thi s situation.

Hydrog- enation is exothermic and pr oc eeds at a negligi- ble rate in the abse nce of a catalysts , eve n at ele- vated temperatur e s. The unca talyzed rea ction must ha ve, therefore, a ver y l a r ge ener gy of acti- vation. T he function of the catalyst is to lower the ener gy of ac t iva t ion so that the r e action ca n proceed rapidly a t room temperatur e. T he c ata- lyst does not, of course , af fect t he ne t e ner gy change of the over a l l reaction; it s impl y lowers the ener gy hi ll betwee n the reactants a nd prod- ucts . A ca t a lyst lowers the ener gy of a ctivation by perm itting the reac ti on to take place in a dif- fer e nt way , that is, by a dif ferent mec hanism. In this cas e, the reactants a r e abs orbed on the enor- mous s ur face a r ea of the fi ne ly divided metal (as in a c oll oid), where reaction actually occurs. Lower ing the ener gy hill de cr e ases the e ner gy of activation of t he r eve r s e r e action as we ll and thus i nc r e ases the rate of de hydr oge nati on . 1 7 Pr imary alcohols in the pr es ence of oxygen and a noble metal catalyst can be converted to alde- hydes or acids a nd sec ondar y alcohols af ford ke- tones . 17 Fur thermore it is jus t as s i mple to pre- pare artif ic i a l alkanes and then c onver t the m to alkenes or alkene s back into a lkanes or convert unsa tur ated esters into saturated ester . 1 6 Ca t a lyt ic oxidation of carbohydrates over plati- num metals has proven to be a very powerf ul tool for controlled tr a nsfor mations of thes e subs t a nc- es .

A sc alar wave be i ng in for m of a “phas e conjugate wave” does exactly wha t a boson i s theorized to do a nd is the very s ame phenomenon as des cribed by Huds on 2 7 whe n speaking of t his action. The tr ue nature of a sca l a r wave is that of multiple fre- quencies pr e cisely combined together . There- for e a s calar wave i s actually a chord of v i br a- tion frequencies .

Ther e i s another theor y how a ction at a distance happens . This i s a pos tulate developed by this author over many years. Given the charts on pag- es 6- 8 it can be s een that the fas t e r an e l e mentar y particle s pins t he sma l le r i t gets and the higher becomes its frequencies and ener gies . It is w ell es tablished that the dens er the media of pr opa ga- tion of a vibration t he higher t he velocity of trav- el. T he r efore given tha t ther e exists a media much de nser than steel having perhaps an infi- nite density ther e f ore demonstrating a trans mi s - sion velocity of vibrations als o infini te . Also a s a vibration ocurr s on the molecula r leve l it creates its higher a nd highe r harmonics and partials un- til they too a r e i nfinitely high in vibration rate, dens it y and fr e quency with infinite pr opa gation rates becaus e these r a tes ac t and react s ympa- thetically within their ow n r ea lm of fr e quencies -whatever they a r e. So (th e CA USE of) what happens below (mo- lecularly ) h appe n s (cr eates EF FEC T S) above (in ter -eth e rically) and vice vers a and anything sy mpat hetically attun e d will experie n c e or r e- flect (be af fected by) the same thing or energy . Going to these higher and higher realms is the vacuum or so-called zero point e ner gy s t a te. T he ener gy content of a vacuum is near infini te as is well r ec ogni z ed by quantum phys ics. The va cu- um i s not empty . It is, however , empty of mol e c- ular and atom ic matter but it is f ull of e l e mentar y particles. Thes e s m a ll e r , dens er particles ( tha n atoms or molecules ) pos se ss m uc h higher fre- quencies and gr e ater e ner gy s tates . So whe n i t is sa id that tapping the zero point or vac uum state one can achieve over -unit y ene r gy it is a n illu- sion. becaus e the tapped ener gy is originating fr om these tiny but powe r ful pa r ticle state s.

Thi s property of attr ac t ion is r e vealed in the f ollowing quot e : Law of A ttr ac tio n - “J uxta pose d coh ere nt aggr eg ate s vibr atin g in u nison, or har mo nic ra tio, ar e mut ually at - Vibr at ing stri ng showi ng the funda me nt al wa ve- le ngt h at the top ; th e oc ta ve or twic e t he wa ve num be r in t he mi ddle and a t hird or thr ee tim e s t he wav e num ber at t he bo tto m."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"46 Th e Divine T r ipl e t tr ac ted ”. (Ke ely , p re 1894) As this law indicates a c hange of polarit y is not a c om ple t e cha nge of state. P ola r ity i s but a portion of the over a ll functional matrix of components that m a ke up the totality of the whole dynamic vibrating s tr uc t ure. S inc e all that the r e is i s vibration the sc enari o to look to for more understanding is that of vibration. Not a s ingl e vibration but the whole plethor a of harmonious tones , di s cordant noise s and their relationship one to another. A cha nge in f requenc y is als o r e qui red and als o a relationship of pitches mus t be es tab- lished as well. It is not dif ficult to imagine the es sence we ar e after to explain a ggr e gation and s eparation can be found in t he chor ds of vibration unde r disc ussion. Certain chor ds will caus e aggrega t ion and certain other chords will caus e the oppos it e - s eparation. The key to unr ave li ng this s t a te of aff airs is the “degree of relativity” of tones ; i. e. , fr e quencies of the component e l e mentar y part ic l e s or thos e tones combining together t o create a chord w hether in har mony or dis cord with each other. Whe n in ha r mony ther e are f ew bea t fr eque ncies or beat tones formed. Beat tones ar e exce edingly disc or dant and pr eve nt a harmoni z ation of the tones of the chord. So i f we want a harmoni- ous chor d tha t wil l tend t o pul l things together we will gather those t one s that give rise to lit- tle if any bea t s . \" D i ff eren tia ti on of mass, p r o duce s nega tiza- ti on to c oi nci dent act ion .

Be at tones are s ometi me s referr e d to as “Dif- fer e nce Tones” me aning they are the dif fer- ence in frequency or that which is l e f t over fr om combining two tones. L et’s s ay we wis h to combine a tone of 400 c ycles per sec ond with a tone that has 420 c ycles pe r s econd. The two will sync hr onize very we l l as their wave le ngt h is espe cially t he same. However, there is a differenc e of 20 cycles per s econd. Thi s little diff e r enc e will make itself hea r d pe- riodi c ally and the actual chord being sounde d by the two tones will “wail” in and out of har- mony. I f you’ve ever flown in a twin engine light air plane you know w ell w hat t his dynam- ic s ounds like as the pi lot attempts to keep the two engines r unning at precis ely the same spe ed. Diff erentiation mentioned above i s pretty much the sa m e as re fraction . Refraction is what happens to “white light” as it a r rives fr om the Sun and s pli ts a par t into the ma ny colors of the rainbow. The single coinc i de nt flow of vibr a ti ons fr om the Sun bec om e mod- ulated by impacting the m olec ules and atoms in the atmosphere and then ‘ break’ into a spe c- trum of disc r ete frequency rates which we per- ceive as the indi vidual color s . Thes e may eve n be li ke ned to “beat” tones or beat fr eque ncies. \" H e re, le t's an aly ze he ali ng f or the mome nt, to th ose that mu s t c onsc iously - a s th is bo dy - s e e and reason, se e a mat eria l d emonst r a tio n, oc- c as i onal ly at lea s t !

When discord ex- ists within t he vibration matrix (signa t ure or chord) of a ma ss i t will dis sociate through mu- tual repuls i on between the ce nt e r s of vibra- tions. More and more the importance of the duality know n as harmony a nd dis cor d is com- ing c l e ar. T hes e a r e the t w o major motivative for ce s worki ng throughout the mater i al uni- verse. Modern sc ience recognizes t his duality as “procr e ation” and often aff irms that the stronges t motivation of s pecies is that of s elf preservation (survival) or the s ex drive. He r e again we s ee a failing of modern s cience. For the a bove affir mation t o exist it must be predi- cated on the attractive qualities and conditions of individualities. B ut before t he attractions and resultant actions ca n exis t there must fir s t be individualit y or the res ult a nt of t he forces of r e pul s ion. In other words, as important as attraction and se x is it can have no value with- out its oppos it e state or condition - that of sin- glenes s or individuality. Theref ore the l a w of repulsion is equally impor tant in the gr a nd sc heme of t hings . Law of Rep ulsion - “ Juxt apo sed c ohe re nt aggr eg ate s vibr atin g in disc or d ar e mut uall y re pe lled . ” (Ke ely , pr e1894) In other words, it is through and by way of the actions of attr a ction a nd repuls i on that individ- uality is created. The initial c auses of the re- pulsive type chord is the unsync hr onization or lack of ha r mony be tween the f unda m e nt a l of the mas s and its inner and higher c om pone nt fr eque ncies as als o thos e tones of t he environ- ment in which the mas s is e m e r ge d. Jus t as the tones can combine and produce a be at tone s o too can the higher tones combine a nd produce sub-harmonics that a r e disc or dant to the high- er ‘fundamentals’ of the chord. When cons idering a w i de r view of man as he relates to hims elf within the greater context of the infinite reache s of ma t te r and energy (page 6) there ar e other urges moving him f orward. These are 1) the urge f or POWE R i s manif e st- ed from the time the c hi ld begins to move about, and through deve l opment as a child, and an adult, and even to ol d age. In games , in fight s , in s ocial prefer e nce, i n pol itics , in fi- nance s - alwa ys s eeking more powe r ; 2) the urge for P O S SES SIONS is f os tered fr om the time the child r e aches out f or a colored r a tt le on to the pos ses sion of es tates and all for ms of wealth and bodily comfort s ; 3) the urge of LOVE and LI FE is the diff e r entiating force. It is the manifes tation of the male a nd female. It includes the ur ge for parenthood, the love of humanity, the intellectua l uplift of the individ- ual; and 4) the urge of S PIRIT U AL UPL IFT and under s tanding of moral beauty and the ad- vance m e nt of human relations and t he “G od Within”. 3 1 In the se f our ur ge s we can r e adil y se e the two pri me f orces at work - the e xpr es - sive or male for c e and the as similative or fe- male.

B asic ally spea ki ng t he longer the wave length the lowe r the r a te of vibr a t ion or fre- quency. C onver s ely the shorter the wave length the higher the fr eque ncy. An e xample of this arrangement ca n be see n i n the chart on page 43. T he f irst vibration is 1 cycle or vibra- tion per second - it has a length of one unit. The next vibration is exactly 1 / 2 the l e ngth of the fir s t and ther e f ore twice its r ate of vibra- tion. The same principle applies to the thir d wave which is 1 / 3 of the length and 3 times its rate of vi bration. When two objec ts vibrate their relations hip vibr at or ily speak ing is one of relativity of tone or pitch. One vibrates at a given fr eque ncy a nd the other ha s its own ye t dif ferent fr e quency. The two laid up side by s ide would the n present two dis ti nc t tones . T hes e two tones bear an arithmetic r e lationship to each other. Notice the numbers of 1 / 2 a nd 1 / 3 i n the pre- ceding paragr a ph. T hes e relative values refer to the rate of vibration when cons idered as a ratio or wave length w hen cons idered as a fr ac ti on. Whe n two tones are compared in this way the r e i s es tablished a musical relations hip called pitch . This means or ref e r s to the rela- tivity of fr e quency betwee n two vibrating ob- jects or two tones. Pitch i s important bec ause it i s the quali ty of the pitch ( not s o much a ny given frequency) that es tablishes those quali- ties we know a s ha r mony or discord. “Harmony is the simu lta neou s vi brati on of two or more bod ie s whose harmoni cs d o not pro- duc e disco r d s , and whose fund ament al pit che s are ha r mon ie s of t he l owe s t pit ch, or a r e a uni- son w ith the resul tan t no te s or ove rtone s, or unde rton es, of a ny tw o o r more of t hem. \" (Ke e- ly ) Where we have a phys ical dimens ion we have a wave length of t ha t dimension a nd the fre- quency is invers e t o that quantity. In other words t he shorter the wa ve length the higher the f requenc y. A vi brating piano or guitar string will vi brate its fundamental as the same length as the string. If the stri ng is a foot long its fundamental wil l be about 1, 000 cycles per se cond, all other qualities be ing equa l. T he tens i on on t he string, its weight, temperature, thicknes s and mater ia l all play a pa r t a nd will modif y the f undamenta l tone a ccording t o their own qualities. So, generally speaking, the lower the number or quantity of wave l e ngt h units the higher the number of wa ves per ti me period.

Q uan t iz in g to O n e When de aling with a wholis- tic sys tem such as we are dis- cus sing here i t i s imperative to s ee the s ubject as a single whole. The idea usually as so- ciated with fr e quency and wave length does not do this . The body is a complex whole which i s to s ay it is the entir e- ty of those things t ha t go to make it up. It i s not the s um of its par ts beca use apple s do not add with or a nges and nei- ther c an he ar ts be adde d to livers. V i brations on the other hand can be a dded, s ubt ract- ed, mul tiplied and divided. A vibration is a vibration no matter what it is called. On page 10 we disc uss ed the three metals as though they were the equivale nt of musi- cal notes . The key here is equivalenc y or relative rela- tionships . A complex set of vibrations all having the i r own specific and dis cr e t e vi bration rate can all be brought w i thin a simple framework. T his pr o- ces s is called “Quantizing to One” and works like this . Simpl y reduce all t he vibr a- tion rates to a common de- nominator using the f unda- mental of t he gr oup as 1. All other rates then be come a mul tiple of this 1 and the whole iss ue and the sometimes large numbers become simplicity it s elf. Mu- sic is a ge ometr ic and arithmetic construct. As s uch it obe ys the rules of ari thmetic which a r e much s impl e r than s o- ca ll e d cal- culus and other moder n ma t he mati c al nightm a r e s. Natur e is simple a nd obeys simple rules.

Fir s t the r e is the liquid phase ; then the gaseous pha se; an ul tra-gase ous or plasma phas e and ultimately a s ub-atomi c or e ther ic phas e when the photons are liberated a s light. No doubt there ar e other f orms of matter a nd energy being relea se if we but ha d suffi c iently fine ins tr umentation and unde r s tanding to look for and rec or d them. Water when s ubjected to appropr ia t e vibra- tions will break down i nto its constituent pa r ts - hydr oge n and oxygen. When other for ms of vibration are brought upon water it will also releas e heat (infr a-red vibrations) and light.

T he r e sult would be t he ‘generation’ of a vapor of extraor dinary cha r ac ter is tics one of which is lum inos ity. The vapors releas ed during the cavitation pro- ces s is held by this a ut hor to be none other than the luminifer ous ether ic vapor John Ke e- ly liberated and worked s o much with during the late 1800s . He made many machines t o generate or liberate this vapor f rom water a nd then m a de many mor e machines that would use this etheric va por a s a prime mover or mo- tivating for ce . The origi na l Keely M otor of s o much fame operated on this vapor as di d the pneumatic cannon and the disintegrator of stone demons t rated in 1883. Later in his work, as late as 1888-1889, he di s - carded the e ther ic va por a s a working flui d and went directly to using pure sympathe t ic flows of higher e ner gy f orms and s our ce s.

Or, br oa dly spe aking, c ol loids are a s table mixtur e of one phas e (a solid) i n another (a liquid). The term colloidal ( de r ived fr om the Greek wor d for glue) was coined in 1861 by the chemis t Thom a s Graham ( 1805-1869?). D ur ing this time, E nrico Selmi precis ely des cr ibed col- loids and de veloped a theory of c harge inter- action of which several aspec ts a r e still vali d today. One of the fi rs t scientific s tudies of the preparation and pr ope r ties of colloidal gol d was done by Faraday (1857). He discove r e d the s ensitivity of c ol loidal gold to elec t rolytes and de monstrated the protective ef fect of gela- tin and other macromolecules . 2 Around the turn of the centur y colloids we r e popular and e xt e nsively e m ployed by pharma- cies eve r ywhe r e. 2 3 Colloid mills were us ed to grind ma t e r ials as fine as 1 / 2 0 0 0 of a n i nc h in siz e. Now we know that thi s s ize is barely a de- quate t o f orm true colloids. Notwiths t a nding this w as c onsidered appropri a te for the medic- inal us ages of that e r a. A colloid can be vis ual- ized by the following example. Whe n a s mall amount of c omm on sa l t is shaken up with wa- ter the s alt quickly dis appears and a perf e ctly homogeneous liqui d is obtained, w hi c h has a sa lt y tas te, but in which no par ticle s of sa lt ca n be detected, even under the highes t powe r mi- croscope . Even on long sta ndi ng the s alt does not s ettle out of the wate r , nor ca n the s alt be removed by filtr ation of the s ol ution. H owev- er, on evaporating of f the wate r , the sa l t is left behind in i ts or iginal for m. If, on the other hand, a littl e cha l k is sha ken up with wa t e r , a milky mixtur e is obtained in which the parti- cles can be readily s een and can be sepa r ate d fr om the water by s ettling or by f iltration. In the fir s t cas e, the salt is ta ken up or dissolve d by t he wate r f orming a true s oluti on; in the lat- ter cas e, the chalk is merely s uspended in the water. Be t w een the limits of true solution a nd sus pens i on lies the r e gion of c ol loid solution . A solution may be def ined as a homogeneous mixtur e of two or mor e s ubstance s, whic h (mi xture) c an var y in composition c onti nuous - ly within cert a in limit s . T he latter part of the definiti on serves to dis tingui s h s oluti ons from chemica l compounds. The latter a r e by defi- nite and i nva r iable composition, w her e as the compos i tion of a s olution of salt in water ma y vary within wide limits. Physica l che m is ts now divi de s olutions into three clas ses : ( a) molecular , suc h as dis solv- ing s ugar in wa t e r ; ( b) ionic , s uch as dis solv- ing sodium chloride (salt) in water; and (c) colloidal , such as dis solving ge l a ti n in water. Again, there are se ver a l class es of s olutions, arr a nged ac cor ding to the phys ical s tates of their components . We ma y have a ga s dis - solve d in a gas , in a liquid or in a solid. We may have a liquid dis solved in a li quid, in a gas or in a solid. We may ha ve a solid di s - solve d in a s ol id, i n a gas or in a liquid. T ha t part of a solution which i s pres ent in larges t propor tion is usually called solve nt , and the subs tance taken up by the solve nt is ter med the diss olved subs tance or s ol ute . When some subs tances , pr incipally acids ( gold), base s a nd sa lt s (silver), a r e dissolve d in water, their molecules undergo subdivis ion into tiny “cha r ged” parti c les c alled “ions” . All s ub- sta nces do not ionize and all liqui ds ar e not as good i onizing agents as is water.

Microclus t e r s consis t of tiny aggre- gates comprising f rom t w o to several hundr e d atoms of a given metal. What we gener al ly cons ider as pr operties of t he se metals on the macr oscopic scale are not always the same in this micros copic scale . Bas ic properties suc h as melti ng poi nt, valence , etc. change as the sma l l numbers of aggr e gated atoms gain or loose a few more atoms to the cluster. A thought occ ur s that i f t he se metals do not pos - se ss characteristics nor mal to thems elves while in a microcluster state then what a r e they w hen in this s t a te? If not a metal the n what? The c l us ters are unique in that s ome of their proper ties are determi ne d f rom the f a ct t ha t they a r e mostly s ur face as opposed to volume. More impor tantly it has bee n obs er ve d that be- caus e they poss ess an unf illed e lectr onic bond- ing ca pabili ty, they ar e parti a ll y “naked” (lacking s ome ele ctr ons ) and hence extr e m e ly reactive in the pr es ence of other “e lectron rich” s ubstanc es. When electrons are s hared by the whole c l us - ter in a deloc alized pattern, so that the ne ga- tive charge is no greater at any one point, the clus t e r may take on c er tain as pects of a s olid metal such as conductivity. Conve r s ely w hen the clus ters are s maller e l e c- tri c al conductivit y (and other meta l -like quali- ties) ar e not a s e vident.

T his means that a cti vities of e l e c- trons has littl e eff ec t upon a photon but the a c- tiviti e s of photons has gr ea t effect upon e l e c- trons. It also means that a ll s eemingly har d material subs tances are r e ally bundl e s of light as all subs tances are made of electrons s up- pose dly spinning around a nucleus a nd these electrons are composed of light! En zym es A lot is being sa i d a bout e nzymes thes e days and rightly des erved. T his class of chemica l subs tances is extraordinar y and e xt raordinarily impor ta nt to the human body. This i s not a book on e nzymes which are covered muc h better in ot he r works a nd thes e s hould be con- sulted. However t he r e are aspe cts about en- zymes not ne cess arily covered elsewhe r e. A nd this has t o do with their cha r ac ter is ti c colloid- al natures . In the early part of this century thes e s ubstance s were we ll nigh impos sible to se par a te due to the hi ghly diss olved state of colloids which thes e a r e. C zapek says “we know enzymes only by their actions ” bec ause he w as not able to s eparate them apart. En- zymes were r ega r de d a s insoluble colloids which are energetically absorbed by such agents as inf us or ial e ar th, kaolin or even filter paper. That enzyme action does not procee d along the routine li ne s of mol e cular pr opor- tions seems s hown by their extr e m e activity. Thus, 1 part of the inver ta se enzyme hydrolyz- es 200,000 parts of sugar, while 1 part of the enzyme rennin i s capable of coa gulati ng 800,000 ti me s its own weight of cas ein in a sa mpl e of milk. Enzymes are therefor e t o be regr a ded as “the catalytic a gents of the livi ng cells ” and are f ound both in animal and in vegetable tiss ues. 2 3 I t would appe ar that en- zyme colloids posse ss active proper ties or have for c es in action not unlike the colloids of metals .

Or could t he r ea l a nswer be something even more ignor e d or missing? How about the Grand T ransmuter of all t ime - the Mind?

A fur ther s ub- sta nt ia t ion of the antibiotic ef fec t s of the s ilver and gold when applied to the body c an be found in t his quote fr om Cayce: \" Not only do es t he act iv it y o f t he Gold (Chl oride ) t hen , mak e for t his v ibrat ion in t he body but i t produc es in t he E ndoc rinal s - th r o ugh it s a s soc iat ion s of the met all ic f orce s (e le ctri cal fl ow) from c oppe r to n ick el , th r o ugh t he el ec tri c c harge s, the lo w f orm passing t hrough th e syste m - th e stamin a, as it we r e , to the pl asm of th e nerve f orce s th emsel ve s.

Some pr oprietary preparations containing tin sa lt s have been of fered f or that purpose . 23 An- other interes t ing colloidal is that of bismuth. It was pr e pared in a number of ways a nd was employed in the tr ea t me nt of s yphi lis . 23 So the colloids of these metals are vitally im- portant to the i mmune s ystem of the body. It is the conditioned vibrations of the eleme nt s in the colloi d that m a ke the colloid va l ua ble. T he des ir able element of these colloids is their negative surface charge c oupled with the s pe- cific vibrations of the m e tals t he mselves . “We w ould use , t hen, for at l east t wo pe r i ods, th e l ow fo r m o f el ec tro-v ib r at ion s i n t he W et Ce ll Appl ia nce that wou ld c arr y Chl oride of Gold f or a we ek an d t hen Ni trat e of Sil ve r f or a wee k; t h e VIBRAT IO NS of the s e s o luti ons c ar ri ed to the body , not t he ele m ents t ake n int ernall y .

T his re- ionizing or r e pol a r izing of charge is all im- portant. I f a f orce is to exist it mus t be polar- ized or bi a sed i n or de r f or there to be a diffe- rential a nd a flow or cur rent or s t ream of its energized particles . An exa m ple of this polari- zation is the dif ference between magne ti s m as se en in a perm a nent magnet and electricity in a cir cuit. These two are r e gar de d as the be ing the s ame but there is a dif ference in that w hi le the two pos ses s two pol e s ea ch similarly these poles a r e ba lanced in the magnetic s t ream a nd unbalance d in t he electri c al curr ent. Hence there is a flow from one pole to the ot he r in electrical cur rents but no m ove m e nts a ppar e nt in the magnet. How ch arg e w orks Why is this negative charge s o bene f icial? B e- caus e there is maintaine d a dy namic bias or in- ter active polariz at ion . T his i ns ight can bes t be explained thusly: W hen a ny kind of energy is found to be in balance d state or in a s tate of equilibri um there is nothing out of ba l a nce. A balance d s tate impli e s one where action does not take place beca use all the f orce s are coun- terbalancing ea ch other. This is like a s ee-saw that i s pe r fectly balanced on bot h ends . I t does not move or se e- s aw bac k and for th bec ause eac h s i de counterbalanc es the other. If on the other hand a small or gr e at weight was place d on one s i de or the other of this se e- s aw t he r e would t he n be movement br ought i nto being. When t he f orces are equa ted or br ought into a sta t e of balance t he r e can be no motion or manifested energy. Just so in the Full Harmon- ic Chord mentioned ea r lier. As long as a ll the for ce s being cons idered a s balanced ther e ca n be no manifestation of any of them. When the condition of balance is es tablished this is re- fer red to as the Neutral as in the neutral pole where a positive and negative pole meet in the middle. I nteres tingl y this ne utr al point is not without charge or polarization. In f a ct i t is where both these poles me et and the r efore is inherently both positive a nd negative but the two a r e in a state of perf e ct balanc e and nei- ther out-weighs or out-balance s the other . If one likened this to t he fulcrum point of the se e- s aw it would be ea sier to visualize. In fin ite ly High D ivin e Visua li z ing t he f ulcrum point as a fi ne knif e edge upon which the se e- s aw is balanc ed im- mediately brings up the ques t ion: “How fine is this neutral point of balanc e?” It is infinit e l y fine. In fact the point c annot be properly de- fined becaus e it is inf initely subdividable - it is a inf initely fi ne line that has no dim e nsion. Taking a s tandard sine wave configurati on where a line is dr a wn to show t he pos it ive phas e above the neutr a l l ine and the nega t ive below it is a li ttle eas ier to vis ualize thi s infi- nitely fine point. ( Whic h in reality it cannot be visua l iz ed! ) On page 56 is a gr a phic show i ng just this s ituati on. At what inf initely fine point does the positive line me et the negative line? A circle is dr a wn t o s how wher e the y mee t macrosc opi c ally.

Cons ulti ng the cha r t on page 7 we can deduce that human beings ar e i nde ed molecular be- ings residing on the 3- dimens ional plane where there ar e found and used the three basic dimensions of height, widt h and de pt h. T he molecular pla ne on this chart is repr e sented as the fir s t a nd l ow est level out of nine poss i ble or theorized to exist.

The scie nce of sympathe t ic vibra- tion i s not unknown and has been writ ten about by many in t he pa st. Rudolph Steiner sa id in one of his many lectures in 1913: “The \"W est-p eopl e\" o f E ngl and and North A m e ric a wil l de ve lop the mate r i al- m e ch anic al oc cul ti s m. The y w il l be ab le to crea te mac hine s, mec hani cal de vi ce s whi ch work wi th hardly any hu man e ff ort; w hic h wo r k wi th th e he lp o f th e \" L a ws of Sy mpath et ic V ibrat ions. \" The s e mac hine s wil l do a bout 90% of the work, an d all t he soc ial and mate rial troub le o f work as we k now it n ow, wi ll c ease t o e xi st. ” (R udol ph S te ine r , 1913) For sympathetic vibr ation t o be a dm itted to the halls of s cience it w i ll be neces sary for the sc ientists residing therein t o recognize and embrace t he conce pt of L ove and Harmony. For , as we ha ve see n, this is the operative in- fluence i n the uni ve r s e. T o date we see litt le evidence of this ac ceptance. Scienc e today se r ves thos e who c an pay f or it. T hes e, mor e and mor e, a r e those for c es who ha ve a ssume d monopolistic foothol ds on societies needs a nd des ir es . I t seems the driving influence i n these for ce s is to G E T more and m ore materialit y whether i t be mone y, posse ss i ons or power over s ame. To gain greater market share under thes e ideals a cert a in amount of ruthless ness is requir e d. Howe ver ther e is a subtler method. Thi s method was s poken about and acte d upon by the ori gina l He nr y Ford when he prof es se d to be s ervi ng his market. He maintained that if the mar ke t liked his car it would support his eff ort to m a ke mor e of them. That his view- point was correct is a m a tt e r of history. M od- ern busines s s ees the acquis iti on and control of materiality as a basis of wealth and profit and therefor e has gone the other way and is out to GE T all it can for itse lf . T he only wa y to tr uly acquire is to give whe ther it be quality se r vice or a quality pr oduc t . Just any old s tan- dard of s er vic e or product will not suffice. Cos ts a nd prices are, of cour s e, negotiable. To se r ve an ever broader array of soc i e ty it takes Love a nd Unders t a nding. Ser vice to others in whateve r for m is the only way to higher a nd better l e vels of e xi s tence whether they be con- side r ed on the material or s pir itual planes or any other s in between. \" What , th en, is th e purpose of t he e nti ty 's ac ti vit y in the c onsci ousness of min d, matt er, spiri t in the p r e sent ?
