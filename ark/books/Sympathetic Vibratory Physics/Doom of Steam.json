As wa s shown ea r ly in t he first lecture, it was not es pecially de sired to carry criticisms upon t he C om pa ny's management beyond the stoc khol de r s , and those who were likely to be come such. Hence repor ts by the press were not s ought a f ter, although, if published, it was des ir ed that they be cor rect.

For s everal years the public mind has been cons i de r ably perturbed, and ve r y much abus ed, by pe r s istent eff orts thr ough the pr es s to propagate a be l ief t ha t the Keely M otor is a de l us ion, its a uthor a s windler, and their adherents dupes of his ingenious artif ice . The extens ive notoriety which thus has been thrust upon this invention i n advance of it s adve nt — albeit agains t the inventor's wish - gives the world, upon which it ha s be en obtruded, a ri ght t o some i mmunity fr om the err ors of judgment t o which it is exposed by the s ilence of M r . Kee l y and his f riends when as sailed by his ene m ie s; w hether thes e be public accus er s to r ob him of reputation, or private impostors who f lee ce him of the fr uits of hi s ge nius and toil. During m ore than f ive years of unprovoked abuse , he has never prompt e d an ac ti on in his own def e nse, by publication or otherwise; but with a patience which betrays the mos t exalted dignit y, his cours e is a cr uc i a l tes t of that immortal proverb enunciate d by Was hington: \" T o perseve r e in one’s duty a nd be s ilent, is the best ans wer to calumny. \" Whil e no motive can be ass igned for thes e publi c as saults , it is noticeable that they have chie f ly sprung from s our ce s prof es se dl y scientific, and s o done muc h to infl ue nce popular opinion. Cons equently betwee n the believers who know something about i t, and the doubters w ho do not, there exis ts in regard to the Motor an unpleasa nt and injur ious s uspens e, which, s o far as m a y be, it is my purpose here t o relieve, by show i ng through t he mos t e f ficient medium of intelli ge nce wherein the publ ic has been misled and the inventor misreprese nt e d. T he pr e vaili ng impr es sion that \"M r. K eely has bee n a long time about his Motor,\" is due to the publi c it y which it received at early and i nopportune s tages of its deve lopm e nt, while it was inc i pie nt as an invention, and long be f ore it s houl d have been brought into publ ic notice at all. This wa s the outcome of ambition coupled with inexperience on the par t of those who unf ortunately have had charge of the company's bus iness affiair s . Anxious to rais e the stock in public estimation for s peculative pur pos es, they undertook, among other maladroit m e asures , to obtain the endorsement of two or three prof e ss i ona l \" experts,\" who took the opposite course f rom what they were expected, and i n a labored ef fort to lay bar e the \" deceptions \" of Mr. Kee l y, expos ed t he ir own ignorance of the principles they prof e ss ed to te ach, bes i de s c omm itting the egregious blunde r of attempting to cr iticis e what they knew nothing about. T he y r epres ented institutions with high-sounding names, which ca used their advers e c r iticisms to inf luenc e the press , and so s atisfy the public t ha t M r . Ke ely wa s an impos tor , a nd his M otor a \" deception. \" They a tt ributed his wonderful power to compress ed a i r. Thi s was an attributi on of ingenuity greater than wa s pos ses sed by the whole sc i e nti fic world; for air never ha d bee n compress ed to one-half the e xt e nt nece ssa r y to the display of energy witnes sed by thes e \" experts. \" Their ignorance was illustrated by t he ir intimation t ha t a hydraulic s cr e w pump, which Mr. Keely had use d f or tes ting the dens it y and strength of metals , might be e m ploye d f or working up a c ompr es sion of air to ten thous and pounds — an idea m os t abs urd in t he s im ple st novice , to s ay nothing of prof es sers in physic s and dynamica l engineering.

Cupidity and incompetenc y would at diff e r ent tim e s, have made shipwreck of the C ompany, but for the fidelit y and f irmness in emergencies , of the otherwise mos t fl e xibl e and indulgent of men.

Mr. Keely's hes it a ti on to as sert his r ights , a nd espe cially to maintain them by litigation at the cost of precious ti me ; or even to e ndur e the annoyanc e of disputes , has on seve r a l occas ions made him the victim of nefarious t rans actions entered into w i th li ttle or no money consideration.

As a dir e ctor , there is no attempt here to excus e M r . Keely fr om fault in tolerati ng t he se abus es . But a s he is the chief loser by them, he cannot be s uspec t e d of c om plicity in them; and thos e who blame him for a ll ow i ng hi ms elf or the Company to be def raude d, s hould bear in mind that his pe culiar pr ovince is not fi nanc e , but invention, of which he has the whole burden t o ca r ry, and with which he is too busy to be constantly on his guard aga inst the tr ic ks a nd mistake s of other s in busines s matter s , when t he r e are twelve in the Board w hose espe cial duty i t is to take care of that depa r tment.

Fr om the organization of the Company, its a ctive \" f ina ncier s \" have gene r ally appeared to estimate the invention's value by its availability as a mea ns to personal ends , regardl e ss of its ultimate succ ess a s a public benefit, or as a n achieve m e nt in \"the advance m e nt of scienc e. \" Their ideas ar e so f a r be low the inventor's t ha t his aim overshoots their a ctions, and bef ore their moti ve s ar e disc over e d he is undermined, and recovers himself, only at e nor mous cos t. It is anything but encouraging to s ee the fr uit of his ene r gy s wept away bef ore it ripens; a nd by those who have betrayed his conf ide nce or abuse d his generosity. When the Company's interes ts are trif led with by its tr us tees, when its officers conduc t i ts aff airs as if its only worth was that of a t e mpor ary s peculation, how can it be expe cted that thos e who ha ve no other criter ion for their judgment will ha ve a ny confidence in it as a meritori ous e nt e r prise ? CAU S E O F L OW PRICE STOCK. When the Company was or ganize d, ins tead of s elli ng the stoc k, or, still better holding it as the rese r ve , for either hims elf or the treasury, it was divided among cert a in parties (vir tually given away by M r. Keely) a ccording to a plan a s ill-advised and unjus t, as it was avaricious on the part of those who received it; and r uinous to the credit of the Company, a s i t was expens ive to the inventor; for both Company and inventor a f terwards nee ded m one y whic h the s tock, if held in r e serve, would have readily brought at good pr ices . As it tur ned out, a number of the recipients of the se f a vor s , elated over their unwonted wealth, determined to r e ap the fi rs t fr uits, a nd s o make sure of a speedy for tune. Accordingly the y s ol d out in a m a r ket which at the time wa s t oo limit e d to carr y large amounts without becoming de pr es se d. He nce, while they realize d what might have been a competency if properly use d, others were embarrass ed and the Company disgrace d; for, not only did it suffer from the moral eff ec t of a fall in the price of s tock, but some of t he improvident, and cons equently ungr a t e f ul objects of the inventor's bount y, be came the vulgar a uthor s of his defamation. Mone y, which for ca r rying f orward the wor k, should have bee n rais ed by s ales of stoc k from time to time a s needed, was obtaine d by selling territor ial r ights in a dvance of the pa tents. Lately, as befor e , depreciations are due to quantiti e s of the stock which ha ve be en thrown i nto the market from large lots obtained in wa ys alr e ady indica ted, either for nothing or for trif ling cons ider a t ions — a nd c hi e f iy fr om the inventor. T he incide nt s of thes e tr ans actions are too numerous and complex to be given in detail at pr es ent. T he general fac t s mus t suffice and will be f ound in the sta t e ments which s hor tly f ollow. Obviously a pol ic y has bee n pursued at ti mes to keep both the inventor and the c om pa ny in a nec ess itous condition, for purposes of specula t ion. The so-called cons ol idation was evide nt ly hurr ied through under the press ur e of li ke motives . Thi s act added to t he property of the Company two other inventions , known as the Vapor Gun and the Automatic Wa t e r lift. The for mer is s hown to have s everal tim e s the projectile for ce of gunpowde r , while f or the latter it is cla i med that wa ter can be rais ed to any height without the application of extraneous power. These two inventions were believed to be s o valuable that if pos se sse d by t he Company it would be justified in largely increasing its capital s t oc k. As it was in a very depress ed condition financially, M r. Keely came to the resc ue a nd acc eded to the f ollowing sche m e : Rights to the two inventions were conveye d to the Company, a nd the capital s tock inc r ea sed f rom 20,000 to 100, 000 shares . Of the 80, 000 new s hares 40,000 went to pay f or the inventions, 20, 000 to the tr e asury of the Company, a nd 20, 000 were divi de d among the s tockholders, sha r e for share of what they already held."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"pa ge 7 of 14 Of the 40,000 shares which s hould have gone to Mr. K eely, not 5000 ever reached his hands . Ne ar ly if not quite 34, 000 went t o sa t is f y fr audule nt claims held by three men se par a tely agains t the inventor ; and lots of les s amount to other persons to whom he ha d made advanc e s ales at great s acrif ic e, in order to get money f or c ar rying forward the wor k. Seve r al of the di rectors therefor e were de eply interes t e d in urging through the \"cons oli da ti on,\" with its great injus ti c e to the inventor. The la r ges t of these frauds was i n the cas e of a transa ction whe r e one man, a cting a s an agent or attorney for Mr. Kee ly, dispose d of t w o- thirds of the Gun a nd of t he Wa ter -lift and did not make the pr oper retur ns . T he transferee came in for two- thirds of the 40, 000 shares se t apart t o pay f or the inventions. The other two claims, a lt hough for less amounts , were e qually unjust. It was the throwing of thi s s tock upon the ma r ket, littl e mor e than a year ago, that broke the prices down to a nominal rate, a nd disc our age d many holder s w ho had obtained their stock by fair purchase . AT WHO S E EXPE N S E ? Avoiding particulars, the general facts here to be s hown a r e as f ollows : As M r . Kee l y capitalized and stoc ked the Company in t he fir s t plac e by the sale of interes t s e xclusively his, and putting the money into the tr ea sury, $50, 000 a s a gift and $50,000 more a s a loan, and t he n distributed three-four ths of the stoc k to non-payers therefor ; so he fur nis hed the 80, 000 sha r es of increas e i n the s econd place; for no money was either paid or prom is ed to him in t he cons olidation. Mone y f or carrying f orward the work and defraying other expense s of the Company, is now r ais ed entirely by s elli ng the Treas ury stock, w hi c h is w holly A GIFT f rom Mr. Keely, and the r ioters upon this benefit a r e taunted as dupes f or being \" mi lked of their money. \" Of the entire 100,000 sha r es , less than 15,000 remain in the treas ur y whil e of the other 85, 000, not one-f ourth was f a ir ly paid for by first holde r s . By his own i mprudence , a nd the adva nt a ge taken of i t by others, the cos ts ha ve been incur red, as well a s the wor k done, by Mr. Kee ly, who s eems to care for nothing but s ucces s, regardles s of pecuniary benefits. He has often submitted t o the most outrageous terms when funds were not f orthcoming in the proper way, and with hi m any s acrif ice was better than s uspens e. Had intelligent de voti on to the enterpri s e equa l to that dis played in the mechanica l depart me nt c har a cterized its financial manage m e nt, the wor ld might long ago have been r e aping the f ruits of this unpr e cedented discovery.

T he dise ase , although cons tituti ona l , should be cured by this time, i f ther e is a ny virtue in blee ding and leec hing. A m a n of gr e at phys ical strength, a hard worker with hi s ow n hands , and remarkable f or e nergy, activit y and industry, Mr. Keely is also a close observer, a comprehens i ve , liberal thinker, and bold expe r imenter.

It include s all that relates mecha nically to travel, tr ans port a ti on, manufacture, mining, engine er ing and warfar e ; and with thes e a change in many s cientif ic theor ie s. I t is iconoc lastic . Mr. Keely ha s dis covered a new world; and, although a w i lde r nes s unexplor ed and of untold wea lt h li e s be yond, he is treading f irml y its border , which daily w i de ns, a s with deepening inter e st he pushes hi s explor a t ions , and amplifi e s the expans e be tween the marches of s cience and his advanc ing fr ontier. He has pass ed the sha dowy realm where phys icists are groping. H i s rese ar c hes ar e beyond the scintillating horizon of molecular physic s and r adiant matt e r , in the open field of eleme nt a l f orce, whe r e gr a vi ty, cohe sion, iner tia and momentum are disturbed in their ha unt s and diverted to us e; — where fr om unity of origin emanates inf inite energy in dive r s if ied for ms , and w i th manifol d expres sion r es ponds to the earnes t invoca t ions of man; — and where, as els ewhere, plastic nature will a ccommodate he r s elf to the r equirements of art, when ge nius makes the pr ope r appeal. THE MOTOR is only one a m ong s everal features of Mr. K eely's dis covery; but be ing t he chief subject of comment and disc ussion, our attention he r e must be mainly occ upied with it, in relation to its machinery, — the gener ator and the engine . These two mecha ni s ms, together with the force produced by the one and us ed by the other, make up what are comprehens ively s poken of a s the Ke ely motor; just as we say locomoti ve , or steam engine; meaning the fire- box, t he boiler, the engine a nd the stea m . As in this cas e the motor is an energy called expans ion or pres sure; us ing va por ized water as its body or medium; so, in a definite sens e, the Keely vapor is the body or me di um of the f orce which it carr ies , and which is properly called the m ot or . WHAT IS IT ? Steam and Keal (or Keely va por ), however, must not be r e gar de d as in any s ense the s ame, or even similar. As they are oppos i te i n origin, s o are they diff erent in action. T heir proper ties are manifestly unlike. One is deri ve d from heat or combus tion, and so, may be said to have a che m ic al origin. The other is a pr oduc t ion of mec hanical ac t ion, or f orce — spontaneous for c e. The latter, ther e f ore, is more natural than the former, since less of e f fort and appliance are nec ess ary to produce it. The hypothes is that hea t and f orce are equivalents, a l te r nates , and int e r cha nging properti e s of matter , leads logi c ally to t he conclusion that ene r gy may be e vol ve d f rom water as a n ef fec t of the latter, as well as a product of the former; — a nd perhaps ene r gy which ma y be tr a nsfor med a nd uti lize d with vastly"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"pa ge 10 of 1 4 greater fac i lity and economy.

THE MECHANICAL or physical is supervening upon the che m ic al and the animal, in many ope r ations , as nature's law s are better unde r s tood, and adva nt a ges being take n thereof to accomplish great ends . By directing energies already at work, rivers are made to deepen their be ds and change their banks , while hydraulic mining adds its evide nces of the power of l iquids over solids . These are crude illustrations of the finer c ontr olling the coars er , and are but little above the ba se of great as cents, upon which we have just started. T he telephone begins to suppla nt the tele gr aph, and is among the beginnings of vibr o-dynamics .

By s pont a neous for c e we mean gravity, elasticity, etc. Vibration, whether considered as a force or a motion, is an inher e nt proper ty, or concomitant of matter, and therefor e s pont a neous. EXP LANATION DIFFI C UL T. Mr. Keely's method of producing and us ing power is so e nti rely original, and the c har a cter of the energy evolved and employed is so unlike any other, that an attempt to describe the proces s or the product, or to explain the pr inc i ple , must be made with hesitation and attended with di fficulty; as ther e is not hing in the annals of experience or the f ac ts of scienc e to af ford a starting-poi nt f or the understa ndi ng.

The Generator is undoubtedly the strongest mecha ni s m in t he wor ld. I t weighs about t hree tons , will sta nd freely in a space f ive feet long and high by two feet wide.

T he prospec t for this has very much im proved dur ing the pa st ye ar . At the las t e l e ction, in De cember, 1880, a new element was brought into the Boa r d, w hi c h has developed more r e al busines s e ner gy, activity and integrity than has been s hown befor e since t he Company wa s organized. This has given new courage to the inventor , and to stoc khol de r s ge ner a l ly who are a cquainted with the situation. IN POPULAR E ST IM AT ION the Motor is growing rapidly. T his is evinced by the increas i ng number of ea r nes t inquiries and express ions fr om busine ss and thinking me n, as the inventor’ s progress enables him to give more sa ti s factor y demonstrations. A few papers of hi gh standing, which have a lways treated t he invention and its author with f airnes s, are now s peaking mor e strongly in their favor, while the sa t irists have grown more respe ctf ul, and sens ational cynics have , for the m os t part, either sought obscurity in s ilence on the subje ct, or ar e m a king ha ste to redeem themse lves by a cha nge of attitude, and so avoid the nec ess it y of retr a cting at a later day, under the pr e ss ur e of public e nthusias m over the Motor’s succe ss. Thi s or de r is reverse d in the cas e of the “A m e r ica n M achinist,” which comes in at this late hour and puts itself on record as a s keptic. This it does on the opinion of one C harl e s H.
