By Pr ofes sor GEORGE FR AZ ER F ITZ GERALD. \"A l l are but part s of one s tupendous whole Whos e body nature is , and God the soul. \" We often s peak of s pace as being empty. We spe ak of an empty room w hen it is quite full of air. We spe ak of empty spac e betwe en the stars. From this point of view the f irst l ine of the above couplet should r un: \"A l l are but part s of one s tupendous hole . ” When we m ore ca r efully conside r matters, however, we m us t concede that this w ay of s peaking does not accurately r e pr e sent even the popular view of nature.

What the ca use of day and night can be, see ms a se r ious diff iculty to this hy- pothes i s . It would, anywa y, justify t he sugges ti on as to t he useles snes s of the sun which came . out by day, though it would hardly explain the usefulness of the moon. T his view is not even held by \" cr a nks\" nowadays. Li ght is attr ibuted to the s un, to la m ps , to c andles, and not to the eyes of the obs er ve r . Metaphys icians may as k f or the se nse in which one can s peak of light being present without an observer, but e ven i n this age of skepticis m , these very im portant metaphysi- cal questions have not yet attracted popul a r attention. W e are c ontent to as sert that in some sens e or another we a n justified in spea king of light be i ng due to the sun, or a lamp. A mor e rece nt view was that light was due to sma l l particles emitted by br ight bodies. T his wa s a hypothes i s wit h many things to recommend it. In this ca se it wa s certainly inac cur a t e to spea k of interstellar s pace a s e mpt y.

T he r e a r e , in addition, seve r al other diff ic ul ties in this hy- pothes i s . Very curious and rather inexplicable f its of eas y ref le cti on and e asy t rans mi s sion have to be attr ibuted to t he se light pa r ticles . In order to e xpl a in them, S ir I s aac Newton s uggested that all spa ce was f ull of a flui d w hi c h in some way c aused the se inexplicable f its. Such a s uggestion almost surrendered all ground f or t he hypothes is that t he r e were any light particles at all. Once it is conce ded that there i s a medium f illing spac e, why not attribute light to the vibr a ti ons of this medium in the same s or t of way as we attri bute s ound to the vibr ations of the air? This is, in f ac t, the hypothesis now he ld, and while it explains almost every fac t conne cted with light, there are no known facts nece ssa r ily inconsis t e nt with it. Stil l, there are people w ho do not believe in this medium. T hey seem to think that the s un may act upon us he r e without any intervening medium. Such people do not appreciate the diff iculty in thus explaining what be comes of the action dur ing the eight minutes it t a kes to reac h the earth af - ter it has left the s un. The light takes eight m inutes to pas s over the intervening spa ce. W hat is it during, thes e eight minutes ? One vi e w was that it exis t e d as small particles tr a veling with an enormous ve l oc it y. This hypothes is is untenable be cause it does not explain a numbe r of other light effects. T he other view is that it exists as s ome s or t of periodic c hange i n structure of an in- tervening medium whic h is c alled a wave of light in the ether . T his is consis tent w i th all known phenomena, and no other hypothesis has as yet bee n publi s hed which has been s hown to explain in a n intelligible wa y the phenomena of li ght. But t he r e are other phenomena due to the air, f or ins t a nce, in addition to s ound. I t has chemical actions , it c an blow things a bout by winds , it c an bur s t s tr ong ves sels by its pres sure. Are there no phenomena due to the ethe r exce pt l ight? Surely a medium whose vibrations are s o i mportant can hardly f ail to pos se ss other pr operties . L ord Sali s bury, no doubt , said in his i na ugur al addres s las t year, as Pres i de nt of the British Ass ociation at Oxford, that the only f unction of the ether wa s to undulate. Thi s was a m os t extraordi na r y m is take for even a politi c o- s cientist to ma ke. It is one of the glor ies of B r itis h scienc e that by Far a day and Clerk M axwell a sure foundation has been laid f or the theory tha t elec tr ic and magnetic forces are due to the ether. Its only function is to un- dulate! One might as well s ay the s ame of the atmos pher e or of the waters of the s ea. No doubt the undul a t ory, elec t ric and magne t ic proper ties of the ether require us to s uppose a ver y much simpler na t ure f or the ether than for any know n for m of ordinary matter. Or dina r y m a tt e r , with which we are so f a m iliar that we tr ea t it s wonders with contempt, is fearf ully and wonderf ully complex. We cannot hope to e xpl a in the innumerable pr ope r ties of air, f or ins tance, which is quite a simple f orm of ma t ter compar e d with mos t other commonly occurr ing forms, without at- tri buting t o it s om e very complicate d structure. T he proper ties of the ether are s o s impl e that there is every hope that we may be a bl e to explain its pr operties by attr ibuting to it a simple structure. So far as is known we nee d only attribute to it the ability to produce e l e ctr ic f orce and magnetic force in or der to e xpl a in all the phe nom e na which c an be r epe ated in any pr operly equipped laborator y. It is as if w e ha d an invisible bar by mea ns of which we c oul d either pus h or pull or twis t objec t s a t a distance . T hes e a r e very s impl e operations, a nd if they were t he only ones that the invisible bar could perfor m we might ve r y f airly de scribe it a s posse ss ed of very simple pr ope r ties . No real or dina r y matter is so extr a or dinarily s impl e as that. A solid glass bar , f or instance, would prevent our pus hing our fi nge r s a cross it; i t would bend light that pass ed through it ; it would reflect light f rom its s ur face ; i t w oul d absorb heat; it could be m e lt e d if r a ised suff iciently i n temperatur e ; it could be acted upon chemica l ly by hydrof luoric acid; and it would pos se ss innumerable other i mportant pr ope r ties , s o that we could hardly f a i rly des cr ibe it as posse ss ed of very simple proper ties . Of course no one can prophes y that there may not be found many other impor tant properties of the e t he r whic h may show it to be ver y c ompl i- cated. T he very fact that m a tt e r is so complicated, a nd that ether is s o intimately connected with matter, s hows that the e t he r m a y be ve r y c ompl ic ated too. At present, howeve r , it s eems as if"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Et he r and I ts Fu nct i ons - pa ge 4 of 8 thes e complications were due to the complex nature of matter, while a compa r atively simple ether w oul d suffice to explain all we know. In the be ginni ng of scienc e it wa s dif ficult f or people to believe that we were living a t the bottom of an ocean of air. Winds were looked upon as s ubt le entities rather than as movements of the air. The rising of water in pumps was as cribed to a n unexplained natural principle of abhorrence of a vacuum. I n a similar way we ha ve, until within the las t few de cades , bee n content to explain electric and m a gnetic forces by a natur a l principle of attr a ction of electri c it y and magnetism. A s soon, howeve r , as the existence of w i nds and the rising of water in pumps , the height of the ba- rometer , and the flight of ba l loons we r e all explained by the varying pres sures in an oc ean of gas , people gave up their f ormer obvious l y uns ati s factory and provi s ional e xplanations, and nobody now doubts t he theory tha t thes e phenome na are all due to a medium whose vibrations constitute sound. All the se properties have be en show n to be consis t e nt pr ope r ties of a s ingle medium, and cons equently nobody doubts of the e xi s tence of this m e dium . We now are persuade d that we feel this medium when the wind blows us; we se e its action when balloons r is e; we hear its vibrations in s ound. In a similar wa y elec tr ic, magne ti c and light phenomena are all c onsistent proper ties of a single medium, and c onsequently no one should doubt of t he exis tence of this medium. We should feel t his medium when a m a gnet pulls at a piece of iron we hold; we should see its action in a flash of lightni ng; we should see its vibr ations in light. But, it may be s aid, nobody has bee n able to explain t he se proper ties ? Well, neither ha s anybody been able to explain the propert ie s of the a i r. Some of the simpler properties of the air ca n, no doubt, be explained by supposing it to cons i s t of countless s mall e l a stic part ic l e s of diff erent siz- es and we i ghts jostling one another about. The e l a sticity of these part ic l e s is , howe ver , unex- plained, a nd a great many of their propert ie s, notably the whole s eries of thes e chemical proper - ties, are still in that obviously provisional condition of be ing described as simply proper ties of doing this, that and the other. The electric, magnetic and luminous properties of the ether are very much simpler than the innumerable proper ties of air , and it is cons equently not unreason- able to expect that they will be explained, and it is cons equently unreasona ble to doubt of the ex- istenc e of the ether becaus e of its poss ess ing unexplained pr ope r ties , while we have no doubt of the existence of air though it pos ses ses ve r y many more une xplained properties. Several di rec t ions ha ve been sugges ted in which we may look for explana ti ons of the simple proper ties of t he ether. It has be en sugges ted that it may consis t of pa r ticles somewha t like thos e of a gas , only ve ry much s maller and moving, about with ve r y much greater rapidity. It has not, however, been f ully s hown how thi s hypothesis can explain the electric and magnetic propert ie s of the ether. Other s ha ve gone to the opposite extreme, and suppose d that t he ether m a y cons ist of s moot h hard par ticles alm os t c ompl e t e ly filli ng spa ce, inste ad of being v ery small compared with their dis t a nces a par t. T hes e parti c les are suppos ed to slide or roll over one a not he r s o freely that the y practically offer no res istance to ma t ter m oving among them. This see m s in many wa ys a rather hopeful direction in which to look for a n explanation of the pr operties of t he ether. I t ha s not, howeve r , be en fully wor ked out, though Pr of. Hertz has s hown, in his pos thumous wor k, that suc h a suppos ition i s not inconsis tent with what we know of elec tr ic a nd m a gnetic actions , for he a t tributes all dynamica l actions in nature t o actions of this ki nd. It wa s the direction in which C ler k Maxwe ll sought for a dynamical, material s ystem that would posse ss the s ame sort of properti e s as be s howed that the ether mus t poss ess . All t he se theori e s depending on the existe nce of hard bodies in spa ce, whether like ga seous at- oms they have lar ge distanc es between the m , or like t he se cond hypothes i s they have s mall dis- tances betwe en them, labor under the disa dvantage of pos tul a ti ng the exis t e nce of thes e hard bodies without off ering any explanation of the cause of their hardness , e t c .

I t does not see m imposs ible t ha t all the complexities of nature may be e xpl ic able by this hypothes is. A being livi ng in the mids t of an in- fini te oc ean of liquid, whic h w as perfectly t rans parent and at res t, might never dis cover it s exis- tence, just a s mankind lived f or generations i ns ide an oc ean of air without f ully realizing its exis- tence, e ven though t he y had plenty of motion in the winds to help them. Such a being mi ght be suppos ed some day t o meet a gr ea t whirlpool and thus become suddenly alive to the existenc e of the me di um ar ound him. H e would probably, at first, think of the whirlpool as an independent entity. He w oul d, how ever, ultimately f ind t ha t its ef fects exte nded to a ll places he could reac h. No doubt, at a dis tance fr om the whir lpool, its effects would be ver y s m a l l, whil e ne ar to i t its ac- tions w oul d be so t remendous that maybe he could neve r ge t quit e close to its ce nt ral c or e. With this evidence befor e him, w oul d not s uch a being be justifi e d in s upposing tha t this a ctive thing was a kind of movement in a medium extending thr oughout all the s pace he could reac h? We find a very similar sta t e of af fairs ne ar atoms of matter. They have a central region where their action is so intense that we have no evidence that we can penetrate it . Ar ound this and extending throughout spa ce, diminishing in intensity the fur ther we go fr om t his ce ntr al core, are a ctions acc om pa nying this atom. Clos e in there a r e chemical actions . I t may ha ve ele ctr ica l and magnetic actions . I t always has gravitati ona l ac ti on at all pl a ces, at lea st as far as t he s olar s ystem extends . Is it then irr a ti ona l t o suppose that these atoms are thems elves r ea l ly only a part ic ul a r kind of motion in a medium that fi lls all spac e? In or de r that a n incompr es sible liquid s houl d be able to transmit actions s uch as gravity, electric and magnetic f orce, light , etc. , it mus t its elf be full of motion. L ord Kelvin ha s shown that c ert a in kinds of dis tur ba nces might be propagated in a man- ner somew hat similar t o l ight vibrations, by a liquid whose par ts were in intense m otion. I n or der that t he ac ti on may be propaga t e d rapidly, the m otion of the liqui d must be very intens e. T he av- erage s peed of the motion of its pa r ts must be c ompar a bl e with that of the propagation of the dis- turbance. In t he c ase of light pr opa gation this is ver y gr e at. L ight goes one hundred and ninety- two thous and miles in a s econd. T he parts of the me di um must cons equently be movi ng on the average with a velocity compar a ble w i th this. S ome yea r s a go, Pr of. De Volson Wood pr opos ed to c alculate the a ver a ge ve l oc it y of the parts of the ether in a s omewhat similar way. T here was , at that time, a ver y s erious objection to this. P rof. Wood w as applying the theory of gases to this cas e. Now, though ther e its some similarity betwee n the cas es, there is an es se nt ial dif ference . Disturbance s, s uch as s ound waves , are pr opa gated by t he c ompr es sion and raref a ction of a gas . Li ght is known to be pr opa gated by some other kind of action, we don't know exactly what, but it certainly i s not by compr e ss i ons a nd rarefactions in the ether. It wa s, cons equently, quite ill e git i- mate to a ppl y a calcula t ion which was only known t o be true of thi s ki nd of motion to quite a dif - fer e nt kind of action. Be f ore such a pr oc eeding w oul d become in any wa y jus t ifiable, it was nec- es sary to prove that this quite diff erent kind of ac t ion could be propagated at a ll by a medium whos e parts were in intense movement, and P rof. Wood had not at that time s hown rea son for be- lieving this . If the parts of t he medium are r ea l ly movi ng at thes e tremendous spe eds, every c ubic foot of the medium must ha ve some energy in it. I f the medium be at all dens e, the energy of its motion will be very large. Each cubic foot might, for ins tance, be looked upon as a cubical box containing whirli ng whee l s . If the wheels are mass ive, and whir ling with tremendous rapidity, there w i ll be a great deal of energy in the box. I f t he w heels are very light, there will not be very much e nergy, even though they are whir ling very rapidly. C an we make any es t imate as to w hether the medium is r a r e or dense ? M ost of the estimates that have bee n made lead to t he conclus ion that it is very rar e . They each depe nd upon some unproved ass umption. We have no conclusive pr oof as to the dens it y of the medium. It i s generally thought that, becaus e we do not dir ec t ly perceive the medi- um, it must be ver y rar e . T his is by no means the c ase . T o r eturn to the be i ng immer s ed i n the ocea n of liquid, be wa s unable to perceive. Whether it w er e a dense liquid or no, would not make any dif ference to him.

If he was s uddenly t rans f e r red to a very r a r e medium, he would perceive the dif ference. Li ke the ancie nt m a r iner, he “felt so li ght, almost,” “he thought that he had di e d in s leep,” “a nd was a bless ed ghos t. ” But then this w as suppos ed not to be one of the experience s of this be i ng. He was a lways ac customed to have to move all this de nse medium wheneve r he moved his limbs. In fact, he had never attribut e d this ine r tia to the medium at all. He had always attribut e d it to his l imbs . In a similar way w e, w hen we m ove a s tone or a bit of lead or platinum, attr ibute its iner tia to the body move d, while really t he inertia ma y be due to the medium we move a long with the body. Thi s must actually be t he c ase if the hypothes is already mentioned, a s to the nature of matter, be true. If matter be it s elf only a part of the medium, which is pos ses se d of s ome peculiarit y of motion, then the inertia of matter is mer e ly t he i ne r tia of the medium itself. If thi s be s o, it would appea r as if the m e dium mus t be at least as dens e as pla t i- num. When we move a piece of platinum, we may not move all the medium inside it, and i n that cas e the density of t he m e di um may be much greater than that of platinum. Ther e is nothi ng c er - tainly know n to dis pr ove s uch a hypothes i s . If , for insta nce, the m e dium be f ive times as dens e a s platinum, i .e. , a bout one hundred t imes as dens e a s wa ter , all t ha t it would require would be that when we move wa ter about we a r e only moving the one-hundr edth part of the medium that occu- pies the s pace of the water, and this does not seem at all an imposs ibl e hypothe sis. I f this be so, how much energy m a y there be in one cubic f oot of e ther ? There will be about one hundred mi l- lion of million of m illion f oot pounds of energy. T his would supply a million horse - powe r f or five thousa nd years. Such a calc ul a ti on as this doe s not pr etend to prove that the r e is this energy in e ach cubic f oot of the ether. All it pr etends to is to s how t ha t in our present des per a t e condi- tion of ignor anc e, we know nothing with a bsolute cert a int y that disprov es the possibility of this energy being there. Is this e nergy available? We ll , it is not s afe to pr ophe sy what is and what is not poss ibl e . M ost prophesies as to what is and what is not possible have proved untrue. Until, howeve r , we have disc over e d how to utilize the i mmens e known stores of energy i n ea ch cubic f oot of gros s matter, in the earth, in the water of the s ea, and i n the air about us , energy whos e natur e is pr e tt y well known a nd whose amount we c an approximately es t imate , until we have found out s om e way of doing this, it s eems ver y unli ke l y that we s hall be able to utilize the energy of the ether, even if we are right in our hypothesis that it exis t s . Each cubic yard of air poss ess es more than f our f oot tons of energy, owing to the moti on of its molecules , and yet we have not f ound out any way of using this. If we could only catch hold of whicheve r of the molecule s we wished and harnes s them to a c ar , and let thes e go when we had got all the e ner gy out of the m we requir e d and harnes s up fresh molec ul e s, it would enable us to use this energy. The dis covery of how to use the chemica l energy of coal would be a bsolutely nothing compared with this. It has bee n sugges ted that s om e of t he mi nute r ba cter ia ar e able to do this . I s it imposs ible that lar ge r or ganis ms m a y be able to do it? Is it imposs ibl e that the y may develop the ability thus to sort out the molecule t he y requir e in their ow n supe r ficial c ells? I f bacteria have deve l ope d this abili ty in their cells, may not mankind by judicious se lection or by other means attain a s imi lar ability? We could eas ily f ly then; we could do many other wonder ful things. We may fly bef ore that. A surf a ce se t s uddenly in mot ion with a veloc i ty greater than that of s ound i n air would, at l e ast temporar ily, ha ve a pres sure of nearly f ifteen pounds per square inch on i ts surface, and a n area of twelve square inc hes w oul d then support a heavy man. Thi s is , however, quite beside the ma t ter in hand. And what i s all this fier c e motion in s pace which we desire to direct in a ccordance with our wishe s? How do we now dir ec t motion in acc or da nce with our wishes ? Is ther e any motion di- rected in accordance with our wis hes? C er ta i nly there is, if “in accordance with our wis hes” ha s any real meaning. We can of ten direct the motions of our limbs in accordance with our w i s hes .

We do this by learning what we ca ll the law of natur e , or the r ule s of that gr ea t organism with which we ha ve to w or k, and accommodating ourse l ve s to them. But what is the “we” and what are “our wis hes? ” W hat is t he “ I ” of a nother person? In old times pe opl e us ed to a t tribute feelings and s ensa t ions and thought s to t he heart, liver , s pleen, etc. Nowada ys we locate all thes e in t he brain. Why? B ecaus e we f ind that a n a ni mal can get along very comfort a bly without a l iv- er or spleen for a short time, s o long as its nervous sys tem, of which the br ain is suc h an impor - tant cente r , is kept in w or king order. So long as the brain is i n wor king order a person can feel and think. I f it is out of order or im properly supplied with blood the f ee l ing and thinking are dis- order e d. There is every reason t o suppos e that our feeling of light is conc er ne d with one s eries of brain c ells, our f ee li ng of sound with anothe r ; that s o long as we f ee l light ther e are certain change s, i . e. , movements going on in one set of brain cells; while w e are consc ious of beauty some kind of cha nge is going on, maybe not only in our brain cells but a c oncomit a nt cha nge af - fecting our whole s ystem.

It is quite likely, a f ter all, that the s pleen may be concerned in thes e things, and the li ve r too. Anyway, what is of impor tance at prese nt is that the only way in which another per s on's angr y pass ions exis t as a reality for me are a s very complicated movements in their organism. We do not know what m ove ments in the brain c ells corr e spond to the sens ation of red light, nor what to a shril l sound. Ne it he r movement is probably one bit like the vibr a ti ons of the e ye molecules, nor of the ear molecules , that excite the c ell mo- tions.

B ut these move m e nts of his army are not a bit like the wa vi ng f lag whic h started them. W e can, however, t race a connec t ion be tween them. T he y are things of the s ame kind. They are both movements of ma t te r . Simi la r ly, the movements of the ear-dr um and those of the brain m ole cules are things of the same kind. E very action I ca n perce i ve in another per s on i s of this same kind. B ut the s hr ill sound I perceive is not of this s ame kind. Ugliness and guiltines s are not movements of matter . But then I can not per - ceive the shrill sound that another person feels. W e may both, no doubt , in a colloquial s ense , hear t he s ame sound, but I am not consc ious of the other person's feeling. T he s ame s ource caus- es two feelings , one in me, the ot he r in the other pe r s on. I feel my own feeling, I cannot f ee l the other person's feeling. T he only way in which the other person's f e eling exis t s for me is as a movement in his br a i n, the only wa y in which my feeling exis t s for him is as a movement in my brain. We know as yet no wa y of getting behind t his . There seems every reas on to think that what is behind thi s movement may be as c ompl ica ted a s the ar my manoeuvers compa r ed with the wa ving of a flag. I t is hard to s ee how otherwise to explain the fact t ha t br a in movements can corr e spond to such a variety of f e elings a s light and sound, beauty a nd ugliness , goodne ss and guilt. It is well to c all all thes e “feelings , ” notwiths tanding the boy who defined an abstract term to be a thi ng like c onscienc e that one c annot feel. It is always nec ess ar y to recollec t that to me thes e feelings ar e the only r ea l ity; othe r pe ople's f ee l ings are to me an elabor a te and f requently err one ous inf erence . One of t he m os t i nte r es ting inve stigations of t he pres ent day is as to the positions of atoms in molecules . T he whole sys tem is too s mall to see . We c an form s om e rough c onception of their arr a ngement from their behavior , j us t a s we can f orm a n es timate a s to the orbit of a double star fr om the changes , in its s pectrum, e ven though the components a r e f a r t oo close to be s eparately visible. We are gradually learning how to read, in the s pectrum, the s tor y of what is t a king pl a ce in m ole cules, too. T here is some prospec t that we may some tim e e ven be able to tell wha t move- ments in t he brain cells corr es pond t o a sens ation of r e d light, and, if the world las ts long e nough, and mankind i s good e nough, we may be able to disc over what movements in his syste m corr e- sponde d to Wilber force's determination to put down slavery. But if the s pleen is involved i n angry pass ions, it is evident that moti ons outside our brain and even our nervous s ystem are involved in f ee li ngs and thoughts. Where does our br ain end? Where doe s movement c ease to have a cor res ponding thought? Sur e l y all movement must have a"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Et he r and I ts Fu nct i ons - pa ge 8 of 8 corr e sponding thought. And perchance when we know the movements corresponding to a de ter - mination to abolish slavery we m a y be able to form some dim c onception of t he thoughts that corr e spond to the movements of the ea r th, of the s olar sys tem, t o the deve l opment of specie s of animals a nd pla nt s . These thoughts wil l not be our t houghts , nor our ways their wa ys. That they are not does not nece ss ar ily place them be yond inves tigation. We alr e ady know much about f our dimensiona l spa ce, and can state things t rue of multi- dimens i ona l s pace, though even of f our di- mens i ona l s pace we c an form no concrete conception. In the same way we may hope s om e time to make sc i e nti fic statements about the thoughts of the universe, though we may be quite unable to repr oduc e them as our thoughts. Even now we dea l wit h t he univer s e as with a person. How do we get others to do what we wis h? By making them feel our wis hes directly? No. By paying attention t o the laws of their na tur e and by s o a cting ourselve s as to c ause them t o act as we wis h. Is not that a l s o a des cri ption of how we ac t on na t ure? How do others act on us? By spe aking to us with s igns. Doe s not nature speak to us i n the same way? We interpr et other people's s igns and judge that they have corresponding thoughts. Are we then wrong in considering the signs of na- ture as the language in whic h the t houghts of na tur e are e xpr es se d? All the greates t, wises t, bes t have i mplored and exhort e d mankind to believe thi s . P rophets and se er s , philos opher s and poets, have taught mankind thi s f a i th. We have faith in t he e xistence of the thought s c or res pondi ng to othe r people's brain- moveme nt s . Without this faith life would be a mockery. Is it not almost a mockery without the greater f a it h? The gr ea test, wis est, be st have sa id s o. I t is the alm os t ne cess ary c onclusion of sc i e nce. Science has by itself no pr oof of the ex- istenc e of other people's thought s . Scienc e then cannot be expe cted to pr ove the e xi s tence of thes e thoughts more complex, i nde ed, than othe r people 's thoughts, but which can, for all that, be sa f ely c alled thoughts. D o we not show our wisdom by holding fast by the tea ching of the great- es t, the wise st and the best? Is it not the most glori ous pr os pect for s cience that it may one day give a definite form to t he greates t thoughts of mankind's greates t sons ?"}]
