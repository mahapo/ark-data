I t is a s tate of vi bration w hi c h is to s ay an e ner gy acting in a c er ta i n vibr atory manner. T his f orm or sta t e of vibr ation is harmonic in that the various fr e quencies of its chordal make-up are harm onic all y related; i.e. , by simple numbers and their mult iples {1} . This tight r e lati ons hip educes a “coming together” or calming, gathering or ce nt ralizing eff ec t . Any thing subjected to this vibration is caus ed to be calm, peac ef ul, togeth- er or in harmony. This is Love. I t is not simply a human emotion restricted to humans alone a s this eff ec t can be witnes sed in animals , plants, molecules and everywhere e l s e. One could think of Love as that which holds things together in a harmonic ( equilibrated) s t a te. An ana logy would be an orches tr a compos ed of 100 musical instruments. As long as the tones playe d are i n tune (har monic to e ach othe r ) the group can be together and play bea uti ful ha r monies or c oncor ds . Disc or d, on the other hand, c auses abe r ration, chaos , disrupti on and s cattering. T his is the polar opposite to harmony or Love which brings t hings together. Disc or d dr ives things apart in sepa r a- tion, alonenes s, is ol a t ion and despair. Rudolph Steiner sta t e d {2} in 1913: “The scienc e of the futur e will be ba sed on s ympathetic vibra- tion . ” H owever, he may not have realize d sympathetic v i br ation i s another way of saying Uncon- ditional L ov e as wil l be il lus tr a t e d her e in. Love has been the bas e of most religions, societies and famili e s f rom the dawn of time and acts as the foundation for the New E ra philos ophies. The world is no longer viewe d as separate mutually a nt a gonistic feudal s t a tes. T he r e i s a c om ing to- gether of all peoples whic h is e vidence of a greater degree of harmony ( love) between them than has bee n evidenc ed in the pa st. Unfor tunate l y sc ience and s ociety, in the wes tern world, has wan- dered f ar astray from this basic and most pow er ful of f orces . T his , however, is being reverse d by avante gua r d res earchers working across m a ny f ields of s cientif ic inve stigation f rom as t ronomy to z ool ogy. The existing bas e of previous res earch, cus toms, t raditions a nd the va r ious belief s ystems scat- tered a r ound the wor ld are nea r ly all founded on fear. Society ha s been taught fear from gene r a- tion to ge nerati on which is dis cor d and inevitably r e sulted in war and destruction of countries , cities , f amilies and individuals. Fear, we now know, is a r e sult of i gnorance or la ck of awarenes s of one’s self, r ela t ions and t e h Universe as a whole. It is the releas e of thes e fears which hinder the natur a l s tate of love, that is the hallm a r k of this s o- ca ll e d Ne w Age . I t is indeed an age of ide- as , i nformation and geometri c ally expanding awarenes s of self, each other and the Greater Cos- mos. It is this expande d awa r ene ss that is a n effect of the ever i nc r ea sing degr e e of s ympathy or harmony s eeping s o irrevocably i nto soc i e t y through its indivi dua ls.

T his means we know a thing by the vibrations c omi ng from it. A c ar m a y be red, blue or whateve r c olor . Color is a vibration and the only di fference be tween red or blue is the rate of vibration of the light. An object does not have a single f reeque ncy at which it na tur tally vibr a t e s. It has many vibr a t ion fr e quencies . T hes e rates of vibration ar e de ter - mined by it s s ize, mass , substa nce and environm e nt . Therefor e an object’s state of being, vibr a- tori ly s peaking, manifests as its chord of mas s or vibr ation signa t ure or t ha t c ol le ction of fr e- quencies of which it is made and therefor e is . When tuned t o a unison (concord or harm ony with the other object’s c hor d of vibration) t he vibr a t ions emitted by one obje ct are perf e ctly r e ceived and ass imi la t e d or unders t ood by the other. It is well known among mus i c ians t ha t proper ly tuned mus i c al ins t ruments will respond sympa- thetically to eac h other . Thi s happens when vibration r a t e s of strings are tuned at exact unis ons (unisons = one = same = harm ony = love) be t w een t w o or more instruments. Pluck or bow a finely tuned s tr ing on one instrument and other instrum e nts will res pond with the s ame note . The two individualized objects begin to r e sonate AS ONE ins tr ument with perf e ct ca dence and con- cordance. What were once s eemingly s eparate things (the two dis tant strings) a r e now intimately and dynamically c onnected vibr atorily at the i nne r mos t harmonics. The connecting li nk resonate s through the highe r harmonics and not the lower physic al f orm we sens ibly know as s ound vibr a- tions. What happens to one bec om e s an experience for both s i multane ously and inti ma t e l y - f rom within - a s an evoke d s ympathetic res ponse. Thi s spe cial kind of vibr ation is called a Sy mpathetic V ibr ation . This definition coincides per - fectly with tha t of Unconditional L ov e . Gene r a l ly cons idered love m e ans two or mor e pers ons experience life and each other as though they exis t as one unit res onating in unis on e ach acting concordantly upon and w i th the othe r . Sym pa thetically vibr ating s tr uctures means t w o or more objects vi brating as one unit res onating i n unis on each ac t ing conc or dantly upon or with the oth- er. Be cause s ympathetic vibration can and does conduct or convey energy suffi c i e nt to caus e mo- tion in a distant and se emingly s eparate object it is therefor e t a ken to be dynamic energy. Love radiating fr om one individual can a nd does move ot he r indi vidua l s . L ove , as sympathetic vibr a- tion, is ther e f ore a dynamic for ce . 3) T hi s S piritual Science was origin ally developed ( as f ar as we are conce r ned) mor e than 100 years ago in Philadelphia by J ohn Worrell Keely (1827- 1898) {1} . Redis covering and developing his or iginal work promi s es great be nef its for indivi dua ls a nd therefor e soc iety.

Cons equently one gr ows into a s ens e of be- ing ONE WI TH or AS ONE w i th C r e ati on a nd the Creator. This New Scie nce loves, respec ts and cooperates with Nature on a ll harmonic f requenc y levels becaus e this is the very ess ential nature of sympathetic vibrations. It doe s not arrogantly force natur e to address purpose s on s tr ict- ly the m a t e r ial or phys ical leve l.

These vibrations or standing waves all have nodes coinciding to the ver y inf i- nite center of the s phere and t o the mas s of t he shell. The tightness of this cente r ing of the node s is defined by the “Q” or degree of tuning of the var ious r es onators and vibr a t ory components of the m e chanism. Keely claimed the discovery of the Neutral C enter as hi s gr ea t e st achievement. A Neutral Center (similar in some w ays to Zero- Point) is that w hi c h is the self- identity of the mec hanism. I t is the veritable hea r t of the organism. I s ay organism becaus e the overall mecha ni s m is as a li ving or - ganis m in that it has combined as One the dynamic and mul ti-harmoni c energies of T e r restrial and Cele stial f orces . These are some t imes considered as male a nd female for c es. The male for ce s are us ed in conventional s cience and t e chnology almos t exclus i ve ly. The New Scienc es are be- ginning to work with vortices and implos i on which represe nt s the f emale side of natur e. The Dy- nas pher e works with both of the se plus the third Neutral s t a te being a deri ve d combination of the two. T he two pola r f orces come together in a pur e s t a te of s ym pa thetic vibration to form the Neutral C enter . It is from this ha r monic union of divine-like forces that r e newal or regeneration comes . T hrough this mecha nism may be developed and liberated f urther “life BE ing” propert ie s.
