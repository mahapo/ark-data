I t must be ac knowl- edged that there was warrant for this. It ha s be en a t various ti mes a nnounced t ha t Mr. Kee ly had overcome the diff iculties that environed him, had perf ec t e d his machinery, and was prepared to demons t rate its wor ka bl e powers . Yet this promi s e, on each occas ion, f ailed to be fulf illed; the outcome being that doubt grew general, and many people came to look upon Mr. Kee l y as a shrewd adventurer, and his motor a skillfull y devise d fr a ud. I t is t rue that this opinion is confined to pe opl e who have no persona l acqua int a nce w i th Mr. Keely's a chievements. It is not enter- tained by thos e who have had the opportuni ty to for m a well- founded opini on; the c apitalists who have s upplied M r.

The Ke ely motor has its history, and a relation of that history mus t precede des cr iption. M r . Kee ly is today a man of about seventy years of age, a se emingly robust, well-pr e served per s on, who m a y have many years of life s til l befor e him. For nearly a quarter of a century part a ll his tim e and attention have been given to the s tudy and development of the pow er he had previous l y discove r ed, a nd to whos e applica ti on he devoted hims elf with that unti ring energy which has marked inventors in all time, a nd through which so many of the m have overcome dis couraging obs tacles and achieve d s ucces s. The pa t hw ay of the present inventor has not been made as s mooth as many im- agine. He has enc ounter e d poverty, and be en s aved f rom ha vi ng the r oof s old over hi s he ad only by t he aid of a f aithful fr ie nd. I n thi s res pect hi s his tor y accords clos ely with tha t of many f a - mous inventor s in the pa st. During his earlier ca r ee r Mr. Keely was engage d in va r ious pursuits. H e wa s employed, f rom time to tim e , as a phys ician, a pharmacist, and in other oc cupations. B ut sinc e he was ten years of age he has been int e r es ted in the s tudy of tone s a nd resona nces ; of those rapid a nd inces sant vi- brations which underlie all we se e in t he world a r ound us, and to which all the energies of the acting univer s e ar e primar ily due. I t is this s tudy whic h he still continues , a nd the power which he has deve l ope d is claimed to come fr om a control of t he se vibr a t ions . Ma n has long used those vibr a ti ons a s pr oduce r s of powe r . In fact, there is no other s our c e of e n- ergy -- unles s gr avity has a dif ferent origin. His own body owes to them its powers of movement and sens ation. T he ste am- power which he employs i s but a utilization of the he at vibrations of the m ole cules of matter. T he electric e nergy which he is now coming to employ is a vibr ation of the ether a subtler form of s ubstance . L ight a nd radiant he at, which a l s o yield energy, are other modes of vibration of e t he r . M agnetism, - in its t urn, has to do with vi bratory motion. As regards the pr ac ti c al applica t ion of electricity, strenuous eff orts are now being made to use the electric vibrations immediate l y, ins tead of thr ough the intermedium of c hemical a ction or mecha nical fr iction, drawing t he se energies dir e ctly fr om natur e and employing them without the need of i n- termediate a gencies . T he energies named - - lights hea t , e l e ctr icity, etc . - - do not exha ust the vi- brator y activities of nature. T he r e are vast r ange s of vibr ation which lie betwee n thes e, and oth- ers f ine r and s ubtler than any of them; and ma n has yet tapped but a mi nor por tion of the vas t energies of the universe, the bulk of whic h are not to be reached by the gross methods hitherto employed. The e ner gie s ma ni fes ted in the vis ibl e ac t ivities of nature are therefor e but a fraction of thos e which are a ctive in the movements of ma t e r ial and e t he r ial parti c les, but which take no part in the movements of mas se s. How these deep lying ene r gies ca n be dir e ctly withdrawn from their s ecret lurking place s, and made t o move m a ss es of matter, i s a problem to which the atten- tion of ma ny is now be ing given, and to the elucidation of which M r . K eely has for many years devoted himself, with a see mi ng suc cess w hi c h place s hi s res earches far beyond those of his r e - cent competitor s . In s hor t, M r . Ke ely claims to have s ucces sfully ha ndl e d the pr oblem above named, that of dr aw - ing e ner gy dir e ctly fr om the e l e ments of nature. T he mysterious process by which he is enable d to a vail himself of these potent e ner gie s is his s ecret. He has kept it sedulous l y to hims elf , mak- ing his patrons famil ia r only with the results ; in whic h, i nde ed, they a r e chiefly interes t e d. I t is t o thes e res ul ts , theref ore, that our inquir y must be confined. As regards these there is a double sto- ry to t e ll , M r. Keely's resea r che s having led him to two dif ferent series of achieve ments. For many years he had at hi s c om ma nd an enorm ous pres sure, which he va inl y sought to make use f ul in the movement of machinery. But for a number of ye ar s pa st his res earches have led him in a diff erent dir ec t ion, a nd a f a r mor e prom is ing one so far as practical r es ults ar e conc er ne d. The ea r lier method, that of gas eous pr e ss ur e, first c alls f or c onsideration. Mr. Keely still retains , though he no l onge r uses , the apparatus i n which thi s pres sure was developed and ma ni fes ted. Thi s c onsists of a s m a ll but s tr ong cylindr ic al receiver, a lever whos e long arm is weighted with"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"pa ge 4 of 8 an ir on ball s aid to weigh five hundr ed and f ifty pounds , and a l ifting arrangement near the f ul- crum of this lever and conne cted by a t ube with t he gas c yl inder. The only materi a l employed in this apparatus is said to have been a f ew drops of water, intr oduce d into the cylinder. T he se Mr. Keely claims to be able to dec om pos e by vibrator y inf luenc es, a nd fur ther t o decompos e the re- sulting hydr ogen into its elements , the res ul t being a gas or ga ses of e xt raordinary expa nsive power. For this explanation of t he result we have M r. Keely's theory only. For the pr es sure devel- oped we ha ve a well-esta bl is hed fac t . This is that the gas confined within t he cylinder a nd con- necting tube is capa ble of lifting the weighted le ver , though the a dj us tment of the arms is such that this perfor manc e requires a pr es sure of over s eventeen thousand pounds to the square inch. The ac tual press ure, indeed, s eems to be much gr e ater than thi s , if , a s some observers state, a man weighing over two hundred pounds has added his weight to t ha t of the ir on ball without br inging down the lever. M r . Ke ely s t a tes that in some of his experim e nts a much gr e ater press ur e than here named ha s be en s hown, amounting in one ins tance to the enorm ous force of one hundred and ten thous and pounds to the s quare inch. That s uch an eff e ct ca n be pr oduc ed by the dis integr a t ion of a f e w drops of water s eems incon- ceivable . Yet the gase ous pr es sure here employed is perhaps much les s than tha t which is rea di ly obtained in the case of high explosives . T he immense rending powe r of dynamite a nd other re- cent explosives is due to the great expa nsion of the gas a r is ing fr om their sudden conversion into vapor. Could t his ga s be confined, its pr e ss ur e might prove to be m uc h greater than that a bove named. Its energy, however, has hitherto proved be yond the r e straining powers of any material, while t he gas e m ployed by M r. Keely a ppears to be within his control. T he mystery is that it is produced f rom wa t e r , and that no other inves ti ga tor has ever s eparated water into such highl y ex- pans ive gas es . T he charge ha s been m a de that Mr. Keely employed s ome s ecret r es ervoir of con- dens ed ga s, or other hidden source of power, but of t he hundreds of intelligent pe r s ons who have se en the experiment in question no one has been able to disc over anything of t he kind, though full opport unity f or i nve stigation ha s been offered. T wo able mechanicians , Mr. Barnet L e Van, a well-known e xper t in machine r y, and Mr. Li nville, a skilled electrician, have taken the appa r atus apart a nd exa m ined it thoroughly. Such men were not likely to be ea sily de ceived, and had a ny se cr e t attachme nt been pr e sent it would s carcely have esca ped their vigilant eyes . Yet they found everything a s repres ented, and have give n a wri tten stateme nt to that eff e ct. Mr. Keely has also fil le d the r ec eiver with w ater in the presenc e of inve stigators, emptied i t befor e their eye s, and immediately a f terward produced the r es ults above described. In truth, one ne eds but to s ee the apparatus to be s atisfied that the theory of a c oncealed r e servoir of gas is without foundation. What f ollowe d the di s covery of thi s vigorous power? T o demonstrate its lift ing energy w as one thing, to apply it for the move m e nt of machinery pr oved to be quite another . For ma ny years Mr. Keely sought to ac compl is h this des ider a tum , a nd for as many years f a i led. H e devis ed and con- structed engine af ter engine, dif ferent i n for m and principle, but e ach proved alike us eles s f or the purpose in view. The hidden giant steadily r e f us ed to be put to work. Over one hundred a nd twenty of these machines we r e built, each new one des igned to overcome s ome former diff iculty; again and a gain it was announced that the for ce was in harness ; and again and aga in disa ppoi nt- ment followed. Ye t the imprisoned gas was quite r e ady to manif e st its power. Holders of great strength exploded, wrecking the shop and inj uring the inventor.

Mr. Kee l y sta t e s t ha t one skilled m a chinist, a Mr. McPhers on, expr e ssly prepared a tube which he defi e d him to r e nd by gas pr e ss ur e. This tube wa s nearly s i x feet long, and thr e e inche s i n in- ternal diamete r , while its walls were three inches thick, the e xter na l diameter be i ng nine i nc hes. Its r es isting force was sixty-two thous and pounds to the s quare inch.

All ac t ing machinery mus t have se par a te parts, moving upon or within eac h other, and t he nece ss ar y joints or crevices proved fatal to his hopes . T he instant t he gas wa s admitted it slipped thr ough these and was gone. So s tood matters with M r . Ke ely until a few years ago, when, for tunately for his hopes of suc- ces s, a new conception came to him by accident, a s he as serts; one of those happy a ccidents, it would appear, which only men of t he unus ual ca pacity ca ll e d genius are r e ady to t a ke a dvantage of. Jus t what thi s c onception wa s, Mr. Kee ly, wit h busines s-like c aution, keeps to hims elf . The public, for the pres ent at leas t , mus t be content wit h its visible r es ults; but these are suff icie nt ly noteworthy to amply repay consideration. They indicate two things : Fir s t, that M r . K eely is no longer dea li ng with a power a r is ing fr om gase ous pr es sure; and, sec ond, t ha t he has made thi s power c apable of pr oduc i ng rotation, l e vi ta t ion, a nd other effects of mecha nical ene r gy. W hat he claims , i n regard to the s our ce of his new sys tem of pow er , is that he is able to draw vibr a t ory en- ergy directly f rom s pace by the aid of specia l resonating expedients , and that thi s e ner gy can be made to yield powerf ul attr ac ti ve and r e pulsive f orce and be conve r ted into vigorous r otary mo- tion through the use of ce r tain apparatus. The power obtained, he ass erts, is duplex, or has two oppose d conditions, like the positive a nd negative state s of electricity. Mr. Keely denomi na tes thes e conditions pos i tive and negative, though with the res er va ti on that thes e ter ms do not imply exce ss and defi c iency, but s impl y opposite conditions of energy. He is able, he de clares, to dis- turb the equili brium of t he se opposed sta t e s of vibr atory a ctivit y as they exist i n the elements of nature, to draw them s eparately into his apparatus, and to produce mechanical motion as a result of the eff ort of na tur e to res t ore the dis tur bed equilibr ium. Thi s s ounds like the language employed i n electrical t he or y; and, indeed, as ide from the f a ct that no evident s our ce of e l e ctr icity is pr es ent, there a r e close ana l ogies be tween t he action of electro- magnetis m and t ha t of the energy a ctive in t he Kee ly apparatus . Yet there is a co m plete abs ence of the usual mechanica l or chemica l agenc i e s f or the evolution of electri c al ene r gy. The only op- erative appli a nces to be s een a r e certain res onating arrangements , and the mystery remains dee p how these can yield force. T he se consis t of a n arrangement of slender rods or tongues of meta l , which succ ess ively dec r ea se in length, and which e vidently are set t o sound dif ferent not e s of the sc ale, and of a s pir a ll y-curved bugle- s haped appliance. In a ddi tion to thes e a tuning-f ork is em- ployed by M r . Kee ly when ready to set his machinery in m otion. Thus, s o far as is vis i ble , t he in- ventor's apparatus are in accordance with his theory of uti lizing the vibratory ene r gies of na t ure. The ques tion next in order is, w hat has M r . K eely to show in s uppor t of his claim that he is able to c ont rol a s upply of cos tless ene r gy and e mpl oy it in the movement of machinery ? The proofs of this which were s hown to me are two in number ; others wer e des cribed, but I ca n only speak personally of what I saw . T he f irst of these indicates but a minute employment of force, yet it is significant of strange i nfluence s. It cons ists in the motion of a magnetic needle, pivoted in a sma l l paper bow, a nd place d on a c yl indrical stand which wa s f illed with sma l l tubes. At a di s - tance stood a gl obular apparatus hereaft e r to be des cr ibed, a nd the globe a nd the upr ight stand were connected by a length of slender pl a t inum wir e . Mr. Keely stood be side the globe, s tr iking his tuning for k and applying it to the tongues of m e tal s ur rounding the base of the globe. After a"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"pa ge 6 of 8 few minutes the magnetic needle suddenly quiver e d, m ove d bac kwar d and f orward a s i f in re- spons e to the not e s employed, and in the e nd bega n to rotate. This movement continued for a cons ider a bl e time, the needle spinning rapidly a r ound on its cente r , and only ce asing when M r. Keely removed the box from the stand. Thi s may se em a tr ifling expe r iment; i t is, on the contrary, a signif ic ant and unusual one. The movements of the needle, in r es ponse to the notes s ounded, indicated tha t the power came fr om the gl obe , by the channel of the pla t inum wir e , and not f rom a ny apparatus conce aled in the sta nd. I t i s not the function of a magne t to rotate. No method is known by which suc h rotation can be pr oduce d in t he abs ence of mechanic al connec ti on. N o s uch conne ction exis ted in t his in- sta nce. T he only i nfluence which could procee d fr om the s tand, thr ough the paper- box, to t he needle, mus t have been one of attr a ction or repulsion; and s cience at pr es ent knows no method of making a nee dl e rotate unde r such circumstanc es as are he r e des cr ibed. N or does it appe ar that ordinar y magnetic attr ac ti on is at work, for the same r otation was produced when a s pl inter of wood-- the s tem of a match-- replace d the needle, with no trace of metal e xcept a coating of bronze-color e d s ubstance at t he ends . T his wa s ma de to r otate so rapidly as to become i nvis ible, and continued without cess ation until t he nee dl e - box wa s r emoved, w hen rotation could not be restored wit hout a r ene wal of the origi na l process . Keely states that on one occa sion t he rotation continued f or forty days . The other e xperi ment shown me was one muc h more likely to attract the attention of pr ac ti c al men, as indicating a much greater s upply of ene r gy. It is not easy to expla i n without a diagram, and I may not succ eed i n making it clear. I t employs, as its appa r ent source of power, the globe of which I have spoke n, which is externally of br as s, a nd of s ome eight or ten inc hes diameter. Thi s is plac ed on a s imple s tand and surrounded a t bottom with t he arrangement of vibr ating tongues mentioned, while near its apex is a s mall bugle-like a ppendix, curved in a s pir a l , w i th the m outh of the bugl e opening outward. Some ten or fif tee n feet di s tant from this sphere stood another and mor e complicated apparatus. Thi s w as in two par ts . One was an upright bras s cir c l e of three f e et diameter, the f a ce of t he cir- cle being s everal inc hes in width. T hrough thi s , at intervals , were ins er te d metallic di s ks or s hor t cylinders of peculiar formation, which pas se d through the thickness of the brass , and protruded fr om it s oute r and inner surf a ces. Thes e- -s eventeen in number- -were connected by w i res around the i nne r circle of the ring Within this brass c i rcle, but having no connection with it, was a wheel, or rather a hub, with a s e- ries of r a diating s pokes r e aching within t w o- and- a- ha l f inches of the i nne r surface of the ring, but now her e coming i n contact with it. T his a ppar a t us turns fr ee l y on a fixed a xl e . I t is t hus c om- pletely i s olated, both from the surroundi ng ri ng and f rom a ny for c e that mi ght be br ought t o bear on a movable axle. It is apparently i nc apable of moti on except thr ough a pr opelling f orce applied directly to t he s pokes or the hub. T he spokes terminated near the disks , but as they were one les s in number than the latter, no more than one could, at any time, stand dir e ctl y under a disk. Such i s , bri e f ly described, the arr ange ment: the br as s circle with its di s ks; the rimless inner wheel which hung loose on a fixed axle; and the dis tant bras s gl obe , with its r e sonating applianc- es . A length of platinum wire, of about the thicknes s of a knitt ing needle, pas se d fr om the globe to the ring, wher e it w as connected with one of the disks. Such was the apparatus, w hi c h s t ood motionless during the f irst hour of my vi s it. Mr. Kee l y now appr oa ched t he globe, took up the tuni ng for k, and manipulated, in va r ious ways , the f ork, the vibrating tongue s, and the globe. After s ome minutes had pas sed in thes e proces se s the wheel s uddenly started, moved s lightl y, a nd immediately af terward began to r ota t e . No fur- ther manipulation seeme d nece ssa r y.

T he natural impress ion would be, f rom its comparatively slow motion, and the eas e of r otation of a w heel turning on a l oos e sleeve, tha t the f orce was slight. Mr. Kee l y, how ever, declares that this is an err or, that the wheel exerts the s ame force whether moving fas t or s l ow , and that when m a king but one revolution in f ive minut e s i t has broken ropes whos e powe r of resis t a nce w as two and-a-half tons , and has c ont inue d to revolve deliberately a s though it had e ncounter e d no opposition.

T he mode of stopping the m a chine w as as curious as it s s tarti ng. M r. Keely s imply pulled a piece of wire of a f ew inch- es in l e ngth fr om an a per ture in one of the dis ks, and the wheel ins tantly ce ased tur ning, though no hand had touched it . How is t his phe nom e non to be explaine d? Press ur e was out of the question, since the r e volvi ng wheel was abs olutely is ol a t e d, except f rom the axle. B ut no pow er applied t o the axle c oul d have aff e cted it, s ince the latter wa s f irmly fixed, and the whee l hung free, turning on a loos e s leeve that w as slipped f reely on the axle. The e xpl a nation, t he r e f ore, of hidden springs, s kil lfully de- vise d s ystems of wires under the f loor, moved by the inventor 's foot, concea l e d machinery etc. , fails t o meet the requirements of this pr oblem, s ince the movement was an i s olated one, and no suc h mecha nical force c ould have been br ought to bea r on the loosely hung whe el. T hat electrici- ty w as not the power employed was show n by a s ensitive galvanometer, connected with the wheel, a nd remaining unaffected by its motion. Mr. Kee l y explains the phenomenon a s f ollows . He c laim s tha t the m otion is due to attr ac ti on and pr opuls ion (or repulsion) exe r ted by the disks on the s pokes of the r otating r ing. He sa ys t ha t thes e dis ks ar e \"s ens i tize d, \" or rendered alter na t e ly attractive and repulsive by energy drawn fr om the ethe r of surrounding spa ce by means under his c ontr ol, and conveyed fr om t he globe along t he wire t o the dis ks. Of t he s eventeen disks , ni ne , he s ays, a r e polar in their action, eight depolar. T he ac t ion of the pol a r disks on t he s pokes is attr ac ti ve ; that of the depola r disks, pro- pulsive (or r e pul s ive). T here being but sixteen spokes , only one can be at any time directly unde r a disk, and the res ult of the dif ferential ac ti on of the attr ac ti ve and pr opuls ive dis ks, due to their diff erence in num be r , is a stea dy and continuous r otation. This r otation, acc or ding to M r . Kee ly, can be susta i ne d indefinitely without c ost or need of f urther attention af te r the c ondi tions are once produced; is powerful enough to do wor k needing gr e at ene r gy; and is s o s i mple in its man- agement that no spec ial intelligence is r e qui red to handle it. I t can be us ed f or a ny kind of wor k, as for a street c ar motor ; is devoid of da nger ; and c annot get out of order. I des ir e the r ea der to be ar in mind t ha t much of what i s a bove s aid is given on the authori ty of Mr. Kee l y' s s tatement. I have s t a ted on my own author ity only what I actually saw. This much may t ruly be s aid, however, that during the many years of Mr. Keely's expe r iments his workshop has bee n visited by a multitude of e xper ienc ed mec hanics and ot he r s , to whom the expe r iments above des cr ibed and many others have been shown, and there is no testimony e xtant that any one of them has discove r ed evidence of fr a udulent operations. The \" sens iti z ed\" disks employed by M r . Ke ely in t he method jest described, ca n, as he s tates, be use d to pr oduce many striki ng instanc es of levitation. One of these experiments is the following: A cylindr ica l glass ve ss el, f orty- two inches high, containing a number of ir on weights of se ver a l pounds eac h, i s filled w i th water, and covered with an iron lid. On this i s plac ed a sma l l metallic disk, \" sens itized, \" while a plati num wire conne cts the cove r with the f orce-producing a ppar a t us . The attraction exert e d by the dis k caus es the weights to rise in the water, some of them res ting midway, others apparently floating on the top, at the w i ll of the ope r a t or. As regards this e x- periment, all I s aw was a series of photographs showing the we i ghts a t various heights i n the j a r . Yet it appea r s to have be en frequently witnes sed. O n two occas ions, as M r . Ke ely s t a tes, an ob- se r ver r emove d the disk f rom the top of the jar, when the sus pended weights instantly f ell, cras h-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"pa ge 8 of 8 ing through the bottom of the glass c yli nde r . He claims to be able to make the weight move at his will, stopping at any height in the wa t e r he ple ases , and pass ing eac h other a s t he y move up and down thr ough the wa t e r . In othe r wor ds , he states that he c an produce spec i a l action in the cas e of ea ch s eparate w eight, and control its movements in t he wate r . The inventor c l a im s to be a ble to per form s ur prising f e ats of levitation by t he aid of these s ensi- tized disks, s uch as lif ting obje cts of gr e at weight f rom the floor to any desired height without contact. He is als o able, he sa ys, by sounding c ert a i n combinations of notes on a s or t of mouth instrument, to affect t he molecular vi brations in a thick pi e ce of plate glas s in s uch a manner as to de stroy its cohes ion and shiver it to impalpable dust. A f riend t e ll s me that he s aw a s uppor ted globe m a de to r e vol ve by the s ame me ans, it r es ponding in cur ious s ympathy to the notes as they varied in pitch and combination. Mr. Kee l y is at pres ent pa r ticularly enga ged on a l a r ge and complicated pie ce of m a chinery which he c alls t he propellor of an air -s hi p, a nd whos e purpos e is s uf ficiently indicate d by i ts name. It is s uppli e d with three \"res onator s , \" or broad shee t s of t hin metal, each se t to a particular pitch, and each playing s ome part in the mys teri ous proces s of \"drawing power from spa ce. \" In addition a r e sundry di s k-shaped and ot he r apparatus, the whole ar range m e nt being hi ghly com- plex. The inventor doe s not claim t ha t this machine is ye t in w or king or der. He declares that, if his remaining experiments prove s atisfactory, he w i ll be a bl e to m a ke it f loat in the air , a t any de- sired height, and with suffi c i e nt lift ing power to carr y a l a r ge number of pe opl e , and conve y them a ny required dis t a nce. To the eye of the layman, how ever, ther e is nothing but t he inert ma- chine. A demonstration of i ts powe r s and poss ibili ties mus t wait on the completion of the inven- tor's studies and experim e nt s . T he world a t large, with creditable caution, will not be ready to be- lieve it can f loa t until they actually s ee it floating. Such i s , bri e f stated, wha t I have s een a nd have been told of the famous Keely motor. Mr. Kee l y does not claim to be at the e nd of his rese ar c hes, though he doe s c laim the abili ty to do mechani- cal work with the rotating apparatus I have des cribed, ther e only r emaining the minor tas k of a t- taching a pulley to it, and ther e by conve yi ng its f orce to mac hi ne r y. He explains his prese nt stat- us to be the f ollowing. During the past years he has issue d s tock and other obligations to numerous persons who have a ided him i n his r e searches . Before ta ki ng any steps to m a ke his in- ventions public he wis hes to know just how he stands in r ega r d to thes e obligations . He ha s, therefor e, is sued a r eque st tha t all holde r s of s tock s hall registe r their claims in a se l e cted trust company, and would like, if a vailable, to replace thes e va r ied obligations wit h a single series of new obligations. Not unt il thi s bus iness diffi c ult ly is in s om e way overcome does he propose to do anythi ng toward putting his inventions in pr ac t ic al operation. * T he r e ver s e counter pa r t of gravitati on; se e R eview of \"A Journey in Other Worlds,\" by J ohn Ja cob As tor ."}]
