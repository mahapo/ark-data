E xplan ation Thi s ne w power and light generator employs a multi- plication principle of nature which has not ye t entered within the realm of human cons ciousnes s, jus t as the principle of e l e ctr onics or atomi c ene r gy had not en- tered huma n cons ciousnes s f ifty ye ar s a go. I t is more impor ta nt than e lectroni c s i s , however, for it opens the door to a new er a in hi ghe r electronics, higher mathematics and tr a nsmutation. It is the principle of gr ow t h in na t ure which multiplies one kernel of corn int o thousands , or which mult iplies gas es of minus zero melting points into solids of over 3000째; or m ultiplies the cold of s pace into hot stars and novas of incredibly high t e mper a t ure.

Another reas on it has never bee n known is becaus e of our wrong c oncept of t he r modynamics which places heat as the basis of ene r gy instead of cold, of which heat is it s s ole product, and the c onsequent law of en- tropy which pr ovides no uphill flow of e ner gy to ba l - ance its downward flow, as fully evidenc ed in every wave and in every gr owing body of na t ure. Power multiplication is the most c onspicuous cha r ac - teristic of natur e . I t is amazing to me that it has neve r yet been dis covered, nor has the nature of l ight, the ONE THING of the universe, be en dis covered. For this r e ason the optic nature of matter has not bee n dis- covered. If it ha d been, our r es earch l a bor atories would not make such pr imitive coils as those in cur- rent us e e ver yw her e . Att a ched t o this letter is a draw- ing s howing how coils should be w ound to divide light into pa ir s , but a coil of one s ection is like one wheel of a pulley which has but a fr a ction of the pow- er it could have by adding another, and still a not he r wheel, or t ha t a lar ge whee l would be able to impart by geari ng a smaller, slower m oving wheel to it.

It will he l p to comprehend nature's optical method of power multiplication by pointing out t he violations of nature w hi c h the pr e sent dynamo makes us e of . Nature's fir s t principle of pow er producti on and the cons tr uction of matter is to produce heat f rom the cold of spac e. T he heat thus generated radiates ba ck into cold to complete the wave cycle which automati- cally r e peats itself in thi s a geless universe of an infi - nite c onti nuity. Ever y wave is a pe r fect dynamo, but the very purpose of wave s i s to generate heat in its ar matures at wave amplitude points . T hat is the only way w aves create matter. Carbon, for example, is the a mpl itude element of its octave. Its melting point is 3600째 centigrade. Ever y sun in the heavens is flaming ca r bon, and every sun is the a r mature of it s dyna mo- wave . The pres ent dynamo ignor es this bas ic fact complete- ly. It cools its arm a tur e by laminating it.

This e n- tir e universe is a var ied meas ur e of the heat of mo- tion. T his entire w ave unive r s e is a varied mea sure of heat and motion. Long low waves of low heat pot e n- tial c onstitute the invisible l ight spec t rum, while short high w aves of high he at potential and low f requenc ies cons ti tute the vis ible s pectrum.

Are not all a i r and ele ctr ic curr e nt s s eeking equili bri- um of pr es sures ? Is not the di rec t ion of all c omposing things always the direction of gravitation? Does not thi s direction cor res pond with the we l l known electric effect w hi c h tends to shorten a line in the di rec t ion of its length by pull ing inward fr om within? Ca n there be any ques t ion that this is the direction of the generative force? Ca n there be any ques t ion that the opposite dir e cti on is the direction of degenerative f orce? St r iat ions It s eems evident that the unive r s e is divided int o high and low press ure zone s wherever any active f orce takes plac e. It is inconceivable that par t of the unive r s e is imbued with the for ce of motion a nd part of i t is iner t. Wherever any ac ti on of for c e take s pl a ce a diff e r enc e of press ure immediately develops and r uns its cycle. In the heavens great spiral whirl- pools a r e demon- strating tha t low pres sure cold areas c over ing hun- dreds of light yea r s are generating into high pr e ss ur e vorti c es with conde nsing focal centers. The s pir al nebulae such as that i n Perseus , or our own Milky Way, give energy evide nce of f lowing i n dou- ble streams centripetally toward and ce ntr ifugally away fr om f oc al cente r s . Do these awes ome ga l a xial effects of motion diff e r in any way from the same actions and r e actions caus ed by an elec tr ic curr ent pas sing through a wire? Let us cons ider this. Pass a n elec t ric curr ent thr ough a wir e pas sing through your right hand toward your left a nd what will happe n. Loops of f orce will circle ar ound that w i re in an anti- clock-wise direction. These loops are not li ke continuous cylinders of for ce , they ar e divided i nto whirl ing buttons or discs s epar- ated f rom e ach ot he r in ac cor da nce w i th the force of the cur rent. The whirling buttons are high pr e ss ur e striations which can be made visible as whirli ng bands of light by enclosing the wire i n an evacuated tube. The s paces betwe en thes e but tons are low pres sure a r - eas . The nucle al cente r where the wire pas se s i s a l s o the high pres sure point or gravitation center of each stria- tion and the edge of each disc is i ts low pr e ss ur e zone. What are thes e stri a ti ons ? What caus es them? Is not the ef fect of electric gr avitative, ge ner a ti ve ac- tions evident in shortening a line of f orce in the dir e c- tion of its length? Ever y action of f orce se ems t o register its repeative striations in octave harmonics. Is it not quite pr oba bl e that thi s s olar s ystem is but a striation, a whir ling button of for ce , spinning a r ound the l ine of direction of t he elec tr ic curr ent of which our s un is the hi gh press ur e nuclea l center?

Might ther e not be countles s other buttons of for ce whirli ng around that curved direction? If so what is happe ning in s pace as a r e sult of i t? Let us cons ider this. Pass a current in t he manner i ndic ated in diagr a m No. 1 t hrough a s tr aight wir e and parallel loops of for c e result. In nature an ele ctr ic line of force cannot travel in a straight line beca use of the c ur vature of pr e ss ur e gra- dients surrounding all m a ss es and be cause of res i s - tance. In Nature then we get the effect i ndica ted in diagr a m No. 2. What happens ? A high press ur e point de velops at the point marked X which becomes the gr a vi ta t ive center of many s ys- tems and gr adua ll y abs or bs them all. Thi s s eems to be nature's acc umul a ti ng process of condens ation. If we pass a curr e nt through a coiled wire, s ur round- ing a bar of steel, the bar will s uspe nd itself a t its high press ur e core. If we pass a strong c ur rent through a hea vy s pi rally coiled wir e suc h a high pres sure will develop a t its center that a bar of s teel w i ll become r e d hot a nd its energy wil l r a diate into the low pr e ssures outs i de of the coil. Is thi s not exactly akin to t he high pr es sures generated in the sa me manner in our s un and in our plane ts? Is not our s un the high press ur e nuclea l cente r of our striation? Is not the coiled wire wit h a central elongate d bar fol- lowing the line of hi gh press ur e exac tl y analagous to the sphere whose every loop of gravitative force c on- verges to a meeting point at i ts ce nter in mutually at- tractive lines , and whose r a diati ve for c e diverges radi- ally in mutually repellant l ine s? Is not the generative direction the inductive dir ec t ion of greates t hea t ; and c onversely i s not the direction of cold t he exa ctly opposite or conductive direction? If these facts are c or rect then doe s it not nec ess ar ily foll ow that t he direction radiation l e ads is t ow ar d the condens ing zone s of cold a nd low pr es sure? If this i s true then the dir e ction that ge nerates conden- sa ti on must be a way from cold towar ds he at. Heat leads to cold and tur ns bac k aga i n to he at in a never ending cyc l e .
