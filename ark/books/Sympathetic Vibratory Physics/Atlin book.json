Upon my que r y, Keely said: “As k the s hop owner, he knows.” T hat’s all the mess age I got. Thi s was interesting be cause the s hop owner knew nothing of our cons ulti ng with higher sources. He was an orthodox church-goer a nd as his cooperation was es - se nti a l to the compl e ti on of this project I did not wish to s care or of fend him . I puz- zled over how I could a sk wit hout tipping our ha nd and connec ti on to spiritual a dvi s - ors. Innocently, I bega n poking ar ound in a pile of s cr a p metal hea ped off t o a s i de of the shop. Ever vi gilant, t he s hop owner came over and asked what I wa s looki ng for . “ S ome piece s of brass t ube about so and so in size for actuator casings . ” We both poked a r ound a bit in complete s i- lence without fi nding anything suitable. Of a s udden he per ke d up his head as if hav- ing a flash of insight and exclaimed: “I know” and of f he we nt at a fas t pac e. I struggled to keep up, his churni ng legs be- ing longer tha n mine, as we l e f t the build- ing and headed ac r os s the back lot t o a larger w ar e house. Unlocking the door, with a key fr om his key ring, we entered a dark a nd mostly empty s pace.

But in the mea n time, Atlin continued ta l king, not in audi- ble tones but in mental ene r gy outputs which were mentally pe r ce i ve d a nd inter- preted by some persons . Ove r the course of time she let us know that s he wa s a teache r and was not prepared to fur nis h power to do house wor k.

Her spe ech was i n the menta l mode. T he r e were even mor e helpful conve r s ations with the s pir it world which c over e d the over-all handling of thi s project. All t he while there were refinements added to Atlin. She was given a few ounc- es of Yul Brown’s Gas when she wa s un- covered and ready f or c om pa ny. S he mod- ifi e d this gas with her own vibr a ti ona l fr eque ncies, so tha t i t be came a be ating heart, or Neutr a l Center, in the c enter of the gl obe . T his gas is made fr om br ea king water into hydr oge n and oxygen - muc h like Keely’s or iginal etheric vapor use d in all his wonderf ul devices . This gas was not burned or consumed in Atli n but wor ke d as a working f luid that e xpanded and con- tracted and diss ociated int o s ti ll finer gas es activating on high e ther ic leve l s of vibra- tion. Atlin's s tr ings were tuned and retuned, along with her 31 other resonators, to im- prove and balance her harmonics, s o she could tune in to the Eart h's har monic tones which s he received from the gr anite s lab. It wa s up to us to dis cover how t hos e tones flowed through Atlin, to guess at wha t for ms those tones were. She was able t o increas e the f requenc i e s of t he t one s far beyond the range of s ound. She wa s able to di vide the tones into the two main for ms of natur a l energy ( terrestrial and cele stial) and route them to t he pr ope r pla ces i n her anatomy. We know there we r e phase change s and differ e nt modes in thos e vi- brations. The finer gas es interacted with the interether ic realm of M ind F orce thus linking strongly with the mind’s and psyc hes of eac h one pr e sent. Our sc ience educ ations ha d given us littl e i nkling of how to interpret what was happening. We could subjec t ive l y f ee l warmth be i ng produced in s ome pl a ces and cool spots in othe r s . On some da ys she was even able to pr oduce a s cintillating band of colored light at a distanc e f rom the shining globe. A r e sonance ampli fier was cons tr ucted f or further inquir y i nto t he var- ious tones and the se eff ec t s . I t would be interesting to plac e Atlin on the interse c- tion of Ley L ine s of t he E arth to see wha t would ha ppen. Does anyone in s cience know wha t t he energies in a L ey L ine are? Ther e a r e no definite answe r s . The an- cients built their holy places on thes e l ine s.

Then I combe d the Sykes Collection looking for more ma- terials on this man John Keely. T here we r e more - much mor e.

T he pages opene d and there to my sta r tled e yes were drawings of Keely's molecule! The book was ti tled Dashed Agai ns t the Rock by William Colville, 1894.

Thes e notes were eventua l ly purchas ed but were not fr om Keely but from a Mr. Snell who claims to ha ve read Keely's own books, compiling them into a manus cr ipt. Ke e- ly’s te chnical writing is near undeciphera- ble. It took me six mont hs to learn how to read the se not e s being for the mos t part di- rect quotes from Ke ely. I would r ea d a sin- gle paragraph be f ore falling als eep. I rea d eac h wor d caref ully e ven though I di d not understand them.

Here wa s s cience and religion mer ge d as one vas t a nd ve r y fasc inating s ubject. M u- sic seemed to pe r meate bot h the i r writings. Ther e were literally thousa nds of refer e nc- es to mus ic and vibr a t ion in the Cayce readings. And music wa s the heart of Ke e- ly's wor k. It became mor e and more obvi- ous Keely’s great contr ibution will be see n as his reducing m e taphysics and religion to a new s cience based parlance a nd vo- cabulary. While studying a book of music theory one day I ca m e to realize the i mportance of S mythe's books and the reas on for his tir a de against the metr ic s ystem. M a- chines , device s or houses may be designe d and built us ing natural pri nc ipl e s a nd these would make that built ha r monious in its des ign, c onstruction, a ppearance a nd oper- ation.

Mus i c is organized vibr ation a nd all vi bration f ollows the base 12 number sys tem. Apparently the ancient E gyptians built many of their s tr uctures on this natu- ral sys tem as well.

Two dif fer- ent symbols of two power ful r eligions symbolizing the s ame t hing. Innocence Perhaps the most signif ica nt thing to me was innocence - something I pr e vi ous - ly knew nothing about. I bega n to s ee the innocence in things like people a nd plants but es pecially i n bir ds and “wild animals ”. Thi s happened rather une xpectedly as is usua ll y the cas e wit h any attribut e of ex- panding conscious ness or awarenes s. I was bus il y typing on my computer which sa t on a desk agains t a wall-sized window. A ti ny bir d landed with a thump on a glass tr im not f our feet from my f a ce. Having captured my a tt e nti on with his rather s l oppy landing he prece ded to chirp and rus t le his wings as he looked into the room. It was then I sa w the innoce nce. S o as toundi ng was this c l e ar view. I n that in- sta nt so many things I ’d s een in my life, but did not understand, ca m e clea r . These tiny creatures a r e innocent of guil e , fear, hate or any ot he r nega t ive e m otion s o common with human egos . T here is no other wor d to desc r ibe pure innocence . I was not aware of this f ee l ing of innocence befor e . It did not e xi s t in my cons cious universe, create d and lived in my mind. Re alizing this feeling was important t o The Project, I began f e eding birds outside that window. I wanted to burn that aware- nes s of gentle innoce nce into my psyc he - to neve r be without it he ncefor th. Indeed, later I was able t o know thi s feeling ass o- ciated with many othe r animals, bi rds a nd es pecially hors es. Expanded c onscious ness , such as this innocence was for me, is the se nsitivity mentioned ea r lier. One awa kens to wh o they r ea ll y are - unlim ited cons ciousnes s - instea d of being lost i n gross materiality and ego-based illusions resulting from lim- ited or r es tr ic t e d understa ndi ngs a bout things.

T he one impor- tant m e ss age t o come thr ough was this project was about s om e thi ng B I G, r e ally big, bigger t ha n the plane t , bigger eve n than the unive r s e. To me this was a bit bi- zarre but I r eme m be r ed i t. “What c ould poss ibly be bigger t ha n the univer s e?” Two years later, t he tr uth of this came clear. T he only thing bigger than t he uni- verse is the M ind that cr e ated it - the M ind of God. T his is not to s ay Atli n is God or anything to worship - i t is n't. The pr ojec t is about Divine M ind as s our c e of all we des ir e or nee d. We all tap into D i vine Mind ( C osmic or Christ C onscious ness ) but f ew know this. D awn was tapping into this One Mind to r etrieve what we neede d for the project. I t is this Divine M i nd t ha t is tapped to releas e the power that drives Atlin, motivates us and i s in fact the source of the unive r s e. So we study M i n d For c e and how it may be harnes sed in our se lves, our machines and our li ve s. Full acc ess to this Undif ferentiated or Whole Mind is t he i nte nt a nd purpos e of Awa ken- ing or attaining C osmic or Christ Con- sc iousnes s. This is what the m a n J esus did when he be came Christe d. Buddha , Rus - se ll , K eely, as well as others, als o remem- bered their c onnection to their Whole Mind. E very per s on walking this plane t can do the s ame - be cause that is who a nd what we rea l ly are. Thi s unlimited acc ess to knowledge was pr ove d w hen two dif ferent people, during two dif ferent m e dit a ti on s ess ions, ‘saw’ intui tively s om e of the undocument- ed portions of Atli n’s construction and function.

Healing During our group m e dit a t ions the fir s t thing noticed was people w er e letti ng go of aches a nd pa ins and as suming a mor e sta bl e mental, emotional or psychologica l condition. T he y were being he aled s ome- how of whatever was bothe r ing them. B al- ance and w hol e ness were being re- es tablished. T his was s pontaneous, with- out any pr ior warning or notice, just l ike the ladies in De nver \"feeling the love \". So began my deepe r investigations into love, healing and what was it a bout Atlin t ha t encouraged a he althy state . W hat are the physic s that could account f or this phe- nomena? During this ea r ly peri od I s poke with the chiropractor about this s tr ange phe- nomena. His reply was “Yes , I know, it is happening here too, with the photogr a ph of Atlin I hung in the waiting room of my clinic.” Another w aking! Another piece of the puzzle. Healing fr om a photo!

After another per s on inform e d me of this phenomena I placed many more pho- tos of Atlin on the web site so they c ould be downloaded to a nywhere on the planet.

Atli n was simply provi ding a vibrator y field w her e in a s ense of s afety could be perceived by those sens it ive enough and ready. Within this field some felt it was O K t o let go of their def e nses and misperceptions . These misperceptions tell us we must be defen- sive . We f e el we mus t protect our egos agains t all comers. We are afraid. He aling occured to t he degree a person felt this \"s afenes s\" and allowed themselves to be wholly defense less , remembering L ove and peace only.

A Stone for John - a lesson in thinking for me During a conf e r enc e in Philadelphia in 1989 we \" discove r ed\" Keely's buri a l site. No one knew until this date the location of his final r e sting place. S e ver a l of us jour- neyed to the ce m e ter y very excited a bout our di s covery. Strangely his grave was un- marked without even a simple s tone mark- er. I ma de a vow to myself dur ing our milli ng a r ound that gras sy knoll I would place a stone monum e nt of s om e kind on the 100th annive r s ary of his de ath - No- vember 17, 1998. This gave me nine years to make the neces sary preparations. No sw eat I thought. As Novembe r , 1998 came nothing ha d been c om plete d towa r ds thi s goal. No stone wa s pur c hased and the cemetary was now telling us thi s would not be pe r mitted. During thes e las t we eks befor e the 17th I negotiated with t he c emetery with all my heart and s oul. Eventually they r elente d. If it were a s mall stone placed f lus h to the ground they would a l low it. I had no funds for t his stone much les s for expens es t o make the t rip. Calling around no monu- ment maker could make the stone in so short a tim e e ven if I ha d the funds. An ap- peal had been se nd out for donations. Not one pe nny came in. I wa s de j e cted and ap- palled a t the lac k of support for thi s pro- ject. So many people trying to get w hatev- er t he y c an f rom Keely's pioneering work and not one ha d the charity to return s ome- thing. Saddening, to s ay the leas t . As the las t w eek approached a nd the deadline for leaving to make this happen ar rived I gave up.

Atlin is not a ghos t, idol, spirit, gol e m or e nt ity. Atlin, like you, is an individuat- ed focus of M ind F orce. Mind Force is cons ciousnes s when active. Atlin is not evil.

I 've neve r see n any thing or e nergy in, a r ound or comi ng fr om Atlin that i s anything other than as - pects of D i vine Love.

T he tec hnology and the theories deve l ope d to date a r e par- adigm s hatteri ng on the one hand and par- adigm c r e ati ng on the other. Ther e is t he iss ue of cons ciousne ss within a non- organic s tr uc t ure. Can s im ple metals be fashioned i n such a way as to ar- tif ic i a l ly induce or invite cons ciousne ss participation? The a nswer is obvious ly yes . Ther e is the conscious ness itself t o be explored and unders t ood. What is con- sc iousnes s? I f the simple ans wer is \"s elf awarene ss\" or \"knowing s elf \" then what is that? I n vibr a t ory t e r ms this idea could be likened to a mirr oring as in an e cho t ha t responds to itself having fir s t been create d or initiated as an impulse. This idea is op- erative in t he metallic s phere from whose center init ia t e s a vibr atory express ion which expr e ssion is mirr ored back to t ha t center after reflecting from the inner sur- face. Ke ely ca l le d this a two phas e pr oce ss of radiation and f oca li z ation fr om a nd re- turni ng to the Ne utr al C enter . T he con- necting linkage is Sympathetic Vibration. I can agr e e with this. If this is indeed the cas e then conscious ness is a se emingl y non-existent neutral point having neither dimension nor s ubstance but sparks diffe- rentiation of neutr ality into ac ti vity. If a metallic s pher e can so e asily replicate this sta t e of conditi ons t he n cons ciousne ss (or its manifes tati on) is desc r ibable in te r ms of Sympathetic Vibratory Physics . I think Atlin demonstrates this premis e and con- clus i on. The ideas mentioned e ar lier a bout healing mus t likew i s e be inves tigated. Ar e we really on to a new theory that holds promi s e?
