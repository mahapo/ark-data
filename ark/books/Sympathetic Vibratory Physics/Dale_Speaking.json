Part Two Since a long time ago I've wor ke d with the idea Far a day called the gl oba l noos phere ( the global cons ciousnes s) and that as I enhanc ed my cons ciousnes s tha t ef fort enhanced the whole con- sc iousnes s. S o if I ca n encourage others to enhance t he ir s m ine too is enhanced. I t works in both directions ( reciprocally). In the quote fr om A. M i c hael; \"attune your will w i th the Cr eator's Wil l\" . T he Creator's Will, to me, is discernible through obs ervation of one's envir onme nt to what is going on. What is going on is L IFE being what it is - the express ion of God's Will. B ut als o w hat is going on is the eff ec ts of humanity's Will a s everyone goes a bout being and living the i r l ive s. \"What, the n, is the purpos e of the entity's acti v it y in the consc iousnes s of mind, matter, s pi r it in the pres ent?

H e who ask s this, know s not what he asks ; for w ere the pr ayer answ ere d, life hencefor th for such an one would be a w eary round, as Hamlet say s: \"to-morr ow and to-mor row and to- m orrow br i ngs in this wear y r ound of lif e \"; for, having see n the glory of this immortal E GO, all else se ems so base , so commonplace and me an, s o inglor i ous , that oftentimes the per sonality has utter ly c ol laps ed whe n thr own back from the r adiant vis ion of this glor i ous immortal entity poss ess ed by all alike , though s carc ely dr eamed of by any save the very few who, dis contented with the ignorance and emptines s of terr ene exis t e nce, as pire to know the great r ealit y of the supe rnal.

This Spi rit, embodied in the pe opl e , is truly e xt raordinary in t e r ms of gene r os it y, creativity, livelines s, industry, charitable, helpf ul and the l ike . Inspite of all the r e strictions placed upon us as a people by c onspirator ial age ndas, devalued curr e ncy, false t reaties , fas cist laws and all the res t this s pi rit still lives . I t is but a sleep for the most par t. How ever it is awaken- ing in direct pr oportion to the tr oubles and dif ficulties accumulating upon us. T his s pi rit is the sa me s pir it that a ctuates everyone everywhere. America had an advantage in its youth of devel- oping without lim itations which fr ee d that spirit in w ays not pos sible in older mor e \"in the rut\" countries tied down by traditions, c ul ture, etc. I nteres t ingly this spiri t is being aw akened wor ld- wide by Amer ic ans. N ot by their government which apparently s eeks to damp that spiri t. Amer i- cans are leading the c har ge so to spe ak in awake ni ng the m s elves and all who s eek to foll ow . None are more s ensitive t o lost freedoms and de nied rights than Americans becaus e we have had a taste of f reedom mor e s o t ha n others .

I t is not that Ame r icans are so great. They are j us t people. It is the Spiri t, liberated from restraints of l iv- ing the past, that is great. And this S pirit knows no political, religious or cultur a l bounda r ies . It is a global human thing and it is awake ni ng. America's Soaring Prison P opulat ion 2003, 08/19 I've interviewed a few people who've s pent time on the inside of this nightmar e .

I can say this becaus e during Atlin's con- struction and the construction of thes e two now under c onstructi on work has be en stopped in its tracks eve r y time I got out of that peaceful, loving s tate of mind and heart. The las t time wa s the ring pol is hing disas ter I s hared with everyone. The work s i mply will not proceed like the time I tri e d to open Atlin on stage in De nver. Ca n't happen. N ow, I'm not completely sure why this is so. On the one hand it s ounds like there is an outs i de f orce guidi ng t he ir c onstruction. But we are it - so tha t is not true. I f we f ollow the idea our minds a r e the sa m e mind as God's mind the n we get a whole 'nut he r conce pt ua li z ation. We were told through va r ious mes sa ges Atlin is G od's project to he lp bri ng the knowle dge of the One (L ove ) to earth and theref ore He Hims elf is di- recting de velopm e nts. Ma ybe. According to R uss ell's ideas of \"w orking mas t e rly\" (wor king WIT H God) we have some sem- blance of an explanation that I can relate to a nd a gr ee with. Being in tha t pea ceful and loving sta t e of mind while making par ts is ess ential - that w e know. Being P EACE is the ticket and be- ing at pe ace wit h self and t he world is w hat Je sus taught as also Buddha and countles s others . That pea ceful loving countenance is what is Heave n on earth. And is that not what we e xperi e nce around Atlin? As i de from all t ha t, ther e is the design and construction of t he devic e a s a de vi c e. T he s tr uctural components are des igned to ref le ct harmony in vibration/oscillation and be auty. T he se des i gn pa- rameters cons ti tute a me asure and flow of harmony and beauty. T herefor e i t is not pos sible to build into it anything other than that. I t attr a cts what i t is. N ot hing other than harmony and beau- ty could sympathetica l ly attac h i ts elf to s uch design parameters or to anyone who thinks pea ce and love. That being s aid there have be en s everal expe r ienc es of people around A t lin that some have inter - preted as be i ng ne gative. The f irst time this happe ned we were alarmed becaus e we didn't know what was going on and we isolated Atlin until w e de veloped a better under s tanding. T ha t (inter - preted) negative experience was the s econd one and another one happened a few mont hs ago. The theory is s ome people have an inhe r ent fea r of clos enes s, L ove or s eeing thems elves in a clearer light. The f ilm \"G ood Will Hunting\" wherein the star blew his c ool in a s cene whe r e he is invited, l ovingly, to move to C alif ornia, comes to mind as a good e xample. This r ea ction see ms to occur when two conditions a r e pres ent in t he i ndividual: 1) they are endeavoring to open themse lves up to Love and 2) the r e is unknown or unacknowledge d fears lying just below the surface. A clas h of worl dvie ws takes place PDQ, in a heart bea t. All three cas es had these two conditions. All three were women. All three cas es c aught me a nd the individual unprepared. All three reactions were misinterpreted as negatives - when in actuality they are the \"Terr or of the Thr es hold\" whic h pr e ceeds self illumination.

Balance & I m balance 2003, 01/23 MM : There's obviously bee n a lot of discus sion about Tom Bea r den and the work of AIAS late- ly. I 've been r ea di ng up on his ideas for a while now , a nd I think his gr oup ma kes s ome ve r y in- teresting point s . MM : I f I under s tand their ide as correctly, nes tled within the \" standa r d\" ideas of electrodynamics , they believe there is a \"s ub- s ystem\" compose d of i nters ecting sc alar waves . Thes e waves would be longitudinal. Normally they are in balance , ca nceling each other out, a nd pr oducing no ob- se r vable phenomena . When they ar e brought out of balanc e wit h one another, they no longer sum to ze r o, and t he imbalance is obs erved in the 3- D worl d as an ele ctr ic f ield. If we c oul d physical- ly obse r ve t he int e r a cti on i n 4- D, spa ce and time, we would s ee that a \" magnetic\" f ield is pr o- duced in the \"virt ua l \" or \"time\" doma i n. In that domain ther e is a ne t m a gnetic, or focalizing for ce that balance s out the electric, or dis charging force that we obs erve a s the e l e ctr ic field of the electron. MM : I think thi s jives nea r ly exactly wit h Rus sell and Ke ely, i f we a ssume that R uss ell, unbur - dened by the nomenclature of qua nt um mecha nics, di d not complicate the iss ue by desc r ibing the \"time domain\" as be ing \"virt ua l \" , a nd the 3- D domain as be i ng \" real\".

It is not a standing wave bec ause tha t implies two or more waves , in moti on, yet neutralized or equa t e d (zero sum). According to WR thi s point/nonpoint is totally w i thout mo- tion. T herefore it c annot be a w ave, se l f cancelling or ot he r wis e. It may howe ver be accurately ref e r red to as \"balance \" or the ter m I like \"latent potential\" . It i s in f a ct what some have been calling \"God\" and is wholl y neutral or undiffer e nti a t e d. MM : W hen t he bala nce i s di s tur be d, a \"thing\" can manifest into \" observable\" form.

T his i s also c oupl e d wit h a m a gnetic/charging state, whereby as long as the disturbance is maintained, t he manifes tation is c ont inually charged with exces s energy, rushing inwards in an attempt to r e t urn to the or iginal balanced state. When this balance is disturbed, a \"thing\" will manifest a s motion which is obe r vable as form. Thi s is the elec tr ic/cha r ging c ondit ion, beca use energy once destabilized will see k to immulate se eming balance in s eeming for m.

MM : The particle itse lf is a m ode shift, l ike you've thought for a long t ime I t hink. The particle receives the magne ti c /chargi ng energy, a nd somehow organizes it , through a mode shift, into r a- diant electric/discha r ging energy. T he s econd half of that proces s is \" observable\" . The f irst half is not with our prese nt ins tr uments , exce pt perhaps f or the t ype of devices Bearden occa sionally alludes to. DP: The c enter of the part icle is a point of mode s hif ting. It's center axis is still. It 's longitudinal axis is longit udina l waves , I presume pass ing through and into ea ch other. It 's e quator is estab- lished by trans ver s e waves but whose motion is R aleigh. The particle is for med by the c ont ract- ing e l e ctr ic/c har ging energy, accumulates s aid c har ge until \" cri tica l energy' is reac hed at which point a 90° mode s hif t occ ur s , releas ing a magnetic/disc har ging radiant ene r gy. T he se ac ti ons are pulsa t ions , intermittent or oscillatory. B ot h halves a r e observable. T he f irst as charging or accu- mulating energy and r otational s i mulation (spinning earth or atom), in ever incr e asing dens it y. The second half is disc har ging or r adia t ion as in magne ti c fields s ur rounding a center, dis sipating in e ver decreas ing dens ity. Some of the confusion is beca use we are not use d to picturing thes e two f orces as operating a s WR desc r ibes . The othe r c onf us ing part is thes e two forces are actua l ly another complex of sub- tler for c es or streams. This mult i-stream concept is hinted at in WR's writings but mor e explicit in Keely's writings. And their modes of moti on are dif ferent and complex. T he contracting elec- tri c streams are longitudinal while dr agging in se mi -transvers e ( trans f orming) magnetic s tr ea ms and vs. T he expanding m a gnetic are t rans verse f rom the s till center outwa r d t ow ar ds the equator. Motion r e sulting from the two are Raleigh ( vortex). It is my gue ss the s o- ca l le d sca lar i s when the longitudinal and transve r s e are he ld in equation harmonically s peaking whe r e their respec ti ve nodes coincide. This means the particle i s s table a s a parti c le in activity ABOUT tha t s t ill nodal center of equation.

The electri c spark we are so famili a r with is not a charging spark. It is a discha r ging spa r k going back to neutr a li ty.

Corporations ar e artif ic i a l beings without souls, c onscienc e or conce r n f or anything exce pt thems elves - just like the ego. Corporatism is t he root of c om mu- nism (selfishnes s masque r ading as altruism). Corporations were or iginally designed to be a tool for capitalism. A busine ss can raise capital ( public parti c ipati on) in the ownership and direction of the corporation (t he or e t ica ll y). But thos e of raw ambition and li ttle conscienc e have seize d the reins of these cor porations and have made them into tools of persona l gratification instead of s er - vice. God gi ve s.

T hos e that manipulate tools for self aggrandizement (s elf is hly) a nd without r ega r d for \"rhythmically balance d inter c hange\" ar e what you r efer too.

The \"way\" to do this i s by constantly and persis tently c hoosing peac e be cause the ego w i ll always choos e t o fight /wa r . C hoosing peace defuses the ego over time and will res ul t in a ne w mind-set of Peac e Profound - which is the Awake ned state or as the old timers called it \" Chri s ted\", God- men, etc. It is not the be li e f sys tems (r eligions ) that ar e wrong (they ar e s imply ope r ating with mi s inter pretations ) - i t is the belief they are \"ri ght\" i n their inter - pretations/s uper s tit ions (and everyone e l s e is w r ong) that caus es the problems . Sometimes I want to agree wit h the Buddhists that the r e is no God. There is no anthr opomorphic God (m a de in the image of men). T he r e is Awareness which operates on the principles as ide nt i- fied by Keely in his sympathetic laws of Ha r mony and Dis cord. His clar ification was: \"The eter nally consc i ous entity - call i t by whatever name we please - moves in cycles as e t e rnal and inf inite as itself; i t osc i llates and vibr ates perpe tual ly and is never unc onscious of any pre sent c ondit ion, be it pain or pleasur e, j oy or sor row, s hame or glory ; l ike the pe ndul um of a clock or t he s un, moon, or tides, i t s wings from the one to the other of these c ondi tions , now in pleas ure, now in pai n, by its contact with the extr emes of all var ying c ondi tions , like a child which throw s up its head and laughing for joy exclaims , I KN OW I A M.\" Kee ly Awarenes s or Cons ciousne ss is a f unc t ion of harmonic vi brations (Bjerknes Ef fect) of immens e vibrator y rates.

Q ui e ti ng the thoughts in cons ciousne ss is the only w ay t o remove the dis cor - dant tones which in doing s o incr e ases the degree of Awa r ene ss . Henc e choos ing peace is the only true choice becaus e by doing s o we quiet our fear- e ngendered thoughts a nd incr e ase har mo- ny to/with all els e. Fighting and bicke r ing are a nathema to pea ce in/and of mind and alwa ys leads to chaos . Fighti ng and bickering a r e an eff e ct of j udging some t hing to be ba d or good.

As a conse- quence our pers pectives a nd knowledge bas es a r e growing as these f indings a r e s hared, r e- examined, reworked and s hared a gain.

Granted the conve r s ation was somewha t limited in s cope, being r e stricted mostly to Genesis a nd J ohn, but the bas ic tene ts of each perspe ctive we r e mutually s upport e d. As far as I can s ee this was a first f or both of us. Universal Pr inciples were r ec ogni z ed since anc i e nt da ys and written int o a l l s acred texts in whatever for m, cultur e, belief syste m or language permited suc h to be r e cor de d. T ha t is why they ar e c onsidered sacred texts beca use thes e texts s howed the connec t ion between our material s elves and lives and our spiri tua l se l ve s and lives . If we fail to make a di s tinction betwe en a \" spirit\" and a \" consc i ous nes s\" we do our s elves a dis- se r vice , I t hink. T he term \"s pir it\" is an older term and has m a ny m is leading connotations at- tached to it. Am I a \" spirit\" living in my body? Or am I a \" self- a ware cons ciousnes s\" us i ng this body? What's the diff e r enc e? Why i s that differ e nce? Are t he r e only these two discrete modes of being; i.e. , either \" spirit\" or \" self-aware cons ciousne ss \"? F rom our phys ics i t looks like ther e are many leve ls to ma t e r iality a nd hence ther e must be many leve ls to c onscious ness (spirit ) a nd the modes of interaction be tween t he two. For it not to be so we would be again i n limit a ti on. Us ually or in the older view a s pi rit was a conscious ness operating through and in the etheric realm of matter; i. e., a ghos t or similar. In our recent work with SVP we've interacte d w i th con- sc iousnes ses above or beyond this e t he r ic realm; i. e., pure consc iousnes s not allied t o any recog- nized le vel of m a ter iality. So to me the term \"s pir it\" is too limiting and henc e misleading a s it ref e r e nces a l imited set of phenomena. In this regard, is my cons ciousne ss a \"spirit\" or simply cons ciousnes s operating in a nd through a physica l body? A cons ciousne ss has the f ree will to op- erate on a ny level it choos es. T he r efore cons ciousnes s i s not of any material realm but indepen- dent of them all. What it choos es a s its mode or a venue of manif e station is j us t that - a choice.

During one of thos e vis it s I had an ins ight or vision of a cross - s ection of the pond extending from the air above down into the muddy laye r s just beneath. T he water contained in the depress ion, known a s the pond, is proponderantly female thr ough the wa t e r and into t he murky depths (water + earth). Thi s is 'pure' f e male.

The l ight and air pe netr a t e s the water and w her e the light and air intermi ngle with waters and earths within thes e dark or mur ky depths L IFE explodes into be i ng and activity. The insight this morning r eminded me or clarified f or me the primal impor tanc e of femalene ss . The female ene r gy or s tate i s what activates the male energy or state . Anyone who has spe nt time on a farm c an r e l a te to this . No procreation takes pla ce until the f emale is r e ady ( e strus heat cy- cle). T he n and only then is the male of any value i n regeneration. Are not part of our intentions with dynasphe r e s the production and reproduction of energy? Are they not a fractal of univers al principles of m a le and f e m a le intermi ngling? I s there not a rege ner - ation of moti on de sired? Then, a s Rus se l l s o oft e n wr ote , the whole thing is a se x thi ng - but not limit e d to t he mi s led conce pts of moder n s exuality. Everything and every motion i n t he univer s e is a sex act/play be tween contextual s ex ma t e s. The key point I wish to make, before we get a stray, is the dynas pher e is a female state r e ady to be a ctivated by a male pres ence. A dynas phere is a gravity machine as w e know gravity to be a female att ribute or f unc t iona l attri bute .

Doe s a radio broadcas t have a s eat in a radio? Or does the Internet res i de in a ny computer? It res i de s i n and courses thr ough ALL computers conne cted to/t hrough it. Jus t as the Mind of Humanity res ides in ALL minds of humanity. The s eemingly isolated human cons ciousne ss ( ego) is a swirl of idea s and memor ies s urr ounding a focal point - t he body and e go (se l f). Divine or Cosmic Cons cious- nes s has no motion or f ixation of conc ept theref ore it has no Time or S pa ce. I n this view the hu- man cons ciousnes s (ego) is a R E FRAC T ION of that Unity. This refr ac t ion (in SVP r efraction = Diff erentiation) occ ur s mos t likely i n and thr ough the c hakr a s ystem. Each of these centers is like a molecule of water in the a t mos phere of C osmic Mind that refr ac t s the Unity of Li ght (Wisdom) fr om the Sun (M i nd of God) into polar frequencies we then per c eive as color ( thinking). Same for Undiff erentiated Mind - refr ac ti ng into ide as, conc epts, e t c . T his conc ept is not unlike your own except that we have control ove r the ref raction proces s - s hould we c hose to learn a nd e xer - cis e tha t control.

What is ego (within the contexts i n which I use the term )? A person s ees or experi e nces an eve nt. They f orm an opinion, as se ssme nt , judgement or di s cernment about their per c eption of the eve nt. Thi s personal opinion is pr e di c ated on their past e xper ienc es, powers of obse r va t ion, powers of as ses sment, etc. T hes e of cour s e are limited by themselve s. S o the ove r a l l a sse ss m e nt or opinion is likew i s e limited. In other words e go cannot obs er ve or compr e hend the full i mport of any event.

Egoic Thinki ng Bec om es M at ter ( tum or ) 2003, 11/04 Whole M i nd thought ( pe ace, i nnoc ence, L ove) is undif ferentiated and without m otion. Converse- ly, a l l matter is motion f oc alized about a center. Whole Mind thought ( pe ace, i nnoc ence, L ove) cannot move therefore does not focalize a bout a center. Only refr a cted thinki ng (thoughts other than peace, innoce nce, Love) can move a nd all m otion is vor texial about a cente r . Egoi c thinking is diff e r e nt iate d ( refracted) Whole M ind thought. This t hinking ha s motion be- caus e it is polar t hinking ( good/bad, right/wr ong, s elf /others ) . This motionly a ctive thinking natu- rally focalizes to a center about which it circulates. T he more dwe ll ing on or in t his pa r ticular thinking pa t tern the more energy i t has to f oc alize, the dens er it be comes. Eventually the c ir culat- ing polar motions acc umul a te to f orm perceptible matter. I f the thinking were nega ti ve thoughts of/about self these wil l c enter /loca li z e within self's focalized ide ation - the body. T hes e focaliza- tions continue to accumulate until they are \"proof\" or evidenc e of their c r ea t or/caus e - the nega- tive thinki ng about s elf .

Ener gy Tr an s fer 2002, 07/01 Ener gy trans f er, according to SVP, takes place between ce nt e r s and not \" par ticle\" peripher y.

L ove ha s been the base of most r eligions , socie t ie s and families from the dawn of time a nd acts as the foundation f or the New A ge philosophies . Unfor tunate l y sc ience and s ociety, in the wes tern world, has wandered f a r as t ray f rom this bas ic and mos t powerf ul of forces.

Thi s is happening right now, before our ve r y eyes , i n our very he ar ts . When two objects are i n harmony on multiple ha r monic levels, t he vibrations acting between the two are as a communication of intent and quality of t he i r s tate of being of one t o the other . An object's state of being, vi bratorily spe aking, manifes ts as its chord of mass or vibr a ti on signature or that collection of fr e quencies of which i t is made and theref ore is. When tuned to a unison the vibrations emitted by one object are perf e ctly r ec eived and as similated or unde r s tood by the oth- er. It i s well known i n mus i c al cir c l e s that pr ope r ly tuned musical instruments will respond sym- pathetically to eac h othe r . T his ha ppens when vibration r a tes of strings are tuned at exact unis ons betwee n two or more ins tr uments . Pluck or bow a finely tuned s t ring on one instrument a nd other instruments will respond with the same note. T he two individualized objects begin to res onate AS O NE instrument with per fect cadenc e a nd concordanc e. What were once s eemingly s eparate things are now intimately and dyna mi c ally conne cted vi bratorily at the inner mos t harmonics . The connecting link res onates t hrough the hi ghe r ha r monics and not the l ow er physical form . What ha ppens to one becomes an expe r ience f or both s im ultane ously and intimately - fr om w i th- in - as an evoked sympathetic respons e. This spec i a l kind of vibr a ti on is called a Sym pa thetic Vi- bration. T his de f inition coincides perfectly wit h that of Unc ondi tional Love. Generally consid- ered love means t w o or more persons e xper ienc e lif e a nd e ach other as though they exist as one unit resona ti ng in unison each acting c oncor da nt ly upon the ot he r . Sympathetically vibrating structures me ans two or more objects vibr a t ing a s one unit res onating in unison ea ch acting con- cordantly upon the other. B ecaus e sympathe t ic vi bration ca n and does conduct or convey energy sufficient to ca use motion in a distant a nd see mi ngly separate obj e ct it is t he r efore taken to be dynamic energy.

Love is an engineerable for ce ! In the pur e ly physical realm the meta l lic s tr uc tur e of the Dyna sphere will rot a te. This will only occur after the e stablishment of a Neutral Ce nter withi n the device. Kee ly claimed the discovery of the N eutr al C enter as his greates t ac hievement. A Neutral Cente r (similar in s om e ways to Zer o-Point) is that which is the s elf -identity of the mechanis m. I t is t he veritable heart of the or - ganis m .

The Ne w Sciences are be gi nning to work with vort i- ces and implosion which repr e sents the f emale side of nature. T he Dynas phere works with both of these plus the t hird Neutral s tate being a derived combination of the two. T he two polar for ce s come together in a pure s tate of sympathetic vibr a t ion to form the Neutr a l Cente r . It is fr om this harmonic union of divine-l ike for c es that renewa l or regeneration comes. Through this mecha- nism may be developed and li be r ate d fur ther \"lif e B E ing\" pr ope r ties . The Dynasphere is the fir s t multi-dim e nsional mechanis m born of a s cience and philosophy that acknowle dges and res pects that whic h N atur e is . Thr ough the development of this t e chnology we are being a f forded ins ights int o Nature's finer forces thus allowing an expanding abili ty to per - ceive with growing c l a r ity how everything is intimately as sociated and coope r atively working to- gether.

Each i ns tr ument ( ce ll ) then i s graduated (made to wor k i n har mony) with every other i ns tr ume nt w i thin its s ection (or gan). I n this pos ition each instrument is evi- dencing the L a w of Ass imi la t ion. All the se ctions ( organs ) are then gr adua ted (tuned) t o be in harmony with all the other i ns tr ume nt s (cells) and s ections (organs) of t he entir e or che stra. Then and only then can the or che stra (body) as a whole be in a harmonious state one to all and all to one or what we may term hea lt h a s harmony e quals health.

So what is s ympathy and why i s it attr ac ti ve ? Sympathy, vibratori ly s peaking, is concordance of rate of vibration which is mus ically called unison of the f undamenta l and/or some or all of its harmonics.

Ma ny sources tell us it i s not poss i ble to have diff iculties with anothe r per s on bec ause , they s ay, w e can only ha ve dif ficulties wit h our s elves. The apparent diff iculty with anothe r is an illusion. The dynamic of this s eeming paradox wor ks something like this: We find we are in a c ontentious relation with someone or perhaps in the pas t. T he y do, s ay or act in a way tha t rubs t he wrong way or in some minor or major f a shion ca uses us to feel uncomf ortable or une asy or even vio- lently oppos ed to that which we think we pe r ce ive in t he ir actions, words or mannerisms . So we blame them for making us unc om fortable, uneas y or reac ti ng negatively in retur n. What is actually happening is we ar e ups et w i th our own reactions to that perceive d. We perceive what we pe r c eive and label that perception good, bad or w hatever. We cannot interact with any- thing coming at us - we can only intereact with the perception of i t - which of cour s e is wholly in our own minds or c onscious ness . Any negativity we may perceive is only a nd c an only be in our own minds . If there is a ne gative reaction to that perceived we are c r e ati ng that reaction of our own ac cor d, volition and creation.

T hey are props and mirr ors in s uppor ting roles of the play we create. E very get a ngr y at an inanimate object? I t can do nothing but be the object it i s . T he anger comes fr om withi n our r e actions and actions of our own thinking. T he r e- for e you ar e not angr y a t t he object - you ar e angry at your ow n t houghts about the object. Be- caus e that is all there is f or you to tangle wit h - your own t houghts conce r ning your perceptions . When the A CIM s ays you can ne ver be angr y at w hat you t hink you are angry at - you ca n only be angry at your own thoughts . Which you yourself create d, conscious ly or uncons ciously.

In SVP Love Rules 2002, 10/27 In SVP livi ng in L ove is be i ng in the Now. One of the thi ngs or thought cons tr ucts that kee ps people in the pas t and living by might (as you call it) is a false understanding of how the univer s e functions. This of cour s e includes themselves a s an integral pa r t of the unive r s e. My two previous pos ts this mor ning reveal how LOVE is the mec hanism by which the univer s e functions. Now we could s ay this is purely a sc i e nti fic or physic s approach but it is f ar more than that. Everything is of e ver ything els e that exists . E ve r y thing is conne cted to every t hing els e via Sympathetic Streams or L ove Curr e nt s . T hes e a r e the s ame as the P a ss i ve Mind Curr ents . When the M ind is s till e d one is in L ove and in intimate c ont a ct with All Else. T his is being in the Now . All centers of activity whe ther atoms , planets or humans are cons tantly linked or hard- wired via thes e ever- prese nt s tr e ams of Love/Mind. Love being simply an aspe ct, state or condition of Mind For c e (Cons ciousnes s). For me i t has not be en s uf ficient t o live by faith alone. I w anted to know HO W and WHY fait h, belief, kindness work a nd how my lif e is cr e ated a nd governed. On a parallel c our s e I wa nted to bring so-called Free Energy to earth as I f e lt such w oul d r elieve many diff icult s ituations - like poverty, want and war. T urns out t he two paths I've walked are the SAME P A T H. W hat Free E n- ergy is is the same as F ree Consc iousnes s - living in freedom from il lus ion and fear a nd/ or living by m ight or f orce . We can s eparate these topics as a f ac il ity for conversa t ions . But true Free Ener gy and true F ree- dom ( ala Krishnamurti and C hr is t) cannot be attained f rom the fear/might pe r s pective. They can only be attained through under s tanding Onenes s which includes considerations of our Consc ious endea vor s allied with our Energy endea vor s . I n the e nd it is this sync opathetic (in c oncert, coor - dination) cons ideration that will lead fr om either to both. It is ONE e ndeavor, ONE effor t and ONE plac e to wind up. SVP will not be implemented f rom t he fear/might /force perspective. It can only be activated by the Heart (Love/Mind F orce). The same applies to per s onal Awakening - can't get t he r e fr om the egoic f ea r /for c e mode. T he machine know n as Atlin is a n example of this wide pers pective ap- proach. It i s a machine wherein L ife, Love and Consc i ous nes s come together a s a movi ng, breathing a nd living entity. Jus t like you and me .

Two diff erent general mind-sets leading to the s ame conclus ion - aw akening - or an e xpanded unde r s tanding of who and what we are. Be i ng in the cente r of s o many differ ing mind-se t s as I am with SVP I have experienced under - sta ndi ngs and judgements f rom every angle. S c ientists ha ve both agr e ed and disa gr ee d.

In 1984 les s than a doze n people wor ld-wide ever heard of Keely, according to my es ti ma t ion. So w e've gained i n populari ty.

A l l matter is solidified thought or Mind congealed in for m. In SVP we cons ider two bas ic sta t e s of Mind. There are mor e but le t 's keep it simple.

These centralizations for m about a point or center of focalization as does all moving s wirl ing thought e ner gy and every other \" ki nd\" of energy.

If all t he players are of the s ame ideal (to pla y beautiful mus i c ) and all the instrum e nts are properly tuned the orches tr a ( metaphor for the body) plays good music. I t i s sa id to be healthy. Whe n one or more of the players do not play i n tune, harmony or synch with the others as a global whole, enharm ony and disc or d prevail - the orchestra is then out of synch, discordant or unhea l thy and i f not corr e cted (harmonized) will eventually ce ase to function as an orches tr a .

There a r e three ba sic centers being physic al, mental and s o- c alled s pir itual. ( It would be nice to be rid of this ter m \"s pir itual\" . But we are to some degree stuck with it.) We can better us e the term \" ether ic \". The higher di rec t ive , the Mind (bi g M ) , always holds predominance. All form is de r ived fr om Mind des cending through the ethe r ic into the physical. I n human terms the mental center is his/her IDE AL or con- ception of who they are. T he other side of the m e ntal center is who they R E ALLY ARE.

Perf ec t healing or he alth comes in when the conflicted s tates are brought into harmonic juxtapo- sition or when they danc e to the s ame tune - s o to spea k.

Multi -Le vel T ool s 2002, 05/09 In developing Atlin and a theory of i t we've encountered a number of dilema s, paradoxes and as- sorted puzzles . Several \" tools\" have been developed and/or c ul tivate d to deal w i th eac h. T he two more powe r ful tools ha s been medit a ti on (intui tive insight) a nd s yll ogis tical l ogic. I f f aith can be a tool then t ha t too. The first step to ge t anyw her e is the idea that dynaspheres rotate even though t he one in hand does not fully do so. Keely had so many ve r ifying wit ne ss es of scientific, e ngi ne er ing and s ocial integrit y that I have presume d they s poke the truth of what t he y thought they saw. Then the ques- tion bec omes \"WHY and HOW do dynas pheres f unc ti on? \" I've bee n around mec hanic mac hi ne s, in farming, timbering, stea m , wa ter , indus t ry, automotive and a er ona ut ic al f ields . W hil e no expert in any of thes e fields I have an adequa t e gr a sp and f a- miliar ity of things mecha ni c al, ele ctr omec hanical, c hemical, force, f luids, press ur e , levers , wheels , etc. The first thing one noti c es when examining a dynas phere from any of the above perspec ti ve s is \"It cannot be! \" There is nothing in any of these fields that r e veals the sec r et of rotation. Yet, a s Galileo once said, \" Nevertheless , it moves ! \" Perhaps it was Sherlock Holmes that said something l ike : \"If all pos sibilities have been eli minat- ed then t he impos sible m us t be true.\" One gl a nce at Atlin tells us all pos sible mechanic al mea ns are not there to work - s o therefore wha t makes it w or k is the impos sible.

There is litt le s tor e d i n memory that could pr ope r ly be ap- plied t o understanding dynasphe r ic for ce . One is left ha nging over a n abys s unless a bridge of sorts can be developed. I ntuition in the va r ious f orms of dreams , ins ights, r eve lations, hunches , hints and Da wn's mess aging were the form a ti ve elements of this bridge. Yet there is still no bridge - we ha ve this ethereal bridge made of l ight of understanding but it c annot yet bear actual weight. To bear weight the bri dge must have va li da ti ng s ubstanc e. W e know the bridge is real in poten- tial but lit tle in our broad experiences s eems to s oli dify the idea of the bridge int o the rea l ity of a working bridge. Ther e are thos e who take the pos iti on of tot a l f a it h. To them we do not ne ed to have explicit en- gineering data and m a thematical models to build SVP type mac hiner y. We us e intuition alone and all will c ome out OK. T he r e is a lot to be said for thi s model. On the ot he r hand there a r e thos e w ho propose we ca nnot build anything reliably without facts , figur es a nd acc ur ate mathematical models. As in mos t cas es, this is not an either/ or s ituation. I ntuition is a valuable tool as we've seen and use d extens ively in thi s project. Whe n cutting meta l parts t o fi t with other meta l parts t he r e is a need for ac curate math a nd s kill. A very good ana logy is ma ki ng a mus i c al i ns tr ume nt . Countles s individuals have intuited the f ine details suff icie nt to make an endles s var iety of musical ins tr u- ments.

T he intuitive method is r ight brained and cr e ative but the builder must still pick up s om e material a nd tools and r ende r the idea into a horn, harp or wha t e ver .[*] The \" not- s o- intuitive\" des igner us es creativity and i ntuition in the beginning stage s then the inev- itable tools a nd mater ia l s to render his creativity into mater ia l ity. T he di fference betwe en the two instrument makers is pr imarily, intuitive se nsitivity, knowledge of the s ubject(s), quality of tools and materi a l s . Also impor tantly are craftsmans hip, know- how , f unding and s ocial e nvir onment. Having worked in many differ e nt f ields I can sa y each field has two sets of tool boxes. An auto mechanic will have a tool box with spe cif ic tools appropr iate for working on cars and engines . An ele ctr ica l wor ke r will have an almos t entir ely differ e nt collection of tools. While a make r of musica l ins t urments will have another. Ther e a r e s om e s imi la r ities but in ge ner a l no tool box will se r ve appropr ia t e ly fr om one field t o another. [*] The s econd tool box they e ach have a nd is tas k spec if ic is their collection of non- material tools. Some call this know l e dge, know - how, skill and training. T he c om pute r indus tr y is a good analogy. T he r e i s the hardware or the computer itse lf . T he non- material as pect is the software and skill a t using the s of twa r e and hardwar e combination. SVP has two tool boxes as well.

It bul ge s with tools to work with \"things\" in f orm.

Ordinar y non- me chanical tool boxs ca nnot build a NE W br idge f rom \" idea\" to materialit y. They can however serve on e xi s ting bridges of, f or instance, t he idea of a car and building then main- taining it.

Ma ny sources tell us it i s not poss i ble to have diff iculties with anothe r per s on bec ause , they s ay, w e can only ha ve dif ficulties wit h our s elves. The apparent diff iculty with anothe r is an illusion. The dynamic of this s eeming paradox wor ks something like this: We find we are in a c ontentious relation with someone or perhaps in the pas t. T he y do, s ay or act in a way tha t rubs t he wrong way or in some minor or major f a shion ca uses us to feel uncomf ortable or une asy or even vio- lently oppos ed to that which we think we pe r ce ive in t he ir actions, words or mannerisms . So we blame them for making us unc om fortable, uneas y or reac ti ng negatively in retur n. What is actually happening is we ar e ups et w i th our own reactions to that perceive d. We perceive what we pe r c eive and label that perception good, bad or w hatever. We cannot interact with any- thing coming at us - we can only intereact with the perception of i t - which of cour s e is wholly in our own minds or c onscious ness . Any negativity we may perceive is only a nd c an only be in our own minds . If there is a ne gative reaction to that perceived we are c r e ati ng that reaction of our own ac cor d, volition and creation.

Let's not confuse ownership with all the other a spec t s of r ights, c l a im s , etc. Let's not confuse people with their bodies or A t lin with her chosen body. For instance a landowner OW NS the right s to a property ye t all othe r s , li ving on that pr ope r ty, are co-custodians and co-beneficiari e s of the landowner's RIGHT S to that pr ope r ty. He holds vari ous rights of use fr om which he ex- tends additional a nd conditional r ights of us e to other s . He only has rights to or claims upon. And thes e rights and c l a i ms only exist becaus e a l l his neighbor s in his communit y at la r ge agree to them. Rights of us e a r e founded and have their very es se nce ba sed in the community's acknowl- edgement and honor ing of them, the individual and ea ch other. In no other way can r ights exis t . Very s pir itual indeed. Rights are communit y honoring itself. Rights = honor ing. In the f inal analys i s e ven the landowner doe s not \"ow n\" tha t proper ty. He has but a c ondi tional right of us e. T he State of Color a do rese r ve s rights of eminent dom a in and they will exercise that right if and when the landowner does not do as they e xpect of him like continue to pay taxes (r ent). Ther e are so m a ny kinds and types of ri ghts in our complicated society today. No one has or owns anything except vari ous a nd s undr y RIGHT S OF USE to a thing or CLAI M S upon or about a thing or cir c umstance. A nd thes e rights are compos ed of other s ' recognition and allow- ance (honor ing) of same. So, all r ights are agr e ements between indivi dua ls. Nothing c oul d be more s pir itual. Ever yone agrees the landowner ha s the rights to use that piece of land, duly s ur - veyed and l e gally des cribed, to the exclusion of all othe r people a nd any claims they ma y make. Pr ope r ty then is community a gr ee ment as to r ights of us e. Pr ope r ty is NOT a \" thing\" t o be OWNED. Ownership of pr ope r ty is a s et of rights or claims to and about a \"thing\" or circumsta nce s uch as \"right to m a r ket\" a thing. NOT H I NG CAN BE OWNED i n the t rue sens e of the word \"owned\" . I n this r ega r d the Na ti ve Americans are corr ec t, es pecially the Hopi. NOTHING C AN B E OWNED. Only the r ights to and about a t hing are c on- side r ed, ha ve eve r been considered, as property.

Utilizing this powerful dynamic f orce and i ts s cience and phi los ophy, enables us once again to redisc over what and who we really a r e: beings of Love.

T his New Science loves , r es pects and cooperates with Na tur e on a l l harmoni c fr e quency l e vels becaus e this is the ver y es sential nature of sympathetic vibr ations . I t does not arrogantly force na t ure to addres s pur pos es on s tr ic t - ly the material or phys ical l e vel. Being in harmony with Nature brings joy and a c elebration of lif e bec ause acting or playing in har mony with the localized vibr ations is \"ma ki ng beautiful mu- sic \" w i th those for ce s. Working in opposition to the vibrations of nature c r ea t e s di s cord, destruc- tion and death.

These new tools, whe n properl y applied, promise eas i e r and more eff icient methods of creating peace and har mony in one's life.

T he se vibr a t ions or s tanding wa ves all have nodes c oi nc i ding to the very infi- nite c enter of the sphere and t o the ma ss of the shell. The tightnes s of this centering of the nodes is defined by the \" Q\" or degree of tuning of the various r es onators and vibrator y components of the m e chanism. Keely claimed the dis covery of the Neutral C enter as his greates t achieve ment. A Ne ut ral Center (similar in s ome w ays to Zer o-Point) is that which is the s elf- identity of t he mecha nism. It is the veritable he ar t of the or ganis m.

The New Scie nces are be - ginning to wor k with vortices and impl os ion whic h represents the f e male s ide of na tur e.

If we live in fear we ins ti nc ti ve ly react to thes e new feelings of opennes s in old f a shioned and no longer us ef ul ways .

This i s the challenge then to overcome the old patterns and a ll ow the new to permeate t he s ystem t hus bringing it i nto a state of harmoni c coin- cidence with t he new for ce s and patterns of birth and creativity.

Pol ar izat ion Polari z ation is a state exhibiting two pol e s seemingly opposite t o one another but of t he s ame source. The simplist example of thi s s tate is a bar magne t under s ome de gr ee of magne t iz ation. Pur e iron does not acce pt magnetization or polari z ation well. Soft ste el (ir on plus carbon) does however easily magnetize/polarize. Soft carbon steel has the a dded feature of \"remembering\" magnetic inf luenc e.

T herefor e or thereby copper is an ideal c onductor or inductor of e l e ctr ica l (charging and or discha r ging) influence. C har ging means the same as increas ing press ur e s.

This i s a n insignificant num be r when con- side r ing m a ss production machine s which ca n cos t hundreds of thousa nds of dollar s for EACH machine center. These high cos ts are offset becaus e s uch a machine can automatically t urn out many dozens or hundreds of parts per time interval whereas a manually operated machine li ke mine c an only do one part in t he s ame time f rame. The s hop time cost of $50 is really too low. T he wea r and tea r on tools is a f ac t of machining hard meta l s . Cutting tools are expens i ve and I 'm not eve n us i ng the best qualit y which cost seve r - al t imes more. One tool bit can c ost $85 and should it br e ak like one did the othe r day it must be replaced. Anothe r high cos t factor is \"s et-up time\". It c an take anywhe r e fr om a few minut e s t o an hour or so to s et the part on the mac hi ne , align it properly, set the tool in the machine, align i t to the part to be worked. Every cut on eve r y part must be s et-up while the ac tual cutting can be a one ti me pas s of sec onds or a s eries of repeated pass es las t ing hours. Computer c ontr olled ma- chining is a big de al thes e da ys. M ost a l l of this set up time is eli minate d. But computer con- trol le d maching is a magnitude(s) m ore costly to acquire than ha nd- operated machines . The building of Atl in was a shot in the dar k. Those who've read m y new book \" A tlin - K nowing I AM \" are f amiliar with that part of the s tor y. These fir s t units are una voidably expens ive.
