(P SA . xix. I-4.) I N preparing for a Supplement to \"Tones and Colours,\" several musicia ns have carefully investigated the work. I transcribe a copy of Dr. Cha lmers Masters' opinion, as he had previously studied colours:— \"I esteem myself fortunate in being introduced to y ou, and becoming acquainted with your beautiful work on 'Tones and Colours.' I have , to the best of my ability, worked out your idea, by writing down in music the various dis cords in use amongst musicians, and resolving them according to the laws of Harmony, and I find i n all cases the perfect triad agrees with what you term the trinities in colours. The way in whic h you find the whole circle of Major and Minor keys by pairs in colours is deeply interestin g, and must be true. The only point of divergence between your system and that recognised by all musicians is the ascending Minor Scale. No musically trained ear can tolerate the s eventh note being a whole tone from the eighth. The Minor second in the lower octave desce nding is very beautiful, and it is strange how all composers feel a desire to use it. To ment ion one case out of hundreds, I may cite Rossini's well-known air, 'La Danza.' \"Yours faithfully, \"W. CHALMERS MASTERS.\" I was aware that my explanation of the Minor Scales was e rroneous. I now see the beautiful Scriptural type which shows how they develope, r ising or falling in perfect harmony. I hope to explain this clearly, and I think that any who have doubted my having gained these laws from the Scriptures will the n see their mistake. I had also hoped to write a very brief outline of a few of the innumerable Scriptural types which have guided me in the development of Tones and Colours; but my sight suddenly failed for reading and writing; and I only al lude to the seven spirits of God (Rev. iii. I) as regards tones and colou rs, and to the twelve fruits of the Tree of Life (Rev. xxii. 2) as regards the twel ve notes of keyed instruments. The Minor Scales are the type of Creation developing, when no Sabba th (or Rest) was required; and we now see this re-echoed throughout the world around us, nothing resting on the Sabbath. A Minor Scale, therefore, canno t sound the "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"4 SUPPLEMENTARY REMARKS. ————————————————————————————————————————————————— sixth note, which would be Creation perfected, without entering upon the fifth higher key; and it cannot sound the seventh falling into the octave without discord. Therefore the eighth note is not the octave of the first, as it is the fourth note of the fifth higher key. My first plan was to take away entirely the present developm ent of the Minor Keys; but, on consideration, it seems best to leave them exactly as they are, and to add fresh musical developments of the Minors, explaining them , and leaving it needless, for those who do not wish to look deeper into the subject , to examine the former development. Should they do so, however, they will s ee that not a single note is altered, the only difference being the Scales de veloping by fifths instead of by sevenths. The Major Scales are the type of Creation perfected—man being c reated, and the Almighty resting—every Major Scale developing the sixth a nd seventh notes, and the eighth the octave of the first. Therefore, every Maj or Scale includes the Sabbath, or Rest. I am quite aware that musicians will set aside the Minors as here written; but I trust some minds may be led to examine the beautiful Scriptural types, too deep for our minds ever to find a beginning (the Scriptures hav e no beginning), and too high for our minds ever to complete ascending. If, as I believe, the Natural Sciences throughout Creation devel ope by Trinities, how silently, yet how strikingly, may we trace the wonders of Redeeming Love. \"Wisdom hath builded her house; she hath hewn out her seven pillars .\"— Prov. ix. I. We strikingly see in the development of harmonies th e type of 2 Cor. iii. 18, as each key rises from darkness to light, or, desc ending, falls from light to darkness. F. J. HUGHES.

I wish it to be clearly understood that I have gained the evolutions from the mysterious type of Life—a golden thread running throughout the Scriptures, from the first chapter of Genesis to the last of Revelation;—life developi ng around us and within us from the Almighty, who is its Eternal Fountain. My youthful im pressions included the belief that the views of Dr. Darwin, my great-unc le, contradicted the teaching of the Scriptures, and I therefore avoided them altoge ther. Having endeavoured for years to gain correctly the laws which develope E volution, I suddenly discovered that I was working from Scripture on the s ame foundation which he had found in Creation; and as Creation and Revelation procee d from the same Author, I knew that they could not contradict each other. I t is considered by many that my cousin, Charles Darwin, gained his first ideas of Evolution from his grandfather's works; but I know from himself that he w as ignorant of them, and that his theory of Evolution was arrived at by his close experiments and observations of the laws of creation alone. Only a few months si nce, after reading his work on \"the Movements of Plants,\" published in 1881, and wishing to be certain that I had not an incorrect belief, I asked the following question—\"Did you gain your views on Evolution by your wonderfully acute observations, ignorant of your grandfather's ideas?\" The reply was, that he had done so e ntirely from his own observations. It is my firm belief that, if a powerful intellect take s up the radical idea contained in the following pages, it will be found to be the directing force or general key-note which will gradually disentangle intricacies in all the natural B "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"10 INTRODUCTION. ————————————————————————————————————————————————— sciences, and link, by the same mode of physical evolution, the past , the present, and the future. I enter upon the subject with the deepest sense of my own inability to do justice in any measure to the grandeur of the topic; but I trust that my remarks may prove suggestive to others of far higher truths. They are the result of the leisure hours of nearly fifty years, during which the conviction has ever deepened, that \"philosophy of the natural kind docs but push man's ignorance fart her back,\" and that, in the concluding words of Sir John Lubbock's inaugural address to the British Association at York in 1881, \"the great lesson which Science teaches is, how little we yet know, and how much we have still to learn.\" If health is still granted to me, and if an interest is crea ted on the subject of these pages, I shall endeavour to explain by what means I ga ined the laws here described, and to enter upon the development of numbers as showing the stream of lime ever falling into infinity, and gliding onwards; also th e sevens in creation, with several other branches of the subject which arc here untouched, or but briefly alluded to. It is my earnest desire that all may be closely examined. Indifference will grieve me, but even severe criticism will afford me pleasure, as proving that the subject is considered worthy of investigation. The publication of this work has been unavoidably delayed for a yea r, and I now quote briefly from an address of Dr. C. W. Siemens, during the la te meeting of the British Association at Southampton, as reported in the Tim es. I have strictly endeavoured to make my investigations according to his views of combining scientific knowledge with practical utility. \"The time was when Science was cultivated only by the few, who looked upon its application to the arts and manufactures as almost beneat h their con- sideration: his they were content to leave in the hands of othe rs, who, with only commercial aims in view, did not aspire to further the obje cts of Science for its own sake, but thought only of benefiting by its teachings. Progress could not be rapid under this condition of things, because the man of pure scien ce rarely pursued his inquiry beyond the mere enunciation of a physical or che mical principle, while the simple practitioner was at a loss how to harmonise th e new knowledge with the stock of information which formed his mental capital i n trade. The advancement of the last fifty years has, I venture to submit, re ndered theory and practice so interdependent, that an intimate union between the m is a matter of absolute necessity for our future progress.\" \"It is to the man of science, who also gives attention to practical questions, and to the practitioner, who devotes part of his time to the prosecution of strictly scientific investig ation, that we owe the rapid progress of the present day, both merging more and more into one clas s, that of pioneers in the domain of Nature.\" \"These considerations may s erve to show that, although we see the men of both abstract and applied science gr oup themselves "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" INTRODUCTION. 11 ————————————————————— ———————————————————————————— in minor bodies for the better prosecution of .special objects, the points of contact between the different brandies of knowledge are ever multiplying 1, all tending to form pail of a mighty tree—the tree of modern science.\" \"I n this short word energy we find all the efforts in Nature—energy is life in action.\" \"We shall thus find that in the great workshop of Nature there arc no lines of dem arcation to be drawn between the most exalted speculation and commonplace practi ce, and that all knowledge must lead up to one great result, that of an intelligent recognition of the Creator through His works.\" F.

GENERAL REMARKS ON HARMONIES OF TONES AND CO LOURS. \"On crazy fabrics ill-timed cost bestowed No purpose answers, when discretion bids To pull them down, and wait a season fit To build anew.\" A LTHOUGH I am confident that the foundation on which I have been building is firm, and will never fail, I also feel that there are pr obably errors in raising the superstructure. \"Truthful deductions must ultimately harmonise ; like light, they will shine by their own effulgence.\" \"If, however, we dete rmine that we will not receive any truth against which objections can be ra ised, we shall remain in a slate of universal scepticism, for against truths of ev ery description objections have been and may be suggested.\" Appearances are often contrary t o facts— \"the straight stick looks crooked in the tide.\" And the question has always to be decided, whether the objections neutralise the positive evidence s in favour of the truth of any assertion. It seems desirable that I should briefly state my entire i gnorance of natural science, and that what I do know has been gained without techni cal knowledge, with the determination that imagination should not inte rfere with strict investigation. I had for a long time studied the development of the harmonics of colour, and believed that I had gained them correctly; but I saw no way of proving this. The thought occurred—Why not test the laws in musical harmonies? I wrote down the development of the seven major keys of the white notes in key ed instruments. I was perplexed by the movement as of \"to and fro,\" but the develop ment of numbers explained this point, and I found that the method of development in colours, tones, and numbers agreed. I remembered the keys with sha rps, but had forgotten that B \u0002 belonged to the key of F, and here I thought that the laws failed. But I found by reference that all were correct, the ei ghth being the first of a higher series, the laws having enabled me to distinguish betw een flats and sharps, "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" DR. GAUNTLETT'S REMARKS . 13 ————————————————————————————————————————————————— whether veering round, or advancing and retreating in musical cl ef. I next tried the major keys which develope flats, and I thought that G \u0002 would develope a perfect harmony, but found that it must be F \u0001 , and that in this one harmony E \u0001 must be used in place of F \u0003 ; on reference, I found that thus the twelve keys developed correctly in succession, the thirteenth being the octa ve, or first of a higher series. I had forgotten all the minor keys, except that A is the relati ve minor of C major; but although I had only faint hopes of success, I determined to try, and I gained the twelve keys correctly, with the thirteenth oct ave. I found also that E \u0002 was usually printed as a minor key-note, Nature's laws having s hown that it must be D \u0001 . In a few remarks on \"Tones and Colours,\" inserted in the Athenæum of February 24, 1877, I alluded to the great loss I had sustained by t he sudden death of Dr. Gauntlett. I often retrace with grateful rem embrance the kind manner in which he examined this scheme when it was but crude and imperfect; with a very capacious intellect, he had a warm and generous hea rt, causing him to think over with candour any new ideas placed before him. He w as of the greatest use to me, by corroborating the points which I had g ained. I remarked to him one day, \"I find that, of the double tones, F \u0001 is a key-note and G \u0002 a root.\" He replied, \"You must have a right foundation to work upon, or you would never have ascertained the necessity of the two pole s; you have gained the double tones correctly, and the development of harmonies without limit. On this point I have always felt the failur e of the laws followed by the musician.\" I add quotations from the first letter I received from him. \" I have read the MS., and there are some very curious coincidences—exceedingly s o—here and there. Whether it will clear out into a demonstrable system, I cannot say at present. If we can get our harmonical start, I think all will come out pl ainly, for there is so much that is consistent in sequence. There has been nothing at all like it at present, and some of it squares singularly with the old G reek notions.\" \"I am more than half a disciple of your theory of the six tones, and am inc lined to imagine that it would do away with much complication, and keep the mind bent on a smaller circle. We can only see things in patches, and hear in trinities, and every single sound is a trinity.\" There is amazing grandeur, united with simplicity, in the working of Nature's laws in the development of harmonies of sound, so that the smallest conceivable point has its complementary and corresponding gradation, whi ch renders it capable of development into its peculiar harmony, causing the \"multequivalency of harmonies\" in endless variety, whether veering round, to and fro, ascending or descending, or advancing and retiring in musical clef.

THE METHOD OF DEVELOPMENT, OR CREATION, OF H ARMONIES ON ALL KINDS OF KEYED, WIND, AND STRINGED INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDI NG THE MOST PERFECT OF ALL, THE HUMAN VOICE. \"In every art or science, we expect accuracy accord ing to the nature of the subject-matter, and the en d which it is proposed to attain.\" T HIS scheme is grounded upon the belief that a key has been gained which unites grandeur with simplicity, the laws of which are wonderfully simpl e, although most complex in their working, explaining all the intricacies whic h arise in the developments of harmonies. There is much paradox, and the scheme differs so much from any hithert o published on the subject, that I am aware that, if any link can be found to be wanting in the chain, the defect will immediately be seized upon. I believe, however, that it will be found to admit of clear demonstration. Anyone who has studied the subject knows the difficulties that arise on all sides. In the problem before us, we have to reduce large fields of thought to certai n elementary truths. In my endeavour to do this, I have been entirely dependent upon the discove ry of the laws of Nature, as my ear is not musical enough to assi st me in the matter. \"All mysteries are either truths concealing deeper trut hs, or errors concealing deeper errors,\" and thus, as the mysteries unfold, truth or erro r will show itself in a gradually clearer light. The great mystery of music lies in its infinite resources; it teems with subtle elements and strange analogies. A musi cal note may be compared to a machine: we touch the spring and set the machine in motion, but the complex machinery exists beforehand, quite independent of our will; the motive power is not of our creation, and the laws on which its operation d epends are superior to our control. The complex work of harmony is governed by the laws which are originated by the Creator; every note performs what H e has willed, and in tracing these laws let us not be indifferent about their Aut hor, but ever bear in mind that the source or fountain of the life and activity of harmonies arises from the Power who created the machine, and who knows how it will act. L et us also remember that we understand this machine but partially, and gover n it but imperfectly, as indeed the finite can only, in a small measure, grasp the Infinite; and in any "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 16 HARMONIES OF TONES AND COLOURS. ————————————————————————————————————————————————— study of the natural sciences, as we progress, we find that \"hill s peep o'er hills, and alps o'er alps arise.\" As regards keyed instruments, it app ears that the effect of those notes which act two parts, such as C \u0001 and D \u0002 , is rectified in some way so as to be perfectly attuned to the ideal of harmony within us. Aga in, the \"Amen\" sung by the choir in a cathedral may not be in accurate tune, but if ne arly the correct intonation is sounded, after travelling along the aisles, the cho rds always return to the ear in perfect harmony, because the natural laws of music, as sisted by the echoing power of the building, have attuned them to the perfect harm onical triad. If the \"Amen\" be too much out of tune, these laws decline to interfer e, and there is no such helpful resonance.* Here we see why music, as a sci ence, takes the priority of painting; for if music is good, it is perfected by na tural laws which cause its tones to melt into each other in the most delicate gradations, while the painter who endeavours to represent the exquisite variations of ti nts and lights in the living landscape is dependent entirely upon his own resources. The early writers on music were philosophers and mathematicians on the broad ba sis of general science, not on that of music only. Mathematicians, for the most part, have only studied the subject of musical sounds up to a certain poi nt, and have then left it. The musician must take the chromatic scale—not as it exists in Nature, for that offered by the mathematician, without the o rdinary com- pensations of conventional theory, is of no use to the practical m usician. Of course, true Art cannot be opposed to Nature, although all the rules of the musician are not the facts of Nature. Music, pure, natur al, and harmonical, in the true and evident sense of the term, is the division of any key-note, or starting-point, into its integral and ultimate parts, and the desce nding divisions will always answer to the ascending, having reference to a general whole. The essence and mystery in the development of harmonies consist in the fact that every key-note, or unit, is a nucleus including the past, the present, and the future, having in itself an inherent power, with a tendency to expand and contract. In the natural system, as each series rises, its contents expand and fall back to the original limit from any point ascending or descending; we cannot p erceive finality in any ultimate; every tone is related to higher and lower tones , and must be a part of an organised whole. It is well known how deeply the late Sir John Herschel studied this subject; and it was his opinion that there was some principle in the science of music which had yet to be discovered. I think it will be seen that most of the difficulties in the rules of harmony arise from not taking the key-note, with the six tones which it d evelopes from itself, as guiding the ear, first to the six notes of its harm ony, and then to the key-note which becomes the leader of the scale. In the study of the na tural gamut, ————————————————————————————————————————————————— *See remarks on the wonderful power of the ear in a djusting defects of intonation in Macfarren's Lectures on Harmony , No. II. "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE DEVELOPMENT OF HARMONIES. 17 ————————————————————————————————————————————————— the artificial system must not be mixed up. The wonders of Natur e's laws in the developments of harmonies, consist in the beautiful adaption of keyed and all other musical instruments to a range commensurate with hum an powers. The chromatic scale of twelve notes (the thirteenth being th e octave) is not the scale of Nature. To construct a musical instrument upon real di visions of musical tones, each of them being in correct ratio with the others, it woul d be necessary to have a larger number of tones to the octave. In the development of harmonies on the natural system, we trace the perfect adaptation of m eans to ends, meeting the intricacies of every musical instrument, including that most perfect of all— the human voice. If the laws which I shall endeavour to explain develope the twelv e major harmonies, with each note in succession expanding its six tones from within itself; and if each of these is found to be a lower development, which leads the ear to a corresponding higher expansion of the twelve major key-notes, and t he six tones of each ascending and descending in an unbroken sequence from any twel ve consecutively, the thirteenth being the octave of the first, which c ommences a higher or a lower series; and if the twelve minor harmonies are also gained by the same laws from their twelve relative key-notes (the t hirteenth again being octave): if, again, all other notes are shown to be but higher or lower repetitions of these twenty-four harmonies—may we not consider the problem as in some measure solved? especially as the harmonies proceed in geom etric as well as harmonical ratio, and an accurate parallel can be traced bet ween the development of notes and colours, which latter correspond with all the intri cacies of harmonic sounds. In the diagrams the circles are not drawn as interlacing into each other, from the difficulty of representing them accurately as risi ng spirally in geometric progression. If we endeavour to realise the development of harmonies , both in geometric order, and at the same time advancing and retiring, a s in musical clef, we must imagine a musician having the physical power of striki ng all the notes on a circular keyed instrument of seven octaves, linked to a lower series of seven octaves, and a corresponding series of seven higher. But in f act the depth of the lower series, and the height of the higher, are alike unfath omable to our present powers. C, the first note of the seven octaves, sounds the four low est tones, F, G, A, B of the lower series; and B, the last and highest note of the seven octaves, sounds in its harmony C \u0003 and D \u0001 of the higher series of sevens.

I only touch upon light as the acting energy or life, causing, in i ts struggles with darkness, not only the varieties of colour around us, but the colour ev en of light itself, as colours arise from rays of light exercising different infl uences. The primitive laws of any science should be capable of succi nct statement, but in combination with others they become more complex and delicate, and error is proved if in the developments they do not echo each other. If, therefore, musical harmonies are correctly gained, the same laws will develope ha rmonies of colour, and will agree with the colours of the rainbow, the circle of whi ch is divided by the horizon. All who are interested in the laws which regulate these two sciences will doubtless know the interesting lectures delivered by W.F .

We believe the following considerations will show, not only that it has some foundation, but that the analogy is far more wonderful than has hithert o been "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"HARMONIES COMPARED WITH COLOURS. 19 ————————————————————————————————————————————————— suspected. Let us take as our standard of colours the series given by the dis- integration of white light, the so-called spectrum: as our sta ndard of musical notes, let us take the natural or diatonic scale. We may justly com pare the two, for the former embraces all possible gradations of simple colour s, and the latter a similar gradation of notes of varying pitch. Further, the succession of colours in the spectrum is perfectly harmonious to the eye. Their invar iable order is— red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet; any other arrangeme nt of the colours is less enjoyable. Likewise, the succession of notes i n the scale is the most agreeable that can be found. The order is—C, D, E, F, G, A, B; any attempt to ascend or descend the entire scale by another orde r is disagreeable. The order of colours given in the spectrum is exactly the order of luminous wave- lengths, decreasing from red to violet. The order of notes in the scale is also exactly the order of sonorous wave-lengths, decreasing from C to B.\" \"Now comes the important question—Are the intermediate colours of the spec trum produced by vibrations that bear a definite ratio to the vibrations giving ri se to the intermediate notes of the scale? According to our knowledge up to this time, a pparently not.\" \"Comparing wave-lengths of light with wave-lengths of sound—not, of course, their actual lengths, but the ratio of one to the other—the following remarkable correspondence at once comes out:—Assuming the note C to correspond t o the colour red, then we find that D exactly corresponds to orange, E to yellow, and F to green. Blue and indigo, being difficult to localise, or even distinguish in the spectrum, they are put together; their mean exactly corr esponds to the note G: violet would then correspond to the ratio given by the note A. The colours having now ceased, the ideal position of B and the upper C are calc ulated from the musical ratio.\" This quotation on vibrations will be seen to ag ree with the laws which I have gained. The fact that six of the notes of k eyed instruments are obliged to act two parts, must prevent the intermediate not es bearing a definite ratio of vibrations with the intermediate colours of the spectr um. I name the note A as violet, and B ultra-violet, as it seemed to me clear er not to mention the seventh as a colour. The fountain or life of musical harmonies and colours is E, or y ellow; the root B, or ultra-violet: these being, in fact, tints and sha des of white and black. Ascending, they partake more of white; descending, of blac k: the former drawing tones and colours higher, the latter lower.

G contains all tones. Blue , with more or less of black and white. A=G and B mingled. Violet= blue, and all colours, inclining to black. B, the key-note of the fountain. Ultra-violet =violet mingled with more black: a deeper shade of all colours—in its extreme, black. Notes and colours are thus condensed into a pair springing from the fountain, and mingling with each other in an endless variety. Althoug h yellow as a colour is explained away as white, it is, nevertheles s, the colour yellow in endless tints and shades throughout nature, and proves to us that the three great apparent primaries correspond to the tonic chord of the scale of C— i.e. , C, E, G = red, yellow, blue; or more correctly, C and G correspond to red and bl ue with the central fountain of E, white and black mingled, from which all tones and colours arise. The tones between the seven white notes of keyed instruments, and the tints and shades between the seven colours, cause the multequi valency of colours and of tones; consequently every colour, as every musical harmony , has the capability of ascending or descending, to and fro in circles, or a dvancing and retiring in musical clef. It is a curious coincidence that W ünsch, nearly one hundred years ago, believed in his discovery of the primary colours to be red, green, and violet; and in this scheme, red, answering to the note C, must necessarily be the first visible colour, followed by green a nd violet, but these not as primary colours, all colours in turn becoming primaries and secondaries in the development of the various harmonies. To gain facts by experim ent, the colours must be exactly according to natural proportions—certain propor tions producing white, and others black. In this scheme, green and red are shown to be a complementary pair, and therefore (as Clerk Maxwell has pr oved) red and green in right proportions would produce yellow. The same fact has b een proved in Lord Rayleigh's experiments with the spectroscope.

The development into triplets or trinities has been especial ly remarked in the harmony caused by the falls of Niagara.* \"A remarkable pe culiarity in the Arabian system of music is the division of tones into thirds . I have heard Egyptian musicians urge against the European systems of music t hat they are deficient in the number of sounds. These small and delicate gradation s of sound give a peculiar softness to the performances of the Arab musicians.\" \"Their music is of a style very difficult for foreigners to acquire or imitate, but the children very easily and early attain it. I low much the Arabs profited by the works of ancient Greek writers is well known.\" † As knowledge increases, may not the beginning of every physical s cience be traced first as a trinity springing from a trinity in unity , followed by a second partaking of the nature of the first, so as to unite with it in complementary pairs as here described in tones and colours, trinity in unity being t he germ of never- ending developments? The inequality of the equinoctial points is a well-known fact. It will be seen how apparent this is in the developments of harmonies. F rom the moment that trinities depart from unity, the balance is unequal, and the repeated endeavours after closer union cause a perpetual restlessness. May not this want of equilibrium be the life or motive power of the entire universe, with its continuous struggle after concord, even to oneness? \"Closer and closer union is the s oul of perfect harmony.\" In tracing harmonies of tones and colours, the double tones of keyed instruments will be seen to correspond with the intermediate tin ts and shades of colours. The twelve notes, scales, and chords in the major and minor series, the meetings by fifths, &c., all agree so exactly in their mode of de velopment, that if a piece of music is written correctly in colours with t he intermediate tints and shades, the experienced musician can, as a rule, detect errors more quickly and surely with the eye than the ear, and the correct eye, e ven of a non-musical person, may detect technical errors. Although the arithmetical relation has been most useful in gaining the laws, it is not here entered upon; but numbers equally meet all the intricacies both of tones and colours. The bass not es have been omitted, in order to simplify the scheme. ————————————————————————————————————————————————— * See Scribner's Monthly Magazine , No. 81, page 583. †Lane's Modern Egyptians , vol. ii. p. 64.

The twelve which develope twelve major harmonies are writt en thus \u0004 , the other six which are incapabable of developing major harmonies thus  , without regard to musical time. The seven colours are shown to answer to the seven white notes, the other five being intermediate tones and colours. A f lat marked to a note indicates that it is nearer to the tone or colour below; a sha rp means that it is nearer to the tone or colour above. The notes and chasms are not written according to accurately measured degrees. The diagram begins with C, the third space of the treble clef , as being more convenient to write than C, the lowest note in the bass clef. T he life of musical sounds rising from a hidden fountain of life is shown by the chasms of keyed instruments between B and C, and E and F; their great use will be strikingly manifest as the developments proceed. The fundamental key-note C a nd its root F rise from the chasms. B, the twelfth key-note, and E, its root, sound the octave higher of the fountain B. The generation of harmonies is by one law a simple mode of difference. Each major key-note and its tones embrace the eighteen tones of keyed instruments which all lie in order for use. The pow er and extent of each are complete in itself, rising and developing, not from any inheren t property in matter, but from the life communicated to matter. In the whole process of harmony there are limits, and yet it is illimitable. Its laws compel each key-note to follow certain rules within certain bounds; each separate k ey-note, being the fountain of its own system, has its own point of rest, and series a fter series rise and enlarge, or fall and diminish infinitely.

DIAGRAM II.—THE TWELVE KEY-NOTES, EACH DEVELOPI NG ITS SIX TONES IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY SOUND. \"Nature's universal law is progress with self-adapt ation.\" I N tracing the origin of a harmony, or family of sounds, all divisions m ust come out of the one, or unit . Two powers are at work—cohesion and separation; a truth continually dwelt upon by the Greek philosophers. In the diagr am, the note C may be considered as central, or as placed with four tones below and two above itself. A key-note developing its harmony may be compared to a seed strik ing its root downwards, and rising upwards. On striking a note, it sounds from within itself, in a rapid and subdued manner, the six kindred tones necessary to its harmony, and all which do not belong to that individual harmony are kept unde r; thus all harmonies are in sevens. Each seven forms an asce nding and descending series; the ear is aware of the tones, but not of the order in which they r ise. The arrangement of a key-note and the six tones which it sounds may be simply explained by writing tones in a musical clef as notes . In this diagram we have the harmony of C and its root F. Both of these rise f rom the chasms, and hence this harmony is not so closely linked to that of B, a nd its root E, as to the other eleven harmonies. The first trinity of sounds (hereafter called the Primaries ) rise veering from left to right; the second trinity (hereafter called the Secondaries) follow, veering from right to left. The life of sound always causes a variety of movement to and fro. The three lowest of the six tones are complementary pairs with the key-note and its two highest tones. Observe the curious order in which the tones sound, avoiding consecutive fifths. First, we have the key-note and its root, or fellow; next A; then D and its root; and then E, whose root, A, has already s ounded between the first and the second pair. B, the fourth and central t one in depth, sounds seventh, and, finding no fellow within the compass of the harmony developing it, is isolated. Observe also how closely a key-note and its kindred tones are linked into each other. The Primaries spring from the key-notes, the Secondaries from the Primaries; the first pair comprises a key-note and a tone of the Primaries, the other two pairs have each a tone of the Primaries and a tone of the Secondaries. The key-note, after giving out its tones in trinities, or "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"24 HARMONIES OF TONES AND COLOURS. ————————————————————————————————————————————————— combinations of dissonance, rests, sounding neither scale nor chords. Dissonance does not express opposition or separation, for there is no principle in musical tones which is productive of contraries; the dissonances follow the at traction of the tonic, or key-note, and the neutralisation of the musical disturbance i s implied in the disagreement in their motion with the repose of the unit, or key- note. So far is this from producing separation, that the apparent discord is simply a preparation for growth, the life of harmony causing an inherent tendency towards closer uni on. We here trace the twelve harmonies developing in succession. Notice how exactly they all agree in their mode of development; also the use of the chasms between E and F, B and C. Remark also the beautiful results from the working of the double tones, especially C \u0001 -D \u0002 , and E \u0001 -F \u0002 , causing the seven tones of each harmony, when ascending, to rise one tone, and, descending, to rever se this movement. F \u0001 -G \u0002 is the only double tone which acts as F \u0001 when a key-tone, and G \u0002 when the root of D \u0002 . The root of each harmony is the sixth and highest tone in each succeeding harmony, rising one octave; when it is a double tone, it sounds according to the necessity of the harmony. The intermediate tones are here coloured, showing gradual modulation. The isolated fourths (sounding sevent hs) were the previously developed key-tones; these also alter when the y are double tones, according to the necessity of the harmony. Beginning with B, the isolated fourth in the harmony of C, the tones sound the twelve notes of a keye d instrument, E \u0001 being F \u0003 , and the double tones, some flats, some sharps. Examine C \u0001 in musical clef as an example of double tones only developing each one major harmony. C \u0001 sounds neither B nor E, but C and C \u0001 , F and F \u0001 . The only exception is the double tone F \u0001 -G \u0002 , which is a curious study. F \u0001 as a harmony takes the double tones as sharps, and F \u0003 is E \u0001 . G \u0002 is also a harmony sounding the same tones, by taking the double tones as flats, an d B \u0003 as C \u0002 . F \u0001 therefore takes the imperfect tone of E \u0001 , and G \u0002 the imperfect tone of C \u0002 . (See here the harmony of G \u0002 in musical clef.) In the same way are written the two last primaries of a series of twelve, which began with C. A higher series of twelve follows, and the f irst two primaries of a still higher series of twelve. The secondaries are written bel ow the primaries. We find that on a keyed instrument each primary sounds the same ton es as the secondaries of each third harmony below, but in a different order, and the double tones are altered sharp or flat as the harmony requires . For example, the secondaries of B are sharps; when primaries of D \u0002 , they are flats. In order to trace this quickly, the sharps and flats are written to each note. In any series of twelve, the primaries of the two first k ey-notes repeat the secondaries of the two last of a lower series of twelve; and the two last secondaries of the twelve in development are sounded as the two first primari es of a higher series of twelve.

The second is a continuation of the first circle. The seven previously developed key-notes are now the r oots of seven higher key-notes. The intermediate notes are not coloured, but may be seen to be complementary pairs. In the musical clef, the sixth and seventh notes from the fundament al key-note C (F and \u0001 F) are repeated, so that the use of the two poles ( \u0001 F and \u0002 G may be clearly seen, and that the notes and colours precisely agree. In the progression of harmonies these are always closely linked into each other.

If we add the silent notes, the root of the central note is the e ighth below, and becomes the root of the eighth above. To explain the lower series of the notes sounding the six tones from within themselves, the only plan appeared to be to write the tones as notes in musical clef.

T HE term \"key\" will now be employed in the ordinary sense of the m usician, as a note which keeps all those other notes under subjection which do not belong to its harmony. A good ear requires that the first note struc k should govern and regulate the rest, carrying on the intricacies of the key through the seven octaves ascending and descending. The twelve key-notes, with the six notes of each as they veer r ound in trinities, are again written in musical clef, and the scales added. The k ey-note leads the scale, and, after striking the two next highest notes of the sev en of the harmony, goes forward, with its four lowest, an octave higher. The seven of each harmony have been traced as the three lowest, thus meeting the three h ighest in three pairs, the fourth note being isolated. Notwithstanding the curious revers al of the three and four of the scale, the three lowest pair with the three h ighest, and the fourth with its octave. The four pairs are written at the end of e ach line, and it will be seen how exactly they all agree in their mode of developm ent. Keys with sharps and keys with flats are all mingled in twelve successive notes. If we strike the twelve scales ascending as they follow each other, each thir teenth note being octave of the first note of the twelve that have developed, and first of the rising series, the seventh time the scales gradually rise into the higher seri es of seven octaves beyond the power of the instrument. Descending is ascending reversed. Af ter the seven and octave of a scale have been sounded ascending, the ear seems to lead to the descending; but ten notes of any scale may be struck without the ne cessity of modulation; at the seventh note we find that the eleventh note in the progression of harmonics rises to meet the seventh.

DIAGRAM V.—THE CHORDS OF THE TWELVE MAJOR KEY S. \"A threefold cord is not quickly broken.\"— Eccles . iv. 12. \"What is beauty but the aptitude of parts harmoniou s?\"— Southey . O N a keyed instrument only twelve are major key-notes, but as the double tones C \u0001 -D \u0002 and F \u0001 -G \u0002 are roots, there are fourteen different chords. The fourteen that are roots are written in musical clef. As an exampl e of the major chords in the different keys, we may examine those in the key of C. A ma jor fifth includes five out of the seven of its key; with the third or central note it is the threefold chord, or fourfold when the octave note is added. Including the silent key-notes, a threefold chord embraces eight, or, counting the double tones, not inc luding E \u0001 , eleven. The first and second chords of the seven of the harmony a re perfect major chords in the key of C; the central note of the third chord, being \u0001 C- \u0002 D, is a discord. The first pair of fifths in the scale, with its central not e, is a chord of the key; if we include the octave, the last pair of fifths, with its cent ral note, is the same chord an octave higher than the lowest chord of the seven. Of the chords written in musical clef of the twelve keys, the octave chord is only wr itten to C, the seven of each having two chords and the scale one, thirty-six in all , or forty-eight if the octave chords are added. Notice how the chords of each seven and the chord of its scale are altered. If the chords of the twelve keys and the thirteenth octave are s truck, all agree in their method of development. We see here the order in whi ch the chords are repeated, and the working of the double tones. As an example of t he latter, we may trace the chords belonging to the key of D \u0002 , and compare them with those belonging to the key of F \u0001 , also the first chord in the key of A \u0002 . The fourth note in depth, sounded last of the seven of each harmony, has been seen as preparing for the chords; it prepares equally for the scale, and the sc ale for the chords, the octave chord of the scale, ascending, preparing for the latte r to descend.

T HE twelve keys have been traced following each other seven tim es through seven octaves, the keys mingled, the thirteenth note being the octave, and becoming first of each rising twelve. Thus developing, the seven notes of each eighth key were complementary pairs, with the seven notes of each eighth key below , and one series of the twelve keys may be traced, all meeting in succession, not mingled. When the notes not required for each of the twelve thus meeting are kept under, the eighths of the twelve all meet by fifths, and as before, in succ ession, each key increases by one sharp, the keys with flats following, each decr easing by one flat; after this, the octave of the first C would follow and be gin a higher series. It is most interesting to trace the fourths, no longer isolated, but meeting each other, having risen through the progression of the keys to higher harm onies. In the seven of C, B is the isolated fourth, meeting F \u0001 , the isolated fourth in the key of G, and so on. Each ascending key-note becomes the root of the fi fth key-note higher; thus C becomes the root of G, &c. In the retrogression of harmonies, a key-note and its trinities , by sounding the same tones as when ascending, leads the ear to the same not es, and the root of each key-note becomes the fifth lower key-note. F, the root of C, becomes key-note; B \u0002 , the root of F, the next key-note, and so on. The following table shows the regularity of each seven of the twelve key-notes ascending by fifths, and the use of the two poles is agai n seen. The key-notes and their trinities are closely linked into each ot her, the three highest notes of the lower fifth key becoming the three lowest of the higher fifth key, and the four lowest becoming the four highest in an octave higher. The twelve keys, rising in each note a tone higher and descending a t one lower, cause the meetings by fifths.

A constant difficulty arises in explaining the development of tone s and colours, from the fact that the ascending notes on a keyed instrument are descending lines in musical clef, and the ascending lines in musical clef in the retrogression of fifths must be gained by beginning below and following them upwards.

The reversal of the three and four no tes of each seven of the twelve key-notes and their trinities meeting by fifths having been traced, we will now examine the twelve scales meeting by fifths, and the results arising from the reversal of the three and four notes of each fifth lower scale in the fifth higher. Take as an example the scale of C: C D E F G A B, and that of G: G A B C D E F \u0001 . The four lowest notes of the seven of C are the four highest, an octave higher, in G; F, the central and isolated note of the se ven of C, having risen a tone higher than the octave in the scale of G. The t welve scales thus modulate into each other by fifths, which sound the same harmonies a s the key-notes and their trinities. Refer to the twelve scale s written in musical clef ascending by fifths, and strike them, beginning at the lowest C i n the bass clef; this scale sounds no intermediate tones, but these must be struck as required for all the scales to run on in fifths. After striking the sev en notes of C, if we fall back three, and repeat them with the next four notes of the seven; or strike the seven and octave of C, and fall back four, repeating them and striking the next four, the four last notes of each scale will be found to be alwa ys in the harmony of the four first of the fifth higher scale.

DIAGRAM VIII.—ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TWELVE MINO R HARMONIES. \"Thou brooding Spirit! Lord and giver of life, Whose quickening force setteth the quivering puls e In every living thing.\"— Rev. John Andrew . T HE term \"key\" in the minor developments must be taken in the sense in which it is understood by musicians, although it will be seen that it is only the seven of the harmony that are the relative minor keys of the majors, the scales with their chords sounding other keys. The grandeur, combined with simpl icity, of the laws which develope musical harmonies are strikingly e xhibited in the minor keys. Although at first they appear most paradoxical, and, comparing them with the majors, we may almost say contradictory in their laws of development, when they are in some degree understood, the intricacies disappear, and the twelve keys follow each other (with the thirteenth octave), all exactly ag reeing in their mode of development. I shall endeavour to trace them as much as possibl e in the same manner as the majors, the lowest developments of the minor keys being notes with scales and chords, the notes always sounding their major harmonies in tones. Here an apparently paradoxical question arises. If the major keys are gained by the notes sounding the major tones, how are the minor keys obtained? Strictly speaking, there are no minor key-notes: the development of a minor harmony is but a mode of succession within the octave, caused by each minor key-note employing the sharps or flats of the fourth major key-note higher; and with this essential difference, it will be seen in how many points the developments of major and minor harmonics agree. I have carefully followed the same laws, and if any capable mind examines the results, I am prepared for severe c riticism. I can only express that it was impossible to gain any other results than the seven of the harmony, the ascending and the descending scale and the chords combinin g three different keys. Round the circle the eighteen tones of keyed instruments are shown; the twelve developing perfect minor keys are written thus \u0004 , the seven white-keyed notes are coloured, the intermediate tones left uncoloured."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"THE MINOR HARMONIES. 33 ————————————————————————————————————————————————— Probably the lowest harmony which we have the power of partially hearing is A minor, rising in the lower series of seven octaves; C, i ts highest note, sounding the six tones of C, its major harmony, on our horizon of sound.

Bowring . A S an example of the twenty-four, compare A major, developing, in Diag ram II., with A minor, Diagram IX., taking the notes in the order which th ey sound in trinities. The three notes of the primaries sounded by A minor are, first, the same root as the major; the two next are the fourth and seve nth higher notes (in the major, the fifth and sixth); the secondaries only vary by t he sixth and seventh notes being a tone lower than in their relative major. Observe the order in which the pairs unite; the fourth in depth, sounded seventh, isolated. A and it s root do not rise from the chasms. The fundamental key-note C was seen not to be interfered with, neither is the fundamental minor key-note A; G \u0001 on the one side, and B \u0002 on the other, being the key-notes. The seven of each minor harmony embrace only seventeen tones. C major and A minor are the only two keys which sound the seven white notes of keyed instruments. The minor scale and chords of A are not included in this remark. When the twelve minor harmonies are traced developing in successi on, we notice how exactly they all agree in their method of developm ent, also the use of the chasms and the double tones, the seven of each harmony rising a tone when ascending, but reversing the movement in descending; keys with s harps and those with flats are mingled.

T HE same laws are followed here as in the development of the majo r scales. In that of A, F, the sixth note, has risen to F \u0001 , in order to meet B, which has previously sounded. In descending, the seventh note, B, falls to B \u0002 , in order to meet F, which has also previously sounded. The notes, ascending or descending, always follow the harmony of their key-note, except when rising higher or falling lower to meet in fifths. We may here trace the twelve, the ascending scale sounding the fifth harmony higher than its key-note, and, in descending, sounding the fifth lower harmony.

A LTHOUGH only twelve notes of a keyed instrument develope perfect minor harmonics, there are fifteen different chords, the double tones D \u0001 -E \u0002 , E \u0001 -F \u0003 , A \u0001 -B \u0002 all sounding as roots.

A major seventh includes twelve key-notes, a minor seventh only eleven. As an example of t he minor chords in the different keys, we may first examine those in the key of A, written in musical clef. The seven of its harmony have two threefold chords, and two of its ascending scale.

DIAGRAM XV.—THE TWELVE MAJOR AND THE TWELVE M INOR KEYS ARE HERE RETRACED. \"Others shall right the wrong, Finish what I begin, And all I fail of, win.\"— Whittier. T O recapitulate from the beginning, observe, firstly, the twelve ma jor key-notes as they have developed from within themselves in succession, six tones in trinities seven times through seven octaves, each thirteent h note being the octave of the first note of the twelve that have developed, and being al so the first of the higher series. We may retrace all as still sounding their tones , the key-notes leading the ear to the six notes of each harmony, the keys with sharps and those with flats being mingled. The ascending and descending scales a lways agree in their harmonies with the key-notes and their trinities. Secondly, we have the one series of the twelve keys as they meet by fifths through the seven octaves. The keys are no longer mingled; the scales meet by fifths in the same keys and their trinities. Thirdly, the twelve minor keys as they develope in succession s even times through seven octaves, always sounding their major harmony in trinit ies, and, as with the majors, each thirteenth note being the octave of the f irst note of the twelve, and first of the following series, the keys all mingled. Fourthly, we have one series of the seven of each of the twel ve minor keys meeting by fifths through seven octaves. The keys of the twelv e ascending scales are written in musical clef above the former, and the keys of the descending scales below. The ascending scales sound the fifth higher harmonies than t he key-notes and their trinities, and the lower scales the fifth harmony low er than the key-notes and their trinities. The three series follow out their keys i n three successive series, and all meet by fifths. The chords always agree in their harmonies, and thus the close un ion of all is seen. The corresponding harmonies of tones and colours are als o shown."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The 12 Major Keys as they rise mingled, with the 13th octave.

And heaven-born music, as Thine ordinance in air and ear, and in The balance of the force elastic, with The gravitating force that holdeth all,— Music the statute is, which more than most, Of all that stands on Nature's statute-book, Image and superscription—Three in one— In interlacing monogram doth show of Thee!\" Rev. John Andrew. T HE above quotation from that beautiful work, The Pendulograph , shows how firmly its author believes that the Almighty Himself wil l be proved to be the key to His works; a belief frequently expressed also in a striking work, Nature and the Supernatural , by the Rev. J. W. Reynolds, M.A. For many years I have been endeavouring to resolve some of the intricaci es of natural harmony with the same views. In the pursuit of knowledge it is e minently important to \"avoid profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called\" (I Tim. vi. 20), and to remember that facts gained f rom the study of God's marvellous works, that \"ought to be had in remembrance\" (Psa. cxi. 4, Prayer Book Version), and the truths of Holy Scripture, ca n never really oppose each other. Research shows us countless varieties develope d by trinities springing from unities, and we find true scientific depth in the S criptural phrases, where the whole earth is continually mentioned as worshipping t he Almighty. This truth is beautifully expressed in the Te Deum Laudamus —\"Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty; heaven and earth are full of Thy glory.\" With our present powers the darkness of ignorance is ever groping a fter the light of knowledge. If the field is so vast when we merely attempt to harmonise the laws which regulate the visible creation, it widens indefinitely when we attempt to harmonise, by the same laws, Creation with the Scriptures. \"God is light,\" and with His Holy Spirit for our teacher, ever y line of His word instructs us; \"like the ocean, the word remains essentially t he same, while the light never plays upon its surface without deepening and varying i ts hues.\" "},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"44 HARMONIES OF TONES AND COLOURS. ————————————————————————————————————————————————— \"The real animating power of knowledge fills us with wonder and joy ; a joy for which, observe, ignorance is just as necessary as the present know ledge. The man is always happy who is in the presence of something which he c annot know to the full, which he is always going on to know. This is the ne cessary condition of finite creatures with divinely rooted and divinely dire cted intelligence; this, therefore, its happy state—but observe, a state not of triumph or j oy in what he knows, but of joy rather in the continual discovery of new ignorance, conti nual self-abasement, continual astonishment.\"— Ruskin. \"Adore with steadfast unpresuming gaze, Him, Nature's essence, mind, and energy.\" Coleridge . \"Speak, ye who best can tell, ye sons of light, Angels, for ye behold Him, and with songs And choral symphonies, day without night, Circle His throne rejoicing; ye in heaven, On earth, join all ye creatures, to extol Him first, Him last, Him midst, and without end.\" Milton—Paradise Lost, Book V . If we examine the line last quoted by the laws of life which r egulate the foregoing scheme, we may compare it with the fundamental three fold chord of the scale of C and its relative colours, C E G C red rises RED. YELLOW. BLUE. from the fountain key-note which contains in itself all tones. \"H im first,\" the Son of God proceeding from the Almighty, and yet in Himself the T rinity in Unity. E, yellow or light. E is the root of B, ultra indigo, or bl ack. \"Him midst,\" the Almighty Father, the Fountain of life, light gradual ly rising and dispelling darkness. G, blue, \"Him last,\" the Holy Spirit, proce eding from the Father and the Son, Trinity in Unity. The Son of God and the Holy Spi rit are the complemental working pair throughout the universe; each containi ng \"the seven spirits of life.\" Red and blue contain all colours in eac h. C and G are a complemental pair, C rising from the fountain key-note which conta ins in itself all tones, and C and G combine all tones in each. In Chapter III. it is explained that all varieties of tones and colours may be condensed into thi s pair, rising from and falling again into the fountain. If we strike any major threefold chord, and directly afterw ards its relative minor, we may notice how they respond to the twofold natures within us of joy and melancholy. \"Joy and melancholy, virtue and vice, are as much the consequence s of natural law as the falling of a stone or the growth of a flower.\"— C. Watts."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"MILTON, HOOD, SHAKSPERE, &c. 45 ————————————————————————————————————————————————— \"Joy and grief are woven fine, A clothing for the soul divine.\" Blake. \"All things are touched with melancholy, Born of the secret soul's mistrust To feel her fair ethereal wings Weighed down with vile degraded dust. There is no music in the life That sounds with idiot laughter solely; There's not a string attuned to mirth, But has its chord in melancholy.\" Thomas Hood. The armies of Faith and Science, instead of fighting side by si de, too often oppose each other, and as the Archbishop of York remarked in his spe ech at the last meeting of the Christian Evidence Society, \"The undue dispo sition on the part of Science to come into conflict with Religion, stirs up, on the part of Religion and religious men, a disposition to quarrel with Science.\" Indeed we all deeply need more solemn feelings of our own littleness, and the greatness of our Almighty Creator. \"Study is like the heaven's glorious sun, That will not be searched out by saucy looks.\" Shakspere. All the energies of nature are the results of Divine operat ions flowing from the fountain of life, and all the forces of nature are the forces of li fe. \"Science has a foundation, and so has Religion: let them unite thei r foundations, and the basis will be broader, and they will be two compar tments of one great fabric reared to the glory of God.\"— M'Cosh . \"Science and Revelation are mutually, though gradually, clearing e ach other; but as a little warmth of the rising sun only calls up the very mists which are to be dissipated by its more powerful shining, so a vague and chilling popular unbelief is to be dispelled, not by withholding knowledge, but by shedding a broad all possible light. Christianity has one most dangerous mental f oe, and that is ignorance.\" Ignorance is the parent of Atheism; but we should car efully distinguish between \"sinful doubt\" and candid inquiry, the former of which general ly arises from a too great love of, and belief in, our own mental powers. \"Sinful doubts are traitors, And make us lose the good we oft might win, By fearing to attempt them.\" Shakspere.

I gladly confess that my ruling wish has been to feel my own ignor ance deeply, and to trust to the Divine Teacher that my eyes might be opened to see more and more the wonders which may be drawn from the Scriptures, w hen scientific minds are led to the belief that Creation and Revel ation explain each other. As this conviction gains ground, scientific truths will ma ke a more rapid progress, and \"the generalisation of Science will no longer be doubtf ul, but assured.\" \"Our aim is to promote that agreement by showing the correspondence between truly scientific conclusions and Holy Writ; by making it plain that scientific truths, like spiritual, have for ever been descending from heaven to man.\"— J. W. Reynolds, M.A. \"In Him we live, and move, and have our being,\"— Acts xvii. 28. Spontaneous life has no existence: whatever is developed below, deri ves its life from the laws which regulate it from above. Among the many subjects which excite interest at the present time is the question whether the doctrine of Evolution is true or false. Mil ton had evidently some glimpse of its truth, as we see in the following lines:— \"Air and ye elements! the eldest birth Of Nature's womb, that in quaternion run Perpetual circle, multiform, and mix And nourish all things; let your ceaseless change Vary to our great Maker still new praise!\" Paradise Lost , Book V. If the foregoing harmonies of sound and of colour have been rightly developed from the Scriptures, I trust they will be considered as s teps gained towards the belief that Evolution is the law of the Almighty for the continuance of activity throughout the universe, and towards an increasing study of Creation and Revelation as mutually explaining each other. According to m y belief, the Scriptures must be based on the principle which is explaine d of keyed instruments at the conclusion of Chapter II. In the development of musical har monies the beginning and the ending are unfathomable. It is the same in the Scr iptures. No musical note or colour can be separated from those below and abov e it. Neither can any portion of the Bible be separated: every part embraces the past, "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"SCRIPTURE COMPARED WITH SCRIPTURE. 47 ————————————————————————————————————————————————— the present, and the future, developing in geometric progression ; as the past retires, the future advances. The rests in harmony correspond wi th silence in the Scriptures, both limiting and illimitable. But there is this essential difference: musical instruments can only be tuned to a certain pitch, wherea s the Bible will never need fresh editions or corrections, but as it always has unfolded, it always will unfold, as it is necessary to meet our higher mental powe rs. I believe that, eventually, scientific minds will arrive at the conclus ion that all the energies around us arise from the laws which regulate the life of matt er, and cause the continual development of trinities from unities. Continuity ever ywhere adapts simple laws to wondrous workings. If we evade the belief in the development of trinities, this scheme falls to the ground. We can conceiv e no grander idea of the power, wisdom, and love of the Parent of the universe th an that of His following out His own characteristics, knowing that at any moment, if His life- giving power were withdrawn, all would crumble into dust. Let us link with this thought these glorious promises— \"The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God s hall stand for ever.\"— Isa . xl. 8. \"For I am the Lord: I will speak, and the word that I shall s peak shall come to pass.\"— Ezek. xii. 25. \"For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received i t not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually wor keth also in you that believe.\"— I Thess . ii. 13. \"Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed.\"— Prov . xiii. 13.

J. HUGHES. A FTER I had sent this work to the publisher, I looked ov er letters addressed to me by the late Dr. Gauntlett. They show so much interest in the scheme, that I publish extracts from them. 1867.—\"Your plan of eliciting facts from Scripture (altogether new) interests me ex- ceedingly.\" \"To make out the scheme of harmonical parallel proper for the elucidation of your system, it will, if possible, run all true with the harmony of colour, and this has never yet been clone, except in a way which has been met with serious objections. When I commenced the examination of your theory, I spent five days a t the British Museum, and collated about forty volumes.\" \"I am very glad to hear you have a probability of harmonising numbers by the same laws as light and sound.\" \"Wha t you call rest, I call the appearance and disappearance of a harmonical cycle.\" \"Your se ries of fifths is quite correct.\" 1871.—\"There has been much written lately respectin g colour and tone, but nothing bearing on your own view.\" \"The new theories in mu sic seem inclined to go back to the ancient faith of Pythagoras, everything being used up with the modern notions of tonality. Perhaps we may find a great change at hand; the pre sent system, limiting, as it does, that which is illimitable, cannot be right.\" 1872.—\"It gives me great pleasure to write to you o n this subject. Music deals more with the imaginative faculty than any other art or science, and possessing, as it does, the power of affecting life, and making great multitudes feel as one, may have more than ordinary sympathy with the laws you work upon. You say 'from E, root of B, the fountain key-note F, root of C, rises.' There is a singular analogy here in the relativities of sounds, as traced by comparing the numbers made together by vibrations of strings with the length of strings themselves, the one is the inverse or the counterchange of the other. The length of B and E are the counterchange of F and C, hence they are twin sound s in harmony.\" 1873.—\"It seems to me, from so many curious coincid ences, that truth lies within, the system.\" \"I by no means resign the possibility of being able to satisfy myself.\" \"There is no insuperable objection that I can see.\" \"Your theor y of the illimitable nature of tones, the limits of six as a one complete and perfect view, and the simplicity of the three pairs, dwell much on my mind. I believe it to be quite new, and in o ne way or the other quite true.\" 1874.—\"I have been intending to write to you with a full scheme, your scheme so differs from any put forth in these modern days. Like all t heories—for there is no exception—my plan does not come up to clear demonstration. It is lik e the colour theory. No doubt simplicity "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"EXTRACTS FROM DR.

When I say my plan , I talk in the old groove, and there are difficulties to be smoothed, but in a way that might be much grumbled over. One very curious thing is plain: your system meets many of the cases on which our present theorists stumble so awfully. I saw this f rom the first time I had the pleasure of considering it with you, and on this account never relished the idea of giving it up; and the more thought bestowed on it led to its applicabilit y to the more ancient forms of melody—the little tunes of the old world in the East. These a re said to be independent of harmony, but your system is perfect harmony. The latest theoris ts in Paris are all at war with the old theory, and there is now a petition lying before the govern ing powers of the Paris Academy of Music, praying for a total change in the teaching of harmo ny in that metropolis; and this memorial has been signed by all the rising celebrities in th e musical world there. I really believe the best mode, after all, is the series of six tones—the two trinities; and the law of 'to and fro' is impregnable. That is all right. I should like that term to get into vogue, for it is much more plain and clear than what we call the inverse and reverse, or counterchange.\" \"The grave, or rather extraordinary result of your syste m is, that so much, very much of it tallies with what may be termed the commonly unknow n relatives of the tones. You offer affinities which are termed abstruse, and, although admitted, are accepted without demonstration. Why you should be able to explain the much-quarrell ed-over connections is beyond my com- prehension, and if I could discover the key, the re sult would be most important for the well- being of music. With this view your system always interests me. I suspect it lies in that wonderful adaptability of the order of numbers. With the artificial system, music is confined to a few single harmonical tones—none of which can ever be used without alteration—which we gently coax the ear into receiving.\" \"Your syst em runs up the shortest way, and I find it of advantage in composing.\" 1875.—\"It has often struck me that I have never bee n with you long enough at one time to grasp all your facts, so as to arrange them as a sequence, or set them as a chain. I should very much like to visit you, and hold a parl ance upon all knotty points. Just at this moment I am at work on three hymn-books.\" The proposed visit was overruled by the sudden deat h of Dr. Gauntlett in the following February. To show his generous and candid disposit ion, I may add that, after I had been for some weeks in London, and we had had much conversat ion, on my writing to him after my return home, asking, \"Will you kindly tell me what I owe you for your time?\" he replied, \"I cannot charge anything, for I often felt, as I w alked home, that I had learned more from you than you had from me.\" M"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"50 HARMONIES OF TONES AND COLOURS. ————————————————————————————————————————————————— FRAGMENTS FROM THE LAST NOTE-BOOK WRITTEN BY DR. GAUNTLETT, DATED JANUARY, 1876. Dr. Gauntlett's widow has lately lent me for perusa l his last note-book, and I feel sure that the extracts from it, which I give verbatim, w ith her permission, will create interest. \"All theory must be founded on one great fact—harmon y; for harmony is the chief beauty of two or more sounds heard together. There may be figure, schemata, and all other niceties of succession and combination; but if no h armony, the music is not beautiful. It is dim, dull, and disagreeable.\" \"Harmony must be looked at in two ways at least: first , up the score from bottom to top—the perpendicular view; second , along the score from side to side—the horizontal v iew. Then as to its periods or pulsations—its to and fro, its flow and ebb. This brings us to rhythm and measure. At the bottom of these lie wha t is called stress or accent—emission and remission—strong and weak: of these the bar in m odern music is an outward and visible sign of certain facts which ought to be in the musi c, but which, if not in the music, the presence of the bar is of no avail. The bar cannot give str ess or accent. 'Wherever there is time, there must be accent;'* but the tick of a clock has no ac cent. Hullah (or Chorley) should have said life.\" \"The semitone makes music. What opera tion has it upon the accent or to and fro? It creates the call, it supplies the answer.\" [This point, I believe, Dr. Gauntlett never alluded to with me, and I have feared that making n o difference between tones and semitones might be considered a difficulty with regard to the scheme. In the working of the natural laws of harmony, they must all equally be employed.— F. J. H .] \"Art (grand and true) does not depend upon the teaching of facts. The head is of less importance than the heart. Unless the tone of feeling, the habit and disposition, be well fixed, nothing enduring can come out of the misdirected artist.\" \"Teaching in song, teaching one another in song and grace —a double teaching.\" \"Beauty in art is not sensual or intellectual; trut h, heart-feeling.\" \"Teach music on some principle. Without a confessi on of Christianity, this music is mere discipline.\" \"Teach for some purpose—application, worship; not fo r pleasure's sake, recreation.\" \"Church music teaches church doctrine.\" \"Music worship—habitual exercise of—one of the great occupations of the next life.\" Dr. Gauntlett was looking forward to the honour of meeting His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh at the Mansion House, on February 22nd, 1876, regarding the formation of a new English College of Music, and the followin g notes were evidently the germ of what was passing in his mind on the views which he hoped to express. The reform and elevation of sacred music had been his life-long aim, and he was hoping, under royal sanction, to attain a wider hearing for his opinions. Providence inter rupted this plan by his sudden removal from the world the day before the meeting. \"The authorities in the City are interesting themse lves in the welfare of the new Musical School at South Kensington. Music is not simply a science, nor is it simply an art; it must be taught on some principle, for some definite purpose .\" \"It must be taught as it was taught in the —————————————————————————————————————— *See Hullah's Psalter."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"FRAGMENTS FROM DR.

So long as this principle was recognised in musical academies, ther e were composers of the highest class; devoid of it, the highest order of compositions disappeare d.\" \"Power over music does not depend solely on the mere agreement of 'how to do it.' Th e student in song will never learn the perfection of beauty except from the preparatio n of the heart. To make a real musician, there must be a sense of the ever-presence of the Creator of all beauty. The boy-musician must begin his day with prayer, and end it with praise. This made Handel, Bach, Haydn, and Mozart. Music is neither dram nor sweetmeat, neith er sensual nor intellectual. It is made so now; but in this order of music there is neither jo y nor love, thankfulness nor reverence.\" \"So long as music was taught primarily for worship, and to proclaim the immortality of man by the inestimable gift of the Royal Ransome r, it culminated to wonders upon wonders.\" \"Noble teachers yield noble teaching, and from such seed the reaping is noble music. To rear the musician with knightly, faithful, and pure feel ings, he must believe in his mission and its reward. The law of his life must be the advancemen t of his art, or rather God's art, given for the honour of the Deity and the elevation of humani ty.\" \"The Apostle Paul tells us that we are to teach one another in music, and the greatest doctor in theology, the mightiest defender of the Faith, has been the giant Handel in his orat orio of The Messiah. We are told that 'the nineteenth century is weary of the religion of Christ,' and the bright smile of the English boy and the sweet face of the English girl are no l onger to be gladdened by the teachings of the holy mystery. The Devil is the strongest op ponent to music in its right intention.\" I will close this Appendix with a remark once made to me by Dr. Gauntlett. I am sorry I forget where he said it occurred. \"After I had been for some time organist, one of the congregation said to me, 'When you first came, the tunes on the organ were loud and clear; now, the voices of the congregation almost drown th em.' I replied, 'That has been my aim —it should be so. When I began, the organ was neede d to lead the voices: I have been gradually subduing it, that the voices of praise sh ould be uppermost.'\" F. J.
