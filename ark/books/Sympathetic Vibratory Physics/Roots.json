In ot he r words mas s and ine r tia ar e results of thes e forces and may s ubsequent- ly be manipulated by manipulating the a li quot part s of the these for ce s (chords of vibr a t ions ) . And this is why I claim the Keely Mus i c al Dynas phere will, once ope r a t iona l , demons tr a t e vir tu- ally unlimited torque - at leas t for any practica l demonstration. How is this unli mited energy de- rived and fr om where? Re vi e wing Figur es 2 and 3 we can visualize a dynas phere of for c e rotating around the pe r iphery of an a xi s of a c entr a l iz ed vibrator y compl e x (par ticle). T his is much like holding a bicycle wheel by its axle while it spins r apidly. T he rapidly spinning whe el r es ists mot ion contrary to its orientation. We know thes e mode s always manifest in a tr iune configur a t ion theref ore we can fur ther extrapolate this spinning s hell as be i ng t hree in number w i th each rotating at extreme ve- locities 90° to each other. Given the pri nc ipl e s of gyr os copic m otion and ine r tia it can be under - stood how these s pi nning motions will create s ubstantial i ne r tia and r e sist movement f rom their pre- e stablishe d or ientation. Cons i de r ing thes e thr e e axis a r e 90° to ea ch other i t c an be imagined there i s a tremendous inertia i n three planes which r e sists motion in all dir e ctions with s ubstantial inertia. T his being the ca se - how can a nythi ng be moved? By modul a ti ng r hythmica l ly the s pi n and prece ss i on of the axis of ea ch of the spinning dyna- sphe r es . This is accomplishe d by using Amplitude or F reque ncy M odulation of the e i ge nf requen- cies via their aliquot pa r ts as dis cuss ed els ewhere in this pape r . T his modulation of the s pin and tri ple a xi s is the key to l iberation of immens e quantities of s o-called Fr ee Energy. M anipulations in other manners may eas ily be vis ulaized as to vary w hat a r e cons ider e d fundamental propert ie s of matter and e ner gy: mass , inertia, momentum, mol e cular and atomic weight, velocity, energy sta t e s, dir ec t ion, etc. T he manipulation of thes e properti e s is done by manipulating the aliquot parts of the vibr a t ory s i gna tur es .

It follows then that the s ound vibrations of this peridocially oscillating sca lar medium is com- pose d of a variety of aliquot pa r ts functi oning as a whole or ha vi ng a whole ef fec t . One set of vi- brator y parts ( dis cr e te tones or note s of the vibration s ignatur e ) manif e sts as an attr a ctive force (f oca li z ing to the center) which periodically interchange s with t he enharmonic s tate of radiation or pos se ssing a radial component. The dif ference s between the fir s t ha r monic s t a te and t he sec- ond enharmonic state are the individual tone s, notes or components of the vibr a ti on s ignatur e of the chord of mass (in t his case volume of air ).

We do not cons ider it a n end r e sult of something else although the se vibr a t ions a nd vibrator y ac- tions ar e emitted from a s ource and are in a ctuality, in their int roductory phas e, a res ult of the source' s vibration.

T his external drivi ng f orce i s the sympathetic vibration in its vibr atory ac ti vity. T he outside vi brating a ggr e- gate does nothing to the res onating receptive body a s ther e is no di rect contact between them. A media or method of contact is the vibrati ng media moving in a periodic f as hion. T his periodic motion, when in s ynch with the ca user and t he rece pt or of the vibr a ti ons , is the sympathe t ic as so- ciative mecha nism thr ough w hi c h pr opaga t e those vibrations s ym pa thetic to t he t hree vibrating bodies : i. e . , the cr e ative aggrega t e , the transmis sive media a nd the r ec eptive a ggr ega t e . For instance take two vibrating or os cill a ti ng objects. They ar e under s elf or natural resona nce (as are all obj e cts) conformi ng to the Law of H ar m onic Vib r at ions and produce a w ave train a s des cr ibe d above under the Law of Tr an s mi s sive V i braic Energy . T hey a r e putting out a s er ie s of harmonic wave s a r ithmetically relative to their f undame nt a l pitches. These waves radiate out- ward ac cor ding to the L aw of F or ce . T herefore we have the f irst obj e ct in a state of vibration creating a series of w aves that spee d outwa r d es t a bl is hing a modulation on the medium which surrounds thi s objec t. Thes e then, at this poi nt are the T rans m is sive Waves as they propagate out- ward. The sec ond objec t by virt ue of its natural res onance is therefor e s ubject to modulation ac- cording to the Law of Sym pathet ic Osc il lation as m e nti one d above . Due to the fact that the sec- ond obj e ct has vibr ati ons s ynchr onous with the wave s being cr eated and pr opagat e d by the fir st we say it is sympathetic to the fir st. T herefore the vibrations tr ave li ng to and from eac h object that ar e s ym pa thetic to each other are sympathetic vibr a t ions . T he vibrations themselves a r e sym- pathetic to the Creator obje ct and the Attr ac t or object. So whe r e in t he above definition there is ref e r e nce to the \"me chanical or acous ti c sys t e m\" and \" an adjace nt s ystem\" being two sys tems - in our more precise def inition we ac knowledge thr e e discrete s ystems a cting c oherentl y as one sy stem .

T he se latter ones being developed by the L aw of C ycles . Why there are disc or dant phas es or cyc les that ap- pear to spontane ously appear, mer ge , converge and pha se awa y is explained in the L aw of Cy- cles - \"C ohere nt aggr egates harmonically united c onstitute c enters of vibration bearing relation to the f undam ental pitch not multi ple s of the har monic pitch, and the production of secondar y unions betwe en thems elves ge nerate pitches that ar e di s cor ds, either in their unisons, or over- tones with the original pitch; f r om harm ony is gene rated disc ord, the inevitable caus e of perpet- ual t r ansfor mation. \" Sec ondar y unions are beat tones and a r e generally considered very e nhar - monic as also seconda r y ha r monics may for m dis cordant inter va l s with primar y, se condary and terciary generated harm onic s.

This s econd body will natur al ly attract, absor b or ass imil ate sym pat he ti c vibrations to itself. The se cond body will not be attractive or sy mpathetic to di s cor dant v i br ations. According to res earch already done ( 1) thes e attr ac t ive wave s m a y have an eff ec t many t imes greate r in for c e than the propulsive or creative w aves.
