The chord mass repre- senting the musical sphere, being sympa- thetic etheric chord of B flat third octave, in- dicated by the focali- zation of its interior mechanical combina- tion, as against the neutral sevenths of its atmospheric volume, makes the shell high- ly sensitive to the re- ception of pure sym- pathetic concordance, whether it b e physical, m echanical, or a combination of both. Tak ing the chord mass of the different mechanical parts of the sph ere and its adjuncts, as previously explained, when associated and focalized to represent pure concordance, as between its atmospheric volume and sphere mass, which means the pure unit of concordance, we have the h ighest position that can be established in relation to its sympathetic susceptiveness to negative antagonism. The beauty of the perfection of the laws that govern the action of Natu re' s sympa- thetic fl ows is he re demonstrated in all the purity o f its workings actually requiring antagonistic cho rds to move and acceler- ate. The dark side of the shell, which rep- resents fifty per cent of its full area of con- cordant harmony, is the receptive area for the influence o f the negative transmissive chords of the thirds, sixt hs and nint hs to bombard upon, which bombardment dis- turbs t he equilibrium of said sp here, and induces rotation. The rotation can be ac- celerated or retarded, according as th e an- tagonistic chords of the acoustic forces are transmitted in greater or lesser vol- ume. The action in- duced by the mouth organ, transmitted at a distance from the sphere w ithout any connection of wire, demonstrates the pur- ity of the p rinciple of sympathetic transmis- sion as negatize d or disturbed by discor- dants, which, focalizi ng on the resonating sevenths of resonators, or tu bes att ached to ring, t he sym pathetic flow is by this means transmitted to the focalizing center, or cen- ter of neutrality, to be redistributed at each revolution of sphere, keeping intact the sympathetic volume during sensitization, thus preventing the equation or stoppage of its rotation. Again, the sphere resting on its journals in the ring, as graduated to the condition of its interior co mbinations, represents a pure sympathetic concordant under perfect equation to receive the sympathetic, or to reject the no n-sympathetic.

The inventor r ec eived us wit hout a ny f ormali- ty. He was in fact in his s hir t-sle eves a nd did not e ven make a pr ete nce of put ting on his coat. He was a mos t una ss um ing man, ver y simple and dir e ct in his wor ds and e xpr es - sions . He had no pr etens ions of being taken f or a n engineer or a sc i e nt is t or anything out of the way. In answe r to one of Ma j or Seave r 's questions as to what had fir s t l e d him t o be li e ve that an, up to then, unknown force existed be yond the power of s team and elec tr icity, he ver y s imply sa id, \"The idea came into my mi nd from where I cannot tell. Perhaps i t first came from a craze I had t o s tudy the magne t to attempt to solve w hat t he mysterious power was t ha t e na- bled i t to attract steel and iron t o itself. \"For a long time I wondered over the in- disputable f ac t that a horses hoe of ir on c oul d be magne t iz ed in a few s econds by the curr e nt of a few amperes fr om a ba tt e r y, a nd that suc h a magnet could lift many pounds weight of metal. Fur ther, that eve r y second of tim e with- out end while the magnet is expa nding e nergy it totals up an a l mos t inconce ivable a m ount of actual power, not alone t ha t, but the magne t of one pound lifting powe r today, may and i n fact w i ll be s tr onge r tomor row. \"W her e does this really tremendous amount of energy come fr om? By what inscru- table proces s does the mer e m a gnetization of a bar of iron make of it a machine for the tr ans - for mation of energy, even mor e , a pe r pe t ua l creator of force? \"It ca m e into my mind that there wa s a hidden pr oc ess going on of s om e kind, e nergy going into the magnet and flowing out of it all the time it was doing work energy in some for m. \"W her e did i t c om e f rom—gravity? at- mosphe r e? s olar rays? earth cur rents ? W ho can sa y? \"The m e r e fact of the magnet ca r rying its load proves conc l us ively the consta nt f low or positive ac ti on of a sympa t he ti c f orce, the ve- locity exc eeding millions of vibrations per se cond. \"In the course of many years of experi- ments, I believe I have dis covered a me ans of harness ing wha t may be c alled 'ethe r ic' f orce and of overcoming gravity. \"I w ant you, Sir ,\" Keely went on, turning to M ajor Seaver, \"to examine my machines fr om the standpoint of the sceptic.

He was fully te n feet away from the mac hine he was s uppose d to s tar t. For f ully f ive m inutes he tr ied note af- ter note, but nothing happene d. He handed the violin over t o Keely. Perhaps it was due t o his long years of pr a c- tice, or it may have been owing to his unus ual- ly kee n musica l hearing, but the fact remaine d that in one s tr oke of the bow an immediate re- spons e was hea r d in the machine .

For an- sw er Keely drew a disc or dant not e fr om the violin. T he machine immediately began t o slow down and finally s topped. \"N ow, M ajor, \" Keely s aid, \"you s hould be able to s tart it up yours elf . B e patient, try tone a f ter tone and chord a f ter chord. Sooner or later you must strike the ri ght one.\" Ma jor Seaver, with a ver y patient look on his face, again took the viol in.

Then, taking up a wrench lying nea r at hand, he very deliberately undid the bolts and lif ted the mo- tor off the be nch. As no connecting wires of any kind were to be se en he rebolted the ma chine and handing me the vi olin, told m e to t ry. Perhaps it was what is called \"beginners' luck.\" I had barely dr a wn a s harp clear note fr om the \" A\" string, when again the motor sta r ted. Thi s t ime the \"s toppi ng\" w as the di fficult part. Though I s tr uck discord af te r discord, still the motor went on rapidly increasing i ts velocity. I a ppealed to Keely to he l p me. He took the violin, s t ruck one dis cord a nd i mmedia t e l y the motor slowe d down and s topped a s bef ore. \"That is the one wea k point that up to now pr e vents its commer c ial value , \" Kee l y sa id. \" My eff orts now are being conce ntr ate d to make an instrument that w i ll give off an ex- act not e to s tar t and s t op the machine at will. The dif ficulty is not an eas y one to get over owing to the variation in the ma gneti c and etheric currents which are cha nging continual- ly, but I believe that one of these days I will get t he ins pi ration how to solve t he problem. \" Keely next s howed us his revolving globe of glas s that had caus ed much comment in hos - tile ne wspape r s . It wa s of very s imple c onstruction, merely a large glass gl obe balanced on a pivot of plati- num that, when s pinning, kept its equilibrium by centrif ugal action exac t ly as a boy's t op keeps its elf in pos it ion by the sa m e law. Thi s globe was also started by a vibrati on fr om t he violin. W hen it ha d attained c onsider- able velocity, Keely made me lif t it of f the ta- ble and carry t he whole thi ng, wooden stand and a ll , s everal times r ound the room. A s its revolutions beca me mor e and more rapid I grew alarmed, believing it might any mom e nt fly to piece s. Again a dis cor d f rom the violin and in a f e w minutes it s topped. The next day K eely showe d Major Seave r a nd myse l f another of his inve nt ions equally star- tling. It was nothing more or l e ss t ha n a means of over c om ing the law of gr a vi ta t ion as ap- plied to airships. Be f ore goi ng into this demonstration the in- ventor showed us a remarkable experiment in connec t ion with this idea. Thr ee glass chambe r s , forty inches in height, fil le d with water, were placed on a slab of glas s. In each of these c yli nde r s were t hree metal sphe r es weighing six ounces e ach. When a wir e compose d of s il ve r and pla t ina connec t e d these gl a ss chambers with the sym- pathic trans m itter, the metal s pheres rose or des cended in them or remained stationary a t any point with a motion a s gentle a s t ha t of a thistledown f loa t ing in air. In de monstrating wha t a ppeared to be the overcoming of gravity f or a er ia l navigation, Mr. Keely next show ed us a model of an air- ship we i ghing about e i ght pounds . When the diff erential wire was a tt a ched to it, it also rose floated, or r e mained stationary, at wha t e ver height he wis hed it t o be."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"pa ge 20 of 2 0 [ P00 0268 9] Thi s r e m a r kable demons tr a t ion of t his m ode l airship, it mus t be r e member e d, was show n us at the Keely Laborator ies in 1890, some thir- teen years be f ore the br others , Orville a nd Wilbur Wright, flew the first aeroplane in [Carolina in 1903 and Dumont flew] in France in 1906.
