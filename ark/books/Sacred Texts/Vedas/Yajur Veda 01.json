The gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the gods, in anticipation of the contest, deposited in Agni their desirable riches (thinking),'This will still be ours, if they defeat us. Agni desired it and went away with it. The gods having defeated (the Asuras) pursued (Agni) desirous of recovering it. They sought violently to take it from him. He wept; in that he wept (arodit [sic]), that is why Rudra has his name. The tear that was shed became silver; therefore silver is not a suitable gift, for it is born of tears. He who gives on the strew, in his house before the year is out they weep; therefore one should not give on the strew. Agni said, 'Let me have a share; then this will be yours.' They replied, 'The re−establishing shall be thine alone.' 'He shall prosper', he said, who shall establish the fire with me as its divinity.' Pusan established it; therefore did Pusan prosper; therefore cattle are said to be Pusan's. Tvastr established it; therefore did Tvastr prosper; therefore cattle are said to be Tvastr's. Manu established it; therefore did Manu prosper; therefore offspring are said to be Manu's. Dhatr established it; therefore Dhatr prospered; Dhatr is the year; therefore offspring and cattle are born in the course of the year. He who knows thus the prosperity of the re−establishing prospers. He who knows his connexions becomes possessed of connexions himself. Agni desiring a share after being established assailed the offspring and cattle of the sacrifice. Having removed it, one should re−establish it; thus he unites him with his own portion; verily he is appeased. He should establish under Punarvasu; Punarvasu is the Naksatra for the re−establishing; verily by establishing it under its own deity he becomes resplendent. He establishes with Darbha grass, for variety. He establishes with Darbha; verily winning it from the waters and the plants he establishes it.

The sacrificial cake is offered on five potsherds; the sacrifice is fivefold, cattle are fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice and cattle. Now he who removes the fire is the slayer of the hero among the gods; Brahmans desirous of holiness did not aforetime eat his food; the Yajyas and Anuvakyas are in the Pankti metre; the sacrifice is fivefold, man is fivefold; verily making recompense to the gods for the hero he re−establishes the fire . They are of a hundred syllables; man lives a hundred years and has a hundred powers; verily he rests on life and power. In that Agni when established does not prosper, (it is that he is) desiring a greater portion; in that it is all Agni's, that is his prosperity. Speech is uttered together in the house of him who removes the fire; the sacrificer is liable to perish on account of the uttering together of speech. There are discriminations, to sever speech and preserve the sacrificer . He makes a discrimination; verily he makes the holy power (Brahman). He speaks the Yajus, muttering; it is as if one who has found a rich treasure hides it. To Agni Svistakrt he speaks aloud; it is as if one who has found a rich treasure is fain to go openly. Uttering the discrimination he 42"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"makes the Vasat cry with the foresacrifice; verily he leaves not his abode.

The sacrificial fee is a renovated chariot, a newly−sewn garment, a draught ox let loose again, for the prosperity of the re−establishing. 'Seven are thy kindling−sticks, O Agni, seven thy tongues'; (with these words) he offers the Agnihotra. Wherever there is anything of his nature, thence does he win him. Now he who removes the fire is the slayer of the hero among the gods, Varuna is the exactor of the recompense; he should make an offering on eleven potsherds to Agni and Varuna; him whom he slays and him who exacts the recompense he delights with their own portion; the sacrificer is not ruined. i. 5. 3.

The serpents thought that they were growing worn out; Kasarnira Kadraveya beheld this Mantra; then did they strike off their worn−out skins.

Pure food did not come to the earth; she beheld this Mantra; then food came to her. In that he establishes the Garhapatya with the verses of the serpent queen (it serves) for the winning of food; verily he establishes it firm in the (earth).

'Whatever of thee scattered in rage', he says; verily by means of the deities he unites him. The sacrifice of him who removes the fire is split; he pays reverence with a verse containing the word Brhaspati; Brhaspati is the holy power (Brahman) of the gods; verily by holy power (Brahman) he unites the sacrifice. 'May he unite this scattered sacrifice', he says, for continuity, 'May the All−gods rejoice herein', he says; verily continuing the sacrifice he points it out to the gods. 'Seven are thy kindling−sticks, O Agni, seven thy tongues' , he says, for sevenfold in seven−wise are the dear forms of Agni; verily he wins them. 'Return with strength', 'Return with wealth', (with these words) he offers oblations on either side of the sacrificial cake; verily with strength and with wealth he surrounds on either side the sacrificer. The Adityas went from this world to yonder world, they were thirsty in yonder world, having returned to this world and having established the fire, they offered these oblations; they prospered, they went to the world of heaven. He, who establishes a fire after the second establishment, should offer these oblations; be prospers with the prosperity where with the Adityas prospered. The Reverence of the Fire i. 5. 5.

They praised Agni; be praised by them delivered their cattle from night to day; the gods having gained their cattle per formed their desires. He who knowing thus pays reverence to the fire becomes possessed of cattle . The sun went from this world to yonder world; he having gone to yonder world bethought him again of this world; having returned to this world he had fear of death, for this world is, as it were, yoked with death.

He who knowing thus pays reverence to the fire, goes to the world of heaven and lives all his days. He mounts these two fires who pays reverence to them; he acts according to the desires of one who has attained a higher place. He pays reverence at night, not in the morning, for vows are mingled at night, the bad and the good are on the same level, the fire is the light, the evening is the darkness; in that he pays reverence by night, he overcomes the darkness by light. 'Should reverence be paid to the fire or not?' they say; 'he who day by day makes a present to a man and then begs of him assuredly molests him; and who then will day by day beg of the gods?' Then they say, 'The sacrificer sacrifices for the sake of the benediction.' The reverence of the fire is the benediction of him who has established a fire; therefore reverence should be paid to the fire. Prajapati created cattle; being created they entered day and night; he recovered them by means of the metres. In that he pays reverence with the metres, he seeks to recover his own.

Even as the Soma (sacrifices) come together in competition, so the new and full moon (sacrifices) are sacrifices which come together in competition. Whose sacrifice then do the gods approach and whose not? He, who among many sacrificers first appropriates the gods, sacrifices to them when the next day comes. The Ahavaniya is the abode of the gods, between the fires of cattle, the Garhapatya of men, the Anvaharya pacana of the fathers. He takes the fire; verily he appropriates the gods in their own abode; to them he sacrifices when the next day comes. By means of a vow is Agni, lord of vows, pure, the Brahman is a supporter of vows. When about to undertake a vow he should say, 'O Agni, lord of vows, I shall perform the vow.' Agni is the lord of vows among the gods; verily after announcement to him he undertakes the vow. At the full moon be undertakes his vow with the (strewing of the) straw, with the (driving away of the) calves at new moon; for that is their abode. 'The fires, both in the front and at the back, must be bestrewed', they say; men indeed desire what is bestrewed, and, how much more the gods whose is a new dwelling. With him, when sacrifice is to be made on the next day, do the gods dwell, who knowing this bestrews the fire. 'The sacrificer should win both beasts of the wild and of the village', they say; in that he refrains from those of the village, thereby be wins them; in that he eats of the wild, thereby he wins them of the wild. If be were to fast without eating, the Pitrs would be his divinity ; he eats of the wild, the wild is power, and so he bestows power upon himself. If he were to fast without eating, he would be hungry; if he were to eat, Rudra would plan evil against his cattle; he partakes of water; that is neither eaten nor not eaten; he is not hungry and Rudra does not plot evil against his cattle. The sacrificer is a bolt, the enemy of man is hunger; in Book 01 Part 06 56"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"that he fasts without eating, he straightway smites with the bolt the enemy, hunger. i. 6. 8. He who offers sacrifice without faith, they place not faith in his sacrifice. He brings waters forward, the waters are faith; verily with faith he offers sacrifice, and both gods and men place faith in his sacrifice. They say, 'They foam over the barrier, they foam over speech, but over mind they do not foam.' He brings them forward with mind; mind is this (earth) ; verily with this (earth) he brings them forward. The sacrifice of him who knows thus does not spill. He collects the weapons of the sacrifice; the weapons of the sacrifice are the sacrifice; verily he collects the sacrifice. If he were to collect them one by one, they would have the Pitrs as their divinity; if all together, (they would have) men as their divinity. He collects them in pairs, and so he makes the form of the Yajya and the Anuvakya, and thus there is a pair. If a man knows the ten weapons of the sacrifice, his sacrifice is in order at the beginning. The wooden sword , the potsherds, the offering−spoon, the basket, the black antelope skin, the pin, the mortar and pestle, the lower and upper millstones, these are the ten weapons of the sacrifice; the sacrifice of him who knows thus is in order at the beginning. If a man sacrifices after announcing the sacrifice to the gods, they delight in his sacrifice. He should as the oblation is being offered recite (the words), 'Agni, the priest, him I summon hither' . Thus he announces the sacrifice to the gods and sacrifices, and the gods delight in his sacrifice. This is the taking of the sacrifice and so after taking the sacrifice he sacrifices. After speaking he remains silent, to support the sacrifice. Now Prajapati performed the sacrifice with mind; verily he performs the sacrifice with mind to prevent the Raksases following. He who yokes the sacrifice when the yoking (time) arrives yokes it indeed among the yokers. 'Who (ka) yoketh thee? Let him yoke thee', he says. Ka is Prajapati−−verily by Prajapati he yokes it; he yokes indeed among the yokers. i. 6. 9. Prajapati created the sacrifices, the Agnihotra, the Agnistoma, the full moon sacrifice, the Ukthya, the new moon sacrifice and the Atiratra. These he meted out; the Agnistoma was the size of the Agnihotra, the Ukthya that of the full moon sacrifice, the Atiratra that of the new moon sacrifice. He who knowing thus offers the Agnihotra obtains as much as by offering the Agnistoma; he who knowing thus offers the full moon sacrifice obtains as much as by offering the Ukthya ; he who knowing thus offers the new moon sacrifice obtains as much as by offering the Atiratra. This sacrifice was in the beginning Paramesthin's, and by means of it he reached the supreme goal. He furnished Prajapati with it, and by means of it Prajapati reached the supreme goal. He furnished Indra with it, and by means of it Indra reached the supreme goal. He furnished Agni and Soma with it, and by means of it Agni and Soma reached the supreme goal. He who knowing thus offers the new and full moon sacrifices reaches the supreme goal. He who sacrifices with an abundant offering is multiplied with offspring, with cattle, with pairings. 'The year has twelve months, there are twelve pairs of new and full moon sacrifices; these are to be produced', they say. He lets the calf go free and puts the pot on the fire: he puts down (the rice), and beats the Book 01 Part 06 57"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"millstones together; he scatters (the grains) and collects the potsherds; the cake he puts on the fire and the melted butter; he throws the clump of grass, and gathers it in; he surrounds the Vedi and he girds the wife (of the sacrificer); he puts in place the anointing waters and the melted butter. These are the twelve pairs in the new and full moon sacrifices. He, who thus sacrifices with these, sacrifices with an abundant offering and is multiplied with offspring, with cattle, with pairings. i. 6. 10. 'Thou I art secure; may I be secure among my equals', he says; verily he makes them secure.' 'Thou art dread; may I be dread among my equals'; verily he makes them harmonious. 'Thou art overcoming; may I be overcoming among my equals,' he says; verily he overthrows him who rises against him. 'I yoke thee with the divine Brahman', he says; this is the yoking of the fire; verily with it he yokes it. With the prosperous part of the sacrifice the gods went to the world of heaven, with the unsuccessful part they overcame the Asuras. 'Whatever, O Agni, in this sacrifice of mine may be spoiled', he says; verily with the prosperous part of the sacrifice the sacrificer goes to the world of heaven, with the unsuccessful part he overcomes the foes. With these Vyahrtis he should set down the Agnihotra. The Agnihotra is the beginning of the sacrifice, these Vyahrtis are the Brahman; verily at the beginning of the sacrifice he makes the Brahman . When the year is completed he should thus with these (Vyahrtis) perform the setting down; verily with the Brahman he surrounds the year on both sides. He who is undertaking the new and full moon and the four monthly offerings should set in place the oblations with these Vyahrtis. The new and full moon and the four monthly sacrifices are the beginning of the sacrifice, these Vyahrtis are the Brahman; verily at the beginning of the sacrifice he makes the Brahman. When the year is completed, he should thus with them (Vyahrtis) set down (the oblations), and so with the Brahman he surrounds the year on both sides. To the kingly class falls the blessing of the part of the sacrifice which is performed with the Saman ; to the people (falls) the blessing of what (is performed) with the Rc; now the Brahman sacrifices with an offering without a blessing; when he is about to recite the kindling−verses he should first insert the Vyahrtis; verily he makes the Brahman the commencement, and thus the Brahman sacrifices with an offering which has a blessing. If he desire of a sacrificer, 'May the blessing of his sacrifice fall to his foe', he should insert for him those Vyahrtis in the Puronuvakya (verse); the Puronuvakya has the foe for its divinity; verily the blessing of his sacrifice falls to his foe . If he desire of sacrificers, 'May the blessing of the sacrifice fall to them equally', he should place for them one of the Vyahrtis at the half−verse of the Puronuvakya, one before the Yajya, and one at the half−verse of the Yajya, and thus the blessing of the sacrifice falls to them equally. Even as Parjanya rains down good rain, so the sacrifice rains for the sacrificer; they surround the water with a mound, the sacrificer surrounds the sacrifice with a blessing. 'Thou art mind derived from Prajapati , with mind and true existence do thou enter me', he says; mind is derived from Prajapati, the sacrifice is derived from Prajapati; verily he confers upon himself mind and the sacrifice. 'Thou art speech, derived from Indra, destroying the foe; do thou enter me with speech, with power', he says; speech is derived from Indra; verily he confers upon himself speech as connected with Indra.

'She divides', he replied. 'Her body then hast thou invoked', he said. Her body is the cow ; of the cow were they two talking. She who is 62"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"given in the sacrifice supports the gods with her expiration; she by whom men live (supports) men by her cross−breathing; she whom they slay for the Fathers (supports) the Fathers by her inspiration; he who knows thus becomes rich in cattle. 'Her too I have invoked', he said, 'who is available to people as they increase.' 'Her food then hast thou invoked', he replied. This food is plants, plants are available to people as they increase; he who knows thus becomes an eater of food. 'Her too I have invoked', he said, who supports people in distress and succours them as they improve.' Her support then hast thou invoked', he replied. Her support is this (earth) , this (earth) supports people in distress and succours them as they improve; he who knows thus finds support. 'Her too I have invoked', he said, 'in whose step people drink the ghee they live upon.' 'Does she divide, or does she not divide?' (he asked). 'She does not divide', he said, 'but she propagates.' 'Indeed hast thou invoked the Ida herself ', he replied. The Ida is rain; in the step of rain people drink the ghee they live upon; he who knows thus is propagated with offspring; he becomes an eater of food. i. 7. 3. Secretly offering is made to one set of gods, openly to another. The gods who receive offering secretly, he thus offers to them in sacrifice; in that he brings the Anvaharya mess−−the Brahmans are the gods openly−−them he verily delights. This is his sacrificial fee: verily he mends the rent in the sacrifice; whatever in the sacrifice is harsh or is injured, that he makes good (anvaharati) with the Anvaharya mess, and that is why it has its name. Now the priests are the messengers of the gods; in that he brings the Anvaharya mess, he delights the messengers of the gods. Prajapati distributed the sacrifice to the gods; he reflected that he was empty; he per ceived this Anvaharya mess unallotted; he conferred it upon himself. The Anvaharya is connected with Prajapati; he, who knowing thus brings the Anvaharya, assuredly enjoys Prajapati. An unlimited amount should be poured out, Prajapati is unlimited; (verily it serves) to win Prajapati . Whatever the gods did in the sacrifice, the Asuras did; the gods perceived the Anvaharya connected with Prajapati; they seized it − then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated; he who knowing thus brings the Anvaharya prospers himself, his foe is defeated. By the sacrifice there is offering, by the cooked food satisfying. He who knowing thus brings the Anvaharya, accomplishes at once sacrifice and satisfaction. 'Thou art the portion of Prajapati' , he says; verily he unites Prajapati with his own portion. 'Full of strength and milk', he says; verily he confers upon him strength and milk. 'Protect my expiration and inspiration; protect my breathing together and cross−breathing', he says; verily he invokes this blessing. 'Thou art imperishable, for imperishableness thee; mayst thou not perish for me, yonder, in yonder world', he says. Food perishes in yonder world, for given hence in yonder world people live upon it; in that he touches thus, he makes it imperishable; his food perishes not in yonder world. i. 7. 4. 'By I sacrifice to the divine strew, may I be possessed of children', he says; by the strew Prajapati created offspring, verily he creates offspring. 'By sacrifice to the god Naraçansa, Book 01 Part 07 63"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"may I be possessed of cattle', he says; by Naraçansa Prajapati created cattle; verily he creates cattle. 'By sacrifice to the god, Agni Svistakrt, may I attain security through the sacrifice, having long life', he says; verily he confers life on himself, and finds support through the sacrifice. With the victory of the new and full moon sacrifices the gods conquered, and by means of the new and full moon sacrifices they drove away the Asuras. 'May I be victorious through the victory of Agni', he says; verily through the victory of the deities in the new and full moon sacrifices the sacrificer is victorious, and by means of the new and full moon offerings drives away his enemies. With two verses containing the word 'strength', he accompanies the separation (of the ladles) strength is food verily he wins food; (he uses) two, for support. He who sacrifices knowing the two milkings of the sacrifice milks thus the sacrifice on both sides , in front and behind; this is one milking of the sacrifice, another is in the Ida. When the Hotr utters the name of the sacrificer, then he should say, 'Hither these blessings have come, fain for milking'; verily he milks the deities which he praises together; verily he milks the sacrifice on both sides, in front and behind. 'With the red steed may Agni convey thee to the god', he says; these are the steeds of the gods , the straw is the sacrificer; in that he casts forward the straw with them, he makes the sacrificers to go by the steeds of the gods to the world of heaven. 'I unyoke thy head ropes, thy reins', he says; that is the unyoking of Agni; verily thereby he unyokes him. 'By sacrifice to the god Visnu, by the sacrifice may I attain health and wealth and security', he says; Visnu is the sacrifice; verily the sacrifice finds support at the end. 'By sacrifice to the god Soma, possessing good seed , may I impregnate seed', he says; Soma is the impregnator of seed; verily he confers seed upon himself. 'By sacrifice to the god Tvastr, may I prosper the form of cattle'; Tvastr is the form−maker of the pairings of cattle, and thereby he confers upon himself the form of cattle. 'The wives of the gods, Agni, the lord of the house, are the pair of the sacrifice; by sacrifice to these deities may I be propagated with a pair.' 'Thou art the bundle, thou art gain, may I gain', he says; by the bundle (vedena) the gods won (avindanta) the desirable wealth of the Asuras, and that is why the bundle has its name. Whatever of his foe's he may covet, the name of that he should utter; verily he wing it all from him. 'May the bundle bestow increase of wealth, rich in ghee, rich in houses, a thousandfold, strong', he says; he obtains a thousand cattle. In his offspring a strong one is born who knows thus. i. 7. 5. Through the emptying of the Dhruva the sacrifice is emptied, through the sacrifice the sacrificer, through the sacrificer offspring. Through the swelling of the Dhruva, the sacrifice is made to swell, through the sacrifice the sacrificer, through the sacrificer offspring. 'Let the Dhruva swell with ghee', he says; verily he makes the Dhruva to swell; through its swelling the sacrifice is made to swell, through the sacrifice the sacrificer, through the sacrificer offspring. 'Prajapati's is the world called Vibhan. In it I place thee along with the sacrificer', he says ; the world of Prajapati, named Vibhan, is this (world); verily he places it in it along with the sacrificer. In that he sacrifices he is as it were emptied; in that he eats the sacrificer's portion, he fills himself. The sacrifice is the size of the sacrificer's portion, the sacrificer is the sacrifice; in that he eats the sacrificer's portion, he places the sacrifice in the sacrifice. There is good grass and good water where the strew and the waters are ; the Vedi is the abode of the sacrificer; in that he places the full bowl within the Vedi, he Book 01 Part 07 64"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"establishes good grass and good water in his own abode. 'Thou art real, be real for me', he says; the sacrifice is the waters, ambrosia is the water; verily he bestows upon himself the sacrifice and the waters. All creatures attend him who is performing the vow. 'In the eastern quarter may the gods, the priests, make (me) bright', he says; this is the concluding bath of the new and full moon sacrifices . He goes to the bath along with the creatures which attend him as he performs the vow. Headed by Visnu the gods won these worlds by the metres so as to be irrecoverable; in that he takes the steps of Visnu the sacrificer becoming Visnu wins these worlds by the metres so as to be irrecoverable. 'Thou art the step of Visnu, smiting imprecations', he says; the earth is the Gayatri, the atmosphere is connected with the Tristubh, the sky is the Jagati, the quarters are connected with the Anustubh; verily by the metres he wins these worlds in order. i. 7. 6. 'We have come to the heaven: to the heaven we have come', he says; verily he goes to the world of heaven. 'May I not be cut off from seeing thee; what heat is thine, to that of thee may I not be brought low', he says; that is according to the text. 'Thou art good, the best of rays; thou art life−bestowing, bestow life upon me', he says; verily he invokes this blessing. He falls away from this world, who takes the steps of Visnu, for from the world of heaven the steps of Visnu are taken. The theologians say, 'He indeed would take the steps of Visnu who after acquiring these worlds of his foe should descend again to this world.' This is his return descent to this world, in that he says,'Here do I exclude my enemy N. N. from these quarters, from this sky'; verily having acquired these worlds of his foe he descends again to this world. 'I have been united with the light', he says; verily he rests on this world. 'I turn the turning of Indra', he says; Indra is yonder sun; verily he turns his turning. He turns to the right; verily he revolves round his own strength; therefore the right side of a man is the stronger; verily also he turns the turning of the sun. 'May I be united with offspring, offspring with me', he says; verily he invokes this blessing. 'Kindled, O Agni, shine for me; kindling thee, O Agni, may I shine', he says; that is according to the text. 'Be rich the sacrifice; may I be rich', he says; verily he invokes this blessing. Within the Garhapatya much variegated work is performed; with two verses to Agni, the purifier, he pays reverence to the Garhapatya; verily he purifies the fire, he purifies himself; (he uses) two for support. 'O Agni, lord of the house', he says ; that is according to the text. 'For a hundred winters', he says; 'for a hundred winters may I kindle thee', he says in effect. He utters the name of his son; verily he makes him an eater of food. 'This prayer I utter, bringing light for the race', he should say who has no son born to him, verily is born to him a brilliant and resplendent son. 'This prayer I utter, bringing light to N. N.', he should say who has a son born ; verily he bestows upon him brilliance and splendour. He who having yoked the sacrifice does not let it free becomes without a support. 'Who yoketh thee? Let him set thee free', he says; Who (ka) is Prajapati; verily by Prajapati he yokes him, by Prajapati he lets him free, for support. The vow if not released is liable to consume (the sacrificer); 'O Agni, lord of vows, I have performed my vow', he says; verily he releases his vow , for atonement, to prevent burning. The sacrifice goes away, and turns not back; to him who sacrifices knowing the restoration of the sacrifice it does turn back; 'The sacrifice hath become, it hath come into being', he says; this is the restoration of the sacrifice, and thereby he restores it. Excellence has not been obtained by him who having established a fire has no retinue; cattle indeed are the Book 01 Part 07 65"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"retinue of a Brahman. Having sacrificed, he should step forward to the east and say, 'Rich in cattle, in sheep, O Agni, in horses is the sacrificer'; he wins his retinue, he obtains a thousand cattle, in his offspring a strong one is born. The Vajapeya i. 7. 7.
