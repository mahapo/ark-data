Agni 1 Agni is wakened by the people's fuel to meet the Dawn who cometh like a milch−cow. Like young trees shooting up on high their branches, his flames are rising to the vault of heaven. 2 For worship of the Gods the Priest was wakened: at morning gracious Agni hath arisen. Kindled, his radiant might is made apparent, and the great Deity set free from darkness. 3 When he hath stirred the line of his attendants, with the pure milk pure Agni is anointed. The strength−bestowing gift is then made ready, which spread in front, with tongues, erect, he drinketh. 4 The spirits of the pious turn together to Agni, as the eyes of all to Surya. He, when both Dawns of different hues have borne him, springs up at daybreak as a strong white charger. 5 The noble One was born at days' beginning, laid red in colour mid the well−laid fuel. Yielding in every house his seven rich treasures, Agni is seated, Priest most skilled in worship. 6 Agni hath sat him down, a Priest most skilful, on a sweet−smelling place, his Mother's bosom. Young, faithful, sage, preeminent o'er many, kindled among the folk whom he sustaineth. 7 This Singer excellent at sacrifices, Agni the Priest, they glorify with homage. Him who spread out both worlds by Law Eternal they balm with oil, strong Steed who never faileth. 8 He, worshipful House−Friend, in his home is worshipped, our own auspicious guest, lauded by sages. That strength the Bull with thousand horns possesses. In might, O Agni, thou excellest others. 9 Thou quickly passest by all others, Agni, for him to whom thou hast appeared most lovely, Wondrously fair, adorable, effulgent, the guest of men, the darling of the people. 2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"10 To thee, Most Youthful God! to thee, O Agni from near and far the people bring their tribute. Mark well the prayer of him who best extols thee. Great, high, auspicious, Agni, is thy shelter. 11 Ascend to−day thy splendid car, O Agni, in splendour, with the Holy Ones around it. Knowing the paths by mid−air's spacious region bring hither Gods to feast on our oblation. 12 To him adorable, sage, strong and mighty we have sung forth our song of praise and homage. Gavisthira hath raised with prayer to Agni this laud far−reaching, like gold light to heaven. HYMN II. Agni. 1 THE youthful Mother keeps the Boy in secret pressed to her close, nor yields him to the Father. But, when he lies upon the arm, the people see his unfading countenance before them. 2 What child is this thou carriest as handmaid, O Youthful One? The Consort−Queen hath borne him. The Babe unborn increased through many autumns. I saw him born what time his Mother bare him. 3 I saw him from afar gold−toothed, bright−coloured, hurling his weapons from his habitation, What time I gave him Amrta free from mixture. How can the Indraless, the hymnless harm me? 4 I saw him moving from the place he dwells in, even as with a herd, brilliantly shining. These seized him not: he had been born already. They who were grey with age again grow youthful. 5 Who separate my young bull from the cattle, they whose protector was in truth no stranger? Let those whose hands have seized upon them free them. May he, observant, drive the herd to us−ward. 6 Mid mortal men godless have secreted the King of all who live, home of the people. So may the prayers of Atri give him freedom. Reproached in turn be those who now reproach him. 7 Thou from the stake didst loose e'en Sunahsepa bound for a thousand; for he prayed with fervour.

He conquers godless and malign enchantments, and sharpens both his horns to gore the Raksas. 10 Loud in the heaven above be Agni's roarings with keen−edged weapons to destroy the demons. Forth burst his splendours in the Soma's rapture. The godless bands press round but cannot stay him. 11 As a skilled craftsman makes a car, a singer I, Mighty One! this hymn for thee have fashioned. If thou, O Agni, God, accept it gladly, may we obtain thereby the heavenly Waters. 12 May he, the strong−necked Steer, waxing in vigour, gather the foeman's wealth with none to check him. Thus to this Agni have the Immortals spoken. To man who spreads the grass may he grant shelter, grant shelter to the man who brings oblation. HYMN III.

Then straight the mountains clothe them in the rain−cloud: the Heroes, putting forth their vigour, loose them. 5 I will declare this mighty deed of magic, of glorious Varuna the Lord Immortal, Who standing in the firmament hath meted the earth out with the Sun as with a measure. 6 None, verily, hath ever let or hindered this the most wise God's mighty deed of magic, Whereby with all their flood, the lucid rivers fill not one sea wherein they pour their waters. 7 If we have sinned against the man who loves us, have ever wronged a brother, friend, or comrade, The neighbour ever with us, or a stranger, O Varuna, remove from us the trespass. 8 If we, as gamesters cheat at play, have cheated, done wrong unwittingly or sinned of purpose, Cast all these sins away like loosened fetters, and, Varuna let us be thine own beloved. HYMN LXXXVI. Indra−Agni. 1 THE mortal man whom ye, the Twain, Indra and Agni, help in fight, Breaks through e'en strongly−guarded wealth as Trta burst his way through reeds. 2 The Twain invincible in war, worthy to be renowned in frays, Lords of the Fivefold. People, these, Indra and Agni, we invoke. 3 Impetuous is their strength, and keen the lightning of the mighty Pair, Which from their arms Book 05 Part 06 73"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"speeds with the car to Vrtra's slayer for the kine. 4 Indra and Agni, we invoke you both, as such, to send your cars: Lords of quick−coming bounty, ye who know, chief lovers of the song. 5 These who give increase day by day, Gods without guile for mortal man, Worthy themselves, I honour most, Two Gods as partners, for my horse. 6 The strength−bestowing offering thus to Indra−Agni hath been paid, as butter, purified by stones. Deal to our princes high renown, deal wealth to those who sing your praise, deal food to those who sing your praise. HYMN LXXXVII. Maruts. 1 To Visnu, to the Mighty whom the Maruts follow let your hymns born in song go forth, Evayamarut; To the impetuous, strong band, adorned with bracelets, that rushes on in joy and ever roars for vigour. 2 They who with might were manifest, and who willingly by their own knowledge told it forth, Evayamarut. Maruts, this strength of yours no wisdom comprehendeth: through their gifts' greatness they are moveless as the mountains. 3 Who by the psalm they sing are heard, from lofty heaven, the strong, the brightly shining Ones, Evayamarut; In whose abode there is no mightier one to move them, whose lightnings are as fires, who urge the roaring rivers. 4 He of the Mighty Stride forth strode, Evayamarut, out of the spacious dwelling−place, their home in common. When he, himself, hath yoked his emulous strong horses on heights, he cometh forth, joy−giving, with the Heroes. 5 Like your tremendous roar, the rainer with light flashing, strong, speeding, hath made all tremble, Evayamarut, Wherewith victorious ye, self−luminous, press onward, with strong reins, decked with gold, impetuous and well−weaponed. 6 Unbounded is your greatness, ye of mighty power: may your bright vigour be our aid, Evayamarut; For ye are visible helpers in the time of trouble: like fires, aglow with light, save us from shame and insult.

Like car−borne men, one−minded with the mighty Visnu, keep enmity far from us with your deeds of wonder. 9 Come to our sacrifice, ye Holy Ones, to bless it, and, free from demons, hear our call, Evayamarut. Most excellent, like mountains in the air's raid−region, be irresistible, ye, Wise, to this man'a hater. −− Book 05 Part 06 −− Book 05 Part 06 75"}]
