001:004 Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; 001:005 When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. 001:006 Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. 001:007 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. 001:008 Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;
