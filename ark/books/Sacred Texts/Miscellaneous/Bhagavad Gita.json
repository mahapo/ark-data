Vibrating both in the sky and on the earth, it shattered the hearts of the sons of Dhrtarastra. 20 At that time Arjuna, the son of Pandu, seated in the chariot bearing the flag marked with Hanuman, took up his bow and prepared to shoot his arrows. O King, after looking at the sons of Dhrtarastra drawn in military array, Arjuna then spoke to Lord Krishna these words. 21−22 Arjuna said: O infallible one, please draw my chariot between the two armies so that I may see those present here, who desire to fight, and with whom I must contend in this great trial of arms. 23 Let me see those who have come here to fight, wishing to please the evil−minded son of Dhrtarastra. 24 Sanjaya said: O descendant of Bharata, having thus been addressed by Arjuna, Lord Krishna drew up the fine chariot in the midst of the armies of both parties. 25 In the presence of Bhisma, Drona and all the other chieftains of the world, the Lord said, Just behold, Partha, all the Kurus assembled here. 26 Chapter 1 : Arjun Vishad Yog 4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"There Arjuna could see, within the midst of the armies of both parties, his fathers, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, friends, and also his fathers−in−law and well−wishers. 27 When the son of Kunti, Arjuna, saw all these different grades of friends and relatives, he became overwhelmed with compassion and spoke thus. 28 Arjuna said: My dear Krishna, seeing my friends and relatives present before me in such a fighting spirit, I feel the limbs of my body quivering and my mouth drying up. 29 My whole body is trembling, my hair is standing on end, my bow Gandiva is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning. 30 I am now unable to stand here any longer. I am forgetting myself, and my mind is reeling. I see only causes of misfortune, O Krishna, killer of the Kesi demon. 31 I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle, nor can I, my dear Krishna, desire any subsequent victory, kingdom, or happiness. 32−35 O Govinda, of what avail to us are a kingdom, happiness or even life itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed on this battlefield? O Madhusudana, when teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers−in−law, grandsons, brothers−in−law and other relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me, why should I wish to kill them, even though they might otherwise kill me?

The ancestors of such corrupt families fall down, because the performances for offering them food and water are entirely stopped. 42 By the evil deeds of those who destroy the family tradition and thus give rise to unwanted children, all kinds of community projects and family welfare activities are devastated. 43 O Krishna, maintainer of the people, I have heard by disciplic succession that those who destroy family traditions dwell always in hell. 44 Alas, how strange it is that we are preparing to commit greatly sinful acts.

Those who are wise lament neither for the living nor for the dead. 12 Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be. 13 As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. A sober person is not bewildered by such a change. 14 O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons.

This they have concluded by studying the nature of both. 17 That which pervades the entire body you should know to be indestructible. No one is able to destroy that imperishable soul. 18 The material body of the indestructible, immeasurable and eternal living entity is sure to come to an end; therefore, fight, O descendant of Bharata. 19 Neither he who thinks the living entity the slayer nor he who thinks it slain is in knowledge, for the self slays not nor is slain. 20 For the soul there is neither birth nor death at any time. He has not come into being, does not come into being, and will not come into being. He is unborn, eternal, ever−existing and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain. 21 O Partha, how can a person who knows that the soul is indestructible, eternal, unborn and immutable kill anyone or cause anyone to kill? 22 As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, the soul similarly accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones. 23 Chapter 2 : Sankhya Yog 10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The soul can never be cut to pieces by any weapon, nor burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind. 24 This individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble, and can be neither burned nor dried.

Knowing this, you should not grieve for the body. 26 If, however, you think that the soul [or the symptoms of life] is always born and dies forever, you still have no reason to lament, O mighty−armed. 27 One who has taken his birth is sure to die, and after death one is sure to take birth again. Therefore, in the unavoidable discharge of your duty, you should not lament. 28 All created beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their interim state, and unmanifest again when annihilated. So what need is there for lamentation? 29 Some look on the soul as amazing, some describe him as amazing, and some hear of him as amazing, while others, even after hearing about him, cannot understand him at all. 30 O descendant of Bharata, he who dwells in the body can never be slain.

Now listen as I explain it in terms of working without fruitive results. O son of Prtha, when you act in such knowledge you can free yourself from the bondage of works. 40 In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear. 41 Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one. O beloved child of the Kurus, the intelligence of those who are irresolute is many−branched. 42−43 Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth. Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this. 44 In the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and material opulence, and who are bewildered by such things, the resolute determination for devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not take place. 45 The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self. 46 All purposes served by a small well can at once be served by a great reservoir of water. Similarly, all the purposes of the Vedas can be served to one who knows the purpose behind them. 47 Chapter 2 : Sankhya Yog 13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action.

Such equanimity is called yoga. 49 O Dhananjaya, keep all abominable activities far distant by devotional service, and in that consciousness surrender unto the Lord. Those who want to enjoy the fruits of their work are misers. 50 A man engaged in devotional service rids himself of both good and bad actions even in this life. Therefore strive for yoga, which is the art of all work. 51 By thus engaging in devotional service to the Lord, great sages or devotees free themselves from the results of work in the material world. In this way they become free from the cycle of birth and death and attain the state beyond all miseries [by going back to Godhead]. 52 When your intelligence has passed out of the dense forest of delusion, you shall become indifferent to all that has been heard and all that is to be heard. 53 When your mind is no longer disturbed by the flowery language of the Vedas, and when it remains fixed in the trance of self−realization, then you will have attained the divine consciousness. 54 Arjuna said: O Krishna, what are the symptoms of one whose consciousness is thus merged in transcendence?

But, ceasing such engagements by experiencing a higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness. 60 The senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavoring to control them. 61 One who restrains his senses, keeping them under full control, and fixes his consciousness upon Me, is known as a man of steady intelligence.

And how can there be any happiness without peace? 67 As a boat on the water is swept away by a strong wind, even one of the roaming senses on which the mind focuses can carry away a man's intelligence. 68 Therefore, O mighty−armed, one whose senses are restrained from their objects is certainly of steady intelligence. 69 What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self−controlled; and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage.

Some are inclined to understand it by empirical, philosophical speculation, and others by devotional service. 4 Not by merely abstaining from work can one achieve freedom from reaction, nor by renunciation alone can one attain perfection. 5 Everyone is forced to act helplessly according to the qualities he has acquired from the modes of material nature; therefore no one can refrain from doing something, not even for a moment. 6 One who restrains the senses of action but whose mind dwells on sense objects certainly deludes himself and is called a pretender. 7 On the other hand, if a sincere person tries to control the active senses by the mind and begins karma−yoga [in Krishna consciousness] without attachment, he is by far superior. 8 18"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Perform your prescribed duty, for doing so is better than not working.

Therefore, O son of Kunti, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain free from bondage. 10 In the beginning of creation, the Lord of all creatures sent forth generations of men and demigods, along with sacrifices for Vishnu, and blessed them by saying, \"Be thou happy by this yajna [sacrifice] because its performance will bestow upon you everything desirable for living happily and achieving liberation.\" 11 The demigods, being pleased by sacrifices, will also please you, and thus, by cooperation between men and demigods, prosperity will reign for all. 12 In charge of the various necessities of life, the demigods, being satisfied by the performance of yajna [sacrifice], will supply all necessities to you. But he who enjoys such gifts without offering them to the demigods in return is certainly a thief. 13 The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food which is offered first for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin. 14 All living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rains. Rains are produced by performance of yajna [sacrifice], and yajna is born of prescribed duties. 15 Regulated activities are prescribed in the Vedas, and the Vedas are directly manifested from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Living only for the satisfaction of the senses, such a person lives in vain. 17 But for one who takes pleasure in the self, whose human life is one of self−realization, and who is satisfied in the self only, fully satiated −− for him there is no duty. 18 A self−realized man has no purpose to fulfill in the discharge of his prescribed duties, nor has he any reason not to perform such work. Nor has he any need to depend on any other living being. 19 Therefore, without being attached to the fruits of activities, one should act as a matter of duty, for by working without attachment one attains the Supreme. 20 Kings such as Janaka attained perfection solely by performance of prescribed duties. Therefore, just for the sake of educating the people in general, you should perform your work. 21 Whatever action a great man performs, common men follow. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues. 22 O son of Prtha, there is no work prescribed for Me within all the three planetary systems.

Rather, by working in the spirit of devotion, he should engage them in all sorts of activities [for the gradual development of Krishna consciousness]. 27 The spirit soul bewildered by the influence of false ego thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by the three modes of material nature. 28 One who is in knowledge of the Absolute Truth, O mighty−armed, does not engage himself in the senses and sense gratification, knowing well the differences between work in devotion and work for fruitive results. 29 Bewildered by the modes of material nature, the ignorant fully engage themselves in material activities and become attached.

Thus working, he is not affected by sinful reactions. 22 He who is satisfied with gain which comes of its own accord, who is free from duality and does not envy, who is steady in both success and failure, is never entangled, although performing actions.
