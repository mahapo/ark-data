far to come here, a distance of a thousand lî, may I presume that you are provided with counsels to profit my kingdom?' 3 Mencius replied, 'Why must your Majesty use that word \"profit?\" What I am provided with, are counsels to benevolence and righteousness, and these are my only topics. 4 'If your Majesty say, \"What is to be done to profit my kingdom?\" the great officers will say, \"What is to be done to profit our families?\" and the inferior officers and the common people will say, \"What is to be done to profit our persons?\" Superiors and inferiors will try to snatch this profit the one from the other, and the kingdom will be endangered. In the kingdom of ten thousand chariots, the murderer of his sovereign shall be the chief of a family of a thousand chariots. In the kingdom of a thousand chariots, the murderer of his prince shall be the chief of a family of a hundred chariots. To have a thousand in ten thousand, and a hundred in a thousand, cannot be said not to be a large allotment, but if righteousness be put last, and profit be put first, they will not be satisfied without snatching all. 5 'There never has been a benevolent man who neglected his parents. There never has been a righteous man who made his sovereign an after consideration. 6 'Let your Majesty also say, \"Benevolence and righteousness, and let these be your only themes.\" Why must you use that word −− \"profit?\". 1 Mencius, another day, saw King Hûi of Liang. The king went and stood with him by a pond, and, looking round at the large geese and deer, said, 'Do wise and good princes also find pleasure in these things?' 2 Mencius replied, 'Being wise and good, they have pleasure in these things. If they are not 2"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"wise and good, though they have these things, they do not find pleasure. 3 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, He measured out and commenced his marvellous tower; He measured it out and planned it. The people addressed themselves to it, And in less than a day completed it. When he measured and began it, he said to them −− Be not so earnest: But the multitudes came as if they had been his children. The king was in his marvellous park; The does reposed about, The does so sleek and fat: And the white birds came glistening. The king was by his marvellous pond; How full was it of fishes leaping about!\" 'King Wan used the strength of the people to make his tower and his pond, and yet the people rejoiced to do the work, calling the tower \"the marvellous tower,\" calling the pond \"the marvellous pond,\" and rejoicing that he had his large deer, his fishes, and turtles. The ancients caused the people to have pleasure as well as themselves, and therefore they could enjoy it. 4 'In the Declaration of T'ang it is said, \"O sun, when wilt thou expire? We will die together with thee.\" The people wished for Chieh's death, though they should die with him. Although he had towers, ponds, birds, and animals, how could he have pleasure alone?' 1 King Hûi of Liang said, 'Small as my virtue is, in the government of my kingdom, I do indeed exert my mind to the utmost. If the year be bad on the inside of the river, I remove as many of the people as I can to the east of the river, and convey grain to the country in the inside. When the year is bad on the east of the river, I act on the same plan. On examining the government of the neighboring kingdoms, I do not find that there is any prince who exerts his mind as I do. And yet the people of the neighboring kingdoms do not decrease, nor do my people increase. How is this?' 2 Mencius replied, 'Your majesty is fond of war; −− let me take an illustration from war. −− The soldiers move forward to the sound of the drums; and after their weapons have been crossed, on one side they throw away their coats of mail, trail their arms behind them, and run. Some run a hundred paces and stop; some run fifty paces and stop. What would you think if those who run fifty paces were to laugh at those who run a hundred paces?' The kind said, 'They should not do so. Though they did not run a hundred paces, yet they also ran away.' 'Since your Majesty knows this,' replied Mencius, 'you need not hope that your people will become more numerous than those of the neighboring kingdoms. 3 'If the seasons of husbandry be not interfered with, the grain will be more than can be eaten. If close nets are not allowed to enter the pools and ponds, the fishes and turtles will be more than can be consumed. If the axes and bills enter the hills and forests only at the Chapter 1 3"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"proper time, the wood will be more than can be used. When the grain and fish and turtles are more than can be eaten, and there is more wood than can be used, this enables the people to nourish their living and mourn for their dead, without any feeling against any. This condition, in which the people nourish their living and bury their dead without any feeling against any, is the first step of royal government. 4 'Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five mâu, and persons of fifty years may be clothed with silk. In keeping fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let not their times of breeding be neglected, and persons of seventy years may eat flesh. Let there not be taken away the time that is proper for the cultivation of the farm with its hundred mâ, and the family of several mouths that is supported by it shall not suffer from hunger. Let careful attention be paid to education in schools, inculcating in it especially the filial and fraternal duties, and grey−haired men will not be seen upon the roads, carrying burdens on their backs or on their heads. It never has been that the ruler of a State, where such results were seen, −− persons of seventy wearing silk and eating flesh, and the black−haired people suffering neither from hunger nor cold, −− did not attain to the royal dignity. 5 'Your dogs and swine eat the food of men, and you do not make any restrictive arrangements. There are people dying from famine on the roads, and you do not issue the stores of your granaries for them. When people die, you say, \"It is not owing to me; it is owing to the year.\" In what does this differ from stabbing a man and killing him, and then saying −− \"It was not I; it was the weapon?\" Let your Majesty cease to lay the blame on the year, and instantly from all the nation the people will come to you.' 1 King Hûi of Liang said, 'I wish quietly to receive your instructions.' 2 Mencius replied, 'Is there any difference between killing a man with a stick and with a sword ?' The king said, 'There is no difference! 3 'Is there any difference between doing it with a sword and with the style of government? 'There is no difference,' was the reply. 4 Mencius then said, 'In your kitchen there is fat meat; in your stables there are fat horses. But your people have the look of hunger, and on the wilds there are those who have died of famine. This is leading on beasts to devour men. Chapter 1 4"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"5 'Beasts devour one another, and men hate them for doing so. When a prince, being the parent of his people, administers his government so as to be chargeable with leading on beasts to devour men, where is his parental relation to the people?' 6 Chung−nî said, 'Was he not without posterity who first made wooden images to bury with the dead? So he said, because that man made the semblances of men, and used them for that purpose:−− what shall be thought of him who causes his people to die of hunger?' 1 King Hûi of Liang said, 'There was not in the nation a stronger State than Tsin, as you, venerable Sir, know. But since it descended to me, on the east we have been defeated by Ch'i, and then my eldest son perished; on the west we have lost seven hundred lî of territory to Ch'in; and on the south we have sustained disgrace at the hands of Ch'û. I have brought shame on my departed predecessors, and wish on their account to wipe it away, once for all. What course is to be pursued to accomplish this?' 2 Mencius replied, 'With a territory which is only a hundred lî square, it is possible to attain to the royal dignity. 3 'If Your Majesty will indeed dispense a benevolent government to the people, being sparing in the use of punishments and fines, and making the taxes and levies light, so causing that the fields shall be ploughed deep, and the weeding of them be carefully attended to, and that the strong−bodied, during their days of leisure, shall cultivate their filial piety, fraternal respectfulness, sincerity, and truthfulness, serving thereby, at home, their fathers and elder brothers, and, abroad, their elders and superiors,−− you will then have a people who can be employed, with sticks which they have prepared, to oppose the strong mail and sharp weapons of the troops of Ch'in and Ch'û. 4 'The rulers of those States rob their people of their time, so that they cannot plough and weed their fields, in order to support their parents. Their parents suffer from cold and hunger. Brothers, wives, and children are separated and scattered abroad. 5 'Those rulers, as it were, drive their people into pit−falls, or drown them. Your Majesty will go to punish them. In such a case, who will oppose your Majesty?

Abruptly he asked me, \"How can the kingdom be settled?\" I replied, \"It will be settled by being united under one sway.\" 3 '\"Who can so unite it?\" 4 'I replied, \"He who has no pleasure in killing men can so unite it.\" 5 \"'Who can give it to him?\" 6 'I replied, \" All the people of the nation will unanimously give it to him. Does your Majesty understand the way of the growing grain? During the seventh and eighth months, when drought prevails, the plants become dry. Then the clouds collect densely in the heavens, they send down torrents of rain, and the grain erects itself, as if by a shoot. When it does so, who can keep it back? Now among the shepherds of men throughout the nation, there is not one who does not find pleasure in killing men. If there were one who did not find pleasure in killing men, all the people in the nation would look towards him with outstretched necks. Such being indeed the case, the people would flock to him, as water flows downwards with a rush, which no one can repress.\"' 1 The king Hsüan of Ch'î asked, saying, 'May I be informed by you of the transactions of Hwan of Ch'î, and Wan of Tsin?' 2 Mencius replied, 'There were none of the disciples of Chuncg−nî who spoke about the affairs of Hwan and WAn, and therefore they have not been transmitted to these after−ages ;−− your servant has not heard them. If you will have me speak, let it be about royal government.' 7"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"3 The king said, 'What virtue must there be in order to attain to royal sway?' Mencius answered, 'The love and protection of the people; with this there is no power which can prevent a ruler from attaining to it.' 4 The king asked again, 'Is such an one as I competent to love and protect the people?' Mencius said, 'Yes.' 'How do you know that I am competent for that?' 'I heard the following incident from Hû Ho:−− \"The king,\" said he, \"was sitting aloft in the hall, when a man appeared, leading an ox past the lower part of it. The king saw him, and asked, Where is the ox going? The man replied, We are going to consecrate a bell with its blood. The king said, Let it go. I cannot bear its frightened appearance, as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death. The man answered, Shall we then omit the consecration of the bell ? The king said, How can that be omitted? Change it for a sheep.\" I do not know whether this incident really occurred.' 5 The king replied, 'It did,' and then Mencius said, 'The heart seen in this is sufficient to carry you to the royal sway. The people all supposed that your Majesty grudged the animal, but your servant knows surely, that it was your Majesty's not being able to bear the sight, which made you do as you did.' 6 The king said, 'You are right. And yet there really was an appearance of what the people condemned. But though Chî be a small and narrow State, how should I grudge one ox? Indeed it was because I could not bear its frightened appearance, as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death, that therefore I changed it for a sheep.' 7 Mencius pursued, 'Let not your Majesty deem it strange that the people should think you were grudging the animal. When you changed a large one for a small, how should they know the true reason? If you felt pained by its being led without guilt to the place of death, what was there to choose between an ox and a sheep? The king laughed and said, 'What really was my mind in the matter? I did not grudge the expense of it, and changed it for a sheep!−− There was reason in the people's saying that I grudged it.' 8 'There is no harm in their saying so,' said Mencius. 'Your conduct was an artifice of benevolence. You saw the ox, and had not seen the sheep. So is the superior man affected towards animals, that, having seen them alive, he cannot bear to see them die; having heard their dying cries, he cannot bear to eat their flesh. Therefore he keeps away from his slaughter−house and cook−room.' Chapter 2 8"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"9 The king was pleased, and said, 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The minds of others, I am able by reflection to measure;\" −− this is verified, my Master, in your discovery of my motive. I indeed did the thing, but when I turned my thoughts inward, and examined into it, I could not discover my own mind. When you, Master, spoke those words, the movements of compassion began to work in my mind. How is it that this heart has in it what is equal to the royal sway?' 10 Mencius replied, 'Suppose a man were to make this statement to your Majesty:−− \"My strength is sufficient to lift three thousand catties, but it is not sufficient to lift one feather;−− my eyesight is sharp enough to examine the point of an autumn hair, but I do not see a waggon−load of faggots;−− \"would your Majesty allow what he said?' 'No,' was the answer, on which Mencius proceeded, 'Now here is kindness sufficient to reach to animals, and no benefits are extended from it to the people.−− How is this? Is an exception to be made here? The truth is, the feather is not lifted , because strength is not used; the waggon−load of firewood is not seen, because the eyesight is not used; and the people are not loved and protected, because kindness is not employed. Therefore your Majesty's not exercising the royal sway, is because you do not do it, not because you are not able to do it.' 11 The king asked, 'How may the difference between the not doing a thing, and the not being able to do it, be represented? Mencius replied,'In such a thing as taking the T'âi mountain under your arm, and leaping over the north sea with it, if you say to people−− \"I am not able to do it,\" that is a real case of not being able. In such a matter as breaking off a branch from a tree at the order of a superior, if you say to people−− \"I am not able to do it,\" that is a case of not doing it, it is not a case of not being able to do it. Therefore your Majesty's not exercising the royal sway, is not such a case as that of taking the T'âi mountain under your arm, and leaping over the north sea with it. Your Majesty's not exercising the royal sway is a case like that of breaking off a branch from a tree. 12 'Treat with the reverence due to age the elders in your own family, so that the elders in the families of others shall be similarly treated; treat with the kindness due to youth the young in your own family, so that the young in the families of others shall be similarly treated:−− do this, and the kingdom may be made to go round in your palm. It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"His example affected his wife. It reached to his brothers, and his family of the State was governed by it.\"−− The language shows how king Wan simply took his kindly heart, and exercised it towards those parties. Therefore the carrying out his kindness of heart by a prince will suffice for the love and protection of all within the four seas, and if he do not carry it out, he will not be able to protect his wife and children. The way in which the ancients came greatly to surpass other men, was no other but this:−− simply that they knew well how to carry out, so as to affect others, what they themselves did. Now your kindness is sufficient to reach to animals, and no benefits are extended from it to reach the people.−− How is this? Is an exception to be made here?

The relations of all things may be thus determined, and it is of the greatest importance to estimate the motions of the mind. I beg your Majesty to measure it. 14 'You collect your equipments of war, endanger your soldiers and officers, and excite the resentment of the other princes;−− do these things cause you pleasure in your mind?' 15 The king replied, 'No. How should I derive pleasure from these things? My object in them is to seek for what I greatly desire.' 16 Mencius said, 'May I hear from you what it is that you greatly desire?' The king laughed and did not speak. Mencius resumed, 'Are you led to desire it, because you have not enough of rich and sweet food for your mouth? Or because you have not enough of light and warm clothing for your body? Or because you have not enough of beautifully coloured objects to delight your eyes? Or because you have not voices and tones enough to please your ears? Or because you have not enough of attendants and favourites to stand before you and receive your orders? Your Majesty's various officers are sufficient to supply you with those things. How can your Majesty be led to entertain such a desire on account of them?' 'No,' said the king; 'my desire is not on account of them.' Mencius added, 'Then, what your Majesty greatly desires may be known. You wish to enlarge your territories, to have Ch'in and Ch'û wait at your court, to rule the Middle Kingdom, and to attract to you the barbarous tribes that surround it. But doing what you do to seek for what you desire is like climbing a tree to seek for fish.' 17 The king said, 'Is it so bad as that?' 'It is even worse,' was the reply. 'If you climb a tree to seek for fish, although you do not get the fish, you will not suffer any subsequent calamity. But doing what you do to seek for what you desire, doing it moreover with all your heart, you will assuredly afterwards meet with calamities.' The king asked, 'May I hear from you the proof of that?' Mencius said, 'If the people of Tsâu should fight with the people of Ch'û, which of them does your Majesty think would conquer?' 'The people of Ch'û would conquer.' 'Yes;−− and so it is certain that a small country cannot contend with a great, that few cannot contend with many, that the weak cannot contend with the strong. The territory within the four seas embraces nine divisions, each of a thousand lî square. All Ch'î together is but one of them. If with one part you try to subdue the other eight, what is the difference between that and Tsâu's contending with Ch'û? For, with such a desire, you must turn back to the proper course for its attainment.

And when they are so bent, who will be able to keep them back?' 19 The king said, 'I am stupid, and not able to advance to this. I wish you, my Master, to assist my intentions. Teach me clearly; although I am deficient in intelligence and vigour, I will essay and try to carry your instructions into effect.' 20 Mencius replied, 'They are only men of education, who, without a certain livelihood, are able to maintain a fixed heart. As to the people, if they have not a certain livelihood, it follows that they will not have a fixed heart. And if they have not a fixed heart, there is nothing which they will not do, in the way of self−abandonment, of moral deflection, of depravity, and of wild license. When they thus have been involved in crime, to follow them up and punish them;−− this is to entrap the people. How can such a thing as entrapping the people be done under the rule of a benevolent man? 21 'Therefore an intelligent ruler will regulate the livelihood of the people, so as to make sure that, for those above them, they shall have sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and, for those below them, sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children; that in good years they shall always be abundantly satisfied, and that in bad years they shall escape the danger of perishing. After this he may urge them, and they will proceed to what is good, for in this case the people will follow after it with ease. 22 'Now, the livelihood of the people is so regulated, that, above, they have not sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and, below, they have not sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children. Notwithstanding good years, their lives are continually embittered, and, in bad years, they do not escape perishing. In such circumstances they only try to save themselves from death, and are afraid they will not succeed. What leisure have they to cultivate propriety and righteousness?' 23 'If your Majesty wishes to effect this regulation of the livelihood of the people, why not turn to that which is the essential step to it?

Mencius replied, 'If the king's love of music were very great, the kingdom of Ch'î would be near to a state of good government!' 2 Another day, Mencius, having an interview with the king, said, 'Your Majesty, I have heard, told the officer Chwang, that you love music;−− was it so?' The king changed colour, and said, 'I am unable to love the music of the ancient sovereigns; I only love the music that suits the manners of the present age.' 3 Mencius said, 'If your Majesty's love of music were very great, Ch'î would be near to a state of good government! The music of the present day is just like the music of antiquity, as regards effecting that.' 4 The king said, 'May I hear from you the proof of that?'

Mencius replied, 'It is so in the records.' 2 'Was it so large as that?' exclaimed the king. 'The people,' said Mencius, 'still looked on it as small.' The king added, 'My park contains only forty square lî, and the people still look on it as large. How is this?' 'The park of king Wan,' was the reply, 'contained seventy square lî, but the grass−cutters and fuel−gatherers had the privilege of entrance into it; so also had the catchers of pheasants and hares.

Mencius replied, 'They Chapter 3 15"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"do; and if people generally are not able to enjoy themselves, they condemn their superiors. 2 'For them, when they cannot enjoy themselves, to condemn their superiors is wrong, but when the superiors of the people do not make enjoyment a thing common to the people and themselves, they also do wrong. 3 'When a ruler rejoices in the joy of his people, they also rejoice in his joy; when he grieves at the sorrow of his people, they also grieve at his sorrow. A sympathy of joy will pervade the kingdom ; a sympathy of sorrow will do the same:−− in such a state of things, it cannot be but that the ruler attain to the royal dignity. 4 'Formerly, the duke Ching of Ch'î asked the minister Yen, saying, \"I wish to pay a visit of inspection to Chwan−fû, and Cbâo−wû, and then to bend my course southward along the shore, till I come to Lang−yê. What shall I do that my tour may be fit to be compared with the visits of inspection made by the ancient sovereigns?\" 5 'The minister Yen replied, \"An excellent inquiry! When the Son of Heaven visited the princes, it was called a tour of inspection, that is, be surveyed the States under their care. When the princes attended at the court of the Son of Heaven, it was called a report of office, that is, they reported their administration of their offices. Thus, neither of the proceedings was without a purpose. And moreover, in the spring they examined the ploughing, and supplied any deficiency of seed; in the autumn they examined the reaping, and supplied any deficiency of yield. There is the saying of the Hsiâ dynasty,−− If our king do not take his ramble, what will become of our happiness? If our king do not make his excursion, what will become of our help? That ramble, and that excursion, were a pattern to the princes. 6 '\"Now, the state of things is different.−− A host marches in attendance on the ruler, and stores of provisions are consumed. The hungry are deprived of their food, and there is no rest for those who are called to toil. Maledictions are uttered by one to another with eyes askance, and the people proceed to the commission of wickedness. Thus the royal ordinances are violated, and the people are oppressed, and the supplies of food and drink flow away like water. The rulers yield themselves to the current, or they urge their way against it; they are wild; they are utterly lost:−− these things proceed to the grief of the inferior princes.

Pressing up against it, and forgetting to return, is what I call urging their way against it. Pursuing the chase without satiety is what I call being wild.

He issued a proclamation throughout his State, and went out and occupied a shed in the borders. From that time he began to open his granaries to supply the wants of the people, and calling the Grand music−master, he said to him−− \"Make for me music to suit a prince and his minister pleased with each other.\" And it was then that the Chî−shâo and Chio−shâo were made, in the words to which it was said, \"Is it a fault to restrain one's prince?\" He who restrains his prince loves his prince.' 1 The king Hsüan of Ch'î said, 'People all tell me to pull down and remove the Hall of Distinction. Shall I pull it down, or stop the movement for that object?' 2 Mencius replied, 'The Hall of Distinction is a Hall appropriate to the sovereigns. If your Majesty wishes to practise the true royal government, then do not pull it down.' 3 The king said, 'May I hear from you what the true royal government is?' 'Formerly,' was the reply, 'king Wan's government of Ch'î was as follows:−− The husbandmen cultivated for the government one−ninth of the land; the descendants of officers were salaried; at the passes and in the markets, strangers were inspected, but goods were not taxed: there were no prohibitions respecting the ponds and weirs; the wives and children of criminals were not involved in their guilt. There were the old and wifeless, or widowers; the old and husbandless, or widows; the old and childless, or solitaries ; the young and fatherless, or orphans:−− these four classes are the most destitute of the people, and have none to whom they can tell their wants, and king Wan, in the institution of his government with its benevolent action, made them the first objects of his regard, as it is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The rich may get through life well; But alas! for the miserable and solitary!\"' Chapter 3 17"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"4 The king said, 'O excellent words!' Mencius said, 'Since your Majesty deems them excellent, why do you not practise them?' 'I have an infirmity,' said the king; 'I am fond of wealth.' The reply was, 'Formerly, Kung−lîu was fond of wealth. It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"He reared his ricks, and filled his granaries, He tied up dried provisions and grain, In bottomless bags, and sacks, That he might gather his people together, and glorify his State. With bows and arrows all−displayed, With shields, and spears, and battle−axes, large and small, He commenced his march.\" In this way those who remained in their old seat had their ricks and granaries, and those who marched had their bags of provisions. It was not till after this that he thought he could begin his march. If your Majesty loves wealth, give the people power to gratify the same feeling, and what difficulty will there be in your attaining the royal sway?' 5 The king said, 'I have an infirmity; I am fond of beauty.' The reply was, 'Formerly, king T'âi was fond of beauty, and loved his wife. It is said in the Book of Poetry, Kû−kung T'an−fû Came in the morning, galloping his horse, By the banks of the western waters, As far as the foot of Ch'î hill, Along with the lady of Chiang; They came and together chose the site for their settlement.\" At that time, in the seclusion of the house, there were no dissatisfied women, and abroad, there were no unmarried men. If your Majesty loves beauty, let the people be able to gratify the same feeling, and what difficulty will there be in your attaining the royal sway?' 1 Mencius said to the king Hsüan of Ch'î, 'Suppose that one of your Majesty's ministers were to entrust his wife and children to the care of his friend, while he himself went into Ch'û to travel, and that, on his return, he should find that the friend had let his wife and children suffer from cold and hunger;−− how ought he to deal with him?' The king said, 'He should cast him off.' 2 Mencius proceeded, 'Suppose that the chief criminal judge could not regulate the officers under him, how would you deal with him?' The king said, 'Dismiss him.' 3 Mencius again said, 'If within the four borders of your kingdom there is not good government, what is to be done?'

Your Majesty has no intimate ministers even. Those whom you advanced yesterday are gone to−day, and you do not know it.' 2 The king said, 'How shall I know that they have not ability, and so avoid employing them at all?' 3 The reply was, 'The ruler of a State advances to office men of talents and virtue only as a matter of necessity. Since he will thereby cause the low to overstep the honourable, and distant to overstep his near relatives, ought he to do so but with caution? 4 'When all those about you say,−− \"This is a man of talents and worth,\" you may not therefore believe it. When your great officers all say,−− \"This is a man of talents and virtue,\" neither may you for that believe it.

The robber and ruffian we call a mere fellow. I have heard of the cutting off of the fellow Châu, but I have not heard of the putting a sovereign to death, in his case.' 1 Mencius, having an interview with the king Hsüan of Ch'î, said to him, 'If you are going to build a large mansion, you will surely cause the Master of the workmen to look out for large trees, and when he has found such large trees, you will be glad, thinking that they will answer for the intended object. Should the workmen hew them so as to make them too small, then your Majesty will be angry, thinking that they will not answer for the purpose. Now, a man spends his youth in learning the principles of right government, and, being grown up to vigour, he wishes to put them in practice;−− if your Majesty says to him, \"For the present put aside what you have learned, and follow me,\" what shall we say? 2 'Here now you have a gem unwrought, in the stone.

For a kingdom of ten thousand chariots, attacking another of ten thousand chariots, to complete the conquest of it in fifty days, is an achievement beyond mere human strength. If I do not take possession of it, calamities from Heaven will surely come upon me. What do you say to my taking possession of it?' 3 Mencius replied, 'If the people of Yen will be pleased with your taking possession of it, then do so.−− Among the ancients there was one who acted on this principle, namely king Wû.

If you make the water more deep and the fire more fierce, they will in like manner make another revolution.' 1 The people of Ch'î, having smitten Yen, took possession of it, and upon this, the princes of the various States deliberated together, and resolved to deliver Yen from their power. The king Hsüan said to Mencius, 'The princes have formed many plans to attack me:−− how shall I prepare myself for them?' Mencius replied, 'I have heard of one who with seventy lî exercised all the functions of government throughout the kingdom. That was T'ang. I have never heard of a prince with a thousand lî standing in fear of others.' 2 'It is said in the Book of History, As soon as T'ang began his work of executing justice, he commenced with Ko. The whole kingdom had confidence in him. When he pursued his work in the east, the rude tribes on the west murmured. So did those on the north, when he was engaged in the south. Their cry was−− \"Why does he put us last?\" Thus, the people looked to him, as we look in a time of great drought to the clouds and rainbows. The frequenters of the markets stopped not. The husbandmen made no change in their operations. While he punished their rulers, he consoled the people. His progress was like the falling of opportune rain, and the people were delighted. It is said again in the Book of History, \"We have waited for our prince long; the prince's coming will be our reviving!\" 3 'Now the ruler of Yen was tyrannizing over his people, and your Majesty went and punished him. The people supposed that you were going to deliver them out of the water and the fire, and brought baskets of rice and vessels of congee, to meet your Majesty's host. But you have slain their fathers and elder brothers, and put their sons and younger brothers in confinement. You have pulled down the ancestral temple of the State, and are removing to Ch'î its precious vessels. How can such a course be deemed proper? The rest of the kingdom is indeed jealously afraid of the strength of Ch'î; and now, when with a doubled territory you do not put in practice a benevolent government;−− it is this which sets the arms of the kingdom in in motion. 4 'If your Majesty will make haste to issue an ordinance, restoring your captives, old and young, stopping the removal of the precious vessels, and saying that, after consulting with Chapter 4 21"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"the people of Yen, you will appoint them a ruler, and withdraw from the country;−− in this way you may still be able to stop the threatened attack.' 1 There had been a brush between Tsâu and Lû, when the duke Mû asked Mencius, saying,'Of my officers there were killed thirty−three men, and none of the people would die in their defence. Though I sentenced them to death for their conduct, it is impossible to put such a multitude to death. If I do not put them to death, then there is the crime unpunished of their looking angrily on at the death of their officers, and not saving them. How is the exigency of the case to be met?' 2 Mencius replied, 'In calamitous years and years of famine, the old and weak of your people, who have been found lying in the ditches and water−channels, and the able−bodied who have been scattered about to the four quarters, have amounted to several thousands. All the while, your granaries, 0 prince, have been stored with grain, and your treasuries and arsenals have been full, and not one of your officers has told you of the distress. Thus negligent have the superiors in your State been, and cruel to their inferiors. The philosopher Tsang said, \"Beware, beware. What proceeds from you, will return to you again.\" Now at length the people have paid back the conduct of their officers to them. Do not you, 0 prince, blame them. 3 'If you will put in practice a benevolent government, this people will love you and all above them, and will die for their officers.' 1 The duke Wan of T'ang asked Mencius, saying, 'T'ang is a small kingdom, and lies between Ch'î and Ch'û. Shall I serve Ch'î? Or shall I serve Chû?' 2 Mencius replied, 'This plan which you propose is beyond me. If you will have me counsel you, there is one thing I can suggest. Dig deeper your moats; build higher your walls; guard them as well as your people. In case of attack, be prepared to die in your defence, and have the people so that they will not leave you;−− this is a proper course. 1 The duke Wan of T'ang asked Mencius, saying, 'The people of Ch'î are going to fortify Hsieh.

It was a matter of necessity with him. 3 'If you do good, among your descendants, in after generations, there shall be one who will attain to the royal dignity. A prince lays the foundation of the inheritance, and hands down the beginning which he has made, doing what may be continued by his successors. As to the accomplishment of the great result, that is with Heaven. What is that Ch'î to you, 0 prince? Be strong to do good.

Mencius replied, 'Formerly, when king T'âi dwelt in Pin, the barbarians of the north were constantly making incursions upon it. He served them with skins and silks, and still he suffered from them. He served them with dogs and horses, and still he suffered from them. He served them with pearls and gems, and still he suffered from them. Seeing this, he assembled the old men, and announced to them, saying, \"What the barbarians want is my territory. I have heard this,−− that a ruler does not injure his people with that wherewith he nourishes them. My children, why should you be troubled about having no prince? I will leave this.\" Accordingly, he left Pin, crossed the mountain Liang, built a town at the foot of mount Ch'î, and dwelt there. The people of Pin said, \"He is a benevolent man. We must not lose him.\" Those who followed him looked like crowds hastening to market. 2 'On the other hand, some say, \"The kingdom is a thing to be kept from generation to generation. One individual cannot undertake to dispose of it in his own person. Let him be prepared to die for it.

He said, 'Prince, why have you not gone to see Mang K'o?' the duke said, 'One told me that, on the occasion of the scholar Mang's second mourning, his observances exceeded those of the former. It is on that account that I have not gone to see him.' 'How is this!' answered Yo−chang.

Yo−chAng said, 'That cannot be called \"exceeding.\" That was the difference between being poor and being rich.' 3 After this, Yo−chang saw Mencius, and said to him, 'I told the prince about you, and he was consequently coming to see you, when one of his favourites, named Tsang Ts'ang, stopped him, and therefore he did not come according to his purpose.'

From T'ang to Wû−ting there had appeared six or seven worthy and sage sovereigns. The kingdom had been attached to Yin for a long time, and this length of time made a change difficult. Wû−ting had all the princes coming to his court, and possessed the kingdom as if it had been a thing which he moved round in his palm. Then, Châu was removed from Wû−ting by no great interval of time. There were still remaining some of the ancient families and of the old manners, of the influence also which had emanated from the earlier sovereigns, and of their good government. Moreover, there were the viscount of Wei and his second son, their Royal Highnesses Pî−kan and the viscount of Ch'î, and Kâo−ko, all men of ability and virtue, who gave their joint assistance to Châu in his government. In consequence of these things, it took a long time for him to lose the throne. There was not a foot of ground which he did not possess. There was not one of all the people who was not his subject. So it was on his side, and king Wan at his beginning had only a territory of one hundred square lî. On all these accounts, it was difficult for him immediately to attain to the royal dignity. 9 'The people of Ch'î have a saying−− \"A man may have wisdom and discernment, but that is not like embracing the favourable opportunity. A man may have instruments of husbandry, but that is not like waiting for the farming seasons.\" The present time is one in which the royal dignity may be easily attained. 10 'In the flourishing periods of the Hsiâ, Yin, and Châu dynasties, the royal domain did not exceed a thousand lî, and Ch'î embraces so much territory. Cocks crow and dogs bark to one another, all the way to the four borders of the State:−− so Ch'î possesses the people. No change is needed for the enlarging of its territory: no change is needed for the collecting of a population. If its ruler will put in practice a benevolent government, no power will be able to prevent his becoming sovereign. 11 'Moreover, never was there a time farther removed than the present from the rise of a true sovereign: never was there a time when the sufferings of the people from tyrannical government were more intense than the present.

It is only at this time that such could be the case.' 1 Kung−sun Ch'âu asked Mencius, saying, 'Master, if you were to be appointed a high noble and the prime minister of Ch'î, so as to be able to carry your principles into practice, though you should thereupon raise the ruler to the headship of all the other princes, or even to the royal dignity, it would not be to be wondered at.−− In such a position would your mind be perturbed or not?' Mencius replied, 'No. At forty, I attained to an unperturbed mind.' 2 Ch'âu said, 'Since it is so with you, my Master, you are far beyond Mang Pan.' 'The mere attainment,' said Mencius, 'is not difficult. The scholar Kâo had attained to an unperturbed mind at an earlier period of life than I did.' 3 Ch'âu asked, 'Is there any way to an unperturbed mind?' The answer was, 'Yes. 4 'Pî−kung Yû had this way of nourishing his valour:−− He did not flinch from any strokes at his body. He did not turn his eyes aside from any thrusts at them.

He viewed stabbing a prince of ten thousand chariots just as stabbing a fellow dressed in cloth of hair. He feared not any of all the princes.

If, on self−examination, I find that I am upright, I will go forward against thousands and tens of thousands.'\" 8 Yet, what Mang Shih−shê maintained, being merely his physical energy, was after all inferior to what the philosopher Tsang maintained, which was indeed of the most importance.' 9 Kung−sun Ch'âu said, 'May I venture to ask an explanation from you, Master, of how you maintain an unperturbed mind, and how the philosopher Kâo does the same?' Mencius answered,'Kâo says,−− \"What is not attained in words is not to be sought for in the mind; what produces dissatisfaction in the mind, is not to be helped by passion−effort.\" This last,−− when there is unrest in the mind, not to seek for relief from passion−effort, may be conceded. But not to seek in the mind for what is not attained in words cannot be conceded. The will is the leader of the passion−nature. The passion−nature pervades and animates the body. The will is first and chief, and the passion−nature is subordinate to it. Therefore I say,−− Maintain firm the will, and do no violence to the passion−nature.' 10 Ch'âu observed, 'Since you say−− \"The will is chief, and the passion−nature is subordinate,\" how do you also say, \"Maintain firm the will, and do no violence to the passion−nature?\"' Mencius replied, 'When it is the will alone which is active, it moves the passion−nature. When it is the passion−nature alone which is active, it moves the will. For instance now, in the case of a man falling or running, that is from the passion−nature, and yet it moves the mind.' 11 'I venture to ask,' said Ch'âu again, 'wherein you, Master, surpass Kâo.' Mencius told him, 'I understand words. I am skilful in nourishing my vast, flowing passion−nature.' 12 Ch'âu pursued, 'I venture to ask what you mean by your vast, flowing passion−nature!' The reply was, 'It is difficult to describe it. 13 'This is the passion−nature:−− It is exceedingly great, and exceedingly strong.

I therefore said, \"Kâo has never understood righteousness, because he makes it something external.\" 16 'There must be the constant practice of this righteousness, but without the object of thereby nourishing the passion−nature. Let not the mind forget its work, but let there be no assisting the growth of that nature. Let us not be like the man of Sung. There was a man of Sung, who was grieved that his growing corn was not longer, and so he pulled it up. Having done this, he returned home, looking very stupid, and said to his people, \"I am tired to−day. I have been helping the corn to grow long.\" His son ran to look at it, and found the corn all withered. There are few in the world, who do not deal with their passion−nature, as if they were assisting the corn to grow long.

What they do is not only of no benefit to the nature, but it also injures it.' 17 Kung−sun Ch'âu further asked, 'What do you mean by saying that you understand whatever words you hear?' Mencius replied, 'When words are one−sided, I know how the mind of the speaker is clouded over. When words are extravagant, I know how the mind is fallen and sunk. When words are all−depraved, I know how the mind has departed from principle. When words are evasive, I know how the mind is at its wit's end. These evils growing in the mind, do injury to government, and, displayed in th government, are hurtful to the conduct of affairs. When a Sage shall again arise, he will certainly follow my words.' 18 On this Ch'âu observed, 'Tsâi Wo and Tsze−kung were skilful in speaking. Zan Niû, the disciple Min, and Yen Yüan, while their words were good, were distinguished for their virtuous conduct. Confucius united the qualities of the disciples in himself, but still he said, \"In the matter of speeches, I am not competent.\"−− Then, Master, have you attained to be a Sage?' 19 Mencius said, 'Oh! what words are these? Formerly Tsze−kung asked Confucius, saying, \"Master, are you a Sage?\" Confucius answered him, \"A Sage is what I cannot rise to.

Zan Niû, the disciple Min, and Yen Yüan had all the members, but in small proportions. I venture to ask,−− With which of these are you pleased to rank yourself?' 21 Mencius replied, 'Let us drop speaking about these, if you please.' 22 Ch'âu then asked, 'What do you say of Po−î and Î Yin?' 'Their ways were different from mine,' said Mencius. 'Not to serve a prince whom he did not esteem, nor command a people whom he did not approve; in a time of good government to take office, and on the occurrence of confusion to retire:−− this was the way of Po−î. To say−− \"Whom may I not serve? My serving him makes him my ruler. What people may I not command? My commanding them makes them my people.\" In a time of good government to take office, and when disorder prevailed, also to take office:−− that was the way of Î Yin. When it was proper to go into office, then to go into it; when it was proper to keep retired from office, then to keep retired from it; when it was proper to continue in it long, then to continue in it long − when it was proper to withdraw from it quickly, then to withdraw quickly:−− that was the way of Confucius. These were all sages of antiquity, and I have not attained to do what they did. But what I wish to do is to learn to be like Confucius.' 23 Ch'âu said, 'Comparing Po−î and Î Yin with Confucius, are they to be placed in the same rank?' Mencius replied, 'No. Since there were living men until now, there never was another Confucius.' 24 Ch'âu said, 'Then, did they have any points of agreement with him?' The reply was,−− 'Yes. If they had been sovereigns over a hundred lî of territory, they would, all of them, have brought all the princes to attend in their court, and have obtained the throne. And none of them, in order to obtain the throne, would have committed one act of unrighteousness, or put to death one innocent person. In those things they agreed with him.' 25 Ch'âu said, 'I venture to ask wherein he differed from them.' Mencius replied, 'Tsâi Wo, Tsze−kung, and Yû Zo had wisdom sufficient to know the sage.

A leader of the princes requires a large kingdom. He who, using virtue, practises benevolence is the sovereign of the kingdom. To become the sovereign of the kingdom, a prince need not wait for a large kingdom. T'ang did it with only seventy lî, and king Wan with only a hundred. 2 'When one by force subdues men, they do not submit to him in heart. They submit, because their strength is not adequate to resist. When one subdues men by virtue, in their hearts' core they are pleased, and sincerely submit, as was the case with the seventy disciples in their submission to Confucius. What is said in the Book of Poetry, \"From the west, from the east, From the south, from the north, There was not one who thought of refusing submission,\" is an illustration of this.' 1 Mencius said, 'Benevolence brings glory to a prince, and the opposite of it brings disgrace. For the princes of the present day to hate disgrace and yet to live complacently doing what is not benevolent, is like hating moisture and yet living in a low situation. 2 'If a prince hates disgrace, the best course for him to pursue, is to esteem virtue and honour virtuous scholars, giving the worthiest among them places of dignity, and the able offices of trust. When throughout his kingdom there is leisure and rest from external troubles, let him, taking advantage of such a season, clearly digest the principles of his government with its legal sanctions, and then even great kingdoms will be constrained to stand in awe of him. 3 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Before the heavens were dark with rain, I gathered the bark from the roots of the mulberry trees, And wove it closely to form the window and door of my nest; Now, I thought, ye people below, Perhaps ye will not dare to insult me.\" Confucius said, \"Did not he who made this ode understand the way of governing?\" If a prince is able rightly to govern his kingdom, who will dare to insult him? 4 'But now the princes take advantage of the time when throughout their kingdoms there is leisure and rest from external troubles, to abandon themselves to pleasure and indolent indifference;−− they in fact seek for calamities for themselves. 32"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"5 'Calamity and happiness in all cases are men's own seeking. 6 'This is illustrated by what is said in the Book of Poetry,−− Be always studious to be in harmony with the ordinances of God, So you will certainly get for yourself much happiness;\" and by the passage of the Tâi Chiah,−− \"When Heaven sends down calamities, it is still possible to escape from them; when we occasion the calamities ourselves, it is not possible any longer to live.\"' 1 Mencius said, 'If a ruler give honour to men of talents and virtue and employ the able, so that offices shall all be filled by individuals of distinction and mark;−− then all the scholars of the kingdom will be pleased, and wish to stand in his court. 2 'If, in the market−place of his capital, he levy a ground−rent on the shops but do not tax the goods, or enforce the proper regulations without levying a ground−rent;−− then all the traders of the kingdom will be pleased, and wish to store their goods in his market−place. 3 'If, at his frontier−passes, there be an inspection of persons, but no taxes charged on goods or other articles, then all the travellers of the kingdom will be pleased, and wish to make their tours on his roads. 4 'If he require that the husbandmen give their mutual aid to cultivate the public field, and exact no other taxes from them;−− then all the husbandmen of the kingdom will be pleased, and wish to plough in his fields. 5 'If from the occupiers of the shops in his market−place he do not exact the fine of the individual idler, or of the hamlet's quota of cloth, then all the people of the kingdom will be pleased, and wish to come and be his people. 6 'If a ruler can truly practise these five things, then the people in the neighbouring kingdoms will look up to him as a parent.

When with a commiserating mind was practised a commiserating government, to rule the kingdom was as easy a matter as to make anything go round in the palm. 3 'When I say that all men have a mind which cannot bear to see the sufferings of others, my meaning may be illustrated thus:−− even now−a−days, if men suddenly see a child about to fall into a well, they will without exception experience a feeling of alarm and distress. They will feel so, not as a ground on which they may gain the favour of the child's parents, nor as a ground on which they may seek the praise of their neighbours and friends, nor from a dislike to the reputation of having been unmoved by such a thing. 4 'From this case we may perceive that the feeling of commiseration is essential to man, that the feeling of shame and dislike is essential to man, that the feeling of modesty and complaisance is essential to man, and that the feeling of approving and disapproving is essential to man. 5 'The feeling of commiseration is the principle of benevolence. The feeling of shame and dislike is the principle of righteousness. The feeling of modesty and complaisance is the principle of propriety. The feeling of approving and disapproving is the principle of knowledge. 6 'Men have these four principles just as they have their four limbs. When men, having these four principles, yet say of themselves that they cannot develop them, they play the thief with themselves, and he who says of his prince that he cannot develop them plays the thief with his prince. 7 'Since all men have these four principles in themselves, let them know to give them all their development and completion, and the issue will be like that of fire which has begun to burn, or that of a spring which has begun to find vent.

And yet, the arrow−maker's only fear is lest men should not be hurt, and the armour−maker's only fear is lest men should be hurt. So it is with the priest and the coffin−maker. The choice of a profession, therefore, is a thing in which great caution is required. 2 'Confucius said, \"It is virtuous manners which constitute the excellence of a neighbourhood. If a man, in selecting a residence, do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?\" Now, benevolence is the most honourable dignity conferred by Heaven, and the quiet home in which man should dwell. Since no one can hinder us from being so, if yet we are not benevolent;−− this is being not wise. 3 'From the want of benevolence and the want of wisdom will ensue the entire absence of propriety and righteousness;−− he who is in such a case must be the servant of other men. To be the servant of men and yet ashamed of such servitude, is like a bowmaker's being ashamed to make bows, or an arrow−maker's being ashamed to make arrows. 4 'If he be ashamed of his case, his best course is to practise benevolence. 5 'The man who would be benevolent is like the archer. The archer adjusts himself and then shoots. If he misses, he does not murmur against those who surpass himself. He simply turns round and seeks the cause of his failure in himself.' 1 Mencius said, 'When any one told Tsze−lû that he had a fault, he rejoiced. 2 'When Yü heard good words, he bowed to the speaker. 3 'The great Shun had a still greater delight in what was good.

Therefore, there is no attribute of the superior man greater than his helping men to practise virtue.' 1 Mencius said, 'Po−î would not serve a prince whom he did not approve, nor associate with a friend whom he did not esteem. He would not stand in a bad prince's court, nor speak with a bad man. To stand in a bad prince's court, or to speak with a bad man, would have been to him the same as to sit with his court robes and court cap amid mire and ashes. Pursuing the examination of his dislike to what was evil, we find that he thought it necessary, if he happened to be standing with a villager whose cap was not rightly adjusted, to leave him with a high air, as if he were going to be defiled. Therefore, although some of the princes made application to him with very proper messages, he would not receive their gifts.−− He would not receive their gifts, counting it inconsistent with his purity to go to them. 2 'Hûi of Liû−hsiâ was not ashamed to serve an impure prince, nor did he think it low to be an inferior officer. When advanced to employment, he did not conceal his virtue, but made it a point to carry out his principles. When neglected and left without office, he did not murmur. When straitened by poverty, he did not grieve. Accordingly, he had a saying,\"You are you, and I am I. Although you stand by my side with breast and aims bare, or with your body naked, how can you defile me?\" Therefore, self−possessed, he companied with men indifferently, at the same time not losing himself.

Yet it is obliged to be given up and abandoned. This is because advantages of situation afforded by the Earth are not equal to the union arising from the accord of Men. 4 'In accordance with these principles it is said, \"A people is bounded in, not by the limits of dykes and borders; a State is secured, not by the strengths of mountains and rivers; the kingdom is overawed, not by the sharpness and strength of arms.\" He who finds the proper course has many to assist him.

Therefore, the true ruler will prefer not to fight; but if he do fight, he must overcome.' 1 As Mencius was about to go to court to see the king, the king sent a person to him with this message,−− 'I was wishing to come and see you. But I have got a cold, and may not expose myself to the wind. In the morning I will hold my court. I do not know whether you will give me the opportunity of seeing you then.'

May this not be regarded as improper?' 'Yesterday,' said Mencius, 'I was unwell; to−day, I am better:−− why should I not pay this visit?' 3 In the mean time, the king sent a messenger to inquire about his sickness, and also a physician. Mang Chung replied to them, 'Yesterday, when the king's order came, he was feeling a little unwell, and could not go to the court. To−day he was a little better, and hastened to go to court. I do not know whether he can have reached it by this time or not.' Having said this, he sent several men to look for Mencius on the way, and say to him, 'I beg that, before you return home, you will go to the court.' 4 On this, Mencius felt himself compelled to go to Ching Ch'âu's, and there stop the night. Mr. Ching said to him, 'In the family, there is the relation of father and son; abroad, there is the relation of prince and minister. These are the two great relations among men. Between father and son the ruling principle is kindness. Between prince and minister the ruling principle is respect. I have seen the respect of the king to you, Sir, but I have not seen in what way you show respect to him.' Mencius replied, 'Oh! what words are these? Among the people of Ch'î there is no one who speaks to the king about benevolence and righteousness. Are they thus silent because they do not think that benevolence and righteousness are admirable? No, but in their hearts they say, \"This man is not fit to be spoken with about benevolence and righteousness.\" Thus they manifest a disrespect than which there can be none greater. I do not dare to set forth before the king any but the ways of Yâo and Shun. There is therefore no man of Ch'î who respects the king so much as I do.' 5 Mr. Ching said, 'Not so. That was not what I meant. In the Book of Rites it is said, \"When a father calls, the answer must be without a moment's hesitation. When the prince's order calls, the carriage must not be waited for.\" You were certainly going to the court, but when you heard the king's order, then you did not carry your purpose out. This does seem as if it were not in accordance with that rule of propriety.' 6 Mencius answered him, 'How can you give that meaning to my conduct? The philosopher Tsang said, \"The wealth of Tsin and Ch'û cannot be equalled. Let their rulers have their wealth:−− I have my benevolence. Let them have their nobility:−− I have my righteousness. Wherein should I be dissatisfied as inferior to them?\" Now shall we say that these sentiments are not right? Seeing that the philosopher Tsang spoke them, there is in them, I apprehend, a real principle.−− In the kingdom there are three things universally acknowledged to be honourable.

How can the possession of only one of these be presumed on to despise one who possesses the other two? 7 'Therefore a prince who is to accomplish great deeds will certainly have ministers whom he does not call to go to him. When he wishes to consult with them, he goes to them. The prince who does not honour the virtuous, and delight in their ways of doing, to this extent, is not worth having to do with. 8 'Accordingly, there was the behaviour of T'ang to Î Yin:−− he first learned of him, and then employed him as his minister; and so without difficulty he became sovereign. There was the behaviour of the duke Hwan to Kwan Chung:−− he first learned of him, and then employed him as his minister; and so without difficulty he became chief of all the princes. 9 'Now throughout the kingdom, the territories of the princes are of equal extent, and in their achievements they are on a level. Not one of them is able to exceed the others. This is from no other reason, but that they love to make ministers of those whom they teach, and do not love to make ministers of those by whom they might be taught. 10 'So did T'ang behave to Î Yin, and the duke Hwan to Kwan Chung, that they would not venture to call them to go to them.

He pushed himself into the service of government. His prince declining to employ him, he had to retire indeed, but he again schemed that his son or younger brother should be made a high officer. Who indeed is there of men but wishes for riches and honour? But he only, among the seekers of these, tried to monopolize the conspicuous mound. 7 '\"Of old time, the market−dealers exchanged the articles which they had for others which they had not, and simply had certain officers to keep order among them. It happened that there was a mean fellow, who made it a point to look out for a conspicuous mound, and get up upon it. Thence he looked right and left, to catch in his net the whole gain of the market. The people all thought his conduct mean, and therefore they proceeded to lay a tax upon his wares. The taxing of traders took its rise from this mean fellow.\"' 1 Mencius, having taken his leave of Ch'î, was passing the night in Châu.

Mencius gave him no answer, but leant upon his stool and slept. 3 The visitor was displeased, and said, 'I passed the night in careful vigil, before I would venture to speak to you, and you, Master, sleep and do not listen to me. Allow me to request that I may not again presume to see you.' Mencius replied, 'Sit down, and I will explain the case clearly to you. Formerly, if the duke Mû had not kept a person by the side of Tsze−sze, he could not have induced Tsze−sze to remain with him. If Hsieh Liû and Shan Hsiang had not had a remembrancer by the side of the duke Mû, he would not have been able to make them feel at home and remain with him. 4 'You anxiously form plans with reference to me, but you do not treat me as Tsze−sze was treated. Is it you, Sir, who cut me? Or is it I who cut you? 1 When Mencius had left Ch'î, Yin Shih spoke about him to others, saying, 'If he did not know that the king could not be made a T'ang or a Wû, that showed his want of intelligence. If he knew that he could not be made such, and came notwithstanding, that shows he was seeking his own benefit. He came a thousand lî to wait on the king; because he did not find in him a ruler to suit him, he took his leave, but how dilatory and lingering was his departure, stopping three nights before he quitted Châu! I am dissatisfied on account of this.' 2 The disciple Kâo informed Mencius of these remarks. 3 Mencius said, 'How should Yin Shih know me! When I came a thousand lî to wait on the king, it was what I desired to do. When I went away because I did not find in him a ruler to suit me, was that what I desired to do? I felt myself constrained to do it. 4 'When I stopped three nights before I quitted Châu, in my own mind I still considered my departure speedy. I was hoping that the king might change.

They will remonstrate with their prince, and on their remonstrance not being accepted, they get angry; and, with their passion displayed in their countenance, they take their leave, and travel with all their strength for a whole day, before they will stop for the night.' 7 When Yin Shih heard this explanation, he said, 'I am indeed a small man.' 1 When Mencius left Ch'î, Ch'ung Yü questioned him upon the way, saying, 'Master, you look like one who carries an air of dissatisfaction in his countenance. But formerly I heard you say−− \"The superior man does not murmur against Heaven, nor grudge against men.\"' 2 Mencius said, 'That was one time, and this is another. 3 'It is a rule that a true royal sovereign should arise in the course of five hundred years, and that during that time there should be men illustrious in their generation. 4 'From the commencement of the Châu dynasty till now, more than seven hundred years have elapsed. Judging numerically, the date is past. Examining the character of the present time, we might expect the rise of such individuals in it. 5 'But Heaven does not yet wish that the kingdom should enjoy tranquillity and good order. If it wished this, who is there besides me to bring it about? How should I be otherwise than dissatisfied?' 1 When Mencius left Ch'î, he dwelt in Hsiû.

Mencius said to him, 'Prince, do you doubt my words? The path is one, and only one. 4 'Ch'ang Chi'en said to duke King of Ch'î, \"They were men. I am a man. Why should I stand in awe of them?\" Yen Yüan said, \"What kind of man was Shun? What kind of man am I?

Now, alas! this great duty to my father devolves upon me; I wish to send you to ask the advice of Mencius, and then to proceed to its various services' 2 Zan Yû accordingly proceeded to Tsâu, and consulted Mencius. Mencius said, 'Is this not good? In discharging the funeral duties to parents, men indeed feel constrained to do their utmost.

His aged relatives, and the body of the officers, did not wish that it should be so, and said, 'The former princes of Lû, that kingdom which we honour, have, none of them, observed this practice, neither have any of our own former princes observed it. For you to act contrary to their example is not proper. Moreover, the History says,−− \"In the observances of mourning and sacrifice, ancestors are to be followed,\" meaning that they received those things from a proper source to hand them down.' 4 The prince said again to Zan Yû, 'Hitherto, I have not given myself to the pursuit of learning, but have found my pleasure in horsemanship and sword−exercise, and now I don't come up to the wishes of my aged relatives and the officers. I am afraid I may not be able to discharge my duty in the great business that I have entered on; do you again consult Mencius for me.' On this, Zan Yû went again to Tsâu, and consulted Mencius. Mencius said, 'It is so, but he may not seek a remedy in others, but only in himself. Confucius said, \"When a prince dies, his successor entrusts the administration to the prime minister. He sips the congee. His face is of a deep black. He approaches the place of mourning, and weeps. Of all the officers and inferior ministers there is not one who will presume not to join in the lamentation, he setting them this example. What the superior loves, his inferiors will be found to love exceedingly. The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that between the wind and grass. The grass must bend when the wind blows upon it.\" The business depends on the prince.' 5 Zan Yû returned with this answer to his commission, and the prince said, 'It is so. The matter does indeed depend on me.' So for five months he dwelt in the shed, without issuing an order or a caution. All the officers and his relatives said, 'He may be said to understand the ceremonies.' When the time of interment arrived, they came from all quarters of the State to witness it. Those who had come from other States to condole with him, were greatly pleased with the deep dejection of his countenance and the mournfulness of his wailing and weeping. 1 The duke Wan of T'ang asked Mencius about the proper way of governing a kingdom. 2 Mencius said, 'The business of the people may not be remissly attended to. It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"In the day−light go and gather the grass, And at night twist your ropes; Then get up quickly on the roofs;−− Soon must we begin sowing again the grain.\" Chapter 9 49"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"3 'The way of the people is this:−− If they have a certain livelihood, they will have a fixed heart; if they have not a certain livelihood, they have not a fixed heart. If they have not a fixed heart, there is nothing which they will not do in the way of self−abandonment, of moral deflection, of depravity, and of wild license. When they have thus been involved in crime, to follow them up and punish them:−− this is to entrap the people. How can such a thing as entrapping the people be done under the rule of a benevolent man? 4 'Therefore, a ruler who is endowed with talents and virtue will be gravely complaisant and economical, showing a respectful politeness to his ministers, and taking from the people only in accordance with regulated limits. 5 'Yang Hû said, \"He who seeks to be rich will not be benevolent. He who wishes to be benevolent will not be rich.\" 6 'The sovereign of the Hsiâ dynasty enacted the fifty mâu allotment, and the payment of a tax. The founder of the Yin enacted the seventy mâu allotment, and the system of mutual aid. The founder of the Châu enacted the hundred mâu allotment, and the share system. In reality, what was paid in all these was a tithe. The share system means mutual division. The aid system means mutual dependence. 7 'Lung said, \"For regulating the lands, there is no better system than that of mutual aid, and none which is not better than that of taxing. By the tax system, the regular amount was fixed by taking the average of several years. In good years, when the grain lies about in abundance, much might be taken without its being oppressive, and the actual exaction would be small. But in bad years, the produce being not sufficient to repay the manuring of the fields, this system still requires the taking of the full amount. When the parent of the people causes the people to wear looks of distress, and, after the whole year's toil, yet not to be able to nourish their parents, so that they proceed to borrowing to increase their means, till the old people and children are found lying in the ditches and water−channels:−− where, in such a case, is his parental relation to the people?\" 8 'As to the system of hereditary salaries, that is already observed in T'ang. 9 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"May the rain come down on our public field, And then upon our private fields!\" It is only in the system of mutual aid that there is a public field, and from Chapter 9 50"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"this passage we perceive that even in the Châu dynasty this system has been recognised. 10 'Establish hsiang, hsü, hsio, and hsiâo,−− all those educational institutions,−− for the instruction of the people.

By the Hsiâ dynasty the name hsiâo was used; by the Yin, that of hsü; and by the Châu, that of hsiang. As to the hsio, they belonged to the three dynasties, and by that name. The object of them all is to illustrate the human relations. When those are thus illustrated by superiors, kindly feeling will prevail among the inferior people below. 11 'Should a real sovereign arise, he will certainly come and take an example from you; and thus you will be the teacher of the true sovereign. 12 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, Although Châu. was an old country, It received a new destiny.\" That is said with reference to king Wan. Do you practise those things with vigour, and you also will by them make new your kingdom.' 13 The duke afterwards sent Pî Chan to consult Mencius about the nine−squares system of dividing the land. Mencius said to him, 'Since your prince, wishing to put in practice a benevolent government, has made choice of you and put you into this employment, you must exert yourself to the utmost. Now, the first thing towards a benevolent government must be to lay down the boundaries. If the boundaries be not defined correctly, the division of the land into squares will not be equal, and the produce available for salaries will not be evenly distributed. On this account, oppressive rulers and impure ministers are sure to neglect this defining of the boundaries. When the boundaries have been defined correctly, the division of the fields and the regulation of allowances may be determined by you, sitting at your ease. 14 'Although the territory of T'Ang is narrow and small, yet there must be in it men of a superior grade, and there must be in it country−men. If there were not men of a superior grade, there would be none to rule the country−men. If there were not country−men, there would be none to support the men of superior grade. 15 'I would ask you, in the remoter districts, observing the nine−squares division, to reserve one division to be cultivated on the system of mutual aid, and in the more central parts of the kingdom, to make the people pay for themselves a tenth part of their produce.

In the fields of a district, those who belong to the same nine squares render all friendly offices to one another in their going out and coming in, aid one another in keeping watch and ward, and sustain one another in sickness. Thus the people are brought to live in affection and harmony. 19 'A square lî covers nine squares of land, which nine squares contain nine hundred mâu. The central square is the public field, and eight families, each having its private hundred mâu, cultivate in common the public field.

Coming right to his gate, he addressed the duke Wan, saying, 'A man of a distant region, I have heard that you, Prince, are practising a benevolent government, and I wish to receive a site for a house, and to become one of your people.' The duke Wan gave him a dwelling−place. His disciples, amounting to several tens, all wore clothes of haircloth, and made sandals of hemp and wove mats for a living. 2 At the same time, Ch'an Hsiang, a disciple of Ch'an Liang, and his younger brother, Hsin, with their plough−handles and shares on their backs, came from Sung to T'ang, saying, 'We have heard that you, Prince, are putting into practice the government of the ancient sages, showing that you are likewise a sage. We wish to become the subjects of a sage.' 3 When Ch'an Hsiang saw Hsü Hsing, he was greatly pleased with him, and, abandoning entirely whatever he had learned, became his disciple. Having an interview with Mencius, he related to him with approbation the words of Hsü Hsing to the following effect:−− 'The prince of T'ang is indeed a worthy prince. He has not yet heard, however, the real doctrines of antiquity. Now, wise and able princes should cultivate the ground equally and along with their people, and eat the fruit of their labour. They should prepare their own meals, morning and evening, while at the same time they carry on their government. But now, the prince of T'ang has his granaries, treasuries, and arsenals, which is an oppressing of the people to nourish himself. How can he be deemed a real worthy prince?' 4 Mencius said,'I suppose that Hsü Hsing sows grain and eats the produce. Is it not so?' 'It is so,' was the answer. 'I suppose also he weaves cloth, and wears his own manufacture. Is it not so?' 'No. Hsü wears clothes of haircloth.' 'Does he wear a cap?' 'He wears a cap.' 'What kind of cap?' 'A plain cap.' 'Is it woven by himself?' 'No. He gets it in exchange for grain.' 'Why does Hsü not weave it himself?' 'That would injure his husbandry.' 'Does Hsü cook his food in boilers and earthenware pans, and does he plough with an iron share?' 'Yes.' 'Does he make those articles himself?' 'No. He gets them in exchange for grain.' 5 Mencius then said, 'The getting those various articles in exchange for grain, is not oppressive to the potter and the founder, and the potter and the founder in their turn, in exchanging their various articles for grain, are not oppressive to the husbandman. How should such a thing be supposed? And moreover, why does not Hsü act the potter and founder, supplying himself with the articles which he uses solely from his own 53"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"establishment? Why does he go confusedly dealing and exchanging with the handicraftsmen? Why does he not spare himself so much trouble?' Ch'an Hsiang replied, 'The business of the handicraftsman can by no means be carried on along with the business of husbandry.' 6 Mencius resumed, 'Then, is it the government of the kingdom which alone can be carried on along with the practice of husbandry? Great men have their proper business, and little men have their proper business. Moreover, in the case of any single individual, whatever articles he can require are ready to his hand, being produced by the various handicraftsmen:−− if he must first make them for his own use, this way of doing would keep all the people running about upon the roads. Hence, there is the saying, \"Some labour with their minds, and some labour with their strength. Those who labour with their minds govern others; those who labour with their strength are governed by others. Those who are governed by others support them; those who govern others are supported by them.\" This is a principle universally recognised. 7 'In the time of Yâo, when the world had not yet been perfectly reduced to order, the vast waters, flowing out of their channels, made a universal inundation. Vegetation was luxuriant, and birds and beasts swarmed. The various kinds of grain could not be grown. The birds and beasts pressed upon men. The paths marked by the feet of beasts and prints of birds crossed one another throughout the Middle Kingdom. To Yâo alone this caused anxious sorrow. He raised Shun to office, and measures to regulate the disorder were set forth. Shun committed to Yî the direction of the fire to be employed, and Yî set fire to, and consumed, the forests and vegetation on the mountains and in the marshes, so that the birds and beasts fled away to hide themselves. Yü separated the nine streams, cleared the courses of the Tsî and T'â, and led them all to the sea. He opened a vent also for the Zû and Han, and regulated the course of the Hwâ'i and Sze, so that they all flowed into the Chiang. When this was done, it became possible for the people of the Middle Kingdom to cultivate the ground and get food for themselves. During that time, Yü was eight years away from his home, and though he thrice passed the door of it, he did not enter. Although he had wished to cultivate the ground, could he have done so?' 8 'The Minister of Agriculture taught the people to sow and reap, cultivating the five kinds of grain. When the five kinds of grain were brought to maturity, the people all obtained a subsistence. But men possess a moral nature; and if they are well fed, warmly clad, and comfortably lodged, without being taught at the same time, they become almost like the beasts. This was a subject of anxious solicitude to the sage Shun, and he appointed Hsieh to be the Minister of Instruction, to teach the relations of humanity:−− how, between father and son, there should be affection; between sovereign and minister, righteousness; between husband and wife, attention to their separate functions; between old and young, a proper order; and between friends, fidelity. The high meritorious sovereign said to him, \"Encourage them; lead them on; rectify them; straighten them; help them; give them Chapter 10 54"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"wings:−− thus causing them to become possessors of themselves. Then follow this up by stimulating them, and conferring benefits on them.\" When the sages were exercising their solicitude for the people in this way, had they leisure to cultivate the ground? 9 'What Yâo felt giving him anxiety was the not getting Shun. What Shun felt giving him anxiety was the not getting Yü and Kâo Yâo. But he whose anxiety is about his hundred mâu not being properly cultivated, is a mere husbandman. 10 'The imparting by a man to others of his wealth, is called \"kindness.\" The teaching others what is good, is called \"the exercise of fidelity.\" The finding a man who shall benefit the kingdom, is called \"benevolence.\" Hence to give the throne to another man would be easy; to find a man who shall benefit the kingdom is difficult. 11 'Confucius said, \"Great indeed was Yâo as a sovereign. It is only Heaven that is great, and only Yâo corresponded to it. How vast was his virtue! The people could find no name for it. Princely indeed was Shun! How majestic was he, having possession of the kingdom, and yet seeming as if it were nothing to him!\" In their governing the kingdom, were there no subjects on which Yâo and Shun employed their minds? There were subjects, only they did not employ their minds on the cultivation of the ground. 12 'I have heard of men using the doctrines of our great land to change barbarians, but I have never yet heard of any being changed by barbarians. Ch'an Liang was a native of Ch'û. Pleased with the doctrines of Châu−kung and Chung−nE, he came northwards to the Middle Kingdom and studied them. Among the scholars of the northern regions, there was perhaps no one who excelled him. He was what you call a scholar of high and distinguished qualities. You and your brother followed him some tens of years, and when your master died, you forthwith turned away from him. 13 'Formerly, when Confucius died, after three years had elapsed, his disciples collected their baggage, and prepared to return to their several homes. But on entering to take their leave of Tsze−kung, as they looked towards one another, they wailed, till they all lost their voices. After this they returned to their homes, but Tsze−kung went back, and built a house for himself on the altar−ground, where he lived alone other three years, before he returned home. On another occasion, Tsze−hsiâ, Tsze−chang, and Tsze−yû, thinking that Yû Zo resembled the sage, wished to render to him the same observances which they had rendered to Confucius. They tried to force the disciple Tsang to join with them, but he said, \"This may not be done.

If a boy of five cubits were sent to the market, no one would impose on him; linen and silk of the same length would be of the same price. So it would be with bundles of hemp and silk, being of the same weight; with the different kinds of grain, being the same in quantity; and with shoes which were of the same size.' 18 Mencius replied, 'It is the nature of things to be of unequal quality. Some are twice, some five times, some ten times, some a hundred times, some a thousand times, some ten thousand times as valuable as others. If you reduce them all to the same standard, that must throw the kingdom into confusion. If large shoes and small shoes were of the same price, who would make them? For people to follow the doctrines of Hsü, would be for them to lead one another on to practise deceit. How can they avail for the government of a State?' 1 The Mohist, Î Chih, sought, through Hsü Pî, to see Mencius. Mencius said, 'I indeed wish to see him, but at present I am still unwell. When I am better, I will myself go and see him. He need not come here again.' 2 Next day, Î Chih again sought to see Mencius. Mencius said, 'To−day I am able to see him. But if I do not correct his errors, the true principles will not be fully evident. Let me first correct him. I have heard that this Î is a Mohist. Now Mo considers that in the regulation of funeral matters a spare simplicity should be the rule. Î thinks with Mo's doctrines to change the customs of the kingdom;−− how does he regard them as if they were wrong, and not honour them? Notwithstanding his views, Î buried his parents in a sumptuous manner, and Chapter 10 56"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"so he served them in the way which his doctrines discountenance.' 3 The disciple Hsü informed Î of these remarks. Î said, 'Even according to the principles of the learned, we find that the ancients acted towards the people \"as if they were watching over an infant.\" What does this expression mean? To me it sounds that we are to love all without difference of degree; but the manifestation of love must begin with our parents.' Hsü reported this reply to Mencius, who said, 'Now, does Î really think that a man's affection for the child of his brother is merely like his affection for the infant of a neighbour? What is to be approved in that expression is simply this:−− that if an infant crawling about is likely to fall into a well, it is no crime in the infant. Moreover, Heaven gives birth to creatures in such a way that they have one root, and Î makes them to have two roots. This is the cause of his error. 4 'And, in the most ancient times, there were some who did not inter their parents. When their parents died, they took them up and threw them into some water−channel. Afterwards, when passing by them, they saw foxes and wild−cats devouring them, and flies and gnats biting at them. The perspiration started out upon their foreheads, and they looked away, unable to bear the sight. It was not on account of other people that this perspiration flowed. The emotions of their hearts affected their faces and eyes, and instantly they went home, and came back with baskets and spades and covered the bodies. If the covering them thus was indeed right, you may see that the filial son and virtuous man, in interring in a handsome manner their parents, act according to a proper rule.' 5 The disciple Hsü informed Î of what Mencius had said.

Moreover, the History says, \"By bending only one cubit, you make eight cubits straight.\" It appears to me like a thing which might be done.' 2 Mencius said, 'Formerly, the duke Ching of Ch'î, once when he was hunting, called his forester to him by a flag. The forester would not come, and the duke was going to kill him. With reference to this incident, Confucius said, \"The determined officer never forgets that his end may be in a ditch or a stream; the brave officer never forgets that he may lose his head.\" What was it in the forester that Confucius thus approved? He approved his not going to the duke, when summoned by the article which was not appropriate to him. If one go to see the princes without waiting to be invited, what can be thought of him? 3 'Moreover, that sentence, \"By bending only one cubit, you make eight cubits straight,\" is spoken with reference to the gain that may be got. If gain be the object, then, if it can be got by bending eight cubits to make one cubit straight, may we likewise do that? 4 'Formerly, the officer Châo Chien made Wang Liang act as charioteer for his favourite Hsî, when, in the course of a whole day, they did not get a single bird. The favourite Hsî reported this result, saying, \"He is the poorest charioteer in the world.\" Some one told this to Wang Liang, who said, \"I beg leave to try again.\" By dint of pressing, this was accorded to him, when in one morning they got ten birds. The favourite, reporting this result, said, \"He is the best charioteer in the world.\" Chien said, \"I will make him always drive your chariot for you.\" When he told Wang Liang so, however, Liang refused, saying, \"I drove for him, strictly observing the proper rules for driving, and in the whole day he did not get one bird. I drove for him so as deceitfully to intercept the birds, and in one morning he got ten.

Do not disobey your husband.'\" Thus, to look upon compliance as their correct course is the rule for women. 3 'To dwell in the wide house of the world, to stand in the correct seat of the world, and to walk in the great path of the world; when he obtains his desire for office, to practise his principles for the good of the people; and when that desire is disappointed, to practise them alone; to be above the power of riches and honours to make dissipated, of poverty and mean condition to make swerve from principle, and of power and force to make bend:−− these characteristics constitute the great man.' 1 Châu Hsiâo asked Mencius, saying, 'Did superior men of old time take office?' Mencius replied, 'They did. The Record says, \"If Confucius was three months without being employed by some ruler, he looked anxious and unhappy. When he passed from the boundary of a State, he was sure to carry with him his proper gift of introduction.\" Kung−ming Î said, \"Among the ancients, if an officer was three months unemployed by a ruler, he was condoled with.\"' 2 Hsiâo said, 'Did not this condoling, on being three months unemployed by a ruler, show a too great urgency?' 3 Mencius answered, 'The loss of his place to an officer is like the loss of his State to a prince. It is said in the Book of Rites, \"A prince ploughs himself, and is assisted by the people, to supply the millet for sacrifice. His wife keeps silkworms, and unwinds their cocoons, to make the garments for sacrifice.\" If the victims be not perfect, the millet not pure, and the dress not complete, he does not presume to sacrifice. \"And the scholar who, out of office, has no holy field, in the same way, does not sacrifice. The victims for slaughter, the vessels, and the garments, not being all complete, he does not presume to sacrifice, and then neither may he dare to feel happy.\" Is there not here sufficient ground also for condolence?' Chapter 11 59"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"4 Hsiâo again asked, 'What was the meaning of Confucius's always carrying his proper gift of introduction with him, when he passed over the boundaries of the State where he had been?' 5 'An officer's being in office,' was the reply, 'is like the ploughing of a husbandman. Does a husbandman part with his plough, because he goes from one State to another?' 6 Hsiâo pursued, 'The kingdom of Tsin is one, as well as others, of official employments, but I have not heard of anyone being thus earnest about being in office. If there should be this urge why does a superior man make any difficulty about taking it?' Mencius answered, 'When a son is born, what is desired for him is that he may have a wife; when a daughter is born, what is desired for her is that she may have a husband. This feeling of the parents is possessed by all men. If the young people, without waiting for the orders of their parents, and the arrangements of the go−betweens, shall bore holes to steal a sight of each other, or get over the wall to be with each other, then their parents and all other people will despise them. The ancients did indeed always desire to be in office, but they also hated being so by any improper way. To seek office by an improper way is of a class with young people's boring holes.' 1 P'ang Kang asked Mencius, saying, 'Is it not an extravagant procedure to go from one prince to another and live upon them, followed by several tens of carriages, and attended by several hundred men?' Mencius replied, 'If there be not a proper ground for taking it, a single bamboo−cup of rice may not be received from a man. If there be such a proper ground, then Shun's receiving the kingdom from Yâo is not to be considered excessive. Do you think it was excessive?' 2 Kang said, 'No. But for a scholar performing no service to receive his support notwithstanding is improper.' 3 Mencius answered, 'If you do not have an intercommunication of the productions of labour, and an interchange of men's services, so that one from his overplus may supply the deficiency of another, then husbandmen will have a superfluity of grain, and women will have a superfluity of cloth. If you have such an interchange, carpenters and carriage−wrights may all get their food from you. Here now is a man, who, at home, is filial, and abroad, respectful to his elders; who watches over the principles of the ancient kings, awaiting the rise of future learners:−− and yet you will refuse to support him. How is it that you give honour to the carpenter and carriage−wright, and slight him who practises Chapter 11 60"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"benevolence and righteousness?' 4 P'ang Kang said, 'The aim of the carpenter and carriagewright is by their trades to seek for a living. Is it also the aim of the superior man in his practice of principles thereby to seek for a living?' 'What have you to do,' returned Mencius, 'with his purpose? He is of service to you. He deserves to be supported, and should be supported. And let me ask,−− Do you remunerate a man's intention, or do you remunerate his service.' To this Kang replied, 'I remunerate his intention.' 5 Mencius said, 'There is a man here, who breaks your tiles, and draws unsightly figures on your walls;−− his purpose may be thereby to seek for his living, but will you indeed remunerate him?' 'No,' said Kang; and Mencius then concluded, 'That being the case, it is not the purpose which you remunerate, but the work done.' 1 Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'Sung is a small State. Its ruler is now setting about to practise the true royal government, and Ch'î and Ch'û hate and attack him. What in this case is to be done?' 2 Mencius replied, 'When T'ang dwelt in Po, he adjoined to the State of Ko, the chief of which was living in a dissolute state and neglecting his proper sacrifices. T'ang sent messengers to inquire why he did not sacrifice. He replied, \"I have no means of supplying the necessary victims.\" On this, T'ang caused oxen and sheep to be sent to him, but he ate them, and still continued not to sacrifice. T'ang again sent messengers to ask him the same question as before, when he replied, \"I have no means of obtaining the necessary millet.\" On this, T'ang sent the mass of the people of Po to go and till the ground for him, while the old and feeble carried their food to them. The chief of Ko led his people to intercept those who were thus charged with wine, cooked rice, millet, and paddy, and took their stores from them, while they killed those who refused to give them up. There was a boy who had some millet and flesh for the labourers, who was thus slain and robbed. What is said in the Book of History, \"The chief of Ko behaved as an enemy to the provision−carriers,\" has reference to this. 3 'Because of his murder of this boy, T'ang proceeded to punish him. All within the four seas said, \"It is not because he desires the riches of the kingdom, but to avenge a common man and woman.\" 4 'When T'ang began his work of executing justice, he commenced with Ko, and though he Chapter 11 61"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"made eleven punitive expeditions, he had not an enemy in the kingdom. When he pursued his work in the east, the rude tribes in the west murmured. So did those on the north, when he was engaged in the south. Their cry was−− \"Why does he make us last.\" Thus, the people's longing for him was like their longing for rain in a time of great drought. The frequenters of the markets stopped not. Those engaged in weeding in the fields made no change in their operations. While he punished their rulers, he consoled the people. His progress was like the falling of opportune rain, and the people were delighted. It is said in the Book of History, \"We have waited for our prince. When our prince comes, we may escape from the punishments under which we suffer.\" 5 'There being some who would not become the subjects of Châu, king Wû proceeded to punish them on the east. He gave tranquillity to their people, who welcomed him with baskets full of their black and yellow silks, saying−− \"From henceforth we shall serve the sovereign of our dynasty of Châu, that we may be made happy by him.\" So they joined themselves, as subjects, to the great city of Châu. Thus, the men of station of Shang took baskets full of black and yellow silks to meet the men of station of Châu, and the lower classes of the one met those of the other with baskets of rice and vessels of congee. Wû saved the people from the midst of fire and water, seizing only their oppressors, and destroying them.' 6 'In the Great Declaration it is said, \"My power shall be put forth, and, invading the territories of Shang, I will seize the oppressor. I will put him to death to punish him:−− so shall the greatness of my work appear, more glorious than that of T'ang.\" 7 'Sung is not, as you say, practising true royal government, and so forth. If it were practising royal government, all within the four seas would be lifting up their heads, and looking for its prince, wishing to have him for their sovereign. Great as Ch'î and Ch'û are, what would there be to fear from them?' −− Chapter 11 −− Chapter 11 62"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Chapter 12 1 Mencius said to Tâi Pû−shang, 'I see that you are desiring your king to be virtuous, and will plainly tell you how he may be made so. Suppose that there is a great officer of Ch'û here, who wishes his son to learn the speech of Ch'î. Will he in that case employ a man of Ch'î as his tutor, or a man of Ch'û?' 'He will employ a man of Ch'î to teach him,' said Pû−shang. Mencius went on, 'If but one man of Ch'î be teaching him, and there be a multitude of men of Ch'û continually shouting out about him, although his father beat him every day, wishing him to learn the speech of Ch'î, it will be impossible for him to do so. But in the same way, if he were to be taken and placed for several years in Chwang or Yo, though his father should beat him, wishing him to speak the language of Ch'û, it would be impossible for him to do so. 2 'You supposed that Hsieh Chü−châu was a scholar of virtue, and you have got him placed in attendance on the king. Suppose that all in attendance on the king, old and young, high and low, were Hsieh Chü−châus, whom would the king have to do evil with? And suppose that all in attendance on the king, old and young, high and low, are not Hsieh Chü−châus, whom will the king gave to do good with?

Mencius replied, 'Among the ancients, if one had not seen a minister in a State, he did not go to see the sovereign. 2 'Twan Kan−mû leaped over his wall to avoid the prince. Hsieh Liû shut his door, and would not admit the prince. These two, however, carried their scrupulosity to excess. When a prince is urgent, it is not improper to see him. 3 'Yang Ho wished to get Confucius to go to see him, but disliked doing so by any want of propriety. As it is the rule, therefore, that when a great officer sends a gift to a scholar, if the latter be not at home to receive it, he must go to the officer's to pay his respects, Yang Ho watched when Confucius was out, and sent him a roasted pig. Confucius, in his turn, watched when Ho was out, and went to pay his respects to him. At that time, Yang Ho had taken the initiative;−− how could Confucius decline going to see him? 63"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"4 'Tsang−tsze said, \"They who shrug up their shoulders, and laugh in a flattering way, toil harder than the summer labourer in the fields.\" Tsze−lû said, \"There are those who talk with people with whom they have no great community of feeling.

I do not desire to know such persons.\" By considering these remarks, the spirit which the superior man nourishes may be known.' 1 Tâi Ying−chih said to Mencius, 'I am not able at present and immediately to do with the levying of a tithe only, and abolishing the duties charged at the passes and in the markets. With your leave I will lighten, however, both the tax and the duties, until next year, and will then make an end of them. What do you think of such a course?' 2 Mencius said, 'Here is a man, who every day appropriates some of his neighbour's strayed fowls. Some one says to him, \"Such is not the way of a good man;\" and he replies, \"With your leave I will diminish my appropriations, and will take only one fowl a month, until next year, when I will make an end of the practice.\" 3 'If you know that the thing is unrighteous, then use all despatch in putting an end to it:−− why wait till next year?' 1 The disciple Kung−tû said to Mencius, 'Master, the people beyond our school all speak of you as being fond of disputing. I venture to ask whether it be so.' Mencius replied, 'Indeed, I am not fond of disputing, but I am compelled to do it. 2 'A long time has elapsed since this world of men received its being, and there has been along its history now a period of good order, and now a period of confusion. 3 'In the time of Yâo, the waters, flowing out of their channels, inundated the Middle Kingdom. Snakes and dragons occupied it, and the people had no place where they could settle themselves. In the low grounds they made nests for themselves on the trees or raised platforms, and in the high grounds they made caves. It is said in the Book of History, \"The waters in their wild course warned me.\" Those \"waters in their wild course\" were the waters of the great inundation. Chapter 12 64"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"4 'Shun employed Yü to reduce the waters to order. Yü dug open their obstructed channels, and conducted them to the sea. He drove away the snakes and dragons, and forced them into the grassy marshes. On this, the waters pursued their course through the country, even the waters of the Chiang, the Hwâi, the Ho, and the Han, and the dangers and obstructions which they had occasioned were removed. The birds and beasts which had injured the people also disappeared, and after this men found the plains available for them, and occupied them. 5 'After the death of Yâo and Shun, the principles that mark sages fell into decay. Oppressive sovereigns arose one after another, who pulled down houses to make ponds and lakes, so that the people knew not where they could rest in quiet; they threw fields out of cultivation to form gardens and parks, so that the people could not get clothes and food. Afterwards, corrupt speakings and oppressive deeds became more rife; gardens and parks, ponds and lakes, thickets and marshes became more numerous, and birds and beasts swarmed. By the time of the tyrant Châu, the kingdom was again in a state of great confusion. 6 'Châu−kung assisted king Wû, and destroyed Châu. He smote Yen, and after three years put its sovereign to death. He drove Fei−lien to a corner by the sea, and slew him. The States which he extinguished amounted to fifty. He drove far away also the tigers, leopards, rhinoceroses, and elephants;−− and all the people was greatly delighted. It is said in the Book of History, \"Great and splendid were the plans of king Wan! Greatly were they carried out by the energy of king Wû! They are for the assistance and instruction of us who are of an after day. They are all in principle correct, and deficient in nothing.\" 7 'Again the world fell into decay, and principles faded away. Perverse speakings and oppressive deeds waxed rife again. There were instances of ministers who murdered their sovereigns, and of sons who murdered their fathers. 8 'Confucius was afraid, and made the \"Spring and Autumn.\" What the \"Spring and Autumn\" contains are matters proper to the sovereign. On this account Confucius said, \"Yes! It is the Spring and Autumn which will make men know me, and it is the Spring and Autumn which will make men condemn me.\" 9 'Once more, sage sovereigns cease to arise, and the princes of the States give the reins to their lusts. Unemployed scholars indulge in unreasonable discussions. The words of Yang Chû and Mo Tî fill the country. If you listen to people's discourses throughout it, you will find that they have adopted the views either of Yang or of Mo. Now, Yang's principle is−− \"each Chapter 12 65"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"one for himself,\" which does not acknowledge the claims of the sovereign. Mo's principle is−− \"to love all equally,\" which does not acknowledge the peculiar affection due to a father. But to acknowledge neither king nor father is to be in the state of a beast. Kung−ming Î said, \"In their kitchens, there is fat meat. In their stables, there are fat horses. But their people have the look of hunger, and on the wilds there are those who have died of famine. This is leading on beasts to devour men.\" If the principles of Yang and Mo be not stopped, and the principles of Confucius not set forth, then those perverse speakings will delude the people, and stop up the path of benevolence and righteousness. When benevolence and righteousness are stopped up, beasts will be led on to devour men, and men will devour one another. 10 'I am alarmed by these things, and address myself to the defence of the doctrines of the former sages, and to oppose Yang and Mo. I drive away their licentious expressions, so that such perverse speakers may not be able to show themselves. Their delusions spring up in men's minds, and do injury to their practice of affairs. Shown in their practice of affairs, they are pernicious to their government. When sages shall rise up again, they will not change my words. 11 'In former times, Yü repressed the vast waters of the inundation, and the country was reduced to order. Châu−kung's achievements extended even to the barbarous tribes of the east and north, and he drove away all ferocious animals, and the people enjoyed repose. Confucius completed the \"Spring and Autumn,\" and rebellious ministers and villainous sons were struck with terror. 12 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"He smote the barbarians of the west and the north; He punished Ching and Shû And no one dared to resist us.\" These father−deniers and king−deniers would have been smitten by Châu−kung. 13 'I also wish to rectify men's hearts, and to put an end to those perverse doctrines, to oppose their one−sided actions and banish away their licentious expressions;−− and thus to carry on the work of the three sages. Do I do so because I am fond of disputing? I am compelled to do it. 14 'Whoever is able to oppose Yang and Mo is a disciple of the sages.' 1 K'wang Chang said to Mencius, 'Is not Ch'an Chung a man of true self−denying purity? He Chapter 12 66"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"was living in Wû−ling, and for three days was without food, till he could neither hear nor see. Over a well there grew a plum−tree, the fruit of which had been more than half eaten by worms. He crawled to it, and tried to eat some of the fruit, when, after swallowing three mouthfuls, he recovered his sight and hearing.' 2 Mencius replied, 'Among the scholars of Ch'î, I must regard Chung as the thumb among the fingers. But still, where is the self−denying purity he pretends to? To carry out the principles which he holds, one must become an earthworm, for so only can it be done. 3 'Now, an earthworm eats the dry mould above, and drinks the yellow spring below. Was the house in which Chung dwells built by a Po−î? or was it built by a robber like Chih? Was the millet which he eats planted by a Po−î? or was it planted by a robber like Chih? These are things which cannot be known.' 4 'But,' said Chang, 'what does that matter? He himself weaves sandals of hemp, and his wife twists and dresses threads of hemp to sell or exchange them.' 5 Mencius rejoined, 'Chung belongs to an ancient and noble family of Ch'î. His elder brother Tâi received from Kâ a revenue of 10,000 chung, but he considered his brother's emolument to be unrighteous, and would not eat of it, and in the same way he considered his brother's house to be unrighteous, and would not dwell in it. Avoiding his brother and leaving his mother, he went and dwelt in Wû−ling. One day afterwards, he returned to their house, when it happened that some one sent his brother a present of a live goose. He, knitting his eyebrows, said, \"What are you going to use that cackling thing for?\" By−and−by his mother killed the goose, and gave him some of it to eat. Just then his brother came into the house, and said, \"It is the flesh of that cackling thing,\" upon which he went out and vomited it. 6 'Thus, what his mother gave him he would not eat, but what his wife gives him he eats. He will not dwell in his brother's house, but he dwells in Wû−ling. How can he in such circumstances complete the style of life which he professes?

That male and female should dwell together, is the greatest of human relations. If Shun had informed his parents, he must have made void this greatest of human relations, thereby incurring their resentment. On this account, he did not inform them! 2 Wan Chang said, 'As to Shun's marrying without informing his parents, I have heard your instructions; but how was it that the Tî Yâo gave him his daughters as wives without informing Shun's parents?' Mencius said, 'The Tî also knew that if he informed them, he could not marry his daughters to him.' 3 Wan Chang said, 'His parents set Shun to repair a granary, to which, the ladder having been removed, Kû−sâu set fire. They also made him dig a well. He got out, but they, not knowing that, proceeded to cover him up. Hsiang said, \"Of the scheme to cover up the city−forming prince, the merit is all mine. Let my parents have his oxen and sheep. Let them have his storehouses and granaries. His shield and spear shall be mine. His lute shall be mine. His bow shall be mine. His two wives I shall make attend for me to my bed.\" Hsiang then went away into Shun's palace, and there was Shun on his couch playing on his lute. Hsiang said, \"I am come simply because I was thinking anxiously about you.\" At the same time, he blushed deeply. Shun said to him, \"There are all my officers:−− do you undertake the government of them for me.\" I do not know whether Shun was ignorant of Hsiang's wishing to kill him.' Mencius answered, 'How could he be ignorant of that? But when Hsiang was sorrowful, he was also sorrowful; when Hsiang was joyful, he was also joyful.' 4 Chang said, 'In that case, then, did not Shun rejoice hypocritically?' Mencius replied, 'No. Formerly, some one sent a present of a live fish to Tsze−ch'an of Chang. Tsze−ch'an ordered his pond−keeper to keep it in the pond, but that officer cooked it, and reported the execution of his commission, saying, \"When I first let it go, it embarrassed. In a little while, it seemed to be somewhat at ease, then it swam away joyfully.\" Tsze−ch'an observed, \"It had got into its element! It had got into its element!\" The pond−keeper then went out and said, \"Who calls Tsze−ch'an a wise man? After I had cooked and eaten the fish, he says, \"It had got into its element! It had got into its element!\" Thus a superior man may be imposed on by what seems to be as it ought to be, but he cannot be entrapped by what is contrary to right Chapter 17 91"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"principle. Hsiang came in the way in which the love of his elder brother would have made him come; therefore Shun sincerely believed him, and rejoiced. What hypocrisy was there?' 1 Wan Chang said, 'Hsiang made it his daily business to slay Shun. When Shun was made sovereign, how was it that he only banished him?' Mencius said, 'He raised him to be a prince. Some supposed that it was banishing him?' 2 Wan Chang said, 'Shun banished the superintendent of works to Yû−châu; he sent away Hwan−tâu to the mountain Ch'ung; he slew the prince of San−miâo in San−wei; and he imprisoned Kwân on the mountain Yü. When the crimes of those four were thus punished, the whole kingdom acquiesced:−− it was a cutting off of men who were destitute of benevolence. But Hsiang was of all men the most destitute of benevolence, and Shun raised him to be the prince of Yû−pî;−− of what crimes had the people of Yû−pî been guilty? Does a benevolent man really act thus? In the case of other men, he cut them off; in the case of his brother, he raised him to be a prince.' Mencius replied, 'A benevolent man does not lay up anger, nor cherish resentment against his brother, but only regards him with affection and love. Regarding him with affection, he wishes him to be honourable: regarding him with love, he wishes him to be rich. The appointment of Hsiang to be the prince of Yû−pî was to enrich and ennoble him. If while Shun himself was sovereign, his brother had been a common man, could he have been said to regard him with affection and love?' 3 Wan Chang said, 'I venture to ask what you mean by saying that some supposed that it was a banishing of Hsiang?' Mencius replied, 'Hsiang could do nothing in his State. The Son of Heaven appointed an officer to administer its government, and to pay over its revenues to him. This treatment of him led to its being said that he was banished. How indeed could he be allowed the means of oppressing the people? Nevertheless, Shun wished to be continually seeing him, and by this arrangement, he came incessantly to court, as is signified in that expression−− \"He did not wait for the rendering of tribute, or affairs of government, to receive the prince of Yû−pî. 1 Hsien−ch'iû Mang asked Mencius, saying, 'There is the saying, \"A scholar of complete virtue may not be employed as a minister by his sovereign, nor treated as a son by his father. Shun stood with his face to the south, and Yâo, at the head of all the princes, appeared before him at court with his face to the north. Kû−sâu also did the same. When Shun saw Kû−sâu, his countenance became discomposed. Confucius said, At this time, in what a perilous condition was the kingdom! Its state was indeed unsettled.\"−− I do not know whether what is here said really took place.' Mencius replied, 'No. These are not the words of a superior man. They are the sayings of an uncultivated person of the east of Ch'î. When Yâo was old, Shun was associated with him in the government. It is said in the Canon of Yâo, \"After twenty and eight years, the Highly Meritorious one deceased. The people acted Chapter 17 92"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"as if they were mourning for a father or mother for three years, and up to the borders of the four seas every sound of music was hushed.\" Confucius said, \"There are not two suns in the sky, nor two sovereigns over the people.\" Shun having been sovereign, and, moreover, leading on all the princes to observe the three years' mourning for Yâo, there would have been in this case two sovereigns.' 2 Hsien−ch'iû Mang said, 'On the point of Shun's not treating Yâo as a minister, I have received your instructions. But it is said in the Book of Poetry, Under the whole heaven, Every spot is the sovereign's ground; To the borders of the land, Every individual is the sovereign's minister;\" −− and Shun had become sovereign. I venture to ask how it was that Kû−sâu was not one of his ministers.' Mencius answered, 'That ode is not to be understood in that way:−− it speaks of being laboriously engaged in the sovereign's business, so as not to be able to nourish one's parents, as if the author said, \"This is all the sovereign's business, and how is it that I alone am supposed to have ability, and am made to toil in it?\" Therefore, those who explain the odes, may not insist on one term so as to do violence to a sentence, nor on a sentence so as to do violence to the general scope. They must try with their thoughts to meet that scope, and then we shall apprehend it. If we simply take single sentences, there is that in the ode called \"The Milky Way,\"−− Of the black−haired people of the remnant of Châu, There is not half a one left.\" If it had been really as thus expressed, then not an individual of the people of Châu was left. 3 'Of all which a filial son can attain to, there is nothing greater than his honouring his parents. And of what can be attained to in the honouring one's parents, there is nothing greater than the nourishing them with the whole kingdom. Kû−sâu was the father of the sovereign;−− this was the height of honour. Shun nourished him with the whole kingdom;−− this was the height of nourishing. In this was verified the sentiment in the Book of Poetry, \"Ever cherishing filial thoughts, Those filial thoughts became an example to after ages.\" 4 'It is said in the Book of History, \"Reverently performing his duties, he waited on Kû−sâu, and was full of veneration and awe. Kû−sâu also believed him and conformed to virtue.\"−− This is the true case of the scholar of complete virtue not being treated as a son by his father.' −− Chapter 17 −− Chapter 17 93"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Chapter 18 1 Wan Chang said, 'Was it the case that Yâo gave the throne to Shun?' Mencius said, 'No. The sovereign cannot give the throne to another.' 2 'Yes;−− but Shun had the throne. Who gave it to him?' 'Heaven gave it to him,' was the answer. 3 '\" Heaven gave it to him:\"−− did Heaven confer its appointment on him with specific injunctions?' 4 Mencius replied, 'No. Heaven does not speak. It simply showed its will by his personal conduct and his conduct of affairs.' 5 '\"It showed its will by his personal conduct and his conduct of affairs:\"−− how was this?' Mencius's answer was, 'The sovereign can present a man to Heaven, but he cannot make Heaven give that man the throne. A prince can present a man to the sovereign, but he cannot cause the sovereign to make that man a prince. A great officer can present a man to his prince, but he cannot cause the prince to make that man a great officer. Yâo presented Shun to Heaven, and Heaven accepted him. He presented him to the people, and the people accepted him. Therefore I say, \"Heaven does not speak. It simply indicated its will by his personal conduct and his conduct of affairs.\"' 6 Chang said, 'I presume to ask how it was that Yâo presented Shun to Heaven, and Heaven accepted him; and that he exhibited him to the people, and the people accepted him.' Mencius replied, 'He caused him to preside over the sacrifices, and all the spirits were well pleased with them;−− thus Heaven accepted him. He caused him to preside over the conduct of affairs, and affairs were well administered, so that the people reposed under him;−− thus the people accepted him. Heaven gave the throne to him. The people gave it to him. Therefore I said, \"The sovereign cannot give the throne to another.\" 7 'Shun assisted Yâo in the government for twenty and eight years;−− this was more than man could have done, and was from Heaven. After the death of Yâo, when the three years' 94"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"mourning was completed, Shun withdrew from the son of Yâo to the south of South river. The princes of the kingdom, however, repairing to court, went not to the son of Yâo, but they went to Shun. Litigants went not to the son of Yâo, but they went to Shun. Singers sang not the son of Yâo, but they sang Shun. Therefore I said, \"Heaven gave him the throne.\" It was after these things that he went to the Middle Kingdom, and occupied the seat of the Son of Heaven. If he had, before these things, taken up his residence in the palace of Yâo, and had applied pressure to the son of Yâo, it would have been an act of usurpation, and not the gift of Heaven. 8 'This sentiment is expressed in the words of The Great Declaration,−− \"Heaven sees according as my people see; Heaven hears according as my people hear.\"' 1 Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'People say, \"When the disposal of the kingdom came to Yü, his virtue was inferior to that of Yâo and Shun, and he transmitted it not to the worthiest but to his son.\" Was it so?' Mencius replied, 'No; it was not so. When Heaven gave the kingdom to the worthiest, it was given to the worthiest. When Heaven gave it to the son of the preceding sovereign, it was given to him. Shun presented Yü to Heaven. Seventeen years elapsed, and Shun died. When the three years' mourning was expired, Yü withdrew from the son of Shun to Yang−ch'ang. The people of the kingdom followed him just as after the death of Yâo, instead of following his son, they had followed Shun. Yü presented Yî to Heaven. Seven years elapsed, and Yü died. When the three years' mourning was expired, Yî withdrew from the son of Yü to the north of mount Ch'î. The princes, repairing to court, went not to Yî, but they went to Ch'î. Litigants did not go to Yî, but they went to Ch'î, saying, \"He is the son of our sovereign;\" the singers did not sing Yî, but they sang Ch'î, saying, \"He is the son of our sovereign.\" 2 'That Tan−chû was not equal to his father, and Shun's son not equal to his; that Shun assisted Yâo, and Yü assisted Shun, for many years, conferring benefits on the people for a long time; that thus the length of time during which Shun, Yü, and Yî assisted in the government was so different; that Ch'î was able, as a man of talents and virtue, reverently to pursue the same course as Yü; that Yî assisted Yü only for a few years, and had not long conferred benefits on the people; that the periods of service of the three were so different; and that the sons were one superior, and the other superior:−− all this was from Heaven, and what could not be brought about by man. That which is done without man's doing is from Heaven. That which happens without man's causing is from the ordinance of Heaven. 3 'In the case of a private individual obtaining the throne, there must be in him virtue equal to that of Shun or Yü; and moreover there must be the presenting of him to Heaven by the preceding sovereign. It was on this account that Confucius did not obtain the throne.

It was on this account that Yî, Î Yin, and Châu−kung did not obtain the throne. 5 'Î Yin assisted T'ang so that he became sovereign over the kingdom. After the demise of T'ang, T'âi−ting having died before he could be appointed sovereign, Wâ'i−ping reigned two years, and Chung−zin four. T'âi−chiâ was then turning upside down the statutes of T'ang, when Î Yin placed him in T'ung for three years. There T'âi−chiâ repented of his errors, was contrite, and reformed himself. In T'ung be came to dwell in benevolence and walk in righteousness, during those threee years, listening to the lessons given to him by Î Yin. Then Î Yin again returned with him to Po. 6 'Châu−kung not getting the throne was like the case of Yî and the throne of Hsiâ, or like that of Î Yin and the throne of Yin. 7 'Confucius said, \"T'ang and Yü resigned the throne to their worthy ministers. The sovereign of Hsiâ and those of Yin and Châu transmitted it to their sons. The principle of righteousness was the same in all the cases.\"' 1 Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'People say that Î Yin sought an introduction to T'ang by his knowledge of cookery.

In any matter contrary to the righteousness which they prescribed, or contrary to their principles, he would neither have given nor taken a single straw. 3 'T'ang sent persons with presents of silk to entreat him to enter his service. With an air of indifference and self−satisfaction he said, \"What can I do with those silks with which T'ang invites me?

He took upon himself the heavy charge of the kingdom in this way, and therefore he went to T'ang, and pressed upon him the subject of attacking Hsiâ and saving the people. 7 'I have not heard of one who bent himself, and at the same time made others straight;−− how much less could one disgrace himself, and thereby rectify the whole kingdom?

In regard to his obtaining office or not obtaining it, he said, \"That is as ordered.\" But if he had lodged with the attendant Chî Hwan, that would neither have been according to righteousness, nor any ordering of Heaven. 3 'When Confucius, being dissatisfied in Lû and Wei, had left those States, he met with the attempt of Hwan, the Master of the Horse, of Sung, to intercept and kill him. He assumed, however, the dress of a common man, and passed by Sung. At that time, though he was in circumstances of distress, he lodged with the city−master Ch'ang, who was then a minister of Châu, the marquis of Ch'an. 4 'I have heard that the characters of ministers about court may be discerned from those whom they entertain, and those of stranger officers, from those with whom they lodge. If Confucius had lodged with the ulcer−doctor, and with the attendant Chî Hwan, how could he have been Confucius?' 1 Wan Chang asked Mencius, 'Some say that Pâi−lî Hsî sold himself to a cattle−keeper of Ch'in for the skins of five rams, and fed his oxen, in order to find an introduction to the duke Mû of Ch'in;−− was this the case?'

There might only be coarse rice and soup of vegetables, but he always ate his fill, not daring to do otherwise. Here, however, he stopped, and went no farther. He did not call him to share any of Heaven's places, or to govern any of Heaven's offices, or to partake of any of Heaven's emoluments.

How can the gift of a robber be received?' 5 Chang said, 'The princes of the present day take from their people just as a robber despoils his victim. Yet if they put a good face of propriety on their gifts, then the superior man receives them. I venture to ask how you explain this.' Mencius answered, 'Do you think that, if there should arise a truly royal sovereign, he would collect the princes of the present day, and put them all to death? Or would he admonish them, and then, on their not changing their ways, put them to death? Indeed, to call every one who takes what does not properly belong to him a robber, is pushing a point of resemblance to the utmost, and insisting on the most refined idea of righteousness. When Confucius was in office in Lû, the people struggled together for the game taken in hunting, and he also did the same. If that struggling for the captured game was proper, how much more may the gifts of the princes be received!' 6 Chang urged, 'Then are we to suppose that when Confucius held office, it was not with the view to carry his doctrines into practice?' 'It was with that view,' Mencius replied, and Chang rejoined, 'If the practice of his doctrines was his business, what had he to do with that struggling for the captured game?' Mencius said, 'Confucius first rectified his vessels of sacrifice according to the registers, and did not fill them so rectified with food gathered from Chapter 19 104"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"every quarter.' 'But why did he not go away?' He wished to make a trial of carrying his doctrines into practice. When that trial was sufficient to show that they could be practised and they were still not practised, then he went away, and thus it was that he never completed in any State a residence of three years. 7 'Confucius took office when he saw that the practice of his doctrines was likely; he took office when his reception was proper; he took office when he was supported by the State. In the case of his relation to Chî Hwan, he took office, seeing that the practice of his doctrines was likely. With the duke Ling of Wei he took office, because his reception was proper. With the duke Hsiâo of Wei he took office, because he was maintained by the State.' −− Chapter 19 −− Chapter 19 105"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Chapter 20 1 Mencius said, 'Office is not sought on account of poverty, yet there are times when one seeks office on that account. Marriage is not entered into for the sake of being attended to by the wife, yet there are times when one marries on that account. 2 'He who takes office on account of his poverty must decline an honourable situation and occupy a low one; he must decline riches and prefer to be poor. 3 'What office will be in harmony with this declining an honourable situation and occupying a low one, this declining riches and preferring to be poor? Such an one as that of guarding the gates, or beating the watchman's stick. 4 'Confucius was once keeper of stores, and he then said, \"My calculations must be all right. That is all I have to care about.\" He was once in charge of the public fields, and he then said, \"The oxen and sheep must be fat and strong, and superior. That is all I have to care about.\" 5 'When one is in a low situation, to speak of high matters is a crime. When a scholar stands in a prince's court, and his principles are not carried into practice, it is a shame to him.' 1 Wan Chang said, 'What is the reason that a scholar does not accept a stated support from a prince?' Mencius replied, 'He does not presume to do so. When a prince loses his State, and then accepts a stated support from another prince, this is in accordance with propriety. But for a scholar to accept such support from any of the princes is not in accordance with propriety.' 2 Wan Chang said, 'If the prince send him a present of grain, for instance, does he accept it?' 'He accepts it,' answered Mencius. 'On what principle of righteousness does he accept it?' 'Why−− the prince ought to assist the people in their necessities.' 106"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"3 Chang pursued, 'Why is it that the scholar will thus accept the prince's help, but will not accept his pay?' The answer was, 'He does not presume to do so.' 'I venture to ask why he does not presume to do so.' 'Even the keepers of the gates, with their watchmen's sticks, have their regular offices for which they can take their support from the prince. He who without a regular office should receive the pay of the prince must be deemed disrespectful.' 4 Chang asked, 'If the prince sends a scholar a present, he accepts it;−− I do not know whether this present may be constantly repeated.' Mencius answered, 'There was the conduct of the duke Mû to Tsze−sze−− He made frequent inquiries after Tsze−sze's health, and sent him frequent presents of cooked meat. Tsze−sze was displeased; and at length, having motioned to the messenger to go outside the great door, he bowed his head to the ground with his face to the north, did obeisance twice, and declined the gift, saying, \"From this time forth I shall know that the prince supports me as a dog or a horse.\" And so from that time a servant was no more sent with the presents. When a prince professes to be pleased with a man of talents and virtue, and can neither promote him to office, nor support him in the proper way, can he be said to be pleased with him? 5 Chang said, 'I venture to ask how the sovereign of a State, when he wishes to support a superior man, must proceed, that he may be said to do so in the proper way?' Mencius answered, 'At first, the present must be offered with the prince's commission, and the scholar, making obeisance twice with his head bowed to the ground, will receive it. But after this the storekeeper will continue to send grain, and the master of the kitchen to send meat, presenting it as if without the prince's express commission. Tsze−sze considered that the meat from the prince's caldron, giving him the annoyance of constantly doing obeisance, was not the way to support a superior man. 6 'There was Yâo's conduct to Shun:−− He caused his nine sons to serve him, and gave him his two daughters in marriage; he caused the various officers, oxen and sheep, storehouses and granaries, all to be prepared to support Shun amid the channelled fields, and then he raised him to the most exalted situation. From this we have the expression−− \"The honouring of virtue and talents proper to a king or a duke.\"' 1 Wan Chang said, 'I venture to ask what principle of righteousness is involved in a scholar's not going to see the princes?' Mencius replied, 'A scholar residing in the city is called \"a minister of the market−place and well,\" and one residing in the country is called \"a minister of the grass and plants.\" In both cases he is a common man, and it is the rule of propriety that common men, who have not presented the introductory present and become ministers, should not presume to have interviews with the prince.'

Mencius replied, 'It is right to go and perform the service; it would not be right to go and see the prince.' 3 'And,' added Mencius, 'on what account is it that the prince wishes to see the scholar?' 'Because of his extensive information, or because of his talents and virtue,' was the reply. 'If because of his extensive information,' said Mencius, 'such a person is a teacher, and the sovereign would not call him;−− how much less may any of the princes do so? If because of his talents and virtue, then I have not heard of any one wishing to see a person with those qualities, and calling him to his presence. 4 'During the frequent interviews of the duke Mû with Tsze−sze, he one day said to him, \"Anciently, princes of a thousand chariots have yet been on terms of friendship with scholars;−− what do you think of such an intercourse?\" Tsze−sze was displeased, and said, \"The ancients have said, 'The scholar should be served:' how should they have merely said that he should be made a friend of?\" When Tsze−sze was thus displeased, did he not say within himself,−− \"With regard to our stations, you are sovereign, and I am subject. How can I presume to be on terms of friendship with my sovereign! With regard to our virtue, you ought to make me your master. How can you be on terms of friendship with me?\" Thus, when a ruler of a thousand chariots sought to be on terms of friendship with a scholar, he could not obtain his wish:−− how much less could he call him to his presence! 5 'The duke Ching of Ch'î, once, when he was hunting, called his forester to him by a flag. The forester would not come, and the duke was going to kill him. With reference to this incident, Confucius said, \"The determined officer never forgets that his end may be in a ditch or a stream; the brave officer never forgets that he may lose his head.\" What was it in the forester that Confucius thus approved? He approved his not going to the duke, when summoned by the article which was not appropriate to him.' 6 Chang said, 'May I ask with what a forester should be summoned?' Mencius replied, 'With a skin cap. A common man should be summoned with a plain banner; a scholar who has taken office, with one having dragons embroidered on it; and a Great officer, with one having feathers suspended from the top of the staff. 7 'When the forester was summoned with the article appropriate to the summoning of a Great officer, he would have died rather than presume to go.

Now, righteousness is the way, and propriety is the door, but it is only the superior man who can follow this way, and go out and in by this door. It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The way to Châu is level like a whetstone, And straight as an arrow. The officers tread it, And the lower people see it.\"' 9 Wan Chang said, 'When Confucius received the prince's message calling him, he went without waiting for his carriage. Doing so, did Confucius do wrong?' Mencius replied, 'Confucius was in office, and had to observe its appropriate duties. And moreover, he was summoned on the business of his office.' 1 Mencius said to Wan Chang, 'The scholar whose virtue is most distinguished in a village shall make friends of all the virtuous scholars in the village. The scholar whose virtue is most distinguished throughout a State shall make friends of all the virtuous scholars of that State. The scholar whose virtue is most distinguished throughout the kingdom shall make friends of all the virtuous scholars of the kingdom. 2 'When a scholar feels that his friendship with all the virtuous scholars of the kingdom is not sufficient to satisfy him, he proceeds to ascend to consider the men of antiquity. He repeats their poems, and reads their books, and as he does not know what they were as men, to ascertain this, he considers their history. This is to ascend and make friends of the men of antiquity.' 1 The king Hsüan of Ch'î asked about the office of high ministers. Mencius said, 'Which high ministers is your Majesty asking about?' 'Are there differences among them?' inquired the king. 'There are' was the reply. 'There are the high ministers who are noble and relatives of the prince, and there are those who are of a different surname.' The king said, 'I beg to ask about the high ministers who are noble and relatives of the prince.'

You must do violence and injury to the willow, before you can make cups and bowls with it. If you must do violence and injury to the willow in order to make cups and bowls with it, on your principles you must in the same way do violence and injury to humanity in order to fashion from it benevolence and righteousness! Your words, alas! would certainly lead all men on to reckon benevolence and righteousness to be calamities.' 1 The philosopher Kâo said, 'Man's nature is like water whirling round in a corner. Open a passage for it to the east, and it will flow to the east; open a passage for it to the west, and it will flow to the west. Man's nature is indifferent to good and evil, just as the water is indifferent to the east and west.' 2 Mencius replied, 'Water indeed will flow indifferently to the east or west, but will it flow indifferently up or down? The tendency of man's nature to good is like the tendency of water to flow downwards. There are none but have this tendency to good, just as all water flows downwards. 3 'Now by striking water and causing it to leap up, you may make it go over your forehead, and, by damming and leading it you may force it up a hill;−− but are such movements according to the nature of water?

Benevolence is internal and not external; righteousness is external and not internal.' 2 Mencius asked him, 'What is the ground of your saying that benevolence is internal and righteousness external?' He replied, 'There is a man older than I, and I give honour to his age. It is not that there is first in me a principle of such reverence to age. It is just as when there is a white man, and I consider him white; according as he is so externally to me. On this account, I pronounce of righteousness that it is external.' 3 Mencius said, 'There is no difference between our pronouncing a white horse to be white and our pronouncing a white man to be white. But is there no difference between the regard with which we acknowledge the age of an old horse and that with which we acknowledge the age of an old man? And what is it which is called righteousness?−− the fact of a man's being old? or the fact of our giving honour to his age?' 4 Kâo said, 'There is my younger brother;−− I love him. But the younger brother of a man of Ch'in I do not love: that is, the feeling is determined by myself, and therefore I say that benevolence is internal. On the other hand, I give honour to an old man of Ch'û, and I also give honour to an old man of my own people: that is, the feeling is determined by the age, and therefore I say that righteousness is external.' 5 Mencius answered him, 'Our enjoyment of meat roasted by a man of Ch'in does not differ from our enjoyment of meat roasted by ourselves. Thus, what you insist on takes place also in the case of such things, and will you say likewise that our enjoyment of a roast is external?' 1 The disciple Mang Chî asked Kung−tû, saying, 'On what ground is it said that righteousness is internal?'

Mang Chî argued, 'Now your feeling of reverence rests on the one, and now the honour due to age is rendered to the other;−− this is certainly determined by what is without, and does not proceed from within.' 4 Kung−tû was unable to reply, and told the conversation to Mencius. Mencius said, 'You should ask him, \"Which do you respect most,−− your uncle, or your younger brother?\" He will answer, \"My uncle.\" Ask him again, \"If your younger brother be personating a dead ancestor, to which do you show the greater respect,−− to him or to your uncle?\" He will say, \"To my younger brother.\" You can go on, \"But where is the respect due, as you said, to your uncle?\" He will reply to this, \"I show the respect to my younger brother, because of the position which he occupies,\" and you can likewise say, \"So my respect to the villager is because of the position which he occupies. Ordinarily, my respect is rendered to my elder brother; for a brief season, on occasion, it is rendered to the villager.\"' 5 Mang Chî heard this and observed, 'When respect is due to my uncle, I respect him, and when respect is due to my younger brother, I respect him;−− the thing is certainly determined by what is without, and does not proceed from within.'

This is what I mean in saying that the nature is good. 6 'If men do what is not good, the blame cannot be imputed to their natural powers. 7 'The feeling of commiseration belongs to all men; so does that of shame and dislike; and that of reverence and respect; and that of approving and disapproving. The feeling of commiseration implies the principle of benevolence; that of shame and dislike, the principle of righteousness; that of reverence and respect, the principle of propriety; and that of approving and disapproving, the principle of knowledge. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and knowledge are not infused into us from without. We are certainly furnished with them. And a different view is simply owing to want of reflection.

Mencius answered, 'The senses of hearing and seeing do not think, and are obscured by external things. When one thing comes into contact with another, as a matter of course it leads it away. To the mind belongs the office of thinking. By thinking, it gets the right view of things; by neglecting to think, it fails to do this. These−− the senses and the mind−− are what Heaven has given to us. Let a man first stand fast in the supremacy of the nobler part of his constitution, and the inferior part will not be able to take it from him. It is simply this which makes the great man.' 1 Mencius said, 'There is a nobility of Heaven, and there is a nobility of man. Benevolence, righteousness, self−consecration, and fidelity, with unwearied joy in these virtues;−− these constitute the nobility of Heaven. To be a kung, a ch'ing, or a tâ−fû;−− this constitutes the nobility of man. 2 'The men of antiquity cultivated their nobility of Heaven, and the nobility of man came to them in its train. 3 'The men of the present day cultivate their nobility of Heaven in order to seek for the nobility of man, and when they have obtained that, they throw away the other:−− their delusion is extreme. The issue is simply this, that they must lose that nobility of man as well.' 2 'The honour which men confer is not good honour. Those whom Châo the Great ennobles he can make mean again. 3 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"He has filled us with his wine, He has satiated us with his goodness.\" \"Satiated us with his goodness,\" that is, satiated us with benevolence and Chapter 22 120"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"righteousness, and he who is so satiated, consequently, does not wish for the fat meat and fine millet of men.

Those, however, who now−a−days practise benevolence do it as if with one cup of water they could save a whole waggon−load of fuel which was on fire, and when the flames were not extinguished, were to say that water cannot subdue fire. This conduct, moreover, greatly encourages those who are not benevolent. 2 'The final issue will simply be this−− the loss of that small amount of benevolence.' 2 'A master−workman, in teaching others, uses the compass and square, and his pupils do the same.' −− Chapter 22 −− Chapter 22 121"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Chapter 23 1 A man of Zan asked the disciple Wû−lû, saying, 'Is an observance of the rules of propriety in regard to eating, or eating merely, the more important?'

The answer again was, 'The observance of the rules of propriety in the matter is the more important.' 3 The man pursued, 'If the result of eating only according to the rules of propriety will be death by starvation, while by disregarding those rules we may get food, must they still be observed in such a case? If according to the rule that he shall go in person to meet his wife a man cannot get married, while by disregarding that rule he may get married, must he still observe the rule in such a case?' 4 Wû−lû was unable to reply to these questions, and the next day he went to Tsâu, and told them to Mencius.

Here is a man, whose strength was not equal to lift a duckling:−− he was then a man of no strength. But to−day he says, \"I can lift 3,000 catties' weight,\" and he is a man of strength. And so, he who can lift the weight which Wû Hwo lifted is just another Wû Hwo. Why should a man make a want of ability the subject of his grief? It is only that he will not do the thing. 4 'To walk slowly, keeping behind his elders, is to perform the part of a younger. To walk quickly and precede his elders, is to violate the duty of a younger brother. Now, is it what a man cannot do−− to walk slowly? It is what he does not do.

'Because of the murmuring which it expresses,' was the reply. 2 Mencius answered, 'How stupid was that old Kâo in dealing with the ode! There is a man here, and a native of Yüeh bends his bow to shoot him. I will advise him not to do so, but speaking calmly and smilingly;−− for no other reason but that he is not related to me. But if my own brother be bending his bow to shoot the man, then I will advise him not to do so, weeping and crying the while;−− for no other reason than that he is related to me.

Where the parent's fault was great, not to have murmured on account of it would have increased the want of natural affection. Where the parent's fault was small, to have murmured on account of it would have been to act like water which frets and foams about a stone that interrupts its course. To increase the want of natural affection would have been unfilial, and to fret and foam in such a manner would also have been unfilial. 5 'Confucius said, \"Shun was indeed perfectly filial!

Why must you use that word \"profit.\"' 1 When Mencius was residing in Tsâu, the younger brother of the chief of Zan, who was guardian of Zan at the time, paid his respects to him by a present of silks, which Mencius received, not going to acknowledge it. When he was sojourning in P'ing−lû, Ch'û, who was prime minister of the State, sent him a similar present, which he received in the same way. 2 Subsequently, going from Tsâu to Zan, he visited the guardian; but when he went from Chapter 23 125"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Ping−lû to the capital of Ch'î, he did not visit the minister Ch'û. The disciple Wû−lû was glad, and said, 'I have got an opportunity to obtain some instruction.' 3 He asked accordingly, 'Master, when you went to Zan, you visited the chief's brother; and when you went to Ch'î, you did not visit Ch'û. Was it not because he is only the minister?' 4 Mencius replied, 'No. It is said in the Book of History, \"In presenting an offering to a superior, most depends on the demonstrations of respect. If those demonstrations are not equal to the things offered, we say there is no offering, that is, there is no act of the will presenting the offering.\" 5 'This is because the things so offered do not constitute an offering to a superior.' 6 Wû−lû was pleased, and when some one asked him what Mencius meant, he said, 'The younger of Zan could not go to Tsâu, but the minister Ch'û might have gone to P'ing−lû.' 1 Shun−yü K'wan said, 'He who makes fame and meritorious services his first objects, acts with a regard to others. He who makes them only secondary objects, acts with a regard to himself. You, master, were ranked among the three chief ministers of the State, but before your fame and services had reached either to the prince or the people, you have left your place. Is this indeed the way of the benevolent?' 2 Mencius replied, 'There was Po'î;−− he abode in an inferior situation, and would not, with his virtue, serve a degenerate prince. There was Î Yin;−− he five times went to T'ang, and five times went to Chieh. There was Hûi of Liû−hsiâ;−− he did not disdain to serve a vile prince, nor did he decline a small office. The courses pursued by those three worthies were different, but their aim was one. And what was their one aim? We must answer−− \"To be perfectly virtuous.\" And so it is simply after this that superior men strive. Why must they all pursue the same course?' 3 K'wan pursued, 'In the time of the duke Mû of Lû, the government was in the hands of Kung−î, while Tsze−liû and Tsze−sze were ministers.

When Mien Ch'ü lived in Kâo−t'ang, the people in the parts of Ch'î on the west became skilful at singing in his prolonged manner. The wives of Hwa Châu and Ch'î Liang bewailed their husbands so skilfully, that they changed the manners of the State. When there is the gift within, it manifests itself without. I have never seen the man who could do the deeds of a worthy, and did not realize the work of one. Therefore there are now no men of talents and virtue. If there were, I should know them.' 6 Mencius answered, 'When Confucius was chief minister of Justice in Lû, the prince came not to follow his counsels. Soon after there was the solstitial sacrifice, and when a part of the flesh presented in sacrifice was not sent to him, he went away even without taking off his cap of ceremony. Those who did not know him supposed it was on account of the flesh. Those who knew him supposed that it was on account of the neglect of the usual ceremony.

When the sovereign entered the boundaries of a State, if the new ground was being reclaimed, and the old fields well cultivated; if the old were nourished and the worthy honoured; and if men of distinguished talents were placed in office: then the prince was rewarded,−− rewarded with an addition to his territory. On the other hand, if, on entering a State, the ground was found left wild or overrun with weeds; if the old were neglected and the worthy unhonoured; and if the offices were filled with hard taxgatherers: then the prince was reprimanded. If a prince once omitted his attendance at court, he was punished by degradation of rank; if he did so a second time, be was deprived of a portion of his territory; if he did so a third time, the royal forces were set in motion, and he was removed from his government. Thus the sovereign commanded the punishment, but did not himself inflict it, while the princes inflicted the punishment, but did not command it. The five chiefs, however, dragged the princes to punish other princes, and hence I say that they were sinners against the three kings. 3 'Of the five chiefs the most powerful was the duke Hwan. At the assembly of the princes in K'wei−ch'iû, he bound the victim and placed the writing upon it, but did not slay it to smear their mouths with the blood.

Be not forgetful of strangers and travellers.\" The fourth was, \"Let not offices be hereditary, nor let officers be pluralists. In the selection of officers let the object be to get the proper men. Let not a ruler take it on himself to put to death a Great officer.\" The fifth was,−− \"Follow no crooked policy in making embankments. Impose no restrictions on the sale of grain. Let there be no promotions without first announcing them to the sovereign.\" It was then said, \"All we who have united in this agreement shall hereafter maintain amicable relations.\" The princes of the present day all violate these five prohibitions, and therefore I say that the princes of the present day are sinners against the five chiefs. 128"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"4 'The crime of him who connives at, and aids, the wickedness of his prince is small, but the crime of him who anticipates and excites that wickedness is great.

Respect for elders is the working of righteousness. There is no other reason for those feelings;−− they belong to all under heaven.' Mencius said, 'When Shun was living amid the deep retired mountains, dwelling with the trees and rocks, and wandering among the deer and swine, the difference between him and the rude inhabitants of those remote hills appeared very small.

The husbandmen cultivated their farms of 100 mâu, and thus their families of eight mouths were secured against want. 3 'The expression, \"The chief of the West knows well how to nourish the old,\" refers to his regulation of the fields and dwellings, his teaching them to plant the mulberry and nourish those animals, and his instructing the wives and children, so as to make them nourish their aged. At fifty, warmth cannot be maintained without silks, and at seventy flesh is necessary to satisfy the appetite. Persons not kept warm nor supplied with food are said to be starved and famished, but among the people of king Wan, there were no aged who were starved or famished.

The hunger and thirst, in fact, injure their palate. And is it only the mouth and belly which are injured by hunger and thirst? Men's minds are also injured by them. 2 'If a man can prevent the evils of hunger and thirst from being any evils to his mind, he need not have any sorrow about not being equal to other men.' Mencius said, 'A man with definite aims to be accomplished may be compared to one digging a well. To dig the well to a depth of seventy−two cubits, and stop without reaching the spring, is after all throwing away the well.' 1 Mencius said, 'Benevolence and righteousness were natural to Yâo and Shun.

What greater example can there be than this of not eating the bread of idleness?' 1 The king's son, Tien, asked Mencius, saying, 'What is the business of the unemployed scholar?' 2 Mencius replied, 'To exalt his aim.' 3 Tien asked again, 'What do you mean by exalting the aim?' The answer was, 'Setting it simply on benevolence and righteousness. He thinks how to put a single innocent person to death is contrary to benevolence; how to take what one has not a right to is contrary to righteousness; that one's dwelling should be benevolence; and one's path should be righteousness. Where else should he dwell? What other path should he pursue? When benevolence is the dwelling−place of the heart, and righteousness the path of the life, the business of a great man is complete.' Mencius said, 'Supposing that the kingdom of Ch'î were offered, contrary to righteousness, to Ch'an Chung, he would not receive it, and all people believe in him, as a man of the highest worth. But this is only the righteousness which declines a dish of rice or a plate of soup. A man can have no greater crimes than to disown his parents and relatives, and the relations of sovereign and minister, superiors and inferiors. How can it be allowed to give a man credit for the great excellences because he possesses a small one?' 1 T'âo Ying asked, saying, 'Shun being sovereign, and Kâo−yâo chief minister of justice, if Kû−sâu had murdered a man, what would have been done in the case?' 2 Mencius said, 'Kâo−yâo would simply have apprehended him.' 3 'But would not Shun have forbidden such a thing?'

Great is the influence of position! Are we not all men's sons in this respect?' 2 Mencius said, 'The residence, the carriages and horses, and the dress of the king's son, are mostly the same as those of other men. That he looks so is occasioned by his position. How much more should a peculiar air distinguish him whose position is in the wide house of the world! 3 'When the prince of Lû went to Sung, he called out at the T'ieh−châi gate, and the keeper said, \"This is not our prince.

The addition of even a single day is better than not mourning at all.

When right principles disappear from the kingdom, one's person must vanish along with one's principles. 2 'I have not heard of one's principles being dependent for their manifestation on other men.' 1 The disciple Kung−tû said, 'When Kang of T'ang made his appearance in your school, it seemed proper that a polite consideration should be paid to him, and yet you did not answer him. Why was that?' 2 Mencius replied, 'I do not answer him who questions me presuming on his nobility, nor him who presumes on his talents, nor him who presumes on his age, nor him who presumes on services performed to me, nor him who presumes on old acquaintance.

Here is a man whose desires are few:−− in some things he may not be able to keep his heart, but they will be few. Here is a man whose desires are many:−− in some things he may be able to keep his heart, but they will be few.' 1 Mencius said, 'Tsang Hsî was fond of sheep−dates, and his son, the philosopher Tsang, could not bear to eat sheep−dates.' 2 Kung−sun Ch'âu asked, saying, 'Which is best,−− minced meat and broiled meat, or sheep−dates?' Mencius said, 'Mince and broiled meat, to be sure.' Kung−sun Ch'âu went on, 'Then why did the philosopher Tsang eat mince and broiled meat, and would not eat sheep−dates?' Mencius answered, 'For mince and broiled meat there is a common liking, while that for sheep−dates was peculiar. We avoid the name, but do not avoid the surname. The surname is common; the name is peculiar.' 1 Wan Chang asked, saying, 'Confucius, when he was in Ch'an, said: \"Let me return. The scholars of my school are ambitious, but hasty. They are for advancing and seizing their object, but cannot forget their early ways.\" Why did Confucius, when he was in Ch'an, think Chapter 28 155"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"of the ambitious scholars of Lû?' 2 Mencius replied, 'Confucius not getting men pursuing the true medium, to whom he might communicate his instructions, determined to take the ardent and the cautiously−decided. The ardent would advance to seize their object; the cautiously−decided would keep themselves from certain things. It is not to be thought that Confucius did not wish to get men pursuing the true medium, but being unable to assure himself of finding such, he therefore thought of the next class.' 3 'I venture to ask what sort of men they were who could be styled \"The ambitious?\"' 4 'Such,' replied Mencius, 'as Ch'in Chang, Tsang Hsî, and Mû P'ei, were those whom Confucius styled \"ambitious.\"' 5 'Why were they styled \"ambitious?\"' 6 The reply was, 'Their aim led them to talk magniloquently, saying, \"The ancients!\" \"The ancients!\" But their actions, where we fairly compare them with their words, did not correspond with them. 7 'When he found also that he could not get such as were thus ambitious, he wanted to get scholars who would consider anything impure as beneath them. Those were the cautiously−decided, a class next to the former.' 8 Chang pursued his questioning, 'Confucius said, \"They are only your good careful people of the villages at whom I feel no indignation, when they pass my door without entering my house. Your good careful people of the villages are the thieves of virtue.\" What sort of people were they who could be styled \"Your good careful people of the villages?\"' 9 Mencius replied, 'They are those who say, \"Why are they so magniloquent? Their words have not respect to their actions and their actions have not respect to their words, but they say, \"The ancients! The ancients! Why do they act so peculiarly, and are so cold and Chapter 28 156"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"distant? Born in this age, we should be of this age, to be good is all that is needed.\" Eunuch−like, flattering their generation;−− such are your good careful men of the villages.' 10 Wan Chang said, 'Their whole village styles those men good and careful. In all their conduct they are so. How was it that Confucius considered them the thieves of virtue?' 11 Mencius replied, 'If you would blame them, you find nothing to allege. If you would criticise them, you have nothing to criticise. They agree with the current customs. They consent with an impure age. Their principles have a semblance of right−heartedness and truth. Their conduct has a semblance of disinterestedness and purity. All men are pleased with them, and they think themselves right, so that it is impossible to proceed with them to the principles of Yâo and Shun. On this account they are called \"The thieves of virtue.\" 12 'Confucius said, \"I hate a semblance which is not the reality. I hate the darnel, lest it be confounded with the corn. I hate glib−tonguedness, lest it be confounded with righteousness. I hate sharpness of tongue, lest it be confounded with sincerity. I hate the music of Chang, lest it be confounded with the true music. I hate the reddish blue, lest it be confounded with vermilion. I hate your good careful men of the villages, lest they be confounded with the truly virtuous.\" 13 'The superior man seeks simply to bring back the unchanging standard, and, that being correct, the masses are roused to virtue. When they are so aroused, forthwith perversities and glossed wickedness disappear.' 1 Mencius said, 'From Yâo and Shun down to T'ang were 500 years and more. As to Yu and Kâo Yâo, they saw those earliest sages, and so knew their doctrines, while T'ang heard their doctrines as transmitted, and so knew them. 2 'From T'ang to king Wan were 500 years and more. As to Î Yin, and Lâi Chû, they saw T'ang and knew his doctrines, while king Wan heard them as transmitted, and so knew them. 3 'From king Wan to Confucius were 500 years and more.

Yea, is there no one to do so?' −− Chapter 28 −− Chapter 28 158"}]
