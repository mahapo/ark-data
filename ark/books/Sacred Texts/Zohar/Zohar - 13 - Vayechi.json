[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" 1. \"And Ya'akov lived\" Rabbi Yosi opens a discussion on the meaning of the quotation, \"And Ya'akov lived,\" which has high mysteries contained in it, because Ya'akov arrived at a hitherto unprecedented prophecy \"and lived\" in Egypt, among his exiled descendants. Rabbi Yosi next questions how this is possible when the name Ya'akov indicates smallness, while Yisrael indicates greatness. Rabbi Elazar responds by pointing out that scripture indicates Ya'akov purchased his birthright, which is tantamount to greatness. Rabbi Shimon further states that Ya'akov, not Yisrael, was chosen by God to be a sapphire in the Throne of Glory. Ya'akov's name was then changed to Yisrael, to reflect the Mercy of Judgment, since judgment is the cause of the revelation of mercy, and those banished to Egypt were judged and shown mercy by God. Rabbi Shimon concludes by saying that the whole of Ya'akov's life was 147 years, divided into three periods of exile, the first of which was seven years. The number seven is significant because it represents atonement by the holy children, exiled \"seven times,\" according to the number of sins they perpetrated. The Relevance of this Passage The phrase \"and he lived\" is a code alluding to the fact that Ya'akov had attained a lofty level of spirituality and prophecy. This feat was achieved during his sojourn in Egypt, which itself is a code word representing negativity and the materialism of our physical existence. In most sections of Zohar, the names Ya'akov and Yisrael are two designations for the patriarch, indicating two levels of his spirituality, Ya'akov being a lower level and Yisrael signifying a higher one. However, in this particular section of Zohar, the name Ya'akov is used to indicate an exalted spiritual level. The reason for this is to convey the different form of Light that is aroused when one ascends out of negativity and darkness. Hence, the underlying purpose of this passage is to imbue the reader with the spiritual fortitude necessary to elevate and climb out of any darkness or negativity currently in their life. 1. \"And Ya'akov lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years\" (Beresheet 47:28). Rabbi Yosi said: Ya'akov's heart saw through prophecy in Egypt that his descendants would suffer many exiles-NAMELY HE SAW ALL THE EXILES from then until now, until the End, and the Time of the Coming of Mashiach. 2. Ya'akov arrived at the prophecy of \"and lived\" only in Egypt. It was an excellent prophecy, the like of which was never prophesied before. None of the prophets was worthy of it except for him and Moshe ALONE. It is written of Moshe: \"For no man shall see me, and live\" (Shemot 33:20). Of Ya'akov, it is written: \"And Ya'akov lived\" REFERRING TO the prophecy which descends from the shining mirror, TIFERET. 3. Ya'akov wanted to prophecy concerning the exiles of his sons in the land of Cna'an and in any land wherein they dwelt WHICH came from the land of Egypt; TO WIT, ALL EXILES ARE INCLUDED WITHIN EGYPT. His heart broke, as it is written: \"Now Ya'akov saw that there was corn (also: 'breaking') in Egypt\" (Beresheet 42:1). 4. Hence, when it came to pass that \"Ya'akov lived in Egypt,\" he did not rejoice, because this land was the bond of the nations; TO WIT, ALL THE FILTH OF THE NATIONS LIES THERE. ALSO, the sapphires of the Throne of Glory, THE SECRET OF THE CAPTIVE SPARKS OF CHOCHMAH AMONGST THEM, CALLED SAPPHIRES ACCORDING TO THE SECRET MEANING OF THE VERSE: \"AND ABOVE THE FIRMAMENT THAT WAS OVER THEIR HEADS WAS THE LIKENESS OF A THRONE, IN APPEARANCE LIKE A SAPPHIRE STONE\" (YECHEZKEL 1:26). Nobody came TO SIFT THEM, neither from the upper nor from the lower, save the living. This is the secret of: \"For no man shall see Me, and live\" (Shemot 33:20). "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 5. There are High Mysteries in this verse, and we friends wonder about them, for it says that Ya'akov lived instead of Yisrael, TO WIT 'AND YISRAEL LIVED.' FOR THE NAME YA'AKOV INDICATES SMALLNESS, AND THE NAME YISRAEL INDICATES MOCHIN OF GREATNESS, WHILE \"AND LIVED\" ALLUDES TO THE LIGHT OF CHAYAH, WHICH IS THE MOCHIN OF GREATNESS. IT SHOULD HAVE SAID: 'AND YISRAEL LIVED.' How do we know that Yisrael INDICATES MOCHIN OF GREATNESS? From the verse: \"Yisrael is holy to Hashem\" (Yirmeyah 2:3), HOLY BEING AN ALLUSION TO GREATNESS. It also says, \"Yisrael is My son, My firstborn\" (Shemot 4:22), FIRSTBORN BEING AN ALLUSION TO GREATNESS. THUS, THE NAME YISRAEL IS MENTIONED WITH RELATION TO GREATNESS AND NOT YA'AKOV, WHICH IS A NAME OF SMALLNESS, ACCORDING TO THE SECRET MEANING OF THE VERSE: \"HOW SHALL YA'AKOV STAND? FOR HE IS SMALL\" (AMOS 7:2). Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon, said: Yet scripture says, \"and he sold his birthright to Ya'akov\" (Beresheet 25:33), FOR WITH THE BIRTHRIGHT, WHICH IS GREATNESS, THE NAME YA'AKOV IS MENTIONED. THUS IT IS NO QUESTION WHY IT SAYS \"AND YA'AKOV LIVED\" INSTEAD OF 'AND YISRAEL LIVED.' 6. His father Rabbi Shimon said to him: When Yisrael were righteous men of truth and gave charity, they were not afraid, save Ya'akov alone, WHO, THE VERSE TELLS US, WAS AFRAID, SAYING: \"FOR I FEAR HIM\" (BERESHEET 32:12), WHILE YISRAEL IS A NAME OF GREATNESS, WITHOUT FEAR. IT IS due to the good deeds YISRAEL did, and the kindness amongst them THAT THEY HAD NO FEAR. 7. When they sinned and were exiled because of their transgressions and evil deeds, they could not bear THE FEAR that they would really stay forever IN EXILE for their sins. Thus came the aspect of Mercy and Judgment joined WHICH IS THE MEANING OF THE NAME Yisrael, and put them in exile. 8. Well asked, son, IN RELATION TO THE VERSE, \"AND HE SOLD HIS BIRTHRIGHT TO YA'AKOV.\" But whoever looks into it will know that Ya'akov attached to \"and lived\" represents holiness, LIKE THE NAME YISRAEL. In relation to this secret, it has been said that Ya'akov was chosen by the Holy One, blessed be He, to be a sapphire in the Throne of Glory, INSTEAD OF YISRAEL. 9. Rabbi Shimon opened the discussion, saying: \"Yet with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones\" (Yeshayah 57:15). \"The heart of the contrite ones\" is Ya'akov, as it says \"AND YA'AKOV LIVED,\" FOR from beneath the grade prophecies and blessings descended upon him even in Egypt. 10. We have learned that Rabbi Aba said: The heart sees that, while Ya'akov lived in Egypt, his prophecy was not sublime, for the land was detested. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 11. Come and behold: he did not deserve to bless any of his sons, and had no spirit with which to bless, except in Egypt. When he did, he blessed each of them according to a mystery, which is, \"Now Ya'akov saw that there was corn (also: 'breaking') in Egypt. Ya'akov said to his sons, 'Why do you look at one another?'\" Come and see, prophecy was given only to the broken-hearted, as it is written: \"Go down there, and buy (also: 'break') us from there, that we may live, and not die\" (Beresheet 42:2). 12. Rabbi Yosi said: Under the Holy Throne of Glory is Ya'akov as a sapphire, THE SAPPHIRE pertains to his aspect of Judgment. Then scripture came and said: \"And he said: 'Your name shall be called no more Ya'akov but Yisrael: for you have contended with Elohim and with men, and have prevailed\" (Beresheet 32:29). Now we find that Ya'akov found out there was Judgment within him, as it is written: \"The sun rose upon him\" (Ibid. 32). And the secret of the matter is: \"Woe to us! For the day declines, for the shadows of the evening are lengthened\" (Yirmeyah 6:4). 13. Rabbi Shimon said: When they were banished from Jerusalem, and the daily offering was no more, and the foe defiled the Temple, Malchut, THE NUKVA OF ZEIR ANPIN, could not then bear the children of Yisrael and their sins. Only THE GRADE OF THE NAME, Yisrael COULD SUFFER THEM, because it is two-sided of Mercy and Judgment. SINCE THE JUDGMENT IS THE CAUSE OF THE REVELATION OF MERCY, THEREFORE THE JUDGMENT IS ALSO CONSIDERED AS MERCY. 14. The words, \"Your name shall be called no more Ya'akov but Yisrael,\" when clearly understood, mean that Yisrael is superior to Ya'akov, AND THEREFORE HE BLESSED HIM WITH THE NAME YISRAEL. And it is for them that the staff of Moshe was engraved with the Holy Name on both sides, the one of Mercy of Judgment, THE GRADE OF YISRAEL, and the other Judgment of Judgment, THE GRADE OF YA'AKOV. 15. This is the secret of: \"He has not beheld iniquity in Ya'akov nor has He seen perverseness in Yisrael\" (Bemidbar 23:21), WHICH MEANS HE DID NOT BEHOLD INIQUITY IN YA'AKOV, BUT DID SEE PERVERSENESS. YET IN YISRAEL, EVEN PERVERSENESS HE DID NOT BEHOLD, FOR IN IT JUDGMENT IS ALSO CONSIDERED MERCY. HE EXPLAINS, We are thrown into exile amidst enemies, and the Shechinah is gone from the King, ZEIR ANPIN, and separated from Him. EVENTUALLY He will cause the Shechinah to dwell among us and redeem us, FOR BANISHMENT BRINGS US TO REPENT, AND REPENTANCE BRINGS REDEMPTION. THEREFORE, JUDGMENT IN YISRAEL CHANGES INTO MERCY. THEREFORE SCRIPTURE SAYS, \"NOR HAS HE SEEN PERVERSENESS IN YISRAEL,\" WHICH IS ALL MERCY. BUT THE GRADE OF YA'AKOV IS NOT SO, FOR IT CONTAINS PERVERSENESS. HENCE THE ANGEL BLESSED HIM: \"YOUR NAME SHALL BE CALLED NO MORE YA'AKOV BUT YISRAEL,\" WHICH CONTAINS BOTH JUDGMENT AND MERCY, EXILE AND REDEMPTION, AND IS WHOLLY MERCIFUL. This is the secret of the verse, \"Thus says Hashem, the King of Yisrael, and His redeemer, Hashem Tzva'ot\" (Yeshayah 44:6): and lived, living. \"Thus says Hashem, The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool\" (Yeshayah 66:1). "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 16. Within the upper grade YISRAEL two legs, NETZACH AND HOD, live. NETZACH IS CALLED \"AND LIVED (HEB. VAYECHI, VAV YUD CHET YUD)\" AND HOD 'LIVING (HEB. CHAI, CHET YUD),' BOTH INCLUDED WITHIN THE WORD FOR \"AND LIVED.\" HE EXPLAINS: Large Yud contains small Yud, large Chet contains Tav; there are Vav and Yud in Vav, and in Yud - Vav and Dalet. This comes from the upper one, YISRAEL. 17. THESE ARE THE TWO DIVISIONS INCLUDED within the precious stone SAPPHIRE underneath the Throne of Glory, which is in the land of Egypt. For it is written, \"And Hashem shall smite Egypt\" (Yeshayah 19:22), which is the second division, while the verse, \"For your dew is as the dew on herbs\" (Yeshayah 26:19) is the first division. 18. The second division, WHICH ALLUDES TO the exile, is therefore connected with the first division, WHICH ALLUDES TO REVIVAL AND REDEMPTION. Come and see the verse, \"O house of Ya'akov, come, and let us walk in the light of Hashem\" (Yeshayah 2:5), WHICH MEANS that the letters indicating the exile they were sentenced to for their sins, according to Truth and Justice, have a remedy within the Torah. And IF YOU KEEP IT, you shall come out of the filth and mud, which is exile; and walk by the light of Hashem, WHICH IS RESURECTION AND REDEMPTION. SINCE THE EXILE CAUSED THE RETURN TO TORAH WHICH LEADS TO THE REDEMPTION, SO WE FIND BOTH DIVISIONS IN ONE LETTER. 19. THE LETTERS Aleph and Resh-Tzadi of Eretz (lit. 'land') are the land which sadly goes INTO EXILE, by the decree of the book of the Torah; TO WIT, THE FOUR HUNDRED YEARS MENTIONED IN THE DECREE 'BETWEEN THE PIECES.' They are divided by land into Aleph and Resh-Tzadi. It may be found by the decree of the book of Torah that Resh-Tzadi come together in exile, MEANING THAT THEY WERE IN EXILE IN EGYPT RESH-TZADI (=290) YEARS; WHICH, TOGETHER WITH LEPH (OF ALEPH =110), AMOUNTS TO FOUR HUNDRED YEARS. What is the Egyptian exile? Avraham was told his children would be in exile for four hundred years, yet if you count it, it amounts to 290 years only. 20. \"And Yosef died, being a hundred and ten years old\" (Beresheet 50:26). Rabbi Shimon opened the discussion saying: \"Behold, the young woman is with child, and she will bear a son, and shall call his name 'Immanuel' (lit. 'El is with us')\" (Yeshayah 7:14). Pregnancy and birth ARE MENTIONED IN THIS VERSE, AND were fulfilled in exiles, bad troubles and evil times, FOR THE VERSE CONTINUES: \"FOR BEFORE THE CHILD SHALL KNOW HOW TO REFUSE THE EVIL AND CHOOSE THE GOOD, THE LAND...SHALL BE DESERTED...\" (IBID.16). And though THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE, will be with us during these years, AS INDICATED BY THE CHILD'S NAME, IMMANU-EL, WHICH IS THE NAME OF THE SHECHINAH, YET The Shechinah trembled and separated from Her husband, ZEIR ANPIN, and stayed with us in exile. THOUGH THE SHECHINAH IS WITH US, SHE SUFFERES PAIN AND EXILE, AND IS ALONE. SO THERE IS PREGNANCY THAT PRECEDS THE BIRTH OF EXILE. \"A hundred and ten years old,\" is the further impression CONSIDERED THE PREGNANCY OF THE EXILE. THE VERSE wishes to point that out of the EGYPTIAN exile, one hundred and ten years passed AS PREGNANCY, WHILE 290 years WERE THE EXILE ITSELF. In all, there are four hundred years WHICH THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE, SPOKE OF TO AVRAHAM, IN THE DECREE OF 'BETWEEN THE PIECES.' The exile of Ya'akov started only when Yosef died. In connection to this it was said: \"And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that makes desolate be set up, there shall be a thousand (Heb. eleph) two hundred and ninety days\" (Daniel 12:11). "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 21. \"So the whole age of Ya'akov was a hundred and forty seven years\" (Beresheet 47:28). THE 147 YEARS OF YA'AKOV'S LIFE CONTAIN the secret of the number of correction by exile the descendants will endure, who were exiled under strict Judgment into three exiles. The first one in Egypt is likened to seven years. Rabbi Chiya opened the discussion saying: \"I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles, and by the hinds of the fields\" (Shir Hashirim 2:7). HERE TOO, THE NUMBER SEVEN (HEB. SHEVA), OF YA'AKOV'S LIFE, IS DERIVED FROM THE OATH (HEB. SHEVUAH), NOT TO AWAKE THE LOVE, UNTIL REDEMPTION PLEASES. 22. Rabbi Shimon said: From this WE LEARN THE EXPLANATION TO THE NUMBER SEVEN. IT IS WRITTEN, \"Hashem appeared to me from afar, saying: I have loved you with an everlasting love\" (Yirmeyah 31:3). FROM AFAR, NAMELY, IN EXILE, BECAUSE GREAT LOVE IS REVEALED ONLY BY EXILE. Here lies the secret, that exile is the means of the children of Yisrael to be freed from exile AND THAT HIS LOVE WILL BE REVEALED TO US. Scripture wishes to point, BY THE NUMBER SEVEN OF YA'AKOV'S LIFE, that the holy children who were exiled for their sins will be sentenced for many years, which will amount to \"seven times... according to your sins\" (Vayikra 26:21). IT ALSO SAYS, \"If Kain shall be avenged sevenfold\" (Beresheet 4:24), WHICH NUMBER FIXES THE DAMAGE THEY MADE, AND REVEALS THE LIGHT OF REDEMPTION. THIS IS during the first exile in Egypt, which is the shortest OF THE EXILES. 23. The second exile is in Babylon, likened to forty years FROM YA'AKOV'S LIFE IN RELATION TO the seven IN EGYPT, for it is longer than it. 24. The third exile is the longest, likened to the hundred years OF YA'AKOV'S LIFE, IN RELATION TO the forty years OF THE BABYLONIAN EXILE. 2. \"And the time drew near...and he called his son Yosef\" Rabbi Chizkiyah begins by explaining that Yisrael saw the torture of exile upon his descendants, and consequently, his soul began to die. Yisrael then gathered his exiles and told them that if they wished to be absolved of their sins, they must behave according to truth and justice in the eyes of God. Rabbi Shimon then explains why Yisrael called only Yosef his son and not all the other exiles. This is because all the children of Yisrael were called Yosef. Rabbi Chizkiyah then refers to the secret of the Vav as including Ya'akov, Yosef, and others, as well as the six Sfirot. The Relevance of this Passage Yisrael's action of talking to the people of the exile is a code for the great patriarch calling upon all generations, including the readers of this passage, and awakening them to the power of the Light and the path to eternal freedom, fulfillment, and the final redemption. When Yisrael calls only the name Yosef, the Zohar is indicating a direct reference to the Sfirah/dimension of Yesod, the portal and funnel through which the supernal Light flows into our world. The name Yosef refers to the Light that is flowing from Yesod to us--the reader and all the people who remain in exile in our current generation. This Light now becomes part of our being. 25. \"And the time drew near for Yisrael to die\" (Beresheet 47:29). Rabbi Chizkiyah said: He saw this trouble of exile upon his children, and his soul drew near death. He did not remain alive when he descended his grades because of the sins of Yisrael. YISRAEL, ZEIR ANPIN, did not go into exile with them, LIKE THE SHECHINAH, WHO WENT INTO EXILE WITH THEM. HE ASKS: Happy is the portion OF YISRAEL, for if He, ZEIR ANPIN, would not have gone down with them into exile, they would have remained among the nations WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO ESCAPE. Why then does it say, \"Why, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer?\" (Yeshayah 50:2). \"Was there none to answer\" alludes to the children of Yisrael, NAMELY ZEIR ANPIN; \"when I came, was there no man\": This is the Shechinah. \"Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness\" SO ZEIR ANPIN DID COME DOWN ALSO WITH THEM INTO EXILE? HE ANSWERS: The Holy One, blessed be He, gave a portion to the children of Yisrael, so that no other minister would rule over them; THUS HE IS WITH THEM IN EXILE. ALSO when they went into exile, "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" The Shechinah is with them, but ZEIR ANPIN is far away from the Shechinah. 26. \"And he called his son Yosef, and said to him, if now I have found favor in your sight.\" He examined all his sons and said to them, I see many evil troubles come upon your children, and ONE SHOULD find supernal Mercy. 27. If you wish to be delivered from all these troubles, swear before me, and we shall have the Master of the universe AS WITNESS between us, that you will conduct yourself according to truth and justice, and behave like your fathers. You shall teach it to every generation that will come after you. If you shall do so, you shall escape all the troubles that will come upon you. 28. Rabbi Shimon said: TO EXPLAIN AWAY THE DIFFICULTY THAT HE CALLED ONLY YOSEF HIS SON AND NOT ALL THE TRIBES, THE WORDS OF RABBI SHIMON ARE BROUGHT HERE. \"And establish justice in the gate: it may be that Hashem Elohim of Tzeva'ot will be gracious to the remnant of Yosef\" (Amos 5:15), for all the children of Yisrael are called Yosef. 29. THE ZOHAR RETURNS TO THE WORDS OF YA'AKOV: 'If you shall do so, you shall bury not one of my children in Egypt, but return safely with me to your land.' 30. It is written: \"Put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh\" (Beresheet 47:29). HE ASKS: What is \"your hand\"? He opened the discussion saying: \"Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty warrior: your glory and your majesty\" (Tehilim 45:4). ALSO \"YOUR HAND UNDER MY THIGH\" ALLUDES TO A SWORD, WHICH IS a sword of Grace and Truth, the two Sfirot which do not separate from each other; NAMELY YESOD WHICH CONTAINS THE LIGHT OF CHASSADIM AND THE LIGHT OF CHOCHMAH, CALLED TRUTH AND BRIGHTNESS OF COUNTENANCE. Therefore it says, \"Love and Truth shall go before you\" (Tehilim 89:15), \"The anger of Hashem divided them\" (Eichah 4:16). And if His children were good and did what they accepted upon them, not one of the children would have died in Egypt, for each kindness that the Holy One blessed be He decrees upon men is on the condition they will be good. As David said: \"That Hashem may continue His word which He spoke concerning me, saying: 'If your children take heed to their way, to walk before Me in Truth'\" (I Melachim 2:4). But if not, He shall not. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 31. Come and behold: better is the spirit of the father than the spirit of the son, for the spirit of the father is that of the son, spirit drawn from spirit. THUS WE FIND THE FATHER'S SPIRIT IN RELATION TO HIM IS THAT OF THE ROOT IN RELATION TO ITS BRANCH. But if another air OF THE OTHER SIDE contributes to the spirit of the son, he is not born whole, but rendered defective by that air OF THE OTHER SIDE; NAMELY \"a wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffs up the wind in her desire\" (Yirmeyah 2:24). 32. We learned that Rabbi Hamnuna Saba (the elder) once went to Cappadocia. Going towards him was Rabbi Yisa Saba. According to Rav Ashlag, this paragraph is a later interpolation, which in other versions starts with Rabbi Aba. 34. \"And he said: 'Swear to me'\" (Beresheet 47:31). Rabbi Chizkiyah opened the discussion saying: \"Hashem has sworn by His right hand, and by the arm of His strength\" (Yeshayah 62:8), WHICH MEANS Hashem swore He would deliver the children of Yisrael from their exile. This is what He swore to them BY THE VERSE: \"AND HE SWORE TO HIM\" (BERESHEET 47:31) HERE WHICH ALSO REFERS TO THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE. He swore to them He would not abandon them in the land of their enemies. 34. \"And he said: 'Let me go, for the day breaks.' And he said: 'I will not let you go, unless you bless me'\" (Beresheet 32:27). What does \"bless me\" mean; TO WIT, WHAT WERE THE BLESSINGS HE CONFERRED UPON HIM? HE ANSWERS: He assigned them to exile and swore to them He would deliver them from it. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 35. We learned that the Holy One, blessed be He, would DO for His children of Yisrael, that they would all dwell under His throne, and excel the high ANGELS. Therefore, one finds a long Vav IN THE TORAH, LIKE IN \"WHATEVER GOES ON ITS BELLY (HEB. GACHON)\" (VAYIKRA 11:42), which is an allusion that the Holy One, blessed be He, swore upon the perfection of the Vav (=six) generations. THE SECRET OF AVRAHAM, YITZCHAK, YA'AKOV, MOSHE, AHARON, AND YOSEF, THE SECRET OF THE SIX SFIROT: CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, AND YESOD. Because of these six, IT IS WRITTEN: \"And Yisrael bowed himself upon the bed's head\" (Beresheet 47:31), YISRAEL BEING THE SECRET OF ZEIR ANPIN, WHICH INCLUDES: CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, AND YESOD. The bowing of Yisrael ALLUDES TO the coming of Mashiach at the end of this time; TO WIT, AFTER SIX THOUSAND YEARS, ALLUDING TO THE SIX COMPLETE SFIROT, CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD AND YESOD, CLOTHED BY SUPERNAL ABA AND IMA, WHICH SFIROT ARE EACH OF A THOUSAND YEARS. And the Shechinah will dwell among them. 3. \"Behold, your father is sick\" Rabbi Chizkiyah begins by saying that this quotation refers to events at the end of exile, and means, literally, Yosef's father, Yisrael, is \"worried and in haste.\" Rabbi Aba then adds that the name Yud-Hei-Vav ??? would be changed to Yud-Hei-Vav-Hei ???? to expedite Yisrael doing good for his children, so they would come out of exile. Rabbi Aba then explains Ya'akov's exposure to truth, and Avraham's to grace. The Relevance of this Passage The Hebrew letters Yud, Hei, Vav, Hei, ???? are known as the Tetragrammaton, one of the Holy Names of The Creator. The addition of the final Hei ? in the Holy Name corresponds to our physical realm. The other three letters ??? represent the Upper Worlds, specifically four dimensions of Keter, Chochmah, Binah, and Zeir Anpin. Thus, this passage is our connection to the Upper Worlds, via the Tetragrammaton, so that we may brighten our lives and the world with the resplendent Light of The Creator. 36. \"And it came to pass after these things that one told Yosef, 'Behold, your father is sick.'\" (Beresheet 48:1). In the Mishnah Rabbi Chizkiyah said, that the verse does not teach us what YOSEF did, but brings before us the events at the end of exile, at the end of the set time. He says that Mashiach, THE SECRET OF YOSEF, will come and say to him, Your Father in heaven makes haste to welcome you, who looks to the end of Mashiach. \"YOUR FATHER IS SICK\" MEANS, HE IS WORRIED AND IN HASTE. \"AND HE TOOK WITH HIM MENASHE AND EFRAIM\" (IBID.). MEANS: May it please Elohim in heaven to receive His children, who increased and multiplied (Heb. paru) in exile, FOR WHICH THEY ARE CALLED EFRAIM, and THEIR SINS forgotten BECAUSE OF THE EXILE, THE SECRET OF THEIR BEING CALLED MENASHE, WHICH IS DERIVED FROM THE WORD FORGETFULNESS (HEB. NESHIYAH). For the Holy One, blessed be He, truly forgot their transgressions. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 37. When Rabbi Aba came, he said he came not to speak ABOUT THE VERSE, BUT TO EXPLAIN ITS MYSTERY. HE SAID: The secret of this matter is very important AS THAT OF THE VERSE, \"Hashem shall add (Heb. yosef) to me another son\" (Beresheet 30:24). As we explained in relation to that verse, the Holy Name written in Yosef, TO WIT, THAT THE THREE-LETTERED NAME Yud-Hei-Vav will say to him, here your Father, the Master over the World to Come, SECRET OF ZEIR ANPIN WITH THE MOCHIN OF SUPERNAL BINAH, CALLED THE WORLD TO COME, wishes to do good for His children, so they may come out of exile. But if you do not favor your Truth BECAUSE YOU FIND THAT THEY DO NOT MERIT IT, here is a four-lettered name Yud-Hei-Vav-Hei to set you right and then will favor it that the Shechinah to return to Her place. 38. For the fathers are the supernal Chariot FOR THE HOLY NAME on high, as it is written: \"And Elohim went up from Avraham\" (Beresheet 17:22), WHICH MEANS HE WAS RIDING ON HIM. IT IS ALSO WRITTEN, \"You will show Truth to Ya'akov, Grace (Heb. chesed) to Avraham\" (Michah 7:20). THUS YA'AKOV WAS A CHARIOT TO TIFERET CALLED TRUTH, AND AVRAHAM A CHARIOT TO CHESED. And we learned that BY THE UNISON OF THE ONE YUD- HEI-VAV-HEI, Mashiach will come. 4. \"At evening time, there will be light\" Rabbi Yosi describes how there will be a day without day or night, until the evening, when there will be light, at which time, two evils will befall Ya'akov's children. But these occur so his children can be taken to \"the good land.\" Rabbi Aba then poses a conundrum: \"What is darkness?\" The others determine that \"darkness is Gehenom.\" The Relevance of this Passage The phrase, \"day without day or night,\" refers to the potential darkness and destruction [God forbid] that may appear before the final redemption of mankind takes place. Two paths to redemption and eternal peace are always available to us, a Light-filled path that embodies mercy and protection, or a darkened path that embodies pain, torment, and suffering. Our egos constantly urge us towards the path of darkness. Through a meditative, intense read of this passage, we can help ourselves, and the world at large, avoid the potential gloom and devastation that attends the path of darkness. 39. Rabbi Yosi opened the discussion with the verse: \"But it shall be one particular day which shall be known as Hashem's, neither day, nor night: but it shall come to pass that at evening time, there will be light\" (Zecharyah 14:7). HE STARTED EXPLAINING THE VERSE, \"AND HE TOOK...EFRAIM AND MENASHE\" (BERESHEET 48:1), BUT EXPLAINED NO FURTHER. THE ZOHAR EXPLAINS THE WORDS OF RABBI YOSI, SAYING THAT HE wishes to say that two evils will befall the children OF YA'AKOV: 1) they will be in exile in the land of their enemies, THIS BEING THE ASPECT OF EFRAIM AND MENASHE. 2) He will not look at them many years on account of their sinning to Truth, and so will abandon them in the land of their enemies. Eventually, He would take their children, to whom these TWO evils befell, and conduct them to the good land, as the verse says, \"AND HE TOOK... MENASHE AND EFRAIM\"; TO WIT, HE WILL TAKE THEM, TO WHOM THE TWO EVILS BEFELL, AND CONDUCT THEM TO THEIR GOOD LAND. 40. There were two great and exalted ministers who were knocking under the Throne of Glory of Yisrael's chieftain, the fifth measure, to cause them to remain in exile for as long AS THEY NEED, FROM THE ASPECT OF EFRAIM, and worse, that He would forget them in the land of their enemies, WHICH IS THE ASPECT OF MENASHE. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 41. These two ministers are two attributes, each containing two aspects; TO WIT, EACH IS DIVIDED INTO TWO ATTRIBUTES. HE EXPLAINS, One ATTRIBUTE came and spoke before the Master of the universe and was given permission to say what it liked. On the one hand, it saw it should be decreed that the children of Yisrael should come out of exile, due to their fathers' merit. On the other hand, it saw they deserve to be sentenced TO REMAIN IN EXILE for their sins, for THE ACCUSERS said great evil things about them. There are four attributes in all. FOR EACH OF THE MINISTERS, THE TWO ATTRIBUTES CONTAINS TWO ASPECTS; TO WIT, ONE FOR AND ONE AGAINST. But they did not have the fifth attribute, Yisrael's chieftain, and they spoke as they pleased. THE TWO MINISTERS SPOKE NOW FOR AND NOW AGAINST, FOR THEY HAD NOT THE FIFTH ATTRIBUTE, WHICH TURNS ALL INTO MERIT. 42. Then the fifth attribute arrived, WHICH WILL BE REVEALED AT THE END OF CORRECTION, to be upon the Throne of Glory of the Holy Name. It would say good things about Yisrael, and the two first measures would no longer be afraid to speak before Him GOOD THINGS ABOUT YISRAEL, AS THEY WERE BEFORE. For the fifth attribute, which was considered the rule of the night, now came out to shine upon them. Therefore RABBI YOSI opened the discussion saying: \"But it shall be one particular day which shall be known as Hashem's, neither day, nor night: but it shall come to pass that at evening time, there will be light.\" 43. We have learned that the verse, \"And Elohim called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night\" (Beresheet 1:5) MEANS THAT THE NUKVA OF ZEIR ANPIN CALLED DARKNESS, AND ALSO CALLED NIGHT, RECEIVES FROM DAY, WHICH IS ZEIR ANPIN. It is also said: \"And darkness was on the face of the deep\" (Ibid. 2) TO WIT, DARKNESS IS A KLIPAH, NOT PERTAINING TO HOLINESS. The verses contradict each other. Rabbi Elazar came to his father Rabbi Shimon and said to him: My father and master, what is the meaning of this CONTRADICTION? He replied to him, From the beginning, up to the sixth generation, THE SECRET OF CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, AND YESOD OF ZEIR ANPIN, He created one Yud-Hei-Vav-Hei, WHICH IS THE SECRET OF BINAH. He explains, This refers to THE SECRET OF Vav of the name YUD-HEI- VAV-HEI, ZEIR ANPIN, upon which BINAH conferred the spirit of Chochmah. THEREFORE, until then, darkness was not known at all. Rabbi Elazar rose and kissed his father's hands. 44. Rabbi Aba rose and asked: What is darkness? The friends turned around, TO WIT, THEY SOUGHT HARD FOR AN ANSWER, but did not arrive at an answer to his question. They did something, NAMELY A CERTAIN MEDITATION, and a voice from before the Master of the universe resounded this verse, \"A land of gloom, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness\" (Iyov 10:22). THIS DARKNESS MEANS Gehenom, for even before the world was created, it was stored for the wicked. FROM THIS, THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT DARKNESS IS GEHENOM. Woe to the wicked, who will abide in this darkness, when Elohim will do all this as it says in, \"For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples: but Hashem shall arise upon you, and His glory shall be seen upon you\" (Yeshayah 60:2). Happy is the portion of Yisrael, that the Holy One, blessed be He, did not create THIS DARKNESS for them. \"Happy is that people, that is in such a case: Happy is that people, whose Elohim is Hashem\" (Tehilim 144:15). 5. \"And one told Ya'akov\" Rabbi Yosi explains that the quotation, \"And one told Ya'akov,\" refers to Ya'akov being told his children would be redeemed. Through this redemption, Ya'akov would receive both truth and grace, which are two Sfirot, also contained in two higher Chariots, Avraham and Ya'akov. The Relevance of this Passage "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" To achieve a higher level of spirituality and existence, we sometimes need to \"borrow\" Light from The Creator in order to use it to awaken and arouse even greater Light in our lives and in this world. This is similar to a businessman borrowing money from a bank for the purpose of building a successful business. In other words, you need money in order to make money. Hence, the primary purpose of this passage is to entrust the readers with Light, so that they may use it to for spiritual purposes and the formation of greater Light. 45. \"And one told Ya'akov, and said: 'Behold, your son Yosef comes to you'\" (Beresheet 48:2). Rabbi Yosi said: It was an angel WHO TOLD YA'AKOV that he was about to pronounce good words about the children of Yisrael at the time they would return to the Holy One, blessed be He, with all their troubles, when Mashiach's end was to come. And He would say to the attribute, YA'AKOV, THE SECRET OF TIFERET, your children are come to you, and the good ones, the children of YISRAEL, will be redeemed. 46. Happy is the portion of Yisrael, who are named the children of the Holy One, blessed be He, that are like angels, OF WHOM IT SAYS, \"And all THE SONS OF Elohim shouted for joy\" (Iyov 38:6). YISRAEL ARE ALSO CALLED the sons of Hashem, AS IT SAYS, \"YOU ARE THE CHILDREN OF HASHEM YOUR ELOHIM\" (DEVARIM 14:1). 47. Come and behold! When do we know that the Holy One, blessed be He, called Ya'akov, 'El'? He said to him: 'You shall be among the lower beings, and I shall be Elohim among the upper beings. Whence do we know that? HE ANSWERS: It is written, \"And Elohim went up from Avraham\" (Beresheet 17:22). Thus the fathers are a Chariot to the Holy One, blessed be He. We learned that \"you will show Truth to Ya'akov, Grace (lit. 'Chesed') to Avraham\" (Michah 7:20) has in it two Sfirot, CHESED, AND TRUTH WHICH IS TIFERET in two bigger and higher Chariots, AVRAHAM AND YA'AKOV. 48. The third one is Yitzchak , WHO BECAME A CHARIOT TO THE SFIRAH OF GVURAH. Whence DO WE KNOW THAT FROM? FROM THE WORDS \"And Ya'akov swore by the fear of his father Yitzchak\" (Beresheet 31:53). For the fear of Yitzchak is a Sfirah of the Holy One, blessed be He, NAMELY GVURAH CALLED FEAR, and became the Throne of Glory, ITS supernal Chariot. Yitzchak's Sfirah, GVURAH, is more important and explicit than the other Sfirot of the fathers, CHESED AND TIFERET. For that reason it is written, \"And Ya'akov swore by the fear of his father Yitzchak\"; NAMELY BY THE SFIRAH OF GVURAH CALLED FEAR, WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. 49. Rabbi Aba opened the discussion saying: \"The Elohim of Avraham, and the Elohim of Nachor, the Elohim of their father, judge between us. And Ya'akov swore by the fear of his father Yitzchak.\" (Beresheet 31:53). From this verse, one may derive THAT YITZCHAK'S SFIRAH IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE OTHERS, FOR HE DID NOT SWEAR BY ELOHIM OF AVRAHAM, BUT BY THE FEAR OF YITZCHAK. 6. \"And sat upon the bed\" Rabbi Shimon explains that chief angel Michael will come to the side of Yisrael at his time of redemption. Yisrael will gain strength from this, and will sit on the bed, which is a code alluding to this truth. Rabbi Shimon then explains that \"marries the daughter of a strange El\" refers to Yisrael, whom, in spite of his sins, would redeem those in exile, and preserve the nations. Rabbi Yosi then describes two angels, Mata and Matatron, as the Shechinah, sent from Binah to protect Yisrael. Rabbi Shimon next explains the meaning of Rut, which details the relationship between mercy and judgment. Rabbis Shimon and Aba then begin a discourse on \"All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full.\" The Relevance of this Passage The assistance of the supernal angels, including Michael, who represents the Right Column energy of mercy, and the protective Light of the Shechinah, is drawn into our lives. This Light also helps to accelerate the end of our personal and global exile. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 50. \"And Yisrael strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.\" (Beresheet 48:2). The secret of the verse is: \"And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great chief angel, who stands for the children of your people: and there shall be a time of trouble\" (Daniel 12:1). Rabbi Shimon says, This is the might of the great Michael, WHO WILL STAND UP FOR YISRAEL AT THE TIME OF REDEMPTION, WHICH WILL BE \"A TIME OF TROUBLE SUCH AS NEVER WAS SINCE THERE WAS A NATION...\" THUS SCRIPTURE CONCLUDES WITH \"AND YISRAEL STRENGTHENED.\" \"And sat upon the bed\": As before when he bowed upon it, AS IT IS WRITTEN: \"AND YISRAEL BOWED HIMSELF UPON THE BED'S HEAD,\" BUT NOW HE SAT UPON IT. HE ASKS: To whom did Ya'akov bow? If you say he bowed to the bed, WHICH IS MALCHUT. The bed was ready TO RECEIVE from him, AND THE GIVER DOES NOT BOW BEFORE THE RECEIVER. HE ANSWERS: He bowed to the circumcision, THE SECRET OF YESOD, of which he was fond. 51. \"For Yehuda has profaned the holiness of Hashem which he loved, and has married the daughter of a strange El\" (Malachi 2:11). HE WAS ASKED A DIFFICULT QUESTION ABOUT THE MEANING OF \"MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A STRANGE EL.\" HE SAYS, When the light was gone from ZEIR ANPIN, due to YISRAEL'S sins, THE SHECHINAH could not stand before ZEIR ANPIN and was exiled from the King. TO WIT, SHE WENT TOGETHER WITH YISRAEL INTO EXILE AMONG THE NATIONS, since She could not leave Her children among the nations to be killed. ZEIR ANPIN was in the Holy Land and, by having foreign nations with him, as it says \"MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A STRANGE EL,\" it conveys that the Shechinah was going into exile with them among the nations, when She was not in the land of Yisrael but in other lands. Thus, by the light of Yisrael, the nations around them were preserved. THEREFORE, IT SAYS \"MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A STRANGE EL.\" (IT LOOKS AS IF IT IS AN INTERPOLATION FROM THE WORDS 'IT CONVEYS.') 52. We learned, Rabbi Yosi said, that there were two ministers, NAMELY ANGELS, under the Holy Throne of Glory. The one, BY NAME OF MATA, dwells within the treasury of the Temple. And here we are in exile, and nothing remained to us but him, who is of the nature OF THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE, and impressed by the Name of the Holy One, blessed be He. THIS IS THE ANGEL MATATRON, WHOSE NAME IS AS THE NAME OF HIS MASTER, AS IT IS WRITTEN OF HIM: \"FOR MY NAME IS IN HIM\" (SHEMOT 23:21). 53. It is written: \"Behold, I send an angel before you, to keep you\" (Shemot 23:20). It is not worthy to speak that way only of the World to Come, NAMELY BINAH, as we explained it to be the protection along the way. TO WIT, THE POWER TO PROTECT COMES FROM BINAH. THEREFORE, IT WAS BINAH WHICH SAID TO YISRAEL, \"BEHOLD, I SEND AN ANGEL,\" NAMELY THE SHECHINAH \"TO KEEP YOU,\" AND NO OTHER GRADE, BECAUSE PROTECTION COMES FROM IT. SHE SAID: I, the Shechinah, hover among you and protect you in exile. She will protect you until bringing you to your country, as you were before. THIS IS WHAT IS WRITTEN, \"I have prepared\" (Ibid.), WITH WHICH the verse CONCLUDES \"to the place which I have prepared,\" for THE LAND was their dwelling place even before. 54. THE ANGEL MENTIONED IS the Shechinah, CLOTHED AND WORKING through Matatron. For the Shechinah was exiled INTO EXILE CALLED, from the King, ZEIR ANPIN, AND SHE WORKS THROUGH MATATRON until THE TIME OF REDEMPTION WHEN She will return to Her place TO ZEIR ANPIN. It is a mystery that: \"For only Og, king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Refaim; behold, his bed is a bed of iron; is it not in Rabba of the children of Amon?\" (Devarim 3:11), as we explained elsewhere. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 55. In the way, which is a parable of the exile, THE SHECHINAH will protect you from all the troubles which will come upon you, until He will come and gather you into the land which He promised to your fathers, which is kept FOR YOU. 56. The second minister underneath the Holy Throne, which dwells in the treasure of the Temple is Nuriel. For the minister appointed over the children of Yisrael, NAMELY THE FIRST MINISTER UNDER THE HOLY THRONE, Matatron, when the Shechinah was with the King, would come and go before them. THE SECOND MINISTER, NURIEL, would receive the worship of Yisrael to the Holy One, blessed be He, as fire (Aramaic nura). And when the fire was no more, because the children of Yisrael were exiled, Her light was gone, and the Shechinah departed from the King. 57. Rabbi Shimon opened the discussion saying: \"Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform to you the part of a kinsman, well (lit. 'good'); let him do the kinsman's part\" (Rut 3:13) RUT IS THE SECRET OF MALCHUT, WHICH IS JUDGMENT, AND GOOD IS MERCY. Rabbi Yosi said: Mercy is more powerful than Judgment. \"And Elohim saw the light, that it was good\" (Beresheet 1:4). Hence, goodness and light are equal, for it is the source of all the springs, whence the sea and all the rivers in the world come from. THE MEANING OF THE WORDS CONCERNING RUT ARE THAT IF HE WILL DO THE KINSMAN'S PART, GOOD, MEANING THAT MERCY CALLED GOOD WILL DO THE KINSMAN'S PART BY RUTH AND HAVE CONTROL OVER HER, WHO IS JUDGMENT. 58. We learned that Rabbi Shimon said: Once I went up and down to shine at the source of the springs. Rabbi Aba came up after me and said to me, With what are you occupied? I said to him: With the verse, \"All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full\" (Kohelet 1:7). From the light OF BINAH were created all the ministers in the world, and from its light flow all the rivers; NAMELY, \"the rivers\" in the verse, \"ALL THE RIVERS RUN INTO THE SEA; YET THE SEA IS NOT FULL.\" THE SEA, MALCHUT, is not full when in exile, because the darkness and obscurity IN THE EXILE were made by a mother's love, BINAH. And were it not FOR DARKNESS, the river would not have been created which shines unto the daughter, MALCHUT. The sea shall not be filled and made whole until the other side which was not in exile would have come; NAMELY THE RIGHT SIDE, UPON WHICH NO KLIPAH HAS EVER ANY CONTROL. THEN THE SEA, MALCHUT, WILL BE FILLED. 7. The names called hand Rabbi Elazar first explains that the hands belong to The Creator, the source of Light for everything, meaning mercy. He then begs Rabbi Shimon to reveal to him the secret of the name \"hand.\" Rabbi Shimon explains that without the \"hand,\" which is mercy, war would prevail, since judgment would be allowed to come before mercy. But the Mashiach will come and wage war against Amalek through judgment, and in it, prevail. Rabbi Elazar then explains that the \"the great hand\" and \"the supernal hand\" are the same thing. They have the same numerical value and therefore, will be the left and right hands joined together. Even though one is called \"great\" and the other \"strong,\" and therefore, must be different, they are equal by the name \"hand,\" because of their letters Yud-Dalet, and will therefore create the heaven and the earth. The Relevance of this Passage Many profound lessons and benefits arise from this passage, including a secret concerning the nation of Amalek. Kabbalists have revealed that the nation of Amalek is a code term that refers to the doubts and uncertainties that dwell within the consciousness of man. Specifically, these doubts concern the following: our recognition of the reality of The Creator; our trust in the spiritual laws of our universe; our willingness to embark on and remain on the correct spiritual path. Whenever we begin to approach these universal truths and come nearer to the Light, doubts automatically set in. Consciously waging war against uncertainty helps to hasten the arrival of our personal Mashiach, as well as the global redemption. Moreover, triumphing over our doubt helps to ignite the Light of mercy, which sweetens the Judgments due to us as a result of previous iniquities in this life or past incarnations. Hence, the strength to defeat skepticism is summoned forth herein and the Light of mercy shines brighter in our lives, helping to soften decrees of judgement that might be due us. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 59. The names called 'hand'-NAMELY THE HAND OF HASHEM, THE GREAT HAND, THE STRONG HAND-are the source OF LIGHT for everything. You will find only the hand of Yud-Hei-Vav-Hei, as in the verse \"the hand of Hashem is not shortened\" (Yeshayah 59:1), since 'hand' is always combined with the name YUD-HEI-VAV-HEI, WHICH IS MERCY. 60. Rabbi Elazar came to ask his father Rabbi Shimon. He wept and said to him: Reveal to me this secret, my father and master, OF THE NAME 'HAND'. He said to him: It will be revealed to you through the verse: \"Because Hashem has sworn by His throne (lit. 'a hand on the throne of Yah'); that Hashem will have war\" (Shemot 17:16), TO WIT, hand on the throne of Yah due to Yud-Hei-Vav-Hei, WHICH IS MERCY, Mercy being stronger than Judgment. The verse wishes to say, may there be forever, instead of Gvurah, the great hand which was in Egypt, WHICH IS MERCY; for were it not FOR THE GREAT HAND, WAR would be through Judgment WITHOUT MERCY. 61. When Mashiach will come with the renewal of the great hand, he will wage war against Amalek, MERCY WILL OVERCOME JUDGMENT LIKE AT THE EXODUS FROM EGYPT, AS IT IS WRITTEN \"By strength of hand Hashem brought us out of Egypt\" (Shemot 13:14). When the name hand is will come with 'strength of hand' alone, NOT WITH HASHEM'S HAND OR THE GREAT HAND, it is then in Judgment; namely war against Amalek will be fought through Judgment, and then Mashiach will come. Rabbi Elazar supports his explanation with the verse, \"Then shall Hashem go out, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle\" (Zecharyah 14:3). 62. Come and see: THE STRENGTH OF the great hand, THE RIGHT HAND, reaches the supernal hand, THE LEFT HAND CALLED THE STRONG HAND. By this hand, they came out of Egypt, AS IT SAYS, \"BY STRENGTH OF HAND HASHEM BROUGHT US OUT OF EGYPT.\" THEY ARE CONNECTED since they have the same numerical value, one Yud equals the other Yud and one Dalet the other (YUD-DALET = HAND). The name 'the great hand' and the name 'the supernal hand' are the same, equal in letters and numerical value. UNISON receives two hands together, IN OTHER WORDS, THE RIGHT AND LEFT WERE JOINED TOGETHER. 63. HE ASKS, Why were they not separated, as they are not equal, THE ONE IS CALLED GREAT AND THE OTHER STRONG. HE ANSWERS: The connection of these two was explained BECAUSE their letters, Yud-Dalet, which are the same, THOUGH they are not exactly of the same content. TO WIT, SINCE THEY ARE EQUAL BY THE NAME HAND, THEY MAY BE JOINED TOGETHER THOUGH THE ONE IS CALLED GREAT AND THE OTHER STRONG. From these TWO HANDS, the heaven and earth were created, and all that is with them. INSIDE THE UPPERMOST CIRCLE: Yud to Yud, Dalet to Dalet. INSIDE THE SECOND CIRCLE WITHIN THE UPPERMOST ONE, TO THE RIGHT OF THE CIRCLE: Yud to Yud, Vav to Vav, Dalet to Dalet; AND TO ITS LEFT: Dalet to Dalet, Lamed to Lamed, Tav to Tav. INSIDE THE THIRD CIRCLE, THAT IS WITHIN THE SECOND, TO THE RIGHT OF THE CIRCLE: Dalet to Dalet, Lamed to Lamed, Tav to Tav; AND TO ITS LEFT: Lamed to Lamed, Mem to Mem, Dalet to Dalet; Tav to Tav, Vav to Vav. IN THE CENTER OF THESE CIRCLES: Vav above; AND BELOW IT Yud-Hei, Yud-Hei, BELOW THEM Shadai, AND BELOW IT the Chariot of the fathers of Yisrael. They are the first Sfirah, NAMELY THE UPPER CIRCLE, which is sublime Keter, WHERE THE SIMPLE LETTERS ARE, WHICH IS THE SECRET OF KETER. We learned that \"The eyes of Hashem are in every place, watching the evil and the good\" (Mishlei 15:3). THE SECOND CIRCLE IS THE SECRET OF THAT VERSE; NAMELY THE SFIRAH CHOCHMAH, SINCE EYES ARE THE SECRET OF CHOCHMAH. HENCE, IT CONTAINS THE LETTERS OF THE LETTERS FULLY SPELLED OUT, WHICH IS THE SECRET OF CHOCHMAH. Third: IN THE THIRD CIRCLE, THERE IS THE SFIRAH BINAH, SINCE IN IT ARE "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" THE FULLY SPELLED OUT LETTERS OF THE FULLY SPELLED OUT LETTERS. They help AND POUR UPON Vav OF THE NAME YUD-HEI- VAV-HEI, WHICH IS ZEIR ANPIN, which performed many miracles in the land of Egypt. 8. \"...appeared to me at Luz\" Rabbi Aba explains that Luz is Jerusalem, namely Binah, which will give a blessing to Ya'akov and thereby ensure that the land will be given to his children. Rabbi Elazar further describes that the blessing will also ensure a pure land, and happy will be the portion of the land he will keep. Rabbi Elazar comments on circumcision, namely Yud, as being required in order to be called children of The Creator (holy children). Without it, as Rabbis Aba and Yosi point out, they will die without repentance, in this world and in the next. The Relevance of this Passage The awesome energy and Light that issues from the land of Yisrael, concentrated in the city of Jerusalem, is bestowed upon the reader. In addition, the power of purification, associated with the mystical Light aroused through circumcision, is imbued within our souls, helping to cleanse iniquities resulting from negative sexual behavior and adulterated thoughts. 64. \"And Ya'akov said to Yosef, 'El Shadai appeared to me at Luz in the land of Cna'an'\" (Beresheet 48:3). Rabbi Aba said: Luz is the Celestial Jerusalem, NAMELY BINAH, which puts the Shechinah to dwell with us. Supernal Ya'akov, ZEIR ANPIN, said to the lower YA'AKOV, BINAH blessed me, that it wants to increase you and give the land to your children. Luz, the Celestial Jerusalem, BINAH, WHICH IS the Holy One, blessed be He, gave a blessing which will be fulfilled in the Holy Land, but outside THE LAND, in another land, there shall be no blessing. 65. Rabbi Elazar opened the discussion saying: \"He that blesses a friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him\" (Mishlei 27:14). The Holy One, blessed be He, called Yisrael brothers and friends. THE MEANING OF THIS VERSE \"THAT BLESSES A FRIEND\" REFERS TO THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE, WHO BLESSES YISRAEL. HE ASKS: What did He bless them? HE REPLIES: That this nation will be pure under Him, and that He will watch over them. "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 66. Happy is the portion of this pure nation WHICH HE KEEPS, for they are called dear children more than the supernal beings, as it is written: \"You are the children of Hashem\" (Devarim 14:1), all for that reason. What is this reason? HE REPLIES: That the name SHADAI is completed by their impression, for they are circumcised. 67. Come and see: The Name of the Holy One, blessed be He, is in a man's face, NAMELY SHIN, but Yud is missing and thus it is not complete. When Avraham came and became dear to the Holy One, blessed be He, He said to him: 'In you shall this name be completed. He circumcised himself, and the name became complete through the Yud of circumcision. For Shin is found in a man's face; NAMELY, THE TWO EYES AND THE NOSE IN THE MIDDLE. IN HIS ARM, you find Dalet, and the Yud is missing, the Yud of circumcision completes it. Then they are called children of Hashem, holy children. 68. When the sign of the holy covenant is defiled and put into the dominion of the other, NAMELY BY TRANSGRESSION, the holiness of the seal is gone from him, and he is considered as if he ruined the world, for he has defiled the seal upon which the Name of the Holy One, blessed be He, is completed. Thus he ruins the world BY STOPPING THE BOUNTY OF THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE, FROM THE WORLD. 69. Rabbi Aba was walking from Cappadocia with Rabbi Yosi. While they were walking they saw a man there with a mark upon his face. Woe to the wicked, who will die without repentance, and the mark will not disappear, neither in this world nor in the World to Come. 9. \"Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you\" Rabbi Aba first explains that shame will not overcome Ya'akov, since he will keep his promise to his children, [Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you,] because to fail would be to invoke shame upon himself. The quotation is a blessing from God, meant to further ensure that Ya'akov will keep his promise. Rabbi Aba then ends by indicating that at the time of war against Amalek, only The Creator would go to fight. The Relevance of this Passage In truth, a man lacks the full power to overthrow the Satan, doubts and internal demons that dwell within him. Nonetheless, when a man willingly overcomes his doubt--known by the code word Amalek, The Creator will fight for him throughout his life, thus assuring a man's victory over the dark side and providing him with a life of fulfillment. This is precisely what occurs herein, as we peruse the letters of this passage with the consciousness and intent to eradicate our doubts and demons and allow The Creator to fight on our behalf. 70. \"...and said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you'\" (Beresheet 48:4). Rabbi Aba opened the discussion speaking in relation to the verse: \"Ya'akov shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now grow pale\" (Yeshayah 29:22). A man who promises good for another man will be ashamed not to keep his promise. How the more so is A PROMISE come to man from above. If he brings not the goodness to his children that he said he would, he will be ashamed. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 71. The Holy One, blessed be He, said TO YA'AKOV, \"Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you\" by this blessing given to Me FROM BINAH. And I will give this land to your children. Yet HIS CHILDREN are not in the land of Yisrael, nor is THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE, with them. THIS IS SUPPOSEDLY SHAMEFUL THAT HE PROMISES YET DOES NOT KEEP IT. But when Mashiach's end will come AND HIS PROMISE will be fulfilled, the Holy One, blessed be He, said: \"Ya'akov shall not now be ashamed.\" Now the face of supernal Ya'akov will not be put to shame, because of what he said \"and will give THIS LAND TO YOUR SEED AFTER YOU\" (Beresheet 48:4). For until now, he had naught in his hand to give them, and he was ashamed. Now his promise was kept before the Master of heaven and earth. 72. As we said, the war against Amalek will be by strength of hand alone when the end will come, for it is a day for battle, as is written: \"Then shall Hashem go out, and fight against those nations, AS WHEN HE FOUGHT IN THE DAY OF BATTLE,\" He Himself shall go out, and none other. 10. \"And now your two sons...who were born to you\" Rabbi Yosi opens the discussion with the saying that the two sons, Efraim and Menashe, are born to Yisrael into 'exile'. Vav will help Ya'akov at the time of redemption, and give his children a portion of the land. The aspect of Efraim refers to the children who were forgotten, and the aspect of Menashe to those he regards as his own. But Hashem will attend to both aspects and redeem them, taking them out of their land of exile. Rabbi Aba then says that when God executes judgment upon Egypt, Yisrael will be redeemed from exile. Rabbi Shimon next explains that God will make a Chupah (marriage canopy) for every righteous man in Jerusalem, as a means for the giving of the Torah and the building of the Temple. Yisrael will be born after the redemption of the fathers (Chariots). Rabbi Shimon finally explains that all children born in Jerusalem after the redemption, will go to Heaven, will have only Hebrew names, and will inherit the land according to their numbers. The Relevance of this Passage The blessings and wisdom contained herein are varied and abounding. Put briefly, we are all children of Ya'akov and our exile continues to this very day. However, when one earnestly turns to the path of Ya'akov, the Torah--the Light of the Upper World [the Hebrew letter Vav] will assist him in removing the Evil Inclination [Egypt], the underlying cause behind the continued exile. Furthermore, this passage awakens the entire world to the truth of the Torah and the power of Kabbalah and connects the reader to the redemptive Light emanating from the Land of Yisrael. Our personal and global redemption is therefore quickened. 73. \"And now your two sons...who were born to you\" (Beresheet 48:5): These are Yisrael below, who are in exile, the children of the Holy One, blessed be He, who are born among the nations. TO WIT, THE VERSE: \"YOUR TWO SONS, EFRAIM AND MENASHE, WHO WERE BORN TO YOU IN THE LAND OF EGYPT\" (IBID.) REFERS TO YISRAEL WHO ARE IN EXILE AMONG THE NATIONS. FOR EGYPT INCLUDES ALL EXILES. We learned, Rabbi Yosi said, that the children of Yisrael who will be in the Holy Land of Yisrael, dwelling in the land, at the coming of Mashiach, will be with their brothers in that place. For exile will be only for those who live in a foreign land, and they are called 'exiles'. 74. \"I remember my covenant with Ya'akov\" (Vayikra 26:42). The Vav OF YA'AKOV is superfluous, WHICH INDICATES that the Vav which was gone when the Temple was destroyed will help Ya'akov at the time OF REDEMPTION, and will be an everlasting possession for the holy son YA'AKOV, whose descendants shall live in the country in which they lived before, happy is their portion. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 75. The children who were exiled out of the land of Yisrael and were forgotten, THE ASPECT OF MENASHE, and multiplied AND INCREASED ACCORDING TO THE ASPECT OF EFRAIM: Supernal Ya'akov, ZEIR ANPIN, said to the one below, Your children who are out of the land of Yisrael, born in exile in other lands, before I came to Egypt and sentenced them for their sins, I do not consider to be your children those who were born in exile in a foreign land, though they be many, THE ASPECT OF EFRAIM, and forgotten, THE ASPECT OF MENASHE, they are my own CHILDREN. But when I saw them in this exile, I healed their pains and heard their prayers, Reuven, \"Surely Hashem has looked upon my affliction\" (Beresheet 29:32) and for Shimon, \"Because Hashem has heard that I was hated\" (Ibid. 33). THIS IS THE MEANING OF THE VERSE \"EFRAIM AND MENASHE\" WHO MULTIPLIED AND WERE FORGOTTEN IN EXILE \"AS REUVEN AND SHIMON THEY SHALL BE MINE,\" TO WIT, HE WILL SEE THEIR POVERTY, HEAR THEIR PRAYER AND REDEEM THEM, ACCORDING TO THE MEANING OF THE NAMES REUVEN AND SHIMON. Think of it as if they were before Me, and when we shall return from Egypt, WHICH INCLUDES ALL THE EXILES, after executing Judgment on them, we shall take them out of the land of their exile. 76. Rabbi Aba said: From this WE UNDERSTAND THAT AFTER HE WILL EXECUTE JUDGMENT UPON EGYPT, WHICH INCLUDES ALL THE NATIONS, YISRAEL WILL BE REDEEMED FROM EXILE, AS IT IS WRITTEN: \"And they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations for an offering to Hashem\" (Yeshayah 66:20). Scripture means that when the Holy One, blessed be He, will execute Judgment upon Egypt; NAMELY UPON ALL THE NATIONS WHICH THE EARLIER VERSE MENTIONED. At that time, all the nations will bring an offering when they hear about the Holy One, blessed be He, \"and all the nations shall flow to it\" (Yeshayah 2:2). 77. We learned that Rabbi Shimon said: The Holy One, blessed be He, will make for every righteous man a canopy in Jerusalem. It is written: \"the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride\" (Yirmeyah 16:9) when the Shechinah will return to the King and He will engage Her, as it is written: \"Go forth, O daughters of Tzion, and behold...on the day of his wedding, and on the day of the gladness of his heart\" (Shir Hashirim 2:11). \"The day of his wedding\" is the giving of the Torah, and \"the day of the gladness of his heart\" is the building of the Temple, may it be built soon in our days. 78. \"And your offspring, which you beget after them, shall be yours\" (Beresheet 48:6). This is Yisrael below, WHO WILL BE BORN AFTER THE REDEMPTION to the fathers, who are Chariots, and their names will be in the secret of those born AFTER REDEMPTION. They will be named after their brothers in their inheritance. 79. We learned that Rabbi Shimon said: \"And your issue (also: 'your homeland')\" is Terrestrial Jerusalem, NAMELY YOUR HOMELAND. FOR THE WORDS \"born at home\" (Vayikra 18:9) in relation to the portion concerning incest, refer to the Terrestrial Jerusalem. THE MEANING OF THE VERSE IS that people who will be born in that Jerusalem will not only return to their Master in heaven, but will also convert AFTER REDEMPTION. They will have only names of Yisrael, not according to their father, such as 'the proselyte of Cappadocia,' but a name of Yisrael. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 80. \"Shall be your\": THE VERSE means that they will have names of Yisrael, after their brothers in their inheritance. And when they return, they will inherit together with Yisrael in the country, and each tribe will take its own, AND ALSO for people of their own, CONVERTS. Each will inherit the land according to its numbers. 11. \"Rachel died by me on the way\" Rabbi Aba begins by explaining the discrepancy in the verb tense in \"they have come back,\" used in The Creator's promise for the future. Rabbi Aba then explains how Rabbi Elazar answers that the Shechinah will think her children have died by judgement. Only then will she return to her husband. \"Rachel weeping\" refers to the Shechinah being told by her husband that her children have perished. Only then will He tell her that her children have been redeemed. God then tells her that those who have died in the war will be resurrected. Rabbi Shimon tells us that the quotation refers to the Shechinah's children who die in the war, but are resurrected and will return to Efrat, the land of Yisrael. Rabbi Aba finally explains the meaning of Lechem, derived from Milchamah (war), and \"fought\" (lacham). The Relevance of this Passage Two paths to the final redemption lie before us: a path of destruction --war and death--and a path of mercy that offers us protection, the path of spiritual transformation. We have the free will to choose our fate. In the end, all the souls of mankind will be resurrected and the arrival of the Mashiach will bring immortality and endless fulfillment. The Light that radiates from this passage of Zohar awakens the wisdom to walk the path of spiritual transformation. It helps accelerate the arrival of the Resurrection and the Mashiach through the path of mercy for all mankind. 81. \"And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me.\" (Beresheet 48:7) Rabbi Aba opened the discussion, saying: \"A voice was heard in Rama\" (Yirmeyah 31:14) followed by: \"Thus says Hashem; Keep your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears: for your work shall be rewarded, says Hashem; and they shall (lit. 'they have') come back again to their own border\" (Ibid. 15). HE ASKS: It does not say 'They shall come back' IN THE FUTURE TENSE, but that they have come back. YET THIS IS A PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE, AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 'AND THEY SHALL COME BACK.' 82. HE ANSWERS: Come and see, Rabbi Elazar said that when there will be justice upon the mountain, and the Shechinah will be adorned on the mountain, She will think her children perished by Judgment. The secret is, \"Sing, O barren one, you that did not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud\" (Yeshayah 54:1). We have learned that many children of the throne will be Her own CHILDREN, as it is written: \"For more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife\" (Ibid.). The Shechinah will then return to Her husband. \"On that day Hashem shall be one, and His name One\" (Zecharyah 14:9). 83. Before that, the Shechinah will say to Her husband, Where are my children? He will say to Her that they were judged, and She will think they perished by judgment, and weeps for Her children, who perished by justice. THIS IS THE SECRET OF \"A VOICE WAS HEARD IN RAMA... RACHEL WEEPING FOR HER CHILDREN,\" AND HE WILL SAY TO HER, \"KEEP YOUR VOICE FROM WEEPING... FOR YOUR WORK SHALL BE REWARDED.\" For you are to be greatly rewarded by Me for being with them, and the children have already come back from the hated land, FOR THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN REDEEMED. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 84. HE ASKS: Did not Yosef know his mother died? Indeed, he was with her when she died. WHY DID YA'AKOV HAVE TO TELL HIM THAT? HE REPLIES: Supernal Yisrael said that when he prophesied about the redemption of Yisrael, the Shechinah will stir, and the Congregation of Yisrael will stir and wage war against the nations. Some OF YISRAEL will die IN THIS WAR. They will slowly approach the land of Yisrael. When She weeps FOR HER DEAD SONS, the Holy One, blessed be He, will say to Her, Do not be afraid, there is a reward for the sons who died IN THE WAR for My name's sake. The others, who did not die, have already returned and those who died will live again through the resurrection of the dead. 85. \"Rachel died by me.\" She died for the unity of the Name of the Holy One, blessed be He. TO WIT, HER SONS WHO WERE KILLED FOR THE SANCTIFICATION OF THE HOLY NAME. THE VERSE says of it: \"When yet there was but a little way\" (Beresheet 48:7), WHICH MEANS they died for the unity of the Name of the Holy One, blessed be He, outside the land of Yisrael, AT THE WAR FOR THE COMING TO YISRAEL. For in the land of Yisrael, none shall die. THEREFORE SCRIPTURE SAYS, \"WHEN YET THERE WAS BUT A LITTLE WAY TO COME TO EFRAT\" TO THE LAND OF YISRAEL, FOR AFTER COMING TO THE LAND OF YISRAEL THEY WILL DIE NO MORE. 86. We have learned that Rabbi Aba said: Yisrael will be engaged in war on the way to Efrat, and many of them will die. Then they will rise at the resurrection of the dead, and will have more power than those who reached Jerusalem before them, WHO DID NOT DIE IN THE WAR. 87. Why is this holy place called 'Lechem' (Eng. 'bread'), AS IT IS WRITTEN \"THAT IS BET LECHEM\"? (BERESHEET 48:7) HE ANSWERS: Since it is one of the Names of the Holy One, blessed be He, they will die there IN WAR for sanctifying His name, hand ON THE THRONE OF YAH. THIS MEANS they will die there TO MAKE COMPLETE the name Yah, WHICH SHALL NOT BE COMPLETE IN YUD-HEI-VAV-HEI UNTIL THE MEMORY OF AMALEK SHALL BE FORGOTTEN. THEREFORE THE PURPOSE OF THIS WAR IS TO COMPLETE THE NAME OF YUD-HEI WITH VAV-HEI. THUS THE PLACE IS CALLED LECHEM DERIVED FROM MILCHAMAH (WAR), for it fought (lacham) in exile to render complete the Name of the Holy One, blessed be He. 12. \"And Yisrael beheld Yosef's sons\" Rabbi Aba explains that lower Yisrael will be joined with the children of Yisrael into a great crowd, at which point they will all be circumcised and converted. Together, they will then return to their country with love for each other, and only then, \"The Creator shall be one.\" Rabbi Shimon next explains that sores on the skin of the people of Yisrael represent the borders that will separate them from the others in their new land. The Relevance of this Passage The universal truth of the Torah and the spiritual power of the Zohar are awakened within the souls of all mankind, facilitating the objective of global unity. The purifying Light that shines and cleanses during circumcision helps refine our souls and purge the Evil Inclination, associated negative sexual behavior, from the souls of all mankind. As well, the arrival of the final redemption is accelerated and our commitment to the path of Torah is strengthened. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 88. \"And Yisrael beheld Yosef's sons, and said, 'Who are these?'\" (Beresheet 48:8) Rabbi Aba opened the discussion with the verse, \"Then shall you say in your heart, 'Who has begotten me these'\" (Yeshayah 49:21). HE ASKS: What does scripture mean by that? HE ANSWERS: Lower Yisrael saw that the children of Yisrael will come before Him, when they will come \"from Elam and from Shin'ar and from Chamat and from the islands of the sea\" (Ibid. 11:11), they will all gather into a great number. The Shechinah will say, Who are all these, are there not any who are unfit, of foreign children? They will say to Him, we are all Your children, there is no foreigner among us. For they will be separated the one from the other, THE MOTLEY CROWD WILL BE SEPARATED FROM YISRAEL, and they will be circumcised together and converted. The proselyte then will return together with Yisrael and they will be together. 89. We have learned that proselytes are as bad to Yisrael as a sore on the skin. It is written, \"For Hashem will have Mercy on Ya'akov, and will yet choose Yisrael, and set them in their own land: and the stranger shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Ya'akov \" (Ibid. 14:1). When the children will return to their country and there will be love among them, then \"Hashem shall be one, and His name One\" (Zecharyah 14:9). The proselyte will then cleave to the people of Yisrael and will be like a sore on their skin. 90. HE ASKS: Why are they LIKE A SORE ON THE SKIN? HE SAYS, come and hearken, Rabbi Shimon said that IT REFERS TO the borders of the country, for every one will want to live in the land of Yisrael, and the people OUTSIDE ITS BORDERS will be afraid. HENCE it is written: \"And let them stretch forth the curtains of your habitations\" (Yeshayah 54:2). The verse implies that the curtains you had before FROM THE TIME OF EXILE should be stretched and fortified more than those of the other nations so to speak, whom you saw strengthening them, when you were with the other nations; NAMELY IN EXILE AMONG THE NATIONS. AND THE PROSELYTES shall be many. 13. \"Whom Hashem has given me\" Rabbi Shimon first describes how the Torah (zeh) is set before the children of Yisrael. Rabbi Rav Nachman then explains the difference between zeh and zot, pointing out that the Torah is referred to as \"Tor,\" in the feminine, which is a name of a dove--meaning \"the time of the singing bird is come,\" sung by the Levites, which is the secret of the female aspect of the Torah--the turtle being the secret of the male aspect. Rabbi Rav Nachman then explains that Hei (holiness) ? is more important than Aleph ?. Next, Rabbi Aba tells us how the measurement of the span of God is 670 years, from heaven to earth. Rabbi Aba concludes by explaining why the Torah is called Zeh. The Relevance of this Passage All reality consists of both male and female energies. When these two polar opposites are united, Light flows and shines upon supernal and corporeal worlds. Our physical world of Malchut embodies female energy, while the Upper Realm of Zeir Anpin corresponds to male. This passage enjoins the two worlds, allowing the resplendent Light of The Creator to vanquish all forms of darkness dwelling in our midst. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 91. \"And Yosef said to his father, 'They are my sons, whom Elohim has given me in this here (Heb. zeh macs.)'.\" (Beresheet 48:9) Rabbi Shimon explained in relation to this the verse: \"And that (Heb. zot fem.) is the Torah which Moshe set before the children of Yisrael\" (Devarim 4:44). When lower Yisrael -WHO ARE CALLED YOSEF- said: When Supernal Yisrael is high above them, \"They are my children,\" for the Holy One, blessed be He, gave me the Torah CALLED ZEH (ENG. 'THIS'). THEREFORE SCRIPTURE SAYS \"IN THIS (HEB. ZEH).\" Behold YISRAEL AND their true laws, according to the laws of the Torah which were given them. Come and see: When Yisrael will shelter under the wings of the Shechinah, the Torah is called 'zeh,' as in \"this (zeh) is my El, and I will praise Him\" (Shemot 15:2). THIS IS ALSO THE MEANING OF THE VERSE \"WHOM ELOHIM HAS GIVEN ME IN THIS,\" WHICH IS THE TORAH. But as long as David was not speaking from under the wings of the Shechinah, but prophesied that which will be, THE TORAH is called zot (Eng. 'this', fem.), AS IN \"AND THAT (HEB. ZOT) IS THE TORAH.\" 92. Rav Nachman said: From this, WE UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 'ZEH' AND 'ZOT', AS IT IS WRITTEN: \"Though a host should camp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, even then I will be confident (lit. 'in zot')\" (Tehilim 27:4), zot (Eng. 'this') being the Torah when Mashiach will come, WHEN THE TORAH SHALL BE REVEALED. It is therefore written: \"And the voice of the turtledove (Heb. tor) is heard in our land\" (Shir Hashirim 2:12) IN THE MASCULINE, INSTEAD OF TORAH, WHICH IS THE FEMININE. TOR IS A NAME OF A DOVE. Why was Torah likened to a dove? Because its voice is sweet like that of a dove. This voice will resound when Mashiach will come at Judgment Day; NAMELY BEFORE REDEMPTION, WHEN MASHIACH WILL EXECUTE JUDGMENT AND WAGE WAR AGAINST THE NATIONS WHICH ENSLAVE YISRAEL. YET IT IS NOT YET THE TIME TO REVEAL THE TORAH. IT IS THEREFORE CALLED 'TOR' IN THE MASCULINE, AND ZEH ('THIS', MASC.). 93. We learned: \"The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing bird is come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.\" (Ibid.). The flowers are the patriarchs of the Chariot, AVRAHAM, YITZCHAK, AND YA'AKOV, who will rise in the world and will be seen IN THE LAND. 94. \"The time of the singing bird is come,\" that is, the singing that will be sung by the Levites when they return to their worship of yore. \"The voice of the turtledove\" IS THE SECRET OF THE VERSE \"whom Elohim has given me in this (Heb. bazeh).\" THIS REFERS TO THE SECRET OF THE TORAH IN ITS MALE ASPECT, CALLED 'ZEH', WHICH IS ALLUDED TO IN THE VERSE \"WHOM ELOHIM HAS GIVEN ME IN THIS (HEB. BAZEH).\" These are the words of the Torah which are pleasant as the voice of the turtledove, Zeh. "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 95. HE ASKS: What does this mean? HE ANSWERS: The secret of this matter is that when the children of Yisrael are not sheltered under the wings of the Shechinah, the Aleph of 'zot' descends beneath all THE GRADES, and the Hei of \"zeh (this) my El, and I will praise Him\" departs. Since the Temple was ruined, the Hei could not dwell among the idolatrous nations and the Holy Hei was separated from the Name. When the children of Yisrael will return to their country, the Holy Hei, which was cut from the Name of the Holy One, blessed be He, shall return to 'zeh' and come out of the Day of Judgment, while the Aleph will be mended AND COME BACK TO 'ZOT'. HE ASKS: WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT, Hei or Aleph? HE ANSWERS: Hei is more important with respect to holiness, and Aleph is more important with respect to the letters. 96. Rabbi Aba opened the discussion with the verse: \"Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span?\" (Yeshayah 40:12). 'Zeh (Heb. Zayin-Hei)' and the turtledove (Tav-Vav-Resh) are supposedly alike; NAMELY, THEY JOIN TOGETHER. Zayin OF ZEH joins Resh OF TOR, the Resh OF TOR joins the Tav OF TOR, and from this comes the combination of Zeret (Eng. 'span'). VAV OF TOR IS ATTACHED TO HEI OF ZEH, TO FORM VAV-HEI OF THE NAME OF YUD-HEI-VAV-HEI-ZEIR AND HIS NUKVA. The measurement of the span of the Holy One, blessed be He, is 670 years, from heaven (ZEIR ANPIN) to earth (THE NUKVA). HE ASKS: How can this be? HE SAYS: Zeh-tor HAS TWO PERMUTATIONS: 1) Zeret-Vav-Hei 2) Hei-Vav-Terez, in which Hei OF ZEH comes before Vav OF TOR. Hei OF ZEH precedes Vav OF TOR, THE PRECEDENCE OF HEI ALLUDES TO BINAH, WHICH POURS ABUNDANCE UPON ZEIR ANPIN, WHICH IS THE VAV. The Vav before the Tav OF TOR and Tav before Resh OF TOR and Resh OF TOR before Zayin OF ZEH: THIS IS THE PERMUTATION OF HEI-VAV- TEREZ, THE SECRET OF 670 YEARS FROM HEAVEN TO EARTH. \"Foursquare it shall be, being doubled; a span shall be its length, and a span shall be the breadth of it\" (Shemot 28:26). 97. \"And he said: Bring them, I pray you, to me, and I will bless them.\" (Beresheet 48:9). He says, Since they study the Torah, AS SAID \"WHOM ELOHIM HAS GIVEN ME IN THIS (ZEH),\" which is the Torah, AND THE ATTRIBUTE Zeh IS BETWEEN THEM, I will bless them. 98. This is the secret of the words, \"And he said to him, 'What is your name?' And he said: 'Ya'akov'\" (Beresheet 32:28): THE NAME YA'AKOV IS OF SMALLNESS WITHOUT MOCHIN. IT IS THEN WRITTEN, \"And he said: 'Why is it that you ask after my name?'\" (Ibid. 30). HE SAID TO HIM: What is it, WHY DO YOU ASK FOR MY NAME, A NAME BEING UNDERSTANDING? Yet in the former verse, YOU SAID THAT YOUR NAME IS YA'AKOV, WHICH MEANS A LITTLE IS ENOUGH FOR YOU, AND YOU DO NOT WISH TO ATTAIN AND KNOW THE NAME. Like we explained elsewhere. There is another secret IN THIS VERSE, \"And Ya'akov asked him... And he said: 'Why is it (Zeh) that you ask after my name?' And he blessed him there.\" That is, he said to him that he will bless him due to Zeh. "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 99. We learned a great mystery from this verse, but I have come before you only to teach you the verse I just spoke of, saying that the Torah is called Zeh. It is also written: \"That (Zeh) Sinai before Hashem the Elohim of Yisrael\" (Shoftim 5:5), SINAI BEING THE TORAH GIVEN ON SINAI. ALSO, when the Torah was given by Moshe, IT WAS SAID OF HIM, \"This (Zeh) man Moshe\" (Shemot 32:1), and also \"this is my El, and I will praise him,\" WHICH MEANS the Torah CALLED ZEH descended before the Elohim of Yisrael. THEN THEY SAID: \"THIS IS MY EL...\" 14. \"Now the eyes of Yisrael were dim from age\" Rabbi Chizkiyah first explains that this language is from lower Yisrael, since none of it is found in the Torah. Since the exiles did not follow the rules of the Torah, they became old and weak. Rabbi Chiya then says that when the exiles return to their land, God will invest them with His spirit. Rabbi Aba goes on to explain the meaning of \"dim\" as referring to the length in which the exiles lived without \"light.\" Rabbi Aba then answers the question of why the Torah speaks in the language and names of men. The Relevance of this Passage Here we are connected to the divine language of the Torah, whose letters are the bridge between the Upper and Lower Worlds. The words of the Torah are like cables that carry spiritual current from the supernal realm into the material dimension. The energy that flows between these two worlds helps us expedite the end of both our personal exile and the global one. This Light illuminates for us the importance of spiritual transformation through the path of Torah and strengthens our commitment to it. 100. \"Now the eyes of Yisrael were dim from age.\" (Beresheet 48:19). Rabbi Chizkiyah taught that this is lower Yisrael, for such language is not found THROUGH THE WHOLE TORAH. For when YISRAEL will be in exile all the days of destruction, they will become old with age, and will not be able to behold the face of the Shechinah until another spirit will come upon them. 101. HE EXPLAINS FURTHER that they were defiled among the nations IN EXILE, and did not follow the laws of the Torah as they should have. They sat a long while among the gentiles, generation after generation, and learned their ways, AS IT IS WRITTEN \"BUT WERE MINGLED AMONG THE NATIONS, AND LEARNED THEIR WORKS\" (TEHILIM 106:35). When they will return to their land, they will not at first be able to behold the face of the Shechinah until the Holy One, blessed be He, will invest them with His spirit. 102. Rabbi Chiya opened the discussion saying: \"And I will put My spirit within you\" (Yechezkel 36:27). Then he said: \"And cause you to follow My statutes, and you shall keep My judgments, and do them\" (Ibid.). For after I will put My spirit within you, and holiness, you shall follow My rules and go by them. 103. \"So that he could not see\" (Beresheet 48:10): Rabbi Aba opened the discussion saying: \"In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favor is as a cloud bringing the spring rain\" (Mishlei 16:15). For when they will receive the face of the Shechinah of the Holy One, blessed be He, and be occupied with the Chariots, by which the world endures; NAMELY THE LIVNG CREATURES WHICH CARRY THE CHARIOT (YECHEZKEL CHAPTER 1), THEN IT WILL BE SAID OF THEM \"IN THE LIGHT OF THE KING'S COUNTENANCE IS LIFE...\" "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 104. Come and see: You shall not find in the language of the whole scripture IN THE PORTION OF VAYECHI but words which talk of men, and no verses which speak of the Holy One, blessed be He. TO WIT, THOUGH THEY SPEAK OF REDEMPTION, WHEN YA'AKOV IS MENTIONED, IT REFERS TO SUPERNAL YA'AKOV OR SUPERNAL YISRAEL; NAMELY THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE. WHY DOES SCRIPTURE SPEAK IN THE LANGUAGE AND NAMES OF MEN? HE ANSWERS: For when they will return to their land, and the Holy One, blessed be He, will put upon them the spirit of Wisdom, they will always speak of the Holy One, blessed be He, as it says, \"My tongue also shall tell of your righteousness\" (Tehilim 71:24). End of Sitrei Torah 15. \"And Ya'akov lived,\" part two Rabbi Chiya opens the discussion by saying that God called the children of Yisrael \"righteous\" and that they will be happy in the world to come because they cleaved to His body (the Central Column). Rabbi Yitzchak then explains that the land they shall inherit will be supernal, meaning the Malchut. Then, we learn, they will surely inherit the Shechinah, the land of the living. The secret of the Malchut is that the land is one of planting, referring in scripture to God planting when He created the universe. The children of Yisrael will thus inherit the land forever. Rabbis Ya'akov and Yehuda next explain why there is no space in the Torah between the portion of Vayigash and the beginning of the portion of Vayechi. Rabbi Shimon tells us that there are no spaces between the two verses separating \"And Ya'akov lived\" to indicate that Yisrael and his children lived in luxury like kings. Rabbi Shimon goes on to explain the importance of seventeen years, because Ya'akov was sorrowful all his life, but the beauty of Yosef upon first seeing him, reminded Ya'akov of his wife Rachel, and all his sorrow fell away. But when Yosef, being seventeen, was separated from Ya'akov, we learn, his sorrow returned. Therefore, Ya'akov lived in Egypt \"for seventeen years.\" Rabbi Elazar next tells us why the word \"play\" is mentioned three times in the verse; it refers to the three Columns. Rabbi Aba explains the three Columns as south, north, and east. From them come the three worlds: The Right Column is called \"south,\" the Left Column \"north,\" the Central Column \"east.\" Rabbi Shimon concludes by pointing out that \"Your fathers\" refers to three: Avraham, Yitzchak, and Ya'akov. The Relevance of this Passage The power of the three Column System lies at the heart of this passage. The three Columns refer to the following behavioral traits: Right Column signifies a man's desire to share, the God-like nature of his soul. Left Column refers to the covetous desire of receiving for the self alone, the insatiable impulses of the ego. The crucial Central Column correlates to a man's free will to resist his selfish desires and instead, choose the truthful longings lingering in his soul, which include unconditional sharing. When a man integrates these three Columns into his life in a spiritually balanced way, he creates a circuit of energy igniting profound Light in his life. The patriarchs, Avraham, Yitzchak, and Ya'akov, were the Vessels and template that established these three Columns in our physical world by virtue of their deeds throughout their lifetimes. Upon their merit and through the mention of their names in this passage, we can draw upon their respective strength and wisdom to manage these three traits in a fashion that will bring forth spiritual luxuries into our own lives. 105. \"And Ya'akov lived.\" Rabbi Chiya opened the discussion saying: \"Your people also shall be all righteous...they shall inherit the land forever\" (Yeshayah 60:21). Happy are Yisrael of all the other idolatrous nations, for the Holy One, blessed be He, called them righteous, so they may receive the inheritance of the World to Come, and to delight in that world, as it is written: \"Then shall you delight yourself in Hashem\" (Ibid. 58:14). For what reason? Because YISRAEL cleaved to the body of the King; NAMELY THE CENTRAL COLUMN, as it is written \"But you that did cleave of Hashem your Elohim are alive every one of you this day\" (Devarim 4:4). 106. Rabbi Yitzchak opened the discussion saying: \"Your people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever.\" This verse is a sublime mystery among the reapers of the field, TO WIT, THOSE WHO MERITED TO RECEIVE THE FRUIT OF THEIR LABOR IN THE SUPERNAL FIELD, THE NUKVA. For we have learned that among the secrets of the Agada, Rabbi Shimon taught about the possession of the supernal inheritance of the land, WHICH IS THE NUKVA. No one inherits it save the one called righteous, for the Nukva cleaves to him in order to sweeten THE BITTER JUDGMENTS IN HER. The righteous then surely inherits the Shechinah. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 107. Here too, in His love for Yisrael, the Holy One, blessed be He, said: \"Your people also shall be all righteous,\" for which reason \"they shall inherit the land for ever.\" For they are worthy of inheriting the Shechinah, AS THE RIGHTEOUS INHERITS THE SHECHINAH. Wherefore are the children of Yisrael called righteous, and wherefore do they inherit the Shechinah? Because they are circumcised, and as we learned, whoever is circumcised and enters this possession, NAMELY THE SHECHINAH, whoever keeps the covenant, enters and cleaves to the body of the King, HE BECOMES A CHARIOT TO ZEIR ANPIN, and enters the righteous, BY BECOMING A CHARIOT TO YESOD. Hence, the children of Yisrael are called righteous and \"they shall inherit the land for ever.\" What is this land? It is the land of the living, NAMELY THE SHECHINAH. 108. Scripture repeats, \"The branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified\" (Yeshayah 60:21). \"The branch of my planting\" is one of the branches the Holy One, blessed be He, planted when He created the universe, as it is written: \"And Hashem Elohim planted a garden eastward in Eden\" (Beresheet 2:8). This land is one of the planting, THE SECRET OF THE NUKVA. Therefore scripture says, \"The branch of My planting, the work of My hands, that I may be glorified.\" 109. According to another explanation, \"Your people also shall be all righteous\": are Ya'akov and his children, who went down to Egypt among a stiff-necked nation, and they all remained righteous. Therefore scripture says OF THEM that \"they shall inherit the land for ever\" because they went up to inherit the Holy Land from EGYPT. 110. \"And Ya'akov lived in the land of Egypt.\" HE ASKS: Why is this portion closed, THERE BEING NO SPACE AT ALL IN THE TORAH BETWEEN THE END OF VAYIGASH AND THE BEGINNING OF THE PORTION OF VAYECHI? Rabbi Ya'akov said: When Ya'akov died, Yisrael's eyes were closed. Rabbi Yehuda said: Then, AFTER THE DEATH OF YA'AKOV, they descended into exile, and THE EGYPTIANS enslaved YISRAEL. 111. Rabbi Shimon said: It is written above, \"And Yisrael dwelt in the land of Egypt in the country of Goshen; and they took possession of it, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly\" (Beresheet 47:27), WHICH MEANS THEY LIVED IN LUXURY LIKE KINGS. THE VERSE IS FOLLOWED BY, \"And Ya'akov lived,\" WITHOUT ANY SPACE BETWEEN THE VERSES. THIS INDICATES that we should not separate the two VERSES. As YISRAEL lived in luxury and had pleasures and were short of nothing, so did Ya'akov live in luxury and pleasure. Therefore, THE VERSES are not separated. 112. Here IN EGYPT, it is considered that \"Ya'akov lived\" FOR IT WAS CONSIDERED LIFE FOR HIM. It was not said of him: 'Ya'akov lived' all his life, for his life was that of sorrow. Of him it is written, \"I had no repose\" IN LAVAN'S HOUSE, \"nor had I rest\" FROM ESAV, \"nor was I quiet\" BECAUSE OF DINAH AND SHCHEM; \"yet trouble came\" OF SELLING YOSEF (Iyov 3:26). But after he went down to Egypt, it is said of him \"And lived.\" He saw his son a king, he saw all his sons pure and righteous, living in pleasure and luxury, and he dwelling in their midst as good wine resting on its lees. Then it is said: \"And Ya'akov lived.\" THEREFORE, there is no separation, NO SPACE, between \"And grew and multiplies exceedingly\" and \"And Ya'akov lived,\" and so it should be, THE ONE BEING THE CONTINUANCE OF THE OTHER. "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 113. \"Seventeen years\": HE ASKS: Why seventeen years? HE ANSWERS: Rabbi Shimon said that Ya'akov was sorrowful all his life, and his days passed in sorrow in the beginning. When he saw Yosef standing before him, Ya'akov looked at Yosef and his soul was made whole as if he saw Yosef's mother. For the beauty of Yosef resembled that of Rachel, and it seemed to him as if he had never known sorrow. 114. When Yosef departed from him, it came to pass that \"I had no repose, nor had I rest, nor was I quiet; yet trouble came.\" For this trouble was harder to Ya'akov than everything that came over him. When Yosef was separated from him, it is said: \"Yosef being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock\" (Beresheet 37:2). All his days, Ya'akov had no such sorrow. He used to weep every day for the seventeen years of Yosef. 115. They replied to him from heaven, \"And Yosef shall put his hand on your eyes\" (Beresheet 46:4). Here are other seventeen years for you: in pleasure and delight, luxury and lack for nothing, This is the meaning of: \"And Ya'akov lived in the land of Egypt for seventeen years.\" (Beresheet 47:28). Come and see: The Shechinah of the glory of the Holy One, blessed be He, was with him all those years, for which reason ALL THOSE YEARS IN EGYPT are called 'Life'. 116. Come and see, it is written: \"The spirit of Ya'akov their father revived.\" From this we understand that his spirit was dead earlier, and also he had no intention of drawing and receiving another spirit, as the Supernal Spirit does not dwell on an empty place. Rabbi Yosi said: The Shechinah dwells only in a whole spot, not in a place of deficiency or sadness, but a proper place, a place of joy. Therefore, the Shechinah did not rest upon him for all the years that Yosef had been separated from his father and Ya'akov was in sadness. 117. We learned that Rabbi Elazar said that Rabbi Aba said: It is written, \"Serve Hashem with gladness; come before His presence with singing\" (Tehilim 100:2). The verse teaches us that the service of the Holy One, blessed be He, should only be performed through joyfulness, as said Rabbi Elazar, that the Shechinah does not dwell upon sadness. It is written, \"But now bring me a minstrel (player). And it came to pass, when the minstrel (player) played\" (II Melachim 3:15): HE ASKS: For what reason is the word 'play' mentioned three times IN THIS VERSE? HE ANSWERS: In order to awaken the spirit from the source of wholeness, ZEIR ANPIN WHICH INCLUDES THE THREE COLUMNS, the whole spirit. THREE TIMES 'PLAY' CORRESPONDS TO ITS THREE COLUMNS. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 118. Rabbi Aba said: We have learned that everything is to be found in the four winds: THE THREE COLUMNS OF ZEIR ANPIN, CALLED SOUTH, NORTH, EAST; AND THE SHECHINAH WHICH RECEIVES THE THREE COLUMNS IS THE SECRET OF THE WEST WIND. FROM THEM COME OUT THE THREE WORLDS: BRIYAH, YETZIRAH, ASIYAH AND EVERYTHING THAT IS IN THEM. All the roots of the upper and lower worlds hold on to them. We have learned that the one enters AND SHINES, NAMELY THE RIGHT COLUMN CALLED SOUTH, and the other comes out BUT DOES NOT SHINE; NAMELY THE LEFT COLUMN CALLED NORTH, WHICH DOES NOT SHINE WITHOUT THE RIGHT COLUMN. Another one is closed, TO WIT, THE CENTRAL COLUMN CALLED EAST, WHICH SHINES ONLY BY COVERED CHASSADIM, BEFORE HIS MATING WITH THE NUKVA, and the other one revealed; NAMELY THE NUKVA, WHICH SHINES BY UNCOVERED CHASSADIM AT THE TIME OF UNION WITH ZEIR ANPIN. SHE IS CALLED THE WEST WIND. All THE WINDS join one another; NAMELY THEY ARE INCLUDED BY ONE ANOTHER, THEN they become the fathers of everything FOR ALL REALITY, BRIYAH, YETZIRAH, AND ASIYAH, ARE DRAWN AND BORN OF THEM. 119. Rabbi Shimon said: \"Hashem took delight only in your fathers\" (Devarim 10:15). \"Your fathers\" are exactly three, NAMELY AVRAHAM, YITZCHAK, YA'AKOV. It is written \"only\" meaning THERE IS NO MORE THAN THESE THREE. From them are branched out and cleave to them all the others, THE GRADES OF BRIYAH, YETZIRAH, AND ASIYAH, who go up TO MAYIN NUKVIN, TO MALE AND FEMALE, to adorn the name; NAMELY TO DRAW NEW MOCHIN UPON THE NUKVA, WHICH IS CALLED NAME. 16. Two camels Rabbi Yosi starts by saying that the springs of wisdom were stopped when Rabbi Shimon died. He then explains how Rabbi Yehuda failed to fulfill the words of the verse when he came upon bundles of woolen clothes, which had fallen off two camels and were being attacked by birds. A man walks by and points out his failure to drive the birds away. Rabbi Yosi then explains Rabbi Yehuda's subsequent dream, and that when he woke up, he knew Rabbi Shimon's death caused wisdom to depart from the earth. Rabbi Aba then reveals that manna is the secrets of the Torah, but they are \"to be kept,\" which means hidden. The Relevance of this Passage When a great soul departs this physical existence, the full measure of spiritual Light revealed though his lifelong deeds, is awakened each year on the day of his passing. Rabbi Shimon's deeds included the revelation of the Zohar, the mystical secrets of the Torah and soul of the universe. Thus, the brightest of all Lights shines forth in this passage at the mention of Rabbi Shimon's leaving this world. This Light helps to strengthen our connection to the Zohar, Rabbi Shimon, and the hidden Light of the Torah. 120. We learned that Rabbi Yosi said: Since Rabbi Shimon left the cave, nothing was concealed from the friends. They would behold supernal mysteries, which were revealed to them, as if they were given on Mount Sinai at that hour. After RABBI SHIMON died, it is written: \"The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped\" (Beresheet 8:2). TO WIT, THE SPRINGS OF WISDOM WERE STOPPED. The friends contemplated these matters but did not understand their secrets. 121. For one day, Rabbi Yehuda sat at the gate of Tiberias. He saw two camels laden with BUNDLES OF expensive woolen clothes. The load fell, and birds came TO WHERE IT WOULD FALL. But the birds were torn before the clothes reached it. "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 122. After that, other birds came on THE TORN BIRDS. They sat upon the rock and were not torn. They shouted AT THE BIRDS, TO REMOVE THEM FROM THE TORN BIRDS, but they would not go. They heard a voice saying that the crown upon the crowns dwells in darkness, and its master is outside. 123. While RABBI YEHUDA was sitting, a man passed by and looked AT THE BIRDS. He said: This man did not fulfill the words of the verse: \"And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Avram drove them away\" (Beresheet 15:11). Rabbi Yehuda said: But I tried TO MAKE THE BIRDS GO AWAY FROM THEM BY SHOUTING AT THEM, but they would not go. The man turned his head TO RABBI YEHUDA and said: He did not yet pluck the hair of his master, nor did he shear the lady. RABBI YEHUDA DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANT. He ran after him three miles AND BEGGED HIM TO EXPLAIN what he said, but he did not. Rabbi Yehuda was grieved. 124. One day RABBI YEHUDA slept under a tree. In his dream he saw four wings prepared and Rabbi Shimon mounting upon them with a book of the Torah. He left no book of sublime mysteries and Aggada, but took all with him to heaven. He saw them hidden from his eyes, never to be revealed again. 125. When he woke up he said: Assuredly, when Rabbi Shimon died, Wisdom departed from the earth. Woe to the generation, from which the precious stone they held on to, which was the support of the upper and the lower, was gone. 126. He came before Rabbi Aba and told him. Rabbi Aba raised his hands to his head and wept. He said: A mill to grind good manna every day; NAMELY REVEALING THE SECRETS OF THE TORAH, CALLED MANNA. It is gathered, as it is written: \"He that gathered least gathered a quantity of ten homer\" (Bemidbar 11:32). Now the mill and the manna are gone, and nothing remained of it in the world, save as it is written: \"Take a jar, and put an omer full of manna in it, and lay it up before Hashem, to be kept for your generations\" (Shemot 16:33). It does not say 'in an open place' but \"to be kept,\" which means to be put in a hidden place. Who could now reveal secrets? Who even knows them? 127. RABBI ABA whispered to Rabbi Yehuda, saying: Surely the man you saw was Eliyahu. He did not agree to reveal secrets to you, so that you may realize the worth of Rabbi Shimon, who lived in your days, and the generation will weep for him. RABBI ABA said to him: We should indeed mourn him. "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 128. Rabbi Yehuda wept for him every day, for he was with him, RABBI SHIMON, at the holy assembly of Rabbi Shimon with the other friends. He said TO RABBI ABA, Woe is me that I was not gone at the holy assembly that day with the three who were gone, RABBI YOSI THE SON OF RABBI YA'AKOV, RABBI CHIZKIYAH, AND RABBI YISA, instead of beholding this generation that is changed. 17. \"The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine\" Rabbi Yehuda begins by explaining to Rabbi Aba that the verse, \"The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,\" means, in other words, that \"the heavens are the heavens of The Creator.\" He then explains the importance of the holy garments, which are Aba and Ima. The high priest above is Aba, and the one below, Ima. They are the secret of the Malchut of Zeir Anpin. The Relevance of this Passage When the energies of male and female unite, spiritual energy is free to flow throughout all the worlds. By revealing the secrets of the holy garments which are Aba [Male] and Ima [Female], the Zohar, is in effect, linking the Upper [Male] and Lower [Female] Worlds. Thus, the dazzling heavenly Light of The Creator gleams throughout our world, removing all forms of darkness from our lives. This splendid occurrence takes place the moment our eyes fall upon the mystical texts that reveal these supernal secrets. 129. RABBI YEHUDA said to RABBI ABA, Tell me Rabbi, it is written: \"And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen\" (Shemot 28:5), yet silver is not mentioned. But AT THE OFFERING FOR THE TABERNACLE it says \"gold and silver\" (Shemot 25:3); brass too is not mentioned, though both silver and brass were counted AS AN OFFERING FOR THE TABERNACLE. Here, IN RELATION TO THE VESTMENTS OF THE HIGH PRIEST they are not mentioned. But if the sacred lamp, NAMELY RABBI SHIMON, did not reveal this mystery when it was discussed, I MYSELF should not reveal either. 130. RABBI ABA opened with: \"The silver is Mine, and the gold is mine,' says Hashem\" (Chagai 2:8) as it says in the verse, \"The heavens are the heavens of Hashem\" (Tehilim 115:16). 131. I have looked at the vessels of the sanctuary in several places; NAMELY THE RAIMENTS OF THE HIGH PRIEST, as it is written: \"These are holy garments\" (Vayikra 16:4) \"and they shall make holy garments\" (Shemot 28:4). HE ASKS: What holiness is there TO THE GARMENTS OF THE HIGH PRIEST? HE SAYS, We have learned that in all of these places THAT ARE MENTIONED there is holiness. NAMELY, \"these are holy garments,\" \"and they shall make holy garments,\" WHICH MEAN they resemble the ones above; TO WIT, ABA AND IMA WHICH ARE CALLED HOLY, FOR THE HIGH PRIEST CORRESPONDS TO SUPERNAL ABA, AND HIS GARMENTS ARE THEREFORE CALLED HOLY GARMENTS, AS WAS SAID. 132. For we have learned that there is a High Priest above, ABA, and a high priest below, WHO CORRESPONDS TO HIM. Therefore, the holy raiments OF ABA above CORRESPOND TO the holy raiment OF THE HIGH PRIEST below. HENCE, AS ABA IS THE SECRET OF HOLINESS SO IS THE HIGH PRIEST HOLY; AS THE RAIMENTS OF HONOR OF ABA ARE HOLY GARMENTS SO ARE THOSE OF THE HIGH IN RELATION TO THE GARMENTS OF THE HIGH PRIEST PRIEST. Thus, the verse does not mention silver or brass because they are assigned to another place, NOT CORRESPONDING TO THE SUPERNAL ABA AND IMA, as it is written: \"All the pillars round about the court shall be bound with silver... and their sockets of brass\" (Shemot 27:17). They are the instruments of service of the tabernacle, THE SECRET OF THE NUKVA OF ZEIR ANPIN. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 133. But no one is allowed to use the garment of honor OF THE HIGH PRIEST save the high priest, who is anointed with the oil of holy ointment upon his head, as it is written: \"And you shall make holy garments for Aharon your brother for honor and for beauty\" (Shemot 28:2). For in these garments, he resembles ABA above. 18. \"And the time drew near for Yisrael to die,\" part two Rabbi Yehuda opens the discussion by describing that every day a herald resounded in 250 worlds, in which two birds, one going to the north and the other to the south, would return to report the trembling of the world. When a man's end draws near, his legs, like the birds upon their return, become trapped, called \"the day of Hashem.\" A man's spirit must be righteous in order to have it sucked from him by God. Rabbi Yosi further explains that when a man is about to die, if he is righteous, it is proclaimed for thirty days by those in the Garden of Eden. The Relevance of this Passage Here, the purifying Light of The Creator cleanses our soul and awakens us to the value and importance of spiritual growth, so that we will merit a high place in the world to come. The world to come refers to both the Garden of Eden and to our present lifetime in this material realm. A man's end can refer to both his demise in this physical world, and to the end of his negative and wicked ways in this current life. 134. We learned \"And the time drew near for Yisrael to die.\" Rabbi Yehuda said: Woe to the world, who do not see, nor hear or know that on each and every day, a herald resounds in 250 worlds. 135. We learned about a certain world above, THE NUKVA. When the herald goes forth AND MAKES IT WHOLE, the world shudders and trembles. Two birds come out from that world, that live under the tree in which is the appearance of life and death. 136. One bird goes to the south side, and the other bird to the north side; the one goes with daybreak and the other when the day darkens. Each cries out what it heard from the herald. 137. Later, they wish to return to their place but their legs stumble on a hollow in the great abyss and they are trapped there until midnight, when the herald proclaims, \"And like the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared\" (Kohelet 9:12). 138. Rabbi Yehuda said: When man's legs are trapped and his time draws near, that day is called \"the day of Hashem\" when he returns the spirit to Him. We have learned that at that time, the holy crown visits the spirit OF THAT MAN. What is it? According to the verse, \"The days of our years are seventy\" (Tehilim 90:10) it is the seventh crown of all, NAMELY THE NUKVA, WHICH IS THE SEVENTH, FINEL, SFIRAH. "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 139. If THE NUKVA comes TO MAN from the side of Gvurah, NAMELY BINAH ABOVE THE SEVEN SFIROT CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, YESOD AND MALCHUT, it is written: \"Or if by special strength (Heb. gvurot), eighty years\" (Tehilim 90:10) since the crown of Gvurah is the eighth. From that time onward, life cannot be prolonged, as it says, \"Yet their pride is but trouble and wretchedness\" (Ibid.), for when there is no foundation, the building will not endure. 140. Rabbi Yehuda said: Happy are the righteous when the Holy One, blessed be He, wishes to take back their spirits to Himself and suck their spirits from within them. For we have learned that when the Holy One, blessed be He, desires to recall the spirit if it be a righteous spirit, it is written: \"And the spirit returns to the Elohim who gave it\" (Tehilim 12:7). 141. If it is not found to be righteous, woe to that spirit, which must bathe in the burning fire and be purified in order to be sucked into the body of the King, NAMELY THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE. If it is not corrected, woe to that spirit, which rolls like a stone in the hollow of the sling, as it is written: \"And the souls of your enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the hollow of a sling\" (I Shmuel 25:29). We learned that if the spirit is worthy, much good is stored for it in that world, as it is written: \"Neither has the eye seen, that a Elohim, beside You, should do such a thing for he that waits for Him\" (Yeshayah 64:3). 142. Rabbi Yosi said: When the time approaches for a man TO DIE, it is proclaimed in the world for thirty days THAT HIS TIME HAS COME TO DIE. Even the birds in the sky proclaim it, and if he is righteous, it is proclaimed for thirty days among the righteous in the Garden of Eden. 143. We have learned that all these thirty days, the soul ascends from him each night to go up and look at its place in that world, yet the man does not know ABOUT THIS, nor cares, nor has control over his soul during these thirty days like before, as it is written: \"There is no man who has power over the spirit to retain the spirit\" (Kohelet 8:8). Rabbi Yehuda said: At the beginning of the thirty days, the man's shadow is darkened, and the shape OF THE SHADOW is not seen upon the ground. 19. Rabbi Yitzchak sat sadly Rabbi Yitzchak asks Rabbi Yehuda for three things that were troubling him. Rabbi Yehuda then asks him why he thinks he is going to die. Rabbi Yitzchak explains that he no longer sees his shadow. They go to see Rabbi Shimon, who protects them from the Angel of Death. Rabbi Shimon asks Rabbi Yitzchak if he has seen his father today, for if so, that means he will die. Rabbi Shimon summons God to prepare to take Rabbi Yehuda away. Rabbi Yitzchak then sleeps and sees his father in his dream, who tells him that they are preparing his chamber in Heaven. Next, Rabbi Shimon asks God that Rabbi Yitzchak will not die, and the wish is granted. Not only that, Rabbi Yitzchak is given seventy places with doors to seventy worlds. Rabbi Yitzchak is then told that he will discover the secrets with Rabbi Shimon upon his death. The Relevance of this Passage The profound greatness of Rabbi Shimon is made evident here through his influence and connection to The Creator that allows him to turn aside the Angel of Death on behalf of a fellow rabbi, reversing a decree of death. Moreover, great spiritual worlds and treasures await the rabbi in the world to "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" come, by virtue of his association to Rabbi Shimon. In effect, this ancient passage is telling us that anyone who truthfully embraces the path of Rabbi Shimon and connects deeply to the Zohar and its wisdom, will have the power to stop the Angel of Death in its tracks and secure a place high in the heavens in the world to come. The Light emitted here helps to facilitate our connection to the path of the Zohar and deepens our relationship with the giant of all Kabbalists, the master Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. 144. Rabbi Yitzchak was sitting sadly one day by the door of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yehuda came out and found him sitting sadly at his door. He said to him: What is the matter today? 145. He said to him: I come to you to ask you three things. The first is that when you say words of the Torah, and you shall say the things that I said, say them in my name so as to mention my name. Also, that you shall teach my son, Yosef, the Torah and that you shall go to my grave all the seven days OF MOURNING and pray for me. 146. He said to him: How do you know YOU ARE GOING TO DIE? Rabbi Yitzchak said to him: My soul departs from me every night, but it does not enlighten me with dreams as before. Moreover, when I pray and reach the part of 'do hearken unto prayer and supplication', I look at my shadow upon the wall but do not see it. I think I SHALL DIE since the shadow is gone from me and cannot be seen. For a herald comes forth and proclaims, as it is written: \"Surely every man walks in a shadow\" (Tehilim 39:7). As long as his shadow has not gone from him, \"every man walks\" and his spirit within him. Once a man's shadow is no longer seen, he passes away from this world. 147. RABBI YEHUDA said to him: It is also derived from the verse, \"Because our days upon earth are a shadow\" (Iyov 8:9). RABBI YEHUDA said to him: I shall carry out your requests. But I also ask that you shall reserve a place for me by you in the other world, as I was by your side in this world. Rabbi Yitzchak wept and said: Please do not go away from me all these days. 148. They went to Rabbi Shimon and found him occupied with the Torah. Rabbi Shimon lifted up his eyes and saw the Angel of Death running and dancing before Rabbi Yitzchak. Rabbi Shimon stood up, held Rabbi Yitzchak by the hand and said: I decree that whoever is wont to come to me shall enter, and he who is not wont shall not come. Rabbi Yitzchak and Rabbi Yehuda came in. And he thus kept the Angel of Death remaining outside, UNABLE TO COME IN. "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 149. Rabbi Shimon looked and saw that his time had not yet come TO DIE, until the eighth hour of the day. Rabbi Shimon placed him before him and studied the Torah with him. Rabbi Shimon said to his son Rabbi Elazar, Sit at the door, and whoever you see do not speak with him; if he shall want to enter, swear he may not enter. 150. Rabbi Shimon said to Rabbi Yitzchak, Have you seen your father's image today, or have you not? For we have learned that when a man departs from the world, his father and relatives are there with him, and he sees and recognizes them. And all those with whom he will dwell in the other world in the same grade, all gather to be with him, and accompany his soul to its dwelling place. RABBI YITZCHAK said: Until now I have not seen THE IMAGE OF MY FATHER. 151. Rabbi Shimon stood up and said: Master of the universe, we have a certain Rabbi Yitzchak with us, one of the seven eyes here; TO WIT, ONE OF THE SEVEN STUDENTS WHO REMAINED ALIVE WHEN THEY WENT OUT OF THE HOLY ASSEMBLY. Behold, I hold him, give Him to me! A voice resounded saying: the throne of His Master, NAMELY THE NUKVA, has approached UNION through the wings of Rabbi Shimon. Behold, Rabbi Yitzchak is yours, and you shall come with him when you shall sit in your throne AT THE TIME RABBI SHIMON WILL PART FROM THE WORLD. Rabbi Shimon said: Certainly, I SHALL DO SO AND BRING HIM WITH ME WHEN I WILL DEPART FROM THE WORLD. 152. While he was speaking, Rabbi Elazar saw the Angel of Death departing. He said: No sentence stands at the place of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Shimon said to his son Rabbi Elazar, Come here and hold Rabbi Yitzchak, for I see he is afraid. Rabbi Elazar entered and held him, and Rabbi Shimon turned to study the Torah. 153. Rabbi Yitzchak slept and saw his father. HIS FATHER said to him: Son, happy is your portion in this world and in the World to Come, for you sit among the leaves of The Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden. A great and strong tree in both worlds is Rabbi Shimon, who holds you in his boughs. Happy is your portion, my son. 154. He said to him: Father, what am I there, IN THE WORLD OF TRUTH? He said to him: For three days they have been hastily preparing your chamber with open windows to shine upon you from the four directions of the world. I have seen your place, rejoiced and said: Happy is your portion, son. Only your son has not yet studied the Torah AND I WAS SORRY FOR THIS. "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 155. Even now, twelve righteous men from among the friends were preparing to come to you. As they were going, a sound went forth in all the worlds: Friends who stand here, bedeck yourself for Rabbi Shimon who has asked a request OF THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE, THAT RABBI YITZCHAK SHALL NOT DIE, and it was granted him. 156. Not only this, but seventy places are adorned for him here. Each place has doors opening to seventy worlds, each world opening to seventy channels, each opened for seventy supernal crowns, where there are ways leading to Atika, the most concealed of all, to see the highest pleasantness which delights and shines upon all, as it says \"to behold the pleasantness of Hashem, and to inquire in His temple\" (Tehilim 27:4). \"To inquire in His temple\" as it is written: \"For he is the trusted one in all my house\" (Bemidbar 12:7). 157. He said to him: Father, how long am I given to live in this world? He said to him: I was not given permission to tell you this, and man is not made to know. But at the feast for Rabbi Shimon, NAMELY ON HIS DAY OF DEPARTURE, WHEN THERE WILL BE GREAT JOY IN ALL THE WORLDS FOR ALL THE SECRETS HE REVEALED, AS MENTIONED IN THE SMALL ASSEMBLY, you shall be there to set his table TO REVEAL MYSTERIES WITH HIM. As it says, \"Go forth, O daughters of Tzion, and behold King Solomon with the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, and on the day of the gladness of his heart\" (Shir Hashirim 3:11). 158. Rabbi Yitzchak then awoke and laughed and his face shone. Rabbi Shimon looked at his face and said to him: You have heard something new. RABBI YITZCHAK said to him: Surely I HAVE HEARD; He told him WHAT HE SAW IN HIS DREAM. RABBI YITZCHAK prostrated himself ON THE GROUND before Rabbi Shimon. 159. We have learned from that day onward that Rabbi Yitzchak would hold his son in his hand. He studied the Torah with him, and never left him. When he came before Rabbi Shimon, he made his son sit outside. He used to come in and sit before Rabbi Shimon and call before him, \"O Hashem, I am oppressed, be you my security\" (Yeshayah 38:14). 20. When it is time for a man to depart from the world This section starts by saying that when a man dies, Four Judgments arise from four winds of the world. The four elements in man--earth, air, fire, water--attach and fight with each other. They are then separated upon his death. The herald next explains that man is evil if he has no merit, and his soul will burn in Nahar Dinur (river of fire). At this time, he confesses his deeds. Rabbi Yehuda then explains to Rabbi Yosi the reason for \"a black cock,\" black being the color of judgment. When judgment comes upon man, the black cock starts crowing, then a second supernal spirit is added to him, so that he may see what he never saw in his days. If he is righteous, he goes to heaven; if not, his spirit stays in this world, and eventually ends up in Gehenom. Rabbi Yehuda then explains the triple-colored pillar in the lower Garden of Eden, meaning the three colors of the rainbow. The soul ascends through the pillar into righteousness, and so on towards God, if he is worthy. The Relevance of this Passage The power to cleanse the evil from our nature and purify our souls from the iniquities we knowingly or unknowingly committed in life, is bestowed upon us, provided we connect to this passage with an atoning heart. This Light sweetens judgments and helps us recognize the foolishness and dangers of self-centered behavior. We are inspired to travel the path of righteousness. "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 160. We have learned that on that hard and terrible day, when it is time for a man to depart from the world, the four winds of the world, CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, AND MALCHUT, sentence the world with severe Judgment. Four Judgments arise from the four winds of the world. The four ELEMENTS IN MAN, FIRE, AIR, WATER, AND EARTH that are attached to each other, fight and quarrel between them and wish to depart each to its own side, THE ELEMENT OF FIRE WITHIN MAN TO THE GENERAL ELEMENT OF FIRE, THE ELEMENT OF WATER WITHIN MAN INTO THE ELEMENT OF WATER IN THE WORLD, AND SO ON. FOR THE ELEMENTS WITHIN MAN ARE SEPARATED IN HIS DEATH. 161. The herald, THE SECRET OF THE ILLUMINATION OF CHOCHMAH FROM THE UNION ON THE LEFT, comes forth. He proclaims in the supernal world TEVUNAH and is heard in 270 worlds. If he be righteous, all the worlds welcome him with joy; FOR IF HE HAS MERIT, HE IS GOOD. But if he be not righteous, woe to this man and his portion, FOR IF HE HAS NO MERIT HE IS EVIL. 162. HE EXPLAINS WHY HE IS EVIL IF HE HAS NO MERIT. HE SAYS, We have learned that when the crier makes his proclamation, a flame comes out from the north side, and goes to be burned in Nahar Dinur (the river of fire), MENTIONED AS \"A FIERY STREAM ISSUED AND CAME FORTH FROM BEFORE HIM\" (DANIEL 7:10). It expands to the four directions of the world and burns the souls of the wicked. 163. The flame, THE JUDGMENT OF MALCHUT, WHICH IS REVEALED BY THE SECRET OF 'IF HE HAS NO MERIT, HE IS EVIL' ascends TO BINAH, and descends back into the world, BACK TO MALCHUT. The flame alights beneath the wings of a black cock, which flaps its wings and crows at the opening between the gates. 164. At the first time, it crows, saying \"For, behold, that day is coming: it burns like a furnace...\" (Malachi 3:19). On the second time, it crows and says, \"For, lo, He that forms the mountains, and creates the wind, and declares to man what is his thought\" (Amos 4:13). At that time, man sits AND HEARS THE WITNESSES give testimony on his deeds before him, and he confesses them. On the third time, when they want to take his soul from him, the cock crows, saying: \"Who would not fear you, O King of the nations? for to You it is fitting\" (Yirmeyah 10:7). 165. Rabbi Yosi said: Why a black cock? Rabbi Yehuda said to him: Everything that the Holy One, blessed be He, created upon earth alludes to Wisdom, only men do not know. This is the meaning of the words \"O Hashem, how manifold are your works! in Wisdom have you made them all\" (Tehilim 104:24), for they have been made in Wisdom and allude to Wisdom. "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 166. We have learned IN THE MATTER of the black cock that Judgment abides only in a place of its own kind, and black pertains to the side of Judgment, SINCE THE BLACK COLOR ALLUDES TO MALCHUT, THE ATTRIBUTE OF JUDGMENT. Therefore at midnight exactly, when the north wind, THE LEFT COLUMN, stirs, a flame comes out and strikes under the wings of the cock, and it crows. The cock is black, BEING OF THE ATTRIBUTE OF JUDGMENT, and thus is more appropriate than A COCK OF a different COLOR. 167. Here too, when Judgment is aroused upon man, THE BLACK COCK starts crowing. No one knows it save the man who is about to die. For we have learned that when a man is about to die, and Judgment hovers about him so he would depart from the world, another Supernal Spirit is added to him which he had not before during his lifetime. When it hovers about him and cleaves to him, he is able to see what he never saw in his days, due to the additional spirit in him. When the spirit is added to him, he sees and then departs from this world. This is the meaning of the verse, \"You take away their breath (lit. 'you shall add their spirit'), they die, and return to their dust\" (Tehilim 104:29). Then it is written: \"For no man shall see me, and live\" (Shemot 33:20), WHICH MEANS THAT when they are alive they cannot see, but they do when they die. 168. We have learned that when a man dies, he is given permission to see, and he sees about him his relatives and friends from the world of Truth. They all have their forms engraved upon them like they were in this world. If the man is righteous, they are all happy to see him and greet him. 169. If he is not righteous, they do not recognize him but only the wicked, who are smitten daily in Gehenom. They are all sad, they open their speech with 'woe' and end with 'woe'. The man lifts up his eyes and sees them as something burnt rising from the fire. He too opens AND SAYS OF THEM 'woe'. 170. We have learned that when a man's soul departs, all his relatives and friends in the world of Truth accompany his soul and show it the place of delight and place of punishment. If he is righteous, he sees his place, and goes up to sit and take delight in the upper Eden of that world. If he is not righteous, the soul remains in this world, until the body is buried in the ground. Once it is buried, numerous executioners grab it until it reaches Dumah, and is put in the stories of Gehenom. "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 171. Rabbi Yehuda said: All the seven days OF MOURNING the soul goes from the house to the grave and from the grave BACK to the house and mourns for the body, as it is written: \"His flesh shall suffer pain for him, and his soul shall mourn for it\" (Iyov 14:22). It goes to sit in the house, and when it sees everybody sad, it mourns TOO. 172. We have learned that after seven days the body becomes whatever it turns into, and the soul goes into its place. It enters the cave of the Machpelah. It sees whatever it sees, and enters wherever it enters until arriving at the Garden of Eden, it meets the Cherubs and the flash of the turning sword in the Garden of Eden. If it is worthy of entering, it enters. 173. We have learned that four pillars, THE FOUR ANGELS COMING FROM THE FOUR SPIRITUAL ELEMENTS CHOCHMAH AND BINAH, TIFERET AND MALCHUT, are appointed OVER THE SOUL. They have a bodily form in their hands, and it gleefully dons it, and sits in a story in the lower Garden of Eden for the period of time allotted for it TO SIT THERE. 174. A triple-colored pillar stands there IN THE LOWER GARDEN OF EDEN, THE SECRET OF THE THREE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW. This pillar is called the \"dwelling place of Mount Tzion\" (Yeshayah 4:5), as it is written \"And Hashem will create upon every dwelling place of Mount Tzion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day...\" THE SOUL ascends through that pillar into the opening of righteousness, where Tzion and Jerusalem are, YESOD AND MALCHUT OF THE NUKVA OF ZEIR ANPIN CALLED RIGHTEOUSNESS. 175. If it is worthy of ascending further than that, happy is its lot and portion which cleaves to the body of the King; NAMELY TO ZEIR ANPIN, FOR IT ALREADY MERITED TO ASCEND TO TZION AND JERUSALEM, THE SECRET OF THE NUKVA. THE NEXT GRADE IS THE BODY OF THE KING, ZEIR ANPIN. If it is not worthy of going further up, it is written OF IT: \"And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Tzion, and he that remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy\" (Ibid. 3). But if he is worthy of going further up, happy is he to attain the glory of the King, NAMELY ZEIR ANPIN, and to be delighted in the supernal Eden above the place called heaven, NAMELY ZEIR ANPIN, as it is written: \"Then shall you delight yourself in (Lit. 'alone') Hashem\" (Ibid. 58:14). \"Above Hashem\" is precise ZEIR ANPIN CALLED YUD-HEI-VAV-HEI. Happy is the portion of him who is worthy of this chesed, as it is written: \"For your steadfast love (Heb. chesed) is great above the heavens\" (Tehilim 108:5). "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 176. HE ASKS: Is Chesed above the heaven? It is written: \"For your Chesed is great unto the heavens\" (Ibid. 57:11), WHICH MEANS THAT CHESED IS UNDER THE HEAVEN. HE ANSWERS: There is Chesed and Chesed, an upper Chesed and a lower. The upper Chesed, CHESED OF ZEIR ANPIN ITSELF, is above the heaven, AS HEAVEN IS TIFERET AND CHESED PRECEDES TIFERET. THEREFORE, SCRIPTURE SAYS, \"FOR YOUR CHESED IS GREAT ABOVE THE HEAVENS.\" The lower Chesed, CHESED OF ZEIR ANPIN CLOTHED BY THE NUKVA THROUGH NETZACH HOD OF ZEIR ANPIN is like \"the sure Chassdadim of David\" (Yeshayah 55:3), CALLED DAVID AFTER THE NUKVA. of which it says, \"FOR YOUR CHESED is great unto the heavens\" SINCE THEY ARE BELOW THE HEAVENS, TIFERET OF ZEIR ANPIN. 21. \"A joyful mother of children\" Rabbi Yitzchak begins by saying the mother is Binah. Rabbi Shimon adds that there are two children: one male, who went to Ya'akov, and one female, who went to Avraham. He continues by saying that the quotation is a warning to men not to sin, for it may cause Binah to depart from the children, Zeir Anpin and Nukva. When the inhabitants perform good deeds, Binah returns to her young. Rabbi Shimon concludes by saying that happy is the portion for those who \"behold the pleasantness of Hashem\" and desire righteousness. The Relevance of this Passage The Light of The Creator is endless, ever present, and it never changes. Darkness only exists when our Lower World disconnects from the Upper World. Disconnection occurs each time we succumb to the will of our ego and treat others with anything less than human dignity. Connection to the Upper World takes place when a man masters the drives of his ego and yields to the longings of his soul. Here we are stimulated to perform positive deeds and we strengthen our connection to the Upper World, the realm of Binah. 177. We learned that Rabbi Yitzchak said: \"A joyful mother of children. Haleluyah\" (Tehilim 113:9). We know who the mother is, SHE IS BINAH, but who are the children? Rabbi Shimon said: We have learned that the Holy One, blessed be He, BINAH, has two children, one male and one female. The male he gave to Ya'akov, as it is written: \"Yisrael is my son, my firstborn\" (Shemot 4:22) and \"Yisrael, in whom I will be glorified\" (Yeshayah 49:3), and the girl he gave to Avraham, as it is written: \"And Hashem had blessed Avraham in all things (Heb. bakol)\" (Beresheet 24:1). Avraham had a daughter named Bakol. 178. The mother, BINAH, sits on them, MALE AND FEMALE and suckles them. Hence it is written: \"You shall not take the mother together with the young\" (Devarim 22:6). We learned ITS MEANING that a man should beware of sinning below, IN THIS WORLD, for it might cause the mother, BINAH, to depart from the children, MALE AND FEMALE. It is also written, \"She is your mother; you shall not uncover her nakedness\" (Vayikra 18:7); TO WIT, NOT TO CAUSE HER TO LEAVE THE YOUNG. Woe to him who indulges in incest, WHO CAUSES THE MOTHER TO DEPART FROM THE YOUNG. 179. When the inhabitants of the world repent and do many good deeds before the Holy One, blessed be He, and the mother, BINAH, returns to cover the young, MALE AND FEMALE, BINAH is then called repentance (lit. 'returning'). HE ASKS: Why is it called returning? HE REPLIES: For she returns to her sustenance; TO WIT, BINAH RETURNS TO COVER THE CHILDREN, MALE AND FEMALE, AND GIVES THEM SUCK AS BEFORE. It is then written, \"a joyful mother of children.\" The \"joyful mother\" is surely BINAH, and hence a man should continue multiplying until he begets a boy and a girl, TO CORRESPOND TO MALE AND FEMALE, THE CHILDREN OF BINAH. "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 180. Rabbi Yitzchak said: It is written: \"To behold the pleasantness of Hashem, and to inquire in His temple\" (Tehilim 27:4). We understand from this that the desire of the righteous is to behold THE PLEASANTNESS OF HASHEM, THE PLEASANT MOCHIN OF ZEIR ANPIN. How can you say \"above Hashem\"? Rabbi Shimon said: All is one, because we understand from the words \"the pleasantness of Hashem\" that it comes from Atika Kadisha to heaven, TO WIT, ZEIR ANPIN RECEIVES MOCHIN FROM ABOVE IT. The desire of the righteous is assuredly ONLY TO ATTAIN THESE MOCHIN OF ZEIR ANPIN AND NOT ABOVE IT, FOR THERE IS NO CONCEPTION OF THE FIRST THREE SFIROT. IT IS WRITTEN OF THEM: \"GREAT ABOVE THE HEAVEN\" (TEHILIM 108:5), BECAUSE THEY COME FROM ABOVE ZEIR ANPIN. FOR THE SAME REASON, it is also written: \"Then shall you delight yourself in (Lit. 'above') Hashem\" (Yeshayah 58:14). Happy is the portion of him, who merit this. They must be few. 22. \"My mother's children were angry with me\" Rabbi Shimon describes this quotation as the one that explains the exile of Yisrael's children, when God decided he wanted to destroy His lower house. By exiling the children, he remained \"aloof\" from Malchut (earth). So \"my mother's children\" refers to Malchut and Zeir Anpin, Binah the mother. Then Rabbi Yosi describes how he was walking with Rabbi Chiya when they spotted a man in the river who said \"Crown, crown,\" referring to the crowns Malchut and Zeir Anpin. Then \"a flame came and consumed the bird\" on the man's head, referring to Malchon, a button. The Relevance of this Passage In reality, The Creator does not choose to destroy or reward his Creation. The Light of The Creator is a constant expanding force of goodness, positivity, and fulfillment. It is man's free-willed choice as to whether he connects to this divine force of Energy [reward] or disconnects from the Light [destruction]. The entire structure of the Upper and Lower Worlds can be simplified and understood by the following analogy. The electrical current flowing through a home is always available for use. If a room is in darkness and we mistakenly [or purposely] fail to plug a lamp into the wall socket, the room remains darkened. The electrical current, however, never changed. It is not logical to conclude that the electricity decided to withhold its energy, keeping the room darkened. It is our own actions or lack of actions that determine whether we live in darkness or light. Kabbalah is the blueprint of the universe, providing man with the tools and methods for connecting to spiritual Light. The verses appearing in this passage are one such tool. We connect ourselves to the mother, Binah, the source and fountainhead of the Light that shines in this world. 181. We learned that Rabbi Shimon said: It is written, \"My mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards\" (Shir Hashirim 1:6). \"My mother's children\" are as in the verse: \"Cast down from heaven to (or: the) earth\" (Eichah 2:1), THE EARTH BEING THE NUKVA. For when the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted to destroy His lower house, NAMELY THE TEMPLE, and exile the children of Yisrael among the nations, He removed the earth, THE NUKVA, from before Him, and remained aloof from it: \"And his sister stood afar off\" (Shemot 2:4). And when the earth was afar from the heaven above, ZEIR ANPIN, the lower earth, NAMELY THE TEMPLE, was destroyed and the children of Yisrael were dispersed among the nations. The Congregation of Yisrael said: Who has done this to me, who caused this? \"My mother's children,\" ZEIR ANPIN AND THE NUKVA, who \"were angry with me\" and kept away from me. Assuredly they are \"my mother's children,\" ZEIR ANPIN AND NUKVA BEING THE CHILDREN OF BINAH, THE MOTHER. 182. Rabbi Yosi went on the road with Rabbi Chiya bar Rav. While they were walking, Rabbi Yosi said to Rabbi Chiya, Do you see what I see? He said to him: I see a man in the river, and a bird on his head with teeth in her mouth. It is eating and tearing with its claws. The man raises his voice and shouts, but I do not know what he says. "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 183. RABBI YOSI said: Let us approach the man and hear what he says. Rabbi Chiya said: I am afraid to come near. He said to him: Is this a man in that place? The Holy One, blessed be He, gave us a hint of Wisdom. They came near him and heard him say, Crown, crown, I.E., ZEIR ANPIN AND NUKVA CALLED CROWNS, two children OF BINAH dwell outside THEIR PLACE. ZEIR ANPIN does not have rest, nor is there respite FOR THE NUKVA, until the bird will be cast away TORN TO pieces in Caesarea. 184. Rabbi Yosi wept and said: This is what we learned in relation to the verse: \"My mother's children were angry with me,\" WHICH ALLUDES TO MALE AND FEMALE. Why? Because \"my own vineyard I have not kept\" (Shir Hashirim 1:6). 185. He said: Assuredly the exile will continue, and therefore the birds in the sky, THE MINISTERS OF THE NATIONS, will be in power until the government of the idolatrous nations will pass away from the world. When will that be? When the day of the Holy One, blessed be He, will come and His Judgment will be set upon the world, as it is written: \"But it shall be one particular day which shall be known as Hashem's, neither day, nor night\" (Zecharyah 14:7). 186. While they were walking, they heard a voice saying: 'The flame of the button has come with its judgment'; TO WIT, OF MALCHUT CALLED BUTTON. A flame came and consumed the bird. Rabbi Yosi said: Surely, it happened as in the verse, \"And given to the burning flame\" (Daniel 7:11). 23. \"And your covenant with death shall be annulled\" Rabbi Yosi begins the discussion by saying that God exiled Yisrael only after His children lost Faith, which is the secret of the Shechinah. Then the Shechinah is separated, or \"annulled\" from Zeir Anpin. Death, we learn, will be destroyed from the world only when the children of Yisrael \"cleave to the right\" of God. The Relevance of this Passage At the moment of creation, the souls of mankind sought the opportunity to create their own Light through their effort towards spiritual transformation. For this reason, our physical world, and all the supernal worlds above, was created. We create our own Light when we overcome our doubts concerning the reality of The Creator and when we triumph over our Evil Inclinations. When we experience doubt or succumb to the selfish impulses of our nature, we disconnect from the Light and our exile continues. These negative attributes are associated with the Left Column energy. However, when a man \"cleaves to the right\" of God, it means he is becoming a more sharing and tolerant person, the attributes associated with Right Column energy. Thus, one purpose behind this passage is to ignite the power of Right Column energy within us, so that we overcome our dark side and attract the Light of the Shechinah into our lives. In addition, the mere act of reading the words contained herein strengthens our faith, arouses the Light of the Shechinah and helps to remove the force of the death from this universe. 187. Rabbi Yosi said: The Holy One, blessed be He, exiled Yisrael only when there was no faith among them, WHICH IS THE SECRET OF THE SHECHINAH CALLED FAITH, FOR SINCE THEY HAVE IMPAIRED THEIR COVENANT, THE SHECHINAH WAS GONE FROM THEM. For when faith is withheld from them, it is so in everything, I. E. ALSO ABOVE, THE SHECHINAH IS SEPARATED FROM ZEIR ANPIN, as it is written: \"And your covenant with death shall be annulled\" (Yeshayah 28:18), WHICH MEANS THAT KEEPING THE COVENANT ATONES FROM DEATH, AND IT ATONED FOR THEM TOO, SO THEY WOULD NOT GO INTO EXILE. BUT THEY DID IMPAIR THE COVENANT AND THUS THE SHECHINAH DEPARTED FROM THEM. "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 188. Rabbi Chiya said: This is the meaning of, \"He will destroy death for ever\" (Yeshayah 25:8). RABBI YOSI said to him: When the Holy One, blessed be He, will awaken His right, death will be destroyed forever from the world. But the right will not stir until the children of Yisrael will arise and cleave to the right of the Holy One, blessed be He. What is \"THE RIGHT\" OF THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE? It is the Torah, as is written: \"From His right hand went a fiery law for them\" (Devarim 33:2). At that time, \"the right hand of Hashem does valiantly\" (Tehilim 118:16) followed by, \"I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of Hashem\" (Ibid. 17), AS THE RIGHT ANNULS DEATH. 189. We have learned that a righteous man, with whom the Holy One, blessed be He, is delighted, is proclaimed by a herald for thirty days among the righteous in the Garden of Eden, and all the righteous rejoice. They all come to decorate his place until he will come to be seated among them. 24. \"Woe to the wicked, it shall be ill\" This section opens by stating that all wicked men are sad and that they say, \"Woe.\" The wicked, as Rabbi Yitzchak points out, are those who spill their \"semen in vain.\" Those who do this are called ra (evil), and it is the worst transgression. They never escape from Gehenom. Rabbi Yehuda further adds that it is the only sin for which one cannot atone. The Relevance of this Passage The entire physical world is a shadow, a reflection of the Upper World. Everything on this physical plane has a corresponding counterpart in the supernal realm. Semen is the substance most reflective of the Light of The Creator. Hence, as raw naked energy must be concealed in high voltage cables in order to harness its power, semen must remain concealed in this physical world. When it is wasted in vain, through selfish gratification, and not used for the divine purpose of creating life and/or sharing pleasure with one's spouse, negative forces that dwell among us are free to use this energy for destructive purposes. This passage helps us cleanse sexual iniquities from the world and gives us the strength to direct our urges in a positive and sharing way. 190. If he be evil, a herald announces him in Gehenom for thirty days. All the wicked men are sad and open AND SAY, 'Woe'. For a new Judgment is awakened for a certain person, and numerous accusers await him to welcome him AND SAY TO HIM, 'Woe.' Woe unto the wicked, woe unto his neighbor. 191. They all open and say, \"Woe to the wicked, it shall be ill with him, for according to the deserving of his hands shall be done to him\" (Yeshayah 3:11). What is \"the deserving of his hands\"? Rabbi Yitzchak said: It includes him who defiles with his hands by spilling his semen in vain. "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 192. For we have learned that he who spills his semen in vain is called ra (evil), and cannot behold the face of the Shechinah, as it is written: \"For you are not an El that has pleasure in wickedness: nor shall evil dwell with you\" (Tehilim 5:5) and also \"And Er, Yehuda's firstborn, was evil (Heb. ra)\" (Beresheet 38:7). Here too, \"Woe to the wicked... ill (Heb. ra)\" ALLUDES TO HIM WHO SPILLS HIS SEMEN IN VAIN. Woe to the wicked who is evil and made himself evil (Heb. ra), \"for according to the deserving of his hands shall be done to him.\" This means that whoever whores himself by letting his semen spill in vain is punished in the world of truth more than any OTHER TRANSGRESSION. 193. Come and see it is written: \"Woe to the wicked.\" Since it says, \"Woe to the wicked (Heb. rasha),\" why add 'ra (evil)' SEEING THAT THE WICKED IS EVIL? This is as I said: that he has made himself evil, ESPECIALLY HE WHO SPILLED HIS SEMEN IN VAIN. ALSO: \"... nor shall evil dwell with you.\" Everyone ascends FROM GEHENOM save this one, who does not. HE ASKS: Would you say that other evil-doers who killed people ARE BETTER THAN HE, AND WILL ASCEND WHILE HE SHALL NOT? HE ANSWERS, Come and behold: everyone rises but he does not, because they killed other people, yet he killed his own children, and spilled much blood. Come and behold: it is not written of any other wicked man in the world that he \"displeased Hashem\" (Beresheet 38:10), only in this case where it says, \"And the thing which he did displeased Hashem.\" Why? Because, the verse says, \"He spilled it on the ground\" (Ibid. 9). 194. We learned that Rabbi Yehuda said: There is no sin in the world for that one cannot repent other then the one OF SPILLING ONE'S SEMEN IN VAIN. There are no wicked men who shall not behold the face of the Shechinah IN THEIR DEATH, save him of whom it says \"nor shall evil dwell with you\" at all. Rabbi Yitzchak said: Happy are the righteous in this world and in the World to Come, of whom scripture says, \"Your people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever\" (Yeshayah 60:21). Rabbi Yehuda said: It is also said in \"I will walk before Hashem in the land of the living\" (Tehilim 116:9), WHICH IS THE SHECHINAH, CALLED LAND, THE LAND HERE ALLUDES TO THE SHECHINAH. 195. \"And Ya'akov lived\" among them: Another explanation for this is that a man should not mingle his image with that of the idolatrous nations, for the one is holy and the other defiled. 25. The shadow This section begins by describing the difference between what happens when a person dies to the body of a man of Yisrael, and to the body of an idolatrous heathen. Unlike an Israelite, a heathen's impurities cannot be defiled. Each Israelite contains two shadows (tzelamim,) the ordinary and the holy shadow. As he approaches death, both shadows depart, since they are joined together. He must write letters and put them in a bag, and then on Yom Kippur, he must repent. If he attains repentance, the letters are torn; if not, they are read in consideration for judgment. Then, there follows a description of the significance of various parts of a man's shadow, and what it means if one or many of them are missing. Everything in the Lower World has its root in higher worlds. When one stirs, so does the other. The Relevance of this Passage The Light to cleanse ourselves from sin and wrongdoing is bestowed upon readers of this passage. The importance of repentance is awakened within us and we remove judgments decreed against us in the Upper Worlds. Our shadow is the link between the body and soul, and when a person is about to leave this world, the shadow becomes dimmer. This section helps strengthen our shadow, removing the force of death from life. "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 196. Come and see the difference between Yisrael and the idolatrous nations. When a man of Yisrael dies, he defiles the body and the house. But the body of a heathen man does not defile and his body is not defiled in his death. Why is it so? 197. HE ANSWERS: When a man from Yisrael dies, all the holiness of his Master is removed from him, the holy shadow and the Holy Spirit is gone from him and leave his body defiled. 198. But this is not so for an idolatrous heathen. For during his lifetime he is impure on all sides, his shadow is impure and his spirit is impure. Since impurities lie within him, it is forbidden to come near him. Once he dies, all the impurities depart from him and the body is left without defiling impurity. 199. Though their bodies are defiled both during their life and in their deaths, yet when they are alive all the impurities within them have the power to defile others. In their deaths, when impurities leave them, they cannot defile. A BODY OF an Yisraeli AFTER DEATH can defile others, since all that is holy has left him and the Other Side dwells upon him. 200. Come and see this holy shadow. When a man grows and his shape is made COMPLETED by a face, another shadow is made and joins THE FIRST ONE, each embracing the other. When a man has two shadows, he is protected and his body lives with a spirit abiding within it. 201. When his time draws near for him to die, the shadows (Heb. tzelamim) depart from him, the one causes the other to depart SINCE THEY ARE JOINED TOGETHER. The man remains without protection, in accordance with the verse: \"Before the days cools, and the shadows (Heb. tzelalim) flee away\" (Shir Hashirim 2:17), NOT SAYING 'SHADOW' BUT 'SHADOWS,' NAMELY two--AS WE SAID. 202. Come and see: When Judgment awakens in the world and the Holy One, blessed be He, sits on His throne of justice to sentence the world ON ROSH HASHANAH, a man should awaken to repent his sins. For on that day, letters are written and put in a bag all written down. If a man succeeded and returned IN REPENTANCE before his Master, the letters concerning him are torn. "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 203. After that, the Holy One, blessed be He, prepared Yom Kippur for man. If he repents his sins, well. If not, the King commands to seal the letters. Woe to him, for repentance is about to depart from him. 204. If he attains repentance, yet it is not whole, the letter is withheld until the last day called Atzeret (gathering), which is the eighth day of Sukkot. If he wholly repented before his Master, the letters are torn; if he has not, the letters are sent from the King's house and given to the punishing angel for the judgment to be executed. After the letters are handed out, they return no more to the King's house, AND THE JUDGMENT WRITTEN IN THEM MUST BE EXECUTED. 205. Then, the images are gone and do not abide with him. Once they are gone from him, the King's punishment comes upon him, and he tastes the cup of death. On the night of the last festival, THE EIGHTH DAY OF SUKKOT, the executioners are ready and receive the letters. After they do, the images are gone and cannot be with them. If THE SHADOWS are with him, no judgment comes upon him, nor evil illnesses THAT COME when the shadows are flawed, as we already explained elsewhere. 206. In ancient books, this is explained further: When the head of his shadow is missing but the body is not, it indicates that his child or wife will survive but he will pass away. This is true as long as he does not repent. If he does, he will only taste death and recover from his illness. 207. If the body OF HIS SHADOW will not be seen, but only the head, HIS FAMILY WILL DIE and he will stay alive. This is true as long as he is responsible for his small child. 208. If the hands OF THE SHADOW are flawed, it is an indication that the works of his hands will deteriorate, and if his legs ARE FLAWED, it is an indication that illnesses pursue him. If the shadow flees and returns, then flees and returns again, it is said of him, \"In the morning you shall say, 'Would it were evening'\" (Devarim 28:67). This is true only when the moon shines and the night is diffused with her light, WHEN HE CHECKS HIS SHADOW. 209. But the righteous and the pious search in their hearts every day as if on this very day they are to pass away from the world, and they repent wholly before their Master. They have need of nothing else, I. E. CHECKING THEIR SHADOW OR THE LIKE OF IT. Happy is their portion in this world and in the World to Come. "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 210. Come and see \"every one that is called by My name\" (Yeshayah 43:7). How exalted are the worshipers of the holy King, for their actions below connect them to the higher things above; TO WIT, TO THEIR ROOTS. FOR EACH THING BELOW IN THE WORLD HAS A ROOT ABOVE IN HIGHER WORLDS. When they are taken down and act by them, the action above, THEIR ROOT IN HIGHER WORLDS, AWAKENS in accordance with it. This is like the hyssop and the cedar wood THE TORAH COMMANDS HIM WHO IS PURIFIED TO USE, as we already explained. 26. The four kinds This further describes the importance of the root connection between aspects of the lower and higher worlds. There are four things to cleave to: the Lulav, Etrog (citron), myrtle, and willow. Then, we learn of the significance of \"the fifteenth day,\" the first of the three travelling Columns. Next, we are told that Yom Kippur is the secret of Ima, the day in which Binah sets the prisoners free, who name that day \"the first day\", and ask Binah for water. It is either the beginning of \"Clouds of Glory\" or of \"Living Water.\" The Relevance of this Passage Here we connect ourselves to the internal spiritual forces associated with the Lulav, Etrog, myrtle branch, and willow. These physical items work like an antenna. They have powerful spiritual counterparts in the Upper World which help us draw the Light of protection to our lives. We also destroy any judgments that might be pending in the Upper Courts, provided our hearts are filled with repentance. 211. Some of them cleave to the Holy Name above, like the Lulav, Etrog (citron), myrtle and willow. In relation to them, we learned that we should unite them; NAMELY TO BIND THEM TOGETHER and perform an action with them; NAMELY TO SHAKE THEM, in order to arouse joy in the root to which it cleaves above. We have learned that by speech, THE BENEDICTION OF THE PRECEPTS, and by deed, THE PRECEPT, we should exhibit it BELOW in order to awaken that WHICH IS ABOVE; NAMELY ITS SUPERNAL ROOT. 212. This is the meaning of the words: \"Every one that is called by My Name: for My Glory\" namely, so it would glorify Me; \"I have created him\" so he would declare My unity; \"I have formed him\" so he would perform good deeds for My sake; \"I have made him\" so that through him the supernal force will awaken. 213. Another explanation: \"Every one that is called by My Name\" as it is written \"the fruit of the tree Hadar (citrus)\" (Vayikra 23:40); \"For My glory I have created him\" namely, the \"branches of palm trees;\" \"I have formed him,\" \"the boughs of thick leaved tree;\" \"I have made him,\" the \"willow of the brook.\" 214. They are to be used, as it says, \"And you shall take for yourselves on the first day\" (Ibid.), which is the fifteenth. 215. But what is the first day SCRIPTURE MENTIONS, WHAT DOES IT ALLUDE TO? HE REPLIES: It is the first to travel by the sources of living water, BEING THE FIRST COLUMN OF THE THREE TRAVELING COLUMNS, THROUGH WHICH TRAVEL CHASSADIM BECOME REVEALED BY CHOCHMAH CALLED LIVING WATER. FOR THE RIGHT COLUMN, CHESED, TRAVELS FIRST, and we should draw into the world. FOR IN SUKKOT, IT IS TIME FOR DRAWING CHASSIDIM, ACCORDING TO THE SECRET OF \"HIS RIGHT HAND EMBRACES ME\" (SHIR HASHIRIM 8:3). "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 216. This is like the story of a king who put people into his prison. The lady, his mother, came and set them free. The king, mindful of her honor, put them under her authority. She found them hungry and thirsty and said TO HER SON THE KING, now that I set them free, give them food and drink. 217. Thus Yom Kippur, WHICH IS THE SECRET OF IMA, BINAH sets them free. We are hungry for nourishment and thirsty for a drink, FOR NO PHYSICAL FOOD AND DRINK IS DRAWN FROM BINAH, FOR WHICH REASON WE FAST AND AFFLICT OUR SOULS ON THE DAY OF ATONEMENT. She therefore adorns THE KING, ZEIR ANPIN, THE SON OF BINAH, with his crown, MOCHIN OF CHASSADIM on this day, THE FIRST OF THE FESTIVAL. We know that there is living water there, and we ask for water from the one who set us free, SO SHE WOULD GIVE CHASSADIM TO ZEIR ANPIN FOR US, AFTER WE ATTAINED MOCHIN OF CHOCHMAH FROM HER ON YOM KIPPUR, THE SECRET OF FREEDOM. We therefore name this day 'the first day'. 218. All this is written in the book of Agada, and is correct. But BESIDES WHAT WAS SAID, this day THAT ALLUDES TO Avraham, THE SECRET OF THE SFIRAH OF CHESED, is the starting point of everything-whether it is the beginning of the clouds of glory THAT ARE THE SECRET OF THE SURROUNDING LIGHTS, IT IS THE BEGINNING AS THE FIRST SURROUNDING LIGHT IS CHESED, or the beginning of water, THE SECRET OF INTERNAL LIGHT, AS FOR THE FIRST SURROUNDING LIGHT IS CHESED, INTERNAL LIGHT IS CHESED. THIS IS THE SECRET MEANING OF Avraham starting to dig wells of water. 219. \"The fruit of the tree Hadar\" is the well of Yitzchak; NAMELY THE NUKVA CALLED WELL WHEN RECEIVING CHOCHMAH FROM THE LEFT COLUMN OF ZEIR ANPIN CALLED YITZCHAK. For Yitzchak glorified (Heb. hider) the Holy One, blessed be He, and called Him \"the tree Hadar,\" THE NUKVA BEING the fruit of this particular tree. \"Branches of palm trees\" are as it is written: \"The righteous man flourishes like the palm tree\" (Tehilim 92:13), NAMELY THE RIGHTEOUS YESOD. There is no dividing between YESOD AND THE NUKVA, for which reason it does not say \"and branches\" but just \"branches (Heb. kapot),\" WHICH IS AN INDICATION OF BINDING (HEB. KAPHUT) AND UNITY. For they cannot exist without each other, BUT ARE ALWAYS BOUND TOGETHER. Through this the well, THE NUKVA, is filled from the well of supernal living water, BINAH, for YESOD is filled first FROM TIFERET AND TIFERET FROM BINAH, and from it, the well is filled until it BECOMES a gushing spring for everyone. 220. \"The bough of thick leaved tree\": This is the bough of the great tree TIFERET, which was strengthened, struck root and became a high tree, connected on every side; NAMELY TIFERET WHICH INCLUDES THE SIX SFIROT CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, AND YESOD WHICH HOLD TO IT ON EVERY SIDE. This bough is a thick tree (Heb. avot, with Ayin), holding on to the patriarchs (Heb. avot, with Aleph). FOR IT IS THE CENTRAL COLUMN THAT COMPRISES RIGHT AND LEFT, CHESED AND GVURAH, CALLED AVRAHAM AND YITZCHAK. THE ALEPH OF AVOT (FATHERS) AND THE AYIN OF AVOT THICK TREES ARE INTERCHANGEABLE. For from TIFERET, the foundation (Yesod) of the world receives and is filled and pours unto the well, THE NUKVA, which is the land that is all water. "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 221. There are two \"willows of the brook,\" ALLUDING TO the two brooks of water, THE TWO SFIROT, NETZACH AND HOD, where the water gathers to pour upon the righteous, YESOD WHICH RECEIVES FROM NETZACH AND HOD. Another explanation: The \"willows of the brook\" are the Gvurot which hold fast to Yitzchak, THE LEFT COLUMN. They come from the supernal brook, IMA, and not from the side of Aba, THE RIGHT COLUMN, and this is why the willows are all handsome but not sweet like fruit and do not produce fruit. 222. The \"willows of the brook\" are the two pillars, NETZACH AND Hod, which support the body, yet the \"willows of the brook,\" as was explained, all pour water to the well TO GIVE TO THE NUKVA. 223. Another explanation for: \"And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of the tree Hadar\" is that it is Avraham; NAMELY CHESED. \"Branches of palm tree\" is Yitzchak, NAMELY GVURAH; \"the bough of thick leaved tree\" is Ya'akov, NAMELY TIFERET; and the \"willows of the brook\" are the two grades we mentioned, NETZACH AND HOD. 224. And this is because the thick tree is Ya'akov, who holds all the parts, THE SIX ENDS CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, AND YESOD, WHICH ARE INCLUDED WITHIN HIM, FOR WHICH REASON HE IS CALLED A THICK TREE. Assuredly, we have shown that \"the fruit of the tree Hadar\" is the well of Yitzchak, the lower Gvurah; NAMELY THE NUKVA. In \"branches (Heb. kapot) of palm trees,\" 'kapot' is spelled without VAV, WHICH MEANS IT IS TIED; NAMELY a tie upon the well, as it is written \"bound (Aramaic kephitu) in their mantles\" (Daniel 3:21), NAMELY YESOD AND NUKVA, which do not ascend without one another, AS IF THEY ARE BOUND. \"The bough of thick leaved tree\" is the supernal bough turned into a thick tree cleaving to every side; NAMELY CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, AND YESOD, FOR TIFERET IS THE BODY, CHESED-GVURAH THE ARMS, NETZACH-HOD THE LEGS, AND YESOD THE HOLY COVENANT, as we explained. The \"willows of the brook\" is Yitzchak, for on all sides they hold to the side of the brook, IMA, instead of the side of Aba. As we learned, though there are no judgments in this brook, BINAH, yet all Judgments are awakened thence. 225. Rabbi Hamnuna Saba (the elder) explained that \"willows of the brook' are the two pillars we mentioned, NETZACH AND HOD, from which water comes out. THE EXPLANATION is well, yet come and behold: we see that these two grades, NETZACH AND HOD, stand on the grade of the righteous, YESOD. Fruits and gathered blessings are issued from them; but from the willows of the brook, WHICH ALSO ALLUDE TO NETZACH AND HOD, no fruits are produced, nor taste or smell, as we already explained. And all is well. 226. Therefore WE HOLD the Etrog with the left against the heart, while Lulav is held by the right together with the other kinds all tied. For the righteous, YESOD, is united with all THE SFIROT, and bound to them all. This is the bond of faith, SHINING UPON THE NUKVA CALLED FAITH. "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 227. In the book of Agada it is well versed that all THE FOUR KINDS are the guests, THE SECRET OF THE SEVEN SFIROT CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, YESOD, AND MALCHUT, who were invited by the holy people on this day, BY PRAYING ON THE DAYS OF SUKKOT BEFORE THE MEAL AND INVITING THE SUPERNAL GUESTS. They should be there, since they were invited, and man uses them in his prayer to the King. BY THE FOUR KINDS, WHICH ALLUDE TO THESE SFIROT, ONE ATTAINS THEM. Happy are the children of Yisrael who know the ways of the holy King, and know the ways of the Torah, with which to walk the path of Truth and merit this world and the World to Come. 228. On that day, the children of Yisrael come out from before the King with certain signs; NAMELY THE FOUR KINDS, for they received a favorable judgment. What are these signs? The signs of the faith, THE SHECHINAH, the seal of the most high King, ZEIR ANPIN. It is like two men come before the king to be judged. The people in the world did not know who won. A minister came from the king's house and they asked him. He said to them, Whoever leaves THE KING'S HOUSE with the king's signs in his hands, he is the winner. 229. All the people in the world come to be judged before the most high King and He judges them on Rosh Hashanah and on the Yom Kippur until the fifteenth day of the month. Thus, it was found out that the children of Yisrael had all succeeded in repenting, and work hard in building the Sukkah and acquiring a Lulav and Etrog. It is not known who won the judgment. The supernal angels ask who has won, and the Holy One, blessed be He, says they who hold my signs in their hands, THE FOUR KINDS, have received a favorable judgment. 230. On that day, the children of Yisrael leave with a mark from the King with a song of glory and enter the Sukkah, Etrog in their left hand, a Lulav in their right. Every one sees that the children of Yisrael are written in the King's list, and open and say, \"Happy is that people, that is in such a case: happy is that people, whose Elohim is Hashem\" (Tehilim 144:15). 231. Now all rejoice, and the guests rejoice. Even the nations of the world participate in that joy and are blessed by it. Hence sacrifices are offered for them in every day, so there will be peace upon them, and they will be blessed by it. From now on, there is one day in which the highest King rejoices with the people of Yisrael, as it is written: \"On the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly\" (Bemidbar 29:35). This day comes solely from the King, who delights in the children of Yisrael as a king who has invited guests. 27. The tulip and the lily Rabbi Shimon begins the discussion by providing two explanations for this title verse. He reveals that the \"tulip of Sharon\" signifies both the congregation of Yisrael and the Malchut. Rabbi Shimon continues by explaining that the Malchut is called \"Sharon\" and that it thirsts for the water of Binah. The tulip, we are told, is also called \"the lily of the valley,\" since it changes hues when she unites with the King. This change, we learn, "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" indicates an alignment with mercy or judgment. Rabbi Shimon next proceeds by providing a description of Adam's mortal sin, the crime by which he brought punishment upon all people. We are told that in fact it was Eve who led Adam to sin and thereby, brought death to all. As punishment for this sin, both Adam and Eve, as well as the rest of humanity, became subject to constant change and eventual death. The Relevance of this Passage The Light of Binah flows into our world as we peruse this passage with a pure heart. This Light brings mercy into our lives, softening judgments. This energy of purification also helps to correct the original sin of Adam, and assists in the removal of death from the landscape of human existence. 232. Rabbi Shimon opened the discussion saying: \"I am the tulip of the Sharon; the lily of the valleys\" (Shir Hashirim 2:1). How fond is the Holy One, blessed be He, of the Congregation of Yisrael. He always praises it, and she always praises the Holy One, blessed be He, AS SAID IN SHIR HASHIRIM. How many poets and singers it summons before the Holy One, blessed be He. Happy is the portion of Yisrael, who cleave to the lot of the holy portion, as it says, \"For Hashem's portion is His people...\" (Devarim 32:9). 233. \"I am the tulip of the Sharon.\" This is the Congregation of Yisrael, NAMELY THE NUKVA, which stands in the Garden of Eden in the magnificence of her beauty. She is called Sharon, because she sings (Heb. sharah) and praises before the most high King. 234. Another explanation is that \"I am the tulip of the Sharon\" in need of watering from the deep river, the source of all springs; NAMELY BINAH, as it says, \"And the parched ground (Heb. sharav) shall become a pool\" (Yeshayah 35:7). HENCE THE NUKVA IS CALLED SHARON, DERIVED FROM SHARAV, FOR IT IS THIRSTY FOR THE WATER OF BINAH. She is called \"the lily of the valley (also: 'the deeps')\" since she is to be found very deep. The deeps are those in the verse, \"Out of the depths I have cried to you, O Hashem\" (Tehilim 130:1). \"The tulip of the Sharon\" comes from the place where the waters of the springs come and never stop flowing. \"The lily of the valley\" is from the place called the depth of all, closed on all sides. 235. Come and see: In the beginning, she is green as a tulip, which has leaves of green. Then, she is red as a lily with white shades, a lily (Heb. shoshana) of six leaves. THE WORD IS DERIVED FROM CHANGE (HEB. SHINUY), for she changes hues, changes from one color to another. 236. SHE IS CALLED a lily, THOUGH at first she was a tulip. WHEN she desired to be united with the King, she was called a tulip. Now that she is joined to the King in kisses, she is called a lily. Since it is written: \"His lips are lilies\" (Shir Hashirim 5:13), she is called \"the lily of the valley,\" for she changes colors, now for better now for worse, now for Mercy now for Judgment. "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 237. \"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes\" (Beresheet 3:6). Come and see: Men do not behold, nor do they know or care, that when the Holy One, blessed be He, created Adam, He donned him with what is most dear, THE SUPERNAL MOCHIN, and asked Adam to cleave to Him, so he will be the only one, of one heart, to cling to the place of one never-changing clinging; NAMELY ZEIR ANPIN. IT SAYS, \"FOR I AM HASHEM, I DO NOT CHANGE\" (MALACHI 3:6), which never alters, the knot to which the all embracing unison is tied. This is the meaning of \"The Tree of Life in the midst of the garden\" (Beresheet 2:10); NAMELY ZEIR ANPIN. 238. Later, they turned from the path of faith, and left the only supernal tree among the trees, NAMELY ZEIR ANPIN, and alighted upon the place which changes colors, and changes from good to evil and from evil to good, TO WIT, THE NUKVA WHEN NOT WITH ZEIR ANPIN, BUT SUCKING FROM THE LEFT ALONE. They descended downward from above, and were greatly changed. They left the only tree, the highest among the trees, as it is written: \"That the Elohim has made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions\" (Kohelet 7:29). 239. Surely then their heart was changed on that very side, FOR THEY UNDERWENT MANY CHANGES, now for good now for evil, now for Mercy now for Judgment. They clung to THE LEFT, surely seeking many inventions there, I.E. NAMELY CHANGES, and cleaved to them. 240. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Adam, you have abandoned life and clung to death. Life is, as it is written: \"The Tree of Life in the midst of the garden,\" NAMELY ZEIR ANPIN called life, for whoever cleaves to it shall never taste death. Yet you clung to another tree, THE NUKVA WHEN NOT UNITED WITH ZEIR ANPIN. Now surely death awaits you, as it is written: \"Her feet go down to death\" (Mishlei 5:5), FOR WHOEVER HAS NO MERIT IS EVIL. It is also written: \"And I find more bitter than death the woman\" (Kohelet .7:26), THE SECRET OF THE NUKVA WHEN NOT UNITED WITH ZEIR ANPIN. Surely he clung to the place of death and abandoned the place of living and was therefore doomed to death together with the rest of the world. 241. HE ASKS: If he sinned, what was the sin of the whole world, WHY WAS IT DECREED THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD WOULD DIE? If, you might say, it is because the whole world ate of this tree, and therefore were all sentenced to death, this is not so. HE ANSWERS: When Adam WAS CREATED AND stood upon his feet, all the creatures saw and feared him, and followed him like servants after the king. But he said to them, \"O come, let us worship and bow down\" (Tehilim 95:6), you and I. When they saw Adam bowing before that place, THE LEFT SIDE, and cleaving to it, they all followed him. Thus, he brought death upon the whole world. "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 242. Then was Adam changed in several ways, now Judgment, now Mercy, now to death and now to life. He never stood still in one of them, because of the nature of that place which was therefore called the revolving sword, which revolves from this to that side, from good to evil, from Mercy to Judgment, from peace to war. Usually it turns from good to evil, as it is written: \"The Tree of Knowledge of good and evil\" (Beresheet 2:9). 243. The most high King, in His love for His creatures, rebuked him saying: \"But from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it...\" (Ibid. 17), but he did not accept it and was drawn after his wife and was expelled FROM THE GARDEN OF EDEN for ever, for the woman ascended to the place OF THE REVERSAL BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH and no more. THUS the woman brought death to all. 244. Come and see: It is written of the World to Come: \"For as the days of a tree shall the days of my people be\" (Yeshayah 65:22). \"The days of a tree\" refer to the well known TREE OF LIFE, of which it says \"He will destroy death for ever\" (Yeshayah 25:8), FOR THERE ARE NO CHANGES OR DEATH IN THE TREE OF LIFE. 28. \"And the days drew near for Yisrael to die,\" part three Rabbi Chiya explains to Rabbi Yosi that when the Holy One wishes to take back a man's spirit, the days that man has lived are enumerated before Him. If this man is righteous, all the days will draw near Him without reproach. The wicked, however, cannot draw near Him since they are consumed by darkness. The name \"Yisrael\" is more complete than, and superior to, the name Ya'akov, we are told. This is why we find Yisrael rather than Ya'akov written in the title quotation. The Relevance of this Passage A rare opportunity is afforded to the readers of this mystical passage. Through the spiritual power ingrained into the name Yisrael, we receive the Light of the great patriarch, which helps merit closeness to The Creator in this world and the next, by removing the darkness created by our misdeeds and selfish actions. Moreover, we are inspired to seek higher levels of spirituality, so that we, too, can elevate from the realm of \"Ya'akov\" to \"Yisrael\" over the course of our lives. 245. \"And the days drew near for Yisrael to die.\" We learned that Rabbi Chiya said: It is written, \"And Ya'akov lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years.\" In his life, it is written Ya'akov and in his death, it says Yisrael. YET THE NAME YISRAEL IS MORE ELEVATED THAN THE NAME YA'AKOV. Rabbi Yosi said: Surely IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAID HERE YISRAEL, for it does not say, 'The day drew near,' but \"the days.\" This is difficult to understand, for a man does not die in several days; within one hour, one moment, he dies and passes away from the world. 246. HE ANSWERS: We have so learned that when the Holy One, blessed be He, wishes to take back to Him the spirit of man, all the days the man lived come before Him and are counted. When the days draw near him to be reckoned, the man dies, and the Holy One, blessed be He, takes back to Himself the spirit of man, that breath which the man breathes in and out. "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 247. Happy is the portion of the man, whose days draw near the King without reproach, and none is pushed out for containing a transgression committed in it. The reason the words 'drawing near' are used in relation to the righteous is that the days draw near the King without reproach. 248. Woe to the wicked of whom it does not say 'drawing near'. For how could their days draw near the King, when all the crimes of the world are found in them? Hence they do not draw near the King, nor come before Him or recorded above, but are consumed of themselves, as is said of them, \"The way of the wicked is like darkness: they know not at what they stumble\" (Mishlei 4:19). 249. And here it says, \"And the days drew near for Yisrael to die,\" for assuredly they drew near without shame, in complete joy. This is why it says (lit.) \"the days of Yisrael,\" AND NOT \"THE DAYS OF YA'AKOV,\" as the name Yisrael is more complete than that of Ya'akov. If you say that it is written \"and Ya'akov was a plain (lit. 'whole') man\" (Beresheet 25:27), indicating that the name Ya'akov too is whole. HE ANSWERS: THE NAME YA'AKOV IS ALSO WHOLE, but not whole on a superior grade like Yisrael is. 250. We have learned that Rabbi Yosi said: When a man's days are enumerated before the King, those of a certain righteous are enumerated far from the King, and the days of another righteous are counted close to the King. They do not stand at a distance but come in without shame and draw near the King. Happy is their portion. This is the meaning of the verse, \"And the days drew near for Yisrael to die.\" 29. \"And he called his son Yosef\" Through a discussion of the title verse, the rabbis reveal the special connection that exists between Yosef and his father Ya'akov. Not only were the two very similar in appearance, but Ya'akov also recognized Yosef's holiness and knew that he would one day be a great man. We also learn that Ya'akov was afraid to go to Egypt because he feared that in the future his children would be made slaves, that the Shechinah would leave him, and that he would be buried among the wicked. However, the Lord assured him that he would be buried in the grave of his forefathers, and Ya'akov saw that the Shechinah would dwell with Yisrael in exile. Rabbi Shimon then addresses the topic of Ya'akov's relationship with Leah and Rachel. The deception that was played out by Leah, posing as Rachel, leads to the transference of the birthright from Reuven to Yosef. This also relates to the significance of the name Reuven (lit. 'see, a son'). Rabbi Shimon then explains the holy significance of the verse, \"Put, I please you, your hand under my thigh.\" Written in connection with Avraham, Ya'akov, and Yosef, this verse alludes to the place that emits the holy seed. Finally, Rabbi Yehuda explains why Ya'akov was buried with Leah rather than Rachel. The reasons, we're told, are that Leah stood by the roadside day after day, weeping and praying that Ya'akov would marry her. Furthermore, she bore six holy tribes into the world and therefore, deserved this privilege more than Rachel. The Relevance of this Passage The story of Ya'akov entering into the land of Egypt is synonymous with the men of all generation confronting their own personal demons when they fall into negativity. As the Shechinah dwelled in the presence of Ya'akov during his sojourn in Egypt, the Light of The Creator can illumine our lives when we fall into negativity and find ourselves enslaved to dark forces. This passage is our connection to this Light. Moreover, we can share this Light with all the world and help bring about the end of the exile. The discourse concerning Ya'akov's relationship with Leah and Rachel shows us that everything that takes place within the drama of human existence has underlying meaning and that all events that transpire are necessary in the course of mankind's spiritual development. Thus, this verse instills wisdom within us to accept the things we might not understand at the present moment. It ensures that order will emerge from chaos. The Light that shines from the story concerning Leah's burial with Ya'akov inspires us to weep and yearn for the Light of The Creator, for the tears of man cause great stirrings above. "},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 251. \"And he called his son Yosef.\" Rabbi Yitzchak said: Are the other tribes not his sons? WHY DID HE CALL YOSEF ALONE? HE REPLIES: Rabbi Aba said that Yosef was his son more than the others. We have learned that when Potifar's wife begged Yosef, it is written: \"Yosef went into the house to do his work; and there was none (lit. 'no man') of the men of the house there within\" (Beresheet 39:11). This verse should have said 'there was no man', but why add \"of the men of the house\"? HE ANSWERS: This indicates the image of Ya'akov which was there. It says \"the men of the house\" to show us there was another man, NOT OF THE MEN OF THE HOUSE; NAMELY YA'AKOV. Once Yosef lifted up his eyes and saw the image of his father, his mind was settled and he withdrew. 252. Come and see the verse: \"But he refused, and said to his master's wife...\" (Beresheet 39:8). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him upon your life, another will say \"I refuse\" when he will come to bless your sons, who will be blessed by him. This is why it says, \"And his father refused, and said, 'I know it, my son, I know it'\" (Beresheet 48:19). 253. HE ASKS: Since he said, \"I know it, my son,\" why did he say again, \"I know it\"? HE ANSWERS: He said, \"I know it, my son\" meaning 'you showed through your body that you are my son, when you saw my image and returned to the holy covenant AND DID NOT DESECRATE IT'. This is why it is written: \"I know it, my son.\" THE SECOND TIME IT IS WRITTEN \"I know it\" is what you said about this one being the firstborn, TO WHICH HE ANSWERED BY \"He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great\" (Beresheet 48:19). This is why it says here: \"And he called his son Yosef\" (Beresheet 47:29), his very son Yosef SINCE HE PROVED IT BY HIS BODY, AS EXPLAINED. 254. Another explanation for: \"And he called his son Yosef.\" They looked the same, and whoever saw Yosef said he was Ya'akov's son. Rabbi Yosi said: This is exactly so, that he called him his son SINCE THEY LOOKED THE SAME. Moreover, Yosef gave food for him and his sons in his old age, for which reason he was his own son more than everyone else. \"And he called his son Yosef\": HE ASKS: Why did he call Yosef and not another one? HE ANSWERS: Because he could take him from there TO THE CAVE OF THE MACHPELAH SINCE HE WAS A KING, BUT NO ONE ELSE HAD THE AUTHORITY. 255. Rabbi Yosi said: Since Ya'akov knew his descendants would become slaves in Egypt, why was he not buried there, so that his merit would protect his children? Why did he wish to go up from there? When it says, \"As a father pities his children\" (Tehilim 103:13), where is pity then? "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 256. HE REPLIES: We have so learned that when Ya'akov went down to Egypt, he was afraid. He said: Might it come to that, heaven forbid, that my children will perish among the nations, or that the Holy One, blessed be He, will remove the Shechinah from me as before. It is written, \"And Elohim appeared to Ya'akov\" (Beresheet 35:9). \"Fear not to go down to Egypt; for I will there make of you a great nation\" (Beresheet 46:3). As for what you said, that I might remove My Shechinah from you, \"I will go down with you into Egypt\" (Ibid. 4). 257. He also said: I am afraid lest I shall be buried there and will not merit to be buried with my fathers. He answered him, \"And I will also surely bring you up again\" (Ibid.), to be buried in the grave of your fathers. 258. This is why he wanted to be taken up from Egypt. Another reason is not to be made godlike, for he saw that the Holy One, blessed be He, would take vengeance upon the deities of Egypt. He also saw that the Shechinah would dwell among his children in exile, AND THAT HE NEED NOT BE BURIED IN EGYPT TO PROTECT THEM. Another reason is that he wanted his body to dwell among the bodies of his fathers, to be with them and not with the wicked in Egypt. 259. We learned that the body of Ya'akov had its beauty from Adam, and the image of Ya'akov was of the supernal holy form, the form of the Holy Throne. Thus he did not want to be buried among the wicked. The secret of this matter is that there is no separating the patriarchs, AND THEY ARE ALWAYS TOGETHER. It is therefore written, \"I will lie with my fathers\" (Beresheet 47:30). 260. \"And he called his son Yosef.\" SCRIPTURE SAYS his son BECAUSE they had the same countenance, and also because he begot him more willingly than any other TRIBE. Come and see: It is written: \"Is it a small matter that you have taken my husband?\" (Beresheet 30:15), for Ya'akov's whole desire was for Rachel. Hence it says, \"and he called his son Yosef.\" 261. We learned: Rabbi Shimon opened the discussion saying: \"The secret things belong to Hashem our Elohim...\" (Devarim 29:28). Come and see how a man should beware sins, and be watchful lest he would transgress his Master's wishes. For we have learned that every thing a man does in this world is written in a book and reckoned before the holy King. All is known before Him, as it is written: \"'Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him?' says Hashem\" (Yirmeyah 23:24). How can a man not guard himself from sinning before his Master? We learned that even a man's thoughts and plans are all placed before the Holy One, blessed be He, and are not lost before Him. "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 262. Come and see: on the night Leah came to Ya'akov, she gave him the tokens he gave Rachel, LEST HER FATHER SHOULD REPLACE HER WITH ANOTHER. WHEN RACHEL SAW THAT HIS FATHER GIVES LEAH IN HER PLACE, AND THAT SHE DOES NOT KNOW OF THE TOKEN AND MIGHT BE PUT TO SHAME, SHE GAVE HER THE TOKENS. He thought he was with Rachel, when he had intercourse with her. It was his first drop, as it is written: \"My might and the beginning of my strength\" (Beresheet 49:3), and he thought it was Rachel. The Holy One, blessed be He, who reveals depths and mysteries, who knows what lies in the dark, brought up the desire to its place, and the birthright was gone from Reuven AND GIVEN to Yosef. Why? Because the first drop that came from Ya'akov belonged to Rachel. Since the actual birthright of Reuven belonged to her, Yosef inherited it and Rachel came into her own inheritance. 263. This is the secret reason why Reuven did not receive a name like the other sons but simply Reuven, namely Reu ven (see, a son), a son, not known by name. Leah therefore did not call him 'my son', naming him 'Reu veni' (Eng. 'see, my son'), for she knew what had happened, THAT YA'AKOV'S THOUGHTS WERE WITH RACHEL AND NOT WITH HER. 264. We learned it is known to the Holy One, blessed be He, that Ya'akov did not mean to sin by COMING INTO LEAH AND THINKING OF RACHEL, and that he never knowingly thought of another woman at that time, like the wicked men in the world. It is therefore written, \"Now the sons of Ya'akov were twelve\" (Beresheet 35:23), for the sons of the other wicked men in the world, who act in this way, are called by another name; NAMELY CHANGED CHILDREN, which is known to the friends. He therefore \"called his son Yosef,\" his own son from the beginning, REUVEN'S BIRTH, and his son in the end. "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 265. We learned that Rabbi Yosi said: What did Ya'akov use to make Yosef swear? It is written \"Put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh.\" HE ANSWERS: HE MADE HIM SWEAR by the sign of the covenant, which was stamped upon his flesh, for the patriarchs assigned it more importance than everything else, and the covenant is the secret of Yosef. TO WIT, YOSEF IS THE SECRET OF THE ATTRIBUTE OF THE RIGHTEOUS YESOD, OF WHICH HE IS A CHARIOT. 266. Rabbi Shimon said: It is written of Avraham and Ya'akov, \"Put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh,\" in the place alluded to by the Holy Name, which emits holy seed, THE SEED of faith, into the world. It is not written in connection to Yitzchak: \"PUT, I PRAY YOU, YOUR HAND UNDER MY THIGH,\" since Esav issued from him. 267. Another reason it is written: \"Put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh...bury me not, I pray you, in Egypt.\" Ya'akov said to Yosef, Swear to me by this holy impression, which emitted holy and faithful seed into the world and was always kept from being defiled, that it will never be buried among the unholy who did never keep it, of whom it says, \"Whose flesh is the flesh of asses, and whose issue is the issue of horses\" (Yechezkel 23:20). 268. It may be said that Yosef guarded his covenant more than everyone else, but why was he buried among them IN EGYPT? HE REPLIES: We have learned that it is written, \"The word of Hashem came to Yechezkel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of Casdim by the river K'var\" (Yechezkel 1:3). Yet we learned that the Shechinah does not dwell outside the land of Yisrael. Why was she revealed there? HE ANSWERS: It is written \"by the river K'var,\" FOR WATER CANNOT BE DEFILED, UNLIKE THE LAND OF NATIONS. It is also written: \"And the hand of Hashem was there upon him\" (Ibid.), WHICH IS THE SHECHINAH. Here too, Yosef's coffin was thrown into the water. The Holy One, blessed be He, said: If Yosef will be gone from here, the exile will not be carried out, FOR YISRAEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TOLERATE IT. His burial place will then be in an undefiled place, and the children of Yisrael will endure the exile. 269. We learned that Rabbi Yosi said: Ya'akov saw that the Holy Throne was fitted in every way by the patriarchs, AVRAHAM AND YITZCHAK ON RIGHT AND LEFT, AND HE IN THE CENTER. YA'AKOV said to himself, If he is to be buried here IN EGYPT, how will the body be attached to the patriarchs? Even the cave where he was to be buried is called Machpelah (from the term for 'double'), for in every thing it is double, TO THE RIGHT AND TO THE LEFT, both double and single. TO WIT, THEY ARE IN NEED OF A THIRD ONE TO BALANCE BETWEEN THEM. The cave too is both double and single, AVRAHAM AND YITZCHAK BEING ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT, AND YA'AKOV BETWEEN THEM. "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 270. Come and see: The patriarchs merited to be buried in the cave of the Machpelah together with their spouses, Ya'akov was buried with Leah. Why was Rachel not buried with him, especially when it says, \"And Rachel was barren (Heb. akarah)\" (Beresheet 29:31), which is an indication that she was the foundation (Heb. akarah) of the house? HE ANSWERS: Leah had more right FOR YA'AKOV since she bore six tribes into the world from the holy stock. Thus, she was given to him as his spouse in the cave. 271. Rabbi Yehuda said: Leah used to stand every day by the highway and weep for Ya'akov, THAT HE WOULD MARRY HER, for she heard he was righteous. She thus prepared herself through prayer. It says, \"And Leah's eyes were weak\" (Beresheet 29:16), since she rose early and sat by the highway to pray. 272. Rachel never went to the highway TO ASK TO BE MARRIED TO YA'AKOV, LIKE LEAH DID. For this Leah was privileged to be buried with him, and Rachel is by the highway, buried there. This is the meaning of the words \"And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me.\" What is \"by me\"? It means \"because of me in the land of Cna'an on the way.\" Because of me, she died on the way, for she never went out for my sake TO PRAY like her sister. 273. Since Leah went and wept by the highway for Ya'akov, she merited to be buried with him. Rachel, who did not want to go out to pray for him, was therefore buried by the highway. The secret of this matter is that the one is disclosed and the other undisclosed. 274. Come and see: The righteous Leah shed many tears in order to be the portion of Ya'akov instead of that of the evil Esav. Hence, we learned that any man who sheds tears before the Holy One, blessed be He, even if punishment was already given, will have the verdict annulled, and the punishment will not have any effect upon him. Whence do we know that? From Leah, for it was decreed that Leah would be in the portion of Esav, but through her prayer she was married to Ya'akov, and not to Esav. 275. Rabbi Chiya said: \"And I will lie with my fathers...\" Rabbi Yitzchak opened the discussion with the verse, \"What profit has a man of all his labor wherein he labors under the sun?\" (Kohelet 1:3). We have studied several times the words of Solomon, and they do not seem to be understood, for all his words should be read with wisdom. 30. And the Wisdom of Solomon excelled "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" Here we learn that during the days of King Solomon, the Malchut grew, was blessed, and attained fullness. Consequently, the wisdom of Solomon excelled that of the children of the east, who inherited their wisdom from Avraham, derived from the lower Crowns. Hadar was the only king of the east country who endured because he was composed of both male and female and he maintained the Malchut. There follows a description of the awesome form of Malchut [Female Principle] and her son Matatron, the son of Yered. We learn that the comets fastened to the hairs of the moon are the scourge by which the world is sentenced, and the nails of the Female Principle write and record the transgressions of men under strict judgment. Finally, Rabbi Chiya comments on the verse, \"What profit has a man of all his labor\" The Relevance of this Passage The wisdom of King Solomon shines into our physical world [Malchut], helping mankind achieve its final correction. Solomon's wisdom is founded upon the Three Column System, whereas the spiritual teachings of the East are based upon Two Column System, such as Yin and Yang. The third and Central Column creates resistance between the two positive and negative columns of energy, like a filament in a light bulb--that generates spiritual Light for the entire planet. This Light shines forth in this passage and helps sweeten judgments decreed against mankind. 276. We studied the verse, \"And Solomon's Wisdom excelled\" (I Melachim 5:10). During the days of King Solomon, the moon, NAMELY THE NUKVA, was in her fullness. Hence it is written, \"And Solomon's Wisdom excelled the Wisdom of all the children of the east country.\" Regarding this, we learned who the children of the east were. It has already been explained. Nevertheless, the wisdom of the children of the east is the Wisdom they inherited from Avraham. 277. We learned: It is written, \"And Avraham gave all that he had to Yitzchak\" (Beresheet 35:5). HE ASKS: What was \"all that he had\" WHICH HE GAVE TO YITZCHAK? HE ANSWERS: It is supernal Wisdom, for he knew the name of the Holy One, blessed be He. This may be understood from the verse: \"All that he had,\" for the supernal Wisdom is his, in the same way we learned of the daughter he had named Bakol (lit. 'in everything'), THE SECRET OF THE NUKVA. 278. \"But to the sons of the concubines, which Avraham had, Avraham gave gifts\" (Beresheet 35:6). He gave them certain knowledge from the lower crowns and settled them in the east country. From this, the children of the east country inherited Wisdom, I.E. FROM THE LOWER CROWNS, as it is written: \"The wisdom of all the children of the east country.\" 279. We learned that one day Rabbi Shimon came from Cappadocia to Lod. Rabbi Aba and Rabbi Yehuda came with him. Rabbi Aba was tired running after Rabbi Shimon who was mounted. He said: \"They shall walk after Hashem, who shall roar like a lion\" (Hoshea 11:10). 280. Rabbi Shimon dismounted and said to him: Indeed it is written, \"Then I abode in the mountain forty days and forty nights\" (Devarim 9:9). Surely wisdom does not settle upon man when he walks but when he just sits down. We have already explained why it says, \"I abode (or: sat)\" and now we should rest. They sat down. "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 281. Rabbi Aba said: It is written: \"And Solomon's Wisdom excelled the Wisdom of all the children of the east country and all the Wisdom of Egypt.\" What is the Wisdom of Solomon, the Wisdom of Egypt and the Wisdom of the east country? He said to him, Come and behold: we have explained in several places in regard to the name of the moon, NAMELY THE NUKVA. When it is blessed by all THE SFIROT, it is written \"excelled.\" THIS WAS SAID in the days of Solomon, THE NUKVA grew and was blessed and reached her fullness. 282. We have learned that a thousand mountains grow GRASS before her, and she swallows them in one bite; a thousand great rivers she has, which she swallows in one gulp. 283. Her nails reach 1,070 directions, her hands hold four and twenty directions. None escapes her to the RIGHT side and none escapes her to the LEFT side, BUT THROUGH THE MIDDLE. Many thousands shields cling to her hairs. 284. A youth, whose height is from the top of the world to its bottom, NAMELY MATATRON, WHOSE HEIGHT IS FROM THE HEAD OF BRIYAH TO THE BOTTOM OF ASIYAH, comes from between her legs, NETZACH AND HOD OF THE NUKVA, clothed in sixty clubs of fire, BY WHICH HE DRIVES AWAY THE EXTERNALS SO THEY WOULD NOT CLING TO THE LEGS OF THE NUKVA. In this way, he is in charge over the lower beings of the four sides. This is the youth, who holds 613 upper keys on the side of Ima. All the supernal keys dangle from the sharp sword girded about his waist. 285. This youth is called Chanoch the son of Yered in the Braita, as it is written: \"Train up (Chanoch) a youth in the way he should go\" (Mishlei 22:6). It may be said it is written in the Mishnah, not in the Braita. Yet we explained it when studying the Mishnah, and this has been explained. They all looked into the same thing. Under HIS SHADE, the beasts of the field shall find shelter; NAMELY THE ANGELS OF YETZIRAH we learned of, like Supernal Holy Yisrael- NAMELY ZEIR ANPIN, called 'the son of his mother', BINAH. It is written, \"For I was my father's son, tender and the only one in the sight of my mother\" (Mishlei 4:3), and \"Yisrael is my son, my firstborn\" (Shemot 4:22), WHICH REFERS TO ZEIR ANPIN. Underneath ATZILUT, MATATRON is too called the son of his mother, THE NUKVA, as it is written \"Yisrael was a youth, then I loved him\" (Hoshea 11:1), WHICH REFERS TO MATATRON. He was named the son of Yered for several reasons, I.E., NOW TO SHAME HIM AND NOW TO RECOMMEND, as we have already explained. Yet come and behold: HERE WE SPEAK OF the very son of Yered (lit. 'descent'), for we have learned that the Shechinah descended to the earth by ten steps (Heb. yeridot), all of them explained by the friends. Underneath, several Livng Creatures are standing; NAMELY THE ANGELS OF YETZIRAH, which are called the very beasts of the field. "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 286. Under these Livng Creatures are fastened the hairs of the moon, THE NUKVA, called the comets (Heb. Shevet), a very scourge (Heb. Shevet); TO WIT, THEY ARE CONSIDERED THE SCOURGE WITH WHICH THE WORLD IS SENTENCED. THEY ARE DIVIDED INTO the accusers, the weighty, those of STRICT Judgment, and the impudent. They are all called hairy. Her hands and feet hold on to it like a mighty lion holding its prey, of which it says \"and tears in pieces, and none can deliver\" (Michah 5:7). 287. Her nails are the ones who call to mind the sins of men, who write and record their transgression under strict judgment. Of this says the verse: \"The sin of Yehuda is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond\" (Yirmeyah 17:1). What is the diamond? HE ANSWERS: That which imprints and carves the stone, and hews in it on all sides. 288. The filth of the nails REFERS TO those who do not cleave to the body of the King, THE CENTRAL COLUMN, BUT CLEAVE TO THE LEFT and suck from the side of defilement when the moon is diminished, TO WIT, WHEN THE ABUNDANCE THEN DRAWN FROM THE NAILS PASSES TO THE SIDE OF DEFILEMENT, AND CONSIDERED THE FILTH OF THE NAILS. 289. Since King Solomon inherited the moon at her fullness, THE NUKVA IN GREATNESS, he ought to inherit her when she is defective. He therefore strove to know about the spirits and demons, in order to receive the moon, THE NUKVA, in all her aspects. 290. In the days of King Solomon, the moon shone from all the grades, as it is written: \"And Solomon's Wisdom excelled (also: 'increased'),\" meaning that it was greater than the Wisdom of all the children of the east country SINCE IT WAS INCLUDED WITHIN THE NUKVA, AND ALSO THE WISDOM OF EGYPT WAS COMPRISED IN IT AND THE WISDOM OF THE CHILDREN OF THE EAST. This is a supernal secret, in accordance with the verse, \"And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom\" (Beresheet 36:31). They were all called the children of the east country. None of them endured except he who was comprised of male and female, who was called Hadar. For it says, \"And Hadar reigned in his place...AND HIS WIFE'S NAME...\" (Ibid. 39). BUT NO WOMAN WAS MENTIONED IN RELATION TO THE OTHER KINGS. 291. We have learned that though the Nukva was maintained BY KING HADAR, she nevertheless did not illuminate wholly until the time of King Solomon, who was worthy of her, as we explained, for his mother was Bat-sheva (lit. 'daughter of seven,') TO WIT, THE NUKVA WAS CALLED IN HER GREATNESS DAUGHTER OF SEVEN, SINCE SHE INCLUDES CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, YESOD, AND MALCHUT OF ZEIR ANPIN, BEING HIS MOTHER. HE WAS THEREFORE WORTHY OF INHERITING HER IN HER DAYS OF GREATNESS. "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 292. \"And all the Wisdom of Egypt.\" This is the lower Wisdom called 'the maid behind the millstones.' The Wisdom of Solomon included everything, the Wisdom of the children of the east country together with the Wisdom of Egypt. Rabbi Aba said: Blessed be the Merciful One, that I have asked about it, and so merited all these words. Rabbi Shimon said: I have explained this subject, and we already interpreted it. 293. We learned: \"What profit has a man of all his labor wherein he labors.\" One may say that this is true also for laboring in the Torah. Yet it is said \"wherein he labors under the sun,\" and the labor in the Torah is different by being above the sun, OF THE SUPERNAL ONE. Rabbi Chiya said: This is true also for the Torah, THE WORDS \"WHAT PROFIT...\" if it is done for the sake of people or to gain respect. Of this, it is said \"under the sun,\" for this study of the Torah does not ascend. We learned that Rabbi Elazar said: Even if a man lives to a thousand years, on the day he departs from the world, it would seem to him as if he lived but one day. 31. \"And I will lie with my fathers\" Rabbi Yehuda begins by explaining the significance of each day with or without sin for the individual. We learn that if man sins and repents, that day returns to its place. However, if he does not repent, that day ascends to bear testimony to this sin, then descends, joins with the spirit outside, and brings evil to that man. At the end of his days, man's soul is clothed with the days in which he did not sin. If there are none, he is sentenced to Gehenom, wherein he is punished two days for each day of sin. We learn that Adam repented for his great sin, although he did not completely repair the damage his sin caused. Therefore, the Lord accepted his repentance and clothed him with garments that were not made from his days. In contrast, Avraham wore a complete raiment of glory when he departed this world, since he merited it. Ya'akov also merited to be clothed in his own days. Indeed, his garments were scented with the perfume of the Female Principle, as signified by the verse, \"And he smelled the smell of his garments\" Rabbi Elazar then explains to Rabbi Yehuda that three garments are made for man from his days. These are worn by the Ruach, the Neshamah, and the Nefesh. Rabbi Elazar explains the relationship between, and the significance of, these bodies. Rabbi Shimon directs the final portion of the discussion. He says that the companions of Bavel listen and learn from him, but do not share these matters with others. The reason for this, we are told, is that they are outside the Holy Land and do not draw from Holiness. Rabbi Shimon then warns us of the time when people abandon the study of the Torah and the scrolls are moved. Without the wisdom of the scholars and without the righteous to arouse the souls to pray for the living, the people of the world will be punished by the accusers-- unless all people do penance for their sins. Rabbi Yehuda explains that when the world is in distress and is in need of mercy, the scroll of the Torah must be stirred. Then, the Nefesh informs the Ruach, the Ruach the Neshamah, and lastly, the Neshamah informs the Holy One. The Lord then draws the crystal dew to flow upon the sleeping patriarchs who join in and pray for the world. Only then does the Lord have mercy on the world. The Relevance of this Passage Each day in our lives presents us with opportunities to fulfill our personal spiritual mission in life and complete our transformation. Unfortunately, most people fail to realize the meaning of life and the purpose of their existence. Each lost opportunity creates a negative blockage that diminishes and dims the Light of The Creator in our lives. It is within this expanding darkness that turmoil, hardship, pain, and suffering are born. Thus, it behooves a man to awaken to the spiritual truths of his existence, so that he may develop himself spiritually. This passage ignites that awareness in our consciousness. It helps to remove the negative blockages and darkness created by our lack of action in previous times, while arousing penitence in our hearts for our unkind behavior. Moreover, the Light of the Torah is set aflame, drawing to us both mercy and protection. "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 294. \"And I will lie with my fathers.\" Happy is the portion of the patriarchs, for the Holy One, blessed be He, made them into a Holy Chariot, and desired to be crowned with them. Hence it is written, \"Only in your fathers Hashem took delight...\" (Devarim 10:15). Rabbi Elazar said: Ya'akov knew that he was to be crowned by his fathers for they would be crowned with him, and he with them. We learned regarding the engraved letters that Shin has three knots, two knots on both sides, RIGHT AND LEFT, and one knot that binds them together, THE MIDDLE ONE. This we learned from the verse: \"And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end to end\" (Shemot 26:28), that the knot in the middle is attached to the RIGHT side and the LEFT side. Hence it says, \"And I will lie with my fathers.\" 295. \"And I will lie with my fathers.\" Rabbi Yehuda opened the discussion with the verse, \"Hear, O deaf; and look, O blind, that you may see\" (Yeshayah 42:18). \"Hear, O deaf\" refers to the men who neither listen to the words of the Torah, nor open their ears to hearken the precepts of their Master. The blind are those who do not look to know wherefore they live. For every day, a crier comes and proclaims, yet no one pays attention. 296. We have learned that man's days already exist from the day he was born into the world, FOR THEY ARE REAL ILLUMINATIONS, FROM WHICH MAN'S DAYS ARE DRAWN. They go about the world and descend to warn man, each day in its turn. When the day comes to warn the man, yet the man commits a sin on that day, it ascends shamefacedly and bears testimony on him, and stands outside alone. 297. We have learned that after it was put to stand alone OUTSIDE, it sits and waits for the man to repent HIS SIN. If the man repented, the day returns to its place; but if he did not merit AND ATONE, the day descends, joins the spirit outside and comes back to his house, putting on the same appearance as the man to bring evil upon him. THE DAY sits with him in his house, and if he has the merit TO REPENT, it brings him good, but if not, it brings him evil. 298. In either case, when that man's days are accounted they are in want, and those are not numbered because of the sins. Woe to the man who diminished the number of his days before the holy King, and has no days above with which to be crowned in that world, to approach the holy King. "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 299. Come and see: When his days come before the holy King, if the man who passed away from the world be righteous, he ascends and comes in with these days that are the raiments of glory which his soul is clothed in. For he merited these days, by not committing any sin therein. 300. Woe to the man who reduced the number of his days above. For when he is to don his days, the days he spoilt by his sins are missing from that garment, and he wears a defective costume. All the more so if they are many, THE DAYS WHICH WERE SPOILT, and that man has nothing to be clad in that world. Woe to him, woe to his soul, for he is sentenced to Gehenom on account of these days, days upon days; HE IS PUNISHED TWO days for every SINGLE day. When he departs from the world he finds no day in which to be clad, and has no garment or covering. Happy are the righteous, whose days are all stored with the holy King, and made into raiments of glory to don in the World to Come. 301. We have studied according to the secret of the Mishnah, the words, \"And they knew that they were naked\" (Beresheet 3:7). They knew exactly that the raiment of glory made of the days was impaired, and no day was left in which to be clad. Hence it says, \"Your eyes did see my unshaped flesh; for in your book all things are written, the days also in which they are to be fashioned\" (Tehilim 139:16), WHICH ALLUDES TO ADAM. \"The days...to be fashioned\" FOR HIM TO WEAR, \"and for it too there was one of them\" (Ibid.), for he had none left in which to be clad. Then, Adam strove to repent and the Holy One, blessed be He, accepted his repentance and formed for him another vessel and garment, not made from his days BECAUSE HE DID NOT COMPLETELY REPAIR BY HIS ATONEMENT THE SIN OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE. Hence it says, \"For the man also and for his wife did Hashem Elohim make coats of skins, and clothed them\" (Beresheet 3:21). 302. Come and see the merit of Avraham. It is written, \"And Avraham... (lit.) came with days\" (Beresheet 24:1). Since he had the merit, when he departed from this world, he came with his own days and wore them. Nothing was lacking in that raiment of glory, as it says \"came with days.\" Of Iyov it says, \"Naked I came out of my mother's womb and naked I shall return there\" (Iyov 1:21), for nothing was left for him to wear. "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 303. We learned that happy are the righteous, whose days are clean FROM SINS and remain for the World to Come. Upon leaving THIS WORLD, they all join together and turn into a raiment of glory to be clothed in. In this raiment, they can be delighted with the pleasure of the World to Come. Through the garment, they will rise into the world AT THE RESURRECTION FROM THE DEAD. All those with a raiment will rise, as it says, \"And they stand as a garment\" (Iyov 38:14). Woe to the wicked in the world, whose days were diminished through sins, and nothing is left from them to be covered with when they leave this world. 304. We learned that the righteous who were privileged to don the raiment of glory made of their days, are crowned in that world by the same crowns the fathers were adorned with, from the river that flows and comes into the Garden of Eden. This is the meaning of the words: \"And Hashem shall guide you continually, and satisfy your soul in drought\" (Yeshayah 58:11). But of the wicked men in the world, who had not the merit to be dressed with the garment from their days, it says, \"For he shall be like the juniper tree in the desert, and shall not see when good comes; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness\" (Yirmeyah 17:6). 305. Rabbi Yitzchak said: Happy is the portion of Ya'akov, who had the greatest faith, as it is written: \"And I will lie with my fathers,\" for he deserved them, not another, to be clad in his own days and theirs. 306. Rabbi Yehuda said: It is written, \"And he smelt the smell of his garments, and blessed him\" (Beresheet 27:27). HE ASKS: It says \"his garments\" while it should have been 'Esav's garments,' for the garments were not his but Esav's, as it is written: \"And Rivkah took the best clothes of her eldest son, Esav\" (Ibid. 15). Yet here it says \"the smell of his garments,\" which means Ya'akov's. 307. HE ANSWERS: We have explained that \"he smelt\" means that he looked further and smelt the smell of his garments in the world of Truth, and then blessed him. Therefore it is written, \"See, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field\" (Beresheet 27:27), the field of holy apple trees, THE NUKVA OF ZEIR ANPIN. He was saying: Since you deserve to wear these raiments of glory, \"therefore the Elohim give you of the dew of heaven\" (Ibid. 28). HE ASKS: Does this mean THAT THE DEW OF HEAVEN DEPENDS UPON THE RAIMENTS OF GLORY? HE REPLIES: Since the field of apple trees, WHICH RESEMBLES THE RAIMENTS OF GLORY IN SMELL, receives dew everyday from the place called heaven, ZEIR ANPIN, as it is written \"the dew of heaven.\" HE THEREFORE SAID: SINCE YOU ARE WORTHY OF DONNING THE RAIMENTS OF GLORY, \"ELOHIM GIVE YOU OF THE DEW OF HEAVEN. "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 308. Rabbi Yosi said: He blessed him in everything, \"of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth.\" TO WIT, ALSO FROM THE ABUNDANCE OF THE NUKVA CALLED EARTH. What was the reason for that? Because \"he smelt the smell of his garments,\" his own garments as we explained, AND THESE GARMENTS RECEIVE ALSO FROM THE NUKVA. We learned that 1,500 odors rise every day from the Garden of Eden, THE NUKVA, and perfume the raiments of glory, which are crowned with the man's days in that world, SINCE THE GARMENTS RECEIVE ALSO FROM THE NUKVA. 309. Rabbi Yehuda said: How many garments are MADE FOR MAN FROM HIS DAYS? Rabbi Elazar said: There is a controversy over this point, but there are three. The first is the garments the Ruach dons in the terrestrial Garden of Eden. The Neshamah is clothed in another, the most precious, WHICH LIVES inside the bundle of life; NAMELY NUKVA amidst the purple cloak of the King. The last one is the external garment, which exists and exists not, seen yet not seen, FOR BEING EXTERNAL IT HAS NO CONTINUOUS EXISTENCE, BUT NOW IT IS SEEN AND NOW IT IS NOT. The Nefesh wears this garment when it goes and hovers about the world. 310. In every new moon and Shabbat, THE NEFESH goes to be attached to the Ruach in the terrestrial Garden of Eden, which stands in the midst of the precious curtain. From it, THE NEFESH studies and receives its knowledge, and then it hovers and announces it to the world. 311. We learned that the Nefesh is attached by two knots on every new moon and Shabbat: 1) to the Ruach amidst the odors of perfumes in the terrestrial Garden of Eden 2) from there, THE NEFESH roams and goes to attach itself with the Ruach in the Neshamah, which is bound in the bundle of life. There it slacks its thirst and eats of the precious lights on this and that side, RIGHT AND LEFT. This is written in the verse: \"And Hashem guide you continually\" (Yeshayah 58:11). \"Continually\" is precise, INDICATING THAT IT RECEIVES FROM ALL SIDES CONTINUOUSLY. 312. \"And satisfy your soul (Nefesh) in drought (Heb. tzachtzachot).\" HE ASKS: What is \"tzachtzachot\"? HE ANSWERS: One tzach (Eng. 'bright) it receives while attached to the Ruach in the terrestrial Garden of Eden; it receives the tzach inside tzach, when attached to the Neshamah above in the bundle of life. This is the meaning of tzachtzachot: tzach is singular, and tzachot dual. They are high above, in the preciousness of the Neshamah. Who will inherit the tzachtzachot? SCRIPTURE SAYS \"your soul (Nefesh).\" Your Nefesh indeed INHERITS THEM FROM THE NESHAMAH. Happy is the portion of the righteous. 313. Rabbi Shimon said: When I am with the friends of Babylon, they gather round me and learn things openly, but they put them (these matters) in a sealed iron box, closed on all sides--IN OTHER WORDS, THEY CONCEAL THEM SO NO ONE WOULD KNOW. "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 314. How many times did I teach them the ways of the King's garden, THE NUKVA, and the ways of the King, ZEIR ANPIN? How many times did I teach them about the grades of the righteous in that world? They are all fearful of talking of these matters, but mumble instead. They are therefore called mumblers, I.E. SLOW OF SPEECH, for they mumble as stammerers. 315. But I see it in a favorable light, for they are afraid because the holy air and the Holy Spirit are gone for them, SINCE THEY ARE OUTSIDE THE LAND OF YISRAEL. And they breathe in the air and spirit of another region THAN THAT OF HOLINESS. Moreover, the rainbow is seen above them, WHICH IS A SIGN THEY ARE UNDER JUDGMENT AND ARE IN NEED OF MERCY, AS IT IS WRITTEN: \"I HAVE SET MY BOW...AND I WILL LOOK UPON IT, THAT I MAY REMEMBER THE EVERLASTING COVENANT\" (BERESHEET 9:13- 16). They are then not deemed worthy of receiving Eliyahu, let alone someone else. 316. But it is beneficent to them that I live in the world and support it, for during my lifetime the world will not be sorrowful, nor suffer Judgment from above. After me, there will never be such a generation as this. The world will be such that there will be no one to protect them, and there will be impudence both above and below. Above ALSO THERE WILL BE IMPUDENT COUNTENANCES, WHICH ARE THE ACCUSATIONS OF THE KLIPOT, because of the transgressions below and their impudence. 317. The people in the world will cry out, but there will be no one to protect them. They will look to all the directions of the world TO FIND RELIEF, but shall not return with a remedy TO THEIR TROUBLES. I have found but one remedy in the world and no more, wherever there will be people who are occupied in the Torah, and a scroll of the Torah with them, without any error. When it will be taken out, the upper and lower beings will be roused, especially if the Holy Name wherein is properly written, as we have already learned. 318. Woe to the generation, where the scroll of the Torah is banished BY BEING TAKEN OUT TO THE STREETS IN ORDER TO PRAY. But no one was awakened above or below, FOR THEIR PRAYER WAS NOT ACCEPTED, FOR IT WAS NOT JOINED BY FASTING OR ATONEMENT BELOW. HE ASKS: Who shall be roused to pray when the world is in great sorrow and in need of rain as the scroll of the Torah is further banished because of the hardship in the world. 319. HE ANSWERS: When the world is in sorrow and people ask for mercy by the graves, all the dead are aroused to ask on behalf of the world, for the Nefesh hastens to tell the Ruach that the scroll of the Torah is in exile, and has been exiled due to hardship in the world, and the living have come TO THE GRAVES to ask for mercy. "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 320. Then the Ruach informs the Neshamah, and the Neshamah the Holy One, blessed be He. Then is the Holy One, blessed be He, aroused in pity on the world. All this is caused by the exile of the scroll of the Torah from its place, WHEN the living came to ask for mercy upon the graves of the dead. Woe to the generation, which must exile the scroll of the Torah from place to place, or even from one synagogue to another IN ORDER TO PRAY, for there will be no one among them to take care of them AND PRAY FOR THEM, SINCE THERE ARE NO RIGHTEOUS AMONG THEM. 321. Yet no man knows THE REASON FOR this. For when the Shechinah was exiled the last time, in order not to go up above, it is written THAT SHE SAID: \"Oh, that I were in the wilderness, in a lodging place of wayfaring men\" (Yirmeyah 9:1), AND NOT GONE ABOVE. FOR SHE WISHED TO EXILE WITH YISRAEL. Later, WHEN SHE ALREADY WAS IN EXILE WITH YISRAEL, in a time of great distress for the world, she was IN THE DESERT, THE ABODE OF THE KLIPOT. Also in the exile of the scroll of the Torah she is there in the desert, and everyone is stirred AND SUFFERS for her, the upper and lower beings. 322. Rabbi Shimon said: Had those stupid Babylonians known the secret verses of Wisdom, such as why the world exists, or why its supporting pillars quake when it is in distress, they would know the worth of Rav Hamnuna Saba, who dwelt among them, without their knowing his worth. I find that his words are connected to those of King Solomon in the high secret of Wisdom, but they did not guess his worth. 323. Now they strive after words of wisdom but there is no one to uncover THEIR SECRET, and no one to teach it. With all that, there are sages among them in the field of establishing the beginning of months and the intercalation of years, though it is not their duty TO INTERCALATE THE YEARS AND SANCTIFY THE MONTHS, WHICH ARE FIXED ONLY IN THE LAND OF YISRAEL. 324. We have learned that the Nefesh is attached to the body inside the grave for twelve months, and they are judged together, except the Nefesh of the righteous, as we explained. It dwells inside the grave and feels pain OF PUNISHMENT, and the pain of the living, yet it does not strive TO PRAY for them. 325. After twelve months, the Nefesh dons a garment and goes to roam about the world, and learns certain things from the Ruach. It strives to ask for mercy for the world's pain, and to feel the sorrow of the living. "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 326. HE ASKS: Who arouses all that, THE NEFASHOT OF THE DEAD TO PRAY FOR THE LIVING? HE REPLIES: When there is a righteous man in the world, he duly informs them. The righteous is well known among them. For we have learned that when there remains a righteous man in the world, known among the living and the dead, he is proclaimed every day. When the world is in great distress and he cannot protect the people, he informs them of the pain in the world AND THEY ASK FOR MERCY UPON THE LIVING. 327. When there is no proclaimed righteous among them and no one to stir THE NEDASHOT about the sorrow of the world but a scroll of the Torah, then the upper and lower are stirred for its sake TO PRAY FOR THE WORLD. Yet at that time, everyone should do penance, for if they do not, the accusers are aroused upon them TO PUNISH THEM FOR MOVING ABOUT THE SCROLL OF THE TORAH. THIS APPLIES NOT ONLY FOR THE NEFESH, as Ruach in the Garden of Eden is also stirred for the sake of the scroll of the Torah TO ASK FOR MERCY, as we have learned. 328. We learned: \"And I will lie with my fathers\"; namely in body, Nefesh, Ruach, and Neshamah, all included within one Chariot of a high grade. TO WIT, THE VERSE ALLUDES TO THE BODY AND ALL THE ASPECTS OF THE SOUL, WHICH WILL BE TOGETHER WITH HIS FATHERS. Rabbi Yehuda said: How senseless are the children in the world who do not know, nor care, hear or see what happens in the world, that the Holy One, blessed be He, is filled with Mercy for the world at any time and season. But no one pays attention. 329. Three times a day, a certain spirit comes into the cave of the Machpelah and breathes over the tombs of the fathers so that their bones are healed and they endure. The spirit draws dew from over the King's head, CHOCHMAH, BINAH, AND DA'AT OF ZEIR ANPIN, where the supernal patriarchs are. When the dew flows in, the lower patriarchs are awakened IN THE CAVE OF THE MACHPELAH. 330. We have learned that the dew flows down certain grades, one grade after another, and reaches the lower Garden of Eden, where the perfumes are bathed in it. Then is a certain spirit awakens, which comprises two others; NAMELY A SPIRIT OF THE CENTRAL COLUMN, YA'AKOV, WHICH INCLUDES THE TWO COLUMNS, AVRAHAM AND YITZCHAK. It ascends and hovers above the perfumes and comes in through the opening of the cave. Then the patriarchs are awakened with their wives and ask for Mercy for their children. "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 331. When the world is in distress AND NOT ANSWERED, and due to its sins THE PATRIARCHS sleep and the dew does not arouse them, for it cannot be found or drawn. THEN, when the scroll of the Torah is stirred in the world, the Nefesh informs the Ruach, the Ruach the Neshamah, which tells the Holy One, blessed be He. The King then sits on the throne of mercy and draws from the supernal Atika Kadisha, ARICH ANPIN, the crystal dew, which flows upon the King's head, CHOCHMAH, BINAH, AND DA'AT OF ZEIR ANPIN, and the patriarchs, CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET OF ZEIR ANPIN, are blessed. The dew then flows upon the sleeping FATHERS IN THE CAVE OF THE MACHPELAH, who then join IN PRAYING FOR THE WORLD. The Holy One, blessed be He, then has Mercy upon the world. We have learned the Holy One, blessed be He, does not have mercy on the world until He notifies the Patriarchs, and for their merit the world is blessed. Rabbi Yosi said: Surely this is so. I also found it in the book of King Solomon, the high one who is called every MAN'S wise counsel, AS IT SAYS, \"FOR HE WAS WISER THAN ALL MEN\" (I MELACHIM 5:11). 332. Rav Hamnuna also said the same and that it was revealed to him in a dream, that Rachel achieved more THAN ALL THE PATRIARCHS by standing at the highway whenever the world is in need OF MERCY. The secret of this matter is that the ark, its covering and the Cherubs are in the portion of Binyamin, RACHEL'S SON, who was born on the highway, and the Shechinah is above ALL HIS PORTION, AS IT SAYS, \"HE SHALL COVER HIM ALL THE DAY LONG\" (DEVARIM 33:12). 32. \"And Yisrael bowed himself upon the bed's head\" Rabbi Shimon begins the discussion by explaining that the bed in the title verse signifies the foundation of the world, and the bed's head signifies the Shechinah. We learn that by his action, Yisrael bowed to the Supernal Throne. Rabbi Yehuda then explains that although Ya'akov's soul departed while he was still in Egypt, it was united with the Shechinah and his body was buried alongside the patriarchs, as he had wished. The text then addresses the verse, \"And Yosef shall put his hand on your eyes.\" Rabbi Yesa reveals that this verse indicates both Ya'akov's importance and that his son would be alive at the time of Ya'akov's death. Rabbi Chizkiyah then speaks about the custom of a man's son putting dust on his father's eyes as a sign of respect when he dies. This leads to a discourse on the symbolic significance of each color of the eye. After offering further explanations for the custom of closing a man's eyes after his death, the conversation turns to the subject of the Nefesh of the departed soul. Finally, the rabbis return to the spiritual significance of Ya'akov's actions described in the title verse. The Relevance of this Passage The Light of the Shechinah is summoned into our world, helping The reader climb out of darkness and negativity [Egypt], and in doing so, merit closeness to the great patriarchs in the world to come. These verses also help elevate the souls of our fathers if they have passed on. 333. \"And Yisrael bowed himself upon the bed's head.\" HE ASKS: What is the bed's head? HE ANSWERS: It is the Shechinah, WHICH IS ALWAYS PRESENT AT THE HEAD OF A SICK MAN. Rabbi Shimon said: Heaven forbid THAT HE WAS BOWING DOWN BEFORE THE SHECHINAH, SINCE HE WAS A CHARIOT OF TIFERET, WHICH IS ABOVE THE SHECHINAH. He bowed to his own attribute, TIFERET. HE EXPLAINS HIS WORDS: Come and behold: the bed is the Shechinah, of which it says, \"Behold it his litter, that of Solomon\" (Shir Hashirim 3:7). The bed's head is the foundation (Yesod) of the world, the head of the sacred bed, THE SHECHINAH; the head refers to Yisrael, TIFERET, standing at the bed's head, WHICH IS YESOD, FOR TIFERET IS ABOVE YESOD, and therefore Yisrael bowed to himself, NAMELY TO TIFERET. "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 334. You might say THAT HE BOWED DOWN TO THE SHECHINAH, WHICH IS ABOVE THE HEAD OF A SICK MAN. At that time, he was not yet ill, only later. It is written: \"And it came to pass after these things, that one told Yosef, 'Behold, your father is sick.'\" But when he bowed down, he was not sick. Of necessity, he bowed down because he knew that he then ascended to the holy supernal grade of the whole throne TIFERET. He therefore bowed down to that Chariot, the supernal throne. FOR CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET ARE THE SUPERNAL THRONE OF BINAH, AND TIFERET IS INCLUDED OF THEM ALL. It is the perfection of the great and strong tree which is named after him, NAMELY TIFERET CALLED YISRAEL AFTER HIS NAME. Therefore, \"Yisrael bowed himself upon the bed's head,\" for surely he was elevated into his own grade and adorned with crowns, MOCHIN, of the holy King TIFERET. 335. \"And he said: 'Swear to me.' And he swore to him. And Yisrael bowed himself upon the bed's head.\" Rabbi Chiya opened the discussion saying: \"All this have I proved by Wisdom: I said, 'I will be wise'; but it was far from me\" (Kohelet 7:23). We have learned that King Solomon inherited the moon, THE NUKVA, together with all her aspects. In his days the moon was in fullness, being blessed by all THE GRADES. When he wanted to understand the statutes of the Torah he said: \"I said, 'I will be wise'; but it was far from me.\" 336. Rabbi Yehuda said: Ya'akov said, \"And I will lie with my fathers, not, I pray you, in Egypt: but I will lie with my fathers and you shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their place of burial.\" In connection to this, we learned that a man whose soul departed in another domain, NAMELY OUTSIDE THE LAND OF YISRAEL, and whose body was buried in the Holy Land, scripture says of him: \"But when you entered, you defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination\" (Yirmeyah 2:7). Yet Ya'akov said: \"And bury me in their place of burial,\" though his soul departed in another domain, IN EGYPT. 337. Rabbi Yehuda said: Ya'akov is different THAN OTHER MEN, since the Shechinah held him and cleaved to him. This is the meaning of the words, \"I will go down with you into Egypt\" (Beresheet 46:4) to dwell with you in exile \"and I will also surely bring you up again\" (Ibid.), for your soul shall be united with me, and your body shall be buried in the graves of your fathers. This comes to teach us that his soul left in another domain, YET \"I WILL ALSO SURELY BRING YOU UP AGAIN\" TO BE BURIED IN THE GRAVES OF HIS FATHERS. 338. \"And Yosef shall put his hand on your eyes\" (Ibid.). Surely because he was the firstborn, AND IT IS FOR THE FIRSTBORN TO PUT HIS HAND ON HIS FATHER'S EYES. For according to thought, he was the firstborn of the first seed, as we learned. Since the Holy One, blessed be He, knew this secret THAT HE THOUGHT OF RACHEL, He let him know that it would be Yosef, WHO WILL PUT HIS HANDS ON HIS EYES, whom he greatly loved. "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 339. \"Shall put his hand on your eyes\": HE ASKS: What does this come to teach us? Rabbi Yisa said: This teaches us of Ya'akov's importance, THAT HIS SON, A KING, WILL PUT HIS HAND ON HIS EYES, and also informs him that Yosef is alive and will be present at his death. Rabbi Chizkiyah said: I have learned something, yet I fear of revealing it, since Wisdom abides with the common customs. Rabbi Aba tapped him and said: Speak up and pluck up your courage, for everything is disclosed in the days of Rabbi Shimon AND THERE IS NO NEED TO BE AFRAID. 340. RABBI CHIZKIYAH said: We learned from the book of Rabbi Yisa Saba (the elder), in the chapter about customs, that when a man merits a son in this world, THE SON should put dust on his eyes when his father is buried as a sign of respect, an indication that the world is now concealed from him, and that he, THE SON, inherits it in his stead. 341. This is because a man's eyes reflect the world and contain all the colors. The white color in them is like a great sea which surrounds the world on all sides. Another is like the ground dug out from the water. The ground stands in the midst of the water and so does the color in the midst of the water; NAMELY IN THE MIDST OF THE WHITE COLOR WHICH INDICATES THE WATER OF THE OCEAN. 342. The third color in the middle of the eye is Jerusalem, the center of the world. The fourth color in the eye is where the power of sight dwells; NAMELY THE BLACKNESS IN THE EYE. It is called \"the apple of the eye\" (Tehilim 17:8), where the face is seen and the most dear sight of all, Tzion, the innermost point of all, where the whole world is seen, where the Shechinah dwells, which is the beauty and sight of all. The eye is the worldly inheritance, and therefore he WHO DIES leaves this and HIS SON takes it and inherits it. 343. He said to him: This was well said, but this matter has an even deeper meaning, though the children of the world do not know or look for it. For when a man departs from the world, his Nefesh is hidden with him, and before it leaves the body his eyes see certain things, as we have explained in relation to the verse: \"For no man shall see me, and live\" (Shemot 33:24), that men do not see in their lives what they see in their death. "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 344. His eyes are opened to the sight they have just seen, and those standing by should put a hand on his eyes and close them, because of what we learned about common customs. When the eyes remain open to the dear vision, if he has a son, the son should be the first to put his hand over his eyes and close them. It says, \"And Yosef shall put his hand on your eyes,\" for another unholy sight is come before him and the eye that beheld the supernal holy sight must not look at the other sight. 345. Another reason is that the Nefesh is close by in the house, and if the eye is open, and the other sight OF THE OTHER SIDE will be upon his eyes, whatever he beholds shall be cursed. AND SINCE THE NEFASHOT IS STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM, HE MIGHT LOOK AT IT AND IT WILL BE ACCURSED. This is not respectful to the eye, or to any of the dead man's relatives, especially to the dead man himself. It is degrading for him to behold what he should not BEHOLD, and lay his eyes on another thing; NAMELY THE OTHER SIDE. Therefore he is covered by dust. The friends have already spoke about the judgment which THE DEAD MAN undergoes in the grave, AND THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO SPEAK ABOUT IT. It is a sign of respect that the eye be closed by his son he left in the world. 346. Come and see for seven days AFTER THE DEMISE, the Nefesh goes from the grave to the house and back and mourns him. Three times a day, the Nefesh and the body are judged together, though nobody in the world knows it, or observes it so as to awaken his heart. 347. Afterwards, the body is sealed IN THE GRAVE and the Nefesh goes to bathe in Gehenom, then goes out to roam about the world and visit THE BODY IN the grave, until it is wears that which it wears. 348. After twelve months everybody rests. The body reposes in the dust and the Nefesh is bound and enlightened by the Ruach, which in its garment is satisfied in the Garden of Eden. The Neshamah ascends to the bundle of life, THE NUKVA, the greatest pleasure of all. All of them are attached to each other, THE NEFESH TO THE RUACH AND THE RUACH TO THE NESHAMAH, at certain times, ON SHABBAT, HOLIDAYS AND THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH. "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 349. Come and see: Woe to the people who do not regard, who do not know nor understand why they exist, and neglect to observe the precepts of the Torah. Some of the precepts of the Torah are made into a holy garment above IN THE UPPER GARDEN OF EDEN, and some are made into a holy garment below IN THE LOWER GARDEN OF EDEN. Some precepts are made into a holy garment in this world. Man needs them all. They are made of man's days as we explained. 350. Rabbi Yehuda Saba (the elder) was very anxious one day TO KNOW WHAT HE WOULD HAVE IN THE WORLD OF TRUTH. He was shown in a dream a certain image made of bright light which shines to the four directions. He asked what it was, and they said to him: This is your garment, which you shall wear here. From that day ONWARD, he was happy. 351. Rabbi Yehuda said: On each day the spirits of the righteous sit, clothed in their garments in rows in the Garden of Eden and praise the Holy One, blessed be He, with the highest glory, as it is written: \"Surely the righteous shall give thanks to your name: the upright shall dwell in your presence\" (Tehilim 140:14). Rabbi Aba said: It is first written, \"And Yisrael bowed himself...\" As we explained, the bed is the Congregation of Yisrael, THE NUKVA; The bed's head is the righteous; \"upon the bed's head\" refers to the holy King, that the peace is His; NAMELY TIFERET, as it is written: \"Behold it his litter, that of Solomon\" (Shir Hashirim 3:7). For he bowed to himself, BEING THE CHARIOT OF TIFERET, to him who stands upon the bed's head whose name is Yisrael, AS TIFERET IS CALLED YISRAEL. Therefore, \"And Yisrael bowed himself upon the bed's head.\" 352. Afterwards, when Ya'akov saw that he was perfected in the highest grade, and that his grade, TIFERET, was high, together with the patriarchs, CHESED AND GVURAH, and that he alone was wholly mended, FOR TIFERET IS THE CENTRAL COLUMN WHICH INCLUDES CHESED AND GVURAH AND MEASURED AGAINST ALL CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET, his heart rejoiced and he was strengthened by the supernal desire of the Holy One, blessed be He, who was pleased with him. Then it was said of him, \"And Yisrael strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed,\" on the bed itself, THE SECRET OF MALCHUT, since he was perfected in a higher grade, TO WIT, HE WAS MADE WHOLE BY THE ATTRIBUTE OF TIFERET WHICH IS ABOVE MALCHUT. Happy is his portion. 33. The world is judged four times a year Rabbi Yehuda discusses the four times of the year that the world is judged. During these four times of the year, Chesed, Gvurah, Tiferet, and Malchut are present to judge the world. We learn of the significance of corn to the judgment on Passover, the significance of the fruits of the tree to the judgment on the Feast of Weeks, and the significance of water to the judgment on Sukkot. We are also told that the New Year is the head of God's year, and it is the time when all the inhabitants of the world pass before God. Finally, Rabbi Yosi reminds us that man's deeds are recorded every day. Each morning his soul entreats him to repent and to follow the righteous path. Those who ignore this warning will have their deeds recorded. Only the righteous have nothing to fear in this world and in the world to come. The Relevance of this Passage The awesome power of the major holidays and their particular rituals is released into our world, helping us atone for our sins, lessen judgments decreed against us, and transform our inner character. Relative to the degree of atonement in our heart, this passage helps us alter our destiny in positive ways by controlling the seed and \"head of God's year.\" Awareness of the importance of penitence and spiritual growth is deepened in our "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" consciousness, inspiring us to pursue self-transformation for the purpose of achieving closeness to the Light of The Creator 353. We learned that Rabbi Yehuda said: We have explained in the Baraitha that the world is judged four times a year: in Pesach in respect to corn; in Shavuot in respect to the fruits of the tree; on Rosh Hashanah, when all the inhabitants of the world pass before Him like a flock of sheep; and on Sukkot when water is apportioned to them. We have explained the secret of the Baraitha: that corn on Pesach, corresponded to the supernal Chariot, the secret of the patriarchs, CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET, and King David, MALCHUT. TO WIT, THE FOUR TIMES BROUGHT UP IN THE BARAITHA ARE THE SECRET OF THE FATHERS AND KING DAVID. HE EXPLAINS, Judgment is pronounced on Pesach in respect to corn literally. And we have already explained, in relation to it why Matzah is connected to Pesach? Because it is a law, and the law of the kingdom is the prevailing law. THUS, THE MATZAH IS A LAW. This is the starting point for Yisrael to enter the holy portion of the Holy One, blessed be He, and remove the leavened bread, which is a strange deity appointed over the idolatrous nations called other Elohim, foreign Elohim, and also called leavened bread and the Evil Inclination. To enter the Matzah, MALCHUT, is to enter the holy portion of the Holy One, blessed be He. This is the reason Judgment is pronounced on Pesahch concerning corn, as we explained that the world is sentenced in respect to Hei, MALCHUT. TVUAH (CORN) IS COMPOSED OF THE SYLABLES TAVO-HEI (HEB. 'HEI SHALL COME'). 354. On Shavuot, the fruits of the tree are pronounced. HE ASKS: Why \"the fruits of the tree,\" shouldn't it have said 'the fruits of the trees'? HE ANSWERS: This is the great and strong tree above, ZEIR ANPIN. The fruits of the tree are mentioned in the verse, \"I am like a leafy cypress tree; from me is your fruit found\" (Hoshea 14:9), WHICH ALLUDES TO THE SOULS OF THE RIGHTEOUS, THE FRUITS OF ZEIR ANPIN, CALLED TREE. THEY ARE SENTENCED AT SHAVUOT, AN ALLUSION TO TIFERET. 355. On Rosh Hashanah, they pass before Him like a flock of sheep. We learned that Rosh Hashanah (lit. 'head of the year') is the King's head of the year, which is Yitzchak called head, the head of the King, ZEIR ANPIN, THE HEAD OF GVURAH. This place is called year, and therefore all the inhabitants of the world pass before Him like a flock of sheep. We therefore learned that on Rosh Hashanah, all the inhabitants of the world pass before Him it like a flock of sheep, for then Yitzchak abides there, WHO IS THE HEAD OF THE LEFT WHERE JUDGMENTS DWELL. HENCE, IT IS SAID THAT ON ROSH HASHANAH \"HIS LEFT HAND IS UNDER MY ARM\" (SHIR HASHIRIM 2:6). 356. On Sukkot, Judgment is pronounced in respect to water. This is the beginning OF THE ILLUMINATION of the King's right side, WHICH IS CHASSADIM CALLED WATER. IT IS SAID OF THIS FESTIVAL \"AND HIS RIGHT HAND EMBRACES ME\" (IBID.). The rejoicing in water is everywhere when water is sprinkled or drawn, for water is known TO BE CHASSADIM. Therefore, everything exists in these four times, ON PESACH THE JUDGMENT IS IN THE SECRET OF MALCHUT CALLED CORN, ON SHAVUOT IT IS IN THE SECRET OF TIFERET CALLED TREE, ON ROSH HASHANAH ON THE SECRET OF GVURAH AND ON SUKKOT THE SECRET OF CHESED. "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 357. Rabbi Yosi said: When you examine this, there is everything in these four times, Avraham, Yitzchak, Ya'akov, CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET, and King David, MALCHUT, ACCORDING TO THE EXPLANATION OF THE LAST PARAGRAPH. The world is judged by CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, AND MALCHUT and people are judged on these four times, THE DAYS WHEN CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, AND MALCHUT ARE IN THE WORLD. Every day, the books are open and MEN'S deeds are recorded, yet no one heeds or lends an ear. The Torah gives testimony every day and says, \"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here: for him that lacks understanding, she says to him\" (Mishlei 9:4), but no one listens to its voice. 358. We learned that when a man wakes up in the morning, witnesses stand before him and adjure him, but he does not heed that the soul adjures him every hour. If he hears, well, but if he does not, the books are open and his deeds recorded. Rabbi Chiya said: Happy are the righteous, who are not afraid of judgment neither in this world and in the World to Come. Hence it says, \"But the righteous are secure as a young lion\" (Mishlei 28:1) and \"the righteous shall inherit the earth\" (Tehilim 37:29). 34. \"And when the sun was going down\" Rabbi Chizkiyah begins by explaining that the title verse refers to the day of strict judgment, when a man's soul departs from his body. We learn that thirty days before his death, man's Neshamah departs. As a consequence, his shadow disappears and all desire leaves him. When man is judged above, the Neshamah ascends to the Upper court of justice where it gives testimony to the thoughts and deeds of that man. If that man is sick and his judgment is favorable, he may recover. However, if his judgment condemns him, he may yet survive if God sees that he will later have merit or that he will give birth to a righteous son. The Relevance of this Passage Here we help cleanse our souls of sin and wrongdoing in order to sweeten judgments set forth against us. The desire to pursue spiritual development and growth is increased within us so that we may merit long life in this physical world and draw closer to the Light of The Creator through positive deeds. In addition, blessing and righteousness are bestowed upon our children, helping them to recognize and embrace the benefits of spirituality and Torah, which further increases our quality and length of life. 359. Rabbi Chizkiyah opened the discussion with the verse, \"And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Avram\" (Beresheet 15:12). This verse has been explained, yet here is the secret of the day of strict Judgment, which removes man from this world. We have learned that when the time is come for man to depart from this world, it is the time of great Judgment, when the sun is darkened and does not shine unto the moon, as is written: \"before the sun is darkened\" (Kohelet 12:2). It refers to the holy Neshamah, which is withheld from man thirty days before he departs from the world, and he sees that his shadow is withheld and not to be seen. "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 360. HE ASKS: What is the reason his shadow is gone from him? HE ANSWERS: Because the holy Neshamah is gone and departed from him. It is not that when a man weakens and dies that the soul is removed from him, but in his life, when he is in vigor that his Neshamah departs from him, and does not shine upon the Ruach. The Ruach does not shine upon the Nefesh, and then the shadow is gone and does not illuminate upon him. From that day onward, every one proclaims that he will die, even the birds in the sky. Why? Because his Neshamah is gone from him, the Ruach no longer shines upon the Nefesh, and it is weakened and eating and every desire of the body are gone from him. 361. Rabbi Yehuda said: Even when a man falls ill and cannot pray, the Neshamah is gone and removed from him. The Ruach does not then shine upon the Nefesh until verdict is given. If the sentence is good, the Neshamah returns to its place and shines upon everyone; NAMELY THE RUACH AND THE NEFESH. This is true as long as Judgment is not yet pronounced. When it is, AND IT IS ALREADY DECIDED THAT HE WILL DIE, thirty days before the others, the Neshamah is gone and his shadow passes away. 362. We learned that when a man is sentenced above, his Neshamah is brought up to the court of justice, where the trial proceeds according to its testimony. It testifies to everything and to evil thoughts he harbored, but not to evil deeds, since they are all recorded in a book. A man is judged for everything at the time of sentence above, BOTH FOR THOUGHTS AND DEEDS. The body is then in trouble more than in any other time. 363. If he is favorably judged, he is released. Sweat breaks out over the body and the Neshamah returns later to shine upon all, THE RUACH AND THE NEFESH. A man is never cured from his disease until he is sentenced above. If you say that there are yet many evil people who remain alive; NAMELY RECOVER FROM THEIR ILLNESS. HE ANSWERS: The Holy One, blessed be He, watches over his sentence. Even if he has no merit yet THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE, sees that he will later, He acquits him. Or sometimes He sees he will beget a righteous son and therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, judges him favorably. "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 364. All the works and judgments of the Holy One, blessed be He, are for the good, and He watches over everything, as it is written: \"'Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die?' says Hashem Elohim: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?\" (Yechezkel 18:23). Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He , judges favorably all the evil in the world who recover. 365. Sometimes, when the illness has run its course that was allotted it to afflict man, as it says, \"And severe sicknesses, and of long continuance (also: 'faithful')\" (Devarim 28:59), they act faithfully in dwelling upon man and leave after the set period, either the righteous or the evil. All is done according to justice, like we said. 35. \"And Yisrael saw Yosef's sons\" Rabbi Yitzchak begins this discussion by explaining the title verse. We learn that through the Holy Spirit, the righteous Yisrael was able to see that Yosef's sons would one day worship idols. We also learn that all the generations of the world stand in the presence of God before they are born into the world. The Relevance of this Passage The strength and wisdom to free oneself from idol-worshipping is bestowed upon the reader through the righteousness of Yisrael. Idol worshipping refers to any form of egocentric behavior where pleasure is derived from external sources as opposed to true contentment that is generated internally in our souls. Before a soul enters this world, all the secrets of the Torah are revealed to it. The soul promises The Creator that during physical existence, it will pursue the path of Torah and spiritual growth. Prior to the moment of birth, the wisdom of the Torah is then forgotten, along with our promise, and thus begins the true work of \"remembering\" our commitment and \"reacquiring\" our spiritual knowledge. This passage helps us to remain true to our promise to walk the path of the Light, and it regenerates the seeds of mystical wisdom implanted within our soul prior to our birth. 366. \"And Yisrael saw Yosef's sons, and said: 'Who are these?'\" Rabbi Yitzchak said: This verse is difficult to understand. It is written, \"And Yisrael saw,\" yet also \"And the eyes of Yisrael were dim from age, so that he could not see.\" If he cannot see, how come then: \"And Yisrael saw\"? HE ANSWERS: \"AND YISRAEL SAW\" MEANS that he saw through the Holy Spirit Yosef's descendants, Yerovaam and his fraternity, the same Yerovaam who made the two golden calves, and said: \"These are your Elohim, Yisrael\" (I Melachim 12:28). Hence he said: \"Who are these?\" Who is he that will say, \"These are your Elohim,\" your idols to worship. It is therefore written: \"And Yisrael saw Yosef's sons.\" 367. From this, WE UNDERSTAND that the righteous see things afar, BEFORE THEY ARE MANIFEST IN THE WORLD, since the Holy One, blessed be He, adorns them with His crown. For the Holy One, blessed be He, sees into the distance, as said: \"And Elohim saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good\" (Beresheet 1:31), the Holy One, blessed be He, sees all deeds before they are done, and they all pass before Him. "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 368. In the same manner, all the generations of the world from one world's end to the other stand before Him before coming into the world. This is written in the verse, \"He who calls the generations from the beginning\" (Yeshayah 41:4), NAMELY before the universe was created, for all the souls that descend into the world stand before the Holy One, blessed be He, before going into it, assuming their worldly shape and names. It is written: \"He calls them all by names\" (Yirmeyah 40:26). 369. The righteous too are shown by the Holy One, blessed be He, all the generations of the world, before they come into it. Whence do we know that? From Adam, who was the first to be shown by the Holy One, blessed be He, the generations before they came, as it is written: \"This is the book of the generations of Adam\" (Beresheet 5:1). We learned that He showed him all the generations destined to come into the world. Moshe too was shown, as it is written: \"And Hashem showed him all the land\" (Devarim 34:1), WHICH MEANS THAT the Holy One, blessed be He, showed him all the generations of the world and all its leaders and prophets before they were born. 370. Here too, \"And Yisrael saw Yosef's sons\" means that he saw far off, THAT THEY WILL WORSHIP IDOLS, and he trembled and said: \"Who are these?\" The verse refers both to this, YEROVAAM WHO SAID: \"THESE ARE YOUR GODS, YISRAEL\" and to ITS SIMPLE MEANING ABOUT EFRAIM AND MENASHE THEMSELVES. Yosef answered it by saying: 'They are my sons, whom Elohim had given me in this place.' TO WIT, THEY ARE GOOD, YET HE DID NOT ANSWER HIM IN RELATION TO YEROVAAM AND HIS FRIENDS. How do we know that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed him through the Holy Spirit ABOUT YEROVAAM AND HIS FRIENDS? From the verse: \"And, lo, Elohim has shown me also your children,\" \"also\" alludes to THE GENERATIONS that will issue from him, as we said. 36. \"And he blessed Yosef\" From the explanations provided by Rabbi Yosi and Rabbi Elazar, we learn that the title verse indicates that a blessing was conferred on both Yosef and his sons, since a man's children are his own blessing. We also learn that the particle Et placed before Yosef is an allusion to Malchut. This means that he blessed the sign of the Holy Covenant, Malchut. According to the rabbis, all blessings originate in Binah, the source of life. They are then received by Ya'akov and passed to Malchut. Therefore, when a blessing is given, God must be blessed first if it is to be fulfilled. During morning prayer, we should first bless God and then bless the people of the world. We learn that when Ya'akov's father blessed him, he first blessed God in the statement, \"the smell of my son is like the smell of a field\" The discussion then turns to the meaning of the verse, \"These are your gods, Yisrael,\" The word \"these,\" we are told, is a reference to the Serpent and its rider, the male and female of the Other Side who are not joined in unity like the Male and Female of Holiness. Following this, the verse, \"For these I weep\" is explained as a reference to the sin of the golden calf and the destruction of the temple. The word \"these\" is also written in relation to Holiness. However, through the Holy Spirit, Ya'akov saw that Yerovaam worshipped idols and correctly interpreted the verse, \"These are your gods, Yisrael.\" He therefore blessed God and his sons, and ensured that his blessing would not be bestowed upon Yerovaam. The Relevance of this Passage By connecting us to the supernal blessings bestowed upon Yosef, we draw countless blessings upon our world, the dimension referred to as Malchut. This connection also ensures that all of our blessings take place after the blessings of our Creator. The Light aroused herein helps protect us from the Other Side and remove the negativity and darkness in our world resulting from the building of the Golden Calf and the destruction of the second temple. "},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 371. \"And he blessed Yosef\" (Beresheet 48:15). We have to examine this verse, since it is written, \"And he blessed Yosef,\" yet no blessing was conferred upon Yosef, but upon his sons. It should have been written: 'And he blessed them.' Why is it said that he blessed Yosef if Yosef was not blessed? 372. Rabbi Yosi said: The particle 'et' before 'Yosef' ALLUDES TO MALCHUT. It is written \"Et Yosef,\" which is the blessing for his sons SINCE HIS SONS, MENASHE AND EFRAIM, ARE CONSIDERED TO BE MALCHUT CALLED ET. When his sons are blessed, he is blessed before them, therefore it is written also \"Yosef,\" for man's children are his own blessing. 373. Rabbi Elazar said: \"And he blessed (et) Yosef,\" et is precise ALLUDING TO MALCHUT. For he blessed the sign of the covenant, NAMELY THE SECRET OF THE COVENANT that Yosef kept, WHICH IS MALCHUT. For this reason, the righteous, Yosef, is called Et, as it is written \"Et Yosef\" since Yosef includes the secret of the covenant, MALCHUT, that is present with him. 374. \"The Elohim, before whom my fathers Avraham and Yitzchak walked\": \"Elohim\" is the secret of the holy covenant; NAMELY MALCHUT CALLED HOLY COVENANT. My fathers indeed walked before him, WHICH MEANS THAT MY FATHERS ARE before and above this secret; NAMELY BEFORE MALCHUT. FOR MY FATHERS ARE Avraham and Yitzchak, CHESED AND GVURAH OF ZEIR ANPIN, WHICH PRECEDE MALCHUT AND HIGHER THAN HER, as that place, MALCHUT, is sustained and nourished by them. 375. \"The Elohim who has been my shepherd\": HE ASKS: What is the reason he repeats the word \"The Elohim\"? HE ANSWERS: This is a high secret. He blessed the place, MALCHUT, in the secret of living Elohim, BINAH, the source of life, whence blessings are drawn. He therefore mentioned himself in this place by saying: \"The Elohim who has been my shepherd.\" For all blessings originate in the source of life, BINAH, and received by Ya'akov, THE SECRET OF THE CENTRAL COLUMN, When he receives them, that place, MALCHUT, receives them from him, as all comes from the male, YA'AKOV. Hence it says, \"And he blessed et Yosef,\" ET BEING MALCHUT WHICH RECEIVED HER BLESSINGS FROM YA'AKOV, ZEIR ANPIN. 376. For this reason, wherever blessings are to be given, the Holy One, blessed be He, WHO IS MALCHUT, should be blessed first; for if He is not, the blessings are not fulfilled. "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 377. But you may say that when Ya'akov's father blessed him, he did not first bless the Holy One, blessed be He. HE ANSWERS: Come and see that when Yitzchak blessed Ya'akov, he did not do so before blessing the Holy One, blessed be He. After he did that, he blessed Ya'akov. Whence do we know that? From the verse: \"...and said, 'See, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field which Hashem has blessed'\" (Beresheet 27:27). There is a blessing here for the Holy One, blessed be He, in the words \"which Hashem has blessed,\" and He was blessed with the establishment of the blessings. Then it says: \"Therefore the Elohim give you\" since the field, MALCHUT, was established by the blessings, for they issue only from it after it is already established by the blessings. In the same manner, first Ya'akov blessed the Holy One, blessed be He, and then did he bless his sons. Come and see in the morning, a man should first bless the Holy One, blessed be He, and then the other inhabitants of the world. We have explained it in relation to the verse: \"In the morning shall he devour the prey...\" (Beresheet 49:27). 378. Come and see: When Ya'akov wanted to bless the sons of Yosef, he saw through the Holy Spirit that Yerovaam, son of Nevat would issue from Efraim. He opened the discussion with the words, \"Who are these?\" WHO SAID: \"THESE ARE YOUR ELOHIM, YISRAEL\"? HE ASKS: What is the reason he said, in relation to idol worshipping: \"...these are your Elohim, Yisrael\"? HE REPLIES: This is a secret. Of all the sides of the evil serpent, there is the side of the spirit of defilement considered to be the aspect of the serpent, and there is its rider, SAMAEL-IN OTHER WORDS, THEY ARE MALE AND FEMALE. When they mate, they are called 'these' IN THE PLURAL, TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE NOT JOINED IN UNITY LIKE THE MALE AND FEMALE OF HOLINESS BUT ARE SEPARATED. BECAUSE THE OTHER SIDE BEGINS UNITED BUT ENDS IN SEPARATION. They appear in the world in their several aspects, ALL THAT ARE DRAWN FROM THE SERPENT, ISSUE FROM THE MATING OF THE MALE AND THE FEMALE CALLED 'THESE'. 379. The spirit of holiness, THE NUKVA OF ZEIR ANPIN, called zot (this, fem.) which is the secret of the covenant, is an imprint that is always upon man, THE IMPRINT OF CIRCUMCISION. Also \"this is my El, and I will praise Him\" (Shemot 15:2) and \"this is Hashem,\" ZEIR ANPIN, WHICH ARE IN THE SINGULAR. But THE MALE AND FEMALE OF THE OTHER SIDE, SAMAEL AND THE SERPENT, are called these IN THE PLURAL. Hence it is written, \"These are your Elohim, Yisrael.\" 380. Therefore it is written, \"Even these may forget\" (Yeshayah 49:15), REFERRING TO THE MALE AND FEMALE OF THE OTHER SIDE, \"and I\"--the secret of this, THE NUKVA OF ZEIR ANPIN-\"will not forget.\" It is also written: \"For these I weep\" (Eichah 1:16), for the sin OF THE GOLDEN CALF CALLED THESE, brought them much weeping, BEING THE CAUSE FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TEMPLE. Another explanation for, \"For these I weep\": The reason for this is that permission was given to this place, NAMELY TO THE SERPENT AND SAMAEL, to rule over Yisrael and destroy the Temple. Since they were given permission I weep, I being the Holy Spirit, NAMELY THE NUKVA called I. "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 381. It may be said that it is written, \"These are the words of the covenant\" (Devarim 28:69). CAN YOU SAY THAT 'THESE' IS THE NAME OF THE MALE AND FEMALE OF THE OTHER SIDE? HE ANSWERS: Assuredly those curses are not fulfilled save through these, WHICH ARE OF THE OTHER SIDE, where all the curses abide, like we explained about THE SERPENT that it is cursed, \"CURSED ABOVE... EVERY BEAST OF THE FIELD\" (BERESHEET 2:14). The Torah therefore preceded, saying \"these\" for those who transgress the words of the covenant. 382. \"These are the commandments, which Hashem commanded\" (Vayikra 27:34): HE ASKS: \"THESE ARE THE COMMANDMENTS...\", WHY IS IT WRITTEN \"THESE\" EVEN IN RELATION TO HOLINESS? HE ANSWERS: This is because all the precepts of the Torah purify man so he shall not deviate from the path and keep away FROM THE OTHER SIDE. THEREFORE, IT SAYS IN RELATION TO THE COMMANDMENTS THESE. What then about, \"And these are the generations of the sons of Noach\" (Beresheet 10:1)? WHY DOES IT SAYS 'THESE'? HE REPLIES: Surely here too IT IS A NAME OF THE OTHER SIDE, for Cham, the father of Cna'an, of whom it is written \"Cursed be Cna'an\" (Beresheet 9:25). This is the secret of 'these'. 383. Therefore it is written, \"And they said: 'These are your Elohim, Yisrael'\" (Shemot 32:4). It is the molten dross of gold. Aharon offered gold, which is of his side-THE LEFT SIDE-and is comprised of the power of fire. All is one because this side is considered to be gold and fire, AND THE DROSS OF GOLD IS THE KLIPOT AND DEFILEMENT. And the spirit of defilement, which is always in the desert, found then a place to gain power AND CLING TO YISRAEL. 384. Before, the children of Yisrael were purified from the primordial filth OF THE SERPENT, which he injected into the world and brought death unto it THROUGH THE SIN OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE. FROM THIS, THEY WERE PURIFIED when they stood by Mount Sinai, but it returned again and the serpent defiled them as before and overpowered them and brought death unto them and unto the whole world for generations after. This is the meaning of the words, \"I had said: 'You are angels...Nevertheless, you shall die like a man'\" (Tehilim 6-7), FOR DUE TO THE SIN OF THE GOLDEN CALF, DEATH HAD POWER OVER THEM LIKE OVER ADAM. 385. Therefore, when Ya'akov saw, through the Holy Spirit, Yerovaam, son of Nevat-who worshipped idols-who said, \"These are your Elohim, Yisrael,\" he was shaken and asked, \"Who are these?\" When he later wished to bless them, he first blessed the Shechinah and then his sons. After blessing the Holy One, blessed be He, he then blessed them from that place, which he blessed first. Hence it says, \"The angel who redeemed me from all evil...\"; TO WIT, THE SHECHINAH CALLED ANGEL SHALL BLESS THEM. THIS WAY HE WAS SURE HIS BLESSING WOULD NOT BE CONFERRED UPON YEROVAAM, SON OF NEVAT. 37. \"Then Chizkiyahu turned his face toward the wall\" Rabbi Yehuda explains that he who does not beget children in this world has no life or existence in the world to come. Therefore, because Chizkiyahu had no wife or children, he prayed with his face to the wall, an allusion to the Shechinah, so that the Shechinah would be with him. Chizkiyahu then chose a wife and prayed to The Creator. We learn that he kept and guarded the Covenant, and that he wept before God for redemption. The Relevance of this Passage The miraculous power of childbirth is transferred to all those experiencing difficulty bearing children. This divine force also strengthens spiritual bonds between parent and child for those who are blessed with children. "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 386. Rabbi Yehuda opened the discussion with the verse \"Then Chizkiyahu turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to Hashem\" (Yeshayah 38:2). It has been derived from the verse that a man should pray near the wall, and nothing should intervene between him and the wall, in accordance with the verse: \"Then Chizkiyahu turned his face toward the wall.\" HE ASKS: Why is he different than others who prayed, of whom it does not say that they turned their faces to the wall, but it sufficed to say that they \"prayed to Hashem.\" For whoever prays does so with proper intention, EVEN IF HE DOES NOT TURN HIS FACE TO THE WALL, as it says of Moshe, \"And Moshe prayed to Hashem\" (Bemidbar 11:2). \"And Moshe cried to Hashem\" (Shemot, 17:4), but not that he \"turned his face toward the wall.\" Why does it say of Chizkiyahu that he \"turned his face toward the wall,\" then prayed? 387. HE ANSWERS: The secret of the matter is what we learned of Chizkiyahu that he was not married at the time. He had no wife, nor did he beget any children. It is therefore written, \"And Yeshayah... came to him, and said to him...'For you shall die, and not live'\" (Yeshayah 38:1). We derived from it that \"you shall die\" in this world \"and not live\" in the World to Come. Why? Because he did not beget children. 388. Whoever does not strive to beget children in this world has no existence in the World to Come, nor any portion thereof. His soul is driven from the world, and cannot find rest in any place in the world. This is the punishment indicted in the Torah by the words: \"They shall die childless\" (Vayikra 20:20). For when he goes to the World to Come, he who has no children dies there AND IS CONSIDERED DEAD in this world and in the World to Come. It is therefore written, \"For you shall die, and not live.\" 389. Moreover, the Shechinah did not rest upon him at all. From the words: \"Then Chizkiyahu turned his face toward the wall,\" we learned that he made his mind and decided to take a wife, so that the Shechinah, the secret of wall, would rest upon him, AS THE SHECHINAH IS CALLED WALL. 390. Hence it continues: \"And prayed to Hashem.\" From this, we learned that whoever has sinned, and wishes to ask for forgiveness, should first fix his heart and thought upon purifying himself of that sin, and only then to pray, as it says, \"Let us search and try our ways\" (Eichah 3:40) first, then \"turn back to Hashem\" (Ibid.). Here too, since Chizkiyahu was conscious of his sin, it is written, \"Then Chizkiyahu turned his face toward the wall,\" in resolution to be purified before the Shechinah CALLED WALL, for he sinned to that place. "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 391. Since all the females in the world are in the secret of the Shechinah, the Shechinah rests upon whomever has a wife, but not upon him who does not. Therefore, Chizkiyahu resolved to be purified before her, and took upon himself to marry a wife. Then he \"prayed to Hashem.\" 392. The wall is Master of all the earth, the Shechinah, as it says, \"Behold, the Ark of the Covenant (of) the Master of all the earth\" (Yehoshua 3:11). HENCE, THE ARK OF THE COVENANT IS THE SHECHINAH CALLED MASTER OF ALL THE EARTH, and also called wall, as in \"a breaking down of walls\" (Yeshayah 22:5), WHICH MEANS the crying of the wall. For it is Master OF ALL THE EARTH, while the Temple was destroyed, as it says, \"Rachel weeping for her children\" (Yirmeyah 31:14), which we have already explained. Therefore, \"Chizkiyahu turned his face toward the wall.\" 393. Come and see: It is said in his prayer, \"Remember now, O Hashem, I beseech you, how I have walked before you\" (Yeshayah 38:3). Here, he hints that he kept the holy covenant not to defile it but to guard it well, as it says here, \"I have walked before you\" and elsewhere \"walk before Me, and be perfect. And I will make my covenant...\" (Beresheet 17:1-2). AS \"WALK\" REFERS TO THE HOLY COVENANT, HERE TOO \"I HAVE WALKED\" MEANS that he kept well the holy covenant. \"In truth and with a perfect heart\" means that he was intent upon the secrets of faith comprised in Truth. 394. \"And have done that which is good in your sight\" (Yeshayah 38:3) means that he did not interrupt his prayer between 'redemption (Ga'al Yisrael)' and the Amidah, YESOD BEING CALLED REDEMPTION AND THE NUKVA, PRAYER. We have already explained, and the friends too, that he meant to declare the unison in a proper manner. He \"wept sore\" for no gate resists tears AND REMAINS CLOSED. Redemption COMBINED WITH PRAYER is CALLED THE NUKVA, the redeeming angel, which may be found at every redemption in the world, as we have already explained. 38. \"The angel who redeemed\" Rabbi Elazar explains that the title verse indicates Ya'akov wished to join the high and the low, so that the blessings he bestowed on Malchut, our physical existence, would also be received by the lower spiritual bodies. We learn that the title verse alludes to Tiferet, who receives blessings from the higher grades and confers them on the upper Cherubs, Sandalfon and Matatron. The upper Cherubs spread out their wings over the place of the Ark three times daily and bestow blessings on the lower Cherubs. The discourse then turns to address the verse, \"House and riches are the inheritance of fathers\" but a prudent wife is from The Creator.\" If man turns to the Other Side, he will receive from the Other Side. However, if God appreciates this man for his good deeds, He redeems him from the Other Side and provides him with a prudent wife. We learn that God matches couples according to the deeds of the righteous before they enter the world. A man may be matched with a \"prudent wife\", when he is born, but if he strays from the path of righteousness, his intended wife will be given to another. If he rectifies his ways by the time he is supposed to marry her, the other man will be rejected and he will have his rightful spouse. Finally, the discussion reverts back to the subject of the hierarchical conferring of blessings. Rabbi Yehuda explains why the word hayoshvi is spelled with an extra Yud ? in the verse, \"To You I lift up my eyes\" We also learn that the circle of the world is sustained by the central point, called \"the house of the Holy of Holies.\" The Relevance of this Passage The celestial spirits that serve as conduits between mortals and the Light of The Creator, are accessible to readers of these mystical verses. Thus, sacred spiritual energy shines brighter in this world, infusing our lives with untold blessings. The good fortune to attract our true soulmate is kindled, as we become more cognizant of the illusionary material trappings that seduce us in this physical existence. This energy also enriches and deepens our marital relationships, enlightening us to the importance of building a marriage on a foundation of spiritual purpose and principles. "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 395. \"The angel who redeemed me from all evil\" (Beresheet 48:16). Rabbi Elazar said: After Ya'akov gave the blessing he meant to bring unity from below upwards BY SAYING \"HASHEM,\" MALCHUT, \"BEFORE WHOM MY FATHERS...DID WALK,\" CHESED AND GVURAH, continuing from above downwards in \"The Elohim who has been my shepherd\" THAT IS BINAH. HE DREW FROM BINAH UNTO HIS GRADE, TIFERET. Now that he has received, he gave to that place, THE NUKVA, and when the blessings reached it he opened the discussion saying: \"The angel who redeemed...\" SO THAT FROM HER BLESSINGS WILL BE DRAWN UNTO THE LOWER BEINGS. 396. He opened the discussion saying: \"For the Cherubs spread out their two wings over the place of the ark\" (I Melachim 8:7). The Cherubs stood there by miracle and three times a day spread their wings over the ark below, as it is written that they \"spread their wings\" and not that their wings were spread, WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT THEIR WINGS WERE ALWAYS SPREAD. BUT \"SPREAD THEIR WINGS\" MEANING THAT THEY DID SO THREE TIMES A DAY. 397. Come and see: The Holy One, blessed be He, did below as He did above; TO WIT, THE CHERUBS AT THE TABERNACLE ARE LIKE THE CHERUBS ABOVE. The Cherubs above resemble boys and stand underneath that place, THE NUKVA OF ATZILUT, to its right and left. THEY, MATATRON AND SANDALFON, ABIDE AT THE HOLY OF HOLIES AT BRIYAH. They are first blessed from the blessings drawn from above, and from there blessings are drawn downward. 398. It is therefore written \"the angel who redeemed me from all evil,\" me BEING TIFERET, who receives blessings from the higher grades. Once it has received them, it will \"bless the lads.\" This is the secret of the Cherubs, MATATRON AND SANDALFON, from whom blessings are conferred by the higher to the lower. 399. \"The angel who redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads.\" Rabbi Chiya opened the discussion saying: \"House and riches are the inheritance of fathers\" (Mishlei 19:14). HE ASKS: How can they be the inheritance of fathers, as it is the Holy One, blessed be He, who gives a man all he has. HE ANSWERS: The Holy One, blessed be He, gives a man a house and riches, which he sometimes bequeaths to his son, for whom it is the inheritance of fathers. \"But a prudent wife is from Hashem\" (Ibid.), for when a man merits a wife, he receives her only from the Holy One, blessed be He, who gives her to him only after he is proclaimed throughout the firmament. 400. For the Holy One, blessed be He, matches couples before they come into the world. Men are given a wife they deserve according to their deeds, and all men's actions are revealed to the Holy One, blessed be He. According to the deeds of the righteous, He matches couples BEFORE ENTERING THE WORLD. "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 401. Sometimes they are joined; TO WIT, IT HAS BEEN PROCLAIMED, BEFORE THEY CAME INTO THE WORLD, THAT THE DAUGHTER OF SO-AND-SO IS DESTINED FOR SO-AND-SO, BUT WHEN HE WAS BORN, man perverted his ways. His spouse was then given to another, until he rectifies his ways. If he does so by the time he is supposed to marry her, the other man is rejected and he comes to takes what is his, WHICH MEANS THAT THE OTHER ONE WHO MARRIED HIS SPOUSE BEFORE HE MADE RIGHT HIS DEEDS IS NOW REJECTED; NAMELY DIES, AND HE RECEIVES HIS SPOUSE FROM HIM. This is the most difficult task for the Holy One, blessed be He, to banish one man because of another. Therefore, it is the Holy One, blessed be He, who gives a wife to man, and by Him couples are formed. Hence, it says \"but a prudent wife is from Hashem.\" 402. Hence, THE TRUTH IS THAT the Holy One, blessed be He, gives a man everything. If you say that HE GIVES ONLY a prudent wife and nothing else, come and see, though the Holy One, blessed be He, prepares but goodness for men, if the man turns from the ways of the Holy One, blessed be He, to the Other Side, he will receive his due from the Other Side to which he cleft, together with accusations and evils. He does not receive them from the Holy One, blessed be He, but from the evil side to which he clung because of his deeds. 403. Therefore Solomon says of a wife who is not prudent, \"And I find more bitter than death the woman\" (Kohelet 7:26), for one draws her to himself by the sins and deeds he commits INSTEAD OF FROM THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE. Therefore, when the Holy One, blessed be He, takes pleasure in man because of his good deeds, He provides for him a prudent wife, and redeems him from the Other Side. 404. Ya'akov therefore said: \"The angel who redeemed me from all evil.\" \"From all evil\" means that I was not provided with a wife from the Other Side, and that my children were not defective, but they were all righteous and complete to perfection. Since he was redeemed from all evil, THE OTHER SIDE, and Ya'akov did not cleave at all to the Other Side. 405. Therefore \"the angel who redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads.\" Wherefore are they worthy of being blessed? Because Yosef kept the holy covenant. Concerning this, Yosef said: \"They are my sons, whom the Elohim has given me in this.\" To wit, he showed him the secret of the covenant CALLED THIS, which he kept. Since he observed this, his sons are worthy of being blessed, and he deserves many blessings. Thus Ya'akov gave EACH one blessing, and to Yosef he gave many. This we derive from the verse, \"The blessings of your father are potent above the blessings of my progenitors...\" \"blessings of the breasts, and of the womb... shall be on the head of Yosef\" (Beresheet 49:25-26). "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 406. Rabbi Yehuda opened the discussion saying: \"To you I lift up my eyes, O you who dwells (Heb. hayoshvi) in the heavens\" (Tehilim 123:1). This verse has already been explained, yet come and see a man's prayer offered with devotion is to be found above in the sublime deep, BINAH, whence all blessings are drawn FROM THE RIGHT COLUMN and freedom FROM THE LEFT. They all issue FROM ITS CENTRAL COLUMN to support all. 407. Therefore, there is an extra Yud IN \"HAYOSHVI\" INSTEAD OF 'HAYOSHEV' IN HEAVEN. Thus Yud, WHICH IS CHOCHMAH, is never lacking from this place, AS CHOCHMAH AND BINAH ARE JOINED IN A NEVER-ENDING UNION. Therefore 'hayoshvi' is spelled WITH AN EXTRA YUD, for BINAH is attached above to supernal Chochmah CALLED YUD, and attached below by sitting on the throne of the patriarchs, CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET, the throne called heaven, ZEIR ANPIN WHICH INCLUDES CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET, WHICH ARE THE THREE LEGS OF THE HIGH THRONE BINAH. This is why it is written \"hayoshvi\" in heaven. 408. From this, we understand that when blessings are drawn from above, from the deep, BINAH, they are all received by the place called heaven, ZEIR ANPIN, from which they flow downward until they reach the righteous men, THE SECRET OF RIGHTEOUS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS, that are the covenant of the world, WHICH IS THE NUKVA, from which all the hosts and legions, THE LOWER BEINGS IN BRIYAH, YETZIRAH AND ASIYAH, are blessed as we already explained. 409. Come and behold: the crown of all armies is elevated through the 72 lights. It becomes the circle of the world in seventy places, all of them forming one circle. In it, there is a point in the middle, from which the circle is sustained. It is called the house of the holy of holies, a place for the spirit of all spirits. Here is treasured the innermost secret, hidden among the legions. It is concealed in its innermost place. When it ascends, all THE WORLDS follow, as it is written: \"Draw me, we will run after you\" (Shir Hashirim 1:3). 39. \"O remember not against us former iniquities\" While travelling with Rabbi Chizkiyah and Rabbi Yosi, Rabbi Yehuda explains the title verse. We learn that because of Yisrael's sins, the Other Side and the heathen nations came to rule over the land of Yisrael. Knowing that they could not exist in the world without the mercy and compassion of God, they pray to Him so that He will remove their sins and protect them from the judgment of the Other Side. The Relevance of this Passage The knowledge and certitude that only God can protect us from the harsh accusations of the Other Side are awakened within us. The spiritual truth that we are never victims of other people's wickedness is made clearer in our own mind. Moreover, accountability for our own negative actions is kindled, inspiring us to seek out the Light of The Creator to help redeem us from our internal demons and selfish aspirations. This Light of redemption shines for all those who devoutly meditate upon the mystical letters of Hebrew with a contrite heart. "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 410. Rabbi Chizkiyah, Rabbi Yosi and Rabbi Yehuda were journeying along the road. Rabbi Yosi said: Let each of us discourse upon the Torah. Rabbi Yehuda opened the discussion with the verse, \"O remember not against us former iniquities: let Your tender mercies speedily come to meet us\" (Tehilim 79:8). Come and see: The Holy One, blessed be He, in His love for Yisrael, as they are His lot and portion, lets no one judge them but Himself. When He does, He is filled with compassion for them, like a father for his children, as it says, \"As a father pities his children, so Hashem...\" (Ibid. 103:13). If it is found that they have sinned, He removes the sins one by one, until all are removed from before Him, so that now there is no power for the Other Side to judge them ON THEIR ACCOUNT. 411. When they sin before Him as before, He is AGAIN reminded of the first sins, which were already removed. Therefore it is written, \"O remember not against us former iniquities: let Your tender mercies speedily come to meet us.\" Unless Your tender mercies come upon Yisrael, they would not be able to exist in the world, for numerous adversaries and accusers await Yisrael from above. For unless the Holy One, blessed be He, would speedily send His mercies upon the children of Yisrael before judging them, they would not be able to exist in the world. Therefore \"let Your tender mercies speedily come to meet us: for we are very poor,\" poor in good deeds and in honest deeds. 412. Come and see: If Yisrael would have accumulated good deeds before the Holy One, blessed be He, the idolatrous nations would not be standing against them. But Yisrael caused the other nations to raise their heads in the world, and if Yisrael would not have sinned before the Holy One, blessed be He, the other nations would be subdued before them. 413. Come and see that were it not for Yisrael, who drew by evil deeds the Other Side to the land of Yisrael, the other heathen nations would not be ruling over it. And they would not be exiled from it. Hence it is written, \"For we are very poor\" in worthy good deeds: \"since we are very poor\" \"let Your tender mercies speedily come to meet us.\" 40. \"Serve Hashem with fear\" Rabbi Yosi discourses on the title verse, explaining that the righteous should worship God in the morning and in the evening. The prayer should be performed with gladness and singing in order to bring union to Zeir Anpin. In the morning, our realm of Malchut is blessed by the two sides, Chesed "},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" and Gvurah, and in the evening she distributes the blessings to those who deserve it. The Relevance of this Passage The mystical Light that glows during the morning and evening hours through the prayer-connections made by the righteous radiates throughout this section. Harmony and union between the body and soul, and connection between the Lower and Upper Worlds, are achieved by meditating upon these verses with gladness and song in our hearts. 414. Rabbi Yosi opened the discussion saying: \"Serve Hashem with fear, and rejoice with trembling\" (Tehilim 2:10). It is also written: \"Serve Hashem with gladness: come before His presence with singing\" (Ibid. 100:2). Come and see, only a man who serves the Holy One, blessed be He, should worship Him morning and evening. 415. When light appears in the morning, there is an awakening of the right side, CHESED, in the world. It behooves man then to cling to the right of the Holy One, blessed be He, and worship Him through prayer, for prayer brings power and strength from above, and draws blessings from the supernal deep, BINAH, to all the SUPERNAL worlds, whence blessings flow upon the lower beings. Thus, upper and lower are blessed through the service of prayer. 416. The service prayer should be performed before the Holy One, blessed be He, with gladness and singing, CHESED AND GVURAH, in order to include the Congregation of Yisrael, THE NUKVA, between them, and to properly bring about unison TO ZEIR ANPIN, as it is written: \"Know that Hashem He is Elohim\" (Tehilim 100:3). This is the secret of unison in the secret of the service. 417. Nevertheless, man should worship the Holy One, blessed be He, with gladness and show joy in his service. Corresponding to the two, gladness and singing, are the two prayers and two daily offerings; of the two, gladness is in the morning and singing in the evening. Therefore, \"The one lamb shall you offer in the morning, and the other lamb shall you offer at evening\" (Bemidbar 28:4). 418. The evening service is therefore optional, since at that time she distributes prey among the legions. It is no time to be blessed but to deal sustenance. In the daytime, she is blessed by the two sides, CHESED AND GVURAH, in morning and evening with gladness and singing. At night, she gives the blessings to those who deserve it. Hence it says, \"She rises also while it is yet night, and gives food to her household...\" (Mishlei 31:15). 41. \"Let my prayer be set forth before You like incense\" Rabbi Chizkiyah discusses the title verse, explaining why incense is burned during the morning and evening services. We learn that incense is a token of gladness and creates bonds between the Sfirot, removing death, accusations, and anger, so they will have no power over the world. Rabbi Chizkiyah then explains to us the significance of the \"evening oblation\", mentioned in the title verse. The Relevance of this Passage "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" The mystical power associated with the burning of incense is ignited in these verses, helping to remove from our midst the dark influences of the prosecuting Angel of Death. 419. Rabbi Chizkiyah opened the discussion with the verse, \"Let my prayer be set forth before You like incense; and the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice\" (Tehilim 141:2). HE ASKS: Why does it mention the \"evening sacrifice\" and not the morning service, for it does not say, 'Let my prayer be set in the morning'? HE ANSWERS: We have learned from the words, \"Let my prayer be set forth before You like incense\" that incense is a token of gladness, as it is written: \"Oil and incense rejoice the heart\" (Mishlei 27:9). Therefore, when he lit the candles, the priest used to offer incense, as it says, \"When he dresses the lamps, he shall burn incense on it. And when Aharon lights the lamps at evening, he shall burn incense upon it\" (Shemot 30:7-8). In the morning, HE BURNS INCENSE because of the joy brought by the season, AS MORNING IS A TIME OF JOY, and in the evening HE BURNS INCENSE to bring joy to the left side, as befits. Incense is ever a sign of joy. 420. Come and see how incense ties bonds BETWEEN THE SFIROT. It is attached above and below and removes death, accusations, and anger so they will have no power over the world, as it says, \"And Moshe said to Aharon. Take a censer, and put fire in it from off the altar, and put on incense, and take it quickly... and ran... and made atonement for the people. And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed\" (Bemidbar 17:11-13). For no evil aspect or accuser can exist before incense. Therefore, it brings gladness and connection among everything. 421. At the time of Minchah, when Judgment rests upon the world, David was intent upon that prayer OF THE INCENSE, as it is written: \"Let my prayer be set forth before You like incense.\" This prayer which he offered removed the wrath of strict judgment which now ruled IN THE EVENING through the power of incense which rejects and removes wrath and any accusation in the world. Hence it says \"evening sacrifice,\" for IT IS IN THE TIME OF MINCHAH THAT judgment has sway upon the world. 422. Come and see: When the Temple was destroyed, it was burned at the time of Minchah. Therefore it is written, \"Woe to us! for the day declines, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out\" (Yirmeyah 6:4). The evening shadows are the accusers in the world, and the wrath of judgment that are in wait at the time. We have therefore learned that it behooves man to pray with great intention at all prayers, but at Minchah more than the rest, since judgment then rests upon the world. This is why it was Yitzchak who instituted the prayer of Minchah, WHICH IS OF JUDGMENT AND THE LEFT, as we have already explained. "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 42. A formidable mountain While walking, Rabbi Yosi, Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Chizkiyah encounter a formidable mountain. Although Rabbi Yosi is initially afraid of the danger they may encounter, knowing that where danger is obvious, one should be afraid, the three continue on. Since all three are worthy of the Shechinah's protection, and knowing that demons and evil spirits will not attack a threesome, the companions are assured that no harm will come to them. They then discuss the verse, \"The angel who redeemed me\" Through their discourse, we learn that the \"angel\" is an allusion to the Shechinah. As long as man prays to God before he begins a journey, the Shechinah accompanies him and delivers him from harm. The Relevance of this Passage The protective Light from the righteous threesome of Rabbis Yosi, Yehuda, and Chizkiyah filters into our lives, safeguarding us from unseen negative forces and evil entities that can wreak havoc in our lives. The blessings of The Creator emanate from these words, giving us further protection in our journeys, both physical and spiritual. 423. While they were walking, they reached a mountain. Rabbi Yosi said: This mountain is formidable, let us not remain here but walk on. Rabbi Yehuda said: If you were solitary, I would advise it, for we have learned that he who walks alone on the road endangers his life, but this does not apply to three. Also, each of us is worthy OF PROTECTION, that the Shechinah will not depart from him. 424. Rabbi Yosi said: We have learned that a man should not rely on a miracle. We know this from Shmuel, as it is written: \"How can I go? If Shaul hears it, he will kill me\" (I Shmuel 16:2), and Shmuel was more worthy OF A MIRACLE than us. He said to him: Even so THAT HE WAS WORTHIER OF A MIRACLE THAN US, he was alone, and the danger was obvious, FOR IT WAS CERTAIN THAT SHAUL WOULD HEAR OF IT AND KILL HIM. But we are three, and there is no danger in sight, TO WIT, IT IS NOT CERTAIN. If it be evil spirits, DEMONS, we have learned that they do not appear before or hurt a threesome; if it is a robber, there are none here, since the mountain is far from inhabited places, and there are no people here, but there is fear of wild beasts here. 425. He opened the discussion saying: \"The angel who redeemed (lit. 'redeems') me...\" (Beresheet 48:16). HE ASKS: It says \"redeems,\" while it should have been 'who redeemed.' Why the present tense? HE REPLIES: This is because he abides always with people, and never abandons a righteous man. Come and see: The angel who redeems me is the Shechinah, who continually accompanies man, never turns from him as long as he observes the precepts of the Torah. A man should therefore be careful not to go out alone on the road. HE ASKS: What is 'alone'? HE ANSWERS: A man should be careful to keep the precepts of the Torah, so that the Shechinah shall not depart from him, and he will have to go alone, unaccompanied by the Shechinah. 426. Come and see: When a man sets out on his way, he should pray before his Master in order to draw the Shechinah upon him, and then go out on his way, joined by the Shechinah, who would redeem him on the way and save him in time of need. "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 427. It is written that Ya'akov said: \"If Elohim will be with me,\" referring to the union with the Shechinah \"and will keep me in this way\" (Beresheet 28:20) to deliver him from any HARM. Ya'akov was solitary at the time, and the Shechinah walked before him. So much more for friends with the words of the Torah among them. 428. Rabbi Yosi said: What shall we do? If we stay here, the day declines and if we climb, it is a great and formidable mountain and I fear the wild beasts. Rabbi Yehuda said: I am amazed at you THAT YOU ARE SO AFRAID. Rabbi Yosi said to him: We have learned that a man should not rely on a miracle, since the Holy One, blessed be He, does not perform miracles at all times. He said to him: This is true for a lone man, but we are three. With words of the Torah between us, and the Shechinah with us, I have no fear. 429. While they were walking they saw a rock with a cave in it. Rabbi Yehuda said: Let us climb to that rock, for I see a cave in it. They went there and saw the cave. Rabbi Yosi said: I am afraid, lest this cave is a lair of beasts, which might harm us. 430. Rabbi Yehuda said to Rabbi Chizkiyah, I see that Rabbi Yosi is afraid. You might say that this is since he is a sinner, for whoever fears is a sinner, as it is written: \"The sinners in Tzion are afraid\" (Yeshayah 33:14). He is no sinner BUT A RIGHTEOUS MAN, and it is written, \"But the righteous are bold as a lion\" (Mishle 28:1). Rabbi Yosi said: It is because danger is obvious AND WHEREVER DAMAGE IS OBVIOUS ONE SHOULD BE AFRAID. 43. Three watches Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Chizkiyah, and Rabbi Yosi enter a cave to rest for the night. They divide the night into three watches and begin discussing the verse, \"I will sing the mercies of The Creator forever.\" We learn that Avraham is aligned completely with the attribute of Chesed. Therefore, God tested him so that he would be included in judgment, thus perfecting him. Another explanation reveals that this verse indicates God's kindness and truth to all creatures. We then learn that God revealed the secret of Faith to Avraham. Avraham in turn recognized that the world, the secret of Malchut, was created by judgment, but could not have endured without Chesed, mercy. The discussion next turns to the verse, \"In the beginning.\" We learn that this phrase includes the Female Principle and Chochmah as one. The first building of the world, the Female Principle, derived its existence from Chesed. On the second day it was included in Gvurah, thereby perfecting Zeir Anpin. After discussing the verse, \"I have made a Covenant with My chosen\", the rabbis speak of the verse, \"I have sworn to David My servant.\" We're told that this oath is the secret of Faith and indicates that the Female Principle and Yesod will be separated only during the time of exile. During this joyless time, God finds pleasure only when Yisrael below study the Torah and sanctify the Holy Name. Rabbi Yosi then opens a discussion of the verse, \"Whereupon are its foundations fastened?\" This question concerns the foundation upon which the seven pillars of the world rest. That is, if the universe rests on the seven pillars of the world, upon what do the seven pillars rest? There follows a discourse on \"the foundation stone\", the central point of the world found in Jerusalem, and we learn about the three watches of the night, during which the angels sing and chant praises to God. The Relevance of this Passage A delicate balance of judgement and mercy is attained within our souls, giving us the ability to share and love others in a pure and spiritual manner. Judgement, sweetened with the appropriate measure of mercy, is akin to a devoted parent reprimanding their child out of love and concern for the child's welfare. Because the universe reflects all of our behavioral actions towards others back at us, it is vital that we extend mercy and judgement in proper measure so that life treats us kindly in return. "},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 431. RABBI YEHUDA said TO RABBI CHIZKIYAH, If harm is probable, it is so AND WE SHOULD BE AFRAID, but it is not probable FOR WE SEE HERE NO BEASTS WHICH COULD HARM US. And after we enter the cave, WE ARE SAFE for no evil will follow to harm us. THEREFORE IT IS SAID: \"BUT THE RIGHTEOUS ARE BOLD AS A LION.\" They entered the cave. Rabbi Yehuda said: We shall divide the night into three watches. Each of us will stand guard at one watch of the night and we shall keep awake. 432. Rabbi Yehuda opened the discussion saying: \"A Maskil of Eitan the Ezrachie\" (Tehilim 89:1). This hymn was sung by the patriarch Avraham when he strove to serve the Holy One, blessed be He, by doing kindness with the people of the world, in making them all acknowledge that the Holy One, blessed be He, reigns over the land. He is called Eitan (lit. 'strong') since he was strongly attached to the Holy One, blessed be He. 433. \"I will sing the mercies (Heb. chassadim) of Hashem forever\" (Tehilim 89:1): HE ASKS: Why is singing come from the side of the pious (Heb. chassidim) WHO ARE OF THE RIGHT COLUMN, SEEING THAT SINGING COMES FROM THE LEFT COLUMN? HE ANSWERS: Here the left is included within the right. Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, tried Avraham and tested him. We learned that Yitzchak was 37 at the time OF THE BINDING. Why does it say that He tried Avraham? It should have said that He tried Yitzchak. The reason it says that He tried Avraham is to make him be of Judgment, properly included in Judgment, SINCE HE WAS WHOLLY OF THE ATTRIBUTE OF CHESED. In this way will he be perfected. Therefore, \"I will sing the Mercies of Hashem forever,\" SINCE HE WAS ALREADY INCLUDED OF THE LEFT COLUMN, WHENCE SINGING COMES FROM. 434. Another explanation for: \"I will sing the Mercies of Hashem forever.\" These are the mercies that the Holy One, blessed be He, does by the world. \"With my mouth I will make known your faithfulness to all generations\" refers to the kindness and truth He confers upon all. It is the faith in the Holy One, blessed be He, that Avraham spread in the world, and caused Him to be mentioned on the tongue of all creatures. Therefore \"with my mouth I will make known Your faithfulness.\" 435. The Holy One, blessed be He, revealed to Avraham the secret of faith, WHICH IS THE NUKVA. When he knew it, AVRAHAM knew that the world was created and existed for his sake, FOR HE IS THE SECRET OF CHESED. Hence, \"For I have said: 'The world is built by love (lit. 'Chesed')'\" (Tehilim 89:3). For when the Holy One, blessed be He, created the universe, THE NUKVA, He saw the world could not endure, so He extended His right hand, WHICH IS CHESED, and it endured. If He had not extended His right upon it, it would not have existed since this world, THE SECRET OF THE NUKVA, was created by Judgment AND THEREFORE CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT CHESED, as we have already explained. "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 436. We have learned that the secret of: \"In the beginning\" is that there are two principals in one. Though we said of it that it is the beginning from below upward, WHICH IS MALCHUT, \"the beginning\" also MEANS BEGINNING from above downward, WHICH IS CHOCHMAH; TO WIT, BINAH RETURNED TO BE CHOCHMAH. We have explained the word \"In (the letter Bet) the beginning\" as in the house (Heb. bet) of the Holy of Holies, WHICH IS THE NUKVA, THE HOUSE of the beginning, WHICH IS CHOCHMAH. The word \"IN THE BEGINNING\" includes THE NUKVA AND CHOCHMAH as one. 437. By this house, the world, THE NUKVA, was created, TO WIT, SHE IS BUILT AS A HOUSE FOR CHOCHMAH, BY RECEIVING FROM THE LEFT COLUMN AND THEREFORE LACKING IN CHASSADIM. Yet it exists only through the right, CHESED, FOR CHOCHMAH CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT CHESED. We have already explained that the word \"Behibar'am (Eng. 'when they were created')\" (Beresheet 2:4) has the same letters as 'BeAvraham' (Eng. 'in Avraham'), THE SECRET OF CHESED. Therefore it is written: \"For I have said: 'The world is built by Chesed.'\" The first building of the world, THE NUKVA, derived its existence from the light of the first day; NAMELY CHESED. Then on the second day, it was included within the left, WHICH IS GVURAH, and heaven, ZEIR ANPIN, was perfected by them, as it is written: \"You do establish Your faithfulness in the heavens\" (Tehilim 89:3). 438. Another explanation for: \"You do establish Your faithfulness in the heavens\" is that the heaven, ZEIR ANPIN, was established by Chassadim, and the secret of faith, THE NUKVA, was established by them, AS IT SAYS \"THE WORLD IS BUILT BY CHESED.\" THUS, THE HEAVEN INSPIRED CHESED UPON THE NUKVA CALLED 'WORLD', AND HENCE IT IS SAID: \"YOU DO ESTABLISH YOUR FAITHFULNESS IN THE HEAVENS.\" For THE NUKVA cannot be established save by heaven, ZEIR ANPIN. 439. \"I have made a covenant with My chosen.\" THE COVENANT is the secret of faith CONFERRED UPON DAVID. Another explanation is that THE COVENANT is the righteous, YESOD, from whom blessings flow upon the lower beings. The holy living creatures, WHICH ARE ANGELS, are all blessed by the abundance poured upon the lower beings. Therefore it is written, \"I have made a covenant with My chosen,\" FOR HE WILL BE WORTHY OF THE COVENANT. 440. \"I have sworn to David My servant\" (Tehilim 89:3). This oath is the secret of faith, WHICH IS THE NUKVA, which is always supported by the righteous, YESOD. This oath is forever, so they will never be separated, save at the time of exile WHEN THEY WILL BE SEPARATED, when the abundance of blessings is withheld, the secret of faith cannot be perfected and there is no joy. At night, also, no joys come before the King. 441. Though joys do not waken up AT NIGHT, angels stand and chant hymns outside the King's temple. At midnight, the awakening rises from below upward. The Holy One, blessed be He, then awakens all the celestial armies to weep, and strikes the firmament. There is trembling high and low. "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 442. He finds no pleasure save when there is awakening below to the Torah. Then the Holy One, blessed be He, and all the souls of the righteous listen joyfully to the sound, and He is pleased. Since the day the Temple was destroyed below, the Holy One, blessed be He, swore that He would not enter the celestial Jerusalem until Yisrael would enter the terrestrial Jerusalem, as it is written: \"The Holy One in the midst of you: and I will not come into the city\" (Hoshea 11:9), WHICH MEANS THAT \"THE HOLY ONE IN THE MIDST OF YOU,\" NEVERTHELESS \"I WILL NOT COME INTO THE CITY,\" WHICH IS THE CELESTIAL JERUSALEM, UNTIL YISRAEL SHALL ENTER THE TERRESTRIAL JERUSALEM . 443. All the singers stand outside THE TEMPLE and chant during the three watches of the night, WHICH CORRESPOND TO THE THREE COLUMNS, all singing certain praises. The hosts of heaven are all awakened by night and Yisrael by day. Sanctification is not recited above until the children of Yisrael recite it below, then all the heavenly hosts sanctify together the Holy Name. Hence, holy Yisrael are sanctified high and low. This is the secret of the verse, \"You shall be holy: for I Hashem your Elohim am holy\" (Vayikra 19:2). 444. Rabbi Yosi opened the discussion saying: \"Whereupon are its foundations fastened?\" (Iyov 38:6). The Holy One, blessed be He, said this TO IYOV. For when He created the universe, THE NUKVA, He put it on pillars, the seven pillars of the world CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, YESOD, AND MALCHUT, as it says \"she has hewn out her seven pillars\" (Mishlei 9:1). Upon what the pillars rest is unknown. 445. HE ANSWERS: It is a very deep and inscrutable secret that the world, THE NUKVA, was not created until He took a stone called \"the foundation stone.\" The Holy One, blessed be He, took it and threw it into the abyss, where it was stuck upside down. From it the world, THE NUKVA, was planted. It is the central point of the world, where the Holy of Holies stands; NAMELY THE FIRST THREE SFIROT OF THE NUKVA. It is alluded to by the verse, \"who laid its corner stone\" (Iyov 38:6), \"a tried stone, a precious corner stone\" (Yeshayah 28:16) as in \"The stone which the builders rejected has become the head stone of the corner\" (Tehilim 118:22). ALL THESE REFER TO THE SECRET OF THE FOUNDATION STONE. 446. Come and see: This stone was created from fire, wind and water. TO WIT, IT RECEIVES FROM THE THREE COLUMNS OF ZEIR ANPIN, and was hardened into one stone, standing upon the abyss. Sometimes, water flows from it and the deeps are filled. This stone stands as a sign in the middle of the universe. It is the stone which Ya'akov set and implanted for the world to expand and be established by. Hence the words: \"And Ya'akov took a stone, and set it up for a pillar\" (Beresheet 31:45). "},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 447. \"And this stone, which I have set for a pillar\" (Beresheet 28:22). HE ASKS: How could this stone be put there by Ya'akov, when if it was created in the beginning, when the Holy One, blessed be He, created the world? HE ANSWERS: He only put it there as a support for the high and low. Therefore it says, \"Which I have set for a pillar,\" \"I put\" so it \"shall be Elohim's house\" (Ibid.), by putting here the upper storey; NAMELY, THAT HE DREW INTO IT THE SUPERNAL MOCHIN. 448. Come and see: This stone has seven eyes, as said: \"Upon one stone are seven eyes\" (Zecharyah 3:9). THE EYES ARE THE SECRET OF CHOCHMAH, AND WHEN CHOCHMAH IS REVEALED BY CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, YESOD, AND MALCHUT OF THE NUKVA IT IS CALLED 'SEVEN EYES'. Why is it called a foundation (Heb. shetiyah) stone? Since the world was planted from it. The word 'shetiyah' contains the letters shat Yah (lit. 'Yah put'), for the Holy One, blessed be He, WHO IS BINAH CALLED YAH, has put it so that the world will be blessed by it, and indeed it is blessed by it. 449. Come and see when the sun sets, IN THE FIRST WATCH AT NIGHT, the Cherubs stand in this place, THE HOLY OF HOLIES, WHICH STANDS ON THE CENTRAL POINT, THE FOUNDATION STONE. They stand there by a miracle THROUGH THE LIGHTS OF BINAH, WHICH DO NOT BELONG TO IT, AND ARE THEREFORE CONSIDERED A MIRACLE. They beat their wings and spread them, and the sound of their wings' song is heard above. Then the angels, who chant at the beginning of the night, start to sing so that the Holy One, blessed be He, will be glorified above and below. What do the wings of the Cherubs chant? \"Behold, bless Hashem, all you servants of Hashem... Lift up your hands in the sanctuary\" (Tehilim 134:1-2). It is then time for the supernal angels to sing. 450. On the second watch, the Cherubs beat their wings above and the sound of their singing is heard. Then the angels of the second watch start to chant. What do the Cherubs' wings sing at that hour? \"They who trust in Hashem shall be like Mount Tzion...\" (Tehilim 125:1). It is then time for the angels of the second watch to sing. 451. On the third watch, the Cherubs beat their wings and chant hymns. They sing, \"Haleluyah! Give praise, O servants of Hashem... Blessed be the name of Hashem...From the rising of the sun...\" (Tehilim 113:1-3). Then all the angels of the third watch sing. "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" 452. All the stars and constellations in the firmament start to sing ON THE THIRD WATCH, as it is written: \"when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of Elohim shouted for joy\" (Iyov 38:7), and \"praise him, all you stars of light\" (Tehilim 148:3), as all these stars of light play music upon the light; TO WIT, THROUGH SINGING LIGHT IS DRAWN. 453. When morning rises, the children of Yisrael follow them with their singing and the Holy One, blessed be He, is glorified from below and from above. Yisrael sing below by day and the supernal angels at night. Then Holy Name is perfected on all sides. 454. All the supernal angels and Yisrael below are strengthened by the stone we referred to. It rises above to be adorned by the fathers by day. By night, the Holy One, blessed be He, ZEIR ANPIN, comes to the Garden of Eden to be delighted by the righteous. 455. Happy are those who are established in their existence and study the Torah at night, since the Holy One, blessed be He, and all the righteous in the Garden of Eden listen to the voices of men who study the Torah, as it is written: \"You that dwells in the gardens, the companions hearken for your voice: cause me to hear it\" (Shir Hashirim 8:13). 456. Come and see: This stone is a precious stone, FOR IT WAS SWEETENED BY BINAH AND IS GOODLY AND WORTHY OF RECEIVING MOCHIN. This is the secret of the verse, \"And you shall set in it settings of stones, even four rows of stones\" (Shemot 28:17). They are the arrangements of the precious stone, the setting of the goodly stone; TO WIT, THEY ARE THE SECRET OF THE MOCHIN OF THE ILLUMINATION OF CHOCHMAH RECEIVED IN MALCHUT ACCORDING TO THE SECRET OF THREE TIMES FOUR WHICH AMOUNT TO TWELVE. For there is another stone, NAMELY MALCHUT THAT WAS NOT SWEETENED IN BINAH, of which it is written, \"And I shall remove the heart of stone.\" \"And I will put my spirit within you\" (Yechezkel 36:26), WHICH MEANS THAT AS LONG AS THE HEART OF STONE IS NOT REMOVED, THE SPIRIT OF HASHEM DOES NOT DWELL IN US, SINCE IT IS NOT SWEETENED BY BINAH. IT IS ALSO CALLED \"a tried stone, a precious corner stone\" (Yeshayah 28:16). 457. In regard to this secret, it is written \"tablets of stone\" (Shemot 31:18), for this is where the stones were hewn, FROM THE PRECIOUS STONE. They are therefore named after this stone. This is the secret of the verse, \"From thence the shepherd, the stone of Yisrael\" (Beresheet 49:24), as we learned, THAT THIS IS TOO THE SECRET OF THE PRECIOUS STONE. "},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" 458. Rabbi Chizkiyah opened the discussion saying: \"And the stones shall be with the names of the children of Yisrael, twelve\" (Shemot 28:21). These are the supernal precious stones called the stones of the place, as it is written: \"And he took of the stones of that place\" (Beresheet 28:11), as has been explained. THESE ARE THE SFIROT OF THE NUKVA, AND THE NUKVA IS CALLED PLACE. \"And the stones shall be with the names of the children of Yisrael\" as there are twelve tribes below, so there above, IN THE NUKVA, twelve tribes which are twelve precious stones. It is also written: \"There the tribes go up, the tribes of Yah, for a testimony unto Yisrael\" (Tehilim 122:4). This is the secret of the supernal Yisrael; NAMELY ZEIR ANPIN WHICH POURS THESE TWELVE UNTO THE NUKVA. They are all there \"to give thanks to the name of Hashem\" (Ibid.), WHICH IS THE NUKVA CALLED THE NAME OF HASHEM. Therefore it is written, \"And the stones shall be with the names of the children of Yisrael.\" 459. Just as there are twelve hours in the day, THE TWELVE OF ZEIR ANPIN, so there are twelve hours at night, THE TWELVE OF THE NUKVA. The daytime ones are above, and the nightly below, THE TWELVE OF ZEIR ANPIN BEING ABOVE AND THOSE OF THE NUKVA BELOW, TO WIT, THEY RECEIVE FROM THE TWELVE OF ZEIR ANPIN WHICH ARE ABOVE. The ones correspond to the others. The twelve nightly hours are divided into three parts, THE THREE WATCHES WE MENTIONED. Numerous legions are stationed beneath them over various grades, all of them in charge by night. They first receive their food, AND THEN CHANT HYMNS, AS IT IS WRITTEN: \"SHE RISES ALSO WHILE IT IS YET NIGHT, AND GIVES FOOD TO HER HOUSEHOLD...\" (MISHLEI 31:15). 460. At midnight, there are two settings on the one side and two settings on the other side. A Supernal Spirit comes out from between them. Then, all the trees in the Garden of Eden start to sing and the Holy One, blessed be He, enters the Garden of Eden. This is described in the verse: \"Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy at the presence of Hashem, because he comes to judge the earth\" (I Divrei Hayamim 16:33), as it is written: \"With righteousness shall he judge the poor\" (Yeshayah 11:4). For justice, ZEIR ANPIN comes in between them and the Garden of Eden is filled with it. 461. And a northern wind is stirred in the world and joy abounds, FOR AFTER THE BALANCING OF THE CENTRAL COLUMN, NORTH IS CLOTHED BY SOUTH, AND CHOCHMAH BY CHASSADIM. THEN THERE IS JOY IN THE ILLUMINATION OF THE NORTH, THE LEFT COLUMN. HE EXPLAINS, The wind, THE CENTRAL COLUMN, blows at the perfumes, THE SECRET OF THE ILLUMINATION OF CHOCHMAH, THROUGH WHICH THE ILLUMINATION OF CHOCHMAH IS CLOTHED BY PERFUMES OF CHASSADIM WITHIN THE SPIRIT, and THE PERFUMES raise odor from below upward, and the righteous are adorned with their crowns MEANING THAT THEY RECEIVE MOCHIN, and enjoy the splendor of the shining mirror, ZEIR ANPIN. 462. Happy are the righteous who attain that supernal light and the light of the mirror which shines to all sides, RIGHT AND LEFT. Each of the righteous receives his appropriate share, according to his deeds in this world. Some of them are in shame before the light since their neighbor has received more to illuminate. This has already been explained. "},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 463. The watches in the night ARE from the setting of night, several accusers are awakened to roam about the world and the ports OF LIGHTS are closed. THIS IS THE FIRST WATCH. Afterwards, DURING THE SECOND WATCH, all sorts OF EMISSARIES OF JUDGMENT ARE ROUSED as we explained, THAT THE SECOND WATCH PERTAINS TO THE LEFT COLUMN, THE NORTH WIND, FOR AS LONG AS IT IS NOT CONNECTED WITH THE SOUTH WIND, WHICH IS OF THE RIGHT, MANY JUDGMENTS WILL COME FROM IT. At midnight IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SECOND WATCH, the northern wind descends from above downward and holds on to night, WHICH IS THE NUKVA, until the end of the second watch. 464. Then, AT THE THIRD WATCH, the south side, CHESED, is aroused TO BE ATTACHED TO THE NORTH THROUGH THE STRENGTH OF THE CENTRAL COLUMN until morning. When morning comes, SOUTH AND NORTH ARE ALREADY ATTACHED TO THE NUKVA. Then the children of Yisrael come below with their prayer and request and raise her above TO ZEIR ANPIN until she ascends to be concealed among THE LIGHTS OF ZEIR ANPIN. TO WIT, SHE REDUCED HERSELF AND BECAME NULL TO THE GRADE OF ZEIR ANPIN, then receives blessings from the King's head. 465. She is blessed from the dew that flows UNTO ZEIR ANPIN from above. The dew is divided TO ILLUMINATE on several sides, BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT. AND THOUGH THE DEW ITSELF IS BUT THE LIGHT OF CHESED, myriads of grades are sustained by it, which will raise the dead in the future. This is the meaning of the verse: \"Awake and sing, you that dwell in dust: for your dew is as the dew on herbs (lit. 'of lights')\" (Yeshayah 26:19); TO WIT, the dew from the supernal lights which shine above. 466. While they were sitting, midnight arrived. Rabbi Yehuda said to Rabbi Yosi, Now that the north wind is awakened at midnight, it is time when the Holy One, blessed be He, longs for the voices of the righteous in this world who are occupied in the Torah. The Holy One, blessed be He, now listens to them. Let us not stop from studying the Torah in this place. 44. \"The angel who redeemed,\" part two The redeeming angel, Matatron, receives blessings and then bestows them upon the world. This angel is male when procuring blessings for the world, and is female when there is judgment in the world. The angel includes all the colors--red, white, and green--and has many shapes. The Relevance of this Passage The power of redemption, blessing, and balance between mercy and judgement and male and female energies, is made available to the readers of this ancient text. This effect is achieved through a mystical connection to the angel Matatron. 467. He opened the discussion saying: \"The angel who redeemed me from all evil.\" We have studied it already, yet it is written, \"Behold, I send an angel before you...\" (Shemot 23:20). This is the angel who redeems the world, CALLED THE REDEEMING ANGEL, who protects people, AS IT SAYS \"TO KEEP YOU IN THE WAY\" (IBID.). It secures blessings for the whole world, first receiving them, and then providing them to the world; NAMELY THE ANGEL MATATRON. It is therefore written, \"Behold, I send an angel before you\" and \"and I will send an angel before you\" (Ibid. 33:2). "},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" 468. This angel is now male, now female. When procuring blessings for the world he is male and called male. As a male, he orders blessings for the female. And when there is judgment in the world, she is called female, and as a pregnant female, she is filled with judgments, and is then called a female. Therefore, now he is male, and now she is female. All this is one mystery. 469. It is likewise written: \"And the bright blade of a revolving sword\" (Beresheet 3:24); NAMELY there are angel messengers in the world which revolve and turn into several shapes, sometimes female and sometimes male, now Judgment and now Mercy, and all is the same matter. In the same manner, this angel has many shapes, and all the colors, WHITE, RED, AND GREEN, of the world, THE NUKVA, are in this place. This is the mystery of: \"As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Hashem\" (Yechezkel 1:28). THE APPEARANCE OF THE BOW, THE NUKVA, CONTAINS THE THREE COLORS. Since the angel has the three colors, he leads the world. 45. Three colors Here we first learn that the colors white, red, and green correspond to the Right, Left, and Central Columns respectively. These colors are connected, they encircle the realm of Malchut, and they are reflected in the Malchut. The illumination of Malchut, we learn, is concealed from those below. Whoever tries to behold her will be rejected if they lack the appropriate merit. And whoever understands how to unite and adjust the three colors properly will be preserved in this world and in the next. The Relevance of this Passage The ability to balance and manage the three primal spiritual energy forces known as Right, Left and Central Columns is bestowed up the reader. The colors white, red, and green embody these three forces and they shine brightly in our souls so that our lives are more balanced, harmonious, and aligned with the spiritual structure of creation. This balance brings forth the wisdom to know when and how to receive for the purpose of sharing with others. Tosefta (addendum) 470. Exalted, beloved men of intelligence, behold THE SOULS FROM THE RIGHT COLUMN. Litigants with a sailor stick, approach so you may know, THOSE OF THE LEFT COLUMN, WHENCE ARE JUDGMENTS. Those of you of intelligent eyes, OF THE CENTRAL COLUMN, WHO GAINED CHOCHMAH RECEIVED THROUGH TEVUNAH, know that when it came up in the wish of the mystery of mysteries to issue forth three colors bound together, the white, red, and green, THE THREE COLUMNS: RIGHT IS WHITE, LEFT IS RED, AND THE CENTRAL GREEN, the three colors combined and mingled together. Then the lower shovel, THE NUKVA, was dyed and came out of these colors. "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" 471. All these colors, WHITE, RED, AND GREEN, are reflected IN THE NUKVA, a looking mirror, SINCE ONLY IN IT ONE CAN SEE when it is crystal-like. When he struck it, THE NUKVA was seen outside. The three colors circle it TO ITS RIGHT, LEFT AND MIDDLE; the color goes up and down. TO WIT, THE WHITE COLOR, RIGHT, GOES TO BE INCLUDED WITHIN THE LEFT; THE RED COLOR, LEFT, GOES UP, NAMELY SHINES FROM BELOW UPWARD; THE GREEN IN THE MIDDLE GOES DOWN, BY SHINING FROM ABOVE DOWNWARD. There are executioners in charge within it-WHO PUNISH THOSE WHO DRAW THE ILLUMINATION OF THE LEFT FROM ABOVE DOWNWARD. 472. The colors that are connected which encircle THE NUKVA, raise her up by day, and she descends by night. SHE IS LIKE a burning candle, WHOSE ILLUMINATION is seen by night, and by day it is concealed AND CANNOT BE SEEN. The light is hidden in 248 worlds, which all shine within her from above downward into 365 parts, which are concealed and covered from below. 473. Whoever solicits to attain her will break the wings WHICH CONCEAL HER and the hidden Klipot, and then open the gates. Whoever may look will behold with knowledge and intelligence as if from behind a wall, save the exalted faithful prophet Moshe, who saw it eye to eye above, where it is inconceivable. 474. Whoever did not merit it is rejected outside. Several battalions of angels are ready for him, to go out to him and escort him out so he will not behold the pleasure of the King. Woe to the wicked in the world, who have not the merit of beholding, as it says, \"But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered...\" (Bemidbar 4:20). 475. Rabbi Yehuda said: I was looking and, behold, through these lights, THE THREE COLORS, the souls of the righteous are looking. When they cleave to this place, THE NUKVA, the souls of the righteous look from among these lights. The colors, WHITE, RED, AND GREEN, go up to be included together. Happy is he who knows how to comprise and unite them all as one, and correct all where it is needed to be, high above. Then is man preserved in this world and in the World to Come. (End of Tosefta) 46. \"The king's strength also loves judgment\" Rabbi Yosi explains that the title verse refers to God and the power by which He strengthened the realm of Malchut. This power was derived through judgment. Malchut, and therefore the congregation of Yisrael, was established through judgment--that is, the Mochin that includes Chochmah and Chassadim together. The Relevance of this Passage Spiritual balance between mercy and judgment is created within our souls and the world around us by virtue of the spiritual energy bottled up within the mystical words of this ancient text. Balance is critical if we are to live a life of fulfillment. For instance, if the scales are tipped towards the side of judgement, we'll find the world extra hard on us. The objective of this passage is to balance our ability to extend mercy and judgement to others so "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" that we receive the same compassionate blend of judgment and mercy from the world. 476. Rabbi Yosi opened the discussion saying: \"The king's strength also loves judgment (or justice), you do establish equity\" (Tehilim 99:4). \"The king's strength also loves judgment\" refers to the Holy One, blessed be He; NAMELY THE NUKVA WHO LOVES JUSTICE, WHICH IS MOCHIN INCLUDED OF RIGHT AND LEFT TOGETHER. \"The king's strength\" is the power with which the Holy One, blessed be He, strengthened THE NUKVA, which comes only through justice, as it is written: \"The king by justice establishes the land\" (Mishlei 29:4) BY BEING INCLUDED OF CHOCHMAH AND CHASSADIM TOGETHER, CHASSADIM ON THE RIGHT AND CHOCHMAH ON THE LEFT. 477. This is the reason SCRIPTURE SAYS, \"The king's strength also loves justice,\" for the Congregation of Yisrael, THE NUKVA, is not established save through justice, WHICH IS MOCHIN INCLUDED OF CHOCHMAH AND CHASSADIM TOGETHER. Since it is fed thereof, THE SECRET OF CHASSADIM and all the blessings it receives are from there, THE SECRET OF CHOCHMAH. Therefore, \"the king's strength also loves Judgment,\" for all it desires and craves is to receivejustice. \"You do establish equity (lit. 'equities')\" is the secret of the two Cherubs below CALLED EQUITIES, who rectify and render the world inhabited. 47. \"Haleluyah! Give praise, O servants of Hashem\" The rabbis explain that when one person praises another, the praise should be in accordance with that person's merit. This is because praise given that is not deserved becomes a reproach. Through a discussion of the title verse, we learn that the name 'Haleluyah' is among the highest kinds of praise to God since it contains both the highest name as well the praise itself. The rest of the title portion reveals the name of the praised and those who address the praise. This means that they, the servants of The Creator, praised the place called \"the Name of Yah,\" Malchut. We're then told of the significance of the Yud ? in the Hebrew translation of the word let, and its relationship to \"the drawing from the most hidden.\" The discourse then reveals the meaning of the words, \"From the rising of the sun to its setting.\" This alludes to Zeir Anpin, whence the sun shines and Malchut, the place to which Faith is bound. The Relevance of this Passage The wisdom to offer praise to others with purity and in the appropriate measure is awakened in us. The Holy Name of \"Haleluyah\" and the letter Yud ? connect us to lofty levels in the spiritual atmosphere, arousing Light, blessing, and praise throughout our physical world [Malchut]. We are inspired to become worthy of praise through spiritual growth and transformation. 478. Rabbi Chizkiyah opened the discussion with the verse, \"Haleluyah! Give praise, O servants of Hashem, praise the name of Hashem\" (Tehilim 113:1). Let us examine this verse. After saying Haleluyah, why ADD \"Give praise, O servants of Hashem\" and then \"praise the name of Hashem\"? HE ANSWERS: We have so learned that whoever praises someone else should do so in accordance with his merits, and praise should be the extent of that person's merit. We have learned that he who gives him praise which he does not deserve, it is considered to be a reproach; TO WIT, his blame shall be revealed. Therefore, he who mourns another man should do so according to his merit and no more. For the praise might turn EVENTUALLY into blame. Praise should always agree with merits. 479. Come and see: \"Haleluyah.\" There is here a supreme praise to the Master of everything, whom no eye can behold or know, who is most hidden. Who is He? THE NAME OF Yah, the highest name of all. "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" 480. Therefore \"Haleluyah (lit. 'praise Yah')\" contains a praise and a name in one. Here it is undisclosed since he says Haleluyah, yet does not mentions the speaker, or to whom the word is addressed. As the name Yah is undisclosed, so is the praise, and I do not know who are those who address the praise. All should be thus covered in the supernal secret. After being concealed by the supernal secret, it is now revealed and said: \"Give praise, O servants of Hashem, praise the name of Hashem,\" BY WHICH THE NAME OF THOSE WHO PRAISE AND THE PRAISED ARE MADE KNOWN. This is because the place is not as hidden as that supernal and most hidden of all, WHICH IS YAH, but is the place called name, NAMELY THE NUKVA, as it is written: \"Whose name is called by the name of Hashem\" (II Shmuel 6:2), WHICH MEANS THE NUKVA CALLED NAME. 481. The first one, YAH, is covered and undisclosed, while the second, THE NAME OF YAH, is both undisclosed and disclosed. And since it may be revealed, SCRIPTURE says that they praise the place CALLED THE NAME OF YAH. Who are those who praise? The servants of Hashem, who are worthy of praising this place, THE NUKVA. 482. \"Blessed be the name of Hashem\" (Tehilim 113:2). HE ASKS: Why does it say here \"be (Heb. yehi-or Yud-Hei-Yud)\"? HE REPLIES: This word is the secret of drawing from that supernal, hidden place we mentioned, Yah, unto the secret of the covenant, the lower Yud which resembles the upper Yud, the beginning is like the end. 483. Therefore 'Yud-Hei-Yud' is the secret of drawing from the most hidden, THE FIRST YUD OF YUD-ALEPH-HEI-DALET-VAV-NUN-HEI- YUD unto the lower grade, THE LAST YUD OF YUD-ALEPH-HEI- DALET-VAV-NUN-HEI-YUD. THIS IS THE SECRET OF THE TWO YUD OF YUD-HEI-YUD. With its support the Creation prevailed, as it says, \"Let (Heb. yehi) there be firmament,\" \"let there be lights,\" and \"let there be light.\" 484. In all the works above, THE FIRMAMENT, LIGHT AND THE LIGHTS, it is written Yud-Hei-Yud; in all the works below, THE EARTH, THE SEAS AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM, it does not say Yud- Hei-Vav, since the secret OF YUD-HEI-VAV, the drawing from the most hidden, THE FIRST YUD OF YUD-ALEPH-HEI-DALET-VAV-NUN- HEI-YUD, does not prevail save by the supernal works above and not those below. 485. Through this, the most Holy Name is blessed by everything. It is therefore written: \"Blessed be (Yud-Hei-Yud) the name of Hashem.\" \"From the rising of the sun\" (Tehilim 113:3) is the supernal place whence the sun, ZEIR ANPIN, shines from, the place of the supernal undisclosed head, THE HEAD OF ARICH ANPIN. "},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 486. \"To its setting\" (Ibid.): To this place to which faith, THE NUKVA, is well bound, BEING THE PLACE OF THE UNISON BETWEEN ZEIR ANPIN AND THE NUKVA, whence blessings issue forth to all, and the world, THE NUKVA, is fed thereof, as we learned. Hence this place, THE NUKVA, is fed and blessed from above. All depends upon awakening below, when the servants of Hashem are aroused while blessing the holy name, THE NUKVA, like we said. And when she is revealed, it is written, \"Give praise, O servants of Hashem, praise the name of Hashem.\" 487. By this time, the morning broke and they came out of the cave, not having slept that night. They walked along the way and when they came out of the mountains, they sat down and prayed. They reached a village where they sat the whole day. At night, they slept until midnight when they rose to study the Torah. 48. \"And he blessed them that day\" The discussion begins with an interpretation of the title verse. We are told that the phrase \"that day\" signifies the unity between Zeir Anpin and Binah. \"By you\" alludes to the unity of the blessings from both high and low grades. \"Yisrael,\" we learn, is an allusion to Yisrael-Saba, who receives blessings from above and confers them on Malchut. The rabbis then explain why the name Efraim is mentioned first in the verse, \"Elohim make you as Efraim and Menashe.\" The first explanation of the title verse concludes with the teaching that love of one's grandchildren often surpasses the love of one's own children. Rabbi Yosi provides an additional explanation for the title verse, revealing that men are blessed first, since women are blessed only through the blessings of men. The Relevance of this Passage In order for a lamp to illuminate a darkened room, it must be connected to a source of energy. Likewise, for spiritual Light to brighten our darkened world, we must connect ourselves to the source of energy that powers the entire cosmos. The word \"that day\" indicates a connection between Zeir Anpin and Binah, two Sfirot that occupy the Upper Worlds. The phrases \"By you\" and \"Yisrael\" correspond to the connection between our souls and the entire physical dimension to Zeir Anpin. Spiritual current is now free to flow and illuminate all of mankind once these cosmic \"power stations\" are connected to one another. 488. \"And he blessed them that day, saying (Heb. lemor), 'By you shall Yisrael bless'\" (Beresheet 48:20). HE ASKS: What is the meaning of \"that day\"? It would have been enough to say just \"And he blessed them.\" Also the word 'lemor' is normally spelled without Vav, but here there is an additional Vav. What is the reason for the difference? 489. HE ANSWERS: \"And he blessed them that day\" is a mystery. That day is the secret of the grade in charge over the blessings above, BINAH; \"That day\" is the day, ZEIR ANPIN, which is from the supernal place called \"that (lit. 'he')\" WHICH IS BINAH. \"That day\" INDICATES THAT there is no separation between \"day\" and \"he.\" Wherever IT IS SAID \"that day,\" there are two grades: the supernal grade, BINAH, and the lower, ZEIR ANPIN, when they are together; TO WIT, WHEN ZEIR ANPIN ASCENDED TO BINAH AND BECAME LIKE IT. "},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" 490. This is why when Ya'akov wished to bless Yosef's children, he blessed them all as one by the unison of high and low, so that their blessing would prevail. He then included them all together, saying: \"By you shall Yisrael bless.\" What is \"By you\"? Assuredly this is the secret of unison. First he blessed from below upward, TO WIT, IN \"AND HE BLESSED THEM THAT DAY,\" WHICH IS ZEIR ANPIN AND BINAH TOGETHER, and then he descended into the middle TO ZEIR ANPIN and down TO THE NUKVA. 'Lemor' with Vav is the middle, SINCE VAV IS AN ALLUSION TO ZEIR ANPIN. He then went down, SAYING \"by you,\" WHICH REFERS TO THE NUKVA. Thus THE BLESSING is well formed, being from below upward and from above downward. 491. \"By you shall Yisrael bless\": HE ASKS: What is Yisrael? HE ANSWERS: It is Yisrael Saba, ZEIR ANPIN OF BINAH. It does not say, 'Shall Yisrael be blessed' but \"Shall Yisrael bless,\" WHICH MEANS HE WILL BLESS OTHERS. This is because Yisrael SABA receives blessings from above and then blesses all through the low grade, THE NUKVA, by saying \"By you shall Yisrael bless, saying:\" WHICH MEANS THAT THROUGH \"BY YOU (HEB. BECHA),\" BY THE NUKVA, YISRAEL SABA SHALL BLESS ALL. 492. \"Elohim make you as Efraim and Menashe\": He mentions Efraim first, since Efraim is called by the name of Yisrael. Whence do we know that? The tribe of Efraim left before the time was over of the Egyptian enslavement, by trying to force time and come out of exile, and their foes rose against them and killed them. It is written, \"Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Yisrael\" (Yechezkel 37:11). From this, it is understood that EFRAIM IS CONSIDERED AS YISRAEL, since it says \"the whole house of Yisrael.\" Ya'akov therefore put Efraim before Menashe. Thus Efraim journeyed on the west side, which was his path, AS THE SHECHINAH IS ON THE WEST, WHO COMPRISES ALL YISRAEL. THEREFORE EFRAIM, BEING CALLED YISRAEL, WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE SHECHINAH. 493. Come and see: Why did the blessing he gave to Yosef's children precede that of his own children? HE ANSWERS: This teaches us that love of grandchildren surpasses the love of one's own children. Therefore, SINCE HIS LOVE FOR HIS GRANDCHILDREN IS STRONGER THAN THAT FOR HIS CHILDREN, he blessed them first. 494. \"And he blessed them that day, saying\": Rabbi Yosi opened the discussion saying: \"Hashem has remembered us: He will bless, He will bless the house of Yisrael\" (Tehilim 115:12). WHY IS IT WRITTEN TWICE \"BLESS\"? HE SAYS, \"Hashem has remembered us: He will bless\" refers to the men. \"He will bless the house of Yisrael\" refers to the women. For the men should be blessed first and then the women, since women are blessed only through the blessing of men. When the men are blessed, the women are blessed. THIS MAY BE DERIVED from the verse, if you wish \"And shall make atonement for himself and for his house\" (Vayikra 16:6). One should first atone for himself and only then for his house, SINCE MEN COME BEFORE WOMEN, so that she will be blessed from him. "},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" 495. Come and see: Women are blessed only through men, who are blessed first, and by their blessings they are blessed, AND NEED NO SPECIAL BLESSING FOR THEMSELVES. HE ASKS: How can we account for the words: \"He will bless the house of Yisrael,\" SEEING THAT WOMEN NEED NO SPECIAL BLESSING FOR THEMSELVES? HE ANSWERS: The Holy One, blessed be He, gives an additional blessing to a married man, so that his wife may be blessed from him. So always, the Holy One, blessed be He, gives an extra blessing to a married man, and gives him two portions, the one for him and another for his wife. And he receives everything, his own, and his wife's portion. HENCE THERE IS A SPECIAL BLESSING FOR THE WOMEN \"HE WILL BLESS THE HOUSE OF YISRAEL?,\" SINCE IT IS THEIR OWN PORTION. THOUGH MEN RECEIVE THEIR PORTION TOO, THEY LATER GIVE IT TO THEM, AS EXPLAINED. 496. \"And he blessed them that day\" is joined by the word 'lemor' (saying), with Vav. Here is an allusion to a firstborn son, SINCE VAV ALLUDES TO BIRTHRIGHT, as it is written: \"Yisrael is my son, my firstborn\" (Shemot 4:22) and \"Efraim is my firstborn\" (Yirmeyah 31:8). For this, there is an additional Vav, FOR EFRAIM WHO WAS INCLUDED WITHIN THAT BLESSING. 49. \"Your eyes did see my unshaped flesh\" Rabbi Chizkiyah discourses on the title verse, revealing that before descending to earth, all souls stand before God in the same shape and form that they will possess in this world. The title verse alludes to this fact, since God sees all before they are seen in the world. The Relevance of this Passage Before a soul descends into the physical dimension, it stands before The Creator and promises to complete its correction process, seeking redemption for past life iniquities by way of spiritual transformation. The negative angel Satan and the trappings of our seductive material world cause forgetfulness. We succumb to temptations that glorify our own ego and thus, break our commitment to The Creator. Here we can awaken remembrance of our divine promise and receive inspiration and passion to pursue the path of spiritual transformation. 497. Rabbi Chizkiyah opened the discussion saying: \"Your eyes did see my unshaped flesh; for in Your book all things are written\" (Tehilim 139:16). This verse has been expounded in several places. Yet come and see: All the souls which have existed since the Creation of the world, all stand before the Holy One, blessed be He, before descending into the world, assuming the very shape in which they are seen in the world. In that same appearance of the person's body that stands in this world, so does it stand above. 498. When the soul is ready to descend into the world with the very shape it is about to have in this world, it stands before the Holy One, blessed be He, who adjures it to observe the precepts of the Torah and never transgress them. "},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" 499. Whence do we know that THE SOULS stand before Him? From the verse: \"As Hashem, the Elohim of Yisrael lives, before whom I stood\" (I Melachim 17:1), stood assuredly BEFORE BEING CREATED, as has been explained. Therefore, \"Your eyes did see my unshaped flesh\" before it was seen in the world; \"for in Your book all things are written\" as all the souls in their very shapes are recorded in a book. \"The days also in which they are to be fashioned\" (Tehilim 139:16), indeed they are fashioned, as explained, TO WIT, THEY ARE MADE A GARMENT TO WEAR; \"and there is one not one among them\" (Ibid.), AS NOT ONE DAY in this world could stand properly before its Master. 50. \"The measure of my days, what it is?\" The discussion opens to reveal that the days of the righteous who gain merit through good deeds are blessed from Binah. We're also told that the phrase \"my end\" indirectly alludes to David. Rabbi Yehuda then states that the title verse relates to the seventy years that were taken from Adam and apportioned to David. We learn that David corresponds to Malchut, upon whom the seven Sfirot shine. David wished to know why the rest of the supernal lights had light of their own while he did not--he was, however, denied permission. The Relevance of this Passage The quality and length of one's days is directly affected by the deeds and degree of spiritual change a person seeks and attains in his lifetime. Upon the merit of the righteous, we draw blessings of long life from above [Binah] and shower them upon the entire world [David, the embodiment of Malchut]. We are inspired to use this Light and increased longevity to accomplish our spiritual purpose and correction. 500. Come and see that when a man has merit in this world through good deeds, his days are blessed above from the place called \"the measure of days\" (Tehilim 39:5), WHICH IS BINAH. He opened the discussion saying: \"Hashem, make me to know my end, and the measure of my days, what it is\" (Idib.). This verse has already been explained, yet \"my end\" is the end of the right, which is connected to David. \"The measure of my days\" is in charge of his days, WHICH IS BINAH. 501. Rabbi Yehuda said: I have heard from Rabbi Shimon that this verse talks about the days that were portioned from Adam, seventy years. For we have learned that David had no life whatsoever, but the seventy years given him by Adam. 502. It is a mystery THAT THE FIRMAMENT IS a curtain WHICH CORRESPONDS TO MALCHUT, which serves no purpose, since the moon, MALCHUT, has no light of her own. THE SECRET IS THAT DAVID, WHO CORRESPONDS TO MALCHUT, HAS NO LIFE. Seventy years shine upon her, UPON MALCHUT, on all her sides, BEING THE SECRET OF CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, YESOD, AND MALCHUT OF ZEIR ANPIN, EACH INCLUDES OF TEN, WHICH ALTOGETHER AMOUNT TO SEVENTY. This is the life of David. He therefore desired to learn from the Holy One, blessed be He, this secret of why the moon has no life of her own, and wanted to know of her root. "},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" 503. \"And the measure of my days, what it is\": This is a supernal, undisclosed grade, BINAH, CALLED THE MEASURE OF MY DAY, since it is situated over all the days which form the life OF MALCHUT, AS CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, YESOD, AND MALCHUT ARE DRAWN FROM BINAH, a place which shines upon everything. \"I will know how frail I am\" (Tehilim 39:5). David said: Let me know wherefore I have not MY OWN light, and cannot be like the rest of the supernal lights, which have THEIR OWN lives. Why MY LIGHT IS frail, and wherefore it is withheld from me. This is what David desired to know, but was not given permission to know. 51. All blessings were given to this grade Malchut is called \"a cup of blessing,\" because although she has no light of her own, all the blessings, joy, and goodness are in it and issue from her. All the Sfirot are included in Malchut, and she possesses all the supernal blessings. We therefore recite the Halel prayer to praise Malchut. The three grades of the Halel are the pious, the righteous, and the Congregation of Yisrael, corresponding to the right, left, and central Columns. The Relevance of this Passage The supernal blessings embedded into the world of Malchut are unleashed in all their splendor. The balance and harmony of the Three Column System, and the energy aroused through the prayer, connection known as Halel, are instilled within us as our eyes make contact with the mystical verses composing this passage. 504. Come and see: All the supernal blessings were given to this grade, MALCHUT, so it would bless everything. And though it has not its own light, yet all the blessings, joy and goodness are in it, and issue from it. It is therefore called \"a cup of blessing,\" an actual blessing, as it says, \"The blessing of Hashem, it makes rich\" (Mishlei 10:22), AS THE BLESSING OF HASHEM IS MALCHUT. It is therefore written: \"And full with the blessing of Hashem: possess you the west and the south\" (Devarim 33:23). 505. Hence MALCHUT has a residue of all THE SFIROT, SINCE THEY ARE ALL INCLUDED WITHIN HER, and she is filled by them all and has something from them all. She is blessed from supernal blessings, which were handed to her to confer. HE ASKS: Whence do we know that? HE REPLIES: Rabbi Yitzchak said: Ya'akov blessed Yosef's sons from this place, which was given all the blessings to confer, as it says, \"And you shall be a blessing\" (Beresheet 12:2), WHICH MEANS HE WILL MERIT MALCHUT, THE SECRET OF BLESSING, AND THEN from now on the blessings were delivered to you, SINCE ALL BLESSINGS ARE IN THE HANDS OF MALCHUT. 506. Come and behold: in the same manner SHE IS ESTABLISHED BY THE SEVEN SFIROT OF ZEIR ANPIN, we bless and praise this name, MALCHUT, and hence the Halel (lit. 'praise') prayer we recite during certain days. Rabbi Chiya said: We need three grades to the Halel: the pious, the righteous and Yisrael. The pious are on the right, the righteous on the left and Yisrael on all sides, since the children of Yisrael comprise all, BEING THE CENTRAL COLUMN, WHICH INCLUDES THE TWO COLUMNS RIGHT AND LEFT. THEY CORRESPOND TO THE THREE COLUMNS, WHICH MALCHUT RECEIVES FROM ZEIR ANPIN, THOUGH SHE HAS NOTHING OF HER OWN. Therefore the praise of the Holy One, blessed be He, MALCHUT, was raised above THE SFIROT. Also, wherever the children of Yisrael praise the Holy One, blessed be He, from below, THAT IS, RAISE MAYIN NUKVIN (FEMALE WATERS), His glory is elevated throughout THE SFIROT. "},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" 52. The sound of a wheel rolling The powers appointed over punishment and reward turn the wheel continually. The sound of the chirping of the two birds, Chochmah and Binah, joins with the sound of the wheel, illuminating the lights described in the poem for Shabbat day. Blessings are drawn by a whisper from the Right Column to the Central Column through the sound of the Shofar or ram's horn. When the turning wheel, the Central Column, is filled with Chesed, Chochmah is clothed with Chassadim and ceases to whisper, shining fully. When someone has merit, the wheel brings the illuminations of the three columns under the power of the right, and that person enjoys the illumination of supernal blessings. However, the wheel draws judgment upon he whom does not deserve supernal blessings. The Relevance of this Passage Conversing in the lyrical language of metaphor, the Zohar describes the intimate connection between human behavior, the cosmos, the concepts of punishment and reward, and the spiritual tools of the Torah that can help one draw blessing into their life and remove judgments. By virtue of this discourse, the energy of blessing and the cleansing power of the Light fill our lives so that judgement and mercy shine upon us in perfect measure. Tosefta (addendum) 507. The sound of a wheel rolling from below upward, closed Chariots roll about, a pleasant voice rises and falls, roams about the world. The sound of a Shofar is heard through the depth of the grades and the wheel turns round. 508. Two shovels are placed, THE POWERS APPOINTED OVER PUNISHMENT AND REWARD, DRAWN to the right and left, included within each other by two colors, the one white, and the other red. Both turn the wheel up. When it turns to the right, the white ascends and when it turns to the left, the red descends. The wheel keeps turning and never rests. 509. Two birds, CHOCHMAH AND BINAH OF THE NUKVA, go up and chirp, the one, CHOCHMAH, to the south and the other, BINAH, to the north, and soar in the air. TO WIT, THEY SHINE ONLY UPON THE SIX EXTREMITIES OF CHOCHMAH AND BINAH CALLED AIR. The chirping OF THE BIRDS, WHICH IS THE SECRET OF THE NUKVA, and the pleasant sound of the wheel, THE SECRET OF ZEIR ANPIN, join together and then: \"A Psalm, a poem for the Shabbat day\" (Tehilim 92:1). TO WIT, WHEN THEY JOIN THE LIGHTS ILLUMINATE WHICH ARE DESCRIBED IN THE POEM FOR THE SHABBAT DAY. All the blessings, WHICH ARE THE SECRET OF CHOCHMAH, are drawn by a whisper, clothed by the pleasantness OF THE WHEEL, WHICH IS THE RIGHT COLUMN OF ZEIR ANPIN, WHICH IS CHASSADIM through the love of the sound of the Shofar, WHICH IS THE CENTRAL COLUMN OF ZEIR ANPIN. 510. In order to receive the blessings, SO THAT CHOCHMAH WILL BE CLOTHED BY CHASSADIM, the blessings go down from above, WHICH ARE THE SECRET OF CHOCHMAH, to be treasured deep inside the well, THE NUKVA; TO WIT, IT CANNOT SHINE WITHOUT CHASSADIM. The spring from the well does not cease to whisper, WHICH MEANS IT DOES NOT ILLUMINATE, until the turning wheel is filled, WHICH IS THE CENTRAL COLUMN, THE PRINCIPAL THAT TURNS THE WHEELS. "},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 511. Of the two turning shovels, the one to the right, WHICH ROLLS THE THREE COLUMNS UNDER THE POWER OF THE RIGHT, cries loudly, saying, the illumination of the lights which ascend and descend, SINCE BEING RIGHT, ITS ILLUMINATION GOES FROM ABOVE DOWNWARD, the two thousand worlds, CHOCHMAH AND BINAH CALLED THOUSANDS AND DRAWN FROM THE TWO COLUMNS RIGHT AND LEFT, shine! The middle world inside them, DA'AT, DRAWN FROM THE CENTRAL COLUMN, shine by the light of your Master! All those have eyes; TO WIT, THOSE WORTHY OF ATTAINING CHOCHMAH CALLED EYES, look and open your eyes, to attain this light, this delight. These are the blessings which are drawn from above. When someone has merit, the wheel goes up and turns to the right. TO WIT, IT BRINGS THE ILLUMINATIONS OF THE THREE COLUMNS UNDER THE POWER OF THE RIGHT, and brings and draws them upon he who achieved it, and he takes pleasure in the supernal luminous blessings. Happy are those who attained them. 512. For he who does not achieve it, the wheel turns and the shovel on the left side turns it. TO WIT, IT BRINGS ABOUT THE ILLUMINATION OF THE COLUMNS UNDER THE POWER OF THE LEFT, and brings LIGHT down BY DRAWING THE ILLUMINATION OF THE LEFT FROM ABOVE DOWNWARD, thus drawing Judgment upon he who did not attain it. A voice resounds, saying: Woe to the wicked who have no merit. From the LEFT side, a flame comes out to burn and abides on the head of the wicked. Happy are those who walk the true path in this world and attain the supernal light, the blessings of brightness, as it says, \"And satisfy your soul in drought (also: 'brightness')\" (Yeshayah 58:11). (end of Tosefta). 53. \"Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you\" Rabbi Aba first discourses on the verse, \"He turned to the prayer of the lonely\" He explains that God accepts all public prayers, whether they are from righteous or sinful people. However, when a solitary man offers a prayer to God, he becomes subject to scrutiny. God examines that man's sins and virtues. Therefore, we're told, a man should say his prayers in public. Another explanation for this verse interprets it as a reference to Ya'akov, who is included within the many. Therefore, his prayer is like a public prayer. The discourse then reveals the meaning and significance of the word \"called\" (Heb. vayikra) in a number of contexts. We learn that when Ya'akov called for his sons, they appeared, accompanied by the spirit of the Shechinah. The title verse, we're further told, indicates that Ya'akov commanded his sons to bond themselves to their supernal roots in Malchut, so that he could draw the secret of wisdom upon them. Ya'akov then quoted the title verse and told them of the exile that would occur when the Yisrael entered the Holy Land. The Relevance of this Passage The power of unity and harmony between people underscores this passage of Zohar. When people congregate in love and unity to make connections with the Light of The Creator, the most sinful soul among the group will see his prayer ascend to the same lofty heights as the most righteous soul among the group, such is the power of unity. By connecting us to Ya'akov, who embodies the collective souls of humankind, this passage ensures that all our prayers will be considered to have been made in public and thus, will reach the same majestic heights as the prayers of Ya'akov. 513. \"And Ya'akov called to his sons, and said: 'Gather yourselves together...'\" (Beresheet 49:1). Rabbi Aba opened the discussion saying: \"He turned to the prayer of the lonely and did not despise their prayer\" (Tehilim 102:18). This verse has already been explained, yet the friends found it difficult as to why it says \"turned\" when it should have been 'listened' or 'hearkened.' "},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" 514. HE ANSWERS: All the prayers in the world, THAT IS, THE PUBLIC PRAYERS, are considered prayers, but the prayer of a solitary man does not enter before the holy King, save through great effort. For before the prayer enters to be adorned in its place, the Holy One, blessed be He, examines it and searches that man's sins and virtues. He does not do this to the prayers of the many, and though some of the prayers come not of the righteous, yet they all come before the Holy One, blessed be He, and He does not regard their sins. 515. Therefore, \"He turned to the prayer of the lonely.\" It means that He turned the prayer and examined every side to find out with what mind it was offered, who is the man who prayed and what his deeds were like. A man therefore should say his prayers in public. Why? Since He \"did not despise their prayer,\" though not all are offered with devotion and a willing heart. 516. Another explanation for: \"He turned to the prayer of the lonely\": IT SIMPLY MEANS THAT HE ACCEPTS HIS PRAYER, ONLY THAT this is the individual who becomes part of the many, AND THEREFORE HIS PRAYER IS AS A PUBLIC PRAYER. Who is the individual, who is included within the many? He is said to be Ya'akov, who is included within the two sides, RIGHT AND LEFT, AVRAHAM AND YITZCHAK. He called to his sons and prayed for them. What is the prayer which is wholly accepted above? That Yisrael shall not perish in exile. 517. When Ya'akov sent for them, the Shechinah departed from him, as was already explained. Come and see: When Ya'akov called for his sons, Avraham and Yitzchak appeared there with the Shechinah upon them. The Shechinah rejoiced in Ya'akov, that he would be united with the fathers, to become a Chariot together with their souls. 518. When Ya'akov opened the discussion saying: \"Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the latter end of days,\" the latter end being the Shechinah, THE LAST OF THE SFIROT, BY MENTIONING \"THAT WHICH SHALL BEFALL YOU IN THE LATTER END OF DAYS,\" HE MENTIONED THE EXILE. The Shechinah was saddened and departed. Later, his sons brought her back by the unison created by the words they uttered, \"Hear, O Yisrael...\" (Devarim 6:4). Then Ya'akov stayed her and said: 'Blessed be the name of the glory of His sovereignty for evermore.' The Shechinah then settled in her place. "},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" 519. \"And Ya'akov called\": HE ASKS: What call is this? HE REPLIES: This call establishes their place, MALCHUT CALLED PLACE, FOR WHEN HE CALLED THEM HE CONNECTED THEM TO THEIR ROOT; to establish them above IN THEIR ROOT, and below IN THIS WORLD. Come and see, wherever \"calling\" is mentioned, it is always in the same way, as it is written: \"And Moshe called Hoshea son of Nun, Yehoshua\" (Bemidbar 13:6), IN ORDER to secure his place, WHICH IS MALCHUT, where it should be and connect him to it. It also says, \"And he called his name Ya'akov\" (Beresheet 25:26), and \"and called it El, the Elohim of Yisrael\" (Beresheet 33:20), thus establishing this place through the name he gave it, as naming brings securing AND STRENGTHENING. 520. You may ask about the verse: \"And called mightily to Elohim\" (Yonah 3:7), and \"I called from my sorrow unto Hashem\" (Yonah 2:3), WHAT ESTABLISHING IS HERE? HE ANSWERS: Assuredly THE CALLING HERE connects and establishes it above. How so? The arranging of the praises of his Master and all the words of prayer give strength and might to his Master, thus showing that all depends upon Him and not on any other place. Hence, THE CALLING HERE brings endurance. In the same manner \"Ya'akov called to his sons,\" thus wholly establishing them, and also \"Hashem called (Heb. vayikra) to Moshe\" (Vayikra 1:1), THUS establishing him in his place. 521. Rabbi Yitzchak said: Why is the Aleph in the word 'vayikra' small, IF IT IS SUPPOSED TO INDICATE EXISTENCE AND STRENGTH? He said to him: Moshe was established in wholeness THROUGH THE CALLING, but not completely, since he abstained BECAUSE OF THIS from his wife. THEREFORE THE ALEPH IS SMALL. In ancient books, it is said that THE SEPARATION FROM HIS WIFE is a praise to him AND DOES NOT DIMINISH HIM. But we have learned that he separated FROM HIS WIFE AND CLOVE above, when he had to connect both above and below, TO WIT, TO HIS WIFE TOO. Then would he be perfect. THE SEPARATION FROM HIS WIFE IS THEN CONSIDERED AS DIMINISHING, TO WHICH THE SMALL ALEPH ALLUDES. Also, the small Aleph indicates the small place it came from; TO WIT, THE CALLING IS FROM THE SMALL PLACE, MALCHUT, which is great when united above WITH ZEIR ANPIN, THE SECRET OF MOSHE. THEREFORE \"HASHEM CALLED TO MOSHE\" TO MAKE IT GREAT. 522. \"And said\": HE ASKS: THE WORDS \"AND SAID: GATHER YOURSELVES\" MEAN THAT THEY WERE NOT WITH HIM THEN. What means \"and said\"? TO WHOM DID HE THEN ADDRESS THE WORDS? HE ANSWERS: as in the verse \"If you shall say in your heart\" (Devarim 7:17), he whispered them; TO WIT, HE ADDRESSED UPWARDS THE WORDS \"GATHER YOURSELVES,\" AND NOT TO HIS SONS. \"GATHER YOURSELVES\": HE ASKS: IF HE TOLD THE MESSENGERS TO GATHER HIS SONS, he should have said 'Gather' instead of \"Gather yourselves,\" as in \"Gather my pious ones together\" (Tehilim 50:5). HE ANSWERS: It is clear to us that \"Gather\" is from a high place; TO WIT, HE TOLD THEM TO GATHER THEMSELVES TO THEIR SUPERNAL ROOTS WITHIN MALCHUT, SO THAT THEY WOULD BE GATHERED into a complete bond, and union. \"That I may tell you\": HE ASKS: What does it mean? HE REPLIES: It is the secret of Wisdom; TO WIT, \"I MAY TELL YOU\" MEANS THAT HE WILL DRAW UPON THEM THE SECRET OF WISDOM. "},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 523. Rabbi Yosi asked Rabbi Shimon, \"I may tell you,\" \"he may tell\" or \"they may tell\" are all DERIVED FROM \"TELL\" (HEB. HAGADAH), which we learned to be of the secret of Wisdom. Why does this word contain the secret of Wisdom? He said to him: It is because the word is spelled with Gimel and Dalet without division between them, WHICH HINTS AT THE WHOLE UNISON, FOR GIMEL IS THE SECRET OF YESOD AND DALET THE SECRET OF MALCHUT. It is the secret of wisdom that a word is perfected by the secret of the letters GIMEL AND DALET, because they are in THE SECRET OF Wisdom. But Dalet without Gimel brings no perfection, and also Gimel without Dalet, since they are connected to each other with nothing dividing them, and whoever separates them, brings death unto himself. This is the secret of Adam's sin, THE DRAWING OF LIGHT OF MALCHUT FROM ABOVE DOWNWARD AND SEPARATING HER FROM YESOD OF ZEIR ANPIN, AND DALET FROM GIMEL. 524. Therefore, hagadah (telling) is a word which pertains to the secret of Wisdom, and though there may be Yud between Gimel and Dalet, LIKE IN \"VE'AGIDAH (THAT I MAY TELL),\" there is no separation and all is connected into one knot, SINCE YUD ALSO ALLUDES TO YESOD. Therefore, this is surely the meaning of this word. HERE TOO: \"That I may tell you\" is the secret of Wisdom. He wished to reveal the outcome of Yisrael's deeds, NAMELY THE SECRET OF THE END. 525. You may say that he did not reveal what he wanted to reveal. Why then are the words of perfect Ya'akov written in the Torah, SEEING THAT they were belied later and were not perfected? Assuredly they were perfected, he revealed whatever was needful for him to reveal, and he concealed, revealing outwardly and withholding internally. A word of the Torah can never be defective. 526. Everything in the Torah is undisclosed, since the Torah is the perfection of all, perfection above and below, not a word or a letter in the Torah is defective. Ya'akov said whatever he had to say, but he revealed and concealed. From what he wanted to reveal, he did not render defective not one letter. 527. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosi sat one day at the gate of Lod. Rabbi Yosi said to Rabbi Yehuda, We know that Ya'akov blessed his sons from the verse: \"And blessed them\" (Beresheet 49:28), but what are their blessings? He said to him: these are the blessings he blessed them, such as \"Yehuda you are he whom your brethren shall praise,\" \"Dan shall judge his people\" and \"Out of Asher his bread shall be fat\" (Beresheet 49). "},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" 528. But he did not reveal that which he wanted to reveal, for he wanted to reveal the end to them. It has been explained that there is an end of the right and an end of the left. He wanted to tell them of the end OF THE RIGHT, so that they will be kept and be purified from the foreskin OF THE END OF THE LEFT. What he revealed to them pertained to when they came to the Holy Land. But he did not disclose other things openly; they are hidden within the Torah in this portion of Ya'akov and in these blessings. 54. \"Reuven, you are my firstborn\" The discussion first reveals that the title verse indicates that Ya'akov placed Reuven's blessings in the hands of God to hold until Reuven was worthy of them. Rabbi Elazar then comments on the verse, \"Prophesy to the wind,\" revealing that it alludes to the lower and upper awakening of wisdom. Rabbi Shimon then explains why God brings souls into the world knowing that they will one day die. We also learn that when the soul ascends to be attached to Malchut, it becomes perfected and Malchut and Zeir Anpin are united. Finally, we are told that when Ya'akov departed from the world, the Shechinah was in front of his bed. Seeing this, he gathered his sons around her and he blessed his sons. The Relevance of this Passage Sometimes a person performs a positive action, but their previous sins create a black hole of negativity that consumes their rewards. However, the Light that we arouse in life can be entrusted into the hands of The Creator until such time that we cleanse ourselves of our negativity. Then we can receive our recompense. It's interesting to note that the Hebrew word for sin also means \"to give over.\" This passage ensures that our Light is given over to The Creator for safekeeping, as opposed to the dark forces that seek to nourish from it. The power of Ya'akov's blessings, plus the energy of the Shechinah and the uniting of our Lower World with the Upper, takes place when our eyes allow the Light of these mystical verses to shine upon our souls. Other benefits associated with this Light include protection and the removal of darkness from the world and our personal lives. 529. He opened the discussion saying: \"Reuven, you are my firstborn, my might and the beginning of my strength.\" HE ASKS: Why did Ya'akov begin by blessing Reuven. Why not start with Yehuda, who, WHEN THE STANDARDS TRAVEL, is a king and is the first to journey among the camps, AS IT SAYS, \"THESE SHALL FIRST SET FORTH\" (BEMIDBAR 2:9). Moreover, we saw that he did not bless REUVEN and the blessings were removed from him until Moshe prayed for him, as it says, \"Let Reuven live, and not die\" (Devarim 33:6). ACCORDING TO THIS, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO BEGIN WITH YEHUDA AND START WITH A BLESSING. 530. HE ANSWERS: Assuredly he blessed REUVEN, and the blessing arose to its place. This is like the story of a man who had a son. When the time came for him to pass away from the world, the king came to him. He said: Let all my money be in the hands of the king, who will keep it for my son. When the king sees that my son is worthy of it, he will give it to him. Ya'akov also said: \"Reuven, you are my firstborn,\" you are beloved of my heart and bowels, yet your blessings shall be in the hands of the holy King until He shall see you ARE WORTHY OF THEM. THIS IS BECAUSE you followed your anger LIKE WATER, according to the Aramaic translation TO \"UNSTABLE AS WATER.\" 531. \"Reuven, you are my firstborn\": Rabbi Elazar opened the discussion saying: \"Then he said to me, 'Prophesy to the wind (also: 'breath')...'\" (Yechezkel 37:9). How obtuse are people, who neither know nor care for the glory of the King. Though the Torah announces it to them daily, no one lends an ear. This verse is difficult to understand. After saying \"Prophesy to the wind,\" why add: \"Prophecy, son of man, and say to the wind.\" "},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" 532. From this, we learned the secret of Wisdom. There are two commands here, the first is to arouse from below upward, for if they are not wakened FIRST from below, there is no awakening above. Through the lower awakening, there is an upper awakening. THE SECOND COMMAND IS TO AROUSE FROM ABOVE DOWNWARD. \"Prophesy to the wind\" is from below upward, and \"prophecy, son of man, and say to the wind\" is from above downward. 533. For even above, when there is stirring below, the supernal receives from that which is even superior to it, like it is said in the next words, \"Come from the four winds, O wind\" (Yechezkel 37:9). The four winds are south, east, north, west-CHESED, TIFERET, GVURAH, AND MALCHUT. The wind coming from the west, MALCHUT, joins the others, SOUTH, NORTH, EAST, WHICH ARE CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET, as it says \"that the nobles of the people delved\" (Bemidbar 21:18). 534. Spirits and souls issue forth from MALCHUT to receive the impression from the inhabitants of the world; NAMELY TO RECEIVE THEIR SHAPES, THE SHAPE OF THE FIRST THREE SFIROT. \"And breathe UPON THESE SLAIN\" as in the verse: \"And breathed into his nostrils the breath of life\" (Beresheet 2:7). Come and see: MALCHUT receives on one side and gives on another. This is the reason why \"all the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full\" (Kohelet 1:7). It is not full since it receives and gives, takes in and out. 535. Rabbi Elazar asked Rabbi Shimon a question. He said: Since it is known to the Holy One, blessed be He, that people die, why then did he bring souls down into the world? What purpose do they serve? He said to him: Many sages were asked this question by their students. They explained it THOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT. The Holy One, blessed be He, sends souls into the world to declare His glory. Yet He takes them away. Wherefore did they descend? 536. HE ANSWERS: The explanation is as follows: He opened the discussion saying: \"Drink waters out of your own cistern, and flowing streams out of your own well\" (Mishlei 5:15). We have explained that a cistern is a place out of which no water flows, WHILE A WELL FLOWS BY ITSELF. When does water flow BY ITSELF? When the soul is perfected in this world, and ascends to where it is attached, MALCHUT. Then it is completed on all sides, above and below. 537. When the soul ascends, the desire of the female is stirred toward the male, and then the water flows IN MALCHUT from below upward, AND THAT WHICH WAS a cistern becomes a well of flowing water. Then there is a joining in union and desire, for that place, MALCHUT, is perfected by the souls of the righteous, friendship and goodwill are aroused above, AND ZEIR ANPIN AND MALCHUT are joined as one. "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" 538. \"Reuven, you are my firstborn.\" Assuredly so, for he was of the first seed of Ya'akov, WHO HAD NO POLLUTION IN HIS DAYS, whose thoughts were directed to another place, NAMELY RACHEL as we learned. Come and see Reuven and all the twelve tribes were joined with the Shechinah. When Ya'akov saw the Shechinah upon him, he called his sons to be united with her. 539. Come and see: There was never a more complete bed since the universe was created. At the time when Ya'akov wanted to depart from the world, Avraham was on his right, Yitzchak on his left and Ya'akov was lying between them with the Shechinah in front of him. When Ya'akov saw this, he called his sons and placed them around the Shechinah with perfect order. 540. Whence do we know that he arranged them around the Shechinah? From the words \"Gather yourselves,\" THAT IS, GATHER ABOVE AROUND THE SHECHINAH. Then was everything brought to perfection with several supernal Chariots around them. They opened the discussion saying: \"Yours, O Hashem, is the greatness, and the power...\" (I Divrei Hayamim 29:11). Then the sun, NAMELY YA'AKOV WHO IS ZEIR ANPIN, was gathered to the moon, THE NUKVA, and east, ZEIR ANPIN, drew near to the west, THE NUKVA. This is what is meant by the verse: \"He gathered up his feet into the bed\" (Beresheet 49:33), WHICH IS AN INDICATION OF MATING, and the moon shone by him and attained perfection. We therefore learned that surely Ya'akov did not die, BUT MATED WITH THE SHECHINAH. When Ya'akov saw the perfect order, which had never been vouchsafed to any man, he rejoiced and praised the Holy One, blessed be He, and started blessing each of his sons according to what he deserved. 55. \"Out of Asher his bread shall be fat\" Rabbi Yosi and Rabbi Yisa go to visit Rabbi Shimon to discover the meaning of the title verse. We learn that Asher is one of the pillars that support the world. It is the supernal gate of the righteous that, when blessed, gives blessings to the world. The meaning of the title verse, we're told, is that when the two Columns are joined, the bread of poverty is rectified by Asher. The Relevance of this Passage The Light that shines from the supernal gate of the righteous radiates into our lives, helping to remove poverty from the landscape of human civilization, while bringing readers of this passage the blessing of sustenance. 541. Rabbi Yosi and Rabbi Yisa were walking along the road. Rabbi Yisa said: We have surely learned that all of Ya'akov's sons were put in a perfect order, BY BECOMING A CHARIOT TO THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE SUPERNAL SFIROT. They were blessed each according to his worth. What then is the meaning of this verse, \"Out of Asher his bread shall be fat...\"? He said to him: I do not know, for I have not learned it from the holy lamp, WHICH IS RABBI SHIMON. Let us go, you and I, to the holy lamp. When they came before him, they spoke and raised that question. He said to them, Surely this is the secret of Wisdom. "},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" 542. He opened the discussion saying: \"Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode by his bays\" (Shoftim 5:17). HE ASKS: Why did he dwell there? HE ANSWERS: For whoever dwells by the sea shore, YESOD OF MALCHUT CALLED SEA, has access to luxuries of the world, NAMELY MOCHIN FROM EDEN. Here, Asher is the supernal gate of the righteous, YESOD, which, when blessed, pours blessings upon the world. This is the gate which sends blessings to the world, and is called Asher. It is one of the pillars upon which the world is supported. 543. The place called bread of poverty, THE NUKVA WHILE RECEIVING FROM THE LEFT COLUMN ALONE, is rectified by the place ASHER, WHICH BECOMES A CURTAIN TO THE CENTRAL COLUMN, WHICH JOINS THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT COLUMNS. The meaning of, \"Out of Asher his bread shall be fat,\" is that what was previously bread of poverty became once more, AFTER THE TWO COLUMNS WERE JOINED TOGETHER, millet bread, since he poured and gave it blessings and dainties, as shown by the end of the verse, \"and he shall yield royal dainties (lit. 'dainties of the king').\" Who is the king? It is the Congregation of Yisrael, NAMELY MALCHUT, from which THE WORLD is nourished by royal dainties. It is he who gives the king, MALCHUT, all blessings, joy and goodness. He gives MALCHUT, and from her it pours down upon THE LOWER BEINGS. They said; were we to come into the world only to hear this, it would have sufficed. 56. \"Unstable as water, you shall not excel\" Rabbi Chiya interprets the title verse, explaining that it signifies Reuven was blessed. However, the kingship, priesthood, and birthright to which he was entitled were taken from him. This verse also reveals, we learn, that Reuven would dwell outside of the land of Yisrael. We are then told that Reuven is aligned with both Chesed and Gvurah. Rabbi Shimon next tells the rabbis that Reuven's sons are in exile, dispersed among the four corners of the world. One day, we hear, they will wage two wars in the land of Yisrael, and they will try to seize the kingship from the Messiah when he rises up to conquer the nations. The Relevance of this Passage Here we ignite a particular frequency of spiritual energy that helps to hasten the arrival of the Mashiach in a merciful manner, for us personally, and for our neighbors who inhabit our global village. 544. Reuven was Ya'akov's firstborn. Rabbi Chiya said: He was entitled to everything, KINGSHIP, BIRTHRIGHT AND PRIESTHOOD, but it was all taken from him. Kingship was given to Yehuda, the birthright to Yosef and the priesthood to Levi. This is the meaning of the words: \"Unstable as water, you shall not excel (lit. 'leave')\"; NAMELY you shall not be left with them. In saying \"my might and the beginning of my strength,\" he blessed him and remembered him to the Holy One, blessed be He. 545. This is like the favorite of the king. One day when his son went in the city, he said to the king, This is my son, beloved of my soul. The king heard and understood that he was asking of him TO FAVOR his son. Ya'akov said: \"Reuven, you are my firstborn...\" to ask the King TO BE KINDLY TOWARD HIM. "},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" 546. \"Unstable as water, you shall not excel.\" Here he stated his fate, that he would not remain in the land of Yisrael but dwell outside it, NAMELY EAST OF THE JORDAN. Correspondingly, the officer in charge, on the side of the tabernacle above, THE NUKVA, in charge under Michael, IS ALSO REJECTED OUTSIDE THE TABERNACLE. Some say THAT THE TRUSTEE THAT WAS REJECTED FROM THE TABERNACLE ABOVE WAS under Gavriel. AND THOUGH REUVEN IS CHESED, Michael is the first OF THE ANGELS on the side of Chesed, and Gavriel is THE FIRST on the left side, Gvurah, REUVEN IS NEVERTHELESS ALSO OF THE SIDE OF GVURAH, WHICH WE LEARN FROM THE VERSE, \"But Yehuda still rules (also: 'descends') with El\" (Hoshea 12:1), THE DESCENT WHICH INDICATES THAT HE IS OF the side of Gvurah and called court of justice. Reuven's inheritance was adjacent to his. YEHUDA'S PORTION WAS WEST OF THE JORDAN AND REUVEN'S WAS EAST OF THE JORDAN. THIS SHOWS THAT REUVEN, TOO, IS OF THE SIDE OF GVURAH. And though kingship (Malchut), THE SECRET OF LOWER GVURAH, was taken from Reuven and belongs to Yehuda, HE IS NEVERTHELESS NOT WHOLLY CLEANSED OF GVURAH, SINCE THE INHERITANCE OF Reuven is adjacent to his, WHICH IS AN INDICATION OF GVURAH. 547. Rabbi Shimon said: Reuven's sons will in the future wage two wars in the land of Yisrael. Come and behold: it is written \"my might,\" namely, the exile in Egypt; \"and the beginning of my strength,\" NAMELY they were the first among the brothers to fight. \"The excellency of dignity\" is the exile of Assyria (Ashur), where the sons of Gad and Reuven were the first to go down and suffered much torture, and did not return FROM THERE until now. 548. \"And the excellency of power\" refers to the time when Mashiach will rise in the world and they will go forth and make war in the world and win, and conquer the nations. The inhabitants of the world will fear them and tremble before them. THE SONS OF REUVEN will plan to seize the kingship yet shall not retain it, hence the words: \"Unstable as water, you shall not excel.\" Why will they not retain mastery even in one place in the world? Because \"you went up to your father's bed,\" for they are going to wage war within the Holy Land. \"Your father's bed\" is Jerusalem. THEY WILL STRIVE TO TAKE IT FROM MASHIACH. 549. Come and see the sons of Reuven dispersed into exile in the four corners of the world, in correspondence with all of Yisrael, who were exiled four times into the four corners of the world. Hence it says, \"My might,\" which is the first exile; \"and the beginning of my strength,\" the second; \"the excellency of dignity\" the third and \"the excellency of power\" the fourth. Likewise, they will wage war in the four corners of the world, thus ruling over everything. They will conquer many peoples and rule over them. "},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" 550. \"Unstable as water, you shall not excel; because you went up to your father's bed.\" Here is an allusion to the first thought Ya'akov had when issuing the first seed, which was about Rachel. Were the thought combined with the first seed in its place, LEAH, Reuven would retain all, THE KINGSHIP, THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE BIRTHRIGHT, but \"unstable as water, you shall not excel; because you went up to your father's bed\" namely you came up through other thoughts, and \"then you did defile it...\" 551. Another explanation for \"unstable as water, you shall not excel\": When the sons of Reuven will wage war in the world and conquer many nations, they will not remain rulers. HENCE IT IS WRITTEN, \"YOU SHALL NOT EXCEL.\" What is the reason for this? \"Because you went up to your father's bed (lit. 'beds'),\" as they are destined to wage war in the Holy Land, precisely mentioned in the words \"your father's bed,\" which refer to Jerusalem. HE ASKS: WHY DOES SCRIPTURE SAY \"beds,\" instead of 'bed'? HE ANSWERS: \"Your father\" is Yisrael Saba, NAMELY ZEIR ANPIN, AND THEREFORE IT SAYS \"beds\" instead of 'bed', since Jerusalem was twice destroyed, and WILL BE BUILT a third time at the time of Mashiach. Hence the plural. Here, the blessing is revealed IN THE VERSE: \"YOU ARE MY FIRSTBORN, MY MIGHT AND THE BEGINNING OF MY STRENGTH.\" And also what happened at that time THAT THE BIRTHRIGHT, KINGSHIP AND PRIESTHOOD WERE TAKEN FROM HIM, AS SAID \"UNSTABLE AS WATER, YOU SHALL NOT EXCEL,\" that which will be when Yisrael shall come to the land of Yisrael, THAT HE WILL HAVE NO PORTION IN IT BUT ACROSS THE JORDAN. And Reuven's deeds at the time of Mashiach, NAMELY THAT HE WILL WAGE WARS AGAINST MANY PEOPLES AND IN JERUSALEM. 57. \"Shimon and Levi are brothers\" Rabbi Yitzchak explains to Rabbi Yosi that Shimon was not worthy of a blessing and that Levi came from the side of strict judgment. After explaining the meaning of the verse, \"So is the great and wide sea\", Rabbi Yehuda reveals that Shimon and Levi were not blessed by their father, but rather were delivered to Moshe to receive blessings. Rabbi Shimon then explains the reason for this. We learn that Ya'akov wished to bless Shimon and Levi when he was about to depart from the world; however, he did not because of the Shechinah, who stood over him. Knowing that to bless them would render the Shechinah defective, he decided to deliver them to Moshe, the master of the house. Ya'akov knew that he would be able to bless Shimon and Levi without damaging the Shechinah. Rabbi Chiya concludes the passage by explaining that because they were both of strict judgment, Shimon and Levi were divided and dispersed so that all of Yisrael received from their strict judgment. The Relevance of this Passage Strict judgement is removed from our midst through the power of Moshe, even though we and the rest of world may not be worthy of such cleansing. In addition, the Light of the Shechinah showers us with protection upon the merit of Moshe. 552. \"Shimon and Levi are brothers.\" Rabbi Yitzchak said: Here he attached them to the left side of the Shechinah, for he saw they have acted with strict judgment, which the world cannot endure. Rabbi Yosi asked, Where is their blessing? Rabbi Yitzchak said: Shimon was not worthy of it, for he saw in him many evil deeds. Levi came from the side of strict judgment, from which blessing does not stem. Even Moshe did not attach his blessing to him, as said: \"Bless, Hashem, his substance, and accept the work of his hands\" (Devarim 33:11), so that his blessing came from the Holy One, blessed be He. "},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" 553. Come and see it is written: \"So is the great and wide sea, wherein are creeping things innumerable, both small and great beasts\" (Tehilim 104:25). The great sea is the Shechinah, which stood over Ya'akov when he wished to depart from the world. It is wide, for all the world is filled and made whole, and contracted within THE SHECHINAH, SINCE SHE WAS FILLED AND MADE WHOLE BY THE SOUTH AND CONTRACTED BY THE NORTH. \"Wherein are creeping things innumerable,\" since there are many supernal and holy angels there. The \"small and great beasts\" are the twelve tribes, Ya'akov's sons, who are found there in wholeness. There is a hind, NAFTALI; a wolf, BINYAMIN; a lion, YEHUDA; and a lamb, YOSEF, AS SAID \"THAT LEADS YOSEF LIKE FLOCK\" (TEHILIM 80:2). Rabbi Yitzchak said: A lion and a lamb, a wolf and a kid (Heb. gedi), NAMELY GAD, and so on, there are small beasts with great ones. 554. Rabbi Yehuda said: It was well said about all THE TRIBES, THAT THERE ARE GREAT AND SMALL BEASTS, but Yehuda is a lion and Shimon an ox, AS SHIMON IS OF GVURAH, WHICH IS THE FACE OF AN OX. The friends have explained that they were facing each other, YEHUDA on the right and SHIMON on the left. THIS IS LIKE A MAN WHO HAD a vicious ox. He said: I shall paint the figure of a lion in his stall, and it will see it and fear it. Thus Shimon is an ox and Yehuda a lion, AS SHIMON THE OX, NAMELY GVURAH, IS SUBDUED THROUGH LOOKING AT YEHUDA THE LION, WHICH IS CHESED. 555. Shimon did not receive any blessing FROM YA'AKOV, but Moshe attached him to Yehuda, as it is written: \"Hear (Heb. sh'ma), Hashem, the voice of Yehuda\" (Devarim 33:7) and elsewhere \"because Hashem has heard (Heb. shama) that I was hated\" (Beresheet 29:33). THEREFORE, SHE NAMED HIM SHIMON. THERE IS AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE VERSES. AS THERE IS HEARING IN THE NAME OF SHIMON, SO THE HEARING IN REALATION TO YEHUDA INCLUDES SHIMON. Rabbi Yehuda said: Shimon and Levi WERE NOT BLESSED BY their father SINCE HE brought them to Moshe TO BLESS THEM. Rabbi Yosi said to him: Wherefore DID their father NOT BLESS THEM BUT delivered them to Moshe? Rabbi Yehuda said to him: We too shall bring THE QUESTION before the holy lamp, RABBI SHIMON. 556. They came and asked Rabbi Shimon. He said: How sweet are the words. He clapped his hands and wept. He said: Who will uncover you, holy faithful, NAMELY MOSHE. In your lifetime you were raised above men, and in your death you were elevated and your image covered. The keys of your Master were always delivered to your hands. "},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 557. Come and see: Ya'akov had four wives. He begot children by them all, and was perfected through his wives. When Ya'akov wished to depart FROM THE WORLD, the Shechinah stood over him. He wanted to bless SHIMON AND LEVI but could not, since he feared the Shechinah. He said to himself, How can I do this, seeing that both of them come from the side of strict judgment, AND TO BLESS THEM WILL RENDER THE SHECHINAH DEFECTIVE. I cannot force the Shechinah, since I had four wives WHO WERE DRAWN FROM THE FOUR ASPECTS, CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, AND MALCHUT OF THE SHECHINAH, AND I WAS PERFECTED THROUGH THEM, SINCE THEY BORE ME TWELVE TRIBES, THE SECRET OF ALL PERFECTION. SINCE I RECEIVED MY PERFECTION FROM THE SHECHINAH, HOW CAN I BLESS SHIMON AND LEVI AGAINST HER WISH? I shall deliver them to the landlord of the house, MOSHE, THE HUSBAND OF THE MATRON, who is the owner, and he shall do as he pleases. 558. Ya'akov said: I have received my portion of wives and children in this world FROM THE SHECHINAH, and became perfected. How can I force the Matron, THE SHECHINAH? I shall deliver the matter to the master of the Matron, MOSHE, who will do as he pleases without fear. 559. Come and see it is written, \"And this is the blessing, with which Moshe the man of the Elohim blessed\" (Devarim 33:1), which means master of the house, master of the Matron, SINCE MAN MEANS MASTER, as it is written: \"Her husband (man) may let it stand, or her husband may make it void\" (Bemidbar 30:14) and \"Moshe had finished (Heb. kalot),\" FOR THE SHECHINAH IS CALLED 'MOSHE'S BRIDE (HEB. KALAT)'. Therefore, Moshe may bless whomever he pleases, without fear OF DAMAGING THE SHECHINAH, SINCE HE CAN FIX HER ACCORDING TO HIS WISHES, as has been explained. Therefore Ya'akov said: I see that these sons of mine are from the side of strict judgment, let the master of the house come and bless them. 560. Assuredly Moshe was a man of Elohim, and did as he pleased in his house, as it says, \"Her husband may let it stand\" BY GIVING HER MOCHIN OF CHOCHMAH CALLED RISING UP, in accordance with the verse, \"Moshe said: Rise up, Hashem, and let your enemies be scattered\" (Bemidbar 10:35). BECAUSE ON THE WAY, THERE IS FOOTHOLD TO THE KLIPOT AND THE MOCHIN OF CHOCHMAH SCATTER THE KLIPOT. \"Or her husband may make it void,\" which agrees with the words \"And when it rested, he said: 'Return, Hashem'\" (Ibid. 35), FOR WHEN THE SHECHINAH IS AT REST, THE KLIPOT CANNOT HOLD HER AND THERE IS NO FEAR. THEREFORE, \"HER HUSBAND MAY MAKE IT VOID.\" BY STRENGTH OF THE CENTRAL COLUMN, HE MAKES VOID THE FIRST THREE SFIROT OF CHOCHMAH IN ORDER TO CLOTHE HER WITH CHASSADIM, THE SECRET OF THE VERSE \"AND WHEN IT RESTED, HE SAID: 'RETURN, HASHEM.'\" Assuredly the master of the house does as he pleases and no one may protest, as a man who has decided for his wife and she does his bidding. Therefore, Ya'akov, though he was attached to The Tree of Life, ZEIR ANPIN, was not the master of the house LIKE MOSHE for he was attached below and Moshe above. Ya'akov therefore delivered them to the landlord TO BE BLESSED BY HIM. "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 561. \"Let my soul not come into their council\" (Beresheet 49:6). Rabbi Aba opened the discussion saying: \"The counsel of Hashem is for them that fear Him\" (Tehilim 25:14). It is the supernal mystery of the Torah that the Holy One, blessed be He, gives only to those who fear sin. Whoever fears sin, the supernal secret of the Torah is revealed to him, the sign of the holy covenant called the secret of Hashem. 562. Shimon and Levi took pains on account of that secret OF THE HOLY COVENANT, that the people of Shchem will circumcise themselves and accept that secret upon them; TO WIT, TO PRESERVE THE SIGN OF THE HOLY COVENANT. But the scripture bears testimony that it was done with guile. Also Zimri, son of Salu, WHO WAS A CHIEF OF A FAMILY OF THE TRIBE OF SHIMON, defiled that secret WITH KOZBI, THE DAUGHTER OF TZUR. IN RELATION TO THIS, Ya'akov said: \"Let my soul not come into their council (lit. 'secret')\" (Beresheet 49:6). What soul is this? The soul which rises up to be united with the supernal covenant above, NAMELY MALCHUT WHICH IS UNITED WITH THE SUPERNAL COVENANT, YESOD OF ZEIR ANPIN, called the soul of the bundle of life. 563. \"To their assembly let my honor not be united.\" This has been explained to refer to the words, \"And Korach gathered all the congregation\" (Bemidbar 16:19), FOR YA'AKOV'S NAME IS NOT MENTIONED, ONLY \"KORACH, THE SON OF YITZHAR, THE SON OF KEHAT,\" AND NOT \"THE SON OF YA'AKOV.\" \"Let my honor not be united,\" the honor of Yisrael. Therefore, DUE TO THESE DEEDS, their father did not bless them but delivered them to Moshe. Rabbi Chiya said: From these verses, we understand that they were not joined together, BUT SCATTERED, AS IT SAYS \"I WILL DIVIDE THEM IN YA'AKOV, AND SCATTER THEM IN YISRAEL\" (BERESHEET 49:7), as should be, FOR THEY NEED SCATTERING DUE TO THEIR BEING OF STRICT JUDGMENT. Therefore there is everything in it, SINCE THEIR STRICT JUDGMENT PERVADES THROUGHOUT YISRAEL, FOR BY SCATTERING THEM IN YISRAEL, YISRAEL RECEIVED FROM THEIR STRICT JUDGMENT. There is no generation in the world, upon which their Judgment has not descended to bring accusation on the world, which causes beggars to multiply. Thus, all OF YISRAEL WERE HURT BY THEIR JUDGMENT. 58. The nations by the sun and Yisrael by the moon Here we find a discourse on the moon. The Yisraelites use the cycles of the moon to calculate seasons, holidays, and years. In contrast, the nations of the world use the cycles of the sun, which, we're told, comprise an inferior system. The Relevance of this Passage Like the moon, mankind has no Light of its own. As the moon derives its light from the sun, mankind and this entire earthly realm draw spiritual Light from the Upper World domain known as Zeir Anpin. This passage helps us rise above any negative celestial influences that appear throughout the lunar/solar calendar year, connecting us only to the positive energy that the moon and sun release into the cosmos. 564. \"Yehuda you are he whom your brethren shall praise: your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies\" (Beresheet 49:8). Rabbi Yosi opened the discussion saying: \"He made the moon for seasons\" (Tehilim 104:19). \"He made the moon\" with which to sanctify the first day of months and new years. The moon never shines but from the sun. When the sun reigns, the moon does not; when the sun is gathered, the moon rules. The moon is of no account, save when the sun is gathered. "},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 565. The Holy One, blessed be He, made both so that they will shine, as it is written in the verse, \"And Elohim set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth\" (Beresheet 1:17), to \"let them be for signs,\" Shabbat CALLED SIGNS, as in \"It is a sign\" (Shemot 31:17). \"And for seasons,\" the holidays; \"and for days,\" the days of the beginning of the month; \"and years\" (Beresheet 1:14), are new year days. The nations in the world reckon by the sun and Yisrael by the moon. 566. This accords with Rabbi Elazar's discourse upon the verse: \"You have multiplied the nation, and increased its joy\" (Yeshayah 9:2). The \"nation\" is Yisrael, of whom it says, \"For what nation is there so great\" (Devarim 4:7) and \"a single nation on the earth\" (I Divrei Hayamim 17:21). \"Its\" means 'for it', \"increased its joy\" of the moon, which light grew for Yisrael's sake. The nations of the world RECKON TIMES BY THE CYCLE OF the sun and Yisrael BY THE CYCLE OF the moon. HE ASKS: Which one is superior, THE RECKONING BY THE SUN OR BY THE MOON? HE REPLIES: Surely the moon is above, and the sun of the peoples of the world is underneath this moon. That sun RECEIVES LIGHT from the moon and illuminates. See the difference between Yisrael and THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD: The children of Yisrael are attached to the moon and linked to the Supernal Sun. They are united with the place which shines by the Supernal Sun and cleave to it, as it is written: \"But you that did cleave unto Hashem your Elohim are alive every one of you this day\" (Devarim 4:4). 59. \"Yehuda you are he whom your brethren shall praise\" Rabbi Shimon explains that the kingship was given to Yehuda, since he is the fourth leg of the supernal Throne and the Chariot to the attribute of Malchut. Rabbi Shimon proceeds by discussing the meaning of the verse, \"The King's daughter is all glorious within.\" This, we learn, signifies that the Female Principle within Atzilut is clothed by and joined with Gvurah. The discourse then turns to address the verse, \"So He drove out the man\" This refers to Adam, who by his sin, brought death upon himself and the entire world, and drove the Female Principle out of the Garden of Eden. We learn that fiery flames guard the way to the Tree of Life, the Female Principle, which rests on the angels Matatron and Sandalfon. We also learn that after she was driven out, the Female Principle was flawed until she was rectified--first by Noah, and then by Avraham. She stood in wholeness by Avraham and his sons, and Yehuda cleaved to her and became stronger in his kingship because of this. Indeed, the verse, \"The sons of your father shall bow down before you,\" signifies that all the tribes shall bow down to Yehuda. We also learn that Yehuda, referred to as a \"lion,\" escaped the Angel of Death. The mighty Shechinah is also compared to a lion and a lioness because of her strength and because she crouches to await her prey, the idolatrous nations. Finally, we are told that the verse, \"The staff shall not depart from Yehuda,\" indicates that the Shechinah shall rise up in exile. The Relevance of this Passage An abundance of Light radiates throughout this complex passage of Zohar. This Light helps correct the original sin of Adam, which in turn, assists in weakening the grip of the Angel of Death over mankind. Our souls are strengthened by the Light of Noach, Avraham, and Yehuda, which helps us correct our owns transgressions and cleanse us of negativity, which also helps correct the original sin of Adam. 567. \"Yehuda, you are...\": Rabbi Shimon said: The kingship was assigned to Yehuda, as we said in relation to the words, \"Now will I praise Hashem\" (Beresheet 29:35), because he was the fourth. \"I will praise Hashem,\" since he is the fourth leg of the throne. Yud-Hei- Vav, WHICH ARE CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET, are the impress of the supernal name ZEIR ANPIN, which is completed by Hei, MALCHUT, the last Hei of the Holy Name, THROUGH WHICH the Holy Name is made whole with its letters. AND IT IS the knot which binds THE LETTERS OF THE HOLY NAME. Therefore \"your brethren shall praise\" you, for thanks to you the kingship, Malchut, is able to exist, YOU BEING THE CHARIOT TO THE ATTRIBUTE OF MALCHUT. It is written, \"Yehuda still rules with El, and is faithful with Holy Ones\" (Hoshea 12:1). HE ASKS: Who are these Holy Ones? AND ANSWERS, They are the supernal Holy Ones, THE HOLY SFIROT CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET, who all acknowledged him and made him faithful, TO WIT, BY GIVING HIM ALL THAT IS IN THEM. He is therefore first in everything and king over all. "},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 568. Rabbi Shimon opened the discussion saying: \"The king's daughter is all glorious (Heb. kevudah) within\" (Tehilim 45:14). \"Kevudah\" refers to the Congregation of Yisrael, NAMELY THE NUKVA, CALLED 'KEVUDAH', because He, ZEIR ANPIN, IS CALLED 'kavod' (glory); the one upon the other, AS BOTH ARE ONE; the one, ZEIR ANPIN, a male, IS CALLED 'KAVOD,' and the other, MALCHUT, a female, is called 'kevudah,' WITH THE ADDITIONAL HEI OF THE FEMININE. The king's daughter is Bat-Sheva (lit. 'daughter of seven'), WHICH IS THE NUKVA, AND ALSO an echo (lit. 'a voice's daughter'), while he is called a great voice, being the supernal King, ZEIR ANPIN, WHILE THE NUKVA IS CALLED THE DAUGHTER OF A VOICE. It is \"within\" as there is a king, NAMELY MALCHUT, which is not as far within as him, FOR SOMETIMES MALCHUT IS CLOTHED IN BRIYAH, while the king's daughter is all glorious within IN ATZILUT. 569. \"Her clothing is inwrought with gold,\" since she is clothed and joined by the supernal Gvurah, NAMELY THE LEFT SIDE OF IMA, WHO IS CALLED GOLD, ACCORDING TO THE SECRET OF THE VERSE, \"GOLD COMES OUT OF THE NORTH\" (IYOV 37:22). IMA is also called a king, and on her account the land endures, WHICH IS MALCHUT. When is MALCHUT established? When coupled with justice, WHICH IS ZEIR ANPIN, as it says, \"The king by justice establishes the land\" (Mishlei 29:4), WHICH IS MALCHUT. We call it the kingdom of heaven. Yehuda was united with it, and he therefore inherited the kingdom on earth. 570. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yitzchak were walking along the way. Rabbi Yitzchak said: Let us discourse on the words of the Torah as we go. Rabbi Yitzchak opened the discussion saying: \"So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the Garden of Eden...\" (Beresheet 3:24). This verse has been expounded upon by the friends. Yet \"He drove\" has the same meaning of a man divorcing his wife, TO WIT, THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE, DIVORCING THE NUKVA. \"The man\" is correct, AS THE NUKVA IS CALLED ET (THE). 571. Come and see the secret meaning of this matter. Adam was caught for his sin and brought death upon himself and upon the world, and caused the tree, by which he sinned, NAMELY THE NUKVA, to be driven on his account, and be driven because of his descendants' SINS forever. Hence it says, \"So He drove out the man,\" Et (the) having a precise meaning, such as in, \"I saw (et) Hashem\" (Yeshayah 6:1), WHICH MEANS THE NUKVA. Here too, \"the man\" REFERS TO THE NUKVA. "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" 572. \"And He placed at the east of the Garden of Eden,\" This is below ATZILUT. As there are Cherubs above IN ATZILUT, A MALE AND A FEMALE, so there are Cherubs below ATZILUT, THE ANGELS MATATRON AND SANDALFON. The tree, WHICH IS THE NUKVA CALLED THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE, rests upon them, and \"the bright blade of a revolving sword\" is the shapes of fiery flames come out from the brightness of the sword, WHICH GUARD THE WAY TO THE TREE OF LIFE, NOT THE BRIGHT BLADE OF THE SWORD ITSELF. \"Revolving\" refers to the sword, which sucks from the two sides, RIGHT AND LEFT, and revoles now to this side now to the other. According to another explanation, \"revolving\" alludes to the shapes of the fiery flames which are revolving, like we said. They revolve and change forms, now to men, now to women. They revolve in their places and change forms, in order to guard the way to The Tree of Life. What is a way? As in \"who makes a way in the sea\" (Yeshayah 43:16), IT REFERS TO YESOD OF THE NUKVA. 573. Rabbi Yehuda said: Well said, and assuredly correct. Adam caused that tree, in regard to which he sinned, WHICH IS THE NUKVA, to be driven out. So did other men, WHICH CAUSE IT TO BE DRIVEN OUT THROUGH THEIR SINS, as said in the verse, \"And for your transgressions was your mother put away\" (Yeshayah 50:1). And yet it is true to say that it refers to himself, as it is written, \"the man,\" ET (THE) BEING THE NUKVA, man's perfection. BY DRIVING HER OUT, HE LOST HIS WHOLENESS. 574. From the day SHE WAS DRIVEN OUT, the moon, THE NUKVA, became flawed, until Noah entered the ark. Then came evil men, and she was flawed again, until Avraham came AND RECTIFIED HER. She stood in wholeness by Ya'akov and his sons, and Yehuda came, held on to her and became stronger through the kingship, and inherited it for ever, for him and his sons after him. Hence the verse: \"Yehuda you are whom your brethren shall praise.\" Indeed, when Yisrael stood by the sea AND THE TRIBE OF YEHUDA WERE THE FIRST TO ENTER IT they all praised him and went into the sea after him. 575. \"Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies\" as it says, \"Yehuda shall go up\" (Shoftim 1:2) TO WAR. \"The sons of your father shall bow down before you\" includes all the tribes, and hence the words: \"The sons of your father\" instead of 'your mother' as the sons of your father are the other tribes. And though the children of Yisrael were divided into two kingdoms, yet when they went up to Jerusalem, they would kneel and bow to the king in Jerusalem, since the kingdom of Jerusalem WHICH DREW from the holy kingdom, THE NUKVA, was from YEHUDA. 576. \"Shall bow down before you\": It does not say, 'And shall bow', which would include other nations, AND MEAN THAT ALL THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD WILL BOW DOWN TO HIM. It does not say 'And shall bow' save at the time of Mashiach, WHEN it is written: \"Princes also shall prostrate themselves\" (Yeshayah 49:7). For now, he ONLY said \"shall bow\" to show that Yisrael alone shall bow down to the exilarch in Babylon, and no other nation. "},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" 577. \"Yehuda is a lion's whelp\" First he was a whelp and then a lion. HENCE THE REPETITION: A WHELP AND A LION. The secret of the matter is that first, WHEN ZEIR ANPIN IS IN MOCHIN OF SMALLNESS, IT IS CALLED a youth, and later, WHEN IN MOCHIN OF GREATNESS, IT IS CALLED a man, AS IT IS WRITTEN: \"Hashem is a man of war\" (Shemot 15:3). YEHUDA TOO, WHEN IN MOCHIN OF SMALLNESS, IS CALLED A WHELP, AND WHEN IN MOCHIN OF GREATNESS, HE IS CALLED A LION. \"From the prey, my son, you are gone up.\" HE ASKS: What prey is this? It includes the Angel of Death, who stands by its prey to exterminate the world, and none can save from it, as in \"and tears in pieces, and none can deliver\" (Michah 5:7). From that prey, the Shechinah was gone up. THE WORDS: \"FROM THE PREY, MY SON, YOU ARE GONE UP\" MEAN THAT YEHUDA ESCAPED THE ANGEL OF DEATH, WHICH IS THE SATAN, THE EVIL INCLINATION, INSTEAD OF STUMBLING BY IT. 578. \"He stooped down\" in the exile in Babylon \"and he couched\" in the exile of Edom \"as a lion\" which is mighty \"and as a lioness\" which is mightier than a lion. So are the children of Yisrael mighty, for though the idolatrous people of the world entice and oppress them, they adhere to their laws and customs like a lion and a lioness. 579. The Shechinah also is as strong as a lion and a lioness when she thus falls, though it is written, \"The virgin of Yisrael is fallen; she shall no more rise\" (Amos 5:2). As a lion and a lioness only crouch to hunt their prey, and when they smell it from afar they fall; TO WIT, THEY CROUCH ON THE GROUND TO PREPARE TO JUMP ON THE PREY and do not rise until they jump upon it and eat it. The Shechinah also does not fall but as a lion and a lioness, in order to revenge the idolatrous nations, leap upon them, as it says \"striding in the greatness of his strength\" (Yeshayah 63:1). 580. \"Who shall rouse him up?\" (Beresheet 49:9). He shall not rise to take petty vengeance upon them, but who shall rouse him, 'who' being, as in the verse \"who can heal you\" (Eichah 2:13). It is the supernal world, NAMELY BINAH CALLED WHO, which has dominion over all. It is written \"out of whose womb (Lit. 'the womb of who') came the ice?\" (Iyov 38:29), which has been explained THAT THROUGH THE JUDGMENT CALLED ICE, IT SUBDUES ALL THE KLIPOT. 581. \"The staff shall not depart from Yehuda\" has been explained by the friends, but \"until Shilo come\" is spelled with Hei, while in other PLACES IT IS SPELLED SHILO with Vav. This is an indication of the secret of the Holy Name Yud-Hei, for in other places it is spelled Shilo without Hei, or without Yud. Here it is spelled Shiloh with both Yud and Hei, which is the secret of the supernal Holy Name, and means that the Shechinah shall rise FROM HER FALL IN THE EXILE through this name of Yud-Hei, which, as we said, is the mystery of 'who', FOR YAH IS THE NAME OF BINAH, ALSO NAMED 'WHO'. 60. \"Binding his foal to the vine,\" part one Here we learn that God protects and preserves the deserving in this world and in the next. The soul of he who does not have merit, however, will be dragged to Gehenom by legions of demons. This soul is then delivered to the angel Dumah, who takes it to be locked behind the seven gates of fire. "},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" Every Shabbat, the souls in Gehenom are allowed to go to the outer gates, where they meet with other souls that convene there but do not enter Gehenom. It is said that the evil are sentenced to the heat of the burning fire and then the intense cold of snow. Though they first feel relief when they enter the snow, they soon moan again, realizing they are still in Gehenom. The rabbis then explain that the title verse signifies the children of Yisrael and the Messiah are destined to conquer the idolatrous nations. The Mashiach is called \"poor', we're told, because He is drawn from the moon, Malchut, who has no illumination of her own. Proceeding on from this, the discussion turns to the subject of dreams and prophecy. Dreams are of a much lower grade than prophecy and are accessible to all, even the wicked. We learn that Yosef was able to correctly interpret his dream about the Pharaoh's cup of poison. Indeed, we are told that through the power of the vine, the Female Principle, the heathen nations were subjugated and their force subdued. The discourse then remarks upon the double precepts practiced by the Yisraelites so that they may avoid being sent to Gehenom of snow. Following an explanation of the verse, \"She is not afraid of the snow of her household\", the section concludes when the rabbis meet a young boy who travels without his former companion. The Relevance of this Passage The cleansing power of this passage purifies our souls, helping us merit a place in the world to come without having to pass through the gates of Gehenom. The arrival of the Messiah is also quickened, and readers who peruse these verses with a pure heart, help to ensure that the appearance of the Mashiach happens in a manner that is merciful for all mankind. In addition, we gain the ability to utilize our sleep and dream states in a fashion that will facilitate our spiritual development. 582. \"Binding his foal to the vine, and his ass's colt to the choice vine\": Rabbi Chiya opened the discussion saying: \"Hashem shall preserve you from all evil: He shall preserve your soul\" (Tehilim 121:7). HE ASKS: After saying: \"Hashem shall preserve you from all evil,\" why add \"He shall preserve your soul\"? HE ANSWERS: \"Hashem shall preserve you from all evil\" in this world and \"shall preserve your soul\" in the world of Truth. 583. By the keeping in this world is meant that a man is protected from evil accusing demons, which go in the world to bring charges against people and cling to them. By the keeping in the world of Truth is meant that when a man passes away from this world, if he be meritorious, his soul ascends to be adorned in its place. But it he is not MERITORIOUS, several legions of demons appear before him and drag him into Gehenom, where he is delivered to the hands of Dumah, who hands him to the chief in charge over Gehenom. There are 13,000 chieftains with him, who all await the souls of the wicked. 584. Come and see: There are seven chambers in Gehenom, and seven gates. The soul of the wicked enters THERE. There are several fiends, spirits and gate keepers, and one chief in charge over each gate. The souls of the wicked are delivered to these chiefs by Dumah. Once they are delivered, THEY close the gates of burning fire. 585. There are double gates, which are opened and closed, the outer ones are open and the inner closed. Every Shabbat all of them are open. The wicked go out as far as the outer gates, where they meet other souls, which tarry there, BUT DO NOT ENTER GEHENOM. When Shabbat goes out, the herald comes out to each gate and said \"The wicked shall return to Sh'ol\" (Tehilim 9:18). Come and behold: the souls of the righteous are protected by the Holy One, blessed be He, from being delivered into the hands of the chieftain Dumah, as it is written: \"Hashem shall preserve your going out and your coming in\" (Ibid. 121:8) and \"He shall preserve your soul.\" "},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 586. \"Binding his foal to the vine\": HE ASKS: What is a vine? HE SAYS, It is the Congregation of Yisrael, THE NUKVA, as it says, \"You have brought a vine out of Egypt\" (Tehilim 80:9) and \"Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine\" (Ibid. 128:3). Your wife is as the holy vine, THE SUPERNAL NUKVA. Rabbi Yosi said about the vine over which we say the benediction--'Who created the fruit of the vine (Heb. bore peri hagefen)'--'created' means \"a tree yielding fruit\" (Beresheet 1:12). 'The fruit of the vine' is a fruit tree, 'yielding fruit' is the male, NAMELY ZEIR ANPIN, and the 'fruit tree' is a female, NAMELY THE NUKVA OF ZEIR ANPIN. Therefore, \"who created the fruit of the vine\" includes a male and a female together, ZEIR AND NUKVA. 587. \"Binding his foal to the vine\": This is King Mashiach, who will rule over the nations' armies, and over the hosts in charge upon the idolatrous nations who derive their strength from them. King Mashiach is destined to overpower them. 588. Because the vine, THE NUKVA, rules over the lower crowns, through which the idolatrous nations reign, and is victorious above. The children of Yisrael, who are called \"the choice vine,\" will conquer and annihilate the other legions below, and King Mashiach will overpower all of them. It is written \"poor and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt\" (Zecharyah 9:9). The ass and the colt are two crowns, through which the idolatrous nations rule. They are of the left side, the side of profanity. AND KING MASHIACH OVERCOMES THEM. 589. HE ASKS: Why DOES SCRIPTURE SAY ABOUT KING MASHIACH THAT he is poor? Can King Mashiach be called poor? HE ANSWERS: Rabbi Shimon said it is so, because he has nothing of his own, SINCE IT IS THE NUKVA OF ZEIR ANPIN which is called King Mashiach. But it is the holy moon above, THE NUKVA OF ZEIR ANPIN, which has no light of her own, save what she receives from the sun, ZEIR ANPIN. SHE IS THEREFORE CALLED POOR. 590. King Mashiach , THE NUKVA, will have dominion and will be united in his place above. Then \"behold, your king comes to you\" (Zecharyah 9:9). It does not say what king, SINCE HE INCLUDES THE NUKVA ABOVE AND MASHIACH BELOW. Below he is poor because he is of the aspect of the moon, WHICH IS THE SUPERNAL NUKVA. FOR MASHIACH BELOW IS DRAWN FROM THE NUKVA, AND IS THEREFORE CALLED POOR LIKE HER. Above she is poor, THE NUKVA HERSELF, because she is the mirror which does not shine OF HER OWN, BUT FROM ZEIR ANPIN, AND IS THEREFORE CALLED bread of poverty. With all that, MASHIACH IS \"riding upon an ass, and upon a colt,\" which are the stronghold of the idolatrous nation, to subdue them. The Holy One, blessed be He, THE NUKVA, will be strengthened in His place ABOVE, AS THE VERSE: \"BEHOLD, YOUR KING COMES TO YOU\" INCLUDES THEM BOTH. "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" 591. \"He washes his garments in wine\" is like the verses: \"Who is this that comes from Edom, with crimsoned garments from Botzra?\" (Yeshayah 63:1) and \"I have trodden the winepress alone\" (Ibid. 3). The wine is the side of Gvurah OF ZEIR ANPIN, of strict Judgment upon the idolatrous nations. \"And his clothes in the blood of grapes\" refers to the lower tree, THE NUKVA, the court of law called grapes. The wine is mingled with the blood of grapes in order to be clothed by both THE STRICT JUDGMENT OF ZEIR ANPIN AND THE JUDGMENT OF THE NUKVA, to crush beneath it all the other idolatrous nations and the kings of the world. 592. Rabbi Yosi opened the discussion with the verses, \"Binding his foal to the vine\" and \"And on the vine were three tendrils: and it was as though it budded, and its blossoms shot forth\" (Beresheet 40:10). Come and see how stupid are people who neither know nor care for the glory of their Master, or regard the words of the Torah. They do not know their ways, or what they are caught in, as it is written: \"The way of the wicked is like darkness: they know not at what they stumble\" (Mishlei 4:19). 593. At the earliest time, prophecy rested upon people who would know and look to know the highest glory. When prophecy was stopped from them, they resorted to divine voices. Now both have ceased, and people resort only to dreams. 594. The dream is from the lower grade outside, for we learn that a dream is the sixtieth part of prophecy. Why? Because it comes from the sixth grade below, as was already explained, THAT IT IS FROM HOD OF THE NUKVA, WHICH IS THE SIXTH GRADE FROM NETZACH AND HOD OF ZEIR ANPIN WHERE PROPHECY IS. Come and behold: dream is accessible to all, since it is from the left side, HOD OF THE NUKVA, and descends many grades DOWN TO THE ANGEL GAVRIEL, WHO DELIVERS THE DREAMS. A dream may be seen even by wicked men and even by gentiles. 595. Sometimes evil angels receive and hear the dream, and inform men. Some of them mock at men and tell them false things, and sometimes true things which they heard. Sometimes, they are sent to the evil to tell them lofty matters. 596. It is written of this wicked man that he saw a true dream, as it is written: \"And on the vine were three tendrils.\" What is the vine? It is the Congregation of Yisrael, THE NUKVA, as it is written: \"Look down from heaven, and behold, and be mindful of this vine\" (Tehilim 80:15). It says \"from heaven\" IN \"LOOK DOWN FROM HEAVEN,\" since it has been cast from there, according to the words: \"And cast down from heaven to earth\" (Eichah 2:1). \"And be mindful of this vine,\" NAMELY the vine which is \"this,\" THE NUKVA CALLED THIS. "},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" 597. \"Three tendrils\" as in the verse: \"There were three flocks of sheep lying by it\" (Beresheet 29:2), ARE THE SECRET OF THE THREE COLUMNS. \"And it was as though it budded,\" as it is written: \"And Solomon's Wisdom excelled\" (I Melachim 5:10) means that the moon shone, THE NUKVA CALLED SOLOMON'S WISDOM; \"and its blossoms shot forth\" refers to the lower Jerusalem, THE NUKVA. Another explanation for, \"and its blossoms shot forth\": It refers to the grade above THE NUKVA, which suckles her, NAMELY YESOD, as it says, \"whose seed is in itself, upon the earth\" (Beresheet 1:11), WHICH ALLUDES TO YESOD, THAT POURS UPON THE NUKVA CALLED EARTH. \"And its clusters brought forth ripe grapes,\" in which to keep the preserved wine, SO THAT THE KLIPOT WILL NEVER HAVE A HOLD ON IT. 598. See how much this wicked man saw. It is written: \"And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them\" (Beresheet 40:11). He saw here the cup of poison, the sucking of the court of justice, which issues from these grapes. It was given to Pharaoh, who drank it, as it came to pass AT THE TIME OF THE EXODUS FROM EGYPT, on account of Yisrael. When Yosef heard this, he rejoiced and recognized the truth in that dream. Hence, he interpreted his dream for the good, for bringing him good tidings. 599. Come and see: \"Binding his foal to the vine\" since strong forces of the heathen nations were subjugated underneath this vine, as we said that through the power of the vine, THE NUKVA, their force was bound up and subdued, as has been explained. 600. Rabbi Shimon said: There is a vine and there is a vine. There is a holy supernal vine, THE NUKVA, and there is a vine called \"the vine of Sdom\" (Devarim 32:32), WHICH IS AN EVIL KLIPAH. There is also \"a strange vine\" (Yirmeyah 2:21), the daughter of a strange El. Therefore, it is written \"this vine,\" WHICH HINTS THAT SHE IS THE NUKVA CALLED this, the same that is called \"an entirely right seed\" (Ibid.) \"a noble vine,\" AS IT SAYS, \"AND I HAD PLANTED YOU A NOBLE VINE\" (IBID.), refers to the children of Yisrael who issued from this vine. When Yisrael sinned and abandoned this vine, it says, \"For their vine is of the vine of Sdom\" (Devarim 32:32). 601. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yitzchak were walking along the road. Rabbi Yehuda said to Rabbi Yitzchak, Let us walk through this field, which is more level. While they were walking, Rabbi Yehuda said: It is written, \"She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet\" (Mishlei 31:21). This verse has been explained by our friend Rabbi Chizkiyah. He said that the evil are sentenced to twelve months in Gehenom, half of them in heat OF BURNING FIRE and half in snow. "},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 602. When they enter the fire, they say, This must be Gehenom. When they go into the snow, they say, This is surely the intense cold of the Holy One's, blessed be He, winter. They start with, 'Hurrah', AND REJOICE FOR COMING OUT OF GEHENOM, but later, WHEN THEY UNDERSTAND IT IS A GEHENOM OF SNOW, they say, 'Woe'. David said: \"He brought me up also out of the gruesome pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet...\" (Tehilim 40:3); NAMELY from where they first say 'Hurrah' and then 'Woe', AS THE WORD HAYAVEN (MIRE) CONTAINS BOTH VAV-HEI (HURRAH) AND VAV-YUD (WOE). 603. Where are their souls perfected? In A GEHENOM OF snow, as said: \"When the Almighty scatters kings in it, snow falls in Tzalmon\" (Tehilim 68:15). One might think this also applies to Yisrael, THAT THEY ARE SENTENCED TO SNOW. Of this, the verse says, \"She is not afraid of the snow for her household\" Why? \"For all her household are clothed with scarlet.\" The word shanim (scarlet) may also be pronounced 'two (Heb. shnayim)'; to wit, the circumcision and uncovering, the Tzitzit (fringes) and the Tefilin, the Mezuzah and the Chanukah candle, and so on. TO WIT, YISRAEL ARE QUICK IN OBSERVING THE PRECEPTS AND HAVE DOUBLE PRECEPTS, FOR IN CIRCUMCISION THERE IS BOTH CIRCUMCISION AND UNCOVERING, IN PRAYER-THE TZITZIT (FRINGES) AND THE TEFILIN, ON THEIR DOORS THEY HAVE THE MEZUZAH AND THE CHANUKAH CANDLE. THEREFORE THEY ARE NOT AFRAID OF THE GEHENOM OF SNOW, WHICH COMES FOR LAZINESS AND SLACKNESS IN OBSERVING THE PRECEPTS. 604. Come and behold: \"She is not afraid of the snow for her household.\" This is the Congregation of Yisrael, whose \"household are clothed with scarlet,\" like we said in relation to the words \"crimsoned garments\" (Yeshayah 63:1), which is a robe of strict Judgment, in which punishment is exacted from the idolatrous nations. The Holy One, blessed be He, will don a red garment and a red sword and punish the red, ESAV. The garment is red as in \"crimsoned garment\" and \"Why is your apparel red\" (Ibid. 2). Of the red sword, we learn from the verse \"The sword of Hashem is filled with blood\" (Yeshayah 34:6). He will punish the red, as it is written: \"For Hashem has a sacrifice in Botzra\" (Ibid.). Also \"her household are clothed with scarlet,\" since THE NUKVA comes from strict judgment, AND THEREFORE \"SHE IS NOT AFRAID OF THE SNOW.\" 605. Rabbi Yitzchak said: This is indeed so, but we should explain the words \"her household are clothed with scarlet (Heb. shanim).\" These are the primordial years (Heb. shanim), THE SECRET OF THE SEVEN SFIROT CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, YESOD, AND MALCHUT, for she is included of them all and sucks from all sides, as it is written: \"All the rivers run into the sea\" (Kohelet 1:7). SHE THEREFORE DOES NOT FEAR THE JUDGMENTS, WHICH ARE SNOW. "},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 606. While they were walking, they met a child who was walking to Cappadocia behind a donkey, upon which rode an old man. The man said to the child, My son, read to me a passage of scripture. He said to him: I know not one but many passages, but alight first, or let me ride before you, and I will recite it. THE OLD MAN said to him: I am old and you are a child and I do not want to be put on the same level WITH YOU. THE CHILD said to him: Why then did you ask me to recite verses to you? He said: so that we shall walk together. The child said: may this old man hang himself, who rides and knows nothing but says he does not wish to be on a level with me. He left the old man and walked on the road. 607. When Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yitzchak arrived, the child approached them. They asked him and he told them what happened. Rabbi Yehuda said: You have acted rightly, come with us and let us sit here and hear your words. He said to them, I am weary since I have not eaten today. They took out bread and gave it to him. A miracle happened and they found a streamlet under a tree. He drank of it, and they drank and sat down. 61. \"Fret not yourself because of evil doers\" The child whom the rabbis encounter in the previous section opens a discussion about the title verse. We learn that this verse is not a prayer or a song, but rather, it was spoken by the Holy Spirit. The verse warns us not to challenge the wicked, since we do not know about the previous incarnations of our own souls, let alone anyone else's. Furthermore, this verse instructs us that we should not look on the deeds of others for fear of feeling envious. Envy of another, we're told, transgresses three negative precepts commanded by God. The Relevance of this Passage Casting a jealous eye towards our friends and foe's possessions and/or positions in life diverts our attention away from our own lot. We fail to appreciate our good fortune. Continued lack of appreciation inevitably leads to the loss of all that we should've held dear to our hearts. The mystical effect of these verses shifts our attention away from others and redirects it towards our own spiritual treasures. Additionally, passing judgement upon others causes us to neglect negative deeds and immoral traits ingrained in our own nature. A spiritual individual realizes that the trials and tribulations that challenge us are a direct result of prior incarnations and they cannot be measured against the deeds and fortunes of others, for all is relative in the overall scheme of spiritual evolution. 608. The child opened the discussion saying: \"To David. Fret not yourself because of evil doers, nor be envious against the workers of iniquity\" (Tehilim 37:1). HE ASKS: \"To David\" shows it is not a song, like in \"A psalm of David\" nor a prayer, AS IN \"A PRAYER OF DAVID.\" HE ANSWERS: Wherever it says just \"To David,\" it was spoken by the Holy Spirit. 609. \"Fret not yourself because of evil doers.\" HE ASKS: What is the meaning thereof? It should have been 'Join not EVIL DOERS.' HE REPLIES: Do not challenge the wicked, for you do not know your origins, TO WIT, THE INCARNATIONS OF YOUR SOUL. IT MIGHT BE that you will not prevail against him, if he is a tree which was never uprooted, A SOUL WHICH WAS NEVER INCARNATED BEFORE, WHICH IS VERY STRONG. Then you will be repulsed by him. "},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 610. \"Nor be envious against the workers of iniquity\": Do not look at their deeds, for you might be envious against them. For whoever sees their works and is not zealous for the glory of the Holy One, blessed be He, transgresses three negative precepts: \"You shall have no other Elohim beside me: You shall not make for yourself any carved idol, or any likeness of any thing...you shall not bow down to them, nor serve them: for I Hashem your Elohim am a jealous El\" (Shemot 20:5). 62. Small Aleph Here, the child, whom the rabbis encountered in section 59, first discourses on the verse, \"And The Creator called to Moshe.\" The small Aleph ? in this verse, he explains, refers to Malchut alone. This is also the case in the verse, \"and The Creator spoke to him out of the tent of meeting,\" since these words also came from Malchut alone. The Tent of Meeting is the Malchut, upon whom the calculation of time, all festivals, and Shabbat depends. The verse indicates that God spoke from above, from Binah. Zeir Anpin receives from Binah and gives to Malchut. In this way, Malchut was given permission from above to reveal supernal knowledge. We then learn about the verse, \"And they brought the Tabernacle to Moshe.\" The reason the Tabernacle was brought to Moshe is that he corresponds to Zeir Anpin. Therefore, Moshe is the master of the house and may do what no other man can. When Moshe is addressed in the verse, \"If any man of you bring an offering,\" it is Binah who is speaking. We are told that \"an offering to The Creator\" involves bringing the lower to join with that which is above, and \"your offering\" involves joining the upper with that which is below. All this is alluded to in the opening verses of Vayikra. The Relevance of this Passage Light radiates in the lives of all mankind when the realm of Zeir Anpin, the Upper World, enjoins with Malchut, our Lower World. Here, we connect to the Hebrew letter, the small Aleph ?, which embodies our physical dimension of time, space, and motion, known as Malchut. The Zohar's reference to the festivals, Shabbat, the Tabernacle, and Moses, is the mechanism by which Malchut [our world] makes contact with Zeir Anpin. Thus, each time our eyes fall upon these words, the two worlds are united and the Light of The Creator sparks our souls. 611. A man should therefore keep away from them, and turn his way from them. I therefore left and turned away from him. Now that I have found you, I shall recite these verses before you. He opened the discussion saying: \"And Hashem called (Heb. vayikra) to Moshe\" (Vayikra 1:1). Here IN VAYIKRA, the Aleph is small. HE ASKS why? HE ANSWERS: THIS SHOWS US that this calling was not perfect. Why? Because it was only in the tabernacle, WHICH IS TEMPORARY, and in a foreign land. For perfection is to be found only in the land of Yisrael. 612. WE HAVE TO EXPLAIN further ABOUT THE SMALL ALEPH, THAT IT IS SO BECAUSE here, IN THIS CALLING TO MOSHE, is the Shechinah, while there is perfection of a male and a female TOGETHER, AS IT IS WRITTEN \"Adam, Shet, Enosh\" (I Divrei Hayamim 1:1), 'Adam' IS SPELLED WITH A BIG ALEPH, WHICH ALLUDES TO the perfection of male and female IN UNION. But here THE ALEPH IS SMALL, WHICH ALLUDES TO the Nukva ALONE; NAMELY THE SHECHINAH. ANOTHER EVIDENCE comes from the end of the verse \"and Hashem spoke to him out of the Tent of Meeting.\" THE TENT OF MEETING IS THE NUKVA, HENCE THE WORDS CAME FROM THE NUKVA ALONE. Therefore the Aleph is small, AS SMALL LETTERS ALLUDE TO THE NUKVA, REGULAR ONES TO ZEIR ANPIN AND THE BIG TO IMA, OR TO THE PERFECTION OF MALE AND FEMALE TOGETHER, WHICH COMES THROUGH IMA ALONE. "},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 613. Further explanation CONCERNING the small Aleph: There is a story of a king who sat upon his throne, with a crown on his head. He is then called the supreme king. When he goes down to visit the house of his servant he is called little king. The Holy One, blessed be He, too, as long as He is above all, is called a supreme King. Once He comes to dwell below in the tabernacle, he is still a King, but not supreme as before. Therefore the Aleph is small. 614. \"And he called\" as we learned MEANS THAT he called and invited him to his palace. \"From the Tent of Meeting (Heb. moed)\": What is it? It is a tent, upon which depends the reckoning of times (Heb. moed), festivals and Shabbat, as it says, \"And let them be for signs, and for seasons\" (Beresheet 1:14). In her abides the reckoning. Who is she? The moon, NAMELY THE NUKVA, FROM WHICH COME ALL THE CHANGES FROM WEEK DAYS TO FESTIVALS AND SHABBAT, THROUGH CHANGES IN THE STATURE OF HER MOCHIN, as it says, \"A tent that shall not be taken down: its pegs shall not be removed for ever\" (Yeshayah 33:20), WHICH ALLUDES TO THE NUKVA CALLED TENT. 615. \"Saying\": HE ASKS: What does this mean? HE ANSWERS: IT MEANS revealing what is hidden inside. Wherever it says \"saying,\" like in: \"And Hashem spoke to Moshe, saying,\" it means that permission was given to reveal. Yet all is one, and it is well since the revelation was given to the moon, THE NUKVA, from where Moshe stands, ZEIR ANPIN, ACCORDING TO ORDER. 616. \"And Hashem spoke,\" above, BINAH, \"to Moshe,\" who is in the middle, ZEIR ANPIN, AS BINAH GIVES TO ZEIR ANPIN, \"saying,\" which is the last one, THE NUKVA, WHO RECEIVES FROM ZEIR ANPIN. She is the place where permission to reveal is given. \"And Hashem called to Moshe\": It is written before, \"And they brought the tabernacle to Moshe\" (Shemot 39:33). Why bring it to Moshe? They said: \"Moshe saw it upon mount Sinai, for the Holy One, blessed be He, showed it to him, as it says \"as it was shown you in the mountain\" (Shemot 27:8) \"according to the pattern which Hashem had shown Moshe\" (Bemidbar 8:4) and \"And look that you make them after their pattern, which was shown to you in the mountain\" (Shemot 25:40). They THEREFORE brought him THE TABERNACLE now, so he will see whether it resembles the tabernacle he has seen. 617. But ACCORDING TO THIS, IT IS YET HARD TO UNDERSTAND why they brought the tabernacle to Moshe, INSTEAD OF MOSHE COMING TO THE TABERNACLE. This is like a king who wanted to build a palace for the Matron. He ordered the craftsmen to build a room in one place, and a room in another place. Here will be the bed and there a place to recline. When the craftsmen finished it, they showed it to the king. So \"they brought the tabernacle to Moshe,\" who is the master of the house and a man of Elohim. MOSHE DID NOT GO TO THE TABERNACLE BUT IT WAS BROUGHT TO HIM. When the palace was built, the Matron invited the king to it, invited her husband THE KING to be with her. Therefore He \"called to Moshe,\" IS SPELLED WITH A SMALL ALEPH. THE SMALL ALEPH, WHICH IS THE NUKVA, CALLED TO MOSHE, ZEIR ANPIN, HER HUSBAND, TO BE WITH HER. "},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 618. And since Moshe is the master of the house, NAMELY ZEIR ANPIN, THE HUSBAND OF THE MATRON, it says, \"And Moshe would take the Tent\" --THE NUKVA CALLED TENT-\"and pitch it outside the camp\" (Shemot 33:6). Moshe, who is the master of the house, may do what no other man may. 619. \"And (Hashem) spoke to him.\" This is a different, supernal grade, BINAH. \"AND HE CALLED,\" THE NUKVA CALLED \"TO MOSHE,\" TIFERET, \"AND SPOKE\" IS BINAH. And so when Moshe was entering THE NUKVA, BINAH opened the discussion saying: \"If any man of you bring an offering\" (Vayikra 1:2), BINAH IS THE SPEAKER HERE. HE ASKS: Why say \"man\" here when IT WOULD HAVE SUFFICED TO SAY, \"IF ANY OF YOU BRING AN OFFERING\"? HE ANSWERS: When the sun and moon were united, TIFERET AND MALCHUT TOGETHER, BINAH opened and said: \"Man.\" AND THEY WERE BOTH NAMED \"MAN\" IN THE SINGULAR, as it is written: \"The sun and moon stood still in their habitation\" (Chavakuk 3:11), \"stood still\" in the singular instead of the plural, BECAUSE THE SCRIPTURE SPEAKS OF THEIR BEING IN UNION. 620. \"If any man of you bring an offering\": It is hinted here that whoever makes a service of sacrifice flawlessly, should be there as male and female; NAMELY BE MARRIED. This is derived from the words \"of you (plur.),\" which indicates that he will have your images; TO WIT, BINAH SAID THIS TO TIFERET AND MALCHUT, WHICH ARE THE SECRET OF MOSHE CALLED \"MAN.\" \"An offering to Hashem,\" by sacrificing all in order to be united both above and below. HENCE IT IS FIRST SAID \"AN OFFERING TO HASHEM,\" WHICH IS THE JOINING FROM BELOW UPWARD, AND THEN \"YOUR OFFERING,\" JOINING FROM ABOVE DOWNWARD, AS WAS SAID BEFORE. 621. \"Of the cattle\" shows the unity of man and beast as one, AS WAS SAID BEFORE: \"AN OFFERING TO HASHEM\" IS MAN, WHO IS THE UNISON FROM BELOW UPWARD, WHENCE IT IS DRAWN DOWNWARD BY THE SECRET OF \"YOUR OFFERING\" OF THE CATTLE. THE TWO UNISONS ILLUMINE TOGETHER. \"Of the oxen and of the sheep\": These are pure Chariots. In saying \"of the cattle (lit. 'animal'),\" one might think it refers to all livng creatures, both clean and unclean. It therefore continues \"of the oxen and of the sheep.\" 622. \"Shall you bring your offering\": HE ASKS: It should have been \"His offering,\" AS IT IS WRITTEN BEFORE \"AN OFFERING TO HASHEM.\" Why say \"your offering\"? HE ANSWERS: First it should have been \"an offering to Hashem\" and now \"your offering.\" HE EXPOUNDS UPON IT: \"An offering to Hashem\" is THE UNITY CALLED MAN, NAMELY THE RAISING OF THE NUKVA TO BE UNITED ABOVE THE CHEST OF ZEIR ANPIN, CALLED man. \"Your offering...of the oxen, and of the flock\" CONTINUES THE ILLUMINATION OF THE UNION OF THE CHEST UPWARD UNTO THE LOWER BEINGS WHO ARE FROM THE CHEST DOWNWARD in order to demonstrate the unison from below upward and from above downward. From below upward is \"the offering to Hashem\" and from above downward is \"your offering.\" "},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" 623. This is like a king who sits high upon a great mountain, and his throne is fixed on it. The king WHO SITS ON THE THRONE is higher than anyone. A man who offers the king a present, should take it up step by step until he reaches the top where the king sits up high. Everyone knows then that a present is brought up to the king. And this is the present to the king. When a present is brought down, then surely it is a present from the king above to his friend below. 624. So at first, man mounts the grades from below upward. This is \"an offering to Hashem.\" \"Of the cattle and of the oxen,\" he descends down the grades from above. This is \"your offering.\" Hence it is written, \"I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk\" (Shir Hashirim 5:1), which is a man and \"an offering to Hashem,\" FOR IT IS THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE, WHO SAYS, \"I HAVE EATEN...\"; \"Eat, O dear ones\" \"of the cattle, of the oxen and of the sheep.\" Then, \"shall you bring your offering.\" 625. Rabbi Yitzchak and Rabbi Yehuda came to him and kissed his forehead. They said: 'Blessed by the Merciful one that these words were not wasted on that old man', WHO WOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD THEM, AND THE WORDS WOULD BE LOST. They rose and went. While they were walking, they saw a vine planted in a garden. 63. \"Binding his foal to the vine,\" part two This second discussion of the title verse interprets it as containing a warning against the Klipah of the mule and the foal. Were it not for the aspect of the Holy Name included here, we are told, these Klipot would have destroyed the world. The vine signifies the congregation of Yisrael, which accepts none, but God, as a vine will receive no graft from another tree. The child and the rabbis then discuss the verse \"He washed his garments in wine.\" This is interpreted as signifying the Mashiach, the Female Principle, who will overpower the idolatrous nations. Another explanation is that the Yisraelites draw from Malchut in Holiness and she therefore brings them mercy and joy. The idolatrous nations, however, draw from Malchut excessively and are consequently subject to Judgment. We then learn the significance of the verse, \"His eyes are red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.\" The Written Law of the Torah is called milk, and the Oral Law is called wine. The passage is an allusion to the illumination of Binah and the intoxicating Torah, Malchut, which transfers judgment to those who draw it downwards from above. Following this, through an interpretation of the verse, \"And wine that makes glad the heart of man\", we learn that wine begins in joy and ends in judgment. The \"oil to brighten the face\" signifies the drawing of Chassadim from Aba, through which all judgments are cancelled. The final verse of this discourse is \"and bread which sustains the heart of man.\" It is a reference to the bread that sustains the world, signifying Zeir Anpin. The world depends on both bread and wine, the Female Principle and Zeir Anpin, since they sustain the world together. Therefore, when saying grace, there must be bread on the left side of the table and wine on the right, in order to pronounce a proper blessing on the Holy Name. The Relevance of this Passage All things must be in balance in order to generate and sustain fulfillment. Too much of a good thing eventually brings negativity. Common phrases, such as \"killing him with kindness,\" help convey the lesson and Light being distilled in this passage. The wisdom and discipline to balance our desires to receive with our desire to share are infused into our being. We are inspired to direct and channel our desires for spiritual purposes as opposed to selfish, indulgent pursuits, the former generating fulfillment, the latter bringing judgement down upon this world. "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 626. The child opened the discussion saying: \"Binding his foal to the vine, and his ass's colt to the choice vine.\" This verse contains a high mystery. HE ASKS: Why does it say \"osri (binding)\" instead of the customary 'oser' and \"iroh (ass)\" instead of 'ayir'? HE ANSWERS: It is the secret that the schoolchildren should beware of the sharp edge OF THE KLIPAH of the ass. The Holy Name Yud-Hei is included there in order to subdue it, TO WIT, THE YUD OF 'OSRI' TOGETHER WITH THE HEI OF 'IROH'. 627. Just as the Holy Name is hinted here, IT IS HINTED ALSO IN THE WORDS \"AND HIS ASS'S COLT TO THE CHOICE VINE.\" It says \"sorekah\" (choice vine) instead of 'sorek' and bni (colt) instead of ben, as it is written: \"And I have planted you a noble vine (Heb. sorek)\" (Yirmeyah 2:21) WITHOUT HEI and \"upon a colt (Heb. ben)\" (Zecharyah 9:9) WITHOUT YUD. Why then is it written here sorekah and bni? 628. As there is a Holy Name which subdues the KLIPAH foal, so there is a Holy Name to subdue the power of another KLIPAH, the ass. IT IS THE YUD OF 'BNI' AND THE HEI OF 'SOREKAH'. Were it not for the Holy Name hinted here, THESE TWO KLIPOT would have destroyed the world. Therefore, there is Yud-Hei against this force and Yud-Hei against the other force, which protect the world against them, and preserve man so they would have no mastery over him in the world. 629. \"Binding his foal to the vine\": What is the vine? It is the Congregation of Yisrael. Wherefore is it called vine? As a vine will receive no graft from another tree, so the Congregation of Yisrael accepts none but the Holy One, blessed be He. Therefore, in front of the Congregation of Yisrael all other forces are subdued, THE FOAL AND THE ASS, and they cannot harm and rule the world. Therefore scripture inserts between them the Holy Name Yud-Hei on the side OF THE FOAL and the side OF THE ASS. The ass's colt is uprooted due to the choice vine, THE CONGREGATION OF YISRAEL, as said: \"And I have planted you a noble vine.\" 630. \"He washed his garments in wine.\" HE ASKS: Why does it say \"washed\" IN THE PAST TENSE instead of \"washes\"? HE ANSWERS: He has been washing since the world was created. Who has? King Mashiach, THE NUKVA, THEREFORE \"WASHED\" IS IN THE PAST TENSE. \"In wine\" is the left side, NAMELY GVURAH OF ZEIR ANPIN; \"the blood of grapes\" is the left side below; NAMELY THE LEFT SIDE OF THE NUKVA. WITH THE TWO GVUROT, OF ZEIR ANPIN AND OF THE NUKVA HERSELF, SHE WASHES HER GARMENTS. Mashiach, THE NUKVA, will rule above over all the other forces of the idolatrous nations, and crush their stronghold above and below. "},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 631. Another explanation for \"He washed his garments in wine\": Wine is a sign of joy, AS IN THE VERSE, \"MY WINE, WHICH CHEERS ELOHIM AND MAN\" (SHOFTIM 9:13), and is all judgment, so King Mashiach, WHO IS THE NUKVA, brings joy to the children of Yisrael, WHO DRAW FROM IT IN HOLINESS, but is all judgment to the idolatrous nations, WHO DRAW FROM IT EXCESSIVELY. It is written, \"And the spirit of Elohim hovered over the surface of the waters\" (Beresheet 1:2). This is the spirit of King Mashiach, WHICH HOVERS TO AND FRO BETWEEN JUDGMENT AND MERCY. From the Creation of the world, He washes His garment in the holy wine, AS SAID ABOVE. 632. The following words are, \"His eyes are red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.\" \"HIS EYES ARE RED WITH WINE\" refers to the supernal wine, NAMELY THE ILLUMINATION OF THE LEFT OF BINAH. The Torah, THE NUKVA, when it intoxicating NAMELY TRANSFERS JUDGMENT TO THOSE WHO DRAW IT FROM ABOVE DOWNWARD, drinks it AND THEREFORE BINAH IS CONSIDERED, AS IF JUDGMENT COME FROM HER. \"And his teeth white with milk\" REFERS TO THE WRITTEN TORAH, ZEIR ANPIN, WHICH ACCEPTS CHASSADIM CALLED MILK, for the Torah is called wine and milk, the Written Torah, ZEIR ANPIN, IS CALLED MILK, and the Oral Law, THE NUKVA IS CALLED WINE. WINE IS COME FROM BINAH AND MILK FROM ABA. 633. It is written, \"And wine that makes glad the heart of man; oil to brighten the face\" (Tehilim 104:15). Indeed it is from the place called oil, WHICH IS ABA. HE EXPLAINS HIS WORDS, Come and behold: wine first makes glad, because it is a place whence all joys come from, NAMELY BINAH, and ends in Judgment WHEN IT EXPANDS TOWARDS THE NUKVA. Why? Because its ending is the place of gathering of all THE SFIROT, NAMELY THE NUKVA, WHICH IS THEREFORE CALLED THE CONGREGATION OF YISRAEL; NAMELY THE PLACE OF GATHERING OF ZEIR ANPIN. It is Judgment by which the world is sentenced. Therefore, since wine starts with joy and ends in Judgment, therefore there is \"oil to brighten the face,\" whence all the joys issue, FOR IN ORDER TO DRAW THE JOY OF WINE, AS IT WAS IN BINAH, IT DRAWS CHASSADIM FROM ABA, CALLED OIL. THROUGH THIS, ALL JUDGMENTS IN IT ARE CANCELLED AND IT ATTAINS THE FIRST THREE SFIROT, WHICH ARE CALLED FACE, THE SECRET OF \"OIL TO BRIGHTEN THE FACE.\" 634. \"And bread which sustains the heart of man\" (Tehilim 104:15): HE ASKS: What is the bread MENTIONED HERE? HE RESPONDS: It is the bread which sustains the world, THE SECRET OF CHASSADIM DRAWN FROM CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET OF ZEIR ANPIN. You might say that the world depends on it alone. This is not true. IT NEEDS ALSO WINE, THE SECRET OF THE ILLUMINATION OF CHOCHMAH, AS WAS SAID BEFORE, since night cannot exist without day. BUT THE DAY, WHICH IS ZEIR ANPIN, AND THE NIGHT, WHICH IS THE NUKVA, SHOULD BE JOINED TOGETHER. HENCE WE NEED BREAD FROM ZEIR ANPIN AND WINE FROM THE NUKVA, WHICH BOTH TOGETHER NOURISH THE WORLD. One must not separate them, AND DRAW BREAD ALONE FROM ZEIR ANPIN WITHOUT THE NUKVA. Whoever separates them is separated from life, as it is written: \"That He might make you know that man does not live by bread only\" (Devarim 8:3). Thus one should not separate them. "},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" 635. It may be asked why David said: \"And bread which sustains the heart of man,\" seeing that the world does not depend on it alone for nourishment. HE ANSWERS: The exact meaning of the words IS THAT in \"and bread\" there is and extra Vav (= and) like \"and Hashem,\" WHICH INCLUDES THE NUKVA, FOR WHEREVER IT SAYS \"AND HASHEM,\" IT INCLUDES HIM AND HIS COURT OF JUSTICE, WHICH IS THE NUKVA. HERE TOO \"AND\" INCLUDES THE NUKVA, and therefore all is together, NAMELY IN UNISON. 636. HE FURTHER EXPLAINS, Come and see when saying grace after meals, one should not bless over an empty table. There should be bread, THE ABUNDANCE OF ZEIR ANPIN, WHICH IS RIGHT, on the table, WHICH IS THE SECRET OF THE NUKVA, ON THE LEFT SIDE, and a glass of wine, WHICH IS THE ABUNDANCE OF THE NUKVA, on the right side, WHICH ALLUDES TO ZEIR ANPIN. What is the reason thereof? It attaches the left to the right AND BINDS THEM. Thus the bread, WHICH IS RIGHT, will be blessed by them, THROUGH THE UNION WITH THE LEFT, and be attached to them, and they will all become one knot for the proper blessing of the Holy Name. For bread, WHICH IS THE RIGHT, FROM ZEIR ANPIN, is connected to wine, WHICH IS LEFT, FROM THE NUKVA; and wine, WHICH IS OF THE LEFT, will be attached to the right. Then blessings rest on the world and the table, WHICH IS THE NUKVA, is properly perfected. 637. Rabbi Yitzchak said: Had we gone this way only to hear these words, it would have been worth our while. Rabbi Yehuda said: It would have been better for this child not to know so much and I fear that for this, he might not survive in the world. Why, said Rabbi Yitzchak. He said: Since this boy can look upon a place where a man is not permitted to look, I am afraid for him that he will observe and look there before the time will come for him to marry, BEFORE HE WILL COME OF AGE, and be punished for it. 638. The boy heard and said: I never fear punishment, because when my father passed away, he blessed me and prayed for me, and I know that my father's merit will protect me. They asked him, And who is your father? He said: I am the son of Rav Hamnuna Saba (the elder). They took him on their shoulders for three miles. 64. \"Out of the eater came forth food\" The rabbis explain the title verse to the young son of Rav Hamnuna Saba (the elder). Their interpretation reveals that Yesod consumes the abundance from the Sfirot of Zeir Anpin. Through the strength of the Strict Judgment of Zeir Anpin, the Upper Worlds, signifying the Written Law, Malchut, our physical world, receives an abundance of illumination from the left. The Oral Law, called \"honey,\" is this illumination of the left within Malchut. The righteous, we're told, provide \"food\" for the world, without which Malchut would be unable to endure. After delivering the young boy to his mother, the companions relate their experiences to Rabbi Shimon. A discussion of the verse, \"Gird your sword upon your thigh,\" ensues. One interpretation provided reveals that this alludes to the vengeance of the Holy Covenant that the avenging sword wreaks on he who impairs the imprinted sign of the Holy Covenant. He who desires to protect the Holy Covenant should prepare and arm himself against the Evil Inclination by drawing this sword upon his thigh before it. Another explanation instructs us that before setting out on a journey, one should prepare oneself through prayers and supplication, and gird oneself with righteousness. The Relevance of this Passage Here, judgments that are hanging over us are sweetened with supernal \"honey\". The Light and the blessings of the righteous blanket us with protection and help generate sustenance. We are inspired to seek the path of the Torah and, in turn, we gain the strength to triumph over our Evil Inclinations. Finally, this passage provides us with protection for all of our journeys by igniting sparks of righteousness within our soul. "},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" 639. They recited the verse, \"Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness\" (Shoftim 14:14). The boy said to them: You have spoken THIS VERSE, now explain it. They said to him: The Holy One, blessed be He, appointed us a path of life, you speak! 640. He opened the discussion saying: \"Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness.\" There is another verse which shows that the eater is the righteous, which says, \"The righteous eats to satisfy his soul\" (Mishlei 13:25). The righteous, YESOD, indeed eats and takes all THE ABUNDANCE FROM THE SFIROT OF ZEIR ANPIN. Why? \"To satisfy his soul\" and to satisfy that place called David's soul, NAMELY THE NUKVA. \"Came forth food\": Were it not for the righteous, no food would be provided for the world, and the world THE NUKVA would not have been able to endure. \"And out of the strong came forth sweetness.\" This is Yitzchak, who blessed Ya'akov \"of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth\" (Beresheet 27:28). 641. TO EXPLAIN further, though all THE SFIROT ARE one, YET were it not for the strength of the strict judgment OF THE LEFT OF ZEIR ANPIN, no honey would have come forth, WHICH IS THE ABUNDANCE OF THE ILLUMINATION OF THE LEFT WITHIN THE NUKVA, RECEIVED FROM THE LEFT OF ZEIR ANPIN. What is this honey? It is the Oral Law, THE NUKVA, of which it says, \"Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb\" (Tehilim 19:11). According to this, \"the strong\" is the Written Torah, WHICH IS THUS CALLED as it is written: \"Hashem gives strength to His people\" (Ibid. 29:11), ZEIR ANPIN WILL give strength. \"Came forth sweetness\": The Oral Law, NAMELY THE NUKVA, IN WHICH IS THE SECRET OF HONEY. 642. They went together for three days until they reached the village where the CHILD'S mother LIVED. When she saw them she prepared the house and they stayed there for three more days, blessed him and went. They related what happened to Rabbi Shimon. He said: Surely he inherited the Torah. Were it not for ancestral merits OF RABBI HAMNUNA SABA (THE ELDER), he would have been punished from above. But the Holy One, blessed be He, is with those who follow the Torah. They inherit it and their descendants after them forever, as it is written: \"As for me, this is my covenant with them, says Hashem; My spirit that is upon you\" (Yeshayah 59:21). 643. \"Zvulun shall dwell at the shore of the sea; and he shall be a haven for ships, and his border (or: thigh)...\" Rabbi Aba opened the discussion saying: \"Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty warrior: Your glory and your majesty\" (Tehilim 45:4). HE ASKS: Is there glory and majesty in girding and wearing a weapon? Whoever studies the Torah and is engaged in war for the Torah, and arms himself with it, he is praiseworthy. This is glory and majesty. Why does it say, \"Gird your sword...YOUR GLORY AND YOUR MAJESTY\"? "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" 644. HE ANSWERS: Assuredly the meaning of this is that the Holy One, blessed be He, imprinted the sign of the holy covenant upon men to preserve it and not blemish the impress of the King. Whoever impairs it, avenging sword rises before him and takes the vengeance of the holy covenant, which was imprinted upon him who impaired it. 645. He who desires to keep this place, THE HOLY COVENANT, should prepare and arm himself and when the Evil Inclination assails him, he should draw before it this sword which is upon the thigh, thus taking vengeance upon him who impairs that place CALLED THIGH. Hence, \"Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty warrior.\" He is mighty, WHO VANQUISHES THE EVIL INCLINATION, and is called mighty. This is \"your glory and majesty.\" 646. Another explanation for, \"Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty warrior\": Before setting out on a journey, one should prepare himself with a prayer to his Master, and gird himself with righteousness, NAMELY MALCHUT, which is the supernal sword, through prayers and supplication, as it is written: \"Righteousness shall go before him, and walk in the way of his steps\" (Tehilim 85:14). 647. Come and see: Zvulun always went out on ways and paths, and engaged in wars, and armed himself with this supernal sword, WHICH IS THE NUKVA ON THE SIDE OF JUDGMENTS OF THE ILLUMINATION OF THE LEFT, with prayers and supplication, before setting out on his way. He then overcame and conquered nations. You may say that this was assigned to Yehuda, who was ready with the sword to wage wars and prepare amendments, FOR HE IS OF THE ASPECT OF MALCHUT, why then Zvulun? HE ANSWERS, Come and behold: the twelve tribes were the adornments of the Matron, WHO IS MALCHUT. THUS ZVULUN TOO IS OF THE ASPECT OF MALCHUT. 65. Two improvements of the Nukva In Shir Hashirim, King Solomon made two corrections of the Nukva [Malchut]. One relates to the Jubilee, signifying Binah, and the other to the adornment of the bride, the Shmitah, signifying the Nukva. We learn that the creation was manifest in two places, the Upper and the Lower Worlds resembling each other perfectly. The upper Female Principle was corrected by Binah. These corrections were then drawn to the lower Nukva, thereby perfecting Malchut. The supernal correction is both concealed and revealed, because prophecy does not dwell outside the land of Yisrael. The lower correction is more exposed. The Relevance of this Passage Here we draw down Divine Light from the realm known as Binah that helps correct our souls and the entire world from previous iniquities. We draw the force of perfection from King Solomon, which helps bring about the final correction of the world and the age of Mashiach. "},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 648. Solomon mentioned two improvements of the Nukva in \"Shir Hashirim,\" one for the supernal shepherdess, the Yovel (Jubilee), NAMELY BINAH, and one for the bride, the Shmitah (Sabbatical year), NAMELY THE NUKVA. One correction above IN BINAH and one below IN THE NUKVA. The Creation too was manifest in two places, one work above IN BINAH, and one below IN THE NUKVA. This is why the Torah begins with Bet (=two), WHICH ALLUDES TO THE TWO NUKVAS. The work below resembled IN ITS PERFECTION the work above. ABA made the upper world, BINAH, and ZEIR ANPIN made the lower world, THE NUKVA. In the same manner, of the two improvements of the Nukvas mentioned by Solomon, the one is above and the other below. The upper one is fixed by the upper establishment of the Holy Name, WHICH IS BINAH, and the lower by the establishment of the lower one, THE NUKVA, like the upper establishment IN BINAH. ALL THE IMPROVEMENTS HE MADE IN THE SUPERNAL NUKVA, HE DREW UNTO THE LOWER NUKVA, BY WHICH THE LOWER NUKVA, MALCHUT, WAS PERFECTED AS THE UPPER ONE, BINAH. 649. Come and see: Happy is the portion of holy Ya'akov, who merited this. We learned that since the world was created, there was not a more complete bed as Ya'akov's bed. When Ya'akov prepared to depart from the world, he was whole on all sides, Avraham, CHESED, on his right, Yitzchak, GVURAH, on his left, and he himself, TIFERET, in the middle. The Shechinah was before him. THIS IS THE SECRET OF THE PERFECTION OF THE FOUR LEGS OF THE SUPERNAL THRONE, EACH OF CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, AND MALCHUT INCLUDES THREE, AMOUNTING TO TWELVE, AND BINAH ABOVE THEM. When Ya'akov saw this, he called his sons and said to them, \"Gather yourselves\" so there will be adornment above and below. 650. Come and see: The secret of the matter is that two establishments were there, an upper and a lower one, so that all will be perfected; TO WIT, THE NUKVA PERFECTED LIKE BINAH. HE EXPLAINS, The supernal correction is concealed and revealed, since it is the adornment of the Yovel (Jubilee), which Solomon mentioned in \"Shir Hashirim,\" which we said TO BE BINAH. The head, THE FIRST THREE SFIROT OF ZEIR ANPIN, is concealed, since it is not revealed here, nor should it be, AS THE HEAD OF ZEIR ANPIN IS ESTABLISHED BY CHESED AND GVURAH; the arms and the body, CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET, are exposed and known; the legs, NETZACH AND HOD, are concealed and cannot be seen. Why? Because prophecy, THE SECRET OF ABUNDANCE OF NETZACH AND HOD, does not dwell outside the land of Yisrael, WHICH IS THE NUKVA, TO WIT, THEIR ABUNDANCE IS REVEALED IN THE NUKVA, THE ILLUMINATION OF CHOCHMAH WHICH BELONGS TO HER, AND NOT TO ZEIR ANPIN. And this establishment is concealed and revealed. 651. Another lower establishment (also: 'adornment') is the adornment of the bride, which Solomon mentioned in \"Shir Hashirim,\" THE NUKVA. This adornment is more visible SINCE THE ILLUMINATION OF CHOCHMAH IS SHINING HERE. This adornment is done through the twelve tribes under her, and the adornment of her body; THEY ARE THE FOUR SFIROT CHESED AND GVURAH, NETZACH AND HOD, THREE KNOTS IN EACH AND TWELVE IN ALL. THE NUKVA, TIFERET BETWEEN THEM, IS ABOVE THEM, AS WAS SAID BEFORE. 66. Corrected by twelve in two worlds Rabbi Aba begins the discussion by quoting the verse, \"And he made a molten sea\" It stood upon twelve oxen\" We learn that when Ya'akov saw the adornment of the upper sea by the twelve chariots appointed from above, he wished to complete the adornment of the lower sea. He therefore called to his twelve sons to prepare to perfect the Faith. Thus, the Lower World, the Nukva, [Malchut] was perfected by the twelve tribes. Three tribes look to each of the four directions of the world, signifying Chesed, Gvurah, Netzach, and Hod, the arms and legs of the body of the Shechinah. We also "},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" learn that \"The seven eyes of The Creator\" allude to the seventy members of the Sanhedrin. The hairs on his head are signified by the great numbers in the camp of Reuven and in the camp of Yehuda. The discourse then turns again to supernal correction of the Jubilee discussed in the previous section. Finally, the rabbis expand upon the significance of the twelve supports of Binah and the Nukva, the structure of the metaphorical body, the seven supernal eyes, and the hairs of the head. The Relevance of this Passage Readers of this passage rise above the negative celestial influences of the twelve constellations. Ascending over the signs allows us to become the captains of our own destiny. In addition, the protective Light of the Shechinah encircles our souls. The twelve tribes also signify the support and foundation of the spiritual worlds, and thus, we draw support for our own efforts towards spiritual evolvement. 652. Rabbi Aba opened the discussion with the verse, \"And he made a molten sea... It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking towards the north, and three looking towards the west, and three looking towards the south, and three looking towards the east: and the sea was set above upon them\" (1 Melachim, 7:23-25) and \"twelve oxen under the sea\" (Ibid. 44). \"It stood upon twelve oxen\" surely, for the sea is adorned by twelve within both worlds, THE SUPERNAL WORLD BINAH AND THE LOWER WORLD THE NUKVA. The upper twelve are the Chariots appointed from above, and the lower twelve are the twelve tribes. When Ya'akov saw the supernal adornment, CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET, and the Shechinah in front of him, WHICH IS MALCHUT, THE SECRET OF THE FOUR LEGS OF THE SUPERNAL THRONE, he wanted to complete the adornment, so he called for his twelve sons and said to them \"Gather yourselves\" and prepare yourselves to perfect the faith, THE NUKVA. THEY SHOULD RECTIFY THEMSELVES WITH THE SECRET OF THE ADORNMENT OF THE NUKVA'S TWELVE, SO THAT THE NUKVA WILL BE COMPLETED, LIKE THE NUKVA ABOVE, BINAH, AND THE ADORNMENT WILL BE COMPLETED. 653. Come and see the twelve tribes with four standards to the four directions: \"Three looking towards the north, and three looking towards the west, and three looking towards the south, and three looking towards the east: and the sea was set above upon them.\" So three tribes look to each of the four directions of the world, three tribes to the right arm, CHESED, and three tribes to the left arm, GVURAH, three tribes to the right leg, NETZACH, and three tribes to the left leg, HOD. And the body of the Shechinah, TIFERET CALLED BODY, is above them, as it is written: \"and the sea was set above upon them,\" AS THE SEA IS THE SHECHINAH. 654. Why are there three tribes per arm and three tribes per leg? The secret of this is that there are three joints in the right arm OF THE LOWER BODY, and so in the left arm, the right leg and the left leg. They are twelve altogether, attached to the body as above. Whence do we know that? From the verse, \"All these are the twelve tribes of Yisrael: and this\" (Beresheet 49:28). HE ATTACHED: \"AND THIS IS THAT WHICH THEIR FATHER SPOKE TO THEM,\" THE NUKVA CALLED 'THIS', because the reckoning is complete with her, as it says, \"And the sea was set above upon them,\" WHICH IS THE NUKVA CALLED SEA. THUS, THE TWELVE TRIBES ARE ATTACHED TO THE BODY OF THE NUKVA ABOVE THEM. "},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" 655. \"The seven eyes of Hashem\" (Zecharyah 4:10) are the seven eyes of the congregation, the seventy members of the Sanhedrin, AS EACH OF CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, YESOD, AND MALCHUT IS INCLUDED OF TEN, SEVENTY IN ALL, IN THE SECRET OF THE VERSE \"FOR THE JUDGMENT IS HASHEM'S\" (DEVARIM 1:17). The hairs THAT GROW FROM THIS HEAD ARE ALLUDED TO in the verse, \"All that were numbered in the camp of Yehuda were a hundred thousand\" (Bemidbar 2:9). \"All that were numbered in the camp of Reuven...\" (Ibid. 16). ALL THOSE GREAT NUMBERS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE HAIRS OF THE NUKVA. 656. You may ask: In Egypt, when Ya'akov departed from the world, where was perfection at that time, where were all those WHO WERE NUMBERED IN THE CAMPS, WHO ARE CONSIDERED THE HAIRS OF THE NUKVA? IF THEY WERE NOT THERE, THE NUKVA WOULD THEN BE IMPERFECT, FOR THEY ARE HER HAIRS. HE ANSWERS: Indeed they were seventy souls WHEN THEY ARRIVED IN EGYPT, CORRESPONDING TO THE MOCHIN OF THE SEVENTY MEMBERS OF THE SANHEDRIN, and they begot innumerable descendants during the seventeen years THAT YA'AKOV LIVED IN EGYPT, as it is written: \"And the children of Yisrael were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty (Heb. vaya'atzmu)\" (Shemot 1:7). THEY WERE ALSO CONSIDERED AS THE HAIRS OF THE NUKVA, as it is written: \"They are more (Heb. atzmu) than the hairs of my head\" (Tehilim 40:13). THE WORD 'VAYA'ATZMU' ALSO REFERS TO HAIRS. THEY LIVED AT THE TIME OF YA'AKOV'S DEPARTURE FROM THE WORLD, AND THEREFORE PERFECTION WAS NOT INCOMPLETE. Happy is the portion of perfect Ya'akov, who was perfected above and below. 657. Rabbi Elazar said TO RABBI ABA, Surely this is AS YOU SAID. But concerning the supernal correction of the Yovel (Jubilee), BINAH, how could there be so much there, NAMELY THE TWELVE ASPECTS? RABBI ABA said to him: After the lion was set to enter the vineyard, who should follow? WHICH MEANS, EXPLAIN IT YOURSELF. 658. Rabbi Elazar opened the discussion with the verse, \"But He is unchangeable (lit. 'in one'), and who can turn Him? and what His soul desires, even that He does\" (Iyov 23:13). The supernal establishment IN BINAH is all one, and there is no division in it, like in the lower ESTABLISHMENT IN THE NUKVA, as it says \"and from thence it was parted, and branched into four streams\" (Beresheet 2:10), FOR THERE IS SEPARATION WITHIN THE NUKVA. Though it is divided, it all comes to one when you examine it, FOR EVEN THE SEPARATION IN HER IS FIXED BY THE CORRECTION OF THE TWELVE, AND THEN SHE IS ALL ONE. BUT BINAH WAS NEVER DIVIDED, AND NEEDS NO CORRECTION OF THE TWELVE TO FIX HER. 659. But the establishment of the supernal Yovel (Jubilee), BINAH, is also supported by twelve like the lower one, THE NUKVA. And though it is one, AND WAS NEVER PARTED, yet it perfects every side, this and that side-- IN OTHER WORDS, THE ONENESS OF THE SFIROT TO THE RIGHT COMPLETES THE LEFT SIDE, AND VICE VERSA. Thus the six supernal extremities, CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, AND YESOD OF BINAH, become twelve, since each of them lends ITS LIGHTS to its neighbor and is included of its neighbor's LIGHTS. Hence they are twelve, with the body OF BINAH above THEM. What is the body? It is Ya'akov, as we learned, NAMELY TIFERET, AND NOT BINAH WHICH IS THE HEAD AND NOT THE BODY. HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT BINAH IS THE BODY OVER THE TWELVE? HE ANSWERS: the head and the body are together, TO WIT, THEY ARE INCLUDED WITHIN EACH OTHER, AND THEREFORE THE ASPECT OF TIFERET EXISTS ALSO IN THE HEAD OF BINAH. "},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" 660. WE SHOULD further EXPLAIN THE SECRET OF twelve. There are three joints in the right arm, Chesed-Chassadim, WHICH MEANS ALL THREE PERTAIN TO CHESED, and three joints in the left arm, Gvurah-Gvurot, THAT IS THREE TIMES GVUROT, three joints in the right leg, Netzach-Netzachim, THAT IS, THREE TIMES NETZACH, and three joints in the left leg, Hod and Hodot. Together, there are twelve, and with the body, TIFERET, which stands above them, there are thirteen. The Torah too is expounded by the thirteen attributes, THE THIRTEEN ATTRIBUTES OF MERCY DRAWN FROM THE THIRTEEN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BEARD OF ARICH ANPIN, which are all one WITHOUT, HEAVEN FORBID, ANY SEPARATION. They are drawn from above downward as one, until they reach that place, which is in division, THE NUKVA. 661. There are seven supernal eyes, THE SEVEN SFIROT CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, YESOD, AND MALCHUT OF THE MOCHIN OF CHOCHMAH CALLED EYES. There are \"the eyes of Hashem, they rove (masc.) to and fro through the whole earth\" (Zecharyah 4:10), they are male; NAMELY OF ZEIR ANPIN, since it is the place of the male. It is written elsewhere, \"For the eyes of Hashem run (fem.) to and fro\" (II Divrei Hayamim 16:9), they are part of the adornments of the Shechinah below, the place of the female. The seven supernal eyes, EITHER OF THE MALE OR OF THE FEMALE, correspond to the verse, \"Yours, O Hashem, is the greatness (Chesed), and the Gvurah, AND THE TIFERET, AND THE NETZACH, AND THE HOD: FOR ALL THAT IS IN HEAVEN AND ON EARTH (YESOD) IS YOURS; YOURS IS THE KINGDOM (MALCHUT), O HASHEM\" (I Divrei Hayamim 29:11). This place, MALCHUT, completes each end OF THE SIX EXTREMITIES CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, AND YESOD. 662. We have to look at the hairs OF THE MALE AND THE FEMALE, as it is written: \"Who can utter the mighty acts (Heb. Gvurot) of Hashem?\" (Tehilim 106:2). FOR THE HAIRS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE GVUROT. IT ALSO SAYS, \"They are more than the hairs of my head\" (Tehilim 40:13), and \"Hashem's Chassadim have not ceased\" (Eichah 3:22), SINCE THE HAIRS ARE GVUROT YET INNUMERABLE CHASSADIM ARE DRAWN THROUGH THEM, OF WHICH IT SAYS, THE \"HASHEM'S CHASSADIM HAVE NOT CEASED.\" These adornments rise to another place, TO MOCHIN WITHOUT reckoning, though this place, THE MOCHIN OF RECKONING, THE SECRET OF THE SEVEN EYES OF HASHEM, is spoken of more, and put on a scale, NAMELY UPON THE CENTRAL COLUMN, WHICH BALANCES THE TWO SIDES OF THE SCALES, THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT, the upper, BINAH and the lower, MALCHUT. King Solomon expounded THE TWO NUKVAS, IN \"SHIR HASHIRIM,\" and they need explaining UNLIKE THE MOCHIN OF THE HAIRS WHICH NEEDS NO EXPLAINING. Happier is the portion of the righteous who know the ways of the Holy One, blessed be He. And in here, IN THE MOCHIN OF RECKONING, all is made known to the knowledgeable in judgment and law. 67. \"Zvulun shall dwell at the shore of the seas\" Rabbi Yehuda discourses on the title verse, explaining that the merchant Zvulun made an agreement with Yisachar, promising to support him while Yisachar studied the Torah. Zvulun was a merchant of the sea and he therefore dwelled among seamen for purposes of commerce. His border, we're told, reached Tzidion, a place of commerce. Although he did not occupy himself with the Torah, Zvulun is always placed before Yisachar during the blessings, because he took bread from his own mouth and gave to Yisachar. He who supports scholars of the Torah receives blessings from above and below, meriting wealth in this world and a portion in the world to come. Rabbi Aba then quotes the verse, \"Nor shall you suffer the salt of the Covenant.\" We learn that salt is important because it washes away and perfumes bitterness to give it taste. Without salt, the world would be unable to endure the bitterness of judgment, and it is through judgment that the world learns righteousness. Salt signifies Yesod, the Covenant that supports the world. Therefore, a meal lacking salt symbolically separates Yesod and the Female Principle, a division that brings death. Rabbi Aba and Rabbi Yosi conclude with a discussion of the verse, \"And that you will save alive my father and my mother\" Their interpretation reveals that Rachav asked for a token of life, which, she said, rests upon the letter of truth. She was given a cord of scarlet thread, a token of Yehoshua, because the time had come for the moon to rule. She thus received a token of the moon, signifying Malchut. The Relevance of this Passage A profound spiritual truth emerges from this text concerning the ultimate purpose of Torah and the dangers of blind religiosity. The purpose of Torah study is not in any way related to academic, religious, or scholarly pursuits. Rather, the Torah is a tool for spiritual development with the sole "},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" intention of leading one to the ultimate objective of \"loving thy neighbor as thyself.\" Remarkably, many \"devout\" and religious men will behave with intolerance towards others in the name of God and for the sake of their own religious objectives. This is completely contrary to the underlying purpose of the Torah. The Zohar stresses this point by explaining that the biblical character of Zvulun, who was not a student of the Torah, is always placed before Yisachar during the blessings because he took bread from his own mouth and gave to a man named Yisachar. Additionally, this passage helps sweeten the judgments that must appear in our lives, demonstrating that the Torah and the Light of the Zohar offer mankind a path to spiritual perfection that is most merciful and meaningful. 663. Rabbi Yehuda said: Zvulun and Yisachar made an agreement between them that one will sit and study the Torah, YISACHAR, and the other will be a merchant, ZVULUN, and support Yisachar, as it is written: \"And happy are those who hold (also: 'support') her\" (Mishlei 3:18). He used to traverse the seas with merchandise. It fell in his portion since his inheritance was by the sea. 664. He is therefore called \"leg (Heb. yerech),\" AS IT SAYS, \"AND HIS BORDER (HEB. YARCHATO) SHALL BE AT TZIDON,\" for it is the function of the leg to go to and fro. Hence it is written, \"Rejoice, Zvulun, in your going out; and Yisachar in your tents\" (Devarim 33:18). \"Zvulun shall dwell at the shore of the seas\" among the seamen for the purposes of commerce. \"The shore of the seas,\" though his inheritance was by one sea, THE GREAT SEA, YET \"SEAS\" IS IN THE PLURAL, since it dwelt between two seas, THE GREAT SEA AND THE SEA OF GALILEE, THOUGH ITS INHERITANCE DID NOT REACH THE SEA OF GALILEE. 665. Rabbi Yosi said: All the merchants of the other seas were interested in the merchandise of his own sea. HENCE IT SAYS \"THE SHORE OF THE SEAS\" IN THE PLURAL. \"And he shall be a haven for ships,\" NAMELY, where all ships would assemble to trade. \"And his border\": THIS IS DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN, FOR THE BORDER OF TZIDON IS FAR FROM ZVULUN. Rabbi Chizkiyah said to him: His leg reaches the border of Tzidon, A THIN STRIP OF LAND, RESEMBLING A LEG, STRETCHED FROM ZVULUN TO TZIDON. THROUGH THIS MEANS, Zvulun's border reached THE BORDER OF TZIDON, WHICH WAS a place of commerce, where all the tradesmen would come and go there with their merchandise. 666. Rabbi Acha said: It is written, \"Nor shall you suffer the salt of the covenant of your Elohim to be lacking from your meal offering: with all your offerings you shall offer salt\" (Vayikra 2:13). Why is salt SO IMPORTANT? Because it washes away and perfumes the bitterness to give it taste. Without salt, THE CENTRAL COLUMN WOULD NOT BE DRAWN and the world would not endure the bitterness. Hence it says, \"For when your Judgments are on the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness\" (Yeshayah 26:9). It is also written, \"Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne\" (Tehilim 89:15), FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS PERFECTED BY JUSTICE, THE SECRET OF SALT. 667. Salt is the covenant, YESOD; NAMELY THE CENTRAL COLUMN FROM THE CHEST DOWN, which supports the world, THE NUKVA, as it is written: \"Thus says Hashem; If my covenant be not day and night, it were as if I had not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth\" (Yirmeyah 33:25). Hence, THE CENTRAL COLUMN, YESOD, COMES ABOVE IT, SALT is called the covenant of your Elohim, YESOD BEING CALLED COVENANT, and the Salt Sea. The sea, WHICH IS THE NUKVA is called after THE SALT WHICH SWEETENS IT. "},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" 668. Rabbi Chiya said: It is written, \"For Hashem is righteous, He loves righteousness\" (Tehilim 11:7). This is the salt, YESOD, of the sea, MALCHUT, RIGHTEOUS BEING YESOD AND RIGHTEOUSNESS BEING MALCHUT. Whoever divides between them brings death upon himself. Therefore, it is written: \"Nor shall you suffer the salt...TO BE LACKING FROM YOUR MEAL OFFERING\" THUS SEPARATING YESOD, WHICH IS SALT, FROM THE MEAL OFFERING, WHICH IS THE NUKVA. They are inseparable. 669. Rabbi Acha said: The sea is one, but is called 'seas', IN THE VERSE, \"ZVULUN SHALL DWELL AT THE SHORE OF THE SEAS,\" as the water is clear in some places, in some places water is sweet, in another it is bitter. Hence, SINCE THERE ARE DIFFERENT PLACES, it is called seas. Thus it says, \"At the shore of the seas.\" Rabbi Aba said: Each tribe corresponds to one of the joints in the body, THE NUKVA. SINCE THERE ARE DIFFERENT PLACES WITHIN THE NUKVA CALLED SEA, ACCORDING TO THE PARTICULAR TRIBE, SHE IS THEREFORE CALLED SEAS IN THE PLURAL. 670. Rabbi Aba rose one night to study the Torah. While he was sitting, Rabbi Yosi knocked on the door. He said: In the prince's chest there are jewels, TO WIT, HE WANTED TO HEAR PEARLS OF WISDOM OF THE TORAH FROM HIM. 671. They sat, occupied with the Torah. The son of the innkeeper rose and sat before them. He asked, What is the meaning of the verse, \"And that you will save alive my father, and my mother\" (Yehoshua 2:13) and before that \"and give me a true token\" (Ibid. 12). What did she ask of them? Rabbi Aba said: You have asked a good question, but tell me son, if you have heard something. He said: I HAVE another question: They did not give her what she asked for, but \"you shall bind this cord of scarlet thread in the window\" (Ibid. 18), WHICH ALLUDES TO MALCHUT, THE SECRET OF THE VERSE, \"YOUR LIPS ARE LIKE A THREAD OF SCARLET\" (SHIR HASHIRIM 4:3), WHEN SHE ASKED FOR A TOKEN OF TRUTH, WHICH ALLUDES TO TIFERET, AS WAS SAID BEFORE. 672. HE ANSWERS: I have learned that she asked for a token of life, as it is written: \"And that you will save alive my father, and my mother.\" She also said that the token of life rests only upon the letter of Truth, which is Vav OF THE NAME YUD-HEI-VAV-HEI, TIFERET, where there is life, BEING THE TREE OF LIFE. I have learned that she asked for the token of Moshe, THE SECRET OF TIFERET. Why did they give her the cord of scarlet thread, WHICH IS A TOKEN OF YEHOSHUA, THE SECRET OF MALCHUT? 673. They told her that Moshe passed away from the world, since the sun has set, WHICH IS TIFERET AND THE ASPECT OF MOSHE. The time has come for the moon to rule. Therefore we give you the token of the moon, MALCHUT. What is it? The cord of scarlet thread, as it is written: \"Your lips are like a thread of scarlet.\" You shall have the token of Yehoshua, THE SECRET OF MALCHUT, because now is the rule of the moon. Rabbi Aba and Rabbi Yosi rose and kissed him. They said: Surely you shall be a head of a Yeshivah, or a great man in Yisrael. Who is he? Rabbi Bon. "},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 674. He asked further: All of Ya'akov's sons, the twelve tribes, were arranged below according to the order above, THE TWELVE KNOTS OF CHESED AND GVURAH, NETZACH AND HOD OF THE NUKVA. Why is Zvulun always placed before Yisachar during the blessings, although Yisachar was occupied with the Torah, which is universally put first? In the blessings, why was Zvulun placed before both by his father and Moshe? 675. HE ANSWERS: Zvulun was honored BY BEING PLACED BEFORE YISACHAR, since he took bread out of his own mouth and gave to Yisachar. He is therefore placed before YISACHAR in the blessings. From this, we learn that whoever supports a student of the Torah, receives blessings from above and below. He also merits two tables, which no other man is granted. He deserves to be blessed with wealth in this world, and a portion in the World to Come. Hence it says \"at the shore of the sea; and he shall be a haven for ships.\" Since it says \"Zvulun shall dwell the shore of the sea,\" why add \"a haven for ships\"? The \"shore of the sea\" is in this world and the \"haven for ships\" is in the World to Come, as it is written: \"There go the ships\" (Tehilim 104:26), WHICH WAS SAID OF \"THIS GREAT AND WIDE SEA\" (IBID. 25), WHICH IS BINAH, THE SECRET OF THE WORLD TO COME, for there abides the abundance of the World to Come. 68. \"I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem\" One explanation of the title verse tells us that the daughters of Jerusalem are the souls of the righteous, whom are always close to the King, informing Him daily of the welfare of Malchut. When a soul descends into this world, Malchut makes it swear to tell God of her love for Him so that He will be pleased with her. Man does this by proclaiming the union of the Holy Name with his mouth, heart, and soul. Another explanation of this verse interprets the daughters of Jerusalem as signifying the twelve tribes. Malchut stands upon twelve mountains and includes seven sides. The daughters of Jerusalem testify before God, declaring Yisrael love for Him. In this way, Malchut's love for Zeir Anpin is affirmed. The Relevance of this Passage Drawing upon the spiritual power of the righteous souls who have walked this earth throughout history, and the devout who dwell in our midst today, we unite our body and soul and our physical world with the Upper World realm called Zeir Anpin. This union produces bountiful beams of Light that brighten the lives of all mankind. The reference to the twelve Tribes is an indication to the twelve signs and the Zohar's assistance in helping us transcend the influences the stars and planets. Thus, control over our fate and fortunes is awarded to us through the spiritual power associated with this passage. 676. He opened the discussion saying: \"I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him, that I am sick with love\" (Shir Hashirim 5:8). HE ASKS: Who is closer to the King than the Congregation of Yisrael, THE NUKVA? Why then does she charge them, \"If you find my beloved, that you tell him.\" HE REPLIES: The daughters of Jerusalem are the souls of the righteous who are always near the King, and inform Him daily of the welfare of the Matron, THE NUKVA. 677. For so we have learnt that when a soul descends into the world, the Congregation of Yisrael, THE NUKVA, makes it swear to tell the king and inform Him of her love for Him, so He shall be pleased with her. "},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 678. By which means DO THE SOULS INFORM THE KING OF THE LOVE OF THE NUKVA FOR HIM? A man should proclaim the unison of the Holy Name, THE NUKVA OF ZEIR ANPIN, by mouth, heart and soul, and attach himself wholly TO ZEIR AND THE NUKVA, like a flame to a burning coal, by the union which causes the King to be well disposed towards the Queen, and to proclaim before the King her love for Him. 679. Another explanation: The daughters of Jerusalem are the twelve tribes; NAMELY THE TWELVE KNOTS OF CHESED AND GVURAH, NETZACH AND HOD UPON WHICH STANDS THE BODY OF THE NUKVA. For we have learned that Jerusalem, THE NUKVA, is established upon twelve mountains. Those who say that she stands upon only seven are not wholly correct, though all is one, for she includes seven SIDES; NAMELY CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, YESOD, AND MALCHUT, and has the four ASPECTS CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, AND MALCHUT and twelve ASPECTS, WHICH ARE THE TWELVE KNOTS WE MENTIONED. All is one, ONLY THAT THESE ARE GRADES WITHIN HER, BUT TWELVE IS PERFECTION. 680. Surely she is established upon twelve mountains, three to each side, THREE KNOTS TO THE SIDE OF CHESED, THREE TO GVURAH, THREE TO NETZACH AND THREE TO HOD, AND THE BODY OF THE NUKVA ABOVE THEM. They are then called living creature, as it is written: \"This is the living creature that I saw under the Elohim of Yisrael\" (Yechezkel 10:20). They are called the daughters of Jerusalem, since JERUSALEM, THE NUKVA, stands above them. They testify before the King OF THE LOVE of the Congregation of Yisrael, WHO CHARGES THEM, \"IF YOU FIND MY BELOVED, THAT YOU TELL HIM, THAT I AM SICK WITH LOVE.\" Hence it says, \"There the tribes used to go up, the tribes of Yah as a testimony unto Yisrael, to give thanks unto the name of Hashem\" (Tehilim 122:4), TO TESTIFY BEFORE YISRAEL, ZEIR ANPIN, OF THE LOVE OF THE NUKVA. Rabbi Yehuda said: Happy is the portion of Yisrael, who know the ways of the Holy One, blessed be He. Of them it is written, \"For you are a holy people to Hashem your Elohim, and Hashem has chosen you...\" (Devarim 14:2). 69. \"Yisachar is a strong ass\" Yisachar is compared to a ass because just as a ass will lie anywhere and accepts its burden without kicking its master, so Yisachar accepted the burden of the Torah and cared nothing for his own honor, only that of his Master. Another explanation of the title verse tells us that when night falls, dogs and ass roam, and fiends have permission to wreak havoc in the world. He who rises at night to study the Torah relegates the evil demons to the holes of the great abyss and subdues the Klipah of the ass, bringing it down into the holes underneath the ground. Through his study of the Torah, Yisachar subdued the Klipah of the mule, forcing it to descend and thereby preventing it from harming the world. Indeed, Yisachar studied the Torah constantly and cleaved so strongly to God that he weakened himself through his devotion. While walking, Rabbi Shimon, Rabbi Yosi, and Rabbi Chiya continue this discussion. Rabbi Shimon comments that he who studies the Torah receives a supernal reward that no other attains. This reward is alluded to in the name Yisachar. Indeed, we are told that when the truly righteous study the Torah, the power of the other nations will be subdued and the nations of the world will ask Yisrael to be their leaders. However, if the righteous do not study the Torah, the Klipah of the ass will cause Yisrael to go into exile, and they will be ruled by other nations. Rabbi Shimon next begins a discourse on the verse, \"As I looked, thrones were placed\" This means that when the Temple was destroyed, two thrones fell. The two thrones above are of Ya'akov and David, and the lower thrones signify Jerusalem and the students of the Torah. The discussion then addresses the meaning of the verse, \"The mandrakes give a fragrance.\" This alludes to Yisachar, who caused new and old studies of the Torah to be in the synagogues and colleges. We learn that all new expositions of the Torah ascend to the Garden of Eden where God sees them and rejoices. These words are then recorded in the supernal book. The section concludes by explaining that Yehuda, Yisachar, and Zvulun are all included in the same portion, each illuminating one of the three Columns. The Relevance of this Passage Each negative action that we've committed, large and small, knowingly or unknowingly, creates a negative blockage [Klipah] that dims the Light of our soul and diminishes the Light of The Creator in our lives. Torah study after midnight with a contrite heart summons forth awesome streams of Light that removes these blockages from our lives and the world, as evidenced by the Zohar's story of Yisachar. This mystical Light of the night shines forth in this passage when the eyes of man touch the letters that bespeak this ancient wisdom. Hence, we can remove the blockages [Klipot] that currently darken our daily lives through our connection to Yisachar. Moreover, we are inspired to pursue the secrets of the Torah through continued learning of Zohar, helping to hasten the final redemption. Yisachar embraced his burdens with great dedication, and so when our study of Torah and its spiritual treasures becomes difficult, that is when we draw upon the strength and character of Yisachar to struggle onward. These difficult times of study are when the greatest amount of Light is ready to be revealed. "},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" 681. \"Yisachar is a strong ass couching down between the shipfolds.\" Rabbi Elazar said: Why is Yisachar called an ass? If it is because he studied the Torah, he should be called a horse, a lion or a leopard. Why an ass? Because it is known that an ass would bear any burden without kicking his master like other livng creatures. It is not fastidious and would lie anywhere. Yisachar too is occupied with the Torah, accepts the burden of the Torah and does not kick the Holy One, blessed be He. He is not haughty and, like the ass, does not care for his honor, but for the honor of his Master. He is \"couching down between the sheepfolds\" as we said, that one should lie on the ground, live a life of privation and labor for the Torah. 682. Another explanation for \"Yisachar is a strong ass\": He opened the discussion saying: \"To David. Hashem is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? Hashem is the stronghold of my life: of whom shall I be afraid?\" (Tehilim 27:1). How dear are the words of the Torah, how beloved those who study the Torah before the Holy One, blessed be He. He who studies the Torah need not be afraid of the fiends in the world, for he is protected above and protected below. Moreover, he subdues the demons in the world and pushes them down into the great abyss. 683. Come and see when night falls, the UPPER gates are closed, and dogs and asses dwell and roam about the world. Permission is given to the fiends to destroy, and the inhabitants of the world sleep in their beds. The souls of the righteous ascend to take pleasure above. When the north wind stirs at midnight, there is holy awakening in the world, as has been explained in several places. 684. Happy is the portion of the man who rises from his bed at that time, to study the Torah. When he studies the Torah, he puts all the evil demons into the holes of the great abyss and subdues THE KLIPAH OF the ass and brings it down into the holes underneath the ground, into the filth of the refuse and the dung. 685. Hence Yisachar, who studied the Torah, subdued THE KLIPAH OF the ass, and brought it down. THE ASS, who climbed the stairs (Heb. gerem) in order to harm the world, AS IT IS WRITTEN: \"A STRONG (HEB. GAREM) ASS,\" was NOW brought into its place between the shipfolds, NAMELY AMONG THE REFUSE, the filth of the holes in the ground. THE VERSE TEACHES US THAT YISACHAR, BY STUDYING THE TORAH, BROUGHT DOWN THE KLIPAH OF THE STRONG ASS AND CAUSED HIM TO COUCH DOWN BETWEEN THE SHIPFOLDS, BY CASTING HIM DOWN INTO THE HOLES IN THE GROUND, AMONG THE REFUSE. "},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" 686. Come and behold: It is written: \"And he saw that rest was good and the land that it was pleasant and became a servant to tribute.\" \"And he saw that rest was good\" is the Written Law; while \"and the land that it was pleasant\" is the Oral Law. \"And he bowed his shoulder to bear\" the yoke of the Torah, and cleave to it days and nights, \"and became a servant to tribute\" to serve the Holy One, blessed be He, and cling to Him, thus weakening himself for it, BY STUDYING THE TORAH CONSTANTLY. 687. Rabbi Shimon, Rabbi Yosi and Rabbi Chiya were walking from the upper Galilee to Tiberias. Rabbi Shimon said: Let us discourse upon the Torah as we walk, for whoever can study the Torah but does not do so, risks his life and suffers besides from worldly cares, and evil oppression OF THE KINGDOM, like it is said of Yisachar, \"And he bowed his shoulder to bear.\" What is the meaning of \"bowed (also: 'turned aside')\"? It means he turned aside, as it says, \"But turned aside after unjust gain\" (I Shmuel 8:3); NAMELY TURNED ASIDE FROM THE PATH OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. For whoever turns aside and prefers not to suffer the yoke of the Torah, he forthwith \"became a servant to tribute,\" WHICH MEANS HE SANK UNDER THE BURDEN OF THE LAW AND THE OPPRESSION OF THE KINGDOM. 688. Rabbi Shimon opened the discussion saying: \"That I may cause those who love Me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures\" (Mishlei 8:21). Happy are the children of the world who study the Torah, for whoever is occupied with the Torah is beloved above and beloved below. He inherits the World to Come, as it is written: \"That I may cause those who love Me to inherit substance.\" The substance is the World to Come, BINAH, whose water, ITS ABUNDANCE, never stops flowing. FOR HE WHO STUDIES THE TORAH receives supernal reward, which no other man attains. What is it? It is substance (Heb. yesh), BINAH. This is alluded to by the name Yisachar, who studied the Torah, SINCE HIS NAME CONTAINS THE SYLABLES Yesh sachar (lit. 'there is a reward'), the reward for those who study the Torah; NAMELY THE MENTIONED Yesh. 689. It is written, \"As I looked, thrones were placed, and an ancient of days did sit\" (Daniel 7:9), WHICH MEANS THAT when the Temple was ruined, two thrones fell, for there are two thrones above and two below. HE EXPLAINS, There are two thrones above, THE THRONE OF YA'AKOV, ZEIR ANPIN, AND THE THRONE OF DAVID, MALCHUT. When the lower throne was removed from the upper throne, the throne of Ya'akov from that of David, the latter fell. Hence it says, \"And cast down from heaven (to) earth\" (Eichah 2:1). The two thrones below, Jerusalem and the students of the Torah, resemble the thrones above, for the students of the Torah are the throne of Ya'akov, ZEIR ANPIN, and Jerusalem is the throne of David, MALCHUT. HENCE TWO THRONES FELL, THE UPPER THRONE OF DAVID, THE NUKVA, AND THE THRONE OF THE TERRESTRIAL JERUSALEM. It is therefore written: \"Thrones were placed\" IN THE PLURAL instead of 'throne' IN THE SINGULAR, for more than one throne fell, for the sole reason of the insult to the Torah. "},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" 690. Come and see: when the truly righteous study the Torah, all the forces of the other nations and the armies, with all their power and legions, are subdued and no longer rule the world. Yisrael are appointed BY THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD, TO WIT, THEY ARE ASKED BY THEM to be their leaders. THIS IS THE SECRET OF THE NAME YISACHAR, YESH-SACHAR AS EXPLAINED. But if not, THE KLIPAH OF the ass causes Yisrael to go into exile and fall into the hands of the peoples and be ruled by them. And all this is because, \"he saw rest that it was good,\" HE SAW THAT THE TORAH IS GOOD AND ready before him, and he could receive as his reward her benefits and comforts, yet he turned his way so as not to bear the burden of the Torah, and therefore \"became a servant to tribute\" IN EXILE. 691. It is written, \"The mandrakes give a fragrance, and at our gates are all manner of choice fruits, new and old\" (Shir Hashirim 7:14). Reuven found those mandrakes in the field, as it is written: \"And found mandrakes in the field\" (Beresheet 30:14). New expositions of the Torah are discoursed only by him, as it is written: \"And of the sons of Yisachar were those who had knowledge of the times\" (I Divrei Hayamim 12:32). 692. \"And at our gates are all manner of choice fruits\": It is THE CHILDREN OF YISACHAR, who caused them to be at our gates; NAMELY the doors to the synagogues and colleges. \"All manner of choice fruits, new and old\" are studies of the Torah, new and old, which are revealed through them in order to bring near Yisrael to their Father above. Hence it says, \"to know what Yisrael ought to do\" (I Divrei Hayamim 12:32). 693. \"Which I have laid up for you, O my beloved\" (Shir Hashirim 7:14): From this we learned that whoever studies the Torah appropriately and knows new, joyous words, these words rise up to the King's throne, WHICH IS THE NUKVA, THE THRONE OF ZEIR ANPIN. And the Congregation of Yisrael, THE NUKVA, opens the gates before them and conceals them. And when the Holy One, blessed be He, enters the Garden of Eden to take delight in the righteous AT MIDNIGHT, she brings THE NEW EXPOSITIONS ON THE TORAH before Him, and the Holy One, blessed be He, sees them and rejoices. He then crowns himself with supernal crowns and rejoices with the Matron, THE NUKVA. This is the meaning of the words \"new and old, which I have laid up for you O my beloved,\" WHICH SHE UTTERS AT MIDNIGHT, WHEN BRINGING OUT THE NEW EXPOSITIONS ON THE TORAH BEFORE THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE. From that time on, the words OF THE STUDENT, WHO GLADDENS BY HIS WORDS, are written in the SUPERNAL book, as it says \"and a book of remembrance was written before Him\" (Malachi 3:16).

So far extends the sway of Yehuda, the arm which includes all THE THREE COLUMNS, through the strength of the sides, SOUTH, NORTH AND EAST, the three joints of the arm. TO WIT, YEHUDA, YISACHAR, AND ZVULUN ARE PLACED TOGETHER IN THIS PORTION, AS IN RELATION TO THE STANDARDS, FOR YEHUDA IS THE ILLUMINATION OF THE RIGHT COLUMN, YISACHAR THE LEFT AND ZVULUN THE CENTRAL COLUMN, so that Yehuda will overcome all THE OTHER SIDE. 70. \"Dan shall judge his people\" The Zohar expounds upon the tribe of Dan. When the Jews were trekking through the desert, the tribe of Dan was placed in the rear to watch over the other tribes. The Zohar then speaks of the spiritual routes taken by each of the tribes, and in doing so, reveals that each route was already inscribed a cosmic blueprint designed to arouse spiritual Light in this world. Ya'akov specifically blessed the tribe of Dan with the words \"Dan should be snake on the road.\" The Zohar then asks what this blessing means. The lower most dimension, in this case the end of the procession, represents the lowest level of Light and therefore represents the beginning and opening for negativity to enter. Dan is the watch guard protecting all the tribes from any intrusions from the negative snake known as the Satan. The Relevance of this Passage The cosmic sentinel that is the tribe of Dan, blankets us with a protective armor of Light that keeps negative entities, evil thoughts, and destructive emotions incited by the angel Satan, at bay. 695. \"Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Yisrael.\" Rabbi Chiya said: This verse should have been, 'Dan shall judge the tribes of Yisrael' or 'Dan shall judge the tribes of Yisrael as one.' What is the meaning of \"Dan shall judge his people\" followed by \"as one of the tribes of Yisrael\"? 696. HE ANSWERS: Dan, whom it says was \"rearward of all the camps\" (Bemidbar 10:25), is the left thigh, NAMELY HOD, and went last. HE EXPLAINS, Come and see: when Yehuda and Reuven march, the Levites and the ark unfurl their standard and then the standard of Efraim marches to the west. The right thigh marches according to order, BY WHICH THE RIGHT THIGH GOES BEFORE THE LEFT THIGH, DAN. THEREFORE DAN IS THE LAST TO MOVE. You may say that Zvulun is the one who goes in and out, as it says of him, \"Rejoice, Zvulun, in your going out\" (Devarim 33:18), FOR HE PERTAINS TO THE THIGH, AS EXPRESSLY STATED, \"And his border (also: 'thigh') shall be at Tzidon.\" ZVULUN THEN SHOULD BE THE THIGH AND NOT EFRAIM. HE ANSWERS: Yehuda comprises all of them. 697. HE EXPLAINS THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE FOUR STANDARDS, SAYING: come and behold: the upper Malchut, THE NUKVA OF ZEIR ANPIN, comprised everything, ALL THE TWELVE JOINTS, and Yehuda is the lower Malchut. As the upper Malchut comprises everything, so does the lower Malchut (kingdom), Yehuda, comprise the whole body and the thigh; NAMELY TIFERET AND THE TWELVE JOINTS IN THE ARMS AND LEGS, in order to grow in strength. 698. It is written, \"From his right hand went a fiery law for them\" (Devarim 33:2), which means that the Torah was given from the side of Gvurah, WHICH IS FIRE. BUT Gvurah was included within the right, CHESED, in its body, TIFERET, and the thigh, NETZACH AND HOD, and all THE SFIROT. The first corps OF THE STANDARDS is Yehuda's, which is Malchut from the side of Gvurah, BUT included within the right in the body and in the thigh, and all THE SFIROT, like Malchut above, THE NUKVA OF ZEIR ANPIN, comprises all THE SFIROT. "},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" 699. The second corps of the standards is Reuven's, who was on the south side, which is right, CHESED. But the strength of the right, OF REUVEN, was taken by Yehuda, since the kingship was removed from Reuven, for \"unstable as water, you shall not excel.\" So Yehuda took it and was reinforced with the power of the right, which was Reuven's. It is also said of David, WHO IS COME FROM YEHUDA, \"Hashem says to my master, 'Sit at my right hand'\" (Tehilim 110:1), because left is included in the right and has become strengthened. And so is written, \"The right hand of Hashem does valiantly\" (Ibid. 118:16). SINCE YEHUDA TOOK ALL REUVEN'S POWER, HE WAS THE FIRST TO MARCH. Yehuda and Reuven were the two arms, REUVEN THE RIGHT AND YEHUDA THE LEFT ARM. 700. The third corps of the standards is that of Efraim, who is the right thigh, NETZACH, which always goes before the left. Dan, who is the left thigh, HOD, goes last and is therefore \"the rearward of all the camps\" and marches last. 701. Yehuda had a portion in the two arms, CHESED AND GVURAH, since Reuven, who is the right arm, lost his birthright, priesthood and the kingship. It therefore says of Yehuda, \"Let his hands be sufficient for him; and be you a help to him from his enemies\" (Devarim 33:7), WHICH REFERS TO THE TWO HANDS, CHESED AND GVURAH. 702. Come and behold: It is written: \"The king made a great throne of ivory\" (I Melachim 10:18). The throne of Solomon was constructed after the supernal pattern, and all the supernal forms, NAMELY THE LION, THE OX, AND SO ON, were upon it. THUS THE LOWER MALCHUT, SOLOMON, WHO IS A DESCENDANT OF YEHUDA, INCLUDES ALL THE SFIROT LIKE THE UPPER MALCHUT. Of this says the verse, \"Then Solomon sat on the throne of Hashem as king\" (I Divrei Hayamim 29:23). The word king without attributes POSSIBLY DOES NOT REFER TO SOLOMON, BUT ALLUDES TO THE SUPERNAL MALCHUT. THE LESSON OF THE VERSE IS THAT \"SOLOMON SAT ON THE THRONE OF HASHEM\" LIKE A KING, THE SUPERNAL MALCHUT, AND LIKE IT COMPRISED ALL THE SFIROT. \"Then Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was firmly established\" (I Melachim 2:12). \"HIS KINGDOM\" REFERS TO THE SUPERNAL MALCHUT, WHICH MEANS THAT the moon, THE SUPERNAL KINGDOM, was full. HERE TOO, \"AS KING\" ALLUDES TO THE SUPERNAL MALCHUT. 703. \"Dan shall judge his people\" first, and then \"the tribes of Yisrael.\" THE WORD \"as one\" MEANS like the lone one in the world, TO WIT, HE JUDGED ON HIS OWN LIKE THE ONLY ONE OF THE WORLD. This applies to Shimshon, who singlehandedly executed justice in the world, sentenced and killed by himself and needed no help. "},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" 704. \"Dan shall judge his people.\" Rabbi Yitzchak said: Dan is a serpent which lurks in ways and paths. It may be said that this is true for Shimshon alone. NOT SO, but this is also true above. It is the little serpent in \"the rearward of all the camps\" AT THE END OF THE GRADES OF HOLINESS. It lurks in the ways and paths, and from it issue armies and hosts OF FIENDS, which lurk in wait for people, TO PUNISH THEM for the sins they cast behind their backs, TO WIT, WHICH THEY DID NOT NOTICE, AND THEN SAY THEY DID NOT COMMIT. Rabbi Chiya said: This was the primordial serpent above before it was tempered by the gladdening wine. 705. \"A serpent by the way\": Come and see: as there is a way above IN BINAH, so there is a way below IN MALCHUT. The sea is divided THROUGH THESE TWO WAYS into several paths on each side, EACH INCLUDED OF BOTH. There is one path, which adds MOCHIN OF THE FIRST THREE SFIROT to the sea, MALCHUT. It breeds all kinds of bad fish, FOR THE KLIPOT APPROACH TO SUCK ABUNDANCE FROM THERE AND THUS GROW. As the water below breed good fish, bad fish and frogs, so bad fish issue FROM THE SUPERNAL SEA. 706. When THE KLIPOT go by way of the sea, THEY SUCK ABUNDANCE FROM IT, they are seen riding on horses, and were it not for the serpent in the rearward of the camps, NAMELY DAN, THE LITTLE SERPENT which lies in the end of the paths and wards them off, they would destroy the world. OF THEM SAYS THE VERSE, \"THAT BITES THE HORSE'S HEELS, SO THAT HIS RIDER SHALL FALL BACKWARD.\" THESE ARE THE DEMONS WHO RIDE HORSES. From the side OF THE KLIPOT, sorcerers come into the world. Come and behold: it is written of Bila'am: \"He went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments (lit. 'serpents')\" (Bemidbar 24:1), which are made to cast spells with their charms. 707. See the words: \"Dan shall be a serpent by the way.\" HE ASKS: What way is this? HE ANSWERS: Whoever follows the serpent, rejects the household of heaven, CAUSES DIMINUTION IN THE HOLY HOSTS IN THE SUPERNAL WORLD. How so? Because this is a way which begins above, as it is written: \"Who makes a way in the sea\" (Yeshayah 43:16). Whoever follows the serpent, it is as if he treads this way and lessens it, BY DIMINISHING ITS ABUNDANCE, since from this way the upper worlds are sustained. HE SPOILS THEIR NOURISHMENT AND CAUSES THEM TO BECOME THIN. 708. You may ask why Dan is in this grade, WHICH IS OF THE ASPECT OF THE EVIL KLIPAH. HE ANSWERS: Like \"the bright blade of a revolving sword to guard the way to The Tree of Life\" (Beresheet 3:24), IT SAYS here \"that bites the horse's heels...\" for the protection of all the camps. Rabbi Elazar said: This is the fixing of the throne. TO WIT, DAN HOLDING TO THE GRADE OF THE KLIPAH IS THE UPHOLDING OF THE NUKVA, TO KEEP HER FROM THE SUCKING OF THE FIENDS WHICH RIDE HORSES. Come and see: Upon Solomon's throne, there is a serpent dangling from the scepter above the lions THAT ARE ON THE THRONE, WHICH TEACHES US THAT THERE IS A SERPENT IN THE MAKING OF THE THRONE. "},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" 709. It is written: \"And the spirit of Hashem began to move him in the camp of Dan\" (Shoftim 13:25). Come and see: Shimshon was a permanent Nazir and a recluse of great strength. He was a serpent in this world against the heathen nations, for he inherited the portion of blessings of his ancestor Dan, as it is written: \"Dan shall be a serpent by the way.\" 710. Rabbi Chiya said: We understand about the serpent, but what of the adder? He said to him: The secret of making spells is that the serpent is an adder, THOUGH THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT SPECIES, THEY CAST THE SAME SPELLS AS IF THEY WERE OF THE SAME KIND. It is written also of the evil Bilaam, who was omniscient, that he \"went to a steep place (Heb. shefi)\" (Bemidbar 23:3), WHICH ALLUDES TO THE ADDER (HEB. SHEFIFON), THOUGH BEFORE IT IS WRITTEN: \"HE WENT NOT, AS AT OTHER TIMES, TO SEEK SERPENTS.\" He used now the one now the other, NOW THE SERPENT AND NOW THE ADDER, SINCE HE HAD KNOWLEDGE OF BOTH. 711. You may say that it does not pertain to Dan's grade to use THE SERPENT AND THE ADDER. HE REPLIES: Indeed it does not, but he was appointed over this grade TO USE IT FOR THE NEEDS OF HOLINESS, being of the last grade. This is to his honor, for there are chieftains charged by the King over this or that, and it is considered to be an honor to all the appointed TO BE APPOINTED BY THE KING, REGARDLESS AS TO WHAT THEY ARE APPOINTED OVER, for the King's throne is fixed through all the chiefs together, and under them there are paths and grades for the good and for evil, all of them united in the making of the throne, THE NUKVA. Hence Dan is to the north, NAMELY THE LEFT THIGH OF THE NUKVA WHICH IS HOD. In a hole of the great abyss, IN THE END OF THE LEFT THIGH, WHICH IS BINAH OF THE KLIPAH, there are many battalions of evil demons, all in charge of harming the world. 712. For this reason, Ya'akov prayed, saying, \"I wait for your salvation, O Hashem.\" HE ASKS: Why does he not ask for salvation in regard to the other tribes, only to this one. HE REPLIES: This is because he has seen the force and strength of the serpent, when judgment is aroused to overpower holiness. HE THEREFORE PRAYED FOR SALVATION. 713. Rabbi Yosi and Rabbi Chizkiyah were going to visit Rabbi Shimon in Cappadocia. Rabbi Chizkiyah said: It is known that a man should first pronounce the praises of his Master and only then to say his prayer. A QUESTION ARISES: What of a man who is in distress or in trouble and wishes to pray, yet cannot pronounce his Master's praises? "},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" 714. Rabbi Yosi said to him: He is not fully devoted in heart and desire, yet why should he fail to praise his Master? He should first pronounce his Master's praises, though not with perfect devotion, and then say his prayer. This is the meaning of \"A prayer of David. Hear the right, O Hashem, attend to my cry\" (Tehilim 17:1). First, \"Hear the right, O Hashem,\" which is the praises for the Master, and only then \"attend to my cry give ear to my prayer.\" Whoever can praise his Master, yet does not do so, of him it is written: \"Even when you make many prayers, I will not hear...\" (Yeshayah 1:15). 715. It is written, \"The one lamb shall you offer in the morning, and the other lamb shall you offer at evening\" (Bemidbar 28:4). The prayers were ordained in the place of the daily offering, THE MORNING PRAYER CORRESPONDS TO THE MORNING OFFERING, MINCHAH TO THE EVENING OFFERING. Come and see: by the awakening below CAUSED BY THE SACRIFICE OF THE OFFERING, there is also awakening above. Through the awakening above towards that which is higher still, IT IS AROUSED too, until the awakening reaches the place where the candle is to be lit, and it is lit. Thus IT IS FOUND THAT through the ascent of the smoke WHICH RISES FROM THE OFFERING below, the candle is lit above, WHICH IS THE NUKVA. When this candle is lit, all other candles are lit and all the worlds are blessed through it. Thus the awakening of the offering is the support of the world, and the blessings of all worlds. 716. HE EXPLAINS HIS WORDS: How is this performed? When the smoke from the offering commences to rise, the holy forms appointed over the world OF ASIYAH are prepared to rouse AND RAISE MAYIM NUKVIN (FEMALE WATER.) They are aroused towards the grades above them IN THE WORLD OF YETZIRAH, with great desire, as it says, \"The young lions roar after their prey...\" (Tehilim 104:21). Those OF THE WORLD OF YETZIRAH are aroused toward the grades above them IN THE WORLD OF BRIYAH, UNTIL THE AWAKENING REACHES THE PLACE WHERE THE CANDLE IS TO BE LIT; NAMELY until the King, ZEIR ANPIN, wishes to join the Matron, THE NUKVA. 717. HE EXPLAINS THE MEANING OF MAYIN NUKVIN (FEMALE WATER), saying that through the desire below, the lower waters, NAMELY MAYIN NUKVIN, rise to receive the upper waters FROM THE GRADE ABOVE IT. The lower waters do not flow save through the arousal of the desire of the lower one. Then the desire OF THE LOWER AND THE UPPER cleave together, the lower waters flow to meet the DESCENDING upper waters, AND THE MATING IS CONSUMMATED. The worlds are blessed, all the candles lit, and the upper and lower beings are endowed with blessings. "},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" 718. Come and see: the priests FROM THE RIGHT COLUMN and the Levites FROM THE LEFT COLUMN are aroused WHEN THEY SACRIFICE THE OFFERING, so as to join the right with the left. Rabbi Chizkiyah said: This is true, yet I have heard AN EXPLANATION TO THIS. AT THE TIME OF OFFERING, the one stirs the left, NAMELY THE LEVITES, and the other, THE PRIESTS, the right. For the union of the male and the female occurs only through left and right, as it says, \"His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me\" (Shir Hashirim 2:6). AFTER THE EMBRACE OF RIGHT AND LEFT, the male is united to the female with desire, all the worlds are blessed and there is joy high and low. 719. The priests and Levites then stir below THE OFFERING in order to arouse desire and love above, DESIRE BEING THE SECRET OF THE LEFT AND LOVE THE SECRET OF THE RIGHT, since all depends upon right and left. FOR THE CENTRAL COLUMN ONLY BRINGS THEM TOGETHER. It is found that the sacrifice is the foundation of the world, the making of the world, the joy of the upper and lower. Rabbi Yosi said: You have spoken well, and this is so. I, TOO, have heard the same, yet I forgot it. NOW that I hear it from you, it all comes up to one, NAMELY THROUGH THE CENTRAL COLUMN, WHICH BRINGS TOGETHER RIGHT AND LEFT AND COMPLETES THEM. 720. Now that prayer has taken the place of sacrifice, man should first pronounce the praise of the Holy One, blessed be He, fittingly, for if he does not, his prayer is no prayer. Come and see: The perfect praise for the Holy One, blessed be He, is made by him who knows how to properly unite the Holy Name, WHO CAN RAISE MAYIN NUKVIN (FEMALE WATERS) TO UNITE MALE AND FEMALE, for through this the upper and lower are awakened and draw blessings upon all the worlds. 721. Rabbi Chizkiyah said: The Holy One, blessed be He, put the children of Yisrael in exile among the nations for the sole purpose that the other nations be blessed through Yisrael, who daily draw blessings from above downward. 722. They went. As they were walking, they saw a snake on the road and turned aside. Another man came and the snake killed him. They turned their heads and saw the man dead. They said: Surely the snake acted by his Master's bidding; TO WIT, THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE, ORDERED HIM TO KILL THAT MAN. Blessed be the Merciful One who saved us. "},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":" 723. Rabbi Yosi opened the discussion with the verse: \"Dan shall be a serpent by the way.\" When was Dan a serpent? In the days of Yerovaam, as it is written: \"And the other put he in Dan\" (I Melachim 12:29). BECAUSE \"A SNAKE\" REFERS TO IDOL WORSHIPPING. And why was he put there \"by the road\"? \"By the way,\" so as to prevent the pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Dan was then a snake \"by the way\" of Yisrael. \"By the way\" indeed, as it says, \"the king took counsel, AND MADE TWO CALVES OF GOLD, AND SAID TO THEM, IT IS TOO MUCH FOR YOU TO GO UP TO JERUSALEM\" (IBID. 28). HE THUS MADE THIS SNAKE BY THE WAY TO JERUSALEM TO PREVENT THEIR GOING THERE ON PILGRIMAGE. \"An adder in the path\" bit Yisrael. They were put \"by the way\" and in the path to prevent the children of Yisrael from going up to Jerusalem to celebrate their festivals, offer sacrifices and offering and worship there. 724. Come and see: when it was time for Moshe to bless the tribes, he saw that Dan was attached to the serpent, and linked him again to the lion, WHICH IS CHESED. This is the meaning of the verse, \"And of Dan he said: 'Dan is a lion's whelp, that leaps from Bashan'\" (Devarim 33:22). Wherefore did he do this? So as to connect the first and the last standards: Yehuda's who is king, as it is written: \"Yehuda is a lion's whelp,\" the first of the standards, and Dan's in the rear, as is written, \"Dan is a lion's whelp, ...\" so as to link the beginning and the end to one place, THE LION WHICH IS CHESED. 725. \"I wait (lit. 'waited') for your salvation, O Hashem\" (Beresheet 49:18): Rabbi Chiya said: It is written, \"And he shall begin to deliver Yisrael out of the hand of the Plishtim\" (Shoftim 13:5). THIS IS THE SALVATION YA'AKOV WAITED FOR. Rabbi Acha said: Why DOES IT SAY, \"I waited\"? Ya'akov would have been dead these many years by then. Why did he say he was waiting for salvation? The secret of this matter is the verse, \"And it came to pass, when Moshe held up his hand, that Yisrael prevailed\" (Shemot 17:11). The word Yisrael without attributes IS ZEIR ANPIN; NAMELY THE ASPECT OF YA'AKOV. THUS THE SALVATION THROUGH SHIMSHON CONCERNS YA'AKOV, THOUGH HE HAD ALREADY PASSED AWAY. Hence he said: \"I wait (lit. 'waited') for your salvation, O Hashem.\" Rabbi Chiya said: Surely this is correct and well. Happy is the portion of the righteous who know how to study the Torah and merit through her life eternal, as it says \"for he is your life, and the length of your days: that you may dwell in the land...\" (Devarim 30:20). 71. \"Gad, raiders shall maraud him\" Rabbi Yisa explains the name Gad indicates that many hosts and legions are dependent on him, and that armies will issue from him and engage in war. The name Gad also signifies the sustenance that the water of the river flowing from the Garden of Eden provides to the poor and the needy. Indeed, if not for his lineage, Gad would have risen higher than all the tribes because of his name. We learn that, similar to Reuven, he was born at a propitious time. However, perfection later departed from him, and also like Reuven, he thus did not receive a portion in the Holy Land, but instead dwelt on the other side of the river Jordan. The Relevance of this Passage The spiritual strength and fortitude to wage war on our own Evil Inclination is instilled within us. Additionally, we awaken the spiritual Light that brings forth sustenance into our lives, helping to remove both spiritual and physical poverty from the landscape of human civilization. "},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" 726. \"Gad, raiders shall maraud him, but he shall overcome at the last.\" Rabbi Yisa said: From THE NAME Gad, we understand that armies will issue from him and engage in war. This is derived from the spelling of Gad, which is always spelled Gimel and Dalet, YESOD AND MALCHUT, from which UNION armies come forth, as Gimel gives, BEING YESOD, and Dalet receives, BEING MALCHUT. From this we understand how many hosts and legions come from them. HENCE IT SAYS, \"GAD, RAIDERS SHALL MARAUD HIM...\" 727. Come and see the water of that river which comes out and flows from the Garden of Eden, BINAH, never stops flowing. It supports the poor BY GIVING THE LIGHT OF CHASSADIM THROUGH GIMEL WHICH IS YESOD TO MALCHUT, WHICH IS DALET, THAT IS POOR (HEB. DALA) AND NEEDY. Hence, hosts and legions wait here for sustenance FROM BINAH, THE SECRET OF THE SAID RIVER. THIS UNION is therefore CALLED BY THE NAME OF Gad, THE GIMEL taking out FROM BINAH to give and DALET accepting and receiving from it. The house, THE NUKVA, is sustained together with her household men, THE HOSTS AND LEGIONS OF ANGELS THAT EXTEND FROM HER. 728. Rabbi Yitzchak said: Were Gad not of the sons of a handmaids, WHO ARE CONSIDERED HINDER PARTS, he would have succeeded in rising higher than all the tribes, BECAUSE OF THE HIGH AND PERFECT ORIGIN OF THE NAME GAD. It is written \"Ba Gad (Eng. 'Fortune comes')\" (Beresheet 30:10), but spelled \"Bagad (betrayed)\" without Aleph, since the hour of his birth was propitious, but later PERFECTION departed from him. This is the meaning of the words: \"My brethren have dealt deceitfully (Heb. bagdu) like a river\" (Iyov 6:15), since the flowing river, WHICH IS BINAH CALLED RIVER, turned away at that time, SINCE GAD WAS OF THE HINDER PARTS, UPON WHICH THE RIVER BINAH DOES NOT FLOW, AND GIMEL HAD NOTHING TO POUR UPON DALET. HENCE, it says \"bagad\" without Aleph, WHICH ALLUDES TO THE LACK OF BINAH'S ABUNDANCE. He therefore did not receive a portion in the Holy Land, BUT DWELT ACROSS THE JORDAN. 729. Rabbi Yehuda said: Whence do we know that the same happened to Reuven, WHO WAS AT FIRST OF A GREATER GRADE, WHICH LATER DEPARTED FROM HIM? From the verse: \"Unstable as water, you shall not excel\" WHICH MEANS that the water, THE LIGHTS OF BINAH, departed and did not flow. His deficiency was already explained THAT YA'AKOV THOUGHT OF RACHEL, AND THEREFORE HIS BIRTHRIGHT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM AND GIVEN TO YOSEF. Both REUVEN AND GAD did not receive a portion in the Holy Land, BUT ACROSS THE JORDAN, but they sent armies and troops AS THE VANGUARD BEFORE THE CHILDREN OF YISRAEL, to deliver the land to them. Come and behold: the flaw in Gad was made good in Asher, as it is written, \"Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.\" Now Gimel perfects Dalet. 72. \"Set me as a seal upon your heart\" While sheltering themselves from the bright sun in a cave, Rabbi Aba and Rabbi Elazar discuss the title verse. Rabbi Elazar tells of Rabbi Shimon's interpretation of this verse, explaining that only the souls of the righteous can raise the Female Waters of the Female Principle. After the male and female were joined, the Female Principle quoted the title verse, desiring to retain a likeness even in separation. Similarly, Yisrael desired to remain with the Shechinah in some way, even in exile. Yisrael' love for God is so strong that any separation from Him is as difficult to bear as the day when the spirit leaves the body. The discussion then turns to the verse, \"Jealousy is cruel as Sh'ol.\" We learn that jealousy is a sign of true love. Therefore, a man should be jealous of his wife so that he will be attached to her in complete love and will not look at other women. Another explanation is that when the wicked are brought down to Sh'ol, their sins are announced and the jealous demand reckoning for these sins. We then learn that the \"flame of Yah\" is the burning flame that comes out of the Shofar, the burning the flame of Yisrael love for God. This love burns so strongly that rather than extinguishing it, the \"many waters\" of Chesed add to it. Rabbi Shimon, Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Yitzchak then join Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba to conclude the discussion. The Relevance of this Passage "},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" Deep love for The Creator burns within us as Light and love emanate from these poetic words. This energy also helps to remove envy and jealousy of others from our hearts, while stirring a positive form of jealousy, passion, and appreciation for our spouses. 730. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba entered a cave in Lod to escape the bright sun upon the road. Rabbi Aba said: Let us encompass this cave with words of the Torah. Rabbi Elazar opened the discussion saying: \"Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm... its coals are coals of fire, the very flame of Hashem\" (Shir Hashirim 8:6). We have already roused this verse; NAMELY EXPLAINED IT. Yet one night, when I was attending to my father, RABBI SHIMON, I heard from him that the Congregation of Yisrael, the NUKVA, had no perfection, desire and passion towards the Holy One, blessed be He, but from the souls of the righteous, who excite the flow of the lower waters OF THE NUKVA toward the supernal waters OF ZEIR ANPIN; TO WIT, THEY RAISE THE MAYIN NUKVIN (FEMALE WATERS) OF THE NUKVA. Then is a time of complete desire and passion to become one and produce fruit. 731. Come and see: After THE MALE AND THE FEMALE cleaved to each other, and she was desirous OF ZEIR ANPIN, she said: \"Set me as a seal upon your heart.\" Why a seal? Because a seal, when it is imprinted, even after it is removed, its impress remains there, and is never erased, but its shape and likeness stay. Thus said the Congregation of Yisrael, THE NUKVA: Now that I have cleaved to you, even though I shall leave and go into exile, \"set me as a seal upon your heart\" so that my likeness will remain with you, like the seal which leaves its imprint wherever it is pressed. 732. \"For love is strong as death.\" It is as strong as the spirit taking leave of the body. For we have learned that when time comes for a man to depart from the world and he sees certain sights, the spirit goes to every limb in the body and courses on waves like a passenger UPON A BOAT at sea, without oars, helplessly going up and down. Nothing is more difficult than the day when the spirit takes leave of the body. So the love of the Congregation of Yisrael to the Holy One, blessed be He, is as strong as death is, when the spirit departs from the body. "},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" 733. \"Jealousy is cruel as Sh'ol...\" Whoever loves and is not jealous, his love is not true love. When he is jealous, love is perfected. From this we have learned that a man should be jealous of his wife, so as to be attached to her in complete love. For this way he does not look at other women. What is \"cruel (lit. 'hard') as Sh'ol\"? As it is hard for the wicked to descend to Sh'ol, so it is hard for the jealous lover to part from his love. 734. Another explanation for \"jealousy is cruel as Sh'ol\" is that when the wicked are brought down to Sh'ol, their sins are announced to them, for which they are brought down. They find it hard, so he who is jealous demands reckoning for sins, and enumerates all the SUSPICIOUS things SHE DID, and his love grows strong. 735. \"Its coals are coals of fire, the very flame of Yah.\" What is the very flame of Yah? It is the burning flame which comes out of the Shofar, YESOD OF IMA CALLED Yah. Once it is aroused, it burns. What is it? The Left COLUMN OF IMA, as it is written: \"His left hand is under my head\" (Shir Hashirim 8:3). It burns the flame of Yisrael's love, THE SHECHINAH, for the Holy One, blessed be He. 736. Therefore, \"many waters cannot quench love\" (Shir Hashirim 8:7), for when the right comes, which is water, CHESED, it adds to the burning of love, instead of extinguishing the flame of the left, as it says \"and his right hand embraces me\" (Ibid. 3). Hence \"many waters cannot quench love.\" All THE FOLLOWING VERSES are EXPOUNDED UPON in this manner. 737. As they were sitting, they heard Rabbi Shimon, who was coming this way together with Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yitzchak. RABBI SHIMON approached the cave, and Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba came out. Rabbi Shimon said: From the walls of the cave I see that the Shechinah is here. They sat. Rabbi Shimon asked, What are you studying? Rabbi Aba said: The Congregation of Yisrael's love for the Holy One, blessed be He. Rabbi Elazar explained the verse, \"Set me as a seal upon your heart\" as referring to the Congregation of Yisrael. Rabbi Shimon said: Elazar, you have looked upon sublime love and the bond of amity. "},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" 738. Rabbi Shimon was silent for a while, then said: Silence is good everywhere, except in relation to the Torah. I have a hidden secret, which I do not wish to be lost from you. It is a supernal matter, which I found in the book of Rav Hamnuna Saba (the elder). 739. Come and see: the male always chases after the female and arouses her love. Yet here I found that she arouses his love and courts him, AS SAID IN THE VERSE: \"SET ME AS A SEAL UPON YOUR HEART...\" According to custom, it is not proper that the female runs after the male. But OF NECESSITY this is a deep matter, a supernal matter HIDDEN among the King's treasures. 73. Three souls A discussion of the three souls reveals that there are actually four. The first is the supernal soul of all souls, which is hidden and never revealed. The second is the Nukva. The third and forth are the souls of the righteous below, which come from the soul of the female and the male, Zeir Anpin. Through the analogy of a king who sends his son away to be raised in a village until he is ready to learn the ways of the palace, we learn why the soul descends to this world only to leave at a later time. The soul never leaves this world until the Matron comes for it and delivers it to the King's palace, where it remains. The discourse then returns to the subject of the previous section, Yisrael love for God. We are told that the souls of the righteous, who are male, incite the female love and desire for Zeir Anpin. The rabbis conclude by explaining that the verse, \"The righteous is the foundation of the world,\" alludes to both Yesod of Zeir Anpin and the souls of the righteous. The Relevance of this Passage The wisdom woven throughout this passage awakens a deep desire within us to know our true purpose in this world. A love for the Light of The Creator and for spiritual truths is kindled in our hearts and soul, which, in turn, help unite the Lower and Upper Worlds. Spiritual work requires both an intellectual and emotional understanding in order to provide us with the impetus to continue onward. Here, an emotional awakening concerning our source and origin is born within us as we realize that spiritual growth brings us nearer to our supernal Father. 740. Come and see: There are three souls which pertain to certain supernal grades. The three are really four. The first is a supernal soul, which cannot be perceived by the higher treasurer, much less by the lower one. It is the soul of all the souls, hidden and never revealed to be known. All stem from it. 741. It is wrapped in a garment made of the splendor of the Carmel, which drips pearls, all linked as one like the limbs of the body. The supernal soul enters them, and displays through them its works, AS THE BODY REVEALS THE WORKS OF THE SOUL. It and they are one with nothing to divide them. This is the supernal soul, the most hidden. 742. Another soul is the Nukva, which hides among her armies, it She is their soul and receives a body from them. SHE IS CLOTHED IN THEM AS A SOUL WITHIN A BODY, so as to display through them her handiwork to all the world, just as the body is a vessel which executes its works through the soul. They are ATTACHED AND UNITED TO EACH OTHER, like the hidden ones above are attached. "},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" 743. Another soul is the souls of the righteous below. The souls of the righteous come from the supernal souls, the soul of the female and the soul of the male, ZEIR ANPIN. For this reason, the souls of the righteous are higher than all the armies and legions of angels above, SINCE ANGELS COME FROM THE OUTER PART OF THE NUKVA, BUT THE SOULS COME FROM THE INNER PART OF THE NUKVA AND ZEIR ANPIN, NAMELY FROM THEIR SOULS. 744. HE ASKS: You may say that if the souls are elevated on two sides, OF ZEIR ANPIN AND THE NUKVA, AND COME FROM THEIR INWARDNESS, why then do they descend into this world, and why leave it? HE ANSWERS: THIS IS LIKE a king who begot a son. He sent him to be raised in a village until it was time for him to be taught the ways of the palace. When the king heard his son is grown up, out of love for him, he sent the Matron his mother to fetch him. She brought him to the palace, where he rejoiced with HIS SON every day. 745. The Holy One, blessed be He, also begot a son by the Matron. Who is he? The Supernal Holy Soul, THE DESCENDANTS OF ZEIR AND NUKVA. He sent him to the village, NAMELY to this world, to be raised and be brought up in the ways of the King's palace. When the King saw that his son was grown up in this village, and that it was time to bring him to the palace, what did he do? Out of love for his son, he sent the Matron, who fetched him to his palace. The soul never leaves this world until the Matron comes for it, and brings it to the King's palace where it remains forever. 746. Yet it is the way of the world that the inhabitants of the village weep when the King's son parts from them. There was a wise man there, who said: Wherefore are you crying, is he not a king's son? It is not meet that he shall dwell among you any longer, but in his father's palace. Moshe too, who was wise, saw the inhabitants of the village crying, and said to them, \"You are the children of Hashem your Elohim: you shall not gash yourselves\" (Devarim 14:1). 747. Come and see: if all the righteous knew that they would be glad when the day comes for them to depart from this world. For is it not a high honor that the Matron comes for them to escort them into the King's palace, and that the King will daily rejoice in them? For the Holy One, blessed be He, amuses Himself only with the souls of the righteous. "},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" 748. Come and see: the love of the Congregation of Yisrael, THE NUKVA, for the Holy One, blessed be He, ZEIR ANPIN, is stirred by the souls of the righteous below. Since they come from the side of the King, ZEIR ANPIN, the side of the male, the female is aroused from the side of the male, and love is stirred. Thus the male incites affection and love within the female and she is united in love with the male. THIS SETTLES THE QUESTION, THAT IT IS NOT PROPER FOR THE FEMALE TO COURT THE MALE. NOW IT IS EXPLAINED, THAT THE SOULS OF THE RIGHTEOUS, WHO ARE MALE, INCITE IN HER THIS LOVE TO ZEIR ANPIN. 749. In the same manner, the desire of the female to pour forth lower waters towards the upper waters is aroused solely by the souls of the righteous. Happy are the righteous in this world and in the World to Come, for they support the upper and lower. Therefore it just says, \"The righteous is the foundation of the world\" (Mishlei 10:25), WHICH MAY MEAN EITHER THE SUPERNAL RIGHTEOUS, YESOD OF ZEIR ANPIN, OR THE SOULS OF THE RIGHTEOUS. BOTH MEANINGS ARE TRUE. 750. The secret thereof is that the righteous is Yesod above, YESOD OF ZEIR ANPIN, and Yesod below OF THE NUKVA AND THE SOULS OF THE RIGHTEOUS. The Congregation of Yisrael, THE NUKVA, comprises the upper and lower righteous. The righteous on this side, YESOD OF ZEIR ANPIN, and the righteous on that side, THE SOUL OF THE RIGHTEOUS BELOW, inherit THE NUKVA. Hence it says, \"The righteous shall inherit the earth\" (Tehilim 38:29), and assuredly they will inherit THE NUKVA CALLED earth. Come and see: The righteous, YESOD OF ZEIR ANPIN, inherits the earth, THE NUKVA, pours blessings upon it every day and furnishes it with delights and dainties which he draws FROM BINAH upon it. We have already explained this. 74. \"Out of Asher his bread shall be fat\" A discussion of the title verse interprets it as signifying Binah, which gives \"royal dainties\" to Yesod, which in turn then gives to Malchut, our dimension of physical matter. There are two types of bread: the bread of poverty, which is the bread of Malchut, and millet bread, the bread of Zeir Anpin. The bread mentioned in the title verse is that of Zeir Anpin. Zeir Anpin nourishes Malchut through the righteous, and Malchut distributes the \"royal dainties\" among the grades beneath her. Following a description of the double bread of Shabbat, there ensues a discussion of the verse, \"For the bread is spent.\" We are told that the upper bread of Zeir Anpin is referred to as masculine and includes all types of food, while the lower bread of the Nukva is feminine and refers only to bread. Finally, the discourse informs us Moshe revealed that Asher is mentioned above in Binah. We also learn that Asher is mentioned below, in relation to Malchut and is included in the support of Malchut, below the twelve tribes. The Relevance of this Passage Here, the righteous sages of antiquity, and the pious who walk among us in the present, assist us in connecting our souls and the entire world [Malchut] to the level of Zeir Anpin, the fountainhead of spiritual energy, including financial sustenance for our physical reality. 751. This is the secret of the verse, \"Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties,\" WHICH MEANS THAT ASHER IS THE SAID RIGHTEOUS, YESOD OF ZEIR ANPIN, THAT POURS DAINTIES UPON THE NUKVA. Yet he is not YESOD OF ZEIR ANPIN, as it is written: \"The daughters saw her, and called her happy\" (Shir Hashirim 6:9), WHICH IS AN ASPECT OF THE NUKVA AND NOT YESOD OF ZEIR ANPIN. Leah therefore said \"for the daughters will call me happy (Heb. oshri)\" (Beresheet 30:13). This is correct. Come and see: From the World to Come, BINAH, issues a flow upon the righteous, YESOD OF ZEIR ANPIN, to pour delicacies and dainties upon the earth, which has been bread of poverty turned millet bread. This is the meaning of, \"Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.\" We have already explained this. ASHER IS BINAH, WHICH GIVES ROYAL DAINTIES TO YESOD, AND YESOD TO THE NUKVA. "},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":" 752. Come and see: \"Out of Asher his bread shall be fat.\" This is the place which everyone calls happy. What is it? It is the World to Come, BINAH, which the upper and lower call happy and yearn for. \"His bread shall be fat\": HE ASKS: Whose BREAD? It does not specify the place OF BREAD. HE REPLIES: There is bread and bread, and in the same way there is a tree and tree. There is The Tree of Life, ZEIR ANPIN, and the tree upon which death depends, THE NUKVA. SO there is bread which is called bread of poverty, THE NUKVA, and there is bread called millet bread. What is THE MILLET BREAD? It is Vav OF THE NAME YUD-HEI-VAV-HEI, WHICH IS ZEIR ANPIN. This is \"his bread (Heb. lachmo)\": the bread (Heb. lechem) of Vav, NAMELY THE BREAD OF ZEIR ANPIN. Hence it says \"Behold, I will rain bread from heaven\" (Shemot 16:4), from heaven indeed, WHICH IS ZEIR ANPIN CALLED HEAVEN. 753. Hence, \"out of Asher his bread shall be fat.\" \"His bread\" includes the sylables lechem and the letter Vav, TO WIT, THE BREAD OF ZEIR ANPIN CALLED 'VAV', since from him-FROM BINAH CALLED 'ASHER'-the tree is nourished, and he, BINAH, adorns it WITH THE FIRST THREE SFIROT, as it says \"the crown with which his mother crowned him\" (Shir Hashirim 3:11), TO WIT, BINAH CALLED 'MOTHER'. When ZEIR ANPIN receives, he shall surely yield royal dainties (lit. 'of the king'). Who is the king? The Congregation of Yisrael, NAMELY THE NUKVA, which is nourished BY ZEIR ANPIN, who gives to her via the righteous, the holy grade of the sign of the covenant, NAMELY YESOD OF ZEIR ANPIN, and from THE NUKVA unto the other grades below IN BRIYAH, YETZIRAH AND ASIYAH, which resemble the ones above, TO WIT, THE IMPLEMENTS IN BRIYAH, YETZIRAH AND ASIYAH RESEMBLE THOSE IN ATZILUT. 754. In the book of Rav Hamnuna Saba (the elder), he said the following, \"Out of Asher his bread shall be fat\" refers to the Shabbat bread, which is doubly delightful, as it is written: \"They gathered double bread\" (Shemot 16:22). There are two kinds of breads, bread from heaven, FROM ZEIR ANPIN, and bread from the earth, FROM THE NUKVA. This is millet bread, BUT THE BREAD FROM THE EARTH DETACHED FROM THE BREAD FROM HEAVEN is the bread of poverty. On Shabbat, the lower bread OF THE NUKVA is included within the upper bread OF ZEIR ANPIN, and the lower is blessed by the upper. This is double bread. 755. RAV HAMNUNA SABA (THE ELDER) also said that the double bread of Shabbat, WHICH IS THE BREAD OF THE NUKVA, receives from the supernal Shabbat, BINAH, which flows and shines upon everything. The bread OF THE NUKVA is united with the bread OF BINAH and becomes double. HE EXPLAINS WHY HE DOES NOT TALK OF THE BREAD OF THE NUKVA AND THE BREAD OF ZEIR ANPIN, BUT THE BREAD OF BINAH. IT IS BECAUSE that uniformly the secret of bread is the Nukva, EITHER THE NUKVA OF ZEIR ANPIN, OR BINAH, WHICH IS ALSO A FEMALE. BUT THE ABUNDANCE OF ZEIR ANPIN IS NOT CALLED BREAD, SINCE IT IS MALE. Hence it is written: \"Shall be fat\" with a feminine suffix INSTEAD OF A MASCULINE. It also says \"save the bread which he did eat\" (Beresheet 39:6), WHICH ALLUDES TO the wife CALLED BREAD. HENCE BREAD IS AN ASPECT OF THE FEMALE. "},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" 756. One may ask about the verse: \"For the bread is spent in our vessels\" (I Shmuel 9:7), THAT THE WORD \"SPENT\" IS MASCULINE AND not feminine. THE REASON THEREFORE IS THAT other victuals BESIDES BREAD are also called bread. It can be noticed what would be other victuals and what would be bread, for upper bread OF ZEIR ANPIN is uniformly male, AND REFERS TO ALL KINDS OF FOOD. The lower bread OF THE NUKVA is uniformly female, AND REFERS TO BREAD ALONE. We find that it is sometimes written as masculine and sometimes as feminine. All is the same, and the one is like the other, ONLY ONE IS IN ZEIR ANPIN AND THE OTHER IN THE NUKVA, and all is correct. 757. Come and see: Asher is mentioned above IN BINAH and mentioned below in relation to the adornments of the bride, WHO IS THE NUKVA, since the sea, THE NUKVA, rests upon and is supported by all the twelve tribes, THE SECRET OF THE TWELVE OXEN. This is the meaning of: \"And the sea was set above upon them\" (I Melachim 7:25). ASHER THEN IS PART OF THE SUPPORT OF THE NUKVA. The secret of the matter is that it is established above IN BINAH and below on earth, THE NUKVA, through certain amendments after the pattern of the supernal world BINAH. It is established below through the twelve tribes WHO SUPPORT THE NUKVA, after the supernal pattern OF BINAH WHICH IS ESTABLISHED UPON THE TWELVE SUPPORTS OF ZEIR ANPIN. Hence there is the Shechinah above, BINAH, WHICH RESTS UPON THE TWELVE SUPPORTS OF ZEIR ANPIN, THE THREE COLUMNS, EACH OF THEM FOUR FACED and there is the Shechinah below, the NUKVA, through which Yisrael is included and established by the twelve tribes, and Asher is part of her support like the other tribes. 759. If it were not for Moshe who revealed THAT ASHER IS IN BINAH, it would not be made known. Thus it says, \"And let him dip his foot in oil\" (Devarim 33:24) to indicate his attachment to his place, which pours the anointing oil from ITS PLACE above IN BINAH. Therefore it says, \"Be Asher blessed above sons\" (Ibid.). 75. \"Naftali is a hind let loose\" An interpretation of this difficult section reveals that while Malchut is considered female, anything that rises above her to Binah is considered male. We learn that a male is considered perfect when he is circumcised, because he possesses the sign of the Covenant. Therefore, the verse, \"a male without blemish\", alludes to the virile member which must not be castrated. Although Binah is often referred to as female, since she has many feminine aspects, when the \"final part,\" the aspect of maleness, is revealed, all turns into male. The discussion next moves to the question of why God omitted Yosef and put Efraim in his place when He ordered the four standards for the twelve tribes in order to adorn the Shechinah. We learn that although Yosef was righteous, he had the imprint of the male. Because the Shechinah's adornments are all female, Yosef was removed and Efraim, who is of the feminine aspect, was put in his place. Finally, the rabbis provide further insight into the title verse through an explanation of the words, \"and your mouth (speech) is comely.\" The voice, which signifies Zeir Anpin, guides the speech, which signifies Malchut. Just as there is no voice without speech and vice versa, Malchut and Zeir Anpin cannot illuminate without each other. Thus, the whole depends on the part, and the part depends on the whole. The Relevance of this Passage The realization of the interconnectedness and perfect harmony of all reality begins to take hold within our consciousness. We receive purification of our negative sexual deeds and thoughts through the Light that is set aflame during circumcision. Our efforts of meditating upon these verses help to couple Malchut and Zeir Anpin bringing Light to the planet and balance to the male and female energies that permeate all worlds. "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" 759. Rabbi Shimon opened the discussion with: \"Naftali is a hind let loose: he gives goodly words\" (Beresheet 49:21). THIS VERSE IS CONSIDERED DIFFICULT, FOR SINCE IT SAYS \"A HIND LET LOOSE,\" IT SHOULD END WITH 'SHE GIVES GOODLY WORDS', INSTEAD OF \"HE.\" We have learned that the supernal world, BINAH, is the world of the male. Once something rises from the Congregation of Yisrael, WHICH IS FEMALE, it becomes male. Whence do we know that? From the burnt offering (Heb. olah). Why is it called olah (lit. 'goes up, fem.')? Because it rises up from the Nukva. Therefore, \"let him offer a male without blemish\" (Vayikra 1:3), AS ABOVE THE NUKVA IT IS MALE. FOR THIS REASON THE SUPERNAL WORLD, BINAH, IS CONSIDERED THE WORLD OF THE MALE. 760. HE ASKS: Why DOES SCRIPTURE say \"A MALE without blemish\"? Was there any intention of bringing it in pieces, that it admonishes \"without blemish (lit. 'perfect')\"? HE ANSWERS: What is perfect? It is expressed by the words: \"Walk before me, and be perfect\" (Beresheet 17:1). When was he perfect? At the time he was circumcised, since a male exists and is recognized only by the place called perfect, the sign of the covenant, which indicates the difference between male and female. Hence it says, \"Noach was a righteous perfect man\" (Beresheet 6:9), RIGHTEOUS BEING YESOD WHICH IS CALLED PERFECT. Therefore, the words \"a male without blemish\" allude to the virile member which must not be castrated. 761. HE ASKS: Yet it also says \"a female without blemish.\" HE ANSWERS: Assuredly, as YESOD is called \"righteous perfect,\" so does the Nukva, since she receives everything from him AND IS THEREFORE CALLED PERFECT LIKE HIM. BUT THE ATTRIBUTE \"PERFECT\" MAINLY REFERS TO THE MALE. Hence, the burnt offering which rises from the female unto the male IS MALE, since from that place, THE NUKVA, upwards, all is male. From the Nukva downward all is female, as has already been explained. 762. HE ASKS: But there is also a female above, BINAH. HE REPLIES: The final part of the body shows that the whole body is male. The head and body OF BINAH--BEING CHOCHMAH, BINAH, AND DA'AT, CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET, are feminine until the final part, TO NETZACH, HOD, AND YESOD, CLOTHED IN THE HEAD OF ZEIR ANPIN TO ASSUME THE ASPECT OF THE MALE LIKE HIM, and when the final part shows THE ASPECT OF MALENESS all turns into male, EVEN ITS CHOCHMAH, BINAH, DA'AT, CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET, WHICH ARE NOT CLOTHED WITH ZEIR ANPIN, ARE ALSO CONSIDERED TO BE MALE. But here IN THE NUKVA OF ZEIR ANPIN, the head and end are considered feminine, for her whole body is female, WITHOUT A TRACE OF MALE IN HER NETZACH HOD YESOD. 763. Come and see: There is a supernal secret in this, for we notice that Ya'akov blessed Yosef together with his brothers. But when the Holy One, blessed be He, ordered the four standards of the Shechinah for the twelve tribes, through which to adorn the Shechinah, he omitted Yosef and put Efraim in his place. Why did he omit Yosef? If you say that it was for his sins, this is not so, for he was righteous. "},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" 764. HE ANSWERS: The secret meaning of this is that Yosef was the imprint of the male, as it is written: \"Yosef is a fruitful bough, a fruitful bough by a well,\" WHICH IS THE ASPECT OF YESOD CALLED A FRUITFUL BOUGH, and \"from thence he fed the stone of Yisrael.\" The stone is the Congregation of Yisrael, NAMELY THE NUKVA, of which David said: \"The stone which the builders rejected has become the head stone of the corner\" (Tehilim 118:21). Since Yosef was the imprint of the male, he is called Yosef the righteous, for indeed he was righteous, YESOD. \"From thence he fed the stone of Yisrael\" WHICH GIVES TO THE NUKVA. 765. Since all the adornments of the Shechinah are female, FOR FROM THE NUKVA DOWNWARD ALL IS FEMALE, Yosef was removed from them and Efraim was assigned in his place to the TWELVE adornments, for he is of the aspect of the female. He was then stationed on the west side, the dwelling of the female, THE SHECHINAH BEING ON THE WEST, and the impress of the male, NAMELY YOSEF, was removed from the adornments, which are all of the world of the female and not of the world of the male. All adornments need to bear the aspect of the female. 766. Hence Yosef the righteous, YESOD WHICH IS MALE, was removed from the adornments and Efraim was put in his stead. Therefore all the twelve tribes WHO ARE CONSIDERED FEMALE, are the adornments of the Shechinah, and must bear the likeness of above; TO WIT, TO BE FEMALES LIKE THE SHECHINAH, except the grade of righteous OF THE TRIBES, WHICH IS YESOD, which turn all the members of the body into male and should not be counted among the twelve implements so that there will be no need to deduct him. 767. \"Naftali is a hind let loose: he gives goodly words\" as it says \"and your mouth (speech) is comely\" (Shir Hashirim 4:3), for the voice, ZEIR ANPIN, guides the speech, THE NUKVA. There is no voice without speech. The voice is sent from a deep place above, BINAH, to guide the speech, since there is no voice without speech nor speech without voice. This is the whole needing the part, and the part in need the whole. The voice comes forth from the south, WHICH IS THE RIGHT COLUMN, THE LIGHT OF CHASSADIM and leads the west, THE NUKVA, which inherits the two sides, THE LIGHT OF CHASSADIM FROM THE SOUTH AND THE LIGHT OF CHOCHMAH FROM THE WEST. Hence it is written, \"And of Naftali he said... possess you the west and the south\" (Devarim 33:23). Therefore it is said that \"Naftali is a hind let loose,\" NAMELY THE NUKVA below. In the same manner, the male above SHINES TOGETHER WITH HER, FOR THEY DO NOT SHINE THE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER. Hence, \"he gives goodly words\" is written in the masculine, WHICH IS ZEIR ANPIN, instead of the feminine. 76. Thought, voice, speech Thought, we are told, is the beginning of all. In the beginning, there was no separation between thought, voice, and speech, as signified by the verse, \"The Creator shall be one, and His Name One.\" Thought then expanded and was named Binah (Understanding) when it came to the place where the spirit dwelt. The spirit expands and utters a voice, which includes all forces and guides the speech. The Relevance of this Passage The energy flowing from this passage transports our souls back to the moment before creation where all was one. This all-embracing unity radiates Light that returns our entire being back to an embryonic state when we were free of any negativity and defilement. This process has a refining and purifying effect on us, removing blockages and darkness from the recesses of our souls. The Light of rejuvenation ignites within us, giving us renewed strength and power to continue our spiritual transformation. "},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":" 768. Come and see: Thought is the beginning of all. Thought is hidden inside and inscrutable. When thought further expanded, it came to where the spirit dwelt, and was there named Binah (understanding). Now it is not concealed as before, and though it is somewhat hidden, the spirit expands and utters a voice, which is composed of fire, water and wind, THE THREE COLUMNS north, south and east. This voice includes all forces, and guides the speech. It gives word its fixing, since it was sent from the place of the spirit and came to guide the word and utter correct words. 769. When you look at these grades, you shall find that thought, Binah, voice and speech are all one. This is the thought in the beginning of all. There was no separation but all was one and united. That very thought was attached to naught, KETER, never to separate. This is meant by: \"Hashem shall be one, and His name One\" (Zecharyah 14:9), and \"he gives goodly words\" refers to the body. 77. \"Yosef is a fruitful bough\" The Zohar offers a complex discourse concerning the exact makeup of the great spiritual channel Yosef. The Relevance of this Passage Yosef is considered to be the foundation of our physical world. Within the structure of the Ten Sfirot, Yosef corresponds to the dimension of Yesod, the doorway through which all the energy of the Upper Worlds enters our material realm. Yosef also corresponds to sustenance. Hence, in this passage, we draw the power of good fortune and we strengthen our soul's connection to the true foundation of all spirituality. 770. The ending of the body, YESOD, is referred to in the verse: \"Yosef is a fruitful bough, a fruitful bough by a well.\" HE ASKS: Why does it say twice \"A FRUITFUL BOUGH\"? HE ANSWERS: There is a fruitful bough above and a fruitful bough below. Why is there no fruitful bough below among the implements of the Matron, NAMELY AMONG THE TWELVE TRIBES, THE SECRET OF THE TWELVE OXEN, WHICH SUPPORT THE MATRON ABOVE? HE REPLIES: \"The daughters advanced upon the wall,\" WHICH MEANS THAT females are used as her implements, FEMALE ASPECTS, WHICH ARE THE SECRET OF THE TWELVE TRIBES, and not sons. AND YOSEF IS YESOD, WHICH IS A SON, NAMELY MALE. Hence it says, \"Many daughters have done virtuously\" (Mishlei 31:29). \"Many daughters have done virtuously\" are the twelve tribes, WHO ARE MADE A THRONE FOR THE NUKVA. THUS, THE VERSE ENDS WITH \"BUT YOU EXCEL (LIT. 'RISES ABOVE') THEM ALL\" (IBID.). 771. Come and see: the holy Malchut does not attain perfection as holy Malchut, until it is united with the patriarchs, WHO ARE CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET FROM THE CHEST AND ABOVE OF ZEIR ANPIN. When it joins them, the kingdom was turned into a complete building by the upper world, which is the world of the male, NAMELY BINAH, SINCE THEN CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET OF ZEIR ANPIN RECEIVE FROM ITS RIGHT SIDE, AND MALCHUT FROM BINAH'S LEFT SIDE. The supernal world is called seven years since it includes all seven years, AS BINAH INCLUDES WITHIN HER ALL THE SEVEN SFIROT CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, YESOD, AND MALCHUT CALLED SEVEN YEARS. "},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" 772. This is indicated by: \"And he built it seven years\" (I Melachim 6:38). This is the upper world BINAH, WHICH INCLUDES SEVEN YEARS. It therefore does not say 'in seven years', BUT SEVEN, as in: \"For six days Hashem made heaven and earth\" (Shemot 31:17), instead of 'in six days.' THIS MEANS THAT THE SIX DAYS CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, AND YESOD MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH; HERE ALSO IT MEANS THAT THE SEVEN YEARS, BINAH, BUILT IT. It is written: \"These are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created (Heb. be'hibar'am),\" the letters of \"be'avraham (Eng. 'in Avraham'),\" for Avraham, WHO IS CHESED, is called seven days, and by him the upper world, BINAH, was built. They are called the 'World of the Male'. 773. Likewise there are seven years below, CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, YESOD, AND MALCHUT DIVIDED AMONG THE TWELVE TRIBES, the secret of the lower world, THE NUKVA. This is the secret meaning of the words:, \"Seven days and seven days, fourteen days\" (I Melachim, 8:66). HE ASKS: From \"seven days and seven days,\" do I not know they amount to fourteen, WHY ADD \"FOURTEEN DAYS\"? HE ANSWERS: THEIR PURPOSE IS to indicate the upper and lower worlds, which are seven days and seven days, ALLUDED TO BY THE FOURTEEN DAYS. Those OF THE UPPER WORLD are males and those OF THE LOWER WORLD are females. This world, THE NUKVA, is above the females, CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, AND YESOD DIVIDED AMONG THE SAID TWELVE, as it is written: \"Many daughters have done virtuously.\" This refers to the twelve tribes, that \"have done virtuously,\" as \"all that were numbered in the camp of Yehuda...\" (Bemidbar 2:9) and the others MULTIPLIED EXCEEDINGLY. THUS THE VERSE ENDS WITH \"BUT YOU RISE ABOVE THEM ALL,\" SINCE THE NUKVA IS OVER THEM. 774. HE ASKS: You may say that the verse says \"many\" yet they are but twelve, excepting their virtuous deeds, FOR EACH MULTIPLIED, AS HINTED BY THE WORDS \"HAVE DONE VIRTUOUSLY.\" Why does it say \"many (Heb. rabot) daughters\"? HE REPLIES: Like in the verse: \"Because the cry of S'dom and Amorah is great (Heb. rabah)\" (Beresheet 18:20), \"many\" means that they are great, above all and greater than all. These are the great livng creatures. They \"have done virtuously\" AS EACH TRIBE MULTIPLIED EXCEEDINGLY. \"AND THOSE THAT ENCAMP BY HIM\" (BEMIDBAR 2), YISACHAR AND ZVULUN BY THE STANDARD OF YEHUDA, AND SO ON, are called 'small livng creatures', which join as one the great livng creatures, YEHUDA, REUVEN, EFRAIM AND DAN, so that the Matron, THE NUKVA, will be established by them. The upper and lower will rejoice in them. Hence it says, \"There is the Livyatan, whom you have made to play therein\" (Tehilim 104:26). THE LIVYATAN IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SMALL AND GREAT LIVNG CREATURES. Therefore \"many daughters have done virtuously...\" 775. Hence \"the daughters advanced upon the wall.\" HE ASKS: IT SAYS \"daughters advanced (sing.)\" INSTEAD OF IN THE PLURAL. HE ANSWERS: This is the reflection of that which is written above \"A FRUITFUL BOUGH BY A WELL.\" What is this WELL? It is the well of justice, THE NUKVA, WHICH RECEIVES JUSTICE, TIFERET. YOSEF gives to the well, THE NUKVA, which advances to take daughters for its adornment. \"The daughters advanced\": THE NUKVA ADVANCED WITH DAUGHTERS but not with sons, for daughters are worthy to establish her, but sons are not. \"They fiercely attacked him\" by looking lovingly at him, as it is written: \"Turn away your eyes from me, for they have overcome me\" (Shir Hashirim 6:5), FOR THEY BURN ME WITH YOUR LOVE'S FLAME. HERE TOO HE COULD NOT SUFFER THE NUKVA'S ARROWS OF LOVE. THIS IS THE MEANING OF \"THEY FIERCELY ATTACKED HIM\" and \"the archers hated him,\" THAT HE COULD NOT TOLERATE IT. "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":" 776. \"But his bow abode in strength.\" The bow IS THE NUKVA. HE ASKS: Why say \"his bow\" WHEN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 'BUT BOW ABODE...'? HE ANSWERS: It is YOSEF'S spouse, AND THEREFORE IT SAYS \"HIS BOW.\" \"In strength\" means that she clothed him in strength and might, and so his strength will not be enfeebled FOR HIS UNION WITH HER. For she knew that Yosef would not turn aside within his grade; TO WIT, HE WOULD NOT TURN, DUE TO MATING, TO THE LEFT GRADE, THE PLACE OF JUDGMENTS, since his sign of the covenant turns both right and left IN ONE. 777. What do the words \"were made supple (Heb. vayafozu)\" mean? HE ANSWERS: As it says, \"More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold (Heb. paz)\" (Tehilim 19:11) and \"nor shall it be valued with pure gold (Heb. paz)\" (Iyov 28: 18). HERE TOO, VAYAFOZU IS DERIVED FROM PAZ, FINE GOLD AND PRECARIOUSNESS, as his hands were precious with the sublime pearl, THE SUPERNAL NUKVA ABOVE THE CHEST, THAT RECEIVED ABUNDANCE FROM BEING UNITED. SHE RECEIVED \"by the hand of the mighty One of Ya'akov\" from the two sides, RIGHT AND LEFT, by which Ya'akov was strengthened. \"From thence he fed the stone of Yisrael,\" from thence that precious stone, THE NUKVA, was fed, like we said. We should further explain that the precious stone was fed by the twelve sides, north and south, WHICH ARE THE HANDS OF YA'AKOV, FOR THERE ARE CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, AND YESOD TO THE NORTH, AND CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, AND YESOD TO THE SOUTH, ALTOGETHER TWELVE. THE NUKVA is put in their midst to be blessed by them, fed by them via YOSEF the righteous. 778. Come and see: Yosef was bestowed yet another blessing \"by the El of your father, and He shall help you; AND BY (ET) SHADAI, AND HE SHALL BLESS YOU.\" This verse is hard to understand, since it says \"by the El of your father,\" when it should have been 'the El shall of your father help you.' It says \"Et Shadai\" instead of the particle 'el' as in \"and El Shadai give you Mercy before the man\" (Beresheet 43:14). \"And He shall bless you\" should have been 'He shall bless you.' 779. HE REPLIES: He inherited both above IN ZEIR ANPIN and below IN THE NUKVA. He inherited above, as it says \"by the El of your father,\" which is the supernal inheritance, a place called heaven, NAMELY ZEIR ANPIN, WHICH CHARIOT YA'AKOV WAS. \"And He shall help you\": He shall not exchange it for another place, and His help shall be from this place and no other. 780. \"And (et) Shadai\": What is the meaning of this phrase, SHOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN 'EL SHADAI', AS ASKED ABOVE? But this is another lower grade, as we have learned that uniformly \"Et (the) Hashem\" is the Shechinah, as in \"I saw (et) Hashem\" (Yechezkel 6:1), Et includes THE SHECHINAH. \"And the (Heb. et)\" ALLUDES TO ZEIR ANPIN, thus comprising day, ZEIR ANPIN in night, and night in day, as it is written: \"and (et) Shadai\" WITH VAV (=AND), since from thence blessings issue into the world. "},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" 781. We should explain further, Why it does not say 'And El Shadai', seeing that it has the same meaning as we said THAT IT TOO ALLUDES TO THE NUKVA, ALSO CALLED \"EL SHADAI,\" as it is written: \"and El Shadai give you mercy.\" All is the same SINCE \"AND EL SHADAI\" REFERS TO THE NUKVA LIKE \"AND (ET) SHADAI.\" Why then omit the Lamed and replace IT with Tav? It is a mystery, that when these paths come from above, TO WIT, THE 22 LETTERS, FROM WHICH EVERY PERFECTION IS SUPPLIED, the whole of the Torah, THE ABUNDANCE OF ZEIR ANPIN, is inherited by heaven, ZEIR ANPIN, as it is written: \"the (et) heaven\" (Beresheet 1:1), ET (ALEPH TAV) including all the 22 letters FROM ALEPH TO TAV. From here, they depart to the Oral Law, called earth, NAMELY THE NUKVA, as it says \"and the (et) earth\" (Ibid.), ALEPH TAV including the 22 letters RECEIVED BY THE NUKVA. AT FIRST, heaven, ZEIR ANPIN, includes them all as one, and then the moon, THE NUKVA, is adorned by them all; TO WIT, SHE RECEIVES THEM FROM ZEIR ANPIN and dwells in perfection. Blessings are then drawn from there, and thus it says \"and (et) Shadai,\" WHICH INDICATES THE GREAT PERFECTION OF THE INCLUSION OF THE 22 LETTERS OF THE NUKVA, WHENCE THERE ARE BLESSINGS. 782. \"And (Vav) he shall bless you\" IS SPELLED WITH VAV, for further lasting prevalence TO THE BLESSINGS. For wherever there is Vav, it is an indication of an increase and maintenance. Up to this point, it was said in general. Now he gives details, as is written: \"blessings of heaven...\" 783. \"The blessings of your father are potent above the blessings of my progenitors\" The blessings of your father YA'AKOV, THE CENTRAL COLUMN, are surely more potent THAN THE BLESSINGS OF AVRAHAM AND YITZCHAK, since Ya'akov inherited more praises than the patriarchs, he being perfect in all. He gave it all to Yosef. Why? Because this is fit, for the righteous, YESOD, NAMELY YOSEF, takes and inherits all together; TO WIT, HE RECEIVES FROM ALL THE SFIROT OF ZEIR ANPIN TOGETHER; and all blessings dwell in him. He draws them from the head above, THE FIRST THREE SFIROT OF ZEIR ANPIN, and all the members of the body, CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD, AND YESOD OF ZEIR ANPIN, prepare to pass the blessings TO YESOD, and then YESOD turns into a river which flows from Eden. 784. HE ASKS OF THE MEANING OF \"from Eden (lit. 'delight').\" HE SAYS, When all the limbs are linked together in delight and desire from the abundance in the head above and from below, they all pour UPON YESOD their delight and desire, and it becomes a river which flows and comes out from Eden. WE SHOULD further EXPLAIN THAT the word \"from Eden\" MEANS that from supernal Chochmah called Eden, all flows and turns into a river, which pours down until it reaches the grade OF YESOD, and then all THE SFIROT OF ZEIR ANPIN are blessed, and all is one. "},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" 785. \"To the utmost bound (also: 'desires') of the everlasting (lit. 'world') hills\" is the passion for the two everlasting hills. What are they? The two females, one above, BINAH, and one below, THE NUKVA OF ZEIR ANPIN, each called 'world'. The desire of all the members of the body, ALL THE SFIROT OF ZEIR ANPIN, is for these two mothers. They desire to suck from the upper mother, BINAH, and desire to be attached to the lower mother, THE NUKVA. These desires of them all is the same, and therefore \"they shall be on the head of Yosef,\" WHO IS YESOD, who will receive them all as befits. 786. Happy are those who are called righteous, for only those who keep the grade of the sign of the holy covenant are so called. They are happy in this world and in the World to Come. They came out of the cave. Rabbi Shimon said: Let each of us discourse as we walk. 78. \"Binyamin is a ravenous wolf\" The first explanation for why Binyamin is called a wolf tells us that this was engraved upon the throne. The second explanation interprets it as a reference to the altar upon which he offered the flesh of sacrifice daily. The third explanation indicates that through sacrifices, Binyamin appeased the accusers, called \"wolf,\" in order that they would accuse Yisrael. The discussion then reveals the meaning of the verse, \"In the morning he shall devour the prey.\" We are told that in the morning, the offering causes pleasure. At this time only, Ad, of the supernal throne of Binah, consumes the sacrifice. We next learn that the smoke of the sacrifice rises and unites Zeir Anpin and the Female Principle. Wine is also poured below, thereby bringing joy to the wine above. The awakening below should be performed with fine flour in oil in order to effect the union. The first sacrifices of the day are offered entirely to God, Whom then confers blessings on the supernal armies. This unites Zeir Anpin and Malchut and connects the Upper and the Lower Worlds. Indeed, we're told, it is forbidden for a man to greet anyone in the morning before blessing God. The Relevance of this Passage The underlying meaning behind any sacrifice to The Creator concerns the sacrifice of our own immoral qualities that dwell deep within our nature. By meditating to uproot our negative traits, and acknowledging our jealousies, ego, and selfishness, the Light issuing through the words of these verses burns away our Evil Inclination, thus facilitating our spiritual evolution. 787. Rabbi Elazar opened the discussion with the following verse, \"Binyamin is a ravenous wolf.\" HE ASKS: Why is Binyamin called a wolf? HE ANSWERS: Because it was so engraved upon the throne, THE NUKVA, IN THE SHAPE OF A WOLF. For all the great and small livng creatures are imprinted UPON THE THRONE, as it is written \"both small and great beasts\" (Tehilim 104:25). The throne made by Solomon was also engraved in the same manner, after the pattern of the THRONE above. 788. Another explanation for \"a ravenous wolf\" is that the altar was in Binyamin's portion, and the altar is a wolf. If you say that Binyamin is a wolf, it is not so, the altar on his territory was the wolf, since it consumed flesh every day; NAMELY THE SACRIFICES OFFERED UPON IT. Binyamin used to feed it WITH SACRIFICES, because it was in his territory. It was as if he nourished and fed that wolf. \"RAVENOUS\" MEANS FEEDING, THE VERSE MAY READ 'BINYAMIN SHALL FEED THE WOLF,' THE ALTAR. Another explanation for \"a ravenous wolf\" is that 'he shall feed the wolf'. Who is the wolf? ANGELS sworn to enmity who are ready to accuse Yisrael from above. They are all appeased by the sacrifices, aroused with the arousal above. THUS BINYAMIN, IN WHOSE TERRITORY THE ALTAR LIES, FEEDS THE ACCUSERS CALLED WOLF, SO THAT THEY WILL NOT BRING ACCUSATION UPON YISRAEL. "},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" 789. \"In the morning he shall devour the prey (Heb. ad), and at night he shall divide the spoil\" HE ASKS: What is the meaning of: \"In the morning he shall devour the prey\"? HE REPLIES: In the morning, when Avraham, CHESED, stirs in the world, and it is time of goodwill, the offering causes stirring and pleasure. It rises to 'ad', the place of which it says \"and you shall return to (Heb. ad) Hashem your Elohim\" (Devarim 30:2), WHICH IS ZEIR ANPIN, FROM THE CHEST UPWARD. 790. \"In the morning\" refers to Avraham like we said: WHO IS CHESED, as it is written: \"And Avraham rose up early in the morning\" (Beresheet 22:3) when it is time of grace and no one else eats the sacrifice. Who would eat it? The place called Ad would. It is the supernal throne, CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET FROM THE CHEST OF ZEIR ANPIN UPWARD, THE THRONE OF BINAH, 'adey ad (forever)', FOR EATING IS UNITING AS WAS SAID BEFORE. 791. Ad eats in the morning, NAMELY WHEN CHESED OF ZEIR ANPIN HAS THE ASCENDANCY. Ad is above THE CHEST OF ZEIR ANPIN, A PLACE WHICH IS ALL CHASSADIM, as it is written: \"Trust in Hashem for ever (Heb. adey-ad)\" (Yeshayah 26:4). FROM THIS, WE UNDERSTAND THAT AD IS A VERY HIGH PLACE. In the morning, WHEN CHESED OF ZEIR ANPIN REIGNS, there is a sacrifice unto Hashem, WHEN THE NUKVA CALLED SACRIFICE IS UNITED WITH HASHEM; THEREFORE \"he shall devour ad (or: ad shall devour),\" THAT IS ZEIR ANPIN AND RIGHT, WHICH IS CHESED, SHALL, and no other GRADE. 792. HE EXPLAINS THE UNION WHICH IS BROUGHT ABOUT THROUGH THE SACRIFICE, SAYING the smoke OF THE SACRIFICE rises, THE AWAKENING FROM BELOW, love is aroused above and connects BETWEEN ZEIR ANPIN AND THE NUKVA, and they stand facing each other. The candle, THE NUKVA, is kindled and shines from the awakening below, TO WIT, IT RECEIVES ABUNDANCE FROM ZEIR ANPIN. The priest is stirred and the Levites praise with joy. The wine, OF THE LEFT SIDE AND GVURAH, is mingled with water, WHICH IS RIGHT AND CHESED. The wine illumines and brings joy, FOR WHEN GVUROT ARE CLOTHED IN CHASSADIM, THEY ARE CALLED 'GLADDENING WINE'. Therefore good wine should be poured from below, so as to gladden the other wine above. All then are aroused to connect the left with the right. 793. The bread of fine flour, which is Malchut, THE NUKVA, was roused by the stirring BELOW. THE NUKVA IS CALLED 'BREAD', ACCORDING TO THE SECRET MEANING OF THE VERSE: \"SAVE THE BREAD WHICH HE DID EAT\" (BERESHEET 39:6). She is taken by left and right, and attached to the body, NAMELY ZEIR ANPIN CALLED BODY. Then supernal oil is poured FROM ZEIR ANPIN and she receives it through the righteous, YESOD OF ZEIR ANPIN. Therefore, awakening below should be performed with fine flour in oil. All is attached together, and there is delight and pleasure in the unison, and the crowns, THE SFIROT OF THE NUKVA, receive that delight and pleasure of the unison. ZEIR ANPIN AND THE NUKVA are attached to each other; the moon, THE NUKVA, shines and joins the sun, and all settled delightedly. "},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" 794. This is the sacrifice unto Hashem, WHEN THE NUKVA IS BROUGHT UNTO HASHEM and to no one else. Therefore \"in the morning he shall devour the prey (Heb. ad),\" AD SHALL EAT IN THE MORNING, WHICH IS ZEIR ANPIN CALLED 'AD', and none other. THE VERSE TEACHES US that first Ad, ZEIR ANPIN, shall eat and be delighted in his union in the morning, WHEN CHASSADIM RULE, for the holy name should be the first to be blessed. Then will the others be blessed, AS IT SAYS, \"AND AT NIGHT HE SHALL DIVIDE THE SPOIL,\" AS WILL BE EXPLAINED. 795. This is why it is forbidden for a man to greet his neighbor in the morning before blessing the Holy One, blessed be He, who should be blessed first, as \"in the morning he shall devour ad\" (or: as shall devour) , WHICH IS ZEIR ANPIN. The others shall be blessed later; NAMELY \"at night he shall divide the spoil\" for the first sacrifices are offered entirely to the Holy One, blessed be He, and the stirring BELOW rises thither. Once he is blessed, he links by knots all the other supernal armies and confers blessings, each according to his worth. The worlds are sweetened and the upper and lower are blessed. 796. This is the secret of the verse, \"I have drunk my wine with my milk\" first. Then, dividing amongst them all, he says, \"Eat, O dear ones, and drink; drink deep, O loving companions\" (Shir Hashirim 5:1), thus conferring blessings upon them all and allotting each with his fitting share. Therefore, \"at night he shall divide the spoil\" for the holy name is blessed first and then imparts blessings amongst all the worlds. Do not say that the sacrifice is offered them nor to any other force, but all is offered to the Holy One, blessed be He, who bestows blessings and divides them to all the worlds. Therefore it is a sacrifice to Hashem, and to no other GRADE. 797. Rabbi Shimon said: You have spoken well, my son. There is another awakening brought about by the sacrifice, that draws and incites blessings so that all the worlds shall be blessed. But first there is the sacrifice unto Hashem, TO BRING THE NUKVA TO THE GRADE OF ZEIR ANPIN, and to no other. Now THAT THE UNISON WITH ZEIR ANPIN IS PERFORMED, \"shall you bring your offering\" (Vayikra 1:2), NAMELY so that the worlds will be connected together and the upper and lower shall be blessed. 79. \"And this is what their father spoke to them\" Rabbi Aba inquires why a passage of Scripture refers to the twelve tribes as \"All these,\" as opposed to \"These are the twelve tribes.\" The word \"All,\" we learn, signifies the mechanism by which the twelve tribes are connected to the source of all blessings, the world of Malchut. Moreover, it indicates the Lower World's connection to the Upper World. We are then told that the upper realm, called Zeir Anpin [Male], correlates to \"voice,\" whereas the physical dimension of Malchut [Female] equates to speech. Thus, male and female [Upper and Lower Worlds] are unified--just as voice and speech are unified when words are spoken, through the sacred text. \"That which (he) spoke.\" Next, we learn that all blessing issues from both the Male and Female principles, or the union of Zeir Anpin and Malchut. The Relevance of this Passage Here, the Upper and Lower Worlds are enjoined so that we may be the recipients of many blessings. This Light of blessing can flow freely if we do not allow negativity from the twelve signs to influence us. This effect is illustrated within this passage through the mystical power of the twelve tribes, which help us ascend over the twelve signs. "},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" 798. Rabbi Aba opened the discussion with the following verse: \"All these are the twelve tribes of Yisrael...\" HE ASKS: Why say \"All these?\" Should it not have been, 'These are the twelve tribes.' What means \"All\"? HE ANSWERS: It attaches the tribes to the place whence all blessings issue from, NAMELY THE NUKVA. IT THEREFORE SAYS, \"All THESE.\" Indeed there are \"twelve\" knots in the implements of the Matron, THE NUKVA, and she herself is attached to them, ACCORDING TO THE SECRET OF THE VERSE \"AND THE SEA WAS SET ABOVE UPON THEM\" (I MELACHIM 7:25). Hence it says, \"Twelve...and this is that which their father spoke to them, and blessed them,\" SINCE THE NUKVA CALLED THIS JOINED THE TWELVE TRIBES. For in this place speech dwells, AS ZEIR ANPIN IS CALLED VOICE AND THE NUKVA SPEECH. 799. We should explain the words: \"That which (he) spoke.\" There is a link here which connects the lower to the upper and the upper to the lower. HE EXPLAINS, The lower TO THE UPPER via the twelve tribes, ACCORDING TO THE VERSE, \"ALL THESE ARE THE TWELVE TRIBES OF YISRAEL\" AND THE UPPER TO THE LOWER BY this, THE NUKVA, which was attached to them FROM ABOVE. \"That which he spoke\" indicates the union between male and female, FOR THERE IS NO SPEECH WITHOUT VOICE, ZEIR ANPIN. It is attached to two sides from below, THE SECRET OF TWELVE, and from above, THE SECRET OF THIS. Finally, he connected them to the supreme place, male and female FROM THE CHEST UPWARD, WHERE THEY ARE TOGETHER, AND THE FEMALE IS INCLUDED WITHIN THE ZEIR ANPIN IN THE SECRET OF THE CHASSADIM IN HIM. Hence it says \"every one according to his blessing...\" HE ASKS: What is \"his blessing\"? HE ANSWERS: \"His blessing\" is his spouse, NAMELY THE NUKVA CALLED SPOUSE. \"Every one according to his blessing\" means they are both as one, AS ZEIR ANPIN AND THE NUKVA ARE INCLUDED TOGETHER. 800. He opened the discussion saying: \"Hashem shall bless you out of Tzion: and you shall see the good of Jerusalem\" (Tehilim 128:5). \"Hashem shall bless you out of Tzion,\" for from it all blessings come forth to water the garden, and it includes all blessings and passes to her. Then \"you shall see the good of Jerusalem,\" to show that all blessings issue from male and female. Similarly, \"Hashem bless you, and keep you\" (Bemidbar 6:24). \"Hashem bless you\" by the male, \"and keep you\" by the female, FOR KEEPING IS DRAWN FROM THE NUKVA. All this is one, for blessings issue from both into the world. Therefore \"every one according to his blessing he blessed them.\" 80. \"And Ya'akov made an end of commanding his sons\" Rabbi Yehuda explains that Ya'akov \"commanded\" his sons to be attached to the Shechinah, referencing the cave where Adam is buried, a place near the Garden of Eden. We're told that four couples are buried there: the three patriarchs, their wives, and Adam and Chavah. The Zohar explains that four are required to make up a Holy Chariot. The Creator, however, linked King David to the three patriarchs to form the chariot. So why, Rabbi Yehuda asks, does Adam rest in the cave with the three patriarchs while King David is buried elsewhere? We are then told that Adam was allotted 1000 years of life, but 70 of his years were transferred to King David to allow for his physical existence. Therefore, both King David and Adam signify Malchut, which represents Female. The three patriarchs embody Zeir Anpin, which is Male. Thus, Adam could be the fourth aspect, \"substituting\" for David, allowing the Upper Worlds [the patriarchs] and the Lower World [David or Adam] to be united. It is then explained that the cave where King David is buried corresponds to the male energy of the Upper World, whereas King David embodies the female energy of Malchut. Hence, spiritual balance between the supernal and mundane worlds is achieved through this burial arrangement. The Relevance of this Passage The symmetry and perfection of the world and its inhabitants, which were brought into existence by The Creator, exist in all of us. This force of balance and union, ignited by our reading, allows the Light of the Shechinah and holy blessings to filter into our world. Our bond to the great patriarchs, King David and root of our soul, Adam, is strengthened and enriched. "},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" 801. Rabbi Yehuda opened the discussion with the verse: \"And Ya'akov made an end of commanding his sons.\" HE ASKS: It says \"commanding,\" but wouldn't one expect 'blessing?' HE REPLIES: He commanded them to be attached to the Shechinah, and commanded them concerning the cave, which is close to the Garden of Eden, where Adam is buried. 802. Come and see: this place is called Kiryat Arba (lit. 'city of four') because four couples were buried there: Adam and Chavah, Avraham and Sarah, Yitzchak and Rivkah, and Ya'akov and Leah. There is a difficulty here. We learned that the patriarchs are a Holy Chariot, yet a Chariot consists of no less than four. We also learned that the Holy One, blessed be He, joined King David with THE PATRIARCHS, and they formed a complete Chariot OF FOUR. The meaning of: \"The stone which the builders rejected has become the head stone of the corner\" (Tehilim 118:21) is that King David joined them and formed with them a complete Chariot. David was then supposed to be buried with the patriarchs in Kiryat Arba. Why was he not buried with them? 803. HE REPLIES: A place was prepared for King David, Tzion, YESOD OF ZEIR ANPIN, with which to be united as one; and Adam was buried with the patriarchs. They were buried with him, since he was the first king, from whom kingdom was removed and transferred to King David. King David lived with Adam's days, for it was decreed that Adam should live a thousand years, but seventy were removed from him to form King David's life and he gave them to him. ADAM WAS THEREFORE CONSIDERED TO PERTAIN TO MALCHUT, AND HE COMPLEMENTED THE CHARIOT OF THE FATHERS TO A FOURSOME. OTHERWISE, how could the patriarchs rise TO HAVE A COMPLETE CHARIOT before the time of King David? OF NECESSITY DID ADAM COMPLEMENT THEM. DAVID WAS NOT BURIED WITH THEM, but merited a place worthy of him, WHICH IS TZION. Hence, he was not buried with the fathers. 804. Moreover, the patriarchs dwell in a male place, TO WIT, THEY ARE CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET OF ZEIR ANPIN, WHICH ARE MALES. David, WHO IS A CHARIOT TO MALCHUT, is in a female place. Hence the fathers were buried with their wives, and David was buried and attached to a male place, TZION, each as befits him. 81. \"And he expired and he was gathered unto his people\" Among the many mysteries expounded upon in this passage, we learn that Ya'akov never died, but rather \"expired,\" just as the sun expires every evening, leaving the moon to reflect its light. The intimate connection concerning the events that take place in Scripture, the characters that populate the Biblical stories, and the structure of the Upper World, are explored in detail by the Zohar. The underlying objective of this complex passage is to demonstrate how the male and female principles, Zeir Anpin and Malchut [the Nukva], are enjoined for the purpose filling all reality with the blessed Light of The Creator. The Zohar stresses the spiritual perfection of Ya'akov, whose existence positively influences all generations and unites the Lower and Upper Worlds. The Relevance of this Passage We are connected to the intricate structure of the supernal worlds and the processes by which the Lower and Upper worlds [Male and Female] are interlocked. This connection allows the Light of The Creator and the perfection of Ya'akov to freely flow into our lives, bringing blessing and removing the force of death from our midst. "},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" 805. \"He gathered up his feet into the bed\" because he dwelt in the place of the living, BEING A CHARIOT TO ZEIR ANPIN, THE TREE OF LIFE. Therefore, when he wanted to depart from the world he put his feet down upon the bed, THE SECRET OF THE NUKVA, and was gathered and gone from the world. TO WIT, HE WENT UP TO MAYIN NUKVIN (FEMALE WATERS) TO BE INCLUDED WITHIN THE UNION OF MALE AND FEMALE. Hence it says that he \"expired and was gathered to his people,\" BUT NOT THAT HE DIED, FOR HE ASCENDED TO BE PART OF THE SUPERNAL LIFE. 806. He opened the discussion saying: \"My soul longs, indeed, it faints for the courts of Hashem\" (Tehilim 84:2). A DIFFICULTY IS RAISED WHY HE DOES NOT LONG FOR THE HOUSE OF HASHEM, BUT TO HIS COURTS. HE SAYS, This has already been explained by the friends, yet come and behold: there are lower stories IN BRIYAH, YETZIRAH, AND ASIYAH and upper stories IN ATZILUT. There are no SOULS in the upper ones, FOR SOULS DWELL ONLY IN BRIYAH, YETZIRAH AND ASIYAH. The stories are the inner houses IN ATZILUT and outer houses IN BRIYAH, YETZIRAH AND ASIYAH. The outer houses are called the courts of Hashem, because they are filled with love and desire for the female. DAVID SAID: \"MY SOUL LONGS... FOR THE COURTS OF HASHEM\" BECAUSE SOULS HAVE NO HOLD HIGHER THAN BRIYAH, YETZIRAH AND ASIYAH, CALLED THE COURTS OF HASHEM. BUT WHEN BRIYAH, YETZIRAH AND ASIYAH RISE UP TO ATZILUT, THE SOULS OF THE RIGHTEOUS ASCEND WITH THEM. Come and behold: when the soul rises, all stirs, ALL THE HOSTS OF BRIYAH, YETZIRAH AND ASIYAH, AND THEY RISE to the Nukva, WHO IS united THROUGH THEIR RISING TO HER with a complete desire WITH ZEIR ANPIN, and is attached to him. 807. Ya'akov did not die and therefore it does not say so, only that he \"expired, and was gathered to his people.\" Look at the words \"he gathered up his feet into the bed,\" WHICH IS THE NUKVA. IT MEANS that the sun, YA'AKOV, was gathered to the moon, THE NUKVA. The sun does not die. It is merely gathered from the world and goes to the moon. 808. Come and see: When Ya'akov was gathered, the moon shone, and the desire of the Supernal Sun, ZEIR ANPIN, was awakened for her. For when the sun, YA'AKOV, arises, another sun is awakened, ZEIR ANPIN, and they cleave to each other, ZEIR ANPIN CLINGS TO THE NUKVA, and the moon, THE NUKVA, shines FROM ZEIR ANPIN. 809. Rabbi Shimon said: You have spoken well. We also learned that the upper beings, the world of the male, NAMELY BINAH, is linked to the lower, the world of the female, NUKVA OF ZEIR ANPIN, and the lower is linked to the upper. So they all resemble each other. "},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" 810. We have learned that there are two worlds, as it is written: \"from the world to the world\" (I Divrei Hayamim 16:36)-BINAH AND THE NUKVA. And though both are females, SINCE BINAH TOO IS A FEMALE, yet BINAH is established by the male, FOR IN GREATNESS SHE IS CONSIDERED A MALE, and THE NUKVA OF ZEIR ANPIN is established by a female. BINAH is called seven and THE NUKVA daughter of seven (Bat-Sheva). Both are mothers, BINAH is \"mother of children\" and THE NUKVA is the mother of Solomon, as it is written: \"Go forth, O daughters of Tzion, and behold King Solomon with the crown with which his mother crowned him\" (Shir Hashirim 2:11). King Solomon is the king that the peace (Heb. shalom) is his, NAMELY ZEIR ANPIN, WHOSE MOTHER, BINAH IS THE MOTHER OF CHILDREN. The mother of Solomon, as it is written: \"Bat-Sheva the mother of Solomon\" (I Melachim 1:11) IS THE NUKVA, FOR HERE IT DOES NOT SAY \"THE KING SOLOMON.\" 811. It is written: \"And Solomon's Wisdom excelled\" (I Melachim 5:10). Solomon's Wisdom is Solomon's mother, NAMELY THE NUKVA, in accordance with the verse: \"The words of King Lemu'el, the prophecy, that his mother taught him\" (Mishlei 31:1). \"The words of King Lemu'el\": This verse is not clear, FOR WE DO NOT KNOW WHO KING LEMU'EL IS. But \"the words of King Lemu'el\" means the words which were spoken to El, who is king. Who is he? The one of whom it says \"and El who has indignation every day\" (Tehilim 7:11) and \"and El Shadai\" NAMELY THE NUKVA, as has been explained. 812. Lemu'el, as in the verse \"to my mouth (Heb. lemo fi)\" (Iyov 40:4) MEANS HERE \"TO (LIT. 'EL') EL. King Lemu'el is Bat-Sheva, THE NUKVA; \"the prophecy, that his mother taught him,\" when he appeared before him in Givon in the vision of the night, IS \"AND IF YOU WILL WALK BEFORE ME, AS DAVID YOUR FATHER WALKED\" (I MELACHIM 9:4). 813. Come and see: Ya'akov was gathered to the moon, THE NUKVA, BY RAISING MAYIN NUKVIN (FEMALE WATERS) TO ZEIR AND NUKVA WHEN HE PASSED AWAY, thus producing fruits by her, BY BRINGING UNION BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE IN GREATNESS, WHICH PRODUCES SOULS CALLED THE FRUITS OF MALE AND FEMALE. There is no generation in the world without Ya'akov's fruit, THE SOULS WHICH ARE BORN OF THE MATING OF MALE AND FEMALE IN GREATNESS, WHICH YA'AKOV BROUGHT BY RAISING MAYIN NUKVIN. For he caused stirring above, A UNION BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE as it says, \"he gathered his feet into the bed,\" the bed of Ya'akov BEING THE NUKVA. 814. Happy is the portion of Ya'akov who was made perfect above and below, as it is written: \"Fear you not, O Ya'akov My servant, says Hashem: for I am with you\" (Yirmeyah 46:28), not 'you are with me' but \"I am with you.\" FOR HE WAS MADE PERFECT BELOW TOO THROUGH THE SHECHINAH. 82. \"The mourning of Egypt\" Rabbi Yitzchak sheds light on the term, \"the mourning of Egypt.\" We are told that when Ya'akov resided in Egypt, \"the land was blessed, waters flowed and famine ceased.\" For this reason, scripture reads, \"the mourning of Egypt\" and not \"the mourning of Yisrael [Ya'akov].\" Next, the significance of the word \"utter\" is examined in a particular verse of Torah. Yemalel, the Hebrew word for \"utter,\" denotes the concept of severance and cutting. In the context of verse quoted by the Zohar, the word \"utter\" signifies the annulment and cancellation of judgments that emanate from the Sfirah of Gvurah, the Left Column force of Judgment. Thereafter, we discover that the Egyptians were adept in the black arts and sorcery. However, while Ya'akov lived in this physical world, no nation, no matter how well versed in magic, could rule over Yisrael. Moreover, upon Ya'akov's passing from this physical plane, the Egyptians realized that Judgment would still rain down upon them; hence the term, \"the mourning of Egypt.\" Rabbi Shimon then reveals that upon his merit, he can protect those who are destined for death as a result of their wicked deeds, specifically, two "},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":" Roman informers. He chooses not to. The Relevance of this Passage Our connection to Ya'akov helps ensure that Light flows into our lives even during times of great Judgment and negativity. The additional spiritual influences arising herein, help annul Judgments that are handed down against us in the supernal courts. Finally, the exalted Light of the author of the Zohar, Rabbi Shimon, protects us from the Angel of Death, even though we might not merit exoneration. 815. Rabbi Yitzchak opened the discussion with the verse: \"And they came to the threshing floor of Atad,\" \"And when the inhabitants of the land, the Cna'anite, saw the mourning at the floor of Atad\" (Beresheet 50:10-11). We have to examine these verses. Why should it concern us that they came to the threshing floor of Atad, and why was it named \"the mourning of Egypt.\" It should have been named 'the mourning of Yisrael,' so why Egypt? 816. HE ANSWERS: So they said that as long as Ya'akov dwelt in Egypt, the land was blessed for his sake, and the Nile used to rise and water the land. Moreover, the famine ceased due to Ya'akov. Hence the Egyptians mourned, and the mourning was named after them. 817. He opened the discussion saying: \"Who can utter the mighty acts (Heb. Gvurot) of Hashem? who can declare all His praise?\" (Tehilim 106:2). This verse has been explained, yet why say \"utter\" instead of the usual \"speak.\" If, you say scripture is wont TO USE SYNONYMS FOR THE BEAUTY OF STYLE, it is not so. But all verses WITH SYNONYMS convey a specific meaning. Here, too, there is a specific meaning in \"utter (Heb. yemalel),\" as in the verse \"pluck the ears (Heb. melilot)\" (Devarim. 23:26), WHICH IS DERIVED FROM CUTTING AND SEVERANCE. \"The Gvurot of Hashem\" are numerous, since all verdicts come from thence, FROM THE GVUROT OF HASHEM, THE LEFT COLUMN. SCRIPTURE therefore SAYS: \"WHO CAN UTTER GVUROT OF HASHEM,\" WHICH MEANS who will be able to cancel and annul one decree of the mighty acts performed by the Holy One, blessed be He. 818. We should also add that 'utter' and 'speak' are the same and that UTTER MEANS speak. How numerous are the mighty acts, the prosecutors, the advocates and the executioners of those who break the Law. Speech cannot enumerate them, HENCE THE VERSE SAYS, \"WHO CAN UTTER THE MIGHTY ACTS OF HASHEM.\" 819. THE MIGHTY ACTS OF HASHEM are made known through recital, which contains the secret of wisdom, AND THROUGH WISDOM THEY CAN BE KNOWN. For through utterance and speech, there is no uttering and knowing them, only through recital, as it is written: \"One generation shall praise your works to another, and shall declare (recite) your mighty acts\" (Tehilim 145:4), through which secret they are made known; NAMELY BY RECITAL, THE SECRET OF WISDOM. But of your Gvurah, the lower Gvurah WITHIN THE NUKVA, they shall talk, FOR IT CAN BE SPOKEN OF, as it is written: \"and talk of your Gvurah\" (Ibid. 11). 820. \"Who can declare all His praise?\" For many judgments are seen by it and are united in praise, and several hosts join in praise, as it is written: \"Is there any number to His armies\" (Iyov 25:3). Hence \"who can declare all His praise?\" "},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" 821. Come and see: All the Egyptians were wise, on the side of Gvurah, NAMELY THE LEFT COLUMN, whence legions and hosts come forth and grades that reach the lower grades. The Egyptians, who were sorcerers, had knowledge of them, and knew of the undisclosed secrets in the world. They saw that as long as Ya'akov lived in this world, no nation could rule over his children, yet they knew that they would enslave Yisrael for a long period. 822. When Ya'akov died they rejoiced THAT NOW THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ENSLAVE YISRAEL. They looked to see what would become of it and saw the threshing floor of Atad, the prevailing punishment, as 'Atad' has the same numerical value as 'hand', mentioned in the verse: \"And Yisrael saw that great work (lit. 'hand') which Hashem did upon Egypt\" (Shemot 14:31). When they came to this place, they saw the mighty acts coming from Atad UPON THEM, NAMELY THE TEN PLAGUES OF EGYPT AND THE PARTING OF THE RED SEA. Why is it called Atad (thorn-bush)? As the thorns grow on both sides of the thorn-bush, so do the fingers of the hand, each containing numerous Gvurot, punishments and decrees. Hence \"they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation...so that the name of it was called the mourning of the Egyptians.\" This was truly a grievous mourning for the Egyptians, and no one else. 823. When Rabbi Shimon explained the verses, they went out of the cave WHERE THEY SAT. He said: I see that today a house in town will collapse, and two Roman informers will die there. If I will be in town, the house will not fall, FOR MY MERIT WILL PROTECT THEM. They returned to the cave, FOR HE DID NOT WISH TO RETURN TO HIS TOWN, AND THAT HIS MERIT WILL PROTECT THEM. SO THE HOUSE SHOULD FALL, AND THE INFORMERS BE KILLED. They sat down. 83. \"Lift up your voice, O daughter of Galim\" Rabbi Shimon discusses the importance of \"praising The Creator\" [uttering holy words that ignite awesome spiritual forces] with a pleasant voice. We learn that the \"daughter of Galim (lit. 'waves')\" refers to Malchut, our physical world, the fourth and completing aspect to the three patriarchs who represent the Upper World dimension called Zeir Anpin. We then discover that the term \"daughter of the waves\" signifies the abundance of Light that flows from Binah into Malchut. This energy embodies the Light of the blissful world to come. It is explained that Malchut was born from the side of judgment, and thus, has the power to break and triumph over the dark side. Malchut is called \"poor,\" for like the moon, for she has no Light of her own. However, when our prayers and the singing from worlds above unite Male and Female, Malchut [the moon] shines with abundance and wholeness. Finally, the Zohar reveals that King David's spiritual endeavors elevated the world [moon] from spiritual poverty into wealth. Thus, when David left this world, Solomon assumed spiritual command over a world that was now spiritually whole. The Relevance of this Passage The spiritual Light that shines through these sacred verses sweetens our prayers with pleasantness and song so that they will be heard and well received above. The Light that awaits us in the world to come is ignited and its warm rays illuminate the here and now. Our connection to King David helps unite our body and soul and the cosmic male and female principles, bringing wholeness and radiance to our existence. "},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" 824. Rabbi Shimon opened the discussion saying: \"Lift up your voice, O daughter of galim (lit. 'waves')...\" (Yeshayah 10:30). \"Lift up your voice\" was addressed to the Congregation of Yisrael, which praises the Holy One, blessed be He, with a singing voice. Hence IT WAS SAID TO HER, \"Lift up your voice.\" From this, we learn that whoever wishes to praise the Holy One, blessed be He, aloud, should have a pleasant voice, which would be agreeable to the listeners. Otherwise, he should not raise his voice. 825. Come and see: It is written of the Levites, who come of the side OF SINGING AND PRAISING: \"And from the age of fifty years they shall go out of the ranks of the service\" (Bemidbar 8:25). What is the reason thereof? IN OLD AGE, the voice fails, and is not agreeable to the ear, as THE VOICE OF his companions. He therefore retires from the high ranks of service, whose service is to play and to glorify the holy name as befits. 826. There are legions above and legions below, which praise the holy name and sing to it. Since THE SINGERS BELOW ARE THE LIKENESS OF THE SINGERS ABOVE, \"they shall go out of the ranks of the service.\" Since the Congregation of Yisrael praises the Holy One, blessed be He, scripture says \"Lift up your voice, O daughter of galim,\" NAMELY the daughter of the patriarchs, FOR THE NUKVA IS A FOURTH TO THE FATHERS, WHO ARE CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET. SHE IS THEN THE DAUGHTER OF THE FATHERS. 827. \"Daughter of the waves\" is also the World to Come, BINAH, which is called waves, since everything is found in it in heaps, LIKE THE WAVES IN THE OCEAN whence they come forth unto all FACES AND WORLDS. We can also interpret \"daughter of the waves\" as in the words \"a fountain (Heb. gal) sealed\" (Shir Hashirim 4:12), THE NUKVA'S MOCHIN BEING CALLED GAL, DERIVED FROM 'REVEAL (HEB. GILUY)'. All the waves and springs come out from the World to Come, BINAH, and the Congregation of Yisrael, WHICH IS THE NUKVA, THE RECIPIENT OF BINAH, is called the daughter of the waves (Heb. galim). 828. Come and see: this verse is difficult. First it says, \"Lift up your voice,\" and then \"hearken.\" Why should she then lift up her voice, when she is asked to listen, AS THERE IS NO NEED TO RAISE THE VOICE WHILE LISTENING? HE ANSWERS: It says, \"Lift up your voice\" to sing and praise; TO WIT, RAISING THE VOICE IS FOR THE SAKE OF THE BEAUTY OF SONG, NOT TO SPEAK. Come and see: when the children of Yisrael start to sing and praise the Holy One, blessed be He, it says \"hearken.\" Why? Because they praise the Holy One, blessed be He, for her sake, FOR THE SAKE OF THE NUKVA. Therefore it is written: \"Lift up your voice\" and \"hearken.\" THE FORMER ALLUDES TO YISRAEL AND THE LATTER TO THE NUKVA, FOR WHICH SAKE THEY SING AND PRAISE.

'lioness')\": HE ASKS ABOUT THE MEANING OF \"HEARKEN LAYSHAH\" (SHIR HASHIRIM 4:12) AND SAYS, Since THE NUKVA comes from the side of Gvurah, SHE IS CALLED A LIONESS. As \"a lion which is strongest among beasts\" (Mishlei 30:30), so is the lioness strong and breaks the power and strength OF THE OTHER SIDE. \"O poor Anatot\" (Yeshayah 10:30), WHY IS THE NUKVA SO CALLED? Because she is the mirror which does not shine, and is indeed poor, for the moon, THE NUKVA, has no light except what is given her by the sun. 830. Anatot (poverty) is a village, where poor priests beg from door to door. But no one cares since all its inhabitants are scorned by the people, and their houses are more empty than THE HOUSE OF the people, except for what they are given, being the poorest of the poor. The moon is called Anatot too, for she has no light of her own, and shines only when the sun joins her. 831. Come and see: It is written, \"And to Evyatar the priest the king said: 'Get you to Anatot, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death'\" (I Melachim 2:26). HE ASKS: Was he worthy of death because Adoniyahu summoned him TO HIS FEAST? HE ANSWERS: Because he came from a poor place, and the moon was attached to him, the poor Anatot. 832. You may say, SINCE IT IS WRITTEN, \"Because you have been afflicted in all my father's afflictions\" (Ibid.), it was due TO HIS POVERTY then that he did not kill him, WHY THEN IS HE CALLED \"WORTHY OF DEATH\"? HE REPLIES: Since Evyatar was poor, David took recognition of him before he became king, when Shaul pursued him, for he acted like a poor man, and Evyatar too. ALSO WHEN HE BECAME KING, THE KINGDOM WAS NOT YET WHOLE. But when Solomon reigned, the moon, THE NUKVA, attained perfection. He rejoiced since all was his. Evyatar therefore could not join him. 833. Assuredly, the field of Anatot contains this secret OF THE NUKVA UNDER THE REIGN OF THE LEFT. Yirmeyah bought THE FIELD OF ANATOT to attain the supernal secret. Come and see: when the moon, THE NUKVA, reigns, NAMELY IN FULL ILLUMINATION, she is called 'an apple field.' When she is poor, she is called 'the field of Anatot.' For this reason, the singing above brings her abundance and wholeness, BY BRINGING ABOUT THE UNION BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE. 834. David strove all his days to perfect her by players who sang and praised her, FOR THROUGH THIS THE NUKVA ATTAINS PERFECTION. When David departed from the world, he left her whole and Solomon received her plentiful and whole. For the moon came out of poverty into wealth, through which he reigned over all the kings of the land.

Moreover, we're told that the merciful Light of Zeir Anpin removes judgment from Malchut, thereby increasing gold. Such was the spiritual landscape during the reign of King Solomon. Because David had already perfected Malchut, Solomon's mystical power was directed at arousing wealth, love, and Light. However, we learn that Solomon miscalculates the spiritual processes taking place in the Upper Worlds and rejects the Right Column energy of mercy [silver]. This action darkens the moon, allowing judgment to impact our world, hence the phrase, \"Silver was not accounted for anything\" Moreover, because sacrifices are no longer offered in the temple, Judgment occurs each day of our lives. The Zohar then explains that the prayers of man can perfect the Upper and Lower World and remove the Left Column force of judgment. The Relevance of this Passage When we extend mercy to our friends and enemies, the Light of Zeir Anpin illuminates our own lives with mercy, transmuting judgments set against us into praise. When mercy is not part of our consciousness, Judgment is allowed to befall us every day. Hence, this passage awakens mercy within us, so that we may bestow it upon others. Our connection to these words helps perfect the Upper and Lower Worlds, whose union also removes judgment from own lives. 835. For this reason, \"silver was not accounted for anything in the days of Solomon\" (I Melachim 10:21), but all was made of gold, and gold increased. At that time, it says, \"And he had dust of gold\" (Iyov 28:6), since the sun, ZEIR ANPIN, looked upon the upper dust, THE NUKVA, and through its strength, it turned the dust into gold. 836. Come and see: where the dust of the earth turns into gold on the mountains, where the sunlight is strong everything turns into gold. And were it not for the wild livng creatures which roamed there, people would not have been poor, because the power of the sun increases gold. 837. Hence in the days of Solomon, \"silver was not accounted for anything,\" for the strength of the sun was upon the dust and turned it into gold. Also, the dust is of the side of judgment, WHICH IS LEFT WITHOUT RIGHT, NOT ILLUMINATING, and when the sun, ZEIR ANPIN, looked upon it, NAMELY POURED CHASSADIM UPON IT, it removed the strength OF JUDGMENT FROM IT, and gold increased. When Solomon saw this, he praised it by saying: \"All was of the dust\" (Kohelet 3:20). 838. Hence Solomon had no need of playing like David, SINCE THE NUKVA WAS ALREADY MADE PERFECT, but he sang SHIR HASHIRIM, which is love and wealth, light and love, for all the songs of the world were in SOLOMON'S SONG, who recited the song of the Matron, the NUKVA, when she sat upon her throne facing the King. 839. It is written: \"And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem like stones\" (I Melachim 10:27). Because all was made of gold and the dust, THE NUKVA, was linked to the left on the side of love, NAMELY LOVER'S LOVE, THE LOVE OF THE LEFT, as it is written: \"His left hand is under my head\" (Shir Hashirim 2:6). The sun, ZEIR ANPIN, cleaved to her, and did not part. "},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" 840. Solomon made a mistake when he saw the moon attached to the sun, the right OF ZEIR ANPIN embracing her WITH CHASSADIM and the left OF ZEIR ANPIN under her head WITH THE ILLUMINATION OF CHOCHMAH. THE LEFT BECAME HER HEAD. As RIGHT AND LEFT were attached to each other, AND CHOCHMAH ON THE LEFT WAS ALREADY CLOTHED WITH THE RIGHT, he said: Now that they are linked together, what need is there for the right seeing that the function of the right, CHASSADIM, was to draw near ZEIR ANPIN AND THE NUKVA, SO THAT CHOCHMAH WITHIN THE NUKVA SHALL BE CLOTHED IN CHASSADIM OF ZEIR ANPIN? Now that they are together, there is no more need OF THE RIGHT, CHASSADIM. Straightaway \"silver was not accounted for anything,\" FOR HE REJECTED THE SILVER, WHICH IS RIGHT, AS EXPLAINED. 841. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: You have rejected the right, WHICH IS CHESED. Upon your life, you shall yet need kindness (Chesed) from people, but you shall not be offered any. Immediately the sun, ZEIR ANPIN, declined from opposite the moon, THE NUKVA, and she began to darken. Solomon went begging, saying 'I am Kohelet,' but none did any kindness by him. Why? Because he rejected the right, CHESED, and did not consider it, as it says, \"Silver was not accounted for anything in the days of Solomon.\" 842. Hence, the more one praises the Holy One, blessed be He, THE RIGHT, peace abounds above. SCRIPTURE therefore SAYS, \"Hearken Laysha,\" WHICH IS THE NUKVA WHEN SEPARATED FROM THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE, THE RIGHT. It is written: \"The old lion (Heb. layish) perishes for lack of prey\" (Iyov 4:11). Laysha is the feminine of layish, as chok (law) and chukat (ordinance). THEY HAVE THE SAME MEANING, AS DO LAYISH AND LAYSHA. \"Perishes (Heb. oved)\": As in \"who were lost (Heb. ovdim)\" (Yeshayah 27:13), MEANS THAT IT IS LOST. \"For lack of prey,\" since THE NUKVA demands FROM ZEIR ANPIN to give her, as it says, \"She rises also while it is yet night, and gives food (prey) to her household\" (Mishlei 31:15). 843. \"And the lion's whelps are scattered abroad\" (Iyov 4:11), for all the armies, NAMELY THE ANGELS WHO ISSUE FROM HER, come together as one when she gives them prey and feed together. But when she has no prey, on account of the exile, \"the lion's whelps are scattered abroad\" and her armies go different ways and roads to find a place to execute judgments. So, when sacrifices are offered, everybody is in order, and they come together like we said. Now, IN TIME OF EXILE, when sacrifice is not offered, surely \"the lion's whelps are scattered abroad.\" Therefore, not a day passes without judgment, since the upper and lower are not aroused by supreme perfection. "},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" 844. Come and see: now in the time of exile man's prayer causes perfection above and below, and the upper and lower are blessed by the blessing of the Holy One, blessed be He. Hence, Yisrael's prayer causes the worlds to be blessed. Whoever blesses the Holy One, blessed be He, shall be blessed, and whoever does not bless the Holy One, blessed be He, is not blessed, as it is written: \"For them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed\" (I Shmuel 2:30). 85. The cup of blessing Rav Hamnuna Saba expounds upon the significance of a wine cup, the table, and the blessings made over the wine. The sage equates the cup to the receptive nature of Malchut and the wine to the supernal blessings that light our world. It is explained that both hands are used to receive the cup, signifying the Right and Left Columns which are required to create a circuit of spiritual energy. We're told that one should also bless the table to ensure sustenance, signified by the bread and wine that sit upon it. The Relevance of this Passage The tremendous Light that is awakened and drawn to this world through the blessing of wine is summoned forth, bringing us Light, balance, and sustenance. 845. Rav Hamnuna Saba (the elder) gave his cup of blessing to no one, but hastened to receive it with both hands and say the blessing. We have said that it should be received by both right and left, and though others have explained it differently, we agree with it. But the secret thereof is that for a cup of blessing we need a cup, as it is written \"I will raise the cup of salvation\" (Tehilim 116:13), NAMELY THE CUP CALLED THE NUKVA. By means of this cup blessings are drawn from the salvations above, AND THE CUP, THE NUKVA, receives and gathers them to it. There the supernal wine is preserved, THE ILLUMINATION OF THE LEFT FROM BINAH, and gathered in the cup, hence we need to bless it with both right and left; and the wine which is gathered in the cup will be blessed together, THAT IS, THE WINE WHICH IS THE ILLUMINATION OF THE LEFT FROM BINAH, TOGETHER WITH THE CUP, BEING THE NUKVA. We should also bless the table, THE NUKVA, that it will not be without both bread and wine. 846. Come and see: the Congregation of Yisrael, THE NUKVA, is called a cup of blessing. Since it is a cup of blessing, we need both the right and left hands to receive it, for the cup is given by the right and left hands, CHASSADIM AND CHOCHMAH, AS HAS BEEN EXPLAINED. It should be filled with wine, because of the wine of the Torah, THE SECRET OF THE ILLUMINATION OF THE LEFT, which comes from the World to Come, BINAH. "},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" 847. Come and see supernal things have been revealed here concerning the cup of blessing, while we stayed in the cave; here was revealed the secret of the Holy Chariot, CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, AND MALCHUT. For the cup of blessing should be received with both right and left, which are north and south, CHESED AND GVURAH, and the cup of blessings receives its blessing from them. What is this cup of blessing? It is \"his litter, that of Solomon\" (Shir Hashirim 3: 7), NAMELY MALCHUT, which should be placed between north and south, CHESED AND GVURAH, but CLOSER to the right. The body OF HE WHO BLESSES, TIFERET, should be prepared with them, and one should fix his eyes upon the cup and bless it with four blessings, since it says, \"The eyes of Hashem your Elohim are always upon it\" (Devarim 11:12). Thus the secret of faith is found within the cup of blessing; NAMELY north and south, east and west, CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, AND MALCHUT. Here is a Holy Chariot worthy of it. 848. There is bread upon the table, so that the lower bread, THE NUKVA, will be blessed, and the bread of poverty, THE NUKVA WHEN WITHOUT CHASSADIM, will be blessed and become millet bread WHEN HER CHOCHMAH IS CLOTHED IN CHASSADIM, AND SHE IS CALLED MILLET BREAD, as has been explained. The Congregation of Yisrael, THE NUKVA, is thus blessed above by the four winds of the world, CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, AND MALCHUT, and above and below, NETZACH AND HOD. The cup of blessing brings the union between King David, THE NUKVA ABOVE THE CHEST, with the patriarchs, CHESED, GVURAH, AND TIFERET, WHENCE CHOCHMAH TAKES. And it is blessed below BY NETZACH HOD YESOD, AND THUS HAS CHASSADIM AS WELL, so that man's table be blessed that there will always be bread upon it. 849. They all rose and kissed his hands and said: Blessed be the merciful One who brought us here to hear these words. They came out of the cave and went. When they reached the town, they saw dead men, upon whom a house fell. They sat and saw people who mourned those who died along with the Roman, FOR THE HOUSE COLLAPSED UPON JEWS AND GENTILES ALIKE. 86. \"The threshing floor of Atad\" Rabbi Shimon discusses the metaphor concerning the transference of earthly and spiritual power from Egypt to Yisrael. Next, we learn that Ya'akov's soul was the brightest since the Creation of the world. When Ya'akov departs this world from within the land of Egypt, which represents a domain of negativity, it is free from any influences issuing from the Other Side, and directly ascends to its proper place in the heavens. The Relevance of this Passage The ability to triumph over our Evil Inclinations [Egypt] and to transfer control and power to the will of our soul [Yisrael], is the great gift bestowed upon readers of this section. This action sets us on a course for greater spiritual growth, ensuring a lofty place in the world to come and increased fulfillment in the here and now. 850. Rabbi Shimon opened the discussion saying: \"And they came to the threshing floor of Atad\" (Beresheet 50:10). HE ASKS: What is the threshing floor of Atad? HE ANSWERS: It is an allusion to the dominion of Egypt, which is removed. The threshing floor of Atad is the dominion of Egypt which passes to give way to the dominion of Yisrael. For they saw a threshing floor, WHICH ALLUDES TO THE REIGN OF YISRAEL, like in \"having put on their robes, in a threshing floor\" (I Melachim 22:10). Therefore \"they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation.\" "},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" 851. \"So that the name of it was called the mourning of the Egyptians\": Assuredly the Egyptians MOURNED FOR THEIR DOMINION WHICH PASSED, but here also the weeping was not for Jews, though there were Jews among the dead. Had they been good Jews, they would not have been killed. But having died, the Holy One, blessed be He, pardons their sins. 852. Rabbi Shimon said, Come and behold: though Ya'akov yielded his soul in Egypt, it did not depart under the dominion of the other, NAMELY THE OTHER SIDE. Why? Because, as we learned, there has not been a bed more whole than Ya'akov's bed since the Creation of the world, FOR ALL HIS SONS WERE PROPER. As soon as he departed from the world, his soul joined its place, as has already been explained. 87. The embalming of Ya'akov The Zohar reveals the luminous power and influence of Ya'akov by recounting how the scents of the Garden of Eden and candlelight radiate in a cave during his presence. Next, we learn that the souls of the righteous pass through the cave of the patriarchs to behold the spiritual deeds and Light they left behind. The process for embalming Kings is then expounded upon by Rabbi Aba and we learn that Ya'akov was embalmed to preserve both his body and soul so that he can join the Supernal Ark [Malchut]. Finally, it is revealed that Yosef is the chariot for Zeir Anpin, bridging Malchut with the Upper World. Hence, his keeping the covenant is deemed to have been accomplished in both worlds. This secret is alluded to by the two yuds ?? in the word Vayisem (Eng: 'and he was put'). When Yosef left this world from the land of Egypt, it is said that he was put into two arks, or coffins. This means that he avoided the clutches of the Other Side and connected directly to the Shechinah [the upper Ark]. The Relevance of this Passage If we read this passage with a contrite heart and soul, we can ignite the righteousness and spiritual power of Ya'akov and Yosef to help us rise above negativity in life [Egypt]. We are inspired to recognize the value of keeping the covenant, which ensures a connection to the Light of the Shechinah in this world and in the world to come. 853. Come and behold: When Ya'akov entered the cave, all the perfumes of the Garden of Eden filled it. The cave was alight, for a candle burned THERE. When the patriarchs came to Ya'akov in Egypt to be with him, the candlelight was gone FROM THE CAVE. When Ya'akov came in to the cave, the candle returned. The cave was then perfected in all its needs. 854. Never has the cave received any other man, and never will it. The souls of the righteous pass AFTER THEIR DEMISE before THE FATHERS inside the cave, so that they will awake and behold the seed they left in the world, and rejoice before the Holy One, blessed be He. "},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" 855. Rabbi Aba said: What was the embalming of Ya'akov like? He said to him: Go and ask a physician. Come and see: it is written: \"And Yosef commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Yisrael.\" Could you possibly think that he was embalmed like other people? If you say that it was done due to the voyage, FOR THEY HAD TO PRESERVE HIM, it says, \"So Yosef died... and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt\" (Beresheet 50:26). He was not taken away, but buried there, yet \"they embalmed him.\" 856. It is the custom to embalm kings, in order to preserve the body FROM ROTTING. They are embalmed with anointing oil, superior to any other oil, mixed with spices. The good oil is absorbed in the body day after day for forty days, as it is written: \"And forty days were fulfilled for him: for so are fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed.\" After this procedure, the body is preserved for many days. 857. For the land of Cna'an and the land of Egypt consume and corrupt the body in a shorter time than other countries, and this is done in order to preserve the body. The embalming is both for the internal part of the body and the exterior. The oil is put on the navel, and it penetrates the inner part of the body, absorbed in the entrails and preserves it for a long time. 858. Ya'akov had need of the body and so it is appropriate: for he is the body of the fathers, AS HIS FATHERS, CHESED AND GVURAH, ARE THE TWO ARMS AND HE IS TIFERET, THE BODY. Both his body and soul endured. Yosef, too, resembles the body, FOR HE IS THE COVENANT, AND THE COVENANT AND THE BODY ARE CONSIDERED THE SAME. He was preserved in both body and soul: his body, as it is written: \"And they embalmed him\" and his soul, as it is written: \"And he was put in a coffin (ark) in Egypt,\" WHICH MEANS THAT HIS SOUL JOINED THE SUPERNAL ARK, WHICH IS THE NUKVA. 859. We have learned why \"VAYISEM (ENG. 'AND HE WAS PUT')\" is spelt with two letters Yud. Yosef kept the covenant below and he kept the covenant above, BEING A CHARIOT TO ZEIR ANPIN. Therefore, when he passed away from the world, he was put in two arks (coffins), the ark above and the ark below. What is the 'ark above'? It is described by the words, \"Behold, the ark of the covenant of (is) the master of all the earth\" (Yehoshua 2:11). For the upper ark, THE SHECHINAH, is called 'the ark of the covenant'. It will be inherited only by him who keeps the covenant. Since Yosef kept the covenant, he was put in two arks. 88. \"And he was put in a coffin in Egypt\" The Zohar expands upon the wisdom concealed inside the verse \"And he was put in a coffin (also: 'ark') in Egypt.\" Egypt, we're told, is the land of "},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" the Other Side, and though one may leave the world from this negative, foreign soil, the soul will merge with the Shechinah, as Yosef did, if it is righteous. The Relevance of this Passage The strength to rise above of the negativity and influence of our Evil Inclination [Egypt] is ignited, so that we may connect to the protective and nurturing Light of the Shechinah now, and in the world to come. 860. \"And he was put in a coffin (also: 'ark') in Egypt.\" From this verse, we learn yet another secret. Though his soul departed in a foreign soil OF THE OTHER SIDE, it joined the Shechinah and \"he was put in an ark,\" IN THE ARK above and IN THE ARK below. For he was righteous, and every righteous man inherits the Holy, Supernal Land, THE SHECHINAH, as it says, \"Your people also shall be righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever; they shall be the branch of my planting, the work of My hands, that I may be glorified\" (Yeshayah 60:21). Blessed be Hashem for ever and ever, Amen and Amen. The end of the book of Beresheet "}]
