[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Prose Edda of Snorri Sturlson Translated by Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur [1916] The Prose Edda is a text on Old Norse Poe tics, written about 1200 by the Norwegian poet and politican Snorri Sturlson, who also wrote the Heimskringla. The Prose Edda contains a wide variety of lore which a Skald (poet) of the time would need to know. The text is of interest to modern readers b ecause it contains consistent na rratives of many of the plot lines of Norse mythology. Although Snorri was a Christian, he treate d the ancient Pagan mythology with great respect. To this end, Sno rri created a quasi-hist orical backstory for the Norse Gods. Hence the Prose Edda is of in terest because it contains one of the first attempts to devise a rational explanation for mythological and legendary events. It is also notable because it contains fr agments of a number of manusripts which Snorri had access to, but which are now lost.

No t less than the rest of Europe, Scandinavia shared in the bitter conflict between the law of the spirit and the law of the members. The North, like England and the Continent, felt th e religious fervor of the Crusades, passed from potential anarchy into union and nationa l consciousness, experienced a literary and spiritual revival, and suffered the fury of pe rsecution and of fratricidal war. No greater error could be committed than to think of th e Northern lands as cut off by barriers of distance, tongue, and custom from the heart of the Contin ent, and in consequence as countries where men's thoughts and deeds were more unrestrained and uncivilized. Even as England, France, and Germany acted and reacted upon one another in politics, in social growth, in art, and in literature, so all three acted upon Scandinavia, and felt the reaction of her influence. Nearly thirty years before S norri's birth, the Danish kingdom had been the plaything of a German prince, Henry the Lion, who set up or pulled down her rulers as he saw fit; and during Snorri's boyhood, one of these rulers, Vald amarr I, contributed to Henry's political destruction. In Norway, Sverri r Sigurdarson had swept away the old social order, and replaced it with one more hi ghly centralized; ha d challenged the power of Rome without, and that of his own nobles within, like He nry II of England and Frederick Barbarossa. After Sverrir's death, an interregnum followed; but at last there came to the throne a monarch {p. x} both powerful and enlightened, who extended th e reforms of Sverrir, and having brought about unity and peace, quickened the intellect ual life of Norway with the fructifying influence of French and English literary mode ls. Under the patronage of this ruler, Hákon Hákonarson, the great romances, notably those of Chrétien de Troyes, were translated into Norse, some of them passing over into Swedish, Danish, and Icelandic. Somewhat later, Matthew Paris, the great scholar and author, who represented the culture both of England and of France, spent eighteen mont hs in Norway, though not until after Snorri's death. Iceland itself, in part through Norway, in part directly, drew from the life of the Continent: Sæmundr the Learned, who had studi ed in Paris, founded a school at Oddi; Sturla Sigvatsson, Snorri's nephew, made a pilgrimage to Rome, and visited Germany; and Snorri himself shows, in the opening pa ges of his Heimskringla, or History of the Kings of Norway, the influence of that gr eat romantic cycle, the Matter of Troy. Snorri Sturluson was in the fullest sense a pr oduct of his time. The son of a turbulent and ambitious chieftain, Sturla Thórdsson, of Hv amm in western Iceland, he was born to a heritage of strife and avari ce. The history of the Sturlung house, like that of Douglas in"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Scotland, is a long and perplexed chronicle of intrigue, treachery, a nd assassination, in all of which Snorri played an active part. Bu t even as among the Douglases there was one who, however deep in treason and intrigue , yet loved learning and poetry, and was distinguished in each, so Sno rri, involved by sordid poli tical chicanery, found time not only to compose original verse which was ad mired by his contemporaries, but also to record the myths and legends, the history {p. xi} and poetry, of his race, in a prose that is one of the glories of the age. The perplexing story of Snorri's life, told by his nephew, Sturla Thórdsson,[1] may well be omitted from this brief discussion. A car eful and scholarly account of it by Eiríkr Magnússon[1] will be found in the in troduction to the sixth volume of The Saga Library . From Snorri's marriage in 1199 to his assassin ation at the hands of his son-in-law, Gizurr Thórvaldsson, in 1241, there was little in his li fe which his biographer could relate with satisfaction. His friends, his relati ves, his very children, Snorri sacrificed to his insatiate ambition. As chief and as lawman, he gave venal decisions and perverted justice; he purposed at any cost to become the most pow erful man in Iceland. There is even ground for belief that he deliberately undertook to betray the republic to Hákon of Norway, and that only his lack of courage prevented him from subverting his count ry's liberty. Failure brought about his death, for Snorri, who had been a favorite at the Norwegian court, incurred the King's suspicion after fifteen years had passed with no accomplishment; and daring to leave Norway against Hákon's comma nd, he fell under the royal displeasure. Gizurr, his murderer, proved to have been acting at the expres s order of the King. Eiríkr Magnússon, in the admirable biography to which I have referred, attempts to apologize for Snorri's faults on the ground that be \"really compares very favorably with the leading contemporary godar [chieftains] of the land.\" It is true that he made no overt attempt to keep his treasonable [1. Sturlunga Saga , edited by G. Vigfússon, Oxford, 1878. 2. The Saga Library , edited by William Morris and Eiríkr Magnússon, vol. vi; Heimskringla , vol. iv, London, 1905.] {p. xii} promise to Norway, but I think it by no mean s certain that repentance stayed his hand. Indeed, familiar as he was with the hopelessly anarchical co nditions of his native land, its devastating feuds, its plethora of lawless, uns crupulous chiefs, all striving for wealth and influence, none inspired with a genu ine affection for the commonwealth, nor understanding the fundamental principles of democracy, Snorri may well have felt that it were far better to endure a foreign ruler who could compel union and peace. If this was the motive underlying his self-abasement at the Norwegian court and his promises to Hákon, then weakness alone is sufficient to acco unt for his failure; if he had no such purpose, he must be regarded as both weak and treacherous."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"It is with relief that we turn to Snorri's work s, to find in them, at le ast, traces of genuine nobility of spirit. The unscrupulous politicia n kept sound and pure some corner of his heart in which to enshrine his love for his pe ople's glorious past, for the myths of their ancient gods, half grotesque and half sublime: for the Christ-like Baldr; for Promethean Odin and Týr, sacrificing eye and hand to save the race; for the tears of Freyja, the tragic sorrows of Gudrún, the pitiful end of Svanhild r, the magnificent, all-devastating fire of Ragnarök. His interest in these wondrous things, lik e Scott's love for the heroes, beliefs, and customs of the Scottish folk, was, I think, pr imarily antiquarian. Inde fatigable in research, with an artist's eye for the picturesque, a poet's feeling for the dramatic and the human, he created the most vivid, vital histories that have yet been penned. Accurate beyond the manner of his age, gifted with genius fo r expression, divining the human personalities, the comic {p. xiii} or tragic interplay of amb itions, passions, and destinies behind the mere chronicled events, he had almost ideal qualities as an historian. Poet he was too, though the codified rule s, the cryptic phrase, and conventional expression, which indeed \"bound\" together the words of the singers of ancient Scandinavia, must spoil his verse for us. Ye t it is well to remember that in his own lifetime, not his natural prose, but his arti ficial poetry was famous throughout the North. Snorri's greatest work is undoubtedly the Heimskringla .[1] Beginning with a rationalized account of the founding of Northern civiliza tion by the ancient gods, he proceeds through heroic legend to the historical period, and follows the career s of his heroes on the throne, in Eastern courts and camps, or on forays in distant lands, from the earliest times to the reign of Sverrir, who came to the throne in 1184, five years after the author's birth. \"The materials at Snorri's di sposal,\" says Magnusson,[2] \"wer e: oral tradition; written genealogical records; old songs or narrative lays such as Thiodolf's Tale[3] of the Ynglings and Eyvind's Haloga Tale; poems of court poets, i.e. , historic songs, which people knew by heart all from the days of Hair fair down to Snorri's own time. 'And most store,' he says, 'we set by that which said in such songs as were sung before the chiefs themselves or the sons of them; and we hold all that true which is found in these songs concerning their wayfarings and their battles.'

Snorri's was a more ambitious task. Discerning that the course of life is determined by cause and effect, and that in the lives of kings widely ramified interests, national and dynastic, come into play, he conceived a new idea of saga-writing: the seed of cause sown in the preceding must yield its crop of effect in the succeeding reign. This the writer of lives of kings must bear in mind. And so Snorri addresses himsel f to writing the first pragmatic history ever penned many Teutonic vernacular--the Heimskringla .\" The evidence for Snorri's authorship of Heimskringla is not conclusive; but Vigfússon's demonstration is accepted by most scholars.[1 ] We may safely assume, apart from the general tendency of the external evidence, that one and the same author must have written the histories and the Prose Edda . A comparison of the names of skalds and skaldic poems mentioned in both works will sh ow that the author of each had a wide acquaintance with the conventional poetic literature of Scandinavia, particularly of Iceland, and that, if we suppose two distinct authors, both men had almost precisely the same poetic equipment. Each [1. See Sturlunga Saga , vol. i, Proleg., pp. lxxv ff. The limitations of an introduction do not permit an abstract of the discu ssion in this place.] {p. xv} of the works under consideration begins with a rationalization of the Odinic myths, and reveals an identity of attitude toward the ancient faith. Furthermore, the careful reader will be charmed with the sinewy style of both the Heimskringla and the Edda , and will be obliged to admit the close similarity between them in structure and in expression. Finally, Vigfússon has shown that they exhibit occasi onally a remarkable identity of phrase.[1] The Prose Edda is undoubtedly by Snorri. It is preserved in three primary manuscripts: Codex Regius, early fourteenth century; C odex Wormianus, fourteenth century, named from Ole Worm, from whose hands it passed, in 1706, into the hands of Arni Magnússon; and Codex Upsaliensis, about 1300, perhaps a dir ect copy of Snorri's own text. This last manuscript, and also the Arnamagnæan vellu m No. 748, which preserves a portion of the text, testify unmistakably to Snorri's author ship; the Codex even gives, in detail, the subjects of the thre e divisions of the book. These three divisions, but for the evidence of the manuscripts, might seem to afford ground for assuming plural aut horship. The first part, the Gylfaginning , or Beguiling of Gylfi, is an epitome of Odinic mythology, cast in the form of a dialogue between Gylfi, a legendary Swedish king, and the triune Od in. Snorri, though a Christian, tells the old"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"pagan tales with obvious -relish, and often, in the enthusiasm of the true antiquary, rises to magnificent heights. Ever and again he fortif ies his narrative with citations from the Poetic Edda , the great treasure-house of Scandinavian mythol ogical and heroic poetry. One passes from Gylfaginning to Skáldskaparmál with [1. See Sturlunga Saga , vol. i, Proleg. pp. lxxvii, and note.] {p. xvi} very little shock, in spite of the great difference in subj ect and treatment) which the author has attempted, rather skilfully, to modulate through a second dialogue. The questioner this time is one Ægir; and repl ies are made by the god Bragi, famed for eloquence and the gift of poetic expre ssion. This intermediate dialogue, called Bragarædur , or Bragi's Discourses, strikes the keynote of the entire book, and really reconciles the first section to the second and third, whose dissimilarity to Gylfaginning have led some scholars to believe that one or the other is not Snorri's work. The god relates several adventures of the Æsir of the same character as those recounted in Gylfaginning , and concludes with a myth concerning the origin of the poetic art. From this point on, barely maintaining the ficti on of the dialogue, Sno rri makes his work a treatise on the conventional vocabulary and phra seology of skaldship, fo r the guidance of young skalds. The third section of the Edda is the Háttatal , or Enumeration of Metres, and combines three separate songs of praise: one on King Hákon, a second on Skúli Bárdsson, the King's father-in-law and most powerful vassal, and a third celebrati ng both. Each of the hundred and two stanzas of the work belongs to a distinct metric type or subtype, and between stanzas Snorri has inserted definitio ns, occasionally longer notes, or comments. We are now in a position to see the purpose and the artistic unity of the Prose Edda : the entire work is a textbook for apprentice poets. Gylfaginning , conceived in the true antiquarian spirit, supplies the mythologi cal and legendary background which, in the Christian age that had superseded the vi vid old heathen days, a young man might not know or might avoid. \"Do not lose sight of these {p. xvii} splendid tales of the fathers, \" Snorri, by implication, says to the youthful bard; \"but remember always that these old legends are to be used to point a moral or adorn a tale, and not to be believed, or to be altered without authority of an cient skalds who knew them. Belief is sin; tampering with tradition is a crime against scholarship.\" The second and third sections, Skáldskaparmál and Háttatal , offer the rules of composition, and drive them home by means of models drawn, in the one case, from acknowledged masters of the craft, in the ot her, by the example of a complete skaldic trilogy, the work of a man who was accepted by his own time as a worthy successor of"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Bragi, Kormákr, and Einarr. A needed transition from the literary to the technical portion of the book is supplied by Bragarædur , which narrates, in the same spirit as Gylfaginning , further useful tales, and conclude s with a mythological account of the skaldic art. Even the Prologue, which many scholars consider spurious, is an integral part of the work--a fact established by Snorri's single ad dress, in the character of the author, to beginners. In this apostrophe he refers to th e Prologue: \"Remember, these tales are to be used only as Chief Skalds have used them, and must be revered as ancient tradition, but are neither to be believed nor to be tamper ed with. Regard them as I have indicated at the beginning of this book .\" The beginning of the book is a summary of the Biblical story of the Creation and Deluge, followed by a rationalized account of the rise of the ancient pagan faith, according to which the old gods appear, not as deities, but as men. The word \"Edda,\" as applied to the whole wor k, has long furnished scholars with material for disputation. The {p. xviii} different theories regarding it need not be re -stated here. It is the translator's personal opinion that Magnússon's etymology, if not estab lished, is at least the most satisfactory one likely to be offered. Magnússon' points out that Snorri passed the interval between his third and nineteenth years at Oddi, unde r the fostering of th e grandson of Sæmundr the Learned; that Sæmundr, who had studied at Paris, had founded a school at Oddi; that Snorri became the author of a book which was called Edda ; and that this book contains, in its first section, a prose paraphrase of many of the songs from the Elder or Poetic Edda , together with a number of quotati ons from that work. Now the Poetic Edda was ascribed by its earlies t recorded possessor, Bishop Br ynjólf Sveinsson, to Sæmundr; and while it is improbable that Sæmundr composed the poem, it is highly probable that it once formed part of his library at Oddi. Th ere Snorri may have learned to know it; and we may assume that he gave the prose editi on the, name of its poetical original. That original, \"the mother MS.,\" he thinks would naturally have been called \"the book of, or at Oddi,\" which would be expressed, in Icela ndic, either as \"Odda bók,\" or as \"Edda,\" following, in the latter case, accepted linguistic laws. Snorri's familiarity with the Elder or Po etic Edda is demonstrated by his frequent quotations from Völuspá , Hávamál , Grímnismál , Vafthrúdnismál , Alsvinnsmál or Alvissmál , and Grottasöngr . He knew Lokasenna as well, but confused three stanzas, apparently failing to remember the order [1. Magnússon's theory, with a summary of all others in the field, was presented in a paper read before the Viking Club on November 15, 1895, published in the Saga Book of that society, and separately printed at London in 1896.] {p. xix}"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"in his original. One poem that he me ntions is lacking in the Poetic Edda as we know it: Heimdallargaldr , the Song or Incantation of Heimdallr; moreover, he makes seventeen citations from other poems which, although lost to us, evidently formed portions of the original Eddic collections, or belonged to the same traditional stock. The disappearance of the manuscript which Sno rri used is a great loss. The first translation of the Prose Edda wa s published at Copenhagen in 1665, when the complete text appeared, with Latin and Danish interpretation. This was entitled Edda islandorum an. Chr. 1213 islandice conscrip ta per Snorronem Sturlæ, nunc prinium islandice, danice, et latine ex antiquis codi cibus in lucem prodit opera p. J. Resenii . The standard Danish translation is that of R. Nyerup, Copenhagen, 1865. In 1746, J. Göransson printed at Upsala the first Sw edish version, with a Latin translation. Göransson's original was the Codex Upsaliens is. Anders Uppström made an independent translation in 1859. In 1755-56 there appeared at Copenhagen a wo rk of the greatest im portance for the study of Scandinavian antiquities in England: Mallet's Monumens de la Mythologie et de la Poesie des Celtes et Particu lièrement des Aciens Scandinaves . This book, which comprised a general introducti on on the ancient Scandinavian civilization, a translation of Gylfaginning, and a synopsis of Skáldskaparm ál and Háttatal, was turned into English by Bishop Percy, under the title of Northern Antiquities . Percy claimed to know Göransson's text as well as the French. Northern Antiquities was published at London in 1770, and was reprinted at Edinburgh in 1809, w ith additions by Sir Walter Scott. The best-known translation, and the only complete one which is at all trustworthy, is that in Latin, combined, with {p. xx} the Icelandic text, in the Arna magnæan edition, Copenhagen, 1848-87. In 1842, G. W. Dasent, the translator of Njáls Saga , and a prominent scholar in the Scandinavian field, prin ted at Stockholm his Prose or Younger Edda , which contains a translation of Gylfaginning and of the narrative passages of Skáldskaparmál . A similarly incomplete English version was printed at Chicago, in 1880, by Rasmus B. Anderson. Professor Anderson also edite d a combined translation of both Eddas, the Poetic Edda by Benjamin Thorpe, and the Prose Edda by I. A. Blackwell. Blackwell's translation, which stops with Bragarædur , had first appeared at London in 1847, together with an abstract of Eyrbyggia Saga by Scott. Samuel Laing's translation is likewise incomplete. A French version of Gylfaginning , La Fascination de Gulfi , was published at Strassburg by F. G. Bergmann. A second edition appeared in 1871. So far as I can ascertain, the first translati on into German was the wo rk of Friedrich Rühs, Berlin, 1812. This contains a long historical introduction, and ends with the story of the Völsungs in Skáldskaparmál . Karl Simrock's Die Jüngere Edda , published in 1851 and"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"reprinted in 1855, although incomplete, is more accurate than any earlier translation, and is remarkable for its literary excellence. Th e most scholarly rendering into German is by Hugo Gering, Leipzig, 1892, but unfortunately it includes only the narrative portions of the book. Until 1900, the best edition of Snorri's Edda was by Thórleifr Jónsson, Copenhagen, 1875. This was superseded by Finnur Jónsson's splendid Danish edition. In 1907, Professor Jónsson produced an Icelandic edition, {p. xxi} which forms volume xli of the Íslendinga Sögur , published at Reykjavík. It was fortunate for me that these last two editions appeared before I began my work. Professor Jónsson provided me with an excellent text; and, second in value only to this, with an index and an invaluable Icelandi c prose re-phrasing of the skaldic verses. I regret exceedingly that the highly technica l nature of Háttatal forbids translation into English. There are, to be sure, more or le ss--usually less--accurate translations into Scandinavian and into Latin. Even in the excellent Arnamagnæan edition, many of the glosses are purely conjectural; and any a ttempt to convey into English a vocabulary which has no equivalent in our language must fail. Skáldskaparmál , however, is here presented, complete, for the first time in English. To those who have helped me I wish to expr ess my deepest apprecia tion. First of all, to Professor William Henry Schofield I owe a debt of gratitude which is more than four years old, and has increased beyond computa tion. Dr. Henry Goddard Leach, my first instructor in Scandinavian lit erature, gave me my greatest single intellectual stimulus, and thereby determined the current of my work. Dr. Frederick W. Lieder, of Harvard University, deserves my thanks for his devot ed assistance in reading proof, a task as dreary as it is essential. I am also indebted for valuable suggestions to Mr. H. W. Rabe, of Simmons College. It is a great satisfaction to acknowledge thes e debts, incurred in the course of a labor which has been my delight for several years. I should, however, do in justice to those who have aided me, as well as to myself, if I did {p. xxii} not assume full responsibility for the faults of the translation. Whatever these may be, I trust that the book may perform some servic e in bringing before the English reading public a greater portion of Snorri's classic treatise than has previously been accessible. The reader will perceive the value of the Edda if he will compare it, for legendary and antiquarian interest, with the Mabinogion , and will also realize that the Edda is a masterpiece of style,--style that no translator can ever reproduce.

July 1, 1916 {p. 3} PROLOGUE IN the beginning God created heaven and earth and all those things which are in them; and last of all, two of human kind, Adam a nd Eve, from whom the races are descended. And their offspring multiplied among themselves and were scattered throughout the earth. But as time passed, the races of men became unlike in nature: some were good and believed on the right; but many more turned af ter the lusts of the world and slighted God's command. Wherefore, God drowned the world in a swelling of the sea, and all living things, save them alone that were in the ark with Noah. After Noah's flood eight of mankind remained alive, who peopled the earth ; and the races descended from them. And it was even as before: when the earth was full of folk and inhabited of many, then all the multitude of mankind began to love greed, w ealth, and worldly honor, but neglected the worship of God. Now accordingly it came to so evil a pass that they would not name God; and who then could tell their sons of God's mighty wonders? Thus it happened that they lost the name of God; and throughout the wideness of the world the man was not found who could distinguish in aught the trac e of his Creator. But not the less did God bestow upon them the gifts of the earth: wea lth and happiness, for th eir enjoyment in the world; He increased also their wisdom, so that they knew all earthly matters, and every phase of whatsoever they might see in the air and on the earth. One thing they wondered and pondered over: what it might mean, that the earth and the beasts and the birds had one nature in so me ways, and yet were unlike in manner of {p. 4} life. In this was their nature one: that the earth was clef t into lofty mountain-peaks, wherein water spurted up, and it was not needful to dig longer for water there than in the deep valleys; so it is also with beasts and birds: it is equally far to the blood in the head and the feet. Another quality of the earth is , that in each year grass and flowers grow upon the earth, and in the same year all that gr owth falls away and w ithers; it is even so with beasts and birds: hair and feathers gr ow and fall away each year. This is the third nature of the earth, that when it is opened and dug up, the grass grows straightway on the soil which is uppermost on the ea rth. Boulders and stones they likened to the teeth and bones of living beings. Thus they recognized that the earth was qui ck, and had life with some manner of nature of its own; and th ey understood that she was wondrous old in years and mighty in kind: she nourished all th at lived, and she took to herself all that died. Therefore they gave her a name, and tr aced the number of their generations from"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"her. The same thing, moreover, they lear ned from their aged kinsmen: that many hundreds of years have been numbered since th e same earth yet was, and the same sun and stars of the heavens; but the courses of these were unequal, some having a longer course, and some a shorter. From things like these the thought stirred within them that there might be some governor of the stars of heaven: one w ho might order their courses afte r his will; and that he must be very strong and full of might. Th is also they held to be true : that if he swayed the chief things of creation, he must have been before the stars of heaven; and they saw that if he ruled the courses of the heaven ly bodies, he must also gover n the shining of the sun, and the dews of the air, and the fruits of the earth, whatsoever grows {p. 5} upon it; and in like manner the winds of the air and the storms of the sea. They knew not yet where his kingdom was; but this they believ ed: that he ruled all things on earth and in the sky, the great stars also of the heaven, a nd the winds of the sea. Wherefore, not only to tell of this fittingly, but also that they might fasten it in memory, they gave names out of their own minds to all things. This be lief of theirs has changed in many ways, according as the peoples drifted asunder and their tongues became severed one from another. But all things they discerned with the wisdom of the earth, for the understanding of the spirit was not given to them; this they perceived, that all things were fashioned of some essence. II The world was divided into three parts: fr om the south, extending into the west and bordering on the Mediterranean S ea,--all this part was called Africa, the southern quarter of which is hot, so that it is parched with th e sun. The second part, from west to north and bordering on the ocean, is called Európá or Eneá; its northern part is so cold that no grass grows upon it, and no man dwells there. From the north and all down over the eastern part, even to the south, is called Asia. In that region of the world is all fairness and pride, and the fruits of the earth's increase, gold and jewels. There also is the centre of the earth; and even as the land there is lo velier and better in every way than in other places, so also were the sons of men there most favored w ith all goodly gifts: wis dom, and strength of the body, beauty, and all manner of knowledge. {p. 6} III Near the earth's centre was made that goodliest of homes and haunts that ever have been, which is called Troy, even that which we call Turkland. This abode was much more gloriously made than others, and fashioned w ith more skill of craftsmanship in manifold wise, both in luxury and in the wealth which was there in abundance. There were twelve"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"kingdoms and one High King, and many sovereignties belonged to each kingdom; in the stronghold were twelve chieftai ns. These chieftains were in every manly part greatly above other men that have ever been in the world. One king among them was called Múnón or Mennón; and he was wedded to the daughter of the High King Priam, her who was called Tróán; they had a child named Trór , whom we call Thor. He was fostered in Thrace by a certain war-duke called Lóríkus; bu t when he was ten winters old he took unto him the weapons of his father. He was as goodly to look upon, when he came among other men, as the ivory that is inlaid in oak; his hair was fairer th an gold. When he was twelve winters old he had his full measure of st rength; then he lifted clear of the earth ten bear-skins all at one time; and then he slew Duke Lóríkus, his foster-father, and with him his wife Lórá, or Glórá, and took into his own hands the realm of Thrace, which we call Thrúdheim. Then he went forth far and wide over the lands, and sought out every quarter of the earth, overcoming alone all berserks and giants, and one dragon, greatest of all dragons, and many beasts. In the northern half of his kingdom he found the prophetess that is called Síbil, whom we call Sif, and wedded her. The lineag e of Sif I cannot tell; she was fairest of all women, {p. 7} and her hair was like gold. Th eir son was Lóridi, who resemb led his father; his son was Einridi, his son Vingethor, his son Vingener, his son Móda, his son Magi, his son Seskef, his son Bedvig, his son Athra (whom we call Annarr), his son Ítermann, his son Heremód, his son Skjaldun (whom we call Skjöld ), his son Bjáf (who m we call Bjárr), his son Ját, his son Gudólfr, his son Finn, his s on Fríallaf (whom we call Fridleifr); his son was he who is named Vóden, whom we call Odin: he was a man far-famed for wisdom and every accomplishment. His wife was Frígídá, whom we call Frigg. IV Odin had second sight, and his wife also; a nd from their foreknowledge he found that his name should be exalted in the northern part of the world and glorifie d above the fame of all other kings. Therefore, he made r eady to journey out of Turkland, and was accompanied by a great multitude of people, young folk and old, men and women; and they had with them much goods of great price. And wherever they went over the lands of the earth, many glorious things were spoken of them, so that they were held more like gods than men. They made no end to their jour neying till they were come north into the land that is now called Saxland; there Odin ta rried for a long space, and took the land into his own hand, far and wide. In that land Odin set up three of his sons for land-wardens. One was named Vegdeg: he was a mighty king and ruled over East Saxland; his son was Vitgils; his sons were Vitta, Heingistr's father, and Sigarr, father of Sv ebdeg, whom we call Svipdagr. The second son of Odin was {p. 8}"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Beldeg, whom we call Baldr: he had the land which is now called Westphalia. His son was Brandr, his son Frjódigar, (whom we ca ll Fródi), his son Fre óvin, his son Uvigg, his son Gevis (whom we call Gave). Odin's third son is named Sigi, his son Rerir. These the forefathers ruled over what is now called Fr ankland; and thence is descended the house known as Völsungs. From all these are sprung many and great houses. Then Odin began his way northward, and came into the land which they called Reidgothland; and in that land he took possession of all that pleased him. He set up over the land that son of his called Skjöldr, whose son was Fridleifr;--and thence descends the house of the Skjöldungs: these are the kings of the Danes. And what was then called Reidgothland is now called Jutland. V After that he went northward, where the la nd is called Sweden; the king there was named Gylfi. When the king learned of the coming of those men of Asia, who were called Æsir, he went to meet them, and made offer to them that Odin should have such power in his realm as he himself wielded. And such we ll-being followed ever upon their footsteps, that in whatsoever lands they dwelt were good seasons and peace; and all believed that they caused these things, for the lords of the land perceived that they were unlike other men whom they had seen, both in fairness and also in wisdom. The fields and the choice lands in that pl ace seemed fair to Odin, and he chose for himself the site of a city which is now calle d Sigtún. There he estab lished chieftains in the {p. 9} fashion which had prevailed in Troy; he se t up also twelve head-men to be doomsmen over the people and to judge the laws of the la nd; and he ordained also all laws as, there had been before, in Troy, and according to the customs of the Turks. After that he went into the north, until he was stopped by the sea, which men thought lay around all the lands of the earth; and ther e he set his son over this kingdom, which is now called Norway. This king was Sæmingr; the kings of Norway trace their lineage from him, and so do also the jarls and the other mighty men, as is said in the Háleygjatal . Odin had with him one of his sons called Yngvi, who was king in Sweden after him; and those houses come from him that are named Ynglings. The Æsir took wives of the land for themselves, and some also for their sons; and these kindreds became many in number, so that throughout Saxland, and thence all over the region of the north, th ey spread out until their tongue, even the speech of th e men of Asia, was the nativ e tongue over all these lands. Therefore men think that they can perceive , from their forefathers' names which are written down, that those names belonged to this tongue, and that the Æsir brought the tongue hither into the northern region, into Norway and into Sweden, into Denmark and into Saxland. But in England there are anci ent lists of land-names and place-names which may show that these names came from another tongue than this."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"{p. 13} GYLFAGINNING HERE BEGINS THE BEGUILING OF GYLFI I. King Gylfi ruled the land that men now call Swed en. It is told of hi m that he gave to a wandering woman, in return for her merry-maki ng, a plow-land in his realm, as much as four oxen might turn up in a da y and a night. But this woman was of the kin of the Æsir; she was named Gefjun. She took from the north, out of Jötunheim, four oxen which were the soils of a certain giant and, herself, and se t them before the plow. And the plow cut so wide and so deep that it loosened up the land; and the oxen drew the land out into the sea and to the westward, and stopped in a certain sound. There Gefjun set the land, and gave it a name, calling it Selund. And from that time on, the spot whence the land had been torn up is water: it is now called the Lögr in Sweden; and bays lie in that lake even as the headlands in Selund. Thus says Bragi, the ancient skald: Gefjun drew from Gylfi | glad ly the wave-trove's free-hold, Till from the running beasts | sweat reeked, to Denmark's increase; The oxen bore, moreover, | eight eyes, gleaming brow-lights, O'er the field's wide: booty, | and four heads in their plowing. II. King Gylfi was a wise man and skilled in magic; he was much troubled that the Æsir- people were so cunning that all things went according to their will. He pondered whether this might proceed from their own nature, or {p. 14} whether the divine powers which they worshi pped might ordain such things. He set out on his way to Ásgard, going secretly, and- clad himself in the likeness of an old man, with which he dissembled. But the Æsir were wiser in this matter, having second sight; and they saw his journeying before ever he ca me, and prepared against him deceptions of the eye. When he came into the town, he saw th ere a hall so high that he could not easily make out the top of it: its thatching was laid with golden shields after the fashion of a shingled roof. So also says Thjódólfr of Hvi n, that Valhall was thatched with shields: On their backs they let beam, | sore battered with stones, Odin's hall-shingles, | the shrewd sea-farers. In the hall-doorway Gylfi saw a man juggling w ith anlaces, having seven in the air at one time. This man asked of him his name. He cal led himself Gangleri, and said he had come"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"by the paths of the serpent, and prayed fo r lodging for the night, asking: \"Who owns the hall?\" The other replied that it was their ki ng; \"and I will attend thee to see him; then shalt thou thyself ask him concerning his; na me;\" and the man wheeled about before him into the hall, and he went after, and straig htway the door closed itself on his heels. There he saw a great room and much people, some with games, some drinking; and some had weapons and were fighting. Then he looke d about him, and thought unbelievable many things which he saw; and he said: All the gateways | ere one goes out Should one scan: For 't is uncertain | where sit the unfriendly On the bench before thee. {p. 15} He saw three high-seats, each above the othe r, and three men sat thereon,-one on each. And he asked what might be the name of those lords. He who had conducted him in answered that the one who, sa t on the nethermost high-seat was a king, \"and his name is Hárr;[1] but the next is named Janhárr;[2] a nd he who is uppermost is called Thridi.\"[3] Then Hárr asked the newcomer whether his erra nd were more than for the meat and drink which were always at his command, as for ev ery one there in the Hall of the High One. He answered that he first desired to learn whether there were any wise man there within. Hárr said, that he should not escape whole from thence unless he were wiser. And stand thou fort h | who speirest; Who answers, | he shall sit. III. Gangleri began his questioning thus: \"Who is foremost, or oldest, of all the gods?\" Hárr answered: cc He is called in our speech A llfather, but in the Elder Ásgard he had twelve names: one is Allfather; the second is Lord, or Lord of Hosts; the third is Nikarr, or Spear-Lord; the fourth is Nikudr, or Striker; th e fifth is Knower of Many Things; the sixth, Fulfiller of Wishes; the seventh, Far-S peaking One; the eighth, The Shaker, or He that Putteth the Armies to Flight; the nint h, The Burner; the tenth, The Destroyer; the eleventh, The Protector; the twelfth, Gelding.\" Then asked Gangleri: \"Where is this god, or what power hath he, or what hath he wrought that is a glorious deed?\" Hárr made answer: \"He lives throughout all ages and governs all his realm, and directs all things, great [1. High. 2. Equally High. 3. Third.] {p. 16}"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"and small.\" Then said Jafnhárr: \"He fashione d heaven and earth and air, and all things which are in them.\" Then. spake Thridi: \"The greatest of all is th is: that he made man, and gave him the spirit, which shall live a nd never perish, though the flesh-frame rot to mould, or burn to ashes; and all men shall live, such as are just in action, and be with himself in the place called Gimlé. But evil men go to Hel and thence down to the Misty Hel; and that is down in the ninth world.\" Then said Gangleri: \"What did he before heaven and earth were made?\" And Hárr answ ered: \"He was then with the Rime-Giants.\" IV. Gangleri said: \"What was the beginning, or how began it, or what was before it?\" Hárr answered: \"As is told in Völuspá : Erst was the age | when nothing was: Nor sand nor sea, | nor chilling stream-waves; Earth was not found, | nor Ether-Heaven,-- A Yawning Gap, | but grass was none.\" Then said Jafnhárr: \"It was many ages before the earth was shaped that the Mist-World was made; and midmost within it lies the we ll that is called Hvergelmir, from which spring the rivers called Svöl, Gunnthrá, Fjör m, Fimbulthul, Slídr and Hríd, Sylgr and Ylgr, Víd, Leiptr; Gjöll is hard by Hel-gates. \" And Thridi said: \"Yet first was the world in the southern region, which was named Músp ell; it is light and hot; that region is glowing and burning, and impassable to such as are outlanders and have not their holdings there. He who sits there at the land' s-end, to defend the land, is called Surtr; he brandishes a flaming {p. 17} sword, and at the end of the world he sha ll go forth and harry, and overcome all the gods, and burn all the world with fire; thus is said in Völuspá : Surtr fares from the south | with switch-eating flame,-- On his sword shimmers | the sun of the War-Gods; The rock-crags crash; | the fiends are reeling; Heroes tread Hel-way; | Heaven is cloven.\" V. Gangleri asked: \"How were things wrought, ere the races were and the tribes of men increased?\" Then said Hárr: \"The streams ca lled Ice-waves, those which were so long come from the fountain-heads that the y easty venom upon them had hardened like the slag that runs out of the fire,--these then became ice; and when the ice halted and ceased to run, then it froze over above. But the drizz ling rain that rose from the venom congealed to rime, and the rime increased, frost over frost, each over the other, even into Ginnungagap, the Yawning Void.\" Then spake Jafnhárr: \"Ginnungagap, which faced toward the northern quarter, became filled w ith heaviness, and masses of ice and rime, and from within, drizzling rain and gusts; bu t the southern part of the Yawning Void was lighted by those sparks and glowing masses wh ich flew out of Múspellheim.\" And Thridi said: \"Just as cold arose out of Niflheim, and all terrible things, so also all that looked"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"toward Múspellheim became hot and glowing; but Ginnungagap was as mild as windless air, and when the breath of heat met the ri me, so that it melted and dripped, life was quickened from the yeast-drops, by the power of that which sent the heat, and became a man's form. And that man is named Ymir, but the Rime-Giants call him Aurgelimir; {p. 18} and thence are come the races of the Rime-Giants, as it says in Völuspá the Less : All the witches | spring from Witolf, All the warlocks | are of Willharm, And the spell-singers | spring from Swarthead; All the ogres | of Ymir come. But concerning this says Vafthrúdnir the giant: Out of the Ice-waves | issued venom-drops, Waxing until | a giant was; Thence are our kindred | come all together,-- So it is | they are savage forever.\" Then said Gangleri: \"How did th e races grow thence, or afte r what fashion was it brought to pass that more men came into being? Or do ye hold him God, of whom ye but now spake?\" And Jafnhárr answered: \"By no mean s do we acknowledge him God; he was evil and all his kindred: we call them Rime-Giants. Now it is said that when he slept, a sweat came upon him, and there grew under his left hand a man and a woman, and one of his feet begat a son with the other; and thus th e races are come; these are the Rime-Giants. The old Rime-Giant, him we call Ymir.\" VI. Then said Gangleri: \"Where dwelt Ymir, or wherein did he find sustenance?\" Hárr answered: \"Straightway afte r the rime dripped, there sp rang from it the cow called Audumla; four streams of milk ran from her udders, and she nourished Ymir.\" Then asked Gangleri: \"Wherewithal was the cow nourished?\" And Hárr made answer: {p. 19} \"She licked the ice-blocks, whic h were salty; and the first day that she licked the blocks, there came forth from the blocks in the ev ening a man's hair; the second day, a man's head; the third day the whole man was there. He is named Búri: he was fair of feature, great and mighty. He begat a son called Borr, who wedded the woman named Bestla, daughter of Bölthorn the giant; and they had three sons: one was Odin, the second Vili, the third Vé. And this is my belief, that he , Odin, with his brothers, must be ruler of heaven and earth; we hold that he must be so called; so is that man called whom we know to be mightiest and most worthy of honor, and ye do well to let him be so called.\""},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"VII. Then said Gangleri: \"What covenant wa s between them, or which was the stronger?\" And Hárr answered: \"The sons of Borr slew Ymir the giant; lo, where he fell there gushed forth so much blood out of his wounds th at with it they drow ned all the race of the Rime-Giants, save that one, whom giants call Bergelmir, escaped with his household; he went upon his ship,[1] and his wife with him, and they were safe there. And from them are come the races of the Rime-Giants, as is said here: Untold ages | ere earth was shapen, Then was Bergelmir born; That first I recall, | how the famous wise giant On the deck of the ship was laid down.\" VIII. Then said Gangleri: \"What was done then by Borr's sons, if thou believe that they be gods?\" Hárr replied: \"In this matter th ere is no little to be said. They took [1. Literally, mill-bench or mortar.] {p. 20} Ymir and bore him into the middle of the Yawning Void, and made of him the earth: of his blood the sea and the waters ; the land was made of his flesh, and the crags of his bones; gravel and stones they fashioned from his teeth and his grinders and from those bones that were broken.\" And Jafnhárr said : \"Of the blood, which ran and welled forth freely out of his wounds, they made the sea, when they had formed and made firm the earth together, and laid the sea in a ring round. about her; and it may well seem a hard thing to most men to cross over it.\" Then sa id Thridi: \"They took his skull also, and made of it the heaven, and set it up ove r the earth with four corners; and under each corner they set a dwarf: the names of these are East, West, North, and South. Then they took the glowing embers and sparks that burst forth a nd had been cast out of Múspellheim, and set them in the midst of the Yawning Void, in th e heaven, both above and below, to illumine heaven and earth. They assigned places to a ll fires: to some in heaven, some wandered free under the heavens; nevertheless, to these also they gave a place, and shaped them courses. It is said in old \"songs, that from these the days were reckoned, and the tale of years told, as is said in Völuspá : The sun knew not | where she had housing; The moon knew not | what Might he had; The stars knew not | wh ere stood their places. Thus was it ere | the earth was fashioned.\" Then said Gangleri: These are great tidings which I now hear; that is a wondrous great piece of craftsmanship, and cunningly made. How was the earth contrived?\" And Hárr answered: \"She is ring-shape d without, and round about {p. 21}"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"her without lieth the deep sea; and along the strand of that s ea they gave lands to the races of giants for habitation. But on the inner earth they made a citadel round about the world against the hostility of the giants, and for th eir citadel they raised up the brows of Ymir the giant, and called that place Midgard. They took also his brain and cast it in the air, and made from it the clouds, as is here said: Of Ymir's flesh | the earth was fashioned, And of his sweat the sea; Crags of his bones, | trees of his hair, And of his skull the sky. Then of his brows | the blithe gods made Midgard for sons of men; And of his brain | the bitter-mooded Clouds were all created.\" IX. Then said Gangleri: \"Much indeed they had accomplished then, methinks, when earth and heaven were made, and the sun and the constellations of heaven were fixed, and division was made of days; now whence come the men that people the world?\" And Hárr answered: 'When the sons of Borr were walking along the sea- strand, they found two trees, and took up the trees and shaped men of them: the first gave them spirit and life; the second, wit and feeling; the third, form , speech, hearing, and sight. They gave them clothing and names: the male was called Askr , and the female Embla, and of them was mankind begotten, which received a dwelling- place under Midgard. Next they made for themselves in the middle of the world a city which is called Ásgard; men call it Troy. There dwelt the gods and their kindred; a nd many tidings and tales of it have {p. 22} come to pass both on earth and aloft. There is one abode called Hlidskjálf, and when Allfather sat in the high-seat there, he looked out over the whole world and saw every man's acts, and knew all things which he sa w. His wife was called Frigg daughter of Fjörgvinn; and of their blood is come that ki ndred which we call th e races of the Æsir, that have peopled the Elder Ásgard, and thos e kingdoms which pertain to it; and that is a divine race. For this reason must he be called Allfather: because he is father of all the gods and of men, and of all th at was fulfilled of him and of his might. The Earth was his daughter and his wife; on her he begot the first son, which is Ása-Thor: strength and prowess attend him, wherewith he overcometh all living things. X. \"Nörfi or Narfi is the name of a giant th at dwelt in Jötunheim: he had a daughter called Night; she was swarthy and dark, as befitted her race. She was given to the man named Naglfari; their son was Audr. Afterward she was wedded to him that was called Annarr; Jörd[1] was their daughter. Last of all Dayspri ng had her, and he was of the race of the Æsir; their son was Day: he was radiant and fair after his father. Then Allfather took Night, and Day her son, and gave to them tw o horses and two chario ts, and sent them up into the heavens, to ride round about the ea rth every two half-days. Night rides before with the horse named Frosty-Mane, and on each morning he bedews the earth with the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"foam from his bit. The horse that Day has is called Sheen-Mane, and he illumines all the air and the earth from his mane.\" [1. Earth.] {p. 23} XI. Then said Gangleri: \"How does he govern the course of the sun or of the moon?\" Hárr answered: \"A certa in man was named Mundilfari, w ho had two children; they were so fair and comely that he called his s on Moon, and his daughter Sun, and wedded her to the man called Glenr. But the gods were incense d at that insolence, and took the brother and sister, and set them up in the heavens; they caused S un to drive those horses that drew the chariot of the sun, which the gods had fashioned, for the world's illumination, from that glowing stuff which flew out of Múspellheim. Those horses are called thus: Early-Wake and All-Strong; and under the shou lders of the horses the gods set two wind- bags to cool them, but in some records th at is called 'iron-coolness.' Moon steers the course of the moon, and determines its wa xing and waning. He took from the earth-two children, called Bil and Hjúki, they that went from the well called Byrgir, bearing on their shoulders the cask called Sægr, and the pole Simu l. Their father is named Vidfinnr. These children follow Moon, as may be seen from the earth.\" XII. Then said Gangleri: \"The sun fares swif tly, and almost as if she were afraid: she could not hasten her course a ny the more if she f eared her destruction.\" Then Hárr made answer: \"It is no marvel that she hastens furi ously: close cometh he that seeks her, and she has no escape save to run away.\" Then said Gangleri: \"Who is he that causes her this disquiet?\" Hárr replied: \"It is two wolves; a nd he that runs after her is called Skoll; she fears him, and he shall take her. But he that leaps before her is called Hati Hródvitnisson. He is eager to seize the moon; and so it must be.\" Then said Gangleri: \"What is the race of the {p. 24} wolves?\" Hárr answered: \"A witch dwells to the east of Midgard, in the forest called Ironwood: in that wood dwe ll the troll-women, who are known as Ironwood-Women. The old witch bears many giants for sons, and all in the shape of wolves; and from this source are these wolves sprung. The saying runs thus: fr om this race shall come one that shall be mightiest of all, he that is named Moon-Hound; he shall be filled with the flesh of all those men that die, and he shall swallow th e moon, and sprinkle with blood the heavens and all the lair; thereof-shall the sun lose her shining, and the winds in that day shall be unquiet and roar on every side. So it says in Völuspá : Eastward dwells the Old One | in Ironwood, And there gives birth | to Fenrir's brethren; There shall spring of th em all | a certain one, The moon's taker | in troll's likeness."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"He is filled with flesh | of fey men. Reddens the gods' seats | with ruddy blood-gouts; Swart becomes sunshine | in summers after, The weather all shifty. | Wit ye yet, or what?\" XIII. Then said Gangleri: \"What is the way to heaven from earth?\" Then Hárr answered, and laughed aloud: \"Now, that is not wisely asked; has it not b een told thee, that the gods made a bridge from earth, to heaven, called Bifröst? Thou must have seen it; it may be that ye call it rainbow.' It is of three colors, and very strong, and made with cunning and with more magic art than othe r works of craftsmanship. But strong as it is, yet must it be broken, when the sons of Múspell shall go forth harrying {p. 25} and ride it, and swim their hor ses over great rivers; thus they shall proceed.\" Then said Gangleri: \"To my thinking the gods did not bui ld the bridge honestl y, seeing that it could be broken, and they able to make it as they would.\" Then Hárr replied: \"The gods are not deserving of reproof because of this work of skill: a good bridge is Bifröst, but nothing in this world is of such nature that it ma y be relied on when the sons of Múspell go a- harrying.\" XIV. Then said Gangleri: \"What did Allfat her then do when Ásgard was made?\" Hárr answered: \"In the beginning he established rulers, and bade them ordain fates with him, and give counsel concerning the planning of the town; that was in the place which is called Ida-field, in the midst of the town. It was their first work to make that court in which their twelve seats stand, and another, the high-seat which Allfather himself has. That house is the best-made of any on earth, and the greatest; without a nd within, it is all like one piece of gold; men call it Gladsheim. They made also a second hall: that was a shrine which the goddesses had, and it was a very fair house; men call it Vingólf. Next they fashioned a house, wherein they placed a forge, and made besides a hammer, tongs, and anvil, and by means of these, all other t ools. After this they smithied metal and stone and wood, and wrought so abundantly that metal which is called gold, that they had all their household ware and all di shes of gold; and that time is called the Age of Gold, before it was spoiled by the coming of the Women, even those who came out of Jötunheim. Next after this, the gods enthr oned themselves in their seats and held judgment, and called to mind whence the dwarves had quickened in the mould and underneath in the {p. 26} earth, even as do maggots in flesh. The dwarve s had first received shape and life in the flesh of Ymir, and were then maggots; but by decree of the gods had become conscious with the intelligence of men, and had human sh ape. And nevertheless they dwell in the earth and in stones. Módsognir was the firs t, and Durinn the second; so it says in Völuspá ."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Then strode all the mighty | to the seats of judgment, The gods most holy, | and together held counsel, Who should of dwarves | shape the peoples From the bloody surge | and the Blue One's bones.

And these, says the Sibyl, are their names: Nýi and Nidi, | Nordri and Sudri, Austri, Vestri, | Althjófr, Dvalinn; Nár, Náinn, | Nípingr, Dáinn, Bifurr, Báfurr, | Bömburr, Nóri, Óri, Ónarr, | Óinn, Mjödvitnir, Viggr and Gandálfr, | Vindálfr, Thorinn, Fíli, Kíli, | Fundinn, Váli; Thrór, Thróinn, | Thekkr, Litr and Vitr, Nýr, Nýrádr, | Rekkr, Rádsvidr.

Then said Gangleri: \"Where is the chie f abode or holy place of the gods?\" Hárr answered: 'That is at the Ash of Yggdrasill; there the gods mu st give judgment everyday.\" Then Gangleri asked: \"What is to be said concerning that place?\" Then said Jafnhárr: \"The Ash is greatest of all tr ees and best: its limbs spread out over all the world and stand above heaven. Three roots of the tree uphol d it and stand exceeding broad: one is among the Æsir; another among the Rime-Giants, in that place where aforetime was the Yawning Void; the third stands over Niflheim , and under that root is Hvergelmir, and Nídhöggr gnaws the root from below. But under that root which turns toward the Rime- Giants is Mímir's Well, wherein wisdom and understanding are stored ; and he is called Mímir, who keeps the well. He is full of ancien t lore, since he drinks of the well from the Gjallar-Horn. Thither came Allf ather and craved one drink of the well; but he got it not until he had laid his eye in pledge. So says Völuspá :"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"All know I, Odin, | where the eye thou hiddest, In the wide-renowned | well of Mímir; Mímir drinks mead | every morning From Valfather's wage. | Wit ye yet, or what? The third root of the Ash st ands in heaven; and under {p. 28} that root is the well which is very holy, that is called the Well of Urdr; there the gods hold their tribunal. Each day the Æsi r ride thither up over Bifrös t, which is also called the Æsir's Bridge. These are the names of the Æsir' s steeds: Sleipnir[1] is best, which Odin has; he has eight feet. The s econd is Gladr,[2] the third Gyllir,[3] the fourth Glenr,[4] the fifth Skeidbrimir,[5] the sixth Silfrintoppr,[6] the seventh Sini r,[7] the eighth Gisl,[8] the ninth Falhófnir,[9] the tenth.

There are many fair places in heaven, and over everything there a godlike watch is ke pt. A hall stands there, fair, under the ash by the well, and out of that hall come th ree maids, who are called thus: Urdr,[12] Verdandi,[13] Skuld;[14] these maids determ ine the period of men's lives: we call them [1.

Then said Gangleri: \"What more mighty wo nders are to be told of the Ash?\" Hárr replied: \"Much is to be told of it.

The squirrel calle d Ratatöskr runs up and down the length of the Ash, bearing envious words between the eagle and Nídhöggr; and four harts run in the limbs of the Ash and bite the leaves. They are called thus: Dáinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr, Durathrór. Moreover, so many serpents are in Hvergelm ir with Nídhöggr, that no tongue can tell them, as is here said: Ash Yggdrasill | suffers anguish, More than men know of: {p. 30} The stag bites above; | on the side it rotteth, And Nídhöggr gnaws from below. And it is further said:"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"More serpents lie | under Yggdrasill's stock Than every unwise ape can think: Góinn and Móinn | (they're Grafvitnir's sons), Grábakr and Grafvölludr; Ófnir and Sváfnir | I think shall aye Tear the trunk's twigs. It is further said that thes e Norns who dwell by the Well of Urdr take water of the well every day, and with it th at clay which lies about the well, and sprinkle it over the Ash, to the end that its limbs shall not wither nor rot; for that water is so holy that all things which come there into the well become as wh ite as the film which lies within the egg- shell,--as is here said: I know an Ash standing | called Yggdrasill, A high tree sprinkled | w ith snow-white clay; Thence come the dews | in the dale that fall-- It stands ever green | above Urdr's Well.

Then said Gangleri: \"Thou knowest many tid ings to tell of the heaven. What chief abodes are there more than at Urdr's We ll?\" Hárr said: \"Many places are there, {p. 31} and glorious. That which is called Álfheimr [1] is one, where dwell the peoples called Light-Elves; but the Dark-Elves dwell dow n in the earth, and they are unlike in appearance, but by far more unlike in nature. The Light-Elves are fa irer to look upon than the sun, but the Dark-Elves are blacker than p itch. Then there is also in that place the abode called Breidablik,[2] and there is not in heaven a fairer dwelling. There, too, is the one called Glitnir,[3] whose walls, and all its posts and pillars, are of red gold, but its roof of silver. There is also the abode called Himinbjörg;[4] it st ands at heaven's end by the bridge-head, in the place where Bifröst joins h eaven. Another great abode is there, which is named Valaskjálf;[5] Odin possesses that dwelling; the gods made it and thatched it with sheer silver, and in this hall is the H lidskjálf,[6] the high-seat so called. Whenever Allfather sits in that seat, he surveys all lands . At the southern end of heaven is that hall which is fairest of all, and brighter than the su n; it is called Gimlé.[7] It shall stand when both heaven and earth have departed; and good men and of righteous conversation shall dwell therein: so it is said in Völuspá .-- A hall I know standing | than the sun fairer, Thatched with gold | in Gimlé bright; There shall dwell | the doers of righteousness And ever and ever | enjoy delight.\""},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Then said Gangleri: \"What shall guard this place, when the flame of Surtr shall consume heaven and earth?\" Hárr [1.

It is strong, so that it stirs great seas, and it swells fire; but, strong as it is , none may see it, for it is wonderfully shapen.\" Then said Hárr: \"That I am well able to tell th ee. At the northward end of heaven sits the giant called Hræsvelgr: he has the plumes of an eagle, and when he stretches his wings for flight, then the wind rises from under his wings, as is here said: Hræsvelgr hight he | who sits at heaven's ending, Giant in eagle's coat; From his wings, they say, | the wind cometh All men-folk over.\" XIX. Then said Gangleri: \"Why is there so mu ch difference, that summer should be hot, but winter cold?\" Hárr answered: \"A wise man would not ask thus, seei ng that all are able to tell this; but if thou alone art become-so slight of understa nding as not to have heard it, then I will yet permit that thou shouldst rather ask foolishly once, than that thou shouldst be kept longer in ignorance of a thing which it is proper to know.

But it is briefest to tell thee that most of his names have been given him by r eason of this chance: there being so many branches of tongues in the worl d, all peoples believed that it was needful for them to turn his name into their own tongue, by which th ey might the better invoke him and entreat him on their own [1. Literally, to ra ke into rows.] {p. 35} behalf. But some occasions for these names arose in his wanderings; and that matter is recorded in tales. Nor canst thou ever be called a wise man if thou shalt not be able to tell of those great events.\" XXI. Then said Gangleri: \"What are the names of the other Æsir, or wh at is their office, or what deeds of renown have they done?\" Hárr answered: \"Thor is the foremost of them, he that is called Thor of th e Æsir, or Öku-Thor; he is str ongest of all the gods and men.

Thor has two he-goats, that are called Toot h-Gnasher and Tooth-Gritter, and a chariot wherein he drives, and the he-goa ts draw the chariot; therefor e is he called Öku-Thor.[3] He has also three things of great price: one is the ha mmer Mjöllnir, which the Rime- Giants and the Hill-Giants know, when it is raised on high; a nd that is no wonder, it has bruised many a skull among their fathers or th eir kinsmen. He has a second costly thing, best of all: the [1. Plains of strength."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"2. From the flashing of light (Cl.-Vig.). 3.

Yet a third thing he has, in which there is much virtue: his iron gloves; he cannot do without them when he uses his hammer-shaft. But no one is so wise that he can tell all his mighty works; yet I can tell th ee so much tidings of him that the hours would be spent before all that I know were told.\" XXII. Then said Gangleri: \"I would ask tidings of more Æsir.\" Hárr replied: \"The second son of Odin is Baldr, and good things are to be said of him. He is best, and all praise him; he is so fair of feature, and so bright, that light shines from him. A certain herb is so white that it is likened to Ba ldr's brow; of all grasses it is whitest, and by it thou mayest judge his fairness, both in hair and in body. He is the wisest of the Æsir, and the fairest- spoken and most gracious; a nd that quality attends him, that none may gainsay his judgments. He dwells in the place called Breida blik,[1] which is in heaven; in that place may nothing unclean be, even as is said here: Breidablik 't is called, | where Baldr has A hall made for himself: In that land | where I know lie Fewest baneful runes. XXIII. \"The third among the Æsir is he that is called Njördr: he dwells in heaven, in the abode called Nóatún. He rules the course of th e wind, and stills sea and fire; on him shall men call for voyages and for hunting. He is so [1. Broad-gleaming.] {p. 37} prosperous and abounding in wea lth, that he may give them great plenty of lands or of gear; and him shall men invoke for such things. Njördr is not of the race of the Æsir: he was reared in the land of the Vanir, but the Vanir delivered him as hostage to the gods, and took for hostage in exchange him that men call Hœnir; he became an atonement between the gods and the Vanir. Njördr has to wife the woman called Skadi, daughter of Thjazi the giant. Skadi would fain dwell in the abode which her father had had, which is on certain mountains, in the place called Thry mheimr; but Njördr would be near the sea. They made a compact on these terms: they s hould be nine nights in Thrymheimr, but the second nine at Nóatún. But when Njördr cam e down from the mountain back to Nóatún, he sang this lay:"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Loath were the hills to me, | I was not long in them, Nights only nine; To me the wailing of | wolves seemed ill, After the song of swans. Then Skadi sang this: Sleep could I never | on the sea-beds, For the wailing of waterfowl; He wakens me, | who comes from the deep-- The sea-mew every morn. Then Skadi went up onto the mountain, and dw elt in Thrymheimr. And she goes for the more part on snowshoes and with a bow a nd arrow, and shoots beasts; she is called Snowshoe-Goddess or Lady of the Snowshoes. So it is said: {p. 38} Thrymheimr 't is called, | where Thjazi dwelt, He the hideous giant; But now Skadi abides, | pure bride of the gods, In her father's ancient freehold. XXIV. \"Njördr in Nóatún begot afterward two children: the son was called Freyr, and the daughter Freyja; they were fair of face a nd mighty. Freyr is the most renowned of the Æsir; he rules over the rain and the shining of the sun, and therewithal the fruit of the earth; and it is good to call on him for fruitf ul seasons and peace. He governs also the prosperity of men. But Freyja is the most renowned of th e goddesses; she has in heaven the dwelling called Fólkvangr,[1] and wheresoe ver she rides to the strife, she has one-half of the kill, and Odin half, as is here said: Fólkvangr 't is called, | where Freyja rules Degrees of seats in the hall; Half the kill | she keepeth each day, And half Odin hath. Her hall Sessrúmnir[2] is great and fair. When she goes forth, she drives her cats and sits in a chariot; she is most conformable to man's prayers, and from her name comes the name of honor, Frú, by which noblewomen are called. Songs of love are well-pleasing to her; it is good to call on her for furtherance in love.\" XXV. Then said Gangleri: \"Great in power do th ese Æsir seem to me; nor is it a marvel, that much authority attends you who are said to possess understanding of the gods, and know which one men should call on for what [1. Folk-plain, Host-plain."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"2. Seat-roomy.] {p. 39} boon soever. Or are the gods yet more?\" Hárr sa id: \"Yet remains that one of the Æsir who is called Týr: he is most daring, and best in stoutness of heart, and he has much authority over victory in battle; it is good for men of valo r to invoke him. It is a proverb, that he is Týr-valiant, who surpasses other men and does not waver. He is wise, so that it is also said, that he that is wisest is Týr-prudent. This is one toke n of his daring: when the Æsir enticed Fenris-Wolf to take upon him the fette r Gleipnir, the wolf did not believe them, that they would loose him, until they laid Tý r's hand into his mouth as a pledge. But when the Æsir would not loose him, then he bit off the hand at the place now called 'the wolf's joint;' and Týr is one-handed, and is not called a r econciler of men. XXVI. \"One is called Bragi: he is renowned fo r wisdom, and most of all for fluency of speech and skill with words. He knows most of skaldship, and after him skaldship is called bragr ,[1] and from his name that one is called bragr -man or -woman, who possesses eloquence surpassing others, of wome n or of men. His wife is Idunn: she guards in her chest of ash those apples whic h the gods must taste whensoever they grow old; and then they all become young, and so it shall be even unto the Weird of the Gods.\" Then said Gangleri: \"A very great thing, meth inks, the gods entrust to the watchfulness and good faith of Idunn.\" Then said Hárr, laugh ing loudly: \"'T was n ear being desperate once; I may be able to tell th ee of it, but now thou shalt firs t hear more of the names of the Æsir. [1. Bragr , as a noun, means \"poetry\" as an adjective, it seems to mean \"foremost\" (Cl.-Vig.). Thus the phrase bragr karla seems to be \"foremost of men,\" with apparent reference to poetic preëminence.] {p. 40} XXVII. \"Heimdallr is the name of one: he is called the White God. He is great and holy; nine maids, all sisters, bore him for a son. He is also called Hallinskídi[1] and Gullintanni;[2] his teeth were of gold, and his horse is called Gold-t op. He dwells in the place called Himinbjörg,[3] hard by Bifröst: he is the warder of the gods, and sits there by heaven's end to guard the bridge from the Hill -Giants. He needs less sleep than a bird; he sees equally well night and da y a hundred leagues from him, and hears how grass grows on the earth or wool on sheep, and everyt hing that has a louder sound. He has that trumpet which is called Gjallar-Horn, and its blast is heard throughout all worlds. Heimdallr's sword is called Head. It is said further: Himinbjörg 't is called, | where Heimdallr, they say, Aye has his housing; There the gods' sentinel | drinks in his snug hall Gladly good mead.

He is of sufficient strength, but the gods would desire that no occasion should ri se of naming this god, for the work of his hands shall long be held in memory among gods and men. XXIX. \"Vídarr is the name of one, the silent god. He has [1. Ram (Cl.-Vig.). 2. Golden-teeth. 3. Heaven-fells.] {p. 41} a thick shoe. He is nearly as strong as T hor; in him the gods have great trust in all struggles. XXX. \"One is called Áli or Váli, son of Odin and Rindr: he is daring in fights, and a most fortunate marksman. XXXI. \"One is called Ullr, son of Sif, step-s on of Thor; he is so excellent a bowman, and so swift on snowshoes, that none may contend with him. He is also fair of aspect and has the accomplishments of a warrior; it is we ll to call on him in single-combats. XXXII. \"Forseti is the name of the son of Ba ldr and Nanna daughter of Nep: he has that hall in heaven which is called Glitnir. All that come to him with such quarrels as arise out of law-suits, all these return thence reconcile d. That is the best se at of judgment among gods and men; thus it is said here: A hall is called Glitnir, | w ith gold 't is pillared, And with silver thatched the same; There Forseti bides | the full day through, And puts to sleep all suits. XXXIII. \"Also numbered among the Æsir is he whom some call the mischief-monger of the Æsir, and the first father of falsehoods, and blemish of all gods and men: he is named Loki or Loptr, son of Fárbauti the giant; his mother was Laufey or Nál; his brothers are Býleistr and Helblindi. Loki is beautiful a nd comely to look upon, evil in spirit., very fickle in habit. He surpassed other men in that wisdom which is called 'sleight,' and had artifices for {p. 42}"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"all occasions; he would ever br ing the Æsir into great hardsh ips, and then get them out with crafty counsel. His wife was cal led Sigyn, their son Nari or Narfi. XXXIV. Yet more children had Loki. Angrboda was the name of a certain giantess in Jötunheim, with whom Loki gat three children: one wa s Fenris-Wolf, the second Jörmungandr--that is the Midgard Serpent,--th e third is Hel. But when the gods learned that this kindred was nourished in Jötunhe im, and when the gods perceived by prophecy that from this kindred great misfortune shoul d befall them; and since it seemed to all that there was great prospect of ill--(first from the mother's blood, and yet worse from the father's)-then Allfather sent gods thither to take the children and bring them to him. When they came to him, straightway he cast the serpent into the deep sea, where he lies about all the land; and this serpent grew so great ly that he lies in the midst of the ocean encompassing all the land, and bites upon his ow n tail. Hel he cast into Niflheim, and gave to her power over nine worlds, to apportio n all abodes among those that were sent to her: that is, men dead of sic kness or of old age. She has gr eat possessions there; her walls are exceeding high and her gates great. Her ha ll is called Sleet-Cold; her dish, Hunger; Famine is her knife; Idler, her thrall; Sl oven, her maidservant; Pit of Stumbling, her threshold, by which one enters; Disease, he r bed; Gleaming Bale, her bed-hangings. She is half blue-black and half flesh-color (by which she is easily recognized), and very lowering and fierce. The Wolf the Æsir brought up at home, and Tý r alone dared go to him to give him meat. But when the gods saw. how much he gr ew every day, and when all prophecies {p. 43} declared that he was fated to be their dest ruction, then the Æsir se ized upon this way of escape: they made a very strong fetter, whic h they called Lædingr, and brought it before the Wolf, bidding him try his strength agai nst the fetter. The Wolf thought that no overwhelming odds, and let them do with him as they would. The first time the Wolf lashed out against it, the fetter broke; so he was loosed out of Lædingr. After this, the Æsir made a second fetter, stronger by half, which they called Drómi, and bade the Wolf try that fetter, saying he would become very famous for strength, if such huge workmanship should not suffice to hold him. But the Wolf thought that this fetter was very strong; he considered al so that strength had increased in him since the time he broke Lædingr: it came into his mind, that he must expose himself to danger, if he would become famous. So he let the fetter be laid upon him. Now when the Æsir declared themselves ready, the Wolf shook himself, dashed the fetter against the earth and struggled fiercely with it, spur ned against it, and broke the fetter, so that the fragments flew far. So he dashed himself out of Drómi. Since then it passes as a proverb, 'to loose out of Lædingr,' or 'to dash out of Drómi,' when anything is exceeding hard. \"After that the Æsir feared that they shoul d never be able to get the Wolf bound. Then Allfather sent him who is called Skírnir, Fr eyr's messenger, down into the region of the Black Elves, to certain dwarves, and caused to be made the fetter named Gleipnir. It was made of six things: the noise a cat makes in foot-fall, the beard of a woman, the roots of a"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"rock, the sinews of a bear, the breath of a fi sh, and the spittle of a bird. And though thou understand not these matters already, yet now thou mayest speedily find {p. 44} certain proof herein, that no lie is told th ee: thou must have seen that a woman has no beard, and no sound comes from the leap of a cat, and there are no roots under a rock; and by my troth, all that I have told thee is equally true, though there be some things which thou canst not put to the test.\" Then said Gangleri: \"This certain ly I can perceive to be true : these things which thou hast taken for proof, I can see; but how was the fetter fashioned?\" Hárr answered: \"That I am well able to tell thee. The fetter was soft a nd smooth as a silken ribbon, but as sure and strong as thou shalt now hear. Then, when the fetter was brought to the Æsir, they thanked the messenger well for his errand. Then the Æsir went out upon the lake called Ámsvartnir, to the island called Lyngvi, and summoning the Wolf with them, they showed him the silken ribbon and bade him burst it, saying that it was somewhat stouter than appeared from its thickness. And each passed it to the others, and tested it with the strength of their hands and it di d not snap; yet they said the Wolf could break it. Then the Wolf answered: 'Touching this matter of the ribbon, it seems to me that I shall get no glory of it, though I snap asunde r so slender a band; but if it be made with cunning and wiles, then, though it seem little, that band sh all never come upon my feet.' Then the Æsir answered that he could easily snap apart a slight silken band, he who had before broken great fetters of iron,--'but if t hou shalt not be able to burst this band, then thou wilt not be able to frighten the gods; and then we shall unloose thee.' The Wolf said: 'If ye bind me so that I shall not get free again, then ye will act in such a way that it will be late ere I receive help from you; I am unwilling that this band {p. 45} should be laid upon me. Yet rather than that ye should impugn my courage, let some one of you lay his hand in my mouth, for a pledge th at this is done in good faith.' Each of the Æsir looked at his neighbor, and none was willing to part with his hand, until Týr stretched out his right hand and laid it in the Wolf's mouth. But when the Wolf lashed out, the fetter became hardened; and the more he struggled against it, the tighter the band was. Then all laughed except Týr: he lost his hand. \"When the Æsir saw that the Wolf was fully bound, they took the chain that was fast to the fetter, and which is called Gelgja, and passed it through a great rock--it is called Gjöll--and fixed the rock deep down into the earth. Then they took a great stone and drove it yet deeper into the earth--it was called Thviti--and us ed the stone for a fastening- pin. The Wolf gaped terribly, and thrashed about and strove to bite them; they thrust into his mouth a certain sword: the guards caught in his lower jaw, and the point in the upper; that is his gag. He howls hide ously, and slaver runs out of his mouth: that is the river called Ván; there he lies till the Weird of the Gods.\" Then said Gangleri: 'Marvellous ill children did Loki beget, but all these brethren are of great might. Yet why did not the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Æsir kill the Wolf, seeing they had expectation of evil from him?\" Hárr answered: \"So greatly did the gods esteem their holy place a nd sanctuary, that they would not stain it with the Wolf's blood; though (so say the proph ecies) he shall be the slayer of Odin.\" XXXV. Then said Gangleri: \"Which are the Ásynjur? Hárr said: \"Frigg is the foremost: she has that estate which is called Fensal ir, and it is most glorious. The second is {p. 46} Sága: she dwells at Søkkvabekkr, and that is a gr eat abode. The third is Fir: she is the best physician. The fourth is Gefjun: she is a virgi n, and they that die maidens attend her. The fifth is Fulla: she also is a maid, and goes with loose tresses and a golden band about her head; she bears the ashen coffer of Frigg, a nd has charge over her footgear, and knows her secret counsel. Freyja is most gently bor n (together with Frigg) : she is wedded to the man named Ódr. Their daughter is Hnoss: she is so fair, that those things which are fair and precious are called hnossir . Ódr went away on long journeys, and Freyja weeps for him, and her tears are red gold. Freyja has many names, and this is the cause thereof: that she gave herself sundry names, when she went out among unknown peoples seeking Ódr: she is called Mardöll and Hörn, Gefn, Sýr. Freyja had the necklace Brísinga-men. She is also called Lady of the Vanir. The seventh is Sjöfn: she is most diligent in turning the thoughts of men to love, both of women and of men; and from her name love-longing is called sjafni . The eighth is Lofn: she is so gracious and kindly to those that call upon her, that she wins Allfather's or Frigg's perm ission for the coming together of mankind in marriage, of women and of men, though it were forbidden before, or seem flatly denied; from her name such permission is called 'leave,' and thus also she is much 'loved' of men. The ninth is Vár: she harkens to the oath s and compacts made between men and women; wherefore such covenants are called 'vow s.' She also takes vengeance on those who perjure themselves. The tenth is Vör: she is wi se and of searching sp irit, so that none can conceal anything from her; it is a saying, that a woman becomes 'ware' of that of which she is informed. The eleventh is Syn: she keeps {p. 47} the door in the hall, and locks it before those who should not go in; she is also set at trials as a defence against such suits as she wishes to refute: thence is the expression, that syn [1] is set forward, when a man denies. The twel fth is Hlín: she is established as keeper over those men whom Frigg desires to pres erve from any danger; thence comes the saying, that he who escapes 'lean s.' Snotra is thirteenth: sh e is prudent and of gentle bearing; from her name a woman or a man who is moderate is called snotr .[2] The fourteenth is Gná: her Frigg sends into di vers lands on her errands; she has that horse which runs over sky and sea and is called Hoof-Tosser.

These are called Valkyrs: them Odin sends to every battle; they determine men's feyness and award victory. Gudr and Róta and the youngest Norn, she who is called Skuld, ride ever to take the slain and decide fights. Jörd, the mother of Thor, and Rindr, Váli's mother, are reckoned among the Ásynjur.

It chanced one day that Freyr had gone to Hlidskjálf, and gazed over all the world; but when he looked over into the northern region, he saw on an estate a house great and fair. And toward this house went a woman; when she raised her hands and opened the door before her, brightness gleamed from her hands, both over sky and sea, and all the worlds were illumined of her. Thus his overweening pride, in having presumed to sit in that holy seat, was avenged upon him, that he went away fu ll of sorrow. When he had come home, he spake not, he slept not, he drank not; no man da red speak to him. Then Njördr summoned to him Skírnir, Freyr's foot-page, and bade him go to Freyr and beg speech of him and ask for whose sake he was so bitter that he would not speak with me n. But Skírnir said he would go, albeit unwillingly; {p. 49}"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"and said that evil answers were to be expected of Freyr. \"But when he came to Freyr, straightway he asked why Freyr was so downcast, and spake not with men. Then Freyr answered and said th at he had seen a fair woman; and for her sake he was so full of grief that he would not live long if he were not to obtain her. 'And now thou shalt go and woo her on my behalf and have her hither, whether her father will or no. I will reward thee well for it.' Then Skírnir answered thus: he would go on his errand, but Freyr should give him his own sword --which is so good that it fights of itself;- -and Freyr did not refuse, but gave him the sw ord. Then Skírnir went forth and wooed the woman for him, and received her promise; and nine nights later she was to come to the place called Barrey, and then go to the bridal w ith Freyr. But when Skírnir told Freyr his answer, then he sang this lay: Long is one night, | long is the second; How can I wait through three? Often a month | to me seemed less Than this one night of waiting. This was to blame for Freyr's being so wea ponless, when he fought with Beli, and slew him with the horn of a hart.\" Then said Gangler i: \"'T is much to be wondered at, that such a great chief as Freyr is w ould give away his sword, not having another equally good. It was a great privation to him, when he fought with him called Beli; by my faith, he must have rued that gift.\" Then answered Hárr: \"There was sma ll matter in that, when he and Beli met; Freyr could have killed him with his hand. It shall come to pass {p. 50} that Freyr will think a worse thing has come upon him, when he misses his sword on that day that the Sons of Múspell go a-harrying.\" XXXVIII. Then said Gangleri: \"Thou sayest that all those men who have fallen in battle from the beginning of the world are now come to Odin in Valhall. What has he to give them for food? I should think that a very grea t host must be there.\" Then Hárr answered: \"That which thou sayest is true: a very mighty multitude is there, but many more shall be, notwithstanding which it will seem all too sma ll, in the time when the Wolf shall come. But never is so vast a multitude in Valhall th at the flesh of that boar shall fail, which s called Sæhrímnir; he is boiled every day and is whole at evening. But this question which thou askest now: I think it likeli er that few may be so wise as to be able to report truthfully concerning it. His name who roasts is Andhrímnir, and the kettle is Eldhrímnir; so it is said here: Andhrímnir | has in Eldhrímnir Sæhrímnir sodden, Best of hams; | yet how few know With what food the champions are fed.\""},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Then said Gangleri: \"Has Odin the same fa re as the champions?\" Hárr answered: \"That food which stands on his board he gives to tw o wolves which he has, called Geri[1] and Freki;[2] but no food does he need; wine is bo th food and drink to him; so it says here: [1. Ravener. 2. Glutton, greedy.] {p. 51} Geri and Freki | the war-mighty glutteth, The glorious God of Hosts; But on wine alone | the weapon-glorious Odin aye liveth. The ravens sit on his shoulders and say into hi s ear all the tidings which they see or hear; they are called thus: Huginn[1] and Muninn.[2] He sends them at day-break to fly about all the world, and they come back at unde rn-meal; thus he is acquainted with many tidings. Therefore men call him Raven-God, as is said: Huginn and Muninn hover each day The wide earth over; I fear for Huginn lest he fare not back,-- Yet watch I more for Muninn.\" XXXIX. Then said Gangleri: \"What have the champions to drink, that may suffice them as abundantly as the food? Or is water drunk there?\"' Then said Hárr: \"Now thou askest strangely; as if Allfat her would invite to him kings or earls or other men of might and would give them water to drink! I know, by my faith! that many a man comes to Valhall who would think he had bought his drink of water dearly, if there were not better cheer to be had there, he who before had suffered wounds and burning pain unto death. I can tell thee a different tale of this. The she-goat, sh e who is called Heidrún, stands up in Valhall and bites the needles from the limb of that tree which is very famous, and is called Lærádr; and from her udders mead runs so c opiously, that she fills a tun every day. That tun is so great [1. Thought. 2. Memory.] {p. 52} that all the champions become quite drunk fr om it.\" Then said Gangleri: \"That is a wondrous proper goat for them; it must be an exceeding good tree from which she eats.\" Then spake Hárr: \"Even more worthy of note is the hart Eikthyrni, which stands in Valhall and bites from the limbs of the tr ee; and from his horns distils such abundant exudation that it comes down into Hvergelmir , and from thence fall those rivers called thus: Síd, Víd, Søkin, Eikin, Svöl, Gunnthrá, Fjörm, Fimbulthul, Gípul, Göpul, Gömul,"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Geirvimul. Those fall about the abodes of the Æsir; these also are recorded: Thyn, Vín, Thöll, Höll, Grád, Gunnthráin, Nyt, Nö t, Nönn, Hrönn, Vína, Vegsvinn, Thjódnuma.\" XL. Then said Gangleri: \"These are marv ellous tidings which thou now tellest. A wondrous great house Valhall must be; it must often be exceeding crowded before the doors.\" Then Hárr answered: \"Why dost thou not ask how many doors there are in the hall, or how great? If thou hearest that told, then thou wilt say that it is strange indeed if whosoever will may not go out and in; but it may be said truly that it is no more crowded to find place therein than to enter into it; here thou mayest read in Grímnismál : Five hundred doors | and forty more So I deem stand in Valhall; Eight hundred champions | go out at each door When they fare to fight with the Wolf.\" XLI. Then said Gangleri: \"A very mighty multitude of men is in Valhall, so that, by my faith, Odin is a very great {p. 53} chieftain, since he commands so large an army. Now what is the sport of the champions, when they are not fighting?\" Hárr replied: \"E very day, as soon as they are clothed, they straightway put on their armor and go out into the court and fight, and fell each other. That is their sport; and when the time dr aws near to undern-meal, they ride home to Valhall and sit down to dri nk, even as is said here: All the Einherjar | in Odin's court Deal out blows every day; The slain they choose | a nd ride from the strife, Sit later in love together. But what thou hast said is true: Odin is of great might. Many examples are found in proof of this, as is here said in the words of the Æsir themselves: Ash Yggdrasill's trunk | of trees is foremost, And Skídbladnir of ships; Odin of Æsir, | of all steeds Sleipnir, Bifröst of bridges, | and Bragi of skalds; Hábrók of hawks, | and of hounds Garmr.\" XLII. Then said Gangleri: \"Who owns that horse Sleipnir, or what is to be said of him?\" Hárr answered: \"Thou hast no knowledge of Sl eipnir's points, and thou knowest not the circumstances of his begetting; but it will se em to thee worth the telling. It was early in the first days of the gods' dwelling here, wh en the gods had established the Midgard and made Valhall; there came at that time a certain wright and offered to build them a citadel"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"in three seasons, so good that it should be st aunch and proof against the Hill-Giants and the Rime-Giants, though they should {p. 54} come in over Midgard. But he demanded as wages that he should have possession of Freyja, and would fain have had the sun a nd the moon. Then the Æsir held parley and took counsel together; and a bargain was made w ith the wright, that he should have that which he demanded, if he should succeed in co mpleting the citadel in one winter. On the first day of summer, if any part of the cita del were left unfinished, he should lose his reward; and he was to receive help from no ma n in the work. When they told him these conditions, he asked that they would give him leave to have the help of his stallion, which was called Svadilfari; and Loki advised it, so that the wright's petition was granted. He set to work the first day of wi nter to make the citadel, and by night he hauled stones with the stallion's aid; and it seemed very marvell ous to the Æsir what great rocks that horse drew, for the horse did more rough work by ha lf than did the wright. But there were strong witnesses to thei r bargain, and many oaths, since it seemed unsafe to the giant to be among the Æsir without truce, if Thor should come home. But Thor had then gone away into the eastern region to fight trolls. \"Now when the winter drew nigh unto its end, the building of the citadel was far advanced; and it was so high and strong that it could not be taken. When it lacked three days of summer, the work had almost reach ed the gate of the stronghold. Then the gods sat down in their judgment seats, and sought means of evasion, and asked one another who had advised giving Freyja in to Jötunheim, or so destroying the air and the heaven as to take thence the sun and the moon and give them to the giants. The gods agreed that he must have counselled this who is wont to give evil advice, Loki Laufeyarson, and they declared {p. 55} him deserving of an ill death, if he could not hit upon a way of losing the wright his wages; and they threatened Loki with violence. But when he became frightened, then he swore oaths, that he would so contrive that the wright should lose his wages, cost him what it might. \"That same evening, when the wright drove ou t after stone with the stallion Svadilfari, a mare bounded forth from a certain wood and whinnied to him. The stallion, perceiving what manner of horse this was, straightwa y became frantic, and snapped the traces asunder, and leaped over to the mare, and sh e away to the wood, a nd the wright after, striving to seize the stallion. Th ese horses ran all night, and th e wright stopped there that night; and afterward, at day, the work was not done as it had been before. When the wright saw that the work could not be brought to an end, he fell into giant's fury. Now that the Æsir saw surely that the hill-giant was come thither , they did not regard their oaths reverently, but called on Thor, who came as quickly. A nd straightway the hammer Mjöllnir was"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"raised aloft; he paid the wri ght's wage, and not with the sun and the moon. Nay, he even denied him dwelling in Jötunheim, and struck bu t the one first blow, so that his skull was burst into small crumbs, and sent him dow n bellow under Niflhel. But Loki had such dealings with Svadilfari, that somewhat later he gave birth to a foal, which was gray and had eight feet; and this horse is the best among gods and men. So is said in Völuspá : Then all the Powers strode | to the seats of judgment, The most holy gods | council held together: Who had the air all | with evil envenomed, Or to the Ettin-race | Ódr's maid given. {p. 56} Broken were oaths then, | bond and swearing, Pledges all sacred | wh ich passed between them; Thor alone smote there, | swollen with anger: He seldom sits still | when such he hears of.\" XLIII. Then said Gangleri: \"What is to be said of Skídbladnir, that whic h is best of ships? Is there no ship equally great?\" Hárr replied: \"Skídbladnir is best of ships and made with most skill of craftsmanship; but Naglfar is the largest ship; Múspell has it. Certain dwarves, sons of Ívaldi, made Sk ídbladnir and gave the ship to Fr eyr. It is so great that all the Æsir may man it, with their weapons a nd armaments, and it has a favoring wind as soon as the sail is hoisted, whithersoever it is bound; but when there is no occasion for going to sea in it, it is made of so many things and with so mu ch cunning that then it may be folded together like a na pkin and kept in one's pouch.\" XLIV. Then spake Gangleri: \"'A good ship is Skídbladnir, but very great magic must have been used upon it before it got to be so fashioned. Has Thor never experienced such a thing, that he has found in his path somewhat so mighty or so powerful that it has overmatched him through strength of magic? \" Then said Hárr: \"Few men, I ween, are able to tell of this; yet many a thing has seemed to him hard to overcome. Though there may have been something so powerful or st rong that Thor might not have succeeded in winning the victory, yet it is not necessary to speak of it; because there are many examples to prove, and because all are bound to believe, that Thor is mightiest.\" Then said Gangleri: \"It seems to me that I must have asked you touching this matter what no one is able {p. 57} to tell of. Then spake Jafnhárr: \"We have h eard say concerning some matters which seem to us incredible, but here sits one near at hand who will know how to tell true tidings of this. Therefore thou must believe that he will not lie for the first time now, who never lied before.\" Gangleri said: \"Here wi ll I stand and listen, if any an swer is forthcoming to this word; but otherwise I pronounce you overcome, if ye cannot tell that which I ask you.\""},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Then spake Thridi: \"Now it is evident that he is resolved to know this matter, though it seem not to us a pleasant thing to tell. This is the beginning of this tale: Öku-Thor drove forth with his he-goats and chariot, and w ith him that Ás called Loki; they came at evening to a husbandman's, and there receiv ed a night's lodging. About evening, Thor took his he-goats and slaughtered them both; af ter that they were flayed and borne to the caldron. When the cooking was done, then Thor and his companion sat down to supper. Thor invited to meat with him the husbandman and his wife, and their children: the husbandman's son was called Thjálfi, and the da ughter Röskva. Then Thor laid the goat- hides farther away from the fire, and said that the husbandman a nd his servants should cast the bones on the go at-hides. Thjálfi, the husbandman 's son, was holding a thigh-bone of the goat, and split it with hi s knife and broke it for the marrow. \"Thor tarried there ov ernight; and in the interval befo re day he rose up and clothed himself, took the hammer Mjöllnir, swung it up, and hallowed the goat-hides; straightway the he-goats rose up, and then one of them was lame in a hind leg. Thor discovered this, and declared that the husbandman or his house hold could not have dealt wisely with the bones of the goat: be knew that the thighbone {p. 58} was broken. There is no need to make a long story of it; all may know how frightened the husbandman must have been when he saw how Thor let his brows sink down before his eyes; but when he looked at the eyes, then it seemed to him that he must fall down before their glances alone. Thor clenched his hands on the hammer-shaft so that the knuckles whitened; and the husbandman and all his house hold did what was to be expected: they cried out lustily, prayed for peace, offered in recompense all that they had. But when he saw their terror, then the fury departed from him, and he became appeased, and took of them in atonement their children, Thjá lfi and Röskva, who then became his bond- servants; and they follow him ever since. XLV. \"Thereupon he left his goats behind, and began his journey eastward toward Jötunheim and clear to the sea; and then he went out over the sea, that deep one; but when he came to land, he went up, and Loki and Thjálfi and Röskva with him. Then, when they had walked a little while, there st ood before them a great forest; they walked all that day till dark. Thjálfi was swiftest-foot ed of all men; he bore Thor's bag, but there was nothing good for food. As soon as it had become dark, they sought themselves shelter for the night, and found before them a certain hall, very great: there was a door in the end, of equal width with the hall, wherein they took up quarters for the night. But about midnight there came a great earthquake: the earth rocked under them exceedingly, and the house trembled. Then Thor rose up and called to his companions, and they explored farther, and found in the middle of the hall a side-chamb er on the right hand, and they went in {p. 59}"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"thither. Thor sat down in the doorway, but the ot hers were farther in from him, and they were afraid; but Thor grippe d his hammer-shaft and thought to defend himself. Then they heard a great humming sound, and a crashing. \"But when it drew near dawn, then Thor went out and saw a man lying a little way from him in the wood; and that man was not sma ll; he slept and snored mightily. Then Thor thought he could perceive wh at kind of noise it was whic h they had heard during the night. He girded himself with his belt of st rength, and his divine pow er waxed; and on the instant the man awoke and rose up swiftly; and then, it is sai d, the first time Thor's heart failed him, to strike him with the hammer. He asked him his name, and the man called himself Skrýmir,--'but I have no need,' he sa id, 'to ask thee for thy name; I know that thou art Ása-Thor. But what? Hast thou dragged. aw ay my glove?' Then Skrýmir stretched out his hand and took up the glove; and at once Thor saw that it was that which he had taken for a hall during the night; and as for the si de-chamber, it was the thumb of the glove. Skrýmir asked whether Thor would have his company, and Thor assented to this. Then Skrýmir took and unloosened his provision wa llet and made ready to eat his morning meal, and Thor and his fellows in another pl ace. Skrýmir then proposed to them to lay their supply of food together, and Thor asse nted. Then Skrýmir bound all the food in one bag and laid it on his own back; he went be fore during the day, and stepped with very great strides; but late in the evening Skrýmir found th em night-quarters under a certain great oak. Then Skrýmir said to Thor that he would lay him down to sleep,--'and do ye take the provision-bag and make ready for your supper.' {p. 60} \"Thereupon Skrýmir slept and snored hard, and Thor took the provision-bag and set about to unloose it; but such things must be told as will seem incredible: he got no knot loosened and no thong-end stirred, so as to be looser than before. When he saw that this work might not avail, then he became a ngered, gripped the hammer Mjöllnir in both hands, and strode with great strides to that place where Skrýmir lay, and smote him in the head. Skrýmir awoke, and asked whether a leaf had fallen upon his head; or whether they had eaten and were ready for bed? Thor replie d that they were just then about to go to sleep; then they went under another oak. It mu st be told thee, that there was then no fearless sleeping. At midnight Thor heard how Skrýmir snored and slept fast, so that it thundered in the woods; then he stood up and went to him, shook his hammer eagerly and hard, and smote down upon the middle of his cr own: he saw that the face of the hammer sank deep into his head. And at that moment Skrýmir awoke arid said: 'What is it now? Did some acorn fall on my head? Or what is the news with thee, Thor?' But Thor went back speedily, and replied that he was then but new-wakened; said that it was then midnight, and there was yet time to sleep. \"Thor meditated that if he could get to stri ke him a third blow, never should the giant see himself again; he lay now and watched wh ether Skrýmir were sleeping soundly yet. A little before day, when he perceived that Sk rýmir must have fallen asleep, he stood up at once and rushed over to him, brandished hi s hammer with all his strength, and smote"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"upon that one of his temples which was turn ed up. But Skrýmir sat up and stroked his cheek, and said: 'Some birds must be sitt ing in the tree above me; I imagined, {p. 61} when I awoke, that some dirt from the twig s fell upon my head. Art thou awake, Thor? It will be time to arise and clothe us; but now ye have no long journey forward to the castle called Útgardr. I have heard how ye have wh ispered among yourselves that I am no little man in stature; but ye shall see taller men, if ye come into Útgardr. Now I will give you wholesome advice: do not conduct yourselves boastfully, for the henchmen of Útgarda- Loki will not well endure big words from such swaddling-babes. But if not so, then turn back, and I think it were better for you to do that; but if ye will go forward, then turn to the east. As for me, I hold my way north to these hills, which ye may how see.' Skrýmir took the provision-bag and cast it on his back, and turned from them across the forest; and it is not recorded that the Æsir bade him god-speed. XLVI. \"Thor turned forward on his way, and his fellows, and went onward till mid-day. Then they saw a castle standing in a certain plain, and set their necks down on their backs before they could see up over it. They went to the cattle; and there was a grating in front of the castle-gate, and it was cl osed. Thor went up to the gr ating, and did not succeed in opening it; but when they struggled to make th eir way in, they crept between the bars and came in that way. They saw a great hall and went thither; the door was open; then they went in, and saw there many men on two benc hes, and most of them were big enough. Thereupon they came before the king Útgarda- Loki and saluted him; but he looked at them in his own good time, and smiled scornfully over his teeth, and said : 'It is late to ask tidings of a long journey; or is it otherwise than I think: th at this toddler is Öku-Thor? Yet thou mayest {p. 62} be greater than thou appearest to me. What manner of accomplishments are those, which thou and thy fellows think to be ready for? No one shall be here with us who knows not some kind of craft or cu nning surpassing most men.' \"Then spoke the one who came last, 'Who was called Loki: 'I know such a trick, which I am ready to try: that there is no one within here who shall eat his food more quickly than I.' Then Útgarda-Loki answered: 'That is a f eat, if thou accomplish it; and this feat shall accordingly be put to the proof.' He called to the farther end of the bench, that he who was called Logi should come forth on the floor and try his prowess against Loki. Then a trough was taken and borne in upon the hall-floor and filled with flesh; Loki sat down at the one end and Logi at the other, and each at e as fast as he could, and they met in the middle of the trough. By that time Loki had ea ten all the meat from the bones, but Logi likewise had eaten all the meat, and the bone s with it, and the trough too; and now it seemed to all as if Loki had lost the game."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"\"Then Útgarda-Loki asked what yonder young ma n could play at; and Thjálfi answered that he would undertake to r un a race with whomsoever Út garda-Loki would bring up. Then Útgarda-Loki said that that was a good accomplishment, and that there was great likelihood that he must be well endowed with fl eetness if he were to perform that feat; yet he would speedily see to it that the matter should be tested. Then Útgarda-Loki arose and went out; and there was a good course to run on over the level plai n. Then Útgarda-Loki called to him a certain lad, who was named Hugi, and bade him run a match against Thjálfi. Then they held the first heat; and Hugi was so much {p. 63} ahead that he turned back to meet Thjálfi at the end of the course. Then said Útgarda- Loki: 'Thou wilt need to lay thyself forward more , Thjálfi, if thou art to win the game; but it is none the less true that ne ver have any men come hither who seemed to me fleeter of foot than this.' Then they began another he at; and when Hugi had reached the course's end, and was turning back, there was still a l ong bolt-shot to Thjálfi. Then spake Útgarda- Loki: 'Thjálfi appears to me to run this cour se well, but I do not be lieve of him now that he will win the game. But it will be made ma nifest presently, when they run the third heat.' Then they began the heat; but when H ugi had come to the end of the course and turned back, Thjálfi had not yet reached mid- course. Then all said that that game had been proven. \"Next, Útgarda-Loki asked Thor what feats there were which he might desire to show before them: such great tales as men have made of his mighty works. Then Thor answered that he would most willingly unde rtake to contend with any in drinking. Útgarda-Loki said that might well be; he went into the hall and called his serving-boy, and bade him bring the sconce-horn which the henchmen were wont to drink off. Straightway the serving-lad came forward with the horn and put it into Thor's hand. Then said Útgarda-Loki: 'It is held that this horn is well drained if it is drunk off in one drink, but some drink it off in two; but no one is so poor a man at drinking that it fails to drain off in three.' Thor looked upon the horn, and it did not seem big to him; and yet it was somewhat long. Still he was very thirsty; he took and drank, and swallowed enormously, and thought that he should not need to bend oftener to the horn. But when his breath failed, and he raised his {p. 64} head from the horn and looked to see how it ha d gone with the drinking, it seemed to him that there was very little space by which the dr ink was lower now in the horn than before. Then said Útgarda-Loki: 'It is well drunk, a nd not too much; I should not have believed, if it had been told me, that Ása-Thor coul d not drink a greater draught. But I know that thou wilt wish to drink it off in another dra ught.' Thor answered nothing; he set the horn to his mouth, thinking now that he should dr ink a greater drink, a nd struggled with the draught until his breath gave ou t; and yet he saw that the ti p of the horn would not come up so much as he liked. When he took the horn from his mouth and looked into it, it seemed to him then as if it had decreased le ss than the former time; but now there was a"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"clearly apparent lowering in the horn. Then said Útgard a-Loki: 'How now, Thor? Thou wilt not shrink from one more drink than ma y he well for thee? If thou now drink the third draught from the horn, it seems to me as if this must he esteemed the greatest; but thou canst not be called so great a man here among us as the Æsir call thee, if thou give not a better account of thyself in the other games than it seems to me may come of this.' Then Thor became angry, set- the horn to hi s mouth, and drank with all his might, and struggled with the drink as much as he coul d; and when he looked into the horn, at least some space had been made. Then he gave up the horn and would drink no more. \"Then said Útgarda-Loki: Now it is evident that thy prowess is not so great as we thought it to be; but wilt thou try thy hand at more game s? It may readily be seen that thou gettest no advantage hereof.' Thor answ ered: \"will make trial of ye t other games; but it would have {p. 65} seemed wonderful to me, when I was at home with the Æsir, if such drinks had been called so little. But what game will ye now offer me?' Then said Útgarda-Loki: 'Young lads here are wont to do this (which is t hought of small consequence): lift my cat up from the earth; but I should not have been able to speak of such a thing to Ása-Thor if I had not seen that thou hast far less in thee than I had thought.' Thereupon there leaped forth on the hall-floor a gray cat, and a very big one; and Thor went to it and took it with his hand down under the middle of the belly and lifted up. But the cat bent into an arch just as Thor stretched up his hands; and when Thor re ached up as high as he could at the very utmost, then the cat lifted up one foot, and T hor got this game no further advanced. Then said Útgarda-Loki: 'This game went even as I had foreseen; the cat is very great, whereas Thor is low and little beside the huge men who are here with us.' \"Then said Thor: 'Little as ye call me, let a ny one come up now and wrestle with me; now I am angry.' Then Útgarda-Loki answered, l ooking about him on the benches, and spake: 'I see no such man here within, who would not hold it a disgrace to wrestle with thee;' and yet he said: 'Let us see first; let the old wo man my nurse be called hither, Elli, and let Thor wrestle with her if he will. She has thrown such men as have seemed to me no less strong than Thor.' Straightway there came into the hall an ol d woman, stricken in years. Then Útgarda-Loki said that she should grappl e with Ása-Thor. There is no need to make a long matter of it: that struggle went in such wi se that the harder Thor strove in gripping, the faster she stood; then the old woman e ssayed a hold, and then Thor became totty on his feet, and their tuggings were {p. 66} very hard. Yet it was not l ong before Thor fell to his kn ee, on one foot. Then Útgarda- Loki went up and bade them cease the wrestl ing, saying that Thor should not need to challenge more men of his body-guard to wrest ling. By then it had passed toward night; Útgarda-Loki showed Thor and his companions to a seat, and they tarried there the night long in good cheer."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"XLVII. \"But at morning, as soon as it dawn ed, Thor and his compan ions arose, clothed themselves, and were ready to go away. Th en came there Útgarda-Loki and caused a table to be set for them; there was no lack of good cheer, meat and drink. So soon as they had eaten, he went out from the castle with th em; and at parting Útgarda-Loki spoke to Thor and asked how he thought his journey had ended, or whether he had met any man mightier than himself. Thor answered that he could not say that he had not got much shame in their dealings together. 'But yet I know that ye will call me a man of little might, and I am ill-content with that.' Then said Útgardi-Loki: 'Now I will tell thee the truth, now that thou art come out of the castle; and if I live and am ab le to prevail, then thou shalt never again come into it. And this I know, by my troth! that thou shouldst never have come into it, If I had known before that thou haddest so much strength in thee, and that thou shouldst so nearly have had us in great peril. But I made ready against thee eye-illusions; and I came upon you the first time in the wood, and when thou wouldst have unloosed the provision-bag, I had bound it with iron, and thou didst not find where to undo it. But next thou didst smite me thr ee blows with the hammer; and the first was least, and was yet so great that it would have sufficed {p. 67} to slay me, if it had come upon me. Where thou sawest near my hall a saddle-backed mountain, cut at the top into th reesquare dales, and one the deepest, those were the marks of thy hammer. I brought the saddle-back before the blow, but thou didst not see that. So it was also with the games, in which ye di d contend against my henchmen: that was the first, which Loki did; he was very hungry and ate zealously, but he who was called Logi was \"wild-fire,\" and he burned the trough no le ss swiftly than the meat. But when Thjálfi ran the race with him called Hugi, that was my \"thought,\" and it was not to be expected of Thjálfi that he should match swiftness with it. \"Moreover, when thou didst drink from the horn, and it seemed to thee to go slowly, then, by my faith, that was a wonder which I should not have believed po ssible: the other end of the horn was out in the sea, but thou dids t not perceive it. But now, when thou comest to the sea, thou shalt be able to mark what a diminishing thou hast dr unk in the sea: this is henceforth called \"ebb-tides.\"' \"And again he said: 'It seemed to me not less noteworthy when thou didst lift up the cat; and to tell thee truly, then all we re afraid who saw how thou dids t lift one foot clear of the earth. That cat was not as it appeared to thee: it was the Midgard Serpent, which lies about all the land, and scarcely does its length suffice to encompass the earth with head and tail. So high didst thou stretch up thine ar ms that it was then but a little way more to heaven. It was also a great marvel con cerning the wrestling-match, when thou didst withstand so long, and didst not fall more th an on one knee, wrestling with Elli; since none such has ever been and none shall be, if he become so old as to abide \"Old Age,\" that she shall not cause him to fall. And now {p. 68}"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"it is truth to tell that we must part; and it will be better on both side s that ye never come again to seek me. Another time I will defend my castle with similar wiles or with others, so that ye shall get no power over me.' \"When Thor had heard these sayings, he clut ched his hammer and brandished it aloft; but when he was about to launch it forward, then he saw Útgarda-Loki nowhere. Then he turned back to the castle, purposing to crush it to pieces; and he saw there a wide and fair plain, but no castle. So he turned back and went his way, till he was come back again to Thrúdvangar. But it is a true tale that then he resolved to s eek if he might bring about a meeting between himself and the Midgard Serpent, which after ward came to pass. Now I think no one knows how to tell thee more truly concerning th is journey of Thor's.\" XLVIII. Then said Gangleri: \"Very mighty is Útgarda-Loki, and he deals much in wiles and in magic; and his might may be seen in that he had such henchmen as have great prowess. Now did Thor ever take vengean ce for this?\" Hárr answered: \"It is not unknown, though one be not a scholar, that Thor took redress for this journey of which the tale has but now been told; and he did not tarry at home long before he made ready for his journey so hastily that he had with him no chariot and no he- goats and no retinue. He went out over Midgard in the guise of a young lad, and came one evening at twilight to a certain giant's, who was called Hymir. Thor abode as guest there overnight; but at dawn Hymir arose and clothed himself and ma de ready to row to sea a-fishing. Then Thor sprang up and was speedily ready, and aske d Hymir to let him row to sea with him. But Hymir said that Thor would {p. 69} be of little help to him, being so small and a youth, 'And thou wilt freez e, if I stay so long and so far out as I am wont.' But Thor said th at he would be able to row far out from land, for the reason that it was not certain whether he would be the first to ask to row back. Thor became so enraged at the giant that he was forthwith ready to let his hammer crash against him; but he forced himself to forbear , since he purposed to try his strength in another quarter. He asked Hymir what they should have for bait, but Hymir bade him get bait for himself. Then Thor turned away th ither where he, saw a certain herd of oxen, which Hymir owned; he took the largest ox, ca lled Himinbrjotr,[1] and cut off its head and went therewith to the sea. By th at time Hymir had shoved out the boat. \"Thor went aboard the skiff and sat down in the stern-seat, took two oars and rowed; and it seemed to Hymir that swift progress came of his rowing. Hymir rowed forward in the bow, and the rowing proceeded rapidly; then Hy mir said that they had arrived at those fishing-banks where he was wont to anchor a nd angle for flat-fish. Bu t Thor said that he desired to row much further, and they took a sharp pull; then Hymir said that they had come so far that it was perilous to abide out farther because of the Midgard Serpent. Thor replied that they would row a while yet, and so he did; but Hymir was then sore afraid. Now as soon as Thor had laid by the oars, he made ready a very strong fishing-line, and the hook was no less large and strong. Then T hor put the ox-head on the hook and cast it"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"overboard, and the hook went to the bottom; and it is telling thee the truth to say that then Thor beguiled the Midgard Serpent no less than Útgarda-Loki had mocked [1. Heaven-bellowing?] {p. 70} Thor, at the time when he lif ted up the Serpent in his hand. \"The Midgard Serpent snapped at the ox-hea d, and the hook caught in its jaw; but when the Serpent was aware of this, it dashed away so fiercely that both Thor's fists crashed against the gunwale. Then Thor was ange red, and took upon him his divine strength, braced his feet so strongly that he plunged th rough the ship with both feet, and dashed his feet against the bottom; then he drew the Se rpent up to the gunwale. And it may be said that no one has seen very fearful sights w ho might not see that: bow Thor flashed fiery glances at the Serpent, and the Serpent in tu rn stared up toward him from below and blew venom. Then, it is said, the giant Hymir grew pale, became yellow, and was sore afraid, when he saw the Serpent, and how the sea rush ed out and in through the boat. In the very moment when Thor clutched his hammer and ra ised it on high, then the giant fumbled for his fish-knife and hacked off Thor's line at the gunwale, and the Serpent sank down into the sea. Thor hurled his hammer after it; and me n say that he struck off its head against the bottom; but I think it were true to tell thee that the Midgard Serpent yet lives and lies in the encompassing sea. But 'Thor swung his fist and brought it ag ainst Hymir's ear, so that he plunged overboard, and Thor saw the so les of his feet. And Thor waded to land.\" XLIX. Then spake Gangleri: \"H ave any more matters of note befallen among the Æsir? A very great deed of valor di d Thor achieve on that journe y.\" Hárr made answer: \"Now shall be told of those tidi ngs which seemed of more c onsequence to the Æsir. The beginning of the {p. 71} story is this, that Baldr th e Good dreamed great and peril ous dreams touching his life. When he told these dreams to the Æsir, th en they took counsel together: and this was their decision: to ask safety for Baldr from all kinds of dangers. And Frigg took oaths to this purport, that fire and water should spare Baldr, likewise iron and metal of all kinds, stones, earth, trees, sicknesses, beasts, bird s, venom, serpents. And when that was done and made known, then it was a diversion of Ba ldr's and the Æsir, that he should stand up in the Thing,[1] and all the others should some shoot at him, some hew at him, some beat him with stones; but whatsoever was done hurt h im not at all, and that seemed to them all a very worshipful thing. \"But when Loki Laufeyarson saw this, it plea sed him ill that Baldr took no hurt. He went to Fensalir to Frigg, and made himself into the likeness of a woman. Then Frigg asked if that woman knew what the Æsir did at the Thing. She said that all were shooting at Baldr, and moreover, that he took no hurt. Then said Frigg: 'Neither weapons nor trees may hurt Baldr: I have taken oaths of them all.' Th en the woman asked: 'Have all things taken"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"oaths to spare Baldr?' and Frigg answered: 'T here grows a tree-sprout alone westward of Valhall: it is called Mistletoe; I thought it too young to ask th e oath of.' Then straightway the woman turned away; but Loki took Mistle toe and pulled it up and went to the Thing. \"Hödr stood outside the ring of men, because he was blind. Then spake Loki to him: 'Why dost thou not shoot at Baldr?' He answered: 'Because I see not where Baldr [1. The Thing was the legislative assemb ly of Iceland; less specifically, a formal assembly held for judicial purposes or to settle questions of moment; an assembly of men.] {p. 72} is; and for this also, that I am weaponless.' Then said Loki: 'Do thou also after the manner of other men, and show Baldr honor as th e other men do. I will direct thee where he stands; shoot at him with this wand.' Hödr t ook Mistletoe and shot at Baldr, being guided by Loki: the shaft flew through Baldr, and he fell dead to the ear th; and that was the greatest mischance that has ev er befallen among gods and men. \"Then, when Baldr was fallen, words failed all the, Æsir, and their hands likewise to lay hold of him; each looked at the other, and all were of one mind as to him who had. wrought the work, but none might take vengeance , so great a sanctuary was in that place. But when the Æsir tried to speak, then it befell first that weeping broke out, so that none might speak to the others with words concerni ng his grief. But Odin bore that misfortune by so much the worst, as he had most percep tion of how great harm and loss for the Æsir were in the death of Baldr. \"Now when the gods had come to themselves, Frigg spake, and asked who there might be among the Æsir who would fain have for his ow n all her love and favor: let him ride the road to Hel, and seek if he may find Baldr, and offer Hel a ransom if she will let Baldr come home to Ásgard. And he is named Hermódr the Bold, Odin's son, who undertook that embassy. Then Sleipnir was taken, Odin 's steed, and led forward; and Hermódr mounted on that horse and galloped off. \"The Æsir took the body of Baldr and brought it to the sea. Hringhorni is the name of Baldr's ship: it was greatest of all ships; the gods would have launched it and made Baldr's pyre thereon, but the ship stirred not forward. Then word was sent to Jötunheim after that giantess who {p.73} is called Hyrrokkin. When she had come, riding a wolf and having a vi per for bridle, then she leaped off the steed; and Odin called to f our berserks to tend the steed; but they were not able to hold it until they had felled it. Then Hyrrokkin went to the prow of the boat and thrust it out at the first pus h, so that fire burst from the rollers, and all lands trembled. Thor became angry and clutched his hammer, and would straightway have broken her head, had not the gods prayed for peace for her."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"\"Then was the body of Baldr borne out on sh ipboard; and when his wife, Nanna the daughter of Nep, saw that, stra ightway her heart burst with grief, and she died; she was borne to the pyre, and fire was kindled. Then Thor stood by and hallowed the pyre with Mjöllnir; and before hi s feet ran a certain dwarf which was named Litr; Thor kicked at him with his foot and thrust him into the fi re, and he burned. People of many races visited this burning: First is to be told of Odin, how Frigg and the Valkyrs went with him, and his ravens; but Freyr drove in his chariot with the boar called Gold-Mane, or Fearful- Tusk, and Heimdallr rode the horse called Gold-Top, and Freyja drove her cats. Thither came also much people of the Rime-Giants and the Hill-Giants. Odin laid on the pyre that gold ring which is called Draupni r; this quality attended it, that every ninth night there dropped from it eight gold rings of equal wei ght. Baldr's horse was led to the bale-fire with all his trappings. \"Now this is to be told c oncerning Hermódr, that he rode nine nights through dark dales and deep, so that he saw not before he wa s come to the river Gj öll and rode onto the Gjöll-Bridge; which bridge is thatched with glittering gol d. Módgudr is the maiden called who guards the {p. 74} bridge; she asked him his name and race, sayi ng that the day before there had ridden over the bridge five companies of dead men; but the bridge thunders no less under thee alone, and thou hast not the color of dead men. Why ridest thou hither on Hel-way?' He answered: 'I am appointed to ride to Hel to seek out Baldr. Hast thou perchance seen Baldr on Hel-way?' She said that Baldr had ri dden there over Gjöll's Bridge,--'but down and north lieth Hel-way.' 'Then Hermódr rode on till he came to Hel-ga te; he dismounted from his steed and made his girths fast, mounted and pric ked him with his spurs; and th e steed leaped so hard over the gate that he came nowise near to it. Then Hermódr rode home to the hall and dismounted from his steed, went into the hall, and saw sitting there in the high-seat Baldr, his brother; and Hermód r tarried there overnight. At morn Hermódr prayed Hel that Baldr might ride home with him, and told her how great weeping was among the Æsir. But Hel said that in this wise it should be put to th e test, whether Baldr were so all-beloved as had been said: 'If all things in the world, quick a nd dead, weep for him, then he shall go back to the Æsir; but he shall remain with Hel if any gainsay it or will not weep.' Then Hermódr arose; but Baldr led him out of the ha ll, and took the ring Draupnir and sent it to Odin for a remembrance. And Nanna sent Fri gg a linen smock, and yet more gifts, and to Fulla a golden finger-ring. \"Then Hermódr rode his way back, and came into Ásgard, and told all those tidings which he had seen and heard. Thereupon the Æsir sent over all the world messengers to pray that Baldr be wept out of Hel; and all men did this, and quick things, and the earth, and stones, {p. 75}"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"and trees, and all metals,--even as thou must have seen that these things weep when they come out of frost and into the heat. The n, when the messengers went home, having well wrought their errand, they found, in a certain cav e, where a giantess sat: she called herself Thökk. They prayed her to weep Baldr out of Hel; she answered: Thökk will weep | waterless tears For Baldr's bale-fare; Living or dead, | I love d not the churl's son; Let Hel hold to that she hath! And men deem that she who was there was L oki Laufeyarson, who hath wrought most ill among the Æsir.\" L. Then said Gangleri: \"Exceeding much L oki had brought to pass, when he had first been cause that Baldr was slain, and then that he was not redeemed out of Hel. Was any vengeance taken on him for this?\" Hárr answer ed: \"This thing was repaid him in such wise that he shall remember it long. When the gods had become as wroth with him as was to be looked for, he ran off and hid himself in a certain mountain; there he made a house with four doors, so that he could see out of the house in all dir ections. Often throughout the day he turned himself into the likeness of a salmon and hid himself in the place called Fránangr-Falls; then he would ponder what manne r of wile the gods would devise to take him in the water-fall. But when he sat in the house, he took twine of linen and knitted meshes as a net is made since; but a fire bur ned before him. Then he saw that the Æsir were close upon him; and Odin ha d seen from Hlidskjálf where {p. 76} he was. He leaped up at once and out into the river, but cast the net into the fire. \"When the Æsir had come to the house, he went in first who was wisest of all, who is called Kvasir; and when he saw in the fire the white ash where the net had burned, then he perceived that that thing must be a device for catching fish, and told it to the Æsir. Straightway they took hold, and made themselv es a net after the pattern of the one which they perceived, by the burnt-out ashes, that Loki had made. When the net was ready, then the Æsir went to the river and cast the net into the fall; Thor held one end of the net, and all of the Æsir held the other, and they drew the net. But Loki darted ahead and lay down between two stones; they drew the net over hi m, and perceived that something living was in front of it. A second time they went up to the fall and cast out the net, having bound it to something so heavy that nothing should be able to pass under it. Then Loki swam ahead of the net; but when he saw that it wa s but a short distance to the sea, then he jumped up over the net-rope and ran into th e fall. Now the Æsir saw where he went, and went up again to the fall and divided the co mpany into two parts, but Thor waded along in mid-stream; and so they went out towa rd the sea. Now Loki saw a choice of two courses: it was a mortal peril to dash out in to the sea; but this was the second--to leap over the net again. And so he did: be leaped as swiftly as he could over the net-cord. Thor"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"clutched at him and got hold of him, and he slipped in Thor's hand, so that the hand stopped at the tail; and for this reas on the salmon has a tapering back. \"Now Loki was taken trucel ess, and was brought with {p. 77} them into a certain cave. Thereupon they took three flat stones, and set them on edge and drilled a hole in each stone. Then were taken Loki's sons, Vili and Nari or Narfi; the Æsir changed Váli into the form of a wolf, and he tore asunder Narfi his brother. And the Æsir took his entrails and bound Loki with them over the three stones: one stands under his shoulders, the second under his loins, the third under his boughs; and those bonds were turned to iron. Then Skadi took a venomous se rpent and fastened it up over him, so that the venom should drip from the serpent into hi s face. But Sigyn, his wife, stands near him and holds a basin under the venom-drops; and wh en the basin is full, she goes and pours out the venom, but in the meantime the venom drips into his face. Then he writhes against it with such force that all the earth trembles: ye ca ll that 'earthquakes.' There he lies in bonds till the We ird of the Gods.\" LI. Then said Gangleri: \"What tidings are to be told concerning the Weird of the Gods? Never before have I heard aught said of this.\" Hárr answered: \"Great tidings are to be told of it, and much. The first is this, that there shall come that winter which is called the Awful Winter: in that time snow shall drive fr om all quarters; frosts shall be great then, and winds sharp; there shall be no virtue in the sun. Those wi nters shall proceed three in succession, and no summer between; but first sha ll come three other winters, such that over all the world there shall be mighty battles. In that time br others shall slay each other for greed's sake, and none shall spare father or son in manslaughter and in incest; so it says in Völuspá : {p. 78} Brothers shall strive | an d slaughter each other; Own sisters' children | shall sin together; Ill days among men, | many a whoredom: An axe-age, a sword-age, | shields shall be cloven; A wind-age, a wolf-age, | ere the world totters. Then shall happen what seems great tidings: the Wolf shall swallow the sun; and this shall seem to men a great harm. Then the ot her wolf shall seize th e moon, and he also shall work great ruin; the stars shall vanish from the heavens. Then shall come to pass these tidings also: all the earth shall tremble so, and the crags, that trees shall be torn up from the earth, and the crags fall to ruin; a nd all fetters and bonds shall be broken and rent. Then shall Fenris-Wolf get loose; then the sea shall gush forth upon the land, because the Midgard Serpent st irs in giant wrath and advanc es up onto the land. Then that too shall happen, that Naglfar shall be loosen ed, the ship which is so named. (It is made of dead men's nails; wherefore a warning is desirable, that if a man die with unshorn"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"nails, that man adds much material to the sh ip Naglfar, which gods and men were fain to have finished late.) Yet in this sea-flood Na glfar shall float. Hrymr is the name of the giant who steers Naglfar.

The Midgard Serpent shall blow venom so that he shall sp rinkle all the air and water; and he is very terrible, and shall be on one side of the Wolf. In this di n shall the heaven be cloven, and the Sons of Múspell ride thence: Surtr shall ride fi rst, and both before him and after him {p. 79} burning fire; his sword is exceeding good: from it radiance shines brighter than from the sun; when they ride over Bifr öst, then the bridge shall break, as has been told before. The Sons of Múspell shall go forth to that fiel d which is called Vígrídr, thither shall come Fenris-Wolf also and the Midgard Serpent; th en Loki and Hrymr shall come there also, and with him all the Rime-Giants. All the ch ampions of Hel follow Loki; and the Sons of Múspell shall have a company by themselves , and it shall be very bright. The field Vígrídr is a hundred leagues wide each way. \"When these tidings come to pass, then shall Heimdallr rise up and blow mightily in the Gjallar-Horn, and awaken all th e gods; and they shall hold council together. Then Odin shall ride to Mímir's Well and take counsel of Mímir for himself and his host. Then the Ash of Yggdrasill shall tremble, and nothing then shall be wit hout fear in heaven or in earth. Then shall the Æsir put on their war-w eeds, and all the Champions, and advance to the field: Odin rides first with the gold helm et and a fair birnie, and his spear, which is called Gungnir. He shall go forth against Fenr is-Wolf, and Thor stands forward on his other side, and can be of no avail to him, b ecause he shall have his hands full to fight against the Midgard Serpent. Freyr shall cont end with Surtr, and a hard encounter shall there be between them before Freyr falls: it is to be his death th at he lacks that good sword of his, which he gave to Skírnir. Then shall the dog Garmr be loosed, which is bound before Gnipa's Cave: he is the greatest monster; he shall do battle with Týr, and each become the other's slayer. Thor shall pu t to death the Midgard Serpent, and shall stride away nine paces from that spot; then shall he fall dead to the earth, because of the venom which the {p. 80} Snake has blown at him. The Wolf shall sw allow Odin; that shall be his ending But straight thereafter shall Vídarr stride forth and set one foot upon the lower jaw of the Wolf: on that foot he has the shoe, materials for which have been gathering throughout all time. (They are the scraps of leather which men cut out: of their s hoes at toe or heel; therefore he who desires in hi s heart to come to the Æsir's help should cast those scraps away.) With one hand he shall seize the Wolf 's upper jaw and tear his gullet asunder; and that is the death of the Wolf. L oki shall have battle with Heimdallr, and each be the slayer of the other.

Then said Gangleri: 'What shall come to pass {p. 82} afterward, when all the world is burned, and dead are all the gods and all the champions and all mankind?

Moreover, there is plenteous abundance of good drink, for them that esteem that a pleasure, in the hall which is called Brimir: it stands in Ókólnir. That too is a good hall which stands in Nida Fells, made of red gold; its name is Sindri. In these halls shall dwell good men and pure in heart. \"On Nástrand[1] is a great hall and evil, and its doors face to the north : it is all woven of serpent-backs like a wattle-house; and all the snake-heads turn into the house and blow venom, so that along the hall run rivers of venom; and they who have broken oaths, and murderers, wade those rive rs, even as it says here: I know a hall standing | far from the sun, In Nástrand: the doors; | to northward are turned; Venom-drops fill | down from the roof-holes; That hall is bordered | with backs of serpents.

Thereupon Gangleri heard great noises on ev ery side of him; and then, when he had looked about him more, lo, he stood out of doors on a level plain, and saw no hall there and no castle. Then he went his way forth a nd came home into his kingdom, and told those tidings which he had seen and heard; a nd after him each man told these tales to the other. {p. 87} [ Here Wilken closes his edition; Jónsson admits the following:"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"But the Æsir sat them down to speak toge ther, and took counsel and recalled all these tales which had been told to him.

There Thor was so named, and he is the old Ása-Thor. All reject what follows: He is Öku-Thor, and to him are ascribed those mighty works which Hector wrought in Troy. But this is the beli ef of men: that the Turks told of Ulysses, and called him Loki, for the Turks were his greatest foes.] {p. 90} SKÁLDSKAPARMAL THE POESY OF SKALDS[1] I. A certain man was named Ægir, or Hlér. He dwelt on the island which is now called Hlér's Isle,[2] and was deeply versed in black magic. He took his way to Ásgard, but the Æsir had foreknowledge of his journey; he was received with good cheer, and yet many things were done by deceit, with eye-illu sions. And at evening, when it was time for drinking, Odin had swords brought into the hall, so bright that light radiated from them: and other illumination was not us ed while they sat at drinking. The n the Æsir came in to their banquet, and in the high-seats sat them down those twelve Æsir who were appointed to be judges; these were their names: Thor, Njördr, Freyr, Týr, Heimdallr, Bragi, Vídarr, Váli, Ullr, Hœnir, Forseti, Loki; and in like manner the Ásynjur: Frigg, Freyja, Gefjun, Idunn, Gerdr, Sigyn, Fulla, Nanna. It seemed glorious to Ægir to look about him in the hall: the wainscottings there were all hung with fair shields; there was also stinging mead, copiously quaffed. The man seated next to Ægir was Bragi, and they took part together in drinking and in converse: Bragi told Ægir of many things which had come to pass among the Æsir. He began the story at the point where thre e of the Æsir, Odin and Loki and Hœnir, departed from home and were wandering ove r mountains and wastes, and food was hard to find. But when they came down into a ce rtain dale, they saw a herd of oxen, took one ox, and set about cooking it. Now when they th ought that it must be cooked, they broke up the fire, and it was not cooked. After a whil e had passed, they having scattered the fire a"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"[1. Usually translated \"Poetical Diction.\" 2. Now Læssø.] {p. 90} second time, and it was not cooked, they took co unsel together, asking each other what it might mean. Then they heard a voice speaki ng in the oak up above them, declaring that he who sat there confessed he had caused th e lack of virtue in the fire. They looked thither, and there sat an eagl e; and it was no small one. Then the eagle said: \"If ye are willing to give me my fill of the ox, then it wi ll cook in the fire.\" They assented to this. Then he let himself float down from the tree a nd alighted by the fire, and forthwith at the very first took unto himself the two hams of the ox, and both shoulders. Then Loki was angered, snatched up a great pole, brandished it with all his strength, and drove it at the eagle's body. The eagle plunged violently at th e blow and flew up, so that the pole was fast to the eagle's back, and Loki's hands to the other end of the pole. The eagle flew at such a height that Loki's feet down belo w knocked against stones and rock-heaps and trees, and he thought his arms would be torn from his shoulders. He cried aloud, entreating the eagle urgently fo r peace; but the eagle declared that Loki should never be loosed, unless he would give him his oath to induce Idunn to come out of Ásgard with her apples. Loki assented, and being straightway l oosed, went to his companions; nor for that time are any more things reported concerning their journey, until they had come home. But at the appointed time Loki lured Idunn out of Ásgard in to a certain wood, saying that he had found such apples as would seem to he r of great virtue, and prayed that she would have her apples with her and compare them w ith these. Then Thjazi the giant came there in his eagle's plumage and took Idunn and flew away with her, off into Thrymheimr to his abode. {p. 91} But the Æsir became straitened at the disa ppearance of Idunn, and speedily they became hoary and old. Then those, Æsir took counsel together, and each asked the other what had last been known of Idunn; a nd the last that had been seen was that she had gone out of Ásgard with Loki. Thereupon Loki was se ized and brought to the Thing, and was threatened with death, or tortures; when he ha d become well frightened, he declared that he would seek after Idunn in Jötunheim, if Freyja would lend him the hawk's plumage which she possessed. And when he got the hawk's plumage, he flew north into Jötunheim, and came on a certain day to the hom e of Thjazi the gian t. Thjazi had rowed out to sea, but Idunn was at home alone: Loki turned her into the shape of a nut and grasped her in his claw s and flew his utmost. Now when Thjazi came home and missed I dunn, he took his eagle's plumage and flew after Loki, making a mighty rush of sound with his wings in his flight. But when the Æsir saw how the hawk flew with the nut, and where the eagle was flying, they went out below Ásgard and bore burdens of plane-shavin gs thither. As soon as the hawk flew into the citadel, he swooped down cl ose by the castle-wall; then th e Æsir struck fire to the"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"plane-shavings. But the eagle could not stop himself when he missed the hawk: the feathers of the eagle caught fi re, and straightway his flight ceased. Then the Æsir were near at hand and slew Thjazi the giant within the Gate of the Æsir, and that slaying is exceeding famous. Now Skadi, the daughter of the giant Thjazi, took helm and birnie and all weapons of war and proceeded to Ásgard, to avenge her father. The Æsir, however, offered her reconciliation and atonement: the first article was that she should {p. 92} choose for herself a husband from among the Æsi r and choose by the feet only, seeing no more of him. Then she saw the feet of one man, passing fair, and said : \"I choose this one: in Baldr little can be lo athly.\" But that was Njördr of Nó atún. She had this article also in her bond of reconciliation: that the Æsir must do a thing she thought they would not be able to accomplish: to make her laugh. Then Loki did this: he tied a cord to the beard of a goat, the other end being about his own genita ls, and each gave way in turn, and each of the two screeched loudly; then Loki let hi mself fall onto Skadi's knee, and she laughed. Thereupon reconciliation was made with her on the part of the Æsir. It is so said, that Odin did this by way of atonement to Skadi: he took Thjazi's eyes and cast them up into the heavens, and made of them two stars. Then said Ægir: \"It seems to me that Thjazi was a mighty man: now of what family was he?\" Bragi answered: \"His father was called Ölvaldi, and if I tell thee of him, thou wilt think these things wonders. He was very rich in gold; but when he died and his sons came to divide the inheritance, they determined upon this measure for the gold which they divided: each should take as much as his m outh would hold, and all the same number of mouthfuls. One of them was Thjazi, the sec ond Idi, the third Gangr. And we have it as a metaphor among us now, to call gold the mouth-ta le of these giants; but we conceal it in secret terms or in poesy in this way, that we call it Speech, or Word, or Talk, of these giants.\" Then said Ægir: \"I deem that well conceal ed in secret terms.\" And again said Ægir: \"Whence did this art, which ye call poesy , derive its beginnings?\" Bragi answered: \"These were the beginnings th ereof. The gods had a dispute {p. 93} with the folk which are called Vanir, and th ey appointed a peace-meeting between them and established peace in this way: they each we nt to a vat and spat their spittle therein. Then at parting the gods took that peace-toke n and would not let it perish, but shaped thereof a man. This man is called Kvasir, a nd he was so wise th at none could question him concerning anything but th at he knew the solution. He went up and down the earth to give instruction to men; and when he came upon invitation to the abode of certain dwarves, Fjalar and Galarr, they called him into privy c onverse with them, and killed him, letting his blood run into two vats and a ke ttle. The kettle is named Ódrerir, and the"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"vats Són and Bodn; they blended honey with the blood, and the outcome was that mead by the virtue of which he who drinks become s a skald or scholar. The dwarves reported to the Æsir that Kvasir had choked on his own shrewdness, since there was none so wise there as to be able to question his wisdom. \"Then these dwarves inv ited the giant who is called Gilli ngr to visit them, and his wife with him. Next the dwarves invited Gillingr to row upon th e sea with them; but when they had gone out from the land, the dwarve s rowed into the breakers and capsized the boat. Gillingr was unable to swim, and he perished; but the dwarves righted their boat and rowed to land. They reported this accident to his wife, but she took it grievously and wept aloud. Then Fjalar asked her whether it would ease her heart if she should look out upon the sea at the spot where he had perished; and she desired it. Then he spoke softly to Galarr his brother, bidding him go up over th e doorway, when she should go out, and let a mill-stone fall on her head, saying that her weeping grew wearisome to him; and even so he did. {p. 94} \"Now when the giant Suttungr, Gillingr's son, learned of th is, he went over and took the dwarves and carried them out to sea, and se t them on a reef which was covered at high tide. They besought Suttungr to grant them re spite of their lives, and as the price of reconciliation offered him the precious mead in satisfaction of his father's death. And that became a means of reconcilia tion between them. Suttungr carried the mead home and concealed it in the place called Hnitbjörg, pl acing his daughter Gunnlöd there to watch over it. Because of this we call poesy Kvasir 's Blood or Dwarves' Drink, or Fill, or any kind of liquid of Ódrerir, or of Bodn, or of Són, or Ferry -Boat of Dwarves--since this mead brought them life--ransom from the reef--or Suttungr's Mead, or Liquor of Hnitbjörg.\" Then Ægir said: \"These seem to me dark sa yings, to call poesy by these names. But how did ye Æsir come at Suttungr's Mead?\" Brag i answered: \"That tale runs thus: Odin departed from home and came to a certain pl ace where nine thrall s were mowing hay. He asked if they desired him to whet their scyt hes, and they assented. Then he took a hone from his belt and whetted the scythes; it seemed to them that the scythes cut better by far, and they asked that the hone be sold them . But he put such a value on it that whoso desired to buy must give a cons iderable price: nonetheless all said that they would agree, and prayed him to sell it to them. He cast the hone up into the air; but since all wished to lay their hands on it, they became so intermingl ed with one another that each struck with his scythe against the other's neck. \"Odin sought a night's lodging with the gian t who is called Baugi, Suttungr's brother. Baugi bewailed his husbandry, saying that hi s nine thralls had killed one another, {p. 95}"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"and declared that he had no hope of workme n. Odin called himself Bölverkr in Baugi's presence; he offered to undertake nine me n's work for Baugi, and demanded for his wages one drink of Suttungr's Mead. Baugi decl ared that he had no c ontrol whatever over the mead, and said that Suttungr was determined to have it to himself, but promised to go with Bölverkr and try if they might ge t the mead. During the summer Bölverkr accomplished nine men's work for Baugi, but when winter came he asked Baugi for his hire. Then they both set out for Suttungr's. Ba ugi told Suttungr his brother of his bargain with Bölverkr; but Suttungr flatly refused th em a single drop of the mead. Then Bölverkr made suggestion to Baugi that they try certain wiles, if perchance they might find means to get at the mead; and Baugi agreed read ily. Thereupon Bölverkr drew out the auger called Rati, saying that Baugi mu st bore the rock, if the auger cut. He did so. At last Baugi said that the rock wa s bored through, but Bölverkr blew into the auger-hole, and the chips flew up at him. Then he discovered that Baugi would have deceived him, and he bade him bore through the rock. Baugi bored anew; and when Bölverkr blew a second time, then the chips were blown in by the blast. Then Bölverkr turned himself into a serpent and crawled into the auger-hole, but Baugi thrust at him from behind with the auger and missed him. Bölverkr proceeded to the place where Gunnlöd was, and lay with her three nights; and then she gave him leave to drink three draughts of the mead. In the first draught he drank every drop out of Ódre rir; and in the second, he emptied Bodn; and in the third, Són; and then he had all the mea d. Then he turned himself into the shape of an eagle and flew as furiously as he could; but when Suttungr saw the eagle's {p. 96} flight, he too assumed the fashion of an eag le and flew after him. When the Æsir saw Odin flying, straightway they set out their va ts in the court; and when Odin came into Ásgard, he spat up the mead into the vats. Ne vertheless he came so near to being caught by Suttungr that he sent some mead backward s, and no heed was taken of this: whosoever would might have that, and we call that the poet aster's part.[1] But Odin gave the mead of Suttungr to the Æsir and to those men who po ssess the ability to compose. Therefore we call poesy Odin's Booty and Find, and his Dr ink and Gift, and the Drink of the Æsir.\" Then said Ægir: \"In how many ways are the te rms of skaldship vari ously phrased, or how many are the essential elements of the skaldi c art?\" Then Bragi answered: \"The elements into which all poesy is divided are two.\" Æg ir asked: \"What two?\" Bragi said: \"Metaphor and metre.\" \"What manner of metaphor is used for skaldic writing?\" \"Three are the types of skaldic metaphor.\" \"Which?\" \"Thus: [firs t], calling everything by its name; the second type is that which is called 'substitution;' the third type of me taphor is that which is called 'periphrasis,' and this type is employed in su ch manner: Suppose I take Odin, or Thor, or Týr, or any of the Æsir or Elves; and to any of them whom I menti on, I add the name of a property of some other of the Æsir, or I record certain works of his. Thereupon he becomes owner of the name, and not the one whose name was applied to him: just as when we speak of Victory-Týr, or Týr of the Hanged, or Týr of Cargoes: that then becomes Odin's name: and we call these periphras tic names. So also with the title Týr of the Wain.[2] [1. See Burns, The Kirk's Alarm, 11th stanza, for a similar idea."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"2. Týr. See discussion in Cl.-Vig., p. 647. This word as a proper name refers {footnote p. 97} to the one- armed God of War; but, especially in compounds, it has the sense of God, the God, and is usually applied to Odin. The compounds mentioned here by Snorri are all epithets of Odin. See Gylfaginning, p. 30.] {p. 97} \"But now one thing must be said to young skalds, to such as yearn to attain to the craft of poesy and to increase their store of figures with traditional metaphors; or to those who crave to acquire the faculty of discerning what is said in hidd en phrase: let such an one, then, interpret this book to his instruction and pleasure. Ye t one is not so to forget or discredit these traditions as to remove from poesy those ancient metaphors with which it has pleased Chief Skalds to be content; nor , on the other hand, ought Christian men to believe in heathen gods, nor in the truth of these tales otherwise than precisely as one may find here in the beginning of the book. II. Now you may hear examples of the way in which Chief Skalds have held it becoming to compose, making use of these simple terms and periphrases: as when Arnórr Earls' Skald says that Odin is called Allfather: Now I'll tell men the virtue Of the terrible Jarl; Allfather's Song-Surf streams; Late my sorrows lighten, Here, moreover, he calls poesy the Song-Surf of Allfather. Hávard r the Halt sang thus: Now is the flight of eagles Over the field; the sailors Of the sea-horses hie them To the Hanged-God's gifts and feasting. {p. 98} Thus sang Viga-Glúmr: With the Hanged-God's helmet The hosts have ceased from going By the brink; not pleasant The bravest held the venture.

Thus sang Úlfr Uggason: I show to host-glad Áleifr The Heart-Fjord's Shoal of Odin,-- My song: him do I summon To hear the Gift of Grímnir. Poesy is called Sea, or Liquid of the Dwa rves, because Kvasir's blood was liquid in Ódrerir before the mead was made, and then it was put into the kettle; wherefore it is called Odin's Kettle-Liquor, even as Eyvindr sang and as we have recorded before: While his kin In the Kettle-Brewing Of the Gallows-Lord To the gods I trace.[1] [1.

Heimdallr is the Possessor of Gulltoppr; he is also Frequenter of Vágasker and Singasteinn, where he contended with Loki for the Necklace Brís inga-men, he is also called Vindlér.

XVII. \"Now an account shall be given of th e source of those metaphors which have but now been recorded, and of which no accounts we re rendered before: even such as Bragi gave to Ægir, telling how Thor had gone into the east to slay tr olls, and Odin rode Sleipnir into Jötunheim and visited that giant who was named Hrungnir. Hrungnir asked what manner of man he with the golden helm might be, who rode through air and water; and said that the stranger had a wondrous good steed. Odin said he would wager his head there was no horse in Jötunheim that woul d prove equally good. Hr ungnir answered that it was a good horse, but declared that he had a much better paced horse which was called Gold-Mane. Hrungnir had become angry, and vaulted up onto his horse and galloped after him, thinking to pay him for his boasting. Odin gal loped so furiously that he was on the top of the next hill first; but Hrungni r was so filled with the giant's frenzy {p. 116} that he took no heed until he had come in beyond the gates of Ásgard. When he came to the hall-door, the Æsir invited him to dri nk. He went within and ordered drink to be brought to him, and then those flagons were brought in from which Thor was wont to drink; and Hrungnir swilled from each in tu rn. But when he had become drunken, then big words were not wanting: he boasted th at he would lift up Valhall and carry it to Jötunheim, and sink Ásgard and kill all the gods, save that he would take Freyja and Sif home with him. Freyja alone dared pour for him; and he vowed that he would drink all the ale of the Æsir. But when his overbeari ng insolence became tiresome to the Æsir, they called on the name of Thor."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"\"Straightway Thor came into the hall, brandi shing his hammer, and he was very wroth, and asked who had advised that these dogs of giants be permitted to drink there, or who had granted Hrungnir safe-conduct to be in Valha ll, or why Freyja should pour for him as at a feast of the Æsir. Then Hrungnir answered, looking at Thor with no friendly eyes, and said that Odin had invited him to dr ink, and he was under his safe-conduct. Thor declared that Hrungnir should repent of th at invitation before he got away. Hrungnir answered that Ása-Thor would have scant re nown for killing him, w eaponless as he was: it were a greater trial of hi s courage if he dared fight with Hrungnir on the border at Grjótúnagard. 'And it was a great folly,' said he , 'when I left my shield and hone behind at home; if I had my weapons here, then we s hould try single-combat. But as matters stand, I declare thee a coward if thou wilt slay me, a weaponless man.' Thor was by no means anxious to avoid the fight when challenged to the field, for no one had ever offered him single-combat before. {p. 117} \"Then Hrungnir went his way, and galloped fu riously until he came to Jötunheim. The news of his journey was spread abroad am ong the giants, and it became noised abroad that a meeting had been arranged between him and Thor; the giants deemed that they had much at stake, who should win the victory, si nce they looked for ill at Thor's hands if Hrungnir perished, he being strong est of them all. Then the giants made a man of clay at Grjótúnagard: he was nine miles high and th ree broad under the arm- pits; but they could get no heart big enough to fit him, until they took one from a mare. Even that was not steadfast within him, when Thor came. Hrungni r had the heart which is notorious, of hard stone and spiked with three corners, even as the written character is since formed, which men call Hrungnir's Heart. His head also was of stone; his shield t oo was stone, wide and thick, and he had the shield before him when he stood at Grjótúnagard and waited for Thor. Moreover he had a hone for a weapon, a nd brandished it over his shoulders, and he was not a pretty sight. At one side of him stood the clay giant, which was called Mökkurkálfi: he was sore afraid, and it is sa id that he wet himself when he saw Thor. \"Thor went to the meeting-place, and Thjálfi with him. Then Thjálfi ran forward to the spot where Hrungnir stood and said to him: 'Thou standest unwar ily, Giant, having the shield before thee: for Thor has seen thee, and comes hither down below the earth, and will come at thee from beneath.' Then Hrungnir thrust the shield under his feet and stood upon it, wielding the hone with both hands. Th en speedily he saw lightnings and heard great claps of thunder; then he saw Thor in God-like anger, who came forward furiously and swung the hammer and cast it at Hrungnir {p. 118} from afar off. Hrungnir lifted up the hone in bot h hands and cast it against him; it struck the hammer in flight, and the hone burst in sunder: one part fell to the earth, and thence are come all the flint-rocks; the other burst on Thor's head, so that he fell forward to the earth. But the hammer Mjöllnir struck Hrungni r in the middle of the head, and smashed his skull into small crumbs, and he fell fo rward upon Thor, so that his foot lay over"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Thor's neck. Thjálfi struck at Mökkurkálfi, and he fell with little glory. Thereupon Thjálfi went over to Thor and would have lifted Hrungnir's foot off him, but could not find sufficient strength. Straightway all the Æsir came up, when they, learned that Thor was fallen, and would have lifted the foot from off him, and could do nothing. Then Magni came up, son of Thor and Járnsaxa: he was then three nights old; he cast the foot of Hrungnir off Thor, and spake: 'See how ill it is, father, that I came so late: I had struck this giant dead with my fist, methinks, if I had met with him.' Thor arose and welcomed his son, saying that he should surely become great; 'And I will give thee,' he said, the horse Gold-Mane, which Hrungnir possessed.' Th en Odin spake and said that Thor did wrong to give the good horse to the son of a giantess, and not to his father. \"Thor went home to Thrúdvangar, and the hone remained sticking in his head. Then came the wise woman who was called Gróa, wife of Aurvandill the Valiant: she sang her spells over Thor until the hone was loosened. But when Thor knew that, and thought that there was hope that the hone might be removed, he de sired to reward Gróa for her leech-craft and make her glad, and told her these things : that he had waded from the north over Icy Stream and had borne Aurvandill in a basket on his back from the {p. 119} north out of Jötunheim. And he added for a toke n, that one of Aurvandill's toes had stuck out of the basket, and became frozen; wherefor e Thor broke it off and cast it up into the heavens, and made thereof the star called Aurva ndill's Toe. Thor said that it would not be long ere Aurvandill came home: but Gróa was so rejoiced that she forgot her incantations, and the hone was not loosened, and st ands yet in Thor's head. Therefore it is forbidden to cast a hone across the floor, for then the hone is stirred in Thor's head. Thjódólfr of Hvin has made a song after this tale in the Haustlöng . [It says there: On the high and painted surface Of the hollow shield, still further One may see how the Giant's Terror Sought the home of Grjótún; The angry son of Jörd drove To the play of steel; below him Thundered the moon-way; rage swelled In the heart of Meili's Brother.

Then said, Ægir: \"Methinks Hrungnir was of great might. Did Thor accomplish yet more valorous deeds when he had to do w ith the trolls?\" And Bragi answered: \"It is worthy to be told at length, how Thor went to Geirrödr's dwelling. At that time he had not the hammer Mjöllnir with him, nor his Gird le of Might, nor the ir on gauntlets: and that was the fault of Loki, who went with him. For once, flying in his sport with Frigg's hawk- plumage, it had happened to Loki to fly for curi osity's sake into Geirrödr's court. There he saw a great hall, and alighted and looked in through the wi ndow; and Geirrödr looked up and saw him, and commanded that the bird be taken and brought to him, But he who was sent could scarce get to the top of the wall, so high was it; and it seemed pleasant to Loki to see the man striving with toil and pains to reach him, and he thought it was not yet time to fly away until the other had accomp lished the perilous climb. When the man pressed hard after him, then he stretched hi s wings for flight, and thrust out vehemently, but now his feet were stuck fast. [1. Passages enclosed within brackets are c onsidered by Jónsson to be spurious.] {p. 122} So Loki was taken and brought before Geirrö dr the giant; but when Geirrödr saw his eyes, he suspected that this might be a ma n, and bade him answer; but Loki was silent. Then Geirrödr shut Loki into a chest and starved him ther e three months. And now when Geirrödr took him out and co mmanded him to speak, Loki told who he was; and by way of ransom for his life he swore to Geirrödr with oaths that he would get Thor to come into Geirrödr's dwelling in such a fashion that he should have neither hammer nor Girdle of Might with him. \"Thor came to spend the night with that giantess who was ca lled Grídr, mother of Vídarr the Silent. She told Thor the truth concerning Geirrödr, that he was a crafty giant and ill to deal with; and she lent him the Girdle of Might and iron gloves which she possessed, and her staff also, which was called Grídr's R od. Then Thor proceeded to the river named Vimur, greatest of all rivers. There he girded himself with the Girdle of Might and braced firmly downstream with Grídr's Rod, and Loki held on behind by the Girdle of Might. When Thor came to mid-current, the river waxed so greatly that it broke high upon his shoulders. Then Thor sang this: Wax thou not now, Vimur, For I fain would wade thee Into the Giants' garth: Know thou, if thou waxest, Then waxeth God-strength in me As high up as the heaven."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"\"Then Thor saw Gjálp, daughter of Geirrödr, standing in cert ain ravines, one leg in each, spanning the river, {p. 123} and she was causing the spate. Then Thor snat ched up a great stone out of the river and cast it at her, saying these words: 'At its so urce should a river be stemmed.' Nor did he miss that at which he threw. In that moment he came to the shore and took hold of a rowan-clump, and so climbed out of the rive r; whence comes the saying that rowan is Thor's deliverance. \"Now when Thor came before Geirrödr, the companions were shown first into the goat- fold[1] for their entertainment, and there wa s one chair there for a seat, and Thor sat there. Then he became aware that the ch air moved under him up toward the roof: he thrust Grídr's Rod up against the rafters and pushed back hard against the chair. Then there was a great crash, and screaming follo wed. Under the chair had been Geirrödr's daughters, Gjálp and Greip; and he had broken both their backs. Then Geirrödr had Thor called into the hall to play games. There we re great fires the whol e length of the hall. When Thor came up over against Geirrödr, then Geirrödr took up a glowing bar of iron with the tongs and cast it at Thor. Thor caught it with his iron gloves and raised the bar in the air, but Geirrödr leapt be hind an iron pillar to save hims elf. Thor lifted up the bar and threw it, and it passed through the pillar a nd through Geirrödr a nd through the wall, and so on out, even into the eart h.

By his works, by that which he gives or receives or does; he may also be periphrase d in terms of his prope rty, those things which he possesses, and, if he be liberal, of his liber ality; likewise in terms of the families from which he descended, as well as of those wh ich have sprung from him. How is one to periphrase him in terms of these things? T hus, by calling him accomplisher or performer of his goings or his conduct, of his battle s or sea-voyages or huntings or weapons or ships. And because he is a tester of wea pons and a winner of battles,--the words for 'winner' and 'wood' being the same, as are al so those for tester' and 'rowan,'--therefore, from these phrases, skalds have called man Ash or Maple, Grove, or other masculine tree-names, and periphrased him in such expressions in terms of battles or ships or possessions. It is also correct to periphrase man with all the names of the Æsir; also with giant-terms, and this last is for the most part for mocking or libellous purposes. Periphrasis with the names of el ves is held to be favorable. \"Woman should be periphrased with referen ce to all female garments, gold and jewels, ale or wine or any other dri nk, or to that which she dispen ses or gives; likewise with reference to ale-vessels, and to all those thi ngs which it becomes her to perform or to give. It is correct to periphrase {p. 143} her thus: by calling her giver or user of that of which sh e partakes. But the words for 'giver' and 'user' are also names of trees; therefore woman is called in metaphorical speech by all feminine tree-names. Woman is periphrased with reference to jewels or agates for this reason: in heathen times wh at was called a 'stone-necklace,' which they wore about the neck, was a part of a woman's a pparel; now it is used figuratively in such a way as to periphrase woman with stones and all names of stones. Woman is also metaphorically called by the names of the Ásynj ur or the Valkyrs or Norris or women of supernatural kind. It is also correct to periphrase woman in terms of all her conduct or property or family. XXXII. \"How should gold be periphrased?

XXXIII. Wherefore is gold called Ægir's Fire? This tale is to the same purport as we have told before: Ægir went to Ásgard to a feast, but when he was ready to return home, he invited Odin and all the Æsir to visit him in three months' time. First came Odin and Njördr, Freyr, Týr, Bragi, Vídarr, Loki; likewise the Ásynjur: Frigg, Freyja, Gefjun, Skadi, Idunn, Sif. Thor was not there, having gone into the eastern la nds to slay trolls. When the gods had sat down in their pl aces, straightway Ægir had bright gold {p. 144} brought in onto the floor of the hall, and th e gold gave forth light and illumined the hall like fire: and it was used there for lights at hi s banquet, even as in Valhall swords were used in place of fire. Then Loki bandied sh arp words with all the gods, and slew one of Ægir's thralls, him who was called Five-Finge r; another of his thralls was named Fire- Kindler. Rán is the name of Ægir's wife, and their daughters are nine, even as we have written before. At this feas t all things were self-serve d, both food and ale, and all implements needful to the feast. Then th e Æsir became aware that Rán had that net wherein she was wont to catch all men who go upon the sea. Now this tale is to show whence it comes that gold is called Fire or Li ght or Brightness of Ægir, of Rán, or of Ægir's daughters; and now such use is made of these metaphors that gold is called Fire of the Sea, and of all names of the sea, even as Ægir or Rán had names associated with the sea. Therefore gold is now called Fire of Wate rs or of Rivers, and of all river names. \"But these names have fared just as other fi gures also have done: the later skalds have composed after the examples of the old skal ds, even those examples which stood in their poems, but were later expanded into such forms as seemed to later poets to be like what was written before: as a lake is to the sea, or the river to the lake, or the brook to the river. Therefore all these are called new figures, wh en terms are expanded to greater length than what was recorded before; and all this seems well and good, so fair as it concurs with verisimilitude and nature. As Bragi the Skald sang: I was given by the Battler The fire of the Brook of Sea-Fish: {p. 145} He gave it me, with mercy, For the Drink of the Mountain-Giant. XXXIV. \"Why is gold called the Needles, or L eaves; of Glasir? In Ásgard, before the doors of Valhall, there stands a grove which is called Glasir, and its leafage is all red gold, even as is sung here:"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Glasir stands With golden leafage Before the High God's halls. Far and wide, this tree is the fairest known among gods and men. XXXV. \"Why is gold called Sif's Hair? Loki La ufeyarson, for mischief's sake, cut off all Sif's hair. But when Thor learned of this, he seized Loki, and would have broken every bone in him, had he not sworn to get the Black Elves to make Sif hair of gold, such that it would grow like other hair. Afte r that, Loki went to those dw arves who are called Ívaldi's Sons; and they made the hair, and Skídbla dnir also, and the spear which became Odin's possession, and was called Gungnir. Then Loki wagered his head with the dwarf called Brokkr that Brokkr's brother Sind ri could not make three othe r precious things equal in virtue to these. Now when they came to the smithy, Sindri laid a pigs kin in the hearth and bade Brokkr blow, and did not cease work until he took out of the hearth that which he had laid therein. But when he went out of the smithy, while the other dwarf was blowing, straightway a fly settled upon his hand and stung: yet he blew on {p. 146} as before, until the smith took the work out of the hearth; and it was a boar, with mane and bristles of gold. Next, he laid gold in the hearth and bade Brokkr blow and cease not from his blast until he should return. He we nt out; but again the fly came and settled on Brokkr's neck, and bit now half again as hard as before; yet he blew even until the smith took from the hearth that gold ring which is called Draupnir. Then Sindri laid iron in the hearth and bade him blow, sayi ng that it would be spoiled if the blast failed. Straightway the fly settled between Brokkr's eyes and stung his eyelid, but when the blood fell into his eyes so that he could not see, then he clutch ed at it with his hand as swiftly as he could,-- while the bellows grew flat,--and he swept th e fly from him. Then the smith came thither and said that it had come near to spoiling all that was in the hearth. Then he took from the forge a hammer, put all the precious works into the hands of Brokkr hi s brother, and bade him go with them to Ásgard and claim the wager. \"Now when he and Loki brought forward the precious gifts, the Æsir sat down in the seats of judgment; and that verdict was to prevail which Odin, Thor, and Freyr should render. Then Loki gave Odin the spear Gungni r, and to Thor the hair which Sif was to have, and Skídbladnir to Freyr, and told the virtues of all these things: that the spear would never stop in its thrust; the hair w ould grow to the flesh as soon as it came upon Sif's head; and Skídbladnir would have a favor ing breeze as soon as the sail was raised, in whatsoever direction it might go, but could be folded together like a napkin and be kept in Freyr's pouch if he so desired. Then Brokkr brought forward his gifts: he gave to Odin the ring, saying that eight {p. 147}"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"rings of the same weight would drop from it ev ery ninth night; to Fr eyr he gave the boar, saying that it could run thr ough air and water better than any horse, and it could never become so dark with night or gloom of th e Murky Regions that there should not be sufficient light where be went, such was the glow from its mane and bristles. Then he gave the hammer to Thor, and said that T hor might smite as hard as he desired, whatsoever might be before him, and the hamm er would not fail; and if he threw it at anything, it would never miss, and never fly so far as not to re turn to his hand; and if be desired, he might keep it in his sark, it was so small; but indeed it was a flaw in the hammer that the fore-haft was somewhat short. \"This was their decision: that the hammer was best of all th e precious works, and in it there was the greatest defence against the Rime -Giants; and they gave sentence, that the dwarf should have his wager. Then Loki offe red to redeem his head, but the dwarf said that there was no chance of this. 'Take me , then,' quoth Loki; but when Brokkr would have laid hands on him, he was a long way off. Loki had with him those shoes with which he ran through air and over water. Then the dwarf prayed Thor to catch him, and Thor did so. Then the dwarf would have hewn off his head; but Loki said that he might have the head, but not the neck. So the dw arf took a thong and a knife, and would have bored a hole in Loki's lips and stitched his m outh together, but the knife did not cut. Then Brokkr said that it would be bett er if his brother's awl were there: and even as he named it, the awl was there, and pierced the lips. He stitched the Ups together, and Loki ripped the thong out of the edges. Th at thong, with which Loki's mouth was sewn together, is called Vartari. {p. 148} XXXVI. \"One may hear how gold is metaphoric ally called Fulla's Snood, in this verse which Eyvindr Skald-Despoiler wrought: Fulla's shining Fillet, The forehead's sun at rising, Shone on the swelling shield-hill For skalds all Hakon's life-days.

XXXVIII. \"In this place one may hear that gol d is called Word, or Vo ice, of Giants, as we have said before; thus sang Bragi the Skald: Then had I the third friend Fairly praised: the poorest In the Voice of the Botched-Knob's Áli, But best of all to me. He called a rock Botched Knob, and a giant Áli of Rock, and gold Voice of the Giant. XXXIX. \"For what reason is gold called Otter's We rgild? It is related th at when certain of the Æsir, Odin and Loki and Hœnir, went fo rth to explore the earth, they came to a certain river, and proceeded along the river to a waterfall. And beside the fall was an otter, which had taken a salmon from the fall and was eating, blinking his eyes the while. Then Loki took up a stone and cast it at the ot ter, and struck its head. And Loki boasted in his catch, that he had got otter and salmon with one blow. Then they took up the salmon and the otter and bore them along with them, and coming to the buildings of a certain farm, they went in. Now the husbandm an who dwelt there was named Hreidmarr: he was a man of much substance, and very skilled in black magic. The Æsir asked him for a night's lodging, saying that they had sufficient food with them, and showed him {p. 151} their catch. But when Hreidma rr saw the otter, straight wa y he called to him his sons, Fáfnir and Reginn, and told them that the o tter their brother was slain, and who had done that deed. It Now father and sons went up to the Æsi r, seized them, bound them, and told them about the otter, how he was Hreidmarr's son. The Æsir offered a ransom for their lives, as much wealth as Hreidmarr himself desired to appoint; and a covenant was made between them on those terms, and confirmed with oaths. Then the otter was flayed, and Hreidmarr, taking the otter-skin, bade them fill the skin with red gold and also cover it altogether; and that should be the condition of the cove nant between them. Thereupon Odin sent Loki into the Land of the Black El ves, and he came to the dwarf who is called Andvari, who was as a fish in the water. L oki caught him in his hands and required of him in ransom of his life all th e gold that he had in his rock ; and when they came within the rock, the dwarf brought forth all the gold he had, and it was very much wealth. Then"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"the dwarf quickly swept under his hand one little gold ring, but Loki saw it and commanded him to give over the ring. The dwar f prayed him not to take the ring from him, saying that from this ring he could multiply wealth for himself if he might keep it. Loki answered that be should not have one penny left, and took the ring from him and went out; but the dwarf declared that that ring should be th e ruin of every one who should come into possession of it. Loki replied that this seemed well enough to him, and that this condition should hold good provided that he himself brought it to the ears of them that should receive the ring and the curse. He went his way and came to Hreidmarr's dwelling, and showed the {p. 152} gold to Odin; but when Odin saw the ring, it seem ed fair to him, and he took it away from the treasure, and paid the gold to Hreidmarr. Then Hreidmarr filled the otter-skin as much as he could, and set it up when it was full. Ne xt Odin went up, having the skin to cover with gold, and he bade Hreidmarr look whethe r the skin were yet altogether hidden. But Hreidmarr looked at it searchingly, and saw one of the hairs of the snout, and commanded that this be covered, else their covenant should be at an end. Then Odin drew out the ring, and covered the hair , saying that they were now de livered from their debt for the slaying of the otter. But when Odin had ta ken his spear, and Loki his shoes, and they had no longer any need to be afraid, then L oki declared that the curse which Andvari had uttered should be fulfilled: that this ring a nd this gold should be the destruction of him who received it; and that was fulfilled afterwar d. Now it has been told wherefore gold is called Otter's Wergild, or Forced Paymen t of the Æsir, or Metal of Strife. XL. \"What more is to be said of the gold? Hreidmarr took the gold for his son's wergild, but Fáfnir and Reginn claimed some part of their brother' s blood-money for themselves. Hreidmarr would not grant them one penny of the gold. This was the wicked purpose of those brethren: they slew their father for the gold. Then Reginn demanded that Fáfnir share the gold with him, half fo r half. Fáfnir answered that there was little chance of his sharing it with his brother, s eeing that he had slain his fath er for its sake; and he bade Reginn go hence, else he should fare even as Hreidmarr. Fáfnir had taken the helmet which Hreidmarr had possessed, and set it upon his head (this helmet was {p. 153} called the Helm of Terror, of which all livi ng creatures that see it are afraid), and the sword called Hrotti. Reginn had that sword which was named Refill. So he fled away, and Fáfnir went up to Gnita Heath, and made himself a lair, and turned himself into a serpent, and laid him down upon the gold. \"Then Reginn went to King Hjálprekr at Thjód, and there he became his smith; and he took into his fostering Sigurdr, son of Sigmundr , Völsungr's son, and of Hjördís, daughter of Eylimi. Sigurdr was. most illustrious of a ll Host-Kings in race, in prowess, and in mind. Reginn declared to him where Fáfnir la y on the gold, and incited him to seek the gold. Then Reginn fashioned the sword Gramr, which was so sharp that Sigurdr, bringing"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"it down into running water, cut asunder a floc k of wool which drifted down-stream onto the sword's edge. Next Sigurdr clove Reginn's anvil down to the stock with the sword. After that they went, Sigurdr and Reginn, to Gnita Heath, and there Sigurdr dug a pit in Fáfnr's way and laid him self in ambush th erein. And when Fáfnir glided toward the water and came above the pit, Sigurdr straight way thrust his sword through him, and that was his end. \"Then Reginn came forward, sayi ng that Sigurdr had slain his brother, and demanded as a condition of reconciliation that he take Fáfnir's heart and roast it with fire; and Reginn laid him down and drank the blood of Fáfnir , and settled himself to sleep. But when Sigurdr was roasting the heart, and thought that it must be quite roasted, he touched it with his finger to see how hard it was; and then the juice ra n out from the heart onto his finger, so that he was burned and put his fi nger to his mouth. As soon as the heart's blood came upon his tongue, straightway he knew the speech {p. 154} of birds, and he understood what the nuthatc hes were saying which were sitting in the trees. Then one spake: There sits Sigurdr Blood-besprinkled, Fáfnir's heart With flame he roasteth: Wise seemed to me The Spoiler of Rings If the gleaming Life-fibre he ate. There lies Reginn--sang another-- Rede he ponders, Would betray the youth Who trusteth in him: In his wrath he plots Wrong accusation; The smith of bale Would avenge his brother. Then Sigurdr went over to Reginn and slew him, and thence to his horse, which was named Grani, and rode till he came to Fáfnir 's lair. He took up the gold, trussed it up in his saddle-bags, laid it upon Grani's back, mounted up himself, and then rode his ways. Now the tale is told why gold is called Lair or Abode of Fáfnir, or Metal of Gnita Heath, or Grani's Burden. XLI. \"Then Sigurdr rode on till he found a house on the mountain, wherein a woman in helm and birnie lay sleeping. He drew his sword and cut the birnie from her: she"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"{p. 155} awoke then, and gave her name as Hildr: she is called Brynhildr, and was a Valkyr. Sigurdr rode away and came to the ki ng who was named Gjúki, whose wife was Grímhildr; their children were Gunnarr, Högni, Gudrún, Gudný; Gotthormr was Gjúki's stepson. Sigurdr tarried there a long time, and then he obtained the hand of Gudrún, daughter of Gjúki, and Gunna rr and Högni swore oaths of blood brotherhood with Sigurdr. Thereafter Sigurdr and the sons of Gj úki went unto Atli, Budli's son, to sue for the hand of Brynhildr his sister in marriage to Gunnarr. Brynhildr abode on Hinda-Fell, and about her hall there was a flaring fire; a nd she had made a solemn vow to take none but that man who should dare to ride through the flaring fire. \"Then Sigurdr and the sons of Gjúki (who were also called Niflungs) rode up onto the mountain, and Gunnarr should have ridden through the flaring fire: but he had the horse named Goti, and that horse dared not leap into the fire. So they exchanged shapes, Sigurdr and Gunnarr, and names likewise; fo r Grani would go under no man but Sigurdr. Then Sigurdr leapt onto Grani, and rode thr ough the flaring fire. Th at eve he was wedded with Brynhildr. But when they came to bed, he drew the Sword Gramr from its sheath and laid it between them. In the morning when he arose and clothe d himself, he gave Brynhildr as linen-fee the same gold ring which Loki had taken from Andvari, and took another ring from her hand for remembrance. Then Sigurdr mounted his horse and rode to his fellows, and he and Gunnarr changed shapes again and went home to Gjúki with Brynhildr. Sigurdr and Gudrún had two children, Sigmundr and Svanhildr. \"It befell on a time that Brynhild r and Gudrún went to the wate r to wash their hair. And when they came to the {p. 156} river, Brynhildr waded out from the bank well into the river, sayi ng that she would not touch to her head the water which ran out of the hair of Gudrún, since herself had the more valorous husband. Then Gudrún went into the river after her and said that it was her right to wash her hair higher upstream, for the reason that she had to husband such a man as neither Gunnarr nor any other in the world matched in valor, seeing that he had slain Fáfnir and Reginn and succeeded to the herita ge of both. And Brynhildr made answer: 'It was a matter of greater worth that Gunnarr rode through the flaring fire and Sigurdr durst not.' Then Gudrún laughed, and said: 'Dost thou think that Gunnarr rode through the flaring fire? Now I think that he who went into the bride-be d with thee was the same that gave me this gold ring; and the gold ring wh ich thou bearest on thine hand and didst receive for linen-fee is called Andvari's Yiel d, and I believe that it was not Gunnarr who got that ring on Gnita Heath.' Then Brynhildr was silent, and went home. \"After that she egged on Gunnarr and Högni to slay Sigurdr; but because they were Sigurdr's sworn blood-brothers, they stirred up Gotthormr thei r brother to slay him.

There fell"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Sigurdr and Sigmundr, his son of three winters, whom they slew. Then Brynhildr stabbed herself with a sword, and she was burned with Sigurdr; but Gunnarr and Högni took Fáfnir's heritage and Andvari's Yi eld, and ruled the lands thereafter. \"King Atli, Budli's son, and brother of Brynhildr, then wedded Gudrún, whom Sigurdr had had to wife; and they {p. 157} had children. King Atli invited to him Gunnarr and Högni, and they came at his invitation. Yet before they departed from thei r land, they hid the gold, Fáfnir's heritage, in the Rhine, and that gold has never since been found. Now King Atli had a host in readiness, and fought with Gunnarr and Högni; and they were made captive. King Atli bade . the heart be cut out of Högni alive, and that was his end. Gunnarr he caused to be cast into a den of serpents. But a harp was brought secretly to Gunnarr, and he struck it with his toes, his hands being bound; he played the harp so that all the serpents fell asleep, saving only one adder, which glided ove r to him, and gnawed into the cartilage of his breast-bone so far that her head sank w ithin the wound, and she cl ove to his liver till he died. Gunnarr and Högni were called Nifl ungs and Gjúkungs, for which reason gold is called Treasure, or Heri tage, of the Niflungs. [\"A little while after, Gudrún sl ew her two sons, and caused fl agons to be made of their skulls, set with gold and silver. Then the f uneral-feast was held for the Niflungs; and at this feast Gudrún had mead poured into th e flagons for King Atli, and the mead was mixed with the blood of the boys. Moreover, she caused their hearts to be roasted and set before the king, that he might eat of them. A nd when he had eaten, then she herself told him what she had done, with many scathing wo rds. There was no lack of strong drink there, so that most of the company had fallen asleep where they sat. That night she went to the king while he slept, and Högni's son with her; they smote the king, and that was the death of him. Then they set fire to the hall, and burned the folk that were within. After that she went to the shore and leap ed into the sea, desiring to make {p. 158} an end of herself; but she was tossed by the billows over the firth, and was borne to King Jónakr's land. And when he saw her, he t ook her to him and wedded her, and they had three sons, called Sörli, Hamdir, and Erpr: th ey were all raven-black of hair, like Gunnarr and Högni and the other Niflungs. There Sva nhildr, daughter of the youth Sigurdr, was reared, and of all women she was fairest. King Jörmunrekkr the Mighty learned of her beauty, and sent his son Randvér to woo her a nd bring her to be his wife. When Randvér had come to the court of Jónakr, Svanhildr was given into his hands, and he should have! brought her to King Jörmunrekkr. But Earl Bi kki said that it was a better thing for Randvér to wed Svandhildr, since he and sh e were both young, whereas Jörmunrekkr was old. This counsel pleased the young folk well. Thereupon Bikki reported the matter to the king. Straightway, King Jörmunrekkr commanded that his son be seiz ed and led to the gallows. Then Randvér took his hawk and plucke d off ins feathers, and bade that it be"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"sent so to his father; after which he wa s hanged. But when King Jörmunrekkr saw the hawk, suddenly it came home to him that even as the hawk was featherless and powerless to fly, so was his kingdom shorn of its might , since he was old and childless. Then King Jörmunrekkr, riding out of the wood where he had been hunting, beheld Svanhildr as she sat washing her hair: they rode upon her and trod her to death under their horses' feet. \"But when Gudrún learned of this, she urged on her sons to take vengeance for Svanhildr. When they were preparing for their journey, she gave them birnies and helmets so strong that iron could not bite into them. She laid these instructions upon them: that, when they were come to King Jörmunrekkr, they shoul d go up to him by ni ght as he slept: {p. 159} Sörli and Hamdir should hew off his hands a nd feet, and Erpr his head. But when they were on their way, they asked Erpr what help they might expect from him, if they met King Jörmunrekkr. He answered that he woul d render them such aid as the hand affords the foot. They said that that help which th e foot received from the hand was altogether nothing. They were so wroth with their mother that she had sent them away with angry words, and they desired so eagerly to do what would seem worst to her, that they slew Erpr, because she loved him most of all. A litt le later, while Sörli was walking, one of his feet slipped, and he supported himself on his hand; and he said: 'Now the hand assists the foot indeed; it were better now that Erpr were living.' Now when they came to King Jörmunrekkr by night, where he was sleeping, and hewed hands and feet off him, he awoke and called upon his men, and bade them arise. And then Hamdir spake, saying: 'The head had been off by now, if Erpr live d.' Then the henchmen rose up and attacked them, but could not overmaster them with w eapons; and Jörmunrekkr called out to them to beat them with stones, a nd it was done. There Sörli and Hamdir fell, and now all the house and offspring of Gjúki were dea d. A daughter named Áslaug lived after young Sigurdr; she was reared with Heimir in Hlym dalir, and great houses are sprung from her. It is said that Sigmundr, Vö lsungr's son, was so strong that he could drink venom and receive no hurt; and Sinfjötli his son and Sigurdr were so hard-skinned that no venom from without could harm them: wherefore Bragi the Skald has sung thus: When the wriggling Serpent Of the Völsung's Drink hung writhing {p. 160} On the hook of the Foeman Of Hill-Giants' kindred.

This is the tale thereof: One of Odin's sons, named Skjöldr,--from whom the Skjöldungs ar e come,--had his abode and ruled in the"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"realm which now is called Denmark, but then was known as Gotland. Skjöldr's son, who ruled the land after him, was named Fridleif r. Fridleifr's son was Fródi: he succeeded to the kingdom after his father, in the time wh en Augustus Caesar imposed peace on all the world; at that time Christ was born. But becau se Fródi was mightiest of all kings in the Northern lands, the peace was called by hi s name wherever the Danish tongue was spoken; and men call it the Peace of Fródi. No man injured any other, even though he met face to face his father's slayer or his brothe r's, loose or bound. Neither was there any thief nor robber then, so that a gold ring lay long on Jalangr's Heath. King Fródi {p. 162} went to a feast in Sweden at the court of the king who was called Fjölnir, and there he bought two maid-servants, Fenja and Menja: th ey were huge and str ong. In that time two mill-stones were found in Denmark, so great that no one was so strong that he could turn them: the nature of the mill was such that whatsoever he who turned asked for, was ground out by the mill-stones. This mill was called Grótti. He who gave King Fródi the mill was named Hengikjöptr. King Fródi had the maid-servants led to the mill, and bade them grind gold; and they did so. First they ground gold and, peace and happiness for Fródi; then he would grant them rest or sleep no longer than the cuckoo held its peace or a song might be sung. It is said that they sa ng the song which is called the Lay of Grótti, and this is its beginning: Now are we come To the king's house, The two fore-knowing, Fenja and Menja: These are with Fródi Son of Fridleifr, The Mighty Maidens, As maid-thralls held. And before they ceased their singing, they gr ound out a host against Fródi, so that the sea-king called Mýsingr came there that same night and slew Fródi, taking much plunder. Then the Peace of Fródi was ended. Mýsingr to ok Grótti with him, and Fenja and Menja also, and bade them grind salt. And at mi dnight they asked whether Mýsingr were not weary of salt. He bade them grind longer. They had ground but a little while, when down sank the ship; and from that {p. 163} time there has been a whirlpool the sea wher e the water falls through the hole in the mill- stone.

In Denmark there was a king called Hrólfr Kraki: he was most renowned {p. 170} of all ancient kings for m unificence, valor, and gracious ness. One evidence of his graciousness which is often brought into storie s is this: A little lad and poor, Vöggr by name, came into the hall of King Hrólfr. At that time the king was young, and of slender stature. Vöggr came into his presence and looked up at him; and the king said: 'What wouldst thou say, lad, for thou lookest at me ?' Vöggr answered: 'When I was at home, I heard say that Hrólfr the ki ng at Hleidr was the greatest man in the northern lands; but now there sitteth in the high seat a little po le, and he is called King.' Then the king made answer: 'Thou, boy, hast given me a name, so that I shall be called Hrólfr the Pole (Kraki); and it is the custom that the givi ng of a name be accompanied by a gift. Now I see that with the name which thou has fastened on me, thou hast no gift such as would be acceptable to me, wherefore he that has wherewit h to give shall give to the other.' And he took from his hand a gold ring and gave it to hi m. Then Vöggr said: 'Above all kings be thou most blessed of givers! Now I swear an oa th that I shall be th at man's slayer who slays thee.' Then spake the king, laughing loudl y: 'Vöggr is pleased with a small thing.' \"Another example is the tale told concerning the valor of Hrólfr Kraki: That king whom men call Adils ruled over Uppsala; he had to wi fe Yrsa, mother of Hrólfr Kraki. He was at strife with the king who ruled over Norwa y, whose name was Ali; the two joined battle on the ice of the lake called Vaeni. King Adils sent an embassy to Hrólfr Kraki, his stepson, praying him to come to his aid, and promised wages to all his host so long as they should be away; King Hrólfr himself s hould have three precious gifts, whatsoever three he might choose from all Sweden. {p. 171} King Hrólfr could not make the journey in person, owing to the strife in which he was engaged with the Saxons; but he sent to Adils his twelve berserks: Bödvar-Bjarki was there for one, and Hjalti the Stout-Hearted, Hvítserkr the Stern, Vöttr Véseti, and the brethren Svipdagr and Beigudr. In that battle King Áli fell, and the great part of his host with him; and King Adils took from him in death the helm Battle-Swine and his horse Raven. Then the berserks of Hrólfr Kraki demanded for their hire three pounds of gold fo r each man of them; and in addition they required that they might bear to Hrólfr Krak i those gifts of price which they had chosen for him: which were the Helm Battle-Boar and the birnie Finn's Heritage,--on neither of which iron would take hold, --and the gold ring which was called Pig of the Swedes, which Adils' forefathers had had. But the king de nied them all these things, nor did he so much as pay their hire: the berserks went away ill-pleased with their share, and told the state of things to Hrólfr Kraki. \"Straightway he begin his journe y to Uppsala; and when he had brought his ships into the river Fýri, he rode at once to Uppsala, and hi s twelve berserks with him, all without safe- conduct. Yrsa, his mother, welcomed him and led him to lodgings, but not to the king's hall: fires were made there before them, a nd ale was given them to drink. Then men of King Adils came in and heaped firewood onto the fire, and made it so great that the clothes were burnt off Hrólfr and his men. And the fellows sp ake: 'Is it true that Hrólfr"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Kraki and his berserks shun neither fire nor iron?' Then Hrólfr Kraki leapt up, and all they that were with him; and he said: {p. 172} 'Add we to the fire In Adils' dwelling!' took his shield and cast it onto the fire, and l eapt over the flames, wh ile the shield burnt; and he spake again: 'He flees not the flames Who o'er the fire leapeth!' Even so did his men, one after another; and they laid hands on those fellows who had heaped up the fire, and cast them into the flames. Then Yrsa came and gave Hrólfr Kraki a deer's horn full of gold, the ring Pig of the Swedes being with the gold; and she bade them ride away to the host. They vaulted on to their horses and rode down into the Plain of the Fýri; and soon they saw King Adils ridi ng after them with his host all in armor, hoping to slay them. Then Hrólfr Kraki plunged his right hand down into the horn, grasped the gold, and strewed it all about the road. When the Swedes saw that, they leapt down out of their saddles, and each took up as much as he could lay hold of; but King Adils bade them ride on, and himself rode furiously . His horse was called Slöngvir, swiftest of all horses. Then Hrólfr Kraki saw that King Adils wa s drawing close up to him, took the ring, Pig of the Swedes, and threw it toward him, and bade him receive it as a gift. King Adils rode at the ring and thrust at it with his spear-point, and let it slide down over the shaft-socket. Then Hrólfr Krak i turned back and saw how he bent down, and spake: 'Now I have made him who is mi ghtiest of Swedes stoop as a swine stoops.' Thus they parted. For this cause gold is called Seed of Kraki or of Fýri's Plain. Thus sang Eyvindr Skald-Despoiler: {p. 173} God of the blade of battle, We bear through Hákon's life-days The Seed of Fýri's valley On our arms, where sits the falcon. Even as Thjódólfr sang: The king sows the bright seed-corn Of knuckle-splendid gold rings, With the crop of Yrsa's offspring, In his company's glad hand-grasp; The guileless 'Land-Director With Kraki's gleaming barley"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Sprinkles my arms, the flesh-grown Seat of the hooded falcon.

Thus sang Skúli Thorsteinsson: When I reddened Reifnir's Roof-Bane, The ravening sword, for wealth's sake At Svöldr, I heaped with gold rings Warlike Hölgi's cairn-thatch.

The Drink of Whal es is the sea; Amber of the Sea is gold; woman is the Willow, or Dealer, of that gold which she gives; and the willow is a tree.

Shields, periphrased in figur es of warships, are called Sun, or Moon, or Leaf, or Sheen, or Garth, of the Ship; the shield is also called Ship of Ullr, or periphrased in terms of Hrungnir's feet, since he st ood upon his shield. On ancient shields it {p. 183} was customary to paint a circle, which was called the 'ring,' and shields are called in metaphors of that ring. Hewing weapons, axes or swords, are called Fires of Blood, or of Wounds; swords are called Odin's Fires; but men call axes by the names of troll-women, and periphrase them in terms of blood or w ounds or a forest or wood. Thrusting weapons are properly periphrased by cal ling them by names of serpents or fishes. Missile weapons are often metaphorically termed hail or sleet or storm.

XLIX. \"Battle is called Storm or Snow-S hower of the Hjadnings, and weapons are termed Fire or Wands of Hjadnings; and this is the tale thereof: that king who was called Högni had a daughter named Hildr: her King He dinn, son of Hjarrandi, took as the spoils of war, while King Högni attended an assembly of kings. But when he learned that there had been raiding in his realm and his daughter had been borne off, he departed with his host to seek Hedinn, and heard tidings of hi m, that he was proceeding northward along the land. When Högni had come into Norway, he learned that Hedinn had sailed westward over the sea. Then Högni sailed af ter him, even to the Orkneys; and when he landed at the place called Hoy, Hedinn was already there before him with his host. Then Hildr went to meet her father, and offe red him a necklace on Hedinn's behalf, for reconciliation and peace; but if it were not acc epted, she said, Hedinn was ready to fight, and Högni might hope for no mercy at his hands. \"Högni answered his daughter harshly; and wh en she returned to Hedinn, she told him that Högni desired no reconciliation, and she ba de him make ready for battle. So did both parties: they went to the island and marshalled {p. 189} their hosts. Then Hedinn called to Högni his father-in-law, offeri ng him reconciliation and much gold in compensation. But Högni answered: 'Thou hast made this offer over- late, if thou wouldst make p eace: for now I have drawn Dá insleif, which the dwarves made, and which must cause a man's death ev ery time it is bared, nor ever fails in its stroke; moreover, the wound heals not if one be scratched with it.' Then said Hedinn:"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"'Thou dost boast in the sword, but not in th e victory; I call any sword good which is faithful to its lord.' Then they began that famous battle which is called the Hjadnings' Strife, and they fought all that day, but at evening the kings went to their ships. Now Hildr went to the slain by night, and with ma gic quickened all those that were dead. The next day the kings went to the battlefield and fought, and so did all those that had fallen on the day before. So the fight went one day after the other: all who fell, and all those weapons which lay on the field, and the shields also, were turned to stone; but when day dawned, up rose all the dead men and fought, a nd all weapons were renewed. It is said in songs that in this fashion the Hjadnings sha ll continue unto the Weir d of the Gods. Bragi the Skald composed verses after this tale in Ragnarr Lodbrók's Song of Praise : And the belovèd Maiden Of the veins' blood-letting Purposed to bring, for wrath's sake, The bow-storm to her father: When the ring-wearing lady, The woman full of evil, Bore the neck-ring of War-Doom To the Battler of the Wind's Steeds. {p. 190} That gory Wound-Amender To the glorious Monarch offered The necklace not for fear's sake, At the mote of fatal weapons: Ever as restraining battle She seemed, although she goaded Warriors to walk the death-road With the ravening Wolf's dire Sister.

King of the Heavens, as Markús sang: The King of the Wind-House fashioned Earth, sky, and faithful peoples; Christ, sole Prince of Mortals, Hath power o'er all that liveth.

King of Jordan, as Sigvatr sang: Four angels the King of Jordan Sent long ago through aether To earthward; and the stream washed The holy head of the World's Lord. King of Greeks, as Arnórr sang: I have lodged for the hero's ashes Prayers with the Lordly Warder Of Greeks and men of Gardar: Thus I pay my Prince for good gifts. Thus sang Eilífr Kúlnasveinn: The Glory of Heaven praises Man's Prince: He is King of all things. Here he called Christ, first, King of Men, and again, King of All. Eínarr Skúlason sang: He who compasseth, Bright in Mercy, All the world, and gently careth For all, caused the realm of Heaven To ope for the valiant ruler. {p. 197} LII. \"There the metaphors coincide; and he who interprets the language of poesy learns to distinguish which king is meant; for it is co rrect to call the Emperor of Constantinople King of Greeks, and similarly to call the ki ng who rules over the land of Jerusalem King of Jerusalem, and also to call the Emperor of Rome King of Rome, and to call him King of Angles' who governs England. But that pe riphrasis which was cited but now, which called Christ King of Men, may be had by, every king. It is proper to periphrase all kings by calling them Land-Rulers, or Land-Warde rs, or Land-Attackers, or Leader of Henchmen, or Warder of the People. Thus sang Eyvindr Skald-Despoiler:"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Who filled the ravens From life was reft By the Earth-Rulers At Ögló.[1] And as Glúmr Geirason sang: The Prince beneath the helmet Reddened the sword hone-hollowed On the Geats: there the Land-Warder Was found in the grinding spear-din.

It is right also to call him King of Kings, under whom are tributary kings. An emperor is highest of kings, and next under him is that king who reigns over a nation; and each of these is equal to the other in the periphrase s made of them in poesy. Next to them are those men who are called earls or tributary kings : and they are equal in periphrasis with a king, save that one may not term them kings of nations. And thus sang Arnórr Earl's Skald concerning Earl Thorfinnr: Let the men hear how the Earl's King, Hardy of mind, the sea sought: The overwhelming Ruler Failed not to thwart the ocean. Next to these in the figures of poesy ar e those men who are ca lled chiefs: one may periphrase them as one might a king or an earl , calling them Dispensers of Gold, Wealth Munificent, Men of the Standards, and Captains of the Host, or Van-Leaders of the Array"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"or of Battle; since each king of a nation, who rules over many lands, appoints tributary kings and earls in joint authority with himsel f, to administer the laws of the land and defend it from attack in those parts which lie far removed from the king. And in those parts they shall be equal with the king's self in giving {p. 199} judgment and meting punishment. Now there are many districts in one land; and it is the practice of kings to appoint ju sticiars over as many districts as one chooses to give into their hands. These justiciars ar e called chiefs or landed men in the Danish tongue, reeves in Saxony, and barons in England. They are also to be righteous judges and faithful warriors over the land which is entrusted to th em for governance. If the king is not near, then a standard shall be borne before them in battle; and then they are quite as lawful war-captains as kings or earls. \"Next under them are those men who are called franklins: they are those freeholders who are of honorable kindred, and possessed of full rights. One may periphrase them by calling them Wealth-Givers, and Protectors, and Reconcilers of Me n; headmen also may have these titles. \"Kings and earls have as their following the men called henchmen and house-carles; landed-men also have in their service thos e who are called henchmen in Denmark and Sweden, and house-carles in Norway, and these men swear oaths of service to them, even as henchmen do to kings. The house-carles of kings were often called henchmen in the old heathen time. Thus sang Thorvaldr Blending Skald: Hail, King, swift in the onset! And thy sturdy house-carles with thee! In their mouths men have my verses, Made for a song of praising. King Haraldr Sigurdarson composed this: The man full mighty waiteth The filling of the King's seat; {p. 200} Oft, I find, to the Earl's heels Throngs my host of house-carles. Henchmen and house-carles may be periphras ed by calling them House-Guard, or Wage- Band, or Men of Honor: thus sang Sigvatr:"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"I learned the Warrior's Wage-Band On the water fought that battle Newly: 't is not the smallest Snow-shower of Shields I tell of.

See page 176.] {p. 201} The Counsellor battle-mighty Of the Prince, whom boldness pleases, Lets the feud-fiery weeds of Högni, Hammer-beaten, clash upon him. As Snaebjörn sang: The Speech-Friend of Kings letteth The long-hulled steer-rope's Race-Horse Steady the swordlike steel beak Of the ship against the stern wave.

[1. See page 136.] {p. 202} He called the Earl True Fr iend of the King, and Hákon, Son of Earl Sigurdr. And Thjódólfr sang thus concerning Haraldr: About Ólafr's sire Waxed the steel-knife-storm's ire, That of wightness each deed Is worthy fame's meed. And again: Jarizleifr could espy Where the king passed by: The brave, sainted lord's kin Stoutly praise did win. And again he sang: Breath-bereft is he Who o'er all bore the gree,-- Of chiefs kinsman mild, Haraldr's brother's child.

The mouth one should periphrase by calling it Land or House of the Tongue or of th e Teeth, of Words or of the Palate, of the Lips, or the like; and if the metaphors used are not traditional, then men may call the mouth Ship, and the lips the Planks, and the tongue Oar or Tiller of the Ship. The teeth are sometimes called Gravel or Rocks of Words, of the Mouth, or of the Tongue. The tongue is often called Sword of Speech or of the Mouth]. The hair which stands on the lips is called Beard, Moustache, or Whiskers. Hair is called Nap; th e hair of women is called Tresses. Hair is termed Locks.

The heart is called grain-sheaf; [one should periphrase it by terming it Grain or Stone or Apple or Nut or Ball, or the like, in figures of the breast or of feeling. More over, it may be called House or Earth or Mount of Feeling. One should periphrase the breast by calling it House or Garth or Ship of the Heart, of Breath, or of the Liver; Land of Energy, of Feeling, and of Memory]. Fee ling is affection and emotion, love, passion, desire, love-longing. [Passion s hould be periphrased by callin g it Wind of Troll Women; also it is correct to name what one soever is desired, and to name giants, periphrasing giantesses as Woman or Mother or Daughter of the Giants.] Feeling is also called mood, liking, eagerness, courage, act ivity, memory, understanding, {p. 239}"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"temper, humor, good faith.

The legs may be called Tree of the Soles, of th e Insteps, of the Ankles, or the like; Running Shaft of the Road or of the Way or the Pace; one may call th e leg Tree or Post of all these. The legs are periphrased in metaphors of snowshoes, s hoes, and breeks.] The parts of the legs are called thigh, knee, calf, lower leg, upper leg, instep, arch, sole, toe; [one may periphrase the leg in terms of all these, calling it Tree, Mast, and Yard thereof; and in metaphors of them all].

It is called subtlety, wiliness, falsehood, fickleness. LXXIV. \"Expression is of two ki nds: that which is called voice, and that which is called manners; manners is also temper. Reiði [2] also has double meaning: reiði [2] is the ill humor of a man, and reiði [2] is also the rigging of a ship or the driving-ge ar of a horse. Fár also has double meaning: fár [2] signifies wrath, and far [2] signifies a ship. \"Men have made frequent use of such ambi guous expressions as thes e; and this practice is called punning. [ Lith [3] is that part of a man where bones meet; lið is a word for ship; lið means people; when a man renders an other assistance, his aid is lið ; líð signifies ale. Hlið signifies the gate in a garth; hliðr men call an ox, and hlíð signifies a slope. One may make such use of these distinct meanings in skaldship as to make a pun that is hard to interpret, provided one employ other distinctions than thos e which are indicated by the half-lines which precede.
