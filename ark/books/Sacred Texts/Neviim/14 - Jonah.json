But Jonah was gone down into the innermost parts of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep. 1:6 So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him: 'What meanest thou that thou sleepest? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.' 1:7 And they said every one to his fellow: 'Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us.' So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah. 1:8 Then said they unto him: 'Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us: what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?' 1:9 And he said unto them: 'I am an Hebrew; and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.' 2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"1:10 Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him: 'What is this that thou hast done?'
