And who can abide in the fierceness of His anger? His fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken asunder before Him. 1:7 the Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and He knoweth them that take refuge in Him. 1:8 But with an overrunning flood He will make a full end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue His enemies. 1:9 What do ye devise against the Lord?
