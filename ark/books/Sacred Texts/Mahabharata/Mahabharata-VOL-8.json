The bigh-souled sons of Pandu desired to pass the period of mourning,* which extended for a month, outside the Kuru city. After king Yudhishthira the just had performed the water-rites, many high-souled sages crowned with ascetic success and many foremost of regenerate Rhhis came there to see the monarch. Among them were the Island-born (Vyasa) and Narada, and the great Bishi Devala, and Devasthana, and Kanwa. They were all accompanied by best of their pupils. Many other members of the regenerate order, possessed of wisdom and accomplished in the Vedas leading lived of domesticity or belonging to the Snataka class, came to' behold the Kuru king. Those high-souled ones, as they came were duly worshipped (by Yudhishthira). The great Bishis then took their seats on costly carpets. Accepting the worship suited to that period (of mourning and impurity) that was offered them, they sat in due order around the king Thousands of Brahmanas offered consolation and comfort to that king of kings residing on the sacred banks of the Bhagirathi with heart exceedingly agitated by grief. Then Narada, after having accosted the Bishis with the Island-born for their first, in due time, addressed Yudhishthira the son of Dharma, saying,.. .Through the might of thy arms and the grace of Madhava the whole Earth, Yudhishthira, hath been righteously won by thee ! By good luck, thou hast escaped with life from this dreadful battle J Observant as thou art of the duties of a Kshatriya, dost thou not rejoice, son of Pandu ? Having slain all thy foes, shalt thou not gratify thy friends, O king?^ Having obtained this prosperity, I hope, grief doth not afflict thee still ? \"Yudhishthira said,.. .'Indeed, the whole Earth hath been subjugated by me through my reliance on the might of Krishna's arms, through the grace of the Brahmanas, and through the strength of Bhima and Arjuna ! This heavy grief, however, is always sitting in my heart, viz., that through covetousness I have caused this dreadful carnage of kinsmen !

Approaching Rama, he bent his head unto him and said, I am a Brahmana of Bhrigu's race ! This procured honour for him. With this knowledge about his birth and family, Rama received him kindly and said, Thou art welcome ! at which Kama became highly glad. While residing on the Mahandra mountains that resembled heaven itself, Kama met andcnixed with many Gandharvas, Yakshas, and gods. Residing there, he acquired all the weapons duly, and became a great favourite of the gods, the Gandhhar- vas, and the Rakshasas. One day he roved on the sea coast by the side of that asylum. Indeed, Surya's son, armed with bow and sword, wandered alone. While thus employed, O Partha, he inadvertently slew, without willing it, the Homa cow of a certain utterer of Brahma who daily per- formed his Agnihotra rite. Knowing that he had perpetrated that act from inadvertence, he informed the Brahmana of it. Indeed, Kama, for the object of gratifying the owner, repeatedly said, holy one, I have killed this thy cow without willing it ! Forgive the act ! Filled with wrath, the Brahmana, rebuking him, said these words! O thou of wicked conduct, thou deservest to be killed ! Let the fruit of this act be thine, O thou of wicked soul !

Observant of ascetic penances, Rama cheerfully communicated, with due forms, unto his penance-observing disciple, everything about the Brahma weapon with the mantras for withdrawing it. Having acquired a knowledge of that weapon, Kama began to pass his days happily in Bhrigu's retreat, and endued with worderful prowess, he devoted himself with great ardour to the science of weapons. One day Bama of great intelligence, while roving with Kama in the vicinity of his retreat, felt himself very weak inconsequence of the fasts he had undergone. From affection begotten by confidence, the tired son of Jamadagni, placing his head on Kama's lap, slept soundly. While his preceptor was thus sleeping (with head) on his lap, a frightful worm, whose bite was very painful and which subsisted on phlegm and fat and flesh and blood, approached the presence of Kama. That blood-drinking worm, approaching Kama's thigh, began to pierce it. Through fear of ( awaking ) his preceptor, Kama became unable to either throw away or kill that animal. Though his limb was bored through by that worm, O Bharata, the son of Surya, lest his preceptor should awake, suffered it to do its pleasure. Though the pain was intolerable, Kama bore it with heroic patience, and continued to hold Bhrigu's son on his lap, without quivering in the least and without manifesting any sign of pain. When at last Kama's blood touched the body of Bama of great energy, the latter awoke and said these words in fear, Alas, I have been made impure ! What is this that tbou art doing ! Tell me, casting off all fear, what is the truth of this matter .'-Then Kama informed him of that worm's bite. Rama saw that worm which resembled a hog in shape. It had eight feet and very keen teeth, and it was covered with bristles that were all pointed like needles. Called by the name of Alarka, its limbs were then shrunk ( with fear ). As soon as Rama cast his eyes on it, the worm gave up its life-breaths, melting in that blood which it had drawn. All this seemed wonderful. Then in the welkin was seen a Rakshasa of terrible form, dark in hue, of a red neck, capable of assuming any form at will, and staying on the clouds, ...His object fulfilled, the Rakshasa, with joined hands, address- ed Rama, saying, O best of ascetics, thou hast rescued me from this bell!

Tell me all this ! He answered, Formerly I was a great Asura of the name of Dansa. In the Krita period, O sire, I was of the same age with Bhrigu ! I ravished the dearly-loved spouse of that sage. Through his curse I fell down on the Earth in the form of a worm !

Once on a time, O monarch, many kings repaired to a Self-choice at the capital of Chitrangada, the ruler of the country of the Kalingas. The city, O Bharata, full of opulence, was known by the name of Rajapura. Hundreds of rulers repaired thither for obtaining the hand of the maiden. Hearing that diverse kings had assem- bled tkere, Duryodhana also, on his golden car, proceeded thither, accompanied by Kama. When the festivities commenced in that Self- choice, diverse rulers, O best of kings, came thither for the hand of the maiden. There were amongst them Sisupala and Jarasandha andBhishmaka * Literally, \"shall not appear to thee by inward light.\"...

Besides these, many others who dwelt in the countries of the South, and many preceptors ( in arm ) of the mleccha tribes, and many rulers from the East and the Nerth, O Bharata, came there. All of them were adorned with golden Angadas t and possessed of the splendour of pure gold. Of effulgent bodies, they were like tigers of fierce might. After all those kings had taken their seats, O Bharata, the maiden entered the arena, accompanied by her nurse and a guard of eunuchs. Whilst being informed of the names of the kings ( as she made her round ), that maiden of the fairest complexion passed by the son of Dhritarashtra ( as she had passed others before him ). Duryodhana, how- ever, of Kuru's race, could not tolerate that rejection of himself. Dis- regarding all the kings, he commanded the maiden to stop. Intoxicated with the pride of energy, and relying upon Bhishma and Drona, king Duryodhana, taking up that maiden on his car, abducted her with force. Armed with sword, clad in mail, and his fingers cased in leathern fences, Kama, that foremost of all wielders of weapons, riding on his car, proceed- ed along Duryodhana's rear. A great uproar then took place among the kings, all of whom were actuated by the desire for fight... .Put on your coats of mail 1 Let the cars be made ready !...( These were the sounds that were heard ). Filled with wrath, they pursued Kama and Duryodhana, showering their arrows upon them like masses of clouds pouring rain upon a couple of hills. As they thus pursued them, Kama felled their bows and arrows on the ground, each with a single arrow. Amongst them some became bowless, some rushed bow in hand, some were on the point of shooting their shafts, and some pursued them, armed with darts and maces. Possessed of great lightness of hands, Kama, that foremost of all smiters, afflicted them all. He deprived many kings of their drivers, and thus van- quished all those lords of Earth. They then themselves took up the reins of their steeds, and saying,. ..Go away, go away,. ..turned away from the battle with cheerless hearts. Protected by Karna, Duryodhana also came away, with a joyous heart, bringing with him the maiden to the city called after elephant.\" SECTION V \"Narada said, ...'Hearing of the fame of Kama's might, the ruler of the Magadhas, viz., king Jarasandha, challenged him to a single combat. Both conversant with celestial weapons, a fierce battle took place between them in which they struck each other with diverse kinds of arms.

From friendship he then gave unto Kama the town Malini.

Thus Kama became famous on Earth for the valour of his arms. When, for thy good, the Lord of the celestials begged of him his (natural) coat of mail and ear-rings, stupefied by celestial illusion, he gave away those precious possessions. Deprived of his ear-rings and divested of his natural armour, he was slain by Arjuna in Vasudeva's presence. In consequence of a Brahmana's curse, as also of the curse of the illustrious Rama, of the boon granted to Kunti and the illusion practised on him by Indra, of his depreciation by Bhishma as only half a oar-warrior, at the tale of Rathas and Atirathas t of the destruction of his energy caused by Salya (with his keen speeches), of Vasudeva's policy, and, lastly, of the celestial weapons obtained by Arjuna from Rudra and Indra and Yama and Varuna and Kuvera and Drona and the illustrious Kripa, the wielder of Gandiva succeeded in slaying Vikartana's son Kama of effulgence like that of Surya himself !

The royal sage Yudhishthira, filled with grief, became plunged in meditation. Beholding that hero cheerless and un- manned by sorrow, sighing like a snake and shedding copious tears, Kunti, herself filled with grief and almost deprived of her senses by sorrow, addressed him in these sweet words of grave import and well suited to the occasion : mighty-armed Yudhishthira, it behoveth thee not to give way to sorrow thus I thou of great wisdom, kill this grief of thine, and listen to what I say 1 I tried in past times to apprise Kama of his brother- ship with thee.

Without having enjoyed the pleasure of this world, and without having paid off the debts they owed to their sires and the gods, they have repaired to Yama's abode ! Alas, O mother, those kings have been slain just at that time when their parents expected to reap the fruits of their might and wealth 1* They were always filled with envy and a hankering after earthly objects, and were exceed- ingly subject to anger and joy.

The fault, however, is really ascribable to the sons of Dhritarashtra. Duryodhana's heart was always set upon guile. Always cherishing malice, he was addicted to deception. Although we never offended him, yet he always behaved falsely towards us ! We have not gained our object, nor have they gained theirs. We have not vanquish- ed them, nor have they vanquished us. The Dhartarashtras could not enjoy this Earth, nor could they enjoy women and music. They did not listen to the counsels of ministers and friends and men learned in the scriptures. They could not, indeed, enjoy their costly gems and well-filled treasury and vast territories. Burning with the hate they bore us, they could not obtain happiness and peace. Beholding our aggrandisement, Duryodhana became colourless, pale and emaciated. Suvala's son informed king Dhritarashtra of this. As a father full of affection for his son, Dhritarashtra tolerated the evil, policy his son pursued. Without doubt, by disregarding Vidura and the high-souled son of Ganga, and in conse- quence of his neglect in restraining his wicked and covetous son, entirely governed by his passions, the king has met with destruction like my poor self. Without doubt, Suyodhana, having caused his uterine brothers to be slain and having oast this couple into burning grief, hath fallen off from his blazing fame 1 Burning with the hate he bore to us Duryodhana was always of a sinful heart.

It so happened that Indra became compassionate towards them.

The lives of such men are worthy of every praise.

And since those men of little understanding live by abandoning the eternal paths of the gods, the paths of the Rishis, and the paths of Brahma, there- fore, they attain to paths disapproved of by the SrutisJ There is an ordina- nce in the mantras which says, Ye sacrificer, perform the sacrifice repre- sented by gifts of valuable things !

Therefore, ye should perform such sacrifices and such penances in the shape of gifts ! The due performance of these eternal duties, viz., the worship of the gods, the study of the Vedas, and the gratification of the Pitris, as also regardful services unto the preceptors these are called the austerest of penances. The gods, by performing such exceedingly difficult penances, have obtained the highest glory and power. I, therefore, tell you to bear the very heavy burthen of the duties of domesticity! Without doubt, penances are the foremost of all things and are the root of all creatures. Asceticism, how- ever, is to be obtained by leading a life of domesticity, upon which depends everything.

Creepers and trees and deciduous herbs, and animals that are clean, and clarified butter, were created as ingredients of sacrifice.

Thus, king, in this world, whose course is such, everything is dependent on the rod of chastisement 1 There is a class of persons who are restrained by only the rod of chastisement from devouring one another. If the rod of chastisement did not protect people, they would have sunk in the darkness of hell. The rod of chastisement (danda) has been so named by the wise because it restrains the ungovernable and punishes the wicked. The chastisement of Brahmanas should be by word of mouth ; of Kshatri- yas, by giving them only that much of food as would suffice for the support of life ; of Vaisyas, by the imposition of fines and forfeitures of property, while for Sudras there is no punishment.* For keeping men awake (to their duties ) and for the protection of property, ordinances, king, have been established in the world, under the name of chastisement (or punitive legislation). Thither where Chastisement, of dark complexion and red eyes, stands in an attitude of readiness ( to grapple with every offender ) and the king is of righteous vision, the subjects never forget themselves, The Brahmacharin and the house-holder, the recluse in the forest and the religious mendicant, all these walk in their respective ways through fear of chastisement alone. He that is without any fear, king, never performs a sacrifice, He that is without fear never giveth away. The man that is without any fear never desires to adhere to any engagement or compact. Without piercing the vitals of others, without achieving the most difficult feats, and without slaying creatures like a fisherman (slaying fish), no person can obtain great prosperity.! Without slaughter, no man has been able to achieve fame in this world or acquire wealth or subjecs. Indra himself, by the slaughter of Vritra, became the great Indra. Those amongst the godg that are given to slaughtering others are adored much more by men. Rudra, Skanda, Sakra, Agni, Varuna, are all slaughtererers. Kala and Mrityu and Vayu and Kuvera and Surya, the Vasus, the Maruts, the Saddhyas, and the Yiswedevas, O Bharata, are all slaughters. Humbled by their prowess, all people bend to those gods, but not to Brahman or Dhatri or Pushan at any time. Only a few men that are noble of disposition * Censure is the only punishment for a Brabmana offender. A Kshatriya may be punished by taking away all his property, but care should be taken to give him food sufficient for maintaining life. A Vaisya should be punished by forfeiture of possessions. There is practically no punishment for a Sudra, for being unable to possess wealth, dispossession of wealth cannot be a punishment in his case ; again, service being his duty, the imposition of labour on him cannot be a punishment.

Foolish (Kshatriyas) alone, restraining wrath and joy, take refuge in the woods. The very ascetics cannot support their lives without killing creatures. In water, on earth, and fruits, there are innumerable creatures. It is not true that one does not slaughter them. What higher duty is there than supporting one's life ?* There are many creatures that are so minute that their existence can only be inferred. With the falling of the eyelids alone, they are destroyed. There are men who subduing wrath and pride betake themselves to ascetic courses of life and leaving villages and towns repair to the woods. Arrived there, those men may be seen to be so stupefied as to adopt the domestic mode of life once more. Others may be seen, who (in the observance of domesticity) tilling the soil, uprooting herbs, cutting off trees and killing birds and animals, perform sacrifices and at last attain to heaven. O son of Kunti, I have no doubt in this that the acts of all creatures become crowned with success only when the policy of chastisement is properly applied. If chastisement were abolished from the world, creatures would soon be destroyed. Like fishes in the water, stronger animals prey on the weaker. This truth was for- merly spoken by Brahman himself, viz., that chastisement, properly applied upholds creatures. Behold, the very fires, when extinguished, blaze up again, in fright, when blown ! This is due to the fear of force or chastise- ment. If there were no chastisement in the world distinguishing the good from the bad, then the whole world would have been enveloped in utter darkness and all things would have been confounded. Even they that are breakers of rules, that are atheists and scoffers of the Vedas, afflicted by chastisement, soon become disposed to observe rules and restrictions t Every one in this world is kept straight by chastisement. A person naturally pure and righteous is scarce. Yielding to the fear of chastise- ment, man becomes disposed to observe rules and restraints. Chastisement was ordained by the Creator himself for protecting Religion and Profit, for the happiness of all the four orders, and for making them righteous and modest. If chastisement could not inspire fear, then ravens and beasts of prey would have eaten up all other animals and men and the clarified butter * The sense is that if in supporting life one kills these creatures, he does not in any way commit sin.

If chastisement did not uphold and protect, people could never duly perform annual sacrifices with large presents. If chastisement did not uphold and protect, no one, to whatever mode of life he might belong, would observe the duties of that mode as declared (in the scriptures), and no one would have succeeded in acquiring knowledge.! Nei- ther camels, nor oxen, nor horses, nor mules, nor asses, would, even if yoked thereto, drag cars and carriages, if chastisement did not uphold and pro- tect. Upon chastisement depend all creatures. The learned, therefore, say that chastisement is the root of every thing. Upon chastisement rests the heaven that men desire, and upon it rests this world also. Thither where foe-destroying chastisement is well applied, no sin, no deception, acd no wickedness, is to be seen. If the rod of chastisement be not uplifted, the dog will lick the sacrificial butter. The crow also would take away the first (sacrificial) offering, if that rod were not kept uplifted.

There are two things here, viz., abstention from injury and injury prompted by righteous motives. Of these two, that is superior by which righteous- ness may be acquired.!

The acquisition and preservation of kingdom is attended with both righteousness and un- righteousness. The desire for them exists in thee.

In the Vedas there are precepts of both kinds, viz., those that inculcate action and those that inculcate renouncement of action. The scriptures are confounding and their conclusions are based upon reasons. The truth, however, that is in the Mantras, is duly known to me. Thou art conversant only with weapons and observant of the practices of heroes. Thou art unable to understand truly the sense of the scriptures 1 If thou wert really acquainted with duty, then thou couldst have understood that words such as these ought not to have been addressed to me by even one possessed of the clearest insight into the meaning of the scriptures and acquainted with the truths of religion. That, however, which thou hast said unto me, induced by fraternal affection, has been fit and proper, O son of Kunti ! I am, for that, gratified with thee, Arjuna ! There is no one equal to thee in the three worlds in all duties connected with battle and in skill in respect of diverse kinds of acts. Thou mayst, therefore, speak of the subtilties connected with those subjects, subtilties, that is, that are impenetrable by others. It behoveth thee not, however, O Dhananjaya, to doubt my intelligence ! Thou art conversant with the science of battle, but thou hast never waited upon the aged. Thou knowest not the conclusions arrived at by those that have studied the subject in brief and detail ! Even this is the conclusion of intelligent men whose understanding are bent on achieving salvation, viz., that amongst ascetic penances, renunciation, and knowledge of Brahma, the second is superior to the first, and the third is superior to the second, This, however, that thou thinkest, viz., that there is nothing superior to wealth, is an error. I will convince thee of it, so that wealth may not again appear to thee in that light. All men that are righteous are seen to bejdevo- ted to ascetic penances and the study of the Vedas. The Rishis also, that have many eternal regions for them, have the merit of penances. Others possessed of tranquillity of soul, having no enemies, and dwelling in the woods, have, through penances and study of the Vedas, proceeded to heaven. Pious men, by restraining desire for worldly possessions, and easting off that darkness which is born of folly, proceed northward ( i.e., by luminous paths) to the regions reserved for praotisers of Renunciation. The path that Hei to the south and that leads to regions of light (.., lunar"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"SANTI PABVA ft regions), are reserved for men devoted to action, These are attained by persons subject to birth and death. That end, however, which persons desirous of salvation have before their eyes, is indescribable. Yoga is the best means for attaining to it. It is not easy to explain it (to thee) 1 Those that are learned live, reflecting on the scriptures from desire of finding what is unreal. They are, however, often led away to this and to that in the belief that the object of their search exists in this and that. Having mustered, however, the Vedas, the Aranyakas, and the other scriptures, they miss the real, like men failing to find solid timber in an uprooted banana plant. Some there are who, disbelieving in its unity, regard the Soul, that dwells in this physical frame consisting of the five elements, to be possessed of the attributes of desire and aversion (and others).* Incap- able of being seen by the eye, exceedingly subtile, and inexpressible by words, it revolves in a round (of re-births) among the creatures of the Earth, keeping before it that which is the root of action.! Having made the Soul advance towards itself which is the spring of every kind of blessedness, having restrained all desires of the mind, and having cast off all kinds of action, one may become perfectly independent and happy. When there is such a path that is trod by the righteous and that is attainable by Know- ledge, why, Arjuna, dost thou applaud wealth which is full of every kind of calamity ? Men of olden times that were conversant with the scriptures, Bharata, men that were always engaged in gifts and sacrifice and action, were of this opinion, Bharata ! There are some fools who, accomplished in the science of argumentation, deny the existence of the Soul, in conse- quence of the strength of their convictions of a previous life. It is very difficult to make them accept this truth about final emancipation. Those wicked men, though possessed of great learning, travel all over the Earth, making speeches in assemblies, and deprecating the true doctrine about emancipation. Partha, who else will succeed in understanding that which we do not understand ? Indeed, (as those men cannot understand * Eefers to the well-known definition of the soul or mind in the Naya philosophy, which says that it is distinguished by the attributes of desire, aversion, and will, pleasure and pain, and the cognitive faculties. t The soul, though really bereft of attributes, nevertheless revolves in a round among creatures, i.e., entres other bodies on the dissolution of those previously occupied. The reason of this round or continual journey is Avidya or illusion, viz., that absence of true knowledge inconsequence of which men engage themselves in action. \"When freed from this Avidya, action ceases, and the soul becomes displayed in its true nature, which consists in the absence of all attributes.!. t Hetumantah Panditah means learned in the science of reosaning ; Dridhapurve is explained by Nilkantha as persons endued with strong convictions of a past life ; Suduravartah means difficult of being made to understand.!."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"38 MAHABHABATA the ferue meaning of the scriptures), similarly they cannot succeed in know- ing those wise and pious persons that are truly great and that have deep acquaintance with the scriptures. son of Kunti, men acquainted with truth obtain Brahma by asceticism and intelligence, and great happiness by Renunciation. SECTION XX Vaisampayana said, \"After Yudhishthira had stopped, the great ascetic Devasthana, possessed of eloquence, said these words, fraught with reason, unto the king. \"Devasthana said, 'Phalguna has told thee that there is nothing superior to wealth. I shall discourse to thee on that subject. Listen to me with undivided attention ! Ajatasatru, thou hast righteously won the Earth. Having won her, it behoves thee not, king, to abandon her without cause ! Four modes of life are indicated in theVedas. Do thou, king, duly pass through them, one after another ! At present thou should- st, therefore, perform great sacrifices with profuse presects ! Amongst the very Rishis, some are engaged in the sacrifice represented by Vedic study, and some in that represented by knowledge. Therefore, O Bharata. thou must know that the very ascetics also are addicted to action ! The VaiJchanasas, however, are said to preach that he who does not seek for wealth is superior to him that seeks for it.* I think that he who would follow that precept would incur many faults. Men collect together diverse things (for the performance of sacrifices) simply because of the (Vedic) ordi- nance. He who, tainted by his own understanding, giveth away wealth to an undeserving person without giving it to the deserving, doth not know that he incurs the sin of killing a fretus.f The exercise of the duty of charity after discriminating the deserving from the undeserving is not easy. The supreme Ordainer created wealth for Sacrifice, and He created man also for taking care of that wealth and for performing Sacrifice. For this reason the whole of one's wealth should be applied to sacrifice. Pleasure would follow from it as a natural consequence. Possessed of abundant energy, Indra, by the performance of diverse sacrifices with profuse gifts of valu- ables, surpassed all the gods. Having got their ohiefship by that means, he shineth in heaven. Therefore, everything should be applied to Sacri- -i ... , c The sense is that instead of performing sacrifices after acquisition of wealth, it is better not to perform sacrifices if they cannot be performed without wealth. Nilakantha, by interpreting Dhanahetu as sacrifices which have wealth for the means of their accomplishment, would come to this meaning directly. T. t The last line of 8 and the first line of 9 are to be taken together ; atmanam is explained by Nilakantha as meaning something that is regard- ed as dear as self, i.e., wealth. Such a person incurs the sin of killing a foetus, because that sin proceeds from killing one's own eelf. Improper use of wealth is, of course, regarded as killing one's own self.

King Marutta, the son of Avikshit, by the profusion of his wealth, vanquished Sakra himself, the chief of the gods. In the great sacrifice he performed, all the vessels were of gold, and Sree herself came in person. Thou hast heard that the great king Harishchandra, having performed sacrifices, earned great merit and great happiness. Though a man, he nevertheless vanquished Sakra fey his wealth. For this reason everything should be applied to Sacrifice.\" 1 SECTION XXI \"Devasthana said, 'In this connection is cited an old history, viz., the discourse that Vrihaspati, asked by Indra, delivered unto him. Vrihas- pati said, Contentment is the highest heaven, contentment is the highest bliss. There is nothing higher than contentment. Contentment stands as the highest. When one draws away all his desires like a tortoise drawing in all his limbs, then the natural resplendence of his soul soon manifests itself. When one does not fear any creature, nor any creature is frightened atone, when one conquers one's desire and aversion, then is one said to behold one's soul. When one, indeed, in word and thought, seeks to injure nobody and cherishes no desire, one is said to attain to Brahma. Thus, son of Kunti, whatever religion is followed by creatures, they obtain corres- ponding fruits. Awaken thyself by this consideration, O Bharata !* Some praise Peacefulness, some praise Exertion ; some there are that praise Contemplation ; and some praise both Peacefulness and Exerfcion.f Some praise Sacrifice ; others, Renunciation. Some praise gifts ; others, accep- tance. Some, abandoning everything, live in silent meditation. Some praise sovereignty and the cherishing of subjects, after slaying, cutting and piercing (foes). Some are for passing their days in retirement. Observ- ing all this, the conclusion of the learned is that that religion which consists in not injuring any creature is worthy of the approbation of the righteous. Abstention from injury, truthfulness of speech, justice, com- passion, self-restraint, procreation (of offspring) upon one's own wives, amiability, modesty, patience, the practice of these is the best of all reli- gions as said by the self -create Manu himself. Therefore, son of Kunti, * The Srutis declare that he who frightens others is frightened him- self ; while he who frightens not, is not himself frightened. The fruits won by a person correspond with his practices. Yudhishthira is, therefore exhorted to take the sovereignty, for sovereignty, righteously exercised and without attachment, will crown him with bliss hereafter.

Even this is the ordinance (affecting the two orders) about the next world. Indeed, pussiant one, death in battle is laid down for Kshatriyas. The duties of Kshatriyas are exceedingly fierce and are always connected with the use of weapons, and it has been laid down, chief of the Bharatas, that they should, when the time comes, perish by weapons on the field of battle. The life of oven a Brahmana, O king, that lives in the observance of Kshatriya duties, is not censurable, for Kshatriyas also have sprung from Brahman.

Approaching his elder brother and saluting him, Likhita smilingly replied, saying,I have taken them even from this retreat.

Then that ruler of Earth caused the two hands of the high- souled Likhita to be cut off, whereupon the latter, bearing the punish- ment, went away. Returning to his brother Sankha, Likhita, in great affection, said-It behoveth thee now to pardon this wretch wight that hath been duly punished (for what he did) ! Sankha said, I am not angry with thee, nor hast thou injured me, O foremost of all per- sons conversant with duties } Thy virtue, however, had suffered a shock. I have rescued thee from that plight !

The bow was his ( sacrificial ) stake and the bow-string was the cord for tying the victims. Shafts constituted the smaller ladle and the sword the larger one, and blood was the clarified butter that he poured. The car was the altar and the wrath he felt in battle was the fire, and the four foremost of steeds yoked unto his vehicle were the four Horn's.

If the Time for it does not come, women do not conceive. It is with Time that winter, and summer, and the rainy season come. If the Time for it does not come, no one is born and no one dies. If the Time does not come, the infant does not acquire power of speech. If the Time does not come, one does not acquire youth. It is with Time that the seed sown puts forth its sprouts. If the Time does not come, the Sun does not appear above the horizon, nor, when the Time for it does not come, does he repair to the Asta hills. If the Time for it does not come, the Moon does not wax not wane, nor the ocean, with its high billows, rise and ebb. In this connection is instanced the old story recited, O Yudhishthira, by king Senajita in grief. The irresistible course of Time affects all mortals. All earthly things, ripened by Time, suffer des- truction. Some, O king, slay some men. The slayers, again, are slain by others. This is the language of the world. Really, however, no one slays and no one is slain. Some one thinks men slay ( their fellow-men ). Another thinks men do not slay. The truth is that the birth and destruction of all creatures have been ordained to happen in conse- quence of their very nature. Upon the loss of one's wealth or the death of one's wife or son or sire, one cries out, saying, Alas, what grief I and dwelling upon that sorrow always enhances it. Why do you, like a foolish person, indulge in grief ? Why do you grieve for them that are subject to grief ? ! Behold, grief is increased by indulgence as fear is by yielding to ! This body even is not mine ! Nothing is this Earth is mine ! Or, the things of this Earth belong as much to others as to me ! The wise, seeing this, do not suffer themselves to be deluded. There are thousands of causes for sorrow, and hundreds of causes for joy. These every day affect the ignorant only, but not him that is wise. 1 And that have, by their death, escaped from all grief. T."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"48 MAHABEARATA These, in course of Time, become objects of affection or aversion, and appearing as bliss or woe revolve (as if in a wheel ) for affecting living creatures. There is only sorrow in this world but no happiness. It is for this that sorrow only is felt. Indeed, sorrow springs from that affliction called desire, and happiness springs from the affliction called sorrow. Sorrow comes after happiness, and happiness after sorrow. One does not always suffer sorrow or always enjoy happiness. Happi- ness always ends in sorrow, and sometimes proceeds from sorrow itself. He, therefore, that desires eternal happiness must abandon both. When sorrow must arise upon the expiration of happiness, and happiness upon the expiration of sorrow, one should, for that, cast off, like a (snake-bit) limb of one's body, that from which one experiences sorrow or that heart-burning which is nurtured by sorrow or that which is the root of his anxiety. 1 Be it happiness or sorrow, be it agreeable or dis- agreeable, whatever comes should be borne with an unaffected heart. O amiable one, if thou abstainest, in even a slight measure, from doing what is agreeable to your wives and children, thou shalt then know who is whose and why so and for what. They that are highly stupid and they that are masters of their souls enjoy happiness here. They, however, that occupy an intermediate place suffer misery. This O Yudhishthirai is what Senajit of great wisdom said, that person who was conversant with what is good or bad in this world, with duties, and with happiness and misery. He who is grieved at other people's griefs can never be happy. There is no end of grief, and grief arises from happiness itself. Happiness and misery, prosperity and adversity, gain and loss, death and life, in their turn, wait upon all creatures. For this reason the wise man of tranquil soul should neither be elated with joy nor be depressed with sorrow. To be engaged in battle has been said to be the Sacrifice for a king ; a due observance of the science of chastisement is his Yoga ; and the gift of wealth in sacrifices in the form of DaksMna is his Renunciation. All these should be regarded as acts that sanctify him. By governing the kingdom with intelligence and policy, casting off pride, performing sacrifices, and looking at every- thing and all persons with kindness and impartiality, a high-souled king, after death, sports in the region of the gods. By winning battles, protecting his kingdom, drinking the Soma juice, advancing his subjects, wielding judiciously the rod of chastisement, and casting off his body at last in fight, a king enjoys happiness in heaven. Having studied all the Vedas and the other scriptures duly, having protected the king- dom properly, and having caused all the four orders to adhere to their respective duties, a king becomes sanctified and finally sports in heaven. He is the best of kings whose conduct, even after his death, is applaud- ed by the inhabitants of city and the country and by his counselors and friends.\" 1 The Bombay text makes this verse consist of 3 lines.

This, however, is not true. Many persons are seen that have been crowned with success through Sacrifice in the shape of Vedic study. Many sages are seen :by devotion to penances to have acquired eternal regions ( of bliss ). They, O Dhananjaya, who always observe the practices of the Rishis by betaking themselves to Brahma- charyya and who become acquainted with all duties, are regarded by the gods as Bra/unarms. O Dhananjaya, thou shouldst always regard those Rishis thatare devoted to the study of the Vedas and those that are devot- ed to the pursuit of true knowledge as persons that are truly virtuous ! O son of Pandu, all our acts depend upon those that are devoted to the acquisition of true knowledge. 1 We know this to be the opinion of the Vaikhanasas, O puissant one ! The Ajas, the Prishnis, the StJcatas, O Bharata, the Arunas, and the Ketavas, have all gone to heaven through the merit of Vedic study. By performing those acts, O Dhananjaya, that are indicated in the Vedas, viz., battle, study of the Vedas, Sacrifices, the restraint of passion that is so difficult, one goes to heaven by the southern path of the Sun (Dakshinayana). I have, before this, told thec that those very regions belong to persons that are observant of (Vedic) acts. Thou shalt see, however, that the northern path ( Uttarayana ) is travelled by those that are devoted to Yoga penances. Those eternal and bright regions to which that path leads belong to men of Yoga. Of these two, the northern path is much applauded by those conversant with the Puranas. Thou shouldst knowthat one acquires heaven through con- tentment. From contentment springs great happiness. There is nothing higher than contentment. Unto the Yogin who has controlled wrath and joy, contentment is his high praise and success. In this connection is cited the discourse by Yayati of old. Listening to that discourse one may succeed in withdrawing all his desires like a tortoise drawing in all his limbs. When one cherishes no fear of anything, when one is not feared by anything, when one cherishes no desire, when one bears no hate, then is one said to have attained to the state of Brahma. When one does not bear sinfully towards any creature, in act, thought, or wordi one is then said to have attained to Brahma. When one has con- trolled his pride and folly, and withdrawn himself from all attachments, it is then that that pious man of irradiated soul becomes fit for attaining to that salvation which consists in the annihilation of separate existence. 1 True knowledge is knowledge of Brahma. What is said here is that our conduct (acts) should be framed according to the opinion of persons possessed of such knowledge,-*!,"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"50 MAHABHABATA Listen now to me with concentrated attention, O son of Pritha, as I say it unto thee ! Some desire virtue ; some, good conduct ; and some wealth. One may desire wealth ( as a means for the acquisition of virtue ). The abandonment, however, of such desire would be better for him. 1 There are many faults attached to wealth and consequently to those religious acts that are performed with wealth. We have seen it with our own eyes. It behoveth thee also to see this 1 He that desires wealth finds it very difficult to abandon that which should by every means be abandoned. Good deeds are very rare in those that amass riches. It is said that wealth can never be acquired without injuring others, and that, when earned, it brings numerous troubles. A person of narrow heart, setting at naught the fear of repentance, commits acts of aggression towards others, tempted by even a little wealth, uncons- cious all the while of the sin of Brahmanicide that he incurs by his acts. Obtaining wealth which is so difficult of acquisition, one burns with grief if one has to give a portion of it to one's servants, with grief, that is, which is equal to what one would feel if one is actually robbed by depredators. If on the other hand, one does not part with one's wealth, obloquy becomes one's share* One, .however, that has no wealth, never becomes the subject of censure. Withdrawn from all attachments, such a person can become happy in all respects by support- ing life upon what little he may obtain as alms. No one, however, can be happy by the acquisition of wealth. In this connection certain verses relating to Sacrifices are recited by persons conversant with ancient scriptures. Wealth was created by the Creator for the sake of Sacrifices, and man was created by him for protecting that wealth and performing Sacrifices. For this, all wealth should be applied to Sacri- fices. It is not proper that it should be spent for the gratification of desire of enjoyment. The Creator then confers wealth upon mortals for the sake of Sacrifices. Know this, O son of Kunti, thou that art the foremost of all wealthy persons ! It is for this that the wise think that wealth, without doubt, is nobody's on Earth. One should perform Sacrifices with it and give it away with a trustful heart. One should spend (in gift) what one has acquired, and not waste or spend it in gratifying one's desire of enjoyment. What use is there in amassing wealth when such proper objects exist in which to spend it ? Those persons of little understanding that give away (wealth) unto men that have swerved from the duties of their order, have to subsist hereafter for a hundred years on ordure and dirt. That men give unto the un- deserving and refrain from giving unto the deserving is due to inabi- lity to discriminate between the deserving and the undeserving. For this reason the practice of even the virtue of charity is difficult. These are the two faults connected with wealth even when acquired, viz., gift to an undeserving person and abstaining to give unto him that is deserving.' \" 1 What the poet says here is this : it is better not to wish for or covet wealth as a means for the performance of sacrifices than to covet 44 for per- forming sacrifices. A poor man will act better by not performing sacrifices at all than by performing them with wealth acquired by the usual means.-^T."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"SECTION XXVII \"Yudhishthira said, 'In consequence of the fall of Abhimanyu of tender years, of the sons of Draupadi, of Dhrishtadyumna, of Virata, of king Drupada, of Vasusena conversant with every duty, of the royal Dhrishtaketu, and of diverse other kings hailing from diverse regions, in battle, grief does not forsake my wretched self that am a slater of kinsmen !

Without doubt, all creatures that are born display at first a union ( of diverse materials and forces). Dissolution, however, overtakes them at the end. Like bubbles in water they rise and disappear. All things massed together are sure to crumble away, and all things that rise must fall down. Union ends in dissolution, and life ends in death, Idleness, though temporarily agreeable, ends in misery, and labour with skill, though temporarily painful, ends in happiness. Affluence, Prosperity, Modesty, Contentment, and Fame dwell in labour and skill but not in idleness. 2 Friends are not compe- tent to bestow happiness, nor foes competent to inflict misery. Similarly wisdom does not bring wealth nor does wealth bring happiness. Since, O son of Kunti. thou hast been created by the Maker to engage thyself in Work. Success springs from Work, Thou art not competent, O king, to avoid Work.' \" 1 Th6 meaning is that I must undergo such a severe penanoe in order that in my next life I may not be born as an inferior animal but may succeed in taking birth among men.

''* 'Janaka said, How should a man desirous of his own good be- have upon occasions of the accession and the destruction of both kinsmen and wealth ? 1 'Asma said, Immediately after the formation of a man's body, joys and griefs attach themselves to it.

Addicted to all earthly enjoyments, he begins to waste the wealth hoarded by his ancestors. Impoverished in course of time, he regards the appropria- tion of what belongs to others as even. laudable. Like a hunter piercing a deer with his shafts, the king then punishes that wicked wight, that robber of other people's possessions, that transgressor of law and rule. Without attaining to a hundred years (the usual period of human life), such men scarcely live beyond twenty or thirty years. Carefully observ- ing the behaviour of all creatures, a king should, by the exercise of his intelligence, apply remedies for alleviating the great sorrows of his subjects. The causes of all mental sorrow are two, viz., delusion of the mind and the accession of distress. No third cause exists. All these diverse kinds of woe as also those arising from attachment to earthly enjoyments, that overtake man, are even such. 1 Decrepitude and Death, like a pair of wolves, devour all creatures, stronger weak, short or tall. No man can escape decrepitude and death, not even the sub- jugator of the whole Earth girt by the sea.

Similarly, the birth of creatures and their death, and the accessions of gain and loss, are all pre-ordained. Even as scent, colour, taste, and touch spring naturally, happiness and misery arise from what has been pre-ordained. Seats and beds and vehicles, prosperity and drink and food, ever approach living creatures according to Time's course. 1 Physi- cians even get ill. The strong become weak. They that are in the enjoyment of prosperity lose all and become indigent. The course of Time is very wonderful. High-birth, health, beauty, prosperity, and objects of enjoyment, are all won through Destiny. The indigent, al- though they may not desire it, have many children. The affluent again are seen to be childless. Wonderful is the course of Destiny. The evils caused by disease, fire, water, weapons, hunger, poison, fever, and death, and falls from high places, overtake a man according to the Destiny under which he is born. It is seen in this world that somebody, without sinning, suffers diverse ills, while another, having sinned, is not borne down by the weight of calamity. It is seen that somebody in the enjoyment of wealth perishes in youth ; while some one that is poor drags on his existence, borne down by decrepitude, for a hundred years. One born in an ignoble race may have a very long life, while one sprung from a noble line perishes soon like an insect. In this world, it is very common that persons in affluent circumstances have no appe- tite, while they that are indigent can digest chips of wood. Impelled by destiny, whatever sins the man of wicked soul, discontented with his condition, commits, saying I am the doer* he regards to be all for his good. Hunting, dice, women, wine, brawls, these are censured by the wise. Many persons, however, possessed of even extensive know- ledge of the scriptures are seen to be addicted to them. Objects, whether coveted or otherwise, come upon creatures in consequence of Time's course. No other cause can be traced. Air, space, fire, moon, sun, day, night, the luminous bodies ( in the firmament ), rivers, and mountains, who makes them and who supports them? Cold, and heat, and rain, come one after another in consequence of Time's course. It is even so, O bull among men, with the happiness and the misery of mankind. Neither medicines, nor incantations, can rescue the man assailed by decrepitude or overtaken by death. As two logs of wood floating on the great ocean, come together and are again ( when the time comes ) separated, even so creatures come together and are again ( when the time comes ) separated. Time acts equally towards those men that ( are in affluent circumstances and that ) enjoy the pleasures of song and dance in the company of women and those helpless men that live upon the food that others supply.

No one can become any one's own, nor can any one become anybody else's own. Our union here with wives and kinsfolk and well-wishers is like that of travellers at a road-side inn. Where am 1 ? Where shall 1 go ? Who am I ? Hou; come I here IWhat for and whom I grieve ? Reflecting on these questions one obtains tranquillity. Life and its environments are constantly revolving like a wheel, and the companionship of those that are dear is transitory. The union with brother, mother, father, and friend is like that of travellers in an inn. Men of knowledge behold, as if with corporeal eyes, the next world that is unseen. Without disregard- ing the scriptures, one desirous of knowledge should have faith. One possessed of knowledge should perform the rites laid down in respect of the Pitris and the gods, practise all religious duties, perform sacrifices, judiciously pursue virtue, profit, and pleasure. Alas, no one under- stands that the world is sinking on the ocean of Time that is so very deep and that is infested by those huge crocodiles called decrepitude and death ! Many physicians may be seen afflicted with all the mem- bers of their families, although they have carefully studied the science of Medicine. 1 Taking bitters and diverse kinds of oily drugs, these succeed not in transcending death, like ocean in transcending its conti- nents. Men well-versed in Chemistry, notwithstanding chemical compounds applied judiciously, are seen to be broken down by decrepi' tude like trees broken down by elephants. Similarly, persons possessed of ascetic merit, devoted to study of the Vedas, practising charity, and frequently performing sacrifices, succeed not in escaping decrepitude and death. As regards all creatures that have taken birth, neither years, nor months, nor fortnights, nor days, nor nights, that have once passed, do ever return. Man, whose existence is so transitory, is forced, in course of Time, whether he will or not, to come upon this inevitable and broad path that has to be trodden by every creature.* Whether the body springs from the creature or the creature springs from the body, one's union, however, with wives and other friends is like that of travellers in an inn. 8 Oue can not obtain a lasting com- panionship with any one. One cannot obtain such companionship with one's own body. How then can be it had with any one else ? Where, O king, is thy sire today and where thy grandsire ?

We hear, O Srinjaya, that there was a king of the name of Marutta who was the son of Avikshit. Even he fell a prey to death. The gods with Indra and Varuna and Vrihaspati at their head came to the sacri- fice, called Viswasrij, performed by that high-souled monarch. 1 Challenging Sakra, the chief of the gods, that king vanquished him in battle. The learned Vrihaspati, from desire of doing good unto Indra, had refused to officiate at Marutta' s sacrifice. Thereupon Samvarta, the younger brother of Vrihaspati, acceded to the king's request. During the rule of that king, O best of monarchs, the Earth yielded crops without being tilled and was adorned with diverse kinds of ornaments. In the sacrifice of that king, the Viswedevas sat as courtiers, the Maruts acted as distributors (of food and presents) and the high-souled Saddhyas were also present. In that sacrifice of Marutta, the Maruts drank Soma. The sacrificial presents the king made surpassed (in value) those ever made by the gods, the Gandharvas, and men.

Collecting that vast wealth of gold that covered the Earth, Suhotra performed a sacrifice at Kurujangala and gave it away unto the Brahmanas.

A hundred thousand maidens also, adorned with golden orna- ments, he gave away as presents in a sacrifice he performed. A hundred thousand elephants also of the best breed, he gave away as presents in another sacrifice performed by him. A hundred millions also of bulls, adorned with golden chains, with thousands of kine accompanying them, he gave away as sacrificial presents.

In the sacrifices, O monarch, numbering by hundreds, that this king performed of old, the presents he made far surpassed those ever made by the gods, the Qandharvas, and men. No other man was born, or will ever be born, that gave or will give away so much wealth as was given away by the king of the Angas in the seven sacrifices he performed, each of which was characterised by the conse- cration of the Soma. 3 When, O Srinjaya, this Vrihadratha even, who was thy superior in the four attributes and who was purer than thy son, fell a prey to death, do not grieve for thy son that is dead. We hear also, O Srinjaya, that Sivi the son of Usinara, fell a prey to death. That king swayed the whole Earth as one sways the leathern shield in his hand.

The Creator himself thought that no one amongst the kings of the past or the future had or would have the ability to bear the burthen, O Srin- jaya, that Usinara's son Sivi, that foremost of kings, that hero who was possessed of prowess equal to that of Indra himself, bore. Do not, therefore, grieve for thy son who never performed any sacrifice nor made any gift. Indeed, O Srinjaya, when Sivi, who was far superior to thee in the four attributes and who was purer than thy son, fell a ptey to death, do not grieve for thy son that is dead ! We hear, O Srinjaya, that the high-souled Bharata also, the son of Dushmanta and Sakuntala, who had a vast and well-filled treasury, fell a prey to death. Devoting three hundred horses unto the gods on the banks of the Yamuna, twen- ty on the banks of the Saraswati, and fourteen on the banks of Ganga, that king of great energy, in days of old, performed (in this order ) a thousand Horse-sacrifices and a hundred Rajasuyas. No one amongst the kings of the Earth can imitate the great deeds of Bharata, even as no man cm, by the might of his arms, soar into the welkin. Erecting numerous sacrificial altars, he gave away innumerable horses and untold wealth unto the sage Kanwa. 2 When even he, O Srinjaya, who was far superior to thee in the four attributes and who was purer than thy son, fell a prey to death, do not grieve for thy son that is dead ! We hear, O Srinjaya, that Rama also, the son of Dasaratha, fell a prey to death. He always cherished his subjects as if they were the sons of his own loins. In his dominions there were no widows and none that was helpless. Indeed, Rama in governing his kingdom always acted like his father Dasaratha. The clouds, yielding showers seasonably, caused the crops to grow abundantly. During the period of his rule, food was always abundant in his kingdom. No death occurred by drowning or by fire. As long as Rama governed it, there was no fear in his king- dom of any disease. Every man lived for a thousand years, and every man was blessed with a thousand children. During the period of Rama's sway, all men were whole and all men attained the fruition of their wishes. The very women did not quarrel with one another, what need then be said of the men ?, During his rule his subjects were always devoted to virtue. Contented, crowned with fruition in respect of all the objects of their desire, fearless, free, and wedded to the vow of truth, were all tha people when Rama governed the kingdom. The trees always bore flowers and fruits and were subject to no accidents. 1 The expression used is \"he caused one umbrella only to be set up.\" The custom is well-known that none but kings could cause umbrellas to be held over their heads. -T. 2 Kanwa had brought up in his retreat Bharata's mother Sakuntala who had been deserted, immediately after her birth, by her mother, Menaka.

Having dwelt, in the observance of severe penances, for four and ten years in the woods, Rama performed ten Horse-sacrifices of great splendour 1 and to them the freest access was given to all. Possessed of youth, of a dark com- plexion, with red eyes, he looked like the leader of an elephantine herd. With arms stretching down to his knees and of handsome face, his shoulders were like those of a lion and the might of his arms great. Ascending upon the throne of Ayodyha, he ruled for ten thousand and ten hundred years. When he, O Srinjaya, who transcended thee in the four principal attributes and who was purer than thy son, fell a prey to death, do not grieve for thy son that is dead ! We hear, O Srinjaya, that king Bhagiratha also died. In one of the sacrifices of that king, intoxicated with the Soma he had drunk, Indra, the adorable chastiser of Paka and the chief of the gods, vanquished, by putting forth the might of his arms, many thousands of Asuras. King Bhagiratha, in one of the sacrifices he performed, gave away a million of maidens adorned with ornaments of gold. Each of those maidens sat upon a car and unto each car were attached.four steeds. With each car were a hundred elephants, all of the foremost breed and decked with chains of gold. Behind each elephant were a thousand steeds, and behind each steed a thousand kine, and behind each cow a thousand goats and sheep. (The river-Goddess) Ganga, named (from before) Bhagirathi, sat upon the lap of this king dwelling near ( her stream ), and from this incident she came to be called Urvasi. 2 The triple-coursed Ganga had agreed to be the daughter of Bhagiratha 'of Ikshaku's race, that monarch ever engag- ed in the performance of sacrifices with presents in profusion unto the Brahmanas. 3 When he, O Srinjaya, who transcended thee in respect of the four principal attributes and who was purer than thy son, fell a prey to death, do not grieve for thy son. We hear, O Srinjaya, that the high-souled Dwilipa also fell a prey to death. The Brahmanas love to recite his innumerable deeds. In one of his great sacrifices that king, with heart fully assenting, gave away the entire Earth, abounding with wealth, unto the Brahmanas. In each sacrifice performed by him, the chief priest received as sacrificial fee a thousand elephants made of gold. In one of his sacrifices, the stake ( set up for slaughtering the : 1 Jaruthyan is explained by Nilakantha as Stutyan. It may also mean Triguna-dak&hinan.

Discharg- ing the duties assigned to them, the gods having Sakra for their chief, used to seek the protection of that king. Upon that golden stake possessed of great effulgence and decked with a ring, six thousand Gods and Qandharvas danced in joy, and Viswavasu himself, in their midst played on his Vina the seven notes according to the rules that regulate their combinations. Such was the character of Viswavasu's music that every creature (wherever he might be) thought that the great Qan- dharva was playing to him alone. No other monarch could imitate this achievement of king Dwilipa. The elephants of that king, intoxicated and adorned with housings of gold, used to lie down on the roads. 1 Those men proceeded to heaven that succeeded in obtaining a sight even of the high-souled king Dwilipa who was ever truthful in speech and whose bow could bear a hundred foes equal in energy to a hundred Anantas. 2 These three sounds never ceased in Dwilipa's abode, viz., the voice of Vedic recitations, the twang of bows, and cries of Let it be given. When he, O Srinjaya, who transcended thee in the four princi- pal attributes and who was purer than thy son, fell a prey to death, do not grieve for thy son that is dead. Yuvanaswa's son Mandhatri also, O Sanjaya, we have heard, fell a prey to death. The deities named Maruts extracted that child from his sire's stomach through one of its sides. Sprung from a quantity of clarified butter that had been sancti- fied by mantra* (and that had by mistake been quaffed by his sire instead of his sire's spouse), Mandhatri was born in the stomach of the high- souled Yuvanaswa. Possessed of great prosperity, king Mandhatri conquered the three worlds. Beholding that child of celestial beauty lying on the lap of his sire, the Gods asked one another, From whom shall this child obtain suck? Then Indra approached him, saying, He shall obtain suck even from me ! From this circumstance, the chief of the deities came to call the child by the name of Mandhatri.* From the nourishment of that high-souled child of Yuvanaswa, the finger of Indra, placed in his mouth, began to yield a jet of milk. Sucking Indra's finger, he grew up (into a stout youth) in a hundred days. In twelve days he looked like one of twelve years. The whole Earth in one day came under the sway of that high-souled and virtuous and brave king who resembled Indra himself for prowess in battle. He vanquished king Angara, Maruta, Asita, Gaya, and Vrihad- ratha the king of the Angas.* When Yuvanaswa's son fought in battle 1 The sense, I think, is that such was the profusion of Dwilipa's wealth that no care was taken for keeping gold-decked elephants within guarded enclosures.

We hear, O Sanjaya, that Yayati the son of Nahusha also fell a prey to death. Having subjugated the whole world with its seas, he journeyed through it, decking it with successive sacrificial altars the intervals between which were measured by throws of a heavy piece of wood. Indeed, he reached the very shores of the sea as he proceeded performing great sacrifices (on those altars along his way). 2 Having performed a thousand sacrifices and a hundred Vajapeyas, he gratified the foremost of Brahmanas with three mountains of gold.

We hear, O Srinjaya, that Amvarisha also, the son of Nabhaga, fell a prey to death. That protector (of the world) and foremost of kings was regard- ed by his subjects as the embodiment of virtue. That monarch, in one of his sacrifices, assigned to the Brahmanas, for waiting upon them, a million of kings who had themselves performed thousands of sacrifices each. Men of piety praised Amvarisha the son of Nabhaga, saying that such feats had never been achieved before nor would their like be achieved in the future. 3 Those hundreds upon hundreds and thousands upon thousands of kings (that had at the command of Amva- risha waited at his sacrifices upon the Brahmanas that came there) became (through Amvarisha' s merits) crowned with the fruits of the Horse-sacrifice, and followed their lord by the Southern path (to regions of brightness and bliss). 4 When he, O Srinjaya, who far sur- 1 The first line of 9^ is evidently connected with 91.

We hear, O Srinjaya, that Sasavindu also, the son of Chitraratha, fell a prey to death. That high-souled king had a hundred thousand wives, and a million of sons. All of them used to wear golden armour and all of them were excellent bowmen. Each of those princes married a hun- dred princesses, and each princess brought a hundred elephants.

We hear, O Srinjaya, that Gaya also, the son of Amurtharayas, fell a prey to death. For a hundred years, that king subsisted upon the remains of sacrificial food. (Pleased with such devo- tion) Agni desired to give him boons. The boons solicited by Gaya were Let my wealth be inexhaustible even if I give ceaselessly ! Let my regard for virtue exist for ever! 1 Let my heart ever take pleasure in Truth, through thy grace, O eater of sacrificial libations ! It hath been heard by us that king Gaya obtained all those wishes from Agni.

Rising ( at the completion of every sacrifice ) he gave away a hundred thousand kine and hundreds of mules ( unto the Brahmanas ) during this period. That bull among men gratified the gods with Som0, the Brahmanas with wealth, the Pitris with Swadha, and the women with the accomplishment of all their wishes.

The animals, both domestic and wild, slaughtered in his sacrifice, used to come to him, viz., the high-souled Rantideva of rigid vows and great fame, of their own accord. The secretions that flowed from the skins of the animals (slaughtered in his sacrifices), produced a mighty and celebrated river which to this day is known by the name of Charmanwati. King Rantideva used to make gifts unto the Brahmanas in an extensive enclosure.

When, however, the king would say I give a thousand nishkas I the gifts were all accepted. All the vessels and plates, in Rantideva's palace, for holding food and other articles, all the jugs and pots, the pans and plates and cups, were of gold. On those night during which the guests used to live in Rantideva's abode, twenty thousand and one hundred kine had to be slaughtered.

Sixty thousand sons used to walk behind him, like myriads upon myriads of stars waiting upon the Moon in the cloudless firmament of autumn. His sway extended over the whole of this Earth. 1 He gratified the gods by performing a thousand Horse-sacrifices. He gave away unto deserving Brahmanas palatial mansions with columns of gold and (other parts) made entirely of that precious metal, containing costly beds and bevies of beautiful ladies with eyes resembling petals of the lotus, and diverse other kinds of valuable objects. At his command, the Brahmanas divided those gifts among themselves.

Both of them, possessed of great ascetic merit, wandered over the Earth, subsisting on food taken by human beings. Filled with joy and entertaining great affec- tion for each other, they entered into a compact that, whatever wish, good or bad, would be entertained by one should be disclosed to the other, but on the event of one of them acting otherwise, he should be subject to the other's curse. Agreeing to that understanding, those two great Rishis, adored of all the worlds, repaired to king Srinjaya, the son of Sitya and said unto him, We two, for thy good, shall dwell with thee for a few days. O lord of Earth, do thou attend to all our wants duly ! The king, saying So be it, set himself to attend upon them hospitably. After a while, one day, the king, filled with joy, introduced to those illustrious ascetics his daughter of the fairest complexion, say- ing, This my daughter will wait upon you both. Bright as the filaments of the lotus, she is beautiful and of faultless limbs, accomplished and of sweet manners, and is called Sukumari by name, Very well, said the Rishis in reply, upon which the king directed his daughter, tellling her, O child, attend upon these two Brahmanas as thou wouldst upon the gods or thy sire !

Indeed, the princess, chaste as she was, devoted herself entirely to her lord and did not in her heart even desire any one else among the gods, Muni's, and Yakshas for a husband. One day, as the illustrious Parvata, in course of his wanderings, entered a solitary forest, he beheld Narada there. Saluting him, Parvata said, Show thy grace unto me by permitting me, O puissant one, to go to heaven ! Seeing the cheerless Parvata kneeling before him with joined hands, Narada, himself more cheerless, said unto him, Thou hadst curst me first, saying, Be thou an ape I After thou hadst said so unto me, I cursed thee from anger, saying, From this day thou shalt not dwell in heaven I It was not well of thee, since thou art like a son unto me !

The child grew up like a large lotus in a lake, and became Suvarnashthivin in reality as in name. This extraordinary fact, O best of the Kurus, soon became widely known over the world. The Chief of the gods also came to know it as the result of Parvata's boon. Fearing humiliation (at the hands of the child when he would grow up), the slayer of Vala and Vritra began to watch for the laches of the prince. He commanded his celestial weapon Thun- der, standing before him in embodied shape, saying, Go, O Puissant one, and assuming the form of a tiger slay this prince ! When grown up, this child of Srinjaya may, by his achievements, humiliate me, O Thunder, as Parvata said ! Thus addressed by Sakra, the celestial weapon Thunder, that, subjugator of hostile towns, began from that day to continually watch for the laches of the prince.

While thus employed, the child met a powerful tiger that came upon him suddenly. The infant prince trembled violently as he was being crushed by the tiger and soon fell down lifeless on the Earth. At this sight the nurse uttered loud cries of grief. Having slain the prince, the tiger, through Indra's powers of delusion, vanished there and then. Hearing the voice of the crying nurse, the king, in great anxiety, ran to the spot. He beheld his son there, his blood quaffed off, and lying lifeless on the ground like the moon dropped from the firmament. Taking up on his lap the boy covered with blood, the king, with heart stricken by grief, began to lament piteously. The royal ladies then, afflicted with grief and crying, quickly ran to the spot where king Srinjaya was. In that situation the king thought of me with con- centrated attention. Knowing that the king was thinking of me I appeared before him, Stricken with grief as the king was, I recited to him all those stones, O monarch, that hero of Yadu's race has already recited to thee. I brought Srinjaya's child back to life, with Indra's permission. That which is ordained must occur. It is impossible that it should be otherwise.

If man, O Bharata, does all acts, good or bad, being urged thereto by the Supreme Being, then the fruits of those acts should attach to the Supreme Being himself. If a person cuts down, with an axe, a tree in forest, it is the person that incurs the sin and not the axe by any means. Or, if it be said that, the axe being only the material cause, th conse- quence of the act (of cutting) should attach to the animate agent (and not to the inanimate tool), then the sin may be said to belong to the person that has made the axe. This, however, can scarcely be true.

If, again, Destiny be the result of the acts of former lives, then no sin can attach to one in this life even as the sin of cutting down a tree cannot touch the maker of the axe.* If thou thinkest it is Chance only that acts in the world, then such an act of destruction could never happen nor will ever happen. 4 If it is necessary to ascertain what is good and what is evil in the world, attend to the scriptures. In those scriptures it has been laid down that kings should stand with the rod of chastisement uplifted in their hands. I think, O Bharata, that acts, good and bad, are conti- nually revolving here as a wheel, and men obtain the fruits of those acts, good or bad, that they do. One sinfnl act proceeds from another. Therefore, O tiger among kings, avoid all evil acts and do not thus set thy heart upon grief. Thou shouldst adhere, O Bharata, to the duties, even if reproachable, of thy own order. This self-destruction, O king, does not look well in thee ! Expiations, O king, have been ordained for (evil) acts. He that is alive can perform them, but he that dies fails in their performance.

It is Time that brings about the fruits, fraught with bliss or woe, of our actions. Think, mighty-armed one, of the acts of those Kshatriyas that have fallen 1 Those acts were the causes of their destruction and it is in conse- quence of them that they have perished. Think also of thy own acts consisting of observances of vows with restrained soul. And think also how thou hast been forced by the Supreme Ordainer to do such an act (as the slaughter of so many human beings) ! As a weapon made by a smith or carpenter is under the control of the person that is handling it, and moves as he moves it, similarly this universe, controlled by actions done in Time, moves as those actions move it. Seeing that the births and deaths of creatures take place without any (assignable) cause and in per- fect wantonness, grief and joy are perfectly needless. Although this entanglement of thy heart is a mere delusion, still, if it pleasest thee, king, perform expiatory rites (for washing thyself free of thy so-called sin). It is heard, O Partha, that the gods and the Asuras fought against each other. The Asuras were the elder, and the gods the younger, brothers. Covetous of prosperity, fierce was the battle fought between them. The fight lasted for two and thirty thousand years. Making the Earth one vast expanse of blood, the gods slew the Daityas and gained possession of heaven. Having obtained possession of the Earth, a (large) number of Brahmanas, conversant with the Vedas, armed themselves, stupefied with pride, with the Danavas for giving them help in the fight. They were known by the name of Salavrika and numbered eight and eighty thousand. All of them, however, were slain by the gods. Thoee wicked-souled persons who desire the extinction of virtue and who set sinfulness agoing deserve to be slain even as the furious Daityas were slain by the gods. If by slaying a single individual a family may be saved, or, if by slaying a single family the whole kingdom may be saved, such an act of slaughter will not be a transgression. Sin, king, sometimes assumes the form of virtue, and virtue sometimes assumes the form of sin. They, however, that are learned, know which is which. Therefore, console thyself, son of Pandu, for thou art well versed in the scriptures. Thou hast, O Bharata, only followed the path formerly trodden by the very gods. Men like yourselves never go to hell, bull of Pandu's race I Comfort these thy brothers and all thy friends, scorcher of foes ! He who deliberately engages himself in sinful acts, and committing sinful acts feels no shame but continues the same as before, is called (in the scrip- tures) a great sinner.

Forced by the faults of others, thou hast most unwillingly done this, and having done this thou repentest of it.

The rejection of one's own creed, the practice of other people's creed, assisting at the sacrifice or the religious rites of one that is not worthy of such assistance, eating of food that is forbidden, deserting one that craves protection, neglect in maintaining servants and dependants, selling salt and treacle (and similar other substances), killing of birds and animals, refusal, though competent, to procreate upon a soliciting woman, omission to present the daily gifts ( of handfuls of grass to kine and the like ), omission to present the dakshina, humiliating a Brahmana. these all have been pronounced by persons conversant with duty to be acts that no one should do.

I have cow declar- ed to thee, in brief as also in detail, those acts and omissions by which a man becomes liable to perform expiation. Listen now to the circums- tances under which men, by even committing these acts, do not become stained with sin. If a Brahmana well acquainted with the Vedas takes up arms and rushes against thee in battle for killing thee, thou mayst proceed against him for taking his life. By such an act the slayer does not become guilty of the slaughter of a Brahmana.* There is a mantra in the Vedas, son of Kunti, that lays this down. I declare unto thee only those prac- tices that are sanctioned by the authority of the Vedas. One who slays a Brahmana that has fallen away from his own duties and that advances, weapon in hand, with intent to slaughter, does not truly become the slayer of a Brahmana. In such a case it is the wrath of the slayer that proceeds against the wrath of the slain. A person by drinking alcoholic stimulants in ignorance or upon the advice of a virtuous physician when his life is at peril, should have the regenerating ceremonies performed once more in his case. All that I have told thee, O son of Kunti, about the eating of interdicted food, may be cleansed by such expiatory rites. Con- nection with the preceptor's wife at the preceptor's command does not stain the pupil. The sage Uddalaka caused his son Swetaketu to be begotten by a disciple. A person by committing theft for the sake of his preceptor in a season of distress is not stained with sin. One, however, that takes to thieving for procuring enjoyments for himself becomes stained. One is not stained by stealing from other than Brahmanas (in a season of distress and for the sake of one's preceptor ). Only one that steals under such circumstances without himself appropriating any portion thereof is untouched by sin.

Animals have become sacred (fit for sacrifice) through the kindness manifested towards them by the Creator himself in the ordinance laid down by him.

This is an injunction of great authority in the Sntti*. One, again, by slaying down his life in a battle undertaken for the sake of a Brahmana, becomes cleansed of the sin of having slain a Brahmana. By giving away a hundred thousand kine unto persons deserving of gifts, one becomes cleansed of the sin of having slain a Brahmana as also, indeed, of all his gins. One that gives away five and twenty thousand kine of the kapila species and while all of them have calved, becomes cleansed of all his sins. One who, at the point of death, gives away a thousand kine with calves unto poor but deserving persons, becomes freed from sin. That man, king, who gives away a hundred steeds of the Kamvoja breed unto Brahmanas of regulated behaviour, becomes freed from sin. That man, Bharata, who gives unto even one person all that he asks for, and who, having given it, does not speak of his act to any one, becomes freed from sin. If a person who has once taken alcohol drinks (as expiation) hot liquor, he sanctifies himself both here and hereafter. By falling from the summit of a mountain or entering a blazing fire, or by going on an ever- lasting journey after renouncing the world, one is freed from all sins. By performing the sacrifice laid down by Vrihaspati, a Brahmana who drinks alcoholic liquors may succeed in attaining to the region of Brahman. This has been said by Brahman himself. If a person, after having drunk alcoholic liquor, becomes humble and makes a gift of land, and abstains himself from it ever afterwards, he becomes sanctified and cleansed. The person that has violated his preceptor's bed, should lie down on a sheet of iron having heated it, and having cut off the emblem of his sex should leave the world for a life in the woods, with eyes always turned upwards.

Persons conversant with the scriptures do not take into account the sins that women may commit at heart.

Plates (made of the alloy of brass and copper) stained by a Sudra eating off it, or a vessel of the same metal that has been smelt by a cow, or stained by a Brahmana's Gandusha, may be cleansed by means of the ten purifying substances.* It has been laid down that a Brahmana should acquire and practise the full measure of virtue. For a person of the kingly order it has been laid down that he should acquire and practise a measure of virtue less by a fourth part. So, a Vaisya should acquire a measure less (than a Ksha- triya's) by a fourth and a Sudra less ( than a Vaisya's ) by a fourth. The heaviness or lightness of sins (for purposes of expiation) of each of the four orders, should be determined upon this principle. Having slain a bird or an animal, or cut down living trees, a person should publish his sin and fast for three nights. By having intercourse with one with whom inter- course is prohibited, the expiation for one is wandering in wet clothes and sleeping on a bed of ashes. These, king, are the expiations for sinful acts, according to precedent and reason and sciptures and the ordinances of Brahman himself. A Brahmana may be cleansed of all sins by reciting the Gayatri in a sacred place, all the while Jiving upon frugal fare, casting off malice, abandoning wrath and hate, unmoved by praise and blame, and abstaining from speech with all. He should during the day time be under shelter of the sky and should lie down at night even at such a place. Thrice during the day, and thrice during the night, he should also plunge with his clothes into a stream or lake for performing his ablutions.

Eefusal to appropriate what is not given, gift, study (of scriptures), penance, absten- tion from injury, truth, freedom from wrath, and worship of the gods in sacrifices, these are the characteristics of virtue. That again which is virtue may, according to time and place, be sin. Thus appropriation (of what belongs to others), untruth, and injury and killing, may, under special circumstances, become virtue.* With respect to persons capable of judging, acts are of two kinds, viz., virtuous and sinful. From the worldly and the Vedio points of view again., virtue and sin are good or bad (according to their consequences). From the Vedic point of view, virtue and sin ( i.e., everything a man may do or not do), would be classed under action and inaction. Inaction (i.e., abstention from Vedic rites and adoption of a life of contemplation) leads to emancipation (from rebirth) ; while the consequences of acion (i.e., practice of Vedic rites are repeated death and rebirth. From the worldly point of view, acts that are evil lead to evil and those that are good to consequences that are good. From the worldly point of view, therefore, virtue and sin are to be distinguished by the good and the evil character of their consequences.! Acts that are (apparently) evil, when undertaken from considerations connected with the gods, the scriptures, life itself, and the means by which life is sustain- ed, produce consequences that are good.J When an act is undertaken from the expectation, however doubtful, that it will produce mischief (to some one) in the future, or when an act is done whose consequence is visibly mischievous, expiation has been laid down. When an act is done from wrath or clouded judgment, then expiation should be performed by giving pain to the body, guided by precedent, by scriptures, and by reason. When anything, again, is done for pleasing or displeasing the mind, the sin arising therefrom may be cleansed by sanctified food and recitation of mantras. The king who lays aside (in a particular case) the rod of chastise ment, should fast for one night. The priest who (in a particular case) abstains from advising the king to inflict punishment, should fast for three * The first line of 7 is read differently in the Bombay edition.

The person who, from grief, attempts to commit suicide by means of weapons, should fast for three nights. There is no expiation for them that oast off the duties and practices of their order and class, country, and family, and that abandon their very creed. When an occasion for doubt respecting what should be done arises, that should be regarded as the injunction of the scriptures which ten persons versed in Vedic scriptures or three of those that frequently recite them made declare.* The bull, earth, little ants, worms generated in dirt, and poison, should not be eaten by Brahmanas. They should not also eat fishes that hi73 no goaleg, and four-footed aquatic animals like frogs and others, except the tortoise. Water-fowls called Bhasas, ducks, Suparnas, Chakravakas, diving ducks, cranes, crows, shags, vultures, hawks, owls, as also all four- footed animals that are carnivorous and that have sharp and long teeth, and birds, and animals having two teeth and those having four teeth, as also the milk of the sheep, the she-ass, the she-camel, thenewly-calved cow woman and deer, should not be taken by a Brahmana. Besides this, the food that has been offered to the man, that which has been cooked by a woman who has recently brought forth a child, and food cooked by an un- known person, should not be eaten. The milk also of a cow that has recently calved should not be taken. If a Brahmana takes food that has been cooked by a Kshatriya, it diminishes his energy ; if he takes the food provided by a Sudra, it dims his Brahmanic lustre ; and if he takes the food provided by a goldsmith or a woman who has neither husband nor children, it lessens the period of his life. The food provided by an usurer is equivalent to dirt, while that provided by a woman living by prostitution is equivalent to semen. The food also provided by persons that tolerate the uncbastity of their wives, and by persons that are ruled by their spouses, is forbidden. The food provided by a person selected (for receiving gifts) at a certain stage of a sacrifice, by one who does not enjoy his wealth or make any gifts, that provided by one who sells Soma, or one who is a shoe-maker, by an unchaste woman, by a washerman, by a physician, by persons serving as watchmen, by a multitude of persons, by one who is pointed at by a whole village, by one deriving his support from keep of dancing girls, by persons wedding before their elder brothers are wedded, by professional panegyrists and bards, and by those that are gamblers, the food also which is brought with the left hand or which is stale, the food which is mixed with alcohol, the food a portion of which has been already tasted, and the food that forms the remnant of a feast, should not be taken (by a Brahmana).

A householder by living thus in his own house becomes like a person of the Bhikshu order that has renounced the world. A man of such behavi- our, living with his wives in domesticity, earns great religious merit. No one should make a gift for the sake of acquiring fame, or from fear (of censure and the like) or unto a benefactor. A virtuous man would not make gifts unto persons living by singing and dancing or unto those that are professional jesters, or unto a person that is intoxicated, or unto one that is insane, or unto a thief, or unto a slanderer, or unto an idiot, or unto one that is pale of hue, or unto one that is defective of a limb, or unto a dwarf, or unto a wicked person, or unto one born in a low and wicked family, or unto one that has not been sanctified by the observance of vows. No gift should be made to a Brahmana destitute of knowledge of the Vedas. Gifts should be made unto him only that is a Srotriya.* An improper gift and an improper acceptance produce evil consequences unto both the giver and the acceptor. As a person who seeks to cross the ocean with the aid of a rock or a mass of catechu sinks along with his support, even so the giver and the acceptor (in such a case) both sink together. Asa fire that is covered with wet fuel does not blaze forth, even so the acceptor of a gift who is bereft of penances and study and piety cannot confer any benefit (upon the giver). As water in a (human skull and milk in a bag made of dog-skin become unclean in consequence of the uncleanliness of the vessels in which they are kept, even so the Vedas b3come fruitless in a person who is not of good behaviour. One may give from compassion unto a low Brahmana who is without mantras and vows, who is ignorant of the scriptures and who harbours envy. One may, from compassion, give unto a person that is poor or afflicted or ill. But he should not give unto such a person in the belief that he would derive any (spiritual) benefit from it or that he would earn any religious merit by it. There is no doubt that a gift made to a Brahmana bereft of the Vedas becomes perfectly fruitless in consequence of the fault of the recipient. As an elephant made of wood or an antelope made of leather, even so is a Brahmana that has not studied the Vedas. All the three have nothing but names. t As a eunuch is unproductive with women, as a cow is unproduc- tive with a cow, as a bird lives in vain that is featherless, even so is a Brahmana that is without mantras. As grain without kernel, as a well without water, as libations poured on ashes, even so is a gift to a Brahmana void of learning. An unlearned Brahmana is an enemy (to all) and is the destroyer of the food that is presented to the gods and Pitris. A gift made to such a person goes for nothing. He is, therefore, like unto a * I.e., one possessed of a knowledge of the Vedas.

Then, O king, the peal of drums and the delightful blare of conchs, indicative of triumph, arose. A little while after when the Brahmanas had become silent, a Rakshasa of the name of Charvaka, who had disguised himself as a Brahmana, addressed the king.

They descended on that field which was covered with hair and marrow and bones and where millions of high-souled Kshattriyas had cast away their bodies. It abounded also with many a hill formed of the bodies and bones of ele- phants and steeds, and human heads and skulls lay stretched over it like conch-shells. Variegated with thousands of funeral pyres and teeming with heaps of armour and weapons, the vast plain looked like the drinking garden of the Destroyer himself used and abandoned recently. The mighty car-warriors quickly proceeded, viewing the field of battle haunted by crowds of spirits and thronged with Bakshasas. While proceeding, the mighty-armed Kesava, that delighter of all the Yadavas, spoke unto Yudhishthira about the prowess of Jamadagni's son. 'Yonder, at a dis- tance, O Partha, are seen the five lakes of Rama !

How, bull of the Yadus, was the Kshattriya order extermi- nated by the illustrious and high-souled Rama, and how did it again grow? In frightful car-encounters millions of Kshattriyas were slain.

Resembling the thousand-eyed Indra on Earth, Kusika underwent the austerest of penances from desire of attaining the chief of the three worlds for a son. Beholding him engaged in the austerest of penances and competent to beget a son, the thousand- eyed Purandara himself inspired the king (with his force). The great lord of the three worlds, viz., the chastiser of Paka, king, then became Kusika's son known by the name of Gadhi. Gadhi had a daughter, O monarch, of the name of Satyavafci. The puissant Gadhi gave her (for wife) unto Richika, a descendant of Bhrigu. Her lord of Bhrigu's race, O de- lighter of the Kurus, became highly gratified with her for the purity of her behaviour. He cookad the sacrificial food consisting of milk and rice for giving unto Gadhi (her sire) a son. Calling his wife, Richika of Bhrigu's race said, This portion of the sanctified food should be taken by thee, and this (other) portion by thy mother ! A son will be born of her that will blaze with energy and be a bull among Kshatftriyas. Invincible by Kshattriyas on Earth, he will be the slayer of the foremost of Kshattriyas. As regards thee, blessed lady, this portion of the food will give thee a son of great wisdom, an embodiment of tranquillity, endued with ascetic penances, and the foremost of Brahmanas. Having said these words unto his wife, the blessed Richika of Bhrigu's race, setting his heart on penan- ces, proceeded to the woods. About this time, king Gadhi, resolved upon a pilgrimage to the holy waters, arrived with his queen at the retreat of Richika. Satyavati, upon this, king, taking the two portions of the sanctified food, cheerfully and in great haste, represented the words of her lord unto her mother. The qneen-mother, son of Kunti, gave the portion intended for herself unto her daughter, and herself took from ignorance the portion intended for the latter. Upon this, Satyavati, her body blazing with lustre, conceived a child of terrible form intended to become the exterminator of the Kshattriyas. Beholding Brahmana child lying within her womb, that tiger among the Bhrigus said unto his wife of celestial beauty these words : Thou hast been deceived by thy mother, blessed lady, in consequence of the substitution of the sanctified morsels. Thy son will become a person of cruel deeds and vindictive heart. Thy brother again (born of thy mother) will be a Brahmana devoted to ascetic penances. Into the sanctified food intended for thee had been placed the seed of the supreme and universal Brahma, while into that intended for thy mother had been placed the sum total of Kshattriya energy.

Kusika's son Gadbi begot a son named Viswamitra. Possessed of every attribute of a hSrahmana, that son (though born in the Kshattriya order) was equal to a Brahmana. Richika (thus) begat Jamadagni, that ocean of penances. Jamadagni begot a son of fierce deeds. The foremost of men, that son mastered the sciences, including the science of arms. Like unto a blazing fire, that son was Rama, the exterminator of the Kshattriyas. Having gratified Maba- deva on the mountains of Gandhamadana, be begged weapons of that great god, especially the axe of fierce energy in his hands. Inconsequence of that unrivalled axe of fiery splendour and irresistible sharpness, he became unrivalled on Earth. Meanwhile the mighty son of Kartaviryya, viz., Arjuna of the Kshattriya order and ruler of the Haihayas, endued with great energy, highly virtuous in behaviour, and possessed of a thousand arms through the grace of (the great Rishi) Dattatreya, having subjugated in battle, by the might of his own arms, the whole Earth with her mountains and seven islands, became a very powerful emperor and (at last) gave away the Earth unto the Brahmanas in a horse- sacrifice. On a certain occasion, solicited by the thirsty god of fire, O son of Kunti, the thousand-armed monarch of great prowess gave alms unto that deity. Springing from the point of his shafts, the god of fire, possessed of great energy, desirous of consuming '(what was offered), burnt villages and towns and kingdoms and hamlets of cowherds.

His powerful sons, always haughty and cruel, in consequence of that curse, became the indirect cause of his death. The princes, bull of Bharata' s race, seized and brought away the calf of Jamndagni's homa cow, without the knowledge of Kartaviryya the ruler of the Haihayas. For this reason a dispute took place between the high-souled Jamadagni (and the Haiha- yas). The puissant Kama, the son of Jamadagni, filled with wrath, loppad off the arms of Arjuna and brought back, monarch, his sire's calf which was wandering within the inner enclosures of the king's palace. Then the foolish sons of Arjuna, repairing together to the retreat of the high-souled Jamadagni, felled with the points of their lances, king, the head of the Rishi from off his trunk while the celebrated Eama was out for fetching sacred fuel and grass. Inflamed with wrath at the death of his father and inspired with vengeance, Rama vowed to free the Earth of Kshattriyas and took up arms. Then that tiger among the Bhrigus, possessed of great energy, putting forth his prowess, speedily slaughtered all the sons and grandsons of Kartaviryya. Slaughtering thousands of flaihayas in rage, the descendent of Bhrigu, king, made the Earth miry with blood. Possessed of great energy, he quickly reft the Earth of all Kshattriyas. Filled then with compassion, he retired into the woods. Afterwards, when some thousands of years had passed away, the puissant Rama, who was wrathful by nature, had imputations cast upon him (of cowardice). Tbe grandson of Viswamitra and son of Raivya, possessed of great ascetic merit, named Paravasu, Q monarch, began to cast imputa- tions on Rama in public, saying, O Rama, were not those righteous men, viz., Pratarddana and others, who were assembled at a sacrifice at the time of Yayati's fall, Kshattriyas by birth ? Thou art not of true vows, Rama ! Thine is an empty boast among people ! Through fear of Kshattriya heroes thou hast betaken thyself to the mountains !

It behoveth thee not, O Rama, to reside within (what is) my dominion ! At these words, Ocean suddenly created for Jamadagni's son, on his other shore, a region called Surparaka. Kasyapa also, monarch, having accepted the Earth in gift, and made a present of it unto the Brahmanas, entered the great forest. Then Sudras and Vaisyas, acting most wilfully, began to unite themselves, bull of Bharata's race, with the wives of Brahmanas. When anarchy sets in on Earth, the weak are oppressed by the strong, and no man is master of his own property. Unprotected duly by Kshattriyas observant of virtue, and oppressed by the wicked in consequence of that disorder, the Earth quickly sank to the lowest depths. Beholding the Earth sinking from fear, the high-souled Kasyapa held her on his lap-, and since the great Rishi held her on his lap (urn) therefore is the Earth known by the name of Urvi. The goddess Earth, for protection's sake, gratified Kasyapa and begged of him a king. \"The Earth said, There are, O regenerate one, some foremost of Kshattriyas concealed by me among women.

After this discourse was ended, those two illustrious persons, viz., Krishna of Unfading glory and Yudhishthira proceeded thither where the puissant son of Ganga lay on his bed of arrows.

Hear from me, Yudhishthira, with concentrated attention, the whole range of kingly duties described with accurate details, and other duties that you mayst desire to know. In the first place, foremost one of Kuru's race, the king should, from desire of pleasing (his subjects), wait with humility upon the gods and the Brabma- nas, always bearing himself agreeably to the ordinance. By worshipping the deities and the Brahmanas, perpetuater of Kuru's race, the king pays off his debt to duty and morality, and receives the respect of his subjets. son, thou shouldst always exert with promptitude, Yudhishthira, for without promptitude of exertion mere destiny never accomplishes the objects cherished by kings. These two, viz., exertion and destiny, are equal (in their operation). Of them, I regard exertion to be superior, for destiny is ascertained from the results of what is begun with exertion. Do not indulge in grief if what is commenced ends disastrously, for thou saouldst then exert thyself in the same act with redoubled attention. This is the high duty of kings. There is nothing which contributes so much to the success of kings as Truth. The king who is devoted to Truth finds happiness bofch here and hereafter. As regards Rishis also, king, Truth is their great wealth. Similarly, as regards kings, there is nothing that so much inspires confidence in them as Truth. The king that is possessed of every accomplishment and good behavioar, that is self-restrained, humble, and righteous, that has his passions under control, that is of hand- some features and not too enquiring,* never loses prosperity. By adminis- tering justice, by attending to these three, viz., concealment of his own weaknesses, ascertainment of the weaknesses of foes, and keeping his own counsels, as also by the observance of conduct that is straightforward, the king, Odelighterof the Kurus, obtains prosperity. If the king becomes mild, everybody disregards him. On the other hand, if he becomes fierce, his subjects then become troubled. Therefore, do thou observe both kinds of behaviour. O foremost of liberal men, the Brahmanas should never be punished by thee, for the Brahmana, son of Pandu, is the foremost of beings on the Earth. The high-souled Manu, king of kings, hath sung two Slokas. In respect of thy duties, thou of Kuru's race, thou shouldst always bear them in mind. Fire hath sprung from water, the Kshattriya from the Brahmana, and iron from stone. The three (viz,, fire, Kshattriya, and iron,) can exert their force on every other thing, but coming into con- tact with their respective progenitors, their force becomes neutralised. * In the sense of being liberal. A king should not too minutely enquire into what is done with the things belonging to him, T."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"120 MAHABHARATA When iron strikes stone, or fire battles with water, or Kshattriya cherishes enmity towards Brahmana, these three soon become weak.

Duly worshipped, they uphold the Vedas and the Sacrifices. But they, tiger among kings, that desire to have such honour however much they may be impediments to the three worlds, should ever be repressed by the might of thy arms. The great Rishi Usanas, son, sang two Slokas in days of old, Listen to them, king, with concentrated attention. The righteous Kshattriya, mindful of his duties, should chastise a Brahmana that may be a very master of the Vedas if he rushes to battle with an uplifted weapon. The Kshattriya, conversant with duties, that upholds righteous- ness when it is trespassed against, does not, by that act, become a sinner, for the wrath of the assailant justifies the wrath of the chastiser. Subject to these restrictions, tiger among kings, the Brahmanas should be protected. If they become offenders, they should then be exiled beyond thy dominions. Even when deserving of punishment, thou shouldst, king, show them compassion. If a Brahmana becomes guilty of Brahmani- cide, or of violating the bed of his preceptor or other revered senior, or of causing miscarriage, or of treason against fche king, his punishment should be banishment from thy dominions. No corporal chastisement is laid down for them. Those persons that show respect towards the Brahmanas should be favoured by thee (with offices in the state). There is no treasure more valuable to kings than that which consists in the selection and assemblage of servants. Among the six kinds of citadels indicated in the scriptures, indeed among every kind of citadel, that which consists of (the ready service and the love of the) subjects is the most impregnable. Therefore, the king who is possessed of wisdom should always show compassion towards the four orders of his subjects. The king who is of righteous soul and truthful speech succeeds in gratifying his subjects. Thou must not, however, son always behave with forgiveness towards everybody, for the king that is mild is regarde i as the worst of his kind like an elephant that is reft of fierceness, In the scriptures composed by Vrihaspati, a Sloka was in days of old applicable to the present matter.

Asamanjas, O king, used to drown the children of the citizens in the Sarayu. His sire, therefore, rebuked him and sent him to exile. The Rishi Uddalaka cast off his favourite son Swataketu (afterwards) of rigid penances, because the latter used to invite Brahoaanas with deceptive promises of entertainment. The happiness of their subjects, observance of truth, and sincerity of behaviour are the eternal duty of kings. The king should not covet the wealth of others. He should in time give what should be given. If the king becomes possessed of prowess, truthful in speech, and forgiving in temper, he would never fall away from prosperity. With soul cleansed of vices, the king should be able to govern his wrath, and all his conclusions should be comformable to the scriptures. He ehould also always pursue morality and profit and pleasure and salvation (judiciously). The king should always conceal his counsels in respect of these three, (viz., morality, profit, and pleasure). No greater evil can befall the king than the disclosure of bis counsels. Kings should protect the four orders in the discharge of their duties. It is the eternal duty of kings to prevent a confusion of duties in respect of the different orders. The king should not repose confidence (on others than his OWQ servants), nor should he repose full confidence (on even his servants). He should, by his own intelligence, look after the merits and defects of the six essential requisites of sovereignty.!

The king should administer justice like Yama and amass wealth like Kuvera. He should also be observant of the merits and defects of his own acquisitions and losses and of his own dominions. He should feed those thab have not been fed, and enquire after those that have been fed. Possessed of sweet speech, he could speak with a smiling (and not with a sour) countenance. He should always wait upon those that are old in years and repress procrastination. He should never covet what belongs to others. He should firmly follow the behaviour of the righteous and, therefore, observe that behaviour carefully. He should never take wealth from those that are righteous. Taking the wealth of those that are not righteous he should give it unto them that are righteous. The king should himself be skilful in smiting. He should practise liberality. He should have his soul under control. He should dress himself with splendour. He should make gifts in season and be regular in his meals. He should also be of good behaviour. The king desirous of obtaining prosperity should always bind to his service men that are brave, devoted, incapable of being deceived by foes,* well-born, healthy, well-behaved, and connected with families that are well-behaved, respectable, never inclined to insult others, conversant with all the sciences, possessing a knowledge of the world and its affairs, never unmindful of the future state of existence, always observant of their duties, honest, and stead-fast like mountains. There should be no difference between him and them as regards objects of enjoyment. The only distinction should consist in his umbrella and his power of passing orders. His conduct towards them, before or behind, should be the same. The king who behaves in this way never comes to grief. That crooked and covetous king who suspects every body and who taxes his subjects heavily, is soon deprived of life by his own servants and relatives. That king, however, who is of righteous behaviour and who is ever engaged in attracting the hearts of his people, never sinks when attacked by foes. If overcome, he soon regains his position.

The following verse was sung in days of old by Usanas of Bhrigu's race, in the narrative called Bamacharita, on the subject, Bharata, of kingly duties. One should first select a king (in whose domi- nions to live). Then should he select a wife, and then earn wealth. If there be no king, what would become of his wife and acquisitions ? Eegarding those that are desirous of kingdom, there is no other eternal duty more obligatory than the protection (of subjects). The protection the king grants to his subjects upholds the world.* Manu, the son of Prachetas, sang these two verses respecting the duties of kings. Listen to them with attention. These six persons should be avoided like a leaky boat on the sea, viz., a preceptor that does not speak, a priest that has not studied the scriptures, a king that does not grant protection, a wife that utters what is disagreeable, a cow-herd that likes to rove within the village, and a barber that is desirous of going to the woods.f ' ' SECTION LVIII \"Bhishma said, 'Protection of the subject, Yudhishthira, is the very cheese of kingly duties.

JKeadiness for exertion in kings is the root of kingly duties. This has been said by Vrihaspati. Listen to the verses sung by him. By exertion the amrita was obtained ; by exertion the Asuras were slain ; by exertion Indra him- self obtained sovereignty in heaven and on Earth. The hero of exertion is superior to the heroes of speech. The heroes of speech gratify and worship the heroes of exertion.* The king that is destitute of exertion, even if possessed of intelligence, is always overcome by foes like a snake that is bereft of poison. The king, even if possessed of strength, should not disregard a foe however weak. A spark of fire can produce a conflagration and a particle of poison can kill. With only one kind of force, an enemy from within a fort, can afflict the whole country of even a powerful and prosperous king. The secret speeches of a king, the amassing of troops for obtaining victory, the crooked purposes in his heart, similar intents for accomplishing particular objects, and the wrong acts he does or intends to do, should be concealed by putting on an appearance of candour.

At first there was no sovereignty, no king, no chastisement, and no chastiser. All men used to protect one another righteously. As they thus lived, O Bharata, righteously protecting one another, they found the task (after some time) to be painful. Error then began to assail their hearts. Having become subject to error, the perceptions of men, prince, came to be clouded, and thence their virtue began to decline* When their perceptions were dimmed and when men became subj ot to error, all of them became covetous, O chief of the Bbaratas ! And because men sought to obtain objects which they did not possess, another passion called lust (of acquisition) got hold of them. When they became subject to lust, another passion, named wrath, soon soiled them. Once subject to wrath, they lost all consideration of what should be done and what should not. Unrestrained sexual indulgence set in. Men began to utter what they chose. All disiinctions between food that is clean and unclean and between virtue and vice disappeared. When this confusion set in amongst men, the Vedas disappeared. Upon the disappearance of the Vedas, righteousness was lost. When both the Vedas and righteousness were lost, the gods were possessed by fear. Overcome with fear, tiger among men, they sought the protection of Brahmana. Having gratified the divine Grandsire of the uni- verse, the gods, afflicted with grief, said unto him, with joined hands, O god, the eternal Vedas have been afflicted in the world of men by covetous- ness and error ! For this, we have been struck with fear. Through loss of the Vedas, O Supreme Lord, righteousness also has been lost !

Next, that preceptor of Yoga, of great celebrity, viz., Kavi of immeasurable wisdom, reduced it further into a work of a thousand lessons. In view of the period of men's lives and the general decrease (of every thing), great Rishis did thus, for benefiting the world, abridge that science. The gods then, approaching that lord of creatures, viz., Vishnu, said unto him, Indicate, gods that one among mortals who deserves to have superiority over the rest ! The divine and puissant Narayana, reflecting a little, created, by a fiat of his will, a son born of his energy, named Virajas, The highly blessed Virajas, however, did not desire sovereignty on Earth. His mind, son of Paadu, inclined to a life of renunciation. Virajas had a son named Krittimat. He too renounced pleasure and enjoyment.* Krittimat had a son named Kardama. Kardama also practised severe austerities. The lord of creatures, Kardama, begot a son named Ananga. Ananga became a protector of creatures, pious in behaviour, and fully conversant with the science of chastisement. Ananga begot a son named Ativala, well versed in policy. Obtaining extensive empire after the demise of his sire, he became a slave of his passions. Mrityu, O king, had a daughter born of bis mind, named Sunita and celebrated over the three worlds. She was married to Ativala and gave birth to a son named Vena. Vena, a slave of wrath and malice, became unrighteous in his conduct towards all creatures. The Rishis, those utters of Brahma, slew him with Kusa blades (as their weapon) inspired with mantras. Uttering mantras the while, those Rishis pierced the right thigh of Vena, Thereupon, from that thigh, came out a short-limbed person on Earth, resembling a charred brand, with blood-red eyes and black hair.

The goddess Sree was born of that lotus. She became the spouse of Dharma of great intelligence. Upon Sree, son of Pandu, Dharma begot Artha. All the three, viz,. Dharma, and Artha and Sree, were established in sovereignty. A person upon the exhaustion of his merit, comes down from heaven to Earth, and takes birth as a king conversant with the science of chastisement. Such a person becomes endued with greatness and is really a portion of Vishnu on Earth. He becomes possessed of great intelligence and obtains superiority over others. Established by the gods, no one transcends him. It is for this reason that everybody acts in obedience to one, and it is for this that the world cannot command him. Good acts, king, lead to good. It is for this that the multitude obey his words of command, though he belongs to the same world and is possessed of similar limbs. He who once beheld Prithu's amiable face became obedient to him.

Those duties, however, which belong exclusively to Brahmanas, I shall now tell thee I Self-restraint, O king, has been declared to be the first duty of Brahmanas. Study of the Vedas, and patience in undergoing austerities, (are also their other duties). By practising these two, all their acts are accomplished. If while engaged in the observance of his own duties, without doing any improper act, wealth comes to a peaceful Brahmana possessed of knowledge, he should then marry and seek to beget children and should also practise charity and perform sacrifices. It has baen declared by the wise that wealth thus obtained should be enjoyed by distributing it (among deserving persons and relatives), By his study of the Vedas all the pious acts (laid down for the Brahmana) are accomplished. Whether he does or does not achieve anything else, if he devotes himself to the study of the Vedas, he becomes (by that) known as a Brahmana or the friend of all creatures. I shall also tell thee, Bharata, what the duties are of a Kshattriya. A Kshattriya, king, should give but not beg, should himself perform sacrifices but not officiate as a priest in the sacrifices of other's. He should never teach (the Vedas) but study (them with a Brahmana preceptor). He should protect the people. Always exerting himself for the destruction of robbers and wicked people, he should put forth his prowess in battle. Those among Kshattriya rulers who perform great sacrifices, who are possessed of a knowledge of the Vedas, and who gain victories in battle, become foremost of those that acquire many blessed regions hereafter by their merit. Persons conversant with the old scriptures do not applaud that Kshattriya who returns unwounded from battle. This has been declared to be the conduct of a wretched Kshattriya.* There is no higher duty for him than the suppression of robbers. Gifts, study, and sacrifices, bring prosperity to kings. Therefore, a king who desires to acquire religious merit should engage in battle. f Establishing all his sub- jects in the observance of their respective duties, a king should cause all of them to do everything according to the dictates of righteousness. Whether ha does or does not do any other act, if only he protects his subjects, he is regarded to accomplish all religious acts and is called a Kshattriya and the foremost of men. I shall now tell thee, Yudhishthira, what the eternal duties of the Vaisya are. A Vaisya should make gifts, study the Vedas, perform sacrifices, and acquire wealth by fair means. With proper attention he should also protect and rear all (domestic) animals as a sire protecting his sons. Anything else that he will do will be regarded as improper for him. By protecting the (domestic) animals he would obtain great happiness. The Creator, having created the (domestic) animals, bestowed their care upon the Vaisya.

A seventh also is his share in the profits arising from the trade in horns, but he should take a sixteenth if the trade be in hoofs.

A Vaisya should never desire that he should not tend cattle. If a Vaisya desires to tend cattle, no one else should be employed in that task. I should tell thee, Bharata, what the duties of a Sudra are. The Creator intended the Sudra to become the servant of the other three orders. For this, the service of the three other classes is the duty of the Sudra. By such service of the other three, a Sudra may obtain great happiness. He should wait upon the three other classes according to their order of seniority. A Sudra should never amass wealth, lest, by his wealth, he makes the numbers of the three superior classes obedient to him. By this he would incur sin. With the king's permission, however, a Sudra, for performing religious acts, may earn wealth. I shall now tell thee the profession he should follow and the weans by which he may earn his liveli- hood. It is said that Sudras should certainly be maintained by the (three) other orders. Worn out umbrellas, turbans, beds and seats, shoes, and fans, should be given to the Sudra servants.* Torn clothes which are no longer fit for wear, should be given away by the regenerate classes unto the Sudra. These are the latter's lawful acquisitions. Men conversant with morality say that if the Sudra approaches any one belonging to the three regenerate orders from desire of doitig menial service, the latter should assign him proper work. Unto the sonless Sudra his master should offer the funeral cake. The weak and the old amongst them should be main- tained.! The Sudra should never abandon his master, whatever the nature or degree of the distress into which the latter may fall. If the master loses his wealth, he should with excessive zeal be supported by the Suara servant. A Sudra cannot have any wealth that is his own. Whatever he possesses belongs lawfully to his master. J Sacrifice has been laid down as a duty of the three other orders. It has been ordained for the Sudra also, Bharata !

T. t This ordinance lays down that the Dakshina should be a hundred thousand animals such as kine or horses.

As animals, if slaughtered by the vulgar, become the means of destroying the virtue and the religious acts of the slaughterers even so all other duties, if deprived of the protection given by kingly duties, become liable to attack and destruction, and men, full of anxiety, disregard the practices laid down for them. 1 ' SECTION LXIV \"Bhishma said, 'The duties in respect of all the four modes of life, those of yatis, O son of Pandu, and the customs relating to the conduct of men in general, are all included in kingly duties. All these acts, chief of the Bharatas, occur in Kshattriya duties. If the functions of royalty are disturbed, all creatures are overtaken by evil. The duties of men are not obvious. They have, again, many outlets.* Led by many (false) systems, their eternal nature is sometimes offended against. Others who pin their faith to the conclusions arrived at by men, without really knowing any- thing about the truths of duties (as declared in the scriptures), find themselves at last landed and confounded on faiths whose ultimate ends are unknown. The duties imposed upon Kshattriyas are plain, productive of great happiness, evident in respect of their results, free from deceit, and beneficial to the whole world. As the duties of the three orders, as also of Brahmanas and of those that have retired from the world, Yudhishthira, have before this been said to be all included within those of that eaored mode of life (called Garhastya), even so, the whole world, with all good actions, are subject to kingly duties.

In that sacrifice he worshipped with humility the great Vishnu. The Supreme Lord, assuming the form of Indra, showed himself unto him. Accompanied by many good kings he offered his adorations to that puissant deity. The high discourse took place between that lion among kings and that illustrious god in the form of Indra, touching Vishnu of great effulgence. \"Indra said, What is your object, foremost of virtuous persons, in thus seeking to behold that Ancient and First of gods, viz., Narayana, of inconceivable energy, and infinite illusions ?

Without doubt, however, I desire to see the first of gods.

Kingly duties first flowed from the original god. Other duties flowed afterwards from his body. Infinite were the other duties, with those of the Vana- prastha mode of life, that were created afterwards. The fruits of all those are exhaustible. Kingly duties, however, are distinguished above them. In them are included all other duties. For this reason Kshattriya duties are said to be the foremost of all. In days of old, Vishnu, by acting according to Kshattriya duties, forcibly suppressed and destroyed his foes and thereby afforded relief to the gods and the Rishis of immeasurable energy.

The eternal duties (of men) had all suffered destruction. It was by the exercise of Kshattriya duties that they were revived.* In every Yuga, the duties of Brahmanas in respect of attaining to Brahma first set in. These, however, are all protected by kingly duties. The latter, on this account, are regarded as the foremost. Casting away life in battle, compassion for all creatures, knowledge of the affairs of the world, protection of men, rescuing them from danger, relie- ving the distressed and the oppressed, all these occur among Kshattriya duties practised by kings. Persons that do not regard wholesome restraints and that are governed by lust and wrath, do not commit overt acts of sin from fear of kings. Others that are docile and of righteous behaviour succeed, in consequence of the same influence, in performing all their duties. Eor this reason Kshattriya duties are regarded to be righteous. Without doubt, all creatures live happily in the world, protected by kings exercising Kahattriya duties like children protected by their parents. Kshattriya duties are the foremost of all duties. Those eternal duties, regarded as the first in the world, embrace the protection of every creature. Themselves eternal, they had to eternal emancipation. SECTION LXV 14 'Indra said, Kshattriya duties, O king, which are, possessed of such energy, which include in their exercise all other duties, and which are the foremost of all duties, should be observed by persons that are, like thee, so high-souled and so employed in seeking the good of the world. If those duties are not properly discharged, all creatures would be overtaken by ruin. The king, possessed of compassion for all creatures, should regard these to be the foremost of his duties, viz., reclaiming the land for cultiva- tion and fertilizing it, performance of great sacrifices for cleansing himself, a disregard for begging, and protection of subjects. Abandonment (gift) is said by the sages to be the foremost of virtues. Of all kinds of abandon- ment, again, that of the body in battle, is the foremost. Thou hast seen with thy own eyes how the rulers of the Earth, ever observant of Kshattriya duties, having duly waited upon their preceptors and acquired great learning, at last cast off their bodies, engaged in battle with one another. The Kshattriya, desirous of acquiring religious merit, should, after having gone through the Brahmacharyya mode, should lead a life of domesticity which is always meritorious. In adjucating upon ordinary questions of right (between his subjects), he should be thoroughly impartial.

The other orders are able to observe their respective duties in consequence of kingly duties. For this reason the former are said to be dependent upon the latter in respect of the merit they produce.* Those men who disregard all wholesome restraints and who are too much attached to the pursuit of worldly objects are said to be of the nature of brutes. They are compelled to act with justice by the exercise of kingly duties. Those duties, therefore, are said to be the foremost of all. That course of conduct which has been prescribed for Brahmanas who follow the three Vedas, and those mode of life that have been laid down for Brahmanas, should, before everything else be observed by every Brahmana, If a Brahmana acts otherwise, he should be punished like a Sudra. The duties of the four modes of life and the ritual prescribed in the Vedas, king, should ever be followed by a Brahmana. Know that he has no other duties. For a Brahmana acting otherwise, a Kshattriya should nofc make any arrangement for sustenance. His religious merit grows in consequence of his acts. A Brahmana, indeed, is like Dharma's self. That Brahmana who is employed in acts that are not laid down for him, deserves no respect. If not engaged in his proper acts, he should not be trusted. These are the duties that appertain to the several orders. Kshattriyas should take care of them so that their observance may be improved. Even these are the duties of Kshattriyas. For these reasons also, kingly duties and no others, are the foremost of all. They are, as I believe, the duties of heroes, and they that are heroes are foremost in practising them ! \"Mandhatri said, What duties should be performed by the Yavanas, the Kiratas, the Gandharas, the Chinas, the Savaras, the Barbaras, the Sakas, the Tusharas, the Kankas, the Palhavas, the Andhras, the Madrakas, the Paundras, the Pulindas, the Ramathas, the Kamvojas, the several castes that have sprung up from Brahmanas and Kshattriyas, the Vaisyas, and the Sudras, that reside in the dominions of (Arya) kings?

All these acts which have been laid down for all others should be done by persons of also the robber class, O king ! \"Mandhatri said, In the world of men, such wicked men may be seen living in disguise among all the four orders and in all the four modes of life. \"Indra said, Upon the disappearance of kingly duties and of the science of chastisement, all creatures became exceedingly afflicted, sin- less one, in consequence of the tyranny of kings. After the expiry of this the Krita age, a confusion will set in, regarding the different modes of life, and innumerable Bhikshus will appear with sectyrial marks of different kinds. Disregarding the Puranas and the high truths of religion, men, urged by lust and wrath, will deviate into wrong paths. When sinful men are restrained (from wicked acts) by high-souled persons with the aid of the science of chastisement, then religion, which is superior to everything and eternal, and which is the source of everything good, becomes firmly established. The gifts, and libations, and offerings to the Fitris, of the man that disregards the king who is superior to every one, become fruitless. The very gods do not disregard a virtuous king who is truly an eternal god. The divine Lord of all creatures, having created the universe, intended the Kshattriya to rule men regarding their inclinations and disinclinations in respect of duties. I respect and worship that person who, aided by bis understanding, watches the course of the duties performed by men. Upon such supervision rest Kshattriya duties ! \"Bhisbma continued, 'Having said these words, the divine and puissant Narayana in the form of Indra, accompanied by the Maruts, repaired to his eternal abode of inexhaustible felicity. When, sinless one, duties as practised by the good had such a course way in days of old, what man of cleansed soul and learning is there that would disregard the Kshattriya ?

If, on the other hand, he be engaged, he may exterminate all. That cow which cannot be easily milked has to suffer much torture. On the other hand, that cow which is capable of being easily milked, has not to suffer any torture whatever. The wood that bends easily does nor require to be heated. The tree that bends easily, has not to suffer any torture (at the hands of the gardener). Guided by these instances, hero, men should bend before those that are powerful. The man that bends his head to a powerful person really bends his head to Indra. For these reasons, men desirous of prosperity should (elect and) crown some person as their king. They who live in countries where anarchy prevails cannot enjoy their wealth and wives. During times of anarchy, the sinful man derives great pleasure by robbing the wealth of other people. When, how- ever, his (ill-got) wealth is snatched by others, he wishes for a king. It is evident, therefore, that in times of anarchy the very wicked even cannot be happy.

Nobody would hear the evil speeches of others, far less actual assaults, if the king did not righteously protect the earth. 1 If the king exercises the duty of protection, women decked with ornament may fearlessly wander everywhere without male relatives to attend upon them. Men become righteous and without injuring serve one another because the king exercises the duty of protection. 1 The sense seems to be that men patiently bear the injuries inflicted upon them by others, without seeking to right themselves by force, because they can invoke the king to punish the offenders.

No one should disregard the king by taking him for a man, for he is really a high divinity in human form. The king assumes five different forms according to five different occasions. He becomes Agni, Aditya, Mrityu, Vaisravana, and Yama. When the king, deceived by falsehood, burns with his fierce energy the sinful offenders before him, he is then said to assume the form of Agni. When he observes through his spies the acts of all persons and does what is for the general good, he is then said to assume the form of Aditya. When he destroys in wrath hundreds of wicked men with their sons, grandsons, and relatives, he is then said to assume the form of the Destroyer. When he restrains the wicked by inflicting upon them severe punishments and favours the righteous by bestowing rewards upon them, he is then said to assume the form of Yama.

These should all be persons who have been thoroughly examined (in respect of their ability), who are possessed of wisdom, and who are able to endure hunger and thirst. With proper attention, the king should set his spies upon all his counselors and friends and sons, in his city and the provinces, and in dominions of the chiefs under him. His spies should be so employed that they may not know one another. He should also, O bull of Bharata's race, know the spies of his foes by himself setting spies in shops and places of amusement, and concourses of people, among beggars, in his pleasure gardens and parks, in meetings and con- claves of the learned, in the country, in public places, in places where he holds his own court, and in the houses of the citizens.

The acquisition of dominion should be made by the three well-known means (of conciliation, gift, and disunion). The king that is possessed of wisdom should be gratified with those acquisitions that are made by means of conciliation, gift, and disunion. The king, O delighter of the Kurus, should take a sixth of the incomes of his subjects as tribute for meeting the expenses of protecting them. He should also forcibly take away wealth, much or little (as the case may require), from the ten kinds of offenders mentioned in the scriptures, for the protection of his subjects. A king should, without doubt, look upon his subjects as his own children. In determining their disputes, how- ever, he should not show compassion. For hearing the complaints and answers of disputants in judicial suits, the king should always appoint persons possessed of wisdom and a knowledge of the affairs of the world, for the state really rests upon a proper administration of justice. The king should set honest and trustworthy men over his mines, salt, grain, ferries, and elephant corps. The king who always wields with propriety the rod of chastisement earns great merit. The proper regulation of chastisement is the high duty of kings and deserves great applause. The king should be conversant with the Vedas and their branches, possessed of wisdom, engaged in penances, charitable, and devoted to the performance of sacrifices. All these qualities should permanently reside in a king. If the king foils to administer justice, he can neither have heaven nor fame. If a king be afflicted by a stronger one, the former, if possessed of intelligence, should seek refuge in a fort. Assembling his friends for consultation, he should devise proper means. Adopting the policy of conciliation and of producing dissensions, he should devise means for waging on war with the assailant. He should set the inhabitants of the woods on the high roads, and, if necessary, cause whole villages to be removed, transplanting all the inhabitants to minor towns or the outskirts of great cities. Repeatedly assuring his wealthy subjects and the principal officers of the army, he should cause the inhabitants of the open country to take refuge in such forts as are well-protected. He should himself withdraw all stores of grain (from the open country into his forts). If that becomes impossible, he should destroy them completely by fire. He should set men for destroying the crops on the fields of the enemy (by producing disunion among the enemy's subjects). Failing to do this, he should destroy those crops by means of his own troops. He should destroy all the bridges over the rivers in his kingdom. He should bale out the waters of all the tanks in his dominions, or, if incapable of baling them out, cause them to be poisoned.

He should raise outer ramparts round his forts, with enclosures in them, and fill his trenches with water, driving pointed stakes at their bottom and filling them with crocodiles and sharks. He should keep small openings in his walls for making sallies from his fort, and carefully make arrangements for their defence like that of the greater gates. 3 In all his gates he should plant destructive engines. He should plant on the ramparts (of his forts) Salaghnis and other weapons. He should store wood for fuel and dig and repair wells foi supply of water to the garrison. He should cause all houses made of grass and straw to be plastered over with mud, and if it is the summer month, he should, from fear of fire, withdraw (into a place of safety) all the stores of grass and straw. He should order all food to be cooked at night. No fire should be ignited during the day, except for the daily homa. Particular care should be taken of the fires in smitheries and lying-in rooms. Fires kept within the houses of the inhabitants should be well covered. For the effectual protection of the city.it should be proclaimed that condign punishment will overtake the per- son who ignites fires by the day time. During such times, all beggars, eunuch, lunatics, and mimes, should, O foremost of men, be driven out of the town, for if they are permitted to remain, evil will follow.

After any task of the king has been accomplished, he should reward those that have aided in its accomplishment with wealth and other proportionate gifts and thankful speeches. It has been laid down in the scriptures, O delighter of the Kurus, that a king pays off his debt when he discomfits his foe or slays him outright. 1 A king should take care of seven things. Listen to me as I recite them. They are his own self, his counsellers, his treasury, his machinery for awarding punishments, his friends, his provinces, and his capital. He should with care protect his kingdom which consists of these seven limbs. That king, O tiger among men, who is conversant with the aggregate of six, the triple aggregate, and the high aggregate of three, succeeds in winning the sovereignty of the whole Earth. Listen, O Yudhishthira, to what has been called the aggregate of six. These are ruling in paace after concluding a treaty (with the foe), marching to battle, producing disunion among the foe, concentration of forces for inspiring the foe with fear, preparedness for war with readiness for p?ace, and alliance with others. Listen now with attention to what has been called the triple aggregate. They are decrease, main- tenance of what is, and growth. The high aggregate of three consists of Virtue, Profit, and Pleasure. These should be pursued judiciously. By the aid of virtue, a king succeeds in ruling the Earth for ever. Touching this matter, Angirasa's son Vrihaspati himself has sung two verses. Blessed be thou, O son of Devaki, it behoveth thee to hear them. Having discharged all his duties and having protected the Earth, and having also protected his cities, a king attains to great happiness in heaven. What are penances to that king, and what need has he of sacrifices who protects his people properly ?

Tell me, O grandsire, what advantage is derived by one of these from the others.' \"Bhishma said, Listen to me, O king, as I describe, O Bharata, the great blessedness of the science of chastisement, in sacred words of grave import.

Whether it is the king that makes the age, or, it is the age that makes the king, is a question about which thou shouldst not entertain any doubt. The truth is that the king makes the age. When the king rules with a complete and strict reliance on the science of chastisement, the fore- most of ages called Krita is then said to set in. 1 Righteousness sets in the Krita age. Nothing of unrighteousness exists then. The hearts of men belonging to all the four orders do not take any pleasure in un- righteousness. Without doubt, all men succeed in acquiring the objects they desire and preserving those that have been acquired. All the Vedic rites become productive of merit. All the seasons become delightful and free from evil. The voice, pronunciation, and minds of all men become clear and cheerful. Diseases disappear and all men become long-lived. Wives do not become widows, and no person becomes a miser. The earth yields crops without being tilled, and herbs and plants grow in luxuriance. Barks, leaves, fruits, and roots, become vigorous and abundant. No unrighteousness is seen. Nothing but righteousness exists. Know these to be the characteristics, O Yudhish- thira, of the Krita age ! When the king relies upon only three of the four parts of the science of chastisement leaving out a fourth, the age called Treta sets in. A fourth part of unrighteousness follows in the train of such observance (of the great science) by three-fourths. The Earth yields crops but waits for tillage. The herbs and plants grow (depending upon tillage). When the king observes the great science by only a half, leaving out the other half, then the age that sets in is called Dwapara. A moiety of unrighteousness follows in the train of such observance of the great science by half. The Earth requires tillage and yields crops by half. When the king, abandoning the great science totally, oppresses his subjects by evil means of diverse kinds, the age that sets in is called Kali. During the age called Kali, unrighteousness becomes full and nothing of righteousness is seen. The hearts of men, of all the orders, fall away from their respective duties. Sudraslive by adopting lives of mendicancy, and Brahmanas live by serving others. Men fail to acquire the objects they desire and preserve those already acquired. Intermixture of the four orders takes place. Vedic rites fail to produce fruits* All the seasons cease to be delightful and become fraught with evil. The voice, pronunciation, and minds of men lose vigour. 1 The correct reading seems to be sreshtham and not sriMavn.

The king is the cause of the fourth age (called Kali). If he causes the Krita age, he attains to everlasting heaven. If he causes the Treta age, he acquires heaven for a period that is limited. If he causes the Dwapara, he attains to blessedness in heaven according to the measure of his merits. By causing the Kali age, the king incurs a heavy load of sin. Stained by wickedness, he rots in hell for innumerable years, for sinking in the sins of his subjects, he incurs great sin and infamy him- self. Keeping the great science in his view, the Kshatriya possessed of learning should strive to acquire those objects which he desires and protect those that have been already acquired. The science of chastise- ment, which establishes all men in the observance of their respective duties, which is the groundwork of all wholesome distinctions, and which truly upholds the world and sets it agoing, if pioperly adminis- tered, protects all men like the mother and the father protecting their children. Know, O bull among men, that the very lives of creatures depend upon it. The highest merit a king can acquire is acquaintance with the science of chastisement and administering it properly.

For waiting upon these three orders, O ruler of men, a fourth order, viz., the Sudra, sprung into life, being created from the feet (of Brahman). Originally created thus, the Brahmana takes birth on Earth as the lord of all creatures, his duty being the keep of the Vedas and the other scrip- tures. 1 Then, for ruling the Earth and wielding the rod of chastisement and protecting all creatures, the second order, viz. t the Kshattriya was created. The Vaisya was created for supporting the two other orders and himself by cultivation and trade, and finally, it was ordained by Brahman that the Sudra should serve the three orders as a menial. \" 'Pururavas said, Tell me truly, O god of Winds to whom does this Earth righteously belong ! Does it belong to the Brahmana or to the Kshattriya ? \" The god of Wind said, Everything that exists in the universe belongs to the Brahmana in consequence of his birth and precedence. Persons conversant with morality say this. What the Brahmana eats is his own. The place he inhabits in his own. What he gives away is his own. He deserve the veneration of all the (other) orders.

This is the first rule. In times, how- ever, of distress, there is an exception to this. If thou seekest to discharge the duties of thy order and wishest to obtain the highest place in heaven, then give unto the Brahmana all the land thou mayst succeed in conquering, unto him that is possessed of learning and virtuous conduct, that is conversant with duties and observant of penances, that is satisfied with the duties of his order and not covetous of wealth.

The priest of the king, therefpre, has a share in the merit that the king acquires. When the king behaves himself thus, all his subjects, relying upon him, become virtuous in their behaviour, attentive to their duties, and freed from every fear. The king obtains a fourth part of those righteous acts which his subjects, properly protected by him, perform in his kingdom. The gods, men, Pitris, Gandharvvs, Uragas, and Rakshasas, all depend upon sacrifices for their support. In a country destitute of a king, there can be no sacri6ce. The gods and the Pitris subsist on the offer- ings made in sacrifices. Sacrifice, however, depends upon the king. In the season of summer, men desire comfort from the shade of trees, cool water, and cool breezes. In the season of winter they derive com- fort from fire, warm clothes, and the sun. The heart of man may find pleasure in sound, touch, taste, vision, and scent. The man, however, who is inspired with fear, finds no pleasure in all these things. That person who dispells the fears of men obtains great merit. There is no gift so valuable in the three worlds as the gift of life. The king is Indra. The king is Yama. The king is Dharma. The king assumes different forms. The king sustains and supports everything. SECTION LXXIII \"Bhishma said, The king, with an eye to both religious merit and profit whose considerations are often very intricate, should, with- out delay, appoint a priest possessed of learning and intimate acquain- tance with the Vedas and the (other) scriptures. Those kings that have priests possessed of virtuous souls and conversant with policy, and that are themselves possessed of such attributes, enjoy prosperity in every direction. Both the priest and the king should have such qualities as are worthy of regard and should be observant of vows and penances. They would then succeed in supporting and agrandising the subjects and the deities, the Pitris and the children. 1 It is laid down that they should be possessed of similar hearts and should be each other's friends. In consequence of such friendship between Brahmana and Kshattriya, the subjects become happy. If they do not regard each other, destruction would overtake the people. The Brahmana and the Kshattriya are said to be the progenitors of all men. In this connection is cited the old story about the discourse between Aila's son and Kas- yapa.

Robbers infest that kingdom in which confusion prevails, and all good men regard the ruler to be a Mlechha. Their oxen do not thrive, nor their children. Their pots (of milk) are not churned, and no sacrifices are performed there. The children do not study the Vedas in kingdoms where Brahmanas abandon Kshattriyas. In their houses wealth does not increase. Their children do not become good and do not study the scriptures and perform sacrifices. Those Kshattriyas that abandon Brahmanas become impure in blood and assume the nature of robbers. The Brahmana and the Kshattriya are connected with each other naturally, and each protects the other. The Kshattriya is the cause of the Brahmana's growth and the Brahmana is the cause of the Kshattri- ya's growth. When each helps the other, both attain to great prosperity. If their friendship, existing from days of old, breaks, a confusion sets over everything. No person desirous of crossing the ocean of life succeeds in his task even as a small boat floating on the bosom of the sea. The four orders of men become confounded and destruction over- takes all. If the Brahmana who is like a tree is protected, it then showers gold and honey. If, on the other hand, it is not protected, it then showers tears and sin. When Brahmanas fall away from the Vedas and (in the absence of a Kshattriya ruler) seek protection from the scriptures, then Indra does not pour rain seasonably and diverse kinds of calamities ceaselessly afflict the kingdom. When a sinful wretch having slain a woman or a Brahmana does not incur obloquy in assemblies of fellowmen and has not to stand in fear of the king, then danger threatens the Kshattriya ruler. In consequence of the sins per- petrated by sinful men, the god Rudra appears in the kingdom. Indeed, the sinful by their sins bring upon them that god of vengeance. He then destroys all, the honest and the wicked alike (without making any distinction). 1 'Aila said, Whence does Rudra spring ? What also is his form! Creatures are seen to be destroyed by creatures. Tell me all this, O Kasyapa ! Whence does the god Rudra spring ? 1 'Kasyapa said, Rudra exists in the hearts of men. He destroys the bodies themselves in which he dwells as also the bodies of others. Rudra has been said to be like atmospheric visitations and his form is like that of the wind-gods. 1 'Aila said, The Wind does not, by blowing, visibly destroy men on all occasions, nor does the deity of the clouds do so by pouring rain.

Indeed, why should they obtain from wicked acts ? 1 'Kasyapa said, By avoiding all connection with the sinful, one becomes pure and stainless. In consequence, however, of their being mixed with the sinful, the sinless are overtaken by chastisement. Wood that is wet, if mixed with wood that is dry, is consumed by fire in consequence of such co-existence. This sinless, therefore, should never mingle with the sinful. 11 'Aila said, The Earth holds the honest and the wicked. The sun warms the honest and the wicked. The wind blows equally for them. Water cleanses them equally ! 1 'Kasyapa said, Such, indeed, is the course of this world, O prince ! It is not so, however, hereafter. In the other world, there is great differences of condition between the person that acts right- eously and him that acts sinfully. The regions that meritorious men acquire are full of honey and possessed of the splendour of gold or of a fire upon which clarified butter has been poured. Those regions also are likened to the navel of ambrosia. The meritorious peison enjoys great felicity there. Death, decrepitude, and sorrow, are not there. The region for the sinful is hell. Darkness and ceaseless pain are there, and it is full of sorrow. Sinking in infamy, the man of sinful deeds indulges in regret there for many years. In consequence of a disunion between Brahmanas and Kshattriyas, unbearable griefs afflict the people. Knowing this, a king should appoint a (Brahmana) priest possessed of experience and wide knowledge. A king should first install the priest in his office, and then cause his own coronation. This has been laid down in the ordinance. The ordinances declare that the Brahmana is the foremost of all creatures. Men acquainted with the Vedas say that the Brahmana was created first. In consequence of the precedence of his birth, all things that are good in this world are vested in him. The rightful owner of all the best things that have flowed from the Creator, the Brahmana is also, for such precedence, worthy of the respect and the worship of all creatures. A king, however, powerful, should, according to the dictates of the scriptures, bestow upon the Brahmana whatever is best and distinguished above others- The Brahmana contributes to the aggrandisement of the Kshatriya, and the Kshatriya to the aggrandisement of the Brahmana. Brahmanas should, therefore, be especially and always worshipped by kings.

In this connection is cited the old narrative of the discourse between king Muchukunda and Vaisravana. King Muchukunda, having subju- gated the whole Earth, repaired to the lord of Alaka for testing his strength. King Vaisravana created (by ascetic power) a large force of Rakshasas. These grinded the forces led by Muchukunda. Beholding the slaughter of his army, king Muchukunda, O chastiser of foes, began to rebuke his own learned priest (Vasishtha). Thereupon that fore- most of righteous persons, viz., Vasishtha, underwent very severe penances and, causing those Rakshasas to be slain, ascertained the true course upon which Muchukunda was bent. When king Vaisravana's troops were being slaughtered, he showed himself unto Muchukunda and said these words. \"The Lord of treasures said, Many kings of old, more powerful than thou art, aided by their priests, had never approached me thus. All of them were skilled in weapons and all of them were possessed of might. Regarding me as the grantor of weal and woe, they approached me for offering worship. In truth, if thou hast might of arms, it behoves thee to display it. Why dost thou act so proudly, aided by Brahmana might ? Enraged at these words, Muchukunda, without pride and fear, said unto the Lord of treasures these words fraught with reason and justice. The Self-born Brahman created the Brahmana and the Kshattriya. They have a common origin. If they apply their forces separately, they would never be able to uphold the world. The power of penances and mantras was bestowed upon Brahmanas j the might of arm and of weapons was bestowed upon Kshattriyas.

He should exterminate robbers everywhere in his kingdom and never pardon any one from caprice. The king, O Bharata, earns a fourth part of the merit that his subjects earn under his protection. By only protecting his subjects the king acquires a fourth part of the merit that his subjects acquire by study, by gifts, by pouring libations, and by worshipping the gods. The king acquires a fourth part of also the sin that his subjects commit in consequence of any distress in the kingdom arising from the king's neglect in dis- charging the duty of protection. Some say that the king earns a moiety, and some say the full measure, of whatever sin is caused by his becoming cruel and untruthful in speech. Listen now to the means by which the king may be cleansed of such sins. If the king fails to restore to a subject the wealth that has been stolen away by thieves, he should then compensate the injured from his own treasury, or, in case of inability, with wealth obtained from his dependents. All the orders should protect the wealth of a Brahmana even as they should the Brahmana's boy or life. The person that offends against Brahmanas should be exiled from the kingdom.

I bow to them and blessed be they that thus lay down their lives in seeking to chastise the enemies of Brahmanas. Let us attain to that region which is intended for them. Manu himself has said that those heroes repair to the region of Brahman. As persons be- come cleansed of all their sins by undergoing the final bath on a horse- sacrifice even so they that die at the edge of weapons while fighting wicked people, become cleansed of their sins. Righteousness becomes unrighteousness, and unrighteousness becomes righteousness, according to place and time. Such is the power of place and time (in determining the character of human acts). The friends of humanity, dy doing even acts of cruelty, have attained to high heaven. Righteous Kshattriyas, by doing even sinful acts, have attained to blessed ends. 1 The Brahmana, by taking up arms on these three occasions, does not incur sin, viz., for protecting himself, for compelling the other orders to betake themselves to their duties, and for chastising robbers !' \"Yudhishthira said, 4 If when robbers raise their heads and an inter-mixture of the orders begins to take place in consequence of con- fusion, and Kshattriyas become incompetent, some powerful person 1 The allusion is to such men as Utanka and Parasara, who although they performed such cruel acts as the snake-sacrifice and the Eakshasa sacrifice, were none-the-less entitled to heaven.

It seems that other, when the Kshattri- yas prove so wretched, should take up weapons.' \"Bhishma said, 'Be he a Sudra or be he the member of any other order, he that becomes a raft on a raftless current, or a means of cross- ing where means there are none, certainly deserves respect in every way- That person, O king, relying upon whom helpless men, oppressed and made miserable by robbers, live happily, deserves to be lovingly worshipped by all as if he were a near kinsman. The person, O thou of Kuru's race, that dispels the fears of others, always deserves respect. What use is there of bulls that would not bear burthens, or of kine that would not yield milk, or of a wife that is barren ? Similarly, what need is there for a king that is not competent to grant protection ? As an elephant made of wood, or a deer made of leather, as a person with- out wealth, or one that is a eunuch, or a field that is sterile, even so is a Brahmana that is void of Vedic lore and a king incapable of granting protection. Both of them are like a cloud that does not pour rain. That person who always protects the good and restrains the wicked deserves to become a king and to govern the world.'

They should be devotedly loyal and utter agreeable speeches in addressing kings. They should also be friendly towards one another, and cast equal eyes on all. They should be devoid of cruelty, and truthful in speech. They should never be usurers, and should always be simple and sincere.

There is no ordinance, however, which lays down that so much should be given. This ordinance (about the gift of Z)aJcshma)has not proceeded from motives connected with the distribu- tion of wealth. The command of the ordinance, in consequence of the provision in cases of incapacity, is terrible. That command is blind to the competence to the sacrificer. 1 The audition occurs in the Vedas that a person should, with devotion, perform a sacrifice. But what can devotion do when the sacrificer is stained by false-hood ?' 2 \"Bhishma said, \"No man acquires blessedness or merit by dis- regarding the Vedas or by deceit or falsehood. Never think that it is otherwise. Dakshina constitutes one of the limbs of sacrifice and con duces to the nourishment of the Vedas. A sacrifice without Dakshina can never lead to salvation. The efficacy, however, of a single Purnapatra is equal to that of any Dakshina however rich. Therefore, O sire, everyone belonging to the three orders should perform sacrifices. 3 The Vedas have settled that Soma is as the king himself to the Brahmanas. Yet they desire to sell it for the sake of performing sacrifices, though they never wish to sell it for gaining a livelihood. Rishis of righteous behaviour have declared, agreeably to the dictates of morality, that a sacrifice performed with the proceeds of the sale of Soma serves to extend sacrifices. 4 These three, viz-, a person, a sacrifice and Soma, must be of good character. A person that is of bad character is neither for this nor for the other world. This audition has been heard by us that the sacrifice which high-souled Brahmanas perform by wealth earned by excessive physical labour, is not productive of great merit. There is a declaration in the Vedas that penances are higher than sacrifices. I shall now speak to thee of penances. O learned prince, listen to me ! Abstention from injury, truthfulness of speech, benevolence, compassion, these are regarded as penances by the wise 1 Idam sastram Pratidhanam na is thus explained by Nilakantha. In cases of incapacity, again, to give the prescribed Dakshina, the sacrificer is directed to give away all he has. This direction or command is certainly terrible, for who can make up his mind to part with all his wealth for completing a sacrifice ? T. 2 The falsehood consists in finding substitutes for the Dakshina actually laid down. They are morsels of cooked food for a living cow, a grain of barley for a piece of cloth ; a copper coin for gold ; &c. T. 3 The fact is that although the sacrificer may not be able to give the Dakthina actually laid down in the Vedas, yet by giving its substitute he does not lose any merit, for a single Purnapatra (256 handfuls of rice) is as efficacious if given away with devotion, as the richest Dakshina.

What then need be said of the king (who has to govern a kingdom) ? What should be the behaviour and what the acts of the king's minister ? Upon whom should the king repose confidence and upon whom he should not.' \"Bhishma said, 'Kings, O monarch, have four kinds of friends. They are he that has the same object, he that is devoted, he that is related by birth, and he that has been won over (by gifts and kindness). A person of righteous soul, who would serve one and not both sides, is the fifth in the enumeration of the king's friends. Such a person adopts that side on which righteousness is, and accordingly acts righteously. With respect to such a person, the king should never disclose such pur- poses of his as would not enlist his sympathy. Kings desirous of success are obliged to adopt both kinds of paths, righteous and unrighteous. Of the four kinds of friends, the second and the third are superior, while the first and the fourth should ever be regarded with suspicion. In view, however, of those acts which the king should do in person, he should always regard with suspicion all the four. The king should never act heedlessly in the matter of watching his friends. A king that is heedless is always overpowered by others. A wicked man assumes the garb of honesty, and he that is honest becomes otherwise. A foe may become a friend and a friend may become a foe. A man cannot always be of the same mind. Who is there that would trust him completely ? All the chief acts, therefore, of a king he should accomplish in his own presence. A complete reliance (on his ministers) is destructive of both morality and profit. A want of trust again in respect of all is worse than death. Trustfulness is premature death. One incurs danger by truthfulness. If one trusts another completely, he is said to live by the sufferance of the trusted person. For this reason every one should be trusted as also mistrusted.

He whose fall would be brought about by thy fall, should be trusted by thee completely even as thou shouldst trust thy sire. Thou shouldst, to the best of thy power, aggrandise him as thou winnest aggrandisement for thyself. One who, in even thy religious rites, seeks to rescue thee from harm, would seek to rescue thee from harm's way in every other business. Such a one should be regarded as thy best friend. They, on the other hand, that wish one harm are one's foes. That friend is said to be like thy own self who is inspired with fear when calamity overtakes thee and with joy when prosperity shines on thee. A person possessed of beauty, fair complexion, excellent voice, liberality, benevolence, and good birth, cannot be such a friend. That person who is possessed of intelligence and memory, who is clever in the transaction of business, who is naturally averse from cruelty, who never indulges in wrath, and who. whether regarded or disregard- ed is never dissatisfied, be he thy priest or preceptor or honoured friend should always receive thy worship if he accepts the office of thy coun- seller and resides in thy abode.

Thou canst not take back that wealth, even as one cannot swallow again the food that he has vomited himself. The kingdom cannot be taken back from Babhru and Ugrasena (unto whom it has been given). Thyself, O Krishna, cannot, in particular, take it back (from them) from fear of producing intestine dissensions.

They that have been won over with gifts of wealth, honours, regardful receptions, and means of procuring felicity, and who on that account may be regarded by thee as persons inclined to benefit thee in all thy affairs, should always be made shares of thy happiness. They that are unchangeable in conduct, possessed of learn- ing and good behaviour, observant of excellent vows, large-hearted, and truthful in speech, will always be attentive to thy affairs and will never abandon thee. They, on the other hand, that are disrespectable, that are not observant of restraints, that are of wicked souls, and that have fallen away from good practices, should always be compelled by thee to observe all wholesome restraints. When the question is which of two sides should be adopted, thou shouldst not abandon the many for adopting the side of one. When, however, that one person trans- cends the many in consequence of the possession of many accomplish- ments, then thou shouldst, for that one, abandon the many. These are regarded as marks of superiority, viz. prowess, devotion to pursuits that bring fame, and observance of wholesome restraints. He, again, that honours all persons possessed of ability, that never indulges in feelings of rivalry with persons possessed of no merit, that never abandons righteousness from lust or fear or wrath or covetousness, that is adorn- ed with humility, that is truthful in speech and forgiving in temper, that has his soul under control, that has a sense of dignity, and that has been tried in every situation, should be employed by thee as thy counselled High descent, purity of blood, forgiveness, cleverness, and purity of soul, bravery, gratefulness, and truth, are, Oson of Pritha marks of superiority and goodness. A wise man who conducts himself in this way, 2 succeeds in disarming his very foes of their hostility and converting them into friends. A king that has his soul under restraint, that is possessed of wisdom, and that is desirous of prosperity, should carefully examine the merits and demerits of his ministers. A king desirous of prosperity and of shining in the midst of his contempora- ries, should have for ministers persons connected with his trusted friends, possessed of high birth, born in his own kingdom, incapable of being corrupted, unstained by adultery and similar vices, well tested, belonging to good families, possessed of learning, sprung from sires and grandsires that held similar offices, and adorned with humility.

Men that are wise in speech, that are possessed of heroism, that are full of resources under difficulties, that are of high birth, that are truthful, that can read signs, that are free from cruelty, that are con- versant with the requirements of place and time, and that desire the good of their masters, should be employed by the king as his ministers in all affairs of the kingdom. One who is bereft of energy and who has been abandoned by friends can never work with perseverance. Such a man, if employed, fails in almost every business. A minister possessed of little learning, even if blessed with high birth and attentive to virtue, profit, and pleasure, becomes incompetent in choosing proper courses of action. Similarly, a person of low descent, even if possessed of great learning, always errs, like a blind man without a guide, in all acts requiring dexterity and foresight. A person, again, who is of infirm purposes, even is possessed of intelligence and learning, and even if conversant with means, cannot long act with success. A man of wicked heart and possessed of no learning may set his hand to work but he fails to ascertain what the results will be of his work. A king should never repose trust on a minister that is not devoted to him. He should, therefore, never disclose his counsels to a minister that is not devoted to him- Such a wicked minister, combining with the other ministers of the king, may ruin his master, like a fire consuming a tree by entering its entrails through the holes in its body with the aid of the wind. Giving way to wrath, a master may one day pull down a servant from his office or reprove him, from rage, in harsh words, and restore him to power again. None but a servant devoted to the master can bear and forgive such treatment. Ministers also become some- times highly offended with their royal masters. That one, however, amongst them, who subdues his wrath from desire of doing good to his master, that person who is a sharer with the king of his weal and woe, should be consulted by the king in all his affairs. A person who is of crooked heart, even if he be devoted to his master and possessed of wisdom and adorned with numerous virtues, should never be consulted by the king. One who is allied with foes and who does not regard the interests of the king's subjects, should be known as an enemy. The king should never consult with him.

A person whose sire was unjustly banished by royal edict should not be consulted by the king even if the king may have subsequently bestowed honours upon him and assigned to him the means of sustenance. A well-wisher whose property was once confiscated for a slight trans- gression, even if he be possessed of every accomplishment should, not still be consulted by the king. A person possessed of wisdom, intelli- gence, and learning, who is born within the kingdom, who is pure and righteous in all his acts, deserves to be consulted by the king. One who is endued with knowledge and wisdom, who is acquainted with the dispositions of his friends and foes, who is such a friend of the king as to be his second self, deserves to be consulted. One who is truthful in speech and modest and mild, and who is a hereditary servant of the king, deserves to be consulted. One who is contented and honoured, who is truthful and dignified, who hates wickedness and wicked men, who is conversant with policy and the requirements of time, and who is courageous, deserves to be consulted by the king. One who is com- petent to win over all men by conciliation should be consulted, O monarch, by the king that is desirous of ruling according to the dictates of the science of chastisement. One upon whom the inhabitants of both the capital and the provinces repose confidence for his righteous conduct, who is competent to fight and conversant with the rules of policy, deserves to be consulted by the king. Therefore, men possessed of such qualities, men conversant with the dispositions of all and desirous of achieving high acts, should be honoured by the king and made his ministers. Their number also should not be less than three. 1 Ministers should be employed in observing the laches of their masters, of themselves, of the subjects, and of the foes of their master. The kingdom has its root in the counsels of policy that flow from ministers, and its growth proceeds from the same source. Ministers should act in such a way that the enemies of their master may not be able to detect his laches. On the other hand, when their laches become visible, they should then be assailed. Like the tortoise protecting its limbs by withdrawing them within its shell, ministers should protect their own counsels. They should, even thus, conceal their own laches. Those ministers of a kingdom that succeed in concealing their counsels are said to be possessed of wisdom. Counsels constitute the armour of a king, and the limbs of his subjects and officers. A kingdom is said to have its roots in spies and secret agents, and its strength is said to lie in counsels of policy. If masters and ministers follow each other for deriving support from each other, subduing pride and wrath, and vanity and envy, they may then both become happy.

Ascertaining well, in the first instance, the different opinions of the three amongst them whom he has consulted, t he king should, for subsequent deliberation, repair to his preceptor for informing him of those opinions and his own. His preceptor should be a Brahmana well versed in all matters of virtue, profit, and pleasure. Repairing, for such subsequent deliberation, to him, the king should, with collected mind, ask his opinion. When a decision is arrived at after deliberation with him, the king should then, without attachment, carry it out into practice. They that are conversant with the conclusions of the science of consultation say that kings should always hold consultation in this way. Having settled counsels in this way, they should then be reduced to practice, for then they will be able to win over all the subjects- There should be DO dwarfs, no hump-backed persons, no one of an emaciated constitution, no one who is lame or blind, no one who is an idiot, no woman, and no eunuch, at the spot where the king holds his consultations. Nothing should move there before or behind, above or below, or in transverse directions. Getting up on a boat, or repairing to an open space destitute of grass or grassy bushes and whence the surrounding land may be clearly seen, the king should hold consulta- tions at the proper time, avoiding faults of speech and gestures.' ' SECTION LXXXIV \"Bhishma said, 'In this connection, O Yudhishthira, the old account of a conversation between Vrihaspati and Sakra is cited. tk 'Sakra said, What is that one act, O regenerate one, by accom- plishing which with care, a person may become the object of regard with all creatures and acquire great celebrity ? ' 'Vrihaspati said, Agreeableness of speech, O Sakra, is the one thing by practising which a person may become an object of regard with all creatures and acquire great celebrity. This is the one thing, O Sakra, which gives happiness to all. By practising it, one may always obtain the love of all creatures. The person who does not speak a word and whose face is always furrowed with frowns, becomes an object of hatred with all creatures. Abstention from agreeable speeches makes him so. That person who, upon beholding others, addresses them first and does so with smiles succeeds in making every one gratified with him. Even gifts, if not made with agreeable speeches, do not delight the recipients, like rice without curry. If even the possessions of men, O Sakra, be taken away with sweet speeches, such sweetness of behavi- our succeeds in reconciling the robbed. A king, therefore, that is desirous of even inflicting chastisement should utter sweet words. Sweetness of speech never fails of purpose, while, at the same time it never pains any heart. A person of good acts and good, agreeable, and sweet speeches, has no equal. ' \" 'Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by his priest, Sakra began to act according to those instructions. Do thon also, O son of Kunti, practise this virtue !'\""},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"SECTION LXXXV \"Yudhishthira said, 'O foremost of kings, what is that method by which a king ruling his subjects may, in consequence of it, obtain great blessedness and eternal fame ?' \"Bhishma said, 'A king of cleansed soul and attentive to the duty of protecting his subjects earns merit and fame, both here and hereafter, by conducting himself righteously.' \"Yudhishthira said, 'With whom should the king behave in what way ? Asked by me, O thou of great wisdom, it behoveth thee to tell me everything duly ! Those virtues of which thou hast already spoken with respect to a person, cannot, it is my belief, be found to exist in any single individual.' \"Bhishma said, Thou art endued with great intelligence, O Yudhishthira ! It is even so as thou sayest. The person is very rare who is possessed of all those good qualities. To be brief, conduct like this (viz-, the presence of all the virtues spoken of,) is very difficult to ba met with even upon careful search. I shall, however, tell thee what kinds of ministers should be appointed by thee. Four Brahmanas, learned in the Vedas, possessed of a sense of dignity, belonging to the Sanataka order, and of pure behaviour, and eight Kshattriyas, all of whom should be possessed of physical strength and capable of wielding weapons, and one and twenty Vaisyas, all of whom should be possessed of wealth, and three Sudras, every one of whom should be humble and of pure conduct and devoted to his daily duties, and one man of the Suti caste, possessed of a knowledge of the Puranas and the eight cardi- nal virtues, should be thy ministers. Every one of them should be fifty years of age, possessed of a sense of dignity, free from envy, conver- sant with the Srutis and the Smria's, humble, impartial, competent to readily decide in the midst of disputants urging different courses of action, free from covetousness, and frcm the seven dreadful vices called Vyasanas. The king should consult with those eight ministers and hold the lead among them. He should then publish in his kingdom, for the information of his subjects, the results of such deliberation. Thou shouldst always, adopting such a conduct, watch over thy people. Thou shouldst never confiscate what is deposited with thee or appro- priate as thine the thing about whose ownership two persons may dispute. Conduct such as this would spoil the administration of justice. If the administration of justice be thus injured, sin will afflict thee, and afflict thy kingdom as well, and inspire thy people with fear as little birds at the sight of the hawk. Thy kingdom will then melt away like a boat wrecked on the sea. If a king governs his subjects with un- righteousness, fear takes possession of his heart and the door of heaven is closed against him. A kingdom, O bull among men, has its root in"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"SANTI PARVA 196 righteousness. That minister, or king's son, who acts unrighteously, occupying the seat of justice, and those officers who having accepted the charge of affairs, act unjustly, moved by self-interest, all sink in hell along with the king himself. Those helpless men who are oppressed by the powerful and who indulge on that account in piteous and copious lamentations, have their protector in the king. In cases of dispute between two parties the decision should be based upon the evidence of witnesses. If one of the disputants has no witnesses and is helpless, the king should give the case his best consideration. The king should cause chastisement to be meted out to offenders according to the measure of their offences. They that are wealthy should be punished with fines and confiscations ; they that are poor, with loss of liberty. Those that are of very wicked conduct should be chastised by the king with even corporal inflictions. The king should cherish all good men with agreeable speeches and gifts of wealth. He who seeks to compass the death of the king should be punished with death to be effected by diverse means. The same should be the punishment of one who becomes guilty of arson or theft or such co-habitation with women as may lead to a confusion of castes. A king, O monarch, who inflicts punishments duly and conformably to the dictates of the science of chastisement, incurs no sin by the act. On the other hand, he earns merit that is eternal. That foolish king who inflicts punishments capriciously, earns infamy here and sinks into hell hereafter. One should not be punished for the fault of another. Reflecting well upon the (criminal) code, a person should be convicted or acquitted. A king should never slay an envoy under any circumstances. That king who slays an envoy sinks into hell with all his ministers. That king obser- vant of Kshattriya practices who slays an envoy that faithfully utters the message with which he is charged, causes the manes of his deceased ancestors to be stained with the sin of killing a foetus. An envoy should possess these seven accomplishments, viz. t he should be high-born, of a good family, eloquent, clever, sweet-speeched, faithful in delivering the message with which he is charged, and endued with a good memory. The aid-de-camp of the king that protects his person should be endued with similar qualities. The officer also that guards his capital or citadel should possess the same accomplishments. The king's minister should be conversant with the conclusions of the scriptures and competent in directing wars and 'making treaties. He should, further, be intelligent, possessed of courage, modest, and capable of keeping secrets. He should also be of high birth endued with strength cf mind, and pure in conduct. If possessed of these qualities, he should be regarded worthy. The commander of the king's forces should be possessed of similar accomplishments.

He should protect his subjects, never doing anything that may obstruct or thwart righteous- ness. He should always maintain and protect the helpless, the masterless, and the old, and women that are widows. The king should always honour the ascetics and make unto them gifts, at proper seasons of cloths and vessels and food. The king should, with attentive care, inform the ascetics (within his dominions) of the state of his own self, of all his measures, and of the kingdom, and should always behave with humility in their presence- When he sees ascetics of high birth and great learning that have abandoned all earthly objects, he should honour them with gifts of beds and seats and food.

Such a village, so assigned to a lord of a hundred villages, should be, however, within the control of the lord of a thousand villages. That high officer, again, viz. % the lord of a thousand villages, should have a minor town for his support. He should enjoy the grain and gold and other possessions derivable from it. He should perform all the duties of its wars and other internal affairs pertaining to it. Some virtuous minister, with wrathfulness, should exercise supervision over the administration affairs and mutual relations of those officers. In every town, again, there should be an officer for attending to every matter relating to his jurisdiction. Like some planet of dreadful form moving above all the asterisms below, the officer (with plenary powers) mentioned last should move and act above all the officers subordinate to him. Such an officer should ascertain the conduct of those under him through his spies. Such high officers should protect the people from all persons of murderous disposition, all men of wicked deeds, all who rob the wealth of other people, and all who are full of deceit, and all of whom are regarded to be possessed by the devil. Taking note of the sales and the purchases, the state of the roads, the food and dress, and the stocks and profits, of those that are engaged in trade, the king should levy taxes on them. Ascertaining on all occasions the extent of the manufactures, the receipts and expenses of those that are engaged in them, and the state of the arts, the king should levy taxes upon the artisans in respect of the arts they follow. The king, O Yudhishthira, may take high taxes, but he should never levy such taxes as would emasculate his people. No tax should be levied without ascertaining the outturn and the amount of labour that has been neces- sary to proJuce it. Nobody would work or seek for outturns without sufficient cause. 1 The king should, after reflection, levy taxes in such a way that he and the person who labours to produce the article taxed may both share the value. The king should not, by his thirst, destroy his own foundations as also those of others. He should always avoid those acts in consequence of which he may become an object of hatred to his people. Indeed, by acting in this way he may succeed in winning popularity. The subjects hate that king who earns a notoriety for voraciousness of appetite (in the matter of taxes and imposts). Whence can a king who becomes an object of hatred have prosperity ? Such a king can never acquire what is for his good. A king who is possessed of sound intelligence should milk his kingdom after the analogy of ( men 1 The sense seems to bo that if a sufficient margin of profit, capable of maintaining one at ease, be not left, one would refrain absolutely from work.

Chastising all robbers that infest the outskirts, the king should protect the people of his villages and make them happy. The subjects, in that case, becoming sharers of the king's weal and woe, feel exceedingly gratified with him. Think- ing, in the first instance, of collecting wealth, the king should repair to the chief centres of his kingdom one after another and endeavour to inspire his paople with fright. He should say unto them, Here, cala- mity threatens us. A great danger has arisen inconsequence of the acts of the foe ! There is every reason, however, to hope that the danger will pass away, for the enemy, like a bamboo that has flowered, will very soon meet with destruction. Many foes of mine, having risen up and combined with a large number of robbers, desire to put our kingdom into difficulties, for meeting with destruction themselves. In view of this great calamity fraught with dreadful danger, I solicit your wealth for devising the means of your protection. When the danger passes away, I will give you what I now take. Our foes, however, will not give back what they (if unopposed) will take from you by force.

If the king acts righteously, he attains to the position of a god.* On the other hand, if he acts unrighteously, he sinks into hell, All creatures rest upon righteousness. Righteousness, in its turn, rests upon the king. That king, therefore, who upholds righteousness, is truly a king. That king who is endued with a righteous soul and with every kind of grace is said to bean embodiment of virtue. If a king fails to chastise un- righteousness, the gods desert his mansion and he incurs obloquy amortg men. The efforts of men who are observant of their own duties are always crowned with success. For this reason all men seek to obey the dictates of righteousness which are productive of prosperity. When sinfulness is not restrained, righteous behaviour comes to an end and unrighteous increases greatly. When sinfulness is not restrained, no one can, according to the rights of property as laid down in the scrip- tures, say This thing is mine and this is not mine. When sinfulness prevails in the world, men cannot own and enjoy their own wives and animals and fields and houses. The deities receive no worship, the Pitris no offerings in Sraddhas, and guests no hospitality, when sinfulness is not'restrained. The regenerate classes do not study the Vedas, or observe high vows, or spread out sacrifices, when sinfulness is not restrained- The minds of men, O king, become weak and confounded like those of persons wounded with weapons, when sinfulness is not restrained. Casting their eyes on both the worlds, the Rishis made the king, that superior being, intending that he should be the embodiment of righteousness on Earth. 2 He is called Rajan in whom righteousness shines. That king, again in whom there is no righteousness, is called a Vrishala.* The divine Dharma (Righteousness) has another name, viz,, Vrisha.

Righteousness, therefore, should never be permitted to decay. Right- eousness is called Dharma because it aids the acquisition and preserva- tion of wealth (Dhana). The sages, O king, have declared that Dliarma restrains and set bounds to all evil acts of men. The Self-born (Brahman) created Dharma for the advancement and growth of creatures. For this reason, a king should act according to the dictates of Dharma for benefiting his subjects* For this reason also, O tiger among kings, Dharma has been said to be the foremost of all things. That foremost of men who rules his subjects righteously is called a king. Disregarding lust and wrath, observe thou the dictates of righteousness. Among all things, O chief of Bharata's race, that conduce to the prosperity of kings, righteousness is the foremost. Dharma, again, has spring from the Brahmana. For this reason, the Brahmana should always be worshipped. Thou shouldst, O Mandhatri, gratify with humility the wishes of Brahmanas. By neglecting to gratify the wishes of Brahmanas, the king brings danger on himself. In consequence of such neglect, he fails to obtain any accession of friends while his foes increase in number. *In consequence of malice towards the Brahmanas springing from his folly, the goddess of prosperity who had formerly dwelt with him became enraged and deserted the Asuras Vali the son of Virochana. Deserting the Asura she repaired to Indra the chief of the deities. Beholding the goddess living with Purandara, Vali indulged in many vain regrets. This, O puissant one, is the results of malice and pride. Be thou awakened, O Mandhatri, so that the goddess of prosperity may not in wrath desert thee ! The Srutis delare that Un- righteousness begat a son named Pride upon the goddess of prosperity. This Pride, O king, led many among the gods and the Asuras to ruin. Many royal sages also have suffered destruction on his account. Do thou, therefore, awaken, O king ! He who succeeds in conquering him becomes a king. He, on the other hand, who suffers himself to be con- quered by him, becomes a slave.

Therefore, the king should take particular care to act righteously, for the benefit of his subjects. If a king acts heedlessly, a great evil becomes the consequence. Unrighteousness increases, causing a confusion of castes. Cold sets in during the summer months, and disappears when its proper season comes. Drought and flood and pesti- lence afflict the people.

Elephants and steeds and kine and camels and mules and asses and other animals all lose their vigour when the king becomes unrighteous. It is said, O Mandhatri, that the Creator created Power (represented by the king) for the object of protecting Weakness. Weakness is, indeed, a great being, for everything depends upon it. 1 All creatures worship the king. All creatures are the children of the king. If, there- fore, O monarch, the king becomes unrighteous, all creatures come to grief. The eyes of the weak, of the Muni, and of the snake of virulent poison, should be regarded as unbearable. Do not, therefore, come into (hostile) contact with the weak. Thou shouldst regard the weak as always subject to humiliation. Take care that the eyes of the Weak do not burn thee with thy kinsmen. In a race scorched by the eyes of the weak, no children take birth. Such eyes burn the race to its very roots. Do not, therefore, come into (hostile) contact with the weak ! Weakness is more powerful than even the greatest Power, for that Power which is scorched by Weakness becomes totally exterminated. If a person, who has been humiliated or struck, fails, while shrieking for assistance, to obtain a protector, divine chastisement overtakes the king and brings about his destruction. Do not, O sire, while in enjoy- ment of Power, take wealth from those that are Weak. Take care that that the eyes of the Weak do not burn thee like a blazing fire !

When a weak person fails to find a rescuer, the great rod of divine chastisement falls (upon the king). When all subjects of a king (are obliged by distress to) live like Brahmanas, by mendicancy, such mendicancy brings destruction upon the king. When all the officers of the king posted in the provinces unite together and act with injustice, the king is then said to bring about a state of un- mixed evil upon his kingdom. When the officers of the king extort wealth, by unjust means or acting from lust or avarice, from persons piteously soliciting for mercy, a great destruction then is sure to over- take the king. A mighty tree, first starting into life, grows into large proportions. Numerous creatures then come and seek its shelter 1 He who protects Weakness wins heaven, while he who persecutes it goes to hell. Weakness, thus, is a great thing.

When, on the other hand, the residents, moved by ignorance, abandon righteousness and act unrighteously, the king becomes overtaken by misery. When sinful men whose acts are known are allowed to move among the righteous (without being punished for their misdeeds), Kali then overtakes the rulers of those realms. 2 When the king causes chastisement to overtake all wicked people, his king- dom thrives in prosperity.

The enjoyment of good things after sharing them with others, paying proper honours to the ministers, and subjugation of persons intoxicated with strength, are said to constitute the great duty of a king. Protecting all men by words, body, and deeds, and never forgiving his son himself (if he has offended), constitute the great duty of the king.

Devoted to virtue, that king who seeks the acquisition of virtue and wealth by such means, and who begins all his measures after reflecting upon their objects, succeeds in obtaining great prosperity. That king who is illiberal, and without affection, who afflicts his subjects by undue chastisements, and who is rash in his acts, soon meets with destruction. That king who is not gifted with intelligence fails to see his own faults. Covered with infamy here, he sinks into hell hereafter. If the king gives proper honour to them that deserve it, makes gifts, and recognises the value of sweet speeches by himself uttering them on all occasions, his subjects then dispel the calamities that overtake him, as if these had fallen upon themselves. That king who has no instructor in the ways of righteous- ness and who never asks others for counsels, and who seeks to acquire wealth by means that caprice suggests, never succeeds in enjoying happiness long. That king, on the other hand, who listens to the instructions of his preceptors in matters connected with virtue, who supervises the affairs of his kingdom himself, and who in all his acquisi- tions is guided by considerations of virtue, succeed in enjoying happi- ness for a long time. ' ' SECTION XCIII 'Vamadeva continued, When the king, who is powerful, acts unrighteously towards the weak, they who take their birth in his race imitate the same conduct. Others, again, imitate that wretch who sets sin agoing. Such imitation of the man ungoverned by restraints soon brings destruction upon the kingdom. The conduct of a king who is observant of his proper duties, is accepted by men in general as a model for imitation. The conduct, however, of a king who falls away from his duties, is not tolerated by his very kinsfolk. 1 That rash king who, disregarding the injunctions laid down in the scriptures, acts with high-handedness in his kingdom, very soon meets with destruction. That Kshattriya who does not follow the conduct observed from days of old by other Kshattriyas conquered or unconquered, is said to fall away from Kshattriya duties. Having seized in battle a royal foe that did some good to the conqueror on a former occasion, that king who does not, actuated by malice, pay him honours, is said to fall away from Kshattriya duties. The king should display his power, live cheerfully, and do what is necessary in seasons of danger. Such a ruler becomes the beloved of all creatures and never falls away from prosperity.

One who is not loved becomes an object of love, if he- does what is agreeable. Untruthful speeches should be avoided. Thou shouldst do good to others without being solicited. Thou shouldst never abandon righteousness from lust or wrath or malice. Do not give harsh answers when questioned by anybody. Do not utter undignified speeches. Never be in a hurry to do anything. Never indulge in malice. By such means is a foe won over. Do not give way to exclusive joy when anything agreeable occurs, nor suffer thyself to be over- whelmed with sorrow when anything disagreeable occurs. Never indulge in grief when thy pecuniary resources are exhausted, and always remember the duty of doing good to thy subjects. That king who always does what is agreeable by virtue of his disposition achieves success in all his measures and is never shorn of prosperity. The king should always, with heedfulness, cherish that devoted servant who abstains from doing what is injurious to his master and who always does what is for his good. He should appoint in all great affairs persons that have subjugated their senses, that are devotedly loyal and of pure behaviour, and that are possessed of ability. That person, who by the possession of such qualifications pleases the king and who is never heedless in taking care of the interests of his master, should be appoint- ed by the king in the affairs of his kingdom. On the other hand, the king becomes divested of prosperity by appointing to important offices men that are fools and slaves of their senses, that are covetous and of disrespectable conduct, that are deceitful and hypocritical, that are malicious, wicked-souled, and ignorant, that are low-minded, and addicted to drink, gambling, women, and hunting. That king, who, first protecting his own self , protects others that deserve protection, feels the satisfaction of finding his subjects growing in prosperity. Such a king succeeds also in obtaining greatness. A king should, by secret agents that are devoted to him, watch the conduct and acts of other kings. By such means can he obtain superiority. Having injured a powerful king, one should not comfort himself with the thought that he (the injurer) lives at a great distance from the injured. Such king when injured falls upon the injurer like the hawk swooping down upon its prey, in moments of heedlessness. A king whose power has been consolidated and who is confident of his own strength, should assail a neighbour who is weaker than himself but never one that is stronger. A king who is devoted to virtue, having acquired the sovereignty of the Earth by prowess, should protect his subjects righteously and slaughter foes in battle. Everything belonging to this world is destined to destruction. Nothing here is durable. For this reason, the king, adhering to righteousness, should protect his subjects righteously. The defence of forts, battle, administration of justice, consultations on questions of policy, and keeping the subjects in happiness, these five acts constribute to enlarge the dominions of a king. That king who"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"8ANTI PARVA 215 takes proper care of these is regarded to be the best of kings. By always attending to these, a king succeeds in protecting his kingdom. It is impossible, however, for one man to supervise all these matters at all times. Making over such supervision to his ministers, a king may govern the Earth for ever. 1 The people make such a person their king who is liberal, who shares all objects of enjoyment with others, who is possessed of a mild disposition, who is of pure behaviour, and who will never abandon his subjects. He is obeyed in the world who, having listened to counsels of wisdom, accepts them, abandoning his own opinions. That king who does not tolerate the counsels of a well-wisher inconsequence of their opposition to his own views, who listens with inattention to what is said unto him in opposition to his views, and who does not always follow the conduct of high and noble persons conquered or unconquered, is said to fall away from the duties of Kshattriyas. From ministers that have once been chastised, from women in especial, from mountains and inaccessible regions, from elephants and horses and reptiles, the king should always, with heedfulness, protect his own self. 2 That king who, abandoning his chief minister?, makes favourites of low persons, soon falls into distress, and never succeeds in compass- ing the (intended) ends of his measures. That king of infirm soul, who, yielding to the influence of wrath and malice, does not love and honour those amongst his kinsmen that are possessed of good qualities, is said to live on the very verge of destruction. That king, who attaches to him- self accomplished persons by doing good to them even though he may not like them at heart, succeeds in enjoying fame for ever. Thou shouldst never impose taxes unseasonably. Thou shouldst not be grieved at the occurrence of anything disagreeable, nor rejoice exceedingly at anything agreeable. Thou shouldst always set thyself to the accom- plishment of good acts. Who amongst the dependent king is truly devoted to thee, and who is loyal to thee from fear, and who amongst them has faults, should always be ascertained by thee. The king, even if he be powerful, should trust them that are weak, for in moments of heedlessness the weak may assail the powerful like a flock of vultures seizing their prey. A man of sinful soul seeks to injure his master even if the latter be sweet-speeched and possessed of every accomplish- ment. Do not, therefore, place thy confidence upon such men. Nahusha's son Yayati, in declaring the mysteries of king-craft, said that a person engaged in ruling men should slay even foes that arc contemptible. 1 Teshu, i.e., unto the ministers already spoken of.

Victories achieved by battles are not spoken of highly, O monarch, by the wise. When the sovereign's own power has not been confirmed, he should not seek to make new acquisitions. It is not proper that a king whose power has not been consolidated should seek to make such acquisitions. The power of that king whose dominions are wide and abound with wealth, whose subjects are loyal and contented, and who has a large number of officers, is said to be confirmed. That king whose soldiery are contented, gratified (with pay and prize), and com- petent to deceive foes, can with even a small force, subjugate the whole Earth- The power of that king whose subjects, whether belonging to the cities or the provinces, have compassion for all crea- tures, and possessed of wealth and grain, is said to be confirmed. When the king thinks that his power is greater than that of a foe, he should then, aided by his intelligence, seek to acquire the latter's territories and wealth. A king whose resources are increasing, who is compassionate unto all creatures, who never loses any time by pro- crastination, and who is careful in protecting his own self, succeeds in earning advancement. That king who behaves deceitfully towards his own people that have not been guilty of any fault, shears his own self like a person cutting down a forest with an axe. If the king does not always attend to the task of slaying his foes, the latter do not diminish. That king, again, who knows to kill his own wrath, finds no enemies. If the king be possessed of wisdom, he would never do any act that is disapproved by good men. He would, on the other hand, always engage himself in such acts as would lead to his own benefit and that of others. That king who, having accomplished all his duties, becomes happy in the approbation of his own conscience, has never to incur the reproach of others and indulge in regrets. That king who observes such conduct towards men succeeds in subjugating both the worlds and enjoy the fruits of victory.

One should fight one, and abandon the opponent when the latter becomes disabled. 2 If the enemy comes clad in mail, his opponent also should put on mail. If the enemy advances backed by an army, one should, backed by an army, challenge him to battle. If the enemy fights aided by deceit, he sbould be met with the aid of deceit. If, on the other hand, he fights fairly, he should be resisted with fair means. One should not on horse-back proceed against a car-warrior. A car-warrior should proceed against a car-warrior. When an antagonist has fallen into distress, he should not be struck ; nor should one that has been frightened, nor one that has been van- quished. 3 Neither poisoned nor barbed arrows should be used. These are the weapons of the wicked. One should fight righteously, without yielding to wrath or desiring to slay. A weak or wounded man should not be slain, or one that is sonless ; or one whose weapon has been broken ; or one that has fallen into distress ; or one whose bow-string has been cut ; or one that has lost his vehicle. A wounded opponent should either be sent to his own home, or, if brought to the victor's quarters, should have his wounds attended to by skilful surgeons. When in consequence of a quarrel between righteous kings, a righteous warrior falls into distress, (his wounds should be attended to and) when cured he should be set at liberty.

Such is the practice of those that are wicked. Even he that is wicked should be subdued by fair means. It is better to lay down life itself in the observance of righteousness than to win victory by sinful means. Like a cow, O king, perpetrated sin does not immediately produce its fruits. That sin overwhelms the perpetrator after consuming his roots and branches. A sinful person, acquiring wealth by sinful means, rejoices greatly. But the sinner, gaining advancement by sinful ways, becomes wedded to sin. Thinking that virtue has no efficacy, he jeers at men of righteous behaviour. Disbelieving in virtue, he at last meets with destruction. Though enmeshed in the noose of Varuna, he still regards himself im- mortal. Like unto a large leathern bag purled up with wind, the sinner dissociates himself entirely from virtue. Soon, however, he disappears like a tree on the river-side washed away with its very roots.

On the other hand, he should bring him to his palace and pursuade him for a whole year to say I am thy slave ! Whether he says or does not say this, the vanquished foe, by living for a year in the house of his victor, gains a new lease of life. 1 If a king succeeds in bringing by force a maiden from the house of his vanquished foe, he should keep her for a year and ask her whether she would wed him 1 The original is very elliptical; I, therefore, expand it after the manner of the commentator.

If she does not agree, she should then be sent back. He should behave similarly in respect of all other kinds of wealth (such as slave) that are acquired by force. The king should never appropriate the wealth confiscated from thieves and others awaiting execution. The kine taken from the enemy by force should be given away to the Brahmanas so that they may drink the milk of those animals. The bulls taken from the enemy should be set to agricultural work or returned to the enemy. 1 It is laid down that a king should fight one that is a king. One that is not a king should never strike one that is a king. If a Brahmana, desirous of peace, fearlessly goes between two contending armies, both should immediately abstain from fight. He would break an eternal rule that would slay or wound a Brahmana. If any Kshat- triya breaks that rule, he would become a wretch of his order- In addition to this, that Kshattriya who destroys righteousness and transgresses all wholesome barriers does not deserve to be reckoned as a Kshattriya and should be driven from society. A king desirous of obtaining victory should never follow such conduct. What gain can be greater than victory won righteously ? The excitable classes (of a kingdom recently conquered) should, without delay, be conciliated with soothing speeches and gifts. This is a good policy for the king to adopt. If instead of doing this, these men be sought to be governed with impolicy, they would then leave the kingdom and side with (the victor's) foes and wait for the accession of calamities (in order that they may then make head against the victor). Discontented men, watching for the calamities of the king, promptly side with the latter's foe's, O monarch, in times of danger. An enemy should not be deceived by unfair means. Nor should he be wounded mortally. For, if struck mortally, his very life may pass away. 2 If a king possessed of little resources be gratified therewith, he would regard life alone to be much. 3 That king whose dominions are extensive and full of wealth, whose subjects are loyal, whose servants and officers are all contented, is said to have his roots firm. That king whose Ritwijas and priests and pre- ceptors and others about him that are well-versed in all scriptures and deserving of honours are all duly respected, is said to be conversant with the ways of the world. It was by such behaviour that Indra got the sovereignty of the world. It is by this behaviour that earthly kings succeed in obtaining the status of Indra.

In such a case, equal to the nurn,ber of shafts with which he pierces the bodies of his enemies, is the number of regions that he enjoys, eternal and capable of granting every wish. The blood that flows from his body cleanses him of all his sins along with the very pain that he feels on the occasion. Persons conversant with the scriptures say that the pains a Kshattriya suffers in battle operate as penances for enhancing his merit. Righteous persons, inspired with fear, stay in the rear, soliciting life from heroes that have rushed to battle, even as men solicit rain from the clouds. If those heroes, without permitting the beseechers to incur the dangers of battle, keep them in the rear by themselves facing those dangers and defend them at that time of fear, great becomes their merit- If, again, those timid persons, appreciating that deed of bravery, always respect those defenders, they do what is proper and just. By acting otherwise they cannot free themselves from fear. There is great difference between men apparently equal. Some rush to battle, amid its terrible din, against armed ranks of foes. Indeed, the hero rushes against crowds of foes, adopting the road to heaven. He, however, who is inspired with dastardly fear, seeks safety in flight, deserting his comrades in danger.

Any unheroic act of theirs is sinful and inglorious. In disease, one may be heard to cry, saying, What sorrow ! How painful ! I must be a great sinner !

Behind the last should be placed the foot-soldiers all accoutred in mail. That king who forms his array in this manner always succeeds in vanquishing his foes. Therefore, O Yudhishthira, the array of battle should always be thus formed. Filled with wrath, heroes desire to win blessedness in heaven by fighting fairly. Like Makaras agitating the ocean, they agitate the ranks of the foe. Assuring one another, they should gladden those (amongst them) that are cheerless. The victor should protect the land newly conquered (from acts 'of aggression). He should not cause his troops to pursue too much the routed foe. The onset is irresistible of persons that rally after the rout and that t despairing of safety, assail their pursuers. For this reason, O king, thou shouldst not cause thy troops to pursue too much the routed foe. Warriors of courage do not wish to strike them that run away with speed. That is another reason why the routed foe should not be pursued hotly. Things that are immobile are devoured by those that are mobile; creatures that are toothless are devoured by those that have teeth ; water is drunk by the thirsty ; cowards are devoured by heroes. Cowards sustain defeat though they have, like the victors, similar backs and stomachs and arms and legs. They that are afflicted with fear bend their heads and joining their hands stay before those that are possessed of courage- This world rests on the arms of heroes like a son on those of his sire.

For resisting and restraining them, I shall tell thee what the contrivances are, as indicated in the scriptures. Listen to me as I speak of those means for the success of all acts. Both kinds of wisdom, .straight and crooked, should be within call of the king. Though acquainted with it, he should not, however, apply that wisdom which is crooked (for injuring others). He may use it for resisting the dangers that any overtake him. Enemies frequently injure a king by producing disunion (among his ministers or troops or allies or subjects). The king, conversant with deceit, may, by the aid of deceit, counteract those enemies. Leathern armour for protecting the bodies of elephants, armour of the same material for bovine bulls, bones, thorns, and keen-pointed weapons made of iron, coats of mail, yak-tails, sharp and well-tempered weapons, all kinds of armour yellow and red, banners and standards of diverse hues, swords, and lances and scimitars of great sharpness and battle-axes, and spears and shields, should be manufactured and stored in abundance. The weapons should all be properly whetted. The soldiers should be inspired with courage and resolution. It is proper to set the troops in motion in the month of Chaitra or Agrahayana. The crops ripen about that time and water also does not become scarce. That time of the year, O Bharata, is neither very cold nor very hot. Troops should, therefore, be moved at that time. If the enemy, however, be overtaken by distress, troops should immediately be set in motion (without waiting for such a favourable time). These (two) are the best occasions for the motion of troops with a view to subjugate foes. That road which has abundance 1 I do not understand how this is an answer to Yudhishthira's question.

Good behaviour, according to him, means encouraging the soldiers, speaking sweetly to them, and promoting the brave, &c. Means and contrivances consist in puniphing desertion and cowardliness, dc.

The regions lying near the road (on both its sides) should previously be well ascertained through spies possessed of skill and having an intimate knowledge of the woods. The troops must not, like animals, be marched through woody regions. Kings desirous of victory should, therefore, adopt good roads for marching their troops. In the van should be placed a division of brave men, endued with strength and high birth. As regards forts, that which has walls and a trench full of water on every side and only one entrance, is worthy of praise. In respect of invading foes, resistance may be offered from within it. In pitching the camp, a region lying near the woods is regarded as much better than one under the open sky by men conversant with war and possessed of military accomplishments. The camp should be pitched for the troops not far from such a wood. Pitching the camp at such a place, planting the foot-soldiers in a posi- tion of safety, and collision with the foe as soon as he comes, are the means for warding off danger and distress. Keeping the constellation called Ursa Major 1 behind them, the troops should fight taking up their stand like hills. By this means, one may vanquish even foes that are irresistible. The troops should be placed in such a position that the wind, the sun, and the planet Sukra 2 should blow and shine from behind them. As means for ensuing victory the wind is superior to the Sun, and the Sun is superior to Sukra, O Yudhishthira. Men con- versant with war approve of a region that is not miry, not watery, not uneven, and not abounding with bricks and stone, as well fitted for the operations of cavalry. A field that is free from mire and holes is fitted for car-warriors. A region that is overgrown with bushes and large trees and that is under water is fitted for elephant- warriors. A region that has many inaccessible spots, that is overgrown with large trees and topes of cane bushes, as also a mountainous or woody tract, is well fitted for the operations of infantry. An army, O Bharata, which has a large infantry force, is regarded very strong. An army in which cars and horsemen predominate is regarded to be very effective in a clear (unrainy) day. An army, again, in which footsoldiers and elephants predominate becomes effective in the rainy season.

The very marrow of embodied creatures scorched with the heat of weapons, languishes with pain. A king should, therefore, on all occasions, apply the arts of conciliation, mixing them with measures of severity. When people are afflicted by foes, they always show a disposition to come to terms. 4 Secret agents should be sent for producing disunion amongst the allies of the foe- Having produced disunion, it is very desirable that peace should then be made with that king who happens to be more powerful than the foe (sought to be crushed). If the invader does not proceed in the way, he can never succeed in completely crushing his foe. In dealing with the foe, care should be taken for hemming him in from all sides. Forgiveness always comes to those that are good. It never comes to those that are bad. Listen now, O Partha, to the uses of forgiveness and of severity.

On the other hand, one should never exhibit one's wrath of fear or joy. He should conceal these within his own bosom.

The very existence of persons of restless disposition is fraught with danger. Kings should, therefore, with close attention, ascertain their friends and foes.

Nor should mildness of behaviour be adopted towards such foes, nor repeated expedition, for loss of crops, poisoning of wells and tanks, and suspicion in respect of the seven branches of administration, should be avoided. 1 The king should, on such occasions, apply diverse kinds of deception, diverse contrivances for setting his foes against one another, and different kinds of hypocritical behaviour. He should also, through trusted agents, ascertain the doings of his foes in their cities and pro- vinces.

Some again, delighted with wealth, think that there is nothing superior to it. In his eager desire for the acquisition of wealth, such a person loses all other objects of life. If, O prince of Kosala, a person loses that wealth which had been earned with difficulty and which had been proportionate to his desires, he then, overcome by the inactivity of despair, gives up all desire of wealth. Some persons of righteous souls and high birth betake themselves to the acquisition of virtue. These renounce every kind of worldly happiness from desire of winning felicity in the other world. Some persons lay down life itself, moved by the desire of acquiring wealth. These do not think that life has any use if dissociated from wealth. Behold their pitiable condition !

Such quarrels bring about the destruction of a race and produce disunion among the (entire order of the) nobles. Protect thyself, O king, from all fears that arise from within. Fears, however, that arise from out- side are of little consequence. The first kind of fear, O king, may cut thy roots in a single day. Persons that are equal to one another in family and blood, influenced by wrath or folly or covetousness arising from their very natures, cease to speak with one another. This is an indication of defeat. It is not by courage, nor by intelligence, nor by beauty, nor by wealth, that enemies succeed in destroying the aristo- cracy. It is only by disunion and gifts that it can be reduced to subjugation. For this reason, combination has been said to be the great refuge of the aristocracy.' 1 SECTION CVIII \"Yudhishthira said, 'The path of duty is long. It has also, O Bharata, many branches. What, however, according to thee, are those duties that most deserve to be practised ? What acts, according to thee, are the most important among all duties, by the practice of which I may earn the highest merit both here and hereafter ?' \"Bhishma said, 'The worship of mother, father, and preceptor is most important according to me. The man who attends to that duty here, succeeds in acquiring great fame and many regions of felicity. Worshipped with respect by thee, whatever they will command thee, be it consistent with righteousness or inconsistent with it, should be done unhesitatingly, O Yudhishthira ! One should never do what they forbid. Without doubt, that which they command should always be done.* They are the three worlds. They are the three modes of life. They are the three Vedas. They are the three sacred fires. The father is said to be the Qarhapatya fire ; the mother, the DaksMna fire ; and the preceptor is that fire upon which libations are poured. These three fires are, of course, the most eminent. If thou attendest with heedful- ness to these three fires, thou wilt succeed in conquering the three worlds. By serving the father with regularity, one may cross this world. By serving the mother in the same way, one may attain to regions of felicity in the next.

By acting in that way, O best of kings, thou mayst obtain fame, merit, honour, and regions of felicity hereafter. He who honours these three is honoured in all the worlds. He, on the other hand, who disre- gards these three, fails to obtain any merit from any of his acts. Such a man, O scorcher of foes, acquires merit neither in this world nor in the next. He who always disregards these three seniors never obtains fame either here or hereafter. Such a man never earns any good in the next world. All that I have given away in honour of those three has become a hundred-fold or a thousand-fold of its actual measure. It is in conse- quence of that merit that even now, O Yudhishthira, the three worlds are clearly before my eyes ! One Acharyya is superior to ten Brahma- nas learned in the Vedas. One LJpadhyaya is again superior to ten Achar- yyas. The father, again, is superior to ten Upadhyayas. The mother, again, is superior to ten fathers, or perhaps, the whole world, in importan- ce. There is no one that deserves such reverence as the mother. In my opinion, however, the preceptor, is worthy of greater reverence than the father or even the mother. The father and the mother are authors of one's being. The father and the mother, O Bharata, only create the body. The life, on the other hand, that one obtains from one's pre- ceptor, is heavenly. That life is subject to no decay and is immortal. The father and the mother, however much they may offend, should never be slain. By not punishing a father and a mother, (even if they deserve punishment), one does not incur sin. Indeed, such reverend persons, by enjoying impunity, do not stain the king. The gods and the Rishis do not withhold their favours from such persons as strive to che- rish even their sinful fathers with reverence. He who favours a person by imparting to him true instruction, by communicating the Vedas, and giving knowledge which is immortal, should be regarded as both a father and mother. The disciple, in greatful recognition of what the instructor has done, should never do anything that would injure the latter. They that do not reverence their preceptors after receiving instruction from them by obeying them dutifully in thought and deed, incur the sin of killing a foetus. There is no sinner in this world like them. 1 Preceptors always show great affection for their disciples. The latter should, therefore, show their preceptors commensurate reverence. He, therefore, that wishes to earn that high merit which has existed from ancient days, should worship and adore his preceptors and cheer- fully divide with them every object of enjoyment.

If preceptors are worshipped, the very RisKis, and the gods, together with the Pirn's, are all pleased. Therefore, the preceptor is worthy of the highest reverence. The preceptor should never be disregarded in any manner by the disciple. Neither the mother nor the father deserves such regard as the preceptor. The father, the mother, and the preceptor, should never be insulted. No act of theirs should be found fault with. The gods and the great Rishis are pleased with him that behaves with reverence towards his preceptors.

It is not easy to indicate it. No one in discoursing upon righteous- ness, can indicate it accurately. Righteousness was declared (by Brahman) for the advancement and growth of all creatures. Therefore, that which leads to advancement and growth is righteousness. Righteousness was declared for restraining creatures from injuring one another. Therefore, that is Righteousness which prevents injury to creatures. Righteousness (Dharma) is so called because it upholds all creatures. In fact, all creatures are upheld by Righteousness. There- fore, that is Righteousness which is capable of upholding all creatures. Some say that Righteousness consists in what has been inculcated in the Srutis. Others do not agree to this. I would not censure them that say so. Everything, again, has not been laid down in the Srwtis. 4 Sometimes men (robbers), desirous of obtaining the wealth of some one, make enquiries (for facilitating the act of plunder). One should never answer such enquiries. That is a settled duty. If by maintaining silence, one succeeds in escaping, one should remain silent. If, on the other hand, one's silence at a time when one must speak rouses suspi- cion, it would be better on such an occasion to say what is untrue than what is true. This is a settled conclusion. If one can escape from sinful men by even a (false) oath, one may take it without incurring sin. One should not, even if one be able, give away his wealth to sin- ful men. Wealth given to sinful men afflicts even the giver. If a creditor desires to make his debtor pay off the loan by rendering bodily service, the witnesses would all be liars, if, summoned by the creditor for establishing the truth of the contract, they did not say what should 1 Vide ante Kama Parvan, T. 2 Alludes to ante, Kama Parvan.

Despoilers of other people's property, they had long lived in the enjoyment of their perquisites. Now, however, being ruled by the jackal, they were unable to appro- priate anything belonging to others. Desirous of advancement and prosperity, they began to tempt him with sweet speeches. Indeed, large bribes even were offered to allure his heart. Possessed of great wisdom, the jackal showed no signs of yielding to those temptations.

The jackal knew who had stolen the meat and who had conspired to do it. But though he knew every- thing, he tolerated it for a particular object.

The venerable dame said, O son, thou shouldst not accept this accusation fraught with deceit. Wicked individuals impute faults to even an honest person, moved by envy and rivalry. Enemies desirous of a quarrel cannot endure the ele- vation of an enemy brought about by his high feats. Faults are ascrib- ed to even a person of pure soul engaged in penances. With respect to even an ascetic living in the woods and employed in his own (harmless) acts, are raised three parties, viz., friends, neutrals, and fees. They that are rapacious hate them that are pure. The idle hate the active. The unlearned hate the learned. The poor hate the rich. The unrighte- ous hate the righteous. The ugly hate the beautiful. Many amongst the learned, the unlearned, the rapacious, and the deceitful, would falsely accuse an innocent person even if the latter happens to be possessed of the virtues and intelligence of Vrihaspati himself. If meat had really been stolen from thy house in thy absence, remember, the jackal refuses to take any meat that is even given to him. Let this fact be well considered (in finding out the thief). Wicked persons sometimes put on the semblance of the good, and they that are good sometimes wear the semblance of the wicked. Diverse kinds of aspect are notice- able in creatures. It is, therefore, necessary to examine which is which. The firmament seems to be like the solid base of a vessel. The fire-fly seems to be like the actual spark of fire. In reality, however, the sky has no base and there is no fire in the fire-fly. You see, there is necessity, therefore, for scrutiny in respect of even such things as are addressed to the eye. If a person ascertains everything after scru- tiny, he is never called upon to indulge in any kind of regret after- wards. It is not at all difficult, O son, for a master to put his servant to death. Forgiveness, however, in persons possessed of power, is always praiseworthy and productive of renown. Thou hadst made the jackal thy first minister. In consequence of that act, thou hadst earned great fame among all neighbouring chiefs. A good minister cannot be obtained easily. The jackal is thy well-wisher. Let him, therefore, be supported.

If persons reunited after separation approach one another again, their behaviour cannot be affectionate. No servant is to be seen who is moved (in what he does) by only the desire of benefiting his master. Service proceeds from the motive of doing good to the master as also one's own self. All acts are undertaken from selfish motives. Unselfish acts or motives are very rare. Those kings whose hearts are restless and unquiet cannot acquire a true knowledge of men.

Without listening to the entreaties of the king of beasts, the intelligent jackal cast off his body by sitting in praya and proceeded to heaven (as the reward of bis good deeds on Earth)/ \" SECTION CX1I 14 Yudhishthira said, 'What acts should be done by a king, and what are those acts by doing which a king may become happy ? Tell me this in detail, O thou that art the foremost of all persons acquaint- ed with duties T \"Bhishma said, 'I shall tell thee what thou wishest to know ! Listen to the settled truth about what should be done in this world by a king and what those acts are by doing which a king may become happy ! A king should not behave after the manner disclosed in the high history of a camel of which we have heard. Listen to that history then, O Yudhishthira ! There was, in the Krita age* a huge camel who had recollection of all the acts of his former life. Observing the most rigid vows', that camel practised very severe austerities in the forest. Towards the conclusion of his penances, the puissant Brahman became gratified with him. The Grandsire, therefore, desired to grant him boons. 'The camel said, Let my neck, O holy one, become long through thy grace, so that, O puissant lord, I may be able to seize any food that may lie even at the end of even a hundred Yojanas ! The high-souled giver of boons said, Let it be so! The camel then, having obtained the boon, returned to his own forest. The foolish animal, from the day of obtaining the boon, became idle. Indeed, the wretch, stupefied by fate, did not from that day go out for grazing. One day, while extending his long neck of a hundred Yojanas, the animal was engaged in picking his food without any labour, a great storm arose. The camel, placing his head and a portion of the neck within the cave of a mountain, resolved to wait till the storm would be over. Mean- while it began to pour in torrents, deluging the whole Earth. A jackal, with his wife, drenched by the rain and shivering with cold, dragged himself with difficulty towards that very cave and entered it quickly for shelter. Living as he did upon meat, and exceedingly hungry and tired as he was, O bull of Bharata's race, the jackal, seeing the camel's 1 Perhaps the sense is that men of vigorous understanding think all states to be equal.

But as he moved it up and down, the jackal and his wife, without losing their hold of it, continued to eat it away. Within a short time the camel was deprived of life. The jackal then, having (thus) slain and eaten the camel, came out of the cave after the storm and shower had ceased. Thus did that foolish camel meet with his death. Behold, what a great evil followed in the train of idleness ! As regards thyself, avoiding idleness and restraining thy senses, do everything in the world with proper means. Manu himself has said that victory depends upon intelligence. All acts that are accomplished with the aid of intelligence are regarded as the foremost, those achieved with the aid of arms are middling, those achieved with the aid of feet are inferior, while those done by carrying loads are the lowest. If the king is clever in the transaction of business and restrains his senses, his kingdom endures. Manu himself has said that it is with the aid of the intelligence that an ambitious person succeeds in achieving victories. In this world, O Yudhishthira, they who listen to wise counsels that are not generally known, that are, O sinless one, possessed of allies, and that act after proper scrutiny, succeed in achieving all their objects. A person possessed of such aids succeeds in ruling the entire Earth. O thou that art possessed of prowess like that of Indra himself, this has been said by wise men of ancient times conversant with the ordinances laid down in the scriptures ! I, also, with sight directed to the scriptures, have said the same to thee !

In consequence of this disposition of theirs to resist our currents, they are obliged to leave the place of their growth. Canes, however, act differently. The cane, beholding the advancing current, bends to it. The others do not act in that way. After the current has passed away, the cane resumes its former posture.

The man who. speaks ill of one when one's eye is not upon him, loses without delay the fruits of all his libations on fire and of the gifts he may make unto even a hundred persons. A man of wisdom, therefore, should unhesitatingly avoid a person of such sinful heart who deserves to be avoided by all honest men, as he would avoid the flesh of the dog. That wicked-souled wretch who proclaims the faults of a high-souled person, really publishes (by that act) his own evil nature even as a snake displays his hood (when interfered with by others).

Fierce lions and tigers, infuriate ele- phants of huge size, leopards, rhinoceroses, bears, and other animals of fierce aspect, subsisting upon blood, used to come to the Rishi and address him the usual questions of polite enquiry. Indeed, all of them behaved towards him like disciples and slaves and always did unto him what was agreeable. Coming to him they addressed the usual enqui- ries, and then went away to their respective quarters. One domestic animal, however, lived there permanently, never leaving the Muni at any time. He was devoted to the sage and exceedingly attached to him. Weak and emaciated with fasts, he subsisted upon fruits and roots and water, and was tranquil and of inoffensive aspect* Lying at the feet of that high-souled Rishi as the latter sat, the dog, with a heart like that of a human being, became exceedingly attached to him in consequence of the affection with which he was treated. One day a leopard of great strength came there, subsisting upon blood. Of a cruel disposition and always filled with delight at the prospect of prey, the fierce animal looked like a second Yama.

It wishes to slay me ! O great sage, do thou act in such a way that all my fears from this animal may be dispelled through thy grace !

One day as the elephant was cheerfully striding along the vicinity of the hermitage, there came before him unto that spot a maned lion born in a mountain cave and accustomed to slay elephants. Beholding the lion coming, the Rishi's elephant, from fear of life, began to tremble and sought the protection of the sage. The sage thereupon transformed that prince of elephants into a lion. As the wild lion was an animal of the same species with himself, the Rishi s lion no longer feared him. On the other hand, the wild lion seeing a stronger beast of his own species before him, became terrified. The Rishi's lion began to dwell in that hermitage within the forest.

Let thy servants, skilled in battle, be always attentive to their duties. It is desirable that they should be skilful in the management of steeds. O delighter of the Kurus, attend to the wants of thy kinsmen and friends ! Be thou surrounded with friends and relatives ! Seek thou the good of thy city !

Listen now to me, O king, as to how the duty of protection is to be exercised. A king conversant with his duties should assume many forms even as the peacock puts forth plumes of diverse hues. Keenness, crookedness, truth, and sincerity, are the qualities that should be present in him. With thorough impartiality, he should practise the qualities of goodness if he is to earn felicity. He must assume that particular hue or form which is beneficial in view of the particular object which he seeks to accomplish. 1 A king who can assume diverse forms succeeds in accomplishing even the most subtile objects. Dumb like the peacock in autumn, he should conceal his counsels. He should speak little, and the little he speaks should be sweet. He should be of good features and well versed in the scriptures. He should always be heedful in respect of those gates through which dangers may come and overtake him, like men taking care of breaks in embankments through which the waters of large tanks may rush and flood their fields and houses. He should seek the refuge of Brahmanas crowned with ascetic success even as men seek the refuge of lordly rivers generated by the rain-water collected within mountain lakes. That king who desires to amass wealth should act like religious hypo- crites in the matter of keeping a coronal lock. 2 The king should always have the rod of chastisement uplifted in his hands. He should always act heedf ully (in the matter of levying his taxes) after examin- ing the incomes and expenses of his subjects, like men repairing to a full-grown palmyra for drawing its juice. 3 He should act equitably towards his own subjects ; cause the crops of his enemies to be crushed by the tread of his cavalry, march against foes when his own wings have become strong ; and observe all the sources of his own weakness. He should proclaim the faults of his foes ; crush those that are their partizans; and collect wealth from outside like a person plucking flowers from the woods. He should destroy those foremost of monarchs that swell with might and stand with uplifted heads like mountains, by seeking the shelter of unknown shades 4 and by ambuscades and 1 I.e., as the oommentator explains, keenness, when he punishes and harmlesBness when he shows favour.

Like the peacock in the season of rains, he should enter his nightly quarters alone and unseen. Indeed, he should enjoy, after the manner of the peacock, within his inner apartments, the companionship of his wives. He should not put off his mail. He should himself protect his own self, and avoid the nets spread out for him by the spies and secret agents of his foes. He should also win over the affections of the spies of his enemies, but extirpate them when oppor- tunity occurs. Like the peacocks the king should kill his powerful and angry foes of crooked policy, and destroy their force and drive them away from home. The king should also like the peacock do what is good to him, and glean wisdom from everywhere as they collect insects even from the forest. An wise and peacock-like king should thus rule his kingdom and adopt a policy which is beneficial to him. By exercising his own intelligence, he should settle what he is to do. By consulting with others he should either abandon or confirm such resolu- tion. Aided by that intelligence which is sharpened by the scriptures, one can settle his courses of action. In this consists the usefulness of the scriptures. By practising the arts of conciliation, he should inspire confidence in the hearts of his enemies. He should display his own strength. By judging of different courses of action in his own mind he should, by exercising his own intelligence, arrive at conclusions. The king should be well-versed in the arts of conciliatory policy, he should be possessed of wisdom ; and should be able to do what should be done and avoid what should not. A person of wisdom and deep intelligence does not stand in need of counsels or instruction. A wise man who is possessed of intelligence like Vrihaspati, if he incurs obloquy, soon regains his disposition like heated iron dipped in water. A king should accomplish all objects, of his own or of others, according to the means laid down in the scriptures. A king conversant with the ways of acquiring wealth should always employ in his acts such men as are mild in disposition, possessed of wisdom and courage and great strength. Beholding his servants employed in acts for which each is fit, the king should act in conformity with all of them like the strings of a musical instrument, stretched to proper tension, according with their intended notes. The king should do good to all persons without transgressing the dictates of righteousness. That king stands immovable as a hill whom everybody regards He is mine. Having set himself to the task of adjudicating between litigants, the king, without making any differ- ence between persons that are liked and those that are disliked by him, should uphold justice. The king should appoint in all his offices such men as are conversant with the characteristics of particular families, of the masses of the people, and of different countries ; as are mild in speech ; as are of middle age ; as have no faults ; as are devoted to good acts ; as are never heedless; as are free from rapacity; as are possessed of learning and self-restraint ; as are firm in virtue and"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"276 MAHABHARATA always prepared to uphold the interests of both virtue and profit. In this way, having ascertained the course of actions and their final objects the king should accomplish them needfully ; and instructed in all matters by his spies, he may live in cheerfulness. The king who never gives way to wrath and joy without sufficient cause, who supervises all his acts himself, and who looks after his income and expenditure with his own eyes, succeeds in obtaining great wealth from the Earth. That king is said to be conversant with the duties of king-craft who rewards his officers and subjects publicly (for any good they do), who chastises those that deserve chastisement, who protects his own self, and who protects his kingdom from every evil. Like the Sun shedding his rays upon everything below, the king should always look after his kingdom himself, and aided by his intelligence he should supervise all his spies and officers. The king should take wealth from his subjects at the proper time. He should never proclaim what he does. Like an intelli- gent man milking his cow every day, the king should milk his kingdom every day. As the bee collects honey from flowers gradually, the king should draw wealth gradually from his kingdom for storing it. Having kept apart a sufficient portion, that which remains should be spent upon acquisition of religious merit and the gratification of the desire for pleasure. That king who is acquainted with duties and who is possessed of intelligence would never waste what has been stored. The king should never disregard any wealth for its littleness; he should never disregard foes for their powerlessness ; he should, by exercising his own intelligence, examine his own self ; he should never repose confidence upon persons destitute of intelligence. Steadness, clever- ness, self-restraint, intelligence, health, patience, bravery, and atten- tion to the requirements of time and place, these eight qualities lead to the increase of wealth be it small or be it much. A little fire, fed with clarified butter, may blaze forth into a conflagration. A single seed may produce a thousand trees. A king, therefore, even when he hears that his income and expenditure are great, should not disregard the smaller items. A foe, whether he happens to be a child, a young man, or an aged one, succeeds in slaying a person who is heedless. An insignificant foe, when he becomes powerful, may exterminate a king. A king, therefore, who is conversant with the requirements of time is the foremost of all rulers. A foe, strong or weak, guided by malice, may very soon destroy the fame of a king, obstruct the acquisition of religious merit by him ; and deprive him of even his energy. There- fore, a king that is of regulated mind should never be heedless when he has a foe. If a king possessed of intelligence desire for affluence and victory, he should, after surveying his expenditure, income, savings, and administration, make either peace or war.

That king, however, who wishes to be surrounded by train of self-seeking flatterers, 1 never succeeds in winning even the smallest benefit. For these reasons, the king should act with mildness in taking wealth from his subjects- If a king continually oppresses his people, he meets with extinction like a fiash of lightning that blazes forth only for a second. Learning, penances, vast wealth, indeed, everything, can be earned by exertion. Exertion, as it occurs in embodied creatures, is governed by intelligence Exertion, therefore, should be regarded as the foremost of all things. The human body is the residence of many intelligent creatures of great energy, of Sakra, of Vishnu, of Saraswati, and of other beings. A man of knowledge, therefore, should never disregard the body. 2 A covetous man should be subjugated by constant gifts. He that is covetous is never satiated with appropriating other people's wealth. Every one, however, becomes covetous in the matter of enjoying happi- ness. If a person, therefore, becomes destitute of wealth, he becomes destitute of virtue and pleasure (which are objects attainable by wealth) A covetous man seeks to appropriate the wealth, the enjoyments, the sons and daughters, and the affluence of others. In covetous men every kind of fault may be seen. The king, therefore, should never take a covetous man for his minister or officer. A king (in the absence of proper agents) should despatch even a low person for ascertaining the disposition and acts of his foes. A ruler possessed of wisdom should frustrate all the endeavours and objects of his enemies. That trustful and high-born king who seeks instruction from learned and virtuous Brahmanas and who is protected by his ministers, succeeds in keeping all his tributary chiefs under proper control. 3 O prince of men, I have briefly discoursed to thee of all the duties laid down in the scriptures.

And because these words were spoken first, therefore, they are known as the first words. And since it is by Chastisement that the misappropriation of other people's possessions is stopped, therefore Chastisement has come to be called by the name of Vyavahara. The aggregate of three always rests on well-applied Chastisement. Chastise- ment is a great god. In form he looks like a blazing fire. His complexion is dark like that of the petals of the blue lotus. He is equipt with four teeth, has four arms and eight legs and many eyes. His ears are pointed like shafts and his hair stands upright. He has matted locks and two tongues. His face has the hue of copper, and he is clad in a lion's skin. 1 That irresistible deity assumes such a fierce shape. Assuming again the form of the sword, the bow, the mace, the dart, the trident, the mal- let, the arrow, the thick and short club, the battle-axe, the discus, the noose, the heavy bludgeon, the rapier, the lance, and in fact of every kind of weapon that exists on Earth, Chastisement moves in the world. Indeed, Chastisement moves on Earth, piercing and cutting and afflict- ing and lopping off and dividing and striking and slaying and rushing against its victims.

Hence, Chastisement is exceedingly multiform. If Chastisement had not existed, all creatures would have grinded one another. Through fear of Chastisement, O Yudhishthira, living creatures do not slay one another. The subjects, O king, always protected by Chastisement, enhance the might of their ruler. It is for this that Chastisement is regarded as the foremost refuge of all. Castisement, O king, quickly sets the world on the path of righteous- ness. Dependent upon truth, righteousness exists in the Brahmanas. Endued with righteousness, foremost of Brahmanas became attached to the Vedas. From the Vedas the sacrifices flow. Sacrifices gratify the deities. The deities, being gratified, commend the denizens of the Earth to Indra. For benefiting the denizens of the Earth, Indra gives them food (in the form of rain, without which crops and vegetation would fail). The life of all creatures depends upon food. From food creatures derive their support and growth. Chastisement (in the form of the Kshattriya ruler) remains wakeful amongst them. For serving this object, Chastisement assumes the form of a Kshattriya among men. Protecting men, he remains awake, always heedful and never decaying Chastisement has again these other eight names, viz., God, Man, Life, Power, Heart, the Lord of all creatures, the Soul of all things, and the Living creature. God gave both affluence and the rod of chastisement to the king who is possessed of strength (in the form of military forces) and who is a combination of five ingredients. 1 Noblity of blood, ministers of great wealth, knowledge, the different kinds of forces(such as strength of body, energy of mind, &c.), with the eight objects men- tioned below, and the other force (viz., that which depends upon a well-filled treasury, should be sought for by the king, O Yudhishthira. Those eight objects are elephants, horses, cars, foot-soldiers, boats, impressed labourers (for following the camp and doing other work), increase of population, and cattle such as sheep, &c.).

There is nothing more worthy of respect by kings thau Chastisement by which the ways of Rihgteousness are pointed out. Brahman himself, for the protection of the world and for establishing the duties of different individuals, sent down (or created) Chastisement ! There is another kind of Vyavahara arising out of the disputee of litigants which also has sprung from Brahman. Principally characterised by a belief in either of the two parties, that Vyavahara is seen to be productive of good. There is another kind of Vyavahara which has the Veda for its soul- It is also said to have the Veda for its cause. There is, O tiger, among kings, a (third) kind of Vyavahara which is connected with faiitly do ns but which is consists with the scriptures. 1 That Vyava- hara which has, as above, been said to be characterised by a belief in either of two litigant parties, should be known by us as inhering in the king. It should be also known by the name of Chastisement, as also by the name of Evidence. Although Chastisement is seen to be regu- lated by Evidence, yet it has been said to have its soul in Vyavahara. That which has been called Vyavahara is really based upon vedic precepts. That Vyavahara which has been indicated to have the Vedas for its soul is Morality or duty, It is also productive of good unto persons believing in duty and morality, men of cleansed soulds have spoken of that Vyavahara as they have done of ordinary law. 2 The 1 The nearest approach in English to what is meant here by Vyava- hara is Law. Three kinds of Vyavahara or Law are here spoken of. The first is the ordinary Law, according to which the disputes of litigants are decided. It includes both civil and criminal law. It is quaintly described here as Vattripratyayalakshana, i.e. t 'characterised by a belief in either of two litigant parties.' When a suit, civil or criminal, is instituted, the king or those that act in the king's name must call for Evidence and decide the matter by believing either of the two parties. Then follows restoration or punishment. In either case, it is a form of Chastisement. The second kind of Vyavahara or Law is the ecclesiastical law of the Vedas. These are the precepts or injunctions laid down in those sacred books for regulating every part of human duty. The third kind of Vyavahara or Law is the particular customs of families or races. It is also called Uulachara. Where Kulachara is not inconsistent or in open variance of the established civil or criminal Law, or is not opposed to the spirit of the ecclesiastical law as laid down in the Vedas, it is upheld. (Even the British courts of aw uphold Kulachara, interpreting it very strictly.) What Bhishma says here is that even Kulachara should not be regarded as inconsistent with the scriptures (Vedas and Smritis).

Brahmrn is the Creator of the entire universe with the gods and Asura and Rakshasas and human beings and snakes, and of every other thing. Hence that Vyavahara which is characterised by a belief in either of two litigant parties has also flowed from him. For this reason He has laid down the following in respect of Vyavahara : Neither mother, nor father, nor brother, nor wife, nor priest, is unpunishable with that king who rules agreeably to his duty/ ' SECTION CXXII \"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old story that follows. There was among the Angas a king of great splendour, called Vasuhoma. That king was always engaged in acts of piety, and accom- panied by his spouse he always practised the most rigid penances. He repaired to the spot called Munjaprishtha held in high esteem by the Pitris and the celestial Rishis. There, on that peak of Himavat, near the golden mountains of Meru, (the great Brahmana here) Rama, sitting under the shade of a well-known banian, had tied his matted locks together. 1 From that time, O monarch, the spot, which is a favourite haunt of Rudra, came to be called Munjaprishtha by Rishis of rigid vows. King Vasuhoma, residing in that spot, acquired many pious attributes and, having gained the esteem of the Brahmanas, came to be regarded as a celestial Rishi in holiness. One day, that crusher of foes, that friend of Sakra, viz., king Mandhatri of great soul, came to Vasuhoma on his mountain retreat. Arrived there, Mandhatri, beholding king Vasuhoma of austere penances, stood before the latter in an attitude of humility. Vasuhoma offered unto his guest water to wash his feet, and the Arghya consisting of the usual articles, and enquired of him about the well-being or otherwise of his kingdom consisting of seven limbs. After this, Vasuhoma addressed his royal guest who faithfully as resting on the king. But as this kind of law has the Veda for its soul and has originally flowed from Brahman, a king incurs no sin by adminis- tering it and by inflicting chastisement in its administration. The purportl in brief, of verse 54 is that Manu and others, in speaking of Morality and duty have said that it is as binding as the ordinary law that is administer- ed by kings.

The soul of righteousness, it is eternal, and was created for maintaining the due government of all creatures ! It hath been heard by us that once upon a time, the Grandsire of all the worlds, viz.* the divine Brahman, desiring to perform a sacrifice, failed to find a priest possessed of qualifications like himself. For this reason he conceived in his brain and held the foetus there for many long years. After a thousand years had passed away, the great god sneezed. In that act, the foetus fell from his head. The divine being, Ochastiser of foes, that thus took birth from Brahman was called by the name of Kshupa. Possessed of great powers, he became a lord of creatures. That Kshupa became the priest, O king, in the sacrifice of the high- souled Grandsire. Upon the commencement of that sacrifice, of Brahman, O best of kings, Chastisement disappeared in consequence of the visible form that the Grandsire was then obliged to assume. 2 Chastisement having disappeared, a great confusion set in among all creatures. There was no longer any distinction between what should be done and what should not. All distinction, again, between clean and unclean food ceased. Men ceased to distinguish between what drink was allowable and what drink was otherwise. All creatures began to injure one another. There were no restrains in the matter of the union of the sexes. All idea of property ceased. All creatures began to rob, and snatching meat from one another. The strong began to slay the weak. Nobody cherished the slightest consideration for his neighbour. The Grandsire then, having worshipped the divine and eternal Vishnu, addressed that great boon-giving god, saying, It behoveth thee, O Kesava, to show mercy on the present occasion ! Let it be so ordained by thee that the confusion that has occurred may disappear ! Thus addressed, that foremost of deities, armed with an enormous 1 1.6,, to acknowledge thee as a tutor.

Upon the completion of that sacrifice according to due rites, Mahadeva, after doing proper reverence made over Chastisement, that protector of Righteousness, unto Vishnu- 1 Vishnu gave it to Angiras ; and Angiras, that foremost of ascetics, made it over to Indra and Marichi. Marichi gave it to Bhrigu. Bhcigu gave that rod intended for the protection of righteousness unto all the Risfiis.

All the three again have their root in Will. Willis concerned with objects. All objects, again, in their entirety, exist for gratifying the desire of enjoyment. Upon these then does the agregate of three depend. Entire abstraction from all objects is Emancipation. It is said that Virtue is sought for the protection of the body, and Wealth is for the acquisition of Virtue. Pleasure is only the gratification of the senses. All the three have, threfore, the quality of Passion. 2 Virtue, Wealth, and Pleasure, when sought for the sake of heaven such other rewards, are said to be remote because the rewards themselves are remote. When sought, however, for the sake of Knowledge of Self, they are said to be proximate. One should seek them when they are of such a character. 8 One should not cast them off even mentally. If virtue, Wealth, and Pleasure are to be abandoned, one should abandon them when one has freed one's self by ascetic penances. 4 The aim of the triple aggregate is towards emancipation. Would that man could obtain it ! One's acts, undertaken and completed with even the aid of intelligence may or may not lead to the expected results. Virtue is not always the root of Wealth, for other things than Virtue lead to Wealth (such as service, 1 The commentator illustrates this by the action of a various husband seeking congress with his wedded wife in the proper season. There is reli- gious merit in the performance of the rites known by the name of Garbha* dhan-j there is pleasure in the act itself; and lastly, wealth or profit in the form of a son is also acquired. T. 2 There are three qualities or attributes that characterise human acts, viz., Goodness, Passion, and Darkness. Vide the later sections of the Bhagavadgita. Such Virtue and Wealth and Pleasure, therefore, are not very high objects of pursuit. Things possessing the attribute of Goodness only are worthy of pursuit. T. 3 I.e., one should seek virtue for only compassing purity of soul ; Wealth in order that one may spend it in acts undertaken without desire of fruit ; and Pleasure for only supporting the body.

There is again a contrary opinion (for some say that Wealth is earned through chance or birth or like causes). In some instances, Wealth acquired has been productive of evil. Other things again than Wealth (such as fasts and vows) have lead to the acquisition of Virtue. As regards this topic, therefore, a dullard whose under- standing has been debased by ignorance, never succeeds in acquiring the highest aim of Virtue and Wealth, viz., Emancipation. Virtues dross consists in the desire of reward ; the drose of Wealth consists in hoarding it ; when purged of these impurities, they are productive of great results. In this connection is cited the narrative of the discourse that took place in days of old between Kamandaka and Angaristha. One day, king Angaristha, having waited for the opportunity, saluted the Rishi Kamanda as he was seated at his ease asked him the following questions. If a king, forced by lust and folly, commits sin for which he afterwards repents, by what acts, O Rishi, can those sins be destroyed? If again a man impelled by ignorance, does what is sinful in the belief that he is acting righteously, how shall the king put stop to that sin come into vogue among men ? vi 'Kamanda said, That man who, abandoning Virtue and Wealth pursues only Pleasure, reaps as the consequence of such conduct the destruction of his intelligence. The destruction of intelligence is followed by heedlessness that is at once destructive of both Virtue and Wealth. From such heedlessness proceed dire atheism and systematic wickedness of conduct. If the king does not restrain those wicked men of sinful conduct, all good subjects then live in fear of him like the inmate of a room within which a snake has concealed itself. The subjects do not follow such a king. Brahmanas and all pious persons also act in the same way. As a consequence the king incurs great danger, and ultimately the risk of destruction itself. Overtaken by infamy and insult, he has to drag on a miserable existence. A life of infamy, however, is equal to death. Men learned in the scriptures have indicated the following means for checking sin. The king should always devote himself to the study of the three Vedas. He should respect the Brahmanas and do good offices unto them. He should be devoted to righteousness. He should make alliance (of marriage) with high families. He should wait upon high-minded Brahmanas adorned with the virtue of forgiveness. He should perform ablutions and recite sacred mantras and thus pass his time happily. Banishing all wicked subjects from himself and his kingdom, he should seek the companion- ship of virtuous men. He should gratify all persons by speeches or good acts. He should say unto all I am yours, and proclaim thel virtues of even his foes. By pursuing such conduct he may soon cleanse himself of his sins and win the high regard of all.

Thus addressed, Vrihas- pati said unto him that Knowledge (leading to emancipation) is the source of the highest felicity. Indeed, Vrihaspati indicated Knowledge to be the source of supreme felicity.

Possessed of great ascetic merit and endued with great splendour, the chief of the celestials then repaired to Bhargava and obtained from him with a gratified heart, a knowledge of what was for his great good. Obtaining the permission of the high-souled Bhargava, the performer of a hundred sacrifices once more asked the sage as to whether there was anything higher (as the means for the acquisition of felicity) than what the sage had already told him.

He remained perfectly silent, with- out uttering a single word in answer. In former days that Brahmana had not been much honoured by the king. In disappointment, O monarch, he had for that reason practised austere penances for a long time, resolving in his mind that he should never accept anything in gift from either kings or members of any other order.

I had solicited many kings and found that nothing is so difficult of acquisition as an image that Hope sets before the mind ! 1 ' The king said, At thy words, O Brahmana, I understand what is slender and what is not so. 1 I understand also how difficult of acquisition are the images set by Hope before the mind. I regard these words of thine as utterances of Sruti. O thou of great wisdom, one doubt, however, has arisen in my mind. It behoveth thee, O sage, to explain it in detail unto me that ask thee ? What is slender than thy body? Tell me this, O holy one, if, of course, O best of sages, the topic be one which may be discoursed upon without impropriety ! \" * The emaciated sage said, A contented applicant is exceed- ingly difficult to meet with. Perhaps, there is none such in the world. Something rarer still, O sire, is the person that never disregards an applicant.

Having caused the prince to be brought thither, the sage rebuked the king (his father). 3 That fore- most of virtuous persons then displayed himself to be the god of righteousness. Indeed, having displayed his own wonderful and celestial form, he entered an adjacent forest, with heart freed from wrath and the desire of revenge. I saw all this, O king, and heard the words I have said.

What, indeed, should be the conduct of a king the affairs of whose kingdom are ill-regulated, and who disregards the requirements of place and time, who is unable, in consequence of his oppressions, to bring about peace and cause disunion among his foes ? Should he seek the acquisition of wealth by evil means, or should he lay down his life without seeking wealth ?'"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"SANTI PABVA 299 \"Bhishma said, 'Conversant as thou art with duties, thou hast, bull of Bharata's race, asked me a question relating to a mystery (in connection with duties). 1 Without being questioned, O Yudhishthira, 1 could not venture to discourse upon this duty ! Morality is very subtile. One understands it, O bull of Bharata's race, by the aid of the texts of scriptures. By remembering what one has heard and by practising good acts, some one in some place may become a righteous person. By acting with intelligence the king may or may not succeed in acquiring wealth. 3 Aided by thy own intelligence do thou think what answer should be given to thy question on this head. Listen, O Bharata, to the means, fraught with great merit, by which kings may conduct themselves (during seasons of distress). For the sake of true morality, however, I would not call those means righteous. If the trea- sury be filled by oppression, conduct like this brings the king to the verge of destruction. Even this is the conclusion of all intelligent men who have thought upon the subject. The kind of scriptures or science which one always studies gives him the kind of knowledge which it is capable of giving. Such Knowledge verily becomes agreeable to him. Ignorance leads to barrenness of invention in respect of means. Contri- vanceof means, again, through the aid of knowledge, becomes the source of great felicity. Without entertaining any scruples and any malice, 8 listen to these instructions. Through the decrease of the treasury, the king's forces are decreased. The king should, therefore, fill his trea- sury (by any means) like to one creating water in a wilderness which is without water. Agreeably to this code of quasi-morality practised by the ancients, the king should, when the time for it comes, 4 show com- passion to his people. This is eternal duty. For men that are able and competent, 5 the duties are of one kind. In seasons of distress, how- ever, one's duties are of a different kind. Without wealth a king may (by penances and the like) acquire religious merit. Life, however, is much more important than religious merit. (And as life cannot be supported without wealth, no such merit should be sought which stands in the way of the acquisition of wealth). A king that is weak, by acquiring only religious merit, never succeeds in obtaining just and proper means for sustenance ; and since he cannot, by even his best exertions, acquire power by the aid of only religious merit, therefore the practices in seasons of distress are sometimes regarded as not inconsistent with morality. The learned, however, are of opinion that 1 I.e., this is not a subject upon which one can or should discourse before miscellaneuos audiences.

After the season of distress is over, what should the Kshattriya do ? He should (at such a time) conduct himself in such a way that his merit may not be destroyed. He should also act in such a way that he may not have to succumb to his enemies. 1 Even these have been declared to be his duties. He should not sink in despondency. He should not (in times of distress) seek to rescue (from the peril of destruction) the merit of others or of himself. On the other hand, he should rescue his own self. This is the settled conclusion. 2 There is this Sruti, viz., that it is settled that Brahmanas, who are conversant with duties, should have proficiency in respect of duties. Similarly, as regards the Kshattriya, his proficiency should consist in exertion, since might of arms is his great possession, When a Kshattriya's means of support are gone, what should he not take excepting what belongs to ascetics and what is owned by Brahmanas ? Even as a Brahmana in a season of distress may officiate at the sacrifice of a person for whom he should never officiate (at other and ordinary times) and eat forbidden food, so there is no doubt that a Kshattriya (in distress) may take wealth from every one except ascetics and Brahmanas. For one afflicted (by an enemy and seeking the means of escape) what can be an improper outlet ? For a person immured (within a dungeon and seeking escape) what can be an improper path? When a person becomes afflicted, he escapes by even an improper out- let. For a Kshattriya that has, in consequence of the weakness of his treasury and army, become exceedingly humiliated, neither a life of mendicancy nor the profession of a Vaisya or that of a Sudra has been laid down. The profession ordained for a Kshattriya is the acquisition of wealth by battle and victory. He should never beg of a member of his own order. The person who supports himself at ordinary times by following the practices primarily laid for him, may in seasons of distress support himself by following the practices laid down in the alternative. In a season of distress, when ordinary practices cannot be followed, a Kshattriya may live by even unjust and improper means. The very Brahmanas, it is seen, do the same when their means of living are destroyed. When the Brahmanas (at such times) conduct themselves thus, what doubt is there in respect of Kshattriyas ? This is, indeed, settled. Without sinking into despondency and yielding to destruc- tion, a Kshattria may (by force) take what he can from persons that are rich.

Therefore, a Kshattriya in distress should take (by force) what he can, with a view to (ultimately) protect the people. No person in this world, O king, can support life without injuring other creatures. The very ascetic leading a solitary life in the depths of the forest is no exception- A Kshattriya should not live, relying upon destiny, 1 especially he, O chief of the Kurus, who is desirous of ruling. The king and the kingdom should always mutually protect each other. This is an eternal duty. As the king protects, by spending all his possessions, the kingdom when it sinks into distress, even so should the kingdom protect the king when he sinks into distress. The king, even at the extremity of distress, should never give up 2 his treasury, his machinery for chastising the wicked, his army, his friends and allies and other necessary institutions and the chiefs existing in his kingdom. Men conversant with duty say that one must keep one's seeds, deduct- ing them from one's very food. This is a truth cited from the treatise of Samvara well-known for his great powers of illusion. Fie on the life of that king whose kingdom languishes. Fie on the life of that man who from want of means goes to a foreign country for a living. The king's roots are his treasury and army. His army, again, has its roots in his treasury. His army is the root of all his religious merits. His religious merits, again, are the root of his subjects. The treasury can never be filled without oppressing others. How then can the army be kept without oppression ? The king, therefore, in seasons of distress, incurs no fault by oppressing his subjects for filling the treasury. For performing sacrifices many improper acts are done. For this reason a king incurs no fault by doing improper acts (when the object is to fill his treasury in a season of distress). For the sake of wealth practices other than those which are proper are followed (in seasons of distress). If (at such times) such improper practices be not adopted, evil is certain to result. All those institutions that are kept up for working destruction and misery exist for the sake of collecting wealth. 8 Guided by such considerations, an intelligent king should settle his course (at such times). As animals and other things are necessary for sacrifices, as sacrifices are for purifying the heart, and as animals, sacrifices, and purity of the heart are all for final emancipation, even so policy and chastisement exist for the treasury, the treasury exists for the army, and policy and treasury and army all the three exist for vanquishing foes and protecting or enlarging the kingdom. I shall here cite an example illustrating the true ways of morality. A large tree is cut down for making of it a sacrificial stake. In cutting it, other trees that stand in its way have also to be cut down. These also, in falling down, 1 Sankhalikhitam i.e., that which is written on the forehead by the Ordainer.

Wealth for the performance of sacrifices should be acquired by every means. The demerit that attaches to an act done in a season of distress is not equal to that which attaches to the same act if done at other times, O Bharata ! The acquisition of wealth and its abandonment cannot both be possibly seen in the same person, O king I I do not see a rich man in the forest. With respect to every wealth that is seen in this world, every one contends with every one else, saying, This shall be mine, This shall be mine ! This is nothing, O scorcher of foes, that is so meritorious for a king as the possession of a kingdom. It is sinful for a king to oppress his subjects with heavy impositions at ordinary times. In a season, however, of distress, it is quite different. Some acquire wealth by gifts and sacri- fices ; some who have a liking for penances acquire wealth by penances; some acquire it by the aid of their intelligence and cleverness. A person without wealth is said to be weak, while he that has wealth become powerful. A man of wealth may acquire everything. A king that has well-filled treasury succeeds in accomplishing everything. By his treasury a king may earn religious merit, gratify his desire for pleasure, obtain the next world, and this also. The treasury, however, should be filled by the aid of righteousness and never by unrighteous practices, such, that is as pass for righteous in times of distress.* ' SECTION CXXXI (Apaddharmanusasana Parva) \"Yudhishthira said, 'What, besides this, should be done by a king that is weak and procrastinating, that does not engage in battle from anxiety for the lives of his friends, that is always under the influence of fear, and that cannot keep his counsels secret ?

What man conversant with morality is there that would sacri- fice his own self, which is a more valuable possession, for encountering that danger from which escape can be had by the abandonment of his treasury and army ? A king should protect the ladies of his household H these fall into the hands of the enemy, he should not show any com- passion for them (by incurring the risk of his own arrest in delivering them).

They who always support themselves by putting forth their might never like any other method of living. They that are endued with might, O Yudhishthira, always live by the aid of prowess. The ordinary scrip- tures, that exist (for seasons of distress) without exceptions of any kind, should b^ practised by a king (at such times). A king, however, that is endued with intelligence, while following those scriptures, would do something more. 1 At such times, however, the king should not oppress, Ritwijas, and Purohitas and preceptors and Brahmanas, all of whom are honoured and held in high esteem. By oppressing them, even at such times, he incurs reproach and sin. This that I tell thee is regarded as an authority in the world. Indeed, this is the eternal eye (by which practices in seasons of distress are to be viewed). One should be guided by this authority. By this is to be judged whether a king is to be called good or wicked. It is seen that many persons residing in villages and towns, actuated by jealousy and wrath, accuse one another. The king should never, at their words, honour or punish anybody. Slander should never be spoken. If spoken, it should never be heard. When slanderous converse goes on, one should close one's ears or leave the place outright. Slanderous converse is the characteristics of wicked men. It is an indication of depravity. They, on the other hand, O king, who speak of the virtues of others in assemblies of the good, are good men. As a pair of sweet-tempered bulls governable and well-broken and used to bear burthens, put their necks to the yoke and drag the cart willingly, even so should the king bear his burthens (in seasons of distress). Others say that a king (at such times) should con- duct himself in such a way that he may succeed in gaining a large number of allies, Some regard ancient usage as the highest indication of righteousness. Others, viz., they that are in favour of the conduct pursued by Sankha towards Likhita, do not hold this opinion. They do not advance such an opinion through either malice or covetousness 2 1 The commentator explains it in the following way. The ordinary uexfcs, without exceptions of any kind, laid down for seasons of distress, permit a king to fill his treasury by levying heavy contributions on both his own subjects and those of hostile kingdoms. An ordinary king, at such a time, acts in this way. A king, however, that is endned with intelli- gence, while levying such contributions, takes care to levy them upon those that are wicked and punishable among his own subjects and among the subjects of other kingdoms, and refrains from molesting the good. Compare the conduct of Warren Hastings in exacting a heavy tribute, when his own treasury was empty, from Cheyt Sing, whose unfriendliness for the British power was a matter of notoriety. T. 2 The sense seems to be that there are persons who hold that priests and Brahmanas should never be punished or taxed. This is the eternal usage, and, therefore, this is morality.

He should never bend down in humility. 1 Exertion is man- liness, He should rather break at an unfavourable opportunity than bend before any one. He should rather repair to the forest and live there with the wild animals. But he should not still live in the midst of ministers and officers who have like robbers broken through all restraints. Even the robbers of the forest may furnish a large number of soldiers for the accomplishment of the fiercest of deeds, O Bharata ! If the king transgresses all wholesome restraints, all people become filled with alarm. The very robbers who know not what compassion is, dread such a king. 2 For this reason, the king should always esta- blish rules and restraints for gladdening the hearts of his people. Rules in respect of even very trivial matters are hailed with delight by the people. There are men who think that this world is nothing and the future also is a myth. He that is an atheist of this type, though his heart is agitated by secret fears, should never be trusted. If the robbers of the forest, while observing other virtues, commit depredations in respect only of property, those depredations may be regarded as harm- less. The lives of thousands of creatures are protected in consequence of robbers observing such restraints.

It is again certain that those kings who strive (by making peace) to inspire confidence upon them- selves in the hearts of the robbers, succeed, after watching all their ins and oats, in exterminating them. For this reason, in dealing with robbers, it is necessary that they should not be exterminated outright. 3 They should be sought to be brought under the king's sway. The king should never behave with cruelty towards them, thinking that he is more powerful than they. Those kings that do not exterminate them outright have no fear of extermination to themselves. They, however, that do exterminate them have always to live in fear in consequence of that act.* \" 1 I.e., yield with ease.

As it is useless to argue, upon seeing certain foot-prints on the ground, whether they are wolf's or not, even so is all discussion upon the nature of righteousness and the reverse. Nobody in this world ever sees the fruits of righteousness and unrighteousness. A Kshattriya, therefore, should seek the acquisition of power. He that is powerful is master of everything. Wealth leads to the possession of an army. He that is powerful 1 obtains intelligent advisers. He that is without wealth is truly fallen. A little (of anything in the world) is regarded as the dirty remnant of a feast. 2 If a strong man does even many bad acts, nobody, through fear, says or does anything (for censuring or checking him). If righteousness and Power be associated with Truth, they can then rescue men from great perils. If, however, the two be compared, Power will appear to be superior to Righteousness. It is from Power that Righteousness springs. Righteousness rests upon Power as all immobile things upon the Earth. As smoke depends upon the wind (for its motion), even so Righteousness depends upon Power. Righte- eousness which is the weaker of the two depends for its support upon a tree. Righteousness is dependent on them that are powerful even as pleasure is dependent upon them that are given to enjoyment. There is nothing that powerful men cannot do.

Though a robber, he still succeeded in winning feli- city in heaven. Morning and evening he used to excite the wrath of the deer by chasing them. He was well conversant with all the practi- ces of the Nishadas as also of all animals living in the forest. Well acquainted with the requirements of time and place, he roved over the mountains. Acquainted as he was with the habits of all animals, his arrows never missed their aim, and his weapons were strong. Alone, he could vanquish many hundreds of troops. He worshipped his old, blind, and deaf parents in the forest every day. With honey and flesh and fruits and roots and other kinds of excellent food, he hospitably entertained all persons deserving of honour and did them many good offices. He showed great respect for those Brahmanas that had retired from the world for taking up their residence in the woods. Killing the deer, he often took flesh to them. As regards those that were unwill- ing, from fear of others, to accept gifts from him because of the profession he followed, he used to repair their abodes before dawn and leave flesh at their doors. 1 One day many thousands of robbers, desti- tute of compassion in their conduct and regardless of all restraints, desired to elect him as their leader. The robbers said, Thou art acquainted with the requirements of place and time. Thou hast wisdom and courage. Thy firmness also is great in everything thou undertakest ! Be thou our foremost of leaders, 1 It is always reproachful to accept gifts from persons of questionable character. T."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"SANTI PARVA 309 respected by us all !

None of you should ever slay a woman amongst all creatures. Let Brahmanas be always blessed and you should always fight for their good. Truth should never be sacrificed. The marriages of men should never be obstructed. No injury should be inflicted on those houses in which the deities, the Pitris, and guests are worshipped. Amongst creatures, Brahmanas deserve to be exempted by you in your plunder- ing excursions. By giving away even your all, you should worship them.

' \"Bhishma continued, 'Those robbers, thus addressed, obeyed all the commands of Kayavya. By desisting from sin, they obtained great prosperity. By behaving himself in such a way, by thus doing good to the honest and by thus restraining the robbers from bad practices, Kayavya won great success (in the next world) He who always thinks of this narrative of Kayavya will not have any fear from the denizens of the forest, in fact, from any earthly creature. Such a man will have no fear from any creature, O Bharata ! He will have no fear from wicked men. If such a man goes to the forest, he will be able to live there with the security of a king.' \" SECTION CXXXVI \"Bhishma said, 'In this connection, viz., the method by which a king should fill his treasury, persons acquainted with the scriptures of olden days cite the following verses sung by Brahman himself.

In this connection, listen attentively to the following excellent story of a procrastinating person in the matter of settling his course of action. In a lake that was not very deep and which abounded with fishes, there lived three Sakula fishes that were friends and constant companions.

Let us speedily go to some other place before our path becomes obstructed ! He that resists future evil by the aid of good policy, never incurs serious danger. Let my counsels prevail with you ! Let us all leave this place ! That one amongst the three who was procrastinating then answered, It is well said. There is, however, no need of such haste. This is my deliberate opinion ! Then the other fish, who was noted for presence of mind, addressed his pro- crastinating companion and said, When the time for anything comes, I never fail to provide for it according to policy , Hearing the answers of his two companions, he of great forethought and considerable intelligence immediately set out by a current and reached another deep lake. The fishermen, seeing that all the water had been baled out, shut in the fishes that remained by diverse means. Then they began to agitate the little water that remained, and as they began to catch the fish, the procrastinating Sakula was caught with many others. When the fishermen began to tie to a long string the fishes they had caught, the Sakula who was noted for presence of mind thrust himself into the company of those that had been so tied and remained quietly among them, biting the string, for he thought that he should do it to give the appearance of being caught. The fishermen believed that all the fishes attached to the string had been caught. They then removed them to a piece of deep water for washing them. Just at that time the Sakula noted for presence of mind, leaving the string, quickly escaped. That fish, however, who had been procrastinating, foolish and senseless and without intelligence as he was, and, therefore, unable to escape, met with death. \"'Thus every one meets with destruction, like the procrastinating fish, who from want of intelligence cannot divine the hour of danger- That man, again, who regarding himself clever does not seek his own good in proper time, incurs great danger like the Sakula who had presence of mind.

I desire, O grandsire, to hear of that superior intelligence aided by which a king, conversant with the scriptures and well versed with morality and profit, may not be stupefied even when surrounded by many foes. I ask thee this, O chief of Kuru's race ! It behoveth thee to discourse to me on this ! I desire to hear everything, comfortable to what has been laid down in the scriptures, about the manner in which a king should conduct himself when he is assailed by many foes. When a king falls into distress, a large number of foes, provoked by his past acts, range themselves against him and seek to vanquish him. How may a king, weak and alone, succeed in holding up his head when he is challenged on all sides by many powerful kings leagued together ? How does a king at such times make friends and foes ! How should he, O bull of Bharata's race, behave at such a time towards both friends and foes ? When those that have indications of friends really become his foes, what should the king then do if he is to obtain happiness ? With whom should he make war and with whom should he make peace ? Even if he be strong, how should he behave in the midst of foes ! O scorcher of foes, this I regard to be the highest of all questions connected with the discharge of kingly duties. There are few men for listening to the answer of this question and none to answer it save Santanu's son Bhishma firmly wedded to truth and having all his sense under con- trol !

The course of human actions, through the combination of circumstances, becomes very uncertain. As re- gards, therefore, what should be done and what should not, it is necessary that paying heed to the requirements of time and place, one should either trust one's foes or make war.

That foolish man who never makes peace with foes, never succeeds in winning any gain or acquiring any of those fruits for which others endeavour. He again who make peace with foes and quarrels with even friends after a full consideration of circumstances, succeeds in obtaining great fruits. In this connection is cited the old story of the discourse between a cat and a mouse at the foot. of a banian.' \"Bhishma continued, \"There was a large banian in the midst oTH an extensive forest. Covered with many kinds of creepers, it was the resost of diverse kinds of birds. It had a large trunk from which numerous branches extended in all directions. Delightful to look at, the shade it afforded was very refreshing. It stood in the midst of the forest, and animals of diverse species lived on it. A mouse of great wisdom, named fPalita, lived at the foot of that tree, having made a hole there with a hundred outlets. On the branches of the tree there lived a cat, of the name of Lomasa, in great happiness, daily devouring a large number of birds. Sometime after, a Chandala came into the forest and built a hut for himself. Every evening after sunset he spread his traps. Indeed, spreading his nets made of leathern strings he went back to his hut, and happily passing the night in sleep, returned to the spot at the dawn of day. Diverse kinds of animals fell into his traps every night. And it so happened that one day the cat, in a moment of heedlessess, was caught in the snare. O thou of great wisdom, when his foe the cat who was at all times an enemy of the mouse species was thus caught in the net, the mouse Palita came out of his hole and began to rove about fearlessly. While trustfully roving through the forest in seach of food, the mouse after a little while saw the meat (that the Chandala had spread there as lure). Getting upon the trap, the little animal began to eat the flesh. Laughing mentally, he even got upon his enemy entangled helplessly in the net. Intent on eating the flesh, he did not mark his own danger, for as he suddenly cast his eyes he saw a terrible foe of his arrived at that spot. That foe was none else than a restless mungoose of coppery eyes, of the name of Harita. Living in underground holes, its body resembled the flower of a reed. Allured to that spot by the scent of the mouse, the animal came there with great speed for devouring his prey. And he stood on his haunches, with head upraised, licking the corners of his mouth with his tongue. The mouse beheld at the same time another foe living in the holds of trees, then sitting on the branch of the banian. It was anight-wandering owl of the name of Chandraka of sharp beaks. Having become an object of sight with both the mungoose and the owl, the mouse, in great alarm, began to think in this strain. At such a season of great danger, when death itself is staring me in the face, when there is fear on every side, how should one act that wishes for one's good ? Encom-"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"814 MAHABHARATA passed on all sides by danger, seeing fear in every direction, the mouse, filled with alarm for his safety, made a high resolution. /Warding off even innumerable dangers by hundreds of means, one should always save one's life. Danger, at the present moment, encompasses me on every side ! If I were to descend from this trap on the ground, without adequate precautions, the mungoose will surely seize and devour me. If I remain on this trap, the owl will surely seize me. If, again, that cat succeeds in disentangling himself from the net, he also is certain to devour me ! It is not proper, however, that a person of our intelli- gence should lose his wits. I shall, therefore, strive my best to save my life, aided by proper means and intelligence. A person possessed of intelligence and wisdom and conversant with the science of policy never sinks, however great and terrible the danger that threatens him. At present, however, I do not behold any other refuge than this cat. He is an enemy. But he is in distress. The service that I can do him is very great. Sought to be made a prey by three foes, how should I now act for saving my life ? I should now seek the protection of one of those foes, vfe., the cat. Taking the aid of the science of policy, let me counsel the cat for his good, so that I may, with my intelligence, escape from all the three. The cat is my great foe, but the distress into which he has fallen is very great. Let me try whether I can succeed in making this foolish creature understand his own interests. Having fallen into such distress, he may make peace with me. A per- son when afflicted by a stronger one should make peace with even an enemy. Professors of the science of policy say that even this should be the conduct of one who having fallen into distress seeks the safety of his life. It is better to have a learned person for an enemy than a fool for a friend. As regards myself, my life now rests entirely in the hands of my enemy the cat. I shall now address the cat on the subject of his own liberation. Perhaps, at this moment, it would not be wrong to take the cat for an intelligent and learned foe ! Even thus did that mouse, surrounded by foes, pursue his reflections. Having reflected in this strain, the mouse, conversant with the science of Profit and well acquainted with occasions when war should be declared and peace made, gently addressed the cat, saying,^! address thee in friendship, O cat !

There is an excellent expedient in this case, which suggests itself to me, and by which you may obtain your escape and I may obtain great benefit. By reflecting earnestly I have hit upon that expedint for thy sake and for my sake, for it will benefit both of us. There are the mungoose and the owl, both waiting with evil intent.

Thou hast lived on this tree and I have lived at its foot. Both of us have dwelt here for many long years. All this is known to thee. He upon whom nobody places his trust, and he who never trusts another, are never applauded by the wise. Both of them are unhappy. For this reason, let our love for each other increase, and let there be union amongst us both. Men of wisdom never applaud the endeavour to do an act when its opportunity has passed away. Know that this is the proper time for such an understanding amongst us. I wish that thou shouldst live, and thou also wishest that I should live.

Having said these words that were beneficial to both of them, that were fraught with reason and on that account highly acceptable, the mouse Palita waited in expectation of an answer. 11 'Hearing these well-chosen words, fraught with reason and highly acceptable, that the mouse said, the mouse's foe possessed of judgment and forethought, viz., the cat said these words in reply. Endued with great intelligence, and possessed of eloquence, the cat, reflecting upon his own state, praised the words of the speaker and honoured him by gentle words in return. Possessed of sharp foreteeth and having eyes that resembled the stones called lapis lazuli, the cat, called jLomasa, gently eyeing the mouse, answered as follows: lam delighted with thee, O amiable one !

Having applauded Palita, the cat, disposed to friendliness, reflected for a moment, and gladly said without losing any time, Come quickly to me ! Blessed be thou, thou art, indeed, a friend dear to me as life ! O thou of great wisdom, through thy grace I have almost got back my life ! Whatever it is in my power to do for thee now, tell me and I shall do it. Let there be peace between us, O friend !

A person by doing even abundant services in return never becomes equal to the person that did him good in the first instance. The former does those services for the sake of services received. The latter, how- ever, should be held to have acted without any such motive ' \"Bhishma continued, 'The mouse, having thus made the cat under- stand his own interests, trustfully crouched beneath his enemy's body. Possessed of learning, and thus assured by the cat, the mouse trustfully laid himself thus under the breast of the cat as if it were the lap of his father or mother. Beholding him thus ensconced within the body of the cat, the mungoose and the owl both became hopeless of seizing thsir prey. Indeed, seeing that close intimacy between the mouse and the cat, both Harita and Chandraka became alarmed and filled with wonder. Both of them had strength and intelligence. Clever in seizing their prey, though near, the mungoose and the owl felt themselves unable to wean the mouse and the cat from that compact. Indeed, beholding the cat and the mouse make that convenant for accomplish- ing their mutual ends, the mungoose and the owl both left that spot and went away to their respective abodes. \\After this, the mouse Palita, conversant with the requirements- of time and place, began, as he lay under the body of the cat, to cut strings of the noose slowly, waiting for the proper time to finish his work. Distressed by the strings that entangled him, the cat became impatient upon seeing the mouse slowly cutting away the noose. Beholding the mouse employed so slowly in the work, the cat wishing to expedite him in the task, said : How is it, O amiable one, that thou dost not proceed with haste in thy work ? Dost thou disregard me now, having thyself succeeded in thy object ? O slayer of foes, do thou cut these strings quickly f The hunter will soon come here !

When I shall seethe hunter approach towards this spot armed with weapons, I shall cut the strings at that moment of fear to both of us ! Freed then, thou wilt ascend the tree. At that time thou wilt not think of anything else save the safety of thy life. And when thou, O Lomasa, wilt fly away in fear, I shall enter my hole and thou wilt get upon the tree! Thus addressed by the mouse in words that were beneficial to him, the cat, possessed of intelligence and eloquence, and impatient of saving his life, replied unto the mouse in the following words. Indeed, the cat, who had quickly and properly done his own part of the covenant, address- ing the mouse who was not expeditious in discharging his part, said, I rescued these from a great danger with considerable promptness. Alas honest persons never do the business of their friends in this way. Filled with delight while doing it, they do it otherwise ! Thou shouldst do what is for my good with greater expedition. O thou of great wisdom, do thou exert a little so that good may be done to both of us !

I beg thy forgiveness. Be gratified with me ! After the cat had said these words, the mouse, possessed of intelligence and wisdoni-and knowledge of the scriptures, said these excellent words unto him ; I have, O cat, heard what thou hast said in furtherance of thy own object. Listen, however, to me as I tell thee what is consistent with my own objects ! That friendship in which there is fear and which cannot be kept up without fear, should be maintain- ed with great caution like the hand (of the snake-charmer) from the snake's fangs ! The person that does not protect himself after I aving made a covenant with a stronger individual, finds that covenant to be productive of injury instead of benefit. Nobody is nobody's friend ; no- body is nobody's well-wisher ; persons become friends or foes only from motive of interest.

Only one remains to be cut ! I will cut that also with haste. Be comforted, O Lomasa ! While the mouse and the cat were thus talking with each other, both in serious danger, the night gradually wore away. A great fear, however, penetrated the heart of the cat. When at last morning came, the Chandala, whose name was Parigha, appeared on the scene. His visage was frightful. His hair was black and twany. His hips were very large and his aspect was very fierce. Of a large mouth that extendeded from ear to ear, and exceed- ingly filthy, his ears were very long. Armed with weapons and accompanied by a pack of dogs, the grim-looking man appeared on the scene. Beholding the individual who resembled a messenger of Yama, the cat became filled with fear. Penetrated with fright, he addressed Palita and said, What shalt thou do now ? The mouse very quickly cut the remaining string that held fast the cat. Freed from the noose, the cat ran with speed and got upon the banian. Palita also, freed from that situation of danger and from the presence of a terrible foe, quickly fled and entered his hole. Lomasa meanwhile had climbed the high tree. The hunter, seeing everything, took up his net. His hopes frus- trated, he also quickly left that spot-j Indeed, O bull of Bharata's race, the Ckandala returned to his abode. Liberated from that great peril, and having obtained back his life which is so very valuable, the cat from the branches of that tree addressed the mouse Palita then staying within the hole, and said, Without having conversed with me, thou hast suddenly run away. I hope thou dost not suspect me of any evil intent ? I am certainly grateful and thou hast done me a great service. Having inspired me with trustfulness and having given me my life, why dost thou not approach me at a time when friends should enjoy the sweetness of friendrhip ?

Listen now as I say what appears to me. j Friends should be well examined. Foes also should be well studied. In this world, a task like this is regarded by even the learned as a difficult one depending upon acute intelligence. Friends assume the guise of foes, and foes assume the guise of friends. When compacts of friendship are formed, it is difficult for the parties to understand whether the other parties are really moved by lust and wrath. There is no such thing as a foe. There is no such thing in exis- tence as a friend. It is force of circumstances that creates friends and foes. He who regards his own interests ensured as long as another per- son lives and thinks them indangered when that other person will cease to live, takes that other person for a friend and considers him so as long as those interests of his are not clashed against. There is no condition that deserves permanently the name either of friendship or hostility. B )th friends and foes arise from considerations of interest and gain. Friendship becomes changed into enemity in the course of time. A foe also becomes a friend. Self-interest is very powerful. He who reposes blind trust on friends and always behaves with mistrust towards foes without paying any regard to considerations of policy, finds his life to be unsafe. He who, disregarding all considerations of policy, sets his heart upon an affectionate union with either friends or foes, comes to be regarded as a person whose understanding has been unhinged. One should not repose trust upon a person undeserving of trust, nor should one trust too much a person deserving of trust. The danger that arises from blind reposing of confidence is such that it cuts the very roots (of the person that reposes such confidence). The father, the mother, the son, the maternal uncle, the sister's son, other relatives and kinsmen, are all guided by considerations of interest and profit. Father and mother may be seen to discard the dear son if fallen. 1 People take care of their own selves. Behold the efficacy of self-interest !

This whole world of creatures is moved by the desire of gain (in some form or other). One never becomes dear to another (without cause). The friendship between two uterine brothers, the love between husband and wife, depend upon interest. I do not know any kind of affection between any persons that does not rest upon some motive of self-interest. If, as is sometimes seen, uterine brothers or husband and wife having quarrelled reunite together from a natural affection, such a thing is not to be seen in persons unconnected with one another. One becomes dear for one's liberality. Another becomes dear for his sweet words. A third becomes so in consequence of his religious acts. Generally, a person becomes dear for the purpose he serves. The affection between us arose from a sufficient cause. That cause exists no longer. On the other hand, from adequate reason, that affection between us has come to an end. What is that reason, I ask, for which I have become so dear to thee, besides thy desire of making me thy prey ? Thou shouldst know that lam not forgetful of this. Times spoils reasons. Thou seekest thy own interests. Others, however, possessed of wisdom, understand their own interests. The world rests upon the example of the wise. Thou shouldst not address such words to a person possessed of learning and competent to understand his own interests. Thou art powerful. The reason of this affection that thou showest for me now is ill-timed. Guided, however, by my own interests, I myself am firm in peace and war that are themselves very ustable. The circumstances under which peace is to be made or war declared are changed as quickly as the clouds change their form. This very day thou wert my foe. This very day, again, thou wert my friends. This very day thou hast once more become my enemy. Behold the levity of the considerations that move living creatures ! There was friendship between us as long as there was reason for its existence. That reason, dependant upon time, has passed away. Without it, that friendship also has passed away. Thou art by nature my foe. From circumstances thou becomest my friend. That state of things has passed away. The old state of enemity that is natural has comeback.

Thou art seeking for thy prey, with thy eyes directed towards me. Thou hast sons and wives. Thou seekest still friendly union with me and wishest to treat me with affection and do me services. O friend, I am incapable of acceeding to this proposal. Seeing me with thee, why will not thy dear spouse and thy loving children cheerfully eat me up ? I shall not, therefore, unite with thee in friendship. The reason no longer exists for such a union. If, indeed, thou dost not forget my good offices, think of what will be beneficial to me and be comfortable. What person is there possessed of any wisdom that will place himself under the power of a foe that is not distinguished for righteousness, that is in pangs of hunger, and that is on the look out for a prey ? Be happy then, I will presently leave thee. I am filled with alarm even if I be- hold thee from a distance. I shall not mingle with thee, cease in thy attempts, O Lomasa ! If thou thinkest that I have done thee a service follow then the dictates of friendship when I may happen to rove trustfully or heedlessly. Even that will be gratitude in thee ! A resi- dence near a person possessed of strength and power is never applauded Even if the danger that existed be regarded to have passed away. I should always stand in fear of one more powerful than myself. If thou dost not seek thy own interests (of the kind indicated), tell me then what is there that I should do for thee. I shall certainly give thee everything except my life. For protecting one's own self one should give up one's very children, and kingdom, and jewels, and wealth. One should sacrifice one's all for protecting one's own self. If a person lives he can recover all the affluence hat he may have to give unto foes for protecting his life. It is not desirable to give up life like one's wealth. Indeed, one's own self should always be protected by, as I have already said, giving up one's wives and wealth. Persons who are mindful of protecting their own selves and who do all their acts after a proper consideration and survey, never incur danger as the consequence of their acts. They that are weak always know him for a foe who is poss- essed of greater strength. Their understanding, firm in the truths of the scriptures, never loses its steadiness ! \" 'Thus rebuked soundly by the mouse Palita, the cat, blushing with shame, addressed the mouse and said the following words. 11 'Lomasa said, Truly I swear by thee that to injure a friend is in my estimation very censurable.

For these reasons, O good friend, it behoveth thee to reunite thyself with me, If I am commanded by thee, I can, with all my kinsmen and relatives, lay down my very life.

It is impossible for thee, by such eulogiums or by gifts of great wealth, to induce me to unite with thee again. I tell thee, O friend, that they who are possessed of wisdom never place themselves, when there is not sufficient reason, under the power of a foe. A weak person having made a compact with a stronger one when both are threatened by foes, should ( when that common danger passes away ) conduct himself needfully and by considerations of policy. Having gained his object, the weaker of the two parties should not again repose confidence on the stronger. One should never trust a person who does not deserve to be trusted. Nor should one repose blind confidence upon a person deserving of trust. One should always endeavour to inspire others with confidence in himself. One should not. however, himself repose confidence in foes. For these reasons one should, under all circumstances, protect his own self. One's possessions and children and everything are so long valuable as one is alive, In brief, the highest truth of all treatises on policy is Mistrust. For this reason, mistrust of all persons is productive of the greatest good. However weak people may be, if they mistrust their foes, the latter, even if strong, never succeed in getting them under power./ O cat, one like myself should always guard one's life from persons like thee. Do thou also protect thy own life from the Chandala whose rage has been excited I 1 While the mouse thus spake, the cat, frightened at the mention of the hunter, hastily leaving the branch of the tree, ran away with great speed. Having thus displayed his power of understanding, the mouse Palita also, conversant with the truths of scripture and possessed of wisdom, entered another hole.' \"Bhishma continued, .Even thus the mouse Palita, possessed of wisdom, though weak and alone, succeeded in baffling many powerful foes. One possessed of intelligence and learning should make peace 1 The correct reading is Jatakilwishat*T*"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"SANTt PAHVA 323 with a powerful foe. The mouse and the cat owed their escape to their reliance upon each other's services. I have thus pointed out to thee the course of Kshattriya duties at great length. Listen now to me in brief. When two persons who were once engaged in hostilities make peace with each other, it is certain that each of them has it in his heart to over-reach the other. In such a case he that is possessed of wisdom succeeds by the power of his understanding in over-reaching the other. He, on the other hand, who is destitute of wisdom suffers himself, in consequence of his heedlessness, to be over-reached by the wise. It is necessary, therefore, that, in fear one should seem to be fearless, and while really mistrusting others one should seem to be trustful. One who acts with such needfulness never trips, or tripping, is never ruined. When the time comes for it, one should make peace with an enemy ; and when the time comes, one should wage war with even a friend. Even thus should one conduct himself, Oking, as they have said that are conversant with the considerations of peace (and war). Knowing this, O monarch, and bearing the truths of scripture in mind, one should, with all his senses about him and without heedfulness, act like a person in fear before the cause of fear actually presents itself. One should, before the cause of fear has actually come, act like a person in fear, and make peace with foes. Such fear and heedfulness lead to keenness of understanding. If one acts like a man in fear before the cause of fear is at hand, one is never filled with fear when that cause is actually present. From the fear, however, of a person who always acts with fearlessness, very great fear is seen to arise. 1 Never cherish /ear such counsel should never be given to any one. The person that cherishes fear moved by a consciousness of his weakness, always seeks the counsel of wise and experienced men. For these reasons, one should, when in fear, seem to be fearless, and when mistrusting (others) should seem to be trustful. One should not, in view of even the gravest acts, behave towards others with falsehood, Thus have I recited to thee, O Yudhishthira, the old story (of the mouse and the cat). Having listened to it, do thou act duly in the midst of thy friends and kinsmen. Deriving from that story a high understanding, and learning the difference between friend and foe and the proper time for war and peace, thou wilt discover means of escape when overwhelmed with danger. Making peace, at a time of common danger, with one that is powerful, thou shouldst act with proper consideration in the matter of uniting thyself with the foe (when the common danger has passed away).

There was a bird named Pujani who lived for along time with king Brahmadatta in the inner apartments of his palace at Kampilya. |Like the bird Jivajivaka, Pujani could mimic the cries of all animals. Though a bird by birth, she had great knowledge and was conversant with every truth. While living there, she brought forth an offspring of great splendour. At the very same time the king also got by his queen a son. Pujani, who was grateful for the shelter of the king's roof, used every day to go to the shores of the ocean and bring a couple of fruits for the nourishment of her own young one and the infant prince. One of those fruits she gave to her own child and the other she gave to the prince. The fruits she brought were sweet, as nectar, and capable of increasing strength and energy. Every day she brought them and every day she disposed of them in the same way. The infant prince derived great strength from the fruit of Pujani's giving that he ate. One day the infant prince, while borne on the arms of his nurse, saw the little offspring of Pujani. Getting from the nurse's arms, the child ran towards the bird, and moved by childish impulse, began to play with it, relishing the sport highly. At length, raising the bird which was of the same age with himself in his hands,"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"SANTl PABVA 325 the prince pressed out its young life and then came back to his nurse. The dam, O king, who had been out in her search after the accustomed fruits, returning to the palace, beheld her young one lying on the ground, killed by the prince. Beholding her son deprived of life, Pujani, with tears gushing down her cheeks, and heart burning with grief, wept bitterly and said, Alas, nobody should live with a Ksha- ttriya or make friends with him or take delight in any intercourse with him ! When they have any object to serve, they behave with courtesy. When that object has been served, they cast off the instrument. The Kshattriyas do evil unto all. They should never be trusted. Even after doing an injury they always seek to soothe and assure the injured for nothing. I shall certainly take due vengeance, for this act of hostility, upon this cruel and ungrateful betrayer of confidence. He has been guilty of a triple sin in taking the life of one that was born on the same day with him and that was being reared with him in the same place, that used to eat with him, and that was dependent on him for protec- tion ! Having said these words unto herself, Pujani, with her talons, pierced the eyes of the prince, and deriving some comfort from that act of vengeance, once more said, A sinful act, perpetrated delibera- tely, assails the doer without any loss of time. They, on the other hand, who avenge an injury, never lose their merit by such conduct. If the consequence of a sinful act be not seen in the perpetrator himself, they would certainly be seen, O king, in his sons or son's sons or daughter's sons! Brahmadatta, beholding his son blinded by Pujani and regarding the act to have been a proper vengeance for what his son had done, said these words unto Pujani. * 'Brahmadatta said, An injury was done by us to thee. Thou hast avenged it by doing an injury in return. The account has been squared. Do not leave thy present abode. On the other hand, continue to dwell here, O Pujani. \" 'Pujani said, If a person having once injured another continues to reside with that other, they that are possessed of learning never app- laud his conduct. Under such circumstances it is always better for the injurer to leave his old place. One should never place one's trust upon the soothing assurances received from an injured party. The fool that trusts such assurances soon meets with destruction. Animosity is not quickly cooled. The very sons and grandsons of persons that have injured each other meet with destruction (in consequence of the quarrel descending like an inheritance). In consequence again of such destruc- tion of their offspring, they lose the next world also. Amongst men that have injured one another, mistrust would be productive of happi- ness.

One's own self it is that enjoys or suffers one's happiness or misery. Amongst persons that have injured one another, it is not advisable there should be (real) peace. The reason no longer exists for which I lived here. The mind of a person who has once injured another, becomes naturally filled with mistrust, if he sees the injured person worshipping him with gifts and honours. Such conduct, especially when displayed by those that are strong, always fills the weak with alarm. A person possessed of intelligence should leave that place where he first meets with honour in order to meet only with dishonour and injury next. In spite of any subjequent honour that he might obtain from his enemy, he should behave in this way. I have dwelt in thy abode for a long time, all along honoured by thee ! A cause of enmity, however, has at last arisen. I should, therefore, leave this place without any hesitation. \" 'Brahmadatta said, One who does an injury in return for an injury received is never regarded as offending. Indeed, the avenger squares his account by such conduct. Therefore, O Pujani, continue to reside here without leaving this place 1 \"Pujani said, No friendship can once more be cemented between a person that has injured and him that has inflicted an injury in return The hearts of both cannot forget what has happened. 1 'Brahmadatta said, It is necessary that a union should take place between an injurer and the avenger of that injury. Mutual ani- mosity, upon such a union, has been seen to cool. No fresh injury also has followed in such cases. \" 'Pujani said, Animosity (springing from mutual injuries) can never die. The person injured should never trust his foes, thinking O, I have been soothed with assurances of good will ! In this world, men frequently meet with destruction in consequence of (misplaced) confidence. For this reason it is necessary that we should no longer meet each other. They who cannot be reduced to subjection by the application of even force and sharp weapons, can be conquered by (insincere) conciliation like (wild) elephants through a (tame) she elephant. 'Brahmadatta said, 'From the fact of two persons residing together, even if one inflicts upon the other deadly injury, an affection arises naturally between them, as also mutual trust, as in the case of the Chandala and the dog.

In such a case, the man's fault should be properly weighed. 2 When hostility has arisen with even a friend, no further confidence should be reposed upon him. Feelings of animosity lie hid like fire in wood. Like the Aurvya fire within the waters of the ocean, the fire of animosity can never be extinguished by gifts of wealth, by display of prowess, by conciliation, or by scriptrual learning. The fire of animosity, once ignited, the result of an injury once inflicted, is never extinguished, O king, without consuming out the right one of the parties. One, having injured a person, should never trust him again as one's friend, even though one might have (after the infliction of the injury) wor- shipped him with wealth and honours. The fact of the injury inflicted fills the injurer with fear. I never injured thee. Thou also didst never do me an injury. For this reason I dwelt in thy abode. All that is changed, and at present I cannot trust thee I \"Brahmadatta said, It is Time that does every act, Acts are of diverse kinds, and all of them proceed from Time. Who therefore, injures whom ? 3 Birth and Death happen in the same way. Creatures act (i.e., take birth and live) in consequence of Time, and it is in conse- quence also of Time that they cease to live. Some are seen to die at once. Some die one at a time. Some are seen to live for long periods. Like fire consuming the fuel it gets, Time consumes all creatures. O blessed lady, I am, therefore, not the cause of your sorrow, nor art thou the cause of mine. It is Time that always ordains the weal and woe of embodied creatures. Do thou then continue to dwell here according to thy pleasure, with affection for me and without fear of any injury from me. What thou hast done has been forgiven by me. Do thou also forgive me, O Pujani ! \"Pujani said, If Time, according to thee, be the cause of all acts, then of course nobody can cherish feelings of animosity towards any- body on Earth. I ask, however, why do friends and kinsmen, are slain, 1 The hostility between Krishna and Sisupala was due to the first of these causes ; that between the Kurus and the i andavas to the second ; that between Drona and Drupada to the third ; that between the oat and the mouse to the fourth ; and that between the bird and the king (in the present story) to the fifth.

If it is Time that is moulding everything, what need is there of medicines ? Why do people, deprived of their senses by grief, indulge in such delirious rhapsodies ? If Time, according to thee, be the cause of acts, how can religious merit be acquired by persons performing religious acts ? Thy son killed my child. I have injured him for that. I have by that act, O king, become liable to be slain by thee. Moved by grief for my son, I have done this injury to thy son. Listen now to the reason why I have become liable to be killed by thee. Men wish for birds either to kill them for food or to keep them in cages for sport. There is no third reason besides such slaughter or immurement for which men would seek individuals of our species. Birds, again, from fear of being either killed or immured by men, seek safety in flight. Persons conversant with the Vedas have said that death and immurement are both painful. Life is dear unto all. All creatures are made miserable by grief and pain. All creatures wish for happiness. Misery arises from various sources. Decrepitude, O Brahma- datta is misery. The loss of wealth is misery. The adjacence of anything disagreeable or evil is misery. Separation or dissociation from friends and agreeable objects is misery. Misery arises from death and immure- ment. Misery arises from causes connected with women and from other natural causes. The misery that arises from the death of children alters and afflicts all creatures very greatly. Some foolish persons say that there is no misery in other's misery. 1 Only he who has not felt any misery himself can say so in the midst of men, He, however, that has felt sorrow and misery, would never venture to say so. One that has felt the pangs of every kind of misery feels the misery of others as one's own. What I have done to thee, O king, and what thou hast done to me, cannot be washed away by even a hundred years. After what we have done to each other, there cannot be a reconciliation. Af often as thou wilt happen to think of thy son, thy animosity towards me will become fresh. If a person after avenging an injury, desires to make peace with the injured, the parties cannot be properly reunited even like the fragments of an earthen vessel. Men conversant with scrip- tures have laid it down that trust never produces happiness. Usanas himself sang two verses unto Prahlada in days of old.

Kings extinguish animosities by having recourse to conciliation but, when the opportunity comes, break their foes into pieces like earthen jars full of water dashed upon stone. If the king does injury to any one, he should never trust him again. By trusting a person who has been injured, one has to suffer great misery. 1 'Brahmadatta said, No man can obtain the fruition of any object by withholding his trust (from others). By cherishing fear one always is obliged to live as a dead person. \"Pujani said, He whose feen have become sore, certainly meets with a fall if he seeks to move, move he may howsoever cautiously. A man who has got sore eyes, by opening them against the wind, finds them exceedingly pained by the wind. He who, without knowing his own strength, sets foot on a wicked path and persists in walking along it, soon loses his very life as the consequence. The man who, destitute of exertion, tills his land, disregarding the season of rain, never succeeds in obtaining a harvest. He who takes every day food that is nutritive, be it bitter or astringent or palatable or sweet, enjoys a long life. He, on the other hand, who disregards wholesome food and takes that which is injurious without an eye to consequences, soon meets with death. Destiny and Exertion exist, depending upon each other. They that are of high souls achieve good and great feats, while eunuchs only pay court to Destiny. Be it harsh or be it mild, an act that is beneficial should be done. The unfortunate man of inaction, however, is always overwhelmed by all sorts of calamity. Therefore, abandoning everything else, one should put forth his energy. Indeed, disregarding everything, men should do what is productive of good to themselves. Knowledge, courage, cleverness, strength, and patience, are said to be one's natural friends. They that are possessed of wisdom pass their lives in this world with the aid of those five. Houses, precious metals, land, wife, and friends, these are said by the learned to be secondary sources of good. A man may obtain them everywhere. A person possessed of wisdom may be delighteed everywhere. Such a man shines everywhere. He never inspires anybody with fear. If sought to be frightened, he never yields to fear himself. The wealth, however little, that is possessed at any time by an intelligent man is certain to increase. Such a man does every act with cleverness. In consequence of self- restraint, he succeeds in winning great fame.

One should from a distance abandon a bad wife, a bad son, a bad king, a bad friend, a bad alliance, and a bad country. One should not place any trust on a bad son. What joy can one have in a bad wife ? There can not be any happiness in a bad kingdom- In a bad country one cannot hope to obtain a livelihood. There can be no lasting companion- ship with a bad friend whose attachment is very uncertain. In a bad alliance, when there is no necessity for it, there is disgrace. She, indeed, is a wife who speaks only what is agreeable. He is a son who makes the sire happy. He is a friend in whom one can trust. That, indeed, is one's country where one earns one's living. He is a king of strict rule who does not oppress, who cherishes the poor and in whose terri- tories there is no fear. Wife, country, friends, son, kinsmen, and relatives, all these one can have if the king happens to be possessed of accomplishments and virtuous eyes. If the king happens to be sinful, his subjects, in consequence of his oppressions, meet with destruction. The king is the root of one's triple aggregate (i.e., Virtue, Wealth, and Pleasure). He should protect his subjects with heedfulness. Taking from his subjects a sixth share of their wealth, he should protect them all. That king who does not protect his subjects is truly a thief. That king who, after giving assurances of protection, does not, from rapacity, fulfil them, that ruler of sinful soul, takes upon himself the sins of all his subjects and ultimately sinks into hell. That king, on the other hand, who, having given assurances of protection, fulfils them, comes to be regarded as a universal benefactor in consequence of his protect- ing all his subjects. The lord of all creatures, viz., Manu, has said that the king has seven attributes : he is mother, father, preceptor, protector, fire, Vaisravana, and Yama. The king by behaving with compassion towards his people is called their father. The subject that behaves falsely towards him takes birth in his next life as an animal or a bird- By doing good to them and by cherishing the poor, the king becomes a mother unto his people. By scorching the wicked he comes to be regarded as fire, and by restraining the sinful he comes to be called Yama. By making gifts of wealth unto those that are dear to him, the king comes to be regarded asKuvera, the grantor of wishes. By giving instruction in morality and virtue, he becomes a preceptor, and by exercising the duty of protection he becomes the protector. That king who delights the people of his cities and provinces by means of his accomplishments, is never divested of his kingdom in consequence of such observance of duty. That king who knows how to honour his subjets never suffers misery either here or hereafter.

I shall tell thee how he should bear himself at such a time, casting off compassion. In this connection is cited the old story of the discourse between Bharadwaja and king Satrunjaya. These was a king name Satrunjaya among the Sauviras. He was a great car-warrior. Repairing to Bharadwaja, he asked the Rishi about the truths of the science of Profit, saying, How can an un- acquired object be acquired ? How, again, when acquired, can it be increased ? How also, when increased, can it be protected ? And how, when protected, should it be used ? Thus questioned about the truths of the science of Profit, the regenerate Rishi said the following words fraught with excellent reason unto that ruler for explaining those truths. 1 'The Rishi said, The king should always stay with the rod of chastisement uplifted in his hand. He should always display his prowess. Himself without laches, he should mark the laches of his foes, Indeed, his eyes should ever be used for that purpose. At the sight of a king who has the rod of chastisement ever uplifted in his hand, every one is struck with fear. For this reason, the king should rule all creatures with the rod of chastisement. Men possessed of learning and knowledge of truth applaud Chastisement. Hence, of the four requisites of rule, viz., Conciliation, Gift, Disunion, and Chastisement, Chastisement is said to be the foremost.

A king possessed of wisdom should cut away the very roots of his foe. He should then win over and bring under his sway the allies and partisans of that foe. When calamities overtake the king, he should, without losing time, counsel wisely, display his prowess properly, fight with ability, and' even retreat with wisdom. In speech only should the king exhibit his humility, but at heart he should be sharp as a razor. He should cast off lust and wrath, and speak sweetly and mildly. When the occasion comes for intercourse with an enemy, a king possessed of foresight should make peace, without reposing blind trust on him. When the business is over, he should quickly turn away from the new ally. One should conciliate a foe with sweet assurances as if he were a friend. One, however, should alwas stand in fear of that foe as of a room within which there is a snake. He whose understandiug is to be dominated by thee (with the aid of thine) should be assured by reference to the past- He who is of wicked understanding should be assured by promises of future good. The person, however, that is possessed of wisdom, should be assured by present services. The person who is desirous of achieving prosperity should join hands, swear, use sweet words, worship by bending down his head, and shed tears. 1 One should bear one's foe on one's shoulders as long as time is unfavourable. When however, the opportunity has come one should break him into fragments like an earthen jar on a stone. It is better, O monarch, that a king should blaze up for a moment like charcoal of ebony-wood than that he should smoulder and smoke like chaff for many years. A man who has many purposes to serve should not scruple to deal with even an ungrateful person. If successful, one can enjoy happiness. If unsuccessful, one loses esteem. Therefore in accomplishing the acts of such persons, one should, without accomplishing them completely, always keep some- thing, unfinished. A king should do what is for his good, imitating a JcoJciJa, a boar, the mountains of Meru, an empty chamber, an actor, and a devoted friend. 2 The king should frequently, with heedful application, repair to the houses of his foes, and even if calamities be- fall them, ask them about their good. They that are idle never win affluence ; nor they that are destitute of manliness and exertion ; nor they that are stained by vanity ; nor they that fear unpopularity ; nor they that are always procrastinating. The king should act in such a way 1 i.e., do any of these or all as occasion may require. T. 1 The king should imitate the kokila by causing his own friends or subjects to be maintained by others ; he should imitate the bear by tearing up his foes by their very roots ; he should imitate the mountains of Meru by presenting such a front that no body may transgress him ; he should imitate an empty chamber by keeping room enough for storing acquisitions ; he should imitate the actor by assuming different guises ; and lastly, he should imitate a devoted friend in attending to the interests of his loving subjects, T,"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"8ANTI PABV that his foe may not succeed in detecting his laches- He should, however, himself mark the laches of his foes. He should imitate the tortoise which conceals its limbs. Indeed, he should always conceal his own holes. He should think of all matters connected with finance like a crane- 1 He should put forth his prowess like a lion. He should lie in wait like a wolf and fall upon and pierce his foes like a shaft. Drink, dice, women, hunting, and music, these he should enjoy judici- ously. Addiction to these is productive of evil. He should make his bow of bamboos ; he should sleep like the deer ; he should be blind when it is necessary that he should be so, or he should even be deaf when it is necessary to be deaf. The king possessed of wisdom should put forth his prowess, regardful of time and place. If these are not favourable, prowess becomes futile. Marking timeliness and untimeliness reflecting upon his own strength and weakness, and improving his own strength by comparing it with that of the enemy, the king should address himself to action. That king who does not crush a foe reduced to subjection by military force, provides for his own death like the carb when she conceives. The king should put forth blossoms but not fruits. Putting forth fruits he should be difficult of climbing; and though unripe he should seem to be ripe. If he conducts himself in such a way, then he w^uld succeed in upholding himself against all foes. The king should first strengthen the hopes (of those that approach him as suitors). He should then put obstacles in the way of the fulfilment of those hopes. He should say that those obstacles are merely due to occasion. He should next represent that those occasions are really the results of grave causes. As long as the cause of fear does not actually come, the king should make all his arrangements like a person inspired with fear. When, however, the cause of fear comes upon him, he should smite fearlessly. No man can reap good without incurring danger. If, again, he succeeds in preserving his life amid danger, he is sure to earn great benefits. 2 A king should ascertain all future dangers; when they are present, he should conquer them ; and lest they grow again, he should, even after conquering them, think them to be unconquered. The abandonment of present happiness and the pursuit of that which is future, is never the policy of a person possessed of intelligence. The king who having made peace with a foe sleeps happily in trustfulness is like a man who sleeping on the top of a tree awakes after a fall. When one falls into distress, one should raise one's self by any means in one's power, mild or stern ; and after such rise, when competent, one should practise righteousness.

Sinful thieves, who offend against the laws of righteousness and who are thorns in the side of every person, enter gardens and places of amusement and houses set up for giving drinking water to thirsty travellers and public serais and drinking spots and houses of ill fame and tirthas and public assemblies, These should be recognised and arrested and put down. The king should not trust the person that does not deserve to be trusted nor should he trust too much the person that is deserving of trust. Danger springs from trust. Trust should never be placed without previous examination. Having by plausible reasons inspired confidence in the enemy, the king should smite him when he makes a false step. The king should fear him, from whom there is no fear ; he should also always fear them that should be feared. Fear that arises from an unfeared one may lead to total extermination. By attention (to the acquisition of religious merit), by taciturnity, by the reddish garb of ascetics, and wearing matted locks and skins, one should inspire confidence in one's foe, and then (when the opportunity comes) one should jump upon him like the wolf. A king desirous of prosperity should not scruple to slay son or brother or father or friend, if any of these seek to thwart his objects. The very preceptor, if he happens to be arrogant, ignorant of what should be done and, what should not, and a treader of unrighteous paths, deserves to be restrained by chastisement. Even as certain insects of sharp stings cut off all flowers and fruits of the trees on which they sit, the king should, after having inspired confidence in his foe by honours and salutations and gifts, turn against him and shear him of everything. Without piercing the very vitals of others, without accomplishing many stern deeds, without slaughtering living creatures after the manner of the fisherman, one cannot acquire great prosperity. There is no separate species of crea- tures called foes or friends. Persons become friends or foes accord- ing to the force of circumstances. The king should never allow his foe to escape even if the foe should indulge piteous lamentations. He should never be moved by these ; on the other hand, it is his duty to destroy the person that has done him an injury. A king desirous of prosperity should take care to attach to himself as many men as he can, and to do them good. In behaving towards his subjects he should always be free from malice. He should also, with great care, punish and check the wicked and disaffected. When he intends to take wealth, he should say what is agreeable. Having taken wealth, he should say similar things. Having struck off one's h<>ad with his sword, he should grieve and shed tears. A king desirous of prosperity should draw others unto himself by means of sweet words, honours, and gifts.

By eating them one's teeth are broken while the taste is not gratified. The triple aggregate has three disadvantages with three inseparable adjuncts. Carefully considering those adjuncts, the disadvantages should be avoided. 1 The unpaid balance of a debt, the unquenched remnant of a fire, and the unslain remnant of foes, repeatedly grow and increase. Therefore, all those should be completely extinguished and exterminated. Debt, which always grows, is certain to remain unless wholly extinguished. The same is the cause with defeated foes and neglected maladies. These always produce great fear. (One should, therefore, always eradicate them). Every act should be done thoroughly. One should be always heedful. Such a minute thing as a thorn, if extracted badly, leads to obstinate gangrene. By slaughtering its population, by tearing up its roads and otherwise injuring them, and by burning and pulling down its houses, a king should destroy a hostile kingdom. A king should be far-sighted like the vulture, motion- less like a crane, vigilant like a dog, valiant like a lion, fearful like a crow, and penetrate the territories of his foes like a snake with ease and without anxiety. A king should win over a hero by joining his palms, a coward by inspiring him with fear, and a covetous man by gifts of wealth while with an equal he should wage war. He should be mindful of producing disunion among the leaders of sects and of conci- liating those that are dear to him. He should protect his ministers from disunion and destructions. If the king becomes mild, the people disregard him. If he becomes stern, the people feel it as an affliction. The rule is that he should be stern when the occasion requires stern- ness, and mild when the occasion requires mildness. By mildness should the mild be cut. By mildness one may destroy that which is fierce. There is nothing that mildness cannot effect. For this reason, mildness is said to be sharper than fierceness. That king who becomes mild when the occasion requires mildness and who becomes stern when sternness is required, succeeds in accomplishing all his objects, and in putting down his foes. Having incurred the animosity of a person possessed of knowledge and wisdom, one should not draw comfort from the conviction that one is at a distance (from one's foe). Far-reaching are the arms of an intelligent man by which he injures when injured. 1 The triple aggregate consists of Virtue, Wealth, and Pleasure. The disadvantages all arise from an injudicious pursuit of each. Virtue stands as an impediment in the way of Wealth ; Wealth stands in the way of Virtue ; and Pleasure stands in the way of both. The inseparable adjuncts of the three, in the case of the vulgar, are that Virtue is practised as a means of Wealth ; Wealth is sought as a means of Pleasure ; and Pleasure is sought for gratifying the senses.

In this connection is cited the old story of the discourse between Viswamitra and the Chandala in a hamlet inhabited by Chandalas. Towards the end of Treta and the beginning of Dwapara, a ftightful drought occurred, extending for twelve years, in consequence of what the gods had ordained. At that time which was the end of Treta and the commence- ment of Dwapara, when the period came for many creatures superan- nuated by age to lay down their lives, the thousand-eyed deity of heaven poured no rain. The planet Vrihaspati began to move in a retrograde course, and Soma, abandoning hisown orbit, receded towards the south. Not even could a dew-drop be seen, what need then be said of clouds gathering together ? The rivers all shrank into narrow streamlets. Everywhere lakes and wells and springs disappeared and lost their beauty in consequence of that order of things which the gods brought about. Water having become scarce, the places set up by charity for its distribution became desolate. 1 The Brahmanas abstained from sacrifices and recitation of the Vedas. They no longer uttered Vashats and performed other propitiatory rites. Agriculture and keep of cattle were given up. Markets and shops were abandond. Stakes for tethering sacrificial animals disappeared. People no longer collected diverse kinds of articles for sacrifices. All festivals and amusements perished. Everywhere heaps of bones were visible and every place re- sounded with the shrill cries and yells of fierce creatures. 2 The cities'and towns of the Earth became empty of inhabitants. Villages and hamlets were burnt down. Some afflicted by robbers, some by weapons, and some by bad kings, and in fear of one another, began to fly away. Temples and places of worship became desolate. They that were aged forcibly turned out of their houses. Kine and goats and sheep and buffaloes fought (for food) and perished in large numbers. The Brahmanas began to die on all sides. Protection was at an end. Herbs and plants were dried up. The Earth became shorn of all her beauty and exceedingly awful like the trees in a crematorium. In that period of terror, when righteousness was nowhere, O Yudhishthira, men in hunger lost their senses and began to eat one another. The very Rishis, giving up their vows and abandoning their fires and deities, and deserting their retreats in woods, began to wander hither and thither (in search of food).

Leaving his wife and son in some place of shelter, the Rishi wandered, fireless 1 and homeless, and regardless of food clean and unclean, One day he came upon a hamlet, in the midst of a forest, inhabited by cruel hunters addicted to the slaughter of living creatures. The little hamlet abounded with broken jars and pots made of earth. Dog-skins were spread here and there. Bones and skulls, gathered in heaps, of boars and asses, lay in different places. Cloths stript from the dead lay here and there, and the huts were adorned with garlands of used up flowers. 2 Many of the habita- tions again were filled with sloughs cast off by snakes. The place resounded with the loud crowing of cocks and hens and the dissonant bray of asses. Here and there the inhabitants disputed with one another, uttering harsh words in shrill voices. Here and there were temples of gods bearing devices of owls and other birds, Resounding with the tinkle of iron bells, the hamlet abounded with canine packs standing or lying on every side, The great Rishi Viswamitra, urged by pangs of hunger and engaged in search after food, entered that hamlet and endeavoured his best to find something to eat. Though the son of Kusika begged repeatedly, yet he failed to obtain any meat or rice or fruit or root or any other kind of food. He then, exclaiming, -Alas, great is the distress that has overtaken me ! fell down from weakness in that hamlet of the Chandalas. The sage began to reflect, saying to himself, What is best for me to do now ? Indeed, O best of kings, the thought that occupied him was of the means by which he could avoid immediate death. He beheld, O king, a large pierce of flesh, of a dog that had recently been slain with a weapon, spread on the floor of a Chandala's hut. The sage reflected and arrived at the conclusion that he should steal that meat- And be said unto himself, I have no means now of sustaining life. Theft is allowable in a season of distress for even an eminent person. It will not detract from his glory. Even a Brahmana for saving his life may do it. This is certain. In the first place oiie should steal from a low person. Failing such a person one may steal from one's equal. Failing an equal, one may steal from even an eminent and righteous man. I shall then, at this time when my life itself is ebbing away, steal this meat. I do not see demerit in such theft. I shall, therefore, rob this haunch of dog's meat. Having formed this re- solutnn, the great sage Viswamitra laid himself down for sleep in that place where the Chandala was. Seeing sometimes after that the night had advanced and that the whole Chandala hamlet had fallen asleep, the holy Viswamitra, quietly rising up, entered that hut.

By having recourse to such understanding one should always preserve his life. A person, if alive, can win religious merit and enjoy happiness and prosperity. For this reason, O son of Kunti, a person of cleansed soul and possessed of learning should live and act in this world, relying upon his own intelli- gence in discriminating between righteousness and its reverse. 1 ' SECTION CXLII \"Yudhishthira said, 'If that which is so horrible and which like falsehood should never be an object of regard, be cited (as duty), then what act is there from which I should forbear ?

One cannot accomplish his course through the world with the aid of a morality that is one-sided. Duty must spring from the understanding ; and the practices of those that are good should always be ascertained, O son of Kuru ! Attend to these words of mine ! Only kings that are possessed of superior intelligence can rule, expecting victory. A king should provide for the observance of morality by the aid of his understanding and guided by knowledge derived from various sources. The duties of a king can never be discharged by rules drawn from a morality that is one-sided. A weak-minded king can never display wisdom (in the discharge of his duties) in consequence of his not having drawn any wisdom from the examples before him.

Having acquired this knowledge, a wise king should, when the occasion comes, act accordingly, aided by his judgment. The acts he does at such a time are misunderstood by ordinary people. Some persons are possessed of true knowledge. Some persons have false knowledge. Truly ascertaining the nature of each kind of knowledge, a wise king derives knowledge from them that are regarded as good. They that are really breakers of morality find fault with the scriptures. They that have themselves no wealth proclaim the inconsistencies of the treatises on the acquisition of wealth. Those who seek to acquire knowledge for the object only of carrying their sustenance by it, O king, are sinful besides being enemies of morality. Wicked men, of immature understandings, can never know things truly, even as persons unconversant with scriptures are unable in all their acts to be guided by reason. With eyes directed to the faults of the scriptures, they decry the scriptures. Even if they understand the true meaning of the scriptures, they are still in the habit of proclaiming that scriptural injunctions are unsound. Such men, by decrying the knowledge of others proclaim the superiority of their own knowledge. They have words for their weapons and words for their arrows and speak as if they are real masters of their sciences. Know, O Bharata, that they are traders in learning and Rakshasas among men. By the aid of mere pre- texts they cast off that morality which has been established by good and wise men. It has been heard by us that the texts of morality are not ro be understood by either discussion or one's own intelligence. Indra himself has said that this is the opinion of the sage Vrihaspati. Some are of opinion that no scriptural text has been laid down without a reason. Others again, even if they properly understand the scriptures, never act according to them. One class of wise men declares that morality is nothing else than the approved course of the world. The man of true knowledge should find out for himself the morality laid down for the good. If even a wise man speaks of morality under the influence of wrath or confusion of understanding or ignorance, his deliverances go for nothing. Discourses on morality made with the aid of an intelligence that is derived from the true letter and spirit of the scriptures, are worthy of praise and not those which are made with the help of .anything else. Even the words heard from an ignorant person, if in themselves they be fraught with sense, come to be regarded as pious and wise. In days of old, Usanas said unto the Daiteyas this truth, which should remove all doubts, that scriptures are no scriptures if they cannot stand the test of reason.

Goat, horse and Kshattriya, were created by Brahman for a similar purpose (viz., for being useful to everybody). A Kshattriya, therefore, should incessantly seek the happiness of all creatures. The sin that attaches to killing a person that should not be killed is equal to that which is incurred by not killing one who deserves to be killed.

Therefore, a king should display severity in making all his subjects observe their respective duties. If this is not done, they will prowl like wolves, devouring one another.

A wicked and terrible fowler, resembling the Destroyer himself, used in days of old to wander through the great forest. He was black as a raven and his eyes were of a bloody hue. He looked like Yama himself. His legs were long, his feet short, his mouth large, and his cheeks protruding. He had no friend, no relative, no kinsman. He had been cast off by them all for the exceedingly cruel life he led. Indeed, a man of wicked conduct should be renounced from a distance by the wise, for he who injures his own self cannot be expected to do good to others.

While yet the rain fell in torrents, the fowler lost his senses through fear. Trembling with cold and agitated with fear, he roved through the forest. The killer of birds failed to find any high spot (which was not under water). The paths of the forest were all submerged. In consequence of the force of the shower, many birds were deprived of life or dropped down on the ground. Lions and bears and other animals, availing of some high spots they had found, lay down to rest. All the denizens of forest were filled with fear in conse- quence of that frightful storm and shower. Frightened and hungry, they roamed through the woods in packs small and large. The fowler, however, with limbs stiffened by cold, could neither stop where he was nor move. While in this state he eyed a she-pigeon lying on the ground, stiffened with cold. The sinful wight, though himself in the same predicament, beholding the bird, picked her up and immured her in a cage. Himself overwhelmed with affliction, he scrupled not to overwhelm a fellow-creature with affliction. Indeed, the wretch, through force of habit alone, committed that sin even a^t such a time. He then beheld in the midst of that forest a lordly tree blue as the clouds. It was the resort of myriads of birds desirous of shade and shelter. It seemed to have been placed there by the Creator for the good of all creatures like a good man in the world. Soon the sky cleared and became spangled with myriads of stars, presenting the aspect of a magnificent lake smiling with blooming lilies. Turning his eyes towards the clear firmament rich with stars, the fowler began to advance, still trembling with cold. Beholding the sky cleared of clouds, he cast his eyes on all sides and seeing that night was already upon him, he began to think, My home is a great distance from where I am ! He then resolved to pass the night under the shade of that tree. Bowing down to it with joined hands, he addressed that monarch of the forest, saying, I am a suppliant for the shelter unto all the deities that have this tree for their resort !

Though overwhelmed with affliction, the man soon fell asleep.\" SECTION CXLIV \"Bhishma said, In one of the branches of that tree, a pigeon with beautiful feathers, O king, lived for many years with his family.

Lake Manasa is on the spot where the Saraswati and the Drisadwati mingle with each other. A person possessed of Vedic knowledge should bathe in these places. Manu has said that liberality is the best of all duties, and that renun- ciation is better than liberality. In this connection is cited the following verse composed by Satyavat. (One should act) as a child full of simplicity and destitute of either merit or sin. As regards all creatures there is in this world neither misery nor happiness. (That which is called misery and that which is called happiness are the results of a diswrought imagination). Even this is the true nature of all living creatures. Of all creatures, their lives are superior who have betaken themselves to renunciation and abstained from acts both meritorious and sinful. I shall now tell thee those acts which are best for a king. By putting forth thy might and liberality do thou conquer heaven, O king I That man who possesses the attributes of might and energy succeeds in attaining to righteousness. 1 Do thou rule Earth, O king, for the sake of the Brahmanas and for the sake of happiness. Thou usedst formerly to condemn the Brahmanas. Do thou gratify them now. Though they have cried fie on thee and though they have deserted thee, do thou still, guid,ed by knowledge of self, solemnly pledge thyself never to injure them ! Engaged in acts proper for thee, seek what is for thy highest good. Amongst rulers some one becomes as cool as snow ; some one, as fierce as fire ; some one becomes like a plough (uprooting all enemies) ; and some one, again, becomes like a thunder-bolt (suddenly scorching his foes). He who wishes to prevent self-destruction should never mix with wicked wights for general or special reasons. From a sinful act committed only once, one may cleanse one's self by repenting for it. From a sinful act committed, twice, one may cleanse one's self by vowing never to commit it again. Ftom such an act committed thrice, one may cleanse one's self by the resolution to bear one's self righteously ever afterwards. By committ- ing such an act repeatedly, one may cleanse one's self by a sojourn to sacred places. One who is desirous of obtaining prosperity should do all that results in blessedness. They who live amidst fragrant odours themselves become fragrant in consequence. They, on the other hand, who live in the midst of foul stench themselves become foul. One devoted to the practice of ascetic penances is soon cleansed of all one's sins. By worshipping the (homa) fire for a year, one stained by diverse sins becomes purified.

One guilty of foeticide becomes cleansed at even a hundred Yojanas from Mahasara, or the tirthas called Pushkara, or Prabhasa, or Manasa on the north, if only one sets out for any of them. 1 A slayer of creatures is cleansed of his sins by saving from imminent peril as many creatures of that particular species as have bean slain by him. Manu has said that by diving in water after thrice reciting the Aghamarshana mantras, one reaps the fruits of the final bath in a Horse-sacrifice. 2 Such an act very soon cleanses one of all one's sins, and one regains in consequence the esteem of the world. All creatures become obedient to such a person, like helpless idiots (obedient to those that surround them). The gods and Asuras, in days of yore, approaching the celestial preceptor Vrihaspati, O king, humbly enquired of him, saying, Thou knowest, O great Rishi, the fruits of virtue, as also the fruits of those other acts that lead to hell in the next world. Does not that person succeed in liberating himself from both merit and sin with whom the two (weal and woe) are equal ? Tell us, O great Ris/u, what the fruits of righteousness are, and how does a righteous person dispel his sins 1 'Vrihaspati answered, If , having committed sin through folly, one does meritorious acts understanding their nature, one succeeds, by such righteousness, in cleansing one's self from sin even as a piece of dirty cloth is washed clean by means of some saline substance. One should not boast after having committed sin. By having recourse to faith and by freeing one's self from malice, one succeeds in obtaining blessedness. That person who covers the faults, even when exposed, of good men, obtains blessedness even after committing faults. As the sun rising at morn dispels and darkness, one dispels all one's sins by acting righteously ' \"Bhishma continued, 'Indrota the son of Sunaka, having said these words unto king Janamejaya, assisted him, by his ministrations, in the performance of the Horse-sacrifice. The king, cleansed of his sins and regaining blessedness, shone with splendour like a blazing fire, and that slayer of foes then entered his kingdom like Soma in his full form entering heaven.' 1 1 Both the vernacular translators hare rendered the second line of verse 25 wrongly. They seem to think that a person by setting out for any of the sacred waters from a distance of a hundred yojanas becomes cleansed. If this meaning be accepted then no man who lives within a hundred yojanas of any of them has any chance of being cleansed. The sense, of course, is that such is the efficacy of these tirthas that a man becomes cleansed by approaching even to a spot within a hundred yojanas of their several sites. -T. 2 These mantras form a part of the morning, noon, and evening prayer of every Brahmana.

Some (amongst his kins- men), exceedingly agitated by grief and indulging in loud lamentations, took up the boy of tender years, that sole wealth of his family. Taking the deceased child they proceeded in the direction of the cremato- rium. Arrived there they began to take the child from one another's breast and cry more bitterly in grief. Recollecting with heavy hearts the former speeches of their darling again and again, they were unable to return home casting the body on the bare ground- Summon- ed by their cries, a vulture came there and said these words : Go ye away and do not tarry, ye that have to cast off but one child!

There was a lordly (Salmali) tree on one of the heights of Himavat. Having grown for many centuries, he had spread out his branches wide around. His trunk also was huge and his twigs and leaves were innu- merable. Under his shade toil-worn elephants in rut, bathed in sweat, used to rest, and many animals of other species also. The circumference of his trunk was four hundred cubits, and dense was the shade of his branches and leaves. Loaded with flowers and fruits, it was the abode of innumerable parrots male and female. In travelling along their routes, caravans of merchants and traders, and ascetic residing in the woods, used to rest under the shade of that delightful monarch of the forest. One day, the sage Narada, O bull of Bharata's race, seeing the wide-extending and innumerable branches of that tree and the circumference of his trunk, approached and addressed him, saying, O, thou art delightful ! O, thou art charming I O foremost of trees, O Salmali, I am always delighted at thy sight I O charming tree, delightful birds of diverse kinds, and elephants and other animals, cheerfully live on thy branches and under their shade !

When the Wind comes in rage, tearing up trees and mountains and other things, I curb his strength by putting forth mine. Indeed, the Wind that breaks many things has himself been repeatedly broken by me. For this reason, O celestial Rishi, I am not afraid of him even when he comes in wrath ! 4 'Narada said, O Salmali, thy protection seems to be thoroughly perverse. There is no doubt in this.

Even when possessed of equal might, people do not suddenly wage hostilities with those that have injured them. On the other hand, they display their might gradually, O king !

In such cases the intelligence of the intelligent man pene- trates (the subject upon which it is employed) like fire penetrating a heap of dry grass. Intelligence is the most precious possession that a person can have. Similarly, O king, a man can have nothing here more valuable than might.

In life, men are unable, whether infants or youths or men, to abandon covetousness. Such is the nature of covetousness that never decays even with the decay of life. Like the ocean that can never be filled by the constant discharge of even innumerable rivers of immeasurable depths, covetousness is incapable of being gratified by acquisitions to any extent. The covetousness, however, which is never gratified by acquisitions and satiated by the accomplishment of desires, that which is not known in its real nature by the gods, the Qandharvas, the Asuras, the great snakes, and, in fact, by all classes of beings, that irresistible passion, along with that folly which invites the heart to the unrealities of the world, should ever be conquered by a person of cleansed soul. Pride, malice, slander, crookedness, and incapacity to hear other people's good, are vices, O descendant of Kuru, that are to be seen in persons of uncleansed soul under the domination of covetous- ness.

Of low minds, they rob the world, setting up (if need be) the standard of religion and virtue. Relying upon the strength of apparent reasons, they create diverse kinds of schisms in religion. Intent upon accom- plishing the purposes of cupidity, they destroy the ways of righteousness. When wicked-souled persons under the domination of covetousness apparently practise the duties of righteousness, the consequence that results is that the desecrations committed by them soon become current among men. Pride, wrath, arrogance, insensibility, paroxysms of joy and sorrow, and self-importance, all these, O descendant of Kuru, are to be seen in persons swayed by covetousness.

Do thou, therefore, always wait upon them and seek instruc- tion from them. They never acquire virtue, O Yudhishthira, for the sake of wealth or of fame. They acquire it, on the other hand, because it is a duty like that of cherishing the body. Fear, wrath, restlessness, and sorrow do not dwell in them.

It rises with the rise of cove- tousness. Manifold again is the course that it takes. The root of cove- tousness is loss of judgment. Loss of judgment, again, is its inseparable attribute. Eternity is ignorance's course. The time when ignorance appear is when objects of covetousness are not won. From one's ignor- ance proceeds covatousness, and from the latter proceeds ignorance.

Truth has been said to be Sacrifice of a high order. 1 Everything rests upon Truth. I shall now tell thee the forms of Truth one after another, and its indications also in due order. It behoveth thee to hear also as to how Truth may be acquired. Truth, O Bharata, as it exists in all the world, is of thirteen kinds. The forms that Truth assumes are impartiality, self-control, forgiveness, modesty. 1 J.a., both are equally efficacious. T. 4ft"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"378 MABABHARATA endurance, goodness, renunciation, contemplation, dignity, fortitude, compassion, and abstention from injury. These, O great monarch, are the thirteen forms of Truth ! Truth is immutable, eternal, and un- changeable. It may be acquired through practices which do not militate with any of the other virtues. It may also be acquired through Yopa. When desire and aversion, as also lust and wrath, are destroyed, that attribute in consequence of which one is able to look upon one's own self and one's foe, upon one's good and one's evil, with an unchanging eye, is called impartiality. Self-control consists in never wishing for another man's possessions, in gravity and patience and capacity to allay the fears of others in respect to one's own self, and immunity from disease. It may be acquired through knowledge. Devotion to the prac- tice of liberality and the observance of all duties are regarded by the wise as constituting goodwill. One comes to acquir universal good- will by constant devotion to truth. As regards unforgiveness and for- giveness, it should be stated that the attribute through which an es- teemed and good man endures both what is agreeable and disagreeable, is said to be forgiveness. This virtue may well be acquired through the practice of truthfulness. That virtue in consequence of which an intelligent man, contented in mind and speech, achieves many good deeds and never incurs the censure of others, is called modesty. It is acquired through the aid of righteousness. That virtue which forgives for the sake of virtue and profit is called endurance. It is a form of for- giveness. It is acquired through patience, and its purpose is to attach people to one's self. The casting off of affections as also of all earthly possessions, is called renunciation. Renunciation can never be ac- quired except by one who is divested of wrath and malice. That virtue in consequence of which one does good, with wrathfulness and care, to all creatures is called goodness. It hath no particular shape and con- sists in the divestment of all selfish attachments. That virtue owing to which one remains unchanged in happiness and misery is called forti- tude. That wise man who desires his own good always practises this virtue. One should always practise forgiveness and deyotedness to truth. That man of wisdom who succeeds in casting off joy and fear and wrath, succeeds in acquiring fortitude. Abstention from injury as regards all creatures in thought, word, and deed, kindness, and gift, are the eternal duties of those who are good. These thirteen attributes, though apparently distinct from one another, have but one and the same form, viz., Truth. All these, O Bharata, support Truth and strengthen it. It is impossible, O monarch, to exhaust the merits of Truth. It is for these reasons that the Brahmanas, the Pitris, and the gods, applaud Truth. There is no duty which is higher than Truth, and no sin more heinous than untruth. Indeed, Truth is the very foundation of righteousness. For this reason one should never destroy Truth. From Truth proceed gifts, and sacrifice with presents, as well as the threefold Agnihotras, the Vedas, and everything else that leads to righteousness. Once on a time a thousand Horse-sacrifices and Truth were weighed against each other in the balance. Truth weighed heavier than a thousand Horse-sacrifices.'

Every mortal, O foremost of men, should always know this. I shall now speak to thee of their origin, of the objects upon which they rest, and of the means of their destruction, O lord of Earth ! Listen, first, O king, with undi- vided attention, to the origin of wrath truly and in detail ! Wrath springs from covetousness. It is strengthened by the faults of others. Through forgiveness it remains dormant, and through forgiveness it disappears. As regards lust, it springs from resolution. Indulgence strengthens it. When the man of wisdom resolutely turns away from it, it disappears and dies. Envy of others proceeds from between wrath and covetousness. It disappears in consequence of compassion and knowledge of self. In consequence of compassion for all creatures, and of that disregard for all worldly objects (that knowledge brings in its train), it disappears. It also arises from seeing the faults of other people. But in men of intellgence it quickly disappears in consequence of true knowledge- 1 Loss of judgment has its origin in ignorance and proceeds from sinfulness of habit. When the man whom this fault assails begins to take delight in (the company and counsels of) wise men, the vice at once and immediately hides its head. Men, O thou of Kuru's race, see conflicting scriptures. From that circumstance springs the desire for diverse kinds of action. When true Knowledge has been gained, that desire is allayed. The grief of an embodied crea- ture proceeds from affection which is awakened by separation. When, however, one learns that the dead do not return (whatever the grief one may feel for them), it subsides. Incapacity to bear other people's good proceeds from wrath and covetousness. Though compassion for every creature and in consequence of a disregard for all earthly objects, it is extinguished. Malice proceeds from the abandonment of truth and indulgence in wickedness. This vice, O child, disappears in conse- quence of one's waiting upon the wise and good. Pride, in men, springs from birth, learning, and prosperity. When those three, however, are truly known, that vice instantly disappears. Jealousy springs from 1 In the Bengal texts, verse 9 is a triplet.

That sentiment disappears when one understands the strength of virtue. 1 Covetousness in all creatures spring from ignorance.

As regards those that have fallen away (in consequence of their sinful deeds) from the status of Brahman, uncooked food should be given to them outside the limits of the sacrificial altar. 3 The Brahmanas are the Vedas themselves and all the Sacrifices with large presents. Desirous of excelling one another, they always perform sacrifices, impelled by their virtuous inclinations. The king should, therefore, make presents of diverse kinds of valuable wealth unto them. That Brahmana who hath a sufficiency of stores for feeding his family for three or more years, deserves to drink the /Soma. 4 If notwithstanding 1 In India, from the remotest times, preceptors are excluded from charging their pupils any fees for the instruction they give.

The Sudra has no competence for performing a sacrifice. The king should, there- fore, take away (wealth for such a purpose) from a Sudra house of ours. 1 The king should also, without any scruple, take away from their kinsmen the wealth of him who does not perform sacrifices though possessed of a hundred kine and also of him who abstains from sacrifices though possessed of a thousand kine. The king should always publicly take away the wealth of such a person as does not practise charity, By acting in this way the king earns great merit. Listen again to me. That Brahmana who has been forced by want to abstain from six meals, 2 may take away without permission, according to the rule of a person that cares only for today without any thought of the morrow, only what is necessary for a single meal, from the husking tub or the field or the garden or any other place of even a man of low pursuits. He should, however, whether asked or unasked, inform the king of his act. 3 If the king be conversant with duty he should not inflict any punishment upon such a Brahmana. He should remem- ber that a Brahmana becomes afflicted with hunger only through the fault of the Kshattriya. 4 Having ascertained a Brahmana's learning and behaviour, the king should make a provision for him, and protect him as a father protects the son of his own loins. On the expiry of every year, one should perform the Vaisyanara sacrifice (if he is unable to perform any animal or Soma sacrifice). They who are conversant with religion say that the practice of an act laid down in the alternative, is not destructive of virtue.

Comparing again the energy of a Brahmana with that of the king, the former will always be found to be superior to the latter. For this reason the energy of the Brahmanas can scarcely be borne or resisted by a king. The Brahmana is said to be creator, ruler, ordainer, and god. No word of abuse, no dry speeches, should be addressed to a Brahmana. The Kshattriya should cross all his difficulties by the aid of the might of his arms. The Vaisya and the Sudra should conquer their difficulties by wealth; the Brahmana should do so by Mantras and homa. None of these, viz., a maiden, a youthful woman, a person unacquainted with mantras, an ignorant wight, or one that is impure, is competent to pour libations on the sacrificial fire. If any of these do so, he or she is sure to fall into hell, with him for whom they act. For this reason, none but a Brahmana conversant with the Vedas and skilled in all sacrifices should become the pourer of sacrificial libations. They who are conversant with the scriptures say that man who, having kindled the sacrificial fire, does not give away the dedicated food as Dakshina, is not the kindler of a sacrificial fire. A person should, with his senses under control, and with proper devotion, do all the acts of merit (indicated in the scriptures). One should never worship the deities in sacrifices in which no Dakshina is given. A sacrifice not com- pleted with Dakshina, (instead of producing merit) brings about the des^ truction of one's children, animals, and heaven. Such a sacrifice des- troys also the senses, the fame, the achievements, and the very period of life, that one has. Those Brahmanas that lie with women in their season, or who never perform sacrifices, or whose families have no members conversant with the Vedas, are regarded as Sudras in act. 1 That Brahmana who, having married a Sudra girl, resides for twelve continuous years in a village has only a well for its water supply, becomes a Sudra in act. That Brahmana who summons to his bed an unmarried maiden, or suffers a Sudra, thinking him worthy of respect, to sit upon the same carpet with him, should sit on a bed of dry grass behind some Kshattriya or Vaisya and give him respect in that fashion. 2 It is by this manner that he can be cleansed. Listen, O king, to my words on this subject. The sin that a Brahmana commits in a single night by respectfully serving a member of a lower order or by sporting with him in the same spot or on the same bed, is cleansed by observing the practice of sitting behind a Kshattriya or a Vaisya on a bed of dry grass for three continuous years.

A woman that is the ornament of her sex may be taken (for wife) from even a vile race. Amrita, if extracted from poison, may be quaffed ; women, jewels and other valuables, and water, can never, according to the scriptures, be impure or unclean. For the benefit of Brahmanas and kine, and on occasions of transfusion of castes, even a Vaisya may take up weapons for his own safety. Drinking alcoholic liquors, killing a Brahmana, and the violation of the preceptor's bed, are sins that, if committed consciously, have no expiation. The only expiation laid down for them is death. The same may be said of stealing gold, and the theft of a Brahmana's property. By drinking alcoholic liquors, by having congress with one with whom congress is prohibited, by mingling with a fallen person, and (a person of any of the other three orders) by having congress with a Brahmani woman, one becomes inevitably fallen. By mixing with a fallen person for one whole year in such matters as ofBciation in sacrifices and teaching sexual congress, one be- comes fallen. One. however, does not become so by mixing with a fallen person in such matters as riding on the same vehicle, sitting on same seat, and eating in the same line. Excluding the five grave sins that have been mentioned above, all other sins have expiations provided for them. Expiating those sins according to the ordinances laid down for them, one should not again indulge in them. In the case of those who have been guilty of the first three of these five sins, (vi*., drinking alcoholic liquors, killing a Brahmana, and violation of the preceptor's bed), there is no restriction for their (surviving) kinsmen about taking food and wearing ornaments, even if their funeral rites remain unper- formed when they die. The surviving kinsmen should make no scruple about such things on such occasions. A virtuous man should, in the observance of his duties, discard his very friends and reverend seniors- In fact, until they perform expiation, they that are virtuous should not even talk with those sinners. 1 A man that has acted sinfully destroys his sin by acting virtuously afterwards and by penances.

If a person strike a Brahmana with a weapon, he will have to live in hell for as many years as the grains of dust that are soaked by the blood flowing from the wounded. One guilty of foeticide becomes cleansed if he dies of wounds received in battle fought for the sake of kine and Brahmanas. He may also be cleansed by casting his person on a blazing fire. 1 A drinker of alcoholic liquors becomes cleansed by drinking hot alcohol. His body being burnt with that hot drink, he is cleansed through death in the other world. 2 A Brahmana stained by such a sin obtains regions of felicity by such a course and not by any other. For violating the bed of a preceptor, the wicked-souled and sinful wretch becomes cleansed by the death that results from embracing a heated female figure of iron. Or, cutting off his organ and testicles and bear- ing them in .his hands, he should go on in a straight course towards the south-west and then cast off his life.

He should even adopt such a course, devoted to penance and leading the life of an ascetic. Even such is the expiation provided for one who slays a woman quick with child, knowing her condition. The man knowingly slays such a woman incurs double the sin that follows from Brahmanicide. A drinker of alcoholic liquor should live on frugal fare, practising Brahmacharyya vows, and sleep on the bare ground, and perform, more than three years the sacrifice next to the Agmshtoma.

I shall now tell thee of other kinds of expiations in their order. For all minor sins one should repent or practise some vow for one year. For congress with the wife of a Brahmana conversant with the Vedas, one should for three years practise the vow of Brahmacharyya, taking a little food at the fourth part of the day. For congress with any other woman (who is not one's wife), one should practise similar penances for two years. For taking delight in a woman's company by sitting with her on the same spot or on the same seat, one should live only on water for three days. By doing this he may cleanse himself of his sin. The same is laid down for one who befouls a blazing fire (by throwing impure things on it). He who, without adequate cause, casts off his sire or mother or preceptor, surely becomes fallen, O thou of Kuru's race, as the conclusion is of the scriptures. Only food and clothes should be given, as the injunction is, unto a wife guilty of adultery or one confined in a prison. Indeed, the vows that are laid down for a male person guilty of adultery should be caused to be observed by also a woman who is guilty of the same. That woman who abandoning a husband of a superior caste, has congress with a vile person (of a lower order), should be caused by the king to be devoured by dogs in a public place in the midst of a large concourse of spectators. 1 A wise king should cause the male person committing adultery under such circumstances to be placed upon a heated bed of iron and then, placing faggots underneath, burn the sinner thereon. The same punishment, O king, is provided for the woman that is guilty of adultery. The wicked sinner who does not perform expiation within a year of the commission of the sin incurs demerit that is double of what attaches to the original sin. One who associates with such a person for two years must wander over the Earth, devoting himself to penances and living upon eleemosynary charity. One associating with a sinner for four years should adopt such a mode of life for five years. 2 If a younger brother weds before his elder brother, then the younger brother, the elder brother and the woman that is married, all \"three, in consequence of such wedding, become fallen. All of them should observe the vows prescribed for a person who has neglected his sacrificial fire, or practise the vow of Chandrayana for a month, or some other painful vow, for cleansing themselves of their sin. The younger brother, wedding, should give his wife unto his unmarried elder brother. Afterwards, having obtained the permission of the elder brother, the younger brother may take back his wife.

In his own proper time the Grandsire (of the universe) took his birth. He then created wind and fire, and the sun also of great energy. He also created the sky, the heavens, the nether regions, Earth, the directions, the firmament with the moon and the stars, the constellations, the planets, the year, the seasons, the months, the two fortnights (lighted and dark) and the smaller divisions of time. The divine Grandsire then, assuming a visible form, begot (by power of his will) some sons possessed of great energy. They are the sages Marichi, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Vasishtha, Angiras, and the mighty and puissant lord Rudra, and Prachetas. The last begat Daksha, who, in his turn, begat sixty daughters. All those daughters were taken by regenerate sages for the object of begetting children upon them. From them sprang all the creatures of the universe, including the gods, Pitris, Qandharvas, Apsaras, diverse kinds of Rakshasas, birds and animals and fishes, monkeys, great snakes, and diverse species of fowl that range the air or sport on the water, and vegetables, and all beings that are oviparous or viviparous or born of filth. In this way the whole universe consisting of mobile and immobile creatures sprang into existence. The universal Grandsire, having thus evoked into existence all mobile and immobile creatures, then promulgated the eternal reli- gion laid down in the Vedas. Tint religion was accepted by the gods, with their preceptors and priests, the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the Saddhyas. the Maruts, the Asu/ms, Bhrigu, Atri, Angiras, the Siddhas, Kasyapa rich in penances, Vasishtha, Gautama, Agastya, Narada, Paravata, the Valkhillya Rishis, those other Rishis known under the names of Prabhasas, the Sikatas, the G/iritaf>as, the Somavayavyas, the Vaiswanaras, the Marichipas, the Akrishtas, the Hansas, thoj-e born of Fire, the Vanaprasthas, and the Prasnis. All of them lived in obedience to Brahman. The foremost of the Danavas, however, setting at naught the commands of the Grandsire, and yielding to wrath and covetousness, began to cause the destruction of righteousness. They were Hiranyakasipu, and Hiranyaksha, and Virochana, and Samvara, and Viprachitti, and Prahlada, and Namuchi, and Vali. These and many other Daityas and Danavas, transcending all restraints of duty and religion, sported and took delight in all kinds of wicked acts. Regarding themselves equal in point of birth with the gods, they began to challenge them and the sages of pure behaviour. They never did 1 Nilakantha explains that the question of Nakula excited the heart of Bhishma and caused a flow of blood through his wounds. Henoe Bhishma compares himself to a hill of red ohalk.

Disregarding the three well-known means, they began to persecute and afflict all creatures by wielding only the rod of chastisement. Indeed, those foremost of Asuras, filled with pride, forsook every friendly intercourse with other creatures. Then the divine Brahman, accompanied by the regenerate sages, proceeded to a delightful summit of Himavat, extending fora hundred Yojanas in area, adorned with diverse kinds of jewels and gems, and upon whose surface the stars seemed to rest like so many lotuses on a lake. On that prince of mountains, O sire, overgrown with forests of flowering trees, that foremost of the gods, viz., Brahman, stayed for sometime for accom- plishing the business of the world. After the lapse of a thousand years, the puissant lord arrangements for a grand sacrifice according to the ordinances laid down in the scriptures. The sacrificial altar became adorned with Rishis skilled in sacrifice and competent to perform all acts appertaining thereto, with faggots of sacrificial fuel, and with blazing fires. And it looked exceedingly beautiful in consequence of the sacrificial plates and vessels having been all made of gold. All the foremost ones among the gods took their seats on it. The platform was further adorned with Sadasyas all of whom consisted of high regenerate Rishis. I have heard from the Rishis that soon something very awful occurred in that sacrifice. It is heard that a creature sprang (from the sacrificial fire) scattering the flames around him, and whose splendour equalled that of the Moon himself when he rises in the firmament spangled with stars. His complexion was dark like that of the petals of the Iblue lotus. His teeth were keen. His stomach was lean. His stature was tall. He seemed to be irresistible and possessed of exceed- ing energy. Upon the appearance of that being, the Earth trembled. The Ocean became agitated with mountain billows and awful eddies. Meteors foreboding great disasters, shot through the sky. The branches of trees began to fall down. All the points of the compass became unquiet. Inauspicious winds began to blow. All creatures began to quake with fear every moment. Beholding that awful agitation of the universe and th it Being sprung from the sacrificial fire, the Grandsire said these words unto the great Rishis, the gods, and the Qandharvas I This Being was thought of by me. Possessed of great energy, his name is Asi (sword or scimitar) For the protection of the world and the destruction of the enemies of the gods, I have created him ! That being then, abandoning the form he had first assumed, took the shape of^i sword of great splendour, highly polished, sharp-edged, risen like the all-destructive Being at the end of the Yuga. Then Brahman made over that sharp weapon to the blue-throated Rudra who has for the device on his banner the foremost of bulls, for enabling him to put down irreligion and sin. At this, the divine Rudra of immeasurable soul, praised by the great RisHis, took up that sword and assumed a"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"390 MAHABHABAtA different shape. Putting forth four arms, he became so tall that though standing on the Earrh he touched the very sun with his head. With eyes turned upwards, and with every limb extended wide, he began to vomit flames of fire from his mouth. Assuming diverse complexions such as blue and white and red, wearing a black deer-skin studed with stars of gold, he bore on his forehead a third eye that resembled the sun in splendour. His two other eyes, one of which was black and other tawny, shone very brightly. The divine Mahadeva, the bearer of the SuZa, the tearer of Bhaga's eyes, taking up the sword whose splendour resembled that of the all-destructive Yuga fire, and wielding a large shield with !three high bosses which looked like a mass of dark clouds adorned with flashes of lightning, began to perform diverse kinds of evolutions. Possessed of great prowess, he began to whirl the sword in the sky, desirous of an encounter. Loud were the roars he uttered, and awful the sound of his laughter. Indeed, O Bharata, the form then assumed by Rudra was exceedingly terrible. Hearing that Rudra had assumed that form for achieving fierce deeds, the Danavas, filled with joy, began to come towards him with great speed, showering huge rocks upon him as they came, and blazing brands of wood, and diverse kinds of terrible weapons made of iron and each endued with the sharpness of a razor. The Danava host, however, beholding that foremost of all beings, the indestructible Rudra, swelling with might, became stupefied and began to tremble. Although Rudra was alone and single-handed, yet so quickly did he move on the field of battle with the sword in his arm that the Asuras thought there were a thousand similar Rudras battling with them. Tearing and piercing and afflicting and cutting and lopping off and grinding down, the great god moved with celerity among the thick masses of his foes like forest-conflagration amid heaps of dry grass spread around. The mighty Asuras, broken by the god with the whirls of his sword, with arms and thighs and chests cut off and pierced, and with heads severed from their trunks, began to fall down on the Earth. Others among the Danavas, afflicted with strokes of the sword, broke and fled in all directions, cheering one another as they fled. Some penetrated into the bowels of the Earth ; others got under the cover of mountains. Some went upwards ; others entered the depths of the sea. During the progress of that dreadful and fierce battle, the Earth became miry with flesh and blood and horrible sights presented themselves on every side. Strewn with the fallen bodies of Danavas covered with blood, the Earth looked as if overspread with mountain summits overgrown with Kinsukas. Drenched with gore, the Earth looked exceedingly beautiful, like a fair-complxioned lady intoxi- cated with alcohol and attired in crimson robes. Having slain the Danavas and re-established Righteousness on Earth, the auspicious Rudra cast off his awful form and assumed his own beneficent shape. Then all the Rishis and all the celestials adored that god of gods with"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"BANTI PABVA 391 loud acclamations wishing him victory. The divine Rudra, after this, gave the sword, that protector of religion, dyed with the blood of Danavas, unto Vishnu with due adorations. Vishnu gave it unto Marichi. The divine Marichi gave it unto all the great Rishis. The latter gave it to Vasava. Vasava gave it to the Regents of the world. The Regents, O son, gave that large sword to Manu the son of Surya. At the time of giving it unto Manu, they said, Thou art the lord of all men ! Protect all creatures with this sword containing religion within its womb. Duly meting out chastisement unto those that have trans- gressed the barriers of virtue for the sake of the body or the mind, they should be protected conformably to the ordinances but never according to caprice. Some should be punished with wordy rebukes, and with fines and forfeitures. Loss of limb or death should never be inflicted for slight reasons. These punishments, consisting of wordy rebukes as their first, are regarded as so many forms of the sword. These are the shapes that the sword assumes in consequence of the transgressions of persons under the protection (of the king). 1 In time Manu installed his own son Kshupa in the sovereignty of all creatures, and gave him the sword for their protection. From Kshupa it was taken by Ikshaku, and from Ikshaku by Pururavas. From Pururavas it was taken by Ayus, and from Ayus by Nahusha. From Nahusha it was taken by Yayati, and from Yayati by Puru. From Puru it was taken by Amurttarya. From Amurttarya it descended to the royal Bhumisaya. From Bhumisaya it was taken by Dushmanta's son Bharata. From Bharata, O monarch, it was taken by the righteous Ailavila. From Ailavila it was taken by king Dhundumara. From Dhundumara it was taken by Kamvoja, and from Kamvoja it was taken by Muchukunda. From Muchukunda it was taken by Marutta, and from Marutta by Raivata. From Raivata it was taken by Yuvanaswa, and from Yuva- naswa by Raghu. From Raghu it was taken by the valiant Harinaswa. From Harinaswa the sword was taken by Sunaka, and from Sunaka by the righteous-souled Usinara. From the last it was taken by the Bhojas and the Yadavas. From the Yadus it was taken by Sivi. From Sivi it descended to Pratarddana. From Pratarddana it was received by Ashtaka, and from Ashtaka by Prishadaswa. From Prishadaswa it was received by Bharadwaja, and from the last by Drona. After Drona it was taken by Kripa. From Kripa that best of swords has been obtained by thee with thy brothers. The constellation under which the sword was born is Kritika. Agni is its deity, and Rohini is its Qotra. 2 Rudra is its high preceptor. The sword has eight names which are not generally known. Listen to me as I mention them to you.

It was with the aid of this weapon that that son of Vena, while he govern ed the Earth virtuously for many years, milked her of crops and grain in profusion. It behoveth thee, O son of Madri, to regard what the Rishis have said, as conclusive proof. All persons skilled in -Battle should worship the sword.

By listening to this excellent story of the origin of the sword, a man succeeds in winning fame in this world and eternal elicity in the next.\" SECTION CLXVII Vaisampayana said, \"When Bhishma, after having said this, became silent, Yudhishthira (and the others) returned home. The king addressing his brothers with Vidura forming the fifth, said, 'The course of the world rests upon Virtue, Wealth, and Desire. Amongst these three, which is the foremost, which the second, and which the last, in point of importance ? For subduing the triple aggregate (vis., lust, wrath, and covetousness), upon which of the first three (vk., Virtue, Wealth, and Desire) should the mind be fixed ? It behoveth you all to cheerfully answer this question in words that are true !' Thus addressed by the Kuru chief, Vidura, who was conversant with the science of Profit, with the course of the world, and with truth (that concerns the real nature of things), and possessed of great brilliancy of intellect, spoke first these words, recollecting the contents of the scriptures. \"Vidura said, 'Study of the various scriptures, asceticism, gift, faith, performance of sacrifices, forgiveness, sincerity of disposition, compassion, truth, self-restraint, these constitute of possessions of Virtue. Do thou adopt Virtue. Let not thy heart ever turn away from it ! Both Virtue and Profit have their roots in these. I think that all these are capable of being included in one term. It is by Virtue that the Rishis have crossed (the world with all its difficulties). It is upon Virtue that all the worlds depend (for their existence). It is by Virtue that the gods attained to their position of superiority. It is upon Virtue that Profit or Wealth rests. Virtue, O king, is foremost in point of merit-. Profit is said to be middling. Desire, it is said by the wise, is the lowest of the three. For this reason, one should live with restrained soul, giving his attention to Virtue most. One should also behave towards all creatures as he should towards himself.' \" Vaisampayana continued, \"After Vidura had finished what he"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"SANTI PABVA &93 had to say, Pritha's son Arjuna, well-skilled in the science of Profit, and conversant also with the truths of both Virtue and Profit, urged on (by the drift of Yudhishthira's question), said these words. \"Arjuna said, This world, O king, is the field of action. Action, therefore, is applauded here. Agriculture, trade, keep of cattle, and diverse kinds of arts, constitute what is called Profit. Profit, again, is the end of all such acts. Without Profit or Wealth, both Virtue and (the objects of) Desire cannot be won. This is the declaration of the Sruti. Even persons of uncleansed souls, if possessed of diverse kinds of Wealth, are able to perform the highest acts of virtue and gratify desires that are apparently difficult of being gratified. Virtue and Desire are the limbs of Wealth as the Sruti declares. With the acquisi- tion of Wealth, both Virtue and the objects of Desire may be won. Like all creatures worshipping Brahman, even persons of superior birth worship a man possessed of Wealth. Even they that are attired in deer-skins and bear matted locks on their heads, that are self-restrained, that smear their bodies with mire, that have their senses under complete control, even they that have bald heads and that are devoted Brahmacharins, and that live separated from one another, cherish a desire for Wealth. Others attired in yellow robes, bearing long beards, graced with modesty, possessed of learning, contented, and freed from all attachments, become desirous of Wealth. Others, following the practices of their ancestors, and observant of their respective duties, and others desirous of heaven, do the same. Believers and unbelievers and those that are rigid practicers of the highest Yoga all certify to the excellence of Wealth. 1 He is said to be truly possessed of Wealth who cherishes his dependants with objects of enjoyment, and afflicts his foes with punishments. Even this, O foremost of intelligent men, is truly my opinion. Listen, however, now to these two ( viz., Nakula and Sahadeva) who are about to speak !' ' Vaisampayana continued, \"After Arjuna had ceased, the two sons of Madri, viz., Nakula and Sahadeva, said these words of high import. \"Nakula and Sahadeva said, 'Sitting or lying, walking and stand- ing, one should strive after the acquisition of Wealth even by the most vigorous of means. If Wealth, which is difficult of acquisition and highly agreeable, be earned, the person that has earned it, without doubt, is seen to obtain all the objects of Desire. That Wealth which is connected with Virtue, as also that Virtue which is connected with Wealth, is certainly like nectar. 2 For this reason our opinions are as follows. A person without wealth cannot gratify any desire; similarly, there can be no Wealth in one that is destitute of Virtue. He, there- 1 The second line of 19 is unintelligible.

For this reason, one should seek the acquisition of Wealth with a devoted mind, without disregarding the requirements of Virtue. They who believe in (the wisdom of) this saying succeed in acquiring whatever they desire. One should first practise Virtue ; next acquire Wealth without sacrificing Virtue ; and then seek the grati- fication of Desire ; for this should be the last act of one who has been successful in acquiring Wealth. 1 ' Vaisampayana continued, \"The twin sons of the Aswins, after having said these words, remained silent. Then Bhimasena began to gay the following. \"Bhimasena said, 'One without Desire never wishes for Wealth. One without Desire never wishes for Virtue. One who is destitute of Desire can never feel any wish. For this reason, Desire is the foremost of all the three. It is under the influence of Desire that the very Rishts devote themselves to penances subsisting upon fruits, or living upon roots or air only. Others possessed of Vedic lore are engaged upon the Vedas and their branches or upon rites of faith and sacrificial acts, or upon making gifts or accepting them. Traders, agriculturists, keepers of cattle, artists and artizans, and those who are employed in rites of pro- pitiation, all act from Desire. Some there are that dive into the depths of the ocean, induced by Desire. Desire, indeed, takes various forms. Everything is pervaded by the principle of Desire. A man outside the pale of Desire never is, was, or will be, seen in this world. This, O king, is the truth. Both Virtue and Wealth are based upon Desire. As butter represents the essence of curds, even so is Desire the essence of Profit and Virtue. Oil is better than oil-seeds. Ghee is better than sour milk. Flowers and fruits are better than wood. Similarly, Desire is better than Virtue and Profit. As honeyed juice is extracted from flowers, so is Desire said to be extracted from these two. Desire is the parent of Virtue and Profit. Desire is the soul of these two. Without Desire the Brahmanas would never give either sweets or wealth unto Brabmanas. Without Desire the diverse kinds of action that are seen in the world would never have been seen. For these reasons, Desire is seen to be the foremost of the triple aggregate. Approaching beauti- ful damsels attired in excellent robes, adorned with every ornament, and exhilarated with sweet wines, do thou sport with them. Desire, O king, should be the foremost of the three with us ! Reflecting upon the question to its very roots, I have come to this conclusion. Do not hesitate to accept this conclusion, O son of Dharma ! These words of mine are not of hollow import. Fraught with righteousness as they are they will be acceptable to all good men. Virtue, Profit, and Desire should all be equally attended to. That man who devotes himself to only one of them is certainly not a superior person. He is said to be middling who devotes himself to only two of them. He, on the other"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"SANTI PARVA a95 hand, is the best of his species who attends to all the three. Having said these words in brief as also in detail, unto those heroes, Bhima possessed of wisdom, surrounded by friends, smeared with sandal-paste, and adorned with excellent garlands and ornaments, remained silent. 1 Then king Yudhishthira the just, that foremost of virtuous men, possessed of great learning, properly reflecting for a while upon the words spoken by all of them, and thinking all those speeches to be false-philosophy, himself spoke as follows. \"Yudhishthira said, 'Without doubt, all of you have settled conclusions in respect of the scriptures, and all of you are conversant with authorities. These words fraught with certainty that you have spoken have been heard by me* Listen now, with concentrated atten- tion, to what I say unto you. He who is not employed in merit or in sin, he who does not attend to Profit, or Virtue, or Desire, who is above all faults, who regards gold and a brick-bat with equal eyes, becomes liberated from pleasure and pain and the necessity of accomplishing his purposes. All creatures are subject to birth and death. All are liable to waste and change. Awakened repeatedly by the diverse benefits and evils of life, all of them applaud Emancipation. We do not know, however, what Emancipation is. The Self-born and divine Brahman has said that there is no Emancipation for him who is bound with ties of attachment and affection. They, however, that are possessed of learning seek Extinction. For this reason, one should never regard anything as either agreeable or disagreeable. 2 This view seems to be the best. No one in this world can act as he pleases. I act precisely as I am made (by a superior power) to act. The great Ordainer makes all creatures proceed as He wills. The Ordainer is Supreme. Know this, all of you. 8 No one can, by his acts, obtain what is unobtainable. That which is to be, takes place. Know this- And since who has withdrawn himself from the triple aggregate may succeed in winning Emancipation it seems, therefore, that Emancipation is productive of the highest i t 11 good ! 1 In the Bengal texts, 4:1 is made a triplet, and 42 is made to consist of a single line ; 42 again is represented as Vaisampay ana's speech. This is evidently an error ; 41 a couplet. 42 also is so. \"Rajna &c., refer to Bhima. K.P. Singha avoids the error ; the Burdwan translator, as usual, makes a mess of 41 by taking it to be a triplet. T. 2 There can be very little doubt that the second line has a distinct reference to the principal article of faith in Buddhism. Emancipation here is identified with Extinction or Annihilation. The word used is Nirvana. The advice given is abstention from attachments ol every kind.

There was a certain Brahmana belonging to the middle country. He was destitute of Vedic learning. (One day), beholding a prosperous village, the man entered it from desire of obtaining charity . v In that village lived a robber possessed of great wealth, conversant with the distinctive features of all the orders (of men), devoted to the Brahma- nas, firm in truth, and always engaged in making gifts. Repairing to the abode of that robber, the Brahmana begged for alms. Indeed, he solicited a house to live in and such necessaries of life as would last for one year. Thus solicited by the Brahmana, the robber gave him a piece of new cloth with its ends complete, 2 and a widowed woman possessed of youth. Obtaining all those things from the robber, the Brahmana became filled with delight. Indeed, Gautama began to live happily in that commodious house which the robber assigned to him. He began to help the relatives and kinsmen of the female slave he had got from the robber chief. In this way he lived for many years in that prosperous village of hunters. He began to practise with great devo- tion the art of achery. Every day, like the other robbers residing there, Gautama, O king, went into the woods and slaughtered wild cranes in abundance. Always engaged in slaughtering living creatures, he became well-skilled in that act and soon bade farewell to compassion. In consequence of his intimacy with robbers he became one like one of 1 The true reading is Brahmavarfjitah and not 'that word in the accusative.

Living happily in that robber village for many months, large was the number of wild cranes that he slew. One day another Brahmana came to that village. He was dressed in rags and deer-skins and bore matted locks on his head. Of highly pure behaviour, he was devoted to the study of the Vedas. Of a humble disposition, frugal in fare, devot- ed to theBrahmanas, thoroughly conversant with the Vedas, and obser- vant of Brahmacharyya vows, that Brahmana had been a dear friend of Gautama and belonged to that part of the country from which Gau- tama had emigrated. In course of his wanderings, as already said, the Brahmana came to that robber village where Gautama had taken up his abode. He never accepted any food if given by a Sudra and, therefore, began to search for the house of a Brahmana there (for accepting the duties of hospitality). 1 Accordingly he wandered in every direction in that village teeming with robber-families. At last that foremost cf Brahmanas came to the house owned by Gautama. It so happened that just at that time Gautama also, returning from the woods, was entering his abode. The two friends met. Armed with bow and sword, he bore on shoulders a load of slaughtered cranes, and his body was smeared with the blood that trickled down from the bag on his shoul- ders. Beholding that man who then resembled a cannibal and who had fallen away from the pure practices of the order of his birth, entering his house, the newly-arrived guest, recognising him, O king, said these words : What is this that thou art doing here through folly ? Thou art a Brahmana, and the perpetuater of a Brahmana family ! Born in a respectable family belonging to the Middle country, how is it that thou become like a robber in thy practices ? Recollect, O regenerate one, thy famous kinsmen of former times, all of whom were well-versed in the Vedas ! Born in their race, alas, thou has become a stigma to it ! Awake thyself by thy own exertions! Recollecting the energy, the behaviour, the learning, the self-restraint, the compassion (that are thine by the order of thy birth), leave this thy present abode, O regene- rate one !

On the way he beheld some merchants that used to make voyages on the sea. With that caravan of merchants he proceeded towards the ocean. It so happened however, O king, that that large caravan was assailed, while passing through a mountain valley, by an infuriate elephant. Almost all the persons were slain. Somehow escaping from that great danger, the Brahmana fled towards the north for saving his life, not knowing whither he proceeded. Separated from the caravan and led far away from that spot, he began to wander alone in a forest, like Kimpurusha. 1 At last coming upon a road that led towards the ocean, he journeyed on till he reached a delightful and heavenly forest abounding with flower- ing trees. It was adorned with mango trees that put forth flowers and fruits throughout the year. It resembled the very woods of Nandana (in heaven) and was inhabited by yakshas and Kinnaras. It was also adorned with Salas and palmyras and Tamalas, with clusters of black aloes, and many large sandal trees. Upon the delightful tablelands that he saw there, fragrant with perfumes of diverse kinds, birds of the foremost species were always heard to pour forth their melodies. Other winged denizens of the air, called Bharundas and having faces resembling those of human beings, and those called Bhulingas, and others belong- ing to mountainous regions and to the sea, warbled sweetly there, Gautama proceeded through that forest, listening, as he went, to those delightful and charming strains of nature's choristers. On his way he beheld a very delightful and level spot of land covered with golden sands and resembling heaven itself, O king, for its beauty. On that plot stood a large and beautiful banian with a spherical top. Possessed of many branches that corresponded with the parent tree in beauty and size, that banian looked like an umbrella set over the plain. The spot underneath that magnificent tree was drenched with water perfumed with the most fragrant sandal. Endued with great beauty and abound, ing with delicious flowers all around, the spot looked like the court of the Grandsire himself. Beholding that charming and unrivalled spot, abounding with flowering trees, sacred, and looking like the abode of a very celestial, Gautama became very much delighted. Arrived there, he sat himself down with a well-pleased heart. While sitting there, O son of Kunti, a delicious, charming, and auspicious breeze, bearing the perfume of many kinds of flowers, began to blow softly, cooling the limbs of Gautama and filling him with celestial pleasure, O monarch \\ .1 Kimpuruslia is half-man and half-horse.

When the resplendent luminary entered his chambers in the west and the evening twilight came, a bird that was the foremost of his species, returned to that spot, which was his home, from the regions of Brahman. His name was Nadijangha and he was a dear friend of the creator. He was a prince of Cranes, possessed of great wisdom, and a son of (the sage) Kasyapa. He was also known extensively on Earth by the name of Rajdharman. Indeed, he surpassed everyone on Earth in fame and wisdom. The child of a celestial maiden, possessed of great beauty and learning, he resembled a celestial in splendour. Adorned with the many ornaments that he wore and that were as brilliant as the sun himself, that child of a celes- tial girl seemed to blaze with beauty. Beholding that bird arrived at that spot, Gautama became filled with wonder. Exhausted with hunger and thirst, the Brahmana began to cast his eyes on the bird from desire of slaying him. 11 'Rajdharman said, Welcome, O Brahmana 1 By good luck have I got thee today in my abode !

It behoveth thee not to feel any anxiety ! Thou shalt succeed, O foremost of Brahmanas, and shalt return home with property.

I have become thy friend. I cherish good feelings towards thee ! I shall, therefore, exert in such a way that thou mayst succeed in acquiring wealth I The night passed away and morning came.

That chief, induced by my request, will, without doubt, give thee as much wealth as thou desirest ! Thus addressed, O king, Gautama cheerfully set out from that place, eating on the way, to his fill, fruits sweet as ambrosis. Beholding the sandal and aloe and birch trees that stood along the road, and enjoying their refreshing shade, the Brahmana proceeded quickly. He then reached the city known by the name of Meruvraja. It had large porches made of stone, and high walls of the same material. It was also surrounded on every side with a trench, and large pieces of rock and engines of many kinds were kept ready on the ramparts. He soon be- came known to the Rakshasa chief of great intelligence, O king, as a dear guest sent unto him by the chiefs friend (the crane). The chief received Gautama very gladly. The king of the Rakshasa then, O Yudhishthira, commanded his attendants, saying, Let Gautama be soon brought hither from the gate 1 At the command of the king, certain persons, quick as hawks, issued from the splendid palace of their ruler, and proceeding to the gate accosted Gautama. The royal messengers, O monarch, said unto that Brahmana, Come quickly, the king desires to see thee !

The Brahmana^ however, without answering the other queries, only stated his name and race. The king, having ascertained only the name and the race of his guest, and seeing that he was destitute of Brahmanic splendour and Vedic studies, next enquired about the country of his residence.

Then bright and polished plates of gold, adorned with engravings, and filled with excellent food prepared with ghee and honey, were given unto those Brahmanas. Every year (on the days of full moon) of the month of Ashada and Magha, a large number of Brahma- nas used to receive from the Rakshasa chief, after proper honours, the best kinds of food that they desired. Especially, on the day of full moon in the month of Kartika, after the expiry of autumn, the king used to give unto the Brahmanas much wealth of diverse kinds, includ- ing gold, silver, jewels, gems, pearls, diamonds of great value, stones of the lapis lazuli variety, deer-skins, and skins of the Ranku deer. Indeed, O Bharata, throwing a heap of wealth of many kinds for giving it away as Dakshina (unto his regenerate guests), the mighty Virupaksha, addressing those foremost of Brahmanas, said unto them, Take from these jewels and gems as much as ye wish and can hope to bear away ! And he also used to say unto them, O Bharata, these words : Taking those plates of gold and vessels which you have used for your dinner, go ye away, O foremost of Brahmanas !

Sport ye as ye wish, and then go away with speed ! The Brahmanas then, leaving that spot, went away in all directions with great speed. Gautama also, having taken up a heavy quantity of gold without any loss of time, went away. Carrying the burthen with difficulty, he reached that same banian (under which he had met the crane). He sat himself down, fatigued, toil-worn, and hungry. While Gautama was resting there, that best of birds, viz., Rajdharman, O king, came there. Devoted to friends, he gladdened Gautama by bidding him welcome. By flapping his wings he began to fan his guest and dispel his fatigue.

I have no food by which to support life on my way. What should I do for supporting life ? Even these were his thoughts then. It so happened that even upon much thinking he failed to see any food which he could eat on the way. Ungrateful as he was, O tiger among men, even this was the thought that he then conceived.

No person should injure a friend. He that injures a friend sinks into terrible and everlasting hell. Every one should be grateful and every one should seek to benefit his friends. Everything may be obtained from a friend. Honours may be obtained from friends. 3 In consequence of friends one may enjoy various objects of enjoyment. Through the exertions of friends, one may escape from various kinds of danger and distress. He that is wise would honour his friend with his best attentions. An ungrateful, shameless, and sinful wight should be shunned by those that are wise. One that injures his friends is a wretch of his race. Such a sinful wight is the vilest of men.
