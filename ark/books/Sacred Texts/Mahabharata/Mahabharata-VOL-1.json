The first edition of this work was brought out long, long ago by late Mr. Pratap Chandra Roy, C.I.E. His was the object inspired by noble patriotism, in as much as all the copies of his edition were intended for free distribution. But, unfortu- nately, this noble object failed of its purpose and that to the nauseating vileness of many of the recipients of his charity, who took advantage of Pratap Babu's noble simplicity, they having sold out their copies for a money value. It is highly regrettable that many a golden undertaking had this way been smothered out of existence. The result was, the work was priced at Rs. 50/- per copy. People who thirsted after the knowledge of this mighty Mahabharata had no opportunity of going through it at all, for the first edition consisted of a very few copies only. The mantle of Mr. Roy then fell upon late Mr. Manmatha Nath Datta, M.A., who, too, made an earnest attempt at the publication of an English Mahabharata but alas ! he was called away before the completion of his huge literary venture. Now-a-days English has become the world language a language spoken and understood by almost all. The culture of Sanskrit in which the original Mahabharata is clothed is now confined within the coterie of a few Brahmin Pandits in India. Again, the Westerners are quite strangers to Sanskrit language, though they should be enabled to have at least a peep into this vast store of world's knowledge. These are the considerations which have prompted us into bringing out piece- meal this new edition of Mr. Roy's Mahabharata. In order to bring the work within the easy reach of every one, the price of the present edition has been made as low as possible. In view of the prohibitive price of paper it is a venturesome attempt to bring out now a huge work like this. But many a little makes a mickle. It is our confident belief that the unstinted support of the reading public is sure to carry us successfully through this onerous task. Why, is there any other country which can boast of a work such as this our Mahabharata, the stupendous ocean of all-embracing knowledge ? Even the most renowned classical works of the West pale into insignificance, when weighed against this wonderful production which shows the high water- mark of Indian civilisation. To be patriotic is to be proud of the past glories of one's own country. It is therefore hoped that no Indian with a spark of patriotism in him will tighten his purse-strings against this laudable object of taking to the doors of the West this glorious fruit of the brilliant civilisation of that pre-historic age.

Having bowed down to Narayana and Nara, the most exalted male being, and also to the goddess Saraswati, must the word Jaya be uttered. Ugrasrava, the son of Lomaharshana, surnamed Sauti, well- versed in the Puranas, bending with humility, one day approached the great sages of rigid vows, sitting at their ease, who had attended the twelve years' sacrifice of Saunaka, surnamed Kulapati, in the forest of Naimisha. Those ascetics, wishing to hear his wonderful narrations, presently began to address him who had thus arrived at that recluse abode of the inhabitants of the forest of Naimisha. Having been entertained with due respect by those holy men, he saluted those Munis (sages) with joined palms, even all of them, and inquired about the progress of their asceticism. Then all the ascetics being again seated, the son of Loma- harshana humbly occupied the seat that was assigned to him. Seeing that he was comfortably seated, and recovered from fatigue, one of the Rishis beginning the conversation, asked him, 'Whence comest thou, O lotus-eyed Sauti, and where hast thou spent the time ? Tell me, who ask thee, in detail.' Accomplished in speech, Sauti, thus questioned, gave in the midst of that big assemblage of contemplative Munis a full and proper answer in words consonant with their mode of life. \"Sauti said, 'Having heard the diverse sacred and wonderful stories which were composed in his Mahabharata by Krishna-Dwaipayana, and which were recited in full by Vaisampayana at the Snake-sacrifice of the high-souled royal sage Janamejaya and in the presence also of that chief of Princes, the son of Parikshit, and having wandered about, visiting many sacred waters and holy shrines, I journeyed to the coun- try venerated by the Dwijas (twice- born) and called Samantapanchaka where formerly was fought the battle between the children of Kuru and PandUt and all the chiefs of the land ranged on either side. Thence, anxious to see you, I am come into your presence. Ye reverend sages, all of whom are to me as Brahma ; ye greatly blessed who shine in"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"2 MAHABHARATA this place of sacrifice with the splendour of the solar fire : ye who have concluded the silent meditations and have fed the holy fire ; and yet who are sitting without care, what, O ye Dwijas (twice-born), shall I repeat, shall I recount the sacred stories collected in the Puranas contain- ing precepts of religious duty and of worldly profit, or the acts of illustrious saints and sovereigns of mankind ?' \"The Rishi replied, 'The Purana, first promulgated by the great Rishi Dwaipayana, and which after having been heard both by the gods and the Brahmarshis was highly esteemed, being the most eminent narrative that exists, diversified both in diction and division, possessing subtile meanings logically combined, and gleaned from the Vedas, is a sacred work. Composed in elegant language, it includeth the subjects of other books. It is elucidated by other Shastras, and comprehendeth the sense of the four Vedas. We are desirous of hearing that history also called Bharata, the holy composition of the wonderful Vyasa, which dispelleth the fear of evil, just as it was cheerfully recited by the Rishi Vaisampayana, under the direction of Dwaipayana himself, at the snake-sacrifice of Raja Janamejaya ?' \"Sauti then said, 'Having bowed down to the primordial being Isana, to whom multitudes make offerings, and who is adored by the multitude ; who is the true incorruptible one, Brahma, perceptible, imperceptible, eternal ; who is both a non-existing and an existing-non- existing being ; who is the universe and also distinct from the existing and non-existing universe ; who is the creator of high and low ; the ancient, exalted, inexhaustible one ; who is Vishnu, beneficent and the beneficence itself, worthy of all preference, pure and immaculate ; who is Hari, the ruler of the faculties, the guide of all things moveable and immoveable ; I will declare the sacred thoughts of the illustrious sage Vyasa, of marvellous deeds and worshipped here by all. Some bards have already published this history, some are now teaching it, and others, in like manner, will hereafter promulgate it upon the earth. It is a great source of knowledge, established throughout the three regions of the world. It is possessed by the twice-born both in detailed and compendious forms. It is the delight of the learned for being embellished with elegant expressions, conversations human and divine, and a variety of poetical measures. In this world, when it was destitute of brightness and light, and enveloped all around in total darkness, there came into being, as the primal cause of creation, a mighty egg, the one inexhaustible seed of all created beings. It is called Mahadivya, and was formed at the begin- ning of the Yuga, in which we are told, was the true light Brahma, the eternal one, the wonderful and inconceivable being present alike"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"ADI PAKVA 3 in all places ; the invisible and subtile cause, whose nature partaketh of entity and non-entity. From this egg came out the lord Pitamaha Brahma, the one only Prajapati ; with Suraguru and Sthanu. Then appeared the twenty-one Prajapatis, viz., Manu, Vasishtha and Para- meshthi ; ten Prachetas, Daksha, and the seven sons of Daksha. Then appeared the man of inconceivable nature whom all the Rishis know and so the Viswe-devas, the Adityas, the Vasus, and the twin Aswins ; the Yakshas, the Sadhyas, the Pisachas, the Guhyakas, and the Pitris. After these were produced the wise and most holy Brahmarshis, and the numerous Eajarshis distinguished by every noble quality. So the water, the heavens, the earth, the air, the sky, the points of the heavens, the years, the seasons, the months, the fortnights, called Pakshas, with day and night in due succession. And thus were produced all things which are known to mankind. And what is seen in the universe, whether animate or inanimate, of created things, will at the end of the world, and after the expiration of the Yuga, be again confounded. And, at the commencement of other Yugas, all things will be renovated, and, like the various fruits of the earth, succeed each other in the due order of their seasons. Thus continueth perpetually to revolve in the world, without begin* ning and without end, this wheel which causeth the destruction of all things. The generation of Devas, in brief, was thirty-three thousand, thirty-three hundred and thirty- three. The sons of Div were Brihadbhanu, Chakshus, Atma Vibhavasu, Savita, Richika, Arka, Bhanu, Asavaha, and Ravi. Of these Vivaswans of old, Mahya was the youngest whose son was Deva-vrata. The latter had for his son, Su-vrata who, we learn, had three sons, Dasa-jyoti, Sata-jyoti, and Sahasra-jyoti, each of them producing numerous offspring. The illus- trious Dasa-jyoti had ten thousand, Sata-jyoti ten times that number, and Sahasra-jyoti ten times the number of Sata-jyoti's offspring. From these are descended the family of the Kurus, of the Yadus, and of Bharata ; the family of Yayati and of Ikshwaku ; also of all the Rajarshis. Numerous also were the generations produced, and very abundant were the creatures and their places of abode. The mystery which is threefold the Vedas, Yoga, and Vijnana Dharma, Artha, and Kama also various books upon the subject of Dharma, Artha, and Kama ; also rules for the conduct of mankind ; also histories and discourses with various srutis ; all of which having been seen by the Rishi Vyasa are here in due order mentioned as a specimen of the book. The Rishi Vyasa published this mass of knowledge in both a detailed and an abridged form, It is the wish of the learned in the world"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"4 MAHABHARATA to possess the details and the abridgement. Some read the Bharata beginning with the initial mantra (invocation), others with the story of Astika, others with Uparichara, while some Brahmanas study the whole. Men of learning display their various knowledge of the institutes in commenting on the composition. Some are skilful in explaining it, while others, in remembering its contents. The son of Satyavati having, by penance and meditation, analysed the eternal Veda, afterwards composed this holy history, when that learned Brahmarshi of strict vows, the noble Dwaipayana Vyasa, off- spring of Parasara, had finished this greatest of narrations, he began to consider how he might teach it to his disciples. And the possessor of the six attributes, Brahma, the world's preceptor, knowing of the anxiety of the Rishi Dwaipayana, came in person to the place where the latter was, for gratifying the saint, and benefiting the people. And when Vyasa, surrounded by all the tribes of Munis, saw him, he was surprised ; and, standing with joined palms, he bowed and ordered a seat to be brought. And Vyasa having gone round him who is called Hiranyagarbha seated on that distinguished seat stood near it ; and being commanded by Brahma Parameshthi, he sat down near the seat, full of affection and smiling in joy. Then the greatly glorious Vyasa, address- ing Brahma Parameshthi, said, \"O divine Brahma, by me a poem hath been composed which is greatly respected. The mystery of the Veda, and what other subjects have been explained by me ; the various rituals of the Upanishads with the Angas ; the compilation of the Puranas and history formed by me and named after the three divisions of time, past, present, and future ; the determination of the nature of decay, fear, disease, existence, and non-existence ; a description of creeds and of the various modes of life ; rule for the four castes, and the import of all the Puranas ; an account of asceticism and of the duties of a religious student ; the dimensions of the sun and moon, the planets, constellations, and stars, together with the duration of the four ages ; the Rik, Sama and Yajur Vedas ; also the Adhyatma ; the sciences called Nyaya, Orthoepy and Treatment of diseases ; charity and Pasupatadharma ; birth celestial and human, for particular pur- poses ; also a description of places of pilgrimage and other holy places of rivers, mountains, forests, the ocean, of heavenly cities and the kalpas ; the art of war ; the different kinds of nations and languages : the nature of the manners of the people ; and the all-pervading spirit ; all these have been represented. But, after all, no writer of this work is to be found on earth/ \"Brahma said, 1 esteem thee for thy knowledge of divine mysteries, before the whole body of celebrated Munis distinguished for the sanctity"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"PABVA 5 of their lives. I know thou hast revealed the divine word, even from its first utterance, in the language of truth. Thou hast called thy present work a poem, wherefore it shall be a poem. There shall be no poets whose works may equal the descriptions of this poem, even, as the three other modes called Asrama are ever unequal in merit to the domestic Asrama. Let Ganesa be thought of, O Muni, for the purpose of writing the poem.' \"Sauti said, 'Brahma having thus spoken to Vyasa, retired to his own abode. Then Vyasa began to call to mind Ganesa. And Ganesa, obviator of obstacles, ready to fulfil the desires of his votaries, was no sooner thought of, then he repaired to the place where Vyasa was seated. And when he had been saluted, and was seated, Vyasa addressed him thus, 'O guide of the Ganas I be thou the writer of the Bharata which I have formed in my imagination, and which I am about to repeat/ \"Ganesa, upon hearing this address, thus answered, 'I will become the writer of thy work, provided my pen do not for a moment cease writing.' And Vyasa said unto that divinity, 'Wherever there by any- thing thou dost not comprehend, cease to continue writing.' Ganesa having signified his assent, by repeating the word Om ! proceeded to write ; and Vyasa began ; and by way of diversion, he knit the knots of composition exceeding close ; by doing which, he dictated this work according to his engagement. I am (continued Sauti) acquainted with eight thousand and eight hundred verses, and so is Suka, and perhaps Sanfaya. From the myste- riousness of their meaning, O Muni, no one is able, to this day, to penetrate those closely knit difficult slokas. Even the omniscient Ganesa took a moment to consider ; while Vyasa, however, continued to compose other verses in great abundance. The wisdom of this work, like unto an instrument of applying collyrium, hath opened the eyes of the inquisitive world blinded by the darkness of ignorance. As the sun dispelleth the darkness, so doth the Bharata by its discourses on religion, profit, pleasure and final release, dispel the ignorance of men. As the full-moon by its mild light expand- eth the buds of the water-lily, so this Purana, by exposing the light of the Sruti hath expanded the human intellect. By the lamp of history, which destroyeth the darkness of ignorance, the whole mansion of nature is properly and completely illuminated. This work is a tree, of which the chapter of contents is the seed ; the divisions called Pauloma and Astika are the root ; the part called Sambhava is the trunk ; the books called Sabha and Aranya are the roost- ing perches ; the books called Arani is the knitting knots ; the books called Virata and Udyoga the pith ; the book named Bhishma, the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"6 MAHABHABATA main branch ; the book called Drona, the leaves ; the book called Kama, the fair flowers ; the book named Salya, their sweet smell ; the books entitled Stri and Aishika, the refreshing shade ; the book called Santi, the mighty fruit ; the book called Asiuamedha, the immortal sap ; the denominated Asramavasika, the spot where it groweth ; and the book called Mausala, is an epitome of the Vedas and held in great respect by the vrituous Brahmanas. The tree of the Bharata, inexhaustible to mankind as the clouds, shall be as a source of livelihood to all distinguished poets.' \"Sauti continued, 'I will now speak of the undying flowery and fruitful productions of this tree, possessed of pure and pleasant taste, and not to be destroyed even by the immortals. Formerly, the spirited and virtuous Krishna-Dwaipayana, by the injunctions of Bhishma, the wise son of Ganga and of his own mother, became the father of three boys who were like the three fires by the two wives of Vichitra-virya ; and having thus raised up Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidura, he return- ed to his recluse abode to prosecute his religious exercise. It was not till after these were born, grown up, and departed on the supreme journey, that the great Rishi Vyasa published the Bharata in this region of mankind ; when being solicited by Janamejaya and thousands of Brahmanas, he instructed his disciple Vaisampayana, who was seated near him ; and he, sitting together with the Sadasyas, recited the Bharata, during the intervals of the ceremonies of the sacrifice, being repeatedly urged to proceed. Vyasa hath fully represented the greatness of the house of Euru, the virtuous principles of Gandhari, the wisdom of Vidura, and the constancy of Kunti. The noble Rishi hath also described the divinity of Vasudeva, the rectitude of the sons of Pandu, and the evil practices of the sons and partisans of Dhritarashtra. Vyasa executed the compilation of the Bharata, exclusive of the episodes originally in twenty-four thousand verses ; and so much only is called by the learned as the Bharata. Afterwards, he composed an epitome in one hundred and fifty verses, consisting of the introduction with the chapter of contents. This he first taught to his son Suka ; and afterwards he gave it to others of his disciples who were possessed of the same qualifications. After that he executed another compilation, con- sisting of six hundred thousand verses. Of those, thirty hundred thou- sand are known in the world of the Devas ; fifteen hundred thousand in the world of the Pitris : fourteen hundred thousand among the Gandharvas, and one hundred thousand in the regions of mankind. Narada recited them to the Deves, Devala to the Pitris, and Suka published them to the Ganclharvas, Yakshas, and Rakshasas : and in"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"ADI PABVA 7 this world they were recited by Vaisampayana, one of the disciples of Vyasa, a man of just principles and the first among all those acquainted with the Vedas. Know that I, Sauti, have also repeated one hundred thousand verses. Tudhishthira is a vast tree, formed of religion and virtue ; Arjuna is its trunk ; Bhimasena, its branches ; the two sons of Madri are its full- grown fruit and flowers ; and its roots are Krishna, Brahma, and the Brahmanas. Pandu, after having subdued many countries by his wisdom and prowess, took up his abode with the Munis in a certain forest as a sports- man, where he brought upon himself a very severe misfortune for having killed a stag coupling with its mate, which served as a warning for the conduct of the princes of his house as long as they lived. Their mothers, in order that the ordinances of the law might be fulfilled, admitted as substitutes to their embraces the gods Dharma, Vayu, Sakra, and the divinities the twin Aswins. And when their offspring grew up, under the care of their two mothers, in the society of ascetics, in the midst of sacred groves and holy recluse-abodes of religious men, they were conducted by Rishis into the presence of Dhritarashtra and his sons, following as students in the habit of Brahmacharis, having their hair tied in knots on their heads. 'These our pupils', said they, 'are as your sons, your brothers, and your friends ; they are Panda v as.' Saying this, the Munis disappeared. When the Kauravas saw them introduced as the sons of Pandu, the distinguished class of citizens shouted exceedingly for joy. Some, however, said, they were not the sons of Pandu ; others said, they were ; while a few asked how they could be his offspring, seeing he had been so long dead. Still on all sides voices were heard crying, 'They are on all accounts welcome ! Through divine Providence we behold the family of Pandu ! Let their welcome be proclaimed !' As these acclamations ceased, the plaudits of invisible spirits, causing every point of the heavens to resound, were tremendous. There were showers of sweet-scented flowers, and the sound of shells and kettle-drums. Such were the wonders that happened on the arrival of the young princes. The joyful noise of all the citizens, in expression of their satisfaction on the occasion, was so great that it reached the very heavens in magnify- ing plaudits. Having studied the whole of the Vedas and sundry other shastras, the Pandavas resided there, respected by all and without apprehension from any one. The principal men were pleased with the purity of Yudhishthira, the courage of Arjuna, the submissive attention of Kunti to her"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"8 MAHABHABATA superiors, and the humility of the twins, Nakula and Sahadeva ; and all the people rejoiced in their heroic virtues. After a while, Arjuna obtained the virgin Krishna at the swayamvara, in the midst of a concourse of Rajas, by performing a very difficult feat of archery. And from this time he became very much respected in this world among all bowmen ; and in fields of battle also, like the sun, he was hard to behold by foe-men. And having vanquish- ed all the neighbouring princes and every considerable tribe, he accomplished all that was necessary for the Raja (his eldest brother) to perform the great sacrifice called Rajasuya. Yudhishthira, after having, through the wise counsels of Vasudeva and by the valour of Bhimasena and Arjuna, slain Jarasandha (the king of Magadha) and the proud Chaidya, acquired the right to perform the grand sacrifice of Rajasuya abounding in provisions and offerings and fraught with transcendent merits. And Duryodhana came to this sacrifice ; and when he beheld the vast wealth of the Pan- da v as scattered all around ; the offerings, the precious stones, gold and jewels ; the wealth in cows, elephants, and horses ; the curious textures, garments, and mantles ; the precious shawls and furs and carpets made of the skin of the Ranku ; he was filled with envy and became exceed- ingly displeased. And when he beheld the hall of assembly elegantly constructed by Maya (the Asura architect) after the fashion of a celestial court, he was inflamed with rage. And having started in confusion at certain architectural deceptions within this building, he was derided by Bhimasena in the presence of Vasudeva, like one of mean descent. And it was represented to Dhritarashtra that his son, while par- taking of various objects of enjoyment and diverse precious things, was becoming meagre, wan, and pale. And Dhritarashtra, some time after, out of affection for his son, gave his consent to their playing (with the Pandavas) at dice. And Vasudeva coming to know of this, became exceedingly wroth. And being dissatisfied, he did nothing to prevent the disputes, but overlooked the gaming and sundry other horried unjustifiable transactions arising therefrom : and in spite of Vidura, Bhishma, Drona, and Kripa, the son of Saradwan, he made the Kshatri- yas kill each other in the terrific war that ensued.' \"And Dhritarashtra hearing the ill news of the success of the Pandavas and recollecting the resolutions of Duryodhana, Kama, and Sakuni, pondered for a while and addressed to Sanjaya the following speech : 'Attend, O Sanjaya, to all I am about to say, and it will not become thee to treat me with contempt.

My inclination was never to war, nor did I delight in the destruction of my race. I made no distinc- tion between my own children and the children of Pandu.

I was foolish after the thoughtless Duryodhana ever growing in folly. Having been a spectator of the riches of the mighty sons of Pandu, my son was derided for his awkwardness while ascending the hall. Unable to bear it all and unable himself to overcome the sons of Pandu in the field, and though a soldier, unwilling yet to obtain good fortune by his own exertion, with the help of the king of Gandhara he concerted an unfair game at dice.

It is Time that burneth creatures and it is Time that extinguisheth the fire. All states, the good and the evil, in the three worlds, are caused by Time.

'The study of the Bharata is an act of piety. He that readeth ev en one foot, with belief, hath his sins entirely purged away. Herein Devas, Devarshis, and immaculate Brahmarshis of good deeds, have been spoken of ; and likewise Yakshas and great Uragas (Nagas). Herein also hath been described the eternal V^sudeva possessing the six attributes. He is the true and just, the pure and holy, the eternal Brahma, the supreme soul, the true constant light, whose divine deeds wise and learned recount ; from whom hath proceeded the non-existent and existent- non-existent universe with principles of generation and progression, and birth, death and re-birth. That also hath been treated of which is called Adhyatma (the superintending spirit of nature) that partaketh of the attributes of the five elements. That also hath been described who is puruslia being above such epithets as 'undisplayed' and the like ; also that which the foremost yatis exempt from the common destiny and endued with the power of meditation and Tapas behold dwelling in their hearts as a reflected image in the mirror. The man of faith, devoted to piety, and constant in the exercise of virtue, on reading this section is freed from sin. The believer that constantly heareth recited this section of the Bharata, called the Intro- duction, from the beginning, falleth not into difficulties. The man repeating any part of the introduction in the two twilights is during such act freed from the sins contracted during the day or the night. This section, the body of the Bharata, is truth and nectar. As butter is in curd, Brahmana among bipeds, the Aranyaka among the Vedas, and nectar among medicines ; as the sea is eminent among receptacles of water, and the cow among quadrupeds ; as are these (among the things mentioned) so is the Bharata said to be among histories. 'He that causeth it, even a single foot thereof, to be recited to Brahmanas during a Sradha, his offerings of food and drink to the manes of his ancestors become inexhaustible. 'By the aid of history and the Puranas, the Veda may be expounded ; but the Veda is afraid of one of little information lest he should it. The learned man who recites to other this Veda of Vyasa reapeth advantage. It may without doubt destroy even the sin of killing the embryo and the like. He that readeth this holy chapter of the moon, readeth the whole of the Bharata, I ween.

And as the latter weighed heavier than the four Vedas with their mysteries, from that period it hath been called in the world Mahabharata (the great Bharata). Being esteemed superior both in substance and gravity of import it is denominated Mahabharata on account of such substance and gravity of import. He that knoweth its meaning is saved from all his sins. 'Tapa is innocent, study is harmless, the ordinance of the Vedas prescribed for all the tribes are harmless, the acquisition of wealth by exertion is harmless ; but when they are abused in their practices it is then that they become sources of evil.' '' SECTION II \"The Rishis said, 4 O son o Suta, we wish to hear a full and circumstantial account of the place mentioned by you as Samanta- panchaka.' \"Sauti said, 'Listen, O ye Brahmanas, to the sacred descriptions I utter. O ye best of men, ye deserve to hear of the place known as Samanta-panchaka. In the interval between the Treta and Dwapara Yugas, Rama (the son of Jamadagni) great among all who have borne arms, urged by impatience of wrongs, repeatedly smote the noble race of Kshatriyas. And when that fiery meteor, by his own valour, annihilated the entire tribe of the Kshatriyas, he formed at Samanta- panchaka five lakes of blood. We are told that his reason being over- powered by anger he offered oblations of blood to the manes of his ancestors, standing in the midst of the sanguine waters of those lakes. It was then that his forefathers of whom Richika was the first having arrived there addressed him thus, 'O Rama, O blessed Rama, O offspring of Bhrigu, we have been gratified with the reverence thou hast shown for thy ancestors and with thy valour, O mighty one ! Blessings be upon thee. O thou illustrious one, ask the boon that thou mayst desire. 1 \"Rama said, If, O fathers, ye are favourably disposed towards me, the boon I ask is that I may be absolved from the sins born of my having annihilated the Kshatriyas in anger, and that the lakes I have formed may become famous in the world as holy shrines.' The Pitris then said, 'So shall it be. But be thou pacified.' And Rama was pacified accordingly. The region that lieth near unto those lakes of gory water, from that time hath been celebrated as Samanta-panchaka the holy.

In the interval between the Dwapara and the Kali Yugas there happened at Samanta panchaka the encounter between the armies of the Kauravas and the Panda v as. In that holy region, without ruggedness of any kind, were assembled eighteen Akshauhinis of soldiers eager for battle. And, O Brahmanas, having come thereto, they were all slain on the spot. Thus the name of that region, O Brahmanas, hath been explained, and the country described to you as a sacred and delightful one. I have mentioned the whole of what relateth to it as the region is celebrated throughout the three worlds.' \"The Rishis said, 'We have a desire to know, O son of Suta, what is implied by the term Akshauhini that hath been used by thee. Tell us in full what is the number of horse and foot, chariots and elephants, which compose an Akshauhini for thou art fully informed.' \"Sauti said, 'One chariot, one elephant, five foot-soldiers, and three horses form one Patti ; three pattis make one Sena-mukha ; three sena-mukhas are called a Gulma ; three gulmas, a Gana ; three ganas, a Vahini\\ three vahinis together are called a Pritana; three pritanasform a Chamu ; three chamus, one Anikini ; and an anikini taken ten times forms, as it is styled by those who know, an Akshauhini. O ye best of Brahmanas, arithmeticians have calculated that the number of chariots in an Akshauhini is twenty- one thousand eight hundred and seventy. The measure of elephants must be fixed at the same number. O ye pure, you must know that the number of foot-soldiers is one hundred and nine thousand, three hundred and fifty, the number of horse is sixty-five thousand, six hundred and ten. These, O Brahmanas, as fully explained by me, are the numbers of an Akshauhini as said by those acquainted with the principles of numbers. O best of Brahmanas, according to this calculation were composed the eighteen Akshauhinis of the Kaurava and the Panda v a army. Time, whose acts are wonderful assembled them on that spot and having made the Kauravas the cause, destroyed them all. Bhishma acquainted with choice of weapons, fought for ten days. Drona protected the Kaurava Vahinis for five days. Karna the desolator of hostile armies fought for two days ; and Salya for half a day. After that lasted for half a day the encounter with clubs between Duryodhana and Bhima. At the close of that day, Aswatthaman and Kripa destroyed the army of Yudhishthira in the night while sleep- ing without suspicion of danger.

It is accepted by the wise, as the state called Vairagya is by men desirous of final release. As Self among things to be known, as life among things that are dear, so is this history that furnisheth the means of arriving at the knowledge of Brahma the first among all the sastras. There is not a story current in this world but doth depend upon this history even as the body upon the foot that it taketh. As masters of good lineage are ever attended upon by servants desirous of preferment so is the Bharata cherished by all poets.

In this, Arjuna the foremost among men, going to Dwaravati (Dwaraka) and seeing the city destitute of the Vrishnis was much affected and became exceedingly sorry. Then after the funeral of his maternal uncle Vasudeva the foremost among the Yadus (Vrishnis), he saw the heroes of the Yadu race lying stretched in death on the spot where they had been drinking. He then caused the cremation of the bodies of the illustrious Krishna and Balarama and of the principal members of the Vrishni race.

This is the sixteenth Parva called Maushala.

In this, leaving his brothers who dropped one after another and Draupadi also, Yudhishthira went on his journey without once look- ing back on them.

Then Yudhishthira ascending to heaven felt much pain. The celestial messenger showed him hell by an act of deception. Then Yudhishthira, the soul of justice, heard the heart-rending lamentations of his brothers abiding in that region under the discipline of Yama. Then Dharma and Indra showed Yudhishthira the region appointed for sinners. Then Yudhishthira, after leaving the human body by a plunge in the celestial Ganges, attained to that region which his acts merited, and began to live in joy respected by Indra and all other gods.

Those wiio have listened to his history can never bear to listen toothers, as, indeed, they who have listened to the sweet voice of the male Kokila can never hear the dissonance of the crow's cawing. As the formation of the three worlds proceedeth from the five elements, so do the inspirations of all poets proceed from this excellent composition. O ye Brahman, as the four kinds of creatures (viviparous, oviparous, born of hot moisture and vegetables) are dependent on space for their existence, so the Puranas depend upon this history. As all the senses depend for their exercise upon the various modifications of the mind, so do all acts (ceremonials) and moral qualities depend upon this treatise. There is not a story current in the world but doth depend on this history, even as body upon the food it taketh. All poets cherish the Bharata even as servants desirous of preferment always attend upon masters of good lineage. Even as the blessed domestic Asrama can never be surpassed by the three other Asramas (modes of life) so no poets can surpass this poem. \"Ye ascetics, shake off all inaction. Let your hearts be fixed on virtue, for virtue is the one only friend of him that has gone to the other world. Even the most intelligent by cherishing wealth and wives can never make these their own ; not are these possessions lasting. The Bharata uttered by the lips of Dwaipayana is without a parallel ; it is virtue itself and sacred. It destroyeth sin and produceth good. He that listeneth to it while it is being recited hath no need of a bath in the sacred waters of Pushkara. A Brahmana, whatever sins he may commit during the day through his senses, is freed from them all by reading the Bharata in the evening. Whatever sins he may commit also in the night by deeds, words, or mind, he is freed from them all by reading Bharata in the first twilight (morning). He that giveth a hundred kine with horns mounted with gold to a Brahmana well-posted up in the Vedas and all branches of learning, and he that daily listeneth to the sacred narrations of the Bharata, acquireth equal merit.

His brothers were three, Srutasena, Ugrasena, and Bhimasena. And as they were sitting at the sacrifice, there arrived at the spot an offspring of Sarama (the celestial bitch). And belaboured by the brothers of Janamejaya, he ran away to his mother, crying in pain. And his mother seeing him crying exceedingly asked him, 'Why criest thou so ? Who hath beaten thee ?* And being thus questioned, he said unto his mother, 'I have been belaboured by the brothers of Janamejaya/ And his mother replied, 'Thou hast committed some fault for which hast thou been beaten!' He answered, 'I have not committed any fault. I have not touched the sacrificial butter with my tongue, nor have I even cast a look upon it.' His mother Sarama hearing this and much distressed at the affliction of her son went to the place where Janamejaya with his brothers was at his long-extending sacrifice. And she addressed Janamejaya in anger, saying, This my son hath committed no fault : he hath not looked upon your sacrificial butter, nor hath he touched it with his tongue. Wherefore hath he been beaten ?' They said not a word in reply ; whereupon she said, 'As ye have beaten my son who hath committed no fault, therefore shall evil come upon ye, when ye least expect it.' \"Janamejaya, thus addressed by the celestial bitch, Sarama, became exceedingly alarmed and dejected. And after the sacrifice was conclu- ded returned to Hastinapura, and began to take great pains in searching for a Purohita who could by procuring absolution for his sin, neutralise the effect of the curse. \"One day Janamejaya, the son of Parikshit, while a-hunting, observed in a particular part of his dominions a hermjtage where dwelt a certain Rishi of fame, Srutasrava. He had a son \"named Somasrava deeply engaged in ascetic devotions. Being desirous of appointing that son of the Rishi as his Purohita, Janamejaya, the son of Parikshit, saluted the Rishi and addressed him, saying, 'O possessor of the six attributes, let this thy son be my purohita.' The Rishi thus addressed, answered Janamejaya, 'O Janamejaya, this my son, deep in ascetic devotions, accomplished in the study of the Vedas, and endued with the full force of my asceticism, is born of (the womb of) a she-snake that had drunk"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"ADI PARVA 37 my vital fluid.

Janamejaya thus addressed replied to the Rishi, 'It shall be even so. 1 And accepting him for his Purohita, he returned to his capital ; and he then addressed his brothers saying, 'This is the person I have chosen for my spiritual master ; whatsoever he may say must be complied with by you without examination.' And his brothers did as they were directed. And giving these directions to his brothers, the king marched towards Takshyashila and brought that country under his authority. \"About this time there was a Rishi, Ayoda-Dhaumya by name. And Ayoda-Dhaumya had three disciples, Upamanyu, Aruni, and Veda. And the Rishi bade one of these disciples, Aruni of Panchala, to go and stop up a breach in the water-course of a certain field. And Aruni of Panchala, thus ordered by his preceptor, repaired to the spot. And having gone there he saw that he could not stop up the breach in the water-course by ordinary means. And he was distressed because he could not do his preceptor's bidding. But at length he saw a way and said, Well, I win do it in this way/ He then went down into the breach and lay down himself there. And the water was thus confined. \"And some time after, the preceptor Ayoda-Dhaumya asked his other disciples where Aruni of Panchala was. And they answered, 'Sir, he hath been sent by yourself saying, 'Go, stop up the breach in the water- course of the field.' Thus reminded, Dhaumya, addressing his pupils, said, 'Then let us all go to the place where he is.' \"And having arrived there, he shouted, 'Ho Aruni of Panchala! Where art thou? Come hither, my child.' And Aruni hearing the voice of his preceptor speedily came out of the water-course and stood before his preceptor. And addressing the latter., Aruni said, 'Here I am in the breach of the water-course. Not having been able to devise any other means, I entered myself for the purpose of preventing the water running out. It is only upon hearing thy voice that, having left it and allowed the waters to escape, I have stood before thee. I salute thee, Master ; tell me what I have to do.' \"The preceptor, thus addressed, replied, 'Because in getting up from the ditch thou hast opened the water-course, thenceforth shalt thou be called Uddalaka as a mark of thy preceptor's favour, And because my words have been obeyed by thee, thou shalt obtain good fortune. And all the Vedas shall shine in thee and all the Dharmasastras also.'

And having watched them all day, he returned in the evening to his preceptor's house and standing before him he saluted him respectfully. And his preceptor seeing him in good condition of body asked him, 'Upamanyu, my child, upon what dost thou support thyself ? Thou art exceedingly plump.' And he answered, 'Sir, I support myself by begging.' And his preceptor said, 'What is obtained in alms should not be used by thee without offering it to me.' And Upamanyu, thus told, went away. And having obtained alms, he offered the same to his preceptor. And his preceptor took from him even the whole. And Upamanyu, thus treated, went to attend the cattle. And having watched them all day, he returned in the eve'ning to his preceptor's abode. And he stood before his preceptor and saluted him with respect. And his preceptor perceiving that he still continued to be of good condition of body said unto him, 'Upamanyu, my child, I take from thee even the whole of what thou obtainest in alms, without leaving anything for thee. How then dost thou, at present, contrive to support thyself ?' And Upamanyu said unto his preceptor, 'Sir, having made over to you all that I obtain in alms, I go a-begging a second time for supporting myself.' And his preceptor then replied, This is not the way in which thou shouldst obey the preceptor. By this thou art diminishing the support of others that live by begging. Truly having supported thyself so, thou hast proved thyself covetous/ And Upamanyu, having signified his assent to all that his preceptor said, went away to attend the cattle. And having watched them all day, he returned to his preceptor's house. And he stood before his preceptor and saluted him respectfully. And his preceptor observing that he was still fat, said again unto him, 'Upamanyu, my child, I take from thee all thou obtainest in alms and thou dost not go a-begging a second time, and yet art thou in healthy condition. How dost thou support thyself ?' And Upamanyu, thus questioned, answered, 'Sir, I now live upon the milk of these cows.' And his preceptor thereupon told him, 'It is not lawful for thee to appropriate the milk without having first obtained my 'consent.* And Upamanyu having assented to the justice of these observations, went away to tend the kine.

And Upamanyu replied, 'Sir, I now sip the froth that these calves throw out while sucking their mother's teats.' And the preceptor said, These generous calves, I suppose, out of com- passion for thee, throw out large quantities of froth. Wouldst thou stand in the way of their full meals by acting as thou hast done ? Know that it is unlawful for thee to drink the froth.' And Upamanyu, having signified his assent to this, went as before to tend the cows. And restrained by his preceptor, he feedeth not on alms, nor hath he any- thing else to eat ; he drinketh not of the milk, nor tasteth he of the froth ! \"And\\Jpamanyu, one day, oppressed by hunger, when in a forest, ate of the leaves of the Arka (Asclepias gigantea). And his eyes being affected by the pungent, acrimonious, crude, and saline properties of the leaves which he had eaten, he became blind. And as he was crawl- ing about, he fell into a pit. And upon his not returning that day when the sun was sinking down behind the summit of the western mountains, the preceptor observed to his disciples that Upamanyu was not yet come. And they told him that he had gone out with the cattle. \"The preceptor then said, 'Upamanyu being restrained by me from the use of everything, is, of course, and therefore, doth not come home until it be late. Let us then go in search of him.' And having said this, he went with his disciples into the forest and began to shout, saying, 'Ho Upamanyu, where art thou ?' And Upamanyu hearing his precep- tor's voice answered in a loud tone, 'Here I am at the bottom of a well.' And his preceptor asked him how he happened to be there. And Upamanyu replied, 'Having eaten of the leaves of the Arka plant I became blind, and so have I fallen into this well.' And his preceptor thereupon told him, 'Glorify the twin Aswins, the joint physicians of the gods, and they will restore thee thy sight.' And Upamanyu thus directed by his preceptor began to glorify the twin Aswins, in the following words of the Rig Veda : 'Ye have existed before the creation !

Take and eat it.' And Upamanyu thus addressed, replied, 'Your words, O Aswins, have never proved untrue But without first offering this cake to my preceptor I dare not take it.' And the Aswins thereupon told him, 'Formerly, thy preceptor had invoked us. We thereupon gave him a cake like this ; and he took it without offering it to his master.

And his preceptor was well- pleased with him and said unto him, 'Thou shalt obtain prosperity even as the Aswins have said. All the Vedas shall shine in thee and all the Dharma-sastras.' And this was the trial of Upamanyu. \"Then Veda the other disciple of Ayoda-Dhaumya was called.

And one day while about to depart upon some business related to a sacrifice, he employed one of his disciples, Utanka, to take charge of his household. 'Utanka', said he, 'whatsoever should have to be done in my house, let it be done by thee without neglect.' And having given these orders to Utanka, he went on his journey. \"So Utanka always mindful of the injunction of his preceptor took up his abode in the latter's house. And while Utanka was residing there, the females of his preceptor's house having assembled addressed him and said, 'O Utanka, thy mistress is in that season when connubial connection might be fruitful. The preceptor is absent ; then stand thou in his place and do the needful.' And Utanka, thus addressed, said unto those women, It is not proper for me to do this at the bidding of women. I have not been enjoined by my preceptor to do aught that is improper.' \"After a while, his preceptor returned from his journey. And his preceptor having learnt all that had happened, became well-pleased and, a Jdressing Utanka, said, 'Utanka, my child, what favour shall I bestow on thee ?

Sometime after, Utanka again addressed his preceptor, saying, 'Command me to bring that for honorarium which you desire.' And his preceptor then said, 'My dear Utanka, thou hast often told me of your desire to bring something by way of acknowledgment for the instruction thou hast received. Go then in and ask thy mistress what thou art to bring. And bring thou that which she directs.' And thus directed by his preceptor Utanka addressed his preceptress, saying, 'Madam, I have obtained my master's leave to go home, and I am desirous of bringing something agreeable to thee as honorarium for the instruction I have received, in order that I may not depart as his debtor.

If thou shouldst succeed, good fortune shall attend thee ; if not, what good canst thou expect ?' \"Utanka thus commanded, took his departure. And as he was passing along the road he saw a bull of extraordinary size and a man of uncommon stature mounted thereon. And that man addressed Utanka and said, 'Eat thou of the dung of this bull.' Utanka, however, was unwilling to comply. The man said again, 'O Utanka, eat of it without scrutiny. Thy master ate of it before.' And Utanka signified his assent and ate of the dung and drank of the urine of that bull, and rose respectfully, and washing his hands and mouth went to where King Paushya was. 1 On arriving at the palace, Utanka saw Paushya seated (on his throne). And approaching him Utanka saluted the monarch by pro- nouncing blessings and said, 'I am come as a petitioner to thee.' And King Paushya, having returned Utanka's salutations, said, 'Sir, what shall I do for thee ?' And Utanka said, 1 came to beg of thee a pair of ear-rings as a present to my preceptor. It behoveth thee to give me the ear-rings worn by the Queen.' \"King Paushya replied, 'Go, Utanka, into the female apartments where the Queen is and demand them of her.' And Utanka went into the women's apartments. But as he could not discover the Queen, he again addressed the king, saying, 'It is not proper that I should be treated by thee with deceit. Thy Queen is not in the private apartments, for I could not find her.' The king thus addressed, considered for a while and replied, 'Recollect, Sir, with attention whether thou art not in a state of defilement in consequence of contact with the impurities of a repast. My Queen is a chaste wife and cannot be seen by any one who is impure owing to contact with the leavings of a repast. Nor doth she herself appear in sight of any one who is defiled.' \"Utanka, thus informed, reflected for a while and then said, 'Yes, it must be so. Having been in a hurry I performed my ablutions (after meal) in a standing posture.' King Paushya then said, 'Here is a transgression. Purification is not properly effected by one in a standing posture, not by one while he is going along.' And Utanka having agreed to this, sat down with his face towards the east, and washed his face, hands, and feet thoroughly.

I beg them as a present for my preceptor.' And the Queen having been highly pleased with Utanka's conduct and, considering that Utanka as an object of charity could not be passed over, took off her ear-rings and gave them to him. And she said, 'These ear-rings are very much sought after by Takshaka, the King of the serpents. Therefore shouldst thou carry them with the greatest care.' \"And Utanka being told this, said unto the Queen, 'Lady, be under no apprehension. Takshaka, Chief of the serpents, is not able to over- take me.' And having said this, and taking leave of the Queen, he went back into the presence of Paushya, and said, 'Paushya, I am gratified.' Then Paushya said to Utanka, 'A fit object of charity can only be had at long intervals. Thou art a qualified guest, therefore do I desire to perform a sraddha. Tarry thou a little. And Utanka replied, 'Yes, I will tarry, and beg that the clean provisions that are ready may be soon brought in.' And the king having signified his assent, entertained Utanka duly. And Utanka seeing that the food placed before him had hair in it, and also that it was cold, thought it unclean. And he said unto Paushya, 'Thou givest me food that is unclean, therefore shalt thou lose thy sight.' And Paushya in answer said, 'And because dost thou impute uncle^nliness to food that is clean, therefore shalt thou be without issue.' And Utanka thereupon rejoined, 'It behoveth thee not, after having offered me unclean food, to curse me in return. Satisfy thyself by ocular proof.' \"And Paushya seeing the food alleged to be unclean satisfied himself of its uncleanliness. And Paushya having ascertained that the food was truly unclean, being cold and mixed with hair, prepared as it was by a woman with unbraided hair, began to pacify the Rishi Utanka, saying, 'Sir, the food placed before thee is cold, and doth contain hair, having been prepared without sufficient care. Therefore I pray thee pardon me. Let me not become blind.' And Utanka answered, 'What I say must come to pass. Having become blind, thout mayst, however, recover the sight before long. Grant that thy curse also doth not take effect on me.' And Paushya said unto him, 1 am unable to revoke my curse. For my wrath even now hath not been appeased, But thou knowest not this.

It is otherwise in respect of these with the Kshatriya. His words are soft as new-churned butter, but his heart is like a sharp edged tool, such being the case, I am unable, because of the hardness of my heart, to neutralise my curse. Then go thou thy own way.' To this Utanka made answer, 1 showed thee the uncleanliness of the food offered to me, and I was even now pacified by thee. Besides, saidst thou at first that because I imputed uncleanliness to food that was clean I should be without issue. But the food truly unclean, thy curse cannot effect me. Of this I am sure.' And Utanka having said this departed with the ear-rings. \"On the road Utanka perceived coming towards him a naked idle beggar sometimes coming in view and sometimes disappearing. And Utanka put the ear-rings on the ground and went for water. In the meantime the beggar came quickly to the spot and taking up the ear- rings ran away. And Utanka having completed his ablutions in water and purified himself and having also reverently bowed down to the gods and his spiritual masters pursued the chief with the utmost speed. And having with great difficulty overtaken him, he seized him by force. But at that instant the person seized, quitting the form of a beggar and assuming his real form, viz., that of Takshaka, speedily entered a large hole open in the ground. And having got in, Takshaka proceeded to his own abode, the region of the serpents. \"Now, Utanka, recollecting the words of the Queen, pursued the Serpent, and began to dig open the hole with a stick but was unable to make much progress. And Indra beholding his distress sent his thunder- bolt (Vajra) to his assistance. Then the thunder-bolt entering that stick enlarged that hole. And Utanka began to enter the hole after the thunder- bolt. And having entered it, he beheld the region of the serpents infinite in extent, filled with hundres of palaces and elegant mansions with turrets and domes and gate-ways, abounding with wonderful places for various games and entertainments. And Utanka then golrified the serpents by the following slokas : \"Ye Serpents, subjects of King Airavata, splendid in battle and showering weapons in the field like lightning-charged clouds driven by the winds ! Handsome and of various forms and decked with many coloured ear-rings, ye children of Aifavata, ye shine like the Sun in the firmament I On the northern banks of the Ganges are many habitations of serpents. There I constantly adore the great serpents. Who except Airavata would desire to move in the burning rays of the Sun ?

Takshaka and Aswasena, ye are constant companions who dwell in Kurukshetra on the banks of the Ikshumati ! I also adore the illustrious Srutasena, the younger brother of Takshaka, who resided at the holy place called Mahadyumna with a view to obtaining the chiefship of the serpents. \"The Brahmana Rishi Utanka having saluted the chief serpents in this manner, obtained not, however, the ear-rings. And he thereupon became very thoughtful. And when he saw that he obtained not the ear-rings even though he had adored the serpents, he then looked about him and beheld two women at a loom weaving a piece of cloth with a fine shuttle ; and in the loom were black and white threads. And he likewise saw a wheel, with twelve spokes, turned by six boys. And he also saw a man with a handsome horse. And he began to address them the following mantras : \"This wheel whose circumference is marked by twenty-four divisions representing as many lunar changes is furnished with three hundred spokes ! It is set in continual motion by six boys (the seasons) ! These damsels representing universal nature are weaving without inter- mission a cloth with threads black and white, and thereby ushering into existence the manifold worlds and the beings that inhabit them ! Thou wielder of the thunder, the protector of the universe, the slayer of Vritra and Namuchi, thou illustrious one who wearest the black cloth and displayest truth and untruth in the universe, thou who ownest for thy carrier the horse which was received from the depths of the ocean, and which is but another form of Agni (the god of fire), I bow to thee, thou supreme Lord, thou Lord of the three worlds, O Purandara !' \"Then the man with the horse said unto Utanka, 'I am gratified by this thy adoration. What good shall I do to thee ?' And Utanka replied, 'Even let the serpents be brought under my control.' Then the man rejoined, 'Blow into this horse.' And Utanka blew into that horse. And from the horse thus blown into, there issued, from every aperture of his body, flames of fire with smoke by which the region of the Nagas was about to be consumed. And Takshaka, surprised beyond measure and terrified by the heat of the fire, hastily came out of his abode taking the ear-rings with him, and said unto Utanka, 'Pray, Sir, take back the ear-rings.' And Utanka took them back. \"But Utanka having recovered his ear-rings thought, 'O, this is that sacred day of my preceptress. I am at a distance. How can I, there-"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"ADI PARVA 47 fore, show my regard for her ? And when Utanka was anxious about this, the man addressed him and said, 'Ride this horse, Utanka, and he will in a moment carry thee to thy master's abode.' And Utanka having signified his assent, mounted the horse and presently reached his preceptor's house. \"And his preceptress that morning after having bathed was dressing her hair sitting, thinking of uttering a curse on Utanka if he should not return within time. But, in the meantime, Utanka entered his preceptor's abode and paid his respects to his preceptress and presented her the ear-rings. 'Utanka', said she, 'thou hast arrived at the proper time at the proper place. Welcome, my child ; thou art innocent and therefore I do not curse thee ! Good fortune is even before thee. Let thy wishes be crowned with success !' \"Then Utanka waited on his preceptor. And his preceptor said, Thou art welcome ! What hath occasioned thy long absence ?' And Utanka replied to his preceptor, 'Sir, in the execution of this my business obstruction was offered by Takshaka, the King of serpents. Therefore I had to go to the region of the Nagas. There I saw two damsels sitting at a loom, weaving a fabric with black and white threads. Pray, what is that? There likewise I beheld awheel with twelve spokes ceaselessly turned by six boys. What too doth that import ? Who is also the man that I saw ? And what the horse of extraordinary size likewise beheld by me ? And when I was on the road I also saw a bull with a man mounted thereon, by whom I was endearingly accosted thus, 'Utanka, eat of the dung of this bull, which was also eaten by thy master ?' So I ate of the dung of that bull according to his words. Who also is he ? Therefore, enlightened by thee, I desire to hear all about them.' \"And his preceptor thus addressed said unto him, The two damsels thou hast seen are Dhata and Vidhata ; the black and white threads denote night and day ; the wheel of twelve spokes turned by the six boys signified the year comprising six seasons. The man is Parjanya, the deity of rain ; and the horse is Agni, the god of fire. The bull that thou ha t seen on the road is Airavata, the king of elephants ; the man mounted thereon is Indra ; and the dung of the bull which was eaten by thee was Amrita. It was certainly for this (last) that thou hast not met with death in the region of the Nagas ; and Indra who is my friend having been mercifully inclined showed thee favour. It is for this that thou returnest safe, with the ear-rings about thee. Then, O thou amiable one, I give thee leave to depart.

And Utanka addressed the monarch at the proper moment in speech of correct accent and melodi- ous sounds, saying, 'O thou the best of monarchs !

Go then avenge the death of thy magnanimous father who, being bitten without cause by that vile serpent, was reduced to five elements even like a tree stricken by thunder. The wicked Takshaka, vilest of the serpent race, intoxicated with power committed an unnecessary act when he bit the King, that god-like father, the protector of the race of royal saints. Wicked in his deeds, he even caused Kasyapa (the prince of physicians) to run back when he was coming for the relief of thy father. It behoveth thee to burn the wicked wretch in the blazing fire of a snake- sacrifice. O King ! Give instant orders for the sacrifice. It is thus thou canst avenge the death of thy father.

For by that malignant wretch, O virtuous Prince, my business also was, on one occasion, obstructed, while proceed- ing on account of my preceptor.\" \"Sauti continued, 'The monarch, having heard these words, was enraged with Takshaka. By the speech of Utanka was inflamed the prince, even as the sacrificial fire with clarified butter. Moved by grief also, in the presence of Utanka, the prince asked his ministers the particulars of his father's journey to the regions of the blessed.

O great Muni, I shall first properly recount the story of this family, as told in the Puranas. \"The great and blessed saint Bhrigu, we are informed, was produced by the self-existing Brahma from the fire at sacrifice of Varuna. And Bhrigu had a son, named Chyavana, whom he dearly loved. And to Chyavana was born a virtuous son called Pramati. And Pramati had a son named Ruru by Ghritachi (the celestial danceuse).

And one day while the virtuous continent Puloma was in that condition, Bhrigu, great among those that are true to their religion, leaving her at home went out to perform his ablutions. It was then that the Rakshasa called Puloma came to Bhrigu's abode. And entering the Rishi's abode, the Rakshasa saw the wife of Bhrigu, irreproachable in everything.

And, indeed, she of agreeable smiles had been betrothed by her father himself, to him, although the former subsequently bestowed her, according to due rites, on Bhrigu. O thou of the Bhrigu race, this wound rankled deep in the Rakshasa's mind and he thought the present moment a very good opportunity for carrying the lady away. \"And the Rakshasa saw in the apartment in which the sacrificial fire was kept burning brightly. The Rakshasa then asked the flaming element. \"Tell me, O Agni, whose wife this woman rightfully is. Thou art the mouth of gods, therefore thou art bound to answer my question. This lady of superior complexion had been first accepted by me as wife, but her father subsequently bestowed her on the false Bhrigu. Tell me truly if this fair one can be regarded as the wife of Bhrigu, for having found her alone, I have resolved to bear away by force from the hermitage. My heart burneth with rage when I reflect that Bhrigu hath got possession of this woman of slender waist, first betrothed to myself.\" Sauti continued : \"In this manner the Rakshasa asked the flaming god of fire again and again whether the lady was Bhrigu's wife.

O thou respected one, then answer my question truly. Has not Bhrigu appropriated her who was chosen by me as my wife ? Thou shouldst declare truly whether, therefore she is my wife by first choice.

But this far-famed lady was bestowed by her father on Bhrigu as a gift from desire of blessing.

And the Rakshasa perceiving the infant drop from the mother's womb, shining like the sun, quitted his grasp of the woman, fell down and was instantly converted into ashes. And the beautiful Pauloma, distracted with grief, O Brahmana of the Bhrigu race, took up her offspring Chyavana, the son of Bhrigu and walked away. And Brahma, the Grand- father of all, himself saw her, the faultless wife of his son, weeping (with his eyes full of tears). And the Grand-father of all comforted her who was attached to her son. And the drops of tears which rolled down her eyes formed a great river. And that river began to follow the foot- steps of the wife of the great ascetic Bhrigu. And the Grand-father of the worlds seeing that river follow the path of his son's wife gave it a name himself, and he called it Vadhusara. And it passeth by the hermitage of Chyavana. And in this manner was born Chyavana of great ascetic power, the son of Bhrigu. \"And Bhrigu saw his child Chyavana and its beautiful mother.

He, too, who, being fully cognisant of all the particulars of an affair, doth not disclose what he knoweth, when asked, is undoubtedly stained with guilt. I can also curse thee, but Brahmanas are held by me in high respect. Although these are known to thee, O Brahmana, I will yet speak of themi so please attend ! Having, by ascetic power, multiplied myself, I am present in various forms, in places of the daily homa, at sacrifices extending for years, in places where holy rites are performed (such as marriage, &c.), and at other sacrifices. With the butter that is poured upon my flame according to the injunctions prescribed in the Vedas, the Devas and the Pitris are appeased. The Devas are the waters ; the Pitris are also the waters. The Devas have with the Pitris an equal right to the sacrifices called Darshas and Purnamashas. The Devas therefore are the Pitris and the Pitris, the Devas. They are identical beings, worshipped together and also separately at the changes of the moon. The Devas and the Pitris eat what is poured upon me. I am therefore called the mouth of the Devas and the Pitris. At the new moon the Pitris, and at the full moon the Devas, are fed through my mouth, eating of the clarified butter that is pured on me. Being, as I am, their mouth, how am I to be an eater of all things (clean and un- clean) ?' \"Then Agni, after reflecting for a while, withdrew himself from all places ; from places of the daily homa of the Brahmanas, from all long- extending sacrifices, from placas of holy rites, and from other ceremo- nies. Without their Oms and Vashats, and deprived of their Swadhas and Swakas (sacrificial mantras during offerings), the whole body of creatures became much distressed at the loss of their (sacrificial) fire.

And they said, 'O thou greatly fortunate ! Once Agni hath been cursed by Bhrigu for some reason. Indeed, being the mouth of the gods and also the first who eateth of what is offered in sacrifices, the eater also of the sacrificial butter, how will Agni be reduced to the condition of one who eateth of all things promiscuously ?' And the creator of the universe hearing these words of theirs summoned Agni to his presence. And Brahma addressed Agni, the creator of all and eternal as himseFf, in these gentle words : Thou art the creator of the worlds and thou art their destroyer ! Thou preservest the three worlds and thou art the promter of all sacrifices and ceremonies ! Therefore behave thyself so that ceremonies be not interrupted. And O thou eater of the sacrificial butter, why dost thou act so foolishly, being as thou art the Lord of all ? Thou alone art always pure in the universe and thou art its stay ! Thou shalt not with all thy body, be reduced to the state of one who eateth of all things promiscuously. O thou of flames, the flame that is in thy viler parts shall alone eat of all things alike. That body of thine which eateth of flesh (being in the stomach of all carnivorous animals) shall also eat of all things promiscuously. And as every thing touched by the sun's rays becometh pure, so shall everything be pure that shall be burnt by thy flames. Thou art, O fire, the supreme energy born of thy own power. Then, O Lord, by that power of thine make the Rishi's curse come true. Continue to receive thy own portion and that of the gods, offered at thy mouth.\" Sauti continued : Then Agni replied to the Grand-father. 'So be it.' And he then went away to obey the command of the supreme Lord. The gods and the Rishis also returned in delight to the place whence they came. And the Risliis began to perform as before their ceremonies and sacrifices. And the gods in heaven and all creatures of the world rejoiced exceedingly. And Agni too rejoiced in that he was free from the prospect of sin. \"Thus, O possessor of the six attribues, had Agni been cursed in the days of yore by Bhrigu.

At that time, O Brahmana sage, Viswavashu, the King of the Gandhar- vas, it is said, had intimacy with Menaka, the celsstial dancing-girl. And the Apsara, Menaka, O thou of the Bhrigu race, when her time was come, brought forth an infant near the hermitage of Sthulakesha. And dropping the new-born infant on the banks of the river, O Brah- mana, Menaka, the Apsara, being destitute of pity and shame, went away. And the Rishi, Sthulakesha, of great ascetic power, discovered the infant lying forsaken in a lonely part of the river-side. And he perceived that it was a female child, bright as the offspring of an Immortal and blazing, as it were, with beauty. And the great Brahmana, Sthulakesha, the first of Munis, seeing that female child, and filled with campassion, took it up and reared it. And the lovely child grew up in his holy habitation, the noble-minded and. blessed Rishi Sthulakesha performing in due succession all the ceremonies beginnning with that at birth as ordained by the divine law. And beacuse she surpassed all of her sex in goodness, beauty, and every quality, the great Rishi called her by the name of Pramadvara. And the pious Ruru having seen Pramadvara in the hermitage of Sthulakesha became one whose heart was pierced by the god of love. And Ruru by means of his companions made his father Pramati, the son of Bhrigu, acquainted with his passion. And Pramati demanded her of the far-famed Sthulakesha for his son. And her foster- father betrothed the virgin Pramadvara to Ruru, fixing the nuptials for the day when the star Varga-Daivata (Purva-phalguni) would be ascendant. \"Then within a few days of the time fixed for the nuptials, the beauti- ful virgin, while at play with companions of her own sex, her time having come, impelled by fatei trod upon a serpent which she did not perceive as it lay in coil.

And over-whelmed with grief he indulged in much piteous lamentations. And, remembering his beloved Pramadvara, lie gave vent to his sorrow in the following words : 'Alas ! the delicate fair one that increaseth my affliction lieth upon the bare ground.

And the couple passed their days, devoted to each other. And Ruru having obtained such a wife, as is hard to be found, beautiful and bright as the filaments of the lotus, made a vow for the destruction of the serpent-race. And whenever he saw a serpent, he become filled with great wrath and always killed it with a weapon; \"One day, O Brahmana, Ruru entered an extensive forest.

On recovering his senses, that truth-telling and vow-observing ascetic, burning with wrath, exclaimed, 'Since thou hast made a powerless mock snake to frighten me, thou shalt be turned even into a venomless serpent thyself by my curse/ O"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"ADI PABVA 69 ascetic, I well knew the power of his penances ; therefore with an agitated heart, I addressed him thus, bending low with joined hands, 'Friend, I did this by way of joke, to excite thy laughter. It behoveth thee to forgive me and revoke thy curse.' And seeing me sorely troubled, the ascetic was moved, and he replied, breathing hot and hard. 'What I have said, must come to pass. Listen to what I say and lay it to thy heart. O pious one ! When Ruru, the pure son of Pramati, will appear, thou shalt be delivered from the curse the moment thou seest him. Thou art the very Ruru and the son of Pramati. On regaining my native form, I will tell thee something for thy good.' \"And that illustrious man and best of Brahmanas then left his snake- body, and attained his own form and original brightness. He then addressed the following words to Ruru of incomparable power, 'O thou first of created beings, verily the highest virtue of man is sparing life of others. Therefore a Brahmana should never take the life of any creature. A Brahmana should ever be mild. This is the most sacred injunction of the Vedas. A Brahmana should be versed in the Vedas and Vedangas, and should inspire all creatures with belief in God. He should be benevolent to all creatures, truthful, and forgiving, even as it is his paramount duty to retain the Vedas in his memory. The duties of the Kshatriya are not thine. To be stern, to wield the sceptre and to rule the subjects properly are the duties of the Kshatriya. Listen, O Ruru, to the account of the destruction of snakes at the sacrifice of Janamejaya in days of yore, and the deliverance of the terrified reptiles by that bes{ of Dwijas, Astika, profound in Vedic lore and mighty in spiritual energy/' And so ends the eleventh section of the Pauloma Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION XII (Pauloma Parva continued) Sauti continued : \"Ruru then asked, 'O best of Dwijas, why was the king Janamejaya bent upon destroying the serpents ? And why and how were they saved by the wise Astika ? I am anxious to hear all this in detail.* \"The Rishi replied, 'O Ruru, the important history of Astika you will learn from the lips of Brahmanas.'

SECTION XIII (Astika Parva} Saunaka said, \"For what reason did that tiger among kings, the royal Janamejaya, determine to take the lives of the snakes by means of a sacrifice ? O Sauti, tell us in full the true story ! Tell us also why Astika, that best of regenerate ones, that foremost of ascetics, rescued the snakes from the blazing fire. Whose son was that monarch who celebrated the snake-sacrifice ? And whose son also was that best of regenerate ones ?'' Sauti said, \"O best of speakers, this story of Astika is long. I will duly relate it in full, O listen !\" , Saunaka said, \"I am desirous of hearing at length the charming story of that RisM, that illustrious Brahmana named Astika I 11 Sauti said, \"This history, (first) recited by Krishna-Dwaipayana, is called a Purana by the Brahmanas. It was formerly narrated by my wise father, Lomaharsana, the disciple of Vyasa, before the dwellers of the Naimisha forest, at their request. I was present at the recital, and, O Saunaka, since thou askest me, I shall narrate the history of Astika exactly as I heard it. O listen, as I recite in full that sin-destroying story ! \"The father of Astika was powerful like Prajapati. He was a Brahmacharin, always engaged in austere devotions. He ate sparingly, was a great ascetic, and had his lust under complete control. And he was known by the name of Jaratkaru. That foremost one among the Yayavaras, virtuous and of rigid vows, highly blessed and endued with great ascetic power, once undertook a journey over the world. He visited diverse places, bathed in diverse sacred waters, and rested where night overtook him. Endued with great energy, he practised religious austerities, hard to be practised by men of unrestrained souls. The sage lived upon air only, and renounced sleep for ever. Thus going about like a blazing fire, one day he happened to see his ancestors, hanging heads down in a great hole, their feet pointing upwards. On seeing them, Jaratkaru addressed them, saying,"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"ADI PABVA 61 'Who are you thus hanging heads down in this hole by a rope of virana fibres that is again secretly eaten into on all sides by a rat living here ?' \"The ancestors said, 'We are Rishis of rigid vows, called Yayavaras. We are sinking low into the earth for want of offspring. We have a son named Jaratkaru. Woe to us ! That wretch hath entered upon a life of austerities only ! The fool doth not think of raising offspring by marriage ! It is for that reason, viz., the fear of extinction of our race, that we are suspended in this hole. Possessed of means, we fare like unfortunates that have none ! O excellent one, who art thou that thus sorrowest as a friend on our account ? We desire to learn. O Brahmana, who thou art that standest by us, and why, O best of men, thou sorrowest for us that are so unfortunate.\" \"Jaratkaru said, 'Ye are even my sires and grandsires. I am that Jaratkaru I O, tell me, how I may serve you !\" \"The fathers then answered, 'Try thy best, O child, to beget a son to extend our line. Thou wilt then, O excellent one, have done a meri- torious act for both thyself and ourselves ! Not by the fruits of virtue, not by ascetic penances well hoarded up, one acquire th the merit which one doth by be becoming a father. Therefore, O child, by our command, set thy heart upon marriage and offspring ! Even this is our highest good ! \"Jaratkaru replied, 'I shall not marry for my sake, nor shall I earn wealth for enjoyment, but I shall do so for your welfare only. Accord- ing to this understanding, I shall, agreeably to the Sashtric ordinance, take a wife for attaining the end. I shall net act otherwise. If a bride may be had of the same name with me, whose friends would, besides, willingly give her to me as a gift in charity, I shall wed her duly. But who will give his daughter to a poor man like me for wife. I shall, however, accept any daughter given to me as alms. I shall endeavour, ye sires, even thus to wed a wife ! Having given my word, I will not act otherwise ! Upon her I will raise offspring for your redemption, so that, ye fathers, ye may attain to eternal regions (of bliss) and may rejoice as ye like I\" So ends the thirteenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"SECTION XIV (Astika Parva continued) Sauti said, \"That Brahmana of rigid vows then wandered over the Earth for a wife but a wife found he not. One day he went into the forest, and recollecting the words of his ancestors, he thrice prayed in a faint voice for a bride- Thereupon Vasuki rose and offered his sister for the Rishis acceptance. But the Brahmana hesitated to accept her, thinking her not to be of the same name with himself. The high-souled Jaratkaru thought within himself, 'I will take none for wife who is not of the same name with myself. 1 Then that Rishi of great wisdom and austere penances asked him, saying, 'Tell me truly what is the name of this thy sister, O snake.\" \"Vasuki replied, 'O Jaratkaru, this my younger sister is called Jaratkaru! Given away by me, accept this slender-waisted damsel for thy spouse ! O best of Brahmanas, for thee I reserved her. Therefore, take her !' Saying this, he off ered his beautiful sister to Jaratkaru who then espoused her with ordained rites.\" So ends the fourteenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION XV (Astika Parva continued) Sauti said, \"O foremost of persons acquainted with Brahma, the mother of the snakes had cursei them of old, saying, 'He that hath the Wind for his charioteer (vis., Agni) shall burn you all in Janamejaya's sacrifice !' It was to neutralise that curse that the chief of the snakes married his sister to that high-souled Rishi of excellent vows. The Risht wedded her according to the rites ordained (in the scriptures), and from them was born a high-souled son called Astika. An illustrious ascetic, versed in the Vedas and their branches, he regarded all with an even eye, and removed the fears of both his parents. \"Then, after a long space of time, a king descending from the Pandava line celebrated a great sacrifice known as the Snake-sacrifice. After that sacrifice had commenced for the destruction of the snakes, Astika delivered the Nagas, vi>,, his brothers and maternal uncles and other snakes (from a fiery death). And he delivered his fathers also by begetting offspring* And by his austerities, O Brahmana, and various vows and study of the Vedas, he freed himself from all his debts. By sacrifices, at which various kinds of offerings were made, he propitiated"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"ADI PABVA 68 the gods. By practising the Brahmacharya mode of life he conciliated the Rishis ; and by begetting offspring he gratified his ancestors.\" \"Thus Jaratkaru of rigid vows discharged the heavy debt he owed to his sires who being thus relieved from bondage ascended to heaven. Thus having acquired great religious merit, Jaratkaru, after a long course of years, went to heaven, leaving Astika behind. There is the story of Astika that I have related duly, Now, tell me, O tiger of Bhrigu's race, what else I shall narrate.\" So ends the fifteenth section in the Astika Paiva of the Adi Parva. SECTION XVI (Astika Parva continued} Saunaka said, \"O Sauti, relate once more in detail this history of the learned and virtuous Astika. Our curiosity for hearing it is great. O amiable one, thou speakest sweetly, with proper accent and emphasis ; and we are well pleased with thy speech. Thou speakest even as thy father. Thy sire was ever ready to please us. Tell us now the story as thy father had related it.\" Sauti said, \"O thou that art blest with longevity, I shall narrate the history of Astika as I heard it from my father ! O Brahmana, in the golden age, Prajapati had two daughters. O sinless one. the sisters were endowed with wonderful beauty. Named Kadru and Vinata, they became the wives of Kasyapa. Kasyapa derived great pleasure from his two wedded wives and being gratified he, resembling Prajapati himself, offered to give each of them a boon. Hearing that their lord was willing to confer on them their choice blessings, those excellent ladies felt transports of joy. Kadru wished to have for sons a thousand snakes all of equal splendour. And Vinata wished to bring forth two sons surpass- ing the thousand offsprings of Kadru in strength, energy, size of body, and prowess. Unto Kadru her lord gave that boon about a multitude of offsprings. And unto Vinata also, Kasyapa said, 'Be it so !' Then Vinata, having obtained her prayer, rejoiced greatly. Obtaining two sons of superior prowess, she regarded her boon fulfilled. Kadru also obtained her thousand sons of equal splendour. 'Bear the embroyos care- fully/ said Kasyapa, and then he went into the forest, leaving his two wives pleased with his blessings.\" Sauti continued, \"O best of regenerate ones, after a long time, Kadru brought forth a thousand eggs, and Vinata two. Their maid- servants deposited the eggs separately in warm vessels. Five hundred years passed away, and the thousand eggs produced by Kadru burst and"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"64 MAHABHARATA outcame the progeny. But the twins of Vinata did not appear. Vinata was jealous, and therefore she broke one of the eggs and found in it an embryo with ttie upper part developed but the lower one undeveloped. At this, the child in the egg became angry and cursed his mother, saying, since thou hast prematurely broken this egg, them shalt serve as a slave- Shouldst thou wait five hundred years and not destroy, or render the other egg half-developed, by breaking it through impatience, then the illustrious chijd witnin it will deliver thee from slavery ! And if thou wouldst have the child strong, thou must take tender care of the egg for all this time !' Thus cursing his mother, the child rose to the sky. O Brahm.ina, even he is the charioteer of Surya, always seen in the hour of morning ! \"Then at the expiration of the five hundred years, bursting open the other egg, out came Gadura, the serpent-eater. O tiger of Bhrigu's race, immediately on seeing the light, that son of Vinata left his mother. And the lord of birds, feeling hungry, took wing in quest of the food assigned to him by the Great Ordamer of all. So ends the sixteenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION XVII (Astika Parva continued) Sauti said, \"O ascetic, about this time the two sisters saw approach ing near, that steed of complacent appearance named Uchchaisravas who was worshipped by the gods, that gem of steeds, who arose at the churning of the Ocean for nectar. Divine, graceful, perpetually young, creation's master-piece, and of irresistible vigour, it was blest with every auspicious mark.\" Saunaka asked, 'Why did the gods churn the Ocean for nectar, and under what circumstances, when, as you say, sprang that best of steeds so powerful and resplendent ?\" Sauti said, \"There is mountain named Meru, of blazing appearance, and looking like a heap of effulgence. The rays of the Sun falling on its peaks of golden lustre are dispersed by them. Decked with gold and exceedingly beautiful, that mountain is the haunt of the gods and the Qandharvas. It is immeasurable and unapproachable by men of manifold sins. Dreadful beasts of prey wander over its breasts and it is illumina- ted by many divine life-giving herbs. It stands kissing the heavens by its height and is the first of mountains. Ordinary people cannot even think of ascending it. It is graced with trees and streams, and resounds with the charming melody of winged choirs. Once the celestials sat on"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"ADI PABVA 66 its begemmed peak and sat in conclave. They who had practised penances and observed excellent vows for amrita now seemed to be eager seekers after amrita (celestial ambrosia). Seeing the celestial assembly in anxious mood Narayana said to Brahman, 'Do thou churn the Ocean with the gods and the asuras. By doing so, amrita will be obtained as also all drugs and gems. O ye gods, churn the Ocean, ye will discover amrita !\" So ends the seventeenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva. Sfliiri SECTION XVIII (Astika Parva continued) Sauti said, \"There is a mountain called Mandara adorned with cloud-like peaks. It is the best of mountains, and is covered all over with inter-twining herbs. There countless birds pour forth their melodies, and beasts of prey roam about. The gods, the Apsaras and the Kinnaras visit the place. Upwards it rises eleven thousand yojanas, and descends downwards as much. The gods wanted to tear it up and use it as a churning rod but failing to do so came to Vishnu and Brahman who were sitting together, and said unto them, 'Devise some efficient scheme, consider, ye gods, how Mandra may be dislodged for our good !\" Sauti continued, \"O son of Bhrigu ! Vishnu with Brahman assented to it. And the lotus-eyed one (Vishnu) laid the hard task on the mighty Ananta, the prince of snakes. The powerful Ananta, directed thereto both by Brahman and Narayana, O Brahmana, tore up the mountain with the woods thereon and with the denizens of those woods. And the gods came to the shore of the Ocean with Ananta and addressed the Ocean, saying, O Ocean, we have come to churn thy water for obtain* ing nectar !' And the Ocean replied, 'Be it so, as I shall not go without a share of it. I am able to bear the prodigious agitation of my water set up by the mountain/ The gods then went to the king of tortoises and said to him, O Tostoise-king, thou wilt have to hold the mountain on thy back I 1 The Tortoise-king agreed, and Indra contrived to place the mountain on the former's back. And the gods and the Asuras made Mandara churning staff and Vasuki the cord, and set about churning the deep for amrita. The Asuras held Vasuki by the hood and the gods held him by the tail. And Ananta. who was on the side of the gods, at intervals raised the snake's hood and suddenly lowered it. And in consequence of the stretch Vasuki received at the hands of the gods and the Asuras, black vapours with flames issued from his mouth. These, turned into clouds charged with lightning, 9"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"66 MAHABHABATA poured showers that refreshed the tired gods. And flowers that also fell on all sides of the celestials from the trees on the whirling Mandara, refreshed them. \"Then O Brahmana, out of the deep came a tremendous roar like unto the roar of the clouds at the Universal Dissolution. Diverse aquatic animals being crushed by the great mountain gave up the ghost in the salt waters. And many denizens of the lower regions and the world of Varuna were killed. Large trees abounding with birds on the whirling Mandara were torn up by the roots and fell into the water. The mutual friction of those trees also produced fires that blazed up frequently. The mountain thus looked like a mass of dark clouds charged with lightning O Brahmana, the fire spread, and consumed the lions, elephants and other creatures that were on the mountain. Then Indra extinguished that fire by pouring down heavy showers. \"After the churning, O Brahmana, had gone on for some time, gummy exudations of various trees and herbs vested with the properties of amrita mingled with the waters of the Ocean. And the celestials attained to immortality by drinking of the water mixed with those gums and with the liquid extract of gold. By degrees, the milky water of the agitated deep turned into clarified butter by virtue of those gums and juices. But nectar did not appear even then. The gods came before the boon-granting Brahman seated on his seat and said, 'Sire, we are spent up, we have not any strength left to churn further. Nectar hath not yet arisen so that now we have no resource save Narayana !' \"On hearing them, Brahman said to Narayana, 4 O Lord, condescend to grant the gods strength to churn the deep afresh !' \"Then Narayana agreeing to grant their various prayers, said, *Ye wise ones, I grant ye \"sufficient strength ! Go, put the mountain in position again and churn the water !' \"Re-established thus in strength, the gods recommenced churning. After a while, the mild Moon of a thousand rays emerged from the Ocean. Thereafter sprung forth Lakshmi dressed in white, then Soma, then the White Steed, and then the celestial gem Kaustubha which graces the breast of Narayana. Then Lakshmi, Soma and the Steed, fleet as the mind, all came before the gods on high. Then arose the divine Dhanwantari himself with the white vessel of nectar in his hand. And seeing him, the Asuras set up a loud cry, saying, 'It be ours. 1 \"And at length rose the great elephant, Airavata, of huge body and with two pair of white tusks. And him took Indra the wielder of the thunder-bolt. But with the churning still going on, poison Kalakuta appeared at last. Engulfing the Earth it suddenly blazed up like a fire attended with fumes. And by the scent of the fearful Kalakuta, the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"ADI PAKVA 67 three worlds were stupefied. And then Siva, being solicited by Brahman, swallowed that poison for the safety of the creation. The divine Maheswara held it in his throat, and it is said that from that time he is called Nilakantha (blue-throated). Seeing all these wondrous things, the Asuras were filled with despair, and got themselves prepared for entering into hostilities with the gods for the possession of Lakshmi and Amrita. Thereupon Narayana called his bewitching Maya (illusive power) to his aid, and assuming the form of an enticing female, con- quetted with the Danavas. The Danavas and the Daityas, charmed with her exquisite beauty and grace lost their reason and unanimously placed the Amrita in the hands of that fair damsel.\" So ends the eighteenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION XIX (Astika Parva continued) Sauti said, \"Then the Daityas and the Danavas equipped with first class armours and various weapons attacked the gods. In the meantime the valiant Lord Vishnu in the form of an enchantress accompanied by Nara deceived the mighty Danavas and took away the Amrita from their hands, 11 And all the gods at that time of great fright drank the Amrita with delight, receiving it from Vishnu. And while the gods were partaking of it, after which they had so much hankered, a Danava named Rahu was also drinking it among them in the guise of a god. And when the Amrita had reached Rahu's throat only, Surya and Soma (recognised him and) intimated the fact to the gods. And Narayana instantly cut off with his discus the well-adorned head of the Danava who was drink- ing the Amrita without permission. And the huge head of the Danava, cut off by the discus and resembling a mountain peak, then rose up to the sky and began to utter dreadful cries. And the Danava's headless trunk, falling upon the ground and rolling thereon, made the Earth tremble with her mountains, forests and islands. And from that time there is a long-standing quarrel between Rahu's head and Surya and Soma. And to this day it swalloweth Surya and Soma (during solar and lunar eclipse). Then Narayana quitting his enchanting female form and hurling many terrible weapons at the Danavas, made them tremble. And thus on the shores of the salt-water sea, commenced the dreadful battle of the gods and the Asuras, And sharp-pointed javelins and lances and"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"68 MAHABHABATA various weapons by thousands began to be discharged on all sides. And mangled with the discus and wounded with swords, darts and maces, the Asuras in large numbers vomited blood and lay prostrate on the Earth. Cut off from the trunks with sharp double-edged swords, heads adorned with bright gold fell continually on the field of battle. Their bodies drenched in gore, the great Asuras lay dead everywhere. It seemed as if red-dyed mountain peaks lay scattered all around. And when the Sun rose in his splendour, thousands of warriors struck one another with weapons. And cries of distress were heard everywhere. The warriors fighting at a distance from one another brought one another down by sharp iron missiles, and those fighting at close quarters slew one another with blows of their fists. And the air was filled with shrieks of distress. Everywhere were heard the alarming sounds, 'cut' 'pierce, 1 'at them,' 'hurl down/ 'advance/ \"And when the battle was raging fiercely, Nara and Narayana enter- ed the field. And Narayana seeing the celestial bow in the hand of Nara, called to mind his own weapon, the Danava-destroying discus. And lo ! the discus, Sudarshana, destroyer of enemies, like to Agni in effulgence and dreadful in battle, came from the sky as soon as thought of. And when it came, Narayana of fierce energy, possessing arms like the trunk of an elephant, hurled with great force that weapon of extra- ordinary lustre, effulgent as blazing fire, dreadful and capable of destroying hostile towns. And that discus blazing like the fire that con- sumeth all things at the end of Yuga, hurled with force from the hands of Narayana, and falling constantly everywhere, destroyed the Daityas and the Danavas by thousands. Sometimes it blazed like fire and consumed them all ; sometimes it struck them down as it coursed through the sky ; and sometimes, falling on the Earth, it drank their life-blood like a goblin. \"On the other hand, the Danavas, white as the clouds from which the rain hath dropped, possessing great strength and bold hearts, ascended the sky, and by hurling down thousands of mountains, continually harassed the gods. And those dreadful mountains, like masses of clouds, with their trees and flat tops, falling from the sky, collided with one another and produced a tremendous roar. And when thousands of warriors shouted without intermission in the field of battle and mountains with the woods thereon began to fall around, the Earth with her forests trembled. Then the divine Nara appeared at the scene of the dreadful conflict between the Asuras and the Qanas (the followers of Rudra), and reducing to dust those rocks by means of his gold-headed arrows, he covered the heavens with dust. Thus discomfitured by the gods, and seeing the furious discus scouring the fields of heaven like a"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"ADI PABVA 69 blazing flame, the mighty Danavas entered the bowels of the Earth, while others plunged into the sea of salt-waters. \"And having gained the victory, the gods offered due respect to Mandara and placed him again on his own base. And the nectar-bearing gods made the heavens resound with their shouts, and went to their own abodes. And the gods, on returning to the heavens, rejoiced greatly, and Indra and the other deities made over to Narayana the vessel of Amrita for careful keep.\" And so ends the nineteenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION XX (Astika Parva continued) Sauti said, \"Thus have I recited to you the whole story of how Amrita was churned out of the Ocean, and the occasion on which the horse Uchchaisravas of great beauty and incomparable prowess was obtained. It was this horse about which Kadru asked Vinata, saying, 'Tell me,, amiable sister, without taking much time, of wliat colour Uchchaisravas is.' And Vinata answered, 'That prince of steeds is certainly white. What dost thou think, sister ? Say thou what is its colour. Let us lay a wager upon it.* Kadru replied, then 'O thou of sweet smiles, I think that horse is black in its tail. Beauteous one, bet with me that she who loseth will become the other's slave/ Sauti continued, \"Thus wagering with each other about menial ser- vice as a slave, the sisters went home, and resolved to satisfy themselves by examining the horse next day. And Kadru, bent upon practising a deception, ordered her thousand sons to transform themselves into black hair and speedily cover the horse's tail\" in order that she might not become a slave. But her sons, the snakes, refusing to do her bidding, she cursed them, saying, 'During the snake-sacrifice of the wise king Janamejaya of the Pandava race, Agni shall consume you all.' And the Grand-sire (Brahman) himself heard this exceedingly cruel curse pro- nounced by Kadru, impelled by the fates. And seeing that the snakes had multiplied exceedingly, the Grand-sire, moved by kind considera- tion for his creatures, sanctioned with all the gods this curse of Kadru.

O son, do not grieve for it in the least. The destruction of the snakes in the sacrifice hath, indeed, been ordained long ago. Saying this, the divine Creator of the Universe comforted Kasyapa and imparted to that illustrious one the knowledge of neutralising poison.\" And so ends the twentieth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION XXI (Astika Parva continued) Sauti said, \"Then when the night had passed away and the sun had risen in the morning, O thou whose wealth is asceticism, the two sisters Kadru and Vinata, having laid a wager about slavery, went with haste and impatience to view the steed Uchchaisravas from a near point.

It is holy, beneficial to the gods, and is the great source of nectar ; without limits, inconceivable, sacred, and highly wonderful. It is dark, terrible with the sound of aquatic creatures, tremendously roaring, and full of deep whirl-pools. It is an object of terror to all creatures. Moved by the winds blowing from its shores and heaving high, agitated and disturbed, it seems to dance everywhere with uplifted hands represented by its surges.

It becomes the bed of the lotus-naveled Vishnu when at the termination of every Yuga that deity of immeasurable power enjoys yoga-nidra, the deep sleep under the spell of spiritual meditation. It is the refuge of Mainaka fearful of falling thunder, and the retreat of the Asuras over- come in fierce encounters.

If, on the other hand, she were graciously inclined, she might free them from her curse. They said, 'We will certainly render the horse's tail black.' And it is said that they then went and became hairs in the horse's tail. \"Now the two co-wives had laid the wager.

They then both beheld that foremost of steeds of great speed, with body white as the rays of the moon but having black hairs (in the tail). And observing many black hairs in the tail, Kadru put Vinata, who was deeply dejected, into slavery. And thus Vinata having lost the wager, entered into a state of slavery and became exceedingly sorry. \"In the meantime, when his time came, burst forth from the egg without (the, help of his) mother, Garuda of great splendour, enkindling all the points of the universe, that mighty being endued with strength, that bird capable of assuming at will any form, of going at will every- where, and of calling to his aid at will any measure of energy. Effulgent like a heap of fire, he shone terribly. Of lustre equal to that of the fire at the end of the Yuga, his eyes were bright like the lightning-flash. And soon after birth, that bird grew in size and increasing his body ascended the skies. Fierce and vehemently roaring, he looked as terrible as second Ocean-fire. And all the deities seeing him, sought the protection of Vibhavasa (Agni). And they bowed down to that deity of manifold forms seated on his seat and spake unto him these words :'O Agni, extend not thy body ! Wilt thou consume us ? Lo, this huge heap of thy flames is spreading wide !' And Agni replied, 'O, ye persecutors of the Asuras, it is not as ye imagine !

And, echoing with the notes of various birds, it delighted greatly the sons of Kadru. \"And the snakes, after arriving at that forest, began to enjoy them- selves. And they commanded the lord of birds, viz., Garuda, of great energy, saying, 'Convey us to some other fair island with pure water.

Garuda, after reflecting for a few moments, asked his mother Vinata, saying, 'Why, mother, have I to do the bidding of the snakes?' Vinata thus questioned by him spake unto that ranger of the skies, viz. t her son, invested with every virtue, of great energy, and great strength as follows : \"Vinata said, 'O thou best of birds, I have become, from misfortune, the slave of my co-wife.

And as birds in great affliction ascend by thousands into the skies when the trees in a forest are shaken by the winds, so those Nishadas blinded by the dust raised by the storm entered the wide- extending cleft of Garuda's mouth open to receive them. And then the hungry lord of all rangers of the skies, that oppressor of enemies, endued with great strength, and moving with greatest celerity to achieve his end, closed his mouth, killing innumerable Nishadas following the occupation of fishermen.\" So ends the twenty-eighth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"SECTION XXIX (Astika Parva continued) Sauti continued, \"A certain Brahmana with his wife had entered the throat of that ranger of the skies.

Then again, enemies in the guise of friends cause estrangements between ignorant and selfish men after they become separated in wealth, and pointing out faults confirm their quarrels, so that the latter soon fall one by one.

For these reasons the wise never speak approvingly of partition amongst brothers who, when divided do not regard the most authoritative Sastras and live always in fear of each other. But as thou, Supritika, without regarding my advice impelled by desire of separation, always wishest to make an arrangement about your property, thou shalt become an elephant !' Supritika, thus cursed, then spake unto Vibha- vau, 'Thou also shalt become a tortoise moving in the midst of the waters !\" \"And thus on account of wealth those two fools, Supritika and Vibhavasu, from each other's curse, have become an elephant and a tortoise. Owing to their wrath, they have both become inferior animals. And they are engaged in hostilities with each other, proud of ther exces- sive strength and the weight of their bodies.

And remembering the words of his father, that ranger of the skies possessed of great swiftness of motion, seized the elephant and the tortoise, one in each clow. And that bird then soared high into the air. And he came upon a sacred place called Alamva and saw many divine trees. And struck by the wind raised by his wings, those trees began to shake with fear. And those divine trees having golden boughs feared that they would break. And the ranger of the skies seeing that those trees capable of granting every wish were quaking with fear, went to other trees of incomparable appearance. And those gigantic trees were adorned with fruits of gold and silver and branches of precious gems. And they were washed with the water of the sea. And there was a large banian among them, which had grown into gigantic proportions, that spoke unto that lord of birds coursing towards it with the fleetness of the mind, 'Sit thou on this large branch of mine extending a hundred yojanas and eat the elephant and the tortoise.'

Casting his eyes around in wonder he saw Valakhilya Rishis hanging threfrom with heads downwards and engaged in ascetic penances. Reflecting that 'if that bough fell down, the Rishis would be slain,' the mighty one held the elephant and the tortoise still more firmly with his claws. And from fear of slaying the Rishis and desire of saving them, held that bough in his beaks, and rose on his wings. The great Rishis were struck with wonder at the sight of that act of his which was beyond even the power of the gods, and gave that mighty bird a name.

Kasyapa also saw his son, that ranger of the skies, of divine form, possessed of great splen- dour, and energy and strength, and endued with speed of the wind or the mind, huge as a mountain peak, a ready smiter like the curse of a Brahmana, inconceivable, indescribable, frightful to all creatures, poss- essed of great prowess, terrible, of the splendour of Agni himself, and incapable of being overcome by the deities, Danavas, and invincible Rakshasas, capable of splitting mountain summits and sucking the ocean itself and destroying the three worlds, fierce, and looking like Yama him- self.

It behoveth you to accord him your permission I\" Sauti continued, \"Those ascetics thus addressed by the illustrious Kasyapa, abandoned that bough and went to the sacred mountain of Himavat for purposes of ascetic penances. After those Rishis had gone away, the son of Vinata, with voice obstructed by the bough in his beaks, asked his father Kasyapa saying *O illustrious one, where shall I throw this arm of the tree? O illustrious one, indicate to me some region with- out human beings !\" Then Kasyapa spoke of a mountain without human beings with caves and dales always covered with snow and incapable of approach by ordinary creatures even in thought. And the great bird bearing that branch, that elephant, and that tortoise, proceeded with great speed towards that mountain. The great arm of the tree with which that bird of huge body flew away could not be girt round with a cord made of a hundred (cow) hides. Garuda, the lord of birds, then flew away for hundred thousands of yojanas within the shortest time.

Such thing had never happened even during the war between the gods and the Asuras. And the winds blew accompanied with thunder, and meteors fell by thousands. And the sky, though cloudless, roared tremendously. And even he who was the god of gods shed showers of blood. And the flowery garlands on the necks of the gods faded and their prowess suffered diminution. And terrible masses of clouds dropped thick showers of blood. And the dust raised by the winds darkened the splendour of the very coronets of the gods. And He of a thousand sacrifices (Indra), with the other gods, perplexed with fear at the sight of those dark forebodings spoke unto Vrihaspati thus, --'Why, O worshipful one, have these natural disturbances suddenly arisen ? No foe do I behold who would oppress us in war !'

So ends the thirtieth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION XXXI (Astika Parva continued) Saunaka said, \"O son of a Suta, what was Indra's fault, what, his act of carelessness ? How was Garuda born in consequence of the ascetic penances of the Valakhilyas ? Why also Kasyapa a Brahman had the king of birds for a son? Why, too, was he invincible of all creatures and unslayableof all ? Why also was that ranger of the skies capable of going into every place at will and of mustering at will any measure of energy ? If these are described in the Purana, I should like to hear them !\" Sauti said, \"What thou askest me is, indeed, the subject of the Purana. O twice-born one, listen as I briefly recite it all I\" \"Once upon a time, when the lord of creation, Kasyapa, was engaged in a sacrifice from desire of offspring, the RisHis, the gods, and the Gandharvas, all gave him help. And Indra was appointed by Kasyapa to bring the sacrificial fuel ; and with him those ascetics the Valakhilyas, and all the other deities. And the lord Indra, taking up according to his own strength, a weight that was mountain like, brought it without any fatigue. And he saw on the way some Rishis, of bodies of the measure of the thumb, all together carrying one single stalk of a Palasa (Butea /rondosa) leaf. And those Rishis were, from want of food, very lean- fleshed almost merged in their own bodies. And they were so weak that they were much afflicted when sunk in the water that collected in an indentation on the road produced by the hoof of a cow. And Purandara,"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"86 MAHABHABATA proud of his strength, beheld them with surprise, and laughing at them in derision soon left them behind insulting them, besides, by passing over their heads. And those Rishis being thus insulted were filled with rage and sorrow. And they made preparations for a great sacrifice at which Indra was terrified. Hear, O Saunaka, of the wish for accomplishment of which tluse vow-observing wise, and excellent ascetics poured clari- fied butter of the sacrificial fire with loudly uttered mantras ! There shall be another Indra of all gods, capable of going everywhere at will, and of mustering at will any measure of energy, and striking fear into the (present) king of the gods. By the fruit of our ascetic penance, let one arise, fleet as the mind, and fierce withal !' And the lord of the celestials of a hundred sacrifices, having come to know of this, became very much alarmed and sought the protection of the vow-observing Kasyapa. And the Prajapati Kasyapa, hearing everything from Indra, went to the Valakhilyas and asked them if their sacrifice had been successful. And those truth-speaking Rishis replied to him, saying, 'Let it be as thou sayest I' And the Prajapati Kasyapa pacifying them, spake unto them as follows : 'By the word of Brahman, this one (Indra) hath been made the Lord of the three worlds ! Ye ascetics, ye also are striving to create another Indra I Ye excellent ones, it behoveth you not to falsify the word of Brahman ! Let not also this purpose, for (accomplishing) which ye are striving, be rendered futile 1 Let there spring an Indra (Lord) of winged creatures, endued with excess of strength ! Be gracious unto Indra who is a suppliant before you !' And the Valakhilyas, thus addressed by Kasyapa, after offering reverence to that first of the Munis, viz., the Prajapati Kasyapa, spake unto him.\" \"The Valakhilyas said, 'O Prajapati, this sacrifice of us all is for an Indra! Indeed this hath also been meant for a son being born unte theel Let this task be now left to thee ! And in this matter do whatsoever thou seest to be good and proper !' ' Sauti continued, 'Meanwhile, moved by the desire of offspring, the good daughter of Daksha, the vow-observing amiable, and fortunate Vinata, her ascetic penances over, having purified herself with a bath in that season when connubial companionship might prove fruitful, approached her lord. And Kasyapa spake unto her, 'Respected one, the sacrifice commenced by me hath borne fruit ! What hath been desired by thee shall come to pass. Two heroic sons shall be born unto thee, who shall be the lords of the three worlds ! By the penances of the Valakhilyas and by virtue of the desire with which I commenced my sacrifice, those sons shall be of exceedingly good fortune and worshipped in the three worlds !'

From them no injury shall result unto thee. Let thy sorrow cease ; thou shalt continue as the lord of all ! Let not, however, the utterers of the name of Brahma be ever again slighted by thee ! Nor let the very wrathful ones, whose words are even the thunder-bolt, be ever again insulted by thee !' Indra, thus addressed, went to heaven, his fears dispelled. And Vinata also, her purpose fulfilled, was exceedingly glad. And she gave birth to two sons, Aruna and Garuda. And Aruna, of undeveloped body, became the fore-runner of the Sun. And Garuda was vested with the lordship over the birds. O thou of Bhrigu's race, hearken now to the mighty achievement of Garuda I\" So ends the thirty-first section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION XXXII (Astika Parva continued) Sauti said, \"O foremost of Brahmanas, the gods having themselves prepared for battle in that way, Garuda, the king of birds, soon came upon those wise ones. And the gods beholding him of excessive strength began to quake with fear, and strike one another with all their weapons And amongst those that guarded the Soma was Brahmana (the celestial architect), of measureless might, effulgent as the electric fire and of great energy. And after a terrific encounter lasting only a moment, managed by the lord of birds with his talons, beak, and wings, he lay as dead on the fields. And the ranger of the skies darking the worlds with the dust raised by the hurricane of his wings, overwhelmed the celestials with it. And the latter, overwhelmed with that dust, swooned away. And the immortals who guarded the amrita, blinded by that dust, could no longer see Garuda ! Even thus did Garuda agitate the region of the heavens. And even thus he mangled the gods with the wounds inflicted by his wings and beak.\" \"Then the god of thousand eyes commanded Vayu (the god of wind,), saying, 'Dispell thou this shower of dust soon! O Maruta, this is, indeed, thy task !' Then the mighty Vayu soon drove away that dust. And when the darkness had disappeared, the celestials attacked Garuda.

And the king of birds, attacked them on all sides with showers of various weapons and fought exceedingly hard without wavering for a moment. And the son of Vinata, of great prowess blazing in the sky, attacked the gods on all sides with his wings and breast. And blood began to flow copiously from the bodies of the gods mangled by the talons and the beak of Garuda. Overcome by the lord of birds, the Sadhyas with the Gandharvas fled eastwards, the Vasus with the Rudras towards the south, the Adityas towards the west, and the twin Aswins towards the north. Gifted with great energy, they retreated fighting, looking back every moment on their enemy.\" And Garuda had encounters with the Yakshas Aswakranda of great courage, Rainuka, the bold Krathanaka, Tapana, Uluka, Swasanaka, Nimesha, Praruja, and Pulina. And the son of Vinata mangled them with his wings, talons, and beak, like Siva himself, that chastiser of enemies, and the holder of Pinaka in rage at the end of the Yttga. And those Yakshas of great might and courage, mangled all over by that ranger of the skies, looked liked masses of black clouds dropping thick showers of blood.\" \"And Garuda, depriving them of life, then went to where the amrita was. And he saw that it was surrounded on all sides by fire. And the terrible flames of that fire covered the entire sky. And moved by violent winds, they seemed bent on burning the Sun himself. The illustrious Garuda then assumed ninety times ninety mouths and quickly drinking the waters of many rivers with those mouths and returning with great speed, that chastiser of enemies, having wings for his vehicle, extin- guished that fire with that water. And extinguishing that fire, he assumed a very small form, desirous of entering into ( vhere the Soma was).\" So ends the thirty-second section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.

And that fierce instrument, of the splendour of the blazing sun and of terrible form, had been devised by the gods for cutting into pieces all robbers of the Soma. Garuda, seeing a passage through it, stopped there for a moment. Diminishing his body, in an instant he passed through the spokes of that wheel. Within the line of the wheel, he beheld, stationed there for guarding the Soma two great snakes of the effulgence of blazing fire, with tongues bright as the lightning-flash, of great energy, with mouth emitting fire, with blazing eyes, containing poison, very terrible, always in anger, and of great activity. Their eyes were cease- lessly inflamed with rage and were also winkless. He who may be seen by even one of the two would instantly be reduced to ashes. The bird of fair feathers suddenly covered their eyes with dust. And unseen by them he attacked them from all sides. And the son of Vinata, that ranger of the skies, attacking their bodies, mangled them into pieces. He then approached the Soma without loss of time. Then the mighty son of Vinata, taking up the Amrita from the place where it was kept, rose on his wings with great speed, breaking into pieces the machine that had surrounded it. And the bird soon came out, taking the Amrita but without drinking it himself. And he then wended on his way without the least fatigue, darkening the splendour of the Sun.\" \"And the son of Vinata then met Vishnu on his way along the sky. And Narayana was gratified at that act of self-denial on the part of Garuda, And that deity, knowing no deterioration, said unto the ranger of the skies, 'O, I am inclined to grant thee a boon !' The ranger of the skies thereupon said, 'I shall stay above thee f And he again spake unto Narayana these words : 'I shall be immortal and free from disease without (drinking) Amrita !' Vishnu said unto the son of Vinata, 'Be it so.' Garuda, receiving those two boons, told Vishnu, 1 also shall grant thee a boon ; therefore, let the possessor of the six attributes ask of me !' Vishnu then asked the mighty Garuda to become his carrier. And he made the bird sit on the flagstaff of his car, saying, 'Even thus thou shalt stay above me !' And the ranger of the skies, of great speed, saying unto Narayana 'Be it so,' swiftly wended on his way, mocking the wind with his fleetness.\" \"And while that foremost of all rangers of the skies, that first of winged creatures, Garuda, was coursing through the air after robbing the Amrita, Indra hurled at him his thunder-bolt.

O thou of a thousand sacrifices, the good never approve of speaking highly of their own strength, nor do they speak of their own merits.

Garuda answered, 'There is a certain reason for which the Soma is being carried by me. I shall not give the Soma to any one for drink. But, O thuu of a thousand eyes, after I have placed it down, thou, O lord of the heavens, canst then, taking it up, instantly bring it away 1' Indra then said, 'O ovipaious one, I am highly gratified with these words now spoken by thee I O best of all rangers of the skies, accept from me any boon that thou desirest I' \""},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Q^, ADI PABVA 91 Sauti continued, \"Then Garuda, recollecting the sons of Kadru and remembering also the bondage of his mother caused by an act of decep- tion owing to the well-known reason (viz., the curse of Aruna), said, 'Although I have power over all creatures, yet I shall do your bidding.

Mean- while, Sakra taking up the Amrita, wended back to heaven.

They saw that the bed of kusa grass whereon the Amrita had been placed was empty, the Amrita itself having been taken away by a counter-act of deception. And they began to lick with their tongues the kusa grass, as the Amrita had been placed thereon. And the tongues of the snakes by that act became divided in twain. And the kusa grass, too, from the contact with Amrita, became sacred thenceforth. Thus did the illustrious Garuda bring Amrita (from the heavens) for the snakes, and thus were the tongues of snakes divided by what Garuda did. \"Then the bird of fair feathers, very much delighted, enjoyed him- self in those woods accompanied by his mother. Of grand achievements, and deeply reverenced by all rangers of the skies, he gratified his mother by devouring the snakes.\" \"That man who would listen to this story, or read it out to an assembly of good Brahmanas, must surely go to heaven, acquiring great merit from the recitation of (the feats of) Garuda.''

And the monarch wandered about, hunting deer, and wild boars, and wolves, and buffaloes and various other kinds of wild animals. One day, having pierced a deer with a sharp arrow and slung his bow on his back, he penetrated into the deep forest, searching for the animal here and there, like the illustri- ous Rudra himself of old pursuing in the heavens* bow in hand, the deer which was Sacrifice, itself turned into that shape, after having pierced it. No deer that was pierced by Parikshit had ever escaped in the wood with life. This deer, however wounded as before, fled with speed, as the (proximate) cause of the king's attainment to heaven. And the deer that Parikshit, \"that king of men had pierced was lost to his gaze and drew the monarch far away into the forest. And fatigued and thirsty, he came across a Muni, in the forest, seated in a cow-pen and drinking to his fill the froth oozing out of the mouths of calves sucking the milk of their dams. And approaching him hastily, the monarch, hungry and fatigued, and raising his bow, asked that Muni of rigid vows saying, 'O Brahmana, I am king Parikshit the son of Abhimanyu. A deer pierced by me hath been lost. Hast thou seen it ?' But that Muni, observing then the vow of silence, spoke not unto him a word. And the king in anger thereupon placed upon his shoulder a dead snake, taking it up with the end of his bow. The Muni suffered him to do it without protest. And he spoke not a word, good or bad. And the king seeing him in that state, cast off his anger and became sorry. And he returned to his capital but the RisKi continued in the same state. The forgiving Muni, knowing that the monarch who was a tiger amongst kings was true to the duties of his order, cursed him not, though insulted. That tiger amongst monarchs, that foremost one of Bharata's race, also did not know that the person whom he had so insulted was a virtuous Rishi. It was for this that he had so insulted him/* *'That RisHi had a son by name Sringin, of tender years, gifted with great energy, deep in ascetic penances, severe in his vows, very wrath- ful, and difficult to be appeased.

If thou destroy Dharma, verily Dharma will destroy thee. If the king do not properly protect us, we fare very ill ; we cannot perform our religious rites according to our desire. But protected by righteous sovereigns, we attain immense merit, and they are entitled to a share thereof. Therefore, reigning royalty is by all means to be forgiven. And Parikshit like unto his great-grandsire, protecteth us as a king should protect his subjects. That penance-practising monarch was fatigued and oppressed with hunger. Ignorant of my vow (of silence) he did this. A kingless country always suffereth from evils.

Impelled by Fate and the words of the Rishi, the king, with his ministers, felt the desire of eating those fruits. The particular fruit, within which Takshaka had entered, was taken by the king himself for eating.

SECTION XLVII (Astika Parva continued) Sauti said, \"Then Vasuki spake unto the Rishi Jaratkaru these words : 'O best of Brahmanas, this maiden is of the same name with thee ! She is my sister and hath ascetic merit. I will maintain thy wife ; accept of her ! O thou of ascetic wealth, I shall protect her with all my ability.

And taking his bride with him, adored by the great Rishi, he entered the delightful chamber set apart for him by the king of the snakes. And in that chamber was a bed-stead covered with very valuable coverlets. And Jaratkaru lived there with his wife. And the excellent Rishi made an agreement with his wife, saying, 'Nothing must ever be done or said by thee that is against my liking. And in case of thy doing any such thing, I will leave thee and no longer continue to stay in thy house. Bear in mind these words that have been spoken by me.' ' 11 And then the sister of the king of the snakes in great anxiety and grieving exceedingly, spoke unto him, saying, 'Be it so.' And moved by the desire of doing good to her relatives, that damsel, of unsullied reputation, began to attend upon her lord with the wakefulnessof a dog, the timidity of a deer, and knowledge of signs possessed by the crow. And one day, after the menstrual period, the sister of Vasuki, having puri- fied herself by a buth according to the custom, approached her lord, the great Muni. And thereupon she conceived. And the embryo was like unto a flame of fire, possessed of great energy, and resplendent as fire itselt.

Shall I wake my husband or not ? He is exacting and punctilious in his religious duties. How can I act as not to offend him ? The alternatives are his anger and the loss of virtue of a virtuous man. The loss of virtue, I ween, is the greater of the two evils. Again, if I wake him, he will be angry.

Thy father was virtuous and high-souled, and always protected his people. O hear how that high-souled one conduct- ed himself on earth. Like unto an impersonation of virtue and justice, the monarch, cognisant of virtue, virtuously protected the four orders, each engaged in the discharge of their specified duties. Of incomparable prowess, and blessed with fortune, he protected the goddess Earth. There was none wno hated him and he himself hated none. Like unto Prajapati (Brahmana) he was equally disposed towards all creatures, O monarch, Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras, all engaged contentedly in the practice of their respective duties, were irap.rtially protected by that king.

And, O Janamejaya, thy father was dear unto Govinda ! Of great fame, he was loved by all men. And he was born in the womb of Uttara when the Kuru race was almost extinct. And, therefore, the mighty son of Abhimanyu came to be called Parikshit (born in an extinct line). Well- versed in the interpretation of treatises on the duties of kings, he was gifted with every virtue. With passions under complete control, intelligent, possessing a retentive memory, the practiser of all virtues, the conqueror of his six passions of powerful mind, surpassing all, and fully acquainted with the science of morality and political converse, thy father had ruled over these subjects for sixty years.

He made over to us all the affairs of state from the most trivial to the most important. One day, going into the forest, he pierced a deer with an arrow. And having pierced it he followed it quickly on foot into the deep woods, armed with sword and quiver- He could not, however, come upon the lost deer. Sixty years of age and decrepit, he was soon fatigued and became hungry. He then saw in the deep woods a high- souled Rishi. The Rishi was then observing the vow of silence. The king asked him about the deer, but, though asked, he made no reply. At last the king, already tired with exertion and hunger, suddenly be- came angry with that Rishi sitting motionless like a piece of wood in observance of his vow of silence. Indeed, the king knew not that he was a Muni observing the vow of silence. Swayed by anger, thy father insulted him. O excellent one of the Bharata race, the king, thy father, taking up from the ground with the end of his bow a dead snake placed it on the shoulders of that Muni of pure soul. But the Muni spake not a word good or bad and was without anger. He continued in the same posture, bearing the dead snake.* * Thus ends the forty-ninth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.

Going (every day) to his preceptor he was in the habit of worshipping him. Commanded by him, Sringin was returning home, when he heard from a friend of his about the insult of his father by thy parent. And, O tiger among kings, he heard that his father, without having committed any fault, was bearing, motionless like a statue, upon his shoulders a dead snake placed thereon.

And he was the refuge whom all creatures might seek in distress. 1 *' \"Such was the Rishi insulted by thy father 1 The son, however, of that Rishi, in wrath, cursed thy father. Though young in years, the powerful one was old in ascetic splendour. Speedily touching water, he spake, burning as it were with spiritual energy and rage, these words in allusion to thy father : 'Behold the power of my asceticism ! Directed by my words, the snake Takshaka of powerful energy and virulent poison, shall, within seven nights hence, burn, with his poison, the wretch that hath placed the dead snake upon my un-offending father* ! And having said this, he went to where his father was. And seeing his father he told him of his curse. The tiger among Rishis there- upon sent to thy father a disciple of his, named Gaurmukha, of amiable manners and possessed of every virtue. And having rested a while (after arrival at court) he told the king everything, saying in the words of his master, 'Thou hast been cursed, O king, by my son. Takshaka shall burn thee with his person ! Therefore, O king, be careful. O Janamejaya, hearing those terrible words, thy father took every pre- caution against the powerful snake Takshaka.' ' \"And when the seventh day had arrived, a Brahmana Rishi, named Kasyapa, desired to come to the monarch. But the snake Takshaka saw Kasyapa. And the prince of snakes spake unto Kasyapa without loss of time, saying, 'Where dost thou go so quickly, and what is the business on which thou goest?' Kasyapa replied, saying,'O Brahmana, I am going whither king Parikshit that best of the Kurus, is. He shall to-day be burnt by the poi>on of the snake Takshaka. I go there quickly in order to cure him, in fact, in order that, protected by me, the snake may not bite him to death !' Takshaka answered, saying, 'Why dost thou seek to revive the king to be bitten by me ? I am that Takshaka. O Brahmana, behold the wonderful power of my poison ! Thou art incapable of reviving that monarch when bit by me f_ So saying, Takshaka, then and there, bit a lord of the forest (a banian tree). And the banian, as soon as it was bit by the snake, was convert- ed into a^hes. But Kasyapa, O king, revived it. Takshaka thereupon tempted him, saying. 'Tell me thy desire.' And Kasyapa, too, thus addressed, spake again unto Takshaka, saying, 'I go there from desire of wealth/ And Takshaka, thus addressed, then spake unto the high- iculed Kasyapa in these soft, words : 'O sinless one, take from me more"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"ADI PABVA 11? wealth than what thou expectcst from that monarch, and go back thy way !'

And after that, thou wast, O tiger among men, been installed (on the throne). And, O best of monarchs, we have thus told thee all that we have seen and heard, cruel though the account is. And hearing all about the discomfiture of the monarch thy father, and of the insult to the Rishi Utanka, decidest thou that what should follow !' ' Sauti continued, \"King Janamejaya, that chastiser of enemies, then spake unto all his ministers. And he said, 'When have ye learnt all that happened upon that banian reduced to ashes by Takshaka, and which, wonderful as it is, was afterwards revived by Kasyapa ? Assuredly, my father could not have died, for the poison could have been neutrali- sed by Kasyapa with his mantras. That worst of snakes, of sinful soul, thought within his mind that if Kasyapa received the king bit by him, he, Takshaka, would be an object of ridicule in the world owing to the neutraliasation of his poison. Assuredly, having thought so, he pacified the Brahmana, I have devised a way, however, of inflicting punishment upon him. I like to know, however, ye saw or heard what happened in the deep solitude of the forest, viz., the words of Takshaka and the speeches of Kasyapa. Having known it, I shall devise the means of exterminating the snake race !' * 'The ministers said, 'Hear, O monarch of him who told us before of the meeting between that foremost Brahmanas and that prince of snakes in the woods. A certain person, O monarch, had climbed up that tree containing some dry branches with the object of breaking them for sacrificial fuel. He was not perceived either by the snake or by the Brahmana. And, O king, that man was reduced to ashes along with the tree itself. And, O king of kings, he was revived with the tree by the power of the Brahmana. That man, a Brahmana's menial, having come to us, represented fully everything as it happened between Takshaka and the Brahmana. Thus have we told thee, O king, all that we have seen and heard.

What would he nave lost if the king had revived by the grace of Kasyapa and the precautionary measures of his ministers ? From ignorance of the effects of my wrath, he prevented Kasyapa that excellent of Brahmanas whom he could not defeat, from coming to my father with the desire of reviving him. The act of aggression is great on the part of the wretch Takshaka who gave wealth unto that Brahmana in order that he might not revive the king.

And the platform was decked with much valuable articles and with Brahmanas. And it was full of precious things and paddy. And the Ritwikas sat upon it at ease, And after the sacrificial platform had been thus constructed according to rule and as desired, they installed the king at the snake-sacrifice for the attain- ment of its object. And before the commencement of the snake-sacrifice that was to come, there occurred this very important incident fore- boding obstruction to the sacrifice. For when the sacrificial platform was being constructed, a professional builder of great intelligence and well-versed in the knowledge of laying foundations, a Suta by caste, well acquainted with the Puranas, said, 'The soil upon which and the time at which the measurement for the sacrificial platform has been made, indicate that this sacrifice will not be completed, a Brahmana becoming the reason thereof.'

And he saw that the king Janamejaya was seated in the sacrificial region like the god Indra, surrounded by numerous Sadasyas, by kings of various countries whose coronal locks had under- gone the sacred bath, and by competent Ritwikas like unto Brahmana himself. And that foremost one of Bharata's race the royal sage Janamejaya, beholding the Rishi come, advanced quickly with his followers and relatives in great Joy. And the king with the approval of his Sadasyas, gave the Rishi a golden seat as Indra did to Vrihaspati. And when the Rishi, capable of granting boons and adored by the celestial Rishis themselves, had been seated, the king of kings worshipped him according to the rites of the scriptures. And the king then offered him his grandfather Krishna who fully deserved them, water to wash his feet and mouth, and the Arghya, and kine.

And the illustrious Rishi also, casting his eyes upon him and asking him about his welfare, worshipped the Sadasyas, having been before worshipped by them all.

And within a short time they became well-versed in the science of the bow. And the Kurus beholding the Pandavas gifted with physical strength, energy, and power of mind, popular also with the citizens, and blessed with good fortune, became very jealous. Then the crooked-minded Duryyodhana, and Kama, with (the former's mater- nal uncle) the son of Suvala, began to persecute them and devise means for their exile. Then the wicked Duryyodhana, guided by the counsels of Sakuni (his maternal uncle), persecuted the Pandavas in various ways for the acquirement of undisputed sovereignty. The wicked son of Dhritarashtra gave poison to Bhima, but Bhima of the stomach of the wolf digested the poison with the food. Then the wretch again tied the sleeping Bhima on the margin of the Ganges and, casting him into the water, went away. But when Bhimasena of strong arms, the son of Kunti, woke, he tore the strings with which he had been tied and came up, his pains all gone. And while asleep and in the water black snakes of virulent poison bit him in every part of his body, but that slayer of foes did not still perish.

And king Dhritarashtra, from affection for his children, and prompted by the desire of sovereignty, sent the Pandavas tactfully into Baranabat. And the Pandavas then went away with their mother from Hastinapur. And when they were leaving the city, Vidura gave them some idea of impending danger and how they could come out of it. \"The sons of Kunti reached the town of Varanavata and lived there with their mother. And, agreeably to the command of Dhritarashtra, those illustrious slayers of all enemies lived in the palace of lac, while in that town. And they lived in that place for one year, protecting themselves from Purochana very wakefully. And causing a subterranean passage to be constructed, acting according to the directions of Vidura, they set fire to that house of lac and burnt Purochana (their enemy and the spy of Duryyodhana) to death. Those slayers of all enemies, anxious with fear, then fled with their mother. In the woods beside a fountain they saw a Rakshasa. But, alarmed at the risk they ran of exposure by such an act the Pandavas fled in the darkness, out of fear from the sons of Dhrita- rashtra. It was here that Bhima gained Hidimva (the sister of the Rakshasa he slew) for a wife, and it was of her that Ghatotkacha was born. Then the Pandavas, of rigid vows, and conversant with the Vcdas wended to a town of the name of Ekachakra and dwelt there in the guise of Brahmacharins. And those bulls among men dwelt in that town in the house of a Brahmana for some time, temperance and abstinence. And it was here that Bhima of mighty arms came upon a hungry and mighty and man-eating Rakshasa of the name of Vaka. And Bhima, the son of Pandu, that tiger among men, slew him speedily with the strength of his arms and made the citizens safe and free from fear. Then they heard of Krishna (the princess of Panchala) having become disposed to select a husband from among the assembled princes. And, hearing of it, they went to Panchala, and there they obtained the maiden. And having obtained Draupadi (as their common wife) they then dwelt there for a year. And after they became known, those chastisers of all enemies went back to Hastinapura.

And accord- ingly the Pandavas went, with all their friends and followers, to Khandavaprastha taking with them many jewels and precious stones. And the sons of Pritha dwelt there for many years. And they brought, by force of arms, many a prince under their subjection. And thus, setting their hearts on virtue and firmly adhering to truth, unruffled by affluence, calm in deportment, and putting down numerous evils, the Pandavas gradually rose to power. And Bhima of great reputation subjugated the East ; the heroic Arjuna, the North : Nakula, the West : Sahadeva that slayer of all hostile heroes, the South. And having done this their dominations was spread over the whole world. And with the five Panda- vas, each like unto the Sun, the Earth looked as if she had six Suns.\" \"Then, for some reason, Yudhishthira the just, gifted with great energy and prowess, sent his brother Arjuna who was capable of drawing the bow with the left hand, dearer unto him than life itself, into the woods. And Arjuna, that tiger among men, of firm soul, and gifted with every virtue, lived in the woods for eleven years and months. And during this period, on certain occasion, Arjuna went to Krishna in Dwaravati. And Vibhatsu (Arjuna) there obtained for a wife the lotus- eyed and sweet-speeched younger sister of Vasudeva, Subhadra by name. And she became united, in gladness, with Arjuna, the son of Pandu like Sachi with the great Indra, or Sri with Krishna himself. And then, O best of monarchs, Arjuna, the son of Kunti, with Vasudeva, gratified Agni, the carrier of the sacrificial butter, in the forest of Khandava (by burning the medicinal plants in that woods to cure Agni of his indiges- tion). And to Arjuna, assisted as he was by Kesava, the task did not at all appear heavy even as nothing is heavy to Vishnu with immense design and resources in the matter of destroying his enemies. And Agni gave unto the son of Pritha the excellent bow Gandiva and a quiver that was inexhaustible, and a war chariot bearing the figure of Garuda on its standard. And it was on this occasion that Arjuna relieved the great Asura (Maya) from fear (of being consumed in the fire).

I am not satisfied with hearing in a nutshell the great history. That could never have been a trifling cause for which the virtu- ous ones could slay those whom they should not have slain, and for which they are yet applauded by men. Why also did those tigers among men, innocent and capable of avenging themselves upon their enemies, calmly suffer the presecution of the wicked Kurus ? Why also, O best of Brahmanas, did Bhima of mighty arms and of the strength of ten thou- sand elephants, control his anger, though wronged ? Why also did the chaste Krishna, the daughter of Drupada, wronged by those wretches and able to burn them, not-' burn the sons of Dhritarashtra with her wrathful eyes ? Why also did the two other sons of Pritha (Bhima and Arjuna) and the two sons of Madri (Nakula and Sahadeva), themselves injured by the wretched Kurus, follow Yudhishthira who was greatly addicted to the evil habit of gambling ? Why also did Yudhishthira, that foremost of all virtuous men, the son of Dharma himself, fully acquainted with all duties, suffer that excess of affliction ?

He that reads it to others, and they that hear it read, attain to the world of Brahman and become equal to the very goods. This Bharata is equal unto the Vcdas, is holy and excellent ; is the worthiest of all to be listened to, and is a Purana worshipped by the Risfus. It contains much useful instruction on Art.Ha and Kama (profit and pleasure). This sacred history maketh the heart desire for salvation. Learned persons by reciting this Veda of Krishna-Dwaipayana to those that are liberal, truthful and believing, earn much wealth. Sins such as killing the embryo in the womb are destroyed assuredly by this. A person, however cruel and sinful, by hering this history, escapes from all his sins like the Sun from Rahu (after the eclipse is over). This history is called Jaya. It should be heard by those desirous of victory. A king by hearing it may bring the whole world under subjection and conquer all his foes, This history in itself is a mighty act of propitiation, a mighty sacrifice productive of blessed fruit. It should always be heard by a young monarch with his queen, for then they beget a heroic son or a daughter to occupy a throne. This history is the high and sacred science of Dharma ; Artha, and also of Moksha ', it hath been so said by Vyasa himself of mind that is immeasurable. This history is recited in the present age and will be recited in the future. They that hear it read, have sons and servants always obedient to them and doing their behests.

Rising daily and purifying himself and per- forming his ascetic devotions, he composed this Mahabharata. There- fore, this should be heard by Brahmanas with the formality of a vow. He who reciteth this holy narration composed by Krishra (Vyasa) for the hearing of others, and they who hear it, in whatever state he or they may be, can never be affected by the fruit of deeds good or bad. The man desirous of acquiring virtue should hear it all. This is equivalent to all histories, and he that heareth it always attaineth to purity of heart. The gratification that one deriveth from attaining to heaven is scarcely equal to that which one deriveth from hearing this holy history. The virtuous man who with reverence hearerh it or causetb it to be heard, obtaineth the fruit of the Raj-^uva and the horse- sacrifice.

Sometime after, the king gave up the use of arms and, dwelling in a secluded retreat, practised the most severe austerities. The gods with Indra at their head once approached the monarch during this period, believing that he sought the headship of the gods by those severe austerities of his. The celestials, becoming objects of his sight, by fsoft speeches succeeded in winning him away from his ascetic austerities.\" \"The gods said, 'O lord of Earth, thou shouldst take care so that virtue may not sustain a diminution on Earth !

After the expiration of a year, the king planted it in the ground for the purpose of worshipping the giver thereof, viz., Sakia. From that time forth, O monarch, all kings, following Vasu's example, began to plant a pole for the celebration of Indra's worship. After erecting the pole they deck it with golden cloth and scents and garlands and various ornaments. And the god Vasava is worshipped in due form with such garlands and ornaments. And the god. for the gratification of the illustrious Vasu, assuming the form of a swan, came himself to accept the worship thus offered. And the god, viz., the great Indra, beholding the auspicious worship thus made by Vasu, that first of monarchs, was delighted, and said unto him, \"Those men, and kings also, who will worship me and joyously observe this festival of mine like the king of Chedi, shall have glory and victory for their countries and kingdom ! Their cities also shall expand and be ever in joy !' ' \"King Vasu was thus blessed by the gratified Maghavat, the high- souled chief of the gods. Indeed, those men who cause this festivity of Sakra to be observed with gifts of land, of gems and precious stones, become the respected of the world. And king Vasu, the lords of Chedis bestowing boons and performing great sacrifices and observing the festivity of Sakra, was much respected by Indra. And from Chedi he ruled the whole world virtuously.

But the mountain begat on the river two children that were twins. And the river, grateful to Vasu for his having set her free from Kolahala's embraces, gave them both to Vasu. And the child that was made the generalissimo to his forces by Vasu, that best of royal sages and giver of wealth and punisher of enemies. And the daughter, called Girika, was wived by Vasu. \"And Girika, the wife of Vasu, after her menstrual course, puri- fying herself by a bath, represented her state unto her lord. But that very day the Pitris of Vasu came unto that best of monarchs and fore- most of wisemen, and asked him to slay deer (for their Sradha). And the king, thinking that the command of the Pitris should not be disobeyed, went a-hunting, wishfully thinking of Girika alone who was gifted with great beauty and like unto another Sree herself. And the season being the spring, the woods within which the king was roaming, had become delightful like unto the gardens of the king of the Gandhar- vas himself. There were Asokas .and Champakas and Chutas and Atimukras in abundance : and there were Punnagas and Karnikaras and Vakulas and Divya Patalas and Patalas and Narikelas and Chanda- nas and Arjunas and similar other beautiful and sacred trees resplen- dent with fragrant flowers and sweet fruits.

Maddened by desire as he was roaming hither and thither, he saw a beautiful Asoka decked with dense foliage and its branches covered with flowers. And the king sat at his ease in the shade of that tree. And excited by the fragrance of the season and the charming odours of the flowers around, and excited also by the delicious breeze, the king could not keep his mind away from the thought of the beautiful Girika.

That fish was, sometime after, caught by the fishermen. And it was the tenth month of the fish's having swallowed the seed. From the stomach of that fish came out a male and female child of human form. The fishermen wondered much, and wending unto king Uprarichara (for they were his subjects) told him all. They said, 'O king, these two beings of human shape have been born in the body of fish !' The male child amongst the two was taken by Uparichara. That child afterwards became the virtuous and truthful monarch Matsya.' ' \"After the birth of the twins, the Apsara herself became freed from her curse. For she had been told before by the illustrious one (who had cursed her) that she would, while living in her piscatorial form, give birth to two children of human shape and then would be freed from the curse. Then, according to these words, having given birth to the two children, and been slain by the fishermen, she left her fish-form and assumed her own celestial shape. The Apsara then rose up on the path trodden by the Siddhas, the Rishis and the Charanas. \"The fish-smelling daughter of the Apsara in her piscatorial form was then given by the king unto the fisherman, saying, 'Let this one be thy daughter.

And, O protector of the Earth, owing to those already born and to those that were being born, the Earth became inca- pable of supporting herself. And amongst the sons of Diti and of Danu, casting out of heaven, some were born on Earth as kings of great pride and insolence. Possessed of great energy, they covered the Earth in various shapes. Capable of oppressing all foes, they filled the Earth having the ocean for her boundaries. And by their strength they began to oppress Brahmanas and Kshattriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras and all other creatures also.

The united strength of the creatures (such as Sesha, the Tortoise, and the huge Elephant), and of many Seshas too, became capable of supporting the Earth with her mountains, burdened as she was with the weight of the Danavas. And then, O king, the Earth, oppressed with weight and afflicted with fear, sought the protection of the Grand-sire of all creatures. And she beheld the divine Brahman the Creator of the worlds who knoweth no deterioration surrounded by the gods, Brahmanas, and great Rishis, of exceeding good fortune, and adored by delighted Gandharvas and Apsaras always engaged in the service of the celestials. And the Earth, desirous of protection, then represented everything to him, in the presence, O Bharata, of all the Regents of the worlds. But O king, the Earth's object had been known beforehand to the Omniscient, Self-create, and Supreme Lord. And, O Bharata, Creator as he is of the universe, why should he not know fully what is in the minds of his creatures including the very gods and the Asuras ? O King, the Lord of the Earth, the Creator of all creatures, also called Isa, Sambhu, Prajapati, then spake unto her.

And from the curse of Vasishtha and the command also of Indra, the eight Vasus were born of Ganga by her husband Smtanu. The youngest of them was Bhishma, the dispeller of the fears of the Kurus, gifted with great intelligence, conversant with the Vedas, the first speakers, and the thinner of the enemy's ranks. And possess- ed of mighty energy and the first of all persons acquainted with weapons, he encountered the illustrious Rama himself, the son of Jamadagni of the Bhrigu race. And, O king, that Brahman sage who, on Earth, was known by the name of Kripa and was the embodiment of all manliness was born of the tribe of the Rudras.

That son of Arishta who was known by the name of Hansa was born in the Kuru race and became the monarch of the Qandharvas. He who was known as Dhritarashtra born of the seed of Krishna-Dwaipayana, and gifted with long arms and great energy, also a monarch, of the prophetic eye, became blind in conse- quence of the fault of his mother and the wrath of the Rishi.

And having worshipped the king and asked him about his health and peace, the maiden reverentially asked, 'What must be done, O king ! I await your commands !' The king, duly worshipped by her, said unto that maiden of faultless features and sweet speech, 'I have come to worship the highly blessed Rishi Kanwa. Tell me, O amiable and beautiful one, where has the illustrious Rishi gone ?' ' \"Sakuntala then answered, 'My illustrious father hath gone away from the asylum to fetch fruit. Wait but a moment and thou wilt see him when he arrives !' ' Vaisampayana continued, \"The king not seeing the Rishi and addressed thus by her, beheld that the maiden was exceedingly beauti- ful and endued with perfect symmetry of shape. And he saw that she was of sweet smiles. And she stood decked with the beauty of her faultless features, her ascetic penances, and her humility. And he saw that she was in the bloom of youth. He therefore asked her, 'Who art thou ? And whose daughter, O beautiful one ? Why hast thou come into the woods also ? O handsome one, gifted with so much beauty and such virtues, whence hast thou come ? O charming one, at the very first glance hast thou stolen my heart ! I desire to learn all about thee ; therefore tell me all !' And thus addressed by the monarch in the asylum, the maiden smilingly replied in these sweet words : 'O Dushmanta, I am the daughter of the virtuous, wise, high-souled, and illustrious ascetic Kanwa !'

All that the illustrious one (Kanwa) told him, hear now from me, O i . ,, ,, king ! \"My father Kanwa, in answer to that Rishi s enquiries, said, 'Viswamitra, of old, having been engaged in the austerest penances alarmed Indra, the chief of the celestials, who thought that the mighty ascetic of blazing energy would, by his penances, hurl him down from high seat in the heaven- Indra, thus alarmed, summoned Menaka and told her 'Thou, O Menaka, art the first of celestial Apsaras ! There- fore, O amiable one, do me this service. Hear what I say ! This great ascetic Viswamitra like unto the Sun in splendour, is engaged in the most severe of penances ! My heart is trembling with fear. Indeed, O slender-waisted Menaka, this is thy business ! Thou must see that Viswamitra of soul rapt in contemplation and engaged in the austerest penances, who might hurl down me from my seat ! Go and tempt him, and frustrating his continued austerities accomplish my good ! Win him away from his penances, O beautiful one, by tempting him with thy beauty, youth, agreeableness, arts, smiles and speech P Hearing all this, Menaka replied, \"The illustrious Viswamitra is endued with great energy and is a mighty ascetic. He is very short-tempered too, as is known to thee, The energy, penances, and wrath of the high- souled one have made even thee anxious. Why should not I also be anxious ? He it was who made even the illustrious Vasistha b^ar the pangs of witnessing the premature death of his children. He it was who, though at first born as Kshattriya, subsequently became a Brahmana by virtue of his ascetic penances. He it was who, for pur- poses of his ablutions, created a deep river that can with difficulty be forded, and which sacred stream is known by the name of the Kausiki. It was Viswamitra whose wife, in a season of distress, was maintained by the royal sage Mantanga (Trisanku) who was then living under a father's curse as a hunter. It was Viswamitra who, on returning after the famine was over, changed the name of the stream having his asylum from Kausik into Para. It was Viswamitra who in return for the services of Mantanga, himself became the latter's priest for purposes of a sacrifice. The lord of the celestials himself went through fear to drink the Soma juice. It was Viswamitra who in anger created a second world and numerous stars beginning with Sravana.

Tell me, O Indra, the means that should be adopted so that I may not be burnt by his wrath. He can burn the three worlds by his splendour, can, by a stamp (of his foot), cause the Earth to quake. He can sever the great Meru from the Earth and hurl it to any distance. He can go round the ten points of the Earth in a moment. How can a woman like us even touch such a one full of ascetic virtues, like unto a blazing fire, and having his passions under complete control ? His mouth is like unto a blazing fire ; the pupils of his eyes are like the Sun and the Moon ; his tongue is like unto Yama himself. How shall, O chief of the celes- tials, a woman like us even touch him ? At the thought of his prowess Yama, Soma, the great Rishis, the Saddhyas, the Viswas, Valakhilyas, are terrified ! How can a woman like me gaze at him without alarm ? Commanded, however, by thee, O king of the celestials, I shall some- how approach that Rishi. But, O chief of the gods, devise thou some plan whereby protected by thee, I may safely move about that Rishi, I think that when I begin to play before the Rishi, Marut (the god of wind) had better go there and rob me of my dress, and Manmatha (the god of love) had also, at thy command, better help me then. Let also Marut on that occasion bear thither fragrance from the wooods to tempt the Rishi.

And beholding her beauty and accomplishments that bull amongst RisKis was possessed with lust and made a sign that he desired her companionship. And he invited her accordingly, and she also of faultless features expressed her acceptance of the invitation. And they then passed a long time there in each other's company. And sporting with each other, just as they pleased, for a long time as if it were only a single day, the Rishi begat on Menaka a daughter named Sakuntala. And Menaka (as her conception advanced) went to the banks of the river Malini coursing along a valley of the charming moun- tains of Himvat. And there she gave birth to that daughter. And she left the new-born infant on the bank of that river and went away. And beholding the new-born infant lying in that forest destitute of human beings but abounding with lions and tigers, a number of vul- tures sat around to protect it from harm. No Rakshasas or carnivorous animals took its life. Those vultures protected the daughter of Menaka. I went there to perform my ablution and beheld the infant lying in the solitude of the wilderness surrounded by vultures. Bring her hither I have made her my daughter. Indeed, the maker of the body, the protector of life, the giver of food, are all three, fathers in their order, according to the scriptures. And because she was surrounded in the solitude of the wilderness, by Sakuntas (birds), therefore, hath she been named by me Sakuntala (bird-protected). O Brahman, know that it is thus that Sakuntala hath become my daughter. And the faultless Sakuntala also regards me as her father I 1 ' 1 'This is what my father had said unto the Rishi, having been asked by him.

' Thus ends the seventy-second section in the Sambbava Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION LXXIII ( Sambhava Parva continued ) Vaisampayana continued, \"King Dushmanta, hearing all this, said, 'Well-spoken by thee, O princess, this is all, O blessed one, that thou hast said !

One is certainly one's own friend, and one certainly may depend upon one's own self. Therefore, according to the ordinance, thou canst certainly bestow thyself. There are, in all, eight kinds of marriage. These are Brahma, Daiva, Arsha, Prajapatya, Asura, Qandhar- va, Rakshasa, and Paisacha, the eighth. Manu, the son of the self- create, hath spoken of the appropiateness of all these forms according to their order. Know, O faultless one, that the first four of these are fit for Brahmanas, and the first six for Kshattriyas. As regards kings, even the Rakshasa form is permissible. The Asura form is permitted to Vaisyas and Sudras. Of the first five the three are proper, the other two being improper. The Pisacha and the Aswra forms should never be practised. These are the institutes of religion, and one should act according to them. The Gandharva and the RaJcshasa form are consis- tent with the practices of Kshattriyas. Thou needst not entertain the least fear. There is not the least doubt that either according to any one of these last-mentioned forms, or according to a union of both of them, our wedding may take place. O thou of the fairest complexion, full of desire as I am, thou also in a similar mood mayst become my wife according to the Gandharva form P ' \"Sakuntala, having listened to all this, answered, 'If this be the course sanctioned by religion, if, indeed, I am My own disposer, hear, O thou foremost one of Puru's race, what my terms are !

Thinking of this, he entered his capital.' \"The moment the king had left, Kanwa arrived at his abode, But Sakuntala, from a sense of shame, did not go out to receive her father. That great ascetic, however, possessed of spiritual knowledge, knew all. Indeed beholding everything with his spiritual eye, the illustrious one was pleased, and addressing her, said, 'Amaiable one, what hath been done by thee to-day in secret, without, having waited for me vfc., intercourse with a man hath not been destructive of thy virtue. Indeed, union according to the Gandharva form, of a wishful woman with a man of sensual desiret without mantras of any kind, it is said, is the best for Kshattriyas. That best of men, Dushmanta, is also high-souled and virtuous. Thou hast, O Sakuntala, accepted him for thy husband. The son that shall be born of thee shall be mighty and illustrious in this world. And he shall have sway over the sea. And the forces of that illustrious king of kings, while he goeth out against his foes, shall be irresistible !' \" \"Sakuntala then approached her fatigued father and washed his feet. And taking down the load he had with him and placing the fruits in proper order, she told him, 'It behoveth thee to give thy grace to that Dushmanta whom I have accepted for my husband, as well as his ministers !' * \"Kanwa replied, 'O thou of the fairest complexion, for thy sake I am inclined to bless him 1 But receive from me, O blessed one, the boon that thou desirest !' \" Vaisampayana continued, \"Sakuntala, thereupon, moved by desire of benefitting Dushmanta, asked the boon that the Paurava monarchs might ever be virtuous and never deprived of their thrones. 1 ' Thus ends the seventy-third section in the Sambhava Parva of the Adi Parva."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"SECTION LXXIV ( Sambhava Parva continued ) Vaisampayana said, \"After Dushraanta had left the asylum having made those promises unto Sakuntala, the latter of tapering thighs brought forth a boy of immeasurable energy.

And that first of virtuous men.Kanwa, caused all the rites of religion to be performed in respect of that intelligent child thriving day by day. And the boy gifted with pearly teeth and shining locks, capable of slaying lions even then, with all auspicious signs in his palm, and broad expansive forehead, grew up in beauty and strength. And like unto a celestial child in splendour, he began to grow up rapidly. And when he was only six years of age. endued with great strength he used to seize and bind to the trees that stood around that asylum lions and tigers and bears and buffaloes and elephants. And he rode on some animals, and pursued others in sportive mood. The dwellers at Kanwa's asylum thereupon bestowed on him a name. And they said, because he seizes and restrains all animals however strong, let him be called Sarvadamana (the subduer of all). And it was thus that the boy came to be named Sarvadamana, endued as he was with prowess, and energy and strength. And the Rishi seeing the boy and marking also his extraordinary acts, told Sakuntala that the time had come for his installation as the heir-apparent. And beholding the strength of the boy, Kanwa commanded his disciples, saying, 'Bear ye without delay this Sakuntala with her son from this abode to that of her husband, blessed with every auspicious sign. Women should not live long in the houses of their paternal or maternal relations. Such residence is destructive of their reputation, their good conduct, their virtue. Therefore, delay not in bearing her hence. 1 These disciples of the Rishi thereupon, saying 'So be it,' went towards the city named after an elephant (Hastinapura) with Sakuntala and her son ahead of them. And then she of fair eye-brows, taking with her that boy of celestial beauty, endued with eyes like lotus-petals, left the woods where she had been first known by Dushmanta. And having appro- ached the king, she with her boy resembling in splendour the rising sun was introduced to him. And the disciples of the Rishi having introduced her, returned to the asylum.

' \"The king, hearing these her words, and remembering everything, said, 'I do not remember anything. Who art thou, O wicked woman in ascetic guise ? I do not remember having any connection with thee in respect of D/iarma, Kama and Arthas. Go or stay or do as thou pleasest !' Thus addressed by him, the fair-coloured innocent one became abashed. Grief deprived her of consciousness and she stood for a time like an wooden post. Soon, however, her eyes became red like copper and her lips began to quiver. And the glances she now and then cast upon the king seemed to burn the latter. Her rising wrath, however, and the fire of her asceticism, she extinguished within herself by an extraordinary effort. Collecting her thoughts in a moment, her heart possessed with sorrow and rage, she thus addressed her lord in anger, looking at him, 'Knowing everything, O monarch, how canst thou, like an inferior person, thus say that thou knowest it not ? Thy heart is a witness to the truth or falsehood of this matter. Therefore, speak truly without degrading thyself ! He who being one thing representeth himself as another thing to others, is like a thief and a robber of his own self. Of what sin is he not capable ? Thou thinkest that thou alone hast knowledge of thy deed. But knowest thou not that the Ancient, Omniscient one (Narayana) liveth in thy heart ? He knoweth all thy sins, and thou sinnest in His presence ! He that sins thinks that none observes him. But he is observed by the gods and by Him also who is in every heart. The Sun, the Moon, the Air, the Fire, the Earth, the Sky, Water, the heart, Yama, the day, the night, both twilights, and Dharma, all witness the acts of man ! Yama, the son of Suryya, takes no account of the sins of him with whom Narayana the witness of all acts is gratified ! But he with whom Narayana is not gratified is tortured for his sins by Yama ! Him who degradeth himself by representing his self falsely, the gods never bless. Even his own soul blesseth him not. I am a wife devoted to my husband. I have come of my own accord, it is true. But do not, on that account, treat me with disrespect. I am thy wife and, therefore, deserve to be treated respectfully I Wilt thou not treat me so, because I have come hither of my own accord ? In the presence of so many, why dost thou treat me like an ordinary woman ? I am not certainly crying in the wilderness. Dost thou not hear me ?

Therefore is the wife called by those cognisant of the Vcdas as Jaya (she of whom one is born). And the son that is so born unto persons cognisant of the Vedic Mantras rescueth the spirits of deceased ancestors. And because the son rescueth ancestors from the hell call Put, therefore, hath he been called by the Self-create himself as Puttra (the rescuer from Put). By a son one conquereth the three worlds. By a son's son, one enjoyeth eternity. And by a grandson's son great-grand-fathers enjoy everlasting happiness. She is a true wife who is skilful in household affairs. She is a true wife who hath born a son. She is a true wife whose heart is devoted to her lord. She is a true wife who knoweth none but her lord. The wife is a man's half. The wife is the first of friends. The wife is the root of religion, profit, and desire. The wife is the root of salvation. They that have wives can perform religious acts. They that have wives can lead domes- tic lives. They that have wives have the means to be cheerful. They that have wives can achieve good fortune. Sweet-speeched wives are friends on occasions of joy. They are as fathers on occasions of religious acts. They are mothers in sickness and woe. Even in the deep woods to a traveller a wife is his refreshment and solace. He that hath a wife is trusted by all. A wife, therefore, is one's most valuable possession. Even when the husband leaving this world goeth into the region of Yama, it is the devoted wife that accompanies him thither. A wife going before waits for the husband. But if the husband goeth before, the chaste wife followeth close. For these reasons, O king, doth marriage exist. The husband enjoyeth the companionship of the wife both in this and in the other worlds. It hath been said by learned persons that one is himself born as one's son. Therefore, a man whose wife hath born a son should look upon her as his mother. Beholding the face of the son one hath begotten upon his wife, like his own face in a mirror, one feeleth as happy as a virtuous man, on attaining to heaven. Men scorched by mental grief, or suffering under bodily pain, feel as much refreshed in the companionship of their wives as a perspiring person in a cool bath. No man, even in anger, should ever do anything that is disagreeable to his wife, seeing that happiness, joy, and virtue, everything dependeth on the wife. A wife is the sacred field in which the husband is born himself. Even Rishis cannot create creatures without women. What happiness is greater than what the father feels when the son running to- wards him, even though his body be covered with dust, clasps his limbs ? Why then dost thou treat with indifference such a son, who hath appro- ached thee himself and who casteth wistful glances towards thee for climbing thy knees?

But seeing, thou noticest not thy own faults even though they be as large as the Vilwa fruit- Menaka is one of the celestials. Indeed, Menaka is reckoned as the first of celes- tials. My birth, therefore, O Dushmanta, is far higher than thine. Thou walkest upon the Earth, O king, but I roam in the skies ! Behold, the difference between ourselves is as that between (the mountain) Meru and a mustard seed ! Behold my power, O king ! I can repair to the abodes of Indra, Kuvera, Yama, and Varuna !

But when he sees his own ugly face in the mirror, it is then that he perceiveth the difference between himself and others. He that is really handsome never taunts anybody. And he that always talketh evil becometh a reviler. And as the swine always look for dirt and filth even when in the midst of a flower-garden, so the wicked always choose the evil out of both evil and good that others speak. Those, however, that are wise, on hearing the speeches of others that are intermixed with both good and evil, accept only what is good, like geese that always extract the milk only, though it be mixed with water. As the honest are always pained at speaking ill of others, so do the wicked always rejoice in doing the same thing.

The Pitns have said that the son continueth the race and the line and is, therefore, the best of all religious acts. Therefore, none should abandon a son. Manu hath said that there are five kinds of sons ; those begotten by one's self upon his own wife, those obtained (as gift) from others, those purchased for a consideration, those reared with affection and those begotten upon other women than upon wedded wives. Sons support the religion and achievements of men, enhance their joys, and rescue deceased ancestors from hell. It behoveth thee not, therefore, O tiger among kings, to abandon a son who is such. Therefore, O lord of Earth, cherish thy own self, truth, and virtue by cherishing thy son. O lion among monarchs, it behoveth thee not to support this deceitfulness. The dedication of a tank is more meritorious than that of a hundred wells. A sacrifice again is more meritorious than the dedication of a tank. A son is more meritorious than a sacrifice. Truth is more meri- torious than a hundred sons. A hundred horse-sacrifices had once been weighed against Truth, and Truth was found heavier than an hundred horse-sacrifices.

And he took unto him that son with joy. And the king with a joyous heart then performed all those rites upon his son that a father should perform. And the king smelt his child's head and hugged him with affection. And the Brahmanas began to utter bless- ings upon him and the bards began to applaud him. And the monarch then experienced the great delight that one feeleth at the touch of one's son. And Dushmanta also received that wife of his with affection. And he told her these words, pacifying her affectionately, 'O goddess, my union with thee took place privately. Therefore, I was thinking of how best to establish thy purity. My people might think that we were only lustfully united and not as husband and wife, and therefore, this son that I would have installed as' my heir-apparent would only have been regarded as one of impure births. And dearest, every hard word thou hast uttered in thy anger, have I, O large-eyed one, forgiven thee. Thou art my dearest !' And the royal sage Dushmanta, having spoken thus unto his dear wife, O Bharata, received her with offerings of per- fume, food, and drink. And king Dushmanta then, bestowed the name of Bharata upon his child, and formally installed him as the heir apparent. And the famous and bright wheels of Bharata's car, invincible and like unto the wheels of the cars owned by the gods, traversed every region, rilling the whole Earth with their rattle. And the son of Dushmanta reduced to subjection all kings of the Earth. And he ruled virtuously and earned great fame. And that monarch of great prowess was known by the titles of Chakiavurti and Sarvabhauma. And he performed many sacrifices like Sakra, the lord of the Maruts. And Kanwa was the chief priest at those sacrifices, in which the offerings to Brahmanas were great. And the blessed monarch performed both the cow and the horse-sacrifices. And Bharata gave unto Kanwa a thousand gold coins as the sacerdotal fee. It is that Bharata from whom have emanated so many mighty achievements. It is from him that the great race called after him in his race are called after him.

SECTION LXXV ( Sambhava Parva continued ) Vaisampayana said, \"Hear now, as I recite the recorded genealogy, that is sacred and subservient to religion, profit and pleasure, of these royal sages Daksha, the lord of creation, Manu, the son of Suryya, Bharata, Kuru; Puru ; and Ajmida. I shall also recite to thee, O sinless one, the genealogies of the Yadavas and of the Kurus and of the kings of the Bharata line. These genealogies are sacred and their recitation is a great act of propitiation. That recitation confereth wealth, fame and long lite. And, O sinless one, all these I have named shone in their splendour and were equal unto the great Rishis in energy.\" \"Prachetas had ten sons who were all devoted to asceticism and posse- ssed of every virtue. They burnt, of old, by the fire emanating from their mouths, several plants of poisonous and innumerable large trees that had covered the Earth and became a source of great discomfort to man. After these ten, was born another named Daksha. It is from Daksha that all creatures have sprung. Therefore is he, O tiger among men, called the Grand-father. Born of Prachetas the Muni Daksha, uniting himself with Virini, begat a thousand sons of rigid vows, all like himself. And Narada taught these thousand sons of Daksha the excellent philosophy of Sankhya as a means of salvation. [There, therefore, to- tally abstaineth from begetting creatures.] And, O Janamejaya, the lord of creation, Daksha, then, from the desire of making creatures, begat fifty daughters. And he made all of them his appointed daughters (so that their sons might be his sons also for the performance of all religious acts). And he bestowed ten of his daughters on Dharma, and thirteen on Kasyapa. And he gave twenty-seven to Chandra, who are all engaged in indicating time. And Kasyapa, the son of Marichi, begat on the eldest of his thirteen wives, the Adityas, the celestials endued with great energy and having Indra as their head, and also Vivaswat (the Sun). And of Vivaswat was barn the lord Yama. And Martanda (Vivaswat) also begat another son after Yama, gifted with great intelligence and named Manu.

And Manu begat ten other children named Vena, Dhrishnu, Narishyan, Nabhaga, Ikshakus, Karusha, Saryati, the eighth, a daughter named Ila, Prishadhru the ninth, and Nabhagarishta, the tenth. They all betook themselves to the practices of Kshattriyas. Besides these, Manu had fifty other sons on Earth. But we heard that they all perished, quarrelling with one another. The learned Pururavas was born of Ila. It bath been heard by us that Ila was both his mother and father. And the great Pururavas had sway over thirteen islands of the sea. And, though a human being, he was always surrounded by companions that were superhuman. And Puru- ravas intoxicated with power quarrelled with the Brahmanas and little caring for their anger robbed them of their wealth. Beholding all this Sanatkumara came from the region of Brahman and gave him good counsel, which was, however, rejected by Pururavas. Then the wrath of the great Rishis was excited, and the avaricious monarch, who intoxi- cated with power had lost his reason, was immediately destroyed by their curse.\" \"It was Pururavas who first brought from the region of the Gandharvas the three kinds of fire (for sacrificial purpose). And he brought thence, the Apsara Urvasi also. And the son of Ila begat upon Urvasi six sons who were called Ayus, Dhimat, Amavasu, and Dhridhayus, and Vanayus, and Satayus. And it is said that Ayus begat four sons, named Nahusha, Vriddhasarman, Rajingaya, and Anenas, on the daughter of Swarbhanu. And, O monarch, Nahusha, of all the sons of Ayus, being gifted with great intelligence and prowess ruled his extensive kingdom virtuously. And king Nahusha supported evenly the Pitris, the celestials, the Rishis, the Brahmanas, the Qand/iarvas, the Nagas, the Rakshasas, the Kshattri- yas, and the Vaisyas. And he suppressed all robber-gangs with a mighty hand. But he mace the Rishis pay tribute and carry him on their backs like beasts of burden. And, conquering the very gods by the beauty of his person, his asceticism, prowess, and energy, he ruled as if he were Indra himself. And Nahusha begat six sons, all of sweet speech, named Yati, Yayati, Sanyati, Ayati, and Dhruva. Yati betaking himself to asceticism became a Muni like unto Brahman himself.

And, O king, having virtuously ruled his subjects for a long time, Yayati was attacked with a hideous decrepi- tude destroying his personal beauty. And attacked by decrepitude, the monarch then spoke, O Bharata, unto his sons Yadu and Puru and Tur- vashu and Drahyu and Anu these words : -'Ye dear sons, I wish to be a young man and to gratify my appetites in the company of young women. Do you help me therein !' To him his eldest son born of Devayani then said 'What needest thou, O king ? Dost thou want to have your youth ?' Yayati then told him, 'Accept thou my decrepitude, O son ! With thy youth I would enjoy myself. During the time of a great sacrifice I have been cursed by the Muni Usanes (Sukra). O son, I would enjoy myself with your youth. Take any of you this my decrepitude and with my body rule ye my kingdom! I would enjoy myself with a renovated body. Therefore, ye my sons, take ye my decrepitude. But none of his sons cook his decrepitude. Then his youngest son Puru said unto him, 'O king, enjoy thou once again with a renovated body and returned youth! I shall take thy decrepitude and at thy command rule thy kingdom. Thus addressed, the royal sage, by virtue of his ascetic power then transferred his own decrepitude unto that high-souled son of his and with the youth of Puru becime a youth ; while with the monarch's age Puru ruled his kingdom.\" \"Then, after a thousand years had passed away, Yayati, that tiger among kings, remained as strong and powerful as a tiger. And he enjoy- ed for a long time the companionship of his two wives. And in the gardens of Chitraratha (the king of Qandharvas), the king also enjoyed the company of the Apsara Viswachi. But even after all this, the great king found his appetites unsatiated. The king, then recollected the following truths contained in the Puranas. 'Truly, one's appetities are never satiated by enjoyment. On the other hand, like sacrificial butter poured into the fire, they flame up with indulgence, Even if one enjoy- ed the whole Earth with its wealth, diamonds and gold, animals and women, one may not yet be satiated. It is only when man doth not com- mit any sin in respect of any living thing, in thought, deed, or speech, it is then that he attaineth to purity as that of Brahman. When one feareth nothing, when one is not feared by anything, when one wisheth for nothing, when one injureth nothing, it is then that one attaineth to the purity of Brahman !'

In the world shall my race be known by thy name !' Vaisampayana continued, \"Then that tiger among kings, having installed his son Puru on the throne, went away to the mount of Bhrigu for devoting himself to asceticism.

He left his human body by observing the vow of fasting, and ascended to heaven with his wives.\" Thus ends the seventy-fifth section in the Sambhava Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION LXXVI ( Sambhava Parva continued ) Janamejaya said, \"O thou of the wealth of asceticism, tell me how our ancestor Yayati, who is the tenth from Prajapati, obtained for a wife the unobtainable daughter of Sukra.

And between those two Brahmanas there are always much boastful rivalry. Tnose Danavas assembled for encounter that were slain by the gods were all revived by the seer Sukra by the power of his knowledge. And then starting again, into life, these fought with the gods. The Asuras also slew on the field of battle many of the celestials. But the open-minded Vrihaspati could not revive them, because he knew not the science called Sanjivani (re-vivification) which Kavya endued with great energy knew so well.

' Vaisampayana continued, \"Kacha commanded by Kavya or Usanas himself, called also Sukra, then said, 'So be it,* and took the vow he had spoken of. And, O Bharata, accepting the vow of which he had spoken, at the proper timei Kacha began to conciliate regardfully both his preceptor and (his daughter) Devayani. Indeed, he began to con- ciliate both. And as he was young, by singing and dancing and playing on different kinds of instruments, he soon gratified Devayani who was herself in her youth. And, O Bharata, with his whole heart set upon it, he soon gratified the maiden Devayani who was then a young lady, by presents of flowers and fruits and services rendered with alacrity. And Devayani also with her songs and sweetness of manners used, while they were alone, to attend upon that youth carrying out his vow. And when five hundred years had thus passed of Kacha's vow, the Danavas came to learn his intention. And having no compunctions about slay- ing a Brahmana, they became very angry with him.

Then having recourse to the science of reviving the dead, Sukra summoned Kacha. And summoned by his preceptor, Kacha appeared before him in the gladness of heart tearing by virtue of his preceptor's science the bodies of the wolve (that had devoured him). And asked about the cause of his delay, he thus spoke unto Bhargava's daughter. Indeed, asked by that Brahman's daughter, he told her, 'I was dead. O thou of pure manners, burdened with sacrificial fuel, Kusa grass, and logs of wood, I was coming towards our abode. I set under a banian tree. The kine also, having been brought together, were stay- ing under the shade of that same banian tree. The Asuras, beholding me, asked, 'Who art thou T They heard me answer, I am the son of Vrihaspati' As soon as I said this, the Danavas slew me, and hack- ing my body into pieces gave my remains to jackals and wolves.

And as he was roving about for gathering flowers, the Danavas beheld him. They again slew him, and pounding him into a paste they mixed it with the water of the ocean. Finding him long still (in coming), the maiden again represented the matter unto her father. And summoned again by the Brahmana with the aid of his science, Kacha appearing before his preceptor and his daughter told everything as it had happened. Then slaying him for the third time and burning him and reducing him to ashes, the Aswras gave those ashes to the preceptor himself, mixing them with his wine.

Boys and girls, unable to distinguish between right and wrong, quarrel with each other. The wise never imitate them.'

I shall with thy youth enjoy the pleasures of life for a thousand years.' To this Anu replied, 'Those that are decrepit always eat like children and are always impure. They cannot pour liba- tions upon fire in proper times. Therefore, I do not like to take thy decrepitude.' Yayati told him, 'Thou art sprung from my heart, thou givest not thy youth. Thou findest so many faults in decrepitude. Therefore, decrepitude shall overcome thee 1 And, O Anu, thy progeny also, as soon as they attain to youth, shall die ! And thou shalt also not be able to perform sacrifices before fire !' \"Yayati at last turned to his youngest child, Puru, and addressing him said, 'Thou art, O Puru, my youngest son ! But thou shalt be the first of all ! Decrepitude, wrinkles, and whiteness of hair have come over me in consequence of the curse of Kavya called also Usanas. I have not yet however, been satiated with my youth. O Puru, take thou this my weakness and decrepitude ! With thy youth I shall enjoy for some years the pleasures of life- And when a thousand years have passed away, I shall give back to thee thy youth and take back my own decrepitude !' Vaisampayana said, \"Thus addressed by the king, Puru answered with humility, 'I shall do, O monarch, as thou bidest me ! I shall take, O king, thy weakness and decrepitude ! Take thou my youth and enjoy as thou listest the pleasures of life ! Covered with thy decrepitude and becoming old, I shall, as thou commandest, continue to live, giving thee my youth !' Yayati then said, 'O Puru, I have been gratified with thee ! And being gratified, I tell thee that the people in thy kingdom shall have all their desires fulfilled !' \"And having said this, the great ascetic Yayati, then thinking of Kavya, trasferred his decrepitude unto the body of the high-souled Puru.\" Thus ends eighty-fourth section in the Sambhava Parva of the Adi Parva."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"SECTION LXXXV (Sambhava Parva continued) Vaisampayana said, 'The excellent monarch Yayati, the son of Nahusha, having received Puru's youth became exceedingly gratiBed. And with it he once more began to indulge in his favourite pursuits to the full extent of his desires and to the limit of his powers, according to season, so as to derive the greatest pleasure therefrom. And O king, in nothing that he did, he acted against the precepts of his religion as be- hoved him well. He gratified the gods by his sacrifices ; the pitris, by Sraddhas ; the poor, by his charities ; all excellent Brahmanas, by fulfill- ing their desires ; all persons entitled to the rites of hospitality, with food and drink ; the Vaisyas, by protection ; and the Sudras, by kindness. And the king repressed all criminals by proper punishments, And Yayati, gratifying all sections of his subjects, protected them virtuously like another Indra* And the monarch possessed of the prowess of a lion, with youth and every object of enjoyment under control, enjoyed un- limited happiness without trantgressing the precepts of religion. And the king became very happy in thus being able to enjoy all the excellent objects of his desires. And he was only sorry when he thought that those thousand years would come to an end. And having obtained youth for a thousand years, the king acquainted with the mysteries of time, and watching proper Kalas and Kashtas sported with (the celestial damsel) Viswachi, sometimes in the beautiful garden of Indra, sometimes in Alaka (the city of Kuvera), and sometimes on the summit of the moun- tain Meru on the north. And when the virtuous monarch saw that the thousand years were full, he summoned his son, Puru, and addressed him thus : 'O oppressor of foes, with thy youth, O son, I have enjoyed the pleasures of life, each according to its season, to the full extent of my desires, to the limit of my powers ! Our desires, however, are never gratified by indulgence. On the other hand, with indulgence, they only flame up like fire with libations of sacrificial butter ! If a single person were owner of everything on Earth all her yields of paddy and barley, her silver, gold, and gems, her animals and women, he would not still be content !

Thou art, indeed, that son of mine who has done me the greatest services.' ' Vaisampayana continued. \"Then Yayati, the son of Nahusha, received back his decrepitude. And his son Puru received back his own youth. And Yayati was desirous of installing Puru, his youngest son, on the throne. But the four orders, with the Brahmans at their head, then addressed the monarch thus : 'O king, how shalt thou bestow thy king- dom on Puru, passing over thy eldest son Yadu born of Devayani, and, therefore, the grandson of the great Sukra ? Indeed, Yadu is thy eldest son ; after him hath been born Turvasu ; and of Sarmishtha's sons, the first is Drahyu, then Anu and then Puru. How doth the youngest deserve the throne, passing all his 'elder brothers over ? This we repre- sent to thee ! O, conform to virtuous practice ?' \"Yayati then said, 'Ye four orders with Brahmanas at their head, hear my words as to why my kingdom should not be given to my eldest son ! My commands have been disobeyed by my eldest son, Yadu. The wise say that he is no son who disobeyeth his father- That son, however, who doth the bidding of his parents, who seeketh their good, who is agreeable to them, is. indeed, the best of sons. I have been disregarded by Yadu and by Turvasu, too- Much I have been disregarded by Drahya and by Anu also. By Puru alone hath my word been obeyed. By him have I been much regarded. Therefore, the youngest shall be my heir. He took my decrepitude. Indeed, Puru is my friend ! He did what was so agreeable to me. It hath also been commanded by Sukra himself, the son of Kavi, that, that son of mine who should obey me will become king after me and bring the whole Earth tinder his sway I I, therefore, beseech ye, let Puru be installed on throne !' ''The people then said, 'True it is, O king, that, that son who is accomplished and who seeketh the good of his parents, deserveth pros- perity even if he be the youngest ! Therefore, doth Puru, who hath done the good, deserve the crown. And as Sukra himself hath commanded it, we have nothing to say to it !' ' Vaisampayana continued, \"The son of Nahusha, thus addressed by the contented people, then installed his son, Puru, on the throne.

And having lived for some time into forest in the company of Brahmanas, observing many rigid vows, eating fruits and roots, patiently bearing privations of all sorts, the monarch at last ascended to heaven. And having ascended to heaven he lived there in bliss. But soon, however, he was hurled down by Indra. And it hath been heard by me, O king, that, though hurled from heaven, Yayati, without reaching the surface of the Earth, stayed in the firmament. I have heard that sometime after he again entered the region of the celestials in company with Vasuman, Ashtaka, Pratard- dana, and Sivi.\" Janamejaya said \"I desire to hear from thee in detail why Yayati, having first obtained admission into heaven, was hurled therefrom, and why also he gained re-admittance.

And he passed another year practising the severest austerites in the midst of four fires around and the Sun overhead. And, living upon air alone, he stood erect upon one leg for six months. And the king of sacred deeds ascended to heaven, covering heaven as well as the Earth (with the fame of his achieve- ments).\" So ends the eighty-sixth section in the Sambhava Parva of the Adi Parva.

And it hath been heard by me that he dwelt for long time in heaven. \"One day that best of kings, Yayati, went to Indra and there in course of conversation the lord of Earth was asked by Indra as follows : 'What didst thou say, O king, when thy son Puru took thy decrepi- tude on Earth and when thou gavest him thy kingdom ?' \"Yayati answered, 'I told him that the whole country between the rivers Ganga and Yamuna was his. That is, indeed, the central region of the Earth, while the out-lying regions are to be the dominions of thy brothers.

Indra then said O monarch, because thou disregardest those that are thy superiors, thy equals, and even thy inferiors, without, in fact, knowing their real merits, thy virtues have suffered diminution and thou must fall from heaven !' Yayati then said, 'O Sakra, if, indeed, my virtues have really sustained diminution and I must on that account fall down from heaven.

None should exult in having acquired great wealth. None should be vain of having studied the entire Vedas. In the world men are of different dispositions. Destity is supreme. Both power and exertion are all fruitless. Knowing Destiny to ba all powerful, the wise, whatever their portions may be, should nether exult nor grieve. When creatures know that their weal and woe are dependent on Destiny and not on their own exertion or power, they should neither grieve nor exult, remembering that Destiny is all-powerful. The wise should ever live contented, neither grieving at woe nor exulting at weal. When Destiny is supreme, both grief and exultattion are unbecoming. O Ashtaka, I never suffer myself to be be overcome by fear, nor do I ever entertain grief, knowing for certain that I shall be in the world what the great disposer of all hath ordained. Insects and worms, all oviparous crea- tures, vegetable existences, all crawling animals, vermin, the fish in water, stones, grass, wood in fact, all created things, when they are freed from the effects of their acts, are united with the Supreme Soul. Happiness and misery are both transient. Therefore, O Ashtaka, why should I grieve ? We can never know how we are to act in order to avoid misery.

The latter said, 'O king of kings, tell me, in detail, of all those regions that thou hast visited and enjoyed, as wall as the periods for which thou hast enjoyed each.

There are asce- ticism, benevolence, tranquillity of mind, self-command, modesty, simplicity, and kindness to all creatures. The wise also say that a person loseth all these in consequence of vanity. That man who having acquired knowledge regardeth himself as learned, and with his learning destroyeth the reputation of other, never attaineth to regions of indes- tructible felicity. That knowledge also doth not make its possessor competent to attain to Brahma. Study, taciturnity, worship before fire, and sacrifices, these four remove all fear. When, however, these are mixed with vanity, instead of removing it, they cause fear. The wise should never exult at (receiving) honours nor should they grieve at insults. For it is the wise alone that honour the wise; the wicked never act like the virtuous. I have given away so much I have performed so many sacrifices, I have studied so much, I have observed these vows, such vanity is the root of fear.

While dwelling in the abode of his preceptor, he must receive lessons only when his preceptor summons him to do so ; he must attend to the service of his preceptor without waiting for the latter's command ; he must rise from his bed before his preceptor riseth, and go to bed after his preceptor hath gone to bed. He must be humble, must have his passions under complete control, must be patient, vigilant, and devoted to studies. It is then only that he can achieve success. It hath been said in the oldest Upanishada that a grihastha, acquiring wealth by honest means, should perform sacrifices ; he should always give something in charity, should perform the rites of hospitality unto all arriving at his abode, and should never use any thing without giving a portion thereof to others. A Muni, without search for woods, depending on his own vigour ; should abstain from all vicious acts ; should give away some- thing in charity, should never inflict pain on any creature- It is then only that he can achieve success. He, indeed, is a true Bhikshu who doth not support himself by any manual arts, who possesseth numerous accomhlishments, who hath his passions under complete control, who is unconnected with worldly concerns, who sleepeth not under the shelter of a house-holder's roof, who is without wife, and who going a little way every day, travelleth over a large extent of the country. A learned man should adopt the Vanaprastha mode of life after performance of the necessary rites, when he hath been able to control his appetites for enjoyment and desire of acquiring valuable possessions. When one dieth in the woods while leading the Vanaprastha mode of life, he maketh his ancestors and the successors, numbering ten generations including him- self, mix with the Divine essence.' \"Ashtaka asked, \"How many kinds of Mums are there, and how many kinds of Munis (observers of the vow of silence ) ?'

Therefore, there is nothing to impede his salvation. He, however, who faileth to attain to Knowledge, should yet devote himself to piety as dependent on action (sacrifices, &c). But he that devoteth himself to such peity, moved thereto by desire of salvation, can never achieve success. His sacrifices bear no fruit and partake of the nature of cruelty. Piety which is dependent on action that proceedeth not from the desire of fruit, is, in case of such men Yoga itself ?' \"Ashtaka said, 4 O king, thou lookest like a youth ; thou art hand- some and decked with a celestial garland.

Amongst them, Pravira was the perpetrator of the dynasty. Pravira had by his wife Suraseni a son named Manashyu. And the latter of eyes like lotus-petals had his sway over the whole Earth bounded by the four seas- And Manashyu had for his wife Sauviri. And he begat upon her three sons called Sakta, Sahana, and Vagmi. And they were heroes in battle and mighty car-warriors. The intelligent and virtuous Kaudraswa begat upon the Af?sara Misrakesi ten sons who were all great bow-men. And they all grew up into heroes, performing numerous sacrifices in honour of the gods. And they all had sons, were learned in all branches of knowledge and ever devoted to virtue, They are Richeyu, and Kaksbeyu and Vrikeyu of great prowess ; Sthandileyu, and Vaneyu, and Jaleyu of great fame, Tejeyu of great strength and intelligence, and Satye^u of the prowess of Indra, Dharmeyu, and Sannateyu the tenth of the prowess of the celestials. Amongst them all, Richeyu became the sole monarch of the whole Earth and was known by the name of Anadhrishti. And in prowess he was like unto Vasava amongst the celestials. And Anadhristhi had a son of the name of Matinara who became a famous and virtuous king and performed the Rajasuya and the horse-sacrifice. And Matinara had four sons of immeasurable prowess, viz. Tansu, Mahat, Atiratha, and Drahyu of immeasurable glory. Amongst them, Tansu of great prowess became the prepetrator of Puru's line. And he subjugated the whole Earth and acquired great fame and splendour. And Tansu begat a son of great prowess named Ilina.

And Ilina begat upon his wife Rathantarya five sons with Dushmanta at their head all equal in might unto the five elements. They were Dushmanta, Sura, Bhima, Pravashu, and Vasu. And, O Janamejaya, the eldest of them, Dushmanta, became king. And Dushmanta had by his wife Sakuntala an intelligent son named Bharata who became king.

And Bhumanya begat upon his wife, Pushkarini six sons named Suhotra, Suhotri, Suhavi, Suyaju. and Diviratha. The eldest of them all, Suhotra, obtained the throne and performed many Rajasuyas and horse-sacrifice. And Suhotra brought under his sway the whole Earth surrounded by her belt of seas and full of elephants, kine and horses, and all her wealth of gems of gold. And the Earth afflicted with the weight of numberless human being and elephants, horses, and cars, was, as it were, about to sink. And during the virtuous reign of Suhotra the surface of the whole Earth was dotted all over with hundreds and thousands, of sacrificial stakes, And the lord of Earth, Suhotra, begat upon his wife Aikshaki three sons, viz., Ajamina, Sumida, and Purumida. The eldest of them, Ajamida, was the perpetrator of the royal line. And he begat six sons, Riksha was born of the womb of Dhumini, Dusmanta and Parameshthin, of Nili, and Jahnyu, Jala, and Rupina, were born in that of Keshini. All the tribes of the Panchalas are descended from Dushmanta and Parameshthin. And the Kushikas are the sons of Jahnyu of immeasur- able prowess. And Riksha who was older than both Jala and Rupina became king. And Riksha begat Samvarana the prepetuator of the royal line. And, O king, it hath been heard by us that while Samva- rana, the son of Riksha, was ruling the Earth, there happened a great loss of people from famine, pestilence, drought, and disease. And the Bharata princes were beaten by the troops of enemies. And the Panchalas setting out to invade the whole Earth with their four kinds of troops soon brought the whole Earth under their sway. And with their ten Akshauhinis the king of the Panchalas defeated the Bharata prince. Samvarana then with his wife and ministers, sons and relatives, fled in fear, and took shelter in the forest on the banks of the Sindhu extending to the foot of the mountains- There the Bharatas lived for a full thousand years, within their fort. And after they had lived there a thousand years, one day the illustrious Rishi Vasishtha approached the exiled Bharatas, who, on going out, saluted the Rishi and worshipped him by the offer of Arghya.

And the king retook the capital that had been taken away from him and once more made all monarchs pay tribute to him The powerful Samvarana, thus installed once more in the actual sovereignty of the whole Earth, performed many sacrifices at which the presents to the Brahmanas were great. \"Samvarana begat upon his wife, Tapati, the daughter of Suryya, a son named Kuru, This Kuru was exceedingly virtuous, therefore, he was installed on the throne by his people. It is after his name that the field called Kuru-jangala has become so famous in the world. Devoted to asceticism, he made that field (Kuru-kshettra) sacred by practising asceticism there. And it has been heard by us that Kuru's highly intelli- gent wife, Vahini, brought forth five sons viz., Avikshit, Abishyat, Chastraratha, Muni, and the celebrated Janamejaya. And Avikshit begat Parikshit the powerful, Savolaswa, Adiraja, Viraja, Balmali of great physical strength Uchaisravas, Bhangakara and Jitari the eighth. In the race of these were born, as the fruit of their pious acts seven mighty car-warriors with Janamejaya at their head.

And they were all proficient in morality and profit and were kind to all creatures. Among them Dhritarashtra became king. And Dhritarashtra had eight sons viz.., Kundika, Hasti, Vitarka, Kratha the fifth, Havitsravas, Indrabha, and Bhumanyu the invincible, and Dhritarashtra had many grandsons, of whom three only were famous. They were, O king, Pratipa, Dharmanetra, Sunetra. Among these last three, Pratipa became unrivalled on Earth. And, O bull in Bharata's race, Pratipa begat three sons viz..

And the lord of Earth, Santanu, became exceedingly gratified with her conduct, beauty, magnanimity, and attention to his comforts. And the goddess Ganga also, of three courses (celestial, terrestrial, and subterranean) assuming a human form of superior complexion and endued with celestial beauty, lived happily as the wife of Santanu, having as the fruit of her virtuous acts, obtained for her husband, that tiger among kings equal unto Indra himself in splendour. And she gratified the king by her attractiveness and affection, by her wiles and love, by her music and dance, and became herself gratified. And the monarch was so enraptured with his beautiful wife that months, seasons, and years rolled on without his being conscious of them. And the king, while thus enjoying himself with his wife, had eight children born unto him who in beauty were like the very celestial themselves. But, O Bharata, those children, one after another, as soon as they were born, were thrown into the rivet by Ganga who said, 'This is for thy good.' And the children sank to rise no more.

He had his asylum on the breast of the king of mountains called Meru. The spot was sacred and abounded with birds and beasts. And there bloomed at all times of the year flowers of every season. And O best of Bharata's race, that foremost of virtuous men, the son of Varuna, practised his ascetic penances in those woods abounding with sweet roots and water. \"Daksha had a daughter known by the name of Surabhi, who, O bull of Bharata's race, for benefiting the world, brought forth, by her connection with Kasyapa, a daughter (Nandini) in the form of a cow. That foremost of all kine, Nandini, was the cow of plenty (capable of granting every desire). The virtuous son of Varuna obtained Nandini for his Homa rites. And Nandini, dwelling in that hermitage which was adored by Munis, roamed about fearlessly in those sacred and delightful woods. \"One day, O bull of Bharata's race, there -came into those woods adored by the gods and celestial Rishis, the Vasus with Prithu at their head. And wandering there with their wives, they enjoyed themselves in those delightful woods and mountains. And as they wandered there, the slender-waisted wife of one of the Vasus, O thou of the prowess of Indra, saw in those woods Nandini, the cow of plenty.

On hearing these words of his wife, Dyau, moved by the desire of humouring her, stole that cow, aided by his brothers Prithu and the others. Indeed, Dyau, commanded by his lotus-eyed wife, did her bidding, forgetting at the moment the high ascetic merits of the RisHi who owned her. He did not think at the time that he was going to fall by committing the sin of stealing the cow. \"When the son of Varuna returned to his asylum in the evening with fruits he had collected, he beheld not the cow with her calf there. He began to search them in the woods, but when the great ascetic of superior intelligence found not his cow on search, he saw by his ascetic vision that she had been stolen by the Vasus. His wrath was instantly kindled and he cursed the Vasus, saying 'Because the Vasus-have stolen my cow of sweet milk and handsome tail, therefore, shall they certainly be born on Earth f \"O thou bull of Bharata's race, the illustrious Rishi Apava thuscursed the Vasus in wrath. And having cursed them the illustious one set his heart once more on ascetic meditation.

And addressing the Rishi, O bull among kings, they endea- voured to pacify him. But they failed, O tiger among men, to obtain grace from Apava that Rishi conversant with all rules of virtue.

All the kings of the Earth, beholding him devoted to virtue, bestowed upon that foremost of virtuous men the title of King of kings. And all the kings of the Earth during the time of that lord-protector of the Bharata race, were without woe and fear and anxiety of any kind. And they all slept in peace, rising from bed every morning after happy dreams. And owing to that monarch of splendid achieve- ments resembling Indra himself in energy, all the kings of the Earth became virtuous and devoted to .liberality, religious acts and sacri6ces. And when the Earth was ruled by Santanu and other monarchs like him, the religious merits of every order increased very greatly. The Kshattriyas served the Brahmans.; the Vaisyas waited upon the Kshattriyas, and the Sudras adoring the Brahmanas and the Kshattriyas, waited upon the Vaisyas. And Samanu residing in Hastinapura, the delightful capital of the Kurus, ruled the whole Earth bounded by seas. He was truthful and guileless, and like the king of the celestials himself conversant with the dictates of virtue. And from the combina- tion in him of liberality, religion and asceticism, he acquired a great good fortune. He was free from anger and malice, and was handsome in person like Soma himself. In splendour he was like the Sun and in impetuosity of valour like Vayu. In wrath he was like Yama, and in patience like the Earth. And, O king, while Santanu ruled the Earth, no deer, boars, birds, or other animals were needlessly slain. In his dominions the great virtue of kindness to all creatures prevailed, and the king himself, with the soul of mercy, and void of desire and wrath, extended equal protection unto all creatures. Then sacri- fices in honour of the gods, the Rishis, and Pitris commenced, and no creature was deprived of life sinfully. And Santanu was the king and father of all of those that were miserable and those that had no protectors, of birds and beasts, in fact, of every created thing, And during the rule of the best of Kurus of that king of kings speech became united with truth, and the minds of men were directed towards liberality and virtue. And Santanu, having enjoyed domestic felicity for six and thirty years, retired into the woods. \"And Santanu's son, the Vasu born of Ganga, named Devavrata resembled Santanu himself in personal beauty, in habits and behaviour, and in learning. And in all branches of knowledge worldly or spiritual his skill was very great. His strength and energy were extraordinary. He became a mighty car-warrior. In fact he was a great king. One day, while pursuing along the banks of the Ganges a deer that he had struck with his arrow, king Santanu observed that the river had become shallow. On observing this, that hull among men, viz.,"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"ADI PABVA Santanu, began to reflect upon this strange phenomenon. He mentally asked why that first of rivers ran out so quickly as before. And while seeking for a cause, the illustrious monarch beheld that a youth of great comeliness, well-built and amiable person, like Indra himself, had, by his keen celestial weapons, checked the flow of the river. And the king, beholding this extraordinary feat of the river Ganga having been checked in her course near where that youth stood, became very much surprised. This youth was no other than Santanu's son him- self. But: as Santanu had seen his son only once a few moments after his birth, he had not sufficient recollection to identify that infant with the youth before his eyes. The youth, however, seeing his father, knew him at once, but instead of disclosing himself, he clouded the king's perception by his celestial powers of illusion and disappeared in his very sight. \"King Santanu, wondering much at what he saw and imagin- ing the youth to be his own son, then addressed Ganga and said, Show me that child. 1 Ganga thus addressed, assuming a beautiful form, and holding the boy decked with ornaments in her right arm, showed him to Santanu. And Santanu did not recognise that beautiful female bedecked with ornaments and attired in fine robes of white, although he had known her before. And Ganga said 'O tiger among men, that eighth son whom thou hadst sometime before begot upon me is this 1 Know that this excellent child is conversant with all weapons. O monarch, take him now. I have reared him with care. And go home, O tiger among men, taking him with thee ! Endued with superior intelligence, he has studied with Vasishtha the entire Vedas with their branches. Skilled in all weapons and a mighty bowman, he is like Indra in battle. And, O Bharata, both the gods and the Asuras look upon him with favour. Whatever branches of know- ledge are known to Usanas, this one knoweth completely. And so is he the master of all those Sastras that the son of Angiras (Vrihaspati) adored by the gods and the Asuras knoweth. And all the weapons known to the powerful and invincible Rama, the son of Jamodagni are known to this thy illustrious son of mighty arms ! O king of superior courage, take this thy own heroic child given unto thee by me 1 He is mighty bowman and conversant with the interpretation of all treatises on the duties of a king !' Thus commanded by Ganga, Santanu took his child resembling the Sun himself in glory and returned to his capital. And having reached his city that was like unto the celestial capital, that monarch of Puru's line regarded himself greatly fortunate. And having summoned all the Pauravas together, for the protection of his king- dom he installed his son as his heir-apparent and associated on the"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"240 MAHABHARATA throne. And O bull of Bharata's race, the prince soon gratified by his behaviour of his father and the other members of the Paurava race : in fact, all the subjects of the kingdom. And the king of incomparable prowess lived happily with that son of his. \"Four years had thus passed away, when the king one day went into the woods on the bank of the Yamuna, And while the king was rambling there, he perceived a sweet scent coming from an unknown direction. And the monarch, impelled by the desire of ascertaining the cause, wandered hither and thither. And in course of his ramble, he beheld a black-eyed maiden of celestial beauty, the daughter of a fisher mm. The king addressing her, said, 'Who art thou, and whose daughter ? What dost thou do here. O timid one ?' She answered, 'Blest be thou ! I am the daughter of the chief of the fisherman. At his command, I am engaged for religious merit, in rowing passengers across this river in my boat.' And Santanu, beholding that maiden of celestial form endued with beauty, amiable- ness, and such fragrance, desired her for his wife. And repairing unto her father, the king solicited his consent to the proposed match. But the chief of the fishermen replied to the monarch, saying *O king, as soon as my daughter of superior complextion was born, it was, of course, understood that she should be bestowed upon a husband. But listen to the desire I have cherished all along in my heart. O sinless one, thou art truthful : if thou desirest to obtain this maiden as a gift from me, give me then this pledge. If, indeed, thou givest the pledge, I will of course bestow my daughter upon thee for truly I can never obtain a husband for her equal to thee !\" \"Santanu, hearing this, replied, 'When I have heard of the pledge thou askest, I shall then say whether I would be able to grant it. If it is capable of being granted, I shall certainly grant it. Otherwise how shall I grant it. The fisherman said, 'O king, what I ask of thee is this : the son born of this maiden shall be installed by thee on thy throne and none else shalt thou make thy successor !' Vaisampayana continued, \"O Bharata, when Santanu herd this, he felt no inclination to grant such a boon, though the fire of desire sorely burnt him within. The king with his- heart afflicted by desire returned to Hastinapura, thinking all the way of the fisherman's daughter. And having returned home, the monarch passed his time in sorrowful medi- tation. One day, Devavrata approaching his afflicted father said, 'All is prosperity with thee ; all chiefs obey thee ; then how is it that thou grievest thus ?

Thus addressed by his son, Santanu answered, 'Thou sayest truly, O son, that I have become melancholy. I will also tell thee why I am so. O thou of Bharata's line, thou art the only scion of this our large race. Thou art always engaged in sports of arms and achieve- ments of prowess ! But, O son, I am always thinking of the instability of human life ! If any danger overtake thee, O child of Ganga, the result is that we become sonless ! Truly thou alone art to me as a century of sons ! I do not, therefore, desire to wed again. I only desire and pray that properity may ever attend on thee so that our dynasty may be perpetuated. The wise say that he that hath one son hath no son. Sacrifices before fire and the knowledge of the three Vedas yield, it is true, everlasting religious merit, but all these, in point of religious merit, do not come up to a sixteenth part of the religious merit attain- able on the birth of a son ! Indeed, in this respect, there is hardly any difference between men and the lower animals. O wise one, I do not entertain a shadow of doubt that one attains to heaven in consequence of his having begotten a son. The Vedas which constitute the root of the Puranas and are regarded as authoritative even by the gods, contain numerous proof of this. O thou of Bharata's race, thou art a hero of excitable temper, who is always engaged in the exercise of arms. It is very probable that thou wilt be slain on the field of battle. If it so happen i what then will be the state of the Bharata dynasty ! It is this thought that hath made me so melancholy 1 I have now told thee fully the causes of my sorrow.' Vaisampayana continued, * Devavrata who was endued with great intelligence, having ascertained all this from the king, reflected within himself for a while. He then went to the old minister devoted to his father's welfare and asked him about the cause of the king's grief. O bull of Bharata's race, when the prince questioned the minister, the latter told him about the boon that was demanded by the chief of the fishermen in respcet of his daughter Gandhavati. Then Devavrata, accompanied by many Kshatriya chiefs of venerable age, personally repaired to the chief of the fishermen and begged of him his daughter on behalf of the king, The chief of the fishermen received him with due adorations, and O thou of Bharata's race, when the prince took his seat in the court of the chief, the latter addressed him and said, 'O bull among the Bharatas, thou art the first of all wielders of weapons and the only son of Santanu.

And after Santanu had ascended to heaven, Bhishma, placing himself under the command of Satyavati, installed that suppressor of foes, viz., Chitrangada on the throne, who, having soon vanquished by his prowess all monarchs, considered not any man as his equal. And beholding that he could vanquish men, Asuras, and the very gods, his namesake, the powerful king of the Gandharvas approached him for an encounter.

At this time he heard that the three daughters of the king of Kasi, all equal in beauty to the Apsaras themselves, would be married on the same occa- sion, selecting their husbands at a self-choise ceremony. Then that foremost of car-warriors, that vanquisher of all foes, at the command of his mother, went to the city of Varanasi in a single chariot. There Bhishma, the son of Santanu, saw that innumerable monarchs had come from all directions ; and there he also saw those three maiden that would select their own husbands. And when the (assembled) kings were each being mentioned by name, Bhishma chose those maidens (on behalf of his brother). And taking them upon his chariot, Bhishma, that first of smiters in battle, addressed the kings, O monarch, and said in a voice deep as the roar of the clouds, 'The wise have directed that when an accomplished person has been invited, a maiden may be bestowed on him, decked with ornaments and along with many valuable presents. Others again may bestow their daughters by accepting a couple of kine. Some again bestow their daughters by taking a fixed sum, and some take away maidens by force.

But the sages have said that, that wife is dearly to be prized who is taken away by force, after the slaughter of opponents, from amidst the concurse of princes and kings invited to a self-choise ceremony, Therefore, Ye monarchs, I bear away these maidens hence by force ! Strive Ye, to the best of your might, to vanquish me or to be vanquished ! Ye monarchs, I stand here resolved to fight ! The Kuru prince, endued with great energy, thus addressing the assembled monarchs and the king of Kasi, took upon his car those maidens. And having taken them up, he sped his chariot away, challenging the invited kings to a fight. \"The challenged monarchs then all stood up, slapping their arms and biting their nether lips in wrath. And loud was the din produced, as, in a great hurry, they began to cast off their ornaments and put on their armour. And the motion of their ornaments and armour, O Janamejaya, brilliant as these were, resembled meteoric flashes in the sky. And with brows contracted and eyes red with rage, the monarchs moved in impa- tience, their armour and ornaments dazling or waving with their agitated steps. The charioteers soon brought handsome cars with fine horses harnessed thereto. Those splendid warriors then, equipped with all kinds of weapons, rode on those cars, and with uplifted weapons pursued the retreating chief of the Kurus. Then, O Bharata, occured the terrible encounter between those innumerable monarchs on one side and the Kuru warrior alone on the other. And the assembled monarchs threw at their foe ten thousand arrows at the same time, Bhishma, however, speedily checked those numberless arrows before they could come at him by means of a shower of his own arrows as innumerable as the down on the body- Then'those kings surrounded him from all sides and rained arrows on him like masses of clouds showering on the mountain-breast. But Bhishma, arresting with his shafts the course of that arrowy down- pour, pierced each of the monarchs with three shafts. The latter, on the other hand, pierced Bhishma, each with five shafts. But, O king, Bhishma checked those by his prowess and pierced each of the contending kings with two shafts. The combat became so fierce with that dense showers of arrows and other missiles that it looked very like the encounter between the celestials and the Asuras of old, and men of courage who took no part in it were struck with fear to even look at the scene. Bhishma cut off with his arrows, on the field of battle, bows, and flag- staffs, and coats of mail, and human heads by hundreds and thousands.

Then that foremost of all wielders of weapons having vanquished in battle all those monarchs, pursued his way towards the capital of the Bharatas, taking those maidens with him. \"It was then, O king, that mighty car-warrior, king Salya of immea- surable prowess, from behind summoned Bhishma, the son of Santanu to an encounter. And desirous of obtaining the maidens, he came upon Bhishma like a mighty leader of a herd of elephants rushing upon another of his kind, and tearing with his tusks the letter's hips at the sight of a female elephant in heat. And Salya of mighty arms, moved by wrath addressed Bhishma and said, 'Stay. Stay.' Then Bhishma, that tiger among men, that grinder of hostile armies, provoked by these words, flamed up in wrath like a blazing fire. Bow in hand, and brow furrowed into wrinkles, he stayed on his car, in obedience to Kshatriya usage having checked its course in expectation of the enemy. All the manarchs seeing him stop, stood there to become spectators of the coming encounter between him and Salya. The two then began to exhibit their prowess, (upon each other) like roaring bulls of great strength at the sight of a cow in rut. Then that foremost of men, king Salya, covered Bhishma, the son of Santanu with hundreds and thousands of swift-winged shafts. And those monarchs seeing Salya thus covering Bhishma at the outset with innumerable shafts, wondered much and uttered shouts of applause. Beholding his lightness of hand in combat, the crowd of regal spectators became very glad and applauded Salya greatly. That subjuga- tor of hostile towns, Bhishma then, on hearing those shouts of the Kshatriyas, became very angry and said, 'Stay, Stay'. In wrath, he commanded his charioteer, saying, Lead thou my car to where Salya is so that I may slay him instantly as Garuda slays a serpent.' Then the Kuru chief fixed the Varuna weapon on his bow-string, and with it afflicted the four steeds of king Salya. And, O tiger among kings, the Kuru chief then, warding off with his weapons those of his foe, slew Salya's charioteer. Then that first of men, Bhishma, the son of Santanu, fighting for the sake of those damsels, slew with the Aindra weapon the noble steeds of his adversary. He then vanquished that best of monarchs but left him with his life. O bull of Bharata's race, Salya, after his defeat, returned to his kingdom and continued to rule it virtuously. And O conqueror of hostile towns, the other kings also, who had come to witness self-choice ceremony returned to their own kingdoms. \"That foremost of smiters, viz., Bhishma, after defeating those monarchs, set out with those damsels, for Hastinapura whence the virtu- ous Kuru prince Vichitravirya ruled the Earth like that best of monarchs,"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"ADI PABVA 247 viz., his father Santanu.

Of immeasurable prowess in battle, the son of the ocean- going Ganga, having slain numberless foes in battle without a scratch on his own person, brought the daughters of the king of Kasi unto the Kurus as tenderly if they were his daughtors-in-law, or younger sisters, or daughters. And Bhishma of mighty arms, impelled by the desire of benefitting his brother, having by his prowess brought them thus, then offered those maidens possessing every accomplishment unto Vichitra- virya. Conversant with the dictates of virtue, the son of Santanu, having achieved such an extraordinary feat according to (kingly) custom, then began to make preparations for his brother's wedding. And when everything about the wedding had been settled by Bhishma in consultation with Satyavati, the eldest daughter of the king of Kasi, with a soft smile, told him these words : 'At heart I had chosen the king of Saubha for my husband. He had, in his heart, accepted me for his wife. This was also approved by my father. At the self-choice ceremony also I would have chosen him as my lord. Thou art conver- sant with all the dictates of virtue, knowing all this, do as thou likest.' Thus addressed by that maiden in the presence of the Brahmanas, the heroic Bhishma began to reflect as to what should be done. As he was conversant with the rules of virtue, he consulted with the Brahmanas who had mastered the Vedas t and permitted Amva, the eldest daughter of the ruler of Kasi to do as she liked- But he bestowed with due rites the two other daughters, Amvika and Amvalika on his younger brother Vichitravirya.

And turning her eyes to religion, and to the paternal and maternal lines (of the Kurus), she addressed Bhishma and said, The funeral cake, the achievements, and the perpetuation of the line of the virtuous and celebrated Santanu of Kuru's race, all now depend on thee !

One day Utathya's younger brother Vrihaspati, the priest of the celestial, who endued with great energy, approached Mamata. The latter, however, told her husband's younger brother that foremost of eloquent men that she had conceived from her connection with his elder brother and that, therefore, he should not then seek for the consummation of his wishes. She continued, O illustrious Vrihaspati, the child that I have conceived hath studied in his mother's womb the Vedas with the six Angas, Semen tuum fvustra perdi non potest. How can then this womb of mine afford room for two children at a time ? Therefore, it behoveth thee not to seek for the consummation of thy desire at such a time ! Thus addressed by her, Vrihaspati, though possessed of great wisdom, succeeded not in suppressing his desire. Quum auten jam cum ilia coiturus esset, the child in the womb then addressed him and said, O father, cease from thy attempt ! There is no space here for two. O illustrious one, the room is small. I have occupied it first. Semen tuum ptrdi non potest. It behoveth thee not to afflict me ! But Vrihaspati without listening to what that child in the womb said, sought the embraces of Mamata possessing the most beautiful pair of eyes. Ills, tamen Muni, qui in venture erat punctum tempovis quo humor vitalis jam emissum iret providens, viam per quam semen intrare posset pedibus obstruxit. Semen ita exhisum, excidit et in terram projectumest. And the illustrious Vrihaspati, beholding this, became indignant, and reproached Utathya's child and cursed him, saying because thou hast spoken to me in the way thou hast at a time of pleasure that is sought after by all creatures, perpetual darkness shall overtake thee ! And from this curse of the illustrious Vrihaspati Utathya's child who was equal unto Vrihaspati in energy, was born blind and came to be called Dirghatamas (enveloped in perpetual darkness). And the wise Dirghatamas, possessed of a knowledge of the Vedas, though born blind, succeeded yet, by virtue of his learning, in obtaining for a wife a young and handsome Brahmin maiden of the name of Pradweshi, And having married her, the illustrious Dirghatamas, for the expansion"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"ADI PABVA 361 of Utathya's race, begat upon her several children with Gautama as their eldest.

Then those best of Munis that dwelt in the same asylum, beholding him transgress the limits of propriety became indignant, seeing sin where sin was not. And they said O, this man, transgressth the limit of propriety. No longer doth he deserve a place amongst us ! Therefore, shall we all cast this sinful wretch off !

His wife replied (by saying), I desire not wealth that may be procured by thee, for that can never bring me happiness! O best of Brhmanas, do as thou likest !

Thereupon king Vali sent his wife Sudeshna unto him. But the queen knowing that the latter was blind and old went not unto him, she sent unto him her nurse. And upon that Sudra woman the virtuous Rishi of passions under full control begat eleven children of whom Kakshivat was the eldest.

But the terror of the Rishi's curse at last prevailed. And having obtained from him a precious boon, I could not refuse his solicitations.

Satyavati,, beholding him seated at his ease, after the usual inquiries, addressed him and said, 'O learned one, sons derive their birth both from the father and the mother. They are, therefore the ^ common property of both parents. There cannot be the least doubt about it that the mother, hath as much power over them as the father. As thou art, indeed, my eldest son according to the ordinance, O Brahmarshi, so is Vichitravirya my youngest son. And as Bhishma is Vichitravirya's brother on the father's side, so art thou his brother on the same mother's side. I do not know what you may think, but this is what, O son, I think. This Bhishma, the son of Satitanu, devoted to truth, doth not, for the sake of truth, entertain the desire of either begetting children or ruling the kingdom- Therefore, from affection for thy brother Vichitravirya, for the perpe- tuation of our dynasty, for the sake of this Bhishma's request and my command, for kindness to all creatures, for the protection of the people and from the liberality of thy heart, O sinless one, it behoveth thee to do what I say ! Thy younger brother hath left two widows like unto the daughters of the celestials themselves, endued with youth and great beauty. For the sake of virtue and religion, they have become desirous of offspring. Thou art the fittest person to be appointed. Therfore beget upon them children worthy of our race and for the continuance of our line !' \"Vyasa, hearing this, said, O Satyavati, thou knowest what virtue is both in respect of this life and the other. O th )u of great wisdom, and thy affections also are set on virtue. Therefore, at thy command, making virtue my motive, I shall do what thou desirest. Indeed, this"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"ADI PABVA 265 practice that is conformable to the true and eternal religion is known to me, I shall give unto my brother children that shall be like unto Tama and Varuna. Let the ladies then duly observe for one full year the vow I indicate. They shall then be purified. No women shall ever approach me without having observed a rigid vow !' \"Satyavati then said, 'O sinless one, it must not be as thou sayest. On the other hand, take such steps that the ladies may conceive immediately. In a kingdom where there is no king, the people perish from want of protection ; sacrifices and other holy acts are suspended ; the clouds send no showers ; and the gods disappear. How can, O lord a kingdom be protected that hath no king ? Therefore, see thou that the ladies conceive. Bhishma will watch over the children as long as they are in their mother's wombs ! 'Vyasa replied, 'If I am to give unto my brother children so unsea- sonably, then let the ladies bear my ugliness. That in itself shall, in their case, be the austerest of penances. If the princess of Kosaia can bear my strong odour, my ugly and grim visage, my attire and body, she shall then conceive an excellent child ? Vaisampayana continued, \"Having spoken thus unto Satyavati, Vyasa of great energy again addressed her and said, 'Let the princess of Kosaia clad in clean attire and decked with ornaments wait for me in her bed-chamber. Saying this, the Rishi disappeared. Satyavati then went to her daughter-in-law and seeing her in private spoke to her these words of beneficial and virtuous import. 1 O princess of Kosaia, listen to what I say. It is consistent with virtue. The dynasty of the Bharatas hath became extinct from my misfortune. Beholding my affliction and the extinction of his paternal line, the wise Bhishma, impelled also by the desire of perpetuating our race, hath made me a suggestion, which suggestion, however, for its accomplishment is dependent on thee ! Accomplish it, O daughter, and restore the lost line of the Bharatas ! O thou of fair hips, bring thou forth a child equal in splendour unto the chief of the celestials ! He shall bear the onerous burden of this our hereditary kingdom !' 'Satyavati having succeeded with great difficulty in procuring the assent of her virtuous daughter-in-law to her proposal which was not inconsistent with virtue, then fed Brahmanas and Rishis and numberless guests who arrived on the occasion.\" Thus ends the hundred and fifth section in the Sambhava Parva of the Adi Parva,"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"SECTION CVI (Sambhava Parva continued) Vaisampayana said, \"Soon after the monthly season of the princess of Kosala had been over, Satyavati, purifying her daughter-in-law with a bath, led her into sleeping apartment, There seating her upon a luxurious bed, she addressed her, saying, O Princess of Kosala, thy husband hath an elder brother who shall this day enter thy womb as thy child. Wait for him to-night without dropping off to sleep. Hear- ing these words of her mother-in-law, the amiable princess, as she lay on her bed, began to think of Bhishma and the other elders of the Kuru race. Then the Rishi of truthful speech, who had given his promise in respect of Amvika (the eldest of the princesses) in the first instance, entered her chamber while the lamp was burning. The princess, seeing his dark visage, his matted locks of copper hue, blazing eyes, his grim beard, closed her eyes in fear. The Rishi, from desire of accomplishing his mother's wishes, however knew her. But the latter, struck with fear, opened not her eyes even once to look at him. And when Vyasa came out, he was met by his mother, who asked him, 'Shall the princess have an accomplished son ?' Hearing her, he replied, The son of the princess she will bring forth shall be equal in might unto ten thousand elephants. He will be an illustrious royal sage, possessed of great learning and intelligence and energy. The high-souled one shall have in a time a century of sons- But from the fault of his mother he shall be blind.' At these words of her son, Satyavati said. 'O thou of ascetic wealth, how can one that is Tslind become a monarch worthy of the Kurus ? How can one that is blind became the protector of his relatives and family, and the glory of his father's race ? It behoveth thee to give another king unto the Kurus !' Saying 'So be it,' Vysa went away. And the first princess of Kosala In due time brought forth a blind son. \"Soon after Satyavati, O chastiser of foes, summoned Vyasa, after having secured the assent of her daughter-in-law. Vyasa came accord- ing to his promise, and approached, as before, the second wife of his brother. And Ambalika beholding the Rishi, became pale with fear. And, O Bharata, beholding her so afflicted and pale with fear, Vyasa addressed her and said, 'Because thou hast been pale with fear at the sight of my grim visage, therefore, thy child shall be pale in complexion, O thou of handsome face, the name also thy child shall be Pandu (the pale) !

Satyavati again begged of the Rishi another child, and the Rishi told her in reply, 'So be it.' Amvalika then when her time came, brought forth a son of pale complexion. Blazing with beauty the child was endued with all auspicious marks. Indeedi it was this child who after- wards became the father of those mighty bowmen, the Pandavas. 'Sometime after, when the eldest of Vichitravirya's widow again had her monthly season, she was solicited by Satyavati to approach Vyasa once more. Possessed of beauty like a daughter of the celestials, the princess refused to do her mother-in-law's bidding, remembering the grim visage and strong odour of the Rishi. She, however, sent unto him, a maid of hers, endued with the beauty of an Apsara and decked with her own ornaments. And when the Vyasa arrived, the maid rose up and saluted him. And she waited upon him respectfully and took her seat near him when asked. And O king, the great Rishi of rigid vows was well-pleased with her, and when he rose to go away, he addressed her and said, 'Amiable one, thou shalt no longer be a slave. Thy child also shall be greatly fortunate and virtuous, and the foremost of all intelligent men on Earth !' And, O king, the son thus begotten upon her by Krishna-Dwaipayana was afterwards known by the name of Vidura. He, was thus the brother of Dhritarashtra and the illustrious Pandu. And Vidura was free from desire and passion and was conversant with the rules of government, and was the god of justice born on Earth under the curse of the illustrious Rishi Mandavya. And Krishna-Dwaipayana, when he met his mother as before, informed her as to how he had been deceived by the eldest of the princesses and how he had begotten a son upon a Sudra woman. And having spoken thus unto his mother the Rishi disappeared from her sight. \"Thus were born, in the field of Vichitravirya, even of Dwaipayana those son of the splendour of celestial children, those propagators of the Kuru race. 11 Thus ends the hundred and sixth section in the Sambhava Parva of the Adi Parva.

He was conversant with all duties and was devoted to religion, truth and asceticism. The great ascetic used to sit at the en- trance of his asylum at the foot of a tree, with his arms upraised in the observance of the vow of silence. And as he sat there for years and years together, one day there came into his asylum a number of robbers laden with spoil. And, O bull in Bharata's race, those robbers were then being pursued by a superior body as guardians of the peace. The thieves, on entering that asylum, hid their booty there, and in fear concealed themselves thereabout before the guards came. But scarcely had they thus concealed themselves when the constables in pursuit came to the spot. The latter, observing the Rishi sitting under the tree, questioned him, O king, saying, O best of Brahmanas which way have the thieves taken ? Point it out to us so that we may follow it without loss of time. 1 Thus questioned by the guardians of peace the ascetic, O king said not a word, good or otherwise, in reply. The officers of the king, however, on searching that asylum soon discovered the thieves concealed thereabout together with the plunder. Upon this, their suspicion fell upon the Muni, and accordingly they seized him with the thieves and brought him before the king. The king sentenced him to be executed along with his supposed associates. And the officers, acting in ignorance, carried out the sentence by impaling the celebrated Rishi. And having impaled him, they went to the king with the booty they have recovered. But the virtuous Rishi, though impaled and kept without food, remained in that state for a long time without dying. And the Rishi by the ascetic power not only preserved his life but summoned other Rishi to the scene. And they came there in the night in the forms of birds, and beholding him engaged in ascetic meditation though fixed on that stake became plunged into grief.

Thus addressed by the king, the Muni, was pacified. And beholding him free from wrath, the king took him up with the stake endeavoured to extract it from his body. But not succeeding therein, he cut it off at the point just outside the body. The Muni, with a portion of the stake within his body, walked about, and in that state practised the austerest of penances and conquered numberless regions unattainable by others. And for the circumstances of a part of the stake being within his body, he came to be known in the three worlds by the name of Am- Mandavya (Mandavya with the stake within). And one day that Brahmana acquainted with the highest truth of religion went unto the abode of the god of justice. And beholding the god there seated on his throne, the Rishi reproached him and said, 'What, pray, is that sinful act committed by me unconsciously, for which I am bearing this punish- ment ? O, tell me soon, and behold the power of my asceticism ! \"The god of justice, thus questioned, replied, O thou of ascetic wealth, a little insect was once pierced by thee on a blade of grass. Thou bearest now the consequence of the act. O Rishi, as a gift, however small multiplieth in respect of its religious merits, so a sinful act multi- plieth in respect of the woe it bringeth in its train !' On hearing this, Ani-Mandavya asked, O tell me truly when this act was committed by me ! Told in reply by the god of justice that he had committed it, when a child, the Rism said, that shall not be a sin which may be done by a child up to the twelfth year of his age from birth. The scriptures shall not recognise it as sinful. The punishment thou hast inflicted on me for such a venial offence hath been disproportionate in severity. The killing of a Brahmana involves a sin that is heavier than the killing of any other living being. Thou shalt, therefore, O god of justice, have to be born among men even in the Sudra order ! And from this day I establish this limit in respect of the consequence of acts that an act shall not be sinful when committed by one below the age of fourteen. But when committed by one above that age, it shall be regarded as sin.

The Earth began to yield abundant harvest, and the crops also were of good flavour. And the clouds began to pour rain in season and trees became full of fruits and flowers. And the draught cattle were all happy and the birds and other animals rejoiced exceedingly. And the flowers became fragrant and the fruits became sweet ; the cities and towns became filled with merchants, artisians, traders and artists of every description. And the people became brave, learned, honest and happy. And there were no robbers then, nor anybody who was sinful. And it seemed that the golden age had come upon every part of the kingdom. And the people devoted to virtuous acts, sacrifices and truth, and regarding one another with love and affection grew in prosperity. And free from pirde, wrath and covetousness, they rejoiced in perfectly innocent sparts. And the capital of the Kurus, full as the ocean, was a second Amaravati, teeming with hundreds of palaces and mansions, and possessing gates and arches dark as the clouds, And men in great cheerfulness sported constantly on rivers, lakes and tanks, and in fine groves and charming woods. And the southern Kurus, in their virtuous rivalry with their northern kinsmen, walked about in the company of Siddhas and Charanas and Bithis. And all over that delightful country whose prosperity was thus increased by the Kurus, there were no misers and no widowed women. And the wells and lakes were ever full ; the groves abounded with trees, and the houses and abodes of Brahmanas were full of wealth and the whole kingdom was full of festivities. And O king, virtuously ruled by Bhishma, the kingdom was adorned with hundreds of sacrificial stakes. And the wheel of virtue having been set in motion of Bhishma, and the country became so contented that the subjects of other kingdoms,. quitting their homes, came to dwell there and increase its population.

And they became well-skilled in the practice of bow, in horsemanship, in encounters with mace, sword and shield, in the management of elephants in battle, and in the science of morality. Well-read in history and the history and the Puranas and various branches of learning, and acquainted with the truths of the Vedaa and their branches they acquired knowledge, which was varsatile and deep. And Pandu, possessed of great prowess, excelled all men in the science of bow, while Dhritarashtra excelled all men in the science of bow while Dhritarashtra excelled all in personal strength ; while in three worlds there was no one equal to Vidura in his devotion to virtue and in the knowledge of the dictates of morality. And beholding the restoration of the extinct line of Santanu, the saying became current in all countries that among mothers of heroes, the daughters of th king of Kasi were the first ; that among countries Kurujangala was the first : that among virtuous men, Vidura was the first ; that among cities Hastinapura was the first. Pandu became king, for Dhritarashtra, owing to the blindness, and Vidura, for his birth by a Sudra woman, did not obtain the kingdom.

And Pandu, that oppressor of foes, like unto a mighty fire whose far-reaching flames were represented by his arrows and splendour by his weapons, began to consume all kings that came in contact with him. These with their forces, vanquished by Pandu at the head of his army, were made the vassals of the Kurus. And all kings of the world, thus vanquished by him, regarded him as the one hero only on Earth even as 'the celestials regard Indra in heaven. And the kings of Earth with joined palms bowed to him and waited on him with presents of various kinds of gems and wealth, pre- cious stones and pearl and corals, and much gold and silver, and first- class kine and handsome horses and fine cars and elephants, and asses and camels and buffaloes, and goats and sheep, and blankets and beautiful hides, and carpets made-of the skin of the Banku deer. And the king of Hastinapura accepting those offerings retracted his steps towards his capital, to the great delight of his subjects. And the citizens and others filled with joy, and kings and ministers, all began to say, 'O, the fame of the achievements of Santanu, that tiger among kings, and of the wise Bharata, which were about to die, hath been revived by Pandu ! They who robbed before the Kurus of both terri- tory and wealth, have been subjugated by Pandu the tiger of Hastinapura and made to pay tribute !' And all the citizens with Bhishma at their head went out to receive the victorious king. They did not proceed far when \" they saw the attendants of king laden with much wealth, and the train of various conveyances laden with all kinds of wealth, and of elephants, horses, cars, kine, camels and other animals, was so long that they saw not its end. Then Pandu beholding] Bhishma, who was a father to him, worshipped his feet and saluted the citizens and others as each deserved. And Bhishma, too, embracing Pandu as his son who had returned victorious after grinding many hostile kingdoms, wept tears or joy.

And he sent portion his wealth to Vidura also. And the virtuous Pandu gratified his other relatives also with similar presents. Then Satyabati and Bhishma and the Kosala princess were all gratified with the presents Pandu made out of the aquisitions of his prowess.

Gratified with Gandhari's hospitality, the Rishi gave her the boon she asked viz., that she should have a century of sons each equal unto her lord in strength and accomplishments. Some time after Gandhari conceived and she bore the burden in her womb for two long years without being delivered. And she was greatly afflict- ed at this. It was th'en that she heard that Kunti had brought forth a son whose splendour was like unto the morning son. Impatient of the period of gestation which had prolonged so long, her own case, and deprived of reason by grief, she struck her womb with great violence without the knowledge of her husband. And thereupon came out of her womb, after two years' growth, a hard mass of flesh like unto an iron ball. When she was about to throw it away, Dwaipayana, learning every- thing by his spritual powers, promptly came there, and that first of ascetics beholding that ball of flesh, addressed the daughter of Suvala thus, 'What has thou done ?'

Let a hundred pots full of clarified butter be brought instantly, and let them be placed at a concealed spot. In the meantime, let cool water be sprinkled over this ball of flesh'. Vaisampayana continued \"That ball of flesh then, sprinkled over with water, became, in time, divided into a hundred and one parts, each about the size of the thumb. These were then put into those pots full of clarified butter that had been placed at a concealed spot and were watched with care. The illustrious Vyasa then said unto the daughter of Suvala that she should open the covers of the pots after full two years. And having said this and made these arrangements, the wise Dwaipayana went to the Himavat mountains for devoting himself to asceticism. \"Then in time, king Duryyodhana was born from among those pieces of the ball of flesh that had been deposited in those pots. According to the order of birth, king Yudishthira was the eldest. The news of Duryyodhana' s birth was carried to Bhishma and the wise Vidura. The day that the haughty Duryyodhana was born was also the birth-day of Bhima of mighty arms and great prowess. \"As soon as Duryyodhana was born, he began to cry and bray like an ass. And hearing that sound, the asses, vultures, jackals and crows uttered their respective cries responsively. Violent winds began to blow, and there were fires in various directions.

When Vidura and those Brahmanas had stated so, King Dhritarashtra out of affection for his son had not the heart to follow that advice. Then, O king, within a montht were born a full hundred sons unto Dhritarashtra and a daughter also in excess of this hundred. And during the time when Gandhari was in. a state of advanced pregnancy, there was a maidservant of the Vaisya class who used to attend on Dhritarashtra. During that year, O king, was begotten upon her by the illustrious Dhritarahhtra a son endued with great intelligence who was afterwards named Yuyutsu. And because he was begotten by Kshatriya upon a Vaisya woman, he came to be called Kama- \"Thus were born unto the wise Dhritarashtra a hundred sons who were all heroes and mighty chariot-fighters, and a daughter over and above the hundred, and another son Yuyutsu of great energy and pro- wess begotten upon a Vaisya woman.

Thou hast merely said that over and above the hundred sons, there was another son named Yuyutsu begotten upon a Vaisya woman, and a daughter. The great Rishi Vyasa of immeasurable energy said unto the daughter of the king of Gandhara that she would become the mother of a hundred sons. Illustrious one, how is that thou sayest Gandhari had a daughter over and above her hundred sons ?

All this while that illustrious and best of Rishis, Krishna-Dwaipayana himself was dividing the ball of flesh ; and counting a full hundred of the parts, he said unto the daughter of Suvala, Here are thy hundred sons.

Pierced by Pandu, while engaged in the act of inter- course, he fell down to the ground, uttering cries that were of a man and began to weep bitterly. The deer then addressed Pandu and said, \"O king, even men that are slaves to lust and wrath, and void of reason, and ever sinful, never commit such a cruel act as this ! Individual judgement prevaileth not against the ordinance, the ordinance prevaileth against individual judgement. The wise never sanction anything discountenanced by the ordinance. Thou art born, O Bharata, in a race that hath ever been virtuous. How, is it, therefore that even thou, suffering thyself to be overpowered by passion and wrath losest thy reason ? Hearing this, Pandu replied, O deer, kings behave in the matter of slaying animals of thy spieces exactly as they do in the matter of slaying foes. It behoveth thee not, therefore, to reprove me thus from ignorance. Animals of thy spieces are slain by open or covert means. This, indeed, is the practice of kings. Then why dost thou reprove me ? Formerly, the Rishi Agastya, while engaged in the performance of a grand sacrifice, chased the deer, and devoted every deer in the forest unto the gods in general.

And there- upon Vyushitaswa began to shine above all men like the Sun appearing in double splendour after the season of frost is over. And the powerful Vyushitaswa, who was endued with the strength of ten elephants very soon performed the horse-sacrifice, overthrowing, O best of monarchs, all the kings of the East, the North, the West and the South, and exacted tributes from them all. There is a proverb, O best of the Kurus, that is sung by all reciters of the Puranae, in connection with that first of all men, the illustrious Vyushitaswa. Having conquered the whole Earth up to the shores of the sea, Vyushitaswa protected every class of his subjects as a father does his own begotten sons, Performing many great sacrifices he gave away much wealth to the Brahmanas. After collecting unlimited jewels and precious stones he made arrangements for performing still greater ones.. And he performed also the Agniahtoma, and other special Vedic sacrifices, extracting great quantities of Soma juice. And, O king, Vyushitaswa had for his dear wife, Vadra, the daughter of Kakshivat, unrivalled for beauty on Earth. And it hath been heard by us that the couple loved each other deeply. King Vyushitaswa was seldom separated from his wife. Sexual excess, however, brought on an attack of phthisis and the king died within a few daySi sinking like the Sun in his glory. Then Vadra, his beautiful queen, was plunged into woe, and as she was sonless, O tiger among men, she wept in great affliction. Listen to me, O king, as I narrate to you all that Vadra said with bitter tears trickling down her cheeks O virtuous one, she said, women serve no purpose when their husbands are dead I She who, liveth, after her husband is dead, drageth on a miserable existence that can hardly be called life !

They used to go about freely, enjoying themselves as best as they liked.

That practice, sanc- tioned by precedent, is applauded by great Riahis. O thou of taper thighs, the practice is yet regarded with respect amongst the Northern Kurus. Indeed, that usage, so lenient to women hath the sanction of antiquity. The present practice, however ( of women's being confined to one husband for life) hath been established but lately. I shall tell thee in detail who established it and why. \"It hath been heard by us that there was a great Rifhi of the name of Uddalaka, who had a son named Swetaketu who also was an ascetic of merit. O thou of eyes like lotus-petals, the present vituous prac- tice hath been established by that Swetaketu from anger. Hear thou the reason. One day, in the presence of Swetaketu' s father a Brahmana came and catching Swetaketu's mother by the hand, told her, .Let us go Beholding his mother seized by the hand and taken away apparently by force, the son was greatly moved by wrath. Seeing his son indignant, Uddalaka addressed him and said, Be not angry O son ! This is the practice sanctioned by antiquity. The women of all orders in this world are free, O son, men in this matter, as regards their respective orders, act askine The Rithi's son Swetaketu, however, disapproved of the usage and established in the world the present practice as regards men and women. It hath been heard by us, O thou of great virtue, that the existing practice dates from that period among human beings but not among beings of other classes. Accord- ingly, since the establishment of the present usage, it is sinful for women not to adhere to their husbands. Women transgressing the limits assigned by the Rithi became guilty of slaying the embryo. And men, too, violating a chaste and loving wife who hath from her maidenhood observed the vow of purity, became guilty of the same sin. The woman also who, being commanded by her husband to raise offspring, refuses to do his bidding, becometh equally sinful/ \"Thus, O timid one, was the existing usage established of old by Swetaketu, the son of Uddalaka in defiance of antiquity. O thou of taper thighs, it hath also been heard by us that Madayanti, the wife of Saudasa, commanded by her husband to raise offspring,^ went unto Riihi Vasistha. And on going in unto him, the handsome Madayanti obtained a son named Asmaka. She did this, moved by the desire of doing good to her husband. O thou of lotus-eyes thou knowest, O timid girL how we ourselves, for the prepetuation of the Kuru race, were begotten by Krishna Dwaipayana.

Especially, O thou of faultless feature, I, who am deprived of the power of procrea- tion, having yet become desirous of beholding offspring, deserve the more to be obyed by thee.

I used to wait respectfully upon Brahmanas of rigid vows and great ascetic merit. One day I gratified with my attentions that Brahmana whom people call Durvasas, of mind under full control and possessing knowledge of all the mysteries of religion. Pleased with my services, that Brahmana gave me a boon in the form of a mantra (formula of invocation) for calling into my presence any one of the celestials I liked. And the Rithi, addressing me, said Any one among the celestials whom thou callest by this, shall, O girl, approach thee and be obedient to thy will, whether he liketh it or not. And, O princess, thou shalt also have offspring through his grace ! O Bharata, that Brahmana told me this when I lived in my father's house. The words uttered by the Brahmana can never be false. The time also hath come when they may yield frut. Commanded by thee, O royal sage, I can by that mantra summon any of the celestials, so that we may have good children. O foremost of all truthful men, tell me which of the celestials I shall summon. Know that, as regards this matter, I wait your commands !' Hearing this, Pandu replied, 'O handsome one, strive duly this very day to gratify our wishes ! Fortunate one, summon thou the good of justice ! He is most virtuous of the celestials.

And bowing down to him and reverently circumambulating his person, she resolved to do his bidding.\" Thus ends the hundred and twenty-second section in the Sambhava Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION CXXIII (Sambhava Parva continued) Vaisampayana said, (i O Janamejaya, when Gandhari's conception had been a full year old, it was then that Kunti summoned the eternal god of justice to obtain offspring from him. And she offered without loss of time, sacrifices unto the god and began to duly repeat the formula that Durvasas had imparted to her some time before. Then the god, over-powered by her incantations, arrived at the spot where Kunti was seated in his car resplendent as the Sun. Smiling, he asked, \"O Kunti, what am to I give thee ? And Kunti too smiling in her turn, replied, 'Thou must even give me offspring !' Then the handsome Kunti was united (in intercourse) with the god of justice in his spiritual form and obtained from him a son devoted to the good of all creatures. And she brought forth his excellent child, who lived to acquire a great fame, at the eighth Muhurta called Abhijit, o f the hour of noon of that very auspicious day of the seventh month (Kartika), viz., the fifth of the lighted fortnight, when the star Jeshtha in conjunction with the moon was ascendant. And as soon as the child was born, an incorporeal voice (from the skies) said, 'This child shall be the best of men, the foremost of those that are virtuous. Endued with great prowess and truthful in speech, he shall certainly be the ruler of the Earth. And this first child of Pandu shall be known by the name of Yudhishthira. Possessed of prowess and honesty of disposition ; he shall be a famous king, known throughout the three worlds !' \"Pandu, having obtained that virtuous son, again addressed his wife said, The wise have declared that a Kshatriya must be endued with physical strength, otherwise he is no Kshatriya.

The god of wind thereupon begat upon her the child afterwards known as Bhima of mighty arms and fierce prowess. And upon the birth of that child endued with extraordinary strength, an incorporeal voice, O Bharata, as before, said, This child shall be the foremost of all endued with strength, 1 must tell you, O Bharata, of another wonderful event that occurred after the birth of Vrikodara (Bhima), While he fell from the lap of his mother upon the mountain breast, the violence of the fall broke into fragments the stone upon which he fell without his infant body being injured in the least. And he fell from his mother's lap because Kunti, frightened by a tiger, had risen up suddenly, unconscious of the child that lay asleep on her lap. And as she had risen, the infant, of body hard as the thunderbolt, falling down upon the mountain breast, broke into a hundred fragments the rocky mass upon which he fell. And beholding this, Pandu wondered much. And it so happened that that very day on which Vrikodara was born, was also, O best of Bharatas, the birthday of Duryyodhana who afterwards became the ruler of the whole Earth. t ''After the birth of Vrikodara, Pandu again began to think : 'How am I to obtain a very superior son who shall achieve world-wide fame ? Everything in the world dependeth of destiny and exertion. But destiny can never be successful except by timely exertion. We have been heard it said that Indra is the chief of the gods. Indeed, he is endued with immeasurable might and energy and prowess and glory. Gratifying him with my asceticism, I shall obtain from him a son of great strength. Indeed, the son he giveth me must be superior to all and capable of vanquishing in battle all men and creatures other than men. I shall, therefore, practise the severest austerities, with heart, deed and speech !' \"After this, the Kuru king Pandu, taking counsel with the great Rishis commanded Kunti to observe auspicious vow for one full year, while he himself commenced, O Bharata, to stand upon one leg from morning to evening, and practise other severe austerities with mind rapt in meditation, for gratifying the lord of the celestials. \"It was after a long time that Indra (gratified with such devotion) approached Pandu and, addressing him, said, 'I shall, give thee, O king, a son who will be celebrated all over the three worlds and who"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"288 MAHABHABATA will promote the welfare of Brahmanas, kine, and all honest men.

Invincible like Sakra himself he will spread thy fame far and wide. As Vishnu (the youngest of Aditi's sons) had enhanced Aditi's joy, so shall this child enhance thy joy ! Subjugating the Madras, the Kurus along with the Somakas, and the peoples of Chedi, Kasi and Karusha, he will maintain the prosperity of the Kurus.

And those fore- most sons of Kuru's born at an interval of one year after one another, looked like an embodied period of five years. And king Pandu, behold- ing his children of celestial beauty and of super-abundant energy, great strength and prowess, and of largeness of soul, rejoiced exceedingly. And the children became great favourites of the Rithis, as also of their wives, dwelling on the mountain of hundred peaks."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"292 MAHABHABATA \"Some time after, Pandu again requested Kunti on behalf of Madri. Addressed, O king, by her lord in private, Kunti replied, Having given her the formula of invocation only once, she hath, O king, managed to obtain two sons. Have I not been thus deceived by her ? I fear, O king, that she will soon surpass me in the number of her children ! This, indeed, is the way of all wicked women ! Fool that I was, I did not know that by invoking the twin gods I could obtain at one birth twin children. I beseech thee, O king, do not command me any further ! Let this be the boon granted (by thce) to me !' 'Thus, O king, were born unto Pandu five sons who were begotten by celestials and were endued with great strength, and who all lived to achieve great fame and expand the Kuru race. Each bearing every auspicious mark on his person, handsome like Soma, proud as the lion, well-skilled in the use of the bow, and of leonine tread, breast, heart, eyes, neck and prowess, those foremost of men, resembling the celestials themselves in might, began to grow up, And beholding them and their virtues growing with years, the great Riahis dwelling on that snow- capped sacred mountain were filled with wonder.

One day in the season of spring which maddens every creature the king accompanied by his wife (Madri), began to rove in the woods where every tree had put forth new blossoms. He beheld all around Palasas and Tilakas and Mangoes and Champakaa and Parihadrakas and Karnikaras, Asokas and Kesaras and Atimuktae and Kuruvakae with swarms of maddened bees sweetly humming about. And there were flowers of blossoming Parijatas with the Kokila (blackbird) pouring forth his melodies from under every twig echoing with the sweet hums of the black bees.

Beholding all these, Pandu felt the soft influence of desire. Roving like a celestial with a light heart admidst such scenery, Pandu was alone with his wife Madri in serai- transparent attire. And beholding the youthful Madri thus attired the king's desire flamed up like a forest fire. And ill able to suppress his desire thus kindled at the sight of his wife of eyes like lotus-petals, he was completely overpowered. The king then seized her against her will, but Madri trembling in fear resisted him to the best of her might. Consumed by desire, he forgot everything about his misfortune. And, O thou of Kuru's race unrestrained by the fear of (the Rishi's) curse and impelled by fate, the monarch, overpowered by passion, forcibly sought the embraces of Madri, as if he wished to put an end to his own life. His reason, thus beguiled by the great Destroyer himself by intoxicating his senses, was itself lost with his life. And the Kuru king Pandu, of virtuous soul, thus succumbed to the inevitable influence of Time, while united in intercourse with his wife. \"Then Madri, clasping the body of her senseless lord, began to weep aloud. And Kunti with her sons and the twins of Madri, hearing those cries of grief, came to the spot where the king lay in that state. Then, king, Madri addressing Kunti in a piteous voice, said 'Come hither alone, O Kunti, and let the children stay there/ Hearing these words, Kunti, bidding the children stay, ran with speed, exclaiming, 'Woe to me !' And beholding both Pandu and Madri lying prostrate on the ground she went in grief and affliction, saying, Of passions under com- plete control, this hero, O Madri, had all along been watched by me with care ! How did he then forgetting the Rishi's cursei approach thee with enkindled desire ? O Madri, this foremost of men should have been protected by thee ! Why didst, thou tempt him into solitude ? Always melancholy at the thought of the Rishi's curse, how came he to be merry with thee in solitude ?

And though unused to toil all her life, the affection- ate Kunti now regarded as very short the really long journey she had to perform. Having arrived at Kurujangala within a short time, the illustrious Kunti presented herself at the principal gate. The ascetics then charged the porters to inform the king of their arrival. The men carried the message in a trice to the court. And the citizens of Hastinapura, hearing of the arrival of thousands of Charanas and Munis, were filled with wonder.

And there also came out Bhishma, the son of Santanu and Somadatta or Valhika and the royal sage (Dhritarashtra) endued with the vision of knowledge and Vidura him- self and the venerable Satyavati and the illustrious princess of Kosala and Gandhari accompanied by the other ladies of the royal household. And the hundred sons of Dhritarashtra, decked with various ornaments, also came out. \"The Kauravas then, accompanied by their priest, saluted the Rishis by lowering their heads, and took their seats before them. The citizens also saluting the ascetics and bowing down unto them with touching the ground, took their seats there. Then Bhishma, setting that vast concourse perfectly still, duly worshipped, O king, those ascetics by offering them water to wash their feet with and the customary Arghya* And having done this, he spoke unto them about the sovereignty and the kingdom. Then the oldest of the ascetics with matted locks on head and loins covered with animal skin, stood up, and with the concurrence of the other Rishis, spoke as follows : 'Know ye all that that possessor of the sovereignty of the Kurus who was called king Pandu, had, after abandoning the plea- sures of the world, repaired hence to dwell on the Mountain of hundred peaks ! He adopted the Brahmacharyya mode of life, but for some inscrutable purpose the gods have in view, this his eldest son, Yudhish- thira, was born there, begotten by Dharma himself. Then that illustri- ous king obtained from Vayu this other sonthe foremost of all mighty men called Bhima. This other son, begotten upon Kunti by Indra, is Dhananjaya whose achievements will humble all bowmen in the world. Look here again at these tigers among men, mighty in the use of the bow, the twin children begotten upon Madri by the twin Aswins ! Leading in righteousness the life of a V anaprastha in the woods, the illustrious Pandu hath thus revived the almost extinct line of his grandfather. The birth, growth, and Vedic studies of these children of Pandu, will, no doubt, give you great pleasure. Steadily adhering to the path of the virtuous and the wise, and leaving behind him these children, Pandu departed hence seventeen days ago.

Hundreds of people began to distribute gems among the crowd on the occasion of the funeral rites of the king. At length some beautiful robes, and white umbrellas and larger yak-tails, were brought for the great deed. The priests clad in white walked in the van of the procession pouring libations of clarified butter on the sacred fire blazing in an ornamental vessel. And Brahmanas, and Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas, and Sudras by thousands followed the deceased king, loudly wailing in these accents : 'O prince, where dost thou go, leaving us behind, and making us forlorn and wretched for ever !' And Bhishma, and Vidura, and the Pandavas, also all wept aloud. At last they came to a romantic wood on the banks of the Ganges. There they laid down the hearse on which the truthful and lion-hearted prince and his spouse lay. Then they brought water in many golden vessels, washed the prince's body besmeared before with several kinds of fragrant paste, and again smeared it over with sandal paste. They then dressed it in a white dress made of national fabrics. And with the new suit on, the king seemed as if he was living and only sleeping on a costly bed. 11 When the other funeral ceremonies also were finished in consonance with the directions of the priests, the Kauravas set fire to the dead bodies of the king and the queen, bringing lotuses, sandal-paste, and other fragrant substances to the pyre. \"Then seeing the bodies aflame, Kausalya burst out, 'O, my son, my son !' and fell down senseless on the ground. And seeing her down the citizens and the inhabitants of the provinces began to wail from grief and affection for their king. And the birds of the air and the beasts of the field were touched by the lamentations of Kunti. And Bhishma, the son of Santanu and the wise Vidura, and the others also that were there, became disconsolate. \"Thus weeping, Bhishma, Vidura, Dhritarashtra, the Pandavas and the Kuru ladies, all performed the watery ceremony of the king. And when all this over, the people, themselves filled with sorrow, began to console the bereaved sons of Pandu. And the Pandavas with their friends began to sleep on the ground. Seeing this, the Brahmanas and the other citizens also renounced their beds.

Then the citizens returned to Hasti- napura with the sons of Pandu, now that they had been cleansed from the impurity incident to the demise of their father. All then fell to weeping for the departed king. It seemed as if they had lost one of their own kin. \"When the Sraddha had been celebrated in the manner mentioned above, the venerable Vyasa, seeing all the subjects sunk in grief, said one day to his mother Satyavati 'Mother, our days of happiness have gone by and days of calamity have succeeded. Sin beginneth to increase day by day. The world hath got old. The empire of the Kauravas will no longer endure because of wrong and oppression Go thou then into the forest, and devote thyself to contemplation through Yoga. Henceforth society will be filled with deceit and wrong. Good work will cease.

If thou permit, I would go to the forest with Kausalya, so grieved at the loss of her son !\" O king, saying this the queen, taking the permission of Bhishma also, went to the forest. And arriving there with her two daughters-in-law, she became engaged in profound contemplation, and in good time leaving her body ascended to heaven.\" Vaisampayana continued, ''Then the sons of king Pandu, having gone through all the purifying rites prescribed in the Vedas, began to grow up in princely style in the home of their father. Whenever they were engaged in play with the sons of Dhritarashtra, their superiority of strength became marked. In speed, in striking the objects aimed at, in consuming articles of food, and scattering dust, Bhimasena beat all the sons of Dhritarashtra. The son of the Wind-god pulled them by the hair and made them fight with one another, laughing all the while. And Vrikodara easily defeated those hundred and one children of great energy as if they were one instead of being a hundred and one. The second Pandava used to seize them by the hair, and throwing"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"ADI PABVA 299 them down, to drag them along the earth. By this, some had their knees broken, some their heads, and some their shoulders. That youth, sometimes holding ten of them, drowned them in water, and then off nearly dead. When the sons of Dhritarashtra got up to the boughs of a tree for plucking fruits, Bhima used to shake that tree, by striking it with his foot, so that down came the fruits and the fruit- pluckers at the same time. In fact, those princes were no match for Bhima in pugilistic encounters, in speed, or in skill. Bhima used to make a display of his strength by thus tormenting them in childishness but not from malice. \"Seeing these wonderful exhibitions of the might of Bhima, the powerful Duryodhana, the eldest son of Dhritarashtra, began to conceive hostility towards iiim. And the wicked and unrighteous Duryodhana, through ignorance and ambition, prepared himself for an act of sin. He thought, 'There is no other individual who can compare with Bhima, the second son of Pandu, in point of prowess. I shall have to destroy him .by artifice. Singly, Bhima dares a century of us to the combat. Therefore, when he shall sleep in the garden, I shall throw him into the current of the Ganga. Afterwards, confining his eldest brother Yudhish- thira and his younger Arjuna, I shall reign sole king without molesta- tion.' Determined thus, the wicked Duryodhana was ever on the watch to find out an opportunity for injuring Bhima. And, O Bharata, at length at a beautiful place called Pramanakoti on the banks of the Ganga, he built a palace decorated with hangings of board-cloth and other rich stuffs. And he built this palace for sporting in the water there, and filled it with all kinds of entertaining things and choice viands. Gay flags waved on the top of this mansion. The name of the house was 'the water-sport house.' Skilful cooks prepared various kinds of vainds. When all was ready, the officers gave intimation to Duryo- dhana. Then the evil-minded prince said unto the Pandavas, Let us all go to the banks of the Ganga graced with tress and crowned with flowers and sport there in the water.' And upon Yudhishthira agreeing to this, the sons of Dhritarashtra, taking the Pandavas with them, mounted country-born elephants of great size and cars resembling towns, and left the metropolis. \"On arriving at the place, the^princes dismissed their attendants, and surveying the beauty of the gardens and the groves, entered the palace, like lions entering their mountain caves. On entering they saw that the architects had handsomely plastered the walls and the ceilings and that painters had painted them beautifully. The windows looked very graceful, and the artificial fountains were splendid. Here and there were tanks of pellucid water in which bloomed forests of lotusea."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"300 MAHABHAEATA The banks were decked with various flowers whose fragrance filled the atmosphere. The Kauravas and the Pandavas sat down and began to enjoy the things provided for them. They became engaged in play and began to exchange morsels of food with one another. Mean- while the wicked Duryodhana had mixed a powerful poison with a quantity of food, with the object of making away with Bhima. That wicked youth who had nectar in his tongue and a razor in his heart, rose at length, and in a friendly way fed Bhima largely with that poisoned food, and thinking himself lucky in having compassed his end, was exceedingly glad at heart. Then the sons of Dhritarashtra and Pandu together became cheerfully engaged in sporting in the water. Their sport having been finished, they dressed themselves in white habiliments, and decked themselves with various ornaments. Fati- gued with play, they felt inclined in the evening to rest in the pleasure- house belonging to the garden. Having made the other youths exer- cise in the waters, the powerful second Pandava was excessively fatigued. So that on rising from the water, he lay down on the ground. He was weary and under the influence of the poison. And the cool air served to spread the poison over all his frame, so that he lost his senses at once. Seeing this Duryodhana bound him with chords of shrubs, and threw him into the water. The insensible son of Pandu sank down till he reached the Ndga kingdom. The Nagas, furnished with fangs containing virulent venom, bit him by thousands. The vegetable poison, mingled in the blood of the son of the Wind-god, was neutralised by the snake-poison. t The serpents had bitten all over his frame, except his chest, the skin of which was so tough that their fangs could not penetrate it. \"On regaining consciousness, the son of Kunti burst his bands and began to press the snakes down under the ground. A remnant fled for life, and going to their king Vasuki, represented, 'O king of snakes, a man sunk under the water, bound in chords of shrubs, probably he had drunk poison. For when he fell amongst us, he was insensible. But when we began to bite him, he regained his senses, and bursting his fetters, commenced laying at us. May it please your Majesty to enquire who is.' \"Then Vasuki, in accordance with the prayer of the inferior Nagas, went to the place and saw Bhimasena- Of the serpents, there was one, named Aryaka. He was the grand-father of the father of Kunti. The lord of serpents saw his relative and embraced him.

Let this prince drink as much as he can. 5 \"The king of serpents gave his consent. And the serpents thereupon began auspicious rites. Then purifying himself carefully, Bhimasena facing the east began to drink nectar. At one breath, he quaffed off a whole vessel, and in this manner drained off eight successive jars, till he was full. At length, the serpents prepared an excellent bed for him, on which he lay down at ease.\" Thus ends the hundred and twenty-eighth section in the Sambhava Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION CXXIX (Sambhava Parva continued) Vaisampayana said, ''Meanwhile the Kauravas and the Pandavas, after having thus sported there, set out, without Bhima, for Hastinapura, some on horses, some on elephants, while others preferred cars and other conveyances. And on their way they said to one another, 'Perhaps, Bhima hath gone before us*. And the wicked Duryodhana was glad at heart to miss Bhima, and entered the city with his brothers in joy. \"The virtuous Yudhishthira, himself unacquainted with vice and wickedness, regarded others to be as honest as himself. The eldest son Pritha, filled with faternal love, going unto his mother, said, after making obeisance to her, 'O mother, hath Bhima come ? O good 'mother, I don*t find him here. Where can he have gone ? We long sought for him everywhere in the gardens and the beautiful woods ; but found him no-where. At length, we thought that the heroic Bhima preceded us all. O illustrious dame, we come hither in great anxiety. Arrived here, where hath he gone ? Have you sent him anywhere ? O tell me, I am full of doubts respecting the mighty Bhima ? He had been asleep and hath not come. I conclude he is no more. \"Hearing these words of the highly intelligent Yudhishthira, Kunti shrieked in alarm, and said, Dear son, I have not seen Bhima ! He did not come to me- O return in haste, and with your brothers seek for him I' \"Having said this in affliction to her eldest son, she summoned Vidura, and said, 'O illustrious Ethattri, Bhimasena is missing !

Seeing him awake, the Nagas began to console and cheer him, saying, 'O thou of mighty arms, the strength-giving liquor thou hast drunk will give thee the might of ten thousand elephants ! No one now will be able to vanquish thee in fight ! O bull of Kuru's race, do thou bathe in this holy and auspicious water and return home. Thy brothers are disconsolate because of thee.\" \"Then Bhima purified himself with a bath in those waters, and decked in white robes and flowery garlands of the same hue, ate of the paramanna, ( rice and sugar pudding ) offered to him by the Nagas. Then that oppressor of all foes, decked in celestial orna- ments, received the adorations and blessings of the snakes, and saluting them in return, rose from the nether region. Bearing up the lotus-eyed Pandava from under the waters, the Nagas placed him in the self-same gardens wherein he had been sporting, and vanished in his very sight. \"The mighty Bhimasena, arrived on the surface of the Earth, ran with speed to his mother. And bowing down unto her and his eldest brother, and smelling the heads of his younger brothers, that oppressor of all foes was himself embraced by his mother and every one of those bulls among men. Affectionate unto one another, they all repeat- edly exclaimed, 'What is our joy to-day, O, what joy !' \"Then Bhima, endued with great strength and prowess, related to his brothers everything about the villany of Duryodhana, and the lucky and unlucky incidents that had befallen him in the world of the Serpents.

Thus cautioned by the righteous Yudhisthira, they all, with Yudhisthira himself, became very vigilant from that day. And in order that negligence might occur on the part of the sons of Kunti, Vidura continually offered them sage advice. \"Sometimes after, Duryodhana again mixed in the food of Bhima a poison that was fresh, virulent, and very deadly. But Yuyutsu (Dhritarashtra's son by a Vaisya wife), moved by his friendship for the Pandavas, informed them of this, Vrikodara, however, swallowed it without any hesitation, and digested it completely. And though virulent the poison produced no effects on Bhima \"When that terrible poison intended for the destruction of Bhima failed of effect, Duryodhana, Kama and Sakuni, without giving up their wicked design had recouise to numerous other contrivances for accomplishing the death of the Pandavas. And though every one of these contrivances was fully known to the Pandavas, yet in accordance with the advice of Vidura they suppressed their indignation. \"Meanwhile, the king (Dhritarashtra), beholding the Kuru princes passing their time in idleness and growing naughty, appointed Gautama as their preceptor and sent them unto him for instruction. Born among a clump of heath, Gautama was well-skilled in the Vedas and it was under him (also called Kripa) that the Kuru princes began to learn the use of arms.\" Thus ends the hundred and twenty-ninth section in the Sambhava Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION CXXX (Sambhava Parva continued) Janamejaya said, \"O Brahmana, it behoveth thee to relate to me everything about the birth of Kripa ! How did he spring from clump of heath ? Whence also did he obtain his weapons ?\" Vaisampayana said, \"O king, the great sage Gautama had a son named Saradwat. This Saradwat was born with arrows (in hand). O oppressor of foes, the son of Gautama exhibited great aptitude for the study of the science of weapons, but none for the other sciences. Saradwat acquired all his weapons by those austerities by which Brahmanas in student life acquire the knowledge of Vedas. Gautama (the son of Gotama) by his aptitude for the science of weapons and by his austerities made Indra himself greatly afraid of him.

At sight of the damsel, his bow and arrow slipped fro-ni his hand and his frame shook all over with emotion ; but possessed of ascetic fortitude and strength of soul, the sage mustered sufficient patience to bear up against the temp- tation. The suddenness, however, of his mental agitation, caused an unconscious emission of his vital fluid. Leaving his bow and arrows and deer-skin behind, he went away, flying from the Apsara. His vital fluid, however, having fallen upon a clump of heath, was divided into two parts, whence sprang two children that were twins. \"And it happened that a soldier in attendance upon king Santanu while the monarch was out ahunting in the woods, came upon the twins. And seeing the bow and arrows and deer-skin on the ground, he thought they might be the offspring of some Brahmana proficient in the science of arms. Deciding thus, he took up the children along with the bow and arrows, and showed what he had to the king. Be- holding them the king was moved with pity, and saying Let these become my children/ brought them to his palace.

And he began to bring them up and called them Kripa and Kripi, in allusion to the fact that he brought them up from motives of pity (Kripa). The son of Gotama having left his former asylum, continued his study of the science of arms in right earnest. By his spiritual insight he learnt that his son and daughter were in the palace of Santanu. He thereupon went to the monarch and represented everything about his lineage. He then taught Kripa the four branches of the science of arms, and various other branches of knowledge, including all their mysteries and recondiate details. In a short time Kripa became an eminent professor of the science (of arms), And the hundred sons of Dhritarashtra, and the Pandavas along with the Yadavas, and the Vrishnis, and many other princes from various lands, began to receive lessons from him in that science.\" Thus ends the hundred and thirtieth section in the Sambhava Parva of the Adi Parva."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"SECTION CXXXI (Sambhava Parva continued) Vaisampayana said, \"Desirous of giving his grandsons a superior education, Bhishma was on the look-out for a teacher endued with energy and well-skilled in the science of arms.

Pleased with the reception given him by the great Bhishma, that foremost of all men skilled in arms, viz., illustrious Drona of world-wide fame, accepted the princes as his pupils.

Arrived at the bank of the stream, he saw Ghritachi herself, that Apsara endued with youth and beauty, who had gone there a little before. With an expression of pride in her countenance, mixed with a voluptu- ous langour of attitude, the damsel rose from the water after her ablutions were over. And as she was gently treading on the bank, her attire which was loose became disordered. Seeing her attire disordered, the sage was smitten with burning desire. The next moment his vital fluid came out, in consequence of the violence of his emotion. The Rishi immediately held it in a vessel called a drona. Then, O king, Drona sprang from the fluid thus preserved in that vessel by the wise Bharadwaja. And the child thus born studied all the Vedas and their branches.

About this time Prishata had a son born unto him, named Drupada. And that bull among Kshatriyas, viz., Drupada the son of Prishata, used every day to come to the hermitage of Bharadwaja to play with Drona and study in his company. O monarch, when Prishata was dead, this Drupada of mighty arms became the king of the northern Panchalas. About this time the illustrious Bharadwaja also ascended to heaven. Drona continuing to reside in his father's hermitage devoted himself to ascetic austerities. Having become well-versed in the Vtdas and their branches and having burnt also all his sins by asceticism, the celebrated Drona, obedient to the injunctions of his father and moved by the desire of offspring married Kripi, the daughter of Saradwat. And the daughter of Gautama, ever engaged in virtuous acts and the Agmhotra, and the austerest of penances, obtained a son named Aswatthaman. And as soon as Aswatthaman was born, he neighed like the (celestial) steed Ucchaisravas. Hearing that cry, an invisible being in the skies said, 'The voice of this child hath like the neighing of a horse, been audible all around. The child shall, therefore, be known by the name of Aswatthaman (the horse-voiced). The son of Bharadwaja (Drona) was exceedingly glad at having obtained that child. Continuing to reside in that hermitage he devoted himself to the study of the science of arms. \"O king, it was about this time that Drona heard that the illustrious Brahmana Jamadagnya, that slayer of foes, that foremost one among all wielders of weapons, versed in all kinds of knowledge, had expressed a desire of giving away all his wealth to Brahmanas.

Arrived at Mahendra, the son of Bharadwaja possessed of high ascetic merit, beheld the son of Bhrigu, the exterminator of all foes, endued with great patience and with mind under complete control. Then, approaching wjth his disciples that scion of the Bhrigu race, Drona, giving him his name, told him of his birth in the line of Angiras.

Drona (for that Brahmana was no other), seeing the princes unsuccessful, and conscious of his own skill, smiled a little, and addressing them said, 'Shame on your Kshatriya might, and shame also on your skill in arms ! You have been born in the race of Bharata ! How is it that ye cannot recover the ball (from the bottom of this well) ? If ye promise me a dinner to-day, I will, with these blades of grass, bring up not only the ball ye have lost but this ring also that I now throw down!' Thus saying, Drona that oppressor of foes, taking off his ring, threw it down into the dry well. Then Yudhisthira, the son of Kunti, addressing Drona, said, O Brahmana, (thou askest for a trifle) ! Do thou with Kripa's permission, obtain of us that which would last thee for life !'

Devoted to the service of my preceptor, I lived with him for many years in the humble guise of Brahmacharin, with matted locks on my head. At that time, actuated by the same motives, the prince of Panchala, the mighty Yajnasena, also lived in the same asylum. He became my friend, always seeking my wealfare. I liked him much. Indeed, we lived together for many many years. O thou of Kuru's race, from our earliest years we had studied together and, indeed, he was my friend from boyhood, always speaking and doing what was agreeable to me. For gratifying me, O Bhishma, he used to tell me 'O Drona, I am the favourite child of my illustrious father. When the king installeth me as monarch of the Panchalas, the kingdom shall be thine. O friend, this, indeed, is my solemn promise ! My dominion, wealth and happiness, shall all be dependent on thee !' At last the time came for his departure. Having finished his studies, he bent his steps cowards his country. I offered him my regards at the time, and, indeed, I remembered his words ever afterwards. \"Sometime after, in obedience to the injunctions of my father and tempted also by the desire of offspring, I married Kripa of short hair, who gifted with great intelligence, had observed many rigid vows, and was ever engaged in the Agnihotra and other sacrifices and rigid auste- rities. Gautami, in time, gave birth to a son named Aswatthaman of great prowess and equal in splendour unto the Sun himself. Indeed, I was pleased on having obtained Aswatthaman as much as my father had been on obtaining myself. \"And it so happened that one day the child Aswatthaman observing some rich men's sons drink milk, began to cry. At this I was so beside myself that I lost all knowledge of the point of the compass. Instead of asking him who had only a few kine (so that if he gave me one, he would no longer be able to perform his sacrifices and thus sustain a loss of virtue) , I was desirous of obtaining a cow from one who had many, and for that I wandered from country to country. But my wanderings proved un- successful, for I tailed to obtain a milch cow. After I had come back unsuccessful, some of my son's playmates gave him water mixed with powdered rice.

Reproaching myself much, I at last resolved that even if I should have to live cast off and censured by Brahmanas, I would not yet, from desire of wealth, be anybody's servant, which is ever hateful. Thus resolved, \"O Bhishma, I went, for former friendship, unto the king of the Somakas, taking with me my dear child and wife. Hearing that he had been installed in the sovereignty (of the Somakas), I regarded myself as blest beyond compare. Joyfully I went unto that dear friend of mine seated on throne, remembering my former friendship with him and also his own words to me. And, O illustrious one, approaching Drupada, I said, *O tiger among men, know me for thy friend !' Saying this, I approached him confidently as a friend should. But Drupada, laugh- ing in derision cast me off as if I were a vulgar fellow. Addressing me he said, Thy intelligence scarcely seemeth to be of a high order, in as much as approaching me suddenly, thou sayest thou art my friend ! Time that impaireth everything, impaireth friendship also. My former friendship with thee was for a particular purpose. One of impure birth can never be a friend of one who is of pure birth. One who is not a car-warrior can never be a friend of one who is such. Friendship can only subsist between persons that are of equal rank, but not between those that are unequally situated. Friendship never subsisteth for ever in my heart. Time impaireth friendships, as also anger destroyeth them. Do thou not stick, therefore, to^that worn-off friendship between us. Think not of it any longer. The friendship I had with thee, O best of Brahmanas, was for a special purpose. There cannot be friendship between a poor man and a rich man, between an unlettered hind and a man of letters, between a coward and a hero. Why dost thou, therefore, desire, the revival of our former friendship ? thou of simple understanding, great kings can never have friend' ship with such indigent and luckless wights as thou ?

After he had rested awhile, Bhishma, taking with him his grandsons, the Kaurava princes, gave them unto him his pupils, making at the same time many valuable presents. And the mighty one (Bhishma) also joyfully gave unto the son of Bharadwaja a house that was tidy and neat and well filled with paddy and every kind of wealth. And that first of bowmen, Drona, thereupon joyfully, accepted the Kauravas viz., the sons of Pandu and Dhritarashtra, as his pupils. And having accepted them all as his pupils, one day Drona called them apart and making them touch his feet, told them with a swelling heart, 'I have in my heart a particular purpose. Promise me truly, ye sinless ones, that when ye have become skilled in arms, ye will accomplish it !\" Vaisampayana continued, \"Hearing these words, the Kuru princes remained silent. But Arjuna, O king, vowed to accomplish it whatever it was. Drona then cheerfully clasped Arjuna to his bosom and took the scent of his head repeatedly, shedding tears of joy all the while. Then Drona endued with great prowess taught the sons of Pandu (the use of) many weapons both celestial and human.

Indeed, although the instruction the preceptor gave, was the same in the case of all, yet in lightness and skill Arjuna became the foremost of all his fellow pupils. And Drona was convinced that none of his pupils would (at any time) be able to equal to that son of Indra- \"Thus Drona continued giving lessons to the princes in the science of weapons. And while he gave unto every one of his pupils a narrow- mouthed vessel (for fetching water) in order that much time may be spent in filling them, he gave unto his own Aswatthaman a broad- mouthed vessel, so that, filling it quickly, he might return soon enough. And in the intervals so gained, Drona used to instruct his own son in several superior methods (of using weapons). Jishnu (Arjuna) came to know of this, and thereupon filling his narrow mouthed vessel with water by means of the Varuna weapon he used to come unto his preceptor at the same time with his preceptor's son. And accordingly the intelligent son of Pritha, that foremost of all men possessing a knowledge of weapons, had no inferi- ority to his preceptor's son in respect of excellence. Arjuna's de- votion to the service of his preceptor as also to arms was very great and he soon became the favourite of his preceptor. And Drona, be- holding his pupil's devotion to arms, summoned the cook, and told him in secret, 'Never give Arjuna his food in the dark, nor tell him that I have told thee this'. A few days after however, when Arjuna was taking his food, a wind arose, and thereupon the lamp that had been burning went out. But Arjuna, endued with energy, continued eating in the dark, his hand, from habit, going to his mouth. His attention being thus called to the force of habit, the strong-armed son of Pandu set his heart upon practising with his bow in the night. And, O Bharata, Drona, hearing the twang of his bowstring in the night, came to him, and clasping him, said, 'Truly do I tell thee that I shall do that unto thee by which there shall not be a bowman equal to thee in this world !\" Vaisampayana continued, Thereafter Drona began to teach Arjuna the art of fighting on horse-back, on the back of elephants, on car, and on the ground. And the mighty Drona also instructed Arjuna in fighting with the mace, the sword, the lance, the spear, and the dart.

And hearing reports of his skill, kings and princes, desirous of learning the science of arms, flocked to Drona by thousands. Amongst those that came, there, O monarch, was a prince named Ekalavya, who was the son of Hiranyadhanus, king of the Nishadas (the lowest of the mixed orders). Drona, however, cognisant of all rules of morality, accepted not the prince as*his pupil in archery, seeing that he was a Nishada who might (in time) excel all his high-born pupils. Bur, O oppressor of all enemies, the .Nishada prince, touching Drona's feet with bent head, wended into the forest^ and there he made a clay-image of Drona, and began to worship it respectfully, as if it was his real preceptor, and practised weapons before it with the most rigid regularity. In consequence of his exceptional reverence for his pre- ceptor and his devotion to his purpose, all the three processes of fixing arrows on the bowstring, aiming, and letting off became very easy for him. \"And one day, O grinder of foes, the Kuru and the Pandava princes* with Drona's leave, set out in their cars on a hunting excursion. A servant, O king followed the party at leisure, with the usual implements and a dog. Having come to the woods, they wandered about, intent on the purpose they had in view. Meanwhile, the dog also, in wander- ing alone in the wood?, came upon the Nishada prince (Ekalavya). And beholding the Nishada of dark hue, of body besmeared with filth, dressed in black and bearing matted locks on head, the dog began to bark aloud*. \"Thereupon the Nishada prince, desirous of exhibiting his lightness of hand, sent seven arrows into its mouth (before it could shut it). The dog, thus pierced with seven arrows, came back to the Pandavas. Those heroes, who beheld that sight, were filled with wonder, and, ashamed of their own skill, began to praise the lightness of hand and pre- cision of aim by auricular precision (exhibited by the unknown archer). And they thereupon began to seek in those woods for the unknown dweller therein that had shown such skill). And, O king, the Pandavas soon found out the object of their search ceaselessly discharging arrows from the bow. And beholding that man of grim visage, who was totally a stranger to them, they asked, 'Who art thou and whose son ?' Thus questioned, the man replied, 'Ye heroes, I am the son of Hiranyadhanus king of the Nishadas. Know me also for a pupil of Drona, labouring for the mastery of the art of arms/ Vaisampayana continued, \"The Pandavas then, having made them- selves acquainted with every thing connected with him, returned (to the city), and going unto Drona, told him of that wonderful feat of archery which they had witnessed in the woods.

Why then is there a pupi! of thine, the mighty son of the Nishada king, superior to me ? Vaisampayana continued, \"On hearing these words, Drona reflected for a moment, and resolving upon the course of action he should follow, took Arjuna with him and went unto the Nishada prince. And he beheld Ekalavya with body besmeared with filth,, matted locks (on head), clad in rags, bearing a bow in hand and ceaselessly shooting arrows therefrom. And when Ekalavya saw Drona approaching towards him, he went a few steps forward, and touched his feet and prostrated himself on the ground. And the son of the Nishada king worshipp- ing Drona, duly represented himself as his pupil, and clasping his hands in reverence stood before him (awaiting his commands). Then Drona, O king, addressed Ekalavya, saying, If, O hero, thou art really my pupil, give me then my fees.' On hearing these words, 'Ekalavya was very much gratified,- and said in reply, O illustrious preceptor, what shall I give ? Command me ; for there is nothing, O foremost of all persons conversant with the Vedas, that I may not give unto my preceptor/ Drona answered 'O Ekalavya, if thou art really intent on making me a gift, I should like then to have the thumb of thy right hand.' Vaisampayana continued, \"Hearing these cruel words of Drona, who had asked of him his thumb as tuition-fae, Ekalavya, ever devoted to truth and desirous also of keeping his promise, with a cheerful face and an unafflicted heart, cut off without ado his thumb, and gave it unto Drona. After this, when the Nishada prince began once more to shoot with the help of his remaining fingers, he found, O king, that he had lost his former lightness of hand. And at this Arjuna became happy, the fever (of jealousy) having left him. \"Two of Drona's pupils became very much accomplished in the use of mace. These were Durypodhana, and Bhima, who were, however, always jealous of each other. Aswatthaman excelled everyone (in the mysteries of the science of arms).

And the wicked sons of Dhritarashtra, beholding Bhimasena endued with great strength and Arjuna accomplished in all arms, became very jealous of them. \"O bull among men one day Drona desirous of testing the compara- tive excellence of all his pupils in the use of arms, collected them all together after their education had been completed. And before assem- bling them together, he had caused an artificial bird, as the would-be aim, to be placed on the top of a neighbouring tree. And when they were all together, Drona said unto them, \"Take up your bows quickly and stand here aiming at that bird on the tree, with arrows fixed on your bowstrings ; shoot and cut off the bird's head, as soon as I give the order. I shall give each of you a turn, one by one, my children.\" Vaisampayana continued, \"Then Drona, that foremost of all Angira's sons first addressed Yudhishthira sayingi 'O irrepressible one, aim with thy arrow' and shoot as soon as I give the order. Yudhishthira took up the bow first, as desired, O king, by his preceptor, and stood aiming at the bird. But, O bull of Bharata's race. Drona in an instant, addressing the Kuru prince standing with bow in hand, said 'Behold, O prince, that bird on the top of the tree,' Yudhishthira replied unto his preceptor, saying, 'I do/ But the instant after, Drona again asked him, 'What dost thou see now, O prince ? Seest thou the tree, myself or thy brothers ?' Yudhishthria answered. 'I see the tree, myself, my brothers, and the bird ! Drona repeated his question, but was ans- wered as often in the same words. Drona then, vexed with Yudhishthira, reproachingly told him. 'Stand thou apart. It is not for thee to strike Ithe aim.' Then Drona repeated the experiment with D ur yy O - dhana and the other sons of Dhritarashtra, one after another, as also with his other pupils, Bhima and the rest, including the princes that had come unto him from other lands. But the answer in every case was the same as Yudhishthira's viz., (We behold the tree, thyself, our w fellow-pupils, and the bird). And reproached by their preceptor, they were all ordered, one after another, to stand apart.

Thou must let fly the arrow as soon as I give the order. Therefore, O son, stand here with bow and arrow for an instant.' Thus addressed, Arjuna stood aiming at the bird, as desired by his preceptor, with his bow bent. An instant after Drona asked him as in the case of others, 'Seest thou, O Arjuna, the bird there, the tree, and myself ?' Arjuna replied, 'I see the bird only,. but not the tree, or thyself.' Then the irrepressible Drona, well pleased with Arjuna, the instant after, again said unto that mighty car-warrior amongst the Pandavas, 'If thou seest the vulture, then describe it to me. Arjuna said, I see only the head of the vulture, not its body.' At these words of Arjuna, the hair (on Drona's body) stood on end from delight. He then said to Partha, 'Shoot.' And the latter instantly let fly (his arrow) and with his sharp shaft speedily struck off the head of the vulture on the tree and brought it down to the ground. No sooner was the deed done than Drona clasped Phalguna to his bosom and thought Drupada with his friends had already been vanquished in fight. \"Some time after, O bull of Bharata's race, Drona, accompanied by all of his pupils, went to the bank of the Ganga to bathe in that sacred stream. And when Drona had plunged into the stream, a strong alliga- tor, sent as it were, by Death himself seized him by the thigh. And though himself quite capable, Drona in a seeming hurry asked his pupil to rescue him. And he said, 'O, kill this monster and rescue me.' Contemporaneously with this speech, Vibhatsu (Arjuna) struck the monster within the water with five sharp arrows irresistible in their course, while the other pupils stood confounded, each at his place. Beholding Arjuna's readiness, Drona considered him to be the foremost of all his pupils, and became highly pleased. The monster, in the mean- time cut into pieces by the arrows of Arjuna, released the thigh of illustrious Drona and gave up the ghost. The son of Bharadwaja then addressed the illustrious and mighty car-warrior Arjuna and said, 'Accept, O thou of mighty arms, this very superior and irresistible weapon called Brahmasiia with the methods of hurling and recalling it. Thou must not, however, ever use it against any human foe, for if hurled at any foe endued with inferior energy, it might burn the whole universe, It is said, O child, that this weapon hath not a peer in the"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"318 MAHABHABATA three Worlds. Keep it, therefore, with great care, and listen to what I say. If ever, O hero, any foe, not human, contendeth against thee, thou mayst then employ it against him for compassing his death in battle.' Pledging himself to do what he was bid, Vibhatsu then, with joined hands, received that great weapon. The preceptor then, addressing him again, said, 'None else in this world, will ever become a superior bowman to thee ! Vanquished thou shalt never be by any foe, and thy achievements will be great.\" Thus ends the hundred and thirty-fifth section in the Sambhava Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION CXXXVI (Sambhava Parva continued) Vaisampayana said, \"O thou of Bharata's race, beholding the sons of Dhritarashtra and Pandu accomplished in arms, Drona, O monarch, addressed king Dhritarashtra, in the presence of Kripa, Somadattai Valhika, the wise son of Ganga (Bhishma), Vyasa, and Vidura, and said, *O best of Kurus kings, thy children have completed their edu- cation. With thy permission, O king, let them now show their pro- ficiency. 1 Hearing him, the king said with a gladdened heart 'O best of Brahmanas, thou hast, indeed, accomplished a great deed. Command me thyself as to the place and the time where and when and the manner also in which the trial may be held. Grief arising from my own blindness maketh me envy those who, blessed with sight, will behold my children's prowess in arms. O Kshatri (Vidura), do all that Drona sayeth. O thou devoted to virtue, I think there is nothing that can be more agreeable to me.' Then Vidura, giving the necessary assurance to the king, went out to do what he was bid. And Drona endued with great wisdom, then measured out a piece of land that was void of trees and thickets and furnished with wells and springs. And upon the spot of land so measured out, Drona, that first of eloquent men, selecting a lunar day when the star ascendant was auspicious, offered up sacrifice unto the gods in the presence of the citizens assem- bled by proclamation to witness the same. And then, O bull among men, the artificers of the king built thereon a large and elegant stage according to the rules laid down in the scriptures, and it was furnished with all kinds of weapons. They also built another elegant hall for the lady-spectators. And the citizens constructed many platforms, while the wealthier of them pitched many spacious and high tents all around."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"ADI PABVA 319 \"When the day fixed for the exhibition came, the king accompanied by his ministers, with Bhishma and Kripa, the foremost of preceptors, walking ahead, came unto that theatre of almost celestial beauty con- structed of pure gold, and decked with strings of pearls and stones of lapis lazuli. And, O first of victorious men, Gandhari blessed with great good fortune and Kunti, and the other ladies of the royal house- hold, in gorgeous attire and accompanied by their waiting women, joyfully ascended the platforms, like celestial ladies ascending the Sumeru mountain. And the four orders including the Brahmanas and Kshatriyas, desirous of beholding the princes' skill in arm, left the city and came running to the spot. And so impatient was every one to behold the spectacle, that the vast crowd assembled there in almost an insant. And with the sounds of trumpets and drums and the noise of many voices, that vast concourse appeared like an agitated ocean. \"At last, Drona accompanied by his son, dressed in white (attire), with a white sacred thread, white locks, white beard, white garlands, and white sandal paste rubbed over his body, entered the lists. It seemed as if the Moon himself accompanied by the planet \\ Mars appeared in an unclouded sky. On entering Bharadwaja performed timely worship and caused Brahmanas versed in mantras to celebrate the auspicious rites. And^'after auspicious and sweet-sounding musical instruments had been struck up as a propitiatory ceremony, some persons entered, equipped with various arms. And then having girded up their loins, those mighty warriors, those foremost ones of Bharata's race (viz., the princes) entered, furnished with finger-protectors (gauntlet), and bows, and quivers. And with Yudhishthira at their head, the valiant princes entered in order of age and began to show wonder- ful skill with their weapons. Some of the spectators lowered their heads, apprehending fall of arrows while others fearlessly gazed on with wonder. And riding swiftly on horses and managing them 'dexterously' the princes began to hit marks with shafts engraved with their respective names. And seeing the prowess of the princes armed with bows and arrows, the spectators thought that they were beholding the city of the Qandharvas, became filled with amazement. And, O Bharata, all on a sudden, some hundreds and thousands, with eyes wide open in wonder, exclaimed, 'Well done ! Well done !* And having repeatedly displayed their skill and dexterity in the use of the bows and arrows and in the management of cars, the mighty warriors took up their swords and bucklers, and began to range the lists, playing their weapons.

SECTION CXXXVII ( Sambhava Parva continued ) Vaisampayana continued, 'Upon the ~Kuru king and Bhima, the foremost of all endued with strength, having entered the arena, the spectators were divided into two parties in consequence of the partiality swaying their affections. Some cried Behold the heroic king of the Kurus ! some 'Behold Bhima ! And on a account of these cries, there was, all on a sudden, a loud uproar. And seeing the place become like a troubled ocean, the intelligent Bharadwaja said unto his dear son, Aswatthaman, Restrain both these mighty warriors so proficient in arms ! Let not the ire of the assembly be provoked by this combat of Bhima and Duryodhana. Vaisampayana continued, Then the son of the preceptor of the princes restrained those combatants with their maces uplifted and resembling two swollen oceans agitated by the winds that blow at the universal dissolution. And Drona himself entering the yard of the arena commanded the musicians to stop, and with a voice deep as that of the clouds addressed these words: Behold ye now that Partha who is dearer to me than my own son, the master of all arms, the son of Indra himself, and like unto the younger brother of Indra (Vishnu) !' And having performed the propitiatory rites, the youth Phalguna, equipped with the finger protector (gauntlet) and his quiver full of shafts and bow in hand, donning his golden mail, appeared in the lists even like an evening cloud reflecting the rays of the setting sun and illumined by the hues of the rainbow and flashes of lightning. \"On seeing Arjuna, the whole assembly were delighted and conches began to be blown all around with other musical instruments.

This is the foremost of well conducted persons, the great repository of the knowledge of manners !' At those exclamations, the tears of Kunti, mixing with the milk of her breast, wetted her bosom. And his ears being filled with that uproar, that first of men, Dhitarashtra, asked Vidura in delight, 'O Kshatri, what is this great uproar for, like unto that of the troubled ocean, arising all on a sudden and rending the very heavens ?' Vidura replied, 'O mighty monarch, the son of Pandu and Pritha Phalguna, clad in mail hath entered the lists. And hence this uproar !

By the Agncya weapon, he created fire, and by the Varuna weapon he created water ; by the Vayavya weapon, he created air, and by the Paryanya weapon he created clouds. And by the Bhauma weapon, he created land, and by the Paruatya weapon, he brought mountains into being. By the Antardhana weapon all these were made to disappear. Now the beloved of his preceptor (Arjuna) appeared tall and now short ; now he was seen on the yoke of his car, and now on the car itself ; and the next moment he was on the ground. And the hero favoured by his practised dexterity, hit with his various butts some tender, some fine and some of thick composition. And like one shaft, he let fly at a time into the mouth of a moving iron boar five shafts together from his bow- string. And that hero of mighty energy discharged one and twenty arrows into the hollow of a cow's horn hung up on a rope swaying to and fro. In .this manner, O sinless one, Arjuna showed his profound skill in the use of sword, bow. and mace, walking over the lists in circles. \"And, O Bharata, when the exhibition had well-nigh ended, the excitement of the spectators had cooled, and the sounds of instruments had died out there was heard proceeding from the gate, the slapping of arms, betokening might and strength, and even like unto the roar of the thunder.

SECTION CXXXVIII (Sambhava Parva continued) Vaisampayana continued, \"When the spectators, with eyes expand- ed with wonder, made way for that subjugator of hostile cities, Kama, that hero with his natural mail and face brightened with ear-rings, took up his bow and girded on his sword, and then entered the spacious lists, like a walking cliff. That far-famed destroyer of hostile hosts, the large eyed, Kama, was born of Pritha in her maidenhood. He was a portion of the hot-beamed Sun and his energy and prowess were like unto those of the lion, or the bull, or the leader of a herd of elephants. In splendour he resembled the Sun, in loveliness the Moon, and in energy the fire. Begotten by the Sun himself, he was tall in stature like a golden palm tree, and, endued with the vigour of youth, he was capable of slaying a lion. Handsome in features, he was possessed of countless accomplishments. The mighty armed warrior, eyeing all around the arena, bowed indifferently to Drona and Kripa. And the entire assembly, motionless and with steadfast gaze, thought, 'Who is he ? And they became agitated in their curiosity to know the warrior. And that foremost of eloquent men the offspring of the Sun, in a voice deep as that of the clouds, addressed his unknown brother, the son of the subduer of the Asura, Paka (Indra) saying, 'O Partha, I shall per- form feats before this gazing multitude, excelling all thou hast performed ! Beholding them, thou shalt be amazed !' And, O thou best of those blest with speech, he had hardly had done when the specta- tors stood up all at once, uplifted by some instrument as it were.

Kama replied, 'This arena is meant for all, not for thee alone, O Phalguna ! They are kings who are superior in energy ; and verily the Kshatriya regardeth might and might alone. What need of alterca- tion which is the excercise of the weak ! O Bharata, speak then in arrows until with arrows I strike off thy head to-day before the precep- tor himself !' Vaisampayana continued, 'Hastily embraced by his brothers, Partha then, that subduer of hostile cities, with the permission of Drona, advanced for the combat. On the other side, Kama, having been embraced by Duryyodhana with his brothers, taking up his bow and arrows, stood ready for the fight. Then the firmament became enveloped in clouds emitting flashes of lightning, and the coloured bow of Indra appeared shedding its effulgent rays. And the clouds is seemed to laugh in consequence of rows of white cranes that were then on the wing. And seeing Indra thus viewing the arena from affection ( for his son), the sun too dispersed the clouds from over his own offspring. And Phalguna remained deep hid under cover of the clouds, while Kama remained visible, being surrounded by the rays of the Sun. And the son of Dhritarashtra stood by Kama, and Bharadwaja and Kripa and Bhishma remained with Partha. And the assembly was divided, as also the female spectators. And knowing the state of things, Kunti the daughter of Bhoja, swooned away. And by the help of female attendants, Vidura, versed in the lore of all duties, revived the insen- sible Kunti by sprinkling sandal paste and water on her person. On being restored to consciousness, Kunti, seeing her two sons clad in mail was seized with fear, but she could do nothing (to protect them).

Learning all this, Partha will fight with thee or not (as he will think fit). Sons of kings never fight with men of inglorious lineage.' Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by Kripa Kama's coun- tenance became like unto a lotus pale and torn with the pelting showers in the rainy season. Duryyodhana said, 'O preceptor, verily the scriptures have it that three classes of persons can lay claim to royalty, viz. t persons of the blood royal, heroes, and lastly, those that lead armies. If Phalguna is unwilling to fight with one who is not a king. I will install Kama as king of Anga !' Vaisampayana said. \"At that very moment, seated on a golden seat, with parched paddy and with flowers and water pots and much gold, the mighty warrior Kama was installed king by Brahmanas versed in mantras. And the royal umbrella was held over his head, while Yak-tails waved around that redoubted the hero of graceful mien. And the cheers having ceased, king (Kama) said unto the Kaurava Duryyodhana, 'O tiger among monarchs, what shall I give unto thee that may com- pare with thy gift of a kingdom ?

And even as a mad elephant riseth from an assemblage of lotuses, the mighty Duryyodhana rose in wrath from among his brothers, and addressed that performer of dreadful deeds, Bhimasena, present there, 'O Vrikodara, it behoveth thee not to speak such words. Might is the cardinal virtue of a Kshatriya, and even a Kshatriya of inferior birth deseiveth to be fought with. The lineage of heroes, like the sources of lordly river, is ever unknown.

The illus- trious deity Guha, who combines in his composition the portions of all the other deities is of a lineage unknown. Some call him the offspring of Agni ; some, of Krittika, some, of Rudra, and some of Ganga. It hath been heard by us that persons born in the Kshatriya order have before become Brahmanas.

SECTION CXL Parva continued) Vaisampayana continued, \"Behold the Panda vas and the son of Dhritarashtra accomplished in arms, Drona thought the time had come when he could demand the preceptorial fee. And, O king, assembling his pupils one day together, the preceptor Diona asked cf them the fee, saying, \"Seize Drupada, the king of Panchala in battle and bring him unto me- That shall be the most acceptable fee. 1 Those warriors then answering, 'So be it, 1 speedly mounted up their chariots, and for bestowing upon their preceptor the fee he had demanded, marched out, accompanied by him. Those bulls among men, smitting the Panchalas on their way, laid seige to the capital of the great Drupada. And Duryyodhana and Kama and the mighty Yuyutsu, and Dusasana and Vikarna and Jalasandha and Sulochana, these and many other foremost of Kshatriya princes of great prowess, vied with one another in becoming the foremost in the attack. And the princes, riding in first class chariots and followed the cavalry, entered the hostile capital, and proceeded along the streets. \"Meanwhile, the king of Panchala, beholding that mighty force and hearing its loud clamour, came out of his palace, accompanied by his brothers.

And such was his lightness of motion on the field of battle that, though he was fighting unsupported on a single chariot, the Kurus from panic supposed that there were many Drupadas opposed to them. And the fierce arrows of that monarch fell fast on all sides, till conches and trumpets and drums by thousand began to be sounded by the Panchalas from their houses (giving the alarm)* Then there arose from the mighty Panchala host a roar terrible as that of the lion, while the twang of their bow- strings seemed to rend the very heavens, Then Duryyodhana and Vikarna, Suvahu and Dirghalochana and Dussasana becoming furious, began to shower their arrows upon the enemy. But the mighty bowman Prishata's son invincible in battle, though very much pierced with the arrows of the enemy instantly began, O Bharata, to afflict the hostile ranks with greater vigour. And careering over the field of battle like a fiery wheel, king Drupada with his arrows smote Duryyodhana and Vikarna and even the mighty Kama and many other heroic princes and numberless warriors, and slaked their thirst for battle. Then all the citizens showered upon the Kurus various missiles like clouds showering rain-drops upon the earth. Young and old, they all rushed to battle, assailing the Kurus with vigour. The Kauravas then, O Bharata, beholding the battle become frightful, broke and fled wailing towards the Pandavas. \"The Pandavas, hearing the terrible wail of the beaten host, re- verentially saluted Drona and ascended their chariots. Then Arjuna hastily bidding Yudhishthira not to engage in the fight, rushed forward, appointing the sons of Madri (Nakula and Sahadeva) the protectors of his chariot wheels, while Bhimasena ever fighting in the van, mace in hand, ran ahead. The sinless Arjuna, thus accompanied by his brothers, hearing the shouts of the enemy, advanced towards them, filling the whole region with the rattle of his chariot-wheels. And like a Makara entering the sea, the mighty-armed Bhima, resembling a second Yama, mace in hand, entered the Panchala ranks, fiercely roaring like the ocean in a tempest. And Bhima, mace in hand, first rushed towards the array of elephants in the hostile force, while Arjuna, proficient in battle, assailed that force with the prowess of his arms. And Bhima, like the great Destroyer himself, began to slay those elephants with his mace. Those huge animals, like unto mountains, stuck with Bhima's mace, had their heads broken into pieces.

And, O monarch, Arjuna, like unto the terrible fire that consumeth all things at the end of the Yuga t began to prostrate on the ground horses and cars and elephants by thousands. The Panchalas and the Srinjayas, on the other hand, thus assailed by the Pandava, met him with a perfect shower of weapons of various kinds. And they sent up a loud shout and fought desperately with Arjuna. The battle became furious and terrible to behold. Hearing the enemy's shouts, the son of Indra was filled with wrath and assailing the hostile host with a thick shower of arrows, rushed towards it furiously afflicting it with renewed vigour. They who observed the illustrious Arjuna at that time could not mark any interval between his fixing the arrows on the bowstring and letting them off. Loud were the shouts that rose there, mingled with cheers of approval. Then the king of the Panchalas, accompanied by (the generalissimo of his forces) Satyajit, rushed with speed at Arjuna like the Asura Samvara rushing at the chief of the celestials (in days of yore). Then Arjuna covered the king of Panchala with a shower of arrows. Then there arose a frightful uproar among the Panchala host like unto the roar of a mighty lion springing at the leader of a hard of elephants. And beholding Arjuna rushing at the king of Panchala to seiz^ him, Satyajit a great prowess rushed at him. And the two warriors, like unto Indra and the Asura -Virochana's son ( Vali ), approaching each other for combat, began to grind each other's ranks. Then Arjuna with great force pierced Satyajit with ten keen shafts at which feat the spectators were all amazed. But Satyajit, without losing any time, assailed Arjuna with a hundred shafts. Then that mighty car- warrior, Arjuna, endued with remarkable lightness of motion, thus covered by that shower of arrows, rubbed his bow-string to increase the force and velocity of his shafts. Then cutting in twain his antagonists bow, Arjuna rushed at the king of the Panchalas, but Satyajit, quickly taking up a tougher bow, pierced with his arrows Partha, his chariot, charioteer, and horses.

Then Arjuna, that foremost of warriors, crowned with success, began to fight furiously, and quickly cutting his enemy's bow in twain as also his flag-staff which he caused to fall down, pierced his antagonist's horses, and charioteer also with five arrows. Then throwing aside his bow Arjuna took his quiver, and taking out a scimitar and sending forth a loud shout, leaped from his own chariot upon that of his foe. And standing there with perfect fearlessness he seized Drupada as Garuda seizeth a huge snake after agitating the waters of the ocean. At the sight of this, the Panchala troops ran away in all directions. \"Then Dhananjaya, having thus exhibited the might of his arm in the presence of both hosts, sent forth a loud shout and came out of the Panchala ranks. And beholding him returning (with his captive), the princes began to lay waste Drupada's capital. Addressing them Arjuna said, 'This best of monarchs, Drupada, is a relative of the Kuru heroes. Therefore, O Bhima, slay not his soldiers ! Let us only give unto our preceptor his fee 1' Vaisampayana continued, 'O king, thus prevented by Arjuna, the mighty Bhimasena, though unsatiated with the exercise of battle, refrained from the act of slaughter. And, O bull of the Bharata race, the princes then, taking Drupada with them after having seized him on the field of battle along with his friends and counsellors, offered him unto Drona. And Drona beholding Drupada thus brought under com- plete control humiliated and deprived of wealth remembered that monarch's former hostility and addressing him said, Thy kingdom and capital have been laid waste by me. But fear not for thy life, though it dependeth now on the will of thy foe ! Dost thou now desire to revive thy friendship (with me) ? Having said this, he smiled a little and again said, 'Fear not for thy life, brave king ! We, Brahmanas are ever forgiving.

Therefore, O king, I ask for thy friend- ship again. And as a boon (unasked), I give thee half the kingdom (that was thine) !

Thenceforth Drupada began to reside sorrowfully in (the city of) Kampilya within (the province of) Makandi on the banks of the Ganga filled with many towns and cities. And after his defeat by Drona, Drupada also ruled the southern Panchalas up to the bank of the Charmanwati river. And Drupada from that day was well convinced that he could not, by Kshatriya might alone, defeat Drona, being very much his inferior in Brahma (spiritual) power. And he, therefore, began to wander over the whole Earth to find out the means of obtaining a son (who would subjugate his Brahmana foe). \"Meanwhile, Drona continued to reside in Ahicchatra. Thus, O king, was the territory of Ahicchatra full of towns and cities, obtained by Arjuna, and bestowed upon Drona!\" Thus ends the hundred and fortieth section in the Sambhava Parva of the Adi Parva.* '-e* ' SECTION CXLI (Sambhava Parva continued) Vaisampayana continued, -\"After the expiration, O king, of a year from this, Dhritarashtra, moved by kindness for the people, installed Yudhishthira the son of Pandu as the heir-apparent of the kingdom on account of his firmness, fortitude, patience, benevolence, frankness and unswerving honesty (of heart). And within a short time Yudhish- thira, the son of Kunti, by his good behaviour, manners and close application to business, overshadowed the deeds of his father. And the second Pandava, Vrikodara, began to receive continued lessons from Sankarshana (Valarama) in encounters with the sword and the mace and on the chariot. And after Bhima's education was finished, he became in strength like unto Dyumatsena himself and continuing to live in harmony with his brothers, he began to ezert his prowess.

And Drona certified that there was none in the world who was equal to Arjuna in lightness of hand and general proficiency. \"One day, Drona, addressing Arjuna before the assembled Kaurava princes, said, There was a disciple of Agastya in the science of arms called Agnivesa. He was my preceptor and I, his disciple. By ascetic merit I obtained from him a weapon called Brahmasira which could never be futile and which was like unto thunder itself one capable of consuming the whole Earth. That weapon O Bharata, from what I have done, may now pass from disciple to disciple. While imparting it to me, my preceptor said, O son of Bharadwaja, never shouldst thou hurl this weapon at any human being, especially at one who is of poor energy! Thou hast, O hero, obtained that celestial weapon ! None else deserveth it. But obey the command of the Rishi (Agnivesa). And, look here, Arjuna, give me now the preceptorial fee in the presence of these thy cousins and relatives!' When Arjuna, on hearing this, pledged his word that he would give what the preceptor demanded, the latter said, 'O sinless one, thou must fight with me when I fight with thee !' And that bull among the Kuru princes thereupon pledged his word unto Drona and touching his feet, went away northward. Then there arose a loud shout covering the whole Earth bounded by her belt of seas to the effect that there was. no bowman in the whole world like unto Arjuna. And, indeed, Dhananjaya, in encounters with the mace and the sword and on the chariot as also with the bow, acquired wonderful proficiency. Sahadeva obtained the whole science of morality and duties from ( Vrihaspati ) the spiritual chief of celestials, and continued to live under the control of his brothers. And Nakula, the favourite of his brothers taught by Drona, became known as a skilful warrior and a great car-warrior ( Ati-ratha ). Indeed, Arjuna and the other Pandava princes became so powerful that they slew in battle the great Sauvira who had performed a sacrifice extending over three years, undaunted by the raids of the Gandharvas. And the king 3& the Yavanas himself whom the powerful Pandu even had failed to &ring under subjection was brought by Arjuna under control. Then fegain Vipula, the king of the Sauviras, endued with great prowess, who had always shown a disregard for the Kurus, was made by the intelligent ^Arjuna to feel the edge of his power. And Arjuna also repressed by r means of his arrows (the pride of) king Sumitra of Sauvira, also known by the name of Dattamitra who had resolutely sought an encounter with him.

Thus ends the hundred and forty-first section in the Sambhava Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION CXLII Parva continued) Vaisampayana continued, \"On hearing that the heroic sons of Pandu endued with excess of energy had become so mighty, king Dhritarashtra became very miserable with anxiety. Then summoning unto his side Kanika that foremost of minister well-versed in the science of politics and an expert in counsels the king said, 'O best of Brahmanas, the Pandavas are daily overshadowing the Earth, I am exceedingly jealous of them. Should I have peace or war with them ? O Kanika, advice me truely, for I shall do as thou biddest.' Vaisampayana continued, \"That best of Brahmanas, thus addressed by the king, freely answered him in these pointed words well-agreeing with the import of political science.

Kings should ever be ready with uplifted maces (to strike when necessary), and they should ever increase their prowess. Carefully avoiding all faults themselves they should ceaselessly watch over the faults of their foes and take advantage of them. If the king is always ready to strike, everybody feareth him. Therefore the king should ever have recourse to chastisement in all he doth. He should so conduct himself that his foe may not detect any weak side in him. But by means of the weakness he detecteth in his foe he should pursue him (to destruction). He should always conceal, like the tor- toise . concealing its body, his means and ends, and he should always keep back his own weakness from the sight of others. And having began a particular act, he should ever accomplish it thoroughly. Behold, a thorn, if not extracted wholly, produceth a festering sore !

If he should happen to be great warrior, his hour of disaster also should be watched and he should then be induced to fly. O, sire, an enemy should never be scorned, however contemptible. A spark of fire *is capable of consuming an extensive forest if only it can spread from one object to another in proximity. Kings should some- times feign blindness and deafness, for if impotent to chastise, they should pretend not to notice the faults that call for chastisement. On occasion, such as these let them regard their bows as mode of straw. But they should be always on the aleit like a herd of deer sleeping in the woods. When thy foe is in thy power, destroy him by every means open or secret. Do not show him any mercy, although he seeketh thy protection. A foe, or one that hath once injured thee, should be destroyed by lavishing money, if necessary, for by killing him thou mayest be at your ease. The dead can never inspire fear. Thou must destroy the three, five and seven (resources) of thy foes. Thou must destroy thy foes root and branch. Then shouldst thou destroy their allies and partisans. The allies and partisans can never exist if the principal be destroyed. If the root of t|ie tree is torn up, the branches and twigs can never exist as before. Carefully concealing thy own means and ends, thou shouldst always watch thy foes, always seeking their flaws. Thou shouldst, O king, rule thy kingdom, always anxiously watching thy foes. By maintaining the perpetual fire by sacrifices, by brown cloths, by matted locks, and by hides of animals for thy bedding, shouldst thou at first gain the confidence of thy foes, and when thou hast gained it thou shouldst then spring upon them like a wolf. For it hath been said that in the acuisition of wealth even the garb of holiness might be employed as a hooked staff to bend down a branch in order to pluck the fruits that are ripe. The method followed in the plucking of fruits should be the method in destroying foes, for thou shouldst proceed on the principle of selection. Bear thy foe upon thy shoulders till the time cometh when thou canst throw him down, breaking him into pieces like an earthen pot thrown down with violence upon a stony surface. The foe must never be let off even though he addresseth thee most piteously. No pity shouldst thou show him but slay him at once. By the arts of conciliation or the expenditure of money should the foe be slain. By creating disunion amongst his allies, or by the employment of force, indeed by very means in thy power shouldst thou destroy thy foe.' \"Dhritarashtra said, Tell me truly how can a foe be destroyed by the arts of conciliation or the expenditure of money, or by producing disunion or by the employment of force/"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"334 MAHABHABATA \"Kanika replied, 'Listen, O monarch, to the history of a jackal dwelling in days of yore in the forest and fully acquainted with the science of politics. There was a wise jackal, mindful of his own interests who lived in the company of four friends, viz., a tiger, a mouse, a wolf, and a mongoose. One day they saw in the woods a strong deer the leader of a herd whom, however, they could not seize for his fleetness and strength. They thereupon called a council for consultation. The jackal opening the proceedings said, O tiger, thou hast made many an effort to seize this deer, but all in vain simply because this deer is young, fleet and very intelligent. Let now the mouse go and eat into its feet when it lieth asleep. And when this is done, let the tiger approach and seize it. Then shall we all, with great pleasure feast on it Hearing these words of the jackal, they all set to work very cautiously as he directed. And the mouse ate into the feet of the deer and the tiger killed it as anticipated. And beholding the body of the deer lying motionless on the ground, the jackal said unto his companions, Blessed be ye I Go and perform your ablutions. In the meantime I will look after the deer. Hearing what the jackal said, they all went into a stream. And the jackal waited there, deeply meditating upon what he should do. The tiger endued with great strength, returned first of all to the spot after having performed his ablutions. And he saw the jackal there plunged in meditation. The tiger said, Why art thou so sorrowful, O wise one ! Thou art the foremost of all intelligent beings. Let us enjoy ourselves to-day by feasting on this carcass ! The jackal said, Hear, O mighty-armed one, what the mouse hath said. He hath even said ; (O, fie on the strength of the king of the beast ! This deer hath been slain by me ! By might of my arm he will to-day gratify his hunger !) Wherrhe hath boasted in such a language, I, for my part, do not wish to touch this food. The tiger replied, If, indeed, the mouse hath said so, my sense is now awakened. I shall, from this day, slay with the might of my own arms, creatures ranging the forest and then feast on their flesh ! Having said this, the tiger went away. 1 'And after the tiger had left the spot, the mouse came. And seeing the mouse come, the jackal addressed him and said, Blest be thou, O mouse, but listen to what the mongoose hath said. He hath even said, (The carcass of this deer is poison (the tiger having touched it with his' claws). I will not eat of it. On the other hand, if thou, O jackal, permittest it, I will even slay the mouse and feast on him !) Hearing this the mouse became alarmed and quickly entered his hole. And after the mouse had gone, the wolf, O king, came there having performed"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"ADI PAKVA 33$ his ablutions. And seeing the wolf come, the jackal said unto him. The king of the beasts hath been angry with thee ! Evil is certain to overtake thee ! He is expected here with his wife. Do as thou pleasest ! Thus was the wolf also, fond of animal flesh, got rid of by the jackal. And the wolf fled, contracting his body into the smallest dimensions. It was then that the mongoose came. And, O king the jackal, seeing him come, said, By the might of my arm have I defeated the others who have already fled. Fight with me first and then eat of this flesh as you please I The mongoose replied, When, indeed, the tiger, the wolf, and the intelligent mouse have all been defeated by thee, heroes as they are, thou seemest to be a greater hero still ! I do not desire to fight with thee,- Saying this, the mongoose also went away/ \"Kanika continued, When they all had thus left the place, the Jackal, well-pleased with the success of his policy, alone ate up that flesh. If kings always act in this way, they can be happy. Thus should the timid by exciting their fears, the courageous by the arts of conciliation, the covetous by gift of wealth, and equals and inferiors by exhibition of prowess be brought under thy sway. Besides all this, O king, that I have said, listen now to something else that I say.' \"Kanika continued, 'If thy son, friend, brother, father, or even the spiritual preceptor, anyone becometh thy foe, thou shouldst, if desirous of prosperity, slay him without scruples. By curses and incantations, by gift of wealth, by poison, or by deception, the foe should be slain. He should never be neglected from disdain. If both the parties be equal and success uncertain, then he that acteth with deligence growth in prosperity. If the spiritual preceptor himself be vain, ignorant of what should be done and what left undone, and vicious in his ways, even he should be chastised. If thou art angry, show thyself as if thou art not so, speaking even then with a smile on thy lips. Never reprove any one with indications of anger (in thy speech). And O, Bharata, speak soft words before thou smiteth and even while thou art smithing ! After the smiting is over, pity the victim, and grieve for him, and even shed tears. Comforting thy foe by conciliation, by gift of wealth, and smooth behaviour, thou must smite him when he walketh not aright. Thou shouldst equally smite the heinous offender who liveth by the practice of virtue, for the garb of virtue simply covereth his offences like* black clouds covering the mountains. Thou shouldst burn the house of that person whom thou punishest with death. And thou shouldst never permit beggars and atheists and thieves to dwell in thy kingdom.

Thou shouldst make thy"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"336 MAHABHABATA teeth sharp to give a fatal bite. And thou should ever smite so effectually that thy foe may not again raise his head. Thou shouldst ever stand in fear of even one from whom there is no fear, not to speak of him from whom there is such. For if the first be ever powerful he may destroy thee to the root (for thy unpreparedness), Thou shouldst never trust the faithless, nor trust too much those that are faithful, for if those in whom thou confidest prove thy foes, thou art certain to be annihilated After testing their faithfulness thou shouldst employ spies in thy own kingdom and in the kingdoms of others. Thy spies in foreign kingdoms should be apt deceivers and persons in the garb of ascetics. Thy spies should be placed in gardens, places of amusement, temple^ and other holy places, drinking halls, streets, and with the (eighteen) tirthas (viz., the minister, the chief priest, the heir-presumptive, the Commander-in-chief, the gate-keepers of the court, persons in the inner appartments, the jailor, the chief surveyor, the head of the treasury, the general executant of orders, the chief of the town police, the chief architect, the chief justice, the president of the council, the chief of the punitive department, the commander of the fort, the chief of the arsenal, the chief of the frontier guards, and the keeper of the forests), and in places of sacrifice, near wells, on mountains and in rivers, in forests, and in all places where people congregate. In speech thou shouldst ever be humble, but let thy heart be ever sharp as razor. And when thou art engaged in doing even a very cruel and terrible act, thou shouldst talk with smiles on thy lips. If desirous of prosperity, thou shouldst adopt all arts humility, oath, conciliation, worshipping the feet of others by lowering thy head, inspiring hope, and the like, And person con- versant with the rules of policy is like a tree decked with flowers but bearing no fruit ; or, if bearing fruit, these must be at a great height not easily attainable from the ground ; and if any of these fruits seem to be ripe care must be taken to make it appear raw. Conducting himself in such a way, he shall never fade. Virtue, wealth and pleasure have both their evil and good effects closely knit together. While extracting the effects that are good, those that are evil should be avoided. Those that practise virtue (incessantly) are made unhappy for want of wealth and the neglect of pleasure. Those again in pursuit of wealth are made unhappy for the neglect of the two others. And so those who pursue pleasure suffer for their inattention to virtue and wealth. Therefore, thou shouldst pursue virtue, wealth and pleasure, in such a way that thou may- est not have to suffer therefrom. With humiliation and attention, with- out jealousy and solicitous of accomplishing thy purpose, shouldst thou, in all sincerity, consult with the Brahmanas.

He that hath never been afflicted with calamity can never have prosperity. This may be seen in the life of one who surviveth his calamities. He that is afflicted with sorrow should be consoled by the recitation of tht history of persons of former times (like those of Nala and Rama). He whose heart hath been unstrung by sorrow should be consoled with hopes of future prosperity. He again who is learned and wise should be con- soled by pleasing offices presently rendered unto him. He who, having concluded a treaty with an enemy, reposeth at ease as if he hath nothing more to do, is very like a person who awaketh, fallen down from the top of a tree whereon he had slept. A king should ever keep to himself his counsels without fear of calumny, and while beholding everything with the eyes of his spies, he should take care to conceal his own emotions before the spies of his enemies. Like a fisherman who becometh prosperous by catching and killing fish, a king can never grow pros- perous without tearing the vitals of his enemy and without doing some violent deeds. The might of thy foe, as represented by his armed force, should ever be completely destroyed, by ploughing it up (like weeds) and mowing it down and otherwise afflicting it by disease, starvation, and want of drink. A person is want never approacheth (from love) one in affluence ; and when one's purpose hath been accomplished, one hath no need to approach him whom he had hitherto looked to for its accomplishment. Thereforei when thou dost anything never do it completely, but ever leave something to be desired for by others (whose services thou mayest need). One who is desirous of prosperity should with diligence seek allies and means, and carefully conduct his wars. His exertions in these respects should always be guided by prudence. A prudent king should ever act in such a way that friends and foes may never knew his motive before the commencement of his acts. Let them know all when the act hath been commenced or ended, and as long as danger doth not come, so long only shalt thou act as if thou art atraid. But when it hath overtaken thee, thou must grapple with it courage- ously. He who trusteth in a foe who hath been brought under subjection by force, summoneth his own death as a crab by her act of conception. Thou shouldst always reckon the future act as already arrived (and concert measures for meeting it), else, from want of calmness caused by haste, thou mayest overlook an important point in meeting it when it is before thee. A person desirous of prosperity should always exert with prudence, adopting his measures to time and place.

Kunti repeatedly said this unto her sons. Hearing these words, Bhima's heart, from affection for his mother, was warmed by compassion and he resolvea to go (along as before). Then Bhima, proceeding through that terrible and extensive forest without a living soul, saw a beautiful banian tree with widespreading brandies. Setting down there his brothers and mother, O bull of Bharata's race, he said unto them, 'Rest you here, while I go in quest of water. I hear the sweet cries of acquatic fowls. I think there must be a large pool here.' Commanded, O Bharata, by his elder brother who said unto him, 'Go' and Bhima proceeded in the direction whence the cries of those acquatic fowls were coming. And, O bull of Bharata's race, he soon came upon a lake and bathed and slaked his thirst. And affectionate unto his brothers, he brought for them, O Bharata, water by soaking his upper garments. Hastily retracing his way over those four miles he came unto where his mother was and beholding her he was afflicted with sorrow and began to sigh like a snake. Distressed with grief at seeing his mother and brothers asleep on the bare ground, Vrikodara began to weep 'Oh wretch that I am, who beholdeth his brothers asleep on the bare ground, what can befall me, more painful than this ? Alas, they who formerly at Varanavata could not sleep on the softest and costliest beds are now asleep on the bare ground !

At nightfall they placed before Kunti all they gathered in their mendicant tours, and Kunti used to divide the whole amongst them, each taking what was allotted to him. And those heroic chastisers of foes, with their mother, together took one moiety of the whole, while the mighty Bhima alone took the other moiety. In this way, O bull of Bharata's race, the illustrious Pandavas lived there for sometime. \"One day, while those bulls of the Bharata race were out on their tour of mendicancy, it so happened that Bhima was (at home) with (his mother) Pritha. That day, O Bharata, Kunti heard a loud and heart- rending wail of sorrow coining from within the apartments of the Brahrnana. Hearing the inmates of the Brahmana's house wailing and indulging in piteous lamentations, Kunti, O king, from compassion and the goodness of her heart, could not bear it with indifference. Afflicted with sorrow, the amiable Pritha, addressing Bhima, said these words full of compassion : 'Our woes assuaged, we are, O son, living happily in the house of this Brahmana, respected by him and unknown to Dhritarashtra's son. O son, I always think of the good I should do to this Brahtnanai like what they do that live happily in others' abodes! O child, he is a true man upon whom favours are never lost. He payeth back to others more than what he receiveth at their hands. There is no doubt, some affliction hath overtaken this Brahmana. If we could be of any help to him, we should then be requiting his services.' \"Hearing these words of his mother, Bhima said, 'Ascertain, O mother, the nature of the Brahmana's distress and whence also hath it arisen.

These children also, bereft of me and thee, their father, will, I doubt not, perish like fish when the water drieth up. There is no doubt that bereft of thee the three will perish : therefore it behoveth thee to sacrifice me. O Brahmana, persons conversant with morals have said that for women that have borne children, to predecease their lords is an act of the heighest merit. Ready am I to abandon this son and this daughter, these my relations, and life itself, for thee. For a woman to be ever employ- ed in doing agreeable offices to her lord is a higher duty than sacrifices, asceticism, vows, and chanties of every description. The act, there- fore, which I intend to perform is consonant with the highest virtue and is for thy good and that of thy race. The wise have declared that children and relatives and wife and all things held dear are cherished for the purpose of liberating one's self from danger and distress. One must guard one's wealth for freeing one's self from danger, and it is by his wealth that he should cherish and protect his wife. But he must protect his own self both by (means of) his wife and his wealth. The learned have enunciated the truth that one's wife, son, wealth, and house, are acquired with the intention of providing against accidents, foreseen or unforeseen. The wise have also said that all one's relations weighed against one's own self would not be equal unto one's self. There- fore, reverend sir, protect thy own self by abandoning me. O, give me leave to sacrifice myself, and cherish thou my children ! Those that are conversant with the morals have, in their treatises, said, that women should never be slaughtered and that Rakshasas are not ignorant of the rules of morality. Therefore, while it is certain that the Rakshasa will kill a man, it is doubtful whether he will kill a woman- It behoveth thee, therefore, conversant as thou art with the rules of morality, to place me before the Rakshasa. I have enjoyed much happiness, have obtained much that is agreeable to me, and have also acquired great religious merit. I have also obtained from thee children that are so dear to me.

And smilingly did the child approach each of them, and at last taking up a blade of grass said in glee, \"With this I will slay Rakshasa who eateth human beings!' Although all them had been plunged in woe, yet hearing what the child lisped so sweetly, joy appeared on their faces.

The fee, however, fixed for that cannibal is his food, which consists of a cart-load of rice, two buffalos, and a human being who conveyeth them unto him. One after another, the house- holders have to send him this food. Difficult of being kept, the turn, however cometh to a particular family at intervals of many long years. If there are any that seek to avoid it, the Rakshasa slayeth them with their children and wives and devoureth them all. There is, in this country, a city called Vetrakiya, where liveth the king of these terri- tories. He is ignorant of the science of government, and possessed of little intelligence he adopts not with care any measure by which these territories may be rendered safe for all time to come. But we certainly deserve it all, inasmuch as we live within the dominion of that wretched and weak monarch in perpetual anxiety. Brahmanas can never be made to dwell permanently within the dominions of any one, for they are dependent on nobody, they live rather like birds ranging all countries in perfect freedom. It hath been said that one must secure a (good) king, then a wife, and then wealth. It is by the acquisition of these three that one can rescue his relatives and sons. But as regards the acquisition of these three, the course of my actions hath been the reverse. Hence, plunged into a sea of danger, I am suffering sorely. That turn, destructive of one's family, hath now devolved upon me. I shall have to give unto the Rakshasa as his fee the food of the afore- said description and one human being to boot.

When I have to choose between the death of a Brahmana and that of my own, I would prefer the latter. The killing of a Brahmana is the highest sin, and there is no expiation for it. I think a reluctant sacrifice of one's own self is better than the ruluctant sacri- fice of a Brahmana. O blessed lady, in sacrificing myself I do not become guilty of self-destruction. No sin can attach to me when another will take my life. But if I deliberately consent to the death of a Brahmana, it would be a cruel and sinful act, from the consequence of which there is no escape. The learned have said that the abandon- ment of one who hath come to thy house or sought thy protection, as also the killing of one who seeketh death at thy hands, is both cruel and sinful- The illustrious among those conversant with practices allowable in seasons of distress, have before now said that one should never per- form an act that is cruel and censurable.

There is no one on earth equal unto Bhima in might ; he may even overcome that foremost of warriors, the holder of the thunder-bolt himself.

I have not acted in this from foolishness or ignorance or from motive of gain. I have deliberately resolved to do this virtuous deed. By this act, O Yudhishthira, two objects will be accomplished ; one is a requital of the services rendered by the Brahmana and the other is the acquisition of high religious merit.

So also a Kshatriya who saveth the life of a Kshatriya achieveth that great fame in this world as in the other.

Thus asked by them repeatedly, that bull among Brahmanas, desirous of concealing the Pandavas, said these words unto all the citizens ; 'A certain high-souled Brahmana, skilled in mantras, beheld me weeping with my relatives after I had been ordered to supply the Rakshasa's food. Asking me the cause and ascertaining the distress of the town, that first of Brahmanas gave me every assurance and with smiles said, I shall carry the food for that wretched Rakshasa to-day. Do not fear for me ! Saying this he conveyed the food towards the forest of Vaka. This deed, so beneficial unto us all, hath very certainly been done by him.' '*Then those Brahmanas and Kshatriyas (of the city), hearing this, wondered much. And the Vaisyas and the Sudras also became exceedingly glad, and they 'all established a festival in which the worship of Brahma- nas was the principal ceremony (in rememberance of this Brahmana who had relieved them from their fears of Vaka).\" Thus ends the hundred and sixty-sixth section in the Vaka-badha Parva of the Adi Parva.

Within a few days there came a Brahmana of rigid vows unto the abode of their host to take up his quarters there.

Then those bulls among men, the Pandavas, with their mother Kunti, solicited the new lodger to narrate to them his interesting experiences. The Brahmana spake to them of various countries and shrines and (holy) rivers, of kings and many wonderful provinces and cities. And after this narration was over, that Brahmana, O 'Janamejaya, also spoke of the wonderful self-choice of Yajnasena's daughter, the princes of Panchala, and of the births of Dhrishtady.umna and Sikhahdi, and of the birth, without the intervention of a woman, of Krishna (Draupadi) at the great sacrifice of Drupada. \"Then those bulls among men, the Pandavas, hearing of these extra- ordinary facts regarding that illustrious monarch (Drupada), and desir- ing to know the details thereof, asked the Brahmana, after his narration was concluded, to satisfy their curiosity.

Though practising the vow of continence from his very youth, as soon as he felt the influence of desire, the Rishi's vital fluid came out. And as it came out, he held it in a pot (drona), and of that fluid thus preserved in a pot was born a son who came to be called Drona (the pot-born). And Drona studied all the Vedas and their several branches. And Bharadwaja had a friend named Prishata who was the king of Panchalas. And about the time that Drona was born, Prishata also obtained a son named Drupada. And that bull amongst Ks'uatriyas, Prishata's son, going every day to that asylum of Bharadwaja, played and studied with Drona. And after Prishata's death, Drupada succeeded him on the throne- Drona about this time heard that (the great Brahmana hero) Rama (on the eve of his retiring into the woods) was resolved to give away all his wealth. Hearing this, the son of Bharadwaja repaired unto Rama who was about to retire into the woods and addressing him, said, O best of Brahmanas, know me to be Drona who hath come to thee to obtain thy wealth 1 Rama replied, saying, I have given away everything. All that I now have is this body of mine and my weapons ! O Brahmana, thou mayest ask of me one of these two, either my body or my weapons !

After a time when the Pandavas became skilled in arms and sure aims, demanding of them his fee, he again told them these words Drupada, the son of Prishata is the king of Chhatravati.

And ever thinking of revenging himself on Drona, the monarch sighed incessantly. And that best of kings, O Bharata, even after much deliberation, saw no way of overcoming, by his Kshatriya might, the prowess and discipline and training and accomplishment of Drona. Wandering along the banks of the Yamuna and the Ganges, the monarch once came upon a sacred asylum of Brah- manas. There was in that asylum no Brahmana who was not a SnataJca. no one who was not of rigid vows, and none who was not virtuous to a high degree. And the king saw there two Brahmana sages named Yaja and Upayaja, both of rigid vows and souls under complete control and belonging. to the mos^: superior order. They were both devoted to the study of the ancient institutes and sprung from the race of Kasyapa. And those best of Brahmanas were well able to help the king in the attainment; of his object. The king then, with great assiduity and singleness of purpose, began to court this pair of excell- ent Brahmanas. Ascertaining the superior accomplishments of the younger of the two the king courted in private Upayaja of rigid vows, by the offer of every desirable acquisition. Employed in paying homage to the feet of Upayaja, always addressing in sweet words and offering him every object of human desire, Drupada, after worshipping that Brahmana, addressed him (one day), saying, O Upayaja, O Brahmana, if thou, performest those sacrificial rites by (virtue of) which I may obtain a son who may slay Drona, I promise thee ten thousand kine ! Or, whatever else may be agreeable to thee, O first of Brahmanas, truly am I ready to bestow on thee ! Thus addressed by the king, Rishi replied, saying, I cannot (perform such rites). But Drupada without accepting this reply as final, once more began to serve and pay homage unto that Brahmana. Then, after the expiration of a year, Upayaja, that first of Brahmanas, O monarchi addressing Drupada in sweet tone, said, My elder brother (Yaja), one day, while wander- ing through the deep woods, took up a fruit that had fallen upon a spot the purity of which he cared not to enquire about. I was follow- ing him (at the time) and observed this unworthy act of his. Indeed, he entertains no scruples in accepting things impure. In accepting that (particular) . fruit he saw not any impropriety of sinful nature. Indeed, he who observeth not purity (in one instance) is not very likely to observe it in the other instances. When he lived in the house of his preceptor, employed in studying the institutes, he always used to eat (impure) remnants of other people's feasts. He always speaks approv- ingly of food and entertains no dislike for anything. Arguing from these, I believe that my brother covets earthly acquisitions. Therefore.

Enmity with Drona burneth my heart ; it behoveth thee therefore to cool that heart of mine. Foremost of those conversant with the Wdas, Drona is also skilled in the Brahma weapon and for this, Drona hath overcome me in a contest arising from (impaired) friend- ship. Gifted with great intelligence, the son of Bharadwaja is (now) the chief preceptor of the Kurus. There is no Kshatriya in this world superior to him. His bow is full six cubits long and looks formidable, and his shafts are capable of slaying every living being. That great bow- man, the high-souled son of Bharadwaja, habited as a Brahmana, is destroying the Kshatriya power all over the Earth. Indeed, he is like a second Jamadagnya intended for the extermination of the Kshatriya race. There is no man on earth who can overcome the terrible force of his weapons. Like a blazing fire fed with clarified butter, Drona, possessed of Brahma might and uniting it with Kshatriya might, con- sumeth every antagonist in battle. But (thy) Brahma force is greater in itself than (Drona's) Brahma force united with Kshatriya might.

Ready am I to give thee ten thousand kine ! Hearing these words of Drupada, Yaja said, So be it Yaja then began to recollect the various ceremonies appertaining to the particular sacrifice. And knowing the affair to be a very grave one, he asked the assistance of Upayaja who coveted nothing. Then Yaja promised to perform the sacrifice for the destruction of Drona. Then the great ascetic Upayaja spoke unto king Drupada of everything required for the grand sacrifice (by aid of fire) from which the king was to obtain offspring. And he said O king, a child shall be born unto thee, endued as then as thou desirest, with great prowess, great energy, and great strength 1 ' \"The Brahmana continued, \"Then king Drupada, impelled by the desire of obtaining a son who was to slay Drona, began, for the success of his wish, to make the necessary preparations.

And immmediately after his birth, he ascended an excellent chariot and went about in it for sometime. Then the Panchalas in great joy shouted Excellent, Excellent. The very Earth seemed at that time unable to bear the weight of the Panchalas mad with joy. Then, marvellous to say, the voice of some invisible spirit in the skies said, This prince hath been born for the destruction of Drona. He shall dispel all the fears of the Panchalas and spread their fame. He shall also remove the sorrow of the king. And there arose, after this, from the centre of the sacrificial platform, a daughter also, called Panchali, who, blest with great good fortune, was exceedingly handsome. Her eyes were black, and large as lotuspetals, her complexion was dark, and her locks were blue and curly* Har nails were beautifully convex, and bright as burnished copper ; her eye-brows were fair, and bosom was deep. Indeed she resembled the veritable daughter of a celestial born among men. Her body gave out fragrance like that of a blue lotus, perceivable from a distance of full two miles. Her beauty was such that she had no equal on earth. Like a celestial her- self, she could be desired [ in marriage ] by a celestial, a Danava t or a Yaksha. When this girl of fair hips was born an incorporeal voice said, This dark-complexioned girl will be the first of all women, and she will be the cause of the destruction of many Kshatriyas. This slender- waisted one will, in time, accomplish the purpose of the gods, and along with her many a danger will overtake the Kauravas ! On hearing these words, the Panchalas uttered a loud leonine roar, and the Earth was unable to bear the weight of that joyous concourse. Then behold- ing the boy and the girl, the daughter-in-law of Prishata, desiring to have them, approached Yaja and said, Let not these know any one else except myself as their mother !

But who is Tapati that we should be called Tapatyas ? Vaisampayana continued, \"Thus addressed, the Qandharva related to Dhananjaya t the son of Kunti the (following) story well-known in the three worlds. \"The Qandhaiva said, 'O son of Pritha, O foremost of all intelligent men, I will duly recite to you in full this charming narration. O, listen with attention to what I say in explanation of why I have address- ed thee as Tapatya I That one in heaven who pervadeth by his light the whole firmament had a 'daughter named Tapati equal unto himself. Tapati, the daughter of the god Vivaswat, was the younger sister of Savitri, and she was celebrated throughout the three worlds and devoted to ascetic penances. There was no woman amongst the celestials, the Asuras, the Yakshas, the Rakshasas, the Apsaras, and the Gandharvas, who was equal to her in beauty. Of perfect, symmetrical and faultless features, of black and large eyes, and in beautiful attire, the girl was chaste and exceedingly well-conducted. And, O Bharata, seeing her Savitri (the sun) thought that there was none in the three worlds who, for his beauty, accomplishments, behaviour, and learning, deserved to be her husband. Beholding her attain the age of puberty and, therefore, worthy of being bestowed on a husband, her father knew no peace of mind, always thinking of the person he should select. At that time, O son of Kunti, Riksha's son, that bull amongst the Kurus, the mighty king Samvarana, was duly worshipping Suryya with offerings of Arghya and flower-garlands and scents, and with vows and fasts and ascetic pen- ances of various kinds. Indeed, Samvarana was worshipping Suryya confestly in all his glory, with devotion and humility and piety. And beholding Samvarana conversant with all rules of virtue and unequalled on Earth for beauty, Suryya regarded him as the fit husband for his daughter Tapati. And, O thou of Kuru's race, Vivaswat then resolved"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"ADI PABVA 395 to bestow his daughter on that best of kings, viz., Samvarana, the scion of a race of world-wide fame. As Suryya himself in the heavens filleth the firmament with his splendour, so did king Samvarana on earth fill every region with the splendour of his good achievements. And utterers of Brahma worship Suryya confestly in all his glory, so did all men, O Partha, except Brahmanas, worship Samvarana ! Blest with good luck, king Samvarana excelled Soma in soothing the hearts of friends and Suryya in scorching the hearts of foes. And, O Kaurava, Tapana (Suryya) himself was resolved upon bestowing his daughter Tapati upon king Samvarana, who was possessed of such virtues and accomplishments. 1 'Once on a time, O Partha, king Samvarana, endued with beauty (of person) and immeasurable prowess, went on a hunting expedition to the underwoods on the mountain-breast. While wandering in quest of deer, the excellent steed the king rode, overcome, O Partha, with hunger, thirst and fatigue, died on the mountains. Abandoning the steed, the king, O Arjuna, began to wander about upon the moun- tain-breast on foot and in course of his wandering the monarch saw a maiden of large eyes and unrivalled beauty. That grinder of hostile hosts that tiger among kings himself without a companion, beholding there that maiden without a companion, stood motionless gazing at her steadfastly. For her beauty, the monarch for some moment believed her to be (the goddess) Sree herself. Next he regarded her to be the embodiment of the rays emanating from Suryya. In splendour of her person she resembled a flame of fire, though in benignity and loveliness she resembled a spotless digit of the moon. And standing on the mountain-breast, the black-eyed maiden appeared like a bright statue of gold. The mountain itself with its creepers and plants, because of the beauty and attire of that damsel, seemed to be converted into gold. The sight of that maiden inspired the monarch with a contempt for all women that he had seen before. By beholding her, the king regarded his eye-sight truly blessed. Nothing the king had seen from the day of his birth could equal, he thought, the beauty of that girl, The king's heart and eyes were captivated by that damsel, as if they were bound with a cord and he remained rooted to that spot, deprived of his senses. The monarch thought that the artificer of so much beauty had created it only after churning the whole world of gods, Asuras and human beings- Entertaining these various thoughts, king Samvarana regarded that maiden as unrivalled in the three worlds for wealth of beauty.' 14 'And the monarch of pure descent, beholding the beautiful maiden, was pierced with Kama's (Cupid's) shafts and lost his peace of mind."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"MAHABHABATA Burnt with the strong flame of desire the king asked that charming maiden, still innocent, though in her full youth, saying, O thou of tapering things, who art thou and whose !

Instead, like lightning in the clouds, that large-eyed maiden quickly disappeared in the very sight of the wishful monarch.

His ministers and followers searching for him throughout the forest at length came upon him lying on that solitary spot, and beholding that excellent king, that mighty bowman, thus lying forsaken on the ground like a rainbow dropped from the firmanent, his minister-in- chief became like one burnt by a flame of fire. Advancing hastily with affection and respect, the minister raised that best of monarchs lying prostrate on the ground and deprived of his senses by desire. Old in wisdom as in age, old in achievements as in policy, the minister, after having raised the prostrate monarch, became easy (in mind). Addressing the king in sweet words that were also for his good, he said, Blest be thou, O sinless one I Fear not, O tiger among kings ! The minister thought that the monarch, that great feller of hostile ranks in battle, had been lying on the ground overcome with hunger, thirst, and fatigue. The old man then sprinkled over the crownless head of the monarch water that was cold and rendered fragrant with lotas- petals. Slowly regaining his consciousness, the mighty monarch sent away all his attendants with the exception of his minister only. After those attendants had retired at his command, the king sat upon the mountain-breast, Having purified himself duly, the king sat upon that chief of mountains, and began, with joined hands and upturned face, to worship Suryya. King Samvarana, that smiter of all foes, thought also of his chief priest Vasistha, that best of Rishis. The king continued to sit there day and night without intermission. The Brahmana sage Vasistha came there on the twelfth day : that great Rishis of soul under perfect command knew at once by his ascetic power that the monarch had lost his senses in consequence of Tapati. And. that virtuous and best of Munis , as soon as he knew this, desirous of behefitting the monarch who was ever observant of vows, addressed him and gave him every assurance. The illustri- ous Rishis, in the very sight of that monarch, ascended upward to inter- view Suryya, himself possessed of the splendour of that luminary. The Brahmana then approached with joined hands the god of a thousand rays and introduced himself cheerfully unto him, saying I am Vasistha.

That monarch is of mighty achievements, conversant with virtue, and of high soul. O firmament-ranger, Samvarana will make a worthy husband for thy daughter ! Thus addressed by the Rishi Vibhakara, resolved upon bestowing his daughter upon Samv.nana, saluted the Rishi, and replied unto him, saying Oh, Samvarana is the best of monarches, thou art the best of Rishis, Tapati is the best ot women. What should we do therefore but bestow her on Samvarana ? Saying this, the god Tapana made over his daughter Tapati of every feature perfectly faultless unto the illustrious Vasistha to bestow her upon Samvarana. And the great Rishi then accepted the girl Tapati and taking leave of Suryya, came back to the spot, where that bull amongst the Kurus, of celestial achievements, was. King Samvarana, possessed by Kama and with his heart fixed on Tapati, beholding that celestial maiden of sweet smiles led by Vasistha, became exceedingly glad. And Tapati of fair eyebrows came down from the firmament like lightning from the clouds, dazzling the ten points of the heavens. And the illustrious Rishi Vasistha of pure soul approached the monarch after the latter's twelve night's vow was over. It was thus that king Samvarana obtained a wife after having worshipped with ascetic penances the propitious lord Vivaswat, by the help of Vasistha's (ascetic power). And Samvarana, that bull among men with due rites took Tapati's hand on that mountain-breast which was resorted to by the celestials and the Gandharvas.

After the king had entered his capital, things became as before, for, when that tigar among kings came back to his own, the god of a thousand eyes, the slayer of Asuras, poured rain in abundance and caused corn to grow.

Thus whipped by the monarch, that best of Rishis, the son of Vasistha, was deprived of his senses by anger, and speedly cursed that first of monarchs, saying, O worst of king s, since thou persecutest like a Rakshasa an ascetic, thou shalt from this day, become a Rakshasa subsisting on human flesh ! Hence, thou worst of kings I Thou shalt wander over the earth, affecting human flesh ! This did the Rishi Saktri, endued with great prowess, speak unto king Kalmashapada. At this time Viswamitra, between whom and Vasistha there was a dispute about the discipleship of Kalmashapada, approached the place where that monarch and Vasistha's son were. And, O Partha, that Rishi of severe ascetic penances, viz., Viswamitra of great energy, approached the pair (knowing by his spiritual insight that they had been thus quarrelling with each other). After the curse had been pronounced, that best of monarcbs knew that Rishi to be Vasistha's son and equal unto Vasistha himself in energy. And, O Bharata, Viswamitra, desirous of benefitting himself, remained on that spot, concealed from the sight of both by making himself invisible. Then that best of monarchs, thus cursed by Saktri, desir- ing to propitiate the Rishi, began to humbly beseech him. And, O chief of the Kurus, Viswamitra, ascertaining the disposition of the king (and fearing that the difference might be made up), ordered a Rakshasa to enter the body of the king. And a Rakshasa of the name of Kinkara then entered the monarch's body in obedience to Saktn's curse and Viswamitra's command. And knowing, O chastiser of foes, that the Rakshasa had possessed himself of the monarch, that best of Rishii, Viswamitra, then left the spot and went away.' \"Shortly after, O Partha, the monarch, possessed by the Rakshasa and terribly afflicted by him, lost all his senses. At this time a Brah- mana beheld the king in the woods. Afflicted with hunger, that Brahmana begged of the king some food with meat. The royal sage, Kalmashapada, that cherisher of friends, answered the Brahmana, say ing, Stay thou here, O Brahmana for a moment ! On my return. I will give thee whatever food thou desirest !

A Brahmana waiteth for me in hope of food-. Go and entertain him with food with meat ! ' \"The Gandharva continued, \"Thus commanded, the cook went out in search of meat. Distressed at not having found any, he informed the king of his failure. The monarch, however, possessed as he was by the Rakshasa, repeatedly said, without scruple of any kind, Feed him with human meat.' The cook, saying, So be it, went to the place where the (king's) executioners were, and thence taking human flesh and washing and cooking it duly and covering it with boiled rice offered it unto that hungry Brahmana devoted to ascetic penances. But that best of Brahmanas, seeing with his spiritual sight that the food was unholy and, therefore, unworthy of being eaten, said these words with eyes red with anger, Because that worst of kings off ereth me food that is unholy and unworthy of being taken, therefore that wretch shall have himself a fondness for such food ! And becoming fond of human flesh as cursed by Saktri of old, the wretch shall wander over the earth, alarming and otherwise troubling all creatures IThe curse, therefore, on that king, thus repeated a second time, became very strong, and the king, possessed by a Rakshasa disposition, soon lost all his senses.' 1 'A little while after, O Bharata, that best of monarchs, deprived of all his senses by the Rakshasa within him, beholding Saktri who had cursed him, said, Because thou hast pronounced on me this extraordi- nary curse, therefore, I shall begin my life of cannibalism by devouring thee ! Having said this, the king immediately slew Saktri and ate him up, like a tiger eating animal it was fond of. Beholding Saktri thus slain and devoured, Viswamitra repeatedly urged that Rakshasa (who was within the monarch) against the other sons of Vasistha. Like a wrathful lion devouring small animals, that Rakshasa soon devoured the other sons of the illustrious Vasistha that were junior to Saktri in age. But Vasistha, learning that all his sons had been caused to be slain by Viswamitra, patiently bore his grief like the great mountain that bears the Earth. That best of Munis, that foremost of intelligent men, was resolved rather to sacrifice his own life than exterminate (in anger) the race of Kusikas.

At last when that Brahmana of rigid vows succeeded not in killing himself by any means, he returned, in d: of heart, to his asylum. 1 Thus ends the hundred and seventy-eighth section in the Claitra- ratha Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION CLXXIX (Chaitra-ratha Parva continued) \"The Oandharva continued, 'Beholding his asylum bereft of i.is children, the Muni afflicted with great grief left it again. And in course of his wandering he saw, O Partha, a river swollen with the waters of the rainy season, sweeping away numberless trees and plants that grew on its margin. Beholding this, O thou of Kuru's race, the distro Muni thinking that he would certainly be drowned if he fell into the waters of that river, he tied himself strongly with several cords and flung himself, under the influence of grief, into the current of that mighty stream. But, O slayer of foes, that stream soon cut those cords and cast the Rishi ashore. And the Rishi rose from the bank, freed from the cords with which he had tied himself. And because his cords were thus broken off by the violence of the current, the Rishi called the stream by the name of Vipasa ( the cord-breaker). For his grief the Muni could not, from that time, stay in one place ; he began to wander over mountains and along rivers and lakes. And beholding once again a river named Haimavati ( flowing from Himavata ) of terrible aspect and full of fierce crocodiles and other (aquatic) monsters, the Rishi threw himself into it, but the river mistaking the Brahmana for a mass of (unquenchable) fire, imme- diately flew in a hundred different directions, and hath been known ever since by the name of the Satadra (the river of a hundred cours Seeing himself on the dry land even there he exclaimed, O, I cannot die by my own hands I Saying this, the Rishi once more bent his steps towards his asylum.

His daughter-in-law then answered, I am Adrisyanti, the wife of Saktri. I am helpless, though devoted to asce- ticism Hearing her, Vasistha said, O daughter, whose is this voice that I heard, repeating the Vedas along with the Angas like unto the voice of Saktri reciting the Vedas with the Angas ? Adrisyanti answered, I bear in my womb a child by thy son Saktri. He hath been here full twelve years.

And the Rishi saw one day in the solitary woods (the Rakshasa) Kalma- shapada. The king, O Bharata, possessed by fierce Rakshasa, as he saw the Rishi, became filled with wrath and rose up, desiring to devour him. And Adrisyanti, beholding before her that Rakshasa of cruel deeds addressed Vasistha in these words, full of anxiety and fear !

The monarch, accompanied by Vasistha, re-entered his auspicious capital after a long time. The citizens of Ayodhya beheld their king accompanied by his priest, as if he were the rising sun. The monarch who was superior to everyone in beauty filled by his splendour the whole town of Ayodhya, like the autumnal moon filling by his splendour the whole firmament. And the excellent city itself, in consequence of its streets having been watered and swept, and of the rows of banners and pendants beautifying it all around, gladdened the monarch's heart. And, O prince of Kuril's race, the city filled as it was with joyous and healthy souls, in consequence of his presence looked gay like Amaravati with the presence of the chief of the celestials. After the royal sage had entered his capital, the queen, at the king's command, approached Vasistha. The great Rishi, making a covenant with her, united himself with her according to the high ordinance. And after a little while, when the queen conceived, that best of RisKis, receiving the reverential salutations of the king, went back to his asylum- The queen bore the embryo in her womb for a long time.

And, because the RisM Vasistha had resolved on self- destruction but had abstained therefrom as soon as he knew of the existence of that child, that child, when born, was called Parasara (the vivifier of the dead ). The virtuous Parasara, from the day of his birth, knew Vasistha for his father and behaved towards the Muni as such. One day, O son of Kunti, the child addressed Vasistha, that first of Brahmana sages, as father, in the presence of his mother Adrisyanti.

Then, O Bharata, the Pandavas wending to Utkochaka, the sacred asylum of Dhaumya installed Dhaumya as their priest. And Dhaumya the foremost of all conversant with the Vedas, receiving them with presents of wild fruits and (edible) roots, consented to become their priest.

And the high-souled Dhaumya, acquainted with the true meaning of the Vedas and every rule of morality, becoming the spiritual preceptor of the virtuous Pandavas, made them his Yajmanas (spiritual disciples).

Biting their nether lips in wrath, the other heroes there sons and grandsons of kingswith their eyes and hearts and thoughts set on Krishna, looked .with expanded eyes on Draupadi alone without noticing the Pandavas. And the sons of Pritha also, of mighty arms, and the illustrious twin heroes, beholding Draupadi, were all likewise struck by the shafts of Kama.

And while some were displeased, there were others that were well- pleased. And some there were, possessed of intelligence and foresight, who addressing one another said, 'Ye Brahmanas, how can a Brahmana stripling unpractised in arms and weak in strength, string that bow which such celebrated Kshatriyas as Salya and others endued with might and accomplished in the science and practice of arms could 54"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"426 MAHABHABATA not ?

Abstaining from all food or living upon air or eating of fruits, persevering in their vows, and emaciated and weak, Brahmanas are ever strong in their own energy. One should never disregard a Brahmana whether his acts be right or wrong, by supposing him incapable of achieving any task that is great or little, or that is fraught with bliss or woe, Rama the son of Jamadagni defeated in battle all the Kshatriyas. Agastya by his Brahma energy drank off the fathomless ocean. There- fore, say ye *Let this youth bend the bow and string it with ease' and many said, 1 So be it.'

And walking round that bow, and bending his head unto that giver of boonsthe lord Isana, and remem- bering Krishna also, he took it up. And that bow which Rukma, Suni- tha, Vakra, Radha's son, Duryyodhana, Salya, and many other kings accomplished in the science and practice of arms, could not even with great exertion, string, Arjuna the son of Indra that foremost of all persons endued with energy and like unto the younger brother of Indra ( Vishnu ) in might, stringed in the twinkling of an eye. And taking up the five arrows he shot the mark and caused it to fall down on the ground through the hole in the machine above which it had been placed. Then there arose a loud uproar in the firmament, and the amphitheatre also resounded with a loud clamour. And the gods showered celestial flowers on the head of Partha the slayer of foes.

And they said, 'Pass- ing us by and treating the assembled monarchs as straw this Drupada desireth to bestow his daughter that first of women, on a Brahmana ! Having planted the tree he cutteth it down when it is about to bear fruit. The wretch regardeth us not : therefore let us slay him ! He deserveth not our respect nor the veneration due to age. Owing to such qualities of his, we shall, therefore, slay this wretch that insulteth all kings, along with his son !

The Vedic declaration is well- known that the Swayamvara is for the Kshatriyas. The Brahmanas have no claim in respect of a selection of husband by a Kshatriya damsel. Or, ye kings, if this damsel desireth not to select any one of us as her lord, let us cast her into the fire and return to our kingdoms.

And Drupada beholding those monarchs all at once rushing towards him in anger with bows and arrows, sought, from fear, the protection of the Brah- manas. But those mighty bowmen (Bhima and Arjuna) of the Pandavas, capable of chatising all foes, advanced to oppose those monarchs rush- ing towards them impetuously like elephants in the season of rut. Then the monarchs with gloved ringers and upraised weapons rushed in anger at the Kuru princes, Bhima and Arjuna to slay them. Then the mighty Bhima of extraordinary achievements, endued with the strength of thun- der, tore up like an elephant a large tree and divested it of its leaves. And with that tree, the strong-armed Bhima the son of Pritha, that grinder of all foes, stood, like unto the mace-bearing king of the dead (Yama) armed with his fierce mace, near Arjuna that bull amongst men. And beholding that feat of his brother, Jishnu of extra- ordinary intelligence and himself also of inconceivable feats, wondered much.

And be- holding those feats of both Jishnu and his brother, Damodara (Krishna) of superhuman intelligence and inconceivable feats, addressing his brother, Halayudha ( Valadeva ) of fierce energy, said, That hero there, of tread like that of a mighty lion, who draweth the large bow in his hand four full cubits in length, is Arjuna ! There is no doubt, O Sankarshana, about this, if I am Vasudeva ! That other hero who having speedily torn up the tree hath suddenly become ready to drive off the monarchs is Vrikodara !

Having said this, the mighty Arjuna taking up the bow he had obtained as dower accompanied by his brother Bhima stood immovable as a mountain. And beholding those Kshatriyas who were ever furious in battle with Kama ahead, the heroic brothers rushed fearlessly at them like two elephants rushing against a hostile elephant. Then those monarchs eager for the fight fiercely exclaimed, \"The slaughter in battle of one desiring to fight is permitted.' And saying this, the monarchs suddenly rushed against the Brahmanas. And Kama endued with great energy rushed against Jishnu for fight. And Salya the mighty king of Madras rushed against Bhima like an elephant rushing against another for the sake of a she-elephant in heat ; while Duryyodhana and others engaged with the Brahmanas, skirmished with them lightly and carelessly* Then the illustrious Arjuna beholding Kama the son of Vikartana (Suryya) advancing towards him, drew his tough bow and pierced him with his sharp arrows.

Then Kama and Arjuna, both foremost of victorious, warriors, desirous of vanquishing each other, fought madly on. And such was the lightness of hand they both displayed that (each enveloped by the other's shower of arrows) they both became invisible (unto the spectators of their encounter).

Then address- ing his antagonist, Kama said, *O thou of foremost of Brahmanas.

Then hearing those words of his, Phalguna replied, saying, O Kama, I am neither the science of arms (personified), nor Rama endued with superhuman powers ! I am only a Brahmana who is the foremost, of all warriors of all wielders of weapons. By the grace of my preceptor I have become accomplished in the Brahma and the Paurandara weapons. I am here to vanquish thee in battle. Therefore. O hero, wait a little !

And sometimes pushing each other forward and sometimes dragging each other near, sometimes throwing each other down face downward and sometimes on the sides, they fought on, striking each other at times with their clenched fists. And encountering each other with blows hard as the clash of two masses of granite, the lists rang with the sounds of their combat. Fighting with each other thus for a few seconds, Bhima the foremost of the Kuru heroes taking up Salya on his arms hurled him to a distance. And Bhimasena that bull amongst men surprised all (by the dexterity of his feat) for though he threw Salya on the ground he did it without hurting him much. And when Salya was thus thrown down and Kama was struck with fear, the other monarchs were all alarmed.

Accomplished in battle, those monarchs then desisted from the fight. And those best of monarchs then returned to their respective kingdoms, wandering much. And those who came there went away saying, \"The festive scene hath terminated in the victory of the Brahmanas. The princess of Panchala hath become the bride of a Brahmana.

She began to think of various evils having overtaken her son. At one time she thought that the sons of Dhritarashtra having recognised her children had slain them. Next she feared that some cruel and strong Rakshasas endued with powers of deception had slain them. And she asked herself, \"Could the illustrious Vyasa himself (who had directed my sons to come to Panchala) have been guided by perverse intelligence ?'

It seems, O father, that our hope hath been fructified, for we have heard that the sons of Kunti all escaped from the conflagration of the house of lac.

Under these circumstances, the king of the Lunar race should not indulge in any regrets which can only make him unhappy without mending matters in the least. The desire that king Drupada hath all along cherished will be accomplished for his hand- some princess beareth, I think, every auspicious mark.

And be- holding that (golden) lotus, they wondered much- And amongst them, that foremost of celestials, viz*, Indra, desirous of ascertaining whence it came, proceeded up along the course of the Bhagirathee. And reach- ing that spot whence the goddess Ganga issues perennially, Indra beheld a woman possessing the splendour of fire.

' \"Vyasa continued, The woman thereupon answered O Sakra, thou mayest know who I am and why, unfortunate that I am, I weep, if only, O chief of the celestials, thou comest with me as I lead the way. Thou shalt then see what it is I weep for ! Hearing these words of the lady, Indra followed her as she led the way. And soon he saw, not far off from where he was, a handsome youth with a young lady seated on a throne placed on one of the peaks of Himavat and playing at dice. Beholding that youth, the chief of the celestials said, Know, intelligent youth, that this universe is under my sway ! Seeing, however, that the person addressed was so engrossed in dice that he took no notice of what he said, Indra was possessed by anger and repeated, I am the lord of the universe ! The youth who was none else than the god Mahadeva (the god of the gods), seeing Indra filled with wrath, only smiled, having cast a glance at him. At that glance, however, the chief of the celestials was at once paralysed and stood there like a stake. When the game at dice was over, Ishana addressing the weeping woman said, Bring Sakra hither, for I shall soon so deal with him that pride may not again enter his heart 1 As soon as Sakra was touched by that woman, the chief of the celestials with limbs paralysed by that touch, fell down on the earth. The illustrious Ishana of fierce energy then said unto him, Act not, O Sakra, ever again in this way ! Re- move this huge stone, for thy strength and energy are immeasura- ble, and enter the hole (it will disclose) where await some others possessing the splendour of the sun and who are all like unto thee I Indra then, on removing that stone, beheld a cave in the breast of that king of mountains, within which were four others resembling himself* Beholding their plight, Sakra became seized with grief and exclaimed, shall I be even like these ? Then the god Girisha (Ishana), looking full at Indra with expanded eyes, said in anger, O thou of a hundred sacrifices, enter this cave without loss of time, for thou hast from folly insulted me before my eyes! Thus addressed by the lord Ishana, the chief of the celestials, in consequence of that terrible imprecation, was deeply pained, and with limbs weakened by fear trembled like the wind-shaken leaf of a Himalayan fig. And cursed unexpectedly by the god owning a bull for his vehicle, Indra, with joined hands and shaking from head to foot, addressed that fierce god of multiform manifestations, saying, Thou art, O Bhava, the overlooker of the infinite Universe ! Hearing these words the god of fiery energy smiled and said, Those that are of disposition like thine never obtain my grace."},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"ADI PABVA 445 These other (within the cave) had at one time been like thee.

Ye shall accomplish all I have said and much more besides, of other kinds of work. Then those Indras, of their shorn glory, said We shall go from our celestial regions even unto the region of man where salvation is ordained to be difficult of acquisition. But let the gods Dharma, Vayu.Maghavat, and the twin Ashwins beget us upon our would-be mother. Fighting with men by means of both celestial and human weapons, we shall again come back into the region of Indra ! ' \"Vyasa continued, 'Hearing these words of the former Indras, the wielder of the thunder-bolt once more addressed that foremost of gods, saying, Instead of going myself, I shall, with a portion of my energy, create from myself a person for the accomplishment of the task (thou assignest) to form the fifth among these ! Vishwabhuk, Bhutadha- man, Sivi of great energy, Santi the fourth, and Tejaswin, these, i said were the five Indra of old. And the illustrious god of the formid- able bow, from his kindness, granted unto the five Indras the desire they cherished. And he also appointed that woman of extraordinary beauty, who was none else than celestial Sree (goddess of grace) herself, to be their common wife in the world of men. Accompanied by all those Indras, the god Isana then went unto Narayana of immeasurable energy, the Infinite, the Immaterial, the Increate, the Old, the Eternal, and the Spirit of these universe without limits. Narayana approved of every- thing. Those Indras then were born in the world of men. And Hari (Narayana) took up two hairs from his body, one of which hairs was black and the other white. And those two hairs entered the wombs of two of the Yadu race, by name Devaki and Rohini. And one of these hairs, viz., that which was white, became Valadeva. And the hair that was black was born as Kesava's self, Krishna. And those Indras of old who had been confined in the cave on the Himavat are none else than the sons of Pandu, endued with great energy. And Arjuna amongst the Pandavas, called also Savyasachin ( using both hands with equal dexterity ) is a portion of Sakra.' \"Vyasa continued, 'Thus, O king they who have been born as the Pandavas are none else than those Indras of old- And the celestial Sree herself who had been appointed as their wife is this Draupadi of extra- ordinary beauty.

Vaisampayana continued, \"Saying this, that sacred Brahmana Vyasa of generous deeds, by means of his ascetic power, granted celestial sight unto the king. Thereupon the king beheld all the Pandavas endued with their former bodies. And the king saw them possessed of celestial bodies, with golden crowns and celestial garlands, and each resembling Indra himself, with complexions radiant as fire or the sun, and decked with every ornament, and handsome, and youthful, with broad chests and statures measuring about five cubits. Endued with every accom- plishment, and decked with celestial robes of great beauty and fragrant garlands of excellent making the king beheld them as so many three- eyed gods (Mahadeva), or Vasus, or Rudras, or Adityas themselves. And observing the Pandavas in the forms of those Indras of old, and Arjuna also in the form of Indra sprung from Sakra himself, king Drupada was highly pleased. And the monarch wondered much on beholding that manifestation of celestial power under deep disguise. The king looking at his daughter, that foremost of women endued with great beauty, like unto a celestial damsel and possessed of the splendour of fire or the moon, regarded her as the worthy wife of those celestial beings, for her beauty, splendour and fame. And beholding that wonderful sight, the monarch touched the feet of Satyavati's son, ex- claming, 'O great Rishi, nothing is miraculous in thee !' The Rishi then cheerfully continued 'In a certain hermitage there was an illus- trious Rishi's daughter, who, though handsome and chaste, obtained not a husband. The maiden gratified, by severe ascetic penances, the god Sankara (Mahadeva). The lord Sankara, gratified at her penances, told her himself, Ask thou the boon thou desirest ! Thus addressed, the maiden repeatedly said unto the boon-giving Supreme Lord, I desire to obtain a husband possessed of every accomplishment ! Sankara, the chief of the gods gratified with her, gave her the boon she asked, saying. Thou shalt have, amiable maiden, five husbands ! The maiden, who had succeeded in gratifying the god, said again, O Sankara, I desire to have from thee only one husband possessed of every virtue ! The god of gods, well pleased with her, spake again, saying, Thou hast, O maiden, addressed me five full times, repeating, Give me a husband \\ Therefore, O amiable one, it shall even be as thou hast asked.

Now, however, that I know all, I can- not be indifferent to what hath been ordained by the gods. Therefore do I resolve to accomplish what thou hast said. The knot of destiny cannot be untied. Nothing in this world is the result of our own acts. That which had been appointed by us in view of securing one only bride- groom hath now terminated in favour of many. As Krishna (in a former life) had repeatedly said, O give me a husband !_ the great god himself even gave her the boon she had asked. The god himself knows the right or wrong of this.

And calling Yudhishthira there, Dhaumya, acquainted with mantras, united him with Krishna, Walking round the fire the bride-groom and the bride took each other's hand.

And it became known that the mighty warrior who had dashed Salya, the king of Madras, on the ground, and who in wrath had terrified the assembled monarchs by means of the tree ( he had up- rooted), and who had taken his stand before all foes in perfect fearless- ness, was none else than Bhima, that feller of hostile ranks, whose touch alone was sufficient to take the lives out of all foos. The monarchs, upon being informed that the Pandavas had assumed the guise of peace- ful Brahmanas, wondered much. They even heard that Kunti with all her sons had been burnt to death in the conflagration of the house of lac. They, therefore, now regarded the Pandavas in the light of persons who had come back from the region of the dead. And re- collecting the cruel scheme contrived by Purochana, they began to say, *O fie on Bhishma, fie on Dhritarashtra of the Kuru race !\" \"After the Self-choice was over, all the monarchs (who had come thither), hearing that Draupadi had been united witji the Pandavas, set out for their own dominions. And Duryyodhana, hearing that Draupadi had selected the owner of white steeds (Arjuna) as her lord, became greatly depressed.

Beholding the mighty sons of Pritha, escaped from the burning house of lac and allied with Drupada, and thinking of Dhrishtadyumna and Sikhandin and the other sons of Drupada all accomplished in fight, they were struck with fear and overcome with despair. \"Then Vidura, having learnt that Draupadi had been won by the Pandavas and that the sons of Dhritarashtra had come back ( to Ha^ti- napura) in shame, their pride humiliated, became filled with joy.

It was then that Vidura told the monarc i that Draupadi had chosen the Pandavas for her lords, and that those heroes were all alive and at peace, and that they had been received with great respect by king Drupada.

SECTION CCVI (Viduragamana Parva continued) Vaisampayana said, \"After Bhishma had concluded, Drona spoke, saying, 'O king Dhritarashtra, it hath been heard by us that friends summoned for consultation should always speak what is right, true, and conductive to fame. O sire, I am of the same mind in this matter with the illustrious Bhishma. Let a share of the kingdom be given unto the Pandavas. This is eternal virtue. Send, O Bharata, unto Drupada without loss of time some messenger of agreeable speech, carrying with him a large treasure for the Pandavas. And let the man go unto Drupada carrying costly presents foi both the brigegrooms and the bride, and let him speak unto that monarch of thy increase of power and dignity arising from this new alliance with him. And, O monarch, let the man know also that both thyself and Duryyodhana have become exceedingly glad in consequence of what hath happened. Let him say this repeatedly unto Drupada and Dhrishtadyumna. And let him speak also about the alliance as having been exceedingly proper, and agreeable unto thee, and of thyself being worthy of it. And let the men repeatedly propitiate the sons of Kunti and those of Madri (in proper words), And at thy command, O king, let plenty of ornaments of pure gold be given unto Draupadi. And let, O bull of Bharata f s race, proper presents be given unto all the sons of Drupada. Let the messenger then propose the return of the Pandavas to Hastinapura.

This, O monarch of Bharata's race, is what I think should be thy behaviour towards the Pandavas who are to thee even as thy own sons !' ' Vaisampayana continued, \"After Drona had ceased, Kama spake again, \"Both Bhima and Drona have been pampered with wealth that is thine and favours conferred by thee ! They are also always regarded by thee as thy trusted friends 1 What can therefore be more amusing than that they both should give thee advice which is not for thy good ? How can the wise approve that advice which is pronounced good by a person speaking with wicked intent but taking care to conceal the wick- edness of his heart ? Indeed, in a season of distress, friends can neither benefit nor injure. Every one's happiness or the reverse dependeth on destiny. He that is wise and he that is foolish, he that is young (in years) and he that is old, he that hath allies and he that hath none all become, it is seen everywhere* happy or unhappy at times. It hath been heard by us that there was, of old, a king by name Amvuvicha. Having his capital at Rajagriha, he was the king of all the Magadha chiefs. He never attended to his affairs. All his exertion consisted in inhaling the air. All his affairs were in the hands of his minister. And his minister, named Mahakarni, became the supreme authority in the state. Regarding himself all powerful, he began to disregard the king. And the wretch himself appropriated everything belonging unto the king, his queens and treasures and sovereignty. But the possession of all these, instead of satisfying his avarice, only served to inflame him the more. Having appropriated everything belonging to the king, he even coveted the throne. But it hath been heard by us that with all his best endeavours he succeeded not in acquir- ing the kingdom of the monarch, his master, even though the latter was inattentive to business and content with only breathing the air. What else can be said, O king, than that monarch's sovereignty was dependent on destiny ? If, therefore, O king, this kingdom be established in thee by destiny, it will certainly continue in thee, even if the whole world were to become thy enemy ! If, however, destiny hath ordained otherwise, howsoever mayest thou strive, it will not last in thee ! O learned one, remembering all this, judge of the honesty or otherwise of thy advisers ! Ascertain also who amongst them are wicked and who have spoken wisely and well f Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing these words of Kama, Drona replied, 'As thou art wicked it is evident thou sayestsoin consequence of the wickedness of thy intent !

SECTION CCVII ( Viduragamana Parva continued ) Vaisampayana said, \"After Drona had ceased, Vidura spoke, saying, 'O monarch, thy friends without doubt, are saying unto thee what is for thy good. But as thou art unwilling to listen to what they say, their words scarcely find a place in thy years. What that foremost one of Kuru's race viz., Bbishma, the son of Santanu, hath said, is excellent and is for thy good. But thou does not listen to it. The preceptor Drona also hath said much that is for thy good which how- ever Kama, the son of Radha doth not regard to be such. But, O king, reflecting hard I do not find any one who is better friend to thee than either of these two lions among men (viz., Bhishma and Drona), or any one who excels either of them in wisdom. These two, old in years, in wisdom, and in learning, always regard thee, O king, and the sons of Pandu with equal eyes- Without doubt, O king of Bharata's race, they are both, in virtue and truthfulness, not inferior to Rama, the son of Dasaratha, and Gay a. Never before did they give thee any evil advice. Thou also, O monarch, hast never done them any injury. Why should, therefore, these tigers among men, who are ever- truthful, give thee wicked advice, especially when thou hast never injured them ? Endued with wisdom these foremost of men, O king, will never give thee counsels that are crooked. O scion of Kuru's race, this is my firm conviction that these two, as they acquainted are with all rules of morality, will never, tempted by wealth, utter anything betraying a spirit of partizanship. What they have said, O Bharata, I regard highly beneficial to thee ! Without doubt, O monarch, the Pandavas are thy sons as much as Duryyodhana and others are. Those ministers, therefore, that give thee any counsel fraught with evil unto the Pandavas, do not really look to thy interests.

Thou however dost not understand it. What these bulls among men have said regarding the invincibility of the Pandavas is perfectly true- Think not otherwise of it, O tiger among men. Blest be thou I Can the handsome Dhananjaya the son of Pandu, using the right and the left hand with equal activ be vanquished in battle even by Maghavat himself ? Can the great Bhimasena of strong arms possessing the might of ten thousand elephants, be vanquished in battle by the immortals themselves ? Who also that desireth to live can overcome in battle the twins (Nakula and Sahadeva) like unto the sons of Yama himself, and well-skilled in fight ? How too can the eldest one of the Pandavas in whom patience, mercy, forgiveness, truth, and prowess always live together, be van- quished ? They who have Rama (Valadeva) as their ally, and Janar- dana ( Krishna ) as their counsellor, and Satyaki as their partisan! whom have they not already defeated in war ? They who have Drupada for their father-in-law, and Drupada's sons the heroic brothers, viz., Dhristadyumna and others of Prishata's race for their brothers-in-law, are certainly invincible. Remembering this, O monarch, and knowing that their claim to the kingdom is even prior to thine, behave virtuously towards them. The stain of calumny is on thee, O monarch, in consequence of that act of Purochana. Wash thyself of it now, by a kindly behaviour towards the Pandavas. This kindly behaviour of thine, O monarch, towards the Pandavas will be an act of great benefit to us, protecting the lives of us all that belong to Kuru's race, and leading to the growth of the whole Kshatriya order ! We had formerly warred with king Drupada ; if we can now secure him as an ally, it will strengthen our party.- The Dasarhas, O king, are num- erous and strong. Know where Krishna is, all of them must be, and where Krishna is, there victory also must be ! O king, who, unless cursed by the gods, would seek to effect that by means of war which can be effected by conciliation ? Hearing that the sons of Pritha are alive, the citizens and other subjects of the realm have become exceedingly glad and eager for beholding them. O monarch, act in a way that is agreeable to them. Duryyodhana and Kama and Sakuni the son of Suvala, are sinful, foolish and young, listen not to them !

And as my sons are en- titled to this kingdom, so are the sons of Pandu certainly entitled to it. Therefore, hie thee, O Kshatri, and bring hither the Pandavas along with their mother, treating them with affectionate consideration. O thou of Bharata's race, bring also Krishna of celestial beauty along with them. From sheer good fortune the sons of Pritha are alive ; and from good fortune alone those mighty car-warriors have obtained the daughter of Drupada !

Drupada received Vidura in proper form and they both enquired after each other's welfare. Vidura then saw there the Pandavas and Vasudeva. As soon as he saw them he embraced them from affection and enquired after their well-being. The Pandavas also along with Vasudeva, in due order, worshipped Vidura of immea- surable intelligence.

For these tigers among men (Rama and Krishna) are ever engaged in doing what is agreeable and beneBcial to the sons of Pandu. 1 \"Hearing this, Yudhishthira said, 'We are now, O monarch, with all our younger brothers, dependent on thee !

For the illustrious sons of Pandu now are to me as they are, without doubt, to Vasudeva. Kunti's son Yudhishthira himself doth not seek the welfare of the Pandavas so earnestly as, Keshava, that tiger among men. 1 Vaisampayana continued, \"Commanded by the illustrious Drupada, the Pandavas then, O king, and Krishna and Vidura, taking with them Krishna, the daughter of Drupada, and the renowned Kunti, journeyed towards the city called after the elephant, stopping at various places along the way for purposes of pleasure and enjoyment. King Dhrita- rashtra, hearing that those heroes had neared the capital, sent out the Kauravas to receive them. They who were thus sent out were, O Bharata, Vikarna of the great bow, and Chitrasena, and Drona that foremost of warriors, and Kripa of Gautama's line, Surrounded by these, those mighty heroes, their splendour enhanced by that throng slowly entered the city of Hastinapura. The whole city became radiant, as it were, with the gay throng of sight-seers animated by curiosity. Those tigers among men gladdened the hearts of all who beheld them. And the Pandavas, dear unto the hearts of the people, 'heard, as they proceeded, various exclamations which the citizens, ever desirous of obeying the wishes of those princes, loudly uttered.

If we have ever given away in charity, if we have ever poured libations of clarified butter on the fire, if we have any ascetic merit, let the Pandavas, by virtue of all those acts stay in our town for a hundred years P \"At last the Pandavas, on arriving at the place, worshipped the feet of Dhritarashtra, as also those of the illustrious Bhishma. They also worshipped the feet of everybody else that deserved that honour. And they enquired after the welfare of every citizen (there present).

Then those heroes of unfading splendour, viz., the Pandavas, with Krishna at their head, arriving there, beautified the place and made it a second heaven. And those mighty car-warriors, selecting with Dwaipayana's assistance a sacred and auspi- cious region, performed certain propitiatory ceremonies and measured out a piece of land for their city. Then surrounded by a trench wide as the sea and by walls reaching high up to the heavens and white as the fleecy clouds or the rays of the moon, that foremost of cities looked resplendent like Bhogavati (the capital of the nether kingdom) decked with the Nagas. And it stood adorned with palatial mansions and numerous gates, each furnished with a couple of panels resembling the out-stretched wings of Garuda. And it was protected with gateways looking like the clouis and high as the Mandara mountains. And well- furnished with numerous weapons of attack the missiles of the foes could not make the slightest impression on them. And they were almost covered with darts and other missiles like double-tongued snakes. The turrets along the walls were filled with armed men in course of training ; and the walls were lined with numerous warriors along their whole length. And there were thousands of sharp hooks and Sataghnis (machines slaying a century of warriors) and numerous other machines on the battlements. There were also large iron wheels planted on them. And with all these was that foremost of cities adorned. The streets were all wide and laid out excellently ; and there was no fear in them of accident. And decked with innumerable mansions, the city became like unto Amaravati and came to be called Indraprastha (like unto Indra's city). In a delightful and auspicious part of the city rose the palace of the Pandavas filled with every kind of wealth and like unto the mansion of the celestial treasurer (Kuvera) himself. And it looked like a mass of clouds charged with lightning. \"When the city was built, there came, O king, numerous Brahmanas well-acquainted with all the Vedas and conversant with every language,"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"464 MAHABHABATA wishing to dwell there.

With arms upraised, and eye-lids fixed, long was the period for which they observed their vows. And during the course of their ascetic penances, a wonderful incident occured there. For the mountains of Vindhya, heated for a long course of years by the power of their ascetic austerities, bagan to emit vapour from every part of their bodies.

Engaged in such acts, they are the enemies of the Asuras. All of us, therefore, mustering together should completely slaughter them off the face of the Earth ! Ordering their soldier? thus on the eastern shore of the grc^t ocean, and entertaining such a cruel reso- lution, the Asura brothers set out in all directions. And those that were performing sacrifices and the Brahmanas that were assisting at those sacrifices, the mighty brothers instantly slew. And slaughtering them with violence they departed for some other place. Whilst their soldiers threw into the water the sacrificial fires that were in the asylums of Munia with souls under complete control. The curses uttered by the illustrious Rishis in wrath, rendered abortive by the boons granted (by Brahman) ; affected not the Asura brother. When the Brahmanas saw that their curses produced not the slightest effect like shafts shot at stones they fled in all directions, forsaking their rites and vows. Even those Rishis on Earth that were crowned with ascetic success, and had their passions under complete control and were wholly engrossed in meditation of the Deity, from fear of the Asura brothers, fled like snakes at the approach of Vinata's son (Garuda the snake-eater). The sacred asylums were all trodden down and broken. The sacrificial jars and vessels being broken, their (sacred) contents were scattered over the ground. The whole universe became empty, as if its creatures had all been striken down during the season of general dissolution. And O king, after the Rishis had all disappeared and made themselves invisible both the great Asuras, resolved upon their destruction, began to assume various forms. Assuming the forms of maddened elephants with temples rent from excess of juice, the Asura pair, searching out the Rithis who had sheltered themselves in caves, sent them to the region of Yama.

Sacrifice and study ceased, and kings and Brahmanas were exterminated. The Earth became utterly destitute of sacrifices and festivals- And the terrified people uttered cries of Oh and Alas and all buying and selling were stopped. All religious rites ceased, and the Earth became destitute of sacred ceremonies and marriages. Agricul- ture was neglected and cattle were no longer tended. Towns and asylums became desolate. And scattered over with bones and skeletons, the Earth assumed a frightful aspect. All ceremonies in honour of the Pitris were suspended, and the sacred sound of Vashat and the whole circle of auspicious rites ceased. The Earth became frightful to behold. The Sun and the Moon, the Planets and Stars, and Constella- tions, and the other dwellers in the firmament, witnessing these acts of Sunda and Upasunda, grieved deeply. Subjugating all the points of heaven by means of such cruel acts, the Asura brothers took up their abode in Kurukshetra, without a single rival.\" Thus ends the two hundred and twelfth section in the Rajya-labha Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION CCXIII ( Rajya-labha Parva continued ) \"Narada continued, \"Then the celestial Rishis, the Siddhaa, and the high-souled Rishis possessing the attributes of tranquility and self- restraint, beholding that act of universal slaughter, were afflicted with great grief. With passions and senses and souls under complete control, they then went to the abode of the Grandsirei moved by compassion for the universe. Arrived there, they beheld the Grandsire seated with gods, Siddhas, and Brahmarshis around him. There were present that God of gods, viz., Mahadeva, and Agni, accompanied by Vayu, and Soma and Suryya and Sakra, and Rishis devoted to the contemplation of Brahma, and the Vaikhanasas, the Valikhillyas, the Vanaprasthas, the Marichipas, the Ajas, the Avimudas, and other ascetics of great energy. All those Rishis were sitting with the Grandsire, when the celestial and other Rishis, approaching Brahman with sorrowful hearts, represented unto him all the acts of Sunda and Upasunda. And they told the Grandsire in detail everything that the Asura brothers had done, and how they had done it, and in what order.

Resolving to compass the destruction of the Aaura brothers, he summoned Viswakarmnn ( the celestial architect). Seeing Viswakarman before him, the GranJsire possessed of supreme ascetic merit commanded him, saying, Create them a damsel capable of captivating all hearts ! -Bowing down unto the Grandsire and receiving his command with reverence, the great arti- ficer of the universe created a celestial maiden with careful attention, Viswakrit first collected whatever of handsome creatures, mobile upon the body of the damsel he created. Indeed, the celestial maiden that he created was almost a mass of gems. And created with great care by Viswakarman, the damsel, in beauty, became unrivalled among the women of the three worlds. There was not even a minute part of her body which by its wealth of beauty could not rival upon it the gaze of beholders. And like unto the embodied Sree herself, that damsel of extraordinary beauty captivated the eyes and hearts of every creature. And because she had been created with portions of every gem taken into minute measures, the Grandsire bestowed upon her the name of Tilottama. And as soon as he started into life, the damsel bowed to Brahman and with joined hands said, Lord of every created thing, what task am I to accomplish and what have I been created for ? The Grandsire answered, Go, O Tilottama, unto the Asuras Sunda and Upasunda ! O amiable one, tempt them with thy captivating beautv ! And, O damsel, conduct thyself there in such a way that the Aaura brothers may, in consequence of the wealth of thy beauty, quarrel with each other as soon as they cast their eyes upon thee.

The illustrious Brahman was then sitting with face turned eastwards, and Mahadeva with face also towards the east, and all the celestials with face north- wards, and the Rishis with face towards all directions. While Tilottama walked round the conclave of the celestials, Indra and the illustrious Sthanu ( Mahadeva ) were the only ones that succeeded in preserving their tranquility of mind. But exceedingly delirous as Mahadeva was (of beholding Tilottama), when the damsel (in her progress round the celestial conclave) was at his side, another face like a full-blown lotus appeared on the southern side of his body. And when she was behind him, another face appeared on the west. And when the damsel was on the nothern side of the great gcd, a fourth face appeared on the nothern side of his body. Mahadeva (who was eager to behold the damsel ) came also to have a thousand eyes, each large and slighty reddish, before, behind and on his flanks.

And when Tilottama set out (for the city of the Aauras) behold- ing the wealth of her beauty, regarded the task as already accomplished.

Having brought all the treasures of the gods, the Oandharvas, the Yakahaa, the Nagaa, Rakshaaaa, and the kings of the Earth, the brothers began to pass their days in great happiness. When they saw they had no rivals (in the three worlds), they gave up all exertion and devoted their time to plea- sure and merriment, like the celestials. They experienced great happi- ness by giving themselves up to every kind of enjoyment, such as wo- men, and perfumes and floral wreaths and viands, and drinks and many other agreeable objects all in profusion. In houses and woods and gardens, on hills and in forests, wherever they liked they passed their time in pleasure and amusement, like the immortals. And it so happen- ed that one day they went for purposes of pleasure to a table-land of the Vindhya range, perfectly level and stony, and overgrown with blossoming trees. After every object of desire, all the most agree- able kind, had been brought, the brothers sat on an excellent seat, with happy hearts and accompanied by handsome women. And those damsels, desirous of pleasing the brothers, commenced a dance in accompaniment to music, and sweetly chanted many a song in praise of the mighty pair.' \"Meanwhile Tilottama attired in a single piece of red silk that exposed all her charms, came along, plucking wild flowers on her way. She advanced slowly to where those mighty Aauras were gathering as she walked kamikaras from the trees that grew along the river-side,"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"ADI PARVA 473 The Asura brothers, intoxicated with the large potions they had imbib- ed, were smitten upon beholding th;t maiden of transcedent beauty. Leaving their seats they went quickly to where the damsel was. Both of them being under the influence of lust, each sought the maiden for himself. And Sunda seized that maid of fair brows by her right hand. Intoxicated with the boons they had obtained, with physical might, with the wealth and gems they had gathered from every quarter, and with the wine they had drunk, maddened with all these, and influenced by wishful desire, they addressed each other, each contracting his bow in anger, She is my wife, and therefore your superior, said Sunda. She is my wife, and therefore your sister-in-law, replied Upasunda. And they said unto each other She is mine not yours And soon they were under the influence of rage. Maddened by the beauty of the damsel, they soon forgot their love and affection for each other. Both of them, deprived of reason by passion then took up their fierce maces. Each repeating, I was the first. I was the first, (in taking her hand) struck the other. And the fierce Asuras, struck by each other with the mace, fell down upon the ground, their bodies bathed in blood, like two suns dislodged from the firmament. And beholding this, the women that had come there, and the other Asuras there present, all fled away trembling in grief and fear, and took refuge in the nether regions. The Grandsire himself of pure soul, then came there, accompanied by the celestials, and the great Rishis. And the illustrious Grandsire applauded Tilottama and expressed his wish of granting her a boon. The Supreme Deity, before Tilottama spoke, desirous of granting her a boon, cheerfuly said O beautiful damsel, thou shalt roam in the region of the Adityas. Thy splendour shall be so great that no body will ever be able to look at thee for any length of time 1 The Grandsire of all creatures, granting this boon unto her, establishing the three worlds in Indra as before, returned to his own region. 1 \"Narada continued \"It was thus that Asuras, ever united and inspired by the same purpose slew each other in wrath for the sake of Tilottama.

By the prowess of their arms they brought many kings under their sway. And Krishna became obedient unto all the five sons of Pritha those lions among men, of immeasurable energy. Like the river Saraswati decked with elephants, which again take pleasure in that stream, Draupadi took great delight in her five heroic husbands and they too took delight in her. And in conse- quence of the illustrious Pandavas being exceedingly virtuous in their practice, the whole race of Kurus, free from sin, and happy, grew in prosperity. \"After some time, O king, it so happened that certain robbers lifted the cattle of a Brahmana, and while they were carrying away the booty, the Brahmana, deprived of his senses by anger, repaired to Khandava- prastha, and began to reprove the Pandavas in accents of woe. The Brahmana said* 'Ye Pandavas, from this, your dominion, my kine are even now being taken away by force by despicable and wicked wretches ! Pursue ye the thieves !

Coming out with the bow, he cheerfully told the Brahmana, Proceed, O Brahmana, with haste, so that those wretched robbers may not go much ahead of us.

And, O thou of Bharata's race, that bull among the Bharatas saw, as he journeyed, many delightful and picturesque forests, lakes, rivers, seas, provinces, and waters.

Beholding that Rishi of immeasurable energy, our hearts were filled with joy. Saluting him with reverence, O Partha, we stood before him, with blushing faces. He asked of us the cause of our sorrow we told him all. Hearing what had happened the Rishi said, In the lowlands bordering on the southern ocean, there are five regions of sacred water.

Rising from the waters they all regained their own forms. Those Apsaras then, O king, all looked as before. Freeing those sacred waters (from the danger of which they had been notorious), and giving the Apsaras leave to go where they chose, Arjuna became desirous of once more beholding Chitrangada. He, therefore, proceeded towards the city of Manipura. Arrived there he beheld on the throne the son he had begotten upon Chitrangada, and who was called by the name of Vabhruvahana. \"Seeing Chitrangada once more, Arjuna proceeded, O monarch, towards the spot called Gokarna.\" Thus ends the two hundredth and nineteenth section in the Arjuna- vanavasa Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION CCXX (Arjuna-vanavasa Parva continued) Vaisampayana said, Then Arjuna of immeasurable prowess saw, one after another, all the sacred waters and other holy places that were on the shores of the western ocean. Vibhatsu reached the sacred spot called Probhasa. When the invisible Arjuna arrived at that sacred and delightful region, the slayer of Madhu (Krishna) heard of it. Madhava soon went there to see his friend the son of Kunti. Krishna and Arjuna met together and embracing each other enquired after each other's welfare. Those dear friends, who were none else than the Rishis Nara and Narayana of old, sat down. Vasudeva asked Arjuna about his travels, saying, 'Why, O Pandava, art thou wandering over the Earth, beholding all the sacred waters and other holy places ?' Then Arjuna told him everything that had happened. Hearing ail, that mighty hero of Vrishni's race said, This is as it should be. And Krishna and Arjuna having sported as they liked, for sometime at Probhasa, went to the Raivataka mountain to pass some days there. Before they arrived at Raivataka, that mountain had, at the command of Krishna, been well adorned by many artificers- Much food also had, at Krishna's command, been collected there. Enjoying everything that had been collected there for him, Arjuna sat with Vasudeva to see the perfor- mances of the actors and the dancers. Then the high-souled Pandava, dismissing them all with proper respect, laid himself down on a well- adorned and excellent bed. As the strong-armed one lay on that ex- cellent bed, he described unto Krishna everything about the sacred"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"MAHABHABATA waters, the lakes and the mountains, the rivers and the forests he had seen. While he was speaking of these, stretched upon that celestial bed, sleep, O Janamejaya, stole upon him. He rose in the morning, awakened, by sweet songs and melodious notes of the Vina (guitar) and the penegy- rics and benedictions of the bards. After he had gone through the necessary acts and ceremonies, he was affectionately accosted by him of the Vrishni race. Riding upon a golden car, the hero then set out for Dwaraka, the capital of the Yadavas. And, O Janamejaya, for honouring the son of Kunti, the city of Dwaraka, was well-adorned, even all the gardens and houses within it. The citizens of Dwaraka, desirous of beholding the son of Kunti, began to pour eagerly into the public throroughfares by hundreds of thousands. In the public squares and thoroughfares, hundreds and thousands of women, mixing with the men, swelled the great crowd of the Bhojas, the Vrishnis, and the Andhakas, that had collected there. Arjuna was welcomed with respect by all the sons of Bhojas, the Vrishnis, and the Andhakas. And he, in his turn, worshipped those that deserved his worship, receiving their blessings. The hero was welcomed with affec- tionate reception by all the young men of the Yadava tribe. He re- peatedly embraced all that were equal to him in age. Wending then to the delightful mansion of Krishna that was filled with gems and every article of enjoyment, he took up his abode there with Krishna for many days.\" Thus ends the two hundred and twentieth section in the Arjuna- vanavasa Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION CCXXI (Subhadra-harana Parva) Vaisampayana said,- \"O best of monarchs, within a few days after this, there commenced on the Raivataka mountain, a grand festival of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas. At the mountain festival of the Bhojas, the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, the heroes of those tribes began to give away much wealth unto Brahmanas by thousands. The region around that hill, O king, was adorned with many a mansion decked with gems and many an artificial tree of gaudy hue. The musicians struck up in concert and the dancers began to dance and the vocalists to sing. And the youths of the Vrishni race, endued with great energy, adorned with every ornament, and riding in their gold-decked cars, looked extremely handsome. The citizens, some on foot and some in excellent"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"ADI PAKVA 485 cars, with their wives and followers went there by hundreds and thou- sands- And there was the lord Haladhara (Valarama), roving at will, hilarious with drink, accompanied by (his wife) Revati, and followed by many musicians and vocalists. There came Utf rasena also, the power- ful king of the Vrishni race, accompanied by his thousand wives and followed by sweet singers. And Raukmineya and Shamva also, ever furious in battle, roved there, excited with drink and adorned with floral wreaths of great beauty and with costly attires, and disported themselves like a pair of celestials. And Akrura and Sarana and Gada, and Vabhru, and Nishatha, and Sharudeshna, and Prithu, Viprithu, and Satyaka, and Satyaki, and Bhangakara, and Maharava, and Hardi- kya, and Uddhava, and many others whose names are not given, accom- panied by their wives that followed by bands of singers, adorned that mountain-festival. When that delightful festival of immense grandeur commenced, V^sudeva and Partha went about, together, beholding everything around. While wandering there, they saw the handsome daughter of Vasudeva, Bhadra by name, decked with every ornament in the midst of her maids. As soon as Arjuna beheld her he was possessed by the god of desire. Then O Bharata, that tiger among men, Krishna, observing Partha contemplate her with absorbed attention, said with a smile, 'How is this ? Can the heart of one that rangeth the woods be agitated by the god of desire ? This is my sister, O Partha, and the uterine sister of Sarana. Blest be thou, her name is Bhadra and she is the favourite daughter of my father. Tell me if thy heart is fixed upon her, for I shall then speak to my father myself !' \"Arjuna answered, 'She is Vasudeva's daughter and V^sudeva's (Krishna) sister ; endued with so much beauty, whom can she not fasci- nate ? If this thy sister, this maid of the Vrishni race, becometh my wife, truly may I win prosperity in everything ! Tell me, O Janardana, by what means I may obtain her ! To get her I will achieve anything that is achievable by man !' \"V^sudeva answered, O bull amongst men, self-choice hath been ordained for the marriage of Ksbatriyas. But that is doubtful (in its consequences), O Partha, as we do not know this girl's tern per and dispo- sition. In the case of Kshatriyas that are brave, a forcible abduction for purposes of marriage is applauded, as the learned have said- Therefore, O Arjuna, carry away this my beautiful sister by force, for who knows what she may do at a self-choice. Then Krishna and Arjuna, having thus settled as to what should be done sent some speedy messengers unto Yudhishthira at Indraprastha, informing him of everything.

Meanwhile Subhadra, having paid her homage unto that prince of hills, viz^ Raivataka and having worshipped the deities and made the Brahmanas utter benedictions upon her, and having also walked round the hill, was coming towards Dwaravati. The son of Kunti, afflicted with the shafts of the god of desire, suddenly rushed towards that Yadava girl of faultless features and forcibly took her into his car. Having seized that girl of sweet smiles, that tiger among men proceeded in his car of gold towards his own city (Indraprastha)* Meanwhile, the armed attendants of Subhadra, beholding her thus seized and taken away, all ran, crying towards the city of Dwaraka. Reaching all together the Yadava court called by the name of Sudharma they represented everything about the prowess of Partha unto the chief officer of the court. The chief officer of the court, having heard every- thing from those messengers, blew his gold-decked trumpet of loud blare, calling all to arms. Stirred up by that sound, the Bhoja, the Vrishnis. and the Andhakas began to pour in from all sides. Those that were eating left their food, and those that were drinking left their drink. Those tigers among men, those great warriors of the Vrishni and the Andhaka tribes, took their seats upon their thousand thrones of gold covered with excellent carpets and variegated with gems and corals and possessed of the lustre of blazing fire.

The proud Vrishni heroes, of eyes red with wine, as soon as they heard of it, rose up from their seats, lunable to brook what Arjuna had done. Some amongst them said, 'Yoke our cars ; and some, 'Bring our weapons ; and some said, 'Bring our costly bows and strong coats of mail : and some loudly called upon their charioteers to harness their cars, and some, from impatience, themselves yoked their horses decked with gold unto their cars. And while their cars and armours and standards were being brought, loud became the uproar of those heroes. Then Valadeva, white and tall as the peak of Kailasa, decked with garlands of wild flowers and attired in blue robes, and proud and intoxicated with drink, said these words : 'Ye senseless men, what are ye doing, when Janardana sitteth silent ? Without knowing what is in his mind, vainly do we roar in wrath ! Let the high-souled Krishna give out what he proposeth. Accomplish promptly what he desireth to do !' Then all of them, hear- ing those words of Halayudha that deserved to be accepted, exclaimed, 'Excellent I* Excellent !' They then all became silent. Silence having been restored by the words of the intelligent Valadeva, they took their seats once more in that assembly. Then Rama, that oppressor of foes, spoke unto Vasudeva, saying. 'Why, O Janardana, sittest thou, gazing silently ? O Achyuta. it was for thy sake that the son of Pritha had been welcomed and honoured by us ! It seemeth, however, that vile wretch deserved not our homage ! What man is there born of a respectable family that would break the plate after having dined from it ! Even if one desireth to contact such an alliance, yet remembering all the services he hath received, who is there, desirous of happiness, that acts so rashly ? That Pandava disregarding us and thee too, hath to-day outraged Subhadra.^desiring (to compass) his own death ! He hath placed his foot on the crown of my head. How shall I, O Govinda, tamely bear it ? Shall I not resent it, even like a snake that is trodden upon ? Alone shall I to-day make the Earth destitute of Kauravas ! Never shall I put up with this transgression by Arjuna. 1 Then all the Bhojas, Vrishnis, and Andhakas, present there, approved of everything that Valadeva had said, deeply roaring like unto a kettle-drum or the clouds.\" Thus ends the two hundred and twenety-secomi section in the Subhadra-harana Parva of the Adi Parva."},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"SECTION CCXXIII ( Haranaharana Parva ) Vaisampayana said, \"When the heroes of the Vrishni race began to speak repeatedly in this strain, V^sudeva uttered these words preg- nant with deep import and consistent with true morality. Gudakesha (the conqueror of sleep or he of the curly hair), by what he hath done, hath not insulted our family. He hath without doubt, rather enhanced our respect. Partha knoweth that we of the Satwata race are never mercenary. The son of Pandu also regardeth a self-choice as doubtful in its results. Who also would approve of accepting a bride in gift as if she were an animal ? What man again is there on earth that would sell his offspring ? I think Arjuna, seeing these faults in all the other methods took the maiden away by force, according to the ordinance. This alliance is very proper. Subhadra is a renowned girl. Partha too possesseth renown. Perhaps, thinking of all this, Arjuna hath taken her away by force. Who is there that would not desire to have Arjuna for a friend, who is born in the race of Bharata and the renowned Santanu, and the son also of the daughter of Kuntibhoja ? I do not see, in all the worlds with Indra and the Rudras, the person that can by force vanquish Partha in battle, except the three-eyed god Maha- deva ! His car is well-known. Yoked thereunto are those steeds of mine. Partha as a warrior is well-known ; and his lightness of hand is well-known. Who shall be equal to him ? Even this is my opinion ; go ye cheerfully after Dhananjaya and by conciliation stop him and bring him back. If Partha goes to his city after having vanquished us by force, our fame will be gone. There is no disgrace, however, in conciliation.' Hearing, O monarch, those words of V^sudeva, they did as he directed. Stopped by them, Arjuna returned to Dwaraka and was united in marriage with Subhadra. Worshipped by the sons of Vrishni's race, Arjuna, sporting there as he pleased, passed a whole year in Dwaraka. The last year of his exile the exalted one passed at the sacred region of Pushkara. After the twelve years were complete he came back to Khandavaprastha. He approached the king first and then wor- shipped the Brahmanas with respectful attention. At last the hero went unto Draupadi. Draupadi, from jealousy, spoke unto him, saying 'Why tarriest thou here, O son of Kunti ? Go where the daughter of the Satwata race is ! A second tie always relaxeth the first one upon a faggot !

Kunti from excess of affection smelt the head of that girl of perfectly faultless features, and pronounc- ed infinite blessing upon her. Then that girl of face like the full moon hastily went unto Draupadi and worshipped her, saying, 'I am thy maid !' Krishna rose hastily and embraced the sister of Madhava from affection, and said, 'Let thy husband be without a foe ! Bhadra then, with a delighted heart, said unto Draupadi, 'So be it !' From that time, O Janamejaya, those great warriors, the Pandavas, began to live happily, and Kunti also became very happy.\" Vaisampayana continued, When that scorcher of foes, vi*., Kesava of pure soul and eyes, like lotus petals, heard that the foremost of the Pandavas, viz., Arjuna, had reached his own excellent city of Indra- prastha, he came thither accompanied by Rama and the other heroes and great warriors of the Vrishni and the Andhaka tribes, and by his brothers and sons and many other brave warriors. And Saurin came accompanied by a large army that protected him. And there came with Saurin, that oppressor of foes, viz., the exceedingly liberal Akrura of great intelli- gence and renown, the generalissimo of the brave Vrishni host. And there also came Anadhrishti of great prowess, and Uddava of great renown of great intelligence, of great soul, and a disciple of Vrihispati himself, in (mortals). And there also came Satyaka and Salyak and Kritavarman and Satwata ; and Pradyumna and Samva and Nishatbt and Sanku ; and Sharudeshna, and Jhilli of great prowess, and Viprithu also and Sarana of mighty arms and Gada the foremost of learned men. These and many other Vrishnis and Bhojas, and Andhakas came to Indraprastha, bringing with them many nuptial presents. King Yudhish- thira, hearing that Madhava had arrived, sent the twins out to receive him. Received by them, the Vrishni host of great prosperity entered Khandavaprastha well-adorned with flags and ensigns. The streets were well swept and watered and decked with floral wreaths and bunches. These were, again, sprinkled over with sandal-wood water that was fragrant and cooling. Every part of the town was filled with the sweet scent of burning aloes. And the city was full of joyous and healthy people and adorned with merchants and traders- That best of men, viz.* Keshava of mighty arms, accompanied by Rama and many of the Vrishnis, Andhakas and Bhojas, having entered the town, was worshipped by the citizens and Brahmanas by thousands.

Yudhishthira reverentially worshipped some as his superiors, and welcomed others as equals- And some he received with affection and by some he was worshipped with reverence. Then Hrishikesa of great renown gave unto the party of the bridegroom much wealth. And unto Subhadra he gave the nuptial presents that had been given to her by her relatives. Krishna gave unto the Panda vas a thousand cars of gold furnished with rows of bells, and unto each of which were put four steeds driven well- trained charioteers. He also gave unto them ten thousand cows belonging to the country of Mathura, and yielding much milk and all of excellent complexion. Well-pleased, Janardana also gave them a thousand mares with gold harnesses and of colour white as the beams of the moon. He also gave them a thousand mules, all well-trained and possessing the speed of the wind, of white colour with black manes. And he of eyes like lotus-petals also gave unto them a thousand damsels well-skilled in assisting at bathing and at drinking, young in years and virgins all before their first-season, well-attired and of excellent com- plexion, each wearing a hundred pieces of gold around her neck, of skins perfectly polished, decked with every ornament, and well-skilled in every kind of personal service. Janardana also gave unto them hundreds of thousands of draft horses from the country of the Valhikas as Subhadra *s excellent dower. That foremost one of Dasarha's race also gave unto Subhadra as her peculium ten carrier-loads of first class gold possessing the splendour of tire, some purified and some in a state of ore. And Rama having the plough for his weapon and always loving bravery gave unto Arjuna, as a nuptial present, a thousand elephants with secretions flowing in three streams from the three parts of their bodies (the temple, the ears, and the anus) each large as a mountain summit, irresistible in battle, decked with coverlets and ever-ring bells, well- adorned with other golden ornaments, and equipped with excellent thrones on their backs. And that large wave of wealth and gems that th Yadavas presented, together with the cloths and blankets that represented its foam, and the elephants its alligators and sharks, and the flagi its floating weeds, swelling into large proportions, mingled with the Pandu ocean and filled it to the brim, to the great sorrow of all foes.

Spending many days in sports and merriment there, and worshipped by the Kuru all the while, the Vrishni heroes endued with great energy then returned to the city of Dwaravati. And the great warriors of the Vrishni and the Andhaka races set out with Rama in the van, carrying with them those gems of the purest rays that had been given them by those foremost ones of Kuru's race. And, O Bharata, the high-souled Vasudeva remained there with Arjuna in the delightful city of Indraprastha. And the illustrious one wandered over the banks of the Yamuna in search of deer. And he sported with Arjuna piercing with his shafts deer and wild boars. Then Subhadra, the favourite sister of Kesava, gave birth to an illustrious son, like Puloma's daughter (the Queen of heaven) bringing forth Jayanta. And the son that Subhadra brought forth was of long arms, broad chest, and eyes as large as those of a bull. That hero and oppressor of foes came to be called Abhimanyu. And the son of Arjuna, that grinder of foes and bull among men, was called Abhimanyu because he was fearless and wrathful. And that great warrior was begotten upon the daughter of the Satwata race by Dhananjaya, like fire produced in a sacrifice from within the sami wood by the process of rubbing. Upon the birth of this child, Yudhishthira, the powerful son of Kunti, gave away unto Brahmanas ten thousand cows and coins of gold. The child from his earliest years became the favourite of Vasudeva and of his father and uncles, like the moon of all the people of the world. Upon his birth, Krishna performed the usual rites of infancy. The child began to grow up like the Moon of the bright fortnight. That grinder of foes soon became conversant with the Vcdas and acquired from his father the science of weapon both celestial and human, consisting of four branches and ten divisions. \"Endued with great strength, the child also acquired the knowledge of counteracting the weapons hurled at him by others, and great light- ness of band and fleetness of motion forward and backward and trans- verse and wheeling.

Partivindhya by Yudhishthira, Sutasoma by Vrikodora, Srutakarman by Arjuna, Satanika by Nakula, and Srutasena by Sahadeva, these were the five heroes and great warriors that Panchali brought forth, like Aditi bringing forth the Adityas. And the Brahmanas, from their fore knowledge, said unto Yudhishthira that, as the son of his would be capable of bearing like the Vindhya mountains the weapons of the foe, he should be called Prati- vindhya. And because the child that Draupadi bore to Bhimasena was born after Bhima had performed a thousand Soma sacrifices, he came to be called Sutasoma. And because Arjuna's son was born upon his return from exile during which he had achieved many celebrated feats, that child came to be called SrutaJcarman. While Nakula named his son Satanika after a royal sage of that name, in the illustrious race of Kuru. Again the son that Draupadi bore to Sahadeva was born under the constellation called Vahni-daivata (Kirtika), therefore was he called after the generalissimo of the celestial host, Srutasena (Kartikeya).

It seemed as if the three pursuits virtue, pleasure, and profit became personified on earthi and amongst them the king shone as a fourth. The subjects having obtained Yudhishthira as their king, obtained in their monarch one that was devoted to the study of the Vedas, one that was performer of the great sacrifices, and one that was protector of all good people. In consequence of Yudhisthira's influence, the good fortune of all the monarchs of the Earth became stationary, and their hearts became devoted to the meditation of the supreme Spirit, and virtue itself began to grow every way all round. And in the midst of and assisted by his four brothers, the king looked more resplendent (than he would have done if he were alone), like a great sacrifice depending upon and assisted by the four Vedas. Many learned Brahmanas with Dhananjaya at their head, each like unto Vrihaspati, waited upon the monarch, like the celestials waiting upon the Lord of the creation.

Those mansions and the woods, filled with the charming music of flutes and guitars and kettle-drumsi became the scene of Prosperity personified. \"When such was the state of things there, Arjuna and Vasudeva went to a certain charming spot ( in those woods ) not far from the place where the others were. O monarch, the high-souled Krishna, and that subjugators of hostile cities, viz., Arjuna, going thither, sat down upon two very costly seats. Vasudeva and Partha amused themselves there with discoursing upon many past achievements of prowess and other topics. Unto Vasudeva and Dhananjaya happily sitting there like twin Aswin in heaven, a certain Brahmana came. The Brahmana that came there looked like a tall Sala tree. His complexion was like unto molten gold ; his beard was bright yellow tinged with green ; and the height and the thickness of the body were in just proportion. Of matted locks and dressed in rags, he resembled the morning sun in splendour. Of eyes like lotus-petals and of a tawny hue, he seemed to be blazing with effulgence. Beholding that foremost of Brahmanas blazing with splendour approach towards them both Arjuna and Vasu- deva. hastily rising from their seats, stood, waiting (for his commands).\" Thus ends the two hundred and twenty-fourth section in the Khandava-daha Parva of the Adi Parva."},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"SECTION CCXXV ( Khandava.daha Parva continued ) Vaisampayana said, \"Then that Brahmana addressed Arjuna and Vasudeva of the Satwata race, saying, 'Ye who are now staying so nar unto Khandava are the two foremost of heroes on earth !

O thou of the Vrishni race, and O Partha, I solicit you to gratify me by giving me suffi- cient food :' Thus addressed by the Brahmana, Krishna and the son of Pandu answered him, saying, 'O tell us what kind of food will gratify thee, so that we may endeavour to give it thee !' The illustri- ous Brahmana, thus replied to, said unto those heroes who were en- quiring after the kind of food he sought, 'I do not desire to eat ordi- nary food.

When Agni consumed in wrath the forest of Khandava, it is evident there was a grave cause. I desire, O Brahmana, to hear all this in detail from thee ! Tell me, O sage, how the Khandava forest was consumed in days of yore !\" Vaisampayana said, \"O chief of men, I will narrate to the story of the conflagration of Khandava as told by Rishis in the Purana.

No one on earth has equalled him in sacrifices, charity, and intelligence. Swetaki performed the five great sacrifices and many others, at all of which the presents unto Brahmanas were large. The heart of that monarch, O king, was always set upon sacrifices, religious rites, and gifts of all kinds. And king Swetaki of great intelligence, assisted by his Rilwijas performed sacrifices for many long years, till those sacrifical priests with eyes afflicted by the continued smoke and becoming very weak, left that monarch, wishing never more to assist at his sacrifices. The king, how- ever, repeatedly asked those Ritwijas to come to him. But they came not to his sacrifice in consequence of the painful state of their eyes. The king, therefore, invited at the command of his own Rilwijas, others like unto them, and completed the sacrifice that he had begun. After some days had elapsed, king Swetaki desired to perform another sacri- fice which sould extend for a hundred years. But the illustrious monarch obtained not any priest to assist him in it. The celebrated king then, with his friends and relatives, casting off all sloth, repeated- ly courted his priests with great persistence, by bowing down unto them, by conciliatory speeches, and by gifts of wealth. All of them, however, refused to accomplish the purpose which that the king of immeasurable energy had in view. Then that royal sage, getting angry, addressed those Brahmanas sitting in their asylums, and said, If, ye Brahmanas, I were a fallen person, or, if I were wanting in homage and service to you, I should then deserve to be abandoned without scruple by you and by other Brahmanas at the same time ! But as I am neither degraded nor wanting in homage to you, it behoveth you not to obstruct the performance by me of my sacrifice or to abandon me thus, ye foremost of Brahmanas, without adequate reason ! I seek ye Brahmanas, your protection ! It behoveth you to be propitious unto me ! But, ye foremost of Brahmanas, if you abandon me from enmity alone or any improper motive, I shall go unto other priests for their assistance in this sacrifice of mine, and conciliating them by sweet words and gifts, I shall represent unto them the business I have on hand, so that they may accomplish it-' Having said this, the monarch became silent. And, O chastiser of foes when those priests well knew that they could not assist at the king's sacrifice, they pre- tended to be angry, and addressing that best of monarchs, said, 'O best of kings, thy sacrifices are incessant ! By assisting thee always, we have all been fatigued. And as we have been wearied in conse- quence of these labours, it behoveth thee to give us leave !

Hearing those"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"ADI PABVA 497 words of censure and wrath, king Swetaki became angry. And the monarch wending to the mountains of Kailasa, devoted himself to asce- ticism there. And, O king, the monarch began to worship Mahadeva, with fixed attention, and by observing the most rigid vows. And fore- going all food at times, he passed a long period. The monarch ate only fruits and roots sometimes at the twelfth and sometimes at the sixteenth hour of the whole day (of twenty four hours). King Swetaki stood for six months, rapt in attention, with arms upraised and steadfast eyes, like the trunk of a tree or a column rooted to the ground. And O Bharata, Sankara at last, gratified with that tiger among kings, who was undergoing such hard penances, showed himself unto him. And the god spake unto the monarch in a calm and grave tone, saying, O tiger among kings, O chastiser of foes, I have been gratified with thee for thy asceticism ! Blest be thou I Ask now the boon that thou, O king, desirest !'

King Swetaki, thus addressed by Rudra, did all that he was directed to do by the wielder of the trident. And after twelve years had elapsed, he again came unto Maheswara. And Sankara, the Creator of the worlds, upon seeing Swetaki, that excellent monarch, immediately said, in great gratification, 'I have been gratified by thee, of best of kings, with this thy own act 1 But, O chastiser of foes, the duty of assisting at sacrifices properly belongeth to Brahmanas.

Even that Brahmana endued with great energy will assist you in thy sacrifice. Let, therefore, every preparation be made I ' Hearing these words uttered by Rudra, the king, returning to his own capital, began to collect all that was necessary.

Then the sacrifice for which king Swetaki had made those preparations, took place. And the illustrious monarch's sacrifice was performed according to the ordi- nance and in proper season ! And the gifts, on that occasion, unto the Brahmanas were large. And after that monarch's sacrifice had come to an end, all the other priests who had come to assist at it went away with Durvasah's leave. All other Sadasyas ako of immeasurable energy, who had been installed at that sacrifice, then went away. That exalted monarch then entered his own palace, worshipped by exalted Brahmanas conversant with the Vedas, eulogised by chanters of panegyrical hymns and congratulated by the citizens. \"Such was the history of that best of monarchs, the royal sage Swetaki, who, when the time came, ascended to heaven, having won great renown on earth, and accompanied by the Ritwijas and theSadasyas that had helped him in life.\" Vaisampayana continued, At that sacrifice of Swetaki, Agni had drunk clarified butter for twelve years. Indeed, clarified butter had been poured into Agni's mouth in a continuous stream for that period, Having drunk so much butter, Agni, satiated, desired not to drink butter again from the hand of any body else at any other sacrifice. Agni became pale, having lost his colour, and he could not shine as before. He felt a loss of appetite from surfeit, and his energy itself became weakened and sickness afflicted him. Then when the drinker of sacri- ficial libations perceived that his energy was gradually diminishing, he went to the sacred abode of Brahman that is worshipped by all. Approa- ching the great Deity seated on his seat, Agni said, 'O exalted one, Swetaki hath (by his sacrifice) gratified me to excess. Even now I am suffering from surfeit which I cannot dispel. O Lord of the universe, I am being reduced both in splendour and strength !

Arrived there, he suddenly blazed forth in antler, assisted by Vayu. Beholding Khandava on fire the dwellers (in the forest) that were there, made great efforts to estinguish the conflagration. Elephants by hundreds of thousands, speeding in angen brought water in their trunks and scattered it upon the fire. Thousands of many hooJed snakes, mad with anger, hastily began to scatter upon the fire much water from those many hoods of theirs. And so, O bull of Btiarata's race, the other creatures dwelling in that forest, by various appliances and efforts, soon extinguished the fire. In this way, Agni blazed forth in Khandava repeatedly, even for seven times.

And it was always wor- shipped both by the celestials and the Qandharvaa. Varuna also gave (unto Arjuna) two inexhaustible quivers, and he also gave (unto Arjuna) a car furnished with celestial weapons and whose banner bore a large ape. Yoked unto that car were steeds white as silver of the fleecy clouds, and born in the region of the Oandharvas, and decked with golden harness, and resembling in fleetness the wind or the mind. And it was equipped with very implement of war, and was incapable of being vanquished by the celestials or the Asuras. Its splendour was great and the sounds of its wheels was tremendous. It delighted the heart of every creature that looked at it. It had been created by Viswakarman, the architect of the universe and one of the lords of creation, after severe ascetic meditation. Its splendour, like that of the sun, was so great that no one could gaze at it. It was the very car from which the lord Soma had vanquished the Danavas. Resplendent with beauty, it looked like an evening cloud reflecting the effulgence of the setting sun. It was furnished with an excellent flag-staff of golden colour and great beauty. And there sat upon that flag-staff a celestial ape of form fierce like that of a lion or a tiger. Stationed on high, the ape seemed bent upon burning everything it beheld. And upon the (other; flags were various creatures of large size, whose roars and yells caused the enemy's soldiers to faint. Then Arjuna, accountred in mail and armed with the sword, and his fingers cased in leathern gloves, walking round that excellent car adorned with numerous flags and bowing unto the gods, ascended it like a virtuous man riding in the celestial car that bears him to heaven. And taking up that celestial and first of bows created by Brahman of old and called Gandiva, Arjuna was filled with joy. And bowing unto Hutasana, Partha endued with great energy, took up the bow and stringed it forcibly. Those who heard the noise that was made while the mighty Pandava stringed that bow, quaked with fear. And having obtained that car and that bow, and the two inexhaustible quivers, the son of Kunti became glad and thought himself competent to assist at the task. And Pavaka then gave unto Krishna a Discus with an iron pole attach- ed to a hole in the centre. And it was a fiery weapon and became his favourite. Having obtained that weapon, Krishna also became equal to the task.

And the lord Varuna, after this, gave unto Krishna a mace, of name Kaumadaki, capable of slaying every Daitya and producing, when hurled, a roar like that of the thunder.

And, O bull of Bharata's race, surrounding that forest and catching it from all sides with a roar like that of the clouds, Agni made every creature within it tremble.

And while the forest was burning, hundreds and thousands of living creatures, uttering frightful yells, began to run about in all directions Some had particular limbs burnt, some were scorched with excessive heat, and some came out, and some ran about from fear. And some clasping their children and some their parents and brothers, died calmly without, from excess of affection, be- ing able to abandon these that were dear to them. And many there were who biting their nether lips rose upwards and soon fell whirling into the blazing elements below. And some were seen to roll on the ground with wings, eyes, and feet scorched and burnt. These creatures were all seen to perish there almost soon enough. The tanks and ponds within that forest, heated by the fire around, began to boil ; the fishes and the tortoises in them were all seen to perish. During that great slaughter of living creatures in that forest, the burning bodies of various animals looked as if fire itself had assumed many forms. The birds that took wings to escape from that conflagration were pierced by Arjuna with his shafts, and cut into pieces, they fell down into the burning ele- ment below. Pierced all over with Arjuna's shafts, tie birds dropped down into the burning forest, uttering loud cries. The denizens of the forest, struck with those shafts, began to roar and yell. The clamour they raised was like unto the frightful uproar heard during the churning of the ccean (in days of yore). The mighty flames of the blazing fire, reaching the firmament, caused great anxiety to the celestials themselves. Then all the illustrious dwellers in heaven went in a body unto him of a hundred sacrifices and thousand eyes, viz. t their chief that grinder of Asuraa. Approaching Indra, the celestial said, 'Why, O lord of im- mortals, doth Agni burn these creatures below ? Hath the time ccme for the destruction of the world ?'

And Arjuna of immeasurable soul soon covered the forest of Khandava with innumerable arrows like the moon covering the atmosphere with a thick fog. When the sky above that forest was thus covered with the arrows of Arjuna no living creature could then escape from below. And it so happened that while that forest was burning, Takshaka, the chief of the Nagas, was not there, having gone at that time to the field of Kurukshetra. But Aswasena, the mighty son of Takshaka, was there. He made great efforts to escape from that fire ; but confined by Arjuna' s shafts he succeeded not in finding a way. It was then that his mother, the daughter of a snake, determined to save him by swallowing him first. His mother first swallowed his head and then was swallowing his tail. And desirous of saving her son, the sea-snake rose (up from the Earth) while still employed in swallowing her son's tail* But Arjuna as soon as he beheld her escaping, severed her head from her body by means of a sharp and keen edged arrow. Indra saw all this, and desiring to save his friend's son, the weilder of the thunder bolt, by raising a violent wind, deprived Arjuna of consiousness.During those few moment, Aswasena succeeded in effecting his escape. Behold- ing that manifestation of the power of illusion, and deceived by that snake, Arjuna was much enraged. He forthwith cut every animal seeking to escape by the skies, into two, three, or more pieces. And Vibhatsu in anger, and Agni, and Vasudeva also, cursed the snake that had escaped so deceitfully, saying, Never shalt thou be famous !' And Jishnu, remembering the deception practised upon him, became angry, and covering the firmament with a cloud of arrows, sought to fight with him of a thousand eyes. The chief of the celestials also, seeing Arjuna in anger, sought to fight with him, and hurled him own fierce weapons, covering the wide expanse of the firmament. Then the winds, making a loud roar and agitating all the oceans, brought"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"ADI PABVA 606 together masses of clouds in the sky, charged with torrents of rain. Those masses of clouds began to vomit thunder and terrible flashes of lightning charged with the thunder-roar. Then Arjuna, possessing a knowledge of means, hurled the excellent weapon called Vayavya with proper mantras to dispel those clouds. With that weapon the energy and force of Indra's thunder-bolt and of those clouds were destroyed. And the torrents of rain with which those clouds were charged were all dried up, and the lightning that played amongst them was also destroyed. Within a moment the sky was cleared of dust and darkness, and a delicious, cool breeze began to blow and the disc of the sun re- sumed its normal state. Then the eater of clarified butter (Agni), glad because none could baffle him, assumed various forms, and sprinkled over with the fat exuded by the bodies of creatures, blazed forth with all his flames, filling the universe with his roar. Then numerous birds of the Garuda tribe bearing excellent feathers, beholding that the forest was protected by Krishna and Arjuna, descended filled with pride, from the upper skies, desirous of striking those heroes with their thunder- like wings, beaks and claws. Innumerable Nagaa also, with faces emitting fire descending from high, approached Arjuna, vomitting the most virulent poison all the while. Beholding them approach, Arjuna cut them into pieces by means of arrows steeped in the fire of his own wrath. Then those birds and snakes, deprived of life, fell into the burn- ing element below. And there came also, desirous of battle, innumerable Aauras with Qandharvas and Yakshaa and Rakshaaas and Nagaa sending forth terrific yells. Armed with machines vomitting from their throats (mouths ?) iron balls and bullets, and catapults for propelling huge stones, and rockets, they approached to strike Krishna and Partha, their energy and strength increased by wrath. But though they rained a perfect shower of weapons, Vibhatsu, addressing them reproachfully, struck off their heads with his own sharp arrows. That slayer of foes, Krishna, also, endued with great energy, made a great slaughter of the Daitya and the Danava hosts with his discus. Many Aauraa of immea- surable might, pierced with Krishna's arrows and smitten with the force of his discus, became motionless like waifs and strays stranded on the bank by the violence of the waves. Then Sakra the lord of the celes- tials, riding on his white elephant, rushed at those heroes, and taking up his thunder-bolt which could never go in vain, huiled it with great force. And the slayer of Asuras said unto the gods, These two are slain.' Beholding the fierce thunder-bolt about to be hurled by their chief, the celestials all took up their respective weapons.

Aryaman stalked about with a terrible bludgeon furnished with sharp spikes, and Mitra stood there with a discus sharp as a razor. And, O monarch, Pusha and Bhaga and Savitri, in wrath, rushed at Krishna and Partha with bows and scimitars in hand. And the Rudras and the Vasus, the mighty Maruts and the Viswadevas and the Sadhyas, all resplendent with tiieir own energy, these and many other celestials, armed with various weapons rushed against those exalted of men, Krishna and Partha, for smitting them down. Then were seen in that great conflict wonderful portents all around robbing every creature of his sense, and resembling those that appeared at the time of the universal dissolution. But Arjuna and Krishna, fearless and invincible in battle, beholding Sakra and the other celestials pre- pared for fight, calmly waited, bows in hands. Skilled in battle, those heroes in wrath assailed the advancing host of celestials with their own thunderlike arrows. The celestials repeatedly routed by Krishna and Arjuna, at last left the field of battle for fear and sought the protection of Indra. The Munis who were witnessing the battle from the skies, beholding the celestials defeated by Madhava and Arjuna, were filled with wonder. Sakra also repeatedly witnessing their prowess in battle, became exceedingly gratified, and once more rushed to the assault. The chastiser of Paka then caused a heavy shower of stones, desiring to ascertain the prowess of Arjuna who was able to draw the bow even with his left hand. Arjuna, in great wrath, dispelled with his arrows that thick shower. Then he of a hundred sacri- fices beholding that shower baffled, once more caused a thicker shower of stones. But the son of the chastiser of Paka, (viz., Arjuna) gratified his father by baffling that shower also with his swift arrows. Then Sakra, desirous of smiting down the son of Pandu, tore up with his hands a large peak from Mandara, with tall trees on it, and hurled it against him. But Arjuna divided that mountain peak into a thousand pieces by his swift-going and fire-mouthed arrows. The fragments of that mountain, in falling through the skies, looked as if the sun and the moon and the planets, displaced from their positions fell down on earth. That huge peak fell down upon that forest and by its fall killed numerous living creatures that dwelt in Khnadava.\" Thus ends the two hundred and twenty-nineth section in the Khandava-daha Parva of the Adi Parva,"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"SECTION CCXXX i Khandava.daha Parva continued ) Vaisampayana said, 'Then the inhabitants of the forest of Khan- dava, the Danava* and Rakshasas and Nagas and wolves and bears and other wild animals, and elephants with rent temples, and tigers, and lions with manes and deer an 1 buffaloes by hundreds, and birds, and various other creatures, frightened at the falling stones and extremely anxious, began to fly in all directions. They saw the forest (burning all around) and Krishna and Arjuni also ready with their weapons. Frightened at the terrible sounds that were audible there those crea- tures lost their power of movement. Beholding the forest burning in innumerable places and Krishna also ready to smite them down with his weapons, they all set up a frightful roar. With that terrible clamour as also with the roar of fire, the whole welkin resounded, as it were, with the voice of portentous clouds. The Keshava of dark hue and mighty arms, in order to compass their destruction, hurled at them his large and fierce discus resplendent with its own energy. The forest-dwellers including the Danavaa and the Rakahasas, afflicted by that weapon, were cut into hundreds of pieces and fell unto the mouth of Agni. Mangled by Krishna's discus, the Asuras were besmeared with blood and fat and looked like evening clouds. And, O Bharata, he of the Vrishni race moved about like death itself, slaying Pisachas and birds and Nagas and other creatures by thousands. The discus itself, repeatedly hurled from the hands of Krishna, that slayer of all foes, came back to his hands after slaughtering numberless creatures. The face and form of Krishna, that soul of every created thing became fierce to behold while he was thus employed in the slaughter of the Pisachas, Nagas and Rakshotat. No one among the celestials, who had mustered there could vanquish in battle Krishna and Arjuna. When the celestials saw that they could not protect that forest from the might of Krishna and Arjuna by extin- guishing that conflagration, they retired from the scene. Then, O monarch, he of a hundred sacrifices (Indra), beholding the immortals retreat, became filled with joy and applauded Krishna and Arjuna. And when the celestials gave up the fight, an incorporeal voice, deep and loud, addressing him of a hundred sacrifices, said, \"Thy friend Takshaka, that chief of snakes, hath not been slain !

Therefore, O Vasava, it behoveth thee to go hence with all the celestials ! The destruction of Khandava hath been ordained by Fate !\" Then the chief of the immortals, ascertaining those words to be true abandoned his wrath and jealousy, and went back to heaven. The dwellers in heaven, O monarch, beholding the illustrious Indra abandon the fight, followed him with all their soldiers, Then those heroes, Vasudeva and Arjuna, when they saw the chief of the celestials retreat accompanied by all the gods, set up a leonine roar. And, O monarch, Kesava and Arjuna, after Indra had left the scene, became exceedingly glad. Those heroes then fearlessly assisted at the conflagration of the forest. Arjuna scattered the celestials like the wind scattering the clouds, and slew with showers of his arrows, numberless creatures that dwelt in Khandava. Cut off by Arjuna's arrows, no one amongst the innumerable creatures could escape from the burning forest. Far from fighting with him, none amongst even the strongest creatures mustered there could look at Arjuna whose weapons were never futile. Some- times piercing hundred creatures with one shaft and sometimes a single creature with hundred shafts, Arjuna moved about in his car. The creatures themselves, deprived of life, began to fall into the mouth of Agni (god of fire), struck down as it were by death itself. On the banks of rivers or on uneven plains or on crematoriums, go where they did, the creatures (dwelling in Khandava) found no ease, for, wherever they sought shelter there they were afflicted by the heat. And hosts of creatures roared in pain, and elephants and deer and wolves set up cries of affliction. At that sound the fishes of the Ganges and the sea, and the various tribes of Vidyadharas dwelling in that forest all became frightened. O thou of mighty arms, let alone battling with them, no one could even gaze at Arjuna and Janardana of dark hue. Hari slew with his discus those Rakshasas and Danavas and Nagas that rushed at him in bands. Of huge bodies, their heads and trunks were cut off by the swift motion of the discus, and deprived of life they fell down into the blazing fire. Gratified with large quantities of flesh, blood, and fat, the flames rose up to a great height without a curling wreath of smoke.

Gratified greatly, Agni derived much happiness. \"And it so happened that the slayer of Madhu suddenly beheld an Asura of the name of Maya escaping from the abode of Takshaka. Agni having Vavu for his car-driver, assuming a body with matted locks on head, and roaring like the clouds, pursued the Asura, desirous of con- suming him. Beholding the Asura, Vasudeva stood with his weapon upraised, ready to smite him down, seeing the discus uplifted and Agni pursuing from behind to burn him, Maya said, 'Run to me, O Arjuna, and protect me !' Hearing his affrighted voice Arjuna said, 'Fear not !' That voice of Arjuna, O Bharata seemed to give Maya his life. As the merciful son of Pritha said unto Maya that there was nothing to fear, he of the Dasarha race no longer desired to slay Maya who was the brother of Mamuchi, and Agni also burned him not.\" Vaisampayana continued, 'Protected from Indra by Krishna and Partha, Agni, gifted with great intelligence, burned that forest for five and ten days. And while the forest burned Agni spared only six of its dwellersi viz-, Aswasena, Maya, and four birds called Sarngakas\" Thus ends the two hundred and thirtieth section in the Khandava- daha Parva of the Adi Parva. SECTION CCXXXI ( Khandava-daha Parva continued ) Janmejaya said, 'O Brahmana, tell me why and when that forest burnt in that wayi Agni consumed not the birds called Sarngakas ? Thou hast, O Brahmana, recited (to us) the cause of Aswasena and the Danava Maya not having been consumed. But thou hast not as yet said what the cause was of the escape of the Sarngakas ? The escape of those birds, O Brahmana, appeareth to me to be wonderful. Tell us why they were not destroyed in that dreadful conflagration ?' Vaisampayana said, \"O slayer of all foes, I shall tell thee all as to why Agni did not burn up those birds during conflagration. There was, O king, a great Rishi known by the name of Mandapala, conversant with all the shastras, of rigid vows, devoted to asceticism, and the fore- most of all virtuous persons. Following in the wake of Rishis that had drawn up their virile fluid, that ascetic, O monarch, with every sense under complete control, devoted himself to study and virtue.

Without doubt, it is for religious rites, studies according to the ordinance, and progeny, that men are born debtors* These debts are all discharged by sacrifices, asceticism, and offspring. Thou art an ascetic and hast also performed sacrifices ; but thou hast no offspring. These regions are shut against thee only for want of children. Beget children, therefore ! Thou shalt then enjoy multifarions regions of felicity ! The Vedas declared that the son rescueth the father from a hell called Put- Then, O best of Brahmanas, strive to beget offspring.\" Vaisampayana continued, \"Mandapala, having heard these words of the dwellers in heaven, reflected how best he could obtain the largest number of offspring within the shortest period of time. The Rishi, after reflection, understood that of all creatures birds alone were blest with fecundity. Assuming the form of a Sarngaka the Rishi had connection with a female bird of the same species called by the name of Jarita. And he begat upon her four sons who were all reciters of the Vedas* Leaving all those sons of his with their mother in that forest, while they were still within eggs, the ascetic went to (another wife called by the name of) Lapita. And, O Bharata, when the exalted sage went away for the company of Lapita, moved by affection for her offspring, Jarita became very thoughtful. Though forsaken by their father in the forest of Khandava, Jarita, anxious in her affection for them, could not forsake her offspring, those infant Rishis encased in eggs. Moved by parental affection, she brought up these children born of her, herself following the pursuits proper to her own species. Some time after, the Rishis, in wandering over that forest in the company of Lapita, saw Agni coming towards Khandava to burn it down. Then the Brahmana Mandapala, knowing the intention of Agni and remembering also that his children were all young moved by fear, gratified the god, of the burn- ing element, that regent of the universe, endued with great energy. And he did this, desiring to put in a word for his unfledged offspring. Addressing Agni, the Rishi said, Thou art, O Agni, the mouth of all the worlds !

Vaisampayana continued, 'O monarch, thus panegyrised by Mandapala, Agni was gratified with that Rishi of immeasurable energy ; and the god, well-pleased, replied What good can I do to thee ?' Then Mandapala with joined hands said unto the carrier of clarified butter, 4 While thou burnest the forest of Khandava, spare my children.' The illustrious bearer of clarified butter replied, 'So be it.' It was, there- fore, O monarch, that he blazed not forth, while consuming the forest of Khandava, for the destruction of Mandapala's children.'
