and that man was whole−hearted and upright, and one that feared God, and shunned evil. 1:2 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. 1:3 His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she−asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east. 1:4 And his sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. 1:5 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt−offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said: 'It may be that my sons have sinned, and blasphemed God in their hearts.' Thus did Job continually. 1:6 Now it fell upon a day, that the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them. 1:7 And the Lord said unto Satan: 'Whence comest thou?' Then Satan answered the Lord, and said: 'From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.' 1:8 And the Lord said unto Satan: 'Hast thou considered My servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a whole−hearted and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil?' 1:9 Then Satan answered the Lord, and said: 'Doth Job fear God for nought? 2"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"1:10 Hast not Thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side?

So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord. 1:13 And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house, 1:14 that there came a messenger unto Job, and said: 'The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them; 1:15 and the Sabeans made a raid, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.' 1:16 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said: 'A fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.' 1:17 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said: 'The Chaldeans set themselves in three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.' 1:18 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said: 'Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house; 1:19 Job − Chapter 001 3"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"And, behold, there came a great wind from across the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.' 1:20 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped; 1:21 And he said; naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither; the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord. 1:22 For all this Job sinned not, nor ascribed aught unseemly to God. −− Job − Chapter 001 −− Job − Chapter 001 4"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Job − Chapter 002 2:1 Again it fell upon a day, that the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord. 2:2 And the Lord said unto Satan: 'From whence comest thou?'
