A Psalm of David. The fool hath said in his heart: 'There is no God'; they have dealt corruptly, they have done abominably; there is none that doeth good. 14:2 the Lord looked forth from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any man of understanding, that did seek after God. 14:3 They are all corrupt, they are together become impure; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. 14:4 'Shall not all the workers of iniquity know it, who eat up My people as they eat bread, and call not upon the Lord?' 14:5 There are they in great fear; for God is with the righteous generation. 14:6 Ye would put to shame the counsel of the poor, but the Lord is his refuge. 14:7 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!
