Now follows the detailed explanation of the syllable: 2 The essence of all these beings is the earth; the essence of the earth is water; the essence of water is plants; the essence of plants is a person; essence of a person is speech; the essence of speech is the Rig−Veda; essence of the Rig−Veda is the Sama−Veda; the essence of the Sama−Veda is the Udgitha which is Om. 3 That Udgitha (Om) is the best of all essences, the supreme, deserving the highest place, the eighth. 4 What, then, is the Rik? What is the Saman? What is the Udgitha? This is to be considered. 5 Speech, indeed, is the Rik; the vital breath (prana) is the Saman; the syllable Om is the Udgitha. Speech and the prana, or the Rik and the Saman, form a couple. 6 And that couple become united in the syllable Om. When a pair come together they fulfil each other’s desire. 7 He who knows this as stated above and meditates on the syllable Om, the Udgitha, becomes, indeed, a fulfiller of desires. 8 This syllable Om is used to give assent, for wherever one assents to something, one says Om (yes). Now, what is assent is gratification. He who knows this and meditates on the syllable Om, the Udgitha, becomes, indeed, a gratifier of desires. 9 By means of this syllable the threefold knowledge proceeds. When adhvaryu priest gives an order in a sacrifice, he says Om. When the hotri priest recites the hymn, he says Om. When the udgatri priest sings the Saman, he says Om. All this is done for the glory of the Imperishable Atman by the greatness of that syllable and by its essence. 10 It may be contended that he who knows this true meaning of the syllable Om and he who 2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"does not, perform the same sacrifice and therefore must reap the same fruit. But this is not so. The results of knowledge and ignorance are different. Work that is done with knowledge, faith and the Upanishad (i.e. meditation on the deities) produces more powerful fruit. This is, verily, the detailed explanation of the syllable Om. Chapter II − Meditation on Om as the Prana 1 When the gods and the demons, both offspring of Prajapati, fought with each other, the gods took hold of the Udgitha, thinking that with this they would vanquish the demons. 2 They (i.e. the gods) meditated on the Udgitha (Om) as the prana which functions through the nose. But the demons pierced it (i.e. the prana) with evil. Therefore with it (i.e. the breath) one smells both what is pleasant−smelling and what is foul−smelling. For the breath is pierced by evil. 3 Then they meditated on the Udgitha as speech. But the demons pierced it with evil. Therefore one speaks both truth and falsehood. For speech is pierced by evil. 4 Then they meditated on the Udgitha as the eye. But the demons pierced it with evil. Therefore one sees both what is sightly and what is unsightly. For the eye is pierced by evil. 5 Then they meditated on the Udgitha as the ear. But the demons pierced it with evil. Therefore one hears both what is worth hearing and what is not worth hearing. For the ear is pierced by evil. 6 Then they meditated on the Udgitha as the mind. But the demons pierced it with evil. Therefore one thinks both proper and improper thoughts. For the mind is pierced by evil. 7 Then they meditated on the Udgitha as the principal (mukhya) prana. But as a clod of earth hitting a stone is scattered, even so the demons were destroyed when they hit it. 8 As a clod of earth is scattered when hitting a stone, thus will he be scattered who wishes evil to one who knows this or who injures him; for he is a solid stone. 9 With this (i.e. the principal vital breath) one does not discern what pleasant−smelling and what is foul−smelling; for it is unsmitten by evil. Whatever a person eats or drinks with it (the principal vital breath) supports the other pranas. That is why they depart when, at the time death, it no longer supports them by eating and drinking. It opens the mouth at the Part 1 3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"time of death as if the dying man wished to eat. 10−13 Angira meditated on the Udgitha as the principal prana. people call it (i.e. the prana) Angiras, because it is the essence (rasa) of the limbs (anga). Brihaspati meditated on the Udgitha as the principal prana. People call it (the prana) Brihaspati, because speech is great (brihat) and it is the lord (pati) of speech. Ayasya meditated on the Udgitha as the principal prana. People call it (the prana) as Ayasya; because it comes (ayate) from the mouth (asya). Vaka, the son of Dalbhya, knew it (the prana); he became the udgatri priest of the sacrificers dwelling in the Naimisha forest. By singing the Udgitha he fulfilled all their desires. 14 He who knows this as described above and meditates upon the imperishable Udgitha (Om) obtains all his desires by singing the Udgitha. So much for the Udgitha as meditates on with reference to the body. Chapter III − Meditation on the Udgitha as the Sun and the Vyana 1 Now is described the meditation on the Udgitha with reference to the gods: One should meditate on the Udgitha as the sun who gives warmth. When he (the sun) rises he sings the Udgitha for the benefit of all creatures. When he rises he destroys darkness and fear. He who knows this becomes the destroyer of darkness and fear. 2 This prana and that sun are the same. This is warm and that is warm. This they call svara (what goes out) and that, pratyasvara (what returns). Therefore one should meditate on the Udgitha as this and that. 3 One should meditate on the Udgitha as the vyana. That which one breathes out is the prana and that which one breathes in is the apana. That which is the junction of the prana and the apana is the Vyana. This vyana is speech. Therefore when one utters speech one stops the prana and the apana. 4 That which is speech is the Rik. Therefore when a man utters a Rik he neither breathes out nor breathes in. That which is the Rik is the Saman. Therefore when a man sings a Saman, he neither breathes out nor breathes in. That which is the Saman is the Udgitha. Therefore when a man sings the Udgitha he neither breathes out nor breathes in. 5 And other works also which require strength, such as the kindling of fire by rubbing, running a race and stringing a strong bow, are performed without breathing out or breathing in. Therefore one should meditate on the Udgitha as the vyana. Part 1 4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"6 One should meditate on the letters of the word Udgitha (i.e. ut, gi and tha). Ut is the prana, for a man rises (uttishthati) by means of the prana. Gi is speech, for speeches are called girah. Tha is food, for all this subsists (sthita) on food. 7 Ut is heaven, gi the mid−region and tha the earth. Ut is the sun, gi the air and tha fire. Ut is the Sama−Veda, gi the Yajur−Veda and tha the Rig−Veda. To him who thus meditates speech yields milk and milk is speech. He who knows this and meditates on the letters of the Udgitha becomes the possessor of food and the eater of food. 8 Next follows the fulfilment of prayers. One should thus meditate on the object one wishes to obtain through meditation: he (i.e. the udgatri priest) should meditate on the Saman with which he is going chant the praise. 9 He (the udgatri priest) should meditate on the Rik in which that Saman occurs, on the rishi to whom it was revealed and on the deity whom he is going to praise. 10 He (the udgatri priest) should meditate on the metre in which he is going to chant the praise; he should meditate on the hymn by which he is going to chant the praise. 11 He (the udgatri priest) should meditate on the quarter of space facing which he is going to chant the praise. 12 Finally, he (the udgatri priest) should meditate on himself and then on the object desired and chant the praise correctly. Thus will be quickly fulfilled for him the desire, desiring which he may offer the hymn of praise, yea, desiring which he may offer the hymn of praise. Chapter IV − Meditation on Om as Fearlessness and Immortality 1 The syllable Om, called the Udgitha, should be meditated upon; for people sing the Udgitha, beginning with Om. Now follows the detailed explanation of this syllable. 2 The gods, afraid of death, entered upon the threefold knowledge. They covered themselves with the metrical hymns. Because they covered (acchadayan) themselves with the hymns, the hymns are called chhandas. 3 As a fisherman might observe a fish in shallow water, so death observed the gods in the Rik, the Yajus and the Saman. They too came to know this, rose from the Rik, the Yajus Part 1 5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"and the Saman and entered the Svara (Om) alone. 4 When a man has mastered the Rig−Veda he loudly utters Om; he does the same when he has mastered the Sama−Veda and the Yajur−Veda. The Svara is the syllable Om; it is immortal and fearless. The gods, by entering it, became immortal and fearless. 5 He who, knowing this, sings the praise of the syllable Om enters this same syllable, called the Svara, which is immortal and fearless. Having entered it, he becomes immortal as the gods are immortal. Chapter V − Meditation on Om as the Sun and the Prana 1 Now, verily, that which is the Udgitha is the Pranava; that which is the Pranava is the Udgitha. Yonder sun is the Udgitha. It is the Pranava, because it moves along uttering Om. 2 Kaushitaki in olden times said to his son: \"I sang the praise of the sun regarding it as one with its rays; therefore you are my only son. Meditate on the rays and the sun as different from each another and you will have many sons.\" So much with reference to the gods. 3 Now with reference to the body: One should meditate on the Udgitha as the principal prana, for (i.e. the prana) moves in the body uttering Om. 4 Kaushitaki in olden times said to his son: \"I sang the praise of the principal prana alone; therefore you are my only son. Meditate on the Udgitha as the manifold prana and you will have many sons.\" 5 Now, verily, that which is the Udgitha is the Pranava; that which is the Pranava is the Udgitha. He (i.e. the udgatri priest) who knows this, rectifies from the seat of the hotri priest any mistake committed by him (the udgatri priest), yea he rectifies it. Chapter VI − The Luminous Person in the Solar Orb 1 This earth is the Rik and fire is the Saman. This Saman (i.e. fire) rests on that Rik (i.e. the earth). Therefore the Saman is sung resting on the Rik. Sa is the earth, ama is fire; thus they (the earth and fire) are designated as Sama. 2 The mid−region is the Rik and the air is the Saman. This Saman (i.e. the air) rests on that Part 1 6"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Rik (i.e. the mid−region). Therefore the Saman is sung, resting on the Rik. Sa is the mid−region, ama is the air; thus they (the mid−region and the air) are designated as Sama. 4 The stars are the Rik and the moon is the Saman. This Saman (i.e. the moon) rests on that Rik (i.e. the stars). Therefore the Saman is sung, resting on the Rik. Sa is the stars, ama is the moon; thus they (the stars and the moon) are designated as Sama. 5 Now, the white radiance of the sun is the Rik and its blue intense darkness is the Saman. This Saman (i.e. the darkness) rests on that Rik (i.e. the radiance). Therefore the Saman is sung, resting on the Rik. 6−7 Sa is the white radiance of the sun, ama is its blue intense darkness; thus they (the radiance and the darkness) are designated as Sama. Now, the golden person who is seen in the sun, who has a golden beard and golden hair, who is golden to the very tips of his nails−his eyes are like a lotus flower, red as the rump of a monkey. His name is Ut, for he has risen (udita) above all evil. He, too, who knows this rises above all evil. Chapter VII − The Person in the Eye 1 Now with reference to the body: Speech is the Rik and the prana is the Saman. This Saman (the prana) rests on that Rik (speech). Therefore the Saman is sung, resting on the Rik. Sa is speech, ama is the prana; thus they (speech and the prana) are designated as Sama. 2 The eye is the Rik and the atman is the Saman. This Saman (the atman) rests on that Rik (speech). Therefore the Saman is sung, resting on the Rik. Sa is the eye, ama is the atman; thus they (the eye and the atman) are designated as Saman. 3 The ear is the Rik and the mind is the Saman. This Saman (the mind) rests on that Rik (the ear). Therefore the Saman is sung, resting on the Rik. Sa is the ear, ama is the mind; thus they (the ear and the mind) are designated as Sama. 4 Now, the white radiance of the eye is the Rik and its blue intense darkness is the Saman. This Saman (darkness) rests on that Rik (radiance). Therefore the Saman is sung, resting on the Rik. Sa is the white radiance of the eye, ama is its blue intense darkness; thus they (the radiance and the darkness) are designated as Sama. 5 Now, the person who is seen in the eye is the Rik, he is the Saman, he is the Uktha, he is Part 1 7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"the Yajus, he is Brahman. The form of this person in the eye is the same as the form of that person in the sun. The joints this person in the eye are the same as the joints of that person in the sun; the name of this one (Ut) is the same as the name of that one. 6 He is the lord of the worlds which spread beneath that (i.e. the eye) and also of all the wishes of men. Therefore all who sing to the vina sing of him and from him they obtain wealth. 7 He who, knowing this (i.e. the Udgitha), sings the Saman, sings both. Through that (i.e. the person in the sun) he obtains the world beyond that (i.e. the sun) and the wishes of the gods. 8−9 Likewise, through this (i.e. the person in the eye), he obtains the worlds that spread beneath that (i.e. the eye) and all the wishes of men. Therefore an udgatri priest who knows this may say to the sacrificer for whom he acts as priest: \"What desire of yours shall I fulfil by singing?\" For he who, knowing this, sings the Saman is able to fulfil wishes through his singing of the Saman, yea, through his singing of the Saman. Chapter VIII − The Story of the Pravahana (I) 1 There were three men versed in the Udgitha: Silaka the son of Salavat, Chaikitayana of the line of Dalbhya and Pravahana the son of Jivala. They said: \"We are indeed versed in the Udgitha. Let us have a discussion of the Udgitha.\" 2 \"Let it be so,\" they said and sat down. Then Pravihana the son Jivala said: \"Revered Sirs, you speak first and I shall listen to what the two brahmins have to say.\" 3 Then Silaka the son of Salavat said to Chaikitayana of the line Dalbhya: \"Well, may I question you?\" \"Do ask,\" he said. 4−5 \"What is the support of the Saman?\" \"Tone (svara),\" he replied. \"What is the support of tone?\" \"The prana (vital breath),\" he replied. \"What is the support of the prana?\" \"Food,\" he replied. \"What is the support of food?\" \"Water,\" he replied. \"What is the support of water?\" Part 1 8"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"\"Yonder world (heaven),\" he replied. \"What is the support of yonder world?\" \"Let no one carry the Saman beyond the heavenly world. We place the Saman in the heavenly world, for the Saman is praised as heaven.\" 6 Then Silaka the son of Salavat said to Chaikitayana of the line of Dalbhya: \"O Dalbhya your Saman is not firmly established. If at this time anyone who knew the support of the Saman were to say: ‘Your head shall fall off;’ surely your head would fall off.\" 7 \"Well then, revered Sir, let me learn it from you,\" said Chaikitayana. \"Learn it,\" replied Silaka. \"What is the support of that world?\" \"This world,\" he replied. \"What is the support of this world?\" \"Let no one carry the Saman beyond this world, which is its support. We place the Saman in this world as its support, for the Saman is praised as the support (i.e. this world).\" 8 Then said Pravahana the son of Jivala: O son of Salavat, your Saman (i.e. this earth) has an end. If at this time anyone who knew the support of the Saman were to say: ‘Your head shall fall off,’ surely your head would fall off.\" \"Well then, let me learn this from you, revered Sir,\" said Silaka. \"Learn it,\" said Pravahana. Chapter IX − The Story of Pravahana (II) 1 \"What is the support of this world?\" asked Silaka. \"The akasa,\" said Pravahana. \"For all these beings are created from the akasa and return to the akasa. The akasa is greater than these; therefore the akasa is the supreme support.\" 2 This is the Udgitha (Om), the most excellent; this is endless. He who, knowing this, meditates on the Udgitha obtains the most excellent life and wins the most excellent worlds. 3−4 Atidhanvan the son of Sunaka, having taught this Udgitha to Udarasandilya, said: \"As long as any of your descendants know this Udgitha, their life shall be the most excellent in this world and likewise in the other world.\" He who thus knows the Udgitha and meditates on it−his life shall be the most excellent in this world and likewise in the other world, yea, the other world.

He (the owner of the elephant) said: \"I have nothing but what is set before me.\" 3 Ushasti said: \"Give me these.\" He gave the beans and said: \"Here is some water left over from my drinking.\" Ushasti said: \"If I drink this, I will then be drinking what has been left by another.\" 4 The owner of the elephant said: \"Were not those beans also left over and therefore unclean?\" Ushasti replied: \"I should not have lived if I had not eaten them; but I can get water wherever I like.\" 5 Having himself eaten, Ushasti gave his wife what was left. But she, having eaten before, took them (i.e. the beans) and put them away. 6 Next morning, on awaking, he said: \"Alas, if I could get even little a to eat, I might earn some money. The king over here is going to perform a sacrifice; he would choose me for all the priestly offices.\" 7 His wife said to him: \"Here, my husband, are the beans.\" After eating them, he went to the sacrifice that was about to be performed. 8 He saw there the assembled udgatri priests and sat near them in place where they would sing the hymns. He said to the prastotri priest: 9 \"O prastotri priest, if without knowing the deity that belongs to Prastiva, you sing the Prastiva, your head will fall off\" 10−11 In the same manner he addressed the udgatri priest: \"O udgatri priest, if without knowing the deity that belongs to the Udgitha, you sing the Udgitha, your head will fall off.\" In the same manner he addressed the pratihartri priest: \"O pratihartri priest, if without knowing the deity that belongs to the Pratihara, you sing the Pratihara, your head will fall off.\" They all stopped performing their duties and sat in silence.

Chapter X − Meditation on the Sevenfold Saman through the Number of Syllables 1 Next one should meditate on the sevenfold Saman which has a uniform number of syllables and which leads beyond death: The word Himkara has three syllables, the word Prastava has three syllables.

If we take one syllable from Pratihara and join to Adi, they become equal (sama). 3−4 The word Udgitha has three syllables and the word Upadrava has four syllables. With three and three syllables they should be equal. One syllable being left out, it becomes trisyllabic. Hence the equality (sama). The word Nidhana has three syllables; therefore it is equal. These make twenty−two syllables of the sevenfold Saman. 5 With twenty−one syllables he reaches the sun; for the sun is the twenty−first from here. With the twenty−second he conquers what is beyond the sun; that plane is blessed and free from grief. 6 He obtains here victory over the sun (death); and to him comes victory higher than the victory over the sun who, knowing this, meditates on the sevenfold Saman which has a uniform number syllables and which leads beyond death, yea, who meditates upon the sevenfold Saman.

Chapter XXII − The different notes employed in the Chanting of the Saman 1 An Udgatri priest thinks thus: \"I choose the deep−sounding note of the Saman, which is good for the cattle and which belongs to fire (Agni). The undefined note belongs to Prajapati, the defined note to Soma (the moon), the soft and smooth note to Vayu (the air), the smooth and strong note to Indra, the heron−like note to Brihaspati and dull note to Varuna.\" Let a man cultivate all these, avoiding, however, the note of Varuna. 2 A man should sing, wishing that by his song he may secure immortality for the gods: \"May I obtain by my song oblations (svadha) for the Manes, hope for men, grass and water for Part 2 19"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"cattle, heaven for the sacrificer and food for myself.\" Thus reflecting on all these in his mind, he (the udgatri priest) should chant the praises without making mistakes in pronunciation etc. 3 All vowels belong to the different parts of Indra's body, all sibilants to Prajapati, all consonants to Mrityu (death). If someone should reprove him (i.e. the udgatri priest who knows this) regarding the pronunciation of vowels, let him say: \"I went to Indra for my refuge when pronouncing my vowels. He will answer you.\" 4 And if someone should reprove him for his sibilants, let him say: \"I went to Prajapati for my refuge. He will smash you.\" And if someone should reprove him for his consonants, let him say\" I went to Mrityu for my refuge. He will burn you to ashes.\" 5 All vowels should be pronounced with resonance and strength and with the thought on the part of the singer: \"May I impart strength to Indra (the prana).\" All the sibilants should be pronounced full−without being swallowed or thrown out and with the thought: \"May I give myself to Prajapati.\" All consonants should be pronounced slowly and without mixing them with the others and with the thought: \"May I withdraw myself from death.\" Chapter XXIII − Praise of Om Unassociated with any Ritual 1 There are three divisions of dharma: Sacrifice, study and charity form the first. Austerity is the second. Dwelling in the house of the teacher as a brahmacharin, always mortifying the body in the house of the teacher, is the third. All those who practise these dharmas attain the worlds of the virtuous. But one who is established in Brahman obtains Immortality. 2 Prajapati brooded on the worlds. From them, thus brooded upon, there was revealed in his heart the threefold knowledge. He brooded on it and from it, thus brooded upon, there issued forth these syllables: Bhuh, Bhuvah and Svah. 3 He brooded on them (the three syllables) and from them, thus brooded upon, there issued forth Om. As all leaves are held together by a midrib, so is all speech held together by Om (brahman). Om is all thus, yea, On is all this. Chapter XXIV − The Different Planes attained by the Sacrificer 1−2 The expounders of Brahman (i.e. the Vedas) ask: \"Since the morning oblation belongs to the Vasus, the midday oblation to the Rudras and the third (i.e. evening) oblation to the Adityas and the Visve−devas, \"Where, then, is the world of the sacrificer?\" He who does not know this, how can he Part 2 20"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"perform the sacrifice?

Open the door of the heaven−world. Let us see thee, that we may rule supreme in heaven.\" This is addressed to the Adityas. Next the Saman addressed to the Visve−devas: \"O Fire! Open the door of the heaven−world. Let us see thee, that we may rule supreme in heaven.\" 14−15 Then the sacrificer offers an oblation, reciting thus: \"Adoration to Adityas and the Visve−devas, who dwell in the heaven−world! Secure this world for me, the sacrificer. That is the world for the sacrificer. \"I, the sacrificer, will go thither when this life is over. Svaha!

Chapter XII − Meditation on the Gayatri 1 The gayatri is everything, whatever here exists. Speech is verily the Gayatri, for speech sings forth (gaya−ti) and protects (traya−te) everything, whatever here exists. 2 That Gayatri is also the earth; for everything that exists here rests on this earth and does not go beyond. 3 In man, that Gayatri is also the body; for the pranas exist in this body and do not go beyond. 4 That body, in man, is again the heart within a man; for the pranas exist in it and do not go beyond. 5 That Gayatri has four feet and is sixfold. The same is also declared by a Rik−verse: 6 \"Such is its greatness (i.e. of Brahman as known through the symbol of the Gayatri). Greater than it is the Person (Brahman).

Chapter XV − Meditation on the Universe as a Chest 1 The chest of the universe, with the mid−region for its inside and the earth for its bottom, does not decay. The quarters are its different corners and heaven is its lid, which is above. This chest is the storehouse of treasures. Inside it are all things. 2 The eastern quarter is called Juhu, the southern quarter Sahamana, the western quarter Rajni and the northern quarter Subhuta. Vayu the air is their child. He who knows this Vayu as the child of the quarters never weeps for his sons. I know the air to be the child of the quarters; may I never weep for my sons. 3 I take refuge in the imperishable chest with this one and this one and this one. I take refuge in the prana with this one and this one and this one. I take refuge in Bhuh with this one and this one and this one. I take refuge in Bhuvah with this one and this one and this one. I take refuge Svah with this one and this one and this one. 4 When I said: \"I take refuge in the prana,\" prana meant everything that exists here−in that I take refuge. 5 When I said: \"I take refuge in Bhuh,\" what I really said was: \"I refuge in the earth, the mid−region and heaven.\" 6 Then I said: \"I take refuge in Bhuvah,\" what I said was: \"I take in fire, the air and the sun.\" 7 When I said: \"I take refuge in Svah,\" what I said was: \"I take refuge in the Rig−Veda, Yajur−Veda and Sama−Veda.\" That is what I said, yea, that is what I said.

Why do you afflict me? I shall not die of this pain\" He lived a hundred and sixteen years. He, too, who knows this lives on to a hundred and sixteen years.

His death is the Avabhritha. 6 Ghora, of the line of Angirasa, communicated this teaching to Krishna, the son of Devaki−and it quenched Krishna’s thirst for any other knowledge−and said: \"When a man approaches death he should take refuge in these three thoughts: ‘Thou art indestructible (akshata),’ ‘Thou art unchanging (aprachyuta),’ and ‘Thou art the subtle prana.’ \"On this subject there are two Rik−verses: 7 \"They (i.e. the knowers of Brahman) see everywhere the Supreme Light, which shines in Brahman, which is all−pervading like the light of day and which belongs to the primeval Seed. ‘Perceiving the higher light in the sun−which is above the darkness of ignorance−as the higher light in the heart, perceiving the Supreme Light which is higher than all lights, we have reached the Highest Light, the Sun, the most luminous among the gods, yea, we have reached the Highest Light, the Sun, the most luminous among the gods.\" Chapter XVIII − The Mind and the Akasa as Symbols of Brahman 1 One should meditate on the mind as Brahman−this is said with reference to the body.

Chapter XIX − Meditation on the Sun as Brahman 1 The sun is Brahman: this is the teaching. An explanation thereof follows: In the beginning this universe was non−existent. It became existent. It grew. It turned into an egg. The egg lay for the period of a year. Then it broke open. Of the two halves of the egg−shell, one half was of silver, the other of gold. 2 That which was of silver became the earth; that which was of gold, heaven. What was the thick membrane of the white became the mountains; the thin membrane of the yolk, the must and the clouds. The veins became the rivers; the fluid in the bladder, the ocean. 3 And what was born of it was yonder Aditya, the sun. when it was born shouts of \"Hurrah!\" arose, together with all beings and all objects of desire. Therefore at its rise and its every return shouts of \"Hurrah!\" together with all beings and all objects of desire arise. 4 He who, knowing this, meditates on the sun as Brahman−pleasant sounds will quickly approach him and continue to delight him, yea, continue to delight him. −− Part 3 −− Part 3 32"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Part 4 Chapter I − The Story of Janasruti and Raikva 1 There once lived a king named Janasruti, who was a great−grandson of Janasruta.

Short−sighted, Short−sighted! The radiance of Janasruti, the great−grandson of Janasruta, has spread to the sky. Do not touch it, lest it should burn you.\" 3 The other replied: \"Say, who is this person about whom you have spoken as though he were like Raikva, the man with the cart?\" \"What sort of person is this Raikva, the man with the cart?\" 4 The short−sighted flamingo replied: \"As in a game of dice, when the krita is won, the lower ones also are won, so whatever merits people acquire all accrue to that Raikva. As Raikva I describe him, too, who knows what Raikva knows.\" 5−6 Janasruti the great−grandson of Janasruta overheard this conversation. Immediately after getting out of bed, he said to his attendant: \"Friend, did you speak of me as though I were Raikva, the man with the cart?\" \"What sort of person is Raikva, the man with the cart?\" \"As in a game of dice, when the krita is won, the lower ones also are won, so whatever merits people acquire all accrue to that Raikva.

Humbly he took his seat near him and said: \"Revered Sir, are you Raikva, the man with the cart?\" \"Oh yes, I am he,\" he answered.

His father said to him: \"Svetaketu, since you are now so serious, think yourself well read and are so arrogant, have you, my dear, ever asked for that instruction by which one hears what cannot be heard, by which one perceives what cannot be perceived, by which one knows what cannot be known?\" Svetaketu asked: \"What is that instruction, venerable Sir?\" 4−6 \"Just as, my dear, by one clod of clay all that is made of clay is known, the modification being only a name, arising from speech, while the truth is that all is clay; \"Just as, my dear, by one nugget of gold all that is made of gold is known, the modification being only a name, arising from speech, while the truth is that all is gold; \"And just as, my dear, by one pair of nail−scissors all that is made of iron is known, the modification being only a name, arising from speech, while the truth is that all is iron−even so, my dear, is that instruction.\" 7 \"Surely those venerable men did not know that.

How could Being be born from non−being?

This dam is not passed by day and night, by old age, death and grief, or by good and evil deeds. All evils turn back from It, for the World of Brahman is free from all evil. 2 Therefore, having reached this dam, he who is blind ceases to be blind, he who is miserable ceases to be miserable, he who is afflicted with disease ceases to be afflicted.

Verily, the sun yonder is brown, it is white, it is blue, it is yellow, it is red. 2 As a long highway runs between two villages, this one and that yonder, so do the rays of the sun go to both worlds, this one and that yonder. They start from yonder sun and enter into these arteries; they start from these arteries and enter into yonder sun. 3 When a man is asleep, with the senses withdrawn and serene and sees no dream, then he has entered into these arteries. Then no evil touches him, for he has obtained the light of the sun. 4 And when he becomes weak, then those sitting around him say: \"Do you know me? Do you know me?\" As long as he has not departed from this body, he knows them. 5 When he departs from the body if he is a mere ritualist and ignorant of Brahman he then goes upward by these rays toward the worlds which he has gained by his meritorious work. Or if he is a knower of the doctrines of the akasa in the lotus of the heart, he then meditates on Om and thus secures entrance into Brahmaloka. Or if he is ignorant he attains lower bodies. The knower attains the solar orb as quickly as one directs one’s mind from one object to another. This indeed is the door to the World of Brahman for those who know; for the ignorant it is closed. 6 On this there is the following verse: \"There are one hundred and one arteries of the heart, one of which pierces the crown of the head.

He who has known this Self from the scriptures and a teacher and understood It obtains all the worlds and all desires. 2 The devas (gods) and asuras (demons) both heard these words and said: \"Well, let us search out this Self by searching out which one obtains all the worlds and all desires.\" Indra, among the gods, went forth and Virochana, among the demons. Without communicating with each other, the two came into the presence of Prajapati, fuel in hand. 3 They dwelt there for thirty−two years, practising brahmacharya. Then Prajapati said to them: \"For what purpose have you both been living here?\" They said: \"A saying of yours is being repeated by learned people: ‘The Self which is free from sin, free from old age, free from death, free from grief, free from hunger, free from thirst, whose desires come true and whose thoughts come true−That it is which should be searched out, That it is which one should desire to understand. He who has known this Self and understood It obtains all the worlds and all desires.’ Now, we both have dwelt here because we desire that Self.\" 4 Prajapati said to them: \"The person that is seen in the eye−that is the Self.\" He further said: \"This is immortal, fearless. This is Brahman.\" They asked: \"Venerable Sir, he who is perceived in the water and he who is perceived in a mirror−which of these is he?\" Prajapati replied: \"The same one, indeed, is perceived in all these.\" Chapter VIII − The Doctrine of the Demons 1 Prajapati said: \"Look at yourself in a pan of water and then what you do not understand of the Self come and tell me.\" They cast their glance in a pan of water. Then Prajapati said to them: \"What do you see?\" They said: \"Venerable Sir, we see the entire self even to the very hairs and nails, a veritable picture.\" 2 Prajapati said to them: \"After you have well adorned yourselves with ornaments, put on your best clothes and cleansed yourselves, look into the pan of water.\" Part 8 77"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"After having adorned themselves well, put on their best clothes and cleansed themselves, they looked into the pan of water. \"What do you see?\" asked Prajapati. 3 They said: \"Just as we ourselves are well adorned, well dressed and clean, so, venerable Sir, are these two reflections well adorned, well dressed and clean.\" Prajapati said: \"This is the Self, this is immortal, fearless. This is Brahman.\" They both went away satisfied in heart. 4 Prajapati saw them going and said: \"They are both going away without having known and without having realized the Self. And whoever of these, whether gods or demons, follow this doctrine shall perish.\" Virochana, satisfied in heart, went to the demons and preached this doctrine (Upanishad) to them: \"The self (i.e. body) alone is to be worshipped here on earth, the self (i.e. body) alone is to be served. It is only by worshipping the self here and by serving the self that one gains both worlds−this and the next.\" 5 Therefore even today they say of one who does not practise charity, who has no faith and who does not perform sacrifices: \"He is verily a demon\"; for such is the doctrine of the demons. The demons deck the bodies of the dead with garlands and perfume, with raiment and with ornaments, for they think that thus they will win the world beyond. Chapter IX − The Shadow Self is Perishable 1 But Indra, even before he had reached the gods, saw this difficulty: \"As this reflection in the water is well adorned when the body is well adorned, well dressed when the body is well dressed, clean when the body is clean, so this reflection in the water will be blind if the body is blind, one−eyed if the body is one−eyed, crippled if the body is crippled and will perish if the body perishes. 2 \"I do not see any good in this doctrine.\" He returned with fuel in hand. To him Prajapati said: \"Well, Indra, you went away with Virochana, satisfied in heart; now for what purpose have you come back?\" He (Indra) said: \"Venerable Sir, as this reflection in the water is well adorned when the body is well adorned, well dressed when the body is well dressed, clean when the body is clean, so this reflection in the water will be blind if the body is blind, one−eyed if the body is one−eyed, crippled if the body is crippled and will perish if the body perishes. Therefore I do not see any good in this doctrine.\" 3 \"So it is Indra,\" replied Prajapati. \"I shall explain the Self to you further. Live with me another thirty−two years.\" He lived with Prajapati another thirty−two years.

Then Prajapati said to Indra: Chapter XI − The Self in Dreamless Sleep 1 \"When a man is asleep, with senses withdrawn and serene and sees no dream−that is the Self. This is immortal, fearless. This is Brahman.\" Then Indra went away satisfied in heart. But even before he had reached the gods, he saw this difficulty: \"In truth it (i.e. the self in dreamless sleep) does not know itself as ‘I am it,’ nor these other creatures. It has therefore reached in dreamless sleep utter annihilation, as it were. I do not see any good in this.\" 2 He returned with fuel in hand. To him Prajapati said: \"Well, Indra, you went away satisfied in heart; now for what purpose have you come back?\" He (Indra) said: \"Venerable Sir, in truth it (i.e. the self in dreamless sleep) does not know itself as ‘I am it,’ nor these other creatures. It has therefore reached utter annihilation, as it were. I do not see any good in this.\" 3 \"So it is, Indra,\" replied Prajapati. \"I shall explain the Self further to you and nothing else. Live with me another five years.\" Indra lived with Prajapati another five years. This made in all one hundred and one years.

Then Prajapati said to him: Chapter XII − The Incorporeal Self 1 \"O Indra, this body is mortal, always held by death. It is the abode of the Self which is immortal and incorporeal. The embodied self is the victim of pleasure and pain. So long as one is identified with the body, there is no cessation of pleasure and pain. But neither pleasure nor pain touches one who is not identified with the body. 2−3 \"The wind is without body; the cloud, lightning and thunder are without body. Now, as these, arising from yonder akasa and reaching the highest light, appear in their own forms, \"So does this serene Being, arising from this body and reaching the Highest Light, appear in His own form. In that state He is the Highest Person. There He moves about, laughing, playing, rejoicing−be it with women, chariots, or relatives, never thinking of the body into which he was born. \"As an animal is attached to a cart, so is the prana (i.e. the conscious self) attached to the body. 4 \"When the person in the eye resides in the body, he resides where the organ of sight has entered into the akasa (i.e. the pupil of the eye); the eye is the instrument of seeing. He who is aware of the thought: ‘Let me smell this,’ he is the Self; the nose is the instrument of smelling. He who is aware of the thought: ‘Let me speak,’ he is the Self; the tongue is the instrument of speaking. He who is aware of the thought: ‘Let me hear,’ he is the Self; the ear is the instrument of hearing. 5 \"He who is aware of the thought: ‘Let me think this,’ he is the Self; the mind is his divine eye. He, the Self sees all these desires in the World of Brahman through the divine eye, the mind and rejoices. 6 \"The gods meditate on that Self. Therefore all worlds belong to them and all desires. He who knows that Self and understands It obtains all worlds and all desires.\" Thus said Prajapati, yea, thus said Prajapati. Chapter XIII − A Mantra for Meditation and Repetition 1 From the dark I come to the variegated; from the variegated I come to the Dark. Shaking off evil as a horse shakes dust from its hair, freeing myself from the body as the moon frees itself from the mouth of Rahu, I fulfil all ends and obtain the uncreated World of Brahman.
