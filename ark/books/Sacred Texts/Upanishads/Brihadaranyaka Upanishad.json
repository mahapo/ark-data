The back is heaven, the belly the intermediate region, the hoof the earth, the sides the four quarters, the ribs the intermediate quarters, the limbs the seasons, the joints the months and half—months, the feet the days and nights, the bones the stars, the flesh the clouds. Its half—digested food is the sand, the blood—vessels the rivers, the liver and lungs the mountains, the hair the herbs and trees. The fore part of the horse is the rising sun and the hinder part the setting sun. Its yawn is lightning, its shaking of the body is thunder, its water is rain and its neighing is indeed voice. 2 The day, verily, is the golden cup called mahiman, in front of the horse, which arose pointing it out. Its source is the eastern sea. The night, verily, is the silver cup called mahiman, behind the horse, which arose pointing it out. Its source is the western sea. These two vessels appeared at either end of the horse. As a racer the horse carried the gods; as a stallion, the gandharvas; as a runner, the demons; as a horse, men. The sea is its stable and the sea, its source. Chapter II—The Process of Creation 1 In the beginning there was nothing whatsoever in the universe. By Death, indeed, all this was covered—by hunger, for hunger is, verily, death. \"Let Me have a mind,\" was His desire and He created the mind. Then He moved about, worshipping Himself. From Him, thus worshipping, water was produced. \"Verily,\" Death though, \"while I was worshipping, water was produced\"; that is why the Arka (fire used in the Horse—sacrifice) is so called. Surely, happiness comes to him who knows how the fire came to be called arka. 2 Water, verily, is arka. What was then like froth on the water became solidified; that was earth. After the earth was created, Hiranyagarbha was tired. From Him, thus fatigued and heated, came forth His essence as brightness. That was Fire. 3 He divided Himself into three: the sun one—third and the air one—third. Thus Prana is divided into three. His head is the east and His arms are that (the north—east) and that (the south—east). His hinder part is the west and His two hip—bones are that (the north—west) and that (the south—west). His sides are the south and the north, His back is heaven, His belly is the intermediate region and His chest is the earth. Thus He stands firm on water. He who knows this stands firm wherever he goes. 2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"4 He desired: \"Let a second self be born of Me,\" and He (Death or Hunger) brought about the union of speech with the mind. What was the seed there became the year. Prior to that there had been no year. He (Death) bore him (the year) for as long as a year and after that time projected him. Then, when he was born, Death opened His mouth to devour him. He (the child) cried: \"Bhan!\" and that, indeed, became speech. 5 He thought: \"If I kill him, I shall have but very little food,'' and through the union of that speech and that mind He brought forth all this, whatever there is: the Rig—Veda, the Yajur—Veda, the Sama—Veda, the metres, the sacrifices, men and animals. Whatever He brought forth He resolved to eat. Verily, because He eats everything, therefore is Aditi (Death) called Aditi. He who knows why Aditi came to have this name of Aditi becomes the eater of everything and everything becomes his food. 6 He desired: \"Let me sacrifice again with the great sacrifice.\" He was tired and he practiced austerities. From Him thus fatigued and heated, His fame and vigour departed. The pranas (organs) are verily fame and vigour. When the pranas went out His body began to swell, but the mind was set on the body. 7 He desired: \"Let this body of Mine be fit for a sacrifice and let Me be embodied through this.\" Thinking thus, He entered the body. Because the body swelled (asvat), therefore it came to be called horse (asva). And because it became fit for sacrifice (medhya), therefore the Horse—sacrifice came to be known as Asvamedha. He who knows this verily knows the Horse—sacrifice. Prajapati, desiring again to sacrifice with the great sacrifice, imagined Himself as the horse and letting the horse remain free, He reflected on it. At the end of a year he sacrificed it to Himself and dispatched the other animals to the gods. Therefore priests even now sacrifice to Prajapati the sanctified horse dedicated to all the gods. Verily, the sun who shines yonder is the Horse—sacrifice. His body is the year. This earthly fire is the arka (sacrificial fire), whose limbs are these worlds. So these two, fire and the sun, are the arka and the Asvamedha (Horse—sacrifice). These two, again, become the same god, Death. He who knows this conquers further death; death cannot overcome him; death becomes his self; and he becomes one with these deities. Chapter III—The Prana: Its Glories and Redeeming Power 1 There were two classes of Prajapati’s sons: the gods (devas) and the demons (asuras). Naturally, the gods were few and the demons many. They struggled with one another for mastery of these worlds. Being overwhelmed by the demons, the gods said: \"Well, let Us overcome the demons at the sacrifice (jyotishtoma) by means of the Udgitha.\" 2 They said to the organ of speech: \"Chant the Udgitha for us.\" \"So be it,\" said speech and chanted for them. Whatever enjoyment common to all comes from the organ of speech, it Part 1 3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"secured for the gods by chanting, while the enjoyment derived from the fine utterance of the words it utilized for itself. Now, the demons knew that through this chanter the gods would overcome them. They charged at it (speech) and pierced it with evil. That evil is what is found today when one speaks improperly; that is that evil. 3 Then they said to the organ of smell: \"Chant the Udgitha for us.\" \"So be it,\" said the organ and chanted for them. Whatever enjoyment common to all comes from the nose, it secured for the gods by chanting, while the enjoyment derived from fine smelling it utilized for itself. Now, the demons knew that through this chanter the gods would overcome them. They charged at it and pierced it with evil. That evil is what is found today when one smells improper things; that is that evil. 4 Then they said to the organ of Seeing: \"Chant the Udgitha for us.\" \"So be it,\" said the organ and chanted for them. Whatever enjoyment common to all comes from the eye, it secured for the gods by chanting, while the enjoyment derived from fine seeing it utilized for itself. Now, the demons knew that through this chanter the gods would overcome them. They charged at it and pierced it with evil. That evil is what is found today when one sees improper things; that is that evil. 5 Then they said to the organ of hearing: \"Chant the Udgitha for us.\" \"So be it,\" said the organ and chanted for them. Whatever enjoyment common to all comes from the ear, it secured for the gods by chanting, while the enjoyment derived from fine hearing it utilized for itself. Now, the demons knew that through this chanter the gods would overcome them. They charged at it and pierced it with evil. That evil is what is found today when one hears improper things; that is that evil. 6 Then they said to the mind: \"Chant the Udgitha for us.\" \"So be it,\" said the mind and chanted for them. Whatever enjoyment common to all comes from the mind, it secured for the gods by chanting, while the enjoyment derived from fine thinking it utilized for itself. Now, the demons knew that through this chanter the gods would overcome them. They charged at it and pierced it with evil. That evil is what is found today when one thinks improperly; that is that evil. Likewise they also touched these other deities with evil—smote them with evil. 7 Then they said to the vital breath in the mouth: \"Chant the Udgitha for us.\" \"So be it,\" said the vital breath and chanted for them. The demons knew that through this chanter the gods would overcome them. They charged at it, intending to pierce it with evil. But as a clod of earth, hitting a stone, is scattered, even so they were scattered in all directions, crushed, and completely destroyed. Thereupon the gods became established in their true selves and the demons perished. He who knows this becomes his true self, and his spiteful kinsman perishes. Part 1 4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"8 Then the organs said: \"Where is that which joined us to our true selves?\" After deliberation they discovered that it was here, within the mouth (asye). Hence the vital breath (prana) is called ayasya and also, because it is the essence (rasa) of the limbs (anga) of the body, angirasa. 9 That deity is called \"dur,\" because death is far (dur) from it. From him who knows this, death is far away. 10 That deity took away death, the evil of these gods and carried it to where the end of the quarters is. There it deposited their evil. Therefore let no one go to a person of that region, or to the country beyond the border, lest he should meet there with evil, with death. 11 That deity, after taking away the death—the evil—of the gods, carried them beyond death. 12 First of all, it carried the organ of speech, which is the foremost organ. When the organ of speech was freed from death it became fire. That fire, having transcended death, shines beyond its reach. 13—15 Then it carried the organ of smell. When it was freed from death it became air (Vayu). That air, having transcended death, blows beyond its reach. Then it carried the organ of sight. When it was freed from death it became the sun (Surya). That sun, having transcended death, shines beyond its reach. Then it carried the organ of hearing. When it was freed from death, it became the quarters (Disah). Those quarters, having transcended death, remain beyond its reach. 16 Then it carried the mind. When the mind was freed from death it became the moon (Chandra). That moon, having transcended death, shines beyond its reach. Thus, verily, that deity carries beyond death him who knows this. 17 Next it (the vital breath) obtained eatable food for itself by chanting. For whatever food is eaten, is eaten by the vital breath alone, and it (the vital breath) rests on that (the food). 18 The gods said to the vital breath: \"Verily, just this much is all the food there is and you have secured it for yourself by chanting. Now give us, please, a share of this food.\" \"Then sit around facing me.\" \"So be it.\" They sat down around the vital breath. That is why whatever food one eats through the vital breath satisfies the organs. So do his relatives sit around facing him who knows this; he becomes the supporter of his Part 1 5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"kinsmen, the greatest among them and their leader, a good eater of food and their lord. Whoever, among his kinsmen, the greatest among them and their leader, a good eater of food and their lord. Whoever, among his kinsmen, desires to be a rival of the man who has this knowledge is not able to support his dependents. But, on the other hand, he who follows him (the knower of the vital breath) and who, following him, desires to support his dependents is certainly able to do so. 19 It is called ayasa angirasa, for it is the essence (rasa) of the limbs (anga). Yes, the prana is the essence of the limbs. From whichever limb the vital breath departs, that limb withers right there; therefore it is verily the essence of the limbs. 20 It is also Brihaspati (lord of the Rig—Veda). Speech is Brihati (Rig) and the vital breath is its lord (pati). Therefore it is called Brihaspati. 21 It is also the Brahmanaspati (lord of the Yajur—Veda). Speech is Brahman (Yajur), and the vital breath is its lord (pati). Therefore it is called Brahmanaspati. 22 Prana is Saman, too. Speech is, verily, sa and this (prana) is ama. Saman (the chant of the Sama—Veda) is known by that name because it is sa (speech) and ama (prana). Or because it (prana) is equal (sama) to a white ant, equal to a mosquito, equal to an elephant, equal to these three worlds, nay, equal to this universe; therefore it (prana) is indeed the Sama—Veda. He who knows this vital breath to be such attains union with it or lives in the same world with it. 23 And it is also the Udgitha. The vital breath is verily ut, for by the vital breath all this universe is upheld (uttabdha); and speech is githa (song). And because it is ut and githa, therefore it is Udgitha. 24 Regarding this there is also the following anecdote: Brahmadatta, the great—grandson of Chikitana, while drinking king [soma], said: \"Let this soma strike off my head if I say that the ayasya angirasa chanted the Udgitha through any other means than this vital breath and speech.\" Surely he chanted through speech and the vital breath. 25 He who knows the wealth of this saman (Vital breath) obtains wealth. Tone, indeed, is its wealth. Therefore let one who is going to perform the sacrificial work as a priest desire that his voice may have a good tone and let him perform the sacrifice through that voice with a good tone. Therefore people desire to see at a sacrifice a priest with a good voice, like one who has wealth. He who thus knows what is the wealth of the saman obtains wealth. Part 1 6"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"26 He who knows the suvarna (gold) of the saman (vital breath) obtains gold. Tone is verily its gold. He who thus knows what is the gold of the saman obtains gold. 27 He who knows the support of the saman (vital breath) gets a support. Speech Verily is its support. For, supported in speech, the vital breath is transformed into a chant. Some say the support is in food (the body). 28 Next follows the edifying repetition (abhyaroha) only of the hymns called pavamanas. The priest called prastotri indeed chants the saman. While he chants it, let the sacrificer recite these [Yajur verses]: \"Lead me from the unreal to the real. From darkness lead me to light. From death lead me to immortality.\" When the mantra (verse) says: \"Lead me from the unreal to the real,\" \"the unreal\" means death, and the \"real,\" immortality; so it says, \"From death lead me to immortality,\" that is to say, \"Make me immortal.\" When it says: \"From darkness lead me to light,\" \"darkness\" means death, and \"light,\" immortality; so it says: \"From death lead me to immortality,\" that is to say, \"Make me immortal.\" In the verse: \"From death lead me to immortality,\" there is nothing that is hidden. Then come the remaining hymns, with which, by singing them, [the chanter] should obtain food for himself. Therefore while they are being chanted let the sacrificer ask for a boon—anything that he desires. Whatever objects this chanter, endowed with such knowledge, desires for himself or for the sacrificer, he obtains by his chanting. This [meditation] by itself wins the world (Hiranyagarbha). He who thus knows the saman (the prana, or vital breath)—for him there is no fear of not being admitted into that world. Chapter IV—The Creation and Its Cause 1 In the beginning, this universe was the self (Viraj) alone, in the shape of a person. He reflected and saw nothing else but His self. He first said: \"I am He.\" Therefore He came to be known by the name I (Aham). Hence, even now, when a person is addressed, he first says: \"It is I,\" and then says whatever other name he may have. And because He, before (purva) the whole group of aspirants, burnt (aushat) all evils, therefore He is called Purusha. He who knows this verily burns up him who wishes to be Viraj in advance of him. 2 He was afraid. Therefore people still are afraid when alone. He thought: \"Since there is nothing else but Myself, what am I afraid of?\" Thereupon His fears were gone; for what was there to fear? Assuredly, it is from a second entity that fear arises. 3 He was not at all happy. Therefore a person even today is not happy when alone. He desired a mate. He became the size of a man and wife in close embrace. He divided this body into two. From that division arose husband (pati) and wife (patni). Therefore, as Part 1 7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Yajnavalkya said, the body before one accepts a wife is one half of oneself, like the half of a split pea. Therefore this space is indeed filled by the wife. He was united with her. From that union human beings were born. 4 She reflected: \"How can he unite with me after having produced me from himself? Well, let me hide myself.\" She became a cow, the other (Manu) became a bull and was united with her; from that union cows were born. The one became a mare, the other became a stallion; the one became a she—ass, the other became a he—ass and was united with her; from that union one—hoofed animals were born. The one became a she—goat, the other became a he—goat; the one became a hew, the other became a ram and was united with her; from that union goats and sheep were born. Thus, indeed, he produced everything that exists in pairs, down to the ants. 5 He (Viraj) realized: \"Indeed, I am the creation, for I produced all this.\" Therefore He became the creation. He who knows this becomes a creator in this creation of Viraj. 6 Then He (Viraj) rubbed back and forth thus and produced fire from its source: the mouth and the hands. Therefore both the hands and mouth are hairless inside. When they (the priests) speak of particular gods, saying: \"Sacrifice to him,\" \"Sacrifice to that one,\" they are mistaken; for these are all His manifestations: He Himself is all the gods. Now, whatever is liquid, He produced from semen; and that is soma. This universe is indeed this much: food and the eater of food. Soma is food; and fire, the eater of food. This is the highest creation of Viraj, that He projected the gods, who are even superior to Him. This is the highest creation because He, although mortal Himself, manifested the immortal. And he who knows this verily becomes a creator in this highest creation of Viraj. 7 Now, all this universe was then undifferentiated. It became differentiated by name and form: it was known by such and such a name, and such and such a form. Thus to this day this universe is differentiated by name and form; so it is said. \"He has such a name and such a form.\" This Self has entered into these bodies up to the very tips of the nails, as a razor lies hidden in its case, or as fire, which sustains the world, lies hidden in its source. People do not see the Self, for when viewed in parts It is incomplete: when breathing, It is called the vital breath (prana); when speaking, the organ of speech; when seeing, the eye; when hearing, the ear; when thinking, the mind. These are merely Its names according to Its functions. He who meditates on one or another of Its aspects does not know, for It is then incomplete: the Self is separated from Its totality by being associated with a single characteristic. The Self alone is to be meditated upon, for in It all these become unified. Of all these, this Self alone should be known, for one knows all these through It, just as one may find an animal which is lost through its footprints. He who thus knows the Self obtains fame and association with dear ones. Part 1 8"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"8 This Self is dearer than a son, dearer than wealth, dearer than everything else, because It is innermost. If one holding the Self dear were to say to a person who speaks of anything other than the Self as dear, that he, the latter, will lose what he holds dear—and the former is certainly competent to do so—it will indeed come true. One should meditate upon the Self alone as dear. He who meditates upon the Self alone as dear—what he holds dear will not perish. 9 They say: \"Since men think that by the Knowledge of Brahman they become all, what, pray, was it that Brahman knew by which It became all?\" 10 This self was indeed Brahman in the beginning. It knew itself only as \"I am Brahman.\" Therefore it became all. And whoever among the gods had this enlightenment, also became That Brahman. It is the same with the seers (rishis), the same with men. The seer Vamadeva, having realized this self as That, came to know: \"I was Manu and the sun.\" And to this day, whoever in a like manner knows the self as \"I am Brahman,\" becomes all this universe. Even the gods cannot prevent his becoming this, for he has become their Self. Now, if a man worships another deity, thinking: \"He is one and I am another,\" he does not know. He is like an animal to the gods. As many animals serve a man, so does each man serve the gods. Even if one animal is taken away, it causes anguish to the owner; how much more so when many are taken away! Therefore it is not pleasing to the gods that men should know this. 11 In the beginning this (the kshatriya and other castes) was indeed Brahman, one only without a second. He, being one, did not flourish. He projected, further, an excellent form, kshatriyahood—those kshatriyas (rulers) among the gods: Indra, Varuna, Soma (Moon), Rudra, Parjanya, Yama, Mrityu (Death), and Isana. Therefore there is none higher than the kshatriyas. Thus at the Rajasuya sacrifice, the brahmin sits below and worships the kshatriya. He confers that glory on kshatriyahood alone. But brahminhood is nevertheless the source of kshatriyahood. Therefore even though the king is exalted in the sacrifice, at the end of it he resorts to brahminhood as his source. He who slights a brahmin strikes at his own source. He becomes more evil, as one who slights his superior. 12 Yet He (Viraj) did not flourish. He projected the Vaisya caste—those classes of gods who are designated in groups: the Vasus, Rudras, Adityas, Visve—devas and Maruts. 13 Still He did not flourish. He projected the sudra caste—Pushan. This earth is Verily Pushan (the nourisher); for it nourishes all that exists. 14 Yet He did not flourish. He projected, further, that excellent form, justice (dharrna). This justice is the controller of the kshatriya. Therefore there is nothing higher than justice. So even a weak man hopes to defeat a stronger man through justice, as one does with the Part 1 9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"help of a king. Verily, that which is justice is truth. Therefore if a man speaks the truth, they say he speaks what is just, and if he speaks what is just, they say he speaks the truth; for justice alone is both these. 15 So these four castes were projected: the brahmin: the kshatriya, the vaisya, and the sudra. Among the gods Prajapati became a brahmin as fire, and among men He became the brahmin. He became a kshatriya among men through the divine kshatriyas, a vaisya through the divine vaisyas, and a sudra through the divine sudras. Therefore people desire to attain the results of their rites among the gods through fire, and among men as a brahmin. For Prajapati directly projected Himself as these two forms. Now, if a man departs from this world without realizing his own World (the Self), It, being unknown, does not protect him—as the Vedas, unrecited, or as a deed unaccomplished, do not protect him. Nay, even if one who does not know It (the Self) should perform here on earth a great many meritorious acts, those acts will in the end surely perish for him. One should meditate only upon the World called the Self. He who meditates upon the World called the Self—his work does not perish; for from this very Self he projects whatever he desires. 16 Now, this self (the ignorant person) is an object of enjoyment (lokah) to all beings. In so far as he offers oblations in the fire and performs sacrifices, he becomes an object of enjoyment to the gods. In so far as he studies the Vedas, he becomes an object of enjoyment to the rishis. In so far as he makes offerings to the Manes and desires children, he becomes an object of enjoyment to the Manes. In so far as he gives shelter and food to men, he becomes an object of enjoyment to men. In so far as he gives fodder and water to the animals, he becomes an object of enjoyment to the animals. In so far as beasts and birds and even ants find a living in his home, he becomes an object of enjoyment to these. Just as one wishes no injury to one's body, so do all beings wish no injury to him who has this knowledge. All this, indeed, has been known and well investigated. 17 In the beginning this aggregate of desirable objects was but the self, one only. He cherished the desire: \"Let me have a wife, so that I may be born as the child; and let me have wealth, so that I may perform rites.\" This much, indeed, is the range of desire; even if one wishes, one cannot get more than this. Therefore, to this day, a man who is single desires: \"Let me have a wife, so that I may be born as the child; and let me have wealth, so that I may perform rites.\" So long as he does not obtain each one of these, he thinks he is incomplete. Now, his completeness can also come in this way: The mind is his self, speech his wife, the vital breath his child, the eye his human wealth, for he finds it with the eye; the ear his divine wealth, for he hears it with the ear; the body his instrument of rites, for he performs rites through the body. So this sacrifice has five factors—the animals have five factors, men have five factors and all this that exists has five factors. He who knows this obtains all this. Chapter V—Manifestations of Prajapati Part 1 10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"1 The following are the mantras: \"I shall now disclose that the father produced seven kinds of food through meditation and rites. One is common to all eaters. Two he assigned to the gods. Three he designed for himself. And one he gave to the animals. On it (food) rests everything—whatsoever breathes and whatsoever breathes not. Why are not these foods exhausted although they are always being eaten? He who knows the cause of this inexhaustibility of the food eats food with pre—eminence (pratika). He obtains identity with the gods and lives on nectar.\" 2 When it is said: \"That the father produced seven kinds of food through meditation and rites,\" the statement means that the father indeed produced them through meditation and rites. When it is said: \"One is common to all eaters,\" it means that the food which is eaten is that which is common to all. He who appropriates this food is never free from evil, for this is, verily, the general food. When it is said: \"Two he assigned to the gods,\" the statement means oblations made in the fire and presents offered otherwise to the gods. Therefore people make oblations in the fire and offer presents otherwise to the gods. Some, however, say that the two foods refer to the new—moon and full—moon sacrifices. Therefore one should not engage in sacrifices for material ends. When it is said: \"One he gave to the animals,\" the statement refers to milk; for at first men and animals live on milk alone. That is why they first make a new—born babe lick melted butter or they put it to the breast. And they speak of the new—born calf as not yet eating grass. When it is said: \"On it rests everything—whatsoever breathes and whatsoever breathes not,\" it means that everything rests on milk, all that breathes and breathes not. It is further said in another Brahmana that by making offerings of milk in the fire for a year one overcomes further death; but one should not think thus. For he who knows this overcomes further death the very day he makes the offering, because he offers all eatable food to the gods. When it is asked: \"Why are not these foods exhausted although they are always being eaten?\" the answer is that the eater is indeed the cause of this inexhaustibility, for he produces this food again and again. When it is said: \"He who knows the cause of this inexhaustibility,\" the statement means that the eater is indeed the cause of this inexhaustibility, for he produces this food through meditation and rites. If he did not do this the food would be exhausted. When it is said: \"He eats food with pratika,\" the word pratika means pre—eminence; hence the meaning is that he eats food pre—eminently. The statement: \"He obtains identity with the gods and lives on nectar,\" is a eulogy. 3 \"Three he designed for himself\"—that is to say, the mind, the organ of speech and the vital breath; these he designed for himself. They say: \"My mind was elsewhere, I did not see it; my mind was elsewhere, I did not hear it.\" It is clear that a man sees with his mind and hears with his mind. Desire, determination, doubt, faith, lack of faith, steadfastness, lack of steadfastness, shame, intelligence and fear—all this is truly the mind. Even if one is touched from behind, one knows it through the mind; therefore the mind exists. Whatever sound there is, it is just the organ of speech; for it serves to determine a thing, but it cannot itself be revealed. The prana, apana, vyana, udana, samana and ana—all these are but the vital breath (prana). This body (atma) consists of these—the organ of speech, the mind and the vital breath.

Whatever is known is a form of the organ of speech, for it is the knower. The organ of speech protects him who knows its different manifestations by becoming that which is known). Whatever is to be known is a form of the mind, for the mind is what is to be known. The mind protects him who knows this by becoming that which is to be known. Whatever is unknown is a form of the vital breath, for the vital breath is what is unknown. The vital breath protects him who knows this by becoming that which is unknown. 11 The earth is the body of that organ of speech and this fire is its luminous organ. And as far as the organ of speech extends, so far extends the earth and so far extends fire. 12 Now, heaven is the body of this mind and that sun yonder is its luminous organ. And as far as the mind extends, so far extends the earth and so far extends fire. The two (fire and the sun) were united and from that was born the vital breath. It (the vital breath) is the supreme Lord (Indra). It is without a rival. A second being is, indeed, a rival. He who knows this has no rival. 13 Next, water is the body of this vital breath and that moon yonder is its luminous organ. And as far as the vital breath extends, so far extends water and so far extends the moon. These are all equal, all infinite. He who meditates upon them as finite wins a finite world, but he who meditates upon them as infinite wins an infinite world. 14 That Prajapan, represented by the year, consists of sixteen parts. The nights and days are fifteen of his parts and the constant point is the sixteenth. He as the moon is increased and decreased by the nights and days. Through the sixteenth part he permeates all living beings as the new—moon night and rises the following morning.

Wealth constitutes fifteen of his parts and the body is his sixteenth part. He is increased and decreased by that wealth. This body is the nave and wealth is the felloe. Therefore even if a man loses everything, but lives in his body, people say that he has lost only his felloe which can be restored again. 16 Now, these are, verily, the three worlds: the world of men, the world of the Manes and the world of the gods. The world of men can be gained through a son only and by no other rite; the world of the Manes through rites; and the world of the gods through meditation. The world of the gods is the best of the worlds. Therefore they praise meditation. 17 Now therefore follows the entrusting: When a man thinks he is about to die, he says to his son: \"You are Brahman, you are the sacrifice and you are the world.\" The son replies: \"I am Brahman, I am the sacrifice, I am the world.\" The Sruti explains the thoughts of the father: \"Whatever has been studied by me (the father) is all unified in the word Brahman. Whatever sacrifices have been made by me (the father) are all unified in the word sacrifice. And whatever worlds were to be; won by me (the father) are all unified in the word world. All this it indeed this much. He (the son), being all this, will protect me from the ties of this world.\" Therefore they speak of a son who is well instructed as being conducive to the winning of the world; and therefore a father instructs him. When a father who knows this departs from this world, he—along with his own organ of speech, mind and vital breath—penetrates his son. If, through a lapse, any duty has been left undone by him, the son exonerates him from all that; therefore he is called a son. The father remains in this world through the son. The divine and immortal organ of speech, mind and vital breath enter into him (the father). 18 The divine organ of speech from the earth and fire enters into him. That is the divine organ of speech through which whatever he says is fulfilled. 19 The divine mind from heaven and the sun permeates him. That is the divine mind through which he becomes joyful only and grieves no more. 20 The divine vital breath from water and the moon permeates him. And, verily, that is the divine vital breath which, whether moving or not moving, neither feels pain nor is injured. He who knows this becomes the self of all beings. As is this deity (Hiranyagarbha), so is he. And as all beings honour this deity, so do they honour him. Howsoever creatures may grieve, that grief of theirs remains with them but only merit goes to him. No demerit ever goes to the gods. Part 1 13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"21 Next follows the consideration of the vow (meditative worship): Prajapati projected the organs. They, when they were projected, quarrelled with one another. The organ of speech resolved: \"I will go on speaking\"; the eye: \"I will go on seeing\"; the ear: \"I will go on hearing.\" So did the other organs, according to their functions. Death, having taken the form of weariness, laid hold of them—it overtook them and having overtaken them, restrained them. Therefore does the organ of speech become tired and so do the eye and the ear. But death did not overtake the vital breath (prana) in the body. The other organs resolved to know it and said: \"This is verily the greatest among us; whether moving or not moving, it neither feels pain nor is injured. Well then, let us assume its form.\" They all assumed its form. Therefore they are called pranas after it. In whatever family there is a man who knows this—that family they call by his name. And whoever competes with one who knows this, shrivels and after shrivelling, in the end dies. This is with regard to the body. 22 Now with regard to the gods. Fire resolved: \"I will go on burning\"; the sun: \"I will go on giving heat\"; the moon: \"I will go on shining.\" And so did the other gods, according to their functions. As is the vital breath in the body among the organs, so is air (vayu) among the gods. The other gods fade, but not air. Air is the deity that never sets. 23 Now there is this verse (sloka): The gods observed the vow of that from which the sun rises and in which it sets. This vow is followed today and this will be followed tomorrow. The sun rises verily from the prana (the vital breath in its cosmic form) and also sets in it. The gods even today observe the same vow which they observed then. Therefore a man should observe a single vow—he should perform the functions of the prana and apana (respiration and excretion), lest the evil of death should overtake him. And if he performs them, let him try to complete them. Through this he obtains identity with that deity, or lives in the same world with it. Chapter VI—The Three Aspects of the Universe 1 Verily, this universe is a triad of name, form and work. Of those names which are in daily use, speech (sound in general) is the source (uktha), for from it all names arise. It is their common feature (saman), for it is common to all names. It is their Brahman (self), for it supports all names. 2 Next, of forms, the eye is the source (uktha), for from it all forms arise. It is their Common feature (saman), for it is common to all forms. It is their Brahman (self), for it supports all forms. 3 Next, of work, the body is the source (uktha), for from it all works arise. It is their common feature (saman), for it is common to all works.

When this being absorbs them, it is called svapiti. Then the organ of smell is absorbed, the organ of speech is absorbed, the eye is absorbed, the ear is absorbed and the mind is absorbed.\" 18 When the self remains in the dream state, these are its achievements (results of past action): It then becomes a great king, as it were; or a noble brahmin, as it were; or attains, as it were, high or low states. Even as a great king, taking with him his retinue of citizens, moves about, according to his pleasure, within his own domain, so does the self, taking with it the organs, move about according to its pleasure, in the body. 19 Next, when the self goes into deep sleep—when it does not know anything—it returns along the seventy—two thousand nerves called hita, which extend from the heart throughout the whole body and remains in the body. As a baby or an emperor or a noble brahmin lives, having reached the summit of happiness, so does the self rest. 20 As the spider moves along the thread it produces, or as from a fire tiny sparks fly in all directions, even so from this Atman come forth all organs, all worlds, all gods, all beings. Its secret name (Upanishad) is \"the Truth of truth.\" The vital breaths are the truth and their truth is Atman. Chapter II—Description of the Prana 1 He who knows the calf together with its abode, its special resort, its post and its rope, kills his seven hostile kinsmen. The vital breath in the body is indeed the calf; this body is its abode, the head its special resort, strength its post and food its rope. 2 These seven gods that prevent decay worship it (the calf): through these pink lines in the eye, Rudra attends on it; through the water in the eye, Parjanya attends on it; through the pupil of the eye, the sun attends on it; through the black of the eye, fire attends on it; through the white portion, Indra; through the lower eyelid, the earth; and through the upper eyelid, heaven attends on it. He who knows this—his food does not diminish. 3 Regarding this there is the following mantra: \"There is a bowl which has its mouth below and which bulges at the top. Manifold knowledge has been put into it; seven sages sit on its Part 2 18"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"rim and the organ of speech, which has communication with the Vedas, is the eighth.\" What is called the \"bowl which has its mouth below and which bulges at the top\" is this head of ours, for it is a bowl which has its mouth below and which bulges at the top.

When it is said: \"Seven sages sit on its rim,\" this refers to the organs; they indeed are the sages. \"The organ of speech, which has communication with the Vedas, is the eighth\" because the organ of speech is the eighth and communicates with the Vedas. 4 These two ears are Gotama and Bharadvaja: this one (the right) is Gotama and this one (the left), Bharadvaja. These two eyes are Visvamitra and Jamadagni: this one (the right) is Visvamitra and this one (the left), Jamadagni. These two nostrils are Vasishtha and Kasyapa: this one (the right) is Vasishtha and this one (the left), Kasyapa. The tongue is Atri, for through the tongue food is eaten. Atri is the same as atti (eating). He who knows this becomes the eater of everything and everything becomes his food. Chapter III—The Two Forms of Brahman 1 Verily, there are two forms of Brahman: gross and subtle, mortal and immortal, limited and unlimited, definite and indefinite. 2 The gross form is that which is other than air and akasa. It is mortal, limited and definite. The essence of that which is gross, which is mortal, which is limited and which is definite is the sun that shines, for it (the sun) is the essence of the three elements. 3 Now the subtle: It is air and akasa. It is immortal, it is unlimited and it is indefinite. The essence of that which is subtle, which is immortal, which is unlimited and which is indefinite is the Person (Purusha) in the solar orb, for that Person is the essence of the two elements. This is with reference to the gods. 4 Now with reference to the body: The gross form is that which is other than the air and the akasa that is in the body. It is mortal, it is limited and it is definite. The essence of that which is gross, which is mortal, which is limited and which is definite is the eye; for it (the eye) is the essence of the three elements. 5 Now the subtle: It is the air and the akasa that is in the body. It is immortal, it is unlimited and it is indefinite. The essence of that which is subtle, which is immortal, which is unlimited and which is indefinite is the person (purusha) that is in the right eye, for that person is the essence of the two elements. 6 The form of that person is like a cloth dyed with turmeric, or like grey sheep's wool, or like Part 2 19"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"the scarlet insect called Indragopa, or like a tongue of fire, or like a white lotus, or like a flash of lightning.

Chapter IV—Yajnavalkya and Maitreyi (I) 1 \"Maitreyi, my dear,\" said Yajnavalkya, \"I am going to renounce this life. Let me make a final settlement between you and Katyayani (his other wife).\" 2 Thereupon Maitreyi said: \"Venerable Sir, if indeed the whole earth, full of wealth, belonged to me, would I be immortal through that?\" \"No,\" replied Yajnavalkya, \"your life would be just like that of people who have plenty. Of Immortality, however, there is no hope through wealth.\" 3 Then Maitreyi said: \"What should I do with that which would not make me immortal? Tell me, venerable Sir, of that alone which you know to be the only means of attaining Immortality.\" 4 Yajnavalkya replied: \"My dear, you have been my beloved even before, and now you say what is after my heart. Come, sit down; I will explain it to you. As I explain it, meditate on what I say.\" 5 Then Yajnavalkya said: \"Verily, not for the sake of the husband, my dear, is the husband loved, but he is loved for the sake of the self which, in its true nature, is one with the Supreme Self. \"Verily, not for the sake of the wife, my dear, is the wife loved, but she is loved for the sake of the self. \"Verily, not for the sake of the sons, my dear, are the sons loved, hut they are loved for the sake of the self. \"Verily, not for the sake of wealth, my dear, is wealth loved, but it is loved for the sake of the self. \"Verily, not for the sake of the brahmin, my dear, is the brahmin loved, but he is loved for the sake of the self. \"Verily, not for the sake of the kshatriya, my dear, is the kshatriya loved, but he is loved for the sake of the self. \"Verily, not for the sake of the worlds, my dear, are the worlds loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self. \"Verily, not for the sake of the gods, my dear, are the gods loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self. \"Verily, not for the sake of the beings, my dear, are the beings loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self.

Janaka, Emperor of Videha, performed a sacrifice in which gifts were freely distributed among the priests. Brahmin scholars from the countries of Kuru and Panchala were assembled there. Emperor Tanaka of Videha wished to know which of these brahmins was the most erudite Vedic scholar. So he confined a thousand cows in a pen and fastened on the horns of each ten padas of gold. 2 He said to them: \"Venerable brahmins, let him among you who is the best Vedic scholar drive these cows home.\" None of the brahmins dared. Then Yajnavalkya said to one of his pupils: \"Dear Samsrava, drive these cows home.\" He drove them away. The brahmins were furious and said: \"How does he dare to call himself the best Vedic scholar among us?\" Now among them there was Asvala, the hotri priest of Emperor Janaka of Videha. He asked Yajnavalkya: \"Are you indeed the best Vedic scholar among us, O Yajnavalkya?\" He replied: \"I bow to the best Vedic scholar, but I just wish to have these cows.\" Thereupon the hotri Asvala determined to question him. 3 \"Yajnavalkya,\" said he, \"since everything here (i.e. connected with the sacrifice) is overtaken by death, since everything is overcome by death, by what means does the sacrificer free himself from the reach of death?\" \"Through the hotri priest and the organ of speech looked upon as fire. The sacrificer's organ of speech is the hotri. This organ of speech is fire; this fire is the hotri; this fire is the means to liberation; this is complete liberation.\" 4 \"Yajnavalkya,\" said he, \"since everything here is overtaken by day and night, since everything is overcome by day and night, by what means does the sacrificer free himself from the reach of day and night?\" \"Through the adhvaryu priest and the eye looked upon as the sun. The sacrificer's eye is the adhvaryu. This eye is the sun. This sun is the adhvaryu; this sun is the means to liberation; this is complete liberation.\" 5 \"Yajnavalkya,\" said he, \"since everything here is overtaken by the bright and dark fortnights, since everything is overcome by the bright and dark fortnights, by what means does the sacrificer free himself from the reach of the bright and dark fortnights?\" \"Through the udgatri priest and the vital breath looked upon as the air. This vital breath is the udgatri. This vital breath is the air; this air is the udgatri; this air is the means to liberation; this is complete liberation.\" 26"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"6 \"Yajnavalkya,\" said he, \"since the sky is, as it were, without a support, by means of what support does the sacrificer go to heaven?\" \"Through the Brahma priest and the mind looked upon as the moon. The sacrificer's mind is the Brahma. The mind is the moon; this moon is the Brahma; this moon is the means to liberation; this is complete liberation. So far about the ways of liberation; now about the meditation based upon resemblance. 7 \"Yajnavalkya,\" said he, \"how many kinds of Rig verses will the hotri priest use today in this sacrifice?\" \"Three kinds.\" \"And which are these three?\" \"The introductory, the sacrificial and the eulogistic as the third.\" \"What does he (the sacrificer) win through them?\" \"All this that has life.\" 8 \"Yajnavalkya,\" said he, \"how many kinds of oblations will the adhvaryu priest offer today in this sacrifice?\" \"Three.\" \"And which are these three?\" \"Those which, when offered, blaze upward; those which, when offered, make a great noise; and those which, when offered, sink down.\" \"What does he (the sacrificer) win through them?\" \"By those which, when offered, blaze upward, he wins the world of the gods; for the world of the gods shines bright, as it were. By those which, when offered, make a great noise, he wins the world of the Manes; for this world of the Manes is excessively noisy. By those which, when offered, sink down, he wins the world of men; for the world of men is down below.\" 9 \"Yajnavalkya,\" said he, \"with how many gods does the Brahma priest seated on the right protect the sacrifice today?\" \"With one.\" \"Which is that one?\" \"The mind. The mind is indeed infinite and infinite are the Visve—devas.

Chapter II—Yajnavalkya and Artabhaga 1 Then Artabhaga, of the line of Jaratkaru, questioned him. \"Yajnavalkya,\" said he, \"how many grahas (organs) are there and how many atigrahas (objects)?\" \"Eight grahas,\" he replied, \"and eight atigrahas.\" \"And which are these eight grahas and eight atigrahas?\" 2 \"The Prana (the nose), indeed, is the graha; it is controlled by the apana (odour), the atigraha; for one smells odours through apana (the air breathed in). 3 \"The vak (the organ of speech), indeed, is the graha; it is controlled by the atigraha, name; for one utters names through the organ of speech. 4 \"The tongue, indeed, is the graha; it is controlled by the atigraha, taste; for one knows tastes by the tongue. 5 \"The eye, indeed, is the graha; it is controlled by the atigraha colour; for one sees colours through the eye. 6 \"The ear, indeed, is the graha; it is controlled by the atigraha sound; for one hears sounds with the ear. 7 \"The mind, indeed, is the graha; it is controlled by the atigraha desire; for through the mind one cherishes desires. 8 \"The hands, indeed, are the graha; they are controlled by the atigraha, work; for one performs work by means of the hands. 9 \"The skin, indeed, is the graha; it is controlled by the atigraha, touch; for one feels touch through the skin. These are the eight grahas and eight atigrahas.\" 10 \"Yajnavalkya,\" said he, \"since all this is the food of death, who, pray, is that god to whom death is the food?\" Part 3 28"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"\"Fire, indeed, is death; it is the food of water. One who knows this conquers further death.\" 11 \"Yajnavalkya,\" said he, \"when this liberated person dies, do his organs depart from him or not?\" \"No,\" replied Yajnavalkya, \"they merge in him only. The body swells, is inflated and in that state the dead body lies at rest.\" 12 \"Yajnavalkya,\" said he, \"when such a man dies, what is it that does not leave him?\" \"The name. For the name is infinite and infinite are the Visve—devas. He who knows this wins thereby an infinite world.\" 13 \"Yajnavalkya,\" said he, \"when the vocal organ of this dead person merges in fire, the nose in air, the eye in the sun, the mind in the moon, the ear in the quarters, the body in the earth, the akasa (space) in the heart in the external akasa, the hair on the body in the herbs, the hair on the head in the trees and the blood and semen are deposited in water, where is that person then?\" Yajnavalkya said: \"Give me your hand, dear Artabhaga. We shall decide this between ourselves; we cannot do it in a crowd.\" Then they went out and deliberated and what they talked about was karma (work) and what they praised was karma: one becomes good through good karma and evil through evil karma. Thereupon Artabhaga, of the line of Jaratkaru, held his peace. Chapter III—Yajnavalkya and Bhujyu 1 Next Bhujyu, the grandson of Lahya, questioned him. \"Yajnavalkya,\" said he, \"we were travelling in the country of Madra as religious students, when we came to the house of Patanchala, of the line of Kapi. His daughter was possessed by a gandharva. We asked him: 'Who are you?' He said: 'I am Sudhanvan, of the line of Angiras.' While asking him about the limits of the world, we said: 'Where were the descendants of Parikshit?' And likewise I ask you, Yajnavalkya, where were the descendants of Parikshit? Tell me, where were the descendants of Parikshit?\" 2 Yajnavalkya said: \"The gandharva, I suppose, told you that they went where those who perform the Horse—sacrifice go.\" \"And where do they go who have performed the Horse—sacrifice?\" \"Thirty—two times the space traversed by the sun's chariot in a day makes this plane (loka); around it, covering twice the area, is the world (prithivi); around the world, covering twice the area, is the ocean. Now, as is the edge of a razor or the wing of a fly, so is there just that much space between the two halves of the cosmic shell. Through that opening they go out. \"Fire, in the form of a falcon, delivered them to Vayu. Vayu, placing them in itself, took them where previous performers of the Horse—sacrifice were.\" Part 3 29"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Thus did the gandharva praise Vayu. Therefore Vayu alone is the aggregate of all individuals. He who knows this, as stated above, conquers further death. Thereupon Bhujyu, the grandson of Lahya, held his peace. Chapter IV—Yajnavalkya and Ushasta 1 Then Ushasta, the son of Chakra, questioned him. \"Yajnavalkya,\" said he, \"explain to me the Brahman that is immediately and directly perceived—the self that is within all.\" \"This is your self that is within all.\" \"Which self is within all, Yajnavalkya?\" \"That which breathes through the prana is your self that is within all. That which moves downward through the apana is your self that is within all. That which pervades through the vyana is your self that is within all. That which goes out with the udana is your self that is within all. This is your self that is within all.\" 2 Ushasta, the son of Chakra, said: \"You have explained it as one might say: 'Such is a cow,' 'Such is a horse.' Tell me precisely the Brahman that is immediate and direct—the self that is within all.\" \"This is your self that is within all.\" \"Which is within all, Yajnavalkya?\" \"You cannot see the seer of seeing; you cannot hear the hearer of hearing; you cannot think of the thinker of thinking; you cannot know the knower of knowing. This is your self that is within all; everything else but this is perishable.\" Thereupon Ushasta, the son of Chakra, held his peace. Chapter V—Yajnavalkya and Kahola 1 Next Kahola, the son of Kushitaka, questioned him. \"Yajnavalkya,\" said he, \"explain to me the Brahman that is directly and immediately perceived—the self that is within all.\" \"This is your self that is within all.\" \"Which self is within all, Yajnavalkya ?\" \"It is that which transcends hunger and thirst, grief, delusion, old age and death. Having realized this Self, brahmins give up the desire for sons, the desire for wealth and the desire for the worlds and lead the life of religious mendicants. That which is the desire for sons is the desire for wealth and that which is the desire for wealth is the desire for the worlds; for both these are but desires. Therefore a brahmin, after he is done with scholarship, should try to live on that strength which comes of scholarship. After he is done with that strength and scholarship, he becomes meditative and after he is done with both meditativeness and non—meditativeness, he becomes a knower of Brahman. \"How does the knower of Brahman behave? Howsoever he may behave, he is such indeed. Everything else but this is perishable.\" Part 3 30"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Thereupon Kahola, the son of Kushitaka, held his peace. Chapter VI—Yajnavalkya and Gargi (I) 1 Then Gargi, the daughter of Vachaknu, questioned him. \"Yajnavalkya ,\" said she, \"if all this is pervaded by water, by what, pray, is water pervaded?\" \"By air, O Gargi.\" \"By what, pray, is air pervaded?\" \"By the sky, O Gargi.\" \"By what is the sky pervaded?\" \"By the world of the gandharvas, O Gargi.\" \"By what is the world of the gandharvas pervaded?\" \"By the world of the sun, O Gargi. \"By what is the world of the sun pervaded?\" \"By the world of the moon, O Gargi.\" \"By what is the world of the moon pervaded?\" \"By the world of the stars, O Gargi.\" \"By what is the world of the stars pervaded?\" \"By the world of the gods, O Gargi.\" \"By what is the world of the gods pervaded?\" \"By the world of Indra, O Gargi. \"By what is the world of Indra pervaded?\" \"By the World of Virij, O Gargi. \"By what is the World of Virij pervaded?\" \"By the World of Hiranyagarbha, O Gargi.\" \"By what, pray, is the World of Hiranyagarbha pervaded?\" \"Do not, O Gargi,\" said he, \"question too much, lest your head should fall off. You are questioning too much about a deity about whom we should not ask too much. Do not ask too much, O Gargi.\" Thereupon Gargi, the daughter of Vachaknu, held her peace. Chapter VII—Yajnavalkya and Uddalaka 1 Then Uddalaka, the son of Aruna, questioned him. \"Yajnavalkya,\" said he, \"in the country of Madra we lived in the house of Patanchala, of the line of Kapi, studying the scriptures on the sacrifices. His wife was possessed by a gandharva. We asked him: 'Who are you?' He said: 'I am Kabandha, the son of Atharvan.' He said to Patanchala Kapya and those studying the scriptures on the sacrifices: 'O descendant of Kapi, do you know that Sutra by which this world, the other world and all beings are held together?' Patanchala Kapya said: 'I do not know it, venerable Sir.' Then he said to Patanchala Kapya and those studying the scriptures on the sacrifices: 'O descendant of Kapi, do you know that Inner Controller who controls this world, the next world and all beings?' Patanchala Kapya said: 'I do not know him, venerable Sir.' Then he said to Patanchala Kapya and those studying the scriptures on the sacrifices: 'O descendant of Kapi, he who knows that Sutra and that Inner Controller indeed knows Part 3 31"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Brahman; he knows the worlds, he knows the gods, he knows the Vedas, he knows the beings, he knows the self, he knows everything.'

Tell us what you know.\" 2 Yajnavalkya said: \"Vayu, O Gautama, is that Sutra. By Vayu, as by a thread, O Gautama, are this world, the other world and all beings held together. Therefore, O Gautama, they say of a person who dies that his limbs have been loosened; for they are held together by Vayu as by a thread.\" \"Quite so, Yajnavalkya. Now describe the Inner Controller.\" 3 Yajnavalkya said: \"He who inhabits the earth, yet is within the earth, whom the earth does not know, whose body the earth is and who controls the earth from within—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. 4—14 \"He who inhabits water, yet is within water, whom water does not know, whose body water is and who controls water from within—He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. \"He who inhabits fire, yet is within fire, whom fire does not know, whose body fire is and who controls fire from within —He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. \"He who inhabits the sky, yet is within the sky, whom the sky does not know, whose body the sky is and who controls the sky from within —He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. \"He who inhabits the air, yet is within the air, whom the air does not know, whose body the air is and who controls the air from within —He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. \"He who inhabits heaven, yet is within heaven, whom heaven does not know, whose body heaven is and who controls heaven from within —He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. \"He who inhabits the sun, yet is within the sun, whom the sun does not know, whose body the sun is and who controls the sun from within —He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. \"He who inhabits the quarters of space, yet is within them, whom the quarters do not know, whose body the quarters are and who controls the quarters from within —He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. \"He who inhabits the moon and stars, yet is within the moon and stars, whom the moon and stars do not know, whose body the moon and stars are and who controls the moon and stars from within —He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal. \"He who inhabits the akasa, yet is within the akasa, whom the akasa does not know, whose body the akasa is and who controls the akasa from within —He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal.

Please instruct me further about Liberation itself.\" At this Yajnavalkya was afraid that the intelligent emperor was driving him to give the solution of all his questions. 34 \"That entity (the self), after enjoying himself and roaming in the dream state and merely witnessing the results of merits and demerits, hastens back in the reverse way to its former condition, the waking state. 35 \"Just as a heavily loaded cart moves along, creaking, even so the self identified with the body, being presided over by the Self which is all consciousness (the Supreme Self), moves along, groaning, when breathing becomes difficult at the approach of death. 36 \"When this body grows thin—becomes emaciated or disease—then, as a mango or a fig or a fruit of the peepul tree becomes detached from its stalk, so does this infinite being completely detaching himself from the parts of the body, again move on, in the same way that he came, to another body for the remanisfestation of his vital breath (prana). 37 \"Just as, when a king comes, the ugras appointed to deal with crimes; the sutas and the leaders of the village await him with food and drink and lodgings ready, saying: ‘Here he comes, here he comes,’ even so, for the person who knows about the fruits of his own Part 4 51"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"work, there wait all the elements, saying: ‘Here comes Brahman, here he comes.’ 38 \"Just as, when the king wishes to depart, the ugras appointed to deal with crimes, the sutas and the leaders of the village gather around him, even so do all the organs gather around the self, at the time of death, when it struggles for breath.\" Chapter IV—Death and the Hereafter 1 Yajnavalkya continued: \"Now, when that self becomes weak and unconscious, as it were, the organs gather around it. Having wholly seized these particles of light, the self comes to the heart. When the presiding deity of the eye turns back from all sides, the dying man fails to notice colour. 2 \"The eye becomes united with the subtle body; then people say: ‘He does not see.’ The nose becomes united with the subtle body; then they say: ‘He does not smell.’ The tongue becomes united with the subtle body; then they say: ‘He does not taste.’ The vocal organ becomes united with the subtle body; then they say: ‘He does not speak.’ The ear becomes united with the subtle body; then they say: ‘He does not hear.’ The mind becomes united with the subtle body; then they say: ‘He does not think.’ The skin becomes united with the subtle body; then they say: ‘He does not touch.’ The intellect becomes united with the subtle body; then they say: ‘He does not know.’ \"The upper end of the heart lights up and by that light the self departs, either through the eye or through the head or through any other part (aperture) of the body. \"And when the self departs, the vital breath follows and when the vital breath departs, all the organs follow. \"Then the self becomes endowed with a particular consciousness and passes on to the body to be attained by that consciousness. \"Knowledge, work and past experience follow the self. 3 \"And just as a leech moving on a blade of grass reaches its end, takes hold of another and draws itself together towards it, so does the self, after throwing off this body, that is to say, after making it unconscious, take hold of another support and draw itself together towards it. 4 \"And just as a goldsmith takes a small quantity of gold and fashions out of it another—a newer and better—form, so does the self, after throwing off this body, that is to say, after making it unconscious, fashion another—a newer and better—form, suited to the Manes, or the gandharvas, or the gods, or Viraj, or Hiranyagarbha, or other beings. 5 \"That self is indeed Brahman; it is also identified with the intellect, the mind and the vital breath, with the eyes and ears, with earth, water, air and akasa, with fire and with what is other than fire, with desire and with absence of desire, with anger and with absence of Part 4 52"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"anger, with righteousness and unrighteousness, with all—it is identified, as is well known, with this (i.e. what is perceived) and with that (i.e. what is inferred).

It becomes virtuous through virtuous action and evil through evil action. \"Others, however, say that the self is identified with desire alone. As is its desire, so is its resolution; and as is its resolution, so is its deed; and whatever deed it does, that it reaps. 6 \"Regarding this there is the following verse: \"Because of attachment, the transmigrating self, together with its work, attains that result to which its subtle body or mind clings. Having exhausted in the other world the results of whatever work it did in this life, it returns from that world to this world for fresh work.’ \"Thus does the man who desires transmigrate. But as to the man who does not desire—who is without desire, who is freed from desire, whose desire is satisfied, whose only object of desire is the Self—his organs do not depart. Being Brahman, he merges in Brahman. 7 \"Regarding this there are the following verses: \"When all the desires that dwell in his heart are got rid of, then does the mortal man become immortal and attain Brahman in this very body.’ \"Just as the slough of a snake lies, dead and cast away, on an ant—hill, even so lies this body. Then the self becomes disembodied and immortal Spirit, the Supreme Self (Prana), Brahman, the Light.\" Janaka, Emperor of Videha, said: \"I give you, venerable Sir, a thousand cows.\" 8 \"Regarding this there are the following verses: ‘The subtle, ancient path stretching far away has been touched (reached) by me; nay, I have realized it myself. By this path the wise, the knowers of Brahman, move on to the celestial sphere (Liberation) after the fall of this body, having been freed even while living.’ 9 ‘Some speak of it as white, others as blue, grey, green, or red. This path is realized by a knower of Brahman and is trod by whoever knows Brahman, has done good deeds and is identified with the Supreme Light.’ 10 ‘Into blinding darkness enter those who worship ignorance; into a greater darkness than that, as it were, enter those who are devoted to knowledge.’ 11 ‘Cheerless indeed are those worlds covered with blinding darkness.

Knowing that Brahman, I am immortal.’ 18 ‘They who know the Vital Breath (Prana) of the vital breath (prana), the Eye of the eye, the Ear of the ear, the Mind of the mind, have realized the ancient, primordial Brahman.’ 19 ‘Through the mind alone is Brahman to be realized. There is in It no diversity. He goes from death to death who sees in It, as it were, diversity.’ 20 ‘Unknowable and constant, It should be realized in one form only. The Self is free from taint, beyond the akasa, birthless, infinite and unchanging.’ 21 ‘The intelligent seeker of Brahman, learning about the Self alone, should practise wisdom (prajna). Let him not think of too many words, for that is exhausting to the organ of speech.’ 22 \"That great, unborn Self, which is identified with the intellect (vijnanamaya) and which dwells in the midst of the organs, lies in the akasa within the heart. It is the controller of all, the lord of all, the ruler of all. It does not become greater through good deeds or smaller through evil deeds. It is the lord of all, the ruler of all beings, the protector of all beings. It is the dam that serves as the boundary to keep the different worlds apart. The brahmins seek to realize It through the study of the Vedas, through sacrifices, through gifts and through austerity which does not lead to annihilation. Knowing It alone one becomes a sage (muni). Wishing for this World (i.e. the Self) alone, monks renounce their homes.

That which is the desire for sons is the desire for wealth and that which is the desire for wealth is the desire for the worlds; for both these, indeed, are but desires. ‘This Self is That which has been described as Not this, not this. It is imperceptible, for It is not perceived; undecaying, for It never decays; unattached, for It is never attached; unfettered, for It never feels pain and never suffers injury. ‘Him who knows this these two thoughts do not overcome: For this I did an evil deed and For this I did a good deed.

Therefore one should know the nature of That alone. Knowing It one is not touched by evil action.’ \"Therefore he who knows It as such becomes self—controlled, calm, withdrawn into himself, patient and collected; he sees the Self in his own self (body); he sees all as the Self. Evil does not overcome him, but he overcomes all evil. Evil does not afflict him, but he consumes all evil. He becomes sinless, taintless, free from doubts and a true Brahmana (knower of Brahman).

He who knows this obtains wealth. 25 That great, unborn Self is undecaying, immortal, undying, fearless; It is Brahman (infinite). Brahman is indeed fearless. He who knows It as such becomes the fearless Brahman. Chapter V—Yajnavalkya and Maitreyi (II) 1 Yajnavalkya had two wives: Maitreyi and Katyayani. Of these, Maitreyi was conversant with the Knowledge of Brahman, while Katyayani had an essentially feminine outlook. One day Yajnavalkya, when he wished to embrace another mode of life, 2 Said: \"Maitreyi, my dear, I am going to renounce this life to become a monk. Let me make a final settlement between you and Katyayani.\" 3 Maitreyi said: \"Venerable Sir, if indeed the whole earth full of wealth belonged to me, would I be immortal through that or not?\" \"No,\" replied Yajnavalkya, \"your life would be just like Part 4 55"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"that of people who have plenty. Of Immortality, however, there is no hope through wealth.\" 4 Then Maitreyi said: \"What should I do with that which would not make me immortal?

If you wish, my dear, I shall explain it to you. As I explain it, meditate on what I say.\" 6 And he said: \"Verily, not for the sake of the husband, my dear, is the husband loved, but he is loved for the sake of the self which, in its true nature, is one with the Supreme Self. \"Verily, not for the sake of the wife, my dear, is the wife loved, but she is loved for the sake of the self. \"Verily, not for the sake of the sons, my dear, are the sons loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self. \"Verily, not for the sake of wealth, my dear, is wealth loved, but it is loved for the sake of the self. \"Verily, not for the sake of the animals, my dear, are the animals loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self. \"Verily, not for the sake of the brahmin, my dear, is the brahmin loved, but he is loved for the sake of the self. \"Verily, not for the sake of the kshatriya, my dear, is the kshatriya loved, but he is loved for the sake of the self. \"Verily, not for the sake of the worlds, my dear, are the worlds loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self. \"Verily, not for the sake of the gods, my dear, are the gods loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self. \"Verily, not for the sake of the Vedas, my dear, are the Vedas loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self. \"Verily, not for the sake of the beings, my dear, are the beings loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self. \"Verily, not for the sake of the All, my dear, is the All loved, but it is loved for the sake of the self. \"Verily, my dear Maitreyi, it is the Self that should be realized—should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon.

Indeed, I do not at all understand this.\" He replied: \"Certainly I am not saying anything bewildering, my dear.

Infinite is That Brahman, infinite in this manifested universe. From the Infinite Brahman proceeds the infinite. After the realization of the Great Identity or after the cosmic dissolution, when the infinity of the infinite universe merges in the Infinite Brahman, there remains the Infinite Brahman alone. Om is the Akasa Brahman—the primeval akasa. It is the akasa containing air, says the son of Kauravayarn. It (Om) is the Veda—thus the knowers of Brahman know; for through it one knows what is to be known. Chapter II—The Three Great Disciplines 1 Prajapati had three kinds of offspring: gods, men and demons (asuras). They lived with Prajapati, practising the vows of brahmacharins. After finishing their term, the gods said to him: \"Please instruct us, Sir.\" To them he uttered the syllable da and asked: \"Have you understood?\" They replied: \"We have. You said to us, ‘Control yourselves (damyata).’ He said: \"Yes, you have understood.\" 2 Then the men said to him: \"Please instruct us, Sir\" To them he uttered the same syllable da and asked: \"Have you understood?\" They replied: \"We have. You said to us, ‘Give (datta).’ He said: ‘Yes, you have understood. 3 Then the demons said to him: \"Please instruct us, Sir.\" To them he uttered the same syllable da and asked: \"Have you understood?\" They replied: \"We have. You said to us: ‘Be compassionate (dayadhvam).’ He said: \"Yes, you have understood.\" That very thing is repeated even today by the heavenly voice, in the form of thunder, as \"Da,\" \"Da,\" \"Da,\" which means: \"Control yourselves,\" \"Give,\" and \"Have compassion.\" Therefore one should learn these three: self—control, giving and mercy. Chapter III—Brahman as the Heart 1 Prajapati is this—the heart (intellect). It (the heart) is Brahman. It is all. Hridayam (the heart) consists of three syllables. One syllable is hri; and to him who knows this, his own people and others bring presents. One syllable is da; and to him who knows this, his own people and others give their powers. One syllable is yam; and he who knows this goes to heaven. Chapter IV—Meditation on Satya Brahman 59"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"1 That intellect Brahman was verily this—satya alone.

And his enemy is thus conquered and becomes non—existent—yes, whosoever knows this great, glorious first—born one as the Satya Brahman; for Satya indeed is that Brahman. Chapter V—In Praise of Satya Brahman 1 In the beginning this universe was water alone. That water produced Satya. Satya is Brahman. Brahman produced Prajapati and Prajapati the gods. Those gods meditate on Satya. This name Satya consists of three syllables. Sa is one syllable, ti is one syllable and ya is one syllable. The first and last syllables are the truth. In the middle is untruth. This untruth is enclosed on both sides by truth; thus truth preponderates. Untruth does not hurt him who knows this. 2 Now, that which is Satya is the sun—the being who dwells in yonder orb and the being who is in the right eye. These two rest on each other. The former (the being in the sun) rests on the latter (the being in the right eye) through his rays and the latter rests on the former through his organs. When the individual self is about to leave the body, he sees the solar orb clearly (i.e. without rays). Those rays no longer come to him. 3 Of this being who is in the solar orb, the syllable Bhuh is the head, for there is one head and there is this one syllable; the word Bhuvah is the arms, for there are two arms and there are these two syllables; the word Svah is the legs, for there are two legs and there are these two syllables. His secret name is Ahar. He who knows this destroys evil and leaves it behind. 4 Of this being who is in the right eye, the syllable Bhur is the head, for there is one head and there is this one syllable; the word Bhuvar is the arms, for there are two arms and there are these two syllables; the word Svar is the legs, for there are two legs and there are these two syllables. His secret name is Aham. He who knows this destroys evil and leaves it behind. Chapter VI—Meditation on Brahman as the Mind 1 This being identified with the mind and resplendent by nature is realized by yogis within the heart as of the size of a grain of rice or barley. He is the lord of all, the ruler of all and governs all this —whatever there is.

It is called lightning (vidyut) because it scatters (vidanat) darkness. Whosoever knows this—that lightning is Brahman—scatters the evils that are ranged against him; for lightning is indeed Brahman. Chapter VIII—Meditation on the Vedas as a Cow 1 One should meditate upon speech (the Vedas) as a cow. She (speech) has four teats: the sounds Svaha; Vashat, Hanta and Svadha. The gods live on two of her teats, Svaha and Vashat; men, on Hanta; and the Manes on Svadha. Her bull is the vital breath (prana) and her calf, the mind. Chapter IX——Meditation on the Vaisvanara Fire 1 This fire which is within a man and digests food that is eaten is Vaisvanara. Its sound is that which one hears by stopping the ears. When a man is about to leave the body, he hears this sound no more. Chapter X——The Path of the Departing Soul 1 When a man departs from this world, he reaches the air. The air opens there for him as wide as the hole of a chariot wheel. Through this opening he ascends and reaches the sun. The sun opens there for him as wide as the hole of a lambara. By this opening he ascends and reaches the moon. The moon opens there for him as wide as the hole of a drum. By this opening he ascends and reaches a World free from grief and cold. There he dwells for endless years. Chapter XI—The Supreme Austerities 1 The supreme austerity is indeed that a man suffers when he is ill. He who knows this wins the highest world. The supreme austerity is indeed that a man, after death, is carried to the forest. He who knows this wins the highest world. The supreme austerity is indeed that a man, after death, is laid on the fire. He who knows this wins the highest world. Chapter XII—Meditation on Food and the Vital Breath as Brahman 1 Some say that food is Brahman; but this is not so, for food decays without the vital breath (prana). Others say that the vital breath is Brahman; but this is not so, for the vital breath dries up without food. These two deities (food and the vital breath), when they become united, attain the highest state (Brahmanhood). Thus reflecting, Pratrida said to his father: \"What good, indeed, can I do him who knows this and what evil can I do him either?\" Part 5 61"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"His father answered, stopping him with a gesture of his hand: \"Oh, no, Pratrida; for who would attain the highest merely by being identified with these two?\" Further, he (the father) said to him this: \"It is vi; food is verily vi, for all these creatures rest (visanti) on food. It is ram; the vital breath is ram, for all these creatures delight (ramante) in the vital breath.\" All creatures rest on him, all creatures delight in him, who knows this. Chapter XIII—Meditation on the Vital Breath 1 One should meditate on the vital breath as the Uktha. The vital breath is the Uktha, for it raises up (utthapayati) all this universe. From him who knows this there is raised a son who is a knower of the vital breath and he wins union with and abode in the same world as the Uktha. 2 One should meditate upon the vital breath as the Yajus. The vital breath is the Yajus, for all these beings are united (yujyante) with one another if the vital breath is present. All beings are united to give eminence to him who knows this and he wins union with and abode in the same world as the Yajus (vital breath). 3 One should meditate upon the vital breath as the Saman. The vital breath is the Saman, for all these beings meet (samyanchi) if the Saman (vital breath) is present. For the sake of him who knows this all beings are united and they succeed in giving him eminence; and he wins union with and abode in the same world as the Saman. 4 One should meditate upon the vital breath as the Kshatra. The vital breath is the Kshatra, for the vital breath protects (trayate) the body from wounds (khanitoh). He who knows this attains the Kshatra (vital breath) which needs no other protector and he wins union with and abode in the same world as the Kshatra. Chapter XIV—The Sacred Gayatri 1 The words Bhumi (earth), Antariksha (sky) and Dyaus (heaven) form eight syllables and the first foot of the Gayatri consists of eight syllables. So the three worlds constitute the first foot of the Gayatri. Whosoever knows this about the first foot of the Gayatri wins all that is in the three worlds. 2 Richah, Yajumshi and Samani form eight syllables and the second foot of the Gayatri consists of eight syllables. So these three Vedas constitute the second foot of the Gayatri. Whosoever thus knows the second foot of the Gayatri wins as much as that treasury of knowledge, the three Vedas, has to confer. 3 Prana, apana and vyana form eight syllables and the third foot of the Gayatri. consists of Part 5 62"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"eight syllables. So these three forms of the vital breath constitute the third foot of the Gayatri. Whosoever knows this about the third foot of the Gayatri wins all the living beings that are in the universe. Now, its turiya, apparently visible (darsata) and supramundane (paroraja) foot is this—sun that glows yonder. That which is fourth is called turiya. He (the being in the solar orb) is apparently visible (darsata), because he is seen, as it were, by the yogis. He is supramundane (paroraja), because he shines alone on the whole universe as its overlord. He who thus knows the fourth foot of the Gayatri shines with splendour and glory. 4 That Gayatri rests on that fourth, apparently visible, supramundane foot. And that, again, rests on truth. The eye is truth, for the eye is indeed truth. Therefore, even today, if two persons come disputing, one saying: \"I saw it,\" and another: \"I heard of it,\" we should trust the one who says: \"I saw it. That truth rests on strength. The vital breath (prana) is strength. Hence truth rests on the vital breath. Therefore they say that strength is more powerful than truth. Thus the Gayatri is based on the vital breath within the body. That Gayatri protected the gayas. The organs are the gayas; therefore the Gayatri protected (tatre) the organs. Because it protected the organs, it is called the Gayatri. The Savitri verse, which the teacher communicates to the pupil, is no other than this. It saves the organs of the pupil to whom it is imparted by the teacher. 5 Some impart to the pupil the Savitri which is in the Anushtubh metre, saying: \"The goddess of speech is Anushtubh; so we shall impart it to him.\" But one should not do that. One should impart only that Savitri which is Gayatri. Verily, if one who knows this accepts too much as a gift, as it were, it is not enough for even one foot of the Gayatri. 6 If he (the knower of the Gayatri) accepts as a gift the three worlds full of wealth, he will be receiving the fruit of knowing only the first foot of the Gayatri. If he accepts as a gift as much as this treasury of knowledge, the Vedas, has to confer, he will be receiving the fruit of knowing only the second foot of the Gayatri.

As soon as the king saw him, he said: \"Is it you, boy?\" He replied: \"Yes, Sir.\" Then the king asked: \"Have you been taught by your father?\" \"Yes,\" he replied. 2 The king said: \"Do you know how people, after departing from this life, proceed on different paths?\" \"No,\" he replied. \"Do you know how they return to this world?\" \"No,\" he replied. \"Do you know why the other world is never filled up even though so many people go there again and again?\" \"No,\" he replied. \"Do you know after how many offerings of oblations the water (the liquid oblation) becomes endowed with a human voice, rises up and speaks?\" \"No,\" he replied. \"Do you know the means of access to the path leading to the gods or to that leading to the Manes, that is to say, through what deeds men attain the path leading to the gods or that leading to the Manes? We have heard the following words of the Mantra: ‘I have heard of the two paths for men, one leading to the Manes and the other to the gods. Going along them they (departed souls) are united with their destination. They (the paths) lie between the father (heaven) and the mother (earth).’ Svetaketu said: \"I do not know even one of these.\" 3 Then the king invited him to stay. But the boy, disregarding the invitation, hurried away. He went to his father and said: \"Did you not tell me before that you had fully instructed me?\" \"What then, my intelligent child?\" \"That fellow of a kshatriya asked me five questions and I did not know one of them.\" \"What were they?\" \"These,\" said Svetaketu and he recited them. 4 The father said: \"My child, believe me, whatever I myself knew, I told you.

Having created her, He placed her below and worshipped her. Therefore one should worship a woman, placing her below. He (Prajapati) extended His organ that projects and with it impregnated her. 3 Her lap is the sacrificial altar, her hair the sacrificial grass, her skin within the organ the lighted fire; the two labia of the vulva are the two stones of the soma—press. He who, knowing this, practises sexual intercourse wins as great a world as is won through the Vijapeya sacrifice; he acquires for himself the fruit of the good deeds of the woman. But he who, without knowing this, practises sexual intercourse turns over to the woman his own good deeds. 4 Having known this, Uddalaka the son of Aruna, Naka the son of Mudgala and Kumara—harita said: \"Many mortals, brahmins only in name, perform the sexual act without knowledge of what has been said and depart from this world impotent and without merit.\" Even if this much semen—of one asleep or of one awake—is spilled, 5 He should touch it and repeat the following mantra: \"Whatever semen of mine has spilt on earth, whatever has flowed to plants, whatever to water, I reclaim it.\" With these words he should take the semen with his ring finger and thumb and rub it between his breasts or eyebrows, repeating the following mantra: \"Let the semen return to me, let Vigour come to me again, let glow and good fortune come to me again.

Therefore when she has removed the clothes of impurity and appears beautiful, he should approach her and speak to her. 7 If she does not willingly yield her body to him, he should buy her with presents. If she is still unyielding, he should strike her with a stick or with his hand and overcome her, repeating the following mantra: \"With power and glory I take away your glory.\" Thus she becomes discredited. 8 If she grants his desire, he should repeat the following mantra: \"With power and glory I give you glory.\" Thus they both become glorious. 9 If a man desires his wife with the thought: \"May she enjoy love with me,\" then, after inserting the member in her, joining mouth to mouth and stroking her organ, he should utter the following mantra: \"O semen, you have been produced from my every limb, especially from my heart through the essence of food you are the essence of the limbs.
