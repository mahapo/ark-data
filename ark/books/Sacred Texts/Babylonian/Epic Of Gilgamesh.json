This was the man to whom all things were known; t his was the king who knew the countries of the world. H e was wise, he saw mysteries and knew secret things , he brought us a tale of the days before the flood. He went on a long journey, was weary, worn-out with la bour, returning he rested, he engraved on a stone the who le story. When the gods created Gilgamesh they gave him a per fect body. Shamash the glorious sun endowed him wit h beauty, Adad the god of the storm endowed him with courage, the great gods made his beauty perfect, su rpassing all others, terrifying like a great wild bull. Two thir ds they made him god and one third man. In Uruk he built walls, a great rampart, and the te mple of blessed Eanna for the god of the firmament Anu, and for Ishtar the goddess of love. Look at it still to day: the outer wall where the cornice runs, it shin es with the brilliance of copper; and the inner wall, it has no equal. Touch the threshold, it is ancient.

But the men of Uruk muttered in their houses, ëGilgamesh sounds the tocsin for his amusement, hi s arrogance has no bounds by day or night. No son is left with his father, for Gilgamesh takes them all, even the children; yet the king should be a shepherd to his people. His lust l eaves no virgin to her lover, neither the warrior's daughter nor the wife of the noble; yet this is the shepherd of the city, wise, comely, and resolute.' The gods heard their lament, the gods of heaven cried to the Lord of Uruk, to Anu the god of Uruk: ëA goddess made him, strong as a savage bull, none can withstand his arms. No son is left with hi s father, for Gilgamesh takes them all; and is this t he king, the shepherd of his people? His lust leaves n o virgin to her lover, neither the warrior's daughter nor the wife of the noble. When Anu had heard their lamentation the gods cried to Aruru, the goddess of creation, ëYou made him, O Aruru; now create his equal; let it be as like him as his own reflection, his second self; stormy heart for stormy heart. Let the m contend together and leave Uruk in quiet.' So the goddess conceived an image in her mind, and it was of the stuff of Anu of the firmament. She dipped her hands in water and pinched off day, she let it fall in the wilderness, and noble Enkidu was created. There was virtue in him of the god of war, of Ninurta himself. His body was rough, he had long hair like a woman's; it waved like the hair of Nisaba, the goddess of corn. His body was covered with matted hair like Samugan's, the god of cattle. He was innocent of mankind; he knew nothing of the cultivated land. Enkidu ate grass in the hills with the gazelle and lurked with wild beasts at the water-holes; he had joy of the water with the herds of wild game. But there was a trapper who met him one day face to face at the drinking-hole, for the wild game had entered his territory. On three days he met him fac e to face, and the trapper was frozen with fear. He went back to his house with the game that he had caught, and he was dumb, benumbed with terror. His face was altered like that of one who has made a long journey. With awe in his heart he spoke to h is father: ëFather, there is a man, unlike any other, who come s down from the hills. He is the strongest in the w orld, he is like an immortal from heaven. He ranges over the hills w ith wild beasts and eats grass; the ranges through your land and comes down to the wells. I am afraid and dare not g o near him. He fills in the pits which I dig and te ars up-my traps set for the game; he helps the beasts to escape and now they slip through my fingers.' His father opened his mouth and said to the trapper , ëMy son, in Uruk lives Gilgamesh; no one has ever pre- vailed against him, he is strong as a star from hea ven. Go to Uruk, find Gilgamesh, extol the strength of this wild man. Ask him to give you a harlot, a wanton from th e temple of love; return with her, and let her woma n's power overpower this man. When next he comes down to drin k at the wells she will be there, stripped naked; a nd when he sees her beckoning he will embrace her, and then the wil d beasts will reject him.' So the trapper set out on his journey to Uruk and a ddressed himself to Gilgamesh saying, ëA man unlike any other is roaming now in the pastures; he is as strong as a s tar from heaven and I am afraid to approach him. He helps the wild"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The Epic Of Gilgamesh 5 game to escape; he fills in my pits and pulls up my traps.' Gilgamesh said, ëTrapper, go back, take wi th you a harlot, a child of pleasure. At the drinking hole she will st rip, and when, he sees her beckoning he will embrac e her and the game of the wilderness will. surely reject him.' Now the trapper returned, taking the harlot with hi m. After a three days' journey they came to the dri nking hole, and there they sat down; the harlot and the trapper sat . facing one another and waited for the game to co me. For the first day and for the second day the two sat waiting, but on the third day the herds came; they came down to dri nk and Enkidu was with them. The small wild creatures of the plains w ere glad of the water, and Enkidu with them, who at e grass with the gazelle and was born in the hills; and she saw him, the savage man, come from far-off in the hills. Th e trapper spoke to her: ëThere he is. Now, woman, make your breasts ba re, have no shame, do not delay but welcome his lov e. Let him see you naked, let him possess your body. When he comes near uncover yourself and lie with him; teach him, the savage man, your woman's art, for when he murmurs love to you t he wildí beasts that shared his life in the hills w ill reject him.' She was not ashamed to take him, she made herself n aked and welcomed his eagerness; as he lay on her m urmuring love she taught him the woman's art For six days an d seven nights they lay together, for Enkidu had fo rgotten his home in the hills; but when he was satisfied he went back t o the wild beasts. Then, when the gazelle saw him, they bolted away; when the wild creatures saw him they fled. Enkidu w ould have followed, but his body was bound a s thoug h with a cord, his knees gave way when he started to run, his swif tness was gone. And n o w the wild creatures had all fled away; Enkidu was grown w e a k , for wisdom was in him, and t he thoughts of a man were in his heart. So he retur ned and sat down at the woman's feet, and listened intently to what she said. ëYou are wise, Enkidu, and now you h ave become like a god. Why do you want to run wild with the beasts in the hills? Come with me. I will take you to strong -walled Uruk, to the blessed temple of Ishtar and of Anu, of love and of heaven there Gilgamesh lives, who is very strong, and like a wild bull he lords it over men.' When she had spoken Enkidu was pleased; he longed f or a comrade, for one who would understand his hear t. ë Come, woman, and take me to that holy temple, to th e house of Anu and of Ishtar, and to the place wher e Gilgamesh lords it over the people. I will challenge him boldly, I will cry out aloud in Uruk, \"I am the strongest her e, I have come to change the old order, I am he who was born in the h ills, I am he who is strongest of all.\"' She said, ëLet us go, and let him see your face. I know very well where Gilgamesh is in great Uruk. O Enkidu, there all the people are dressed in their gorgeous robes, every day is holiday, the young men and the girls are wonderful to see. How sweet they smell! All the great ones are roused from their beds. O Enkidu, you who love life, I wi ll show you Gilgamesh, a man of many moods; you shall look at h im well in his radiant manhood. His body is perfect in strength and maturity; he never rests by night or day. He is stronger than you, so leave your boasting. Shamash the glorious sun has given favours to Gilgamesh, and Anu of the heavens, and Enlil, and Ea the wise has given him d eep understanding. f tell you, even before you have lef t the wilderness, Gilgamesh will know in his dreams that you are coming.' Now Gilgamesh got up to tell his dream to his mothe r; Ninsun, one of the wise gods. ëMother, last nigh t I had a dream. I was full of joy, the young heroes were rou nd me and I walked through the night under the star s of the firmament, and one, a meteor of the stuff of Anu, f ell down from heaven. I tried to lift it but it pro ved too heavy. All the people of Uruk came round to see it, the common people jostled and the nobles thronged to kiss its feet; and to me its attraction was like the love of woman. They helped me, I braced my forehead and I raised it wit h thongs and brought it to you, and you yourself pronounced it m y brother.' Then Ninsun, who is well-beloved and wise, said to Gilgamesh, ëThis star of heaven which descended lik e a meteor from the sky; which you tried to lift, - but found too heavy, when you tried to move it it would not budge, and so you brought it to my feet; I made it for you, a goad and spur, and you were drawn as though to a wo man. This is the strong comrade, the one who brings help to his friend in his need. He is the strongest of wild cre atures, the stuff of Anu; born in the grass-lands and the wild hills reared him; when you see him you will be glad; you will love him as a woman and he will never forsake you. This is t he meaning of the dream.' Gilgamesh said, ëMother, I dreamed a second dream. In the streets of strong-walled Uruk there lay an a xe; the shape of it was strange and the people thronged rou nd. I saw it and was glad. I bent down, deeply draw n towards it; I loved it like a woman and wore it at my side.' Nins un answered, ëThat axe, which you saw, which drew y ou so powerfully like love of a woman, that is the comrad e whom I give you, and he will come in his strength like one of the host of heaven. He is the brave companion who r escues his friend in necessity.' Gilgamesh said to his mother, 'A friend, a counsellor has come to me from Enlil, and now I shall befriend and counsel him.' So Gilgames h told his dreams; and the harlot retold them to Enkidu. And now she said to Enkidu, ëWhen I look at you you have become like a god. Why do you yearn to run wi ld again with the beasts in the hills? Get up from the ground, the bed of a shepherd.' He listened to her words with care. It was good advice that she gave. She divided her c lothing in two and with the one half she clothed hi m and with the other herself, and holding his hand she led him lik e a child to the sheepfolds, into the shepherds' te nts. There all the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Epic Of Gilgamesh 6 shepherds crowded round to see him, they put down b read in front of him, but Enkidu could only suck th e milk of wild animals. He fumbled and gaped, at a loss what to do or how he should eat the bread and drink the strong wine. Then the woman said, 'Enkidu, eat bread, it is the staff of life; drink the wine, it is the custom of the land.' So he ate till he was full and drank strong wine, seven goble ts. He became merry, his heart exulted and his face shone. He rubbed down the matted hair of his body and anointe d himself with oil. Enkidu had become a man; but wh en he had put on man's clothing he appeared like a bridegroom . He took arms to hunt the lion so that the shepher ds could rest at night. He caught wolves and lions and the herdsmen lay down in peace; for Enkidu was their watchman, t hat strong man who had no rival. He was merry living with the shepherds, till one da y lifting his eyes he saw a man approaching. He sai d to the harlot, ëWoman, fetch that man here. Why has he come? I wis h to know his name.' She went and called the man sa ying, ëSir, where are you going on this weary journey?' The man answered, saying to Enkidu, ëGilgamesh has gone in to the marriage-house and shut out the people. He does str ange things in Uruk, the city of great streets. At the roll of the drum work begins for the men, and work for the women. Gi lgamesh the king is about to celebrate marriage wit h the Queen of Love, and he still demands to be first with the bri de, the king to be first and the husband to follow, for that was ordained by the gods from his birth, from the time the umbil ical cord was cut. But now the drums roll for the c hoice of the bride and the city groans.' At these words Enkidu turned whit e in the face. ëI will go to the place where Gilgam esh lords it over the people, I will challenge him boldly, and I will cry aloud in Uruk, \"I have come to change the old orde r, for I am the strongest here.\" Now Enkidu strode in front and the woman followed b ehind. He entered Uruk, that great market, and all the folk thronged round him where he stood in the street in strong-walled Uruk. The people jostled; speaking of him they said, ëHe is the spit of Gilgamesh. ëHe is shorter.í ëHe is b igger of bone.í This is the one who was reared on t he milk of wild beasts. His is the greatest strength.' The men rejoiced: ëN ow Gilgamesh has met his match. This great - one, this hero whose beauty is like a god, he is a match even for Gilgamesh.í In Uruk the bridal bed was made, fit for the goddes s of love. The bride waited for the bridegroom, but in the night Gilgamesh got up and came to the house. Then Enkidu stepped out, he stood in the street and blocked th e way. Mighty Gilgamesh came on and Enkidu met him at the gate. H e put out his foot and prevented Gilgamesh from ent ering the house, so they grappled, holding each other like bu lls. They broke the doorposts and the walls shook, they snorted like bulls locked together. They shattered the doorposts and the walls shook. Gilgamesh bent his knee with his foot planted on the ground and with a turn Enkidu was thrown. Then immediately his fury died. When Enkidu was thrown h e said to Gilgamesh, ëThere is not another like you in the wo rld. Ninsun, who is as strong as a wild ox in the b yre, she was the mother who bore you, and now you are raised above a ll men, and Enlil has given you the kingship, for y our strength sur- passes the strength of men.í So Enkidu and Gilgames h embraced and their friendship was sealed. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Epic Of Gilgamesh 7 2 THE FOREST JOURNEY ENLIL of the mountain, the father of the gods, had decreed the destiny of Gilgamesh. So Gilgamesh drea med and Enkidu said, 'The meaning of the dream is this. The father of the gods has given you kingship, such is your destiny, everlasting life is not your destiny. Because of th is do not be sad at heart, do not be grieved or opp ressed. He has given you power to bind and to loose, to be the darkness and the light of mankind. He has given you unexampl ed supremacy over the people, victory in battle from which no fu gitive returns, in forays and assaults from which t here is no going back. But do not abuse this power, deal justly with your servants in the palace, deal justly before Shamash. ' The eyes of Enkidu were full of tears and his heart was sick. He sighed bitterly and Gilgamesh me t his eye and said,' My friend, why do you sigh so bitterly? But Enkidu opened his mouth and said, 'I am weak, my arms have lost their strength, the cry of sorrow sticks in my throat, I am oppressed by idlen ess.' It was then that the lord Gilgamesh turned his thou ghts to the Country of the Living; on the Land of Cedars the lord Gilgamesh reflected. He said to his servant Enkidu, 'I have not established my name stamped on bricks as my destiny decreed; therefore I will go t o the country where the cedar is felled. I will set up my name in the place where the names of famous men are written, and where- no man's name is written yet I will wise a monument to the gods. Because o£ the evil th at is in the land, we will go to the forest and destro y the evil; for in the forest lives Humbaba whose name is \"Hugeness\", , a ferocious giant. But Enkidu sighed bitterly and said, ëWhen I went with the wild beast s ranging through the wilderness I discovered the for est; its length is ten thousand leagues in every directi on. Enlil has appointed Humbaba to guard it and armed him iii sevenfold terrors, terrible to all flesh is Humbaba. When he roars it is like the torrent of th e storm, his breath is like fire, and his jaws are de ath itself. He guards the cedars so well that when the wild heifer stirs in the forest, though she is sixty lea gues distant, he hears her. What man would willingly wal k into that country and explore its depths? I tell yo u, weakness overpowers whoever goes near it: it is not an equal struggle when one fights with Humbaba; he is a great warrior, a battering-ram. Gilgamesh, the watchman of the forest never sleeps.' Gilgamesh replied: 'Where is the man who can clambe r to heaven? Only the gods live for ever with glori ous Shamash, but as for us men, our days are numbered, our occupations are a breath of wind. How is this, already you are afraid! I will go first although I am your lord, an 4.youmay safely call out, \"Forward, there is nothin g to fear!\" Then if I fall I leave behind me a name that endures; men - w ill say of me, \"Gilgamesh has fallen in fight with ferocious Humbaba.\" Long after the child has been bony in my house, the y will say it, and remember.' Enkidu spoke again to Gilgamesh, 'O my lord, if you will enter that country, go first t o the hero Shamash, tell the Sun God, for the land is his. The country where the cedar is cut belongs to Shamash.' Gilgamesh took up a kid, white without spot, and a brown one with it; he held them against his breast, and he carried them into the presence of the sun. He took i n his hand his silver sceptre and he said to glori ous S h a m a s h , ëI a m going to that country, O Shamash, I am going; m y ha nds supplicate, so let it be well with my soul and bring me back to"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Epic Of Gilgamesh 8 the quay of Uruk. Grant, I beseech, your protection , and let the omen be good.' Glorious Shamash answe red, ëGilgamesh, you are strong, but what i s the Country of the Livi ng to you? 'O Shamash, hear me, hear me, Shamash, let m y voice be heard. Here in the city man dies oppressed a t h eart, man perishes with despair in his heart. I have looked o ver the wall and I see the bodies floating on the r iver, and that will be my lot also. Indeed I know it is so, for whoever is ta llest among men cannot reach the heavens, and the g reatest cannot encompass the earth. Therefore I would enter that c ountry: because I have not established my name stam ped on brick as m y destiny decreed, I will go to the country where the cedar is cut. I will set up my name where the n ames of famous men are written; and where no man's name is written I w ill raise a monument to the gods.' The tears, ran d own his face and he said, ëAlas, it is a l o n g journey that I must take to the Land of Humbaba. If this enterprise is not t o be accomplished, wh y did y o u m o v e me, Shamash, with the restless des ire to perform it? How can I succeed if you w i l l no t succour me? If I die in that country I will die without ran cour, but if I return I will make a glorious offeri ng of gifts and of praise t o Shamash.' So Shamash accepted the sacrifice o f his tears; lik e the compassionate man he showed him mercy. He app ointed strong allies for Gilgamesh, sons of one mother, an d stationed them in the mountain caves. The great w inds he appointed: the north wind, the whirlwind, the stone and the i c y wind, the tempest and the scorching wind. Like ' vipers, like dragons, like a scorching fire, l i k e a serpent that freezes the heart, a destroying flood and the lightning's f ork, such were they and Gilgamesh rejoiced. He went to the forge and said, ..'I will give order s t o the armourers; they s h a l l cast us our weapons while we watch them.' So they gave orders to the armourers and the craftsmen sat down in conference. They went into t he groves of the plain and cut willow and box-wood; they cast for th em axes of nine score pounds, and great swords they cast with blades of six score pounds each one, with pommels and hilt s of thirty pounds. They cast for Gilgamesh the axe ëMight of Heroes' and the bow of Anshan; and Gilgamesh was armed and Enkidu; and the weight of the arms they carried was thirty score pounds. The people collected and the counsellors in the str eets and in the market-place of Uruk; they came thr ough the gate of seven bolts and Gilgamesh spoke to them in the m arket-place: ëI, Gilgamesh, go to see that creature o f whom such things are spoken, the rumour o f wh o s e name fills t he world. I will conquer him in his cedar wood and show the strength of the sons of Uruk, all the world shall. know of it. I am committed to this enterprise: to c limb the mountain, to cut down the cedar, and leave behind me an enduring nam e.' The counsellors of Uruk; the great market, answ ered him, ëGilgamesh, you are young, your courage carries you too far, you cannot know what this enterprise mean s which y o u plan. We have heard that Hurnbaba is n o t like men w ho die, his weapons are such that none can stand ag ainst them; the forest stretches for ten thousand leagues in every direction; who would willingly go down to explore i ts depths? As for Humbaba, when he roars it is like the torrent o f the storm, his breath is like fire and his jaws a re death itself. Why do you crave to do this thing, Gilgamesh? It is no equal struggle when one fights with Humbaba, that b attering-ram: When he heard these words of the counsellors Gilgam esh looked at his friend and laughed, ëHow shall I answer them; shall I say I am afraid of Humbaba, I will sit at home all the rest of my days?' Then Gil gamesh opened his mouth again and said to Enkidu, ëMy friend, let us go to the Great Palace, to Egalmah, and stand b efore Ninsun the queen. Ninsun is wise with deep knowledge, she will give us counsel for the road we must go.' They took each other by the hand as they went to Egalmah, and they went to Ninsun the great queen. Gilgamesh approach ed, he entered the palace and spoke to Ninsun. ëNinsun, wi ll you listen to me; I have a long journey to go, t o the Land of Humbaba, I must travel an unknown road and fight a strange battle. From the day I go until I return, t ill I reach the cedar forest and destroy the evil which Shamash abh ors, pray for me to Shamash.' Ninsun went into her room, she put on a dress becom ing to her body, she put on jewels to make her brea st beautiful, she placed a tiara on her head and her s kirts swept the ground. Then she went up to the alt ar of the Sun, standing upon the roof of the palace; she burnt inc ense and lifted her arms to Shamash as the smoke as cended: ëO Shamash, why did you give this restless heart to Gi lgamesh, my son; why did you give it? You have move d him and now he sets out on a long journey to the Land of Hu mbaba, to travel an unknown road and fight a strang e battle. Therefore from the day that he goes till the day he returns, until he reaches the cedar forest, until he kills Humbaba and destroys the evil thing which you, Shamash, abh or, do not forget him; but let the dawn, Aya, your dear bride, remind you always, and when day is done give him to the watchman of the night to keep him from harm.' Then Ninsun the mother of Gilgamesh extinguished the inc ense, and she called to Enkidu with this exhortatio n: ëStrong Enkidu, you are not the child of my body, but I wil l receive you as my adopted son; you are my other c hild like the foundlings they bring to the temple. Serve Gilgames h as a foundling serves the temple and the priestes s who reared him. In the presence of my women, any votaries and hierophants, I declare it.' Then she placed - the a mulet for a pledge round his neck, and she said to him, ëI entr ust my son to you; bring him back to me safely.' And now they brought to them the weapons, they put in their hands the great swords in their golden sca bbards, and the bow and the quiver. Gilgamesh took the axe, he slung the quiver from his -shoulder, and the bo w of Anshan,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Epic Of Gilgamesh 9 and buckled the sword to his belt; and so they were armed and ready for the journey. Now all the peopl e came and pressed on them and said, ëWhen will you return to the city? The counsellors blessed Gilgamesh and war ned him, ëDo not trust too much in your own strength, be wat chful, restrain your blows at first. The one who go es in front protects his companion; the good guide who knows th e way guards his . friend. Let Enkidu lead the way, he knows the road to the forest, he has seen Humbaba and is experienced in battles; let him press first into th e passes, let him be watchful and look to himself. Let-Enkidu protect hi s friend, and guard his companion, and bring him sa fe through the pitfalls of the road. We, the counsellors of Uruk e ntrust our king to you, O Enkidu; bring him back sa fely to us.' Again to Gilgamesh, they said, ëMay Shamash give you your he art's desire, may he let you see with your eyes the thing accomplished which your lips have spoken; may he op en a path for you where it is blocked, and a road f or your feet to tread. May he open the mountains for your crossing, and may the nighttime bring you the blessings of n ight, and Lugulbanda, your guardian god, stand beside you for victory. May y ou have victory in the battle as though you fought with a child. Wash your feet in the river of Humbab a to which you are journeying; in the evening dig a well, and let there always be pure water in your water-skin. Offer cold water to Shamash and do not forget Lugulbanda.' Then Enkidu opened his mouth and said, ëForward, th ere is nothing to fear. Follow me, for I know the p lace where Humbaba lives and the paths where he walks. Let the counsellors go back. Here is no cause for fear.' W hen the counsellors heard this they sped the hero on his way. ëGo, Gilg amesh, may your guardian god protect you on the roa d and bring you safely back to the quay of Uruk.' After twenty leagues they broke their fast; after a nother thirty leagues they stopped for the night. F ifty leagues they walked in one day; in three days they had walked as much as a journey of a month and two weeks. They c rossed seven mountains before they came to the gate of the fores t. Then Enkidu called out to Gilgamesh, ëDo not go down into the forest; when I opened the gate my hand lost its str ength.' Gilgamesh answered him, ëDear friend, do no t speak like a coward. Have we got the better of so many dangers a nd travelled so far, to turn back at last? You, who are tried in wars and battles, hold dose to me now and you will feel no fear of death; keep beside me and your weakness will pass, the trembling will leave your hand. Would my friend rat her stay behind? No, we will, go down together into the heart of the forest. Let your courage be roused by the battle to come; forget death and follow me, a man resolute i n action, but one who is not foolhardy. When two go together each will pr otect himself and shield his companion, and if they fall they leave an enduring name.' Together they went down into the forest and they ca me to the green mountain. There they stood still, t hey were struck dumb; they stood still and gazed at the fore st. They saw the height of the cedar, they saw the way into the forest and the track where Humbaba was used to walk. The way w as broad and the going was good. They gazed at the mountain of cedars, the dwelling-place of the gods and the thro ne of Ishtar. The hugeness of the cedar rose in fro nt of the mountain, its shade was beautiful, full of comfort; mountain and glade were green with brushwood: There Gilgamesh dug a well before the setting sun. He went up the mountain and poured out fine meal on the ground and said, ëO mountain, dwelling of the gods, bring me a favourable dream.' Then they took each other' by the hand and lay down to sleep; and sleep that flows from th e night lapped over them. Gilgamesh dreamed, and at midnight sleep left him, and he told his dream to his friend. ëEnk idu, what was it that woke me if you did not? My fr iend, I have dreamed a dream. Get up, look at the mountain precipice. Th e sleep that the gods sent me is broken. Ah, my fri end, what a dream I have had! Terror and confusion; I seized hold of a wild bull in the wilderness. It bellowed and beat u p the dust till the whole sky was dark, my arm was seized and my tongue bitten. I fell back on' my knee; then someone refr eshed me with water from his water-skin.' Enkidu said, ëDear friend, the god to whom we are t ravelling is no wild bull, though his form is myste rious. That wild bull which you saw is Shamash the Protect or; in our moment of peril he will take our hands. The one who gave water from his water-skin, that is your own go d who cares for your good name, your Lugulbanda. Un ited with him, together we will accomplish a work the fame of which will never die.' Gilgamesh said, ëI dreamed again. We stood in a dee p gorge of the mountain, and beside it we two were like the smallest of swamp flies; and suddenly the mount ain fell, it struck me and caught my feet from unde r me. Then came an intolerable light blazing out, and in it wa s one whose grace and whose beauty were greater tha n the beauty of this world. He pulled me out from under the moun tain, he gave me water to drink and my heart was co mforted, and he set my feet on the - ground.' Then Enkidu the child of the plains said, ëLet us g o down from the mountain and talk this thing over t ogether.' He said to Gilgamesh the young god, ëYour dream is good, your dream is excellent, the mountain which y ou saw is Humbaba. Now, surely, we will seize and kill him, a nd throw his body down as the mountain fell on the plain.' The next day after twenty leagues they broke their fast, and after another thirty they stopped for the night. They dug a well before the sun had set and Gilgamesh asc ended the mountain. He poured out fine meal on the ground and said, ëO mountain, dwelling of the gods, send a dre am for Enkidu, make him a favourable dream.' The mo untain fashioned a dream for Enkidu; it came, an ominous d ream; a cold shower passed over him, it caused him to cower"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Epic Of Gilgamesh 10 tike the mountain barley under a storm of rain. But Gilgamesh sat with his chin on his knees till the sleep which flows over all mankind lapped over him. Then, at mi dnight, sleep left him; he got up and said to his f riend, ëDid you call me, or why did I wake? Did you touch me, or wh y am I terrified? Did not some god pass by, for my limbs are numb with fear? My friend, I saw a third dream and this dream was altogether frightful. The heavens ro ared and the earth roared again, daylight failed and darkness fe ll, lightnings flashed, fire blazed out, the clouds lowered, they rained down death. Then the brightness departed, th e fire went out, and all was turned to ashes fallen about us. Let us go down from the mountain and talk this over, an d consider what we should do.' When they had come down from the mountain Gilgamesh seized the axe in his hand: he felled the cedar. W hen Humbaba heard the noise far off he was enraged; he cried out, ëWho is this that has violated my woods and cut down my cedar?' But glorious Shamash called to them out of heaven, 'Go forward, do not be afraid.' But now' Gilgamesh was overcome by weakness, for sleep had s eized him suddenly, a profound sleep held him; he l ay on the ground, stretched out speechless, as though in a dr eam. When Enkidu touched him he did not rise, when he spoke to him he did not reply. ëO Gilgamesh, Lord of the pla in of Kullab, the world grows dark, the shadows hav e spread over it, now is the glimmer of dusk. Shamash has de parted, his bright head is quenched in the bosom of his mother Ningal. O Gilgamesh, how long will you l i e like thi s, asleep? N e v e r let the mother who gave you b i r t h be forced in mourning into the city square.' At length Gilgamesh heard him; lie put on his breas tplate, ëThe Voice of Heroes', of thirty shekels' w eight; he put it on as though it had been a light garment that he ca rried, and it covered him altogether. He straddled the earth like a bull that snuff's the ground and his teeth were clenched . ëBy the life of my mother Ninsun who gave me birt h, and by the life of my father, divine Lugulbanda, let me live to be the wonder of my mother, - as when she nursed me on h e r lap.' A second time he said to him, ëBy the life of Ninsun my moth er who gave me birth, and by the life of my father, divine Lugulbanda, until we have fought thus man, if man he is, this g od, if god he is, the way that I took to the Countr y of the Living will not turn back to the city.' Then Enkidu, the faithful companion, pleaded, answe ring him, ëO my lord, y o u do not know this monster and that is the reason you are not afraid. I who know him, I am terrified. His teeth are dragon's fangs, his co untenance is like a lion, his charge i s the rushing of the flood, with his lo ok he crushes alike the trees of the forest and ree ds in the swamp. O my Lord, you may go on if you choose into t h u s land, b ut I will go back to the city. I will tell the lady your mother all your glorious' deeds till she shouts for joy: and then I will tell the death that followed till she weeps f or bitterness.' But Gilgamesh said, ëImmolation and sacrifice are not y et for me, the boat of the dead shall not go down, nor the three-ply cloth be cut for my shrouding. Not yet will my peop le be desolate, nor the pyre b e lit in my house and my dwelling burnt on the fire. Today, give me your aid and you shall have mine: wh a t then can go amiss with us two? All living creatures b o r n of the flesh shall sit at last in the boat of the West, and when it sinks, when the boat of Magil um sinks, they are gone; but we shall go forward and fix our eyes on t his monster. If your heart is fearful throw away fe ar; if there is terror in it throw away terror. Take your axe in your hand an d attack. He who leaves the fight unfinished is not at peace.' Humbaba came out from his strong house of cedar. Th en Enkidu called out, ëO Gilgamesh, remember now yo ur boasts in Uruk. Forward, attack, son of Uruk, there is nothing to fear.' When he heard these words his courage rallied; he answered, ëMake haste, close in, if the watchman is there do not let him escape to the woods where he wi l l vanish. He has put on the first of his seven splendours but no t yet the other six, let us trap him before he is a rmed.' Like a raging wild bull he snuffed the ground; the watchman of the woo ds turned full of threatenings, he cried out. Humba ba came from his strong house of cedar. He nodded his head and shook it, menacing Gilgamesh; and on him he fastened his eye, the eye of death. Then Gilgamesh called to Shamash and his tea rs were flowing, ëO glorious Shamash, I have follow ed the road you commanded but now if y o u send no succour how shall I escape? Glorious Shamash heard his prayer and he summoned the great wind, the north wind, the whirlwind, the storm and the icy wind, the tempest and the scorchi ng wind; they came like dragons, like a scorching fire, like a serpent that freezes the heart, a destroying flood and the lightning's fork. The eight winds rose up against Humbaba, they beat against hi s eyes; he was gripped, unable to go forward or bac k. Gilgamesh shouted, ëBy the life of Ninsun my mother and divin e Lugulbanda my father, in the Country of the Livin g, i n this Land I have discovered your dwelling; my weak arms and my small weapons I have brought to this Land against y ou, and now I will enter your house'. So he felled the first cedar and they cut the branc hes and laid them at the foot of the mountain. At t he first stroke Humbaba blazed out, but still they advanced. They f elled seven cedars and cut and bound the branches a nd laid them at the foot of the mountain, and seven times Humbaba l oosed his g l o r y on them. As the seventh blaze died out they reached his lair. He slapped his thigh in scorn. He approached like a noble wild bull roped on the mou ntain, a warrior whose elbows are bound together. The tears started to his eyes and he was pale, ëGilgamesh, let me spe ak. I have never known a mother, no, nor a father who reared me. I w as born of the mountain, he reared me, and Enlil ma de me the keeper of this forest. Let me go free, Gilgamesh, and I wi ll be your servant, you shall be my lord; all the t rees of the forest that I tended on the mountain shall be yours. I will cut t hem down and build you a palace.' He took him by th e hand and led him"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Epic Of Gilgamesh 11 to his house, so that the heart of Gilgamesh was mo ved with compassion. He swore by the heavenly life, by the earthly life, by the underworld itself: ëO Enkidu, should n ot the snared, bird return to its nest and the capt ive man return to his mother's arms?' Enkidu answered, ëThe strongest of men will fall to fate if he has no judgement. Namta r, the evil fate that knows no distinction between men, will devour him. If the snared bird returns to its nest, if the capt ive man returns to his mother's arms, then you my friend will never return to the city where the mother is waiting who gave y ou birth. He will bar the mountain road against you, and make the pat hways impassable.' Humbaba said, 'Enkidu, what you have spoken is evil : you, a hireling, dependent for your bread! In env y and for fear of a rival you have spoken evil words.' Enkidu said , ëDo not listen, Gilgamesh: this Humbaba must die. Kill Humbaba first and his servants after.' But Gilgamesh said, 'If we touch him the blaze and the glory of light will be put out in confusion, the glory and glamour will vanish, its rays will be quenched.' Enkidu said to Gilgamesh, ëNot so, my f riend. First entrap the bird, and where shall the chicks run then? Afte rwards we can search out the glory and the glamour, when the chicks run distracted through the grass.' Gilgamesh listened to the word of his companion, he took the axe in his hand, he drew the sword from h is belt, and he struck Humbaba with a thrust of the sword to the neck, and Enkidu his comrade struck the second blo w. At the third blow Humbaba fell. Then there followed confusion fo r this was the guardian of the forest whom they had felled to the ground. For as far as two leagues the cedars shiver ed when Enkidu felled the watcher of the forest, he at whose voice Hermon and Lebanon used to tremble. Now the mountai ns were moved and all the hills, for the guardian o f the forest was killed. They attacked the cedars, the seven splendo urs of Humbaba were extinguished. So they pressed o n into the forest bearing the sword of eight talents. They uncovered the sacred dwellings of the Anunnaki and while Gilg amesh felled the first of the trees of the forest Enkidu cleared the ir roots as far as the banks of Euphrates. They set Humbaba before the gods, before Enlil; they kissed the ground and drop ped the shroud and set the head before him. When he saw the head of Humbaba, Enlil raged at them. ëWhy did you do this thing? From henceforth may the fire be on your face s, may it eat the bread that you eat, may it drink where you drink.' Then Enlil took again the blaze and the seven splen dours that had been Humbaba's: he gave the first to the river, and he g ave to the lion, to the stone of execration, to the mountain and to the dreaded daughter of the Queen of Hell. O Gilgamesh, king and conqueror of the dreadful bla ze; wild bull who plunders the mountain, who crosse s the sea, glory to him, and from the brave the greater glory is Enki's!

He put on his royal robes and made them fast. When Gilgamesh had put on the crown, glorious Ishtar lifted her ey es, seeing the beauty of Gilgamesh. She said, ëCome to me Gilgamesh, and be my bridegroom; grant me seed of your body, l et me be your bride and you shall be my husband. I will harness for you a chariot of lapis lazuli and of gold, with whe els of gold and horns of copper; and you shall have mighty demons of the storm for draft mules. When you enter our house in the fragrance of cedar-wood, threshold and thro ne will kiss your feet. Kings, rulers, and princes will bow down befo re you; they shall bring you tribute from the mount ains and the plain. Your ewes shall drop twins and your goats triplets; your pack-ass shall outrun mules; your oxen shall have no rivals, and your chariot horses shall be famous far-off for the ir swiftness.' Gilgamesh opened his mouth and answered glorious Is htar, ëIf I take you in marriage, what gifts can I give in return? What ointments and clothing for your body? I would gladly give you bread and all sorts of food fit for a god. I would give you wine to drink fit for a queen. I would pour out barley to stuff your granary; but as for making yo u my wife - that I will not. How would it go with me? Your lovers have foun d you like a brazier which smoulders in the cold, a backdoor which keeps out neither squall of wind nor storm, a castl e which crushes the garrison, pitch that blackens t he bearer, a water-skin that chafes the carrier, a stone which falls from t he parapet, a battering-ram turned back from the en emy, a sandal that trips the wearer. Which of your lovers did you ever love for ever? What shepherd of yours has pleased you fo r all time? Listen to me while I tell the tale of your lovers. There w as Tammuz, the lover of your youth, for him you dec reed wailing, year after year. You loved the many coloured roller, but still you struck and broke his wing; now in the gr ove he sits and cries, \"kappi, kappi, my wing, my wing.\" You have loved th e lion tremendous in strength: seven pits you dug f or him, and seven. You have loved the stallion magnificent in b attle, and for him you decreed whip and spur and a thong, to gallop seven leagues by force and to muddy the water befor e he drinks; and for his mother Silili lamentations . You have loved the shepherd of the flock; he made meal-cake for yo u day after day, he killed kids for your sake. You struck and turned him into a wolf, now his own herd-boys chase him aw ay, his own hounds worry his flanks. And did you no t love Ishullanu, the gardener of your father's palm grove ? He brought you baskets filled with dates without end; every day he loaded your table. Then you turned your eyes on him and said, \"Dearest Ishullanu, come here to me, let us enjoy your manhood, come forward and take me, I am yours.' Ish ullanu answered, \"What are you asking from me? My m other has baked and I have eaten; why should I come to such a s you for food that is tainted and rotten? For when was a screen of rushes sufficient protection from frosts?\" But when you had beard his answer you struck him. He was ch anged to a blind mole deep in the earth, one whose desire is always beyond his reach. And if you and I should be lovers , should not I be served in the same fashion as all these others whom you loved once?í When Ishtar heard this she fell into a bitter rage, she went up to high heaven. Her tears poured down in front of her father Anu, and Antum her mother. She said, ëMy fat her, Gilgamesh has heaped insults on me, he has tol d over all my abominable behaviour, my foul and hideous acts.' An u opened his mouth and said, ëAre you a father of g ods? Did not you quarrel with Gilgamesh the king, so now he has rela ted your abominable behaviour, your foul and hideou s acts.' Ishtar opened her mouth and said again, ëMy father, give me the Bull of Heaven to destroy Gilgamesh. F ill Gilgamesh, I say, with arrogance to his destruction ; but if you refuse to give me the Bull of Heaven I will break in the doors of hell and smash the bolts; there will be co nfusion of people, those above with those from the lower depths. I shall bring up the dead to eat food like the living; and the hosts of dead will outnumber the living.' Anusa d to great Ishtar, ëIf I do what you desire there will be seven years of dro ught throughout Uruk when corn will be seedless hus ks. Have you saved grain enough for the people and grass for the cattle? Ishtar replied. ëI have saved grain for th e people, grass for the cattle; for seven years o£ seedless husks , there is grain and there is grass enough.' When Anu heard what Ishtar had said he gave her the Bull of Heaven to lead by the halter down to Uruk: When they reached the gates of Uruk the Bull went to the rive r; with his first snort cracks opened in the earth and, a hundred young men fell down to death. With his second snort crack s opened and two hundred fell down to death. With h is third snort cracks opened, Enkidu doubled over but instantly re covered, he dodged aside and leapt on the Bull and seized it by the horns. The Bull of Heaven foamed in his face, it br ushed him with the thick of its tail. Enkidu cried to Gilgamesh, 'my friend, we boasted that we would .leave enduring na mes behind us. Now thrust in your sword between the nape and the horns.' So Gilgamesh followed the Bull, he seized t he thick of its tail, he thrust the sword between t he nape and the horns and slew the Bull. When they had killed the Bull of Heaven they cut out its heart and gave it to Shama sh, and the brothers rested."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Epic Of Gilgamesh 13 But Ishtar rose tip and mounted the great wall of U ruk; she sprang on to the tower and uttered a curse : ëWoe to Gilgamesh, for he has scorned me in killing the Bul l of Heaven.' When Enkidu heard these words he tore out the Bull's right thigh and tossed it in her face saying, ëIf I could lay my hands on you, it is this I should do to you, and lash the entrails to your side.' Then Ishtar called together her people, the dancing and singing girls, the pro stitutes of the temple, the courtesans. Over the thigh of the Bull of Heave n she set up lamentation. But Gilgamesh called the smiths and the armourers, all of them together. They admired the immensity of the horns. They were plated with lapis lazuli two fingers thic k. They were thirty pounds each in weight, and thei r capacity in oil was six measures, which he gave to his guardian god, Lu gulbanda. But he carried the horns into the palace and hung them on the wall. Then they washed their hands in Euphrates , they embraced each other and went away. They drov e through the streets of Uruk where the heroes were gathered to s ee them, and Gilgamesh called to the singing girls, ëWho is most glorious of the heroes, who is most eminent among m en?' ëGilgamesh is the most glorious of heroes, Gil gamesh is most eminent among men.' And now there was feasting, and celebrations and joy in the palace, till the heroe s lay down saying, ëNow we will rest for the night.' When the daylight came Enkidu got up and cried to G ilgamesh, ëO my brother, such a dream I had last ni ght. Anu, Enlil, Ea and heavenly Shamash took counsel togethe r, and Anu said to Enlil, \"Because they have killed the Bull of Heaven, and because they have killed Humbaba who gu arded the Cedar Mountain one of the two must , die. \" Then glorious Shamash answered the hero Enlil, \"It was b y your command they killed the Bull of Heaven, and killed Humbaba, and must Enkidu die although innocent?\" Enlil flung round in rage at glorious Shamash, \"You dare to sa y this, you who went about with them every day like one of themselv es!\"' So Enkidu lay stretched out before Gilgamesh; his t ears ran down in streams and he said to Gilgamesh, ' O my brother, so dear as you are to me, brother, yet the y will take me from you.' Again he said, ëI must si t down on the threshold of the dead and never again will I see my dear brot her with my eyes.' While Enkidu lay alone in his sickness he cursed th e gate as though it was living flesh, ëYou there, w ood of the gate, dull and insensible, witless, I searched for you over twenty leagues until I saw the towering ce dar. There is no wood like you in our land. Seventy-two cubits high and t wenty-four wide, the pivot and the ferrule and the jambs are perfect. A master craftsman from Nippur has made you; but O, i f I had known the conclusion! If I had known that t his was all the good that would come of it, I would have raised the axe and split you into little pieces and set up he re a gate of wattle instead. Ah, if only some future king had brought y ou here, or some god- had fashioned you. Let him ob literate my name and write his own, and the curse fall on him instea d of on Enkidu.' With the first brightening of dawn Enkidu raised hi s head and wept before the Sun God, in the brillian ce of the sunlight his tears streamed down. ëSun God, I besee ch you, about that vile Trapper, that Trapper of no thing because of whom I was to catch less than my comrade; let him c atch least, make his game scarce, make him feeble, taking the smaller of every share, let his quarry escape from his nets .' When he had cursed the Trapper to his heart's conte nt he turned on the harlot. He was roused to curse her also. ëAs for you, woman, with a great curse I curse you! I w ill promise you a destiny to all eternity. My curse shall come on you soon and sudden. You shall be without a roof for yo ur commerce, for you shall not keep house with othe r girls in the tavern, but do your business in places fouled by th e vomit of the drunkard. Your hire will be potter's earth, your thievings will be flung into the hovel, you will sit at the c ross-roads in the dust of the potter's quarter, you will make your bed on the dunghill at night, and by day take your stand in th e wall's shadow. Brambles and thorns will tear your feet, the drunk and the dry will strike your cheek and your mouth will ache. Let you be stripped of your purple dyes, for I too once in the wilderness with my wife had all the treasure I wish ed.' When Shamash heard the words of Enkidu he called to him from heaven: ëEnkidu, why are you cursing the woman, the mistress who taught you to eat bread fit for go ds and drink wine of kings? She who put upon you a ëmagnificent garment, did she not give you glorious Gilgamesh fo r your companion, and has not Gilgamesh, your own b rother, made you rest on a 'royal bed and recline on a couch at his left hand? He has made the princes of the earth kiss your feet, and now all the people of Uruk lament and wail over you . When you are dead he will let his hair grow long for your sake, he will wear a lion's pelt and wander through the dese rt.' When Enkidu heard glorious Shamash his angry heart grew quiet, he called back the curse and said, ëWom an, I promise you another destiny. The mouth which cursed you shall bless you! Kings, princes and nobles sha ll adore you. On your account a man though twelve miles off will cla p his hand to his thigh and his hair will twitch. F or you he will undo his belt and open his treasure and you shall have y our desire; lapis lazuli, gold and' carnelian from the heap in the treasury. A ring for your hand and a robe shall be yours. The priest will lead you into the presence of the gods . On your account a wife, a mother of seven, was forsaken.' As Enkidu slept alone in his sickness, in bitternes s of spirit he poured out his heart to his friend. 'It was I who cut down the cedar, I who levelled the forest, I who sl ew Humbaba and now see what has become of me. Liste n, my friend, this is the dream I dreamed last night.

His was a vampire face, his foot was a lion's foot, his hand was an eagle's talon. H e fell on me and his claws were in my hair, he held me fast and I smothered; then he transformed me so that my arms b ecame wings covered with feathers. He turned his st are towards me, and he led me away to the palace of Irkalla, the Qu een of Darkness, to the house from which none who e nters ever returns, down the road from which there is no coming back. ëThere is the house whose people sit in darkness; d ust is their food and clay their meat. They are clo thed like birds \" with wings for covering, they see no light, they si t in darkness. I entered the house of dust and I sa w the kings of the earth, their crowns put away for ever; rulers and princes, all those who once wore kingly crowns and ruled th e world in the days of old. They who had stood in the place of the gods like Ann and Enlil stood now like servants to fetc h baked meats in the house of dust, to carry cooked meat and cold water from the water-skin. In the house of dust which I e ntered were high priests and acolytes, priests of the incantation an d of ecstasy; there were servers of the temple, and there was Etana, that king of Dish whom the eagle carried to heaven in th e days of old. I saw also Samuqan, god of cattle, a nd there was Ereshkigal the Queen of the Underworld; and Befit-S heri squatted in front of her, she who is recorder of the gods and keeps the book of death.

She raised her head, she saw me and sp oke:\" Who has brought this one here?\" Then I awoke like a man dra ined of blood who wanders alone in a waste of rashe s; like one whom the bailiff has seized and his heart pounds wi th terror.' Gilgamesh had peeled off his clothes, he listened t o his words and wept quick tears, Gilgamesh listene d and his tears flowed. He opened his mouth and spoke to Enkidu: ëW ho is there in strong-walled Uruk who has wisdom li ke this? Strange things have been spoken, why does your hear t speak strangely? The dream was marvellous but the terror was great; we must treasure the dream whatever the terr or; for the dream has shown that misery comes at la st to the healthy man, the end of life is sorrow.' And Gilgamesh lame nted, ëNow I will pray to the great gods, for my fr iend had an ominous dream.' This day on which Enkidu dreamed came to an end and be lay stricken with sickness. One whole day he la y on his bed and his suffering increased. He said to Gilgame sh, the friend on whose account he had left the wil derness, 'Once I ran for you, for the water of life, and I now have noth ing:' A second day he lay on his bed and Gilgamesh watched over him but the sickness increased. A third day he lay on h is bed, he called out to Gilgamesh, rousing him up. Now he was weak and his eyes were blind with weeping. Ten days he l ay and his suffering increased, eleven and twelve d ays he lay on his bed of pain. Then he called to Gilgamesh, 'My frien d, the great goddess cursed me and I must die in sh ame.

This way and that he paced round the be d, he tore out his hair and strewed it around. He d ragged of his splendid robes and flung them down as though they w ere abominations. In the first light of dawn Gilgamesh cried out, ëI made you rest on a royal bed, you reclined on a cou ch at my left hand, the princes of the earth kissed your feet. I will cause all the people of Uruk to weep over you and raise the dirge of the dead. The joyful people will stoop with sorrow; and when you have gone to the earth I will let my hair grow long for your sake, I will wander through the wilderness in the skin of a lion.' The next day also, in the firs t light, Gilgamesh lamented; seven days and seven nights he wept for E nkidu, until the worm fastened on him. Only then he gave him up to the earth, for the Anunnaki, the judges, had seized him. Then Gilgamesh issued a proclamation through the la nd, he summoned them all, the coppersmiths, the gol dsmiths, the stone-workers, and commanded them, ëMake a stat ue of my friend.' The statue was fashioned with a g reat weight of lapis lazuli for the breast and of gold for the bod y. A table of hard-wood was set out, and on it a bo wl of carnelian filled with honey, and a bowl of lapis lazuli filled with butter. These he exposed and offered to the Sun; an d weeping he went away. "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Epic Of Gilgamesh 16 4 THE SEARCH FOR EVERLASTING LIFE BITTERLY Gilgamesh wept for his friend Enkidu; he w andered over the wilderness as a hunter, he roamed over the plains; in his bitterness he cried, ëHow can I rest, how can I be at peace? Despair is in my heart . What my brother is now, that shall I be when I am dead. Because I am a fraid of death I will go as best I can to find Utna pishtim whom they call the Faraway, for he has entered the assembly o f the gods.' So Gilgamesh travelled over the wilder ness, he wandered over the grasslands, a long journey, in search of U tnapishtim, whom the gods took after the deluge; an d they set him to live in the land of Dilmun, in the garden of the su n; and to him alone of men they gave everlasting li fe. At night when he came to the mountain passes Gilgam esh prayed: ëIn these mountain passes long ago I sa w lions, I was afraid and I lifted my eyes to the moon; I pray ed and my prayers went up to the gods, so now, O mo on god Sin, protect me.' When he had prayed he lay down to slee p, until he was woken from out of a dream. He saw t he lions round him glorying in life; then he took his axe in his h and, he drew his sword from his belt, and he fell u pon them like an arrow from the string, and struck and destroyed and scatt ered them. So at length Gilgamesh came to Mashu, the great mou ntains about which he had heard many things, which guard the rising and the setting sun. Its twin peaks are as h igh as the wall of heaven and its paps reach down t o the underworld. At its gate the Scorpions stand guard, half man and half d ragon; their glory is terrifying, their stare strik es death into men, their shimmering halo sweeps the mountains that guard the rising sun. When Gilgamesh saw them he shielded hi s eyes for the length of a moment only; then he took courage and a pproached. When they saw him so undismayed the Man- Scorpion called to his mate, ëThis one who comes to us now i s flesh of the gods.' The mate of the Man-Scorpion answered, ëTwo thirds is god but one third is man.' Then he called to the man Gilgamesh, he called to t he child of the gods: ë Why have you come so great a journey; for what have you travelled so far, crossing the da ngerous waters; tell me the reason for your coming? ' Gilgamesh answered, ëFor Enkidu; I loved him dearly, together we endured all kinds of hardships; on his account I have come, for the common lot of man has taken him. I have wept for hi m day and night, I would not give up his body for b urial, I thought my friend would come back because of my weeping. Si nce he went, my life is nothing; that is why I have travelled here in search of Utnapishtim my father; for men say he has entered the assembly of the gods, and has found ev erlasting life: I have a desire to question him, concerning the livin g and the dead.' The Man-Scorpion opened his mouth and said, speaking to Gilgamesh, ëNo man born of woman has do ne what you have asked, no mortal man has gone into the mountain; the length of it is twelve leagues of dar kness; in it there is no light, but the heart is op pressed with darkness. From the rising of the sun to the setting of the su n there is no light.' Gilgamesh said, ëAlthough I s hould go in sorrow and in pain, with sighing and with weeping, still I mus t go. Open the gate ' of the mountain:' And the Man -Scorpion said, ëGo, Gilgamesh, I permit you to pass through the mountai n of Mashu and through the high ranges; may your fe et carry you safely home. The gate of the mountain is open.' When Gilgamesh heard this he did as the Man-Scorpio n had said, he followed the sun's road to his risin g, through the mountain. When he had gone one league the darkn ess became thick around him, for there was no light , he could see nothing ahead and nothing behind him. After two le agues the darkness was thick and there was no light , he could see nothing ahead and nothing behind him. After three l eagues the darkness was thick, and there was no w l ight, he could see nothing ahead and nothing behind him. After four le agues the darkness was thick and there was no light , he could see nothing ahead and nothing behind him. At the end of five leagues the darkness was thick and there was no light, he could see nothing ahead and nothing behind him. At the en d of six leagues the darkness was thick and there w as no light, he could see nothing ahead and nothing behind him. Whe n he had gone seven leagues the darkness was thick and there was no light, he could see nothing ahead and nothing be hind him. When he had gene eight leagues Gilgamesh gave a great cry, for the darkness was thick and he could see nothing ahead and nothing behind him. After nine leagues h e felt the north- wind on his face, but the darkness was thick and th ere was no light, he could see nothing ahead and no thing behind him. After ten leagues the end was near: After eleven le agues the dawn light appeared. At the end of twelve leagues the sun streamed out. There was the garden of the gods; all round him sto od bushes bearing gems. Seeing it he went down at o nce, for there was fruit of carnelian with the vine hanging from it, beautiful to look at; lapis lazuli leaves hung thick with fruit, sweet to see. For thorns and thistles there were ha ematite and rare stones, agate, and pearls from out of the sea. While Gilgamesh walked in the garden by the edge of the s ea Shamash saw him, and he saw that he was dressed in the skins of animals and ate their flesh. He was distressed, and he spoke and said, ëNo mortal man has gone this wa y before, nor will, as long as the winds drive over the sea.' And to Gi lgamesh he said, ëYou will never find the life for which you are"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Epic Of Gilgamesh 17 searching.' Gilgamesh said to glorious Shamash, ëNo w that I have toiled and strayed so far over the wi lderness, am I to sleep, and let the earth cover my head for ever? Le t my eyes see the sun until they are dazzled with l ooking. Although I am no better than a dead man, still let me see the lig ht of the sun.' Beside the sea she lives, the woman of the vine, th e maker, of wine; Siduri sits in the garden at the edge of the sea, with the golden bowl and the golden vats that the g ods gave her. She is covered with a veil; and where she sits she sees Gilgamesh coming towards her, wearing skins, the fl esh of the gods in his body, but despair in his hea rt, and his face like the face of one who has made a long journey. She lo oked, and as she scanned the distance she said in h er own heart, ëSurely this is some felon; where is he going now? And she barred her gate against him with the cross- bar and shot home the bolt. But Gilgamesh, hearing the sound of the b olt, threw up his head and lodged his foot in the g ate; he called to her, ëYoung woman, maker of wine, why do you bolt your d oor; what did you see that made you bar your gate? I will break in your door and burst in your gate, for I am Gilgames h who seized and killed the Bull of Heaven, I kille d the watchman of the cedar forest, I overthrew Humbaba who lived in the forest, and I killed the lions in the passes of the mountain.' Then Siduri said to him, íIf you are that Gilgamesh who seized and killed the Bull of Heaven, who kill ed the watchman of the cedar forest, who overthrew Humbaba that lived in the forest, and killed the lions in the passes of the mountain, why are your cheeks so starved and why is your face so drawn? Why is despair in your heart a nd your face like the face of one who has made a long journey? Yes, w hy is your face burned from heat and cold, and why do you come here wandering over the pastures in search of the w ind? Gilgamesh answered her, ëAnd why should not my chee ks be starved and my face drawn? Despair is in my h eart and my face is the face of one who has made a long jour ney, it was burned with heat and with cold. Why sho uld I not wander over the pastures in search of the wind? My friend, my younger brother, he who hunted the wild ass of the wilderness and the panther of the plains, nay friend, my younger b rother who seized and killed the Bull of Heaven and overthrew Humbaba in the cedar forest, my friend who was very dear to me and who endured dangers beside me, Enki du my brother, whom I laved, the end of mortality has ove rtaken him. I wept far him seven days and nights ti ll the worm fastened on him. Because of my brother I am afraid of death, because of my brother I stray through the wilderne ss and cannot rest. But now, young woman, maker of wine, since I have s een your face do not let me see the face of death w hich I dread so much.' She answered, ëGilgamesh, where are you hurrying to ? You will never find that life for which you are l ooking. When the gods created man they allotted to him deat h, but life they retained in their own keeping. As for you, Gilgamesh, fill your belly with good things; day and night, ni ght and day, dance and be merry, feast and rejoice. Let your clothes be fresh, bathe yourself in water, cherish the little child that holds your hand, and make your wife happ y in your embrace; for this too is the lot of man.' But Gilgamesh said to Siduri, the young woman, ëHow can I be silent, how can I rest, when Enkidu whom I love is dust, and I too shall die and be laid in the earth. You live by the sea-shore and look into the heart of it; young woman, tell me now, which is the way to Utnapishtim, the son of Ubara-Tutu? What directions are there for the pass age; give me, oh, give me directions. I will cross the Ocean if it is possible; if it is not I will wander still farther in the wilderness.' The wine- maker said to him, 'Gilgamesh, there is no crossing the Ocean; whoever has come, since the days of old , has not been able to pass that sea. The Sun in his glory crosses the Ocean, but who beside Shamash has ever crossed it? The place and the passage are difficult, and the waters of death are deep which flow between. Gilgamesh, how will you cr oss the Ocean? When you come to the waters of death what will you do? But Gilgamesh, down in the woods you will find Urshanabi, the ferryman of Utnapishtim; with him are the holy thin gs, the things of stone. He is fashioning the serpe nt prow of the boat. Look at him well, and if it is possible, perhaps yo u will cross the waters with him; but if it is not possible, then you must go back.' When Gilgamesh heard this he was seized with anger. He took his axe in his hand, and his dagger from h is belt. He crept forward and he fell on them like a javelin. T hen he went into the forest and sat down. Urshanabi saw the dagger flash and heard the axe, and he beat his head, for Gilgam esh had shattered the tackle of the boat in his rag e. Urshanabi said to him, ëTell me, what is your name? I am Urshanabi, t he ferryman of Utnapishtim the Faraway.'' He replie d to him, ëGilgamesh is my name, I am from Uruk, from the hou se of Anu.' Then Urshanabi said to him, ëWhy are yo ur cheeks so starved and your face drawn? Why is despair in your heart and your face like the face of one who has m ade a long journey; yes, why is your face burned with heat and with cold, and why do you come here wandering over the pastures in search of the wind? Gilgamesh said to him, ëWhy should not my cheeks be starved and my face drawn? Despair is in my heart, and my face is the face of one who has made a long journey . I was burned with heat and with cold. Why should I not wander over the pastures? My friend, my younger brother who sei zed and killed the Bull of Heaven, and overthrew Hu mbaba in the cedar forest, my friend who was very dear to me, an d who endured dangers beside me, Enkidu my brother whom I loved, the end of mortality has overtaken him. I wept for him seven days and nights till the worm fastened on him. Because of my brother I am afraid of death, because of my brot her I stray through the wilderness. His fate lies h eavy upon me. How"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Epic Of Gilgamesh 18 can I be silent, how can I rest? He is dust and I t oo shall die and be laid in the earth for ever. I a m afraid of death, therefore, Urshanabi, tell me which is the road to Utnapishtim ? If it is possible I will cross the waters of deat h; if not I will wander still farther through the wilderness.' Urshanabi said to him, ëGilgamesh, your own hands h ave prevented you from crossing the Ocean; when you destroyed the tackle of the boat you destroyed its safety.' Then the two of them talked it over and Gi lgamesh said, ëWhy are you so angry with me, Urshanabi, for you yourse lf cross the sea by day and night, at all seasons y ou cross it' ëGilgamesh, those things you destroyed, their prope rty is to carry me over the water, to prevent the w aters of death from touching me. It was for this reason that I preserve d them, but you have destroyed them, and the \u000e \u0004 \u000e snakes with them. But now, go into the forest, Gilgamesh; with your a xe cut poles, one hundred and twenty, cut them sixt y cubits long, paint them with bitumen, set on them ferrules and bring t hem back.' When Gilgamesh heard this he went into the forest, he cut poles one hundred and twenty; he cut them si xty cubits long, he painted them with bitumen, he set on them ferrules, and he brought them to Urshanabi. Then th ey boarded the boat, Gilgamesh and Urshanabi together, launching i t out on the waves of Ocean. For three days they ra n on as it were a journey of a month and fifteen days, and at last Ur shanabi brought the boat to the waters of death: Th en Urshanabi said to Gilgamesh, ëPress on, take a pole and thrust it in, but do not let your hands touch the waters. Gilgam esh, take a second pole, take a third, take a fourth pole. Now, Gilgam esh, take a fifth, take a sixth and seventh pole. G ilgamesh, take an eighth, and ninth, a tenth pole. Gilgamesh, take an eleventh, take a twelfth pole.' After one hundred and twenty thrusts Gilgamesh had used the last pole. Then he stripped himself, he held up his arms for a mast and his cov ering for a sail. So Urshanabi the ferryman brought Gilgamesh to Utnapis htim, whom they call the Faraway, who lives in Dihn un at the place of the sun's transit, eastward of the mountain. To him alone of men the gods had given everlasting lif e. Now Utnapishtim, where he lay at ease, looked into the distance and he said in his heart, musing to hi mself, ëWhy does the boat sail here without tackle and mast; wh y are the sacred stones destroyed, and why does the master not sail the boat? That man who comes is none of mine; where I look I see a man whose body is covered with skin s of beasts. Who is this who walks up the shore behind Urshanabi , for surely he is no man of mine? So Utnapishtim l ooked at him and said, ëWhat is your name, you who come here wearing the skins of beasts, with your cheeks starved and your face drawn? Where are you hurrying to now? For what reason have you made this great journey, crossing \"the seas wh ose passage is difficult? Tell me the reason for your coming.' He replied, 'Gilgamesh is my name. I am from Uruk, from the house of Anu.' Then Utnapishtim said to hi m, ëIf you are Gilgamesh, why are your cheeks so starved and y our face drawn? Why is despair in your heart and yo ur face like the face of one who has made a long journey? Yes, why i s your face burned with heat and cold; and why do y ou come here, wandering over the wilderness in search of the wind ? Gilgamesh said to him, ëWhy should not my cheeks be starved and my face drawn? Despair is in my heart and my face is the face of one who has made a long journey . It was burned with heat and with cold. Why should I not wander over the pastures? My friend, my younger brother who sei zed and killed the Bull of Heaven and overthrew Hum baba in the cedar forest, my friend who was very dear to me and endured dangers beside me, Enkidu, my brother whom I loved, the end of mortality has overtaken him. I wept for him seven days and nights till the worm fastened on him . Because of my brother I am afraid of death; because of my brother I stray through the wilderness. His fate lies heav y upon me. How can I be silent, how can I rest? He is dust and I shall d ie also and be laid in the . earth for ever.' Again Gilgamesh said, speaking to Utnapishtim, ëIt is to see Utnapishtim whom we c all the Faraway that I have come this journey. For. this I have wandered over the world, I have crossed many diffic ult ranges, I have crossed the seas, I have wearied myself with travelling; my joints are aching, and I have lost a cquaintance with sleep which is sweet. My clothes w ere worn out before I came to the house of Siduri. I have killed the be ar and hyena, the lion and panther, the tiger, the stag and the ibex, all sorts of wild game and the small creatures of the p astures. I ate their flesh and I wore their skins; and that was how I came to the gate of the young woman, the maker of wine, who barred her gate of pitch and bitumen against me . But from her I had news of the journey; so then I came to Urshanab i the ferryman, and with him I crossed over the wat ers of death. Oh, father Utnapishtim, you who have entered the assemb ly of the gods, I wish to question you concerning t he living and the dead, how shall I find the life for which I am sear ching? Utuapishtim said, ëThere is no permanence. Do we bu ild a house to stand for ever, do we seal a contrac t to hold for all time? Do brothers divide an inheritance to keep for ever, does the flood-time of rivers endure? It is only the nymph of the dragon-fly who sheds her larva and sees the sun in his glory. From the days of old there is no per manence. The sleeping and the dead, how alike they are, they are like a painted death. What is there between the ma ster and the servant when both have fulfilled their doom? When the Anunn aki, the judges, come together, and Mammetun the mo ther of destinies, together they decree the fates of men. L ife and death they allot but the day of death they do not disclose.' Then Gilgamesh said to Utnapishtim the Faraway, ëI look at you now, Utnapishtim, and your appearance i s no different from mine; there is nothing strange in yo ur features. I thought I should find , you like a hero prepared for battle, but you he here taking your ease on your back.

That city grew old and the gods tha t were in it were old. There was Anu,-lord of the firmament, the ir father, and warrior Enlil their counsellor, Ninu rta the helper, and Ennugi watcher over canals; and with them also was E a . In those days the world teemed, the people mult iplied, the world bellowed like a wild bull, and the great god was ar oused by the clamour. Enlil heard the clamour and h e said to the gods in council, \"The uproar of mankind is intolerable and sleep is no longer possible by reason of the babel. \" So the gods agreed to exterminate mankind. Enlil did this, but Ea beca use of his oath warned me in a dream. He whispered their words to my house of reeds, \"Reed-house, reed-house! Wall, O wa ll, hearken reed-house, wall reflect; O man of Shur rupak, son of Ubara-Tutu; tear down your house and build a boat, abandon possessions and look for life, despise worl dly goods and save your soul alive. Tear down your house, I say, and b uild a boat. These are the measurements of the barq ue as you shall build her: let hex beam equal her length, let her d eck be roofed like the vault that covers the abyss; then take up into the boat the seed of all living creatures.\" ëWhen I had understood I said to my lord, \"Behold, what you have commanded I will honour and perform, but how shall I answer the people, the city, the elders?\" Then Ea opened his mouth and sai d to me, his servant, \"Tell them this: I have learnt that Enlil is wrathful against me, I dare no longer walk in his land nor live in his city; I will go down to th e Gulf to dwell with Ea my lord. But on you he will rain down abundance, rare fish and shy wild-fowl, a rich harvest-tide. In the evening the rider of the storm will bring y o u wheat in torrents.\" ëIn the first light of dawn all my household gathered round me, the children brought pitch and the men whatever was necessary. On the fifth day I laid the keel and the ribs, then I made fast the planking. The ground-space was one acre, each side of the deck measured one hundred and twenty cubits, making a square. I built six decks below, seven in all, I divided them into nine sections with bulkheads between. I drove in wedges where needed, I saw to the punt poles, and laid in supplies. The carriers brought oil in baskets, I poured pitch into the fur nace and asphalt and oil; more oil was consumed in caulking, and more again the master of the boat too k into his stores. I slaughtered bullocks for the peo ple and every day I killed sheep. I gave the shipwright s wine to drink as though it were river water, raw wi ne and red wine and oil and white wine. There was feasting then as -there is at the time of the N e w Y ear's festival; I myself anointed m y head. On the s eventh day the boat was complete. -íThen was the launching full of difficulty; there was shifting of ballast above and below till two th irds was submerged. I loaded into her all that 1 had of gold and of living things, my family, my kin, the beast of the field both wild and tame, and all the craftsmen. I sent them o n boa rd, for the time that Shamash had ordained was alre ady fulfilled when he said, \"in the evening, when the rider of th e storm sends down the destroying rain, enter the b oat and batten her down.\" The time was fulfilled, the evening came , the rider of the storm sent down the rain. I look ed out at the weather and it was terrible, so I too boarded the b oat and battened her down. All was now complete, th e battening and the caulking; so I handed the tiller to Puzur-A murri the steersman, with the navigation and the ca re of the whole boat."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Epic Of Gilgamesh 21 ëWith the first light of dawn a black cloud came fr om the horizon; it thundered within where Adad, lor d of the storm was riding. In front over hill and plain Shul lat and Hanish, heralds of the storm, led on. Then the gods of the abyss rose up; Nergal pulled out the dams of the ne ther waters, Ninurta the war-lord threw down the dy kes, and the seven judges of hell, the Annunaki, raised their to rches, lighting the land with their livid flame. A stupor of despair went up to heaven when the god of the storm turned daylight to darkness, when he smashed the land like a cup. One whole day the tempest raged, gathering fury as .it went, it poured over the people like the tides of b attle; a imam could not see his brother nor the people be seen fr om heaven. Even the gods were terrified at the floo d, they fled to the highest heaven, the firmament of Ann; they crou ched against the walls, cowering like curs. Then Is htar the sweet-voiced Queen of Heaven cried out like a woman in travail: \"Alas the days -of old are turned to d ust because I commanded evil; why did I command thus evil in the council of all the gods? I commanded wars to destro y the people, but are they not my people, for I brought t hem forth? Now like the spawn of fish they float in the ocean.\" The great gods of heaven and of hell wept, they cov ered their mouths. ëFor six days and six nights the winds blew, torren t and tempest and flood overwhelmed the world, temp est and flood raged together like warring hosts. When t he seventh day dawned the storm from the south subs ided, the sea grew calm, the, flood was stilled; I looked at the face of the world and there was silence, all ma nkind was turned to clay. The surface of the sea stretched as flat a s a roof-top; I opened a hatch and the light fell o n my face. Then I bowed low, I sat down and I wept, the tears streame d down my face, for on every side was the waste of water. I looked for land in vain, but fourteen leagues dista nt there appeared a mountain, and there the boat gr ounded; on the mountain of Nisir the boat held fast, she held fast and did not budge. One day she held, and -a second day on the mountain of Nisir she held fast and did not budge. A third day, and a fourth day she held fast on the mountain and did not budge; a fifth day and a sixth day she held fast on the mountain. When the seventh day dawned I loosed a dove and let her go. She flew away, but finding no resting-place she returned. Then I loosed a swallow , and she flew away but finding no resting-place she returned. I l oosed a raven, she saw that the waters had retreate d, she ate, she flew around, she cawed, and she did not come back. Then I threw everything open to the four winds, I m ade a sacrifice and poured out a libation on the mountain top. Seven and again seven cauldrons I set up on t heir stands, I heaped up wood and cane and cedar and myrtle. When the gods smelled the sweet savour, they gathered li ke flies over the sacrifice. Then, at last, Ishtar also came , she lifted her necklace with the jewels of heaven that once Anu had made to please her. \"O you gods here present, b y the lapis lazuli round my neck I shall remember t hese days as I remember the jewels of my throat; these last days I shall not forget. Let all the gods gather round th e sacrifice, except Enlil. He shall not approach this offering, for wit hout reflection he brought the flood; he consigned my people to destruction.\" ëWhen Enlil had come, when he saw the boat, he was wrath and swelled with anger at the gods, the host of heaven, \"Has any of these mortals escaped? Not one was to h ave survived the destruction.\" Then the god of the wells and canals Ninurta opened his mouth and said to the warrior En lil, \"Who is there of the gods that can devise with out Ea?

So she baked loaves of bread, each day one loaf, an d put it beside his head, and she marked on the wal l the days that he slept; and there came a day when the first loaf was hard, the second loaf was like leather, the thi rd was soggy, the crust of the fourth had mould, the fifth was mildewed, th e sixth was fresh, and the seventh was still on the embers.

He renewed the fil let on his forehead, and to cover his nakedness gave him cloth es which would show no sign of age, but would war l ike a new garment till he reached his own city, and his journ ey was accomplished. Then Gilgamesh and Urshanabi launched the boat on t o the water and boarded it, and they made ready to sail away; but the wife of Utnapishtim the Faraway said to him , `Gilgamesh came here wearied out, he is worn out; what will you give him to carry him back to his own country? So U tnapishtim spoke, and Gilgamesh took a pole and bro ught the boat in to the bank. `Gilgamesh, you came here a man wearie d out, you have worn yourself out; what shall I giv e you to carry you back to your own country? Gilgamesh, I shall re veal a secret thing, it is a mystery of the gods th at I am telling you. There is a plant that grows under the water, it has a prickle like a thorn, like a rose; it will wound your hands, but if you succeed in taking it, then your hands will hold tha t which restores his lost youth to a man: When Gilgamesh heard this he opened the sluices so that a sweet water current might carry him out to t he deepest channel; he tied heavy stones to his feet and they dragged him down to the water-bed. There he saw the plant growing;; although it pricked him he took it in his hands; th en he cut the heavy stones from his feet, and the s ea carried him and threw him on to the shore. Gilgamesh said to Urshan abi the ferryman, `Come here, and see this marvello us plant. By its virtue a man may win back all his former strength. I will take it to Uruk of the strong walls; there I will give it to the old men to eat. Its name shall be \"The Old Men Are Youn g Again\"; and at last I shall eat it myself and hav e back all my lost youth.' So Gilgamesh returned by the gate through w hich he had come, Gilgamesh and Urshanabi went toge ther. They travelled their twenty leagues and then they broke their fast; after thirty leagues they stopped for t he night. Gilgamesh saw a well of cool water and he went down and bathed; but deep in the pool there was lying a serpent, and the serpent sensed the sweetness of the flower. It rose out of the water and snatched it away, and immediately it sloughed its skin and returned to the well. Then Gi lgamesh sat down and wept, the tears ran down his f ace, and he took the hand of Urshanabi; ëO Urshanabi, was it for this th at I toiled with my hands, is it for this I have wr ung out my heart's blood? For myself I have gained nothing; not I, but the beast of the earth has joy of it now. Already the stream has carried"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Epic Of Gilgamesh 23 it twenty leagues back to the channels where I foun d it. I found a sign and now I have lost it. Let us leave the boat on the bank and go.' After twenty leagues they broke their fast, after t hirty leagues they stopped for the night; in three days they had walked as much as a journey of a month and fifteen days. When the journey was accomplished they arrive d at Uruk, the strong-walled city. Gilgamesh spoke to him, to Ursh anabi the ferryman, ëUrshanabi, climb up on to the wall of Uruk, inspect its foundation terrace, and examine well th e brickwork; see if it is not of burnt bricks; and did not the seven wise men lay these foundations? One third of the whole i s city, one third is garden, and one third is field , with the precinct of the goddess Ishtar. These parts and the precinct ar e all Uruk.' This too was the work of Gilgamesh, the king, who k new the countries of the world. He was wiseÑ he saw mysteries and knew secret things, he brought us a tale of the days before the flood. He went a long journey, was weary, worn out with labour, and returning engraved on a stone the whole story.

The heroes , the wise men, like the n e w moon have their waxing and waning. Men will say, \"Who has ever ruled with migh t and with power like him?\" As in the dark month, t he month of shadows, so without him there is no light. O Gil gamesh, this was the meaning of your dream. Y o u wer e given the kingship, such was your destiny, everlasting li fe was not your destiny. Because of this do not be sad at heart, do not be grieved o r oppressed; he has given y o u power to bind and to loose, to be the darkness and the l ight of mankind. He has given unexampled supremacy over the people, victory in battle from which no fugitive r eturns, in forays and assaults from which there is no going ba ck. But d o not abuse this power, deal justly with y our servants in the palace, deal justly before the face of the Sun.
