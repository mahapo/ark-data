Were still wet, had been ill from the s ea. Two of amphorae appeared intact - after a few millennia! - Were still closed, sealed. I thought that contain olive oil or wine, which should already be much spoiled. The diver in h is black clothes, rubber, raised the body and showed something even more precious: t he head of a young Greek, in bronze, covered by green skating. The orbits o f the eyes were not empty, the white of the eye was the mother of pearl, inlaid, and rainbow, brown, clipped from a shell, and glossy black, the pupil, was obsidian, volcanic glass. Beside the head was a piece mechanical, mashed and yet fully anyway, also cov ered with green skate, a wheel similar to a large clock. I remember the feeling I tri ed to include those objects, I felt admiration for the head and precious joy to identify the mechanical part, functional. However, also experienced a bit of irritation, because obviously I came late, missed the timing of the withdrawal of these objects of ocean bo ttom. Besides, I have my external regret this, because then the diver turned to me. With a significant gesture, he opened his hand and showed me a small gold bar, make no word, but to make me realize that, for him, all the rest was of little importance, with out comparable value. Instead of the stamp, specifying the weight and fineness of gold bar, sym bols discern it seemed weird that I know. One way or another, one small bar of gol d made me remember a ceremony of launching cornerstone, when usually buried so me coins and a newspaper of the day. What tremendous chance, out of range! This w ay, - so I thought - once the chofre, we were able to penetrate the very heart of the real city of Basel, in treasure, saved the Temple of Poseidon. I tried to fix the time a nd date of the event and with the movement I made to look ^ my watch, I have agreed. Were little more than 5h, and I was to get up at 5 and a half. The day before, on April 17, 1972, colleagues and I landed the vessel, the Isle of You; ship our luggage and our e quipment to Fira, where dealing rooms, previously reserved in the hotel \"Atlanti s.\" The window see the Caldera, the bay of blue waters, once the main Santor im crater on the volcano whose center designed a new cone, the island Nea Kameni. Year after year, there transhipped the magma fluid and fiery, as reminiscent of times remo tíssimos the volcano made the earth tremble, arguing that awful rash that, according to a theory much discussed, would have caused the disappearance of Atlantis. As for the dream which woke up, their inspirations detail s were not \"extra-sensory\" but the memory alive of impressions taken, a short time a go in Athens and previously elsewhere. The amphorae on board were related to Jacques -Yves Cousteau, who met in 1953 in Munich, there when he presented his book and film \"SILENCERS THE WORLD.\" We talked about the \"aqualung\", lung water he invent ed, which is to be brought back and to allow full freedom of movement and act ion during the dive, we talk about the depths of delirium, the possibility of trea sure-hunters and archeology"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" underwater. To complete the radio interview, I asked if t he Cousteau could never have thought to seek traces of Atlantis. He replied, in very diplomatic way, already thought about this, but stressed that involve delicate issue tha t, once we leave in the center of disputes waged between scientists and technicians. Howeve r, it seems, Cousteau has not lost sight of the problem of Atlantis. Now even a s I write this preface, get on my desk a note from German television, saying, \"Jacques-Yve s Cousteau, the underwater research of 65 years, will address the ATLANTIC project. The Aegean Sea, mainly in the region of Santorim, his team of 30 divers will sear ch for the remains of the legendary Atlantis and explore the theories of Atlantis , raised by Jürgen Spanuth (Heligoland), admitted as a supposed \"places of finding\" the A zores Islands, Bimini (Florida), Lanzarote (Islas Islands) and the Atlas moun tains in Morocco. \" As for the other parts recovered and exposed in the boat with which I dreamed, I was able to see them, just before, at the National Museum in Athens. The couple, from embedded eyes, was recovered by divers, the cata of spong es, the wreck of a wreck, found a 60m deep, facing the Greek island of Anticitera. The re was also found that gear, the \"machine Anticitera\" which, on the occasio n of my visit, was not exposed to public visitation, but at my request, was brought to a depot for a small room, where I had occasion to see it. Until now, it was also found a nother piece, this is a kind of clock mechanism, the pine nuts are clearly identifiable , in the master wheel-there are 240 teeth, worked with high accuracy. It might be an instrum ent to record the route and speed of the ship. An entry located the source of the machine in the century that preceded the birth of Christ. This is further evidence o f the fact remains imperfect as our knowledge concerning the antiquity. Until now, little or nothing was known of a civilization capable of producing mechanisms of this spec ies. Even where this technique, really, back in time? Which had its origin an d was developed, originally? As the symbols in the small bar of gold, seen in my dr eam, made me remember the famous disk of Festo, a disc of clay of 16 cm in diameter, displayed in the museum of Heracles, on the island of Crete in armored glass windo w. The symbols on the disc are not recorded a burin but stamped. The production of such stam ps in anticipation of the invention of printing characters, from Gutenberg, the pur pose is to edit the text, in series. This is a visual writing, not yet deciphered. So far not found another similar piece. Could have been a schedule for the crews of ships in use among the maritime nations, a sort of book of illustrations and reading for sailors, is that a reasonably plausible proposal for the solution to the puzzle. Other s cholars saw that piece natural rhythmic articulation of the text of a poem in two st anzas of ten verses each, perhaps the magical-religious plot. Also, could be related to the Atlantis, as the symbol stamped what attracts attention is the head of a man, covered with a feathered hat, this is the \"crown of rays.\" Jürgen Spanuth, the pastor of co mbatant Bordelum in North Frisia, located in Atlantis near Helgoland and posits th e \"great migration\" of the peoples of the North, under macaréus catastrophic, at whi ch have reached the borders of Egypt. Spanuth refers to frescoes of Medinet Habu, the temple of the palace of Ramses III (1200-1168 BC), in front of Luxor. Those frescoes show the pharaoh in battle with the warriors of maritime nations, beari ng those same \"wreaths of lightning\", highly decorative. Also, the rowers, whose image appears on a knife, to the Bronze Age, found in Bremen, Federal Germany, bearing in your he ad the same ornament, which also appears in Scandinavian offices. Spanuth cons iders this fact as important evidence. So strange, the play found in Bremen shows an entire ship, mounted with the \"ray\", giving the impression of a fire Santelmo styliz ed. It was in 1969 that J.V. Luce, professor in Dublin, raised the possibility of Atlantis has"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" been located in the Aegean. His book \"ATLANTIS - Legend and Reality\" was prefaced by Sir Mortimer Wheeler, one of the great nam es of Archeology, who wrote: \"In 1909, a young scientist from Belfast outside the bright idea, saying that the country of the Atlantic, and wrapped into mysterious legends, it i s reminiscent of a great kingdom, superb, from Minos, on the Island of Crete, whos e splendor was then to be known for our modern world, thanks to the work of Sir Art hur Evans and other pioneers. \" The young scientist, mentioned by Sir Morti mer was K. T. Frost, in time, their chances went almost unnoticed. Moreover, Sir Mo rtimer Wheeler believes teachers and Athenians Marinatos Galanopoulou key figures, to \"give the current reporting timetable and contribute primarily to the rest oration of its global aspect.\" Meanwhile, Spiridon Marinatos, inspector-general of Gre ek antiquities, has been famously successful in its work on the Isle of You - San torim. Near Akrotiri in the south of the island, managed to dig minóica a city that, like Pompeii, was buried under masses of lava and other volcanic products of projection , responsible for its perfect condition. However, there were no bones, and coins, j ewelry or any precious transportable, presumably, the residents received notice by the earthquake and had left the city when the disaster occurred. The plaster fell f rom walls and broken into a thousand pieces, was joined by archaeologists and the mos t beautiful frescoes, thus reconstituted, were taken to the National Museum in Athe ns. Thus, again a room decorated with lilies and couples of swallows, bearing im ages of other kids fighting in the box, African antelopes, monkeys, blue. In that env ironment, the prof. Marinatos granted me an interview for television. He spoke in Ger man and spoke this quote: \"You know that after the Holy Scriptures, the greatest n umber of books was published on the Atlantis. The Atlantis is the issue that elec trify the masses and the general public and people cultured. Therefore, I would assume that the explo sion and destruction of the small island of Santorim gave rise to the creatio n of legend, who speaks in the sunset of an island wide, rich and superb. The island of C rete was eliminated, along with Santorim, Crete and the Egyptians had in mind. Ever ything else, an island real, real, with all its political institutions and technica l facilities, appeared in the fantasy of Plato, he was always an idea, indeed the very word \"idea \" and it is world of ideas is a Platonic concept. It was Plato who created the idea of an ideal state and also the idea of Atlantis. \" Later, after taking the microphone from his hands, asked the prof. Marinatos would not be valid if the search for Atlanti s in other places in the regions of Heligoland, or in the Azores archipelago. \"Why not?\" re plied, \"The islands of the people happy and there will be found there and, perhaps, be f ound the remains of civilizations disappeared. Near the Azores? Also there could be found to Atlantis, a part of paradise lost. Maybe one day, I even write a bo ok about Atlantis. \" Prof.. Marinatos did not realize your dream, because in October 1974, the scientist died, the 73 years of age, his death was accidental and occurred shor tly before the end of the season of excavations near Akrotiri, where was hit b y the fall of the wall minóico a palace, whose excavation was under his direction. On the day following the interview with Prof.. Marina tos, was received by Prof. Galanopoulou Angelos, who directs the Center earthquakes, l ocated in the top of a small hill at the foot of the Acropolis. He apologized for his English, which would not give for an interview before the TV cameras, but gentl y, put it at our disposal. During the interview, Prof.. Galanopoulou proved to be much more decisive about the links, just outlined by Marinatos between the eruption of Santo rim and the narrative of Plato, in which our interviewees saw the incentive, the igni tion spark, the same material for a parable. Galanopoulou for the second hypothesis in 1960, the volcanic island of Tera-"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Santorim is identical to the island empire of Atlantis , and for him, where there was, around 1500 BC to Atlantis disappeared. Galanopoulou discussed very frankly with the \"weak points\" of his theory, of which only two ar e listed below. He thinks it could deal with a misunderstanding, when Plato speaks of Atlanti s one of the regions outside the Mediterranean. It sable that the \"Pillars of Her cules\" Gibraltar should not be, but the southern tip of the Peloponnese, the Cape of Matapan and Cape of Maléia. The Platonic passage in the narrative, saying that the disa ppearance of Atlantis would have been 9000 rather than 900 years before Solon, could have bee n interpreted in wrong way, including, over time, by the Solon. Maybe he read the wrong way of Egyptian symbols and misinterpreted what the Egyptian priest told h im. Until today these problems persist arithmetic, because in Europe milhardo a re a billion (1,000,000,000) when, in the U.S., this represents a billion. Also, Jürgen Spanuth considers certainly fail to affirm the Egyptian priest, concerning the \"cit izens\" who lived nine millennia ago, saying that \"in ancient literature, the fantasy da tings are frequent.\" However, this does not prove the fact of being accepted to foot the bi ll, only those portions of the Platonic narrative that fit perfectly in a particular theory, everything that does not fit into certain concepts have been explained as a misunders tanding or error. Because of this, I could not refrain from expressing some reservat ions about the Professor. Galanopoulou when, after the interview, he fired me. La ter learned that, meanwhile, the teacher herself has distanced the theory would have it raised, at the time, did not reveal anything that, because of the difficult otherwis e I would have presented her with a book, exposing his theses, and I delivered with a person al dedication. Galanopoulou's ideas were confirmed and supported by James W. Mavor, a renowned engineer and oceonógrafo, which came in the Aegean with the \"Alvin,\" the American ship that managed to find and retrieve an H bomb, lost o ff the Spanish coast. However, neither Mavor that in 1969, described his two expeditions i n the book \"Journey to Atlantis\" and so-sornente was based on the assumptions of Galanopoulou and recent results of the excavations, directed by Marinatos, man aged to present a proof concrete. Spanuth, in turn, criticized the very works of Luce and Ma vor, accusing them of \"gross typographical errors,\" many interpretations unacceptable, faulty data and erroneous statements, which completely invalidate the \"sensatio n of the year,\" arguing that \" Atlantis would be found in the Aegean. \" And, again, Jürgen Spanuth states the following regarding the location of Atlantis, \"as descri bed by Plato, the island empire would be\" the mouth of big rivers \"(Weser, Elbe, Eider) protected by\" a cliff very high and steep, coming from the sea, which stone was red, wh ite and black (Helgoland), where the Atlantide have found ore bronze, pure bronze a nd (probably) amber. The hill that, according to Plato, is located exactly 50 stages (= 9.2 km) behind the cliff, would not the \"submarine hill, called 'bottom of stone', wh ere 30 years ago, were discovered the remains of a German sanctuary. There is, once th e imperial city of Basel. \" E Spanuth summarizes: \"So the story of Atlantis is not a n account of the golden era of civilization minóica, but the golden era of Nordic civi lization of the Bronze Age, leading to around 1250 BC, with disasters, which caused migrati on of large parts of the Germanic peoples, forced to leave the lands of Nort hern Germany, Denmark and Scandinavia. The story of Atlantis is a Germania to the Bronze Age. \" Moreover, if interpreted literal data Platonic, giving t he location of Atlantis, then it should be sought in areas outside the Mediterranean, and Gi braltar ( \"outside the Pillars of Hercules\"), ie in the Atlantic Ocean . Ho wever, Spanuth notes that the Atlantic Ocean (as called by Athanasius Kircher at th e beginning of the seventeenth century, precisely because of there being a supposed state of Hawaii) should not be"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" confused with the okeanos the Atlantic Sea of authors o f antiquity. For them, the okeanos was not the sea between Europe and Africa, on t he one hand, and the two Americas, the other, but the sea within which sought A tlas, which held the sky on his shoulders, and the second Greek texts, this was always t he North Sea (a country of amber). Also Adolf Schulten, the famous German archaeologist, b orn in the city of Erlangen, who dedicated all his life to search for old Spain, sought the addition of Atlantis Columns of Hercules, but a relatively small distance fr om Gibraltar, near Seville, in mouth of the Guadalquivir River. Once in that area, at a ny point was located Tartessos that, years on end, was the object of his excavation s, one of the richest cities of antiquity, which, according to archaeologist Schulten, is identical to the Atlantis of Plato. Atlas was the name of the oldest king of Atlant is, and in the local vernacular, the twin brother of Atlas was called Gadir, which is rela ted to Cadiz. Many details mentioned by Plato on the Atlantis and referring to th e port, the channel leading to the open sea, find explanation in the place of the delta for med by the mouth of the Guadalquivir River. Also the great fortune of Tartessos ( = Atlantis), from the mountains of Andalusia silver and copper mines at Rio Tin to, with zinc alloy, with the bronze, it would fit in these theses. Unfortunately, S chulten, who early in this century carved the Iberian Numan-ness and the seven camps of Ci pião (185-129 BC), failed to find Tartessos. Perhaps the ancient Tartessos of Sevi lle is today and, one day, the works of earthworks for the cutting of a new skyscraper w ill bring to light the Atlântida desired by Schulten. Of course, the source of all the theories and assumption s is the following question: is the story of Atlantis a historical report, with any scrollwork poetic, like the Homeric Iliad, based on which Heinrich Schliemann was in sear ch of Troy? Or it would be free literary invention, a tale, a story, specifically dis closed by Plato and made circular in the four corners of the world? However, Plato explicitly e mphasizes the authenticity of his narrative, but this could be just the trick to increase the impact of what is narrated. Also, give thought to the fact that Aristotle, the fam ous pupil of Plato, Atlantis was deemed as a poetic fiction, because: \"The man who has dr eamed dreamed also fade the image.\" In little time later (about 300 BC) of Cantor On ly commented Platonic narrative and said, word for word, is the historical tr uth. Apparently, the commentator noted personally Egyptian sources, he says, the reports a re still there, the Pillars, to be read by those who wanted to read them. So if this were the case, inscriptions on monuments should be taken literal? For many times, stor ies passed through generations by oral tradition, even if inadvertently, have to be changed? And there are rare times that the messages, intended for posterior, transmit fac ts adulterated, embellished, manipulated by propaganda. It was in Egypt where the \"Histor y\" has been obliterated, altered, invented, omitting losses up, sublime is weak phar aohs, returning not, it is striking images and names of predecessors, so that, for a ll time, be forgotten. Despite the way as you evaluate the credibility of the texts, to which Plato refers, all the speculation about the enigma of Atlantis concentrated fo cus on these two poles: the narrative of Plato would be a mere invention, or a re port facts? Only those who take a report of facts might expect, rea l and effectively to find Atlantis. Undoubtedly, these claims come in the ambitious dreams o f Spanish and Portuguese navigators. In this sense must also be understood from t he word lapidary J. O. Thomson, saying that in a sense, Plato can be conside red as \"the discoverer of America.\" Thus, a \"History of the Indians, dating from some 60 years after the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus, set out th e idea of the transatlantic"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" continents represent the Atlantis. Why would have appear ed shortly after the proposal to call such a continent of Atlantis? At a later date , it is speculated about the identity of the Canary Islands or the Azores with the Atlantis a nd the possibility of this was that the bridge on which the civilizations were found on bot h sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Also, it would have been to Atlantis to launch these c ivilizations. Athanasius Kircher (1601-1680), the Jesuit scholar who studied the hieroglyphs and th e magic lantern, to find Atlantis in the region of the island of São Miguel in the Azores archipelago. Some two centuries later (in 1882), the American Ignatius Donne lly over the skein of yarn that same point, believes that the Dolphins called Dor sal, lifting underwater in the Azores, Atlantis would be missing. In less than 100 years , the work of Donnelly, \"ATLANTIS - THE WORLD ANTEDILUVIAL\" - Atlantis, the antediluvian world - came to be at least 50 editions. The author had the speci al gift of advertising, he was a member of the U.S. Congress, twice candidate is, but use lessly, for the post of vice president of the USA. Its \"discovery\", claiming that in fact the works of Shakespeare were produced by Sir Francis Bacon, had global repercussion s. This characterizes the person bold enough, the high intelligence and strength of i magination of Donnelly. However, although this might be right the basic idea and that he held positions in the back of the Atlantis Dolphin, however, until the days o f this argument remains valid today. With what Donnelly has a flavor of romance, w ithout substantial basis, and acquires various forums with the terminology of today's n atural sciences, with the options offered by modern ocean research. In 1954, Otto H. Muck published his first book on the Atlanti s, two years later, was published the second work \"ATLANTIS - DIE WELT DER VOR S INTFLUT\" - Atlantis, the world before the flood. Muck to the back o f the Dolphins fell to a depth of 3,000 m by virtue of a cosmic catastrophe, which also did the Atlantis of Plato disappear. Also, samples of soil from the ocean bed in t he Azores were interpreted by the Swedish Oceanologica Petterson to, unequivocally, th at entire area has been underwater since 20 million years at least. ( \"The theo ry of the Azores is dead, ultimately.\"). Not that Otto Muck capitulated. He brought t o the forum of debates, never stopped, a whole series of new viewpoints, often surprising, which I do not anticipate me. In any case, it is a pleasure to follow your argument, just the points to be considered with reservation, for which were not, o r rather, not yet conclusive evidence. The author was a fascinating man, and is also his fascinating book. Otto Heinrich Muck was born in Vienna in 1892 and, after the Fi rst World War studied at Polytechnic University in Munich. Graduated with Sommer feld, who was also master of Heisenberg *. Sommerfeld, Heisenberg second was the m an who, along with Niels Bohr, more influence in my life. \" During the Second Wo rld War, worked in Muck Peenemünde, with the rocket team, was one of the inven tors of \"Schnorchel\" for submarines. Over the years, some 2,000 Muck registered tradem arks, of which about 40 went to the construction of ships for the transport o f methane gas, the Greek shipowner Niarchos. Muck advised multinational industries, was a very high technical level and at the same time, dedicated to arts, be graphic artist of great talent. Died at 64 years, on November 7, 1956. The curriculum vitae of a man out of the ordinary, always in motion, notes the presence of cool ideas in his work on the Atlantis, which still presents a sequence of facts, susceptible of proof, which the imagination of the inventor and filmmaker gives sober the possible and proba ble, according to their category. The building at first edition quickly sold out and i n season, has not had the deserved effect has now been reissued, including in this e dition, new and functional, the report of new experiences and results of latest res earch."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Nowadays, cooperation between the various disciplines of natural sciences, often allows to solve archaeological problems and the easies t way conclusive that in times past, when there was cooperation between professional and amateur archaeologists. Thus, the test with carbon 14 to determine the age of bi ological material, with relative success, in 1960, the American scientist Libby won the N obel Prize for developing this method. Thus, remains of charcoal from the cave of La scaux, famous for its cave paintings of the Ice Age, 16,000 years ago revealed that, the re was a large fire. Without doubt, the carbon 14 dating was formed in \"authority \" modern, but proved to be failure more than once. Furthermore, the indices of a geological and mineralogical accuse inaccuracies and more. How many times it became necessary to correct dating prehistoric! I remember a visit to the museum in Malta , where I wanted to take note of the dates displayed in showcases, the director of the mus eum said, lamenting: \"This is now almost overcome. We no more can stay up to date.\" Therefore, it should use a certain amount of skepticism you look close a thread on a n archaeological dating to the terse comment, saying that \"it was decided a long time a go, so final, irrevocable.\" This was the great physician Rudolf Virchow who, with all th e weight of his knowledge and his experience, flatly denied the authenticity of the A ltamira cave paintings, dating from the Ice Age, which had just then being discovered. Simila rly, it was quite a negative attitude of Virchow, when Fuhlrott, modest master-of-sc hool, who discovered and correctly interpreted the skull of the Neandertal man, s ent to the eminent professor, to ask her opinion about it. In both cases, the authority was wrong and official denial perfectly valid at the time, today presents itself as un fair prejudice, short-sighted. Thus, the arguments of the past are overcome by always new di scoveries and speculations that, over time, enrich our knowledge. But even today, muc h still remains open, the daily meeting of proof and check in tough fight for the auth enticity and validity of assumptions. Therefore, it might be possible that the r ecorded narrative, transmitted by the Egyptians and disclosed by Plato, covering more than reminiscent of the one event of a disaster? Where is evident in the metamorphosis o f a tradition, with characters and events changing places. It would be perfectly acceptable t hat the story of Atlantis is not only and exclusively the traditions hitherto known. Mar inatos believed in a \"traditional legend of the Aegean\"; Spanuth view the report of a Atlân tida Germania Age of Bronze. Could well be that both were with the right an d at the same time, they were wrong, if, one day, the Atlantis be found both here and there. Possibly, the memory of that \"end of world\" must be assessed under the background of a tradition much older, about ten times older, a real event in cosmic dimensio ns of decisive influence in the cultural evolution of mankind. If we consider as valid the dating presented by Plato, ac cording to the files shown to Solon by Egyptian priests, that universal cataclysm, of which the man just kept vague memory, in fact had happened nine millennia and not nine centuries before the time of Solon; then the Atlantis, in fact, had then disappeared, swallowed by the waves of the Atlantic Ocean. In this respect, the \"continent\" of Atlantis, located in the work of Muck in the Azores, acquire new angles. Certainly, it is not coincidence when this new image of Atlantis appeared at the same time - some 40 yea rs ago - in which the man managed to disintegrate the atom and thereby discover new and dangerous fire - a decade ago - the foot of the Moon soil . In assessing t he history of mankind in this view, understand better what Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wro te in 1934: \"It is not difficult to understand and know well how and why the man, where pilgrims, the lack deals with such gardens that have been prepared by nature b ecause they live only for a short time for a geological period, for a happy day. \" The human civilization, said"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Exupéry \"is a veneer of gold, and thin, about to explode wi th a volcanic eruption, to be washed by the waters of a sea in training, to be burie d under a storm of sand.\" Ernst von Khuon INTRODUCTION It is not always easy to distinguish between poetry and reality, in the case of complex issues about when and where started the history of manki nd, the influence that has, or what remains still remembers his early days and key. Probably, man can never say what is life, from whic h. The evolution of Homo sapiens from the animal world, and this was confirmed also prov es the conditioning of humans on Earth, from whose fate ultimately share. Some portions of the paths towards humanity can be expla ined by the man, the Earth, the geology, especially in times of transition and cata clysms. Moreover, are almost exclusively those times to leave to posterity the rem ains of what once existed. Often, such evidence led to a recasting of the timetable for h umanity and gave new meaning to old traditions and myths. In the mid-50s, it was proved by all scientific discipline s, from archeology to ethnology, which is 10,500 years ago, there was a sudden shif t of the magnetic poles of Earth. Also the North Pole, geographic, until about 8500 BC in the southern regions of Greenland, suddenly, moved into 3,500 kilometers and came to b e in its current location. The figure of the page. 18 illustrates, schemati cally, the abrupt departure that, at the time, earned by a universal cataclysm. With the simultaneous displacement of the axle land, cre ated a new geological situation that, today, marks the beginning of the contemporary peri od. It is not here explain this phenomenon, called the removal of poles, is a migration of the poles, or the delgadíssima earth crust has shifted, with a sudden push. On the basis of tests with carbon 14, this date has been confirmed in numerous studies to date. Since the early 60s, U.S., Ireland, England and Northern Germany, the met hod of Geiger counter provided sensational dating, highlighting the period around 8500 BC as the date on Geology magna later. The report by Richard MacNeish, president of the Americ an Society of Archeology, published in 1971 in the journal \"Scientific American\", is the most important publications on the subject. According to that report, th e existence of human life in Ayacucho, Peru, can be proved from 25,000 years ago. Moreover , the research revealed that since 60,000 years in those regions Peruvian, the cycles of rise and decline of temperature was so clearly contrary to that of as occurring in North America. While North America has cold, the Peruvian h ighlands - modern - lived periods of heat, but the U.S. in those areas where the soil was tundra, were recorded periods of heat. These conditions prevailed up to about 8500 BC Since then, advances of glaciation in the South Americ an continent and the formation of glaciers in the Andes, which began at the time, do n ot correspond to more similar phenomena recorded during, say, from Wisconsin, North Ame rica, which also ended in 8500 BC approximately. \u0000 It seems that South America experienced its own geologic al fate, however, clarify the question remains whether this destination is explained o nly in the removal of poles."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" Thus, other factors also contributed, such as those res ponsible for lifting the port city of Tiahuanaco, now situated at 3,000 m above sea level.

The same applies to the northern areas, the central and eastern Siberia. The n, suddenly, came to the ice within 24 hours, huge forest cover. In turn, the directions of ocean currents is of decisiv e importance, therefore, always strongly influenced areas of glaciation.

A sudden and violent, as seen in the quality of archaeolo gical findings, testified that the man is 10,500 years ago was forced to start over from point zero and recover almost all things in your life. Except what is broadcast by th e legends, myths of all peoples, representing the major cosmogony of the world, know about the disasters was lost as the tradition of generations later became unintelligibl e. For example, it is known that the ancient chronicles, less than 10% were retained unt il the present time. Indeed, the excavations and traditions show that the astronomical and scientific knowledge of the Babylonians, Egyptians, of the Latin American peoples a nd their legacy was by earlier civilizations, the trail is lost in the shadows of t ime. For now, the science can only register the puzzles unso lved, which should continue as legends, to advance progress reaching process them. Despite the constant and major efforts to clarify it, to this day, still in the proc ess of legend all that happened in times past to the advent of the Hittite kingdom, until the time of cave paintings in the Sahara and in Southeast Europe. Strictly speaking, works of art, t he walls of the caves, still waiting for interpretation. However, the oldest epic of humanity, the Epic of Gilgamés, speaks of an intermediate period, covering no less than f our millennia. Between the time of cave paintings of Cro-Magnon and mo dern man's is a division, a mystery to be unveiled by the Archeology and Ethnology. But what happened in remotíssimos times and still without explanation, beco mes pawn in the hands of hidden forces, gods or ancestors, to that end, is worth up to r equirements or guaranteed by the Archaeological Geology, by way of evidence. Laws o f nature are abolished and, in a state of trance, the \"psychic\" Cayce viewing the At lantis, which in 1968/69 was \"discovered\" at sea, off the coast of Andros and Bimini . Surely this discovery relates to pre-historic buildings, now located in more than 100 m belo w sea level. Sometimes, however, that in the last ten millennia, the waters of the melting of vast glaciation in North America, Northern and Central Europe did rise in s ea level from 100 to 200 m. By way of speculation, it is perfectly legal in those pe st seek the cradle of humanity, with the fascinating name of Atlantis, that since th ose early days, he went from mere vestige of the greatest disaster of historical times, since antiquity has left us descriptions of countries missing that in his time were centers of advanced civilizations. Also, the rays reach the unacceptable, to the point of return for the existing laws of nature on Earth, the descriptions of the \"Triangle of D eath\", near the Bermuda, Puerto Rico and Florida, supposedly \"driven by powerful forces, ema nating from an advanced civilization of the submerged continent of Atlantis, w hich are still active \"and speaking"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" of\" energy sources, active until today, created by a civ ilization much older and different from us. \" (Charles Berlitz: \"The triangle of Bermuda\", 1975, London, Vienna). Indeed, for decades disappear in that area, aircraft and sh ips, without a trace, in past centuries, it disappeared from the Spanish boats, carryin g silver and minerals. The sea of lost ships \"as is called in Spain, it has its peculia rities, but offers no\" door or window to another dimension in space and time, through which ma y pass without effort, extraterrestrial beings, possession of proper scientifi c training. \" This singularity is even measurable, since in the Eart h's magnetic field, this area is the most unstable, limits in which the magnetic needle tem porarily stop responding. This peculiarity may be related to Atlantis, but in a differe nt way than suggested by all the speculation made so far. On land, the causes of the osci llations of magnetic needle always been linked to the occurrence of deposits of iron or nickel, at any time in any such deposits must have occurred in the triangle of Ber-se edlings. In that area, the profile of the deep ocean reveals two features, namely: some underwater cliffs of more than 7,000 m of oval and several kilometers in diameter. Supposed that they had suffered local impacts caused by the c ollapse of planetoid fragmented, say the group Adonis, which opened craters, mea nwhile submerged under its weight and its velocity of fall, these fragments o f the asteroid would have entered the ocean bed, entering it deeply, but without reaching th e magma fluid. The Earth is akin to a generator. A magnetic field is ge nerated not only by a magnet, in the form of bar, also a coil, which passes an electr ic current, can generate an external magnetic field, similar. When you place a coil around an iron core, the magnetic effect is considerably enhanced. To be connected to current, t he iron becomes, instantly, into a powerful magnet. Breaking up the flow of current, the magn etic field drops itself in that same instant and iron core ceases to acknowledge a ny measurable residual magnetism. The cranes of scrap working under this principle . Today, in the current phase of scientific progress, it is assumed that the eff ect for the Earth, above, is maintained and comes from depths of about 2900 km, is caused by the dynamo effect, ie by rotating moments different between the core and inner core foreign land, more cumbersome. Therefore, a magnetic field is not generate d, but varies the effect of self- excitation, with the core land, trapped under pressure, ser ving as a core of iron sweet, surrounding the Earth. In equatorial areas, the north-sout h magnetism is relatively weak, in contrast, the turbulence within the Earth is much stronger (second P. Kaiser). Thus, the earth crust is similar to a turbine wheel, w hich transmits its energy to various liquids which, in turn, provide impetus to the core rotatin g earth, by its internal friction. Obstacles arise in this process, causing set backs electrical systems in the area between the fluid outer core and internal, as are sever al gyroscopic systems to handle, surrounding each other. However, external nucleus of the Earth, these forces make to be coordinated in large part by terrestrial rotation. Also, do not yet know the degree of conductivity in the de pths, the velocity of movement of the currents of convection and penetrate f ar inland in the mantle, or the length of cycles of electric flows. In any case, are being influenced by the gyroscopic system of the Earth, which can either generate anoth er additional polar routes and directions of electric conduction, as effects side, espe cially near the equator. For the geophysical processes above-exposed, the sun is t he best object of research. It was only in the early 70s at the latest, that the prob lems of electric and magnetic fields inside the globe deserve the attention of geophysical re search, and since then have met considerable notions. When electric current spurious rea ch earth crust, it is understood what happens when a powerful current that reaches the nuc lei of iron and nickel,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" above, or even come to link them together. In fractio ns of seconds, a local magnetic field of tremendous intensity, is generated above the depo sits of iron and nickel, at depths from 15,000 to 20,000 m, the largest of the Earth, magneti c field that attracts each and every object containing iron or nickel which , inapelavelmente, going to the bed of the ocean, the more than 7,000 m deep. Even developin g aircraft speed are powerless to save itself from the energy field, certai nly changing, with power to influence it in daylight, it polarized. This polarization requires a medium, such as a quartz glass, or keelson, covered with glass, the aircraf t of older models. At that moment, the light vibrates in one direction, overshado wed the sun and the sea, just a diffuse light. This is explaining the latest messages sen t to board aircraft disappeared, shortly before being overthrown by the powerful magneti c forces of attraction, which are falling into the sea. These energies represent onl y fractions of land and energy are absolutely real and true; crumble with the speed of a thun derbolt. Moreover, the fall of the nuclei of iron and nickel, i gneous, must have caused the formation of huge gaps in depths of about 20 to 25 km. In a burs t of \"bubble\" in the sea, then come tremendous swirls, producing its adverse ef fects on navigation. The swirls that bring everything and take to the depths and th e known phenomenon of \"water pants,\" just have a question, especially when you do not exclude the possibility of formation of gas within the vacuum, caused by high tem peratures recorded at the time of collapse and that are under great pressure. In such incidents do not force any works of Atlantis, b ut act solely and exclusively the physical laws of nature, in proportions exceeding any and all imagination. The studies made in recent years in the computing centers in Vienna (Austria) and Iena (East Germany), treated fields of energy, created by possible displacement of the earth crust, which far exceeds the capability of those who, perhaps, may arise in the Triangle of Death. Moreover, there in the area of the Earth, is the key to the explanation of the tremendous cataclysm, suffered by the man, the deluge that destroyed Atlantis and a nearly all its living creatures. In recent years, the Atlantis has always to be disco vered, especially by North American researchers have found that, now as the city of Tarte ssos in the delta formed by the mouth of the Guadalquivir River, now in Santorim, respect ively, will, in waters Greece. In the latter case was discovered the center of civilization minóica, disappeared in 1500 BC during a volcanic eruption that led to the bottom of the Mediterranean. However, the authors of the various the ories, finding the Atlantis, always had to recognize the falsity of his ideas that never came to invalidate, or in its principles, nor in its content, the tradition, more th an twice as ancient. Plato tells the Atlantis Plate I. Plato, Aristocles (427-347 BC) All that we know of Atlantis is contained in the two famous dialogues of Plato, called by the Pythagorean Timeu and Criteria, the young, matern al brother of Plato, they are the direct continuation of the Platonic works in ten v olumes, entitled \"Policy\". Plato (427-347 BC), of noble Athenian family, in his youth wrote tragedies; Socrates made it the philosophy for 8 years and was its master. A fter the death of Socrates, Plato went to Megara, where he sought Euclid, then to Cy rene and Egypt, then to southern Italy and Sicily, where he received the teach ings of Pythagoras. After a period"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" of adventure, and prisoner lived as slaves, Plato returne d to Athens, after 387 BC, founded the Academy there, after a few more trips in Sic ily, he devoted himself entirely to the teaching of philosophy. Timeu, a native of Locri in southern Italy, Pythagoras , researcher and scholar of the nature of the stars, the second part (not mentioned her e) of the dialogue that bears his name, he describes the fundamental thesis of the Pytha gorean cosmogony. In his capacity as follower of Socrates, Timeu is a historic al character and not invented, adhoc, by Plato. Criteria, the young, great-grandson of Drópides, grandson of criteria, the old, - who knew the Egyptian report, sent by Solon - mother and bro ther of Plato, a renowned statesman, conservative, guiding spirit of the \"thirty t yrants\", also known as poet, orator and philosopher, follower of Socrates. He died at the battle of Muníquiacom over 90 years of age (403 BC). To meet the requirements of an ideal state as expressed in works by Socrates, teacher of Plato, Atlantis provides a narrative of the classi c, historic, and consists of a state, once it really exists, and set in his time and in its place. The talks took place about at a party held in Piraeus, in honor of Bend, goddess Thrace, a nd were fought between Socrates, Criteria, the Young, Timeu, and fourth Hermócr ates anonymous partner, presumably the very Plato. During these talks, critical told \"a very strange story, but true\", as qualified by the wise Solon, which, once, had brought to Egypt to Greece. It w as the story of an ancient and glorious country, located in the Hellenic peninsula, whic h the Greeks at the time of Plato know all tradition. Also, an elderly priest of Sa is, a large city in the delta of the Nile, I learned from wonderful things about it. First, t he priest noted that all are young Hellene of mind, because lack of knowledge based on venera ble traditions, as well as any message given by time. \"The cause of this is as fo llows: many people were destroyed and those aniquilações occurred in several ways, are still occurring, the biggest disasters are caused by fire and water, children, other causes mil. As also to your people, once, phaeton, son of Hélio8, having towed th e car of the father, unknowingly guide you, did that burn everything on Earth, when he fell, fulminated by lightning. This is counted as if it were a fable, but th e real crux of the story is the orbital aberration of the stars in the sky, orbiting the Earth and the destruction by fire of all that lives on Earth, which is repeated at long intervals of time. Well that, with such disasters, people living in tops of the mountains and highland regions, drought, suffered more than the living by the sea. Socrates (470-399 BC) Greek philosopher, aware of his vocati on education, taught to their fellow citizens in the streets and squares of At hens. Left no writings. What we know him and his teachings has been transmitted to us by Plato and his disciples Xenofonte. The essence of his theories, that the co rrect attitude is not based on objective institutions such as customs, the state, the religion, but rational thinking, put it in conflict with existing state institutions. He w as accused of atheism and condemned to drink hemlock. Bender, traces of the Moon Goddess, identified with Dian a, the main party, the bendídias was celebrated annually, according to the rite dionisíaco in Piraeus before the panatenéias in the month of targélia. Lm high view of religious significance such virgin goddess, equivalent to Artemis-Diana, the story of Atlan tis, offered in tribute to the deity, acquires greater weight and authenticity."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" Hermócrates, son of Hermon of Syracuse, celebrated as military chief and, according Xenofonte, disciple of Socrates, also historical char acter. Solon (639-559 BC), of noble strain Attica, began life as a commercial browser, won Salamis for the Athenians, in combat against mégaros, then gave a new constitution to Athens, which partly offset the difference between eupá trida the nobility and people, in 571 out of Athens, traveled to Egypt and visited the colleges 1á priests in Heliopolis and Sais; went to Cyprus and recommended to the king Filoci pros the transfer of your city, Aipéia for a more favorable location, the King followed the advice of Solon and called the place of soil, in honor of adviser. In 563, So lon went to Sardis, visited Crois and in 561, returned to Athens, where in 560, Pisistrato was absolute sovereign. In the last years of his life, Solon, surrounded by respect and esteem generates, withdrew from the public life. From his numerous poems, famous at the time, only fragments are preserved. Lost is the story of Plutarch, confirming th e notes for a narrative of Solon of Atlantis, however, remained unfinished. Phaeton, son of Helio, not souve drive the car of the sun and caused a terrible fire on earth, reached by the lightning of Zeus, fell in Eridan, the tears, cried for his sister, turned into amber. Possibly, this is reminiscent of, saved by the people of Western Europe, the fall of the celestial body that caused the c atastrophe of Atlantis. For us the Nile is the Savior in all things, it also saves us from this disaster, the overflow of his bed. Also, when the gods, to cleanse t he Earth, sending a flood, the people of the mountains, the herds of cattle and sheep, a re saved, while the inhabitants of cities are carried by rivers to the sea. In our co untry does not happen or this or that, the water falls from above on the land, us, nature has made things so that everything emerges from the bottom up. For this and for these reas ons, has kept us all that is considered the oldest, but it is true that everywhere, i n which the excess heat or cold does not stop, there is a human generation, sometimes l ess, sometimes larger. But what of beauty, great or remarkable happened with you, us or els ewhere, was recorded here in the temples, and so it was retained. In your land and the other, it was again recently, with deeds and all other things necessary for your state . And after the usual number of years, the flood back to punish you, like a disease and sav es only the uninformed and ignorant among you, for your people to rejuvenate and becom e strong, as was at first, because anything you know here, or what, in ancient tim es, it happened in your land. At least what thou, O Solon, just to talk about the seque nce of your generation, it is little different from a childhood story, first because you only remember a deluge on the earth, but many flood occurred, and then you do not know th at the best and most beautiful human generation lived in your land, from which you descend and all your modern state, thanks to a small tribe that survived the cataclysm. All that I was hidden, because many generations of sobrevevintes passed through this world, leave with nothing written. Well, once was so, O Solon, before the city-state, now inhabited by the Athenians, having suffered the worst destruction by water, it has t he best institutions, both in regard to military defense, as to all its legislation. Moreover, she made the award of the noblest and the most perfect, existing on Earth and wha t we know. \" \"So, you you had the best laws, and further, administrati on of a high level, while you are distinguished among all men for your skills and high skil ls, according to the children or disciples of the gods.

At that time, the sea was still navigable. Before the mouth that you used to call the \"Pillars of Hercules\", was a island, whose extent was greater than Libya and Asia t ogether, and, from there, it was then possible to cross to the other islands and those islands, for the whole continent, in front and around that sea, the which, adjust title takes its name. All that is within the mouth of which we are speaking, it seems to be only wit h a bay with a narrow channel of entry, but that sea, in fact, deserves to be calle d the sea and the land surrounding the of continent. That island, Atlanta, was installed a l arge and wonderful real power, sovereign throughout the island as well as other islands and mainland that, moreover, ruled there were vast areas of land, located inside, nam ely from Libya to Egypt and Europe to Tirrenia. Once, the great power tried to conquer in one huge militar y campaign, both your and our land and your city-state was shown to be sovereign, before the eyes of all peoples, showing their bravery and energy. Well, surpassing everyo ne with his courage and military efficiency, the first, leading all the Helen a and then abandoned by others, alone and supreme in danger, your city-state has managed to beat the enemy and erect monuments of victory, while still managed to ensure tha t those who were defeated have not been. Released without any rancor, all of th e many people, inhabiting the land within the limits of Hercules. However, later, when survivor tremendous earthquakes and terrible floods in the course of one day and one nigh t ill, died in that land all your generation value, and the island of Atlantis disappeared, pl unged to the bottom. Therefore, the sea is no longer navigable in those ar eas and not allow the passage of more ships, unable to move, by masses of mud, of great h eight, arising from the sinking of the island. \" During the talks held over several days, outlined a critic al and lively image of the island of Atlantis, its luxuriant vegetation, without par, its people and its cities superb, especially its capital with the actual castle, on the basis of if at all details in reports received from the Egyptians and transmitted by Solon the criteria, the Old, as follows: \"From coast to the center of the island is an extende d plain, from which they would have been the most beautiful and best of all. By this plain, but toward the center at a distance of about 50 stages (= about of 9 km), had a mountain of strands flat on all sides. That was a mountain man, originally sprouted from soil, to name Euenor in company of his wife, Leucipa, they had one daughter, the n ame Clito. When the girl entered the marriageable age, their parents died. Poseidon fall in love her and she joined. He broke in all its around the mountain, on whos e top the girl lived, then to have it securely fenced, to so, put your back in small ba nds and increasing, sea and land, two of land and three of sea water, with the sam e distance from one to another at all points, thus, the mountain in the center of the is land has become inaccessible to people outside, because, at that time still had not ships or navigation. In turn, Poseidon installed on the island, situated in the center, with a ll the ease that it in its capacity of God, doing well the ground water of two springs, one cold, o ne hot and forth soil enough food and variety. The children he led for five tim es, twins, who created and then to divide the whole island of Atlantis into ten pa rts, gave the firstborn of the oldest pair of twins to address maternal and the surroundin g land, the best and most extensive, and the king appointed the other, which set as arcontes, because each conferred sovereignty on many people and land. Also gave names to all, the oldest and King gave it the name of the whole island and the sea, which is called the Atlantic, as the name o f the firstborn, then king, was Atlas."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" The second born, twin brother after he gave the name of Gadeiro, in the vernacular, and Eumelo in Hellenic language, set it as sovereign lands located in the extreme tip of the island, towards the Pillars of Hercules, to the Cur rent Gadeiro of land, called the region second, probably derived its name from King. The s econd pair of twins, one called Anferes and one of Euaimon; the third gave the na me of Mneseas, who was born first and Autochthonous that was then, with the fourth, gave the name of Elasipo who came first and Mestor, it was then, finally, with th e fifth, gave the name of Azaes the first born and Diapapes, it was then. These and their de scendants, lived there for many generations, as sovereign of the sea and many islands, as has been spoken of vast territories and large people, from within, covering his kingdom is the land that extends to the Egypt and Tirrenia. Atlas was the ancestral strain of a large and noble, and as always the eldest son sent to the kingdom of their older children, it retained its power over many generations. He also held enormous wealth in abundance, superior to those in any other kingdom past, contemporary or future because of what they had there wo uld be needed in both cities, as in the rest of the country. A lot of them came out as a tribute, however, in most cases, the island itself has pledged its support to them. T here were all of the metals to be extracted from the earth, cough or fusible solid, inc luding those types that are known today only by name, but then were not just a name , such as iron ore, found in deposits obtained from various points of the island and th at for many people, then the more appreciated after the gold. There was abundance of ev erything that the forest produces for the craft activity, and for feeding domestic animals and wildlife, there also existed a species of elephants, \"proliferating in large n umbers. So in addition to extensive pasture for all animals that live in swamps in the ponds, the lakes, both in the mountains, as in the plains, there was also support for that kind which, by its nature, is the largest in size and consumes larger amount of food. A lso, the island and has remained perfectly , all that the earth produces aromati c, were roots, herbs, trees, resins, flowers or fruits. produced, also the fresh fruit and nut, which serves the food, and all others for our plates of food, which generally c all for vegetables and fruit that grows like a tree and provides drinks, food and oil for anoi nting. Still gave the fruit of orchard, difficult maintenance, created for our entertai nment and our recreation, plus all the fruit to be served dessert, to whet the appetite s of people saciados already tired to eat. This was in huge quantities that island that, ov er time, has spread divine, beautiful and admirable under the lights of Helium. While t he earth to provide all its inhabitants, built these temples and royal palaces and p orts and shipyards and built throughout the country, do the following: They began by placing circles of bridges on the water, i nvolving the primitive heart, in order to establish a path of access to the royal palac e. However, at the outset, the royal palace built in the place of abode of the goddess Clito an d their ancestors, from the descending downward, with each trying to overcome is his predecessor in the embellishment of the palace, to make it remarkable, by the grandeur and beauty of their works. Opened a channel from the sea, 3 pletros (= about 90m) wide, 100 feet (= about 30m) deep and 30 stages (= approximately 9km) long, this ch annel is extended to the landfill and later opened an entrance to the pass age of vessels, thus, enabling the navigation and the boats have come in place, like an es tuary. And, similarly, the landfill also drilled from the circles of water, toward the bri dge, enough to move a vessel from one to another, these passages were covered for vessel s passing underneath, then, for both the landfill had time enough. However, the largest of the circles of water, which penetrates the ocean waves, had a width of 3 stages (= 540m ) and the site was adjacent"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" to that width, the next two circles of water had a wi dth of 2 stages (= 360 m) and surrounding landfill was that wide. The ring of water surro unding the island was located in the center of the width of a stage (= 180 m), while the island with the royal palace had a diameter of 5 stages (= about 900 m). Like the r ings of water and the bridge, a wall of stone around the central island, a plet ro (= about 30 m) wide, in all its circumference, the wall was trimmed from the towers a nd bridges had gates, by the sea. Moreover, they dig under the rock of the island, sit uated in the middle of the circle of water and under the internal and external areas of t he landfill. The stones were dug, sometimes red, sometimes black, and within yards of exc avation installed double, protected by the rock. Erected buildings of a single color, and color, playing with the different types of stones, mixing them and emphasizing th eir natural beauty. The wall around the circle of extreme water was coated with iro n, to that end, become liquid, equal to the anointing oil and the internal wall was wa shed zinc and the walls around the palace have a coating, made of crude ore and shining l ike fire. As part of the acropolis, the royal palace had the foll owing distribution: the center was the temple, dedicated to Poseidon and Clito, whose interi or the people had no access. This temple was surrounded by crates of gold and erected on site where the original generation of ten children was conceived and given real light. Each year, there were brought to the sacrifices due to the two ancient rituals from all ten regions of the country. Even the temple of Poseidon was a stage (= 180 m) long, 3 pletros (= 30 m) in width and height proportional to those dimensions, the effigy of the god was something barbaric appearance. In all its outside, the t emple was coated with zinc, except in the towers, which was coated with gold. Insid e the temple, the lining of ivory, was decorated in gold, silver and crude ore, all th e more, the walls, columns, the floors were covered with raw ore. There also raised t his with gold, representing the deity, in a car, driving six winged horses and playing with your head on the ceiling. Hundreds of nereidas, mounted on dolphins, around the deity, b ecause at that time people believed it existed in such numbers. In addition, th ere are many others that, donated by citizens. On the outside of the temple, golden images showed any progeny real, women and all those born of the original dozen ki ngs, as well as citizens, residents of the city itself and others, outside, his subjects an d vassals. Nor was the altar in their size and grandeur to the execution of works in its collec tion. The royal palace had furniture and ornaments, consistent with the magnificen ce of the kingdom and the splendor of the temple. The sources, a cold water and another of hot water - w hich gave so much water in abundance, as, by its nature and due to its convenience a nd excellence, and is optimally provided for use - were used as follows: across the built around their houses, made of cotton crops, and irrigated and installed water tanks, som e of these tanks were under the open sky, in other covered area, used for hot baths during the winter. Baths had reserved the royal family, citizens, women and even dr inking fountains for horses and other beasts of burden, with each group with their respec tive premises. The filtered water was captured and taken to the woods of Poseidon, whe re, thanks to the excellence of the soil, there were several species o f trees, of great beauty and height, were taken from there by channels, by the extreme ci rcles of water, near the bridges. That place had so many shrines, dedicated to various deiti es, as gardens and gymnasiums for sports, both reserved for men as for hor ses, all those works and facilities are on the two landfills, forming an islan d. In the center of the largest landfill, there were, among others, a formidable track racing, th e width of a stage (= 180 m), following the circular wall throughout its length. On bot h sides of the track were the"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" homes of the lance, as their number. The men were ch arged with greater confidence the custody of the inner circle, closest to the palace , others, whose loyalty proves exceeded that of all others, remained inside the palace itself, where he lived. The yards were full of vessels, largely trimmed of all necessary equipment. The residence of the king was installed like this: after passing the three cir cles of water, outside, came to a wall, that the sea stood at a distance of 50 stages (= a bout 9 km) of the circle of extreme water external walls that move in a circle and in this same area, involving the mouth of the channel in the sea. This whole area was densely populated, full of homes, while the square of embarkation and disembarkation, and th e large port could barely contain the number of vessels and merchants from all parties that, with their cries, his racket and his constant shuttle, causing intense movemen t, day and night. Thus, the city hall and the old residence was thus once were as described and are now remembered. Now, trying to meet the reporting of physica l conditions, natural that country and its internal distribution. First, all that area was described as climbing, steep, reaching the sea and high altitude. All the plain a round the city, it involved, would have been surrounded by mountains, which extend to th e sea, this flat, oval in shape, covering an area that, in either direction, was 3000 stadia (= about of 540 km) and in transverse direction, rising from the sea, media 2000 stadiums (= approximately 360 km) was opened to the south, but north, was protected agai nst the winds. At the time, the mountains surrounding the plain were much praised, because in quantity, proportion and beauty beyond the currently known and for sh elter, and many densely populated places, rivers, lakes and meadows, pastures offerin g the wild and domestic animals, and as long and thick forests, with the most v aried species of trees, providing raw material for works of all kinds in general and in par ticular. Was the following to build this plane as it was kept for a long time in the re ign of many kings. The original scheme was a quadrilateral elongated, largely cut off by f ences and what remained was completed, following the path of the surrounding ditch. As f or its depth, width and length, although the data seemed unbelievable, there must have been, among other works, a work of huge dimensions, by the hand of man. Wel l, but tell that meets heard about it. The ditch would have pletro (= about 30 m) deep, a stage (= about 180 m) wide, in all its extent, and involved the entire plain, its length would be 10,000 stadia (= about 1800 km). That ditch was raised that the rivers dow n the slopes of the mountains surrounding it and the whole plain and reached the city on both sides, which was sold on the water sea. This giant ditch, straight c hannels, typically 30 m, approximately wide, left to its top, entering the plains and back to the words that led to the sea, the distance between these channels was 100 st adia (= 18 km) . Thus, transporting the wood from the mountains to the city, a s well as all other products of the station, which carried on vehicles after they ha ve completed the system of cross links between channels and the city.

From the beginning, the civil administration and honora ry positions were held as follows: each of the ten kings ruled the kingdom of which it had, he established most of the laws, punished and killed according to his will. Howeve r, sovereignty and community among the ten kings were subject to the will o f Poseidon as the law stipulates and the inscription, written by primitive anc estors on a column of raw ore, which is built on the island, in the sanctuary of Pose idon. Beyond went to every fifth, alternately, every sixth year, to be provided equal opport unity for participation to the odd and even number. At these meetings deliberated about co mmunity issues examined and if someone transgresses the law, for, if so, punish him. When they were held for trial, it gave the kings, each other, guarantee the foll owing prior: as in the sanctuary of Poseidon bulls grazing freely in number ten, the kings, af ter invocation of divinity, rogando to get his bull, began the hunt, so, using only sti cks and strings, refraining from using the iron. The bull that pegavam, was taken to the column and there sacrificed on the entry. In addition to the column were entered laws, there was still recorded an oath, in answer to the harsh curses kings dis obedient. After having offered sacrifice on all members of the bull, as the ritual pr escribed by its laws, filled a pot and put on a drop of clotted blood for each king this while, to clean the column across its back, playing fire in the other remains of the animal sacrificed. Then pegavam chalices of gold, who filled the pot with the liquid to the fire wi th him regarem while passing juravam trial, under the laws listed in the column and to punish those who had infringed any of the commandments, for the period of tim e in present and the future never to transgress them freely, and not to govern, no t subject to another sovereign, is not observed the laws of the father. After the cerem ony, during which each king taking the oath for himself and his children, drank the mixture of pot and had the chalice in the sanctuary of Poseidon, they had a meal and take care of other things needed. When the night descended, involving all in its mantle of darkne ss and the fires of the sacrifices were to die out, the kings present wore costum es of blue, navy, black, of extreme and rare beauty. At night, sitting on the floor , surrounded by the glow of the fires of sacrifice, to which had finished taking the oa th, waiting for the extinction of all fires in the sanctuary, then the kings saw themselves, each other when someone was accused of have infringed the law. By dawn the day, forme d the ruling on a tombstone of gold, which, along with their costumes, it was saved in memory of the trial. Besides these, there were many other laws, governs the duties real, whose main objectives were for the kings never fought amongst themselves, but are pro viding assistance, when in any of the kingdoms, someone tried to destroy real strai n, and example of their ancestors, always taking together all the resolutions r elating to wars and other companies, getting in all moments, the absolute supremacy reserved for noble strain Atlantis. Also, no king would have the power of life and death over any of your relatives, unless more than half of the ten sovereign s agree with their decision. This power of such magnificence and substance, which the n reigned in that land, there was instituted by God for the following reasons, as the y say: for many generations, while the divine nature was still active in his heart , the kings followed the law and demonstrated behavior friendly to their relatives divin e.

So far, this has been the subject of 25,000 books, tr anslated into almost all languages of the civilized world. Clearly, the original t ext of Solon is the most fertile contribution to universal literature. However, among th e many who discuss the Atlantis, there are few who know the two reports ment ioned above, almost no one read those words text containing one of the traditions most surprising of all time. Despite the 25,000 books written to elucidate the enigma of A tlantis, the problem remains unsolved and forever new. Nothing has to decreas e its charm. However, neglect is the part of the problem relating to the Natur al Sciences. The almost universal literature knows no other matter, non-religious, which for so long and attract much interest so deeply marks the literature of different era s. Customary to speak in the Atlantic, without thinking much about the origin of the word. From which its name? In other places of the wor ld jumps the eyes, for example, the Indian and the south, the Indian Ocean, looking at th e map and find the Persian Gulf, near the pole is the Arctic Sea in the Arctic r egion, in Eastern Europe, bathing the Baltic countries are the Baltic and northern Europe , is the North Sea. Everywhere around the globe, where a sea derives its name from a l and, that is beside it. The Atlantic Ocean is the only exception, although there i s the sea, no land from which derives its name. In this respect, the informant of P lato made the following terse and accurate comment: \"... However, later, when survivor tremendous earthquakes and terrible floods in the course of one day and one night i ll, then disappeared across the land Your generation values, the example of how the isla nd of Atlantis disappeared, plunged to the bottom''. Long, the Atlantis is completely destroyed, disappeared, it left not even the smallest trace. She has the charm of a melody that was lost i n the air. She no longer anything tangible, palpable, but a distant echo. Two and a half mi llennia separate us from Athens at the time of Plato. What Solon learned of Atlantis by Drópides, brings us back in time in over nine millennia. However, in contrast t o the reigns of the first mythical emperors and kings of Babylon and China, or the biblical patriarchs, in the case of Atlantis is a chronology right, susceptible of examinat ion and tests. The date is at least as authentic as is the majority of dating historical o r prehistoric. From earliest times, when there was a link between Atlantis and the flood. Although already surpassed the old theory that the flood waters of Atlantis would have taken to the bed of the ocean, which derives its name, as we shall see below, the s ame cataclysm tellurian, causing the flood, also destroyed Atlantis. Since Woolley found the twelve meters under the sand of the desert in Mesopotamia, that layer of alluvial m ud of 2.5 m thick and entirely free of any archaeological find, which is the practical demo nstration of the description given by the Sumerians of flood reports the mockery about the deluge fell in some degrees. The earth kept the testimony of flood, like as the sea kept the Atlantis. One way or another, until today, among the descendants o f the peoples of the regions punished by the flood, the idea remains alive, the memor y of everything that happened, in fact, was a reality. This idea finds its confirmat ion, the true eco-literary in the narrative of Atlantis, by Plato, which is an indicat ion suscinta in nothing exaggerated, although incomplete, of past grandeur. Remains whether the story of Atlantis by Plato, it is poetry or reality. Absent any evidence of the land, which the Atlantic Ocean derived its name, have been a submerged island or a continent that, subsequently, changed its name. In this regard,"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" there are diametrically opposed views, on one hand there is the belief, based on sensitivity, on the other hand, the unconditional reje ction, the skepticism. What are the tangible facts? The belief that Atlantis existed, really, is based on the presence of an authentic text, supported by documents, which include saying anything that wa s contrary to the laws of logic, or impossible to be proved by the Natural Scie nces. This belief is confronted with the argument, which Pla to had invented the story of Atlantis was supposed to produce an interesting story, an a ttractive plot for their ideas of political conservative in order to make them more pl easant to read and the impact stronger. Well - so be argued - that there is a fine th ing narrative frankly unbelievable and difficult coadunável with certain concepts of Natural Sciences. Ultimately, this divergence of views on the Atlantis, crystallized in the question, legend or fact, that over millennia still in debate, is reduc ed to the following question, is or is not real reporting done by Plato? Cited the two dialogues, \"Timeu\" and \"critical\", is true o f all that was broadcast on the Atlantis. Nobody doubts that, indeed, are the work of Pla to. There is good reason to date them in the final version, the last years of th e life of Plato, presumably, from 348 BC This assumption was right or wrong, you can not deny the existence of a tradition recognized to be Re, historically, until 348 BC, that is, more or less 2400 years back in time. However, this tradition leads be only the prologue to history. The narrative itself goes back to time of the most primitive and remote, the much earlier times and those of the Sumerians Acad, surpassing the pre-dynastic Egypt unti l the beginning of the fifth geologic period, the Holocene, which began with th e last stage of glaciation and runs to this day. Plato wrote his narrative not the first person singula r, the narration is done through the mouth of the old criteria, which in turn refers to ano ther character, more aged and venerable, the Solon, the wise legislator of Athens. It is said that Solon had left his friend Drópides, great grandfather of criteria, annotatio ns to serve as the basis for a poem of great size. If, at any time, these documents ha ve existed, today are missing. Neither Solon was the author of this narrative that, according to him, learned from an elder, clerk of the church and of salts which, in turn, referred the documentary material and older, the texts in hieroglyphs saíticos. Those tex ts would have given the report of the glory of the sunset and the island of Atlantis, and have lived for more than nine millennia ago. The authenticity of the original texts is demonstrated by another statement valid. The Proclear philosopher who lived between 485 and 412 BC, wr ote a detailed commentary to the dialogue \"Timeu\" of Plato. That comme nt, reported that a Hellene Proclear of Crantor name, came to Sais, where the t emple of Neita would have seen the whole column covered with hieroglyphics, recording th e history of Atlantis. These hieroglyphs it would have been deciphered by experts and, as stated, he, Crantor then heard, was in perfect agreement with the content of th e story of Atlantis by Plato, to whose words had full knowledge. Also, when Prof. Dr. Otto, Egyptology, Hamburg, says tha t absent an Egyptian story known by us, the story of Atlantis, and that neither t he Egyptian literature mentions the name Atlantis, this is not worth as convincing argumen t, as this story could well appear to have one of many lost texts, like the hieroglyphics on the column in the temple of salts which, according to the testimony of Proclear, Crantor saw long after it had been seen by Solon.

If evidence were found E gyptian, they show, above all suspicion, the authenticity of the tradition of Atl antis, as stated by Plato himself. Also, after counting in critical dialogue \"Timeu\" its ver y funny story, but true, the struggle of the peoples inhabiting both sides of the Pilla rs of Hercules, he addressed the following question to simposiarca Socrates: \"Therefore, O Socrates, whether the subject remains in it, in your mind, or whether, beyond this, we must still look for another.\" And Socrates replied: \"O criteria, which would prefer to adopt the theme of th is place, which seems to be the best indicator, both in view of sacrifice, today offe red to the goddess of the family, as the great advantage of not represent an idealized myth, b ut a history true! \" Who insist on saying that it is a myth, Plato alleges a deliberate lie. No, for all we know, Plato played its role of mediator so objectively. This impression becomes even clearer with the examination of the text, to answer the question, whether Plato, even if so wished, could have invented everything we sent, the t itle of a report of Solon. A highly significant portion of the text, we already kno w, so clearly answered this question decisively. Hey you, repeated below, due to their importance: \"... In view of the mouth that you used to call the Pil lars of Hercules, there was an island, whose extent was greater than Libya and Asia t ogether, and from there, it was then possible to cross to the other islands, and those islands, for the whole continent, in front of that sea and surrounding it, which adjust title t akes its name. \" This section gives a vivid and clear image of the area west of the Atlantic Ocean, as it was before the sunset of the island of Atlantis. The island itself is located well to the east, toward the southern Europe and the west are the is lands and, behind these islands, is the continent, around the whole wide ocean. Although apocryphal, this description gives, in a few lines, image mapping, authentic and real, the regions west of the Atlantic, namely the peripheral areas of North Am erica, with its numerous islands, the Bermuda, Bahamas and the Antilles, and, behind the c urve of dense barrier islands, is the huge continent, with its wide surface. \u0000 Figure 2: The problem. Plato says: \"Faced with the mouth that you used to call the Pillars of Hercules, there was an island, whose exten t was greater than that of Asia and Libya combined, and from there, it was then possible t o cross to the other islands and"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" in those islands, for the whole continent, located fr ont and sea surrounding it, which a fair title, takes its name. All that is within the m outh of which we are speaking, it is only a bay, with a narrow channel of entry, but the fact that sea should be called the sea and the land surrounding the of continent. \" The diagra m shows the approximate location map of the island of Atlantis, according to Pl aton. The title of what Plato would have invented this \"the background color\" for their political ideas? What would have imagined islands, even mo re distant than the legendary island itself, and behind those islands and a co ntinent? However, this is not everything. The most unique, most exciting of this detail is in fact the narrative does not provide the topography of a sea-of -tales of fairies, but a description absolutely certain, realistic. For a descri ption of an imaginary place, the author could have chosen from a number of versions, wit hout thinking. However, why Plato adopted that version just that in a few lines, se tting the actual conditions? Plato had their knowledge of criteria, the Younger, who in turn receive them from his grandfather, criteria, the Old, which, through Drópides ha d opportunity to know the notes made by Solon, during their journey through Egypt. And Solon reported what he heard in Egypt of notable and not surprising and could have b een invented for him. There is another argument of weight, to be named to the authenticity of this part of the Platonic tradition. Mention are two data that Plato c ould hardly have found by chance, but neither could hit the description of the Atlantic Oc ean, west of the island of Atlantis. If the timing Platonic, with about nine millennia bef ore the trip to Egypt in Solon, is correct, the Atlantis should have had its golden age at t he end of the Quaternary period, ie when large bodies of water were frozen and co vered large areas continental and the sea level was 100 to 200 m below the present. Plato certainly could not have come to know this phenomenon \"EUSTAT\" and therefore al l the more remarkable is the fact that the narrative refer to today's Attica, such as representing only one-over land that, previously, there are extended with its mounta ins, hills and high plains fertile. When looking at Figure 3, there is the explanation and proo f that \"it was also authentic and worthy of credit what was said about our country,\" as the nature of critical reporting. This diagram shows the coastal strip, as is c urrently and how it was in the Quaternary period, to accompany it, we can state that t oday's Attica \"in its entirety, it appears that as a spur from the continent, extends sea . At that time and especially in the current Athens, Attica was much wider, linked by bri dges of land to the Peloponnese and Evia; EUSTAT due to the lowering of sea level, recorded at the time, the mountains were almost 100 m higher now, so that the hill of the Acropolis, now 156 m above sea level, then had some 250 m tall and impressi ve as, indeed, much higher. The treatment plans, currently bottom, once, w ere the fertile plains, platonic mentioned in the report, although the author could not know this detail, nor guess it by chance. This was verified the authenticity of the sources also for that part of the narrative Platonic regard to regions that at the end of plistoceno , were inhabited by proto- Athenians, also so called by mistake, and which later became known as Attica. \u0000 Figure 3.

He describes a civilization bucolic, provincial, and the gua rds' houses were made of wood and clay, the walls around you were palisades or stone ma mmoth document. This corresponds exactly to the idea of contemporary man of Aurignac as being transmitted by the latest research. Already in those days remotís simos houses were built of wood, long, surprisingly large, as Gert von Natzmer reports in his book \"Die Kulturen der VORZEIT\" - The Pre-Historic Civilizations (Safari, 1955): \"Poles of wood decaying leaves on the ground its moldy res idues, almost indestructible ...

Obviously, such \"long houses\" were a large family or a clan, compos ed of several smaller families, who living under one roof. The structure of these houses suggests that its builders would have used axes of stone, afiadíssimos, since only thus could have been working the wood properly. However, yet there were no such tool s among the peoples of hunters prehistory.

They make the surprising findings demon strate that neither was so primitive the life of prehistoric man, as used imagin e it until recently. \" The description given on the basis of findings over all doubt, confer, and surprising way, with the story of Plato on the habits and life of so-called proto-Athenians. The man-hunter of civilization Aurignac had a social or der structured and clearly defined. It also said the proto-ancient Athenians were integrated into the primary system of four castes, namely priests, warriors, craf tsmen and peasants. The warriors and the priests lived together, on the hill of the city , in houses of wood, simple and spacious, with luxury next to the temples, also simple, t he gods of their worship. Probably, in the days of the Roman conquest, the unions , queruscos and naarvala us still inhabiting such places, moreover, Herodotus gave si milar reports of appointments, other primitive people. It is the sedentary people who build houses long, in this condition, the practice horticulture and agriculture, the primitive division of lab or has changed the class of peasants. Those not living on top of the hill, but clos e to the fields that grow crops, or on the plains, as Plato describes the proto-Athenians. The construction of large sections of wood requires craf tsmanship. The peasant and the artisan, which complement each other, are insepar able from one another. This gives another detail reported by Plato on their proto-Athenia ns, saying that the peasants and craftsmen lived together, the \"Lower City\", probably i nhabited the same house long, as were reconstructed in Southwestern Europe, with based on the findings dating plistoceno. There is another detail to attention. Houses long as t he seat of a large family, closed in itself, constitute evidence of a true matriarchal way of life, which is part of the worship of the goddess-mother. Know is archaic worship of such i mages, dating from the end of the Stone Age, such as the Venus of Brassempuy and Ven us of Willendorf, to mention only these two. And Plato attests that those proto-Athenians worship a god- mother, as a \"temple of effigy, bearing arms.\" Mor-in the temple, the images of that proto-Athenian and a proto-Hefesto stood side by side. Th is could discern the preliminary phase of a poster ginecocracia among the nat ives of the Amazon. But this evidence also gives the message Platonic, rather stran ge that, in proto-Athens, \"both women, as men participated in military activities.\" Th e same happened with the people of farmers and hunters Aurignac of contemporary civiliza tion. It is there that the community places on top of the hill was inhabited not o nly by armed men, but also by women so weapons, it is therefore true warrior famili es, integrated in your clan, like how can presumed to be the inhabitants of the houses lo ng, Aurignac type. Thus, adding up pebble after pebble and avoid any prejudice, comes to a few intelligible prehistoric life, which fits perfectly with the Plato nic story, describing the proto- Athenians, as the contemporary hunters \"appointments\" o f Aurignac were representatives of a civilization modest, rural, but wi th high ethical level, describing it, by law, and civilized. Gert von Natzmer them talk to r ight: \"Strictly speaking, the description\" man of the Stone Age \"almost lacks substance. It does not say at all, he was a\" primitive man. \"Up to t wo millennia before the Christian era, the peoples of North and Central Europe still lived in the Stone Age. In essence, this also applies to the civilized nations of Central and South America, during the Spanish conquest. The raw material used by a people in its past, is not alone , valid criterion to assess the extent of its cultural developm ent ... \" However, as Plato reports, that proto-civilization At tica prehistoric disappeared during"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" a single night of terrible rain, earthquakes and many bodi es of water, which led it and always have to dive in the past.

Those bodies of water, falls on the proto-Attica, would have been that the fl ood, as are the legends of many peoples, destroyed vast stretches of land? This has rais ed a question to be examined later. Done here in the examination section of the text re ferring to the proto-Athenians.

Timely return to the subject. However, that will effectively Solon was in Egypt? Thanks to the biography of Solon, written by Plutarch, have some data on their travels. He traveled for ten years, from 571 to 561 BC First, he we nt to Egypt to Heliopolis and Sais; from there brought the story of the Atlan-ta ken. Then visit the King Filocipro, Cyprus, the visit is documented by the fact th at the Cypriot city of SAAP had its name changed to Solo, in honor of the visitor. From there followed for Crois, in Sardis, in Lydia, in 561 and returned to Athens. Already the following year lost his position in public life and was replaced by Pisístrato; i nvoluntary leisure in the last two years of his life, seems to have made notes of his j ourney, perhaps to serve as the basis for a literary work of greater size. He died with 80 year s of age, in 559 BC Thus, the chronic critical that refers to date of 560 BC With thi s begins the Hellenic tradition of Atlantis, recognized by history, it is better documente d than are many other facts , accepted and recognized by the official historiography. Life Beyond the Ocean In 1836 were discovered huge indecipherable characters in the Gávea Rock in Rio de Janeiro. The top of this impressive mountain as a huge b earded man's head, a helmet, as reported A.

Also in other places, in underground vaults of Ni teroi, Campos and Tijuca, such traces were found.

Moreover, no one doubted the ability to circumnavigate the earth disk, along its back. This event was in perfect agreement with the design of the contemporary world, as existing at the time of Herodotus and illustrated by Fig.4.

They al l believed in that realm of the dead in the west, as believed, piamente in the palace of Po seidon, the crystalline depths of the sea. However, what Solon brought from Egypt and became the co re of the Platonic story of Atlantis, frankly and openly contradicts the traditio nal concept. The description of the western Atlantic is not mythical in nature, but e xpressly realistic. A modern map would not give a more concise and accurate description. Fur thermore, no Hellenic thinker could never have imagined that the other side of the ocean there is a continent with humans, live. The picture outlined above in early di alogue is a non-Hellenic reportedly because, besides contradicting the concepts of geographical classical antiquity, yet is opposed to the idea cosmo-logic, the bas ic time, which is of greater importance. The cosmology of the mythical Hellene has its origin in models Sumerians, Babylonians.

The tower is supported by the zodiac, divided into twelve compartments, w ith the mountains of the birth and the Sunset.

Never a Hellene could have suspected the existence of land in those parts of the world. However, also the Phoenicians and the Babylonians had considered sacrilege to mere speculation in respect of land and human beings, live in the pest than the earth disk. At the end of antiquity, especially in the city of Alex andria and other major capital cities, were imposed schools learned that after Encycl opedia Encyclopedia filled with all the knowledge available at the time. Hierarchies w ere scientific, with sacrosanct dogmas, quite equal to those of our present. One of these do gmas was the eternal existence of the disc land in the middle of the ocean, home of the living; outside its scope was nothing, beyond the realm of the dead. In view of these concepts, we can assess how it must have been difficult for Solon and Pl ato register that passage of dialogue, perhaps because of this they both took so long to resolve to leave it in writing. In advance was to be expected that would be reje cted by contemporaries. Only a few had the courage to accept it, among these were the Teopompo and historiographer Herodotus, the geógrafoPosseidônioe the na turalist Pliny, the courageous attitude of these men brings to them both as e vidence of the authenticity of the Platonic texts. Since the discovery that distant continent, west of the barrier island, formed in the western Atlantic, described by Plato, it is known how they were to the right. \u0000 "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" Fig.5.

In commenting on Proclear dialogue \"Timeu\" and Crantor te stifying about the narrative of Solon, the tradition of Atlantis suffers sudden solution of continuity.

Perhaps the ons et sudden, unexpected, those messengers of a world away, Pliny and Mela was c onverted into fans of Plato. It is all that is about and it seems very little for a period of 900 years. The Middle Ages is one full vacuum to the tradition of Atlantis. This i n no way surprising, considering that there are two reasons of weight, for this lack o f interest (Board 2). First, the great Aristotle condemned, so irrevocable, the Platonic Atlantis, this was a decision of great importance, because the monks, copiers of classical texts, Aristotle considered as absolute authority, the greatest sage of an tiquity. Furthermore, missing data to adequately examine and assess the basis of littl e expressive Aristotelian defense and, therefore, the trial of Aristotle came to be pas sed on, without major repairs, and Plato has created reputation for doctrinaire. The second and more important reason to reject the Middl e Ages the story of Atlantis was the narration itself, which, in addition to counte r the geographical design of the contemporary world, and little different from the curren t in antiquity, which gave no room for any idea of a country the west, sinned by an anathema even more serious. The dialogue of critical mentions a date, even vague, but just the mere mention. The great war between the men inside and outside the Pillars of Hercules would have hatched some nine millennia before the visit of Solo n salts, ie, according to today's chronology, around 9600 BC As we know, that war ended with th e terrible earthquake that also destroyed the island of Atlantis. But also the Middle Ages had its own calendar, which began with the absolute top of the world, the Day of Creation. Was taken from the Bi ble and therefore had all the weight of a divine revelation. At the time, was all t hat the Bible was taken strictly literal. The Jewish people had their years from the dat e of creation of the world. According to the chronology supplied by the Genesis, the w orld was created in 5508 BC No doubt it was allowed that time, regarded as revelat ion, and therefore was sacrosanct. Arose, then the fact of a disappointing report immemoria l, has called into doubt by the wise Aristotle, to mention a date for more than four millennia before the creation of the world. In this report, the center of the Atlantic the re was a highly civilized island in a season in which the Earth was not only \"empty and dese rted, but had not yet been established. In view of frank contradiction with canon s of Scripture, there was only one possible reaction: condemn those texts. Today, it is easy to discuss the matter. No longer teac hes more than in all its parts, the Bible should be taken literal and currently comprises the Hebrew date of creation of the world in a different well. The Search of Atlantis, in recent times The man who forced the frame of the table representin g the Earth as it was conceived in Antiquity and Middle Ages, was the Genoese Christopher Columbus, the service of Spain, which called for Cristóbal Colón To many of hi s contemporaries he was a fool, to defend fanaticism with the idea, mock the experts, th at the more you penetrate west direction, finally \"come from behind\", it would be possi ble to reach the extreme periphery of East Asia, China and Japan and, with that r ound, come to Islands Moluccas, the islands of spices so appreciated. Undoubtedly, this project was interesting for the Spanish because the sea was there in the field of competitors, the Portuguese, because the land through several Arab countries , whose passage was"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" subject to heavy taxes, as a toll. However, neither the idea in Portugal convinced Christopher Columbus was taken seriously, despite the fact that closing a real and genuine threat to the monopoly of its trade with the Ea st, if and when they come to be accepted by others. Thus, no one gave credit to the words of the Genoese, who had long had to look who fund their desired business arriscadíss ima through the globe. It is the years. One man supported Christopher Columbus and encour aged not to lose their courage during that long period of waiting, was the Florenti ne Toscanelli, whose advice and assistance of the Genoese very high value due thank, including the collection of data available at the time . It is know n that the efforts of the genial spirit, irriquieto, obsessed with the idea of crossing the seas, were inspired, among others, in the mythical geography of antiquity and travel reports, supe rfantasiosos of Cosmas Indicopleutes. The roadmap, \"from Lisbon and pursuing ever-we st direction, the Antilles, to Cipangu (Japan)\" was one of Toscanelli let ters, addressed to Colombo, however, the map which accompanied that letter was los t. Anyway, Christopher Columbus, who never falter in its efforts, managed to b e received by Isabel de Cas- screen queen and ended up signing with him the contract of G ranada, which the crown equipped three caravels for the intrepid explorer in the se ason with 46 years of age. On August 3, 1492, Christopher Columbus set sail from Paios. Cert ainly, none of those present at the outset of the small expedition could have imagined the consequences of this tremendous adventure, even ignored by the Colombo. W hen, after months of uncertainty, waiting and almost despair, on 12 October of that year, Columbus anchored off the coast of Guanahani, in Watling Island, the Bahamas group, nor did he have rediscovered the idea that that ancient New World, 1800 years ago, was located and described in the narrative of the Platonic Atlanti s, accused by scholars of antiquity, who have the text. In 1496, Christopher Columbus discovered the American contin ent at the mouth of the Rio Orinoco, when they had the certainty of having co ntributed in Cipangu (Japan), or Catai (China), it confused with flocks of flamingos maj estic processions of Buddhist monks. Neither at the time of his death Colombo idea w as that, unlike the east coast of Asia, he reached the eastern outskirts of a new contin ent, the New World. Certainly, there are few times that a mistake was genial season, marked by the same Christopher Columbus. However, since then, the door was open to the west an d up discoveries followed, one after another. In 1502, the Genoese admiral designed the giant shadow over C entral America, began to spread the exciting tales of Eldorado, the king covered with gold, which rallied the adventurers in search of gold. In 1521, Fernando Cortes is de voted conqueror of the powerful kingdom of the Aztecs, when taken Tenochtitlán. In 1553, Francisco Pizarro conquered Peru, country of the Incas. Then, suddenly, the l and of the remote west end revealed visual field of the West and became tangible, pa lpable. In 1569, Mercator published his map the world, which, in comparison with th e globe of Martin Behaim of 1490, and shows the amazing progress made by the Geography in only eight decades. At the same time, the search of Atlantis woke from i ts sleep of more than a millennium. Already in 1553, Spain's Francisco López de Gomara, the fir st to write a history of the West Indies, newly discovered, referred to the Platonic foretaste, as the topography of the west Atlantic, which, surprising way, had his confi rmation in fact , thereby justifying and brilliantly, the Platonic narrative, th en defamed like mad and heretical. Gomara was of the opinion that the new continent, Am erica, or was the island of Atlantis itself, or that continent end, behind the we st Atlantic, announced by Plato."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" This thesis found supporters among remarkable men, but ofte n disagree on its exact location. In his work \"NEW ATLANTIS\", Francis Bacon of Verulam designated Brazil as the continent of Atlantis mentioned in the narrative; Ja nus Joannes Bircherod adopted this version. The strange book entitled \"Mundus subterraneus\", a uthored the Jesuit priest Athanasius Kircher, published in 1665, deserves special menti on. The author viewed the Azores Islands in the tops of submerged mountains of Atlantis and produced an amazingly accurate map of the island of Atlantis, pear-s haped, with the shaft pointing to the southwest. Remains how Kircher, without having the results of modern oceanic measurements of the profile, would have reached this res ult, however, should respect their intuitive understanding of the Platonic text which , in addition to your fantasy, was the only element to guide you in studies (Fig. 3). While Kircher, thanks to them the original text, achi eving remarkable results and durables, other researchers, for missing the one point, lost in the maze of speculation. It started, then a tragicomic chapter of the recent re search of Atlantida. Olaus Rudbeck thought to have rediscovered Atlantis Sweden; Bartoli, I taly, Georg Caspar Kirchmaier viewed it in South Africa, while Silvain Bailly imagin ed in the cold of pest Spitzbergen in the Arctic. For Delisle de Sales, the Atlantis wa s in Caucasian-Armenian plateau; Baer chose to Asia Minor; Balch, the island of Crete . Godron, Elgee and later the Count Byron de Prorok, said that would be located in the o asis of Hoggar, while Leo Frobenius opted Iorubalândia. The renowned archaeologist A dolf Schulten identified Spain with the Atlantic and Indian Tarshish as the rea l Poseidonia, Richard Hennig, Netolitzky and others adopted this argument. However, othe r researchers sought by Atlantis in the Atlas mountains in North Africa. Her rmann believed to have found the right place in Sirte and others were searching the isla nd of Ceylon. Since then, everywhere, in Helgoland, the fantasy of men sought by Atlantis, but the place was looking less that stated by Plato. Moreover, when some people joined the original text: Ca det, Bori of St. Vincent, Tourenfort, Latreille, the famous Buffon, Lamettrie, Z anne and Germain and Heinrich Schliemann, the great discoverer of Trojan-amateur's o pinion Schliemann, a renowned researcher and often successful, has special weight, exc eeding that of a hundred people ultracépticas, or a thousand fantastic, given the speculat ion surface. For over 60 years, the case Schliemann \"has to make he adlines. On 20 October 1912, his grandson, Dr. Paul Schliemann, published in the \"NEW YORK AMERICAN\" a sensational article on a legacy that would have been l eft by his famous grandfather. That legacy would have been part of a bronze bowl, found by the grandfather with the fabulous \"Treasure of Priam\" and that, so amazing, it wo uld have a bearing Phoenician inscription, saying: \"of Cronos, king of Atlantis.\" But Schliemann had found Grandfather in archaic dual layer I-II, in Troy, head o f owl vessels, equal to that in 1883 he had seen in a collection of precious of Tiahuanaco, then displayed in the Louvre in Paris. And according to Schliemann Neto, thos e vessels containing platelets square of silver metal. Apparently, these elements form ed the basis for the thesis of Dr. Paul Schliemann, because by then disappeared in Russia, an d the development of which still use two old Egyptian papyrus, supposedly discovered by his grandfather in St. Petersburg, attesting Egypt as a colony of Atlantis. Nor , Schliemann Neto forgot the door of the lions, in Mycenae, which was found the ins cription saying that the first temple was built by the Salt Misor, ancestor of all E gyptians, who was the grandson of a priest Atlantic, the which, in company of the beauti ful daughter of King Cronos, fled the land that King and went to the margins of the proto- Nile (Fig. 4)."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" In contrast to the details of the Platonic tradition, susceptible to examination and verification, everything is as legendary as is the mes sage of Herodotus, speaking in Atlanta, closed in the mountains of Atlas, which slee p a sleep without dreams, or the legend of the god that Crono - such as the Emperor-Barba Roxa Kyffhäuser of the mountain - was sleeping in the cozy interior of a cave on the island of Atlantis. Moreover, the French researchers were devoting special efforts to the elucidation of Atlantis. Among them should highlight the scholarly pries t Moreux, he concentrated his studies in the field of Natural Sciences, hitherto neglected, with its \"four arguments\" coordinated appreciable and convincing reasons, but can not be considered as evidence of Platonic reality of the island. Of equal value are the studies by Lewis Spence, on the basis of findings of lava, it is locate d no more than 13,000 years back the date of the cataclysm that killed the Atlantis. Th is is according to timing summary given by Plato, but Spence would have preferred to back, al so the timing, especially in time, probably to support his theory of migration waves, starting from Atlantis, and why Europe was colonized. It is worth mentioning again, the presentation summary of the subject, made by A. Braghin, in his book \"THE SHADO W OF ATLANTIS - The Shadow of Atlantis - in theory launched by previous rese archers, as the Count of Carli and that the Atlantis would have been destroyed with the fall of a comet or meteor that the same time caused the flood. Elsewhere it to matter , with more details. In this context, it should speak of the theories raised in the result of investigations made regarding the inexplicable series of disasters to ve ssels and aircraft, said occurred in the Bermuda Triangle. Charles Berlitz's book \"The OF BERMUDA TRIANGLE\", quoted in the Introduction, speaks of remarkable findings, ma de plain in the Bahamas in that area, so mysterious, the disaster continues, w hich until now was not found an explanation. Berlitz writes about these findings: \"Sinc e 1968 until now and especially in the vicinity of Bimini were underwater installatio ns, such as impressing works of buildings, made of huge massive monoliths, placed one over the other and could be considered as roads, terraces, port works or walls colla psed. In one way or another, they remember the stone buildings in the pre-Inca in Pe ru, Stonehenge and the sanctuaries in the walls ciclópieas Greece minóica. T he age of the rocks is uncertain, although the tests with carbon 14 datassem of approximatel y 12,000 BC fossil roots of the mangrove cover. The most famous of those findings i s the \"Bimini road\", or \"wall of Bimini,\" discovered in 1968 by Dr. H. Manson Valentine in cooperation with the diver Jacques Mayol, Harold and Robert Angove Clim. From beginning to be observed from the surface ocean, the sea with exceptionally sm ooth and transparent, Dr. Valentine was impressed with that finding, he described a s an extensive paving of stones flat, rectangular and multangular of various size a nd thickness, of course finished and embedded in each other to form a whole, whi ch certainly was artistic. In another part of that book, Berlitz, writes: \"Flights of recognition, made since 1968, confirmed the exi stence of other notable works and, of course, by the hand of man, both in the s and banks of the Bahamas, as on the seabed in the vicinity of Cuba, Haiti and Santo Domingo. It is reported that some buildings, then along the sea, have the appearance o f pyramids or huge buildings, with domes. One of them, in the region of Bimini, mea sures 55 x 43 I well could be the basis of a pyramid; other similar is the largest pyrami ds, the temples and terraces. In Cuban waters, a whole complex of \"ruins\" submarine, now located, awaiting the operation. \" Berlitz repeats the previous hypothesis and frequently rai sed, that the structures underwater plateau in the Bahamas indicate the presence o f Atlantis. Apparently, this"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" theory contradicts the Platonic narrative, however, this contradiction is only apparent, since the look more in depth the Platonic text, can no t fail to note that he describes the island as being of greater extent than that of Libya a nd Asia (Minor) together and it could target board with the other islands, and those loca ted opposite to the continent. The liberal interpretation of the platonic reporting al lows the conclusion that Atlantis was the set of a large island and many smaller islands in the west of the \"Pillars of Hercules\", so the Straits of Gibraltar, extending up to the east coast of America . According to Plato, all those islands perished \"during a si ngle day and one night unchancy ill.\" It is not overvalue of indiscriminate way, the recent past, to assign greater importance to the results obtained by search of Atlantis in the past two centuries, considering them superior to those obtained in the last two millennia. Moreover, it was only in the nineteenth century that the narrative of Plato risen to a new life. Similar fate was reserved for another researcher mer itorious, Ignatius Donelly, the author of famous work \"ATLANTIS, THE WORLD ANTEDILUVIA L\" - Atlantis, the antediluvian world. In order that the value of their work is now properly assessed, it remember how little material susceptible of exact tests, the researchers had at their disposal. In view of this, the more command respect his attempts to find new arguments in the context of Natural Sciences. He develo ped the idea, perfectly acceptable, a plateau, meanwhile immersed, linking Europe, Africa and the New World and allowing the passage of animal and plant species betwe en these three continents. Donelly expôs como tal planalto poderia ter impedido a ent rada de correntes marítimas tropicais no Atlântico Norte; especulou que não existia a Corrente do Golfo enquanto existiu a Atlântida. Moreover, this idea is being advoca ted recently, although the various titles, by Prof.. Enqvist, Göteborg, and by Dr. Rene Malaise, Stockholm, both of Sweden. The latter is the author of a book interest ing and very original, published in 1950 under the title \"ATLANTIS, en geologisk verklighet\" - Atl antis, a geological reality. Indeed, elsewhere we have to address the issue of \"the Gulf and glaciation in the North West Europe.\" Is of particular importance to the work of Prol. Hans P ettersson \"ATLANTIS und Atlantik. - The Atlantis and the Atlantic. In it the author, a renowned oceanographer, leader of two expeditions and owner of vast experience, enough to draw the following conclusion: \"The question whether, in fact, existed in the Atlanti c island of any great territorial extension, recently disappeared, seems to be totally ne gative response, nor appear out of the question the idea that, in times as remote as t en to twenty millennia before our was of major disasters, causing changes in the level la nd, had been on top, or near the dorsal central Atlantic, so at the time when our cont inent was populated by man of the beginning of the Stone Age ... \" So here is the trial of goal Pettersson, given the qual ity of Oceanography. But then, Pettersson, the scientist, is making a subjective tria l, stating his belief in what they believe their colleagues, archaeologists and philosophers : \"Certainly, the narrative of magnificence and riches of Atlantis, with its sovereign and warriors, their trade and their campaigns of conquest, th e temple of Poseidon, with the roof of ivory and gold, protected by the ring of canals a nd circular walls, all what is legend, the greatest poetic work of the thinkers of antiqui ty, Plato. \" Well - here Pettersson is wrong! Examine in depth the pros and cons of the old Aristotelian statement, saying only that Plato would h ave invented the Atlantis, and that examination, we find that Plato could not have in vented everything that counted."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" Moreover, remains far more comfortable repeating an o ld argument and even surpassed, that of recognizing the counter-revolutionary a rgument. Geology Mitica? Until today, in one way or another, nearly all geologi sts continue to reject the theory of Atlantis. This rejection is not so much as the idea o f any time and anywhere in the Atlantic would have existed absent land today. Names such as Gondwana and Lemur played its role in scientific debates, but never and now here existed in an ocean of Gondwana or Lemur, while we have before us in the Atla ntic Ocean, to which it gives its Atlantis and so apparent ill will. The reason for this is in fact the mythical island had disappeared so suddenly. And it is precisely this sudden disappear ance that contradicts the standards of a century here, the geology fleugmática, gradually, the teachings of Lyell, on the lonely end of tiny forces today, influen cing changes in the earth's surface. Perhaps the objections were minor against a continent -bridge, Atlantic, argument based on arguments which, over the millennia, have slowly s unk into the sea, to disappear entirely. However, the idea of a great island has disappe ared \"during a single day and one night unchancy ill\" is contrary to the doctrine of Lyell as to be rejected unanimente - and with it the whole theory of Atlantis. The count er-arguments say the following: If the island of Atlantis there was some evidence that t here should have been found, but were not. Moreover, the island could not have disappeared just like that. Islands of large territory not usually do this. Never was such geolo gical changes size. Volcanic eruptions, historically proven, such as Monte Pelée and Cracatoa, local effects and visual result, clearly visible. Lowering the soil, lar ge scale, as recorded on the coast of Holland, do not happen in high seas. Although islets, atol ls and coral banks, may arise and disappear as suddenly as occurred in some unstable regions , for example under the Pacific, a large island, covering an area of at least 200,000 km2, is solid and heavy enough to suffer such sudden disappearance. Recognition of the Platonic texts, including the passage announcing the sinking of Atlantis cat astrofal, therefore represents a repetition of the lessons irresponsible c atastrophe, released by Cuvier and his school, whose doctrines, with the discovery of Ly ell, have been given as interest - only history. Currently, the predominant idea is more or less the fol lowing: although the doctrine of Sir Charles Lyell prevail on normal geological occurren ces, do not exclude the possibility of rare disasters, for exception confirmin g the rule. In turn, the theory of Atlantis requires only a convulsion of the earth, and t hen the possibility to have ceased to be so vehemently denied for the same as it was a f ew decades ago. Furthermore, this possibility is consistent with the theory of convect ion, the theory of tectonic plates, and in particular the doctrine of accommodation Continental , established by Alfred Wegener. This revolutionary theory was raised almost s even decades ago and with it the theory of Atlantis came into conflict. Therefor e, it must explain the theory of Wegener and geophysical databases, which are: The earth we live in is not covered by a single plasti c layer, formed of fragments, but a mantle in various strata. This was already aware of E duard Suess, who introduced the technical terms, since in normal use of \"Sima\", to t he substrate silicon and rich in magnesium, and \"SIAL\" in the continental strata, higher -rich silicon and aluminum, floating in the substrate of Simon, the more dense and viscous-plastic in which they move slowly, as the glaciers into the sea. The remov al of secular tectonic plates of America, Europe and Greenland, advocated by Alfred Wegener, has had his"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" confirmation by the results obtained with the modern t echnique of measurement. This removal caused the gradual enlargement of the Atlantic; o therwise, the Atlantic Ocean should have smaller width. Wegener said that in the earl y Tertiary period, the current Old and New Worlds were not separated by a large pit of wa ter, but would constitute only a primitive continent, full, and that only later was divided into individual plates. This idea recalls, and much, the old design of the disc my thical land, surrounded by oceans, as Figs. 4 and 5. In a comparison between the co ncept of world-Sumerian Babylonians (Fig. 5) and the layout of tectonic plates, prepared by Wegener, it impresses as a detailed repetition of the first, held at a later date. Of course, in its layout, Wegener could only put the southern continental pla tes in places where he thought they should be placed and where not, in fact, they were. Thus, the plate immediately Brazilian borders with Africa, but pursuing th e line toward North schematic according Wegener, there would be found any trac es of a turf intermediary, Atlantic (Fig. 6). The concept of Wegener, the existence of Atlantis hav e been simulated only by a land bridge, pre-Tertiary, between the European plate and Canadi an turf. When then - despite the reasons - the great tectonic plates moved aw ay from one another, this land bridge was lost, then this would have been the origin of the legend of the submerged continent. Do with it was denied the Platonic narrative, or again she would have gone into shock with a new theory? The theory of Alfred Wegener on continental displacemen t is one of the most brilliant designs of today's Geophysics. Its acceptance by colleague s is cause for satisfaction, only because it broke the dogmatic rigidity which, for dec ades, held the theoretical geology. The question of whether it is correct to the t heory of Wegener, saying that once the continental plates would have been a full disc, is a subject of debate for geologists and cosmologists, the issue of the Atlantic h as nothing to do with this. Probably, at times much earlier to the tertiary perio d, North America and Europe, in fact, were interconnected. \u0000 "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" Figure 6. Map of the Atlantic, in the lower tertiary, a ccording to Alfred Wegener. The Atlantic did not exist, the tectonic plates, stron gly deformed and embedded, in each other, stood side by side. In the scheme Wegemer ( See the figure above) there was no room for Atlantis. Regarding the problem of Atlantis matter, however, the question: where has the demarcation line? Even a genius such as Wegener only man aged to assume the details of the location of that line, without, however, can rediscover, and even less to prove its effective evolution. Want or not want, Wegener also h ad to use a certain amount of free will to draw the lines of demarcation, thus, was bound to make mistakes inevitable about its accuracy, which, because of the small scale of their maps, and could bring in several hundred kilometers. First of all, Wegener thought important to demonstrate t hat once the eastern edge of North America and Western Europe combined board in the w ay of how to combine to make acceptable the revolutionary assertion that, in f act, were related between them.

Strictly speaking, this represents a schematic anticipation of an outcome still to be proven and, ther efore, in principle, affect the argument. A civilization, Florescente over twelve millennia? Also the researchers of antiquity, together with geologi sts, reject the theory of Atlantis. Although Alexander von Humboldt had emphasized the striking s imilarity between monuments found on both sides of the Atlantic, it does n ot get any other conclusion, beyond a vague possibility of missing a land bridge between the Old and New World, or the idea conceived by Alfred Wegener. Particularly and especially archaeologists reject the pa ssages speaking of the Platonic text in a civilization advanced, supposedly thriving in At lanta, more than twelve millennia. For them, the descriptions of a dense populati on, many of the great splendor of royal palaces, the magnificence of the temples, the massive walls, with its sparkling coating, and zinc ores, the wide channels and the facil ities of irrigation, they are only exaggeration mythical, fabulous details, which, a priori, invalidate the whole story in it and subtract the last remnants of credibility. However , with this, went unnoticed by the realistic description of the topography of the western A tlantic, which, in turn, certifies the authenticity of intrinsically Platonic narrative . In turn, the rejection by the archaeologists is also based on a scientific doctrine that says is out of question the existence of an advanced civ ilization, as described by Plato, in time of twelve millennia ago. Well, start with a dense population, large, to be assess ed on the basis of data provided by Plato on the organization of the army Atlantis, n amely: the 480,000 foot soldiers, knights 120,000, 160,000 men to drive cars to 60,000 cars and heavy light , 240,000 sailors, adding nearly a million men carrying weapons. With a rural population that, like the modern Chinese, an d know the agricultural machines and only depended on his skill and manual effort f athoms for the execution of their tasks, the percentage of men in arms may not hav e been great , failing to harm the crops and, thus, create problems with the supply of foodstuf fs. On basis of these considerations, the Atlantis must have counted at least twenty, but, presumably, forty million people. As reported by Plato, only the great plains to the south of the island, covering an area of some 200,000 km2, its \"climate of the Azores\" was highly favorable and their fertility should be equal to the islands of the archipela go of probe, where, before the arrival of Europeans, from 200 to 300 persons per square kilomet er, were tired and quiet living, despite the lack of agricultural machinery and example of that until today, is with China and India. Therefore, the comparison sugges ts a number density of the order of at least forty, or perhaps up to sixty million people in the southern plains, which offered broad support, requiring so-only methods of ir rigation, careful treatment crops and frequent transplantation of plant shoots. If At lantis existed and was inhabited by an industrious people of peasants, that these were alw ays well irrigate all crops in the field, then absence reason to doubt the Platonic n arrative, describing the forces warriors of the island and the number of its inhabitan ts, indirectly deducted there . Now, then, to the pompous walls, surrounding the city real . People rich in metals such as the Babylonians, Egyptians, Incas and Aztecs, nothi ng would have to find those extraordinary works of art. Just remember the dazzling s plendor found in the tomb of"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" the young pharaoh Tutancâmon, very little significant fi gure in the metal coatings zigurato of Babylon, whose magnificence Herodotus speaks w ith full knowledge of the facts, then to have it covered, and the teocalli, cov ered with gold and silver in ornaments and precious stones, the Aztecs and toltecas, and also the temples of the Sun, built by the Incas. And despite this, in the case o f Atlantis, is put into question what, so insofismável, was found with other people, eve n with the Peruvian, enshrined by history as the people who preceded the Age of Metal. \" The pre-Hispanic Central America was less rich in gold, their highly civilized pe oples continued to work the stone of fire, as was first worked by men Palaeolithi c, or chips and polishing it. They were a true tale the treasures of gold, silver and jewels won by Fernando Cortes in Tenochtitlán. The Sierra Morena Spanish, rich in precious metals continues, the island of Madeira, directly to the mountains of Atlanti s submerged. Also there must have been shafts of gold and silver, as well as rich de posits of minerals, like as there was there. This thesis is not hampered by the sterili ty of the mountains in the Azores, because the tops of mountains that now emerge on the sur face ocean, were then the height of 3 to 4 thousand meters, and the mountains of the Azores current representing the highest peaks of mountains submerged and therefore are too high to close veins of metal, whose existence can be assumed in most strata located below and which are now immersed in the ocean. The example given by Old Mex ico attests that a Palaeolithic civilization essentially equal to the Az tecs during the Spanish conquest, was perfectly capable of working precious metals and miner al enriched. Although they had not found the remains of furnaces for m elting Atlantic, it is easy to prove that in ancient times, ovens, melting of natural breeze, were constructed and used in places where less is suspected that they were. Ar e the furnace to melt the legendary King Solomon, in which the copper was cast for the \"sea of metal, the metal altar\", the \"metal seats, containers, shovels and ba sins, and for\" Jachin and Good \" , the two imposing columns, erected before the entrance of th e temple. In 1940, an expedition excavated the North American industrial, large size, in Wadi el-Araba, a desert valley in the southern Neguev, near vast occurren ces of iron ore and malachite in the midst of huge hills formed by the slag and copper mo lds for casting, insofismavelmente identifiable as such. Nelson Glueck, the chief of the expedition, surprised by their findings, raised the question: why these industrial parks have been located in the region exposed to storms, from the North , instead of a few hundred meters to the south, which would have been protected by hills, which still had fresh water springs? The excavations themselves charged with the answer, namely: \"In the center of a rectangular muramento is a large bui lding. The green color of its walls can recognize, easily, in order to help: it was a furnace of fusion. The walls of bricks of clay bearing openings, arranged in two rows . T he smoke and a technically perfect system channels air throughout the complex. On t he whole, the building represents a perfect fusion furnace, modern type, designed o n the principle that a century ago, reappeared in our industry, under the name of Be ssemer furnace! The smoke and chimneys are in exact north-south direction, as the winds and storms in the Wadi el-Araba played the role of bellows. It was well that worked, three millennia ago : today, the fusion furnaces operate with compressed air ... \"(Dr. Werner Keller:\" und die Bibel HAT Doch Recht \"- The Bible was right,\" Mel horamentos Editions, 1973). Thus, a primitive people, owner of a technical, relativ ely rudimentary stage, was able to build such furnaces for melting, which are known, used t o melt the copper, which has seen the supposed nature, recognize and use the aid it o ffered free of charge. Factors were so important, only the individual skill and intuition, which prevailed over"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" the technical means available to men of those times , or it was a good course, possession of which depend on the degree of civilization and before can be found in early stages of cultural evolution, when man is still c losely connected to nature, than a later, more advanced. Furthermore, it should be noted that the ridge of the moun tains of Atlas, the volcano, claiming the sky, the object of divine worship and whose crater, when in eruption where the magma fluid transhipped, the Atlantic had consta ntly before the eyes of a primitive model gigantic fusion furnace, built by the very nature! Therefore, they should have just held that \"intuition\" as a gift, innate, enabling them to find the fundamental principle of a furnace for melting, accessibl e to other people, so only by rough tracks of technical progress. However, even considering all these data, also seem le gitimate doubts as to the traditional dating of periods of \"early\" from the Metal Ages. According to the dictates of the current stage of our progress, we can say that pos t-glacial in Europe and at the same time, the Near East, there was hardly metals be fore 4000 BC, the copper must have happened before 3000 BC and bronze, presumably around 2000 BC Comparison of artifacts, relatively rudimentary and the beginning of the Mesolithic period, such as hooks and harpoons, microlites geometric, badly finished, swords, tools to scratch and punch, made of horn and bones of reindeer and used in civilizations Tardenoisiana and Capsiana with products of high quality end of civilization Magdaleniana, such as strip-shaped leaf of laurel, spearhea d, saw blade, microlites, as well as hooks and harpoons of bone and horn, finishing n eat shows before a setback in Mesolithic artifacts of preparation, for purposes of dati ng the Palaeolithic period. This clearly contradicts the prevailing idea of progress of co ntinuous cultural development. Therefore, the Mesolithic period is now considered as \" gap\", regression, time interval between two cultural, markedly different, which was the period of the glacial upper Palaeolithic, the Neolithic and post-glacial. This set back only if cultural explains as a result of interference in the natural evolution, expres sed in parts found in archaeological excavations. Moreover, the archaeologi cal findings do not confirm the hypothesis of continuous cultural development, without solut ion of continuity, but rather the opposite: the effects of a profound interfere nce in daily life, with a simultaneous change in the glacial climate in the post-gl acial. These two synchronous processes not only may, but shall be made in reciprocal causal relationship. In this respect, the change of climate and the factors that le d to represent the cause of interference in the life of the day to day, as evidenc ed by artifacts dating from that era - and not vice versa. The truth is that such a change of climate as to cause the retreat of continental glaciers ancient, deeply affect the living conditions of people of that time of transition. Equally certain is that the cause of a tra nsition of such proportions, changing and incisive way, the climate of the whole ea rth may not have been a common phenomenon, but probably a disaster. If there was such a disaster - and, if so, those findin gs represent a first proof positive that negative - it may well have eradicated the legacy of a previous advanced civilization, Neolithic, and that complete eradication may have been the point of the modern research pre considered as a historic-almost not hing that it remains in archaeological findings. Also for this event, the days of today that could provide a proof. Please God, if only theoretical. Suppose that a w ar survivor atomic bombs and hydrogen, carbon and cobalt to destroy life in the most part, in today's major centers of civilization, the cities would be destroyed and all docume nts, recording on paper the contemporary knowledge and progress, would be burnt ... What would happen then?"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" Then, after the disaster, the few survivors in remote areas, spared apocalyptic horror that would have the huge task of starting all over again, on the wreckage of the past, starting from point zero. Many millennia have passed an d scientists in the distant future just got to compare the findings, remnants of that time of disaster , long forgotten, with other findings, dating to the centuries that followed it. Scien tists said the initial findings and then more advanced than the latter, but still do not co nsider as evidence for that in a past so remote and that it is for us the present, there would be something called advanced civilization. Probably, despite our current tech nical progress, of which all traces would be erased, the trial of our present time doe s not differ much in that now and we decided on the time of the end of Palaeolithic per iod. For while the seabed is still guarding its secrets. It i s a minimal chance of recovering metal products or other evidence of a civilization disappe ared, through the underwater search. It would be the same as getting a shot in a fly , in a dark room because it is not known with sufficient accuracy, where the search and wo uld begin to fear that the ash and lava were covering with a layer thick and hard , wha t is being sought, would go in search of a prehistoric Pompeii, to 3,000 m below sea lev el. Indeed, so far not found any trace of the legendary treas ure of silver, gold or oricalco, but few were the searches undertaken for this purpose. Des pite this, H. Pettersson says in his book said \"ATLANTIS und Atlantik\" - Atlantis and A tlantic, that something was found, saying: \"A vague indication in this direction was t he finding of a single link in a thin stream of copper, recovered from the mud at the bot tom the sea by a station in Monaco, the South West of Santa Maria (one of the Az ores islands, the N. A.) ... \" Also this finding is coincidental to integrate the arch aeological evidence, which, for purposes of the Palaeolithic period, certified a culture mo re advanced stage than is usually assumed, in accordance with our current concepts ult ralineares concerning the progress of civilizations. Therefore, the proof of the existence of a large isla nd in the Atlantic and the catastrophic loss, it will be of greater importance. I s the Atlantic were a civilized people? The massive construction works, described by Plato, coul d serve as a cornerstone of this thesis. Back to primitive times the origin of gian t constructions made on land, in the valley of the Mississippi River and other U.S. regi ons, such as Monmouths, configuration animalesca, snakes, jaguars, in sizes of h ills and mountains. No idea of who would have built, but there. Its existence can not be called into question, as neither of the island of the Atlantic, with all its submerged huge works. Also, work on earthworks and irrigation made in China, I nsulíndia, India and Peru, also showed examples of an original technique of construc tion, however, fail to receive proper attention. The conformations of sandy-clay loam in China, rice in the empires of Southeast Asia, everything was done by the hand of man, without any mechanical device. Also there, apparently without effort and without fanfare, the primitive technique moved billion cubic meters of earth and contin ues to move them. Plato reports of what works on land, executed in Atlanti s, it is of tasks, from earliest times, for rural communities, employing means and methods of the most primitive and continuing to use them. What there is nothing exaggerated. So, what is impressive and commands respect the proportions are not quantitative, but the mental skills and vocations. Those irrigation systems and pipe reveal a s imply great design. With a minimum of expenditure is obtained by a maximum of success , and it is precisely this"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" which certifies the degree of mental progress, cultural a nd civilization, and drape achieved by implementing such works. However, this also corresponds to the planning of everything mentality totally dedicated to the life o f rustic primitive times. If that concept were able to achieve huge, then they are at ex actly this field of activities vital. The fertile land was the first raw material from whi ch the man was served to his works great. Therefore, the first cultures arose in the alluv ial land of the Nile, the Euphrates and Tigris, the Mississippi, there where the original ma terial of construction existed in great abundance. Nobody could doubt that the vast plain of Atlantis had thi s precious material in quantities equal to those in other countries primitive but best known of the first human civilizations. A light coming to the West? At the time of humanism, the ancient Greco-Roman was considered the most advanced ancient civilizations. Then, we discovered the Ancien t Egypt and the even more ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, the \"onionskin\" the hil l of Troy, the palaces of Minos in Crete, and so on. Always had to learn again, anew. How ever, in what was always a point peaceful, unchanging: the place where ancient civili zations flourished all these is in eastern Europe. The fact also the sun of human civil ization was born in those regions, emerges as an act of cultural memory and easy t o understand. However, it really a law, or just an illusion? In several places around the globe and were still found to be evidence from these schema. They include setting up the huge mountain animals i n the valley of the Mississippi, as well as the civilization of wood and bo ne in Novaya Zemlya, the enigmatic works on the banks of Lake Titicaca and many o thers. Nobody knows the secrets kept by the virgin forests of Mato Grosso, the jungles toltecas and imensidões green along the Amazon River. Does this fit the idea, proclaiming that those regions of the west end of light penetrated the eastern civilizati on? There evidence showing that, exactly, between 20,000 and 10,000 years before our era, emerged in the European species of human evolution cl early superior. This is the man of Cro-Magnon, Homo sapiens of diluvial, whose rest oration is being attempted in the plank and set the 8th The findings of bones and artifacts that allow us to co nclude the existence of human beings in primitive times, are increasing and so remarka ble, in large valleys, leading the East to West, the river Guadalquivir, Tagus and Douro, Char ente, Dordogne and Garonne , all leading in the Atlantic. From which the se new forms? In the years of 1969/70 found in Tierra del Fuego the \"tomb of Pall Aike\", closing a skeleton of more than 10,000 years old, for the first time , was recognized a man of Cro-Magnon and so certified the presence of human kind in South America also Assumed that such natural human being of Europe, these findi ngs should proliferate toward the European center. However, what happens is exa ctly the opposite, because it dominates the man of Neandertal prototype of a real European. Thus, the man of Cro-Magnon can only have arrived in the west, the Atl antic by sea, must have landed at the mouth of rivers, and climbing them, entered the heart of Europe. \u0000 "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" Fig 7. A hypothetical curve of cultural evolution, accordin g to the theory of evolution shows, approximately, the official doctrine of cultural evolution of mankind.

Of course, the thesis of an advanc ed civilization in Atlantis (see dashed range between 20,000 and 10,000) is not consistent wi th this conceptualization. However, is that official curve sho ws a situation of fact? The Figure 8 illustrates the hypothetical migration routes , marked by the graves of Cro-Magnon man, totally different than the man of Nea ndertal and by findings of weapons, finished with more care and far more significa nt effect, with which well could have forced a withdrawal to the Alpine redoubt, the last , so the lower arms of the invaders.

The attempt to reconstitute reveals a remarkable simil arity to Cro-Magnon man of the Indian; equal to the latter, also the Cro-Magnon era of high structure, building strong, muscular, an athletic type, in constant motion.

All immigra nts came from the west, the Atlantic, of Atlantis, in cave paintings appear as red-s kinned men - \"proto-Indians.\" From where the proto-Indian came to Europe diluvial? Thus, there are only two possibilities: either came f rom North and Central America, to 4,000 km away, or come from Atlantis, the only 1500 km on the European continent. Moreover, Plato describes how supposedly, under the Atlant is, just those regions where, later, was still being done and the largest numbe r of findings of the Cro- Magnon man. If those early settlers had come from Atl antis to Europe at the time largely under the glaciation, then the traces of their culture, those left pest European, not at all be considered as representing the degree of ci vilization reached in the island of Atlantis, for what within the European continent w as only a pale reflection of the culture Atlantis. However, at the time, then all life evolved around the activities of hunting, taking advantage of the abundance of hunting in the virgin forests, for example as was later used by white pioneers in North Am erican prairies. They resemble"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" mammoth of the indiscriminate killing of herds of bisõe s in the Americas. Also, does the existence of primitive hunting peoples who , until now, living the Australian deserts, the virgin forests of Central Afri ca, Ceylon, Borneo and the banks of the Amazon, would conclude that their conditions of l ife were found in all the rest the world? This conclusion would be wrong understood only w hen taken by individuals who never went out of its natural reserves and never h ad contact with more advanced civilizations. Moreover, it would be wrong to assume that the early fi ndings Europe, dating from the end of Quaternary period, were decisive for the rest of the world. They do not constitute valid evidence to counter the possibility of being higher than the degree of civilization in the land, which the man of Cro-Magnon came to Europe in comparison with what it found. Who has had the privilege to see and admire the beautiful cave paintings, the end of the Palaeolithic period, should be surprised by the strength of their artistic expression, the perfection of its representation, and the magic of the general impression, conveyed by them. Do the authors of these works of art, often equal ized, would have been forest? But his talents had not finished there. The famous spear head, in the form of a leaf of laurel, Magdaleniana civilization, the wedges and the knif e blades, and finishing of neat setup, cut, manually, the stones of fire, yet do not repr esent the products of a process of polishing semimecânico, adopted in the Stone Age, but w orks created in a very skilful and intelligent processing of raw stone. Moreover , the degree of skill and intuition necessary to create those pieces may well b e judged by those who try to imitate with their own hands, which made the alleged fo restry, ten to twenty millennia ago. This practical process of reliving the past remote allows a proper assessment and safe. When the caravels of Christopher Columbus drop anchor of f the coast of Guanahani, there were a primitive civilization of \"forestry doci le.\" However, when the conquerors of Fernando Cortes found in coastal areas, the periphery of civilization Totonaca, and a short distance from there, the plateau of Anahuac, an a dvanced civilization, they were astonished with the flowering of these crops that far, exceeded the they knew in their homeland in Spain and Portugal. The barbarians were they , the conquerors, not Indians, the won. Similar differences should have exist ed between the life of pioneers, led by the few settlers of Atlantis, Europe, or the me n whose bones, found in Cro- Magnon, gave name to a kind man, on the one hand, and sple ndor in the heart cultural Atlantis, evoking the riches of Tenochtitlán and Babyl onia, on the other side. Also, you could deny the existence on the islands of Jav a and Bali, there arise long before the first white man, an indigenous civilization , primitive in their technical aspect, but advanced in its spiritual aspects, psychological and art istic, when concurrently in the neighboring island of Borneo prevailing customs of ba rbaric hunters-to-head? Then the man continued during the hunter and collector, as happen ed in Europe at the end of glaciations, there, in the center of Indonesian civil ization, flourished a civilization similar to that allegedly would have blooming in Atlanta and produced stunning works, flood of charm to all who came to meet them. Therefore, if to judge on a point target, the lack of fin dings, demonstrating immediately, to worship in caves in southern France an d Spain, which the installation and decoration, dating back to times much more remote and could well have continued in that state, can not be regarded as an argument against the existence, in Atlanta, what, in vain, is being sought in the peripheral areas o f Europe.

Oswald Spengler noted, and with fairness, the nature of vegetative development. By its own standards, flourishing in a specific location that offers the exact and peculiar co nditions, which require for their existence singular and specific. Moreover, advanced civilizations are luxury products; its flowering requires abundance, because the shortage wilt and die. They are th e wealth condition of the soil. Evolved and blossomed in this environment, prefer ably in places of dense vegetation, largely guaranteeing the livelihood of its peo ple and producing more than necessary. We find them in the Nile valley, fertiliz ed and watered by the sacred river, the alluvial lands, the fertile Euphrates and Tigris rive rs, the landscape of sandy-clay loam of China, at last, always and only in areas of lush vegetation, Viçosa. Europe and the stages of glaciation was not part of those regions. A narrow strip of fertile their land was located between the southern al pine glaciers and vast icy expanse to the north, down to 52 ° latitude. And even this small band was still all wet with the waters of melting, accumulated in ponds, puddles and swamps, so far as is demonstrated by the Siberian tundra, a representative la ndscape of Europe in the stages of glaciation. Although it was ideal for hunting, E uropean soil was not suitable for horticulture and the works of construction, and there fore gave rise to a culture of hunters, but failed to produce an advanced civilization, wh ich is a prerequisite sedentary people, done a fertile ground. The findings made in soil confirm this diagnosis. Different conditions prevailed in Atlantis. There was all concentrated in a generous nature could offer a privileged country: ideal climate, fav orable location, in a sea of warm water, strong sunlight, abundant rainfall and, conse quently, fertility almost tropical. Reality, Yes - Legend, No! Evidence in the field of Natural Sciences, accurate evi dence for effects still susceptible of registration and control, and whose origin may not b e other, than the existence of a huge island in the middle Atlantic, the possibility of ch aracterizing, in our Nowadays, Platonic resuscitate the narrative, such as real trage dy of humanity. So far, the demonstration of the exclusivity of the c ause, condition required, adjust title, which was lacking for the arguments presented. Thi s statement could well be the existence of the large island, but also on other facto rs, such as a continent-bridge, a remote country. Therefore, the exclusivity of the cause must be charac terized in a well-defined. Since there is a point in favor of such a definition: the ma in topographic data of the Platonic narrative had confirmation surprising, with the rediscov ery of America. Indications of Plato, for locations, locations and dimensions, is al l confidence. Plato described Atlantis as a large an island of vast extent, for bot h, Alfred Wegener introduced the technical term for turf mainland. This is a fact of de cisive importance. Otherwise, it is a relatively small island, like one of many cubes scatte red in the Pacific Ocean, from the beginning, would be equal to zero, the chances of it Reen contrá or present evidence of his supposed existence. In regions subject to seismic tre mors, the coming and subsequent disappearance of volcanic islands are routine phe nomena, and to both the Pacific became pro-verbial. However, in the Atlantic near the island of Fernando de Noronha, in Brazilian waters, emerged in 1931 that two is lets disappeared however in good time, before they become subject to dispute the power s concerned. Atlantis has"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" also been equal to such an island, or that Sabrina Isla nd in the 80s of last century, was of the waves for a few hours later, to make disappear, i t would be totally useless any attempt to begin to find it . Also, an island is a large chunk ground and more stable. If it raises above the waves and is not just a shallow shoal water and if the locat ion permits, it can influence characteristic, and long lasting effects on the sea ar ound you. And the dip in the ocean, it produced a tuck it could hardly go unnoticed in the context of terrestrial geology. To better understand these linkages met first, a question seemingly primitive but important, namely: what is an island, under the geologica l point of view? An island is a fragment of turf, a segment, once despreen dido the edges of large tectonic plates, the hard granite, according to the move ments of removal, exercised by those boards and therefore lower than that usually prese nt thickness of the turf. While the large chunk, and plate tectonics, penetrates up to 40 to 60 km in the substrate of Sima, dense and viscous-plastic and, according to Alfred We gener's moves to slow secular, away from the horizontal direction in the li ttle islands Sima is deeper in, getting on its surface. To stay within the terminology of Wegener, if the cubes float in the Sima, like glaciers into the sea, islands float li ke corks there. Therefore, due to its volume rather than mass, the islands accompany fluctuati ons in the level of Sima, so much more rapid and significant, than do the large tectoni c plates, massive, heavy and motion ultralento. Depending on specific conditions, an i sland would sink, but a continent can not simply dive to the bottom. Strictly speaking, those islands of type Sabrina or two of those, no name, emerged and disappeared in the vicinity of Fernando Noronha, and are not pieces of balled and therefore should not be called islands, but represent the peaks, temporarily raised, a submarine volcano, or any other increase in the subst rate of Sima, the ocean bed. The Atlantis, in turn, was a real island, a chunk of relati vely low thickness, presumably despreendido double plate tectonics, Eurasia, where, early in the third period, the board moved away towards east. Always and in principle these islands not only legitimat e hit, but still up on the bottom of the sea, penetrating a few kilometers of the substra te Sima. Sometimes, are the tops of huge submarine elevations, like the Azores. However, in nature there is no floating islands, there are only those made by the hand of man, of reinforced concrete and serving as platforms for the drilling of oil wells in s hallow marine waters. Now to deal with the effects of surface, produced by a la rge island situated in the midst of ocean, in its capacity as clod of earth, alone. Th eir presence interferes with the movements of the sea, the larger the island, the great er the extent of such interference. Wind and storms lash the vast ocean surface, its wind r ipple the mirror of water, causes the waves and been accumulating, as the speed of th e winds, is pile up, rise up high and down to deep valleys. Besides these undulating movem ents, caused by winds, blowing hard and in different directions, there are othe r current, more rare, but constant. Are caused by periodic winds, blowing with unifo rm speed and always in the same direction, called the monsoon. In this case, it is a continuous running surface. From which the monsoon? The earth rotates on its axis north-south. He transm its this movement to the rotating layer of air that surrounds it, to our atmosphere, but th ere is some loss in transmission, which in turn, causes a certain delay in the movement of the envelope of air, compared with the area of the equatorial belt, where the rotat ion is faster, going from 400 mp /"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" second. This delay produces the constant east wind, preval ent throughout the tropical band (except in the area of calm, just on the equator, w hich, however, it matters little to our topic). In northern latitudes the circumferential speed of the e arth diminishes, so the atmosphere there, brought by tropical air, for cutting fo rces, Southern, begins to win the race and those areas of change in the direction of the winds westerly winds prevail. They produce a regular flow of wind at sea surface, easy h andling, sea currents in parallel with the air. The east monsoon in tropical w aters lead the current to the west and vice versa, in the higher latitudes, there is a curr ent, east. Both complement each other to a closed-circuit, as shown in Figure 9. These m ovements of water always and in principle are originated on the surface of the sea ba sins, surrounded by continents. However, not all times are regular as in the case of inferred from the schematic framework in hand, essentially correct in their littl e tracks. Also the Atlantic Ocean is such a sea basin, surrounded by continents, on both sides, and is also cut by such flow, regular. One, known as the Gulf is famous for its natural potential. Its range of blue waters cut across the bed o f gray and cold waves of the Atlantic, in an extension of hundreds of miles, betwee n 34 ° and 43 ° latitude north, in west-east direction. If there were, in the midst of t he Gulf, a large island, the waters of that gigantic river blue, sometimes directed to Northwes t Europe, would crash into the west coast, and it would be diverted from its path, force d to turn in large curve to return to the West. \u0000 "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" Figure 9.

However, the scope"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" of this trail lead to the goal target is subject to the contingency of the island, in fact, was situated in the midst of the Gulf and not to any oth er place. In the narrative of Atlantis, Plato does not provide very accurate data about their location, he reported only allows the deduction of the Atlantis was located i n a region west of the Atlantic, more or less able to Gibraltar. Ceases to be a direc t reference, accurate to the Gulf or its vicinity. On the other hand, can be verified by research, is th e climate of northwestern Europe, known for conditioning the Gulf, where it was equal to wh at is currently finishing up there by a current of warm water, to the western edge of Europe, or is there once the weather was different, allowing the conclusion that, a t some time, the Gulf has been captured and diverted from its route by an obstacle then e xisting in the middle Atlantic and now disappeared. The subsequent investigation, based on this supposition, re fer to expressly and exclusively to such a hypothetical blockade of the Gulf. For now only appropriate as the existence of such a blockade would affect the climat e of Northwest Europe and, in the geological past, there was a time to be specified, s cientifically, that undoubtedly reveal the signs of these influences. That is what this is. At this height is of secondary importance regarding the que stion of such a blockade of the Gulf or not be identical with the island of Atlant is, narrated by Plato. For now it does not matter whether the blockade of the Gulf had a n ame and what was that name. In the Gulf and the isotherms Strictly speaking, is called the Gulf Stream the party th at, originating in the Gulf of Mexico, the huge current cyclical shipping in the Atlanti c, twice across the ocean, in a total length of 20,000 km. It forms a loop, driven by energy from the wind and heat. The current has its beginning as current west, in the t ropical Atlantic. Then is taken by the east monsoon, blowing from the area of Guinea, he ading to Brazil, heading straight to the nose, pointing eastward, the head of the giant Br azilian triangular plate. The Figure 10 shows how the nose divides the waters that beat against it. As the nose is located in Brazil, approximately 10 ° south latitude, it div erts a part of a water body from the South Atlantic, the Northwest, the North At lantic. Above the equator, these waters meet with the current parallel, addressed to the North. Thus, the mass of water towards the coast of Central America are being enrich ed and to an appreciable extent, with the waters of the South Atlantic, which increas es in its very strength and power. Already in that area, the quantity of water that gather there, beyond the existing in all the rivers of the earth. Taken by the east monsoon and due to its high salt conte nt, the current color of azure climb the north coast of Brazil, always pursuing toward northwest. Then the first time, is being diverted from its original direction west, star ting his turn. She floods the vast delta of the Amazon River mouth, all covered with jungle , dams of the largest fresh water of inland rivers.

It is difficul t to find the exit. In slow, always slow, the current, this process will be burning, through, first, the Caribbean and then the Bay of Iucatã. Gradually, it expands and loses in depth .

Those are the two positive factors, to which the regi ons, bathed by the Gulf Stream, its climate should, called the Atlantic. It is a gift of th e Gulf and a privilege of inestimable value, especially for the North West Europe. The average elevation of air temperature, calculated on the sea level, has been used as an index characteristic of the climate, it represents a value arithmetically quantitative- friendly demonstration. His determination is made by th e record of average annual and monthly, which allows a clear and well defined climati c conditions and their changes, subject to the seasons. For the month of January, the coldest in the northern hemisphere, this index is 5 ° C positive, in the West of England, to Labrador on the ea st coast of North America, located in the same latitude, the average is 10 ° C negati ve. This difference, highly sensitive, 15 ° C shows, immediately, the strong influen ce of the Gulf Stream the climate of England, received with the Gulf Stream, whic h is not the case with the Labrador, located outside the route of its warm waters. In July, the summer European and American, the air temperature rises to 17 ° C positiv e in the West of England, and only 10 ° C positive, in Labrador. To the west of Englan d, the average annual air temperature is 10 ° C positive, the Labrador is 0 ° C. In Labrador, the oscillation of the annual air temperature is 25 ° C, when the West of Englan d is only 12 º C. In summary, the Labrador, the route out of the Gulf Stre am, shows the typical continental climate, with its storms and extreme fluc tuations in temperature, making that land a subarctic character. England, at the same l atitude, is much more mild climate, sea, without large fluctuations and is thus privi leged with the passage of the Gulf in his back. This privilege, derived from the passage of the Gulf, is o f extreme value material.

It proved the existence of a link, yet to be defined in its details, from the climate of North West Europe during the Quaternary period and the course followed by the Gulf Stream. However, this book is not a manual of Geology or Paleo climatologia and not want to disclose exact terms of climate change, in primitive t imes. Thus, leaves open the question whether, if so, should be responsible for order astronomical causes, such as fluctuations in the earth's orbit, displacement of APSI D, changes in obliquity of the ecliptic, or cosmic factors, such as the passage Dark cl ouds of mist. So contentemo us how important result, indicating the ex istence of glaciers ambivalent to the right and left of the Atlantic during the Quaterna ry period. The two continents were under many layers of ice, with huge expansion somet imes reached the latitude of 50 °. For us, this is only somewhat important and intere sting to find that latitude where the line should be drawn demarcatória between the region s covered and free of glaciation. There, where those lines demarcatórias per sisted longer, left its traces, as shown accumulations of rock debris; are called belts of terminal moraines of known location. In line more or less parallel, monitor the meridians, which both pass through the New, as the Old World. Also the North Atlantic ha d such a demarcatória line between the perimeter and the free water taken by floa ting ice, which corresponds to the boundaries drawn on continental land. The Figure 12 shows the approximate route of the line demar catória. At the time of major expansion of glaciation, it was between 45 ° and 50 ° of latitude, however, to remember that for our subject matter not so much the e xact definition of latitude, but the general layout of these lines demarcatórias the ex pansion of glaciers . It turns out that this track gives, so unmistakable, with the isothe rms, corresponding to a normal temperature, free of influences exerted by the Gulf Stre am. What these lines mean demarcatórias expansion of glaci ations, following the route of isotherms? The layers of ice permanently, resistant to the passa ge of years, only conditions were to persist while the average annual temperature was belo w zero degree and had a minimum of variations. There, where the land began to be free of ice, the temperature must have risen above zero degree. \u0000 "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" Figure 12. The limits of glaciation in the Quaternary. Th e belts of moraines terminals, found in Canada and in Europe, serve as benchmarks for eva luating the progress achieved by effective limits of glaciers in south direc tion during the Quaternary period. The West and East Atlantic, these limits were approxim ately equal in latitude. As soon as there arises, so clear during the Quaternary, the cl imate in northwestern Europe was not privileged, compared to the Northeastern United State s. This is lawful for the regions whose topography allowed l ittle bit bumpy slope in the transition of land covered in ice, for the vegetation cover. Also, there where the glaciers, down by steep falda, penetrating deep into the lo w areas, as happens in South American mountain ranges, it is not so easy to identif y the edges of glaciation with the zero degree isotherms. But also for our present case, it must be remembered that the edge of Quaternary glacier provides but a rough indication of the location of contemporary isotherms to zero degree, because in those days also, time or other, the bodies of glaciation, covering the ground land, could have a dvanced much beyond the limit of zero degree in could no longer reach it. Howeve r, roughly, we may say that the glaciers would have extended standing to where the average temperature was close enough from deseongelação. However, this hypothesis does not draw a line geographically well defined, but indicates a strip of land, wide variety, within which, there or there, was at the perimeter, also variable, affected by glaciations in advance, or respectively in retreat.

Already mentioned, elsewhere, the repeated climatic changes durin g the Quaternary period, when the various stages of glaciation, alter-ing up with periods of more moderate climate, the intermediate stages. All climate oscilla tion manifests itself in the corresponding displacement of the isotherms. By treating the quaternary isotherms, it indicates at least some time to which they relate. S uch as climate and specific characteristic of the Quaternary period has its purest e xpression in the temperature was epiglacial itself or quaternary in temperature, the isoth erms of maximum glaciation, or more expressive of Quaternary climate, are called isot herms quaternary. Its layout and especially the characteristic of isotherms to zero de gree, which has to be reconstituted on the belt of terminal moraines, located further sout h, is what matters to our subject, not its exact location. Therefore, it be only one ge neral route and not a scientifically accurate restoration of quaternary isotherms. Incidenta lly, this track gives us a vision sufficiently accurate and comprehensive picture of climat e diluvial. From there we can draw the same conclusions about the Quaternary climate, which can be taken from the layout of the isotherms to zero degree, the Holocene pe riod, about the weather five- tenário, modern. With this, the indices have jurisdiction to weather co nditions, unknown, the Quaternary period. In Figure 12, showing the layout of the zero degree isother ms, quaternary, the limits of the glacial area, confirming that, at that time, the track was much different from the current level of zero isotherms. Although there was no wind that feature to the north, indicating the bag of gifts, brought by the Gulf Stream. By way of comparison, Fig 13 shows both isotherms of degr ee zero and thus illustrates the radical difference between the two climate geologic al periods. With the clarity of such diagrams, confirms that, indeed, throughout the Quatern ary period, the North West Europe has not enjoyed the privilege of their curren t weather conditions and, like the contemporary North American, was covered by a huge layer compact ice. As frankly favorable climate of North West Europe is c onditional to the Gulf, the absence of such bias during the Quaternary period indicates that the most likely period in the Gulf has not yet passed off the coasts of Europe. Could hardly be mistaken about this, because in those days in Ireland was a land arctic, inhospitable, full of ice, while today, irrigated by the Gulf Stream, palm trees an d other subtropical plants grow on the edge of the Irish Sea, even during the mild winter . This striking difference, dispute, between the weather and Quaternary periods in the current, gives us almost certain that in those times, there has not yet star ted to the Gulf, thanks to which, in later times, Ireland was cognominadade Island green. Prudence tells obtained substantiate the premise. So let 's examine and resolve, first, a problem intermediary to learn whether any of the othe r cause to explain this climate change so markedly, than that set by the absence and ar rival, respectively, of the Gulf coast in Northwest Europe. \u0000 "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" Figure 13.

Dali concludes unequivocally that throughout the Quaternary in the Gulf was not the North West Europe. Without doubt, by itself, the absence of the Gulf not e nough to explain the formation of huge glaciers in Canada and Scandinavia, and the strange change periodically, recorded in ice sheet. Of course, for that, other fact ors contributed, a cosmic and telluric. The Figure 13 is not intended at all, solve all the problems of the ice age, but this does only part of the problem, relating to the fol lowing: regardless of all other factors, workers, the specific form and extent of glaci ation in diluvial North West Europe would or would not be the sole consequence of the ab sence of the Gulf? If there were any additional factors, promoting the glac iations, were telluric or cosmic in nature, they should affect the temperature, at least in the northern hemisphere of the globe. For example, a general decline in temperature, poss ibly caused by the passage of a cosmic cloud of dark mist, absorbing and weakening the sun would have caused a parallel shift of all the isotherms in the northern hemisphere. Similarly, a partial decrease of temperature in the northern hemisphere, due t o other causes cosmic, should affect the local temperature. Supposed that during the stages of glaciation, in the Gulf has passed the North West Europe, for example as there is today, it would be easy to reconstruct the Quaternary climate for this h ypothetical case.

According to this theory, i n Canada, they should it would be located between 40 ° and 45 ° latitude, while in North West Europe, the glaciers have advanced by only 65 ° latitude. The British Isles, Irelan d and Norway, to the height of Trondheim and Nansi, would have been free of glaciations . However, in reality, the masses of ice have reached throughout England and in Europe fell almost to the regions that currently are in Berlin. Its location, i ndelibly marked by traces perpetuated the terminal moraines, which attests to how insofis mável factors general glaciation, were telluric or cosmic alone would never have been suf ficient to explain precisely this lack of \"bag of gifts\" that, if and in principle, benefit s the temperatures of the northeast Atlantic, where will the Gulf and, correspondingly, no l onger spread their donations for which it is not. However, other plausible possibilitie s to explain this crucial feature, in different ways. Therefore, the absence of the Gulf is in the only pos sible cause of the effective area of glacial in northwest Europe. Only that, throughout the Qua ternary period, in the Gulf, certainly not reached Europe, the Swedish glaciers, whos e formation could happen with both the passage of the Gulf, had its prodigious expans ion and reached across England and the whole North West Europe. The consequent ab sence in these regions, the current climate privileged in the Quaternary period, c ould have its cause in the absence of the Gulf at the time in question. What is t he Paleontology think of this? In his capacity as current sea, the Gulf is caused by th e monsoon, which in turn, result in immediate, result of engage-ment between the loose e arth in rotation and its envelope of air. Without doubt, the earth also revolved during the Quaternary. Logo, naqueles tempos, certamente, as monções sopravam da mesm a forma de como estão soprando agora, como as do Leste passando sobre as latitude s mais baixas, e as do Oeste sobre as latitudes mais altas. Thus, the pattern of movement of water, as Figure 9, is also valid for the Quaternary period. In those tim es, the waters warm, tropical, were also taken to the West and in the upper portion of t he whirlpool of sea currents, the current diverted to the east coast of North Americ a, went to the East, or Europe. In the Gulf is as old as the Atlantic itself. Absent of any reason to suppose that, in the Quaternary period, there was a pit of water between Europe and America. In all likelihood, it was opened in the early Tertiary period, with the mutual expulsion of large tecton ic plates, which would be the reasons for this. At the end of the Quaternary period, the position of tectonic plates, of course, was very similar to today. Their removals bega n, and largely completed in the previous geological period, or the tertiary. The example o f what happens today, also in the Quaternary period, extending from the Atlantic Arcti c Sea to the Antarctic, with continental plates on both its sides. Like today, also in those ancient times the northern and southern monsoon took the waters warm, tropical, to the west, and the nose plate formed by Brazil, were directed to the North Atlantic. \u0000 "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" Figure 14.

Englan d, Ireland and Norway would have been saved from its ice sheet. The comparison wi th the actual layout of the limits of glaciation (Fig. 12) evidence that its location is due, and only, the absence of the Gulf. It follows that the Quaternary in the Gulf was n ot the North West Europe. Today, as formerly, the Brazilian northeastern coast forward these waters for Central America, where, since there were very, presumably ear ly in the third, judging by the extensive layers of lava, the formation geotectônica was essentially complete.

The latest research and special conditions of the arc of the Antilles orogeny confirmed, however, that the formation of large basins for entr y into the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico back to the Pliocene, the last phase of the third geological period (tertiary). With the exception of the general lowerin g of sea level in the Quaternary, resulting from retention of large bodies of water in pol ar areas, the oceanographic conditions prevailing in the regions of origin of the Gul f, were identical to those present. And even the lowering of sea level, the order of about 90 m, failed to influence visible. Would be likely that in those days the Atlantic Maritim e fossa was less than the current width. With this, the path of the Gulf, atravessan-do i t, would have been less extensive and therefore on their arrival there, across the Atl antic, its waters would be even more warm now. In assessing these two influences, are deriv ed from the finding that, in extreme case, one should compensate the other. Also in the Quaternary period, the"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" climatic effects produced by the Gulf Stream in the Nort h West Europe were similar to those currently recorded in the Holocene, which meant in those times, had arrived by then. However, it has not arrived by then, as the show glac iations in western Europe. Also, during the whole Quaternary period, there was a curr ent southern, northern and one of the monsoon, as to this, no doubt. Warm water, tropical, passed along the coasts of Brazil, the Central and North America, unti l the world dominated by the west winds. This is also an undeniable fact, no doubt. Theref ore, in the Quaternary, in the Gulf, brought by winds west, entered the North Atlantic in the region of approximately 40 ° north latitude, and from there through it in the east . Moreover, it is also true that in those times, the G ulf not reached Europe, on the other side of the Atlantic. This allows only one conclusion , namely at any point in the middle Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf was captured and diverted from it s course. This common ground point, reached in an attempt to rebuild, just initial ly promising, has proved sufficiently robust as a basis for subsequent searches. Eco Atlantic Ocean Until now, the search for valid tracks produced very inte resting results, even sensational, in the course of an entire geological peri od, a powerful river, larger than the total of all the rivers of the globe, entered the Atlantic, but it has not left. This river is not lost in the ocean, such as the Tarim River ha s been lost in the desert of Central Asia. In the absence of their arrival to the wester n coast of Europe there is only one satisfactory explanation, the supposed existence of a ba rrier material, an effective blockade of sufficient length to capture it, or perhaps dive rt it from its course. Where you have located this block of the Gulf? Oceanographical The map shows that this block no longer exists on the surface. This gives the radical change of climate in Northwest Europe, caused the disappearance of that lock after the last stages of glaciation. It was then that, in fact, to the Gulf for the first time he came, with its warm waters, its winds humid, hot, rain, inaugurating the melting and forcing, gradually, the retreat of glaciers to the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. For one reason or another, must have bee n at that time that the rupture occurred, removing the lock, then preventing the movement of warm water from rain and winds for Europe. Today, after diverting the east coast of North America , the Gulf Stream reaches the respectable width from 600 to 800 km. Therefore, to capture it , the lock should have the length from 800 to 1000 km in the cross direction into th e sea. In its roadmap general, the Gulf is directed towards the east, so the b lockade should have been located in north-south direction. Furthermore, it should have been a large increase, rising from the bottom of the ocean, above sea level , for now, its width can not be stated with certainty. Perhaps some of its dimensions are 1000 km in length, about 400 km wide, and to reach the seabed, must have had more than 3 km in depth, so your total should have been a million cubic km. It is impossi ble to land mass of matter such proportions have been dissolved into dust or anything. She could not disappear without leaving traces. Anywhere should have left few i dentifiable remains to be found only in the bottom of the Atlantic basin, under the s ection covered by the Gulf Stream. Therefore, it consult oceanographers about the soil prof ile in the bed of the Atlantic, as they meet the necessary conditions to meet us so accur ate and conclusive. The fig. 16 gives a simplified view, in perspective, the oc ean basin, emptied of its"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" waters, part of the North Atlantic. All the Atlantic Ocean is a huge basin of 16,000 km in length and about 5,500 kilometers of medium width, covers a n area of 98 million km2 and contains 350 million km3 of water, weighing more than a third of trillion tonnes. Only one of these bodies of water, volume unim aginable, shares of the Gulf. Since the last 90 years, the values of depth of the Atla ntic and the profile of your soil, these computed values, are the favorite subject oceanogra phers. Great efforts have been and are being developed to avoid any solution of cont inuity in the availability of vast material resources necessary for such studies. The history of this sector of the research submarine is a chapter interesting. Its beginning dates back to 1860, from a Swedish expedition, w hose equipment was much more primitive than today. Then Wyvill Tompson and Carpenter continued in research and applied them throughout the British system, a lthough in the course of the work almost sink your ship \"Lightning\", the time now rath er old and obsolete. However, efforts by two British researchers have ma naged to draw the attention of competent circles in Britain, then owner of the ocea ns, and the government to provide another boat, well equipped, the \"Porcupine.\" Results epoch. In 1872, the expedition set sail on board the \"Challenger\", which became famo us, and conducted 370 surveys, 255 measurements of temperature and 129 launches network traile r, along the 8,000 miles of its total route. Already those first systema tic research revealed the fact that the soil of the Atlantic not plan, but provide a focus stron gly profiled, for example as has been demonstrated by the diagram of Figure 16. Subsequent trips, especially those made by \"Hydra\" United K ingdom, the \"Dolphin\" and \"Gettysburg\" of the U.S., and finally, the \"Meteor\" in Germany, have provided numerous individual data and, thus, more than 10,000 surveys of e conomic, according to the principle of Behm. With suscinto and comprehensiv e report, published by H. Stocks on the \"Scientific Results of the German Atlan tic Expedition\" of 1935, it was obtained the following table, in much expanded our knowledge of the Atlantic Ocean: A vast Atlantic basin is divided into two basins in par t, by a large dorsal submarine, which extends from Iceland to the regions of Antarctic a. The average depth of the western basin is 6500 m, and the eastern basin of 4500 m, at some points, the depth exceeds the limit of 7,000 m. The dorsal parting between the two basins partial is ca lled \"dorsal Dolphin,\" in honor of the boat operations geometric 'the U.S. with this name, but also talks about Atlantic and back, with less property in Atlantic plateau. He reac hes the average altitude of 2,750 m on the seabed. The Figure 16 shows the cutting of elev ation, strongly marked, crossing the North Atlantic, 40 ° of latitude, north, sa ys there is a conformation of great width of some 300 to 400 km in the line of the 4,000 m deep, presenting as a folding submarine, whose targeting and supposed home address el sewhere. However, at this stage of research, an interesting feature of t his particular ridge on the seabed. At one point, at approximately 30 ° west and latitude 40 ° no rth latitude, the folding extends to a training strange, enigmatic, giving the appear ance of a vast submarine plateau, a vast mass ground submerged.

Indeed, looking at the map, this complex odd jumps in the eyes, with their tops in the for m of art, raising it above sea level, are the Azores Islands. Several of these ridges , and the High Peak, reaching 6,000 m in altitude. Some volcanoes are active, others, e xtinct. This land below sea level, the platform called the Azo res, is of decisive importance for our research, because it is located exactly under the Gul f Stream. Today, the sea current, somewhat hindered by the tiny islets, coming h ere and there, amidst the desert of waters, directs its waves to the east. It is only at this point, indeed the only, where the Gulf Stream crosses the Atlantic back, there clea rly extended, some of which has not by mere chance. Moreover, nowhere in the bottom of the sea approaches as far as the flower of the water here and this is the exact l ocation, endorsed by our research. Here ends the track which, starting from the Gulf, thro ugh the laws of the isotherm in the Atlantic, the limits of glaciation in the Quatern ary period and the requirement of a blockade diluvial the Atlantic, led us, inevitably, to th is singular point and precise. We compliment to merge now, a fanciful idea, as follows . Suppose, for whatever hypothetical reason, in the Atlantic Ocean, sea leve l, suddenly, was kneeling in the order of 3,000 m, and this process could be observed, the boa rd of a spacecraft. What were you? Well. In this and only this exact point, there is a h uge massive ground floor, with high mountains, the steep falda, and this massive set would be in the barrier to the Gulf, which is just above the dorsal Atlantic. The waters o f the Gulf would crash into the west coast, slightly curve of this great island, new-bo rn foam of the sea. Ali then the water would be dammed, scintillant rise in waves, would b e diverted to and violently hits in a wide curve of return, around the Sargasso Sea, return to the West, as shown by Figure 17. Possibly, only the main contingent of the Gulf would ha ve been diverted in this way. Perhaps, an arm of the relatively weak secondary curren t has reached the northern tip of the X lock and, with it, moved a little further nort h to the cold Labrador Current, the west. However, the north and east of the island w ould not have existed in blocking"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" the Gulf Stream with its warm waters and air masses o f warm and humid. The Northwest European gozaria not the restraining influence of the ocean and would have been exposed to the weather and the cold continental cl imate. In times of strong trends of glaciation, increased by telluric and cosmic additiona l factors, such conditions would have led to the total glaciation of those areas, not favored by climate, such as happened in the same latitudes in North America. As foreshadowed the total glaciation came to realize i s, indeed, in the fourth geological period, the non Fig. 17 illustrates a hypothetical possibil ity, but demonstrates the real situation and well known, reigning in the North Atlantic . The \"lock X\" which, in this hypothetical experiment, is in our mind, in reality is a real island in the North Atlantic blocking. And at the end of the Quaternary period, the isl and, blocking real and true, into a massive dorsal submarine in Atlantic. With that, she came to be found. To prevent against possible misunderstandings, repeat and em phasize again that we have demonstrated an imaginary experience, illustrating t he coming of the imagery block submerged. Moreover, Prof.. Pettersson made this s ame way in your example already mentioned book \"ATLANTIS und Atlantik\" - Atlantis and Atlantic. However, no work that has been said here, nor is meant that th e island was returned to the Atlantic blocking surface with the effective lowering o f the sea and later became submerged again, with the lifting sea levels. What happene d, really, was the opposite, in all, the sea level remained unchanged, but there was kneeling in the seabed, followed by turf island fincas it, leading, therefore, the curren t platform of the Azores. Then you know more accurate data of this process, susceptible of r estoration in all its details. A priori, it can be stated with great certainty that t here, in the Azores, found the only place where a massive ground, once above sea level and n ow submerged, could be dammed and diverted the waters of the Current Gulf. In addition to demonstrating this result general and cardin al, the fig. 17 also illustrates the influence of the \"lock X\" in isothermal Atlantic during the Quaternary period. The isotherm 0o rose approximately in parallel with the mer idians, left the Northeast of North America, on 45 ° north, along with the Gulf, whic h followed, and slowly rising to the north, where there emissary of a weak current of warm water, fighting pointlessly against the Labrador, the cold water, she o utlined a mild wind, in addition to approximately 30 ° west, continued at 50 ° north, on his way to the east, towards the west coast of Europe, completely covered with ice. With this, the limits of the Quaternary glaciation are theoretically reconstructed i n perfect agreement with the location of the terminal moraines. The comparison be tween the weather again and the situation in fact, present in Quaternary period, give in all points. Thus it was shown that the total glaciation of northwestern Europe was a prerequisite and was conditional on the existence of an island in the Atlantic, which crashed in the Gulf. \u0000 "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" Figure 17. The Gulf Stream and North Atlantic diluvial isot herms. In general, the isotherms follow in parallel with the meridians. Inst ead of the West and North West Europe, as happens today, in those days the island of Atla ntis, in front of the U.S. east coast, enjoyed a privileged climate. The result of this research is of utmost importance to the problem. Certifies, and no doubt, the fact that, throughout the fourth geological perio d, in the area where today is located the islands of the Azores, there was a huge mas sive ground floor of some 400,000 km2 of surface, which blocked the Current Gulf and in lar ge part, was responsible for his return to the West. At any time and in any event, this massive ground floor , where there is no doubt, must have disappeared, to sink by about 3 km, has become the ext ension of the dorsal Atlantic submarine. Now we can go to the following question: when it sank bl ockade of the Gulf? The answer is not very difficult, because the block the re and disappeared in the Quaternary period. The disappearance of the \"lock X\" coinc ided with the end of the Quaternary, or the flood. Nomen est omen. The very id entity of Geology produced the catastrophic disappearance of the blockade of the Gulf wit h the classic flood. We have the most or least helpful about the time when the hands of Geology of the room moved to the fifth period. However, until recently and the subjective estimates exceeded the time objective counts. And yet there was n othing and there are negligible differences between the views of geologists and paleonto logists. Therefore, it should listen to the greatest possible number of individual esti mates, authentic and plausible to take the average then it could be considered as the predomi nant theory, accepted by contemporary experts. It is really remarkable and which certifies the accura cy of the method, the average value to give to 12,000 years, today, accepted as \"best\" value estimate, obtained by de"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" Geer, by counting the bands in ceramic decorations in S wedish, the Neolithic lower, on the basis of which estimated the time elapsed between quintenário and today. These two values, the \"best value\" computed by de Geer and our av erage, differ in a few 8% only. Taking into account the imprecision factor, inevi tably present in such calculations estimated, this result can be deemed as quite satisfactor y. Therefore, we may expect the correlation of contempor ary geologists and paleontologists, the set of twelve millennia ago, or a round 10,000 BC, the period marking the end of the Quaternary period and the beginning o f the Holocene. This also was the date set in the \"Block X\" sank in the waves of the Atlantic and that until then had been diverted to the Gulf of Europe, leaving its west coast exposed to the advance of glaciers. We just find the time in March, divisor of geological per iods. We just find the time of initiation of melting and subsequent retreat of glaciatio n, when the Gulf has its warm waters and winds of rain, since that has ceased to be diverted to the west, blocking the island and whose disappearance has then their free passage to the east. Thus, we detect the tracks of the greatest cataclysm ex perienced by human history. Never before have the recorded history of mankind most terrible and tragic event of that catastrophe of unimaginable proportions, happened some 12 millennia ago. The mental probe, launched in the shadow of the Quaterna ry period and the depths of the Atlantic, reached the target goal. Now you can compa re the findings with what made the story of Atlantis from Plato contains compar able data. First, the narrative allows Platonic highlight three elements of comparison, ie, referring to the location, the scale and the time of the catac lysm. Let's start with the first of these to the test loc ation. An excerpt of the report provides an approximate location platonic, as saying: \"... In vi ew of the mouth that you used to call the Pillars of Hercules, there was an island, wh ose extent was greater than Libya and Asia together, and from from there, it was then pos sible to cross to the other islands and those islands, for the whole continent, in front ... \" It is highly informative to comment, saying that thos e islands could make the crossing to the continent, located opposite. This indication ref ers, surely, to the islands of Bermuda and Bahamas, the West Indies of today, and Americ a! At that distant time, the island region must have been greater than today, the example of how South Florida appears as a remnant of continental land. The highest po ints of this part of land continenetal out of the surface ocean, and within a ra dius wider than that, comparatively, as part of Canada. This allows the Atla ntis of Plato was located approximately in the latitude of Spain, between the Europe an continent and the arch formed by the West Indies. The words \"before the Pilla rs of Hercules\" indicates its proximity to Europe, placing it, therefore, in the easte rn Atlantic. To draw a line, from the latitude of Spain and continuing towards west, it cros ses with land submerged in the seabed, at one point in the eastern Atlantic, nam ely in the Azores. Therefore, the Atlantis would have occupied this part of Central and Nort h America, or at least have maintained contact with the people who lived there. Thi s thesis is supported and confirmed by the legends of the indigenous population of Cen tral America. However, where were in the eastern Atlantic, the islands form erly existing at the time of Spain? Today, there are only and exclusively in the Azores, po ssibly, still part of the perimeter Bermuda and the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and finally t o America. The location is not perfectly exact Platonic. Howeve r, the narrative conveyed by tradition, just the few local indications, which allow to reconstruct the real situation of the island submerged. Moreover, the following fact which did not go unnoticed by"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" Athanasius Kircher and other researchers of times gone , it remains valid also for the current research, a recovery free from any prejudice, b ased on objective and conclusive account of the original text, or may choose another po int within the North Atlantic. And this place needs is the point of intersection of th e Gulf and Atlantic dorsal, which undoubtedly must have existed the \"lock X\" at the time, an island above sea level, which divert the Gulf Stream , forcing its return to Am erica. The second element of comparison used to test the terri torial extension of Atlantis. Plato described Atlantis as the \"bigger than Libya and A sia together.\" Asia is the Platonic of time today's Asia Minor, and Libya to the regions of North Africa, known in antiquity. This estimate is little summary informat ion, considering also the limited notions of antiquity geodéticas and seasons that preceded i t, it can be only the conclusion that, in fact, it was a very big island. Of greater importance it is the contingency of these generic data have been supplemented b y other, more precise, when the narrative account that the region south of th e island was a vast plain, covering an area of 3000 x 2000 stadia, and six million stadium squares are equal to 200,000 km2. Supposed that this would have taken extensive plains m ore or less half of the total area of the island, it is a global exten sion of 400,000 km2, ie the exact amount, calculated on the basis of the lines of depth wi thin the Azores and computed independently of Platonic information. Turning now to the third element of comparison on the t ime of the disappearance of the island blocking the Gulf. Based on geological and eight estimates in accordance wit h the \"best value\", determined by de Geer, was unanimously given to both the time around 10,000 BC The Egyptian informant from Plato said, shortly: \"Firs t of all, it noted that a total of nine thousand years have passed, since, as reported, was that war ... \" The text mentions that Platonic war ended with the earthquake tha t swept the Atlantis of the Earth's surface. The conversation between the priest of Neita and Solon took place around 570 BC, so according to tradition, Atlantis disappeared in about 9500 BC The comparison of these two dates - 10,000 BC and 9500 - shows an a lmost perfect agreement. Were three elements susceptible of examination. In te sting the three, the indications given by Plato completely with what, regardless of them , was determined by exact methods, practiced within the Natural Sciences. The Atlantis and the \"lock X\" located in the same place , the perimeter of the Azores. The area occupied by each was 400,000 km2. They disappeared at the same time, approximately 10,000 years before the advent of the Christi an era. This is the result, condensed into a few sentences, th e critical and objective comparison of what we achieve. Dali is inferred, without reserva tions, by identididade of the two objects of comparison, duly attested by three tests, ex amining its key characteristics. The Atlantis was that \"X lock.\" What, despite the 25,000 books on the subject, still awaitin g solution, was detected by the probe of the exact search. She showed where the A tlantis slid up to 3,000 m depth in the sea which gave its name. In the Gulf, there is , the tiny islets, guard the secrecy of the Atlantic and the island of Atlantis. When the \"Me teor\" passed by the area of the Azores, after launching echo echo to the seabed and ann otate data by those accused of the deep surveys, hardly anyone of the crew would have don e very remarkable idea of the meaning of sound pulses, returning there by far and rec orded by ultra-sensitive"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" microphones installed on board, no mistrust that transm it the echo of a vanished world, since there was much the echo of Atlantis. After twe lve millennia, those sound pulses, obtained by the method Behm, were the first people call ed to live a forgotten island in the ocean floor, which responded by returning them. Thos e polls have brought the first news of a massive underwater land. If it has the proper knowledge. However, no one on board the \"Meteor\" could have understood its real mean ing, the only technical sounding the depths ... But with this, found the Atlantis. The Enigma of Eels All tangible remnants of the Atlantic sank with the i sland, placing it is therefore beyond our control and, unfortunately, the monuments do not speak. Therefore, there is still present tangible realities, comprobatórias. However, t here are other factors to which we can use evidential. Indeed, what the man has forgotten it was in memory of an animal species not evolved very far and the physical similarity with humans. The paleontologists know her well and has its origin in the Cretaceous period in the Mesoz oic era. This is the eel. European eels retain their enigma, closely related to t he island of Atlantis. Apparently, a practice seemingly senseless behavior, which, howev er, passes from generation to generation, under a compulsory instinct, hereditary. Twic e in his life crossing the immense extension of the Atlantic, they do the cross ing for the first time, are small, the size of a match, colorless, but the second crossing ar e mature, marriageable. In addition to apparent lack of meaning, this rite of pass age, which also found no reasonable ground, endangering the survival of the species, therefore, along these journeys on the high seas, years on end, the shoals of eels are exposed to a non-number of potential enemies in the much higher than that found in fresh water or shallow lakes. Therefore, all the more puzzling is the fact that the eel persist in its strange ritual, despite the enormous efforts and the dangers which that e ntails. Since the time of Aristotle, the scientific world th is puzzle of eels. However, Aristotle had been in the hands of the secret key, it gave credit to the Platonic narrative, invés.de to condemn it. That is because neither Aristotle nor any other person poster found a plausible explanation for the fact that in European rive rs, only live eel females. For now, this aquatic species has not been sufficiently obs erved and, therefore, the chances learned proliferate. It was only Johs. Schmidt who obs erved and recorded the eel migration in its maps, however, find the answer to thi s biological aspect of this instinctive behavior, incomprehensible. However, it is something to respect. The eel starts life in the underwater flora of the Sa rgasso Sea a sea of warm waters, the extent of central and located to the west-southwest of the Azores. Sargasso is the name of a brown alga of the family of Fucáceas, belon ging to the genus Sargassum, and its underwater flora, the sea well deserves its nam e. Today as formerly, since there is the Atlantic, the currents there accumulate huge plant up to 300 m in length, which accompany the movement of waves. No virgin forest, on dry land, could compete in size, freshness, abundance and plant varieties with tho se underwater jungles. Of all the backs, hit by the eddy currents slow the bodies of wrack and algae are being collected and in the center, where almost no motion and the wat er stops are, they intertwine and confuse. In this paradise of the eel sargasso celebrate its mat ing. The American eel put their eggs in the western and eastern European region in the Sa rgasso Sea. Born tiny fertilized egg being transparent, which has expressed the enigmatic migratory instinct."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" \u0000 Figure 18. Distribution of European eel, according to John S chmidt. Black spot: the spawning area - dotted area: puppies - dashed area: adult eels. Schmidt commented about: The map shows that in contrast to the eel in I ndonesia, the European eel to go a great distance to return to their region of origin, whic h it is spawning. Gradually, leave sargasso, site of his first child and s eek the edge of the eddy, where the Gulf Stream to accept these puppies into the hot, blue water, to lead them towards the east, to the remote beaches in Europe West. This trip lasts three years and in its place, the eels, at the beginning, small and transparent , to be evolving from brown- green and agile movements, as the snake as long as they could not survive and serve as food for many larger fish , for which they are hunted. Off the coast, dividing the school, then full, the males remain in salted water i n the sea and the females entering the outfall of the rivers of Europe. They ascend the ri vers, bear all natural obstacles, as well as artificial and even an occasional crossing to stand on dry land. This strange separation of the sexes lasts for two years. With fi ve years of the adult eel is, then make the separate schools to meet. Males await their females, and down the rivers, meeting, undertake the journey of marriage, back to the Sa rgasso Sea. In many gatherings, the school gathered back to the land of his childhood, deaf and blind to all the dangers around him. Notwithstanding the h ungry birds, watching them over the back and the fish and dolphins, that in pursuing hi gh seas, still in its course, swimming at great depths, perhaps taking advantage of the curr ent cold, warm under the Gulf, at antiparalelo. In any case, the eel run th is script full in relatively short time of only 140 days. Those that survive the nuptial procession , withdraw up to underwater vegetation in the Sargasso Sea where the mat ing takes place. Ali then killed the old eels and the pups born, starting a new cycle of life and death in"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" uninterrupted sequence. This cycle of life and death has two aspects incomprehe nsible. First, that this migration dangerous, complicated, crossing the ocean twice and that involves serious risks for the survival of the species? Secondly, that the female s ascend alone, the rivers of freshwater and the males remain in the ocean? The second aspect is causae solution, as the eel only b ecome adult females in freshwater. Although the details are still ignored the c hemical process by promoting these developments, there remains the fact, explained a bove, which applies a sufficient explanation, that the females go to an area where the re are large continental rivers of fresh water. However, soon another detail is incompre hensible, the West Indies would be very close to the Sargasso Sea, but despite this, th e offspring of European eels, rather than go to the west, take direction opposite to t he east, to the more distant European continent, although this route is much more danger ous and long, taking three years to complete. Presumably, the offspring of e els - is how you could argue - by instinct innate, hereditary, choose the longer path , because, due to the Gulf, is it requires less effort. By following this route, all you h ave to do is let yourself go for warm waters, seeking instinctively and blue strip of the Gulf leads them, as an excellent means of transport, fast and secure for the nearest co ntinent. This argument explains why the females prefer to the Gulf in order, brought it, take the long trip to Europe, arriving thus to your destination, fresh waters, where they become adults. However, why males should track females to expose themselves, unn ecessarily, to a number of hazard-free without to that end, there was a biological necessity, equal to the force for females? The fact that all the eels swim in the Gulf , until the females are fresh and they become adults, so insofismável proof that the desire of becoming adult is not the only motivation of the journey, as this motivation applies only to females , although lacking in direction for males. Therefore, the tendency to re ach the maturity is not of primary importance, but the eel simply have the desire to take l eave by the warm waters of the Gulf. In this respect, still explain why a strange detai l, this will is imperative, despite the great distance between the Sargasso Sea, and Europe, within easy reach, via the Gulf. And, again, the distance factor as it is decisive, and t his strongly emphasizes the second puzzle in the life of the eel. It is the contingency o f foreign females need fresh water to be adults, although the nearest continent where they ca n find it to be the great distance and the West Indies, and nearest, can not be achieved b y the Gulf Stream. Would be the case that we ask, how can it be that this strange feature of conditioning the water, was observed in a species of fish, whose pl ace of origin, the Sargasso Sea is so far from that continent, whose rivers are sought b y females, to become mature and acquire their position to spread the species? All these questions, making up the puzzle of eels, are simpl e answers, fully intelligible, studying to Figure 19, which, besides solving the problem of Atlantis, also explains the enigma of the eel, closely linked to that. The Figure outlines the Atlantic 19 West, before the disa ppearance of the island of Atlantis. The waves of the Gulf fighting against the we st coast of this island-lock, there are diverted, and its main contingent, are forced to com e into a huge whirlpool, circunvolvendo the area of the Sargasso Sea, while to the east, reach the Atlantis, sweet and rich in the west, the Central and North Ame rica, no less rich in rivers and lakes. \u0000 "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" Figure 19. The region of eels in the North Atlantic, in the Quaternary, was concentrated around the large island of Atlantis (A). Due to the movement of waters of the Gulf around the Sargasso Sea (S) from the Atlantis, this current has to be part of the living space of the female eel, as happens today wit h Western Europe and more distant. The life and behavior of eels should be understood as a s pecial and intelligent adaptation to the Gulf, surrounding the Sargasso Sea, only after the disappearance of Atlantis and the consequent solution of the continuity o f the movement of the waters of the Gulf, around the Sea the Sargasso, the behavior of the eel has become incomprehensible and enigmatic, because, by virtue of th eir instinct, are still living as if Atlantis still existed. \"The eel can not forget the A tlantis.\" This was the whirlpool of eels living space, before th e cataclysm that has brought the great flood and did it disappear, along with the island-lock. At that time, the behavior of eels was adapted to his living space. Nothing more had to do, and take leave by the maelstrom of the Gulf Stream, which carried the water for marine and freshwater, back to the sea water. Nothing estranhável a species of fi sh have chosen this vital area, offering a convenient means of transport between the sea and river and has used it to become their adult females in fresh water, easy to re ach. Who knows if both have contributed to the relatively more secure protection aga inst the sea birds that live in coastal and no more of the coastal zone and the large fish and mammals, that caçavam in high seas. Perhaps this was to safeguard the lives of females is essential for the propagation of the species. Moreover, at the time when the eels were fully adapted to his living space, their number was much higher, the point of the continental rivers have not been sufficient to ensure enough food for all school s and, thus, were reserved to females. Anyway, the truth is that the conditioning of water only makes sense and does not involve too many risks for the spread of the specie s is within the habitat of eels, sea water was as much fresh water. This condition existed, in fact, before the disappearance of the island of Atlantis, today, no longer exists and therefore the life of the eel has become enigmatic and become a problem for doctors."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" However, looking at the fig. 19, these puzzles are reveale d. The submarine thick jungles of the Sargasso Sea, surrounded by the Gulf, to prot ect the breeding of eels, fish old died there, having spread their species and then pl ayed the young, newly born. The slow, warm-water marine, took the pups around the subm erged forests of the Sargasso Sea, always ready to offer shelter and protect them against all dangers. When the young, transparent, had old enough to leave that sanct uary, that the current calm and certainly led to the river outfall near and distant, both to the west, and to the east. Here, then, was the desire of females in fresh water , which did enter the outfall, rising rivers and penetrate ever more land in Europe, where the y were safe from most enemies. Moreover, in their quality of hunting, had suffi cient conditions to defend themselves when they lose their attribute of transpar ent and were forced to fight for life. While the female swam in the river water to reach m aturity, the return was to meet with the males, they remained in marine waters, to f eel the \"call\" of females, in return, probably transmitted by the gametes, which enable cont act between the aquatic beings unimaginable distances. And then came to meet, forming t he great nuptial procession, led by the usual stream of warm water into the underwate r jungles, protective, where did the mating, followed by the spawning of death and a new beginning, completing It is, thus, their life cycle. How was practical and full of meaning such interlacing of living space and animal behavior! The coexistence of the maelstrom of the G ulf Stream underwater jungle and offered protection, both for couples in marriage, for ne wborn pups, transparent, that there could always retreat, before the approach of any threat. Then, when the eels were not required to undertake hazardous sea crossings and apparentl y meaningless, which loses much of its species, their number should have been huge. However, the life cycle of the eel came to an end with the disappearance of the ir means of transport, the eddy current in the Gulf, along with the island-lock, that ca used. And, then, was the opposite side of conditioning instinctive. The instinct not reason, nor is doutrinável. Beings ac ting on instinct can not be re- educate. Also the eels follow your instinct, as always followed, from cretaceous. Know nothing about the disappearance of Atlantis, the disruption of aquatic circle around the Sargasso Sea, but even if they knew, could not change the course of his instinctual life. Today, as formerly, the instinct tells eels, yet tra nsparent, entering the Gulf, but that will not take the jungles around the submarine, protective , but so far, across the Atlantic to distant Europe. Many puppies die on this trip. H owever, they should go to Europe because there is going to the Gulf in its route tha t before the disappearance of Atlantis was cyclical, and since then it is straight, one-way. And, therefore, also the nuptial cortege should return by the ocean, despite the eno rmous risks and losses to be faced in crossing endless. For this reason, the blind a nd deaf schools to move around it, in order, with all its strength, reaching its sanctuary , which were brought by the Gulf as soon as possible. Well this is just the place where, de ep in the jungles submerged, the school is protected against all enemies, you can pair up a nd spawn. For this purpose and to protect the young, the school undertakes the long jo urney of two crossings of the Atlantic, because the puppies are living, are ensuring the preservation of the species, and for their benefit, eels, instinctively, live and work . Thus, until today, the life of eels, in the beginning, as in his view, remai ns closely linked to their sanctuary in the Sea of Sar-tions and these last vestiges of a beh avior, once perfectly suited to environmental conditions, are still preserved at the e xpense of many, many individual losses along the ocean crossing, and return. This is th e price to be paid by the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" disappearance of the eel island of Atlantis. This would solve the puzzle of the eel, which is explain ed considering the tremendous changes in the course of time, which also demanded its t ribute of primitive harmony of life. Apparently, the eels have better memory and longe r than men. For them, their land to the east will never be lost. Each baby eels, tra nsparent, each adult eel, green-brown, gives its mute testimony to the existence of Atlantis . Atlas - Atlantis Every puzzle has a solution, as long as they could find th e key to clear it. This applies also to the puzzle surrounding the ancient and lost civili zation Atlantis, its key is the magic word: Atlantis. Atlantis, the submerged island, the ocean that bears hi s name and people of the Atlantic has a common mythical symbol, is the giant Atlas, ho lding the sky. It is only in appearance that his name distune some of the island and t he ocean, because the genitive in Greek ATXCWTOO shows the root and the comm on name of this mythical giant is the key to understanding the culture Atlantis. The passage oldest was transmitted to us in writing, the \"Odyssey\" speaks of the legendary island of Ogígia and the nymph Calypso, daughter of the giant Atlas: ... A goddess inhabits the island, shaded by trees, daughter of Atlas, that he knows everything, who knows the dark depths of the sea and that, alone, supports the columns, separating the earth and sky, but ... (51-54) The exact translation of the last line of special im portance for our case, says: \"The self, which has large columns, separating the earth and sky\", de scribing the phenomenon primitive, subsequently, transformed into the mythical s ymbol of Atlas, holding the sky. Without doubt, its origin is based on real facts. In its fourth day of travel, dedicated to the muse Melpome ne, Herodotus says about the extreme northwest tip of Africa: \"... Then, afte r ten days, a hill of salt and umajonte and there are people living around the hill. A mountain, n ame of Atlas, is approaching that hill. The mountain is narrow and rounded, they would be so high that no one can see the peak, always covered with clouds, both in the sum mer as in winter. The people of the land says that the hill would be the sky ... \"(I V, 184). It is the mountains of Atlas, a great nickname, in nor thwest Africa, with two peaks amount to 4.000m above sea level. Since the time of Polí bio, this mountain is called Atlas, for this reason the later Hellenic version o f the legend of Hercules, beyond lies the mythical giant, Atlas, so that Eros, in search o f gold to put the gardens of Hespérides, could find itself with it and live the adventur e with the known globe. It is known that the Atlas Mountains was named in the relatively late age. The people of the region called it with Dyris according Strabo, an d Daran, according to Pliny. Also, the name of the ocean, beyond the \"Pillars of Hercules\", called the Atlantic, as the island itself, is commit-vadamente older. The sea can not derive its name from the mountains in Northwest Africa. Moreover, this range a nd above, its main peak, had its name changed, for reasons easily explained. A quote from Herodotus clarifies the case. The name of the mountain was subject to its height, its involvement by clouds and their looks im pressive, considering the still strong resemblance to the original Atlas that once gav e its name to the ocean. Atlas"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" was the original name that went to the African mounta ins, where he, along with Atlantis, and everything that was on that island, sank in the sea. The proof of this is the existence of the Azores islands, the scant remains o f the old big island, submerged. Moreover, as correctly identified by Athanasius Kirche r, the nine islands are the peaks, appearing above sea level, the highest mountains in the massive ground submarine, which was once Atlantis. In one of these islands, ca lled Pico, Pico Alto, the 2,320 m, altitude respectable, dawn of the waves of the Atlantic . Estimated at about 3,000 m depth to which fell the massive ground floor submerged, the High Peak have the impressive altitude of 5,300 m, or 500 more than the Mont Bla nc, Switzerland, the highest mountain in Europe. Just imagine a mountain gigangesca, the size of Mont Blan c and find it mentally in the bluff of a subtropical island, behold, then the order tha t would have appeared before the eyes of primitive navigators of the times, to set off the coasts of the continent of wild , barbarian, east, towards the Isle of the Bless ed. The sacred mountain, born of the waves, in fact, appeared playing the celestial region s. The example of what has been said of the Atlas mountain range in northwest Afr ica, also the peak of the proto- Atlas was constantly surrounded vapor and clouds. It was th e mountain itself to expel these fumes, as well as the High Peak from today, also the Atlas of time before the time was an active volcano. Equal to that found in the main crater of Mount Etna, th e main crater of the proto- Atlas up clouds of steam, sometimes covered the peak, is n ow raised, in the form of pine, mixing with the clouds of heaven and, thus, linking t he three elements of life that are the sky, water and earth. In this respect, it is pe rfectly intelligible the mythical image, closed in odd phrase of Homer, saying that Atlas, the giant, who knows the depths of the sea, has a column that separates heaven a nd earth. Therefore, steep, abrupt, giant mountain that rises from depths of the sea, as if he had just built up far more of their funds, thus giving rise to the parable in w hich he, Atlas, appears to know the dark depths of the sea . The column of clouds, which h e designed, apparently, supports the heaven and the heaven it is based. So she, the mighty column, separating the sky from Earth. This resurges the original image, the prototype of the la ter mythical symbol. After submerged the original image, the symbol has been transf erred to the High Atlas Mountains in North Africa. Here is the explanation of the change of meanings over the ages. The island of Atlantis, whose name passed into the Atl antic Ocean, derived its name from the high mountain that dominated and characterized. And on this basis to the legend created as a parallel of Atlas, holding the sky, th e first king, Atlas, firstborn of Poseidon, god of the sea. In nahuas languages, ie the people living west of Atlantis , \"atl\" means water and, judging by the names of the peaks in the Andes, \"anti\" mea ns high mountain. Thus, it would reach the hypothetical translation of \"Mountain W ater\", \"Mountain Water has emerged,\" \"Mountain, amidst the Water\" in perfect harmon y with the real thing, especially when viewed from the east. In any case, that the mountain smoking, the crest of t he wave, stood up to the sky, whose roof supported with its column of vapor, is the rea l reason was primitive and the first bearer of the name Atlas, sent to the island a nd the ocean in around them. This found its embodiment in the original king, Atlas, and the giant of the same name, claiming the sky, materializing is, thus, both the myth ical policy, as for cosmology. However, this was only one of its many reflections, along with other, much more"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" important. It would be reasonable to assume that the At las mountains is the prototype of the pyramids and all the works of worship, multiform a nd varied, in the west and east of Atlantis, and elsewhere, where fell directly or indirectly a ray of light emitted by large submerged island. Large number of observers have not ed the unmistakable similarity, revealed by the works of worship older, the majority of so-called high civilizations of the remote past. The most representa tive structural type is the pyramid and thus talks about a \"belt of pyramids, involving China, with its pagodas of several floors, the towers of churches of Eastern tndia, situa ted on the banks of the Nile, its congeners less known in Libya as well as works megalith ic, primitive, only in its external appearance, in North West Europe, the nuragues in Sardinia, the crannoghs and brochs Ireland and Scotland, the truddhus and Trulli in P uglia, the Balearic Islands and talayots , west of the Atlantic, the Teo-calli o f Maya, Totonaca, toltecas, Aztecs and other primitive peoples Americans. All these works a re based on proto-common symbol, represented by the huge mountain, touching the sky, in which, or on which the gods reside in their homes, in their temples. The figs. 20 and 21 seek to illustrate these ancient links. The fig. 20 sketches a highly significant structural reasons, but until now poorly expla ined. All these works of worship have a starting point for a structure in several steps, shown at least in its initial phase. Tried to explain, saying that with his technique, the manufacturers former sovereign be only certain times, so it had to put a flo or on top of another in order to erect works higher. \u0000 Figure 20. Atlas, supporting the sky - as a prototype of the py ramid in steps. To judge by the general character of the volcanic islands of t he Azores, before the disappearance of Atlantis, the High Peak current must have been a vol cano in steps, consists in several successive eruptions and reaching high altitude. Th e picture, right, shows a cross section of the strata, in steps, the volcanic pit is outlined in black. The volcano in steps is the prototype works of worship, also built in st eps, which served as a model for various architectural types, adopted in India, Central America, Mesopotamia and Egypt. "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" It may be that in either case, in fact, that reason prevailed, dictated by technical constraints contemporary. But why the structure in the form of steps continued to be used when the technical progress has allowed the construc tion works high, the big? This applies especially to the pyramids of temples, the r ather obtuse, Central America, similar to hills landfill; undoubtedly would have been eas ier to site them in a straight line rather than in steps. However, despite this, it r etained the original structural form, it seems, because the real protoforma have foreseen t he release of several floors, with one over the other. This conclusion rests on the con formation of the volcano Atlas, which, moreover, consubstancializa the original form of the works of prehistoric cult. At right, the Fig 20 outlines a cross section of a volca no in steps, there are several layers of the steps, easily identifiable by different shading. Why spend your way to the exhaust pipes of volcanic products, designed in black, with t he central tube leading to the main crater at the center. On the left, Figure 20 gi ves the external view. When compared with the outline of a Central American pyramid, on terraces, such as the Pyramid of the Sun in Teotihuacan, (Board 7), the fundamen tal similarity is obvious as to hardly be taken as pure chance. Also, this comparison suggests the origin of works of worship, in overlapping steps, as linked to the prototype of the volcano in steps. And of all the volcanic mountains was the most sacred of Atlas, holding the sky, located on the island in the center of the world. The Figure 21 shows up on the scheme of reconstruction and reduction of the prototype; layers superimposed on the mountain and at its t op, the column supporting the sky. Two types derived from this prototype structure, e asily identifiable, namely the tomb of the hero, archaic, the tymbos or tumulus, late r transformed into the Templum, temple that in its line-master is the great tombs of stone, in Northwest Europe. Both the structural type as the material of construction wer e always adapted to local conditions. For this, Canto XXIII of the \"Iliad\" provi des a classic example, with its description of the funeral of Patroclus. The dead, after the addition, the abode of the gods, rests inside a mountain hollow, artificial - why? Also beyond the ocean, separating the Old World New Worl d, and that would probably be the oldest, the kings and chiefs were also b uried under hills, as happened in the East. The column of totem, a symbol in the struct ural style of the obelisk and menhir, is expressed as a manifestation of such cults, we have forgotten, and thus became incomprehensible. And, unless mistake, we make fi nding the remains of Atlantis. In troubled times, tumultuous, the articles of worship als o served in squares and such strong citadels exist, since the ancient times of the Neolithic lower. The Figure 22 shows the known \"mountain house\" in Stronegg, a village i n Lower Austria, with its layers unmistakable \"Atlantic\", congener of the pyramid of Sacara, the biblical Tower of Babel and the Pyramid of the Sun in Teotihuacan. Eve ntually, this line to continue the structural Chinese pagodas and presumably for the extre me forms of the temples in steps Dravid (Surf equipment 5 to 7). Another reason may be significant in tracing the mount ain giant, now semi-submerged, Pico Alto, the Azores, which rises above sea level and always was, and continues to be, an active volcano. Vapors rise from its crater, the fiery glow of incandescent lava in its interior reflects on the clouds, the column of smo ke, the returns, dyed red with gold target peak covered with snow. A golden light seems to inv olve the top of the volcano where, to speak in the style of times gone, inside, the deity and agree with voice of thunder, go to the dead."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" Figure 21. The architecture of worship, in steps, as evolv ed and adapted to return smaller proportions of the prototype (Fig. 20). Its symbol is the mountain structure supporting the sky, ie the mountain with the column of smo ke reaching the sky. The following architectural forms derived from this structura l type: a) the grave of hero, archaic (tumulus, or monument tymb os with this), put soil around a corridor burial, sometimes in several layers, with a column or a landmark in the center of the top (left); b) the architecture of the Christian church, evolved f rom the old tomb of a hero, the formal similarity with the \"mountain of heaven\" (fig. 20) is not always clearly identifiable, the drawing at right shows the Cathedral o f St. Sernin in Toulouse ( 1060), still showing the steps in typical form, which is t he base ( \"church\") with the celestial column (tower) on top. Even the cathedrals rise on graves. The Cathedral of S t. Peter is the landmark erected on the grave of hero \"of Peter, the prince of apostles .

However, not only the Christian churches, the mosques but also symbolize a mountain hollow and minaret next to the c olumn supporting the sky. Similarly, the pyramids, built on the sarcophagi of mummi es, they form a unit with piramidião, the point at which coverage ends, not by cha nce but by necessity. The column of smoke Atlas seems to have pointed in both the Egyptian obelisk as the Celtic menhir, North German or English, as well as t he Gothic towers of the Domes, directed towards the sky. It may not be a coincidence th at the word menhir, designating a monument consisting of a Celtic block lifte d vertically, has phonetic similarity with the word minaret.

Herodotus reports that the temple to Marduk-Bal, the peak of Etemenankis was all covered with gold."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" Figure 22.

The pyramids bearing metal crowns, and gold were the roof s, at the tip of the pagodas. The abundance of gold ornaments of the temple-pyramids of the Aztecs, led the glamor and greed of the Spanish conquerors. And even the Christia n cathedral of Milan, made this dream of a multiplicity of points of marble, has a \"peak\" golden, brilliant, the Madonnina. That the works of cult blink with the brightn ess of the red-gold metal? Because its prototype, forgotten, long, with a peak bright and visible to the great distance, was the lighthouse that night for the sailors , millennia ago, rumavam to the island of the gods, in the Atlantic, which later becam e submerged. This is not only the brightness that comes from the mountain, it also expels the smoke coming out of the crater of the volcano, and therefore these elements are also present in works of worship, based on the original image. Even i f a version of unimaginable horror, this appears in its more pure and crystalline in the temple-pyramids of the Aztecs, whose top was installed on the altar of sacri fice, whose flames consumed the offerings made to gods. In Phenicia and Carthage, the moun tain on fire \"became a\" god in flames, \"that terrible devouring monster, Moloch - or Melek, the god-king, which were sacrificed the firstborn. In the Old Testament, the altar of fire, fat and meat were burned in sacrifice to Jehovah. Carnage and again were s acrificed on altars of Greece and Rome. The Christian altar undoubtedly evolved from th e old altars of sacrifice, an offering to serve symbolic and, thus, the incense is t here to form the cloud, indicating the proximity of God and which, it seems, followed the dialogue between the divinity and fatal, since the days of Atlantis. And that strange universal symbol of ancient Europe, the universal tree, perhaps it would be a recasting of the mountain late that expels th e smoke and maintains the sky? The universe rests on his column and thin, similar to clouds, the branches and foliage spring from its trunk. This symbolism is unintelligible t o a column supporting the sky, but perfectly appropriate if it is a canopy of trees that can be only represented the starry sky. This symbol is part of the megalithic civi lization that developed there where, following the retreat of glaciation, the man of Cro-M agnon type colonized the virgin land and erected these works which, with its boulevards o f monolithic columns, leading to coastal, long sunk at sea, pointing to the west, to i ts origin, which also came from the Cro-Magnon man in red leather.

However, what is that, as languages of fire, leaving the crater of the volcano, reaching the sky and rises to the celestial s pheres?

It is a smoke esvoaçante, to the sky, which came out of the volcano, which feature a mo untain sacred mountains differs from other common, extinct, or dormant, and it gives di vine dignity. In the New World, the feather serpent is the symbol of the univer sal god, the legend itself to how it came to the continent, from Tlitlán-Tlapallán, an is land in the sea, east of America. Thus, it would be fair to say that the god, which is onl y known as the presumed helenizado name of Atlas (or better, \"Atlants\") was the owner of the four elements, namely water, from which sprouted its giant body, the la nd, which stands divinely; air, cut on his column of smoke, holding the sky, the fire, wh ich was his own part truly, supernatural. If, at any time, a primitive people were mo tivated to believe in a universal god, then it would have been to Atlantis. We do not know that the oldest civilization. Therefore, it would justify the assumption that ancient monotheism, considered by many researchers from Prehistory to the oldest form of divine faith, be part of the heritage of Atlantis. The ancient god seems to have been a deity of fire, he managed the thunder as their weapon more terrible. With thunder, Zeus and the giants w on Tor and Titans, Marduk defeated Tiamat. However, originally, the thunder was no t understood as the thunder preceded by lightning, but as the Belemnite, destroy the s tone that falls from the sky and is precipitated on the Earth, which opens up huge holes in the ground, cause terrible fire, uproot trees, finally, the meteorite, or one of lapilli, are designed as the volcanoes in eruption. Presumably, in prehistoric times was not difference between one and another. Until today, a meteorite the size larger, fell from the sky in ancient times and embedded in Caaba, remains the center of worship of the cult in Mecca, and antedate far, Islam. The Magna Mater of Pessini was a meteor. Was always regarded as sent by divine hand all that the sky is precipitated o n the Earth and, therefore, the pumps were not less cosmic venerated the land. Only a god tremendously powerful, terrible, could make use of such horrific weapons with th em and beat the enemies. A God able to throw stones giant and, thus, requires its ve neration, requires sacrifices, without regard to human life. This concept, incompatible with the ideal kind of father, the volcano god, whose body is a giant mountain of thunder ing, boiling, casting fire and Belemnite. Also But this idea is also consistent w ith the consequent demand for good graces that God angry, mad, inescrutáveis of deliberat ions, to which sacrifices are offered before, so that it will require them. Therefor e, from earliest times, the ritual of human sacrifice offered by the deity is identical with the proceeding of the god of fire, the victims are killed as if they were hit by thunder a nd calcined or a river of lava . Can hardly be doubt about the former altar of sacrifice by fire have the model and prototype their sacred mountain, in flames, causing seassimo-awful ritual of animal and human sacrifice by fire. To some, it is not by chance that Atlantis is locat ed in the center of this belt of horrors, externally identifiable by their pyramids and similar w orks, which involves extending almost across the globe.

Everywhere, where human skin of red, brown, worship their gods in temples of steps, or pyramids, there were sacrifices, in which the victims were consumed by fire.

The latest surveys provide mapping data for the Atlantic de pths, in continuous sequence and track apparently correct.

Therefore, the cold water brought by arctic currents should have come very close to the nor thern area of the island, but the high mountains located there capturing and accepted the stor ms, rain and snow, for example, as today, the Alps, the Europe's largest mountain range, protecting the south of the continent against the weather Northern Europe.

So where possibl e, in a case so complicated and complex underwater recovery, the paths of the deep confir m the story so impressive as to the text and image transmitting a very clear idea of the physical aspects of the island large, submerged long . The island of Atlantis was the antediluvian blockade of the Gulf. By virtue of this effect in the sea and, thus, indirectly, on climate diluvial No rthwest Europe, there was proof of its existence antediluvian. Indeed, the island functio ned as a huge block, located in the exact place, the key point. In the Gulf beat against the west coast bays. Ali the seabed slope down into softer than the east, where the continental plate is abruptly cut a nd the ridges are steep rise like a wall, impossible to climb. On the other hand, there w here the vast plains extending up to the beaches, gently dipping in the sea, there were al l conditions for a prehistoric paradise. Incessantly, to the Gulf had its warm waters, blue, sa lt, involving the whole coast in a fresh pack from mild climate and humidity. Its waters must have had about the same temperature of the sea, this tropical region, hot and we t, open only to so-and south west winds, in this blessed land, inhabited by beings ea ger for sun and heat. And despite this, the weather was not-as tropical, subtr opical, but Pical, warm, not hot enough. Thus, there was the freshness, cold waters from the north and that, even diminished, penetrated by high mountains. In northern and northeastern flanks of the island, the moisture condensed in the cold air rising, pre cipitate as rain, snow and ice. Here, the Gulf, diverted on the west coast, moving nort h toward the isotherms, the Arctic, where the ice floating down to the Sule current s of cold water reached the northern tip of the island. This explains the gathering inormal of isotherms, as an expression of extreme change in climate that Jentro o f only 15 moves parallel to the amenity subtropical cold polar. The cold-water currents in the northern coast intensi fied the 'actors of cold air, bringing snow and rain, accumulating it in the peak amount a nhas higher, and thus forming its glaciers. These glaciers have left the íguas of melting, forming rivers that with the arrival of the wind and heat, and fell Engros- Laramara the strands. Nascentes blossomed soil. Its clear waters jumped from rock to roc k, built up in forests, and to reach the valleys, extended up to large and small rivers. This framework orographic and hydrographic, extremely positive, resulting from the ge ographical situation and climate of the island, provided by the combination of t he effects of the Gulf Stream and the cold arctic waters. Also give these details with w hat the informants of Plato counted on Attica, through traditions, faithfully preserve d through the millennia: \"... In particular, also the rain was very beneficial to the soil, throughout the year. Yeah, unlike now, the water does not penetrate the ground lost to the cold, but the rich soil absorbed the rain and kept the water in its b ottom clay, letting it drip from heights to the valleys, thus allowing the existence of abundant springs and rivers ...

(The Grand Canal) ... absorbed the rivers, down the mountain ... \" Idea to make the table climate of the island of Atlant is, observe the graph of the isotherms in the region, according to fig. 24, showing it in scale of 1:20 million. The contours of the island are outlined in black, continuous l ine, left sectionals lines indicate the isotherms, arranged at intervals of 5 of t emperature. Starting on the left, initially, the isotherms follow, parallel to the Gulf , was diverted to the north the high mountains. Congestion hot wind, west, in western falda, wind causes the isotherms, while characterizing the colder regions, towards north. This wind, in very small scale, is the \"bag of gifts\", today brought by the Gulf for thous ands of miles in west- northwesterly direction, to Norway. Behind the island, the isotherms fall sharply, slightly below remain in the general direction of east -west parallel. This characterizes the tortuosity unilaterally privileged climate of the is land-lock, by the Gulf Stream. As conditions change, the ancient Atlantis was even more privileged as the Islands of Hawaii today, and therefore superior to them (Fig. 24). The isotherms show the influence of the Gulf dammed and diverted for their way back in the distribution of average temperature. The island re tains the heat. In its western regions, air and water was extremely hot and in easter n areas, the temperature was normal and therefore more fresh. The counters north, entering the cold waters and could have had the climate of Patagonia. Indeed, this isl and of temperatures varied as much seems to have assembled on its surface, relativel y small, all types of weather, from the sub-boreal to tropical. The richness of life forms, the abundance and diversity of flora and fauna should be matched to those huge climate changes, so is what motivated Plato said about them: \"... In ancient times, when the soil was still virgi n, the high mountains, covered with earth and the plains, sometimes called floor of stone, were of fertile land in the mountains, the forests were dense ... Soil also had ma ny fruit trees and pasture for livestock offered sick ...

In additi on to extensive pasture for all animals that live in swamps, in lakes, in lakes, both in mountains and in the plains was too tired to sustain that kind which, by its nature, is the largest in size and consume greater quantities of food. Also, the island was perfectly maintained and all that the earth produces aromatic, were roots, herbs, trees, resins, flowers or fruits. Also produced the sweet fruit and nut, which serves the food, and all others for our plates of food, which generally call for vegetables and fruit that grows like a tree and provides dri nks, food and oil for anointing. Still gave the fruit of orchard, difficult mai ntenance, created for our entertainment and our recreation, plus all the fruit for dessert to be served to whet the appetites of people saciados already tired to eat.

Isotherms on the map of Atlantis (scale of 1:20. 000.000). In the Gulf, from the west, caused the decrease of the distance between t he isotherms and the establishment of a \"bag of gifts\", a climate, the type that with which today benefits the North West Europe. In Atlantis, the air temperature var ied from fresh, moderate (annual average, 10 ° C positive), and tropical, humid, warm (annual mean, 25 ° C positive). At that time, the island of Atlantis, bloc king the Gulf Stream, the climate was more favorable under the Atlantic. With this privileged climate, nature spread their donations truly paradise with an abundance, which in turn produced a civilization far superior to the local existing continents and climatica lly less favored. If I were to suspect that in the free flight of his unb ridled imagination, the poet would have created a paradise of dreams, fictional, just look a t Figure 24, the mixed-esque isotherms of Atlantis and subject to control in all i ts details, to verify that this paradise fits perfectly with the topography of that island, once divine, beautiful, wonderful and has long been submerged. Mount Atlas and perhaps all of the ten highest peaks are a ctive volcanoes. Certainly much longer expel lava at the time of the lower Tertia ry period, the lava descended from falda, in rivers of liquid fire and flooded the great plains in the west, covering it with a thick layer, as has happened in many other places around the globe. The decomposed bodies of lava formed clay layers of quartzite, highly fertile, similar to the sandy-clay loam; contain large resources of minerals a nd almost everything about the plants require for their growth.

Apparently, in addition to large reserves of minerals, the products of erosion of volcanic lavas also contain spec ial substances which stimulate the flora; give a good crop land, as can be seen in Hegya lja, Hungary, and in the vicinity of Vesuvius and Etna. Nowhere in the vegetatio n is so lush, the flowers exude perfume is so stunning and so delicious taste of fruit, as the land covering an ancient volcanic soil. The wines of Hungary, Sicily and Naples are there to attest the quality of that particular mold, born of extinct land fires. Atlantis was also a volcanic country. A volcano was his god. Volcanic, very fertile, it was his land of lava. Activity in volcanoes expel water vapor and carbon diox ide, the two substances composing the hydrocarbon content in the plant body. The more humid the air, the more dense its \"shell of carbon dioxide, both faster gr owth and more intensive the production of oil. Carbon dioxide enhances the scent of flowers, the fruit increases and multiplies the crops. The presence of the Atlas, in combination with clima te parasidíaco, explains the enormous fertility of that island, which by some crit ics, is considered the imaginary or grossly exaggerated. Indeed, were the two bits to cause he ated exchange of arguments and counter-arguments, namely the fruit \"pleasant\" and the fruit that grows, like a tree and provides drinks, food and oil for anointing. But also in this respect, the credibility of the Platonic narrative can be tested and confirmed. What would be the fruit \"pleasant\"? There could be the gra pe, which the god Dionysus was the first to make wine, as Plato would have used for both the word Greek, in the current season. Neither was a traditional cereals such as millet, barley, wheat, which are mentioned then. Similarly it could not have been a kind of fruit of good flavor, are also cited as the fruit of difficult conservation. Howe ver, the term fruit \"nice\" seems to define something more pleasant to the fruit, but of a mo re nutritious and higher maintenance. It would have been a banana? Kuntze was o f the opinion that during the Quaternary, was cultivated to wild banana, Musa paradisiac al to obtain, or Musa sapientium in the same way as now form the seedless ba nana plantations. The climate for this plant, which needs a lot of heat, were found i n west of Atlantis. Mainly because, there, in the region of the isotherms of 20 ° to 25 ° and thanks to the Gulf, dams on the coast, the temperature oscillations were a lmost zero throughout the year, which added a much humidity and heat, is a major requirement s prior to the development of banana. Easily larger than the fruit \"pleasant\", the tree can be identified undefined, providing drinks, food and oil for anointing. Can only have been t he coconut (Cocos nucifera), also a typical tropical plant and very sensitive to tem perature falls below the average required. Today, the coconut is no more known in the worl d of classical antiquity, probably, there no longer existed at the time of Plato , why neither he nor the Egyptian priest to have the name of plant the coasts of Africa and South Asia, however, did not exceed the region of Guinea. Where there were condition s for the growth of banana was also the coconut, and southwest of Grand Isle offer ed such circumstances, the example of how, today, exist in the West Indies. Where the leaves of palm taste of rock the tropical br eeze and proliferate bananas, can not miss the bamboo grass and other species of hot coun tries, whose shoots are the favorite dish of the pachyderm. Perhaps, the mangroves, as there are in the Amazon River delta, formed their gigantic roots loose from the profusion of plant pa- chandeliers. In this symphony in green, the orchids aro se as colored spots, bright, and"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" this motley scene, tropical, also included the rhinos a nd crocodiles. Of course, there were also elephants. Today, the elephants still be only in India and in cent ral Africa. However, Herodotus confirms that, over time, there were still elephants in north-west Africa: \"... This land (of maxias) and the other land of Libya , towards the west, have much more extensive forests and wild animals in many more people that pastors, because the western region of Libya, where are the nomads, has al most no elevation of the land which is flat and sandy to Rio Triton. However, from there, toward the west, the country of farmers has many mountains, forests and abun dance of wild animals. There is snakes, lions, elephants, bears, horned asp and donkeys ... \"(II, 191). Moreover, the Quaternary period was the golden era of th e giant mammals, now extinct, or in the process of extinction. South Ameri ca had the Mastodons, in Europe the old elephant, a species of mammoth, as well as oth er varieties. Strictly speaking, there is no argument against the weight of obvious assumpt ion that, in that large island, climate so varied, and elephants, presumably, the species Elefas africanus, had lived more ancient species such as the Mastodons in the humid coastal his Southwest- tropical, with tapirs and hippos, rhinos and other variet ies of that family, once numerous. Moreover, what, compared with the climatology and the gradual penetration of scientific pre-historical events, is a t present as very feasible and reasonable, the Egyptians and Greeks of classical antiqui ty and must have seemed quite out of range, unusual because they no knew about the elephan t in India and could not have stopped believing that to speak with Plato: \"... tha t kind which, by its nature, is the largest in size and consumes larger amount of food\" e xist only in so - \"Libya.\" The contingency of this animal live in a place far away f rom there on an island in the sea world, to them before should have seemed more like fabulo us, as worthy of credit. However, despite its low credibility, this detail into the tradition, and could hardly have been invented by the free will of Plato. People Atlântida What is known of the man who, in the lower Quaternary , lived under the Atlantic Ocean? It is just what it is known. In the western perimeter missing completely authentic f indings of bones. Can only assume but not prove nor deny that past, as today, there lived people of red skin, called the Indians, perhaps, like the Caribbean, and Guatemalan Mayans. Also in Northwest Africa virtually nothing was found, so only left to spec ulate that in the Quaternary, was inhabited by peoples of Mediterranean race, perhaps simil ar to the old Libyan, the Berbers of the contemporary era, or the Guanches, ext inct. These men would be similar to Indians across the Atlantic, at least as far as to resemble Hamit the northeast of Africa, whose land they are very close. In summary, the average type of men presents strong profi le track, aquiline nose, high forehead, pulled back, with panache, black hair, smooth. T he modern Indian shares these characteristics with their Mayan ancestors, a s shown in numerous reliefs, so it must be permanent features of a human race. This is a b ridge built on the ocean, leading to the world and the oldest cave paintings in Spain and west of France and thus is of particular importance for our subject. These cave paintings do not portray the man in the same way as realistic show the contempora ry fauna, but enhance and"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" overvalue in expressionist style, characteristics, pro bably those considered by the artist and features specifically as \"beautiful.\" In these paintings the men are always high, strong, musc ular, runners and hunters of dark red skin, and probably, as in fact were. There are good reasons to give the Cro-Magnon, people of non-European origin, the oldest and at the same time, more artistically impress ive paintings of Europe. Already been mentioned elsewhere that, in all likelihood, thes e people suddenly appeared to have come to Western Europe presumably the island of Atl antis, or through this island. In this regard, it remains to verify the accuracy of t he theory of Lewis Spence, assuming a series of migratory waves, which have been responsible for the early colonization of Western Europe by individuals of differen t types of man of Neandertal. With the small number of relevant findings would also be permissible to suppose that those settlers were not tribal or nomadic peoples, but organized in the hunting expeditions, which left the island's large, highly civil ized, and visited the vast virgin forests of Europe, so barbaric and wild, like how the cur rent hunters visit Alaska or undertake safaris in Africa. Anyway, the sort of Cro-Magnon is clearly distinguishes the type of Neandertal or Aurignac, who was the head man of the old Europe. With th eir superior weapons, forced the withdrawal of those primitive people to the a lpine regions and its gradual extinction. The latest, after the cata-clismo of At lantis, or at the time of transition for the five-Quaternary tenário, the man of Cro-Magnon, c oming from the west, colonized Europe. Moreover, there are good reasons to consider it as the ancestor of a Nordic race, called the second region of Dalarna (Dalecarlia) , Sweden. Thus, various elements can be used to attempt to reconstitute the Atlantic, des pite the regrettable lack of positive data. The Board 8 demonstrates this attempt at recovery, but w ithout claiming to give the portrait of those human types. Even the skull of Cro-Magn on can only give the bone contours, so all the more to replenish the face was de signed, with some arbitrariness, even looking to adopt the best of the criteria. Our revi ew does not give the details with the sharpness desirable, but conveys a vivid picture of w hat that would be transmitted by simple reproduction of the skull. If a specific term fo r this people, to serve as a label pre-historical, anthropological, would be the proto-Indian American. The Cro-Magnon type is similar to the more modern type of Indian as an y other types of human, for both, just look at the face of \"Sitting Buli\" (Sitting B ull), on the side. The proto-Indian and the man of Cro-Magnon? This associ ation of ideas will certainly be challenged by anthropologists. As a counter-argument, t he following is a quote from a text, examined and approved by experts in the fiel d, taken from the book by Herbert Wendt \"Sucht ADAM ICH\" - \"In Search of Adam\" ( Melhoramentos Editions, 1965): \"In seventy years that have passed since that Chester Stock reflected on the footprints found in Carson City, were discovered several human bone s and traces of civilizations in the entire American continent, from Minnesota to the Strait of Magellan. All these proto-Indians were of the type Homo sapiens, have the c haracteristics of the man of Cro-Magnon, mixed with Mongoloid features and Indians. Its age can be determined with considerable accuracy, thanks to the method of radi ocarbon and test the fluoride. None of the skeletons lay for more of twelve millenn ia in American land ... \" Undoubtedly, these proto-contemporary American Indians we re the last of them"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" certainly descend Atlantic and the most recent races o f Indians. Of both - of the Atlantic type of Cro-Magnon and modern Indians - they ha ve somatic characters as you continue to certify their bones, so must have repre sented an intermediate type between the Cro-Magnon, found in Europe, and the Indians o f the Americas. Thus, the findings of the bones are close ethnic hypothetical ci rcle that could be explained as involving a prehistoric Atlantis, its supposed center, wh ose inhabitants, then the owners of the world, have brought their influence to th e continents of the Old and New world where, without the use of force, but only by its settlers and pioneers, they would spread their consanguineous Atlântida heritage, common to all these guys human. And as the second witness of the cave paintings, these men of Cro-Magnon were brown skin, reddish, it can consider them as the prototypes of ndio American. The skin brown, red, is an indelible feature of the Indi an, person of blood type, muscular, athletic, in constant motion. Therefore, it sxplica the symbolic meaning of red among the ancients pritimivos, inhabitants of the pyramids and the belt marked by the influence of primitive civilization Atlantis. Her e are some examples, taken at random, to illustrate this point. Until now, the still red as the color of the imperial emblems, real, of princes and cardinals. The images of gods and triunfadores were painted in red. The ancient Egyptians preferred the red tones in makeup-living, as demons trated by the statue of Ranofer (IV Dynasty). The purple is the color adopted by the Church for their great celebrations. Always and invariably, the color of bl ood is linked to the concept of supreme power, the triumph and glory. That color would be a never forgotten memory of the ancient rulers of the world, the red-skins of At lantis? These red-skins would be the \"first men\"? This was the explanation of the name of the first man, Adam, meaning \"red\", the first example of th e land is called Adamah, red? Incidentally, today is to explain the Bible verse that reads: \"It was huge at that time on earth ... and powerful men who were long famous.\" (Gen. 6.4). In fact there might be giant men? Faria Meganlhropus ref erence to this verse, of which a fragment of lower jaw with three teeth, was found in Java, however, allow for the completion of a certain primitive man, or a giant ape, like the Gigantopithecus, sizes further or the African Paranthropus crassidens? Moreover, we need not penetrate so deep in the shadows o f primitive times, to realize that those were \"giants ... and powerful men who were l ong famous.\" Just compare the reconstitution of the proven and guaranteed to Cro-Magnon man and the man of Neandertal to understand this strange biblical verse. Figure 25 outlines the three bones in the same scale. On the left we have the man of Neandertal, antediluvian, in the center, an Australian original, recent, as representative of a normal type of primitive man, right, the man of C ro-Magnon. The man of Neandertal, European, on average, less than 1.60 m tall, w as a dwarf, stocky body, bony, in comparison, of the Cro-Magnon, nothing less b ony, but going from 2 m height, was a true giant, like the biblical Goliath, kil led by David with the sling shot. Thus, in fig. 25 shows on the left, the midget history, t he man of Neandertal and to the right, the giant, also history, the man of Cro-Magnon. Therefore, leads to the conclusion that the old tales and legends of giants and dwa rfs have real basic, like how almost all the myths have. It is usually considered the man of Neandertal as a seco ndary branch of the tree of"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" humanity contemporary, dating to its origin from 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. The broadly, this could be true, as would also correct the as sumption that the man of Cro- Magnon types and Aurignac, emerged in the last stages of gla ciation, already considered the type sapiens, were responsible for their extinction. However, in this case, it accepted a temporary coexistence of \"dwarf\" an d \"Giant.\" It will, however, that there was never a mixture of races? It is supposed that the last refuge of the man-type primitive Europe were the Alpine redoubt in central Europe, and there will not be retained something of their characters hereditary? So surreptitiously, the man of Neandertal survives in their descendants, the example of how the fairy tale speaks of the dwarves, live in caves, hollow mountains and lived there the ancient hunters of bears, which, despite its nickname anthropological, were men of truth, which, over time and with their way of life, more primitive, have the equivalent knowledge and wisdom of men classified as \"sapiens.\" These two human diluvial were contemporaries and competitors, but the men of the type of Cro-Magnon t ook advantage of the Neandertal, not only for its highest stature, but also by carrying weapons and more sophisticated and deadly.

Can hardly pass un noticed by the marked indignation with the cultural biases of the then owners of the wo rld, which, according to the legends of the flood, led to the angry gods terrible punishm ent, which punished that primitive part of humanity that, by arrogance and pervers ity , transgressed the laws, governing the condition of land and, therefore, deserves to be punished. Also the Bible speaks about: \"God, it was great seeing the malice of men on earth a nd that all thoughts of his heart were continuously applied to evil, repent of having made ma n on earth. And touched the intimate pain of heart, said : Exterminate the fa ce of the man who created the earth, from man to animals, from reptiles to the birds of he aven, because I have done the heavy. \" (Gen. 6, 5-7) The deluge that, in large part, destroyed the world back the n, was the punishment for such their owners, the giants of Atlantis. They were the \"powerful and long famous\" that subjugated all the peoples around you. Apparently, it was not by chance that the people of Atl antis back to its origin to the giant Atlas, who regarded as his god-father, for them, th eir gigantic stature should have been proof of his foreign descent divine. It is in deed strange that in all the old legends, the giant talking, except for distortions, dating f rom later times, they appear as bearers of civilization. A giant built the castles of the Nordic gods, because they would not have met the necessary conditions for both. The mammoth document works of antiquity are pre-assigned or giants, or Poseidon, which i s not only the god of the sea, but is still called \"what makes the earth shake,\" which is a very clear indication of their relationship physical with Atlas-volcano. In one way or another, every culture, every civilization in the fire, a god in flames. Vulcano is older than Jupiter, Tvastr older than Indra or Brahma, Ptah older than Osiris, Loki older tha n Odin. And the auxiliary that God is the original iron-ros-giant, the Cyclops, the dem igod of enormous physical strength and offspring unreported, which flout all deities. In the \"Odyssey\" are called sons of Poseidon, are anthropophagi and only losers are the low cunning of men, weak, postdiluvial. They, the Cyclops, throw huge stones against their enemies, who killed with their maces pesadíssimas, their huge hammers of st one, struggling with their huge spears and, moreover, threatened, often, the power of t he Olympic gods. These legends, when surveyed on their reasons, throw some ligh t on those times remotíssimos, when the Giants dominated the Earth, unt il it drowned in the flood waters. A comparison of Bible verses with the Platonic tale, concerning the reasons for the annihilation of humanity antediluvian, shows that an a greement could hardly be pure coincidence. Cites as motivation of perversity is the gradual loss of divine inheritance, his constant wear, \"because the children of God had tra de with the daughters of men\" (Gen. 6.4).

In any way could be found in the languages of the Indo-European language family , which for this season came in too late, rather, is the fractional language, erratic, are not in any conventional language of schemes.

Possibly it is people s relatives. For our case, the Basque language is of particular importance have been discov ered by a certain similarity between the Basque and some Siberian languages . Thus, modern nomads, living in the Peninsula Chuckchi in the extreme norther n tip of Asia, speaking a language that in some aspects, remember the Basque. And, i n turn, the language of these nomads, whose shot is the animal of reindeer, a ppears to be some kinship with extinct languages of Mediterranean peoples, prehistoric an d early history of, including living in Asia Minor. The following conjecture, perfect ly plausible, is advocated by von Natzmer: \"... in the remote valleys of the Pyrenees , and that remote peninsula of Siberia ... were kept some last vestiges of a Southern- European language, the era of glaciation. .. \" "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" 9 board. Types of Aurignac in Europe and Easter Island? The girl's head, the left is the design of a sculpture in ivory, the genuine kind of Aurignac ( place of discovery: Unterwisternitz, Moravia, Slovakia, Tchecoslová). In their characteristics (low forehead, protruding part of the eye, long nose, small mout h, chin strongly profiled, head long, thin face) is similar, markedly, the type (ri ght) of foreign \"head of ancestors,\" on Easter Island (Rapanui). Nobody knows tha t time, before the time, those monuments datariam enigmatic and why the symbols of Easter Island's written recall the characters of Mohenjo-daro (India). Would be the influence of a glacial civilization, spread across the globe? The philologist von Natzmer motivate this hypothesis w ith extensive migration, continued for centuries, the people of that time hunters. Of course, their territories of hunting came up with frequency, following the change of the various stages of glaciation. Thus, according to von Natzmer, some nomads have advanced to Siberia, while others have found temporary asylum in the Pyrenee s. As a comple-tion, it can add this question: why not also have found refuge in the va lleys of the Caucasus, similar to Auckland? Certainly, FINCK had good reason to classify the Basque language among cau-Casian. Moreover, he says verbatim: \"All these languages and dialects South Caucasian are rela ted to the language of the ancient Iberians, who in times of Herodotus certainly was still fairly uniform. However, the mingrélios and Laso, who also speak a language South ca uca-Sian, are considered and rightly, as descendants of former cólquicos. However, this does not exclude the contingency, in ancient times, they exchanged their ow n language by ibérico.

In this case the evolution difficult it could be processed differently than assumed here ... \" With these explanations etymology of a reputation, some data contained in the book \"SHADOW OF ATLANTIS\" - Shadow of Atlantis - by A. Br a-Ghini, gain weight. However, the Basque language has many roots and words that exactly match the Georgian language. In this work, the author of: \"Presence of the fact that a former Russian official of Georgian descent, was able to understand is the people of the region, soon after their arrival in northern Spain. He spoke in Georgian, but the Basques and the felt .. . A. Braghin account other things, that the Basque have a striking similarity with the Japanese. Could well be because the ancestral trunk of th e Japanese modern Mongoloid origin be tungúsia and in their migration to the East, certainly came into contact with the nomads, who used the animal as the re indeer shot. Also, the Turkmens and ugrofínicos were also relatives and neighbors of tungueses. Considering also that, according FINCK the lesser-known languages of the peoples of pre-ancient Mediterranean were also part of the circle of kinship, further away from the original Basque, the language of the oldest indigenous tribe italic, called Osco, identical with ausci, Vasconia , suddenly comes across an extensive fa mily linguistics, branched through time and space. The Basque, the erratic stranger a mong European languages, suddenly emerge as a last vestige of universal language, pre- historical, universal language and also across the Atlantic. A. Braghin talk ab out their experiences: \"In Guatemala I heard often from a Indian tribe, which inhabits the district of Petén in the north of the country. This tribe speaks a language si milar to the Basque and I know if a Basque missionary sermons delivered there in their mother tongue, which were perfectly well understood and accepted. \" FINCK Second, the language of the natives, the lacandôni os that inhabit the district of Petén is an ancient language used only by fragments a few hundred people. And again is an indication of the remote past. Furthermore, by s trange coincidence, this hypothesis has been supported by a report, cited by C. W. Ceram, in his book \"GOETTER, GRAEBER UND GE-Lehrte\" - Gods Tombs and Wis e (Melhoramentos Editions, 1974): \"In 1947, an expedition led by Giles Grevillea Healy left for Bonamia-pak, in Chiapas (Petén) ... Once more were eleven stately temples of Old Kingdom, which may be dated from the period just prior to the emigration .. . Ho wever, this time finding the miracle by Healy in the jungles were the cave paintings ... \" Healy made the photo a couple of these before Lacandona paintings, his face has emerged as a true copy of the profile of a Maya king, portr ayed in the painting. Through many centuries, kept up the characteristics of the people endangered, not only in language but also in the face of lacandônios and custom s, which are of ancient date. Will, once the Atlantic would be like the modern lacandô nios?"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" Petén is not far from Tula, Mexico. There lives a tr ibe of indigenous Otomí also interesting, and whose language Braghin writes: \"These Indians speak the ancient Japanese and when the a mbassador of Japan in Mexico there was a visit, talked with them in that an cient dialect ...\" This relationship between language comes close linguistic circle in a way surprising, unexpected. If the Japanese is cognate with the Georgia-G iano, for its ancient tunguses components and Georgia, through its parent, the Basque, wit h the Guatemalan then not surprising the fact that Otomí, linked to the Guatema lans, understand the ancient Japanese. So, all these languages, related to each other , should be based on a universal language of ancient date. Fester was especially Richard who, in his book \"EISZEI T WAR DIE GANZ ANDERS - The Era of glaciations was completely different (1973), researched the archetypes of the primitive human language. He studied the basic seis.pala vras, Ba, Kall, That, The, ASQ, Tag, with modifications to its speech and its mean ing and, in the course of this work, has to coordinate many languages. That his work of recognized value, Fester reverted to the idea, formulated by von Humboldt, establi shing basic relationship between stem 125 languages, spoken around the globe, which cla ssified according to their degree of \"kinship.\" Supposed that, as the Professor said. Liebermann, the ma n of Neander-tal had not yet pharynx, and therefore was not able to articulate a co mplete language, the man of Cro- Magnon was already evolved to the point of being able to speak a language, which would explain its general supremacy and tactics on the fir st. However, if so, then the top center of an evolving language should also be sought bet ween the representatives of the type of Cro-Magnon. Language is a protocol of time before the time, there i s a fundamental program, uniform, approved by Paleolingística, which includes all m odern languages, and meanwhile extinct. The Basque, language of ancient Iberians, seems to be th e next of kin that ancient universal language, today only indirectly visible because ultimately all the similarities mentioned, and partly extremely surprising, etão linked to the Basque primitive that either is its root and serves as a mediator. Until to day, the Basques are still living in Spain and southern France. Probably there are since ti me immemorial. According express statement of Plato, that part of Europe was in the kingdom Atlantis. On European soil, the Basques were the closest neighbors of Atlantis; them there are still survivors. It can say that there exists a trace left by Atlantis? One reason for this conjecture has been presented by t he Basques, who still retain a clear and accurate memory of Atlantis. In this regard, we have the report of Ernst von Salomon, in his travel book \"The German in France.\" There, the year of 1930, Salomon met in St.-Jean-de-Luz a king of the smugglers, he was Basque, the aquiline nose and spoke of his people: \"The Basque people are more educated, more proud and more free of the Earth and even today, retain their way of being, as described in Titus, still wearing the same clothes, use the same knives and cultivate their fields, as always the cultivars. None of them betray their way of life, yet all speak their la nguage, the oldest in the world. \" And interviewed by Salomon continues saying: \"The Basques are the last survivors of a"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" world more beautiful, more free, more proud to have been gone along with the island of Atlantis, the Pyrenees are one of the last pillar s of that world, the other pillars are the mountains of Morocco ... \" If it is true what the Basque spoke, then across the kingdo m Atlantis in America, it should find something similar. Yes, there is this analo gy, and emerge in the form of some identities quite significant. Until today the Basques, of beak, bearing the profile of the ancient Maya \"on the other side\" (Surf equipment 10, 11) and lacandônios Indians, descendant s of his most pure race. And, according Boudoin (based on Braghin) profile tha t is recorded in an old stone in selling French, visible only when the tide i s low. Another feature is identical in agriculture. As correctl y reported by Salomon and susceptible of proof, to the present practice the Basques a very old-fashioned cultivar of the field. They do not use plow, but the \"layas\", sti cks of two points, in the form of a fork, which bite the earth, releasing it, like how do es the gardener in your garden, then put it seeds. This practice certainly is strange in a country that since millennia, is the plow and the methods of extensive agriculture. But it seems even more strange coincidence that the way to plow the ground be found, too, among the Indians of Central America, which also use the \"layas\" and cultiv ate the land using methods practiced in the ancient Mayan kingdom. In this regard, C. W. Ceram writes: \"Throughout its entire history, the Maya made their agri culture using the most rudimentary. The farming was done with a planting stick. T hey do the following: In the area of jungle, all the trees were torn down in After dry the wood just before the start of the rainy season, there were a fire. Soon after the rains, pegavam long and pointed sticks to loosen the earth and every open hole with th e stick then damaged a few grains of corn ... \" Right and left Atlantic in regions separated by a distanc e of 8.000km, remains one and same method agriculture! In view of this perhaps would be a llowed to assume that on an island, situated in the middle of the road, it would hav e been charged this selfsame method, as there in that island and the conditions for agriculture were standardized and more favorable than in continents on both sides of t he Atlantic , perhaps there where people have civilized continental less learned to plow t he land in Atlantis, the island located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. In this s equence of ideas meets mention the fact that what the Maya lands, covered with jungles , did not give the desired results, must have given abundant harvests in the Atlant ic plains, well ventilated, well irrigated and fertilized with the sludge, deposited there by the rivers down the mountains. With the Basques, the ancient method of drawi ng up the land with the stick from both ends, the agricultural tool Atlantis provides s atisfactory results to this day, therefore, there is also fertile plains, very suitabl e for agriculture. Hondurans in the jungles of the Andes, this method could not work out, and th is, the Mayan people had to abandon its splendid cities, which have died of hunger a nd always go in search of new lands, to ensure their livelihood. Finally, the \"basque pelota, the Basque national game, is yet another revealing identities of those traits here and there. In this re spect, Salomon writes: \"The rules of this game are the simplest possible and im aginable, however it requires the most skill imaginable. In each wall, the children play the pellet and walls of the"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" churches there is a warning 'pelota banned' - banned play ing pelota.

The followi ng is part of the historical work of Eduard Stucken, \"DIE WEISSEN GOETTER\" - The Gods W hite, describing a favorite game of high Mexican aristocracy: \"The rules of the game the ball was extremely grotesque. Rubber balls, red, blue and yellow, the size of an apple, were released to the air with a racquet, strips of leather count, ending in the form of a horseshoe. Only the mos t skillful of players managed to make the ball go through the opening in the stone, after the ball had crossed the opening in the stone, the opponent had to catch it and re turn it without much use for the arms or hands, but the shoulders the head, the hips o r the buttocks. time or another, the ball was in the buttocks buttocks, and in t heir positions rather odd, players remembered leaping frogs or monkeys ... \" For you see, the former Mexico invented some changes t o make the game more sophisticated, but, moreover it was the same as far as the right to the left of the Atlantic. Did the kings and nobles from the Island of At lantis has played a pellet, ten millennia ago, the example of the Emperor as the Mon-t ezuma played in times of Hernando Cortes, and the Basques continue to play it in t he days of today? The racquet and the pellet Laya, the planting of wood, fea tures ethnic and linguistic similarities interlock the peoples on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, but always and only those who once had cultural relations with the ow ners of the universal empire now submerged. These arguments are to complete the simila rities between the enigmatic ancient civilizations of the Old and New Wor ld, known from previous studies and has already highlighted by von Hum-Boldt. All th ese elements indicate a common cause, a common center, the Atlantis, the hea rt of this maritime empire has long gone, and whose echoes can be distant in the shadow s of the past tracing remote, only the indirect way and the expense of great efforts. As the primitive cultural center itself disappeared, only indirect analogies can be made by way of arguments, indicating cultural links and missing r emotíssimos lost to time. However, these analogies have no evidential value and, we may consider them as valid evidence of the likelihood of that supposed center of civi lization really existed. Can not wait for more positive results, while the bot tom retains the key witnesses of Atlantis. However, what has been found is better than nothing, and besides, the Atlantis, with its advanced civilization, has not disa ppeared from the face of the whole earth. The disaster of Atlantis and its Geological Evidence As was missing an exact proof, the scope of natural sci ence, proving the existence of"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" Atlantis, were allowed to speak for or against the alle ged existence. However, after the presentation of such evidence, based on arguments, there can be no more doubt about that in the Quaternary period, this island in fact diver t the Gulf Stream to the west. The critical paleoclimática revealed, with certainty, tha t the glaciers in the North West European progressed to 52 ° latitude, and only a function of t he Gulf that otherwise would have caused the melting and retreat would not have re ached the European shores, but just a great island in the middle of the ocea n which gave its name. What once existed above sea level and now there no longer e xists, can only become submarine, which is impossible since such massive land have been dissolved into nothing. The map of the deep Atlantic revealed this secr et. The island was submerged. With its imposing walls and large channels, has become massive in natural ground, submarine, located in the exact point, because the cont rary would be an inexplicable coincidence, in the Gulf, free and clear, bringing its w aters to the east. The external appearances indicate that the island actual ly disappeared lock-step of glaciation and topography of the seabed where it sank to s hows. At this point, the geological evidence is undisputed, perfect. It is now studying in detail, as it was that big island in the metamorphosis massive underwater ground f loor, with these studies is of any reference to the Platonic narrative, the popula r legends and the whole complex of problems surrounding the prehistoric island of Atlantis . In another part has already been mentioned that Alfred Wegener did not believe in the existence of an island-blocking in the Atlantic because , according to its layout, the edges of the two systems of tectonic plates on the righ t and left of the ocean, combined well in the absence of a turf intermediary. The Figure 27 shows the geological evidence relevant. The South, the argument is well reasoned Wegener. The we st coast of Africa adjusts itself perfectly to the west coast of the Brazilian plate tectonics, the big nose, which divides the current of Monções, enough to fill the Gulf o f Guinea are called. However, the North, to the perimeter of the North Atlantic, t he argument loses its validity. The Canadian turf does not show any boss, able to fill the great emptiness called Gulf of Biscay. There, a huge hole opens up between the continen tal plates, too large to be covered by a ultratolerante crayon. At this point the Reconst-tion of Wegener's admirable in its basic concepts, and of great merit, is subject to correction. In order to proceed with this fix, urges further on the basic ideas t hat guided the conceptualization of Wegener. The idea that, from a specified time, the Old and New Wo rld moved away each other, should also be valid for the state of things before thi s removal. Previously, the tectonic plates formed an integral system, which broke over a ce rtain line of disruption, for now no matter the reason of such breach."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" Figure 27. The edges of tectonic plates do not fit. Against the exhibition of Alfred Wegener, the edges of the plates are arranged only in the South Atlantic, where it comes from South America and Africa, but fail to adjust to the North Atlantic, a fact of utmost importance for our subject. There, between Afric a and Europe, on the one hand, it is Canada, and the other side there is a \"blac k spot\", a vacuum, the basin of northeast Mexico, formed by erosion (M). In the Nort h Atlantic is impossible to combine the cards, unless it is considered for both the dorsal Atlantic. The crack was not located in any point on the Earth's surface, but between the two systems of tectonic plates and, therefore, certainly today, where there are separated by a large pit of water formed by the Atlantic. Arbitrarily, the reconstitution of Wegener assumes the total disappearance of crack, the point of the separation was caused by a break over the c ards so perfect that, if they were reconstituted, their edges are adjusted as part of a ga me of Puzzle . Even less so made explicit, this is the fundamental idea of the resto ration of Alfred Wegener. However, such failure is rebuilding under the quantitative e lement, as shown in Figure 27, neither can be correct about their intellectual ass umption. Just happens that the continental plates do not match, as they should combine , in a game of puzzles. Only a fairly homogeneous body, such as a steel plate, c an be cut into parts perfectly accurate and circumvented. However, the geological situati on has completely different materials and configurations. Starting with primitive pla te, as alleged by Wegener was not a homogeneous formation, but a mosaic that is to c ool and shrink while the melting pot incandescent, was fragmented into a thousand pieces. G rooves and cracks in these pieces came from the liquid magma, prEN-ing them. According to the terminology introduced by Eduard Suess, the cracks between the boards ar e composed of Simon Sial, which came under the relatively narrow crevices of the mantle of SIAL disintegrated during the process of cooling. Which would be grounds for removal of the plates of SIAL, right and left of the line of rupture, this assumes that the Sima desgrudaram, entered int o their slots and pasting them. While it broke the plates, the adhesive element of substance identical to the substrate of Simon, remains in its original place by gl ue more strongly in the Sima, which edges of the plates of SIAL, the alien substance. And while the SIAL cards differ from each other in positive secretion of the o ld line of fracture, ie the backbone formed by Sima, remains in place. Then comes back as a narrow, thick many, whose retrace edges, exact lines, the outlines of the tecton ic plates that is rid of him. Only if that always equal thickness dorsal present, would be the pe rfect adjustment of continental plates. This can happen, but not always the case. In the South Atlantic, the East and West African Brazilian combine example of ho w you adjust to Scandinavia, Iceland and Greenland, on the shores of the Arctic Sea . However, except in those regions, the dorsal Atlantic is not a smooth track, th e sides parallel, but a complicated system of differences. First, we must determine what really represents dorsal Atlantic; wrinkling is not a submarine, nor a submerged chain of mountains, but the mo ld of Simon that I was after the break and away from the system of tectonic plates. These plates started to move away from each other at the exact point of the dorsal Atlantic, the Old World, the most massive plate, departed for the East, moving slower than the New World to the West, why, today to date, the dorsal Atlantic is closer to E urope than North America. The geological evidence shows the original location, the or iginal two continental plates, before their separation and their subsequent removal rec iprocal."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" It is of special importance to the fact that these co ntours corrected much better match with the different continental plates, as shown in Fi gs. 27 and 28. The western edge of Europe fits into the eastern edge of the dorsal Atlantic . In turn, the eastern edge of North America adjusts to the dorsal edge of the western Atlantic, at least one point, located between Florida and Cape Hatteras. There must on ce have existed that land at any time later, collapsed and sank, and it is precisely t his gap still to play important role. For a full understanding of the removal not just the cont inental model of restoration, designed by Wegener, right in your principles and quite impress ive, showing how the plates are floating in the substrate of Simon, as the ice floating in water. They do not float, they are trapped in that body thick, sticky, the s ticky secure with powerful forces. The moment we begin to move, enormous energy i s released by the tremendous friction, caused the side edges and lower parts of the car ds, sent to all locations where the hardest SIAL is stuck in the Sima, sticky like pitch. Therefore, movements of the removal process is not so simple and without consequence. Figure 28. The hordes of tectonic plates adjust to the dorsa l Atlantic. The outline map shows, in parallel projection, the right angle, the posi tion of tectonic plates in the third less than before the first removal mainland. The plat es fit in perfectly to the edges of the dorsal Atlantic, only basin in the U.S., a \"blac k-spot\" marks an erosion of land has since registered. The outgoing board is subject to abrasion; time or anoth er, it is off or more smaller segments, which were then buried in the \"Sima-keel\", dem arcating the direction taken in its removal.

These isla nds do not represent the remaining, neither the pillars of the bridge formed by a chunk of la nd submerged, as the theory of the bridge, but the markings are readily identifiable, lef t by removal of a movement and abrasion of cubes, on time remotíssimos. The geologica l interpretation of such evidence encourages their understanding as to find the obse rver is able to see how Sima erodes the plan of a continent and erodes the edges of the cubes, segments of them loosing large and small, that holds, while the hea vy block of SIAL still away. The geological evidence shown by fig. 30 supports such interpr etation. This is the system of gaps for Atlantic that ended puzzles geologists a nd oceanographers still larger than those around the Atlantic origin of the dors al, central. They leave gaps cross dorsal to the right and left, quite regularly arranged and reminding branches from the trunk of a tree. In most ca ses lead fragments in their points of islands. Are also traces left by movement o f removal, marking the path taken by different segments of individual cubes detachment, to l eave its original place to go to your current location. There where the primitive fo rces, causing the disruption and removal, have reached the sectionals the tectonic pla tes, they have tremendous friction in your plant and its lateral edges. The cubes and targeted for removal in a plant had not smooth, but in the gap and thickness diversa.Logo, vis ited the magma of the substrate so variable and, thus, they left the tracks v ary in depth and sharpness. Nor were uniformly solid and therefore did not suffer, by abr asion, wear varies across its surface. The segments were detached prisoners anywhere i n the \"Sima-keel\" and, along with the trail left by his departure, came to integrate the corresponding gap cross. Therefore, this impressive relief of the ocean bed doe s not always existed, nor represents the remnants of an \"Atlantic Continent\" s ubmerged. Its origin dates back to the lower Tertiary period, when began the removal of t ectonic plates, which followed, having evolved during this process to its current size and complexity. Only powerful forces may have caused the loosening of the plates of h is primitive primary location, and therefore would never have been enough to force the removal of poles, thesis advocated by Wegener and Koeppen and indeed quite questionable f rom a geophysicist. Also, such a force could have the plates in parallel to the South, but never in line odds for the West and East. None currentl y known of the forces could be regarded as giving rise to this movement. That earthly r evolution of lower Tertiary period, inaugurating a new order or disorder of the continen ts, not at all be interpreted according to theories of Lyell. The transformation of the entire land surface, accompanied by the burial of hundreds of thousands of square kilometers, under thick layers of lava and the tremendous ramifications of moun tains, was not a gradual process, flegmático, but a real catastrophe in the whol e meaning of the word. Here geological evidence of a first order, and showing so undeni able, the fact that the face of the earth has gone through enormous revolutions. Moreover, this disaster was not in the lower third on ly to occur, it must have been followed by another. A strange way to \"U\", originating in the remote Patagonia (Fig. 29) is there to show it. Since receiving the initial i mpetus, the continental plates follow straight, under the incredible slowness of his movement , in principle, do not occur in curves, or make turns, unless you receive a second impulse, which then makes the change course. Therefore, the Patagonian tip of plate te ctonics in the Brazilian left, with the marks of his expulsion as a \"U\", a insofismáv el geological evidence, stating"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" the effect of two pulses, significantly different and th erefore the occurrence of two revolutions land, generating such pulses.

However, the geological evidence shows that the removal was restrained by the action of a counter-thrust, where many segments are loosen plaque and revealed to the islands, demarcating its way, so this is a sign that new forces, revolutionizi ng the Earth, came into work. The fig. 29 shows the effect of those forces, the original point of departure for the East have been diverted to the west which has since departed the African coast of Brazil, which once was far more forthcoming, and opened the gap b etween continents and the Atlantic South Undoubtedly, this removal to the west is the removal of Canada in same direction, which should have started in the third less, but only at the end of the Quaternary has to be strengthened and accelerated.

What matters for our subject is only the second disaste r, which occurred at the end of the season diluvial. The fact that it happened long after the period has been verified by third track, marking the removal of Patagonia. Since the segment, directed to the east, is very extensive, it outlines the need to calculate f or long periods of time, whereas movements of such removal, but may have sudden onset, th en suffer the action of Sima refreadora, viscous , tenacious, and then proceed with sl ow secular.

In the years 1893 to 1896 this part of the Atlantic was systematically investigated b y the Norwegian polar expedition, led by Fritjof Nansen. In the seabed between Iceland a nd the small volcanic island of Jan Mayen (about 72 ° north), we found large number of she lls of sea shells and shallow Otoliths from animals that lived in shallow seas, but these findings were made at depths of 1,000 ma 2500 m, in direction south. At the time, Nansen and his colleagues concluded that there entire region and should hav e sunk very suddenly, up to 2,000, in a recent geological time, not least because o f the animals in shallow water would have had time to save on the continental shelf.

There certainly wa s no collapse of the order of 1,000 to 2,000 m in several million square kilometers of land a rea of continental proportions, on the most recent geological times. The l evel of Sima in the Atlantic basin fell due to the action of a geophysical phenomenon , subject to restoration, this is the only plausible way of how the collapse occurred.

In general, increases the depth of the sinking of the no rth to the south, toward the dorsal Wyville-Thomson, allowing the unequivocal conclusi on that the process began in the vast South Atlantic basin, from where it reac hed the remote polar regions. The epicenter of the disaster caused a strong drop in the leve l of Simon, it was located right in the middle of the Atlantic. The dorsal Rejkjanes is the guideline for the next step, the Platform of the Telegraph, the so-called historical fact, recorded during the instal lation of the transatlantic cable. Suddenly, it broke the cable, installed in 1898, to 49 ° north and 29 west of Paris. It seems that the tips of the wires fell into a bottoml ess abyss, and the expense of great efforts, had to be retrieved with handle submarines. By coincidence, along with the cables, even other objects, including a heavy stone ro ck, were retrieved from the ocean bed. The rock was delivered to the Museum of Paris and, af ter 15 years, was examined by Paul termios, then director of the Oceanographic Ins titute and a renowned scientist inside and outside of France. The stone of rock proved to be a taquílito of vitreous structure clearly. Then termios submitted the results of their studies to the Oceanographic Institute, where he gave a remarkable speec h, under the title \"L'Atlantide\" - The Atlantis, exposing the following co nclusions: I) The rock is of volcanic origin, large bed of the oce an, which was recovered, is covered with lava. Therefore, under the platform of the Telegraph must have been very strong volcanic eruptions, lava projecting the proceeds of which the stone of rock recovered. II) The stone is amorphous, not crystalline and vitreo us, in its structure. Your cooling may not have happened in submarine waters, but the open, so can only have been designed by a volcano land above sea level. The lava wh ich now covers vast stretches of the deep comes from terrestrial volcanoes once. III) Simultaneously with that volcanic eruption, or soo n after, throughout the region must have sunk in 2000 m. The stone of rock recovered document s a pre-historic catastrophe, which occurred right in the middle of the At lantic, there where, under Plato, would have sunk the island of Atlantis. IV) As mentioned, according to the mineralogical classi fication, the stone is a taquílito. Within some 15,000 years, the taquílitos usually dissolve in the seawater. However, the stone in question also shows contours and profiles, with out any sign of corrosion. The disaster in the Atlantic, indirectly confirmed by this finding, it should have been less than 15,000 years ago, or after 13,000 BC, but probably at a date much later. This timing gives, surprisingly, with brief indications Plato, speaking on \"9000 years before Solon, placing it around 10,000 BC, and is the average so far established by geological estimates for the end of the period quartenário. The results of research performed by termios are being challenged by the argument for Hartung, presented by the German geologist of that name, which in 1860 gave a description of the Azores islands. It mentioned erratic coastal rocks, stones of aliens, who have nothing to do with the actual Azores, but that , unknown origin, for there were taken and deposited by the waves, presumably, these s tones have been brought"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" by floating ice. Long the ice melted, but it closed the rocks were there. However, these rocks are found in the coastal current and there Hartung c oncluded that the region of the Azores, the level never experienced post-glacial ch anges of major consequence. Hógbom and concludes that in the Azores was never a disa ster, because the corresponding change of level would have been contradicted by the argument of Hartung. However, the evidence that, in fact, the argume nt for Hartung? Nothing more and nothing less than the absence of changes of level, post-glacial, in large, in the Azores. But this argument fails to prove that this leve l of change would have occurred shortly before the start of post-glacial era, this is precisely the end of the Quaternary, then was already completed, to begin, slowly, the period of post-glacial melting and retreat of glaciation. It was precisely that which Pa ul termios found: a lower level, passing the 2,000 m, accompanied by volcanic eruptions and cat astrophic processed with spontaneity. When the glaciers, in slow retreat, multiplied itself in ever more intense pace, the ice floating sail to the South, lead ing to the Azores, to reach those regions, there exist no more the island of Atlantis, it was submerged; in its place was a tiny archipelago, the islands of the Azores. For this reason, the floating ice could not have brought in another place, beyond the modern coastli ne those islands. No doubt since there was no further change in level. In this respect the argument for Hartung \"does not contra dict the narrative Platonic, nor the conclusions of either the termios and current deductions. Rather, this argument confirms this, considering the following: the assumption of the agreement of the theory of Atlantis with the argument of Hartung \"presumably is t he sudden and catastrophic degradation of the soil in the region of the Azores. Th is agreement would become at odds, if the demotion, said by termios, if processed in s low, old, creepy, continued throughout the extensive post-glacial. In this case, tho se erratic rocks, taken during long periods, would have been deposited at the modern coast, but the previously existing beaches and meanwhile sunk. Therefore, the location of the rocks is crucial for r esolving the issue of kneeling in the debate have occurred so suddenly, or slowly. And the rocks are in the exact place, where there should to be, supposed that the sinking of the old coastline was sudden as to cause the icefloe based on today's coastal range, ty pical of post-glacial time. Therefore, the argument for Hartung \"evidence that the s inking of Atlantis, if so, must have been sudden. It is precisely this which tells Plat o: \"... during a single day and one night unchancy ill.\" Therefore, a counter-argument turned comprobatória evidence of a much discussed passage of the Platonic text. The region of the Azores, the direct neighbor of Telegr aph Platform, provides further evidence. There, the seabed in shallow restricted area of steep slopes on all sides, it presents profiles and strong corners and rugged high peaks, and preserved, yet nothing rounded, with deep cracks, a genuine mountain landscape, underwa ter, in which, as the Platonic story, every vestige of earth has been radic ally obliterated. If he was under massive sea level by more than 15,000 years, the sea wat er had corroded the lava that covered the ocean bed, and destroyed, completely, the perf ilações crisp and delicate. Beside the chemical attack, the mechanical forces such as abrasion, erosion and the effect of hangover, had also acted in a manner destructi ve, grinding and rounding all corners and peaks, leveling everything. However, as the entire bottom of the sea, under the current zone of hangover, remained clearly framed a nd shaped the land now submerged may not have sunk to the few. In this case, wi thin a few centuries, the chemical and mechanical forces would race eradicated all its features, which still continue to jump in the eyes. Once the island, whose hi ghest elevations are there and"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" we are known as the Azores Islands, certainly not stuc k in slow, gradual, but highly accelerated, and also certain is that this was less t han 15,000 years ago. Therefore, the geological evidence allows the conclusio n that the entire area between the island of Jan Mayen and the Azores, suffered a sudden lowering of the ground at the end of the Quaternary. This reduction was much deeper the closer the epicenter of the disaster, whose location can be predicted anywhere in the south of the Azores. Moreover, it has spread catastrophic demotion well beyo nd the region of the Azores, south toward Moreover, this fact is known since 1900, when the expeditionary vessel \"GAUSS\" recovered a sample of sediment from 46 cm in len gth, the abysmal pit of Romanche (7,300 m). This area is very close to the equato r, west of the gap of Liberia, on the border between northern and southern basins of the Atlantic, crossing the Atlantic back, it seems like it cut in half, some 4,500 kil ometers of the Azores. A sample of sediment recovered by \"GAUSS\" presented five layers, namely: on top, a layer of red clay, then three layers of continental sedimentation, lime-free, and below, a layer of lime-glo bigerino that adapted to life of plankto n, is found only at depths of at least 2,000 m up to 4500 m. That means that when the layer of lime was deposited globigerina the abysmal pit of Romanche had at most 4,500 m , while now it is 7300 m. Therefore, the ocean bottom must have suffered a reducti on of at least 2,800 m, which is equivalent to that found Paul termios to the region of the Azores Platform and the Telegraph. With this, the boundaries within which can b e proved the consequences of disaster, which occurred at the end of the Quaternary, e xtended itself, and much, toward south. The spontaneous disappearance of an area, with many mill ions of square kilometers in area, could not have happened without the bangs of volcani c and seismic convulsions, orchestrated the theme of a great final, announcing the end of the world, as if, instead of those violent convulsions, the deflections were sl ow, gradual, the Atlantic basin of Simon could take them together, moving their tenacious ma ss, but still elastic. However, facing tremendously dramatic interventions, ra dical, its basic subject has become rigid and lost all its elasticity, was breaking, breaking and cracking, which went by the magma near the surface, which then covere d all life on land. Indeed, much of the Atlantic basin is covered with this crust of r ecent volcanic magma, acid, contrary to what occurs with the seabed, also unstable, the Pac ific Ocean, composed of basic magma paleogêneo. This time, the evidence is not of a ge ological, but paleomineralógica. In turn, the vulcanology also provides considerable contr ibution to our subject. It is remarkable the occurrence of volcanoes Atlantic, thro ughout this vast region, crossed by a guideline of craters in eruption. This line follows , with much accuracy, the dorsal Atlantic, thus an old line of fracture, once open and al ways ready to open up again, for any reason, with much greater ease than a stable area intact (Fig. 32). The chain of volcanoes Atlantic, vomiting fire and dea th, and begins the north, on the island of Jan Mayen, where she began, obviously, the l owering of the seabed. It continues towards Iceland, the land of ice and fire, whe re, in the terrible disaster of historic 1783, nearly 500 craters erupt, then leads to the ni ne Azores islands, five of which have active volcanoes. This is potentially ver y dangerous area in which, as happens in the regions of Iceland, time or other, islan ds emerge and disappear with the speed of a thunderbolt. Islands of Cape Verde, the Fuego is smoke and also the island of Madeira is an outbreak of seismic upheavals.

Thus the findings volcanology, geological paleomineralógico s and support the argument that the lowering of the bottom of the Atlant ic Ocean is not done gradually, but revolutionary, catastrophic. The epicenter of this disaster must be sought to the south of the Platform of Telegraphs, whereas the depth o f degradation is increasing in the direction south, through the Azores region. These se arches could be useful for the system of cross gaps, branched throughout that area underwa ter, possibly because it remained a trace of extreme destruction. The Figure 30 sho ws the geological evidence. Figure 32. Distribution of volcanoes in the North Atlant ic. The map shows in dotted line, the contours of the dorsal Atlantic, with their differences. The centers of active volcanoes are marked with dots, regions of earthquakes wit h lines in parallel.

The southwestern part of the North Atlantic, occupying about a third of its total area, has its particular target, atrocious, responsible for the des truction of cross gaps, which at first there must have existed, and the formation of va cuum in which Fig. 28 appears as an unexplained gap between the Florida and Cape Hatteras. N ow this gap has also to establish a connection with similar phenomena. Do these three areas of disasters, the southern part o f the Arctic Sea, the region of the Azores and the North American basin, geological revolut ions have suffered in different seasons? In normal times, the day-to-day runs in a geol ogical flegmática, gradually, the way it was advocated by Lyell and gives no opportunity to assume the occurrence of any number of disasters. No, that was one disaster vic tims, the one time, the three stages of a huge geological drama. The evidence attests th at the geological cataclysm Atlantic has been reconstituted to be a harsh and dreadf ul reality geological, which interrupted the day-to-day land and closed the fourth period o n a geological sudden dread. This is not an empty hypothesis. Recently, samples of soil, for which Pettersson reported in his book \"Atlantik und ATLANTIS - The Atlanti s and the Atlantic, show that the revelations made during our studies. Are samples o f type record of almost 3 m in length, the North American geophysicist Piggot recove red them from the Atlantic and found that often show two zones, rich in volcanic ash, and Pettersson wrote about: \"These ashes must be from massive volcanic eruptions, or occurring in the West Indies or, more probably, in the dorsal central Atlantic ... \" However, the most important stretch of the exposures o f Pettersson is: \"Of the two volcanic profiles, the higher it is above the upper glacial profile, indicating that this volcanic disaster or the disaster occurred in post-glacial times ...\" This was finally invalidated the argument of Hògbom cont radicting the conclusions of Paul termios, producing identical result with that obtaine d by Pettersson, based on the analysis of samples, type it in Piggot. These samples co nfirm, so indisputable, that in the Atlantic Ocean was in fact a volcanic disaster, which ended the Quaternary period and introduced the post-glacial time. Similar evidence was taken from near Newfoundland, also show these volcanic ash, with all t he seaweed ash, dating from the time of critical transition for the quaternary quintená rio. Pettersson made the following comments regarding: \"In any case, these findings provide strong grounds for bel ieving that the time after the last major glaciation, when the Platonic Atlantis ha d disappeared, in fact was a period of volcanic and seismic disasters, within the North A tlantic ...\" Sometimes, however, that the seabed further betrayed s ecrets. One of the samples above was removed from the dorsal c entral Atlantic, the exact point where, according to the narrative of Plato, was at the island of Atlantis, also the deductions taken to date have confirmed the location of t he large island that in the Quaternary, crashed the passage of the Gulf. In this res pect, that particular sample offers special interest. What it revealed? As was to be expected, proved to be dif ferent from the others, drawn to the right and left that part of the basin part of the Atlantic. It was surprisingly short, a pellet of only 8 cm thick. Pettersson said to them: \"Below the sample taken, the probe appears to have found h ard material, presumably based on rock, which were not removed any evidence ... So, is not out of the question whether the backbone of the Central Atlantic, which carries the sample concerned, have been above sea level, until about ten millennia ago, when they fell to the depth at"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" which is now ... \" The focus of disaster Every disaster has a genuine focus, its center of origin , from which they spread and multiply the disruptive and revolutionary forces. Even the catastrophe of Atlantis undoubtedly real, definable and historically and geographical ly located accurately, must have resulted from such a focus. Until now only be used as evidence geological current degre e of progress of our research today's, and thus revealing aspects of our presen t. However, if you restore that pre-historic catastrophe, and as the main clue to find their focus, we must consider the geographical changes, recorded during the seasons that h ave passed since then. What was the geographical situation in the North Atlant ic at the end of the Quaternary? According know contemporary nature, we may assume that in essence the major tectonic plates, on both sides of the Atlantic then f ossa, has reached its today's location. As Alfred Wegener, this assumption must be made with some reservation because it was the stress, specifically the removal o f America, to the west and away from the Old World to the East, and encourage those stri ctly accurate measurements revealed that in fact and confirmed the reciprocal remo val of the Old and New Worlds. Therefore, in the early fifth geological period, or som e twelve millennia ago, the Atlantic should have been less wide than today. However , the theory of Wegener did not indicate, exactly, the difference found. Fortunately, there is a possibility that can answer t his important question. The Paleoclimatologia provides the method to reconstruct the location of major plates and, thus, the width of the North Atlantic at the end of th e Quaternary. As explained elsewhere, are already in our knowledge of th e fact and why the so-called limits of glaciation determine the location of the is otherms to zero degree, the Quaternary period. The path of these lines, characteris tic of the climate during the Quaternary can be reconstituted without any problem. Its location on the North Pole Quaternary must have been similar to that occupied by th e zero degree isotherms of today's on the actual North Pole, or must be accompanie d by parallel line approximately between the meridians 50 ° and 60 ° north lat itude. Its only essential difference from today's isotherms 0o is the absence of the \"bag of gifts, brought by the Gulf Stream, the wind on the northern Norway, crucial to the contemporary climate. The roughly the isotherm 0 ° stentrional diluvial has a rough back in a radius of 30 ° and 40 °, around the North Pole diluvial. As this track alm ost coincides with the limit of glaciation, it is assumed that during the period diluvial must have formed a circle around the pole diluvial. Comparing this conclusion with the location of today's tectonic plates, check that the limits of glaciation absolutely not stood in line circ ular, around the North Pole modern. Therefore, there is inferred that the location of tw o large tectonic plates, Canada and Eurasia, has been different, both in relation to each other as the North Pole, or as a requirement to fulfill the condition paleoclimática move away from isotherms derived from zero degree. To meet this requirement, you must move both plates in a direction to another and towards the North Pole, as shown in Figure 33, then to t he limits of glaciation form a circle, with the North Pole in the center diluvial. What this figure shows quite instructive? First, that th e Old World at that time was"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" very close to the New World in the time of Christophe r Columbus. In fact the pit Atlantic that separated the continents were closer. W e can not ignore the mutual expulsion occurred since then. In the Gulf was, at that time, a shortest way to carry your water warm, tropical, which reached the island-loc k, diluvial, the Platonic Atlantis, warmer than today to reach the Azores regio n. Secondly, the research faced with the fact not wholly unexpected that the North Pole diluvial stayed well away from the actual North Pole, i t seems that the exact point where today it is the Pole magmetico, amidst the numero us islands at the time completely covered with ice from the northern Canada a nd Greenland, whose dissolution in individual cubes, then, perhaps not yet reac hed the stage was reached today. Angular in its value, since the removal of the po le is then recorded, and quite accurately, the obliquity of the ecliptic. However, not to keep to our subject, here it is not even outline the importance of this result to defin e the problems of glaciations. Figure 33. The arctic glaciation in the Quaternary.

The n, cross the gaps were shorter than today, with missing sections corresponding to the path be aten by the plates and the cubes in mutual remoteness, and in times epiglacial postgla cial. Where is the creeping motion, the partial removal in t he direction of driving force. In each of the isolated cases, the directions of the cre eps and the pulse are identical. However, the forces that accelerated the movement of plates and cubes of thitherward crawls, from the outbreak of the disaster, this center that was originating. This was the source of these impulses tremendous energy and power as to change the position of the continents, which due to their inertia, remain away e ach other, until the present. Furthermore, it is inferred that the extension, vice versa, these directions of crawls back to the source still hypothetical and being sought, th en it should come and set it as the focus of the disaster.

Now, this particular destination itself and becomes clear, the land was lyi ng there collapsed and fractured the bottom of the sea, because it is located very clo se to the central focus of the disaster. Moreover, the map oceanographical (Board 12) provides furthe r evidence of another invaluable. In the exact point where the focus was foun d, the relief of the soil is absolutely normal. It is located on two huge gaps, of 7,000 m depth, near the stump of the remaining fracture gap of Puerto Rico and in the coas tal zone and not fall far from the southern edge of the massive submarine, which, befo re being submerged , was the island-lock, the lock X \"Quaternary clay in which the pa ssage of the Gulf and was identified as Platonic Atlantis. To the south, the are a of focus is defined by the trench of Puerto Rico, from 9000 m depth. With this, it is anothe r link in the sequence of searches, allowing predictions of even broader scope, no t only about the outbreak, but also the real cause and result of the catastrophe of At lantis. Without doubt, the disaster came from those two abysses submarines, located right in the middle of the outbreak and in surroundings which are con centrated the effects of the catastrophe of Atlantis. In Alan H. Kelso de Montigny, the American anthropologi st, in this context could still be included regions in the eastern Caribbean Sea, surroun ded by the arc of the Lesser Antilles. Also there oceanographical the map shows a \" hole\" puzzling, and in the middle of the Antilles, which is surrounded by, as if the remaining edge of a gigantic crater half-submerged.

As the supposed site of the fall o f asterói will not be far from the two huge underwater cliffs, in the basin of the Nor th American Atlantic and, therefore, the focus of the disaster, it could be dealin g with another fragment of that celestial body which, supposedly, would have caused the disas ter Atlantic at the end of the period diluvial. However, as the extensions of thes e three cavities submarine the \"hole\" in the Caribbean is relatively small and shal low in comparison to the other two huge gaps, covering an area of approximately 200,000 km2.

Funnels have been sucking the land, whose collapse was caused by tectonic tremors or huge doline swirls produced by submarines? Its vast extent and depth exclude the second h ypothesis. The theory that the two gaps represent a kind of side effects of day-to-day geology, would not explain precisely the decisive fact of why they exist, and in the middle of the outbreak of the disaster and located precisely. No crater, produced by the fall of an object, either a doline could suddenly have an influence towards the removal of continents in migration, since this can not be put in doubt by any rea sonable ground. Of course, such attempts to explain things is not enough. The primary cause, as yet unknown, the disaster Atlantis, produced such enormous crate rs to \"pump\", turned and accelerated the reciprocal removal of plates and cubes, and caused the collapse of the coastal basin in the U.S. and at least , opened the lo wering of the ocean bed in the Atlantic and the Arctic Sea. Effects universal its ca uses should have been consistent and the latter may not have been such flegmática, gradual but catastrophic, equal to the cataclysm that caused it. Hardly it could accept another idea, which was in addition to the center of the outbreak of the disaster that was th e ignition of the tremendous energy load, giving the match to that event that revolut ionized the Earth. The two submarines are the gaps still persistent scars of a doubl e wound, opened in the earth's crust by the falling of a celestial body of considerabl e size. With this, under the quantitative aspect, diagraph, and thro ugh all the possibilities offered by the exact sciences, the modern qualitative r esearch confirmed what had been assumed by earlier researchers, such as Wyston the Coun t Carli of Lalande and Braghin . However, the celestial body in question was n ot a comet, according to the technical terminology, but a body larger and erratic, a planetoid. Time it to matter. The two craters opened with his fall, lying side by side , have approximately equal size and shape, both are oval in shape and both of its longit udinal axis ellipses are directed from northwest to southeast. Therefore, the objects that fell there and opened the submarine abysses, or appear to have been the southeast or the northwest. The southeast is not any trace certified. The northwe st is, however, fractured the coastal strip, representing the remnant in. I, which s hould have been tremendous loss as to fracture the land and to demote the seabed. Without doubt, these are indisputable traces of the same disaster. Therefore, the celestia l body was the northwest quadrant and not south, won the race with the Earth in its orb it because it was coming from the west, the west, developing gear to that developed by our pla net. It concludes that its orbit must have been markedly eccentric, since only th us could have achieved in the perihelion, the acceleration greater than the Earth, rotating with constant speed in a nearly circular orbit. The region overflown by this c elestial body, before the disintegration of the heavy nucleus mass, which fell to the bottom, presumably near Puerto Rico, came to break up and sank. However, the adjac ent area of land resisted, but was also affected, as demonstrated by the quality of its center of seismic tremors. Thus, we may wait for more traces of other impacts, c aused by falls in that range and are found between Florida and Cape Hatteras, potentially dangerous in earthquakes. Without doubt the two abysses submarines absorbed the ma in impact, but the subsequent effects, side, also reached the land in the co ntinent. In the gap of Puerto Rico, several million cubic kilometers of the substrat e of Simon, tenacious and tough, were displaced, disintegrated and turned into nothing. Also, the land in the northwest resisted."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" Considering these facts, one could draw the conclusion th at the two abysses submarines, located in the outbreak of the disaster, sho uld be understood as the craters open by the fall of core planetoid, disintegrated into tw o parts, while the destruction of coastal area, the northwest, could be attributed to the fall of fragments of their shell of rock that, in areas more dense air, it would have heate d and divided into huge blocks of stone, producing real effects of cosmic bombs. This cosmic bombardment could hardly have saved the land located more to the northwest, but presumably there the impacts were less c oncentrated, to leave intact the earth crust, rather than shatter it and sink it at sea , such way to the neighboring region, submerged. If it were possible to see to the bottom of the ocean, there probably should appear clear and identifiable traces that cosmic action of global destruction. As of now there are technical conditions for this, because surve ys of the modern eco still not managed to the required degree of clarity, only traces lef t by those looking in the range of intact continental land. Also there should be a cra ter, opened by the cosmic bombardment, maintained over the millennia, that have elapsed since the disaster, and therefore should be apparent.

But nonetheless, this remnant was found, and since then th e region in question is called the \"field of crater of Carolina.\" This is the remnant i n. II, piece of evidence of great value in the extensive list of documents collected. The findi ng was made as follows: In 1931, the state of North Carolina and South Carolina w ithout the slightest intention to collaborate in the search of Atlantis, decided conduc t a new topographic survey, and therefore hired a firm specializing in Aerial Photograph y. In this regard, nothing extraordinary or remarkable to report. During the work, i t also raised the critical area, between Florida and Cape Hatteras, along with its passage inland. However, when their photos with others, were revealed and examined in estereocomparador, then came the unexpected sensation. Commanders of aircraft that s aw these photos, believed to have shifted back in time some 14 years and returned to th e battlefields of World War I, the hell of Flanders, northern France. All photos showing the ground covered in training, partly circular, partly oval, which are somet imes crossed, and so insofismável, have been identified as the craters, filled with mud and covered with vegetation, caused by the fall of objects from gigantic dimensions. And ne ither could be another impression received by a person objectively, without bi as, to study these aerofotos, which certainly reflect the reality. In this case, the camera moved in retrospect, giving a glance at the geological past of our planet. Its penetrati ng lens and incorruptible discovered the meteor of Carolina, the Board 13 shows par t of this material e- rofotogramétrico. Then, those pictures have caused sensation and scientifi c discussions. He then remembered the fact, 36 years ago, L. C. Glenn has a re port on the many bays and inlets, shallow basin of the strange dimensions, whic h felt weird and noticed that throughout the coastal region. At the time, the report r eceived very little attention and was terminated, without wanting to be read. However, th e aerofotos taken in 1931, were genuine documents, illustrative and impressive as to encourage discussions, in part quite shaken, about the causes that have led to the f ormation of craters of the Carolina field."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" The aerial photos show the number of basins in about 3000, half of the basin have the length of some 400 m over a hundred exceed 1600 m in length.

Only a small part of this area is on land Continental, intac t, in its large coastal area is part of the fracture, and the bumpy strip of land submerged. Whereas in the stretch of land intact were counted 3000 impacts, we may calculate that the fragments of cosmic bomb, disintegrated Must have caused at least 10,000 impacts. E ach of these impacts in the soil opened a bowl oval or circular, of unknown de pth, as the angle of fall. All longitudinal axes are arranged in parallel, once the disin tegrated fragments of the bomb fell in parallel. Although, since then, almost eleven millennia had elapsed, most of the Southeast basin still shows traces of the dam resulted in the land of opportunity. Also confirms this detail and conclusive manner, that the i mpact came from the northwest, because only under this assumption the open ground with each impact could have been shifted to southeast, where pile, forming a dam. All the evidence confirms the theory that a large celestial body came from the northwest, disintegrated on the heights and has unleashed the wreckage of his shell of rock, before the fall of fragments of its heavy mass nucleus, the impact caused the two huge underwate r crater, located further south. But if the drop of a genuine meteorite, a large size, the way we have just described, had been recorded in historical times, could hardly have left traces than those shown by the map and oceanographical aerofotos. Thus, after the pub lication of aerofotos concerned, the argument was raised in the field of crate rs Carolina have been produced by the fall of meteorites, and even the so called \"me teor of Carolina.\" Shortly after the publication of the Carolina aerofot os, Dr. F. A. William Melton and Schriever, geologists at the University of Oklahoma, s tudied the problem of the origin of these two huge underwater cliffs and advanced theories about, but without touching the subject of Atlantis. According to these researcher s, the field of craters of the Carolina concentrate was produced by the impact of a rai n of meteorites, the manner of an exceptionally large comet's head. Figure 36.

Most of the missiles fell into the sea, the dotted line circles, about the area affected. The only challenge to this thesis was Mr. Wat-son Fl etcher Jr., he said that in his view all legitimate craters, open to the impact of the fall of meteorites, where are circular, like the crater in Arizona, known and identified as such, while the majority of the basins Carolina are oval and not circular. He seemed un acceptable the argument that the depressions have been produced by meteorites from a h ead of comet disintegrated in the stratosphere, the fact that the head of comet not have enough mass to provide the necessary pieces to that bombing. The Earth - so he writes - had crossed for various occasions, heads and tails of comets and meteor ites concentrations, without such passages have caused disasters. So concludes Fletcher Watson Jr., can not think of a cosmic origin of the basins of Carolina who, in his opinion, were caused by phenomena of dispersion, like the bajirs migration in sa ndy deserts of Central Asia. Of course, the explanation does not satisfy flegmática, it does not explain the unique location of the field of craters on the outbreak of th e disaster, the underwater cliffs and coastal zone fractures and landslides. Neither presents plausible argument by saying that the craters are concentrated in a flat area of elliptical shape, and that, there and there, these conformations cross, finally, it leave s a lot to explain. However at one point without doubt the critical observe r was the reason, the field of craters could have been caused by the impact of a head of comet disintegrated, either by an exceptionally dense concentration of meteorites . Head of a comet would have been small in many dozens of figures, and too lacking in mass, might have caused dramatic celestial fireworks, the edges of the envelope of nitrogen, but never lighting it up high in the atmosphere could have had consequences land. A concentration of meteors is a formation of flying objects in parallel, even if large objects, but until now did not register such condensation of supermeteoros, have always flown in parallel and therefore the direction of fall also would have been i n parallel . In this case, should have open borders craters of equal, or in a circular or elliptical, but never like those that exist in the craters of the Carolina, which ar e depressions, sometimes round sometimes elliptical. The effective distribution of co nformations is lawless serious obstacle to the theory of cosmic bombs, as evidence that both paths as the angles of the drop must have been very diverse. In vertical drop, a s happened in the case of the giant meteorite of Arizona, pumps cosmic open spherical de ep craters in the ground, but elliptical. As explained, therefore, that confusion of paths of vertical and horizontal fall in any part of the area affected? This can only result from the fact that a celestial body, in size much bigger than a meteor, for the purposes of this technical term, has suffered several explosions and partial to have disintegra ted into several parts in various parts of its path of decline. Each individual fragm ent thus formed, is then precipitated on the ground, following his own path of declin e, which may have been both vertical and horizontal, as appropriate. Furthermor e, the acceleration of individual pieces during the explosion inside the celestial body, sho uld also have contributed to increase the general confusion. In this sequence of idea s, what is similar to an elliptical plan, represents a kind of explosion range, accumulating fra gments of cosmic size, direction and acceleration different in distribution com pletely arbitrary, confusing, with the possible accumulation of these fragments in the cen ter of the track .

The rough, as was to be expected, the multiple cosmic bom b fell just behind the nucleus of the celestial body, then overtaken by the Ea rth. The table illustrates the Falls and unmistakable way, the simple idea, astronomically we ll motivated, than would have been the tail of the celestial body disintegrated, huddle behind their core and, thus, their appearance would have been a huge comet. In view of this, as the theory was to predict, but in practice it was hardly to be expected, the discovery of the meteor Carolina so conv incingly confirms the validity of the argument that the catastrophe of Atlantis originate d cosmic. Therefore, it is a brief report on comets, meteors a nd concentration of meteors and other celestial bodies that, by chance, through the sky in order to be able to form an idea of what ultimately led to disaster Atlantis. Let us observe a formal, preliminary. The Astronomy di stinguish between fixed stars and planets. One fixed star, the sun, it is in our solar system, in its turn around the planets, he lit up following in their respective orbits, which lie on a common plan, the ecliptic, which, in turn, almost coincides with the equa torial plane of the Sun in rotation. Apparently, this beautifully simple system and, at least in its appearance, highly stable, celestial mechanics, hardly fit meteor s, concentration of meteors, comets either. Although the latter also in most cases, geneti c were members of our solar system, their orbits do not usually stay in the eclipti c, their plans are those with oblique angle, and almost always, their orbits up extremely ecc entric ellipses. So cut the planetary orbits nearly spherical and, thus, can approach the Earth, time or other. As a rule, this approach does not contain any danger, due to the tiny mass of these \"shooting stars\". Often, the nuclei of comets little resistance, also called \"head\", and the mass of gas that is under the pressure of sunlight, ca lled \"tail\", it disintegrates. Thus, in May 1846 was the disintegration of the comet Biel a, which appears periodically, during their passage through perihelion; probabl y disintegrated with the force of gravity once the sun returned, identifiable by their form of comet and then disappeared, probably was absorbed by a large planet, or fr agmented in a concentration of meteorites. This is the view of most comets, are transformed into many pieces, as concentrations, continuing the original orbit of the c omet. When the Earth passes through such a concentration of meteors, there is the phenomenon of shooting stars. In very rare cases and, by rule, off to such periodic conce ntrations, larger fragments fall from the sky, as the so-called \"ball of fire.\" Once s uch \"messengers from heaven\" obtained distinction and veneration unreasonable and cer tainly exaggerated. Today, more objective attention, according to the value of th e nickel-iron constituent of the body. However, how interesting it may be, it is not h ere deal with the problems of structure of iron meteorites. However, there is another problem related to the mete orite, which requires response, namely that the glowing balls of fire and shooting star s? Each cosmic particle, whether large or small - is good stress this detail at the outset - it moves in its orbit around the center of motion of cel estial mechanics, as developed by Johannes Kepler. Within our solar system, the Sun is t he center. In its orbit when a cosmic particle comes closer to the other of a large planet, say the Earth, the orbital plane is crossed in a straight line with the particle i n question, called the line of the node, it is attracted by gravitational forces of attra ction, its orbit is \"distorted\" and it is much more rapid in its course, the closer reach of the Earth. This increases in proportion to its square speed, the power of flight, able t o remove it from the pull of"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" the Earth. If the particle is sufficiently accelerate d, can still escape, in which case it just touches the outer edge of qnvoltório air, heats up and gas, extremely rare around you, it sc autoluminoso like a Geissler tube, is then the tr ace of a distant sparkling shooting star, across the sky. The more long line is that both the body wandering deeper into the atmosphere. However, not all the shooting stars to escape this wa y, many have shifted its orbit, so always stronger for the near Earth, in which directio n will be twisted. Under the geocentric point, the orbit of the cosmic particle appea rs as a drop of almost parabolic trajectory, crossing the first layer of the ionospher e, then the very thin envelope of hydrogen, PPR almost no marks of its passage with light e ffects . Only to touch the edge of the envelope of nitrogen, about 60 km altitude, the ga s density reaches up to the point of the particle to find the progressive air re sistance. Due to its high speed fall, these cosmic bólidos arriving to go several kilometers per second, and its front is heated to thousands of degrees. The peripheral layers evapo rate in part its molecules are ionized and begin to shine in their spectra typical linear. At that time, the meteor in the sky appears as a ball of gas, opaque gloss and color usual ly red or green, as a rule, it takes even a tail as if it were a comet. Sometime s the light of exceptionally large bodies up to overshadow the brightness of the sun because of the enormous thermal expansion, there are extremely high voltages of collaps e within the meteorite, which the body can not resist for long and eventually exploding. In this case it may be that the sky falls a rain of balls of fire, major and minor. H owever, in most, and despite its impressive brightness, the meteors are tiny in size a nd, rarely, her weight is 100 g. They evaporate and dissolve it well before reaching the ground floor. It is nothing, beyond the memory of the observer to have sighted a li ght warning, suddenly, a trace of fire white, green or red, crossing the night sky. How ever, not all meteors were so harmless, and therefore there is the opening of the huge crater in Arizona, USA, which is not the only witness the fall of a large meteor. Also in today's falls were recorded bólides such as the two examples that follow. The February 12, 1947 was recorded the fall of a giant meteor in Siberia, in the Sikhote-Alin mountains, north of Vladivostok. At least one hundred fragments of large meteor hit an area of over 13 km2 of surface, the holes opened by the collapse were almost circular, its diameter reached up to 25 m and its dept h 15 m. The forest around it was destroyed, many trees were uprooted and thrown awa y. The entire region was covered with pieces of iron, both large and small, incl uding some weighing up to 100 kg. At the time tried to calculate the mass of primitive meteor that undoubtedly exploded in the atmosphere, on the basis of the fragment s collected and, thus, it was found the weight of approximately 1,000 tons with a diameter of 10 m. For a celestial body, such specifications do not represent much, but for a meteorite are very respectable. And even then that giant meteorite was still a dwarf c ompared to that, more than 39 years before, also fell in the virgin forests of Sib eria. A meteor fall in with that long and there are authentic reports that convey an image of th e plastic collapse and the effects of its impact. The technical report, the goal Kulik Russi an astronomer, shows the drama of that event: \"On 30 June 1908, at 7.00 pm, near the Tunguska River Podkanennaya ( Tungusca stony), (61 ° N, 102 ° east longitude, west of Pulkovo) precipi tated on the earth a mass of cosmic bodies, which fall so far surpassed all that had been recorded.

The air pressure was strong as to knock people and horses i n a perimeter of 400 miles. Moreover, a strong seismic wave, involving the globe, with a speed of 317 m per second, was recorded by all astronomical observatories , accusing a catastrophic earthquake in Siberia. According to the records of the Se ismic Observatory in Potsdam, Germany, the wave took only 30 hours to circumvo lver our planet, where back then. The surge led to the atmosphere huge quantities of meteoric dust, causing the rise in the sky clouds of calls silver. Everywhere in Western Siberia and Europe, the clouds turned the light of day in a rough gray, red, because of dela y spread on the entire area north of the Old World. Were observed in the whole con tinent and the light reflected by them was intense, the night following the day of th e fall, the astronomer Max Wolff in Heidel-berg, Germany, could not take pictures of the ni ght sky, in the Black Sea region could read with ease the newspaper in full midnight o n July 30 ... If the fall of the meteor would advance in four hours, h ad happened on St. Petersburg, destroying completely the capital of Russian Empire. Imme diately, a column of fire, reaching 20 km altitude, rose at the site of the crash, s ince all the energy of motion is instantaneously converted into heat. At the same time it was the fall of meteor Siberian, other, smaller sports, fell near the city of Kiev. The expedition, which, in 1927, visited the site of the Si berian disaster, found fragments of the meteorite weighing 150 t. Therefore, the total weight of the Siberian meteor must be estimated at one million tonnes, at le ast, but probably in more. The dispatch noted that a perimeter of 60 miles, the fore sts have been eradicated. Hackmatack were huge pine trees and overturned, with their crowns pointing out in an area of 12 miles, everything was burned. Today, already pla ned the many craters, open the soil with falling fragments of the meteor. The ma in part of the cosmic mass is no longer visible, because it penetrated deep into earth crus t. The inhabitants of the region contains several stori es about the disaster of 1908 and describe the huge fire which saw the sky. \" This report suggested the meteor of taiga, famous since th en, has to complete the above exposures of celestial mechanics of meteors. Pr ovides valuable links to comparative studies with this celestial body that, a doz en millennia ago, opened the two abysses submarines in Atlantic basin and produced in the field of craters Carolina, USA. However, the mere comparison of the two meteors, to 1908 with 1947, it is very instructive, the proportion of its mass was approximatel y 1.000:1. However, the difference between their destructive forces apparently w as still more pronounced since the fall of the meteor left little to be noticed in distant regions of Siberia, while the meteor of taiga reflected throughout the Northern Hemisph ere, where both p firmament appeared bright red, as the clouds of silver. Al so this fact is of some importance and should be considered in subsequent searches. Further that the meteor was the taiga, presumably, the one that opened the crater bolide circular in hard rocks of Arizona, USA, and despite the use of methods and equipment of the most modern, up to now could not be recove red from depths. Moreover, the crater is so deep that between-minds was almost completely closed with Delizia soil and rocks. Will the surge of Arizona, whos e fall was also in prehistoric times would have been a companion of smaller size, a t win brother, weaker, which precipitated the giant across the Atlantic? "},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" The Fall of planetoid What was the approximate size of the celestial body th at produced the craters of the Carolina area, USA, and the two gaps in the submarine a rea southwest of the North Atlantic, and the depression less deep in the eastern Ca ribbean? Any estimate about should be based on the comparable eff ects of the fall of that body. Its core abysses opened the submarine and its enclosure of rocks around the crater of the city of Charleston, South Carolina, USA. As the polls show no echo of a soil profile sufficiently clear, it is impossible to measure the Atlantic cliffs and deduce from there the size of the nucleus. Therefore, the attempt of restoration should focus on the following method: In the case of a large meteor exploding, its nucleus is s plit into two parts and the casing of rock in many fragments, we may assume, and quite likely that most of its total mass was contained in the core of ferro-nickel, more heavy, the weight is estimated as at least equivalent to the shell of rock. This latter figure may be reduced with reasonable safety, of remaining there, as of th e inlets Carolina - \"Carolina Bays\". Throughout the affected area were counted approximately ten thousand impacts, located in the \"range of explosion,\" demarcated by the b olide in disintegration, most of which is below sea level. The size of craters varie s greatly, so that it satisfies operate with an average value. It is said that more or less ha lf of the 3000 craters, the surface would have more than 400 to 500 m, but more than a hundred of c raters, ie 3%, show the extent of 1,500 m 2,000 m Computing these data, it would not be exaggerated assume a mean diameter of 500 m to a crater average. It happens that each fragment has opened a smooth cylindr ical crater, to the contrary, the crater could not cross it, as in several crossing points. Therefore, each projectile cosmic era of precise and necessary to open the \"its\" crater in which it was just opening. Because of the high speed of the fall, the soil could not divert to the side and has a direct impact, therefore, the average open with t he impact crater indicates the average diameter of the fragment that caused the bolide. Of course, today we can not further examine the conformation of these fragments, however, by way of comparison, it would be reasonable to assume that they were spheric al. Thus, it is estimated the volume of the shell of rock to represent the sum total of the partial volumes of all spherical fragments, which opened the 10,000 craters of 0.5 km wide domestic media. From dal, the arithmetical calculation offers no more problems. The average volume of each individual fragment must have been at least one twe ntieth of a cubic kilometers, 10,000 of these fragments add up the total volume of at least 500 cubic km. To calculate the specific weight of at least 2 tp/m3, comes more than a billion tons of rocks to the casing of the celestial body disintegrated. The weight of his iron-nickel core must be at least equal. Thus, we obtain a total we ight of the order of 2 billion tons and a total of approximately 600 to 700 km3, and they correspond to a spherical one bolide 10 km in diameter. Even with a tolerance of no mo re than a dozen to more or less to the estimated value of the volume, the minimum diameter of the celestial body prior to its explosion, certainly can be estimated in some miles. In any case, was a giant compared with the meteor that fell in 1947 in eastern Siberia and presumably average 10 m, but also giant was compared with the meteor's taiga, the weight must have been multiple millions of times. If th e latter might be an unusually large meteorite, part of a concentration of meteors, meteor of the Carolina, where for a while if you want to use this term in current use, alth ough technically somewhat incorrect, can not be considered as meteor or comet i tself , because it was too large for"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" this category of children wandering cosmic and tiny. It was a planetoid, one of those small planets, not very rare, which orbit in the cor responding groove of the so-called planetoid, but sometimes beyond, and far, their limits. The following is a brief account on these interesting members of our solar system. Mars the red planet, is the neighbor of the Earth in o uter space, on the other side of the Sun is a surprisingly large gap between Mars and the giant s tar, Jupiter, orbiting around Mars and identifiable by its brightness very clea r, somewhat yellowish . Apparently, this vacuum was not occupied by any planet. How ever, since Johannes Kepler saw it, intuitively, a fictional planet, never met, who then entered it as a hypothesis. The rule formulated by Titius and Bode, orderin g the distances between the planets and the sun in a simple manner, but not enti rely satisfactory, it considers such an invisible world. And on the day of the new year of 1801 Piazza discovered in the constellation Taurus, a spot light, telescoping of th e eighth magnitude, which in its own motion, has been recognized as a planet. In view o f its size abnormally sensitive to it and like it was created, then a new class of satell ites, to the planetoid, the small planets, or planets with similar bodies. The first to be discovered and considered as belonging to this class was called Ceres, was still on e of the largest planetariums in those Lilliputian. That same year, Gauss desincumbiu is the task of calculat ing, under the laws keplerianas the orbit of a planet, for that was based o n little evidence of observation available, located near one another. Thus Ceres, origi nally observed by Piazza for a short time only, to its juncture with the Sun, came to be rediscovered in 1802. This was the signal for the beginning of a real hunt for plan etoid. In 1802, Pallas OLBERS discovered, in 1804, Harding, Juno, and in 1807, again OLBERS the largest planetoid, Vesta, whose diameter is 834 km. With this, it exhausted t he possibilities for discovery easier. In 1845, with the most sophisticated, Hencke found A stree and since then, each year it was discovered more or fewer of planetoid. In 1905 already contains more than 500 and in 1950, the number rose from 2,000. Most of these children between small move up within th e planetoid called the sulcus, located between Mars and Jupiter, but some of them evolv e in orbits almost unbelievable. For example, there is a group of Trojans, three tiny bodies in a common orbit, which run on a strictly equal, with their ends f orming a triangle rectangle. Moreover, there is another group, also have a beautiful classic name. This group is even more interesting, distinguishes itself by its elli psoid orbits, highly eccentric, elongated; in its aphelion, it is beyond the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn and its perihelion beyond the orbits of Mars, Earth and up from Venus to re ach the vicinity of the sun's rays (Fig. 37). Orbital extreme conditions such as these , are only found in concentrations of periodic comets and meteors, of whic h those fancy wandering bodies are distinguished only by its greater mass. Their relati onship confirms, then, to think of Melton and Schriever, that the \"meteor\" in Carolina were a concentration of meteors, caused the explosion of a comet's head. Scientifically, this view was justified, but it contradicted the astronomical nomenclature and did not co nfer with the fact sheet that celestial body. Also this group was discovered in real time record, as fo llows: Eros (for Witt, on 13- 01-1898), Alinda (Wolff, 03-01-1918), Ganymede (Berge, 23-10-1924); Love ( Delporte, 12-03-1932), Apollo (Reinmuth, 24-04-1934), Adonis (Delporte, 12-02- 1936), Hermes (Reinmuth, 28-10-1937). Apparently, this group feels gre at attraction for large planets. In February 1936, one of its members, A donis, was up to some 300,000 km above the Earth where it would have been attracte d and almost captured,"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" and its possible fall would have caused catastrophic destruc tion even more than that caused by a atomic war. However, Adonis been very light and has to get rid of the attraction of the Earth, from which it departed in a s omewhat distorted orbit, moving in hyperbola geocentric. However, there are eleven mi llennia ago, the conditions were very specific as to the humanity of that time has not been fortunate to escape a disaster of cosmic proportions. Figure 37. Orbits of the Group of Adonis. This group also inc ludes some small planetoid, spinning around the sun in eccentric orbits. Th e diagram shows the orbit of Adonis line of dash-dot-dash of love and, in dashed line. By comparison, the diagram shows the orbits of the planets spherical interior, M ars (R), Terra (5), Venus (9) and Mercury (?), Which cut the ellipsoid orbits, eccentric, so that there is a possibility a"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" collision between a planet and a planetoid. There is nothing against the supposition also the celest ial body of some 10 km in diameter, which then crashed into the Atlantic, have been part of that group of eccentric planetoid. Eros, Love, and Adonis are of approx imately equal size. When calculating the effect of the impact of such errant ast eroid and, based on values established, the complete amount of destruction caused to his fall, we get that feeling of horror, which try to realize a huge danger, unexpected, the which, by a stroke of luck, it escaped, because, as mentioned above, in 1936 Adônis almost have reached the Earth. The context of its impact has deduce some information a bout the supposed orbit of the planetoid that fell in the Atlantic and therefore shoul d be called \"The planetoid. He came from the northwest, ie the side of the west. So passed the Earth in its rotation and its orbit around the Sun, because its speed was much gre ater than our planet. For this reason, its orbit must have been flat and elongat ed. This gives the characteristics of the group of Adonis. The approximation of small planetoid t he largest planet should have happened at a junction, ie at the point of intersec tion of two orbits. Therefore, the \"The planetoid\" come closer to Earth than Adonis in 1936, attracted by the gravitational forces land, he had distorted its orbit fo r a parable of decline, progressively more vertical. With this, their speed has increased proportionally, and must have reached at least 15 to 20 km p / second (speed relat ive to Earth), to penetrate the envelope of hydrogen. The intersection of its orbit with the earth must have been at an angle of approximately 30 °. A few 400 km of altitude, in light of hydrogen, must have appeared the reddish glow around her. The more it heated up, the more intense, targeted, has become its own brightness. The tail gas has risen to huge proportions. To precipitate on the surface of the Earth, the lethal radius must be much larger than any comet, giving a brightness to outshine t he sun itself The human eye spotted that must have been blind instantly. The tempera ture of its front face, exposed to strong wind resistance and therefore the more inten se heating, must have exceeded the limit of 20.000 °, giving a bright twenty to one hundred t imes the Sun's gases, pulled back, must have that giant cosmic look fantastic. W hen he entered the envelope of nitrogen and walked the last and most dense layer of a ir, heating and voltage collapse in the interior have become too much as to m ake it explode. Here, then, with his jacket several explosions in hard rock has become f ragmented into a number of non-lethal projectiles, which opened a groove of doom ov er the area southeast of North America. Only when I was in the vicinity of t he soil, also the core exploded with a bang, to which no human tympanum would be able to resis t. The two giants segments, with each weighing close to a billion tonnes , fell into the sea, huge waves rose to the sky and around the two impacts, a hangover of unimaginable proportions spread to all sides. If the height of waves was of some 10 km, was flooded up to the Mount Everest. Without doubt, the hangover caused a terrible destruction i n all coastal regions, which ruined any and all traces of civilizations antediluvia t hem. On the basis of the orbit can be reconstructed with reasonable accuracy, the traject ory of decline and the impact of planetoid, which must have been visible in the northwe st sky, like a parabolic arc from 800 to 1,000 km, rising on the horizon. That body that had bee n silently approaching and with the speed of thought, incandescent pieces fell on the earth, as if there were mangle it. All the spectacle of beauty barbaric, savage , should not be delayed for more than two minutes from the onset of first light in the sky, until the thunder of impact,"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" caused by the collapse of the core. Presumably, the thun der was heard throughout the land, minus the people inhabiting the range of the explosi on, every living being there died before coming to hear it. The light in the sky was visible for more than 2,000 kilom eters away. This was the awful phenomenon of fire, appeared in the night sky at the time of the flood, during the reign of King Foron mythical, and which to St. Augustine in his book \"De Civitate Dei\", based on the report of lost Adrastea and Diao and that would be powerful to the point of changing the orbit of Vesper, the star of the night? An event of such proportions, unimaginable consequences an d impact sensor so stunning must have been recorded in the memory of those who witnessed, leaving them with a terrible and indelible impression. So what unfor gettable experience that spoke to the posterior was not forgotten, like many other things . The characteristic shape of such images in memory was kept in myths because, besides the restoration objective, which always find, calculate and show important details, humanity has no evidence whatsoever, unless such mythical remnants, which shal l content itself. The myth of confrontation with the image obtained by the reconsti tution of the facts, or desvalor judge the value of both, revealing whether and to what ex tent, give or not give in its essence. What old people still remember and sent about, and little was retained to this day. In the West Indies, the Spanish conquest, in their zeal to convert the pagans to Christianity, destroyed almost everything that existed in real evidence, the Mayan codices, irreplaceable, dating from legendary times and ne ver deciphered, were almost completely destroyed. Two of the few existing reports, s peaking of celestial catastrophe, which, of course, do not deal in the style of a scientific report, but in language mythic, poetic, visual, are cited below. The Popul Vuh, reports that the \"god of the horror, Huraca n, flooded the earth while at the same time, the sky is observed a tremendous fire . This report gives and with the reconstitution of the facts, the person removing it fr om Huracan, avenger or punishment. Similarly the Arawak, Guiana, first recall that the Great Spirit punished with the fire and after they inflicted a terrible flo od, it can be discerned and the fall of the meteor strike caused by its impact, flooding the Guyan a. However Also, there is a legend in the East pre-Hellenic, like counting, but perhaps even more clearly. We talk about phaeton, which would drive the car of the sun, but t he horses of fire escaped his control and he came very close Earth, which burned in half and then was struck by lightning at sea, in Eridan. Very impressive is a passage in Chapter V of Book Chile Balam, highly significant, written in Mayan language but in Latin characters. The following is the text of that passage, removed the parables and allusions unintelligible, mythic, of secondary- importance: \"... This happened when the earth began to stir. Nobody knew what was to come. Fell a rain of fire fell ash, rocks and trees. Trees and ro cks were dropped ... and the Great Serpent was torn out of the sky ... and then your skin an d pieces of his bones precipitated on the earth ... and arrows hit orphans and old people, widows and widowers, who lived but had not strength enough to live. \" They were buried in the sands the beach.

Comes from the country near the coastal area hit by the meteor Carolina, so, give exact details of the fall of the meteor, which t here must have been sighted in all its"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" fullness. To avail himself of the comparative picture o f the Great Snake, torn from the sky, with extreme plasticity illustrates the appearance of the planetoid in fact similar to a body of snake, with the gases emanating from the fron t and forming the luminary. In his luminous career, overshadowed the brilliance of the sun, really should have had the appearance of a body of serpent, formed by stars and suns, giving the impression that the Milky Way, the Great Snake own Universal, were to rush on Earth to destroy it. Like a snake in mouth open, vomiting fire, the terrible cosmic phenomenon close to the world, suddenly disintegrated, when then \"... his skin and pi eces of his bones precipitated on the Earth . There is another comparison table to play with equal force and precision plastic demonstrating the phenomenon, for w hich description would hardly words? The planetoid A \"was just one among many of his fellow group of Adonis. All travel eccentric orbits and also all of them, time or anoth er, approaching Earth. And not always can count on the luck of humanity away from this approach in the same way as happy escaped in February 1936. The Tremendo tuck We just describe the fall of the meteor in the southwe stern North Atlantic, which caused the greatest and most terrible disaster of the kno wn myths of humanity. With the impact, entering the bottom of the bed Atlantic ba sin, the planetoid A \"no longer exists, was absorbed by the Earth, but the west has t o face horribly marked. The Russian astronomer Kulik reported that a column of fi re, 20 km in height, rose to open the meteor crater in taiga. However, despite this, in comparison with the mass and power of \"The planetoid,\" meteor that was a dwarf, a nothing. The mass of the meteor's taiga represented only the fraction of the tw o million that \"The planetoid\" of the meteor taiga precipitated on the Earth with a speed o f just over 1 to 1.5 km p / second, as can deduct the site of impact, approximately ci rcular, which indicates a nearly vertical trajectory of decline and therefore v ery bent, so may not have been covered with speeding. The planetoid A \"was certainly ten times faster, cons idering their history of approaching flat, elliptical, its coming from the West and impact angle in plan, indicated by the ellipsoid shape of the two abysses subma rines. Also, only a small fraction of his speed was lost in the Earth's envelope of air, while the meteor of the taiga, in his capacity as bolide smaller, there has sl owed much more sharply. In considering all these data, it follows that the force of impact and, with this feature of the magnitude scale of destruction caused, the \"planetoid th e\", topped by at least two hundred million times that of the meteor's taiga. What happened in 1947 in the virgin forests of Siberia, along the River Ienissei, while it was a disaster site, offers no point of comparison with what, eleven millennia ago, occurre d in the Atlantic. Only multiplied by two hundred million times, it could be conside red as a comparison. In 1908, the column of fire rose to 20 km above the surface, but once in the Atlantic, the cosmic fire, the proportions of a protuberance land, must have exceeded the edges of the envelope of air and the ionosphere. Multiply the mass with velocity, you get the momentum an d, thus, decisive for the size effect caused energy. The determined weight of approximatel y two billion tonnes (= weight), corresponds to about 200 tonnes quatrilhões (= mass ), multiplied by the speed of the order of about 20 km p / second, gives the momentum o f four tonnes quatrilhões p / second, a truly astronomical figure, comparable only in terms of values of"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":" magnitude astronomical equivalent. A high pulse can not have failed to exert dynamic influen ces on the rotation of the Earth, in pace. Although the stria marked in the earth's crust were greater, at about a billion times, the momentum of the impact alone could h ardly have been sufficient to speed up or slow down the rotation of the earth, not in a small measure, immeasurable. However, the planetoid, causing oblique impact, acted on th e rotation of the Earth, such as acting as a pebble on a pivot, turning slowly, an d, suddenly, it hit the top, oblique angle. How does, then the pivot? Way of stabilizing, starting to decrease their movement. Its axis starts to wobble, lose their position in the ve rtical plane on which is placed and evolves into a movement groggy. There was, in fact, th at the earth, or rather the earth crust, you stumble, at least since the end of the Quater nary. The route takes about 25,000 Earth years to make a move tottery, to complete a s ingle movement tottery, the Earth rotates on its axis by about nine million time s. Also the earth crust, in turn, has a pulse on the order of kilograms quatrilhão p / second, 250,000 tim es to overcome the impulses of the order of four trillion kg per second, calcul ated for the impact of \"The planetoid. According to the theory of the pivot, initial ly in the Earth rotation should complete a vacillating motion in the range of 250,000 days, i e approximately 700 years. How, meanwhile, the period of motion tottery i ncreased to 25,000 years, it was there that he was largely absorbed and slowed down by fo rces of internal friction, acting between the earth crust and its bearing of magma. The Earth will cease to stumble, with the angle of the opening of the pivot tott ery decreasing, gradually, because its rotation axis erect, for the work forces of friction. This whole process is co-influenced by the Sun and the Moon, whose gravitation al forces transmit tilting moments and, therefore, pulses of precession to Earth, is not exactly spherical, as is known, due to the bulge along the equator. The broadly, the movement of precession causing the frequency of the known solar stations, of co urse, in the early quintenário, this movement was more pronounced as today. In the first 700 years after the disaster, this movemen t tottery caused an imbalance in the Van Allen belt. This belt consists of two zones , in the form of shell, involving the Earth and have high intensity of radiation, the cause o f this is in the earth magnetic field. The Van Allen belt absorbs the proton-rich energy, fr om solar-Rance protube, this absorption occurs primarily in the inner shell, from a n altitude of 3200 km above the earth's surface. The second shell, and more foreign, wi th a sinuosity almost elliptical in transverse direction against the sun, it extends from 16, 000 km above the Earth, to within 50,000 kilometers of the universe. Only in terrestr ial magnetic poles, the tip of the Van Allen belt reaches up to 320 km within the ionosph ere. As a result of disturbances in the Van Allen belt, the Earth is important graciously exposed to solar storms and the resulting hard radiation. This means that a larger number of atoms of nitrogen is converted to carbon iso topes, thus enriching the radioactive carbon in the atmosphere. However, even w ith some delay, this may contribute to the restructuring tabilização of terrestr ial magnetic field from outside. As the movement tottery weakened, the Van Allen belt managed to resume their protective function, intensifying it proportionately. To day, the problem ceased to be important, as meanwhile the period for the implementati on of a single movement tottery is increasing for 25,000 years, but still do not kno w for sure what the consequences would have been caused in the first thousand y ears after the disaster. Or- trora, the periodicity of the seasons was related to a n intensity of radiation at least"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" different, but certainly more dangerous than the present. It is unknown if this existed in the Quaternary period. O nly based on the hypothesis of Laplace, unproven and unlikely, it is assumed that the sola r system was stable, allowing only small variations of orbital elements more or l ess of certain values. Strictly speaking, one would assume that, to the north of the isot herms to zero degree, the formation of ice and their conservation would be possib le only when there was no interference of the periods of the heat of summer. In summary, during the Quaternary changes in temperature influenced the change of seasons h ave been lower than they are today. It would be the case, then assumed that the positi on of the earth axis on the ecliptic be reasonably vertical, in just slightly obli que angle. In all likelihood, the Quaternary this angle was much smaller than today. The modern value is around 23 ° 27 'and is currently declining in some 47 \"(ie 0.785\") per century, this would correspond to 0.013 ° per century, or a decrease of 1 in 7,630 years. But this gradual reduction is the theory of the piv ot, pivot groggy as all, including the Earth, makes the building, where the frictio n forces act in the plane on which he is placed. For the pivot-toy, these forces ar e generated by friction between its tip and the surface on which is, in case of pivot-Earth , which is accompanied only by barge envelope of rock, but not the melting pot and not by the core gas, these forces are generated by friction between the envelope of rock and the magma inside. Therefore, one would expect that, apparently, at the begi nning of quintenário the ecliptic obliquity maximum was first accelerated and then decrease slowly as the friction decreased. When extended backwards, the line repr esenting the ecliptic obliquity, as a function of time elapsed since the beginn ing of quintenário not turns into a straight line but a curve in mild slope, gradually vertic al. The tremendous tuck, ending the fourth time the great sympho ny land, made the Earth wobble and shake, do not know in how many degrees, but the humanity in recorded memory that singular event. Proves it to legend, the my th that in most cases usually transmit the primitive man's religious knowledge, by mean s of images, reflecting cosmic experience. To do so, or should go in search of evidence between the red-skinned people living near the site of the disaster because they were too i mpressed with the all-burning fire and the waves beat the all-enveloping that followed, or is, with the immediate consequences of the impact of the planetoid in the Atlan tic coast. These consequences caused horror least the people who inh abited the most remote areas, but was still a tremendous psychological impact suf fered by them. They experienced in the flesh the other consequences of trem endous tuck, which kept in memory, yet you know that in time, the earth quake and th e whole sky out of his celestial order, perennial, with the turmoil that he w ent. Especially those memories is part of the legend above ph aeton. Only in a poetic matamorfose, later, the hero is presented as the son of the god of the sun, but Homer and even pre-Homeric poets have it as phaeton, the light , the very adjective Helium. But what would, in reality, the mythical-allegorical im age of the car's sun, leaving its track through the sky to fire half the Earth, the close r to her too? Does this mean that the divinity, guiding the car, was hit by lightning of Zeus , bright as a meteor, because this is what its name says, fell on the earth and wa ters of Eridan, the mythical river of the West? This image shows a mythical cosmic disorder, whose res toration is perfectly feasible. For a man in touch with nature, instinct driven geocent ric, the earth is a solid disc, on which rests the sky. Axis land, ending with the lodestar , is the pivot around which"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" turns the sky. Your crystal ball bears the epicycle of cycles and planetary orbits, which also includes the sun slanting With elliptical-ca very l ow, this framework remains relatively constant year after year, representing a w ide constituency, including an angle with the horizon , equal to the degree of latitude. Even when you feel that the Earth received a strong push, the stronger the coming of an ear thquake, do not have the impression of being the land tremble and stagger, but the sky, the transparent dome, with its non-number of stars flashing, shudder and wobble was. When the sun seems to stumble through the sky, this phenomenon illustrates the result of a telluric disturbances, described by observers naive so subjective and correct, but incorrectly transposed into the sky and seen as a shift from solar orbit. In memory, confused is these two events, the car's sun groggy and fall of meteo r, not immediately visible in the land of the East, but then released by rumors as to be commingled in one. This is the final part of the myth, showing phaeton, hit by lightni ng and the sun falling from the car Also, the epic Vòluspá, singular poem, decanted from time r emotíssimos gods, pre- Germanic, and that in the Middle Ages was still recited in Iceland, provides clear and objective evidence in respect of our subject. As foresh adowed in the initial verse, this epic relates the earliest history of humankind, not all of humanity, of course, but only part of which descended from the divine mythical, alleged author of the poem. Says: Verse II - First was the time when Ymir lived. There was no sand nor sea nor salt wave, not found the earth, the sky or in the highest. I t was a big emptiness in the grass grew anywhere. Verse III - Until the sons of Bur raised the turf, she created the Mid-gard, the legend. The sun shone on the south face of the stone battleme nts. The ground was green, with green porro. Verse IV - The South, the sun, companion of the Moon, moved in with the right hand edge of the sky. The Sun did not know about their rooms, th e Moon did not know its strength. The stars did not know their address ... Verse II describes the time period of the primitive Quat ernary, the stages of glaciation. That is the view of the large empty, sparkling, the ice sheet covering the frozen land and sea of uniformly white-gray sky with its clouds of sn ow that, without horizon, is confused with the Earth. The two following verses descr ibe the cosmic and telluric changes, ending the era of glaciation and introducing a new era. The sons of Bur, deities of the new era that, in another epic kill Ymir , the giant of the snow, in which blood drown the world of giant glaciers, raise the piece, is the memory of the earthquake, they pose under the layer of ice, which then discards and back to Scandinavia. The soil of the land, now free of ice, i t is green, under the rays of the sun, rising to the south, set up the \"Legend of Midgard.\" Verse IV implements the barge, the lift and shake the e arth. The sun, the moon and the stars wanders aimlessly, with no fixed location, with out addresses defined. This means that left to their apparent orbits, geocentric, and enga ged in new directions. When the Earth wobble, we Earthlings, the universe with all it s stars is stagger. A glance to the night sky shows the stars as fixed, espe cially in the polar region, this means that from then transferred their orbits, trave ling spherical orbits, recognizable around the celestial pole. When leaving their fixed loca tions, their chairs of crystal, we always spherical, to another place, around another cele stial pole. Therefore, the verse IV describes the process of displacement of the celesti al pole. Indeed, the celestial pole is a point that exists only in our subjective imagination, it marks the supposed meeting fictitious axis of rotation of the Earth, infinitely long, the"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" apparent sky. To go to the supposed celestial pole, which ac tually moves is the center of rotation of the earth and sky is the shaft to wobb le and shake, toward a new equilibrium level, as we think, but the earth axis. This enigmatic verse, evidence of natural invaluable, gi ven by a witness naive, eye, only describes the displacement of the earth axis and the be ginning of a precession at least intensified. The verse of stanza II IV illustrates th is with the example of Sun Suddenly, the sun is pushed to its elevation to the celestial hor izon (edge of the sky) in order to give the impression that, in the fall, is looking for s upport in edge firm. The contingency of the Sun is quote as \"companion of the Moo n\" could be an indication of the constellation of the new moon, in which the Sun and the Moon known, the latter growing in close, appear side by side. In turn, also the reports of phenomena metaphysical Bib le often tend to use mythic imagery, which could have been inspired by cosmic events . In this sequence of ideas comes to mind the fall of the angels. Its text is wel l known, Lucifer, the most beautiful and strong among the angels originally created, it rebell ed against God, Creator, and a revolution sky, tried to dethrone the Almighty, this att empt led to the fall of Lucifer and his supporters of the darkest and deepest abysses of Hel l. The Old Testament makes reference to a single connection, in Isaiah, 14, 12-15, at the same time, a prophecy related to Babylon and its kings, whose fate woul d be equal to the primitive \"Princes of the Earth\": \"How caíste from heaven, O shining star, who birth t he day shone How caíste by land, that you rent the nations? Say that in your heart: th e sky upstairs, set my throne above the stars of God, sit I will mount on the alliance (l ocated) to the sides of the Aquilão. surpass the height of the clouds, be like the Most High. A nd yet, you were precipitated into hell, to the deepest abysses. \" The revolt of the renegade angels under Lucifer, strongly recalls legends like Greek, talking on the revolt of the giants in the rebellion o f alóades, the struggle between gods and Titans. There, the lightning and thunder of the sky god decide the fight, the giant Tifa, and alóades are down, fall down, are buried beneath volcanoes. Could pass unnoticed by the link between these narratives , exaggerated to the point of becoming myths, and objective reporting of the fall of \"The planetoid? If this assumption is correct, then the story of the \"Fall of the Angels\" close the memory of the Atlantis disaster, killing the island of Atlantis, the sinking account in visual language, pictorial. Considering all these factors and assessing the myths o f objective way, without prejudices, it admitted that the popular legends send an event , susceptible to be reconstituted in fact, language in plastic, multicolored, b ut not for this less subjectively true and correct. Also, should not be surprising the fact to use their own terminology that eleven millennia ago, was obviously different fro m our current way of talking. The explosive charge of Cosmo In the area of impact of the meteor taiga, a column of fire rose to 20 km altitude. Kulik, the sober Russian scientist, described the fall o f the meteor disaster and described its effects posterity. However, in considerin g this description with strict objectivity, recalculated their data, figures are obtain ed by a somewhat disappointing for the modern man, accustomed to the effects caused by atomic bombs. Kulik indicates the weight of the taiga and the meteor wa s about one million tonnes, its velocity of impact must have been about 1 km / second. Th ere are assumptions on the"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" strength of their impact on the order of about 50,000 km / t or 5.1010 m / kg, with the value a bit of heat passing 100 million calories. In order to obtain similar local effect, it must employ some 75 t of nitroglycerin, which represent l ess than one hundredth of the force developed by an atomic bomb, the type A. However, what was the meteor of the taiga in comparis on with \"The Panetóide? The mass of the latter was at least 200 billion tonnes (= mass), its speed of fall, conditional on Earth, was 20 km p / second and therefore the force of impact was 20 billion tons kilometer ( MKG = 2.1019), with heat value of more than 40 b illion calories. To achieve the same explosive effect, it needs to detonat e, or 30 four trillion tons of nitroglycerine, or in the event that it is estimated one million tonnes of explosives equal to the destructive force of a modern hydrogen bomb, this would represent the total impact of 30,000 atomic bombs, launched in highly concentrat ed bombing. The full force of the impact of \"The planetoid\" may be taken as being equal to 2.1019 or 4.1016 MKG calories and this huge amount energy was represe nted by an explosive charge from the cosmos, where it has its ignition , w hich penetrated deeply into the soil land. Of total load, the jacket was half rock and half o f the nucleus. Therefore, each of the two segments representing the core disintegrated, it took about a fourth part and each of the 10,000 fragments of the disintegrated casing, a t wentieth part of a thousandth of the total load. Let us these fragments, which opened this terrible trac k impact of destruction, called the field of craters Carolina and whose origin is attr ibuted to the meteor Carolina. The fall of each fragment of size - any attempt at re covery can only operate with values - had the force of impact of approximately one billion MKG on an average surface area of 200,000 m2, so there was an impact of around 5 quatrilhões of MKG p/m2. In the case of the meteor's taiga, the area destroyed by the impact and the formation of flames, as described, had a diameter of about 20 km, ie, ar ea of some 300 km2, or 300 million m2, even assuming that the total area only one third party was hit by the meteor bombardment, it would still 100 million m2. As calculated ab ove, the energy of impact was 50,000 tkm, ie 50 quatrilhões of MKG, therefore, only 500 MK G (p/m2) fit the square meter of surface, which represents only the value 1/5.000.000 Comparative assigned to \"The planetoid. The amount of energy of impact is much more interesting to show that the disaster in West Siberia and it was so horrible like this. The energy density of the meteor of taiga, which barely reached 1/ 5.000, was well below that of developed by a grenade cannon of that campaign, shot in dir ect, hits a target next. However, with \"The planetoid\", this energy was two tho usand times greater, considering only the fall of fragments of the shell of rock. It turns out that the density of energy, also called the ballistic coefficient, is the decisive factor in the strength of penetration of a missile ce lestial or terrestrial. The fragments should open in soil depths of the craters are measured in kilometers. It was only at that depth that found its point of rest, and in each case ioso lado, the effect lasted only a few seconds. At that moment, nothing or almost nothing of the heat of friction, generated and stored in the front face of the projectile sky, could be divert ed. The heat then concentrated enough to heat the entire sky rocket up to 4000 ° C. However, due to the time of impact, very short, almost all the heat was concentr ated in a narrow edge of the front, where the local heating should have exceeded the 10,000 °. Th e great light, radiated by the missile within the earth, can be inferred from t he fact that the temperature on the solar surface is of only 6000 ° C, which represents up to o ne tenth, but probably only a hundredth the brightness of the light source invisible ."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" No material substance could withstand an attack of this magnitude heat; disintegrate its structure would be and at the same time evaporates. Back, toward the opening, the exhaust gases unbridled were barred by the wreckage of the missile, locked deep in the soil. Therefore, the destructive power of the cloud of ga s, hot and inimaginavelmente under enormous pressure, it must be taken not to run down, b ut to the sides. At these forces, the action so sudden, gave up the underground strata o f granite and dunito then deformed as if they were to pitch. With the expansion o f the gas, huge holes opened up, at great depths within the earth, drilling the substrat e, which was equal to the consistency of a sponge. In view of this, it is underst ood that the coastal area most affected in the Southeast, was completely fractured and b ecame underwater, it was mercilessly drilled, both from above as below. But also the area where the soil weathered, suffered ho rribly. Apparently, there are the impacts were not as concentrated, perhaps, the bombing h ad to be less heavy. In any case there have not yielded the base. However, when t he few gases escaped, or their gradual cooling, is precipitated on the walls of the huge unde rground caividades the contrapres shall, acting in low and contributing to the conservation of structure, also began to sell. However, the top layer, capped once more due to the action of mud and peat, the supply of filling material should not be slow to show the typical framework of the current \"Carolina bays\", and rests with all its w eight on the substrate seriously shaken. Was then beginning the recovery process geologica l, promoting reprocessing and stabilizing the soil strata destroyed, today, more t han eleven millennia after the disaster, this process is not finished yet, thus the ma gnitude of the immense cataclysm. Tectonic tremors continue to shake the area, still no t fully recovered. At any point where there is collapse of edges of cavities underground, m aking the danger fragilíssimo balance the earth's crust, so severely da maged. Therefore, the city of Charleston, located right in t he middle of the field of craters (Fig. 36) and the edge of the strip of land kept intact, is the ce nter of such tectonic tremors. The Figure 38 shows the gradient of the intensity of the movement of soil during the tectonic earthquake, recorded on August 31, 1896. The comparison o f these two figures reveals the identity of the area of seismic tr emors in the field of craters, the range of explosion, caused by the impact of the collapse of the housing of the rock planetoid. However, if the two abysses submarines, the force of impact was immeasurably greater. There was the collapse of the two core segmen ts, with each weighing half a billion tonnes, each developing a force of impact of ab out 2.5 billion tons kilometer, each reaching an area of some 10 million m2, or is an e nergy density of the order of some 250,000 tonnes kilometer per m2, corresponding to 2.510 mkg/m2. T his value exceeds one hundred thousand times in the corresponding fact or of a gun campaign, and one hundred times that of a fragment of the envelope of rock's planetoid. The ratio allows for a quantitative conclusion about th e approximate depth of impact. Underneath the Atlantic Ocean, the earth crust is not very resistant, its thickness, certainly no more than 40 km. Undoubtedly there was a cle ar drilling. Under tremendous tuck, the skin tore tense beat where the two sticks. Today, after eleven millennia of geological healing of reprocessing and surfac e flooding, the depth of the two gaps is still of 7 km. However, do not know the latest deep, holding the fragment s of the core of the meteor. Perhaps, like most of the bodies of their gender , it was of ferro-nickel.

It is worth mentioning here that Charles Berlitz wro te in his book \"The OF BERMUDA TRIANGLE\", regarding the possible existence of vast energy complex, within that area.

But then, even should revert to the timing given by the Codex Troanus. Even if the destruction caused by the impact and underground de tonation of explosive charge, from the cosmos, had elapsed from the above way , in any case was not yet the Atlantis catastrophe itself, but its introduction, the spark that led to its ignition . During a single day and one night unchancy ill ... As reported by Kulik, the meteor of taiga not only caused even greater damage because the energy density of its impact was relatively low because, it stressed this point, fell on a region uninhabited, deserted, which reac hed a dollop of SIAL, perfectly intact, powerful and almost indestructible strength. Also , according to the calculations of Kulik, if his fall was delayed by four hours, the city of St. Petersburg would have been reached. Then this event, which received little attention at the time, was recorded by the annals of history as a disaster of horrific pr oportions. However, that history refuses to take note of a ca-taclismo still much larger and well documented, the result was reconstituted in all its phases. The planetoid the \", and incomparably faster, although vo lume had a mass greater than its tiny Siberian congener, which was over five hundre d million, about the density of energy in the region of impact. The most serious was th e fact of not having achieved a perfect dollop of SIAL; wanted the inevitability of cha nce that fall precisely on one of the most vulnerable, sensitive and less resistant the earth's crust, that line of fracture, dotted the volcanoes, the remaining old line, the time pre-tertiary to the Atlantic basin extends between the tectonic plates of the Old and New World, called the dorsal Atlantic. The dorsal, before a division of that connection, thr ough all the vast area between the volatile island of Jan Mayen in the North to the isl and of Tristan da Cunha, to the south in an area of great instability, under a line of colla pse, existing from time so remote, the solidified part of the earth crust, the texture of SIAL, is much more fragile and thinner than in any other point. Here the zone of fusion with the magma to the surface is more generally only 15 to 20 km inland as indicated by the large n umber of volcanoes in the local wells and whose reach pockets of magma and lava co ntaining strata. By virtue of its content of water vapor and carbon dioxide, there, e verywhere, the igneous area is under high enough pressure inside such a well, to design the w asher to an altitude of Mount Everest.

That was the shield pierced by the collapse of two segme nts of the core of \"The planetoid. The two craters, open to the impact, it was huge volcanic wells; igneous reached those depths and with a tremendous tuck has been th e detonation of powerful explosive charge of the cosmos, as the destructive power of 30,000 hydrogen bombs. The comparison, then, might give an idea of what this w ould mean. The Earth, with its shield from 40 to 50 km thick, is simi lar to a high pressure boiler, built of sheets of thin gauge steel. Moreover, the plate s are not welded in their joints, which would be a factor for strengthening, but riveting, which is a weakening factor. Its edges are riveted to the lines of rupture and break the earth's crust. The impact of the meteor was the taiga as a lightweight hammer to hi t the center of such a steel plate, it resonated but resisted the impact. Moreover, the fal l of \"The planetoid\" acted on the earth crust as a way of projectile, launched from the m outh of a cannon, had reached the boiler, and a hole next to the rivet, and from th at point, would have damaged the whole riveted. What would happen to a boiler, subject to such harsh treatment? Well, the riveted not resist more damage to internal pressure, unchanged, but give high- pressure boiler and explode. Similarly the cauldron exploded under the Atlantic basin, where the impact of nuclear segments of \"The planetoid\" caused the first and decisive hole in the zone of rupture in the dorsal Atlantic. Rumble, then the chords of an inaugural concert Hell. Im mediately, through the newly formed two wells, the fiery magma, carnation, rose wi th incredible speed and is mixed with other liquids overlapped, until reaching the waters of the Atlantic. With this, created the preconditions for a volcanic eruption, underwa ter, in the largest possible proportions. She opened the rivet of the cauldron, which sold under such pressure. The seabed broke up in south-north direction. All volcanoes t here came into activity, with new wells, formed at the time, projecting the fiery la va. Tremendous shock into the underground fires and the sea, where the mixed-magma and ste am. Between two continents, the earth threw up fire from the volcano of Beerenberg, on the island of Jan Mayen in the north and the island of Tristan da Cunha, the South All this must have happened with tremendous speed, equal to a radius.

In the chain reaction, this volcanic disaster continued along the li ne of rivet, launching uninterrupted mass of magma and water in the infernal bat tle the elements. The length of that hell may even be calculated with re asonable accuracy. Supposed that this process had continued along the line of rupture, with speed equal to that measured in soil cracks, appearing also in tremors of low and medi um intensity, we obtain an approximate speed of about 15 mp / second. The length of the line of rupture was about 3000 km, from the point of impact, toward the North, s ince only this section applicable to our subject. Therefore, the whole catastr ophe could have continued for two, maximum three days, to destabilize the entire are a between Puerto Rico and Iceland. Within 24 hours, the explosion must have reached the point to the South Atlantic small chunk, where the line break, then solid, is divided into two almost parallel, around the Atlantic-of the West and East. Eac h of these branches was 1.200km, and therefore the disaster must have taken a day and a night at most, to visit them. With this, the whole island was stuck in a loop o f fire. Around it, the fund was open ocean, the earth crust underlying broken and, everywh ere, the magma, bright,"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" red, emerged from depths to mix with the waters of the A tlantic. The water vapor generated in the process, the condensed m agma, mixed with it, in tiny droplets, which then were cool and were turned into ashe s, so the heat transferred to steam, which overheated, rose with incredible speed and , with its cloud-shaped pine trees, has unimaginable amounts of igneous products well be yond the troposphere, to the regions where the clouds blink of silver within the ionosphere. On the entire area is plagued formed clouds of steam and ash, the size of contine nts, and with them, enormous quantities of magma in the form of ash, pumice a nd lapíli were transported to the higher areas of the atmosphere. There is another example for such underwater volcanic e xplosion, although of a much smaller but historically recognized and quantitatively re constituível, namely the eruption of Krakatoa in the Strait of probe, on 26 and 27 Augus t, 1883. By that time, the volcano island was designed to air, with two thirds of the island's soil, the pressure of seawater. The island had a total area of 33 km2 and the area affected by volcanic eruption was about 20 km2. The amount of volcanic products, des igned by the eruption was estimated at 50 to 100 km3, or 3 to 4 km3/km2 surface, corresponding to 3 to 4 km in height, struck out the lava, which then cover ed the active surface in the form of a cube. The disaster was an Atlantic underwater volcanic explos ion, such as the Krakatoa, but in proportions incomparably greater. Despite this and a m ere precaution, the following only operate with specific figures, computed for the last eruption recorded by history. When estimated at some 4,000 km - including that involving th e bifurcation Atlantis - the total length of the line of collapse in the North Atlantic volcanic area with a width of 100 to 150 on average 125 km, results in vomiting fire with s urface area approximately half a million square kilometers. If the a verage of the projected mass of lava has not exceeded that registered with the eruption o f Cracatoa, then the volume of magma would have been 1.5 to 2 million cubic kilometers, wi th a minimum weight of 5 tonnes quatrilhões. These figures are still subject of m ajor exhibitions later. For now treat only to monitor and replenish the disaster Atlan tic until his gruesome end. As the line continued to break open up, new bodies of magma and water vapor and gases have to incorporate to the overall volume of the particulars awakened to the disaster. Bodies of magma from deep and continued appearing in places where new, fought against the Atlantic zone of fire, which left, incessantly, new steam and ash. All that rose from the bowels of the earth was taken to the highest atmospheric layers, by virtue of evaporation of sea water and water vapor then released by the magma before it was absorbed. Thus the eruption underwater literally l aunched the magma from the depths of the Earth atmosphere. In turn, the storms caus ed by the eruption have continued that transport. The volcanic masses, shipped to the altitude, not dropped on the area which they were raised, moreover, the explos ion resulted in the entire Atlantic volcanic region from which the magma ascended to heaven , a significant lowering of the level of magma, difficult replacement . Under the At lantic basin is a depression formed from magma, the depth and variety that has become deeper in the site of bifurcation of the line of rupture, which involved the t wo chunk of Atlantis. Ali depression must have attained its maximum depth. Supposed that the center's internal disaster, during the terrible tragedy, staged by nature are not able to calculate the projection above the registered with the eruption of Kra katoa, in much lower intensity, the lowering of the magma from the depth of depression ca used the total dispersion of volcanic products, should have reached 3 or 4 km. Thus, throughout the turf around the island, the magma, form ing the substrate of"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" Simon, was scattered, lost and, in the form of ash, de signed for high atmosphere. With this began the last act of the drama, with the main pr otagonist of the turf SIAL, anchored in the substrate of Simon. As the island was relatively small and very mobile, she had to follow the mind-isostatic lowering the leve l of its bed of magma. The rate of sinking was not very great because the whole process too k about 24 hours, concluding there is a sinking speed of the order of 4 to 5cm w / seco nd. The most likely is that when the island of Atlantis began to sink, all living o n its soil had been killed, terminated by the disaster heralds end for toxic gases, and macaréus storms. The imaging sequence (Fig. 39) illustrates this drama, in three typical end of act, with comments. To discontinue the new waves of lava, becaus e of the simultaneous evaporation of sea water, which reduced the volume of ne w supplies of water vapor and lava, just to the thunder of explosions and eruptions b egan to decline. The red area, incandescent, began to close up and even before be coming black, was flooded by the Atlantic, whose waters, even you-bilantes up in va pors and new graduates, returned to his bed, then reformed. Its waves hit, clos ing on the place, even the day before, a large island with high mountains and magnificen t structures. The soil of this island had sunk 3km, which is right in the middle of the depre ssion, exactly on the old line of fracture, the dorsal Atlantic, entremen-ing cl osed and dressed with the magma out of hell submarine. Tenacity of the pitch, once the depression holds the island of Atlantis in its new location. And so it continues, unt il today, just like that massive submarine ground floor, the extension genetically incompr ehensible and enigmatic, the dorsal Atlantic, leaving only nine shows the islets, whose strands naked, covered in lava, emerge on the waves of the ocean . Are the Azo res Islands and between them becomes the Gulf, now clear, towards Europe. The island which then block the passage of the Gulf, for cing its return to North America, was submerged, was swallowed by depression in th e magma. However, the conformation of depression should not be imagined as that of a ditch on the fringes of the road because it is shallow, in that place, the Atl antic Ocean has at least 1500 km wide, on each side of the dorsal Atlantic. The proportio n between these two halves oceanic and maximum depth of depression is 500:1, this means that lowering the minimum was recorded as the level of the magma decreased from almost imperceptible way, from the edges of the turf island, toward the cente r of the Atlantic basin. Therefore, the depression is shallow, not enough for peo ple to rely on reprocessing of forces, capable of one day reerguerem the island submerged, bringing it to the surface ocean. Is Plato be right also in the way described as a disast er? Thus, it follows that passage so often challenged or mock of his narrative, saying: \"However, later, when survivor tremendous earthquakes and terrible floods, during a single day and one night unchancy ill, died in that land al l your valuable generation, the example of how the island of Atlantis disappeared, plunged to the bottom of the sea''. Earthquakes, floods, soil cracks, landslides, lowering of t he seabed, these are also the key phenomena that accompanied the disaster Atlantis, in his model of restoration objective. In this regard, this model gives reconstituti on with Platonic narrative. However, the words of the text so that fussabout up and o nly has some typical features of a geological revolution on Earth, as advocated by Cuvi er, and was so violently contested by the circles concerned. What is disputed, part icularly, the phrase: \"... during a single day and one night ...\", specify the time in terval assumed for the duration of the disaster.

However, once these explosions reached the second point of the fork to the north of the island, where the re-involving the t wo arms, his subsequent pursuit, heading north, toward the island of Jan Mayen, did not ca use any further reduction in the region of the Azores. Soon, the sinking of the turf island must have been closed with the arrival of the explosion in the second point of bifurcation, located to the north, so continued as the first explosions continued until the second of these two points. The distance to be traveled was about 1,200 km. Calculating with a speed of 15m p / second, the whole process took just 24 hours, or \"one day a nd one night unchancy ill\", in which took place the beginning and end of the sinking of the turf island called Atlantis. The Effects of Post Disaster of Atlantis Products of Volcanic Projection Under the aspect vulcanology, the catastrophe now Atlant ic reconstituted in its details was a submarine eruption of immense proportions. Has bee n described in its processes partial, immediate, now, will address the effects later . These effects have been demonstrated in much smaller pr oportions in the fall of the meteor taiga in size considerably smaller. Are conditi oned to the quantities of dust and rocks, volcanic or meteoric, designed for atmospheric al titudes, by virtue of their eruption, or the impact caused by the collapse of the met eor. The projection of these products has generated side effects such as rain of ash, r ain of blood, the silver clouds, and the \"bright red\". Moreover, the explosion of Krakato a was made even more impressive, caused a tremendous strike, which destroyed eve rything in its passage through the vast extent of the ocean from the Cape of Good Hope to Cape Horn, or half of the world . With the shock that hit the air w as compressed to the point of exploding with crack size to be heard in Alice Springs, Aus tralia, the 3.600km away, and Rodriguez Island, 4800 kilometers away from the scene of the disaster. The wave of air thus generated should be given no less than three laps around the globe. However, who would have heard the rumble of thunder, acco mpanied by the Atlantis disaster? Certainly was heard by all mankind existing at the time of the cataclysm. But the reports did not deserve the respect and credit were ri diculed as fables. Also, we may say with certainty that the history never recor ded another fall of meteor or volcanic eruption of proportions equal to those taken by t he Atlantis disaster that just restore. This also applies to the calculation of volca nic products designed in its result. As calculations made, five quatriihões tons of magma wer e released during that cataclysm. This value arithmetic can be controlled by a simple calculation. Undoubtedly, in recent geological period, the ocean bottom between the island of Jan Mayen and the South Atlantic fillister suddenly in some miles. Nansen found the Arctic Sea a lowering of the order of 1 to 2 km, in the Azores, that lowering the level was found as matter of 3 to 4 km. Ali depression in the Atlant ic basin of Simon can be determined, so insofismável through surveys of echo. How ever, as in its raw state the magma is liquid, tends to remain at equipotential plane, ie to form a surface without depressions, spherical or ellipsoid of rotation. Therefo re, the depression does not rise steadily, by the work of kinetic microforças because th ese, by contrast, would have led"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" to its elimination, since the tendency of these forc es would have been to promote the reprocessing of the affected area, causing it to return i ts original plan equipotential. As the depression may not have been formed gradually with the slow flow of magma dispersed, its volume should be reduced by dispersion and trans port of magma to any one else. The total volume of five quatrilhões tonnes, as established, is 1.5 to 2 million cubic kilometers, imagine if this total, in the form o f parallelepiped, pile on the basic tier of the North Atlantic, covering about 50 million s quare kilometers one gets an average height of 1 / 25 km or about 40 m. The North Atlanti c has a total area of about 5000 x 10,000 km, comparing the average height of the volume with this scattered wide, the smaller of the two steps above, yo u get the proportion 1:125.000. Therefore, it is a very small scale indeed, and hardly anyone will be out of the question considering the fact that, during the biggest volcanic disa ster in history, deposits of magma, inimaginávelmente extensive under the earth's cr ust, would have suffered losses sufficient to correspond to a lowering of approxim ately 40 on average. In this regard and he controlled, our calculation is well within the possible and probable. Assumed that the calculation above is accepted as correc t, could provide quantitative information of the proportions and order of disturbance i n terrestrial life, caused by products designed for these eruptions. A catastrophe of nature that occurred ten millennia ago, generates three main groups of volcanic products of projection, namely gas, water an d lava. Let's start with the lava, as to whether there are already elements allowing its quantitative calculation. As mentioned elsewhere, were 1.5 to 2 million km3, weighing approximately 5 tons quatrilhões cie solid products, in large blocks, flakes of ash and fine dust. The water vapor transport to the highest laye rs of the atmosphere. Moreover, the water vapor is always the main product in all volcanic activity, including being the home underwater. To lift and carry those alti tudes quatrilhões five tons of lava, it calculate the water bodies in the volume of a t least four times its weight, or twenty quatrilhões tonnes, respectively, 20 million km3.

Thus, bodies of water for both n ot available in the North Atlantic, was met by the South Atlantic Therefore, t he surface of the ocean level has no depression to form, for example as formed in the str ata of basic magma in process of sudden cooling. However, the comparison is the amount of 20 million km3 of water, as established, which would have evaporated and he brought 2 million km3 of magma, on the one hand, with the Earth's water reserves, to taling 2,400 million km3, the other hand, comes to the conclusion that a tiny portion of t hat total, or 120 shares, were engaged in that disaster. However, until these bodies of water returned to the sea in the world, its level dropped, temporarily, up to 40 m, during a few weeks. Then the water must have risen a little beyond your normal level, bec ause the absorption of water, released by the magma, would strengthen the terrestrial water cycle. Although these processes of compensation, in itself, we re very impressive, had no resonance in the legends of the deluge, which is explaine d by the fact the people, witnesses that disaster, received and recorded in memory impressions very strong and terrifying. The last of the three groups of products mentioned is the gas eruption. In addition to water vapor, already mentioned, consist mainly of carb on dioxide (or better, carbon dioxide, C02), and in suffocating gases such as vapors of sulf ur and sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid and ammonia salt, and chlorides of iro n and copper, boric acid compositions of cyanogen and many others. Among these, the highly rarefatíveis components, such as carbonic acid, sulfuric acid and hydroge n chloride, are the most dangerous, because they spread over large distances and affe ct with its heat and toxicity to humans and animals. Especially the non-combustible gases and carbonic acid ga s under the pressure of magma were directed to a distant target in the ozone lay er, between 32 and 48 km altitude. These layers of ozone plays vital role in te rrestrial life, protecting the earth against harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun, from short waves to absorb them. Therefore, compared with the upper and lower layers of th e neighboring regions, the ozone always have higher temperatures. The effects of interference in the ozone layers of the earth were felt after only a few centuries of the disaster. The UV influenced terrestria l life in survivors of the disaster about to change its genetic code. In December 1919, Day and his colleagues analyzed the gases expelled by Halemaumau crater in Monte Kiliauea (Hawaii), fairly t ypical for the composition of volcanic gases, and therefore also of the gaseous compon ents of products designed for the disaster Atlantis. Here is their analysis: Percentage of weight Carbonic acid ........................ 42.9 Nitrogen .................................. 25.8 Water .......................................... 27.5 Sulfur dioxide .................... 3.7 It was found that the gases containing one and half time s more carbonic acid to water"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" vapor. Estimating the percentage of absorption of water released by the magma to be scattered on a per thousand of marine water vapor, there is minus a percentage of weight of the order of 1.5 per thousand of carbonic acid co ntained in the volume engaged in global water catastrophe. As this volume was a bout 20 quatrilhões tonnes, the percentage of carbonic acid reached to 30 billion ton s, or three times the total volume of carbonic acid in the air today. These data can deduce that with the disaster Atlântida we re released large quantities of gases asphyxiants, since a cubic meter of carbonic aci d weighs about 2 kg, only with the gas it would quatrilhões of 15 cubic meters. But this wa s still low compared to the overall atmosphere of the total represents only a so- thousandth. Moreover, not only were the three quatrilhões tons of volcanic ash, found for the North Atlantic, and thus that terrible black clouds were directed to the east. We re also accompanied by no fewer than twenty quatrilhões tons of water, in the f orm of wet steam, pregnant with rain, which, together with the particles of magma, wer e designed to air during the disaster. These numerous tiny particles and crystallites of the salt, always originate with the evaporation of sea water, form nuclei for co ndensation, ideal for the drops of rain, hail them on the water vapor, in the process of gradual cooling. Thus, the projected ash, rich in salt content, with the sea wat er that followed, is a likely source of an unimaginable natural rainfall over vast areas of wi lderness. As mentioned above, the winds from the West, predominantly in high latitudes, lea ding to the east and on the plate tectonics of the Old World the cloud, threatening, dyed black from the ashes, while the monsoon of East led them on the regions tro pical New World. Thus, two regions rise up characteristics of rainfall, stage of t he scenes of horror, perpetuated the legend of the deluge, which arose between the peoples inha biting the regions affected. With this, our recovery has reached a point long the sub ject of debate and because the biblical story of the flood, is of great interest eve rywhere. So start with the eye toward the east, with the countries of the classical legend o f flood. Quatrilhões twenty tons of water, mixed with three quat rilhões tons of ash, distributed in a manner roughly equivalent on the overall area of n orthern Eurasia, give us a rainfall of 30 m on average. That is almost inexhaustib le reservoir from which the deluge was shot on the Old World, then they really open t he floodgates of heaven and the depths where the waters of all springs, all the str eams, brooks, rivers, large and small , and grew continuous rains aterrorizadoramente wi th unimaginable, endless, mixing with the macaréus to a devastating flood, destroye d all life on Earth. The fall of \"The planetoid\" was subject to that exact time and place of impact, just that line breaking, ultra-sensitive, in the Atlantic, which then burst and, by combining the forces of fire with water, among others, they also c reated huge flood regions, where there was flooding characteristics, known generically a s the \"flood\". This is the patent and clear exposure of the entire causal series. Another issue is the interpretation on the religious and the metaphysical sense, given the tremendous natural phenomenon, the religious and historical traditions. It must say those few words, since under the natural sci ences, the rejection of the legends of the flood is almost always due to the denial o f religious and mythical components involved and which are regarded as unacceptable. In this case the motivation, justified or not, does not exist, at the ge nesis of natural flood also, clearly outlined before our eyes. Let's start with the flood in Mesopotamia. The Country between the Two Rivers was not only floo ded by waters of Tigris and Euphrates rivers, as is sometimes assumed, in an attempt to explain the legend of the"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" deluge, but still suffered precipitation of rain and mud, over sized, preceded by macaréus also huge. The Epic of Gilgamés describes the ha rbinger of disaster and because of no way exaggerated, saying: \"... Then came the time when the sovereigns of darknes s sent a terrible rain. I looked this time and it was terrible to look. At dawn, there were clouds, black as the raven. All of the evil spirits were released and all the brightness turned into darkness. The South wind wh eezed, water thunder, the waters have risen up to the mountains, the water drowne d all the people ... For six days and six nights, the rain fell like floods. On the seventh day to calm down the waters early. There was a silence and after the battle. The sea is calmed and the torrents of doom silence him. I looked and saw the time and was calm. All the people were turned into mud. The soil of the eart h was deserted, desolate ... \" The Epic of Utnapishtim gives this narrative to great-gr andfather of Gilgamés, the Sumerian Noah, the only man on Earth warned in time b y God and which, sheltered in his chest, survived the flood, and then, along with his wife, be transported to the West Sea at the mouth of the rivers to an island of bliss. This was the remaining land of Atlantis, the mysterio us country of Tlili-lan-Tlappalán of Mayan legends? It seems that the narrative has authentic details such as the terrible rain, the horrible weather, the dark clouds as the crow, the transformatio n of the light of day in the dark of night, the water going up the mountains and, finally, t he huge masses of mud, originated with the ash, precipitated with the rain, cov ering all life on earth, whose land was \"desert, desolate ...\" For a long time, this narrative was ridiculed as a fabl e or myth. Tried to reduce it by qualifying it with exaggerated legend, overvalued and in a ver y small disaster site, until, in 1928, Leonard Wooley and his collaborators made since t heir famous excavations at Ur-ka-War and met with insofismável a remnant of that flood, supposedly legendary. By that time, the researchers found a thick layer of a lluvial mud of 2.5 m, free from any object to identify it, situated well below the tombs o f kings primitive Sumerians and some 12 m below the present land surface. Woolley could not doubt that there was a irrefutable evi dence, proving the occurrence of a flood really huge. Moreover, Wooley would be the la st to doubt this fact, it had to have their lists of the Sumerian dynasties until the a ctual time of the flood. Wooley Datou this sterile layer of alluvial mud of the fourth m illennium before the Christian era. But the title that he was authorized to make such da ting? In the case of one layer with no trace to identify it, to the islands more adept could only say that, of course, be older than the other layers around it, where archaeolo gical finds have been made, however, may need its date. In any case, the argument is untenable Wooley, saying t hat the sterile layer of alluvial mud was originally a huge flood, similar to those that suppo sedly are repeated on the land located between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, alw ays subject to flooding. Such events do not produce at all, rock strata. When the sea invades the land, or the rivers overflow their beds, the water lead to unbridled roldão w hat they find in their path, people, amnimais, houses, objects of use. In flooded area s, this means that the sediment mixing with the sludge and the fertile land taken by the waters. Therefore, there or there, the alluvial strata thus generated shoul d close some findings, such as human and animal bones, pieces of fossilized wood, artif acts, finally, archaeological material. This sequence of ideas allows for the conclusion that t he strata, without any object to"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" identify it, located by Wooley, can not be the product o f such a flood. Only a rain of ash and mud, the same as occurred some te n millennia ago and which has everything that was on its way, would be able to pr oduce as final pellet, a layer of alluvial clay finely granular. Without doubt, this stratum could not close any archaeological finding, because before becoming fossil e ntire area has been completely washed by the rain water and dissolved in the sea. The geological evidence for these two and a half meters of alluvial clay attest to the fact that flooding, which the Bible describes: \"... Broke up all the sources of the great chasm opened up a nd the cataracts of the sky and rain fell on the earth for forty days and forty ni ghts ... And the waters swell prodigiously on earth, and all the h ighest mountains, which is under the whole heaven, were covered. The water is rai sed above the hills fifteen côvados, which had covered ... And the waters covered th e earth for one hundred and fifty days. \" (Gen. 7, 11, 12, 19, 20, 24) It would be an exaggeration? Is the water actually cover ed the hills on the outskirts of the plains of Mesopotamia? The thickness of the layer, measured by Wooley, gave rise to a quantitative control since this alluvial stratum r epresents the remaining quantities of mud fell from the sky, which were not brought to the sea, with massive runoff of rain deluge but as sedimentary substrate, remained on dry l and, soil continental flooded. However, only a small portion may well have been as reminders, representing just over 5% to 10% of total mass of mud. If all the mud was deposited, the layer would not have the sterile thickness of 2.5 m, but 25 to 50 m. An est imated average of twenty parts of water to three parts of ash and mud, as the spec ific weight of these substances is 3 kg P / liter, a part of the volume of mud for twenty shares of the water, it was found thus the volume of water involved in that process. The corresponding layer thickness of water was twenty times higher than that of the layer of mud, calculated without loss, so the order of 500 to 1000 m. Floods rising to such heights can fully cover hills and mountains and even beyond in 15 côvados th eir peaks. Across the country between two rivers, at the time populated mainly by shepherds and nomadic peoples, almost absent an elevation of the ground, capabl e of offering protection against the fury of such bodies of water. Therefore, th e biblical story is not exaggerating. Furthermore, one could argue that the rainfall was compute d as being of only 30 m on average and, therefore, as possible to the water, floo ding the Mesopotamian, points to go up much higher, well beyond that brand? The answer is easy. The average rainfall is not the decisive factor, but the actual proportion of water invading the area which in turn depends on their geographical conditions. In Mesopotamia, the rains would be normal n ot sufficient to feed the two big rivers, the Euphrates and Tigris, which reach their proportions only because of travel from a wide catchment area, which extends far beyond Mesopotamia, where its waters are being thickened by a large number of tributari es. This applies also to the hydrographic conditions during the flood, then abnormal, wi th respect to quantitative factors. Also for these volumes of water to Mesopotam ia, the valley between two rivers giants, worked as a dam, capturing the water from r ain, fell across the northern region and accumulating them to grow and rise to heights th at average multiple of 30 m of rainfall, found for the whole Eurasia. So, is full y justified to say that the finding of"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" Wooley represents a qualitative and quantitative evidence of the authenticity of the reports of the flood, as recorded in biblical texts and Sumerians. Furthermore, the biblical tradition is also confirmed by a quantitative examination of the specific conditions. The catchment area of the Euph rates and Tigris rivers occupies an area of some 800,000 km2, with rainfall of 30 m on average, increased with the bodies of water, invading the country, the South, approxim ately 50 billion m3 of water came to be in dam reservoirs of Mesopotamia, the aver age length of flow path is 700 km, therefore it is calculated with the following cross flow: 50 billion divided by 700,000 = 70 million m2. The \"leakage\" of the dam of Mesopotamia is one of 160 km wide, so the bodies of water covering the entire lower part of the country between two rivers, which leaked, slowly, they must have reached a depth of 500 m, this value gives approximately the estimate obtained for the sedimentati on of the masses of clay. Moreover, the topography Mesopotamia is there to take th e last doubts about the authenticity of the biblical story of the flood. Alth ough in poetic language, the Bible describes actual facts, without the slightest exaggeratio n, saying: \"All the flesh that moved on the earth was consumed, t he birds, animals, reptiles and all the beasts that walk the trails on the earth and all men. Everything that breathes and has life on earth, all di ed. And were exterminated every living thing on earth that had provided the man to the be asts, both reptiles and birds of the sky, everything was destroyed the earth, it was onl y Noah and those with him in the chest. \" (Gen. 7,21-23) People were turned into mud, is that also the Sumerian st ory. But that also killed the birds? For the birds that failed to save themselves fr om floods, which Woolley and others, has not passed a flood of major proportions? For both should have just left the flooded plains of the river mouth and flown to highest poi nts. Why did not? Why could not do it. The very strong rain, incessant, but also b irds, drowning them in the maelstrom of the total destruction of all life. It is precisely this point, the death of the birds, the ítfenstar that at all, that disaster can n ot be regarded merely as a qualified marine flooding. The deluge of rain did not rain a common, more intensity , were totally different and incomparably more dangerous. The huge saturation of air wi th the condensation nuclei can be made that each cubic meter of air contains up to one kilogram of rainwater mixed with sewage sludge, this would be an extreme value. I n this case, the mass of clouds, in such weather can produce rainfall of 30 m on ave rage, should have reached an altitude of 30 km, on average, which is three times th e altitude of Mount Everest. These mountains of clouds, whose tops deeply enter the st ratosphere, were black, negríssimas due to its high ash content. Moreover, the report also mentions that Sumerian detail. It happened that these particles then ac quired high electrostatic charge, so lightning flashing through the dark clouds and then detonate in tremendous electrical discharges, while they were pierced by funnel s heat and hurricanes of incredible intensity and potential. The biblical account reported that one man was saved fr om disaster. In the Epic of Gilgamés your name is Utnapichtim; in the Bible, is ca lled Noé. The ark would have crossed the waters to fury, and when disposed of, brought o n Mount Nisir. North American researchers, who have taken this repor t to foot the bill, they have distinguished with their binoculars, the contours of the Ark of Noah, the glacier covering the summit of Mount Ararat. That would be mounta ins of 5188 m of altitude,"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" with the same Nisir, the biblical mountain? Dr. Bende r, geologist and oil prospector, expert from the region, doubted this. He argued that even a flood of the proportions of the flood would never been able to carry floating objec ts, or by ships, by 1100 km on mountain ranges of 2,000, or 4,000 m of altitude. If this were possible, then the remnants of the flood should have been arrested once, a t the beginning, the first of the highest peaks, which in this case would be the mountain o f CUDI, a massive limestone and dolomite. Located in west-east direction, amounts to 1600 m above the plains, which slope gently up to 400 m high and where the Tigris Rive r had its gravel-shaped terraces. This conjecture proved to be correct. A scholarly hoca found in ancient scriptures a passage Arabs, saying that the ark of Nug, (this is the n ame given to the biblical patriarch Moslem), docked in the mountains of Al Judhi. An d a Kurdish sheikh said that since time immemorial that there is a sacred si te located, the destination of pilgrimages, where, buried beneath the sands, would be wood asphalt, would be the remnants of the ark of Nug who dig up and find - wool, it co uld remove a splinter, to save it as invaluable amulet against sorcery and disease . Soon after, Dr. Bender went to the place indicated. The re had to remove the snow, sand and found under the sand ran into a layer of decomposed humo, ending a bit dark as pitch, rest a body, with traces of asphalt. It is t he wood? Wood of Noah's ark? How does the Bible speaks? \"Bring an ark of cypress wood; faras the ark and a few sm all rooms at calefata it with bitumen inside and out.\" (Gen. 6, 14) It would with this, really, of a floating object, datin g to the days of deluge? It is difficult to date the find, the remains of wood because t here are minimal and extremely closed rotos. However, beyond this, there are other ' strong. The sand covering the humo contains quartzite dust, like the sand of the sea. Ho w does the powder of quartz would have reached up to 1,200 m altitude, rising by terraces o f the River Tigris, where the whole region there are only rocks limestone and dolomite, but no primitive rock, which split, would have provided the grains of quartz ? This sand can only be of seafood. And only the water could have led to the top of the sand and CUDI object floating organic, processed in humo, depositing them there, in an alluvial depression, perfectly identifiable as such, open to the south, set i n place for its discoverer, namely: the exact location where, in the symbolic language of the Bible, once the patriarch celebrated the new covenant with his God, under the ligh t of seven colors of the rainbow. However, there is still a point to clarify. The Nort hwest rains deluge came, what they found in their path led to the Southeast, to the Persian Gulf. So how could any floating object will stop in the mountains of CUDI, located in Northeast? And as the deluge, which supposedly would have reached 500 to 1000 m in height, any o bject could be transported to 1600 m above the plain? Well, there is a plausible explanation, even for this question. In times remotíssimos existed in Central Asia, the plateaus of Mongolia, an i nternal sea, surrounded by chains of high mountains, which started during the disaster, but t he route to the beach that still separate internal sea, to this day. Its waters descended on the Dardanelles Strait, as the \"flood of Foron,\" and there are mixed with the wav es from the focus of the disaster, gathered their forces and gave several laps aro und the globe, making the rise in ocean waves thousands of meters high. The sea faced the masses of water and rain"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" and invaded Mesopotamia before you can kill the flood. The salt water destroyed the villages and led to the Northwest on all that they man aged float. That tragedy of dra- matic Hell, the thunderous waves, water reservoirs, th e sea and the incessant rain played their respective roles and have made the flood in Mesopotamia rise up to 2,000 m above sea level, or 1600 m above the base of the mount ains CUDI. In back, the flood deposited objects floating in it which brought the c ounter-currents and currents formed sifões located, equal to that caused the depression, open to the south, at the top of the mountain of CUDI. In course of time, sand, s ea sand mixed with substrates deposited by rain deluge, came to cover them, the dry alluv ial depression. Under the sand of quartzite, the wood rotted. What was stored in th ose pieces are humo, showing traces of asphalt, the amulets, witnesses seedlings of biblical flood, that the Bible was right, that was right with your story, so long conteste d and debated. Finally, the relationship between the causae biblical flood and the disappearance of Atlantis can fix time around 9000 BC This fact always put in doubt and, thus, pre sumably also the first real dating biblical, susceptible of scientific proof. As is the case in Mesopotamia, also in other eastern countries there was total destruction, caused by rain of blood and mud and terrible fl oods. They say that an earthquake would open the Straits of Dar danelles, and tremendous mass of water, caused the overflow of the internal se a, in Mongolia, which dispose the Caspian and Black Sea, would have flooded those areas pre-G reek, for nine long days. This disaster is linked to the names of King and pelasgo F oron Deucalião, son of Prometheus. Foron was considered as the \"Greek Adam, the first man to be created. According to legend, was married to Deucalião Pirro, daughte r of Epimetheus and Pandora, the first woman trained by Vulcan, with all t he graces and talents, owner of a box where they closed all the ills of the world. The example of how Ea warned Utnapichtim, the Sumerian, El warned his faithful serva nt Noah, also Deucalião Prometheus warned his son, advising him to make a big trun k for her to withdraw. Deucalião accepted the advice of his father, as Noah an d Utnapichtim followed the instructions received. This parallel between the vario us versions of the legends of the deluge, told the country between two rivers and in Greece , is an evidence of a single common source, inspiring traditions, reporting only a sin gle event and dread, that count in their language visual and mythological. As Noah docked the hill Nisir, docked in Deucalião Parnass us. The example of the biblical patriarch, Deucalião saving the ship landed ther e to offer his sacrifice to the deity. The example of The Bible, also agreed with Zeus b enevolence offering. Here and there, the prayers were heard, the graces granted, he as ked that became the patriarch of a new human generation, post-diluvial. And the myth continues: Deucalião and then Pirro got sto nes, soil enlamaçado and, without looking, threw them back on their shoulders, and t he stones turned into people, which is reproduced and multiplied, replacing the extin ct generation by the flood. The myth describes the magical animation of inert body , the gesture of playing it back, that is, for the past. What were those magic stones, turned into people live? Those who were killed when the deluge, as announced the Sumerian epic, turned mud, emerged as the corpses of sludge pre-Hellenic Greece, and in Mesopota mia. Through the magic gesture of \"playing to the past\", to become what was onc e: people live. Apparently, this was the way to the people as primitive, kind of sim ple, naive, designs the rebirth of humanity, drowned in the flood wave. However, if understo od in its final essence, this detail of the myth has something true and effective for those who, instead of taking her"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" to foot the bill, seeking the original image, behind the symbolic image. The rain of blood fell also in Egypt. According to Solon , the country comes from the tradition of Atlantis. From there came also an accoun t of the flood, significant in several respects and that in the funerary texts of Set i I and Ramses II, said: \"This is the time of Ra getting old ... the god that auto criou ... the king of men and gods. And the men spoke against him, when his majesty was in old age ... and his majesty heard the speech of men. Then he went to thos e who belonged to his entourage and said: 'Call my eye, and Chu, Tafnet, GEB an d Nut! \" The gods were called ... and spoke to his majesty: 'Tell us, so we can hear you! \" Ra to Nunu said: 'You, God oldest of which I created, and you, the ancient gods! Behold ... the men plotting against me. Falai, what laws do you go against th em? Look, I wanted to avoid kill them before listening to you. \" And the majesty of Nunu said: 'Meufüho, Ra, thou, God, you're more than your parents and more powerful than your creator! Sit on your throne! Great is the fear that you feel when your eye is fixed on those that rebelled against you. \" The Majesty of Ra said, 'See, they take refuge in the desert, because in your heart feel frightened by what spoke. \" And the gods spo ke to his majesty: \"Let your eye go and take severe punishment to the rebels. The eye does not remain in your forehead, but down from there, as Hat-Hor ..'...\" This excerpt is the test \"LINK DAS AUGE DES RE\" - Th e Left Eye of Ra, written by Dr. Trofimovitch, stressed that the way all special a nd that gives continuity to the Egyptian legend of the trunk of critical dialogue, as if the its complement. There is a reason missing, of the theological order, emphasizing th e rebellion of men, who became too powerful and known, against the gods, against Ra , who \"was in old age.\" And, according to legend, the punishment was severe against them, the owners of time before the time. That they, like the giants, the Tita ns, they rebelled against the deities, cooperated in the destruction of their world. This legend, perhaps because of the oppression of Ancient Egypt, primitive, the Atlantis, th is is clearly the highest in the country legends passed away and that the old Sumerians, Bab ylonians, through the Assyrian mythology, entered the biblical story of the deluge . Both the banks of the Nile, as pest in Greece, the hum an hybridity was punished by the gods and thus say the hieroglyphs, the hybridity of the At lantic was the cause of the flood. To punish them, the \"eye of Ra\" divine down the f orehead, went to the Earth, which brought severe punishment ... What was that \"eye\" ? The text puts the well- known Egyptian hieroglyph, symbolizing the eye, next to t he symbol determined the Goddess, the snake Urea, the body raised. This means, wh at was the \"eye of Ra\", just your eye \"left\", is there specifically so divine, numin ous as a force for action, as Sequemet the powerful. The following is an excerpt of cit aremos demotic papyrus from Leyden, I, 384, namely: \"Sequemet transformed itself, adopting the beautiful body of a wild lion. She threw his mane to the front. In his hair, the fire wheezing. H is back was the color of Red-blood. His face shone like the sun disk, his eyes shone like fi re. His eyes burned like fire flames and radiated as the sun at noon., sparkle with bri lliance ... All those around her felt her fear, because of its strength. The dust of the desert spread it everywhere, when it hit his tail. The sand raised when she grit the tee th. The desert fire when she threw up afiou the claws. The forests of trees when their no strils Huri dry steam at the time ... the desert covering his face, the mountains have b ecome black, the sun of noon was not dark and the sky more ... \" The left eye of Ra was the sun, but the planetoid that fell from the sky as bolide"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":" destroyer, whose brightness hell did that darken the sun a nd the sky was pale. The disaster, caused by the collapse of the planetoid, also r eached the point of Egypt, as, continues the text, make that Ra feared Sequemet-Hat-Hor would extinguish all humanity. He sent ferment beer and dump it on the country of the Nile, rain and blood, in today's more formulated. When, the next morning, the Terrible is ready for new work destructive, it saw its reflection in the mirror of the red liquid, attracted by its image, the bust she bent forward to drinking the beer, got drunk and does not bother most people. This order almost burlesque version of the E gyptian legend of the flood was probably motivated by the intention of explaining t he strange rain of blood. Also, the same way the arctic regions are drowned in t he sea of blood deluge of rain. Because this area was in the vicinity of the center of the disaster, was hit hard and suffered much more than the distant Egypt. Therefore, the myth narrating the cataclysm USA a motive extreme: the killing of the god primitive, whose color body was the ancient world, we would say of the glaciations, perpetrated by younger deities, one more time again, by those who, on the back of the aforementioned \"Vóluspá\" are called \"Children of Bur\" and singled out as creators of ne w world, no more ice cream, but green, the \"legend of Midgard.\" They kill Ymir and quarter ed, the god of ice, and their red blood all over themselves drowning, one, the Nordic Noah who, mounted on a box mill, saving achieved from the flood. The young gods create your new world of parties rendered the body of Ymir, the bones are the mo untains of meat, the land fertile, and the skull, the sky. Has the impression, thr ough this image mythical- allegorical, following the emergence of post-glacial lan dscape, splitting the layer of ice, which was the body of Ymir and spilling soil spring. But t hat water, falling from glaciers and falling from the sky was the color of bloo d, red? Because it was not just rain water but the rain of mud and blood of the flood, dye d in black and red by volcanic ash, designed to air during the disaster Atlantic . Then complete these examples taken from the other East , West. The Mayan peoples, inhabiting lands under winds from the West, have nothing with the deluge, although his country was destroyed by the volcanic disaster, by eart hquakes, fire and the bore, caused by the impact of the planetoid. Thus, I was quoted a typical example, taken from the Book of Chile Balam. Also, the tribes livin g in regions further south, ie outside the area of wind from the West, still retain i n their memory the remembrance of a great flood. The tarascos the priest Tespi, who built a large boat, which saved you and your family. In Guatemala, the same reason resurfac es, linked to the names of Nala and Cream. The giant tolteca Chelua climbed the mountain of the god of water, saving, therefore, the flood, then he built, on top of that mo untain, the famous pyramid of Cholula, in times later burned by order of Hernando Cort es. The narrative of the flood alonquinos, North American Indians is also quite significant. The people had their land well within the zone of wind f rom the West, why was spared the flooding tide. They say that if your god and hero Mina bozho be released to the lake, the waters rise and flooded the earth. Apparently t here are some remnants of the memory of the fall of \"The planetoid\" in the Atlantic , whose trajectory in its visible part, passed the lands of the Algonquin. On the other hand, would be expected that the South Ameri can peoples, inhabiting the tropical regions, where the prevailing monsoon to the e ast, had experienced the flood and saved his memory in their legends. Moreover, this e xpectation is confirmed, among others, with the myths of aruaques in Guyana, in northe rn Brazil and Colombia. I follow, your god kind, saved all the animals and birds on t op of a high mountain, before the fall flood. Ali spent the terrible times o f darkness and storms, while the"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" plains were flooded. The tribe makuchi of aruaques in their legends speak of a first human couple postdiluvial that, like Pirro Deucalião and in pre-Hellenic Greece, turned men live in stone and thus repopulate the land devastated a nd deserted. The aruaques Guyana remember both phenomena: the fire and subsequent f lood, which corresponds exactly to the location of their living space of thei r land. Greater mortality of mammoth However, in most regions of rain in the east, especia lly in large areas of northern Asia, there are legends narrating the deluge. But in fact this a bsolute proof that the flood would not have come up there, on the contrary, the pest was also part of the areas where the prevailing winds from the West, and beyond the clouds of rain, dyed in black, also led the volcanic ash , scattered to the dis aster Atlantis. Indeed, in the extreme northern edge of Asia has kept a r emnant of memory characteristic of the tremendous flooding that before t he time known, covered the land and drowned the giant mammals that lived there. This country has not only natural their legends of the flood, as they are told elsewhere, but kept bringing invaluable paleontological and nature. Enti re region is akin to a giant refrigerator, full of dead mammoth in excellent state o f preservation. For example, to ask how these giant fauna diluvial represe ntatives, who in his capacity as vegetarians should have sought to avoid areas subject t o glaciation, ice cream came to those sarcophagi? The problem posed by the corpses of the mammoth, kept fre sh, as were live yesterday, is to be solved by science. However, it is clear and reflected the fact that those animals that lived during the Quaternary and were completely aboli shed in quintenário, died during this disaster that was season. Also, these remot e regions were affected only by the subsequent effects of the disaster that Atlantic, w ith the rain deluge, caused unundaçoes destructive. The mammoth or previous wave were asphyxiated by toxic gases or drowned in flood waters. Until today, remains h ow these animals hervívoros, fleeing the glaciations, came to be buried in a cold coun try. (Board 17). The puzzle is in the process of solution, whereas during t he Quaternary terrestrial North Pole was far northern Siberia, a distance of a pproximately 3,500 kilometers longer than the current. The fig. 40, showing the locatio n of the finding, provides explanatory details. The isotherm 0o today's in that re gion is completely different in track followed by the quaternary isotherm 0o, whose line is marked by the southern edge of glaciation, covering the continental land. Hence the enormous differences between the climate once and now. Today, across North ern Siberia, along with the refrigerator of mammoth, \"belongs to the arctic circl e, the eternal ice, which never reaches the ground thaw completely, nor during the short N ordic summer. Therefore, especially in regions where the mammoth was found, near the North Pole, the bodies buried in frozen ground were kept fresh and in a huge modern r efrigerator. It noted that in these regions today Quaternary ice-cov ered Arctic was green, with annual temperature of 4 to 5 ° C on average positive. Under such conditions, but would prevent the rapid proliferation of bacteria, in con trast to higher temperatures, it was not advisable to leave out fresh meat for a long t ime, no way, for more than four days. However, despite this, the carcasses of mammoth, now in the eternal ice, are removed from there in good repair. Moreover, during the dev astating disaster, when the wildlife was abundant, the temperature at the place w here the mammoth could not have been frozen to allow its perfect condition."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" Only today, after the change of climate for the curren t Quaternary cold \"Siberian\", the effective conditions prevail for such conservation. It was then that the critical period of change from one to another of these types of weather can not last for four days because of the contrary and despite the subsequent presence of ice, now there would not be of mammoth carcasses found well preserved, but ra ther smooth and bare bones. Therefore, change the climate must have happened very sudde nly. This change of climate was the logical consequence of t he displacement of the terrestrial North Pole with respect to the edge of the plate tectonics of northern Siberia. But never this huge chunk could be take away at 3.500km in the brief interval of four days. Therefore, more should have been the sudden removal of the pole. Moreover, the turf was not to leave the rotation pole at rest, discounting the secular movement in rhythm, he remained in the magma and its s ubstrate was rotating the pole it is rejected, as was accompanied by the axis of rota tion. This conclusion insofismável, but until now not be rec ognized as a problem, is demonstrated by comparison with a pivot, since the inte rference of peripheral wobble. Also, pivot land reacted, so-dynamic stabilizer against the shock of the impact of \"The planetoid\" and projection of huge volcanic masses when, i mmediately and nothing gradual pace, began to stagger and enter state of precession . Here are the corpses of the mammoth in North-East Siberia, to establish tha t the speed of result of this phenomenon. At that time, the land route took slant, or at least m uch more oblique than before, while the rotation pole, crossed not across the land m ass, but only by the rigid crust, is visited by approximately 3.500km and straight line, toward the local impact of \"The planetoid. The line removal interlock Quinten and the pos itions of the quaternary center rotation and, thus, highlights the fact that the fall of the bolide has caused the removal of the rotation pole, specifically manifest i n the shift of about 20 of the rotary axis of the Earth. Under the dynamic aspect, this pheno menon can be explained as a superposition of the moment rotation, caused by the impac t, the spinner tellurian time. Figure 40. The riddle of the Siberian cold. In the area ma rked with horizontal lines, which covers the current cold pole (X) and the southern reaches limits (dashed line) soil forever frozen, jaziam and buried hundreds of thousan ds of dead mammoth, closed in one layer of ice and mud.

Calculating this proce ss in its details and working with values of toughness, plausible to the peripheral magma , comes to the result that the motion in depth should be reduced from a peripheral zone of magma from a few hundred meters thick. This means: it was indeed a surface phenomenon only, without influencing the dynamic equilibrium of the sphere containi ng the land mass itself, fluid, fiery. The rotary axis of the Earth, represented by t he area not affected by fluid dynamic disorder, kept her in position, the sky is reflect ed as the \"pole of the ecliptic.\" By virtue of the frictional damping of the substrate, th e pivot axis of the earth's crust cambaieante curve evolves in a spiral around the true pol e, the few, will be rising and the obliquity of the ecliptic \"decreases, albeit slowly , but the pace already known .

Over 1600 years at least the tungueses are removing mountain s of meat mammoth prehistoric ground hard and cold of Siberia. Lie there wit h your hair thick, red, well maintained, and resurfaces before the eyes of their am azement as burrowers were in life. Almost no other animal antediluvial better or a s well known as the mammoth, that kind of big giant family of Euro-Asian mammals. Today it is difficult to assess the number of copies foun d and recovered. Since time immemorial, bears and wolves have strong competition t o primitive man, because all too often are found semidevorados pieces or bones perfect ly clean or scattered bones, belonging to the giant mammals. Over the past 150 years, s ome 40,000 copies have been excavated, although the total number of corpses of mammoth frozen should be around 100,000, but above that below this number. Strictly speaking, the only thing the cadavers huge advanta ge is the ivory of its huge defenses, although the tungueses and their dogs do not neglect the surprisingly soft flesh of those giant prehistoric animals. Including Chin a, the country's classical sculpture in ivory, appreciates these natural products to fr ozen ground. While meanwhile were almost extinct elephants because of th eir prey, and despite the synthetic materials, which very well replace the ivo ry legitimate, until today the prey of the mammoth still cover more or less a third of worl d consumption. Year after year, continue to be excavated hundreds of corpses of mammoth, but, despite this, the refrigerator tungus remains well supplied. Once, there must be enormous herds of grazing animals we ll nourished, of all ages, bulls, cows and calves, they were surprised by the sudden de ath, all the freezing of a moment to another and saving them as they were in lif e. Death and the cold created a terribly realistic image, a monumental moment that ma rked the death of the great mammoth, antediluvial in paradise, populated by those huge pac hyderm and peaceful nature. Could hardly be more convincing evidence of ideali zed incredible speed that disaster, killing those animals, that represented by the existence of hundreds of thousands of dead mammoth, perfectly preserved in ice and m ud. Many specimens were carefully examined by anatomy and ph ysiology. All were intact externally. And in all there was the same cause of dea th: asphyxiation. Suddenly and so"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" completely unexpected, death claimed those many mammals. The examination of stomach contents for animals certified with the incr edible speed that were destroyed, as the stomachs of even mammoth and often contain undigest ed food and well preserved that in some cases was up to 27 kg of needles of spruce, pine and hackmatack , that caught hours of the trees, to give the impression to go i n search of the trees which are used to that your favorite dish. However, there is only ice and mud, no more than the flora of the tundra. Today, the trees above and that th e mammoth ate there once only in the vicinity of Lake Baikal, the 3.500km more to the so uth, exactly equal to the distance away from the pole, caused by the disaster Atla ntic. Therefore, the displacement of virgin forests to the south followed the exact removal of the North Pole from Siberia. Many millennia ago, the Northeast Siberian was a gree n country. Vast virgin forests, with gaps in their edges, extend to today where there are only rocks, snow and mud. Hackmatack, pine and fir built their huge trunks thin, up to 50m in height. Powerful rivers cut the soil of many green areas. The air was moderately cool, parasidíaco, even for those huge animals, with their hair thick and red, w hich only needed to open the mouth to delight themselves with the needles of those t rees, providing your favorite food. The virgin forests feed numerous herds of these mam mals, the largest on Earth. For many millennia would have existed that prehistoric animal paradise? Once, in a day unchancy, a tremendous shock to have made the earth trem ble, and then everything started to wobble. The sun seemed out of its orbit, to wander without direction, the firmament. Then he heard was a distant thunder, which b ecame progressively stronger. It was the boom caused by the explosion of the core of the planetoid, and the bang was followed by the infernal roar of disaster Atlantic, t hen unleashed. To some this was the last sound heard by herds of mammoth irate because those sound waves brought the toxic gases, precursors of death and other messengers of the apocalypse, which is spread over the surface of the earth to stifle all liv ing beings. Apparently the sudden death by suffocation was the point of the animals or h ave suffered seizures, physiologically detectable, which would have left no tra ce in the body, preserved as if it were fresh. His legs just gave, they fell and died. Hardly, the hundreds of thousands of people the mammoth para dise tungus, one would have escaped, all were taken by great carnage. And certai nly none of them saw as the West and Northwest, a wall of clouds negríssimas, pile, up to the sky. The clouds grew, and grew with incredible speed, terrible, extinguishe d the stars in the firmament. They brought the rains flood, incessant, who fell from the sky and covered all life on earth. The winds whip the sea, making it invade the main land shore. The water accumulated in the valleys and plains and rose to the top of the mountains, flooded the virgin forest, huge trees uprooted and have made all drownin g in water and mud. And then came the cold. There where few of the angry waters are calm, they w ere frozen. The layer of ice and mud not stopped growing, was now white, now gray and brown, then red and black, designed with the volcanic ash during the eruption Atlantic , who buried the bodies of animals. And those tombs ice, the mammoth still dead t oday in numbers unknown. In the course of millennia, the polar animals eat meat a nd those reserves, since 1600 years, the man also took advantage of them and not stop to find new supplies. Also, it noted that in Alaska, apparently at the same t ime and with equal speed, were also wiped out herds of mammoth flood. There the gases en tered the Strait of Bering and, as happened in Siberia, were followed by rain of mud, floods and marine flood and arctic cold."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" This unveils the mystery surrounding the sudden and total ex tinction of the species of the largest and most demanding hervívoros subarctic region s. The explanation of this ecological disaster waiver auxiliary scientific hypothe ses, such as gigantism, in which oversized bodies, such as mammoth, have physiological def ects, and therefore can only survive in certain areas offering extraordinarily privi leged. This is contradicted by the conditions of thousands of dead mammoth of all ages, as e xamined and found perfectly healthy, without any deficiency symptoms. Also, the ma mmoth confirmed its high potential physiological as well as organic because they have been able to protect your living space against their predatory enemies, the wolves of great size, not because of the herds had never proliferated and in fact proliferated. Neither man extinguished the mammoth. If the had termin ated, had hardly left the game, counting thousands of heads. Also, the prehistoric m an accustomed those regions was very weak, both in number collectively, in dividually as in arms, to face the mammoth, moreover, he did not know the technique of enor mous fojos as were open in the woods of western Europe, the only way to catch those huge mammoth, careful, fast and nearly invulnerable thanks to his thick red hai r. Moreover, neither a change of climate, take place in gradual pace, could have prevented the mammoth to leave the frozen land, were not of their taste and migrate to th e most moderate and consistent with your way of life. During the various stages of glaci ation, with its intermediate periods, free of ice, the herds of mammoth and proved so insofismável what they were able to avoid areas frozen. Only this last time, the ir high mobility and ability to perform difficult maneuvers failed completely, because in that ca se was not a gradual change of temperature, but a cataclysm of global proportions. Moreover, what is the reason why, except to slaughterh ouses mammoth found in Predmost and Unter-Wisternitz in Northeast Europe, the corpses of those herds were located and only between tunguses and in Alaska? It is eas y to answer this question because, as they were well protected, thanks to its thi ck, warm coat, these pachyderm, as their way of get used to cold, prefer the lower temper ature of coniferous forests, where found, in abundance, the their favorite food. And t hen, were precisely those regions which suffered most with the side effects of th e disaster Atlantic therefore there all living beings were exterminated. Indeed, in ti me, the total extermination of the area is extended more to the south, passing the current l imits forever frozen soil, where they found these remnants of the disaster. The mammoth existed only in areas of lower temperatures, land affected by the disaster, and their bo dies were kept there only where, due to the removal of post-diluvial pole, there wa s formation of eternal ice. However, these dramatic events that in prehistoric ti mes were conducted in the Northeast of Siberia contain another puzzling detail, w ere never found corpses of animals, in addition to the mammoth, and occasionally, hairy rhinos. This is especially strange considering that the regional forest clearings, and of large animals, there was a no-less number of animals and beasts. However, none o f them was kept frozen in those lands. Apparently the mammoth and the hairy rhino, whos e alleged conduct large affinity, suffered his horrific fate, let alone that of the contemporary fauna with which coexisted in life. Probably its fate was its enormit y, its oversized proportions, and much beyond those of elephants. The mammoth were real mountains in motion and also the giant rhinos were, without doubt, that its pecul iar quality was responsible for his peculiar fate. Moreover, this sequence of ideas come s to mind a fact rather trite, the selection of objects according to their size, carried by river water. As you know, the river deposits in the larger pieces first stage of its c ourse, then you will be undoing of gravel, medium in size and, finally, near the mouth, is that the sand is. During the"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" Siberian flood of not missing a huge current of water. W hen the sky collapsed in rains, all the land were flooded, with water up to several mete rs high, then accumulate in depressions in the ground, flooded the trunks of trees uproote d, and their passage, they found what they took, including the carcasses of many ani mals asphyxiated and drowned. Also those huge masses of water separating the objects floating in the size and weight. Thus, for the objects being bigger and heavier , the carcasses of the hairy mammoth and rhinoceros were deposited first, then froze there, probably close to their original habitat. The carcasses of the beasts of sma ller size of bison, deer, were carried by currents of water to greater distances, heading southe ast, as the rains deluge came mainly from West and Northwest. Thus, the northern re gions were removed, quickly made Arctic, and came to stop in areas free of glaciati ons. Ali, came in a state of decomposition and left them nothing apart from one or an other part of its carcass and some fossilized remnants occasionally. Also the tree s, the buds of food served to the mammoth and rhinoceros, were carried by water, at dist ances much larger than the carcasses of giant animals, discarded at the beginning of the path. At any point away, the southeast or south, the trees large and small have joined to rotting and there disappeared. Therefore, the hairy mammoth and rhinoceros are alone in their coffins of ice. So strange and almost antipodal, mortantade an animal wa s about 15,000 kilometers from the country of tunguses in the western outskirts of South America, in today Colombian land. Although caused by the same disaster, the parallel case shows some special features that make it interesting for our subject . When, some 150 years ago, Alexander von Humboldt visited an d then described the Columbia, during his famous journey since then in South Am erica, he met with petrified animal bones, in \"Field of Giants\", situated o n a large plateau, to 2,000 m above sea level, not far from Bogota, capital of the country. Humboldt those bones identified as fragments of skeletons of a species of ext inct Mastodons, which was then named according to its discoverer. With that came anoth er puzzle to be unveiled. Although the Mastodons not known how much is known about t he mammoth, that is still little enough to ask people like those typical of co astal wetlands that have to plateau, and up there in the mountains. Your body heavy, al most equal to the size of the mammoth, certainly did not allow those animals cl imb steep slopes, running through bites and close jump from rock to rock. Absent any reason imaginable and plausible for those leaving his pachyderm antediluviais na tural habitat in coastal areas, to settle in inhospitable plateau. What was the cause o f the carnage that killed there? And, there in the \"Field of Giants,\" where much rain f alls, their bones would fossilize, as observed by Humboldt? Here are questions and more questi ons await answers. Moreover, in essence, what is known of the Mastodons? The species Mastodon CUV., Appeared with the Mastodon Humh. South America, is regarded as ancestor of the elephant, many variations of this species lived in Euro pe, Asia and North America and the South American Mastodons became extinct only afte r the flood. Therefore, assuming that nothing prevents their South American cousi ns had also lived at the end of the Quaternary and disappeared because of the disaster t hat killed the Siberian mammoth. Other-yes, because they live in the most pri vileged those who were the last of Dwell, the American Mastodons survived until the end of the period of flood disasters. In his book \"ADAM Sucht ICH\" - In Search of Adam (Melhoramentos, 1965), Herbert Wendt gave some interesting data in this rega rd as follows: Already in 1846 the carcass of the basin of pre-human, wit h bones of Mastodons and giant sloth-bugs were found in a stratum of clay, on the terraces of the Mississippi"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" River, so the man still lived with these giant animal s. In 1873, Abbott, a researcher of Prehistory, found in the gravel of the Delaware River, human and mastodon bones, along with large number of ancient wedges. Then, when in itiated systematic searches for large and small mammals edentulous, fossil in tertia ry and quaternary land of America, in Delaware and Mississippi rivers, in caves in Brazil and in layers of clay in Argentina, across the bones were found in primitive hor ses and cattle, often in the vicinity of the remains of human life. In 1890, the brothers Nordenskjold, Smith-woodware AMEGHINO and made the find in a cave near Last Hope in Patagonia, that strange mi xture of bones, along with scraps of fur, and an enclosure separated by a wall of the livi ng where, according to appearances, and sloth-gogantescos bugs Mastodons were rear ed as pets. In Central America, the mastodon served as a beast of burden and mo unts the holders of the Mayan culture. In several places, the mastodon bones an d shards of pottery were found, along side. In 1928, Franz Spillmann excavated a comple te Mayan pottery, dating the ages II to IV of the Christian era, the own ers must have lived with a mastodon, because: \"Among the pieces of glasses and jugs we re huge bones of the animal, giving the impression of a primitive elephant in ancient china store ... \" Also in the United States - an area spared by the toxi c gas disaster Atlantic - mainly in the Missuri there were traces of a \"culture of mastodon \": full of coal layers of wood mixed with the remains of domestic rats, tools and bon es of elephant . Possibly, the external appearance of the Mastodons was even more strange and incredible than the mammoth, its huge head, with snout gi ant of tapir, was almost the length of the whole body of prey short left maxilla. T hese animals, adapted to the beach environment, where they lie down in the sands a nd the warm mud of the seashore, ate the shoots of bamboo and open passage thr ough the coastal jungle, in absolute terms had to climb the high ridges, where they found his tomb lonely . And neither did some of that escalation. The death surpri sed them in their own habitat, customary in the areas of the coast. Were probably kil led by suffocation, like the Siberian mammoth, from the Brazilian Northeast is w ithin the monsoon to the east, which then, in addition to the deluge of rain clouds, stil l have the toxic gases that dispersed and spread over the continent and doubtless also i n parts of today's Colombia. Then came the rain and mud of the floods, the sea invading the coasts. The carcasses were stacked and covered by the mud disaster diluv ial. In hot weather, the parties perishable and rotting bones, saturated salt mine ral, fossil fuels have become, under the covered with mud which, in turn, dried and hardened like cement. However, that means the fossilized remains have to stop at alt itudes of the ridges? Today, the polls showed so true that only in later, after the disa ster Atlantic, its original habitat, the coastal regions, have to be raised to 2,000 to 3,000 m al titude. There is a document insofismável for this elevation of the South America n west coast. Alexander von Humboldt himself, and some subsequent explorers, saw and des cribed the remains of ancient primitive beaches, preserved today as white ban ds, alvas, which from 2500 to 3000 m in altitude, extending along the coastal rocks of ridges , from the Lake Titicaca to Panama. Even the huge Lake Titicaca, in Peru, at 3,800 m above sea level and covering an area of almost 7,000 m2, the largest lake on Earth, shows a str ange beach strip; strange because to follow in oblique line, the track of your curr ent pargo. This points to the northeast obliquity; giving further that route, ending in t he Azores, in the center of volcanic and seismic disaster Atlantic. Is the \"unknown god\" of Tiahuanaco had lived that cataclysm? It is interesting how, everywhere, i ndicating arrows indicate the"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" location of the alleged cause. What does that track beach, oblique, visible in the Lake Titicaca? Shows how the plate tectonics Brazilian perfez a tilting movement, approxim ately corresponding to the angle difference between the two tracks beach. Now, in turn, this means that the east coast down in both, as the northwest coast went up bec ause the cake always turns around its point of gravity. But there it is concluded that there was a platform on mild slope, located in front of the northeast coast, to be identified as \"drowned land.\" The regions of the mouth of the Rio Amazonas and Rio to sh ow the traces. Until now the motion without explanation tilting North ern Brazil, around an axis between the Panama and Bahia. However, once explained it, with the scheme of fig. 39 and, in true restoration, the removal of turf island, w hich illustrates three typical stages. For now there was and is acompnanhou be only the fate of turf between the lower continental plates, as drawn by the lowering of the ma gma and became submarine. At this point it should be noted also the two major tecton ic plates on the right and left. Although not plummet, so isostatic response to the movem ent of masses of magma, adapting to the lowering of their level, situated on the edge of the newly formed depression, followed the changes in the substrate of magm a. Therefore assumed slant is equal to the assumed by the latter, thus repeating the obliquity of depression. Now, we will devote special attention to the board at the left, it would be a failure of the northern area of plate tectonics Brazil. The fig. 39 shows clearly how, in consequence of the depression, formed in the substrate of the magma, the inner half of the plate, ie the eastern side, had to make a motion ti lt-down, while the outer half, West had to make similar upward movement. As the sea surf ace remains equipotential, this corresponds to lifting the northwest coast, to th e heights of the mountains, and the lowering of the northeast coast, drowned in the Atlant ic. Thus, the puzzle is discovered and was answered the question, inquiring as the c arcasses of Mastodons came to stop in the high ridges. In today's Colombian coast the elevation was not as pronounced as in more distant regions of Lake Titicaca, to have been closer to the axis, around which the movement was tilting. However, in any case, the track coastal wetland, habitat and where the Mastodons died asphyxiated, was transformed into a highlan d, to 2,000 m above sea level. There were the fossilized bones, under the rigid mud, exposed to inclement weather the climate, tropical. The rain turned to soft en the mud dry, and little by little, remove the protective layer by washing it. The winds c arried the work of erosion, erode it, drawing her grain after grain of dust. After cen turies or millennia, the layer of mud has disappeared and the giant petrified bones were on displ ay. Then, became the subject of the action of rain and wind, in large part, t he bones were carried by runoff, were disintegrated, disappeared. Only the largest and stronge st parts resisted the action of time, these remnants derived the name \"Field of Gia nts,\" undeniable geological evidence of the sudden death of all living beings, including those huge animals, as well as the removal of the west ridge, by force of the rev olution that ended the Quaternary Geology. Below, some geographical evidence, supplementing the data on the phenomenon of tilting movements of large tectonic plates. K. Bilau dis covered a huge undersea demotion, the depth of 2,500 m, extends from Cape Breton in the south-southwest direction and captures the waters of rivers, leading in t his coastal stretch. Near its outfall, all these rivers show a clear shift to the west, toward the local lowering of the Atlantic. This demonstrates the fact, and the approxima te location where it took place, that the plate was attached to Europe from Asia, with i ts \"rough edge\" and twist it a"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" little because he was prevented from executing a tilting motion free. Many of these rivers have channels of submarine outfall markedly elon gated. This feature continues to the south and therefore in West Africa, the Congo Rive r launches its waters in a submarine outfall system, of great extent (Fig. 41). Ther e is a wide groove, easily identifiable as the outfall channel, and which descends to a depth of 800 m. Then this would have been the extent to which West Africa perfez its tilting movement down. Figure 41. The groove of the Congo River (Scale 1:10.000.000). The delta of the Congo, West Africa, like the Scandinavian fjords, conti nuous below sea level, on a length of 100 km and up to 800m deep. This is an indication of th e exact extent of the lowering of the coast of West Africa in the Atlantic Ocean. Presumably, the lower postglacial should have been even greater. The problem of displacement of the bed of the Congo River has been studi ed mainly by P. Smith. In turn, Pettersson reports in this regard that the river was dammed by a bending in the soil, there would have been turned into lake, and then wo uld have forced its passage through the rocks easily eroded, thus allowing the leakage o f water reservoirs. Today, the gold mining of diamonds is done in the old lake bottom, where they found remains of civilization housing musteriana (Palaeolithic). The people who inhabited those regions should run water constantly lifting and dwellings l ocated in the highest points were the subsequent civilization solutreana. Then and co rrespondingly at the end of the Quaternary, there was the sudden lowering of the soil, b ecause until now ignored. P. Smith examines its scope in almost 4000 m, also seems to estimate this value with that obtained for the lowering of the fossa of Romanche, t he northern mouth of the River Congo, at least 2,800 m, or more likely, as the soil sampl es revealed the . Therefore, the profile of the west coast of Africa attests that the lowering caused by the disaster severely Atlantic reached the bottom of the basin so uth of the Atlantic. In turn, the extension of lower ground to suggest that the proportions un imaginable disaster prehistoric. Similar phenomena of degradation and collapse of coastal lands were also found on the east coast of North America. The baixios of Newfoundl and and Nova Scotia, and the long and irregularly debouchment like an arm of the sea, t he St. Lawrence River, are areas of soil lowered later in geological time. It see ms that the great Hudson Bay there are also areas that should have been lowering from 100 to 150 m. The Chesapeake Bay"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" is a fjord, a drowned valley. Martha's Vineyard, an isl and today, once must have been a hill, situated in a llíngua of land, entering the ocean. While all this was a general knowledge so far remains unexplained. Moreover, it is known perfectly well that the Hudson Ri ver submarine canyon has to equal the magnificence of the Congo River in Africa, a gap of 800 m deep and steep flanks, which extends far beyond the coastal zone and e nds only at 2 or 3 km deep. So also the range of continental land must have suffered so me degradation of the order of 3000 m. Moreover, according to Pettersson, the entire eas t coast of North America, from several thousand miles in length, has similar str ucture and are cliffs, canyons dotted the 2000 to 3000 m depth, showing great similarity with th e cliffs in the alpine chains mountains, where rocks have fluxão or bending. In short, is a land inundated. Some beach terraces, preserved to this day, are there to show the change of level, which may not have occurred in stages, but the opposite h appened so quickly and relatively nothing gradual. The general lowering of the c oastal zone appears more clearly in the marshy regions of North Carolina (Fig. 42). Moreover, all these phenomena have become more complex with the subsequent r etransformações, which introduced the reciprocal movement of ascent and descent, for juxtaposition and consequent obliteration of its original features. As mentioned elsewhere, the forces were not expressiv e of reprocessing, whose work caused the depression to lowering the level of magma shoul d be capped, as was the minimum standard deviation of the conformation, rotatin g ellipsoid, reaching only about 3 kilometers, where the total sum of the radius of Earth 6400 km!

Undoubtedly, rivers of lava covered the land island, just as in the lower Tertiary, the Hindu Dekkan acquired its thick coating of lava. The crust of lava, fr om the Atlantic disaster, could never be imagined or measured, its thickness could be hundre ds, or even thousands of meters, so the possibilities are almost zero evidence of a comprobatória be withdrawn from the ocean bed. Moreover, such events become less viable when considering to find and identify the buildings aneliformes, perhaps, the gr eat plains with his pipe and his quadricula input channel. So this would be the point on which all efforts should converge, to the rediscovery of Atlantis, at least in frames submarines. The Limo Argilo sand-and carbon dioxide At this point, our scheme of restoration should focus on the time since quah had much, stopped the rains flood, and bodies of water, flooding half the globe, returned to the ocean. For time and again since then completed the majo r terrestrial water cycle. Also the sludge diluvial, from mixing with rain water fro m volcanic ash, do you think is filed, for the most part, at any point in the bottom o f the ocean. In any case, it is a total of around three tonnes quatrilhões and if that total wer e retained only some portion, it should be of sufficient amounts to be found. Suppose that 90% of sludge diluvial were taken to the sea. Thi s estimate is slightly higher residual values of 10% instead of 5%, those obtained with the calculation of partial flood in Mesopotamia. In this case the higher v alue is justified by the total collapse of the flood have on treatment of land conside rably more extensive that the \"dam\" Mesopotamia, thereby increasing the percentage of mud left on dry land. The broadly, what was on the surface of the Old World would h ave been a third of a quatrilhão tonnes, and therefore represent the volume of one to two million cubic km. Indeed such masses of mud would be too much to disappear witho ut leaving even the smallest trace. On the other hand, assumed that this quantity, also signi ficant on a global scale, was deposited in any form, on a plateau of average altitude of 100 m, then it should cover an area from 10 to 20 million square kilometers, or betwee n the tenth and twentieth of the total area occupied by the Old World. And indeed, this massive mountain of comparable size and magnificence, there is, lies in the continent euroasiático that most suffered from the rain of mud. It extends from the west of France, from the Atlantic coast, on the central regions of Germany, along the rivers Rhine, Danube, Elbe and Oder, to Czechoslov akia and Hungary and, via Poland, Russia southern reaches; in central and eastern Asia will be expanded to form the Tarim basin of the Turkestan, and covers part of no rthern China.

The area of sandy- clay loam extends to, towards east, as an alluvial bel t, progressively wider, until the northern edge of the great chain of mountains of fold-up, beginning with the Alps in Europe, and through the Caucasus to the Pamir and Himalayas in Asia; alluvial belt that ends at the Sea of China. The main areas of san dy-clay loam are marked with dashed, the centers, with black dots, the area of perman ent glaciation, diluvial with dots. The Figure 43 shows the belt of sandy-clay loam, yet eni gmatic, that specifies a technical term glacial sediment, similar to the clay, rich in quartz and lime, the ocher- colored gray-clear, with surprising amount of grain quartz, mica and splash of the stone chips of all kinds.

According to its origin, there are two types of clay, s andy loam, namely the non- stratified, clayey-sandy loam called the mountains, and stratified, from the strata caused by water. In most cases, the type not stratifie d, ie the genuine, is the substrate on which banks run that well stratified, especially in large rivers, reach significant proportions and compete for the formation of the landsca pe, which give the"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" characteristic features. The theory includes the type called wind genuine and sedimen tation caused by the cold winds of the steppe, in powder form, the sandy-silt-clay so it would have been taken to the green areas, nearby, where he was captured and accumul ated by the shoot. Without doubt, this substrate of sandy-clayey silt has formed duri ng the various stages of glaciation and the intermediate periods. However, intere sted only in his capacity as basis of huge banks of sandy-clay loam, formed in later times and where it was accumulated most of that product (Board 15). While the bottom layer, wind, shows no traces of all uvium, banks stratified, with its strange and bizarre structures, forming plans and high terr aces, have all imaginable and desirable characteristics of their water source. Thro ughout its creation, qualify as typical alluvial conformations and that its characteri stic also has been marked by its location in the beds of rivers and river valleys of t he primitive. However, where they have enormous amounts of silt-cla y sandy stratified water? For chemical composition and physical structure, the san dy-clay loam stratified is not the genuine product of erosion in a well advanced. Moreove r, since the raw material, while still intact, it must have been rich in quartz a nd limestone, but did not contain calcium carbonate, calcium oxide, but, only with the gra dual erosion, it has become that. Therefore, it would be somewhat difficult to imagi ne that the mountain ranges, rich in calcium and quartz, were only formed by erosion. Moreover, there are ridges of great size, which rocks, and quartz, containing calcium ox ide, which is obtained by heat treatment. Nor is there a plateau that, through Eur ope and Asia, with the belt of sandy-clay loam, in order to allow the products of erosi on, there originated, were introduced in the wind belt. Also, would hardly mountains l and of sufficient size to produce and disperse such quantities of products of erosion. Wo uld be two million cubic kilometers, roughly corresponding to the volume of th e Tibetan plateau! Therefore, the sandy-clay loam stratified in training was not a gradual, its origin should be totally different. It happened, however, that at the Atlantic disaster, th e interior of the earth, the pot containing the fiery magma, provided raw materials in th e form of volcanic ash in quantities higher than those found today as sandy-clay loa m stratified. First, the clouds formed in the eruption caused such ash to the high layers of atmosphere, where they were released, then traveled west with the winds, preva iling for the flood regions of Europe and Asia, where they were eliminated and washed by the waters . The sandy- clay loam is the base of the sediment mass of mud that both large and small, is one layer of clay, alluvial and completely sterile, as in thickness from 2.50 m below the tombs were found in well, kings of the early Sumerians. Also, the sandy-clayey silt was carried by the flood through the whole of Europe and Asia. Under this concept, the sandy-clay loam is not prouduto of erosion, formed gradually, by surrounding mountain ranges of limestone and quartz, but o ne gets, coming from far away. It is the magma, broken into drops, which turn ed into volcanic ash, crushed by winds and hurricanes, in the high layers of the stra tosphere, there is mixed with marine sediments, rich in calcium, also detachment of the seabed of the Atlantic and those projected altitudes. This was the recipe of the geo logical formation of the sandy- clay loam. The content of calcium is due to marine sedi ment and its high content of quartz, the surface of magma, containing silicic acid. It is decomposed magma, mixed with marine mud. In this case, the erosion has progress ed to the point under the microscope of its volcanic origin be revealed only by their chemical constitution, not by its structure."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" In this context, the origin of the banks of sandy-clay loam, stratified, can be viewed with great plasticity. Collapsed the rains flood, and much beyond what they can devise about. \"The soil of the earth was of mud, desert, desola te.\" Parts of the contents of ash remained in the lands washed, flooded, we got to evaluate them on a 10% and these were the remains of land abandoned by continental wate rs retreat to the sea in the world. The events that accompanied and followed this proc edure can be demonstrated in small scale, putting up a sheet of flat glass in a posi tion slightly oblique to let it drain on a thick water, mixed with mud. First, there are smal l grooves in the surface flow of finely granular layer, little by little, expand it and b ecome great in furrows, which become progressively more funds, cross open ditches, stee p-walled, cut by grooves closer. Once more, our model takes the aspects of a lan dscape, formed by sandy-clay loam, as exists in the Chinese province of Shansis. However, crops in terrace, there exist were made by the hand of man (Board 15). In China, the sandy-loam clay has become the yellow earth, with that Empire gave the Environment and the sacred color of their advanced civi lization based rural. Due to its high content of minerals and trace elements of, condit ional on its origin, the sandy- loam clay mineral fertilizer is a great and probably i s in the more fertile soil of the entire globe. Provinces in China, whose lands are san dy-clay loam, forming thick layers of hundreds of meters, the peasant seeds, planted and harve sted continuously over at least 400 years without ever fertilizer them. All that is known about the high fertility of the sandy -clay loam, also applies to the volcanic ash decomposed. Thus, the volcanic island of La nzarote, the \"Island of the Moon\" from the Canary Islands, provides a classic exam ple. Between 1730 and 1736, this island was devastated by volcanic eruptions very st rong and then covered with thick layers of ash. Once more, these ashes, rich in nitrogen and acid salts matches, turned into high quality of humo. Without any fertilizatio n, without any special care, the soil was and remains incredibly tired of giving crops potato and cabbage, onion, watermelon, melon and figs, and grapes of smoke, competing in fertility with yellow sandy-clay loam of China. Moreover, the soil need not always be yellow, can al so be black, like the famous black earth of Ukraine, or yellow-red as the ground of Hégyalya in Hungary, or brownish- yellow, as the land of Magdeburg, in eastern Germany. Ho wever, when and despite their color, retains its high fertility and their cha racteristics, and specific, as are known throughout the world for lovers of famous Hungarian wines. The sandy-clay loam is a very valuable donation of disaster Atlantic. Although th e destruction caused by this disaster was incomparably greater than the benefit deri ved from it, this positive point at least has survived to start the redemption of its primit ive civilizations, then or in debris or completely eradicated, bring the water. Also for the purposes of the cataclysm of the season diluvial valley popular saying, that there is no evil that does not bring a good, up to the deluge benefited the posterior to the donatio n of sandy-clay loam. This same philosophy also applies to the second gift that has been bequeathed by volcanic eruptions in the Atlantic. The toxic gas cloud that preceded the rain of ash and mud, destroyed almost all life on earth were, in most c ases, carbon dioxide. This odorless gas, transparent, but relatively heavy, is not toxic, but unfit to keep the process of respiration. When you breathe, the combustio n of substances the body produces its own carbon dioxide. Also this product is ambiv alent effect: to bring about the death, other life. Animals and aerobic bacteria di e, while the plants live. Carbon dioxide is the vital element of the flora, the plant b ody, hydrocarbon, is composed of water and carbon dioxide in photosynthesis these two co mponents are assimilated. The"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" duration of your life and speed of growth depends on the cont ent of carbon dioxide from its environment, carbon dioxide, the \"envelope\" o f the plant. Today, the environmental content of carbon dioxide is low, the a verage is just 1 / 33 of 1% of volume, because only in the immediate vicinity of the soil enough to reach 1% of volume. The total weight of carbon dioxide in the air s hould add a few billion tons. It was found that during the disaster Atlantic, was produced a m ultiple at least three times the amount of carbon dioxide from volcanic to spr ead all over the globe by winds flood. While a part was absorbed by the sea, while ano ther part would be lost to erosion, roughly the average level of carbon dioxide in the air must be strong and increased suddenly. Furthermore, the geologists emphasized the phenomenon of a flora very Viçosa, subject to periods of volcanic activity, as occurred in the tertiary. Moreover, there is inferred that in Northwest Europe, the climate change m arking the transition from the Quaternary to quintenário, would have led in a straight li ne, the existing plant grace the stages of glaciation during a period of overflowing floral richness and abundance parasidía -ca. However, this was not what happened. Two millennia of Darkness So far have not come to close the examination of si de effects and later, all the products generated by the projection during the volcanic disaster A tlantic. The products of large volume, forming sheets of pumice stone and mud, have made f or a long time, the Atlantic east no longer be navigable, the average cons istency of products, such as volcanic ash, mixed with water vapor , discharged by the eruption, the rains caused flood and left as its derivative, the sandy-clay loam s tratified. Finally, the exalações in gaseous form, for the most part carbon dioxide, a gas produc ed fertilizer, of inestimable value. However, there is a portion of these products to be exa mined, the substance thin. These finer particles that ash had different luck and produc ed different results. For this portion of the total products of projection, represented b y a fine powder, the weight was computed to approximately one quarter of quatrilhão tonn es. Pinhiformes the clouds that may lead to the upper layers of the envelope o f air, where it was suspended for a long time, because of its fine consistency and i ts tiny size. Also for this there is the possibility of drawing conclusions parallel, based on subsequent examination of the effects produced by volcanic eruptions, recorded by history . During the eruption of Cracatoa such particles were taken at altitudes of up to 30 km, bottom entering the stratosphere, where they were suspe nded for more than two years. Ali led the \"red glow\" of sunrise and sunset, exceptionall y picturesque during that period. A similar bright red and with that striking evidenc e of the existence of volcanic dust in the high atmosphere, roily them was seen througho ut Europe, after the eruption of Mount Pele, on the island of Martinique. Also the fa ll of the meteor phenomenon caused taiga identical with the dispersion of masses of m eteoric dust. Also, these effects later become even more impressive with the a ctivity of Mount Katmai in Alaska in 1912, when the volcano came into violentíssima activ ity, designing incredible mass of dust that, in addition to producing the \"bright red\", even caused a significant drop in temperature. During the eruption of Cracatoa was observed as the dust r ose to ever greater heights, as if it were lifted by cranes stratospheric. Finally , most of its mass was suspended at 80 km altitude, there is atmospheric pressure of only 0.02 tor r and the air is composed"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" of hydrogen and nitrogen in equal parts. The ring of dust, sus pended freely in air, exposed to the rays of the rising sun and west, as a bri ght white flash, diffuse, sometimes as scintillating evening clouds, sometimes li ke a silver cloud. Over nine years this conformation persisted sparkling, delicate, wh en they are discarded to extend to regions of progressively more extensive. It is diffi cult to determine accurately the time the return of these tiny particles to Earth. The Stokes formula, used in these calculations estimated, operates with a number of facto rs too little known, such as air resistance in those unusual altitudes, diameter of the par ticle and its specific weight, so that one can hardly take their results as arithmetic, in any case, are somewhat accurate and, moreover, do not consider the factor represented by the stratospheric winds. However, the examples allow the quantitative recovery of these effects even after the disaster Atlantic. Only twenty-thousandth part of a proj ection of their products would have been sufficient to produce effects equal to those ca used by dust during the eruption of the projected Cracatoa. This proportion arith metic could provide the basis for a first comparison, but can also be found more accur ate values. Supposed that the fine powder, left the terrible wounds in the earth's crust, the few, were scattered over an area of 50 million km2 of surface, corresponding to the whole of Asia, each square kilometer would have been covered wi th about 5 million tonnes of powder, equivalent to 5 kg p/m2. What was the altitude of the layer of air able to load such a quantity of powder? For purposes of rough calculation, made to believe that la yer of air was so \"polluted\" as the air of modern industrial cities, bad reputation, w hich reaches up to darken the light of day, as in so many of our cities civilized wor ld. There is to some 100,000 with particles of dust p/cm3, or 100 billion p/m3. Such dust particles are the size of a micron (= 1/1.000 mm), its volume equivalent to approximately 1 trilionésimo of cm3. In the case of finer particles of ash, or porous struct ures, their weight can be estimated around 0.5 trilionésimo of grass. Therefore, a cubic mete r of air pollution, as exists in major industrial cities, containing powder, weighing 50 mill igrams, cake on a 100 billion grains of powder. Only 100,000 m3 of polluted air could co ntain a quantity of 5 kg of powder which, according to our calculation estimated, would cover one square meter of soil. Therefore, the column of air, which s hould contain 100,000 m3 p/m2 surface-based, should reach the altitude of 100 km. Whereas t hese data provide a cross section of the hypothetical column of powder, equivalent distributed, that its power would be close to 100 km, that were saved since the proporti ons of polluted air due to an industrial city of today. However, imagining such a cloud of dust rising up to 100 km altit ude, containing twenty thousand times the amount of powder designed for the disaster of Cracatoa and suspended from 200 to 300 km altitude, comes to mind the appearance of great climatic effects and produced by the meteorological phenom enon. This cloud should be overcome in some fifty times the most powerful and impo sing cloud formed during a storm, and its particles of powder is formed on ideals of condensation nuclei, remains to be rich in water drops and ice crystals. To some sh e carried multiple quantities of water on the powder suspended in it. In addition to muddy the upper atmosphere as to produce the \"br ight red\", it caused total darkness. With the presence of dust and clouds, the o utermost layers of the atmosphere have become slightly reddish tones, to black, completely obscuring its transparency, at least for the first time this phenom enon of extreme turbidity. For the man who, after the disaster, lived under such a thick lay er of fog dark, within an eternal winter mist, as exists in the northern hemisphere, t he sky was totally changed, lost his"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":" beautiful transparent blue sky, the stars disappeared scinti llant that once appeared with the fall of night. The firm-up survival was dark, black-br own in color, without sun, no moon, no stars. Only a weak reddish glow, issued by the di sk of the Sun without brightness and strength, could go through the clouds. Evil spi rits stole the Sun, arrested him, did a spell to disappear - and mythical heroe s left in its quest to free him. This echoes in primitive legends of Europe, and India. Japa n, dating from the time before time. Therefore, this period of complete darkness in the country under the cloud, not a mythical tale. This terrible cloud was not evenly distributed on Earth. With its thickest part, they cover those areas of the northern hemisphere which h ave suffered most with the rain of volcanic ash. There are predominant westerly winds tha t raised and led first to the east, but in the stratosphere, the wind directions change blow ing strongly and the east quadrant. Therefore, the clouds of ash, raised in the eas t, the region of the disaster, or on the North European, were captured by east winds, preval ent in the stratosphere, which eventually lead them back to the West. Thus, the clouds, which in return were then west with the wind, came to swinging, determined to stay longer and focus more sharply on those areas. East Atlantic, the old Europe, where the glaciers were in slow retreat, the formation of clouds of ash must have atta ined its greatest intensity. There the rain of mud were the strongest. There arose the le gend of the god before, murdered, in whose blood the world drowned. And there was t he core of the dark clouds of mist, which arose after the flood. This phenomenon was even more pronounced and always rece ived reinforcements with the arrival of warm waters of the Gulf, then that fi rst reached the coast of western Europe. Ali fought against the thick layer of ice, meltin g it and evaporated in the cold Arctic air, has not penetrated by sunlight, then absorb ed by the dark cloud. In clouds of water vapor, not to train stopped, evaporated to the Gulf for that reservoir huge, dark, situated in the higher atmospheric layers, entering the stratosphere and ionosphere, they received new food from the sea cow . What would have been the real effect of that awful dark cloud? Both the man and the animals living on that plant, for its assimilation, de pends on the sunlight. Therefore, the lack of light greatly affect the plant life. Only a few species, able to adapt to the lack of light, such as moss, a dryad and polar míseras grams, can survive this period of darkness, only those varieties could have survived the pos t-glacial period of complete darkness, in regions boreal, especially in Northern Euro pe, the most experienced with this phenomenon. The other plant species, hungry for ligh t, and became extinct with them, man and wildlife, it failed to migrate and set up in less inhospitable. That desert country of eternal night, remaining only a few could hav e resisted such terrible darkness, perhaps, reindeer and musk oxen, fed up of mosses, r angíferos of hunters, shepherds and fishermen who certainly survived under the w orst conditions and subhuman. Its existence should have been equal to the dead live in a world permanently dark, clarified only by a bright opaque and diffuse. In a strange way, the landscape disappeared long ago became the prototype of the mythical country of the dead, the model of tartar and Er ebus, the dark of pest Perséfone, the queen of the underworld of Hades and the co untry of eternal mist of King Nordic. How do all these concepts are correlated in terlock and shows the great similarity between the words \"Erebus\", name of the dar k region that extends under the earth and over hell, and \"Europe\". Moreover, it seems t o us seriously and once primitive name of this continent was the meaning of \" world in the dark\", but stress that this interpretation meets was due to its geographical loc ation in the West, for Asia, so-"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" Erebus Europe would have meant \"country in the shadows\", \" west of the country.\" However, this interpretation is not plausible, because in all probability were not Asian people, but the Europeans themselves baptized to his conti nent. Moreover, Europeans have not had any reason to devise its mainland as the \"west country\", because day after day observed the sunset, then the far horizon. No, the concept Erebus-Europe waiver any additional explanation or different. The memory of that kingdom of darkness and acted persisted f or long after the return of the Sun With Homer in Nekyia, Canto 11 of the \"Odysse y\", there were references to \"cimérias nights\" on the far western and northwestern edge world. It is these details that alone would not have geographical explanation, to in dicate the presence of real motivation, disappeared meanwhile, like the legend of the dead pest, which never entered a single sunbeam. However, in remembrance of the people of North West E urope still remains even clearer and the fog of this world, the time before the time. Those who lived through the stages, now reconstructed, provided important testimon y in favor of its reality in the tale of \"Niflheim\", the epic of the Nordic Edda. At the beginning of time, thus to the narrative, only there was nothing, a huge void, open and responsible as an abyss. In order that nothing had two worlds, the \"Muspellsheim\" and \"Niflheim.\" The first was located to the south and the time it was clear, sunny a nd hot, the second was the North and there everything was dark, covered with dense fog, col d and wet. The ice fell from Niflheim to Muspellsheim where discarded conformations i n huge ... Without doubt, Niflheim was the world to the North, under the fog, the dark land, underground, in darkness, with the glaciers in slow retreat before the sun from Muspellsheim. Despite its impressive brevity, this descr iption gives mythical paleoclimáticas fully with the conditions of the time, which portrays with absolute fidelity. The new and puzzling fact it refers only to th e darkness there mentioned, but now also found that reason full explanation. Long gone the cloud of fog surrounding the boreal regions of the Earth, but its traces remain verifiable through the paleoclimatologia. According to geological estimates, the beginning of the pe riod quintenário, or the contemporary era, it was around 10,000 BC As the disaster ca used the Atlantic sudden projection of huge masses of volcanic carbon dioxide, th e climate would have changed for good, considering that raising the average temperature of air, caused by the sharp increase in carbon dioxide, along with the warming of t he environment by the Gulf, plus the fertilizer by-sandy clay loam, should have cause d abundant plant growth and, thus, created the preconditions for a \"second paradise\" on earth. However, the ideal climate to come soon, and when he came, did not reach the optimum conditions. It took about 5,000 years for the climate epiglacial, the end o f the upper Quaternary, became the great weather, featuring the season Litorin a; before this, there was intermediate stages of intense cold, which lasted for t he entire season Yoldi subarctic and as postglacial Ancylus. These last two seasons, the Yoldi offers of special i nterest, because its floral table have been reconstituted by the analysis of pollen. The veget ation was very poor, the dryad, restricted to arctic plants, adapted to life with a mini mum of light, such as moss, dryad, and later polar grams. Where the Arctic flora have bee n located in a landscape far to the south for this species? For there came not only b ecause of the lack of heat, because it felt the heat provided by warm waters of the Gulf, b ut because of lack of light, absorption of sunlight by the cover of fog, post - glacia l, covering life and preventing land. The season is characterized by Yoldi of weather conditions reigning over the"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":" darkest period experienced by the North West Europe. However, little by little the fog is lifted. A few mi llennia later, the environment has become more clear, the cooler climate, more of Ancy lus inaugurating the era, with its birch, pine and its Alamos. However, only five millen nia after this interim stage, superfria, inhospitable and enigmatic, came to an end. Fi nally, at the time Litorina, climatic conditions and with considerable delay reached the optimum point that according to expectations should be reached well before, immediately after the flood. Since then, the temperature has to fall. Also in the Bronze Age, the heat was stronger than today. The Iron Age of the recorded periods of inten se cold, only later, with the increasing interference of man, in rapidly expanding populat ion, were the first signs of erosion and deterioration of soil, making it the desert and creating its specific climatic conditions, whose progress future should be viewed with con cern the case. Moreover, long known this strange turn of weather change s epiglaciais and post- glacial, however, still have not been identified as pro blem. The climatic improvement at the end of glaciations, were accepted as such without the various processes of melting had earned math exams. Thus, it seems that nobody notic ed how much was prolonged its duration. Therefore, our research they are likely t o compete to fill that gap in the study of changes in climate and postglacial epiglacial. Also, Figure 44 provides a schematic explanation for this detail. The time factor is the abscissa and the quality factor of the climate of ordin al. The abscissa is divided into segments, corresponding to the phases mentioned epiglacial period and post-glacial, so regardless of more precise dating, the outline provides a b rief overview of the climate typical of each of the phases in question. The figure presents two sides of different color, in bla ck and white. A white light indicates the values of the quality of climate, as actua lly found by analysis of pollen, when Litorina ( \"L\") is the ideal state, while in th e Bronze Age ( \"B\") and the Age of Iron ( \"F \") decays gradually to the current value. This section of the diagram is fully paleoclimáticos the results, obtained in recent decades. However the explanation is in itself a new fact, shown dashed in the face in black. Shows there is the influence of negative factors, contributing to the deterioration of climatic conditions, characterized by dark mist covered the earth and involving the gradual lo ss of carbon dioxide. The contour line of this diagram indicates the supposed climati c situation, as would have been harmful in the absence of that layer of fog, in which case early in the quintenário, the climate would have registered a sudden improvement, the n from then on, a worsening in fairly regular pace. What then shows a black face? It shows the dark cloud of fog, which, like a threatening shadow, as projected over the entire post-gla cial stage. The loss, due to its absorption of sunlight, was incomparably greater than th e gains climate, derived from the Gulf and the enrichment of carbon dioxide. Therefor e, the stage was the toughest epiglacial and inhospitable, showing a bad weather, rathe r than great, as expected. Also, as the vegetation development was shy, retarded, a nd neither she nor the soil relatively well preserved, under the layer of ice, then slowly decline, consumed quantities of carbon dioxide.

The curve separating the upper, dark, the lowe r face, white, represents the climate of northwest Europe, according to the provocativ e elements of the deterioration of weather conditions, such as a layer o f dark haze, loss of carbon dioxide. If it were not for the cover of dark mist at t he beginning of quintenàrio, the weather should have been great, because the arrival of the Gulf and abundance of carbon dioxide, and the slow and then a subsequent decrease , caused by loss of carbon dioxide. However, the weather could be great only when l itorina, which is explained by the influence of the layer of mist dark (dark side), sinc e only your demise allowed the realization of competing factors to improve the climat e. And, therefore, the air near the ground has retained all the richness of this precious substance. Where, then, little by little, the darkness is resolved and sunlight heats the ground, in the process of gradual thaw, the \"greenhouse effe ct\" produced by air, rich in water vapor and carbon dioxide, began to be felt .

Also the sea, free of the shackles imposed by the ice to it, absorbed the lio n's share. The glaciers retreated to the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea, and large a reas of land newly released absorbed carbon dioxide from decomposition. With this, t he consumption of the promoter of the climate factor, ie the richness of c arbon dioxide exceeded the unfavorable factor, or the remnants of the cover of fog. Therefore, the weather could not improve further, as Litorina improved before the se ason, but came to worse. And that necessarily the weather came in decline rather than improve. Thus, the puzzle of post-glacial climate change found their explanation, both qualitative as quantitative. But even that negative phase of the intermediate phase o f cold and darkness presents a good thing. Because of this phase, the melting of thick gla ciation, covering the continental land, come in rather slow pace, which in turn ensured the Nordic countries on both sides of the Atlantic, against the danger of a further interference in their life and evolution. The broadly, is estimated at 800 to 1500 m thick layer of ice during the last stage of glaciation. According to Geer, took some 5,000 years until t he completion of the process of melting and retreat of glaciation to Gotlânt ia, center of glacial formation. This would give an average annual melting of the order of 15 to 30 cm at most. This produced a melting water table at least 12 cm and a maximum of 24 cm in height.

In a way the cover of mist became dark flegmá-tor the process of melting and, thus, the left harmless. The newly rel eased ground state, with the retreat of glaciers, easily absorbed the extra moistur e, without major disturbances in its water economy, which continued to be subject to annual precipitation rain, without notice the influence from the relatively small train ing of waters of melting. Thus, the water could drain superfluous and no permanent flood, or great er estagnações water or formation of swamps. Moreover, in the absence of the protective cover of dark mist, the melting would have been processed in much more rapid pace. During critical peri ods, especially when Yoldi, the melting consumed 90 to 95% of the sunlight and, thus , increased in ten and twenty times the length of the process of melting. If it were not for that purpose refreador, the whole process was completed in only 250 to 500 years instead of five millennia that effectively led. Under certain conditio ns, the annual training of water de- icer would have increased to the 480 cm, thus surpassing the average rainfall rain. In this case, the economy, water was determined by the m ass of water, released with the melting, which in any way would have been absorbed by t he soil of tundra, wet, newly- released with the retreat of glaciers. In this case, the waters have risen, had covered the plains and come to mingle with the sea water, making the whole land flooded brackish. If this had happened, or North America, nor the North W est Europe would have become centers of advanced civilization, because there where there were delayed because of the melting fields and forests, it would have formed marshes and swamps of brine, housing clusters of flies and mosquitoes. However, he wanted the fate that the decline of many glaciations undertake without causing catas trophic consequences, despite their huge tracts on both sides of the Atlantic.

All this time that the dark cloud of fog was suspended on th e northern regions had the effect of a pause for breath; fact fact also confirme d by archaeological findings in those respective strata. But the man, in his capacity as cre ator of culture, is also subject to their natural environment. The intermediate stages dark, inhospitable and inclement, the epiglacial stage, correspond to an intermediate stage in retrograde cultural evolution of man. The low point in its parallel weathe r is also an intermediate in the evolutionary process, the call the Stone Age, the Meso lithic period. Without doubt, the duration of the dark cloud of fog that turn ed into Niflheim the land of glaciers in northwestern Europe was determined by the remnants of flora, fauna and human life, for the most part wiped out by flood. She has specific climatic conditions that in turn generate specific standard forms, developed in plants, animals as well as contemporary man. Already know the effect of prolonged lack of light on plant life, the plants lose their chlorophyll, element of their assimilation and, in re sult, their leaves and stems become pale. The plant species of flora dryad, in poor light, such as drias, mosses and polar grams, also have the common feature of clear color, w hiten, caused by loss of its chlorophyll content. The plants that grew during millenni a under the cover of dark mist, under extremely difficult conditions for plant life , were the prototypes of the Flora dryad epiglacial and therefore even more lacking in chlorophyll and more discolored than those. The chlorophyll of the plants in assimilation is the hemoglobin of human and animal bodies, both in its functional and structural aspect. The lack of light and reduces the vitamin content of hemoglobin in red corpuscles in his blood, leaving them pale, anemic. People of all races, kept in darkness for long per iods, pale and lose their natural color, this effect is produced by the long polar n ight that lasts for six months. What would then have been caused by the fact that dark per iod of fog, which lasted for several millennia? There arises the question of how was the appearance of Nibelungos of dwarves decanted in Nibelungen epic, that would have populated Niflhei m. It can imagine them as anemic, pale. Your body should be adapted to that long per iod of darkness; inherited from ancestors, marked by conditions of his l ife and legacy in the posterior high power, these characteristics could be on the mark o f the man of Niflheim, which the meeting would have, genetically, evolving and changing intensity increased. Thus, it would be possible that this period of darkness was a pha se of incubation the formation of the so-called white race, post-glacial, pa le, or, more specifically, of the human skin lacks pigment. It is only this brief indication of how the event wo uld have caused the white race. There are many factors in favor of that argument, emph asizing the parallel with human \"albinoidismo\" of the Nordic landscape, marked both by la nd pale, washed by wet weather, on the brighter shades of the flowers, the s ilvery leaves of the trees, the white color of standard types of animal species and general cha racteristics of entire landscapes. While to the north, involving all the darkness, the huge clouds, stacked to heights of about 100 km and floating at altitudes from 200 to 300 km, were vis ible about 2000 kilometers away.

To imagine that these people have glimpsed how such traini ng of dark mist, just remember that the clouds of dust, with a much smaller, r aised with the eruption of Cracatoa to reach the upper layers of the atmosphere, w ere transformed into clouds of silver, which glowed, especially at night, as were its low luminosity of the Sun, already made. Now, imagine this phenomenon multiplied by twenty t housand times, this is then a rough idea of the cover bright, sparkling, covering the r egions of the North Pole. For the peoples of the South, always near the horizon, must have assumed the aspects of a ridge, moving gently, forty times higher than the Himala yas, reflecting target and the brightness of the Sun cegante the man of the South, the contemporary North appeared as a bright light flooded. Is for this reason was consi dered as the abode of the gods, as the stops divine? However, its brightness was only appar ent and misleading, because all the light was withdrawn, and therefore lost to the very focus of the irradiation. The people lived in these regions black darkness, while by far were taken as the successful, inhabiting the land of bright light. Moreover, still per sisting remnants of memories from those lands light in boreal regions.

However, the land of the Blessed was still apart of that mountain was inhabited by the legendary epigone of giants and Titans. Gradually, the imagination has to mix with the older ideas of Erebus, the dark country of oblivion. Clement of Alexandria identified t he land of the classics with hyperborean Champs Elysees and Ptolemy named the ocean hyperborean sea of the dead ... Perhaps, this was an unconscious memory, dating f rom time immemorial, and left by the stunning country of fog, there in the arcti c north, inhabited by gods forgotten, he found a distant echo in the soul of the ro mantic German poet, Eduard Mörike, mentioned in his song \"Orplid\" when speaking of \"my land, that it shines far ...\" These mists, broken long, conceal the very ancient pas t of Europe. With their veils covered also the origin of man in white. From disaster Atlantic, sharing the legacy of the man of Cro-Magnon Atlantic, the white man, Europea n, and red skin of his cousin, American, became the legitimate heirs to Atlantis.

Zero Day The Mayan Calendar At this point we just get a basic view, sufficiently br oad, so as to provide an overview of the whole problem with the Atlantis. The Atlantis existed, and \"during a single day and one night unchancy ill\" she disappeared, drowned. This sunset that, for the European-Asian history is li nked to the flood, made time, like no other event since the world is world, at least in historical times. The tremendous tuck that was heard when the \"The planetoid\" triggered the two sticks to beat on the"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" Atlantic tense skin was dark and the sound of a chord fina l geological period, and opening, inaugurating.a contemporary era. Based on eight geological estimates, made independently of one another and to have dating between 20,000 and 8,000 years old, was found the average va lue of 12,875 years, ie the year 10,900 BC, according to the Gregorian ca lendar. We think this gives average and fairly well with the timing of compiled by G eer, recognized and accepted as the best and most current and which was obtained by counting the tracks half a year in the Swedish bands decorating pottery Neolithic. Accor ding to the dating given by Plato, the disappearance of Atlantis should have occurred in 9560 BC, when very close to that found by de Geer. But also the timing indicated by Plato is very brief an d leaves to be desired as to its accuracy. Moreover, this same criterion applies to the estimate made by de Geer. Also, similar criterion applies to all other individual estimates in order geology and paleontology, still held on a much less secure. Neither can think of information purely mythical Genesis in the Bible, giving the year of Gre gorian 3308 BC as the date of the flood. Do with it would have exhausted all sources? Or there ar e other? Contrary to what would be expected, the first such source is in the tradition of Atlantis. The story of Plato is divided into two dialogue s. In one of the dialogues, critical, maternal brother of Plato, the symposium par ticipants to transmit what we heard about Atlantis from Solon and Drópides. This narra tive begins with the quote that gave the Gregorian year of 9560 BC However, the seco nd dialogue, the Egyptian priest of Neita, informant of Solon, take the word of mouth critical. The key point is the fact that part of the story apparently indicate a m ore precise date than that mentioned in the first dialog, then says: \"... According to our sacred books, the constitution of o ur state there since 8000 years. So your concidadões rise up 9000 years ago ...\" The \"our state is Egypt, it is the priest of Neita in s alts, to speak these words to Solon. It noted that Egypt existed when the war broke out with t he Atlantis, whose power is described as extending \"to Egypt and in Europe to Tirrenia. Therefore, it is there that the critical period should be dated not from 9000 but only 8,000 y ears before the visit of Solon in Egypt, ie from 8560 BC It seems that the Hell ene noticed and remembered only the date in a thousand years older and on their own pre-history, although the examination held in the text indicate, insofismavelme nte the season in a thousand years later, that is, the Gregorian date of 8560 BC This date, o nce corrected in a millennium, is confirmed by an excerpt in the journal \"Euterpe\" in H erddoto, written during his travels in Egypt. In Chapter 143 of the diary, Herodotus tells of a count of time that had been explained to him and the historiographer Mileto of Hecate, the pr iests of Amon in Tebas. The conversation took place opposite the huge wooden sarcophagi, closing the mummies of juice-priests who left his position, hereditary in c ertain families, for their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. \"They said: Each Piromis that lies in huge sarcophagi, a lways descends from another Piromis, and thus showed the sarcophagi 345, ending a generati on after another of Piromis without, however, make any god or hero ... The priests explained that all, there closed in sarcophagi, were descendants of the same family and trunk at all, not gods.

With a total of 345 priests would-juice as a period from 7000 to 8600, or 8000 years on average. According to the Gregorian calendar, the season dating back to around 8500 BC During these times, men have ruled the land Egypt, his prede cessors were \"gods\", beings that, like the Incas, in Peru god, do not live wit h the mortals, they subjugated. Would have been the Atlantis, these legendary giants of the time before the time, similar to quinames Central America and were only destr oyed by the ancestors of the people nahuas? Thus, Herodotus and Plato agree that the time was not cr itical of the 9000 but of 8000 years before their days. However, earlier this millennium has its meaning, bec ause it allows other options that until now and because of this difference, no longer come into question. These new sources come from the Mayan lands. Strictly speaking, one would expect to be carried out, as well as those lands are in the imme diate vicinity of Atlantis, also belonged to her strict framework of power and civilizati on. And if in some part around the globe were motivation enough for the memory of tha t day, marking time, then there would be, among the peoples of red skin, close relat ives living with the Atlantic and the Maya area, in Central America. These people, i n addition to participating in the culture and civilization Atlantis, were also their legi timate heirs. Their land, very hilly and therefore well protected against macaréus but had suffe red the devastating effects of the disaster Atlantic, yet allowed the shelter of some regions, except the total destruction. So it differently elsewhere, there were c onditions for the continuation of civilized life and its various manifestations. At this point, this argument still prove conclusive in the same way as has just proven the exis tence of the \"Island Block X\" and its identity with the Platonic Atlantis. However, there are strong reasons that make it more likely the presentation of arguments pro than aga inst this hypothesis. If there were to Atlantis, the origins of Maya civil ization remain incomprehensible, just as it is unintelligible to people without the name of Ti ahuanaco, at the edge of Lake Titicaca. Already mentioned, elsewhere, that some sign ificant evidence, findings in this port city never finished, mark a very important date, th e Gregorian years between 6500 and 9500 BC, depending on the aspect under which the changes are seen in prehistoric ecliptic obliquity. Also there is a more recent date th at the year 9500 BC, which we regard as the most likely. Moreover, the timing given in the Codex Troanus where h e says that \"happened 8060 years ago,\" is very close. Also indicate that dating before the ninth to the tent h millennium before our era. However, this indication is only a clue, not a fact, considering the unknown to date version of the text and little faith that does justice to the translation or interpretation of Brasseur. However, there is a document that leaves nothing to be desired as to its accuracy and unquestionable loyalty, is the Mayan calendar. Only lat e in date, the research succeeded in taking note of the document, repository of know ledge that enigmatic people, because of the religious fanaticism of the Spanis h conquistadors, shame on all points of view and for almost total eradication of civ ilizations of Central America, very early and higher than themselves. Virtually anything th at could be deciphered with reasonable ease, escaped the destructive Sanhá of achie vement. Well, as said C. W. Ceram, in his aforementioned book \"God, tomb and Wise\". \"... behind the soldiers, armed with swords and mounted on their horses, came the priests, and fires burned in the flames of the scriptures and images that could have"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" given us information. In a gigantic self-of-faith, Don Juan de Zumarraga, the first archbishop of Mexico, destroyed any and all written to them, the bishops and priests doing it and the soldiers devastated, with no less zeal, what might even have loft. When, in 1848, Lord Kingsborough concluded its collection of a ncient remnants of Aztec documents, their work did not include any piece of Spa nish origin? And what was that for us it was the Mayan documents, the time o f pre-conquest? Only three hand ... \" These manuscripts are still unreadable. One is the \"Code x Troanus. Indeed, so very strange, nor were the three authentic codices that hel ped in searches, but was rusty and a little read book, dating from 1566 and entitled \"Relationsh ip of Ias cosas de Yucatán\", written by Diego de Landa, the the second arch bishop of Iucatã, man imbued with strong Christian faith, but of thirst to kno w. It was a stroke of luck that Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg came to know this ke y element for deciphering the most important Mayan documents and she uses it. The book contains the symbols used by the Maya to identify their numbers, days and mont hs. In possession of this key element, has to be possible to interpret the language of the many changes reliefs, found in all temples, staircases, columns and friezes, which until then meant nothing, just left who looked surprised and astonished that pile of weird weird animalescas and human faces. Since then, suddenly realized that it was not mere orna ments, but of symbols, numbers, days and months, that is the most important astronomic al information. And, again, we give the floor to C. W. Ceram.: \"... In Maya art, executed and accumulated in the jungles, without the aid of animals or freight cars, cut in stone, masonry tools, with no or nament, relief or frieze of animal sculptures and none were found that were not in relations hip with a date! Each work of art was a Mayan calendar in stone. Nothing was left t o chance and aesthetics was the subject mathematics. If by then the world was surprised that with repetition, apparently without connection, or sudden solution of continuity of t hose horrible faces in stone, knew now that symbolized numbers, details of a timetabl e ... Around the globe, there is another calendar system, subject to the architecture a nd art, equal to that found in the Mayan land .. . \"(\" God, tomb and Wise \"). This discovery was indeed remarkable. Do the builders wer e mono-maniacs, building activity led to the idea of a fixed date which would be m ore accurate and can prevail over everything else? Hardly there another definition for that way of conce iving and executing works of art and construction, because, judging by the findings made, not the Maya built their temples of worship and works for both when there were r easons, such as a victory, or an epidemic something similar, but only and exclusively w hen the frequency to be raised CALENDARS sent. As a foreign decoration, these buildings took the date of its origin, thus documenting the observation and enforcement of the deadline set by the timing and dedication to serving the owner of the times. This concept was the point of where if repeated the cycle timing more important, the \"ring calendar\" covering the period of 52 years, new buildings have been erected around th e pyramids of churches that exist, even if they were the best preserved and t reated with the new perimeter always greater than that of the dating cycle past. In 1925, the western outskirts of Mexico City, within wal king distance of the heavy traffic of today's metropolis, was excavated the ancie nt pyramid of the serpent. But it was not a single temple, in the form of a pyramid, but a real \"cebolão\", with no fewer than eight \"shells\" - shells and that! - And bearing th e decoration symbolizing their"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" dates. These symbols show the fact that over 364 years, a new building was erected around the existing, is looking to implement the strict r egularity of the cycles of 52 years. Moreover, this same method of construction was found in temples excavated and studied at later dates. These works reveal a mentality completely out of the s eries and so far enigmatic. This puzzle, manifest in numerous buildings, can not be conditio nal on rational grounds, but must be understood and explained as originating in the nature of the people and the real owners of their works and religious. There is only one reasonable explanation for the mania of the Mayan calendar, which would be in fea r of the perished, psychological attitude seems justified. Anywhere around the globe, such instintosprimitivos found its expression in art and architecture to the point of influencing their creation s in the way of how the Mayan civilization was. This trend, quite prevalent among thes e people, so it seems, were the only ones to survive the disaster Atlantic, whose eff ects have suffered in the flesh, could not have arisen by chance, but must have a genuine motivation, well-defined. A historical event must have impressed the Maya and their ancestors in those lands and get them motivated to convey their knowledge and attitude o f all perished before it was considered as strong, firm, impregnable. This impress ion indelible, unforgettable experience, a trauma caused these people, who came to expr ess itself in an obsession, to the creation of all imaginable and possible measures to prevent the repetition of that event, which taught them that everything is perishable and made them see the total annihilation of power and greatness of man. What luck - it seems - our civilization was spared such t rauma! Otherwise, the external aspect and the spiritual content of our culture would be diff erent than today's are. It is reasonable to conclude that the fear of Maya, eternal ize in a thousand forms in rock hard, it relates to the existence of the ever present threat of sudden and total annihilation, as happened during the most terrible disaste rs recorded in the annals of mankind and that collapsed in the neighboring regions to th eir own living space, which eradicated the center of power and glory of time before the time. Such traumas and complexes are characterized by the fact, and depressing e xperience, eternally present in the mind of the individual, forces you to automanifestar and take place in search of an ebb. Among the Maya, this trend has found a unique opportunit y of expression through the contingency of amazing people that have the best an d oldest calendar in the world. This was the second and no less surprising discovery made in recent decades. For our subject, is of decisive importance. The two attributes of the Mayan calendar are in causal relationship, the Mayan calendar is the best to be the oldest in the world. Its accuracy, almost incredible, is due solely and exclusivel y to its great age, to cause species to astronomers. Thus, it follows the followin g example. The prof. Dr. Hans Ludendorff, for many years director o f the Astrophysics Observatory in Potsdam, eastern Germany, made the repo rt, among others, the famous astronomical entries in the \"Temple of the Sun\" in Pa lenque. For these reliefs, presumably dating from the first half of V century AD, t he conditions are exceptionally favorable, it is possible to prove their astronomical nature, without much to summarize first the Mayan calendar, adapting it to our counting of t ime. The inscription begins with a date \"older\", which is 1096134 days before the date of the final stretch of the main entry, which in turn is a \"time round\", which acc ording to Mayan chronology, is written as follows: 9.10.10.0.0. And now comes the most interesting, because 3001 years con sidered (365.25636 days of each) make up 1,096,134.3 days and exactly equal to the numerica l value Maya,"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" above, with a minimum difference of 0.3 days. Why the Ma ya chose this value rather than the apparently more \"round\" of 3,000 years considered? L udendorff respond: Presumably, because this range is 2748 to synods revolutions of Jupiter. It is the probability of 1:50.000, by chance, a given range is within the tolerance specified and at the same time, represent an integral multiple of the year and the sidereal revolution of any planet synod, so that feels as Ludendorff, here, the random factor is virtually eliminated. \" In another and equally prominent place in the \"Temple of the Cross\" in Palenque, is another date, showing the interval between that date a nd the earliest date, in the \"Temple of the Cross\", which is 1380070 days . And, again, repr esents a multiple integral of the year and the sidereal revolution synod o f the planet Mars, because 3803 years are considered equal to 1,380,069.9 days; 1781 revolutions syno ds of Mars are equal to 1,380,066.0 days. \"Although this last figure differs by 4 days of the above range, it stressed that, due to marked eccentricity of the orbit of the planet Mars, t he period of his synod revolution is much more difficult to determine as in the case of J upiter.\" (H. Ludendorff). When converting data from the Mayan calendar to the Gr egorian calendar, that the \"round\" Mayan date (9.10.10.0.0) corresponds to our February 5, 383, when the Sun was exactly in the middle between the two fixed stars very clear, the Antares (Alpha Scorpil) and Aldebaran (Alpha Tauro). This verification was made by the Mayas, without the aid of the telescope, thanks to the observa tion heliaca sunset and the birth of a star, when the sun coincides with the Ludendorff fi nally conclude: \"Only the study of inscriptions of Palenque can deduce that the Maya had knowledge accurate, almost incredible, the sidereal year and the ranges of the revolution of the planets. As you were not astronomical instruments of pr ecision, the observations made by them should have been continued by extremely long peri ods of time, because only thus would have achieved the high precision of their astr onomical data ... \" However, so far the archaeologists have not found the quantity expected and wanted the material remnants of those times imemoráveis wh ere the trial of scientific Ludendorff, took home the Mayan Astronomy. However, as ever more modern instruments can detect objects and sophisticated and alwa ys higher multimilenares, will be difficult to correct Astronomy its opinions, but it to revise its criteria for Archaeological dating. It seems that virtually no plausible conditions to inva lidate the arguments of Ludendorff, because otherwise you could explain how a people without instruments to tell time and measure angles minimum, would have possessed a timetable for such extraordinary precision? Whereas only the facilities today's offer accurate astronomical knowledge, to be held within a relatively short time or in the course of a few centuries, it is reasonable to conclude that the high quality of th e Mayan calendar is linked to their very old age. Although researchers say that the accuracy of the Maya n calendar necessarily involves the assumption of the existence of ancient traditions, continue the search, even fruitless, a plausible scheme arithmetic, thanks to whi ch the Mayan astronomers have computed its incredible starting date, working backwards forw ard and, thus, obtained the accuracy of their calendar, a stroke of luck for a h appy discovery - intuitive? - Without, for both, had made observations over long perio ds. Therefore, the more assured is the origin of the Atlantic Astronomy Mayan calendar and the fact that the critical date of its \"A Day Zero\" take immediately, st raight for the Atlantic season's disaster that, according to Plato, Herodotus and the Codex Troanus should be placed"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" in the ninth millennium before our era, or around 8500 BC, in accordance with the Gregorian calendar. The \"A Day Zero\" of the Mayan chronology is the 5th o f June in the year 8498 BC Gregorian, therefore, it is surprising there exactly wh ere the other two dating, much less guaranteed, have guess it. If this date is correct, then we able to determine no t only the day of the disappearance of Atlantis, but the time about the beginning of the dis aster Atlantic. Then we will prove our thesis that the \"A Day Zero\" o f the Mayan calendar in fact determines the date of the disaster Atlantic. First of all, it must clarify the basic question, objection, concerning the right days to be fix ed for the beginning chronologically. The following historical examples ans wer this question: The Roman chronology is the counting of years \"ab urbe Condit,\" since the founding of Rome, and its capital city. The Christianity to the years' post Christum natum \", starting with the birth of Christ, the Savior of the world. This count, however, presumabl y wrong in seven years, was initiated by Dionísio Areopagitou and is valid for the Ch ristian era. Anyway, the crucial point is the event that marked the season and is beginni ng, or at least there is supposed. So, to make a plausible choice, the \"A Day Zero\" of th e Maya have been set an event that marked the second time. If the day of the fall of \"The planetoid,\" then one could say with full and complete right, to mark time, from all points of view across the meaning of the word. He marked the destruction of the cen ter of prifnitivas civilizations of the peoples of red skin in the Atlanti c, and brought suffering to remember that Maya has since never managed to get rid o f the idea of fixed periodic repetition of such disasters. This idea forced them to r aise architectural works, considered protective against the evil spirits, how many human sacrifices, year after year and put all their life with their creative potenti al, in the field of timing, supreme god of his thought and of their actions. This event also marked a geological time, advancing the h ands of Geology of the fourth to the fifth field. Finally, the event also launched a new climate cycle. The plant life, largely independent of the sun during the Quaternary course, presumably when th e ecliptic obliquity was much less pronounced, was then suddenly subject to solar per iods. This fact alone is enough for a people, driven by timing and a great vocation for Astronomy, choose a new \"The Zero Day\" to mark the beginning of a new geolo gical period, with weather conditions entirely changed. In fact, if throughout the entire existence of mankind, since the world is world, there was a day to mark time, then this would be characterize d as the bearer of doom and dread overall. The Mayan car had just reason to designate this as their \"A Day Zero.\" In its history was the largest and deepest water splitte r, as amply illustrated by his habit of chronology and the calendar. The second question refers to prior foreign term \"A Day Zero.\" Was introduced by modern astronomers to define the day zero \"absolute\", a dding the letter \"A\" (= absolute), to distinguish him from another day zero, set in more recent times of our history and that takes the attributes \"common\" or \"his toric.\" This \"day zero\" prior history in 13 long cycles of 144,000 days each, or 5127 years and 132 days the \"A Day Zero\" which, according to the Gregorian calendar, falls on October 15, 3373 BC It should be only the brief comment to that end, must h ave been decisive to the choice of Mayan timelines for the number thirteen. Presumabl y, a long sequence of 13 cycles,"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" or \"baktum\", a term meant. If, after the conquest, on l and timelines indigenous Mayans were still capable of calculating according to their anc ient traditions, then deemed paid, the next day one would have fallen in the year 1754. The frequency \"baktum\" had the time to string center, wit h twenty \"baktums\" ending in the year 613 BC and the Gregorian marking the end of last y ear before the extended cycle of the Christian era. Calculated from that date, the \"A Day Zero\" is the last of the previous 20 years, which marked the beginning of a cycle \"b aktum. The astronomer Henseling said the following about the un iqueness of that day: \"But - and this is the decisive point - only at one amo ng the 21 beginning of long cycles (days zero baktum\"), followed by Maya, 613 to 8498 BC, the very nature gave rise to justify the setting the beginning of one of the three elements chronologically. Indeed, the only beginning of long cycle in line with th e time of the Maya was the first day zero \"baktum\" in early June 8498 BC (Gregorian calendar). Then, the astronomical evidence for the argument, that this first day zero \"baktum\" was in fact a legitimate \"A Day Zero\" and, therefore, the real first day of the Mayan chronology. The chronology of Mayan astronomical was supported by fo ur elements. First, based on the counting of days, started on \"day one\" and has sin ce continued. In this respect, Henseling said: His invention and use predispose an extraordinary scienti fic maturity, which only since the last three centuries we have to monitor condition s equally (though not strictly equal values we present ...)\". This count of the days leading to the frequency \"baktum. It stressed that the selection of the figure \"baktum\" - 144,000 days - was just brilliant, bec ause it can be divided up to full (14 of the first 20 digits) and is a useful chronologi cal unit, which lends itself well optimally for all operations. Beside the counting of days, admirable in itself, was th e count of years. Thus, the unit practice was the \"Haab\", the calendar year, divided in 18 cycles (months) of 20 days each, plus five additional days. It follows that, millen nia before the Timeline of Egypt, Mesopotamia and the scope of cities, the Maya had an ex act idea of the number of days of the solar year, but the divided differently from the Babylonians, whose counting system was different. Four \"Haab\" formed a group of four, corresponding to the cyc le of the Julian calendar correction, and somewhat accurate, four times thirteen \"Haab\" completed a period of 52 calendar years, the exact interval when new perimete rs were built around the hills of temples. Still ignored the question of choosing a course o f 52 years. Twenty-nine cycles of these calendars have the period of correction, itself, the Mayan chronology for the solar year. To them, 20 cycles of 1508 calendar \"Haab\", ie calendar years, 1507 years were at the tropical sun. The comparativ e table below illustrates the accuracy of the Mayan calendar, due to this period of cor rection, which was much higher in the calculation of Sotis, the ancient Egyptia ns. In the first column, the table lists the names of the chronological systems, used by way of comparison, the second column is indicated the cycle of correction, in calenda r years (from 365 days), adopted by each of the systems under consideration, in the thi rd column is the number of days, calculated on that basis, the tropical solar year, the fourth column shows the residual differences, accumulated over a million years and express ed in days, the difference from the actual solar tropical year which, according to the latest research, is 365.242 198 days. "},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":" CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE As for its accuracy, the Mayan calendar outperforms all the older models as well as the Gregorian calendar, which, in this respect, surpasses in almost five times. The exact value of the astronomical period of correction would be of the order of 1507.03. If the timelines Maya, instead of choosing the full number 1508, h ad chosen the next whole number, 1507, which could easily have done, they would have a chieved even greater accuracy and, thus, a lower residual difference of two day s only . But then the divisibility of the whole would have been prejudiced becaus e the number 1507 can only be divided by the product of 11 times 137, while 1508 can be divided by 4 and by 13 and 29, important figure in Mayan chronology. So the timel ines ancient Mayans used in their period of correction that value which, besides offering the best divisibility, most approached the ideal value of 1507.03. They could hardly have done better choice for a practical timetable of long periods. Furthermore, the minimum residual difference, one day in about 14 millennia, was minor, since their c hronology knew employ two other methods of correction. A continuous count of days and \"baktum\" and the frequency of years and sequences Catende, were under the permanent control of a cycle of 260 days, also continuous, called \"tzolkin\" in the Aztec language \"surface-lamatl,\" based on the pace of solar and lunar eclipses and easy to use, as the product of 13 x 20. The second method was based on astronomical correction to change the appearance of Venus, the planet clear that among the Aztecs was dedica ted to Quetzalcoatl. This planet, near the Sun, shows changes similar in appearanc e to the Moon, but its period is longer. In exact numbers, this period is 1.6 years, per haps less than two hours, the second Svante Arrhenius, that has caused the Mexican in troduce a negative correction to deduct one day after a string of twelve periods of Venus . Here's the equation: 104 \"Haab\" = 65 = 146 periods of Venus' tzolkin \"allowing the ea sy management of correction and has amazing accuracy. In any case, we may say that the system time and it was absolutely guaranteed the Mayan astronomers could have full confidence.

In this respect Henseling comments: \"You can not consider this factual situation as the work of chance.\" However, the opening date still more than Henseling suspe cted, since today's astronomy, in any way, or far, considering any link be tween that date inaugural \"The Zero\" and the mythical Atlantis. These motivations do not even enter into debate, just missing causes sufficiently explicit to clarify precisel y why this day was chosen as the \"The Zero.\" Henseling tends to assume that the triple c ycle of the Sun, Moon and Venus, above, would have the choice of that \"day zero\".

Abstract Thanks to Maya chronology, allowing the establishment of the exact time the beginning of the period quintenário we obtained a more val uable for trial and comparison of facts and events of the past. For Geology , the element sets the date of transition of the fourth to the fifth, the current per iod; for Paleontology, indicates an exact date for the period generally regarded as Mesolithic , somewhat indefinite time, a gap opened between the two phases of advanced civilization s, marking the Palaeolithic and Neolithic periods. With the retreat of the date magn a in approximately one millennium to 8498 BC, the Pre-History profit, besides the desired precision, a range of additional 1000 years of that period of time before the inexplicable times, with its primitivíssimas civilizations, whose motivation until now was totally in the dark. Now beginning to be unveiled the mystery that these remote civilizations flourished on the banks of the Nile and the Euphrates, within the cities, and that marked the megalithic constructions, all chal-fade simultaneously around 4000 BC Ev erywhere new life sprouted then ground post diluvial and on the ruins left by th e side effects, posterior of the disaster Atlantic. The dating of prehistoric findings, retreating by 30 millen nia or so, may be made by radiological tests in the case of organic material. It was found that all living beings in their metabolism lead to a very small amount of radioa ctive carbon isotope, C-14 as specified. This isotope is produced in the upper layers of th e atmosphere, where cosmic radiation is more intense and diffusely added to th e casing air. The receipt of such excessive radioactive substances causes the death o f the living, by stopping the metabolism of the receiver. The radioactive atoms al ready accepted, assimilated, is disintegrating, as its duration, the decomposition of radia tion, emitted by them, declines in a defined, its activity is measurable and th en concludes by time since the death of the individual. This method is quite controllable and it is even more true. Thus, the carbon 14 test with the cork of a sequoia of so me 3000 years of age has its timing, this result was checked by counting the rings of t he years presented by the tree, the two values have difference of only 10%. Therefore, this method is more precise and accurate estimates that all prehistoric or geologica l. The highly positive results"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":" have made a whole series of these latest estimates w ere subject to the control of radiological test. For our subject, only two of those e stimates are of particular interest, as follows. It was possible to determine with any precision the dat e of the last advance of glaciers in the west and east of the Atlantic. In the U.S., t he State of Wisconsin, District Two Creeks of the last advance of glaciers smashed a pine fo rest, knocking down the trunks of trees and leaving them on the path towards expansion of the glacier, with the crown pointing toward southwest. Then overtook the change of cl imate, the ice melted and the left shows the pine devastated. For the test with carbon 14, the American naturalist Willard Frank Libby determined that this event occurred 11, 000 years and not 25,000 years ago, as previous estimates. The date established by Libby is the time around 9050 BC It follows that in North America the last advance of glaciers occurred before dis aster Atlantic. A forest of birch, in Europe, had the same fate suffere d by the pine forest in Two Creeks. For this event, Libby found a range of 10,800 years back, this result is the date of 9050 BC and gives fully with the timing of the destruction of pine forest in Wisconsin. The test blocks of peat and mud, taken from lakes in Englan d, from the glaciers and to capture the waters of melting, gave the value of range of 10,831 and with mud from glacier in Iceland in 11,310 years, these results also conf er with that obtained for the Wisconsin, USA. Taking the average of these values, it is approximately 11,000 years. Therefore, the end of the Quaternary must have occurred after the last advance of glaciers on both sides of the Atlantic. Although this f inding contradicted the official opinions until now in force, and fully confirms the date of the disaster Atlantic, set in the year 8498 BC Libby also performed tests with post-glacial remnants. Assumed that the timing is correct, they should give a value below the range of 8498 + 1950 = 10,500 years approximately. So let's test the result of research conducted by Libby . In 1927 was found an arrow tip of strangely striated, and near the remains of a buffal o. This finding was made near Folsom, New Mexico, USA. Other tips roof of the same type, with identical bones of buffalo were found in various regions of the USA., Were regarded as remnants of the \"Man of Folsom, the so-called\" early man of America \"- primitive man of America. These findings by Folsom, made in Texas, some bones of buffalo, calcined, were examined by Libby, the test determined the age at 9883 year s and this, again, gives the past. Once more, there was yet another confirmation. In o ne of the caves in the State of Oregon, USA., Collapsed many years ago, L. S. Cressman, University of Oregon, found a deposit of some 200 pairs of sandals, made of vegetabl e fiber and in very good state of repair, the labor force caused by species, for their high quality. Libby determined the age of sandals as of 9035 years. Calcined bon es of animals and horses, sloth, found with pieces of artifacts, proved that, sinc e more than nine millennia ago, man has lived in the Strait of Magellan. It was then the man from home after diluvial that aft er the change of climate, came to populate the earth once frozen. In Central America, in warmer areas, spared by frost, were found traces of man antediluvial. In the periphery o f a region once wetland, near Tepexpán in Mexico, which today serves as a bull-fightin g ring, were found fossilized remains of a primitive man, alongside bones of a specie s of elephant, now extinct. Helmut de Terra tested these findings and determined the age of the stratum as 11,000"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":" to 12,000 years. Some samples of peat, withdrawn from the r egion were subjected to Libby, who set their age at 11,300 years, confirming the pr evious corresponding datings. Libby also tested charcoal, a stove found in th e cave near Lascaux, France, under the famous cave paintings of the era of glaciation, the test showed 15,516 years. The following table gives the summary of test values: Charcoal, the cave of Lascaux, France .. 15,516 Sludge from glacier, Iceland ................ 11,310 TurtadeTepexpán, Mexico ............. 11300 Advancing glaciers of the last, on average ... 11000 Quaterna ry Pine for TwoCreeks, Wisconsin, USA .............. 11,000 Wood of birch, Northern Europe ..... 10,800 Blocosde peat, England .............. 10831 Bones of buffalo, found in Folsom, USA ........ 9,883 Findings of sandals, Oregon, USA ......... 9035 quintenário Findings of bone, Patagonia .............. 9,000 The table above allows us to determine with accuracy t he date of that disaster that ended the Quaternary and opened the quintenário. Magna that date must be between the last advance of glaciers and the first time guarante ed, postglacial, so it should be at most 11,000 and at least 9,883 years ago, possibly in the middle of that range, the average value would be 10,440 years ago, with a tolerance of 560 years plus or minus. This value corresponds to the date of the disaster, as f ollows: 110,440 minus 1,950 = 8490 BC (Gregorian date) Also, with this the start date of the Mayan calendar reveals its identity with insofismável the time of the disaster, inaugurating the quintenário. However, the findings confirm yet another American th ing. Supposed that the man of Folsom that the second test of Libby, lived for more than nine millennia ago and manufacturing the sandals, of which the caves of Oregon found a stock of 200 pairs, he was practical in that branch of manufacture until able to manufacture in series. So this proves that, long before the origin of the early post-gl acial populations of the Sumerians, a civilization already existed elsewhere appr eciable. The same should be true for the man in the timing of glaciations, a littl e older. Moreover, considering the fact that among the generations before and post-glacial was a tremendous cataclysm of destructive global effects, the finding of sandals should b e interpreted as meaning that the man survived that disaster it still managed to save and keep a vestige of civilization, whose level is evidenced by this finding. This sequence o f reasoning, it is the following conclusion: the older generations of earlier eras that disaster, which revolutionized the earth, and which fully met the conditions to develop its own civilization, should have achieved a level of progress and cultural development and hi gher than shown by several archaeological findings in question. Thus the date established magna is fully guaranteed by the Science, as during the subsequent millennia history, more accessible to the s cientific control, a few dates with certain security equal to that. The identity of the flo od time, undoubtedly the end of the Quaternary catastrophic, with \"A Day Zero\" of the May an calendar, is established without a doubt, it does not discuss the legitimacy of tha t schedule. Regarding the problem of Atlantis, that is what is the importance of the Mayan calendar and its control by radiological tests. For thi s reason that we know that we get from the prehistoric stones of temples deserts. The ev idence clearly confirms the"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":" narrative of the supposed Platonic legendary island, and th eir needs precisely those passages that most were put in doubt and say it as the cen ter of a civilization far advanced, highly sophisticated, whose sinking was \"8000 years before Solon, and is accompanied by earthquakes, macaréus rain and flood. The Bo ok of Books, the myths and legends of many peoples, the sterile layer of mud diluvi al, found under the remains of the first Sumerian civilization, all this comes t o prove the authenticity of these results, we have just exposed. Postscript Publisher The Prophet The dormecido Valeria by an omission fail to mention, after this scientific argument, the \"prophecies\" of the \"sleeping prophet\" North American, the spiritual h ealer Edgar Cayce, who died in 1945, in Virginia, USA. Between 1923 and 1944, in a state of trance, Cayce gave hundreds of interviews, which always hit the enigma of Atlantis, for these o ccasions he entered in connection with alleged that once people have lived there. Turning to you, or was aware of his statements, made in a state of trance, and were absol utely uninterested in it. In one of these \"conferences\", as used to draw their interviews, Cayce explained that Posêidia, thus referring to Atlantis, it would be one of the isla nd complex of the waves again in the not too distant future. Charles Berlitz addressed the se prophecies, commenting: \"This strange archaeological prophecy was confirmed in s ome regions and even according to the plans by many findings in the sand banks of the Bahamas, where some buildings appeared, to the left shows the trip and the surve y the ocean bottom. However, the case would be to ask if these findings were made according to the prophecies, or because of the prophecies, or because people , aware of the phenomenon Cayce, were searching for them, as happened with some c ommanders of aircraft , the first sights to those buildings or facilities submarine. \" Alleged that the conferences of Cayce and the legends of antiquity were based on real events, it would be possible to imagine forces, possibly generated by a pre-scientifically advanced civilization, which were still active in the regions where once were concentrated. Also, it can entertain the possibility of the electronic and magnetic anomalies, and of gravitation, in the Bermuda Triangle, representing a legacy, even negative, of a culture lost in time to the point of hav ing almost no trace left of this and our souvenirs civilization before they were certain t hat the intuitive facts. With this, Charles Berlitz, author of \"The OF BERMUD A TRIANGLE\", refers to other reports of Cayce, who mentioned in his lectures often mysterious energy sources, supposedly irradiated submerged the island, which he would be n uclear in nature and could be compared with laser and Maser of our present. Cay ce described these energy sources and it has amazing detail, although his time ther e or even comparable energy sources. Often also remarkable, Cayce spoke to the inha bitants of Atlantis, the creators of those energy sources, they abused the point of losing their control, then just when to cause the destruction of peoples and the world they lived: \"... The man brought the destructive forces that then a ttach to the natural gas reserves, the natural forces and forms, caused the worst of all t he eruptions, which rose up from the depths of the earth, in slow process of cooling and that part (Atlantis) now located in the vicinity of the Sargasso Sea was the first to sink into the sea ... \" In another conference, Cayce said the sinking of Atlan tis civilization: \"... The use of solar energy, including to the radius, lea ding to the disintegration of the"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":" atom, was therefore the destruction of the earth.\" The fact in this book, be mentioned the name of a sci entist who was not and did his statements on the Atlantic in state of full conscious ness, but in a state of trance, is that the high concept that it enjoyed, due to their prophecies. It is a miracle that their reports on the submerged Atlantis were taken seriously, e ven in scientific circles, but which were received with some caution and reserve. Additional Epilogue Several of the theories raised by Otto H. Muck find con firmation in the book \"the triangle of Bermuda,\" by Charles Berlitz. Thus, the lat ter author mentions that the vast areas, formerly continental and submarine today, were part of the Mediterranean regions, including the land bridge between Africa and Gibra ltar, and between Sicily and Italy, large areas of the North Sea, the continental shelves of Ireland, France, Iberia and Africa, the submerged plateaus around the Azores, the C anary Islands and Madeira, the backbone of the Cape of San Vicente, the Azores, the dorsal-central Atlantic, continental shelves of the Americas North and South and especially the sand banks of the Bahamas that before were covered by the waters, occupying thousands of square kilometers of surface above sea level. \"There is abundant evidence, showing that over the last ten or twelve millennia these areas were above sea level. Therefore, a Soviet expe dition, operating north of the Azores, then withdrew, a depth of more than 2,000 m , a bl ock of rock, formed 17,000 years ago, under atmospheric pressure, a team of divers wh o in the nineteenth century, near the Azores, fixed a transatlantic cable, brought to the surface a piece of ta-quilita, vitrified lava, formed below sea level, atmospheric pre ssure. The age of these findings was found to be approximately 12,000 years''. Based on this and other results of research is reasona ble to conclude that large areas in the vicinity of today's Azores Islands, were once abo ve the waves of the Atlantic. \"Other discoveries made recently, seem to confirm the correct timing of the last flooding of vast areas in the Atlantic, giving the year of 11,000 BC, this also gives the date of the third glacial stage.\" For exhibitions of Muck know that those details to give way to the remarkable story of Atlantis and the Platonic dialogue between Timeu and Crit eria, speaking of a great continent, \"nine thousand years ago, would have existed i n the ocean outside. According to Berlitz, there is clear evidence of a mas sive continental Caribbean Sea, whose peaks, coming on the waves, could be the Anti them . In this context, Berlitz mentions the results of surveys conducted by an expedition of the University of Duke in 1969 that examined the bed of the Caribbean Sea and too k soil samples in various parts of the backbone of Birds, which extends along the east coast of the basin Venezuela, between Venezuela and the Virgin Islands. The samples of soil contained a granite and acid eruptive rocks. For these findings, Berlit z cites the statement of Dr. Bruce Heezens, a renowned oceanographer: \"Until now, the geologists admitted, generally, that ligh t-colored granite rocks and erosive acid were found only in the continents and the earth crust, below sea level, the basalt was heavy, dark ... Therefore, the appearance of granite rock, shades of clear, might enhance the old theory that, in times past, ther e was a mass of land in the eastern Caribbean region and those rocks were the inside of a c ontinent eperdido submerged. Recently, Archeology introduced the technique of air photo graphy in their research."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" Thus, the platform of the Bahamas, where the shallow waters not have been discovered numerous traces of buildings submerged, Berlitz reports in t his regard: \"In many parts of the sand banks of the Bahamas there are plenty of amazing large squares, rectangles, crosses, lines long, arranged in para llel road that eventually would have been, at times, continuing in right angle, sometim es in concentric circles, triangles, octagons and other geometric figures. There is even a \"sea wall\" of each 9 m in height and 160 km long, which, near the mouth of the Rio Orinoco, the Venezuelan coast, get aw ay, sea. At first glance, one would judge that it was of natural origin, however the tra ck straight and his constitution ultimately invalidate this first impressio n. \" Of course, these findings on the platform of the Bahama s have also complicate the unmasking of the mystery of Atlantis. As it is in our kn owledge, Plato, the most famous of all the commentators of Atlantis, the anci ent, thought that the lost continent was located in front of the \"Pillars of Hercules\" in any part of the Atlantic Ocean, but more towards the Gibraltar. This idea seems to be in contradiction with the sub-ines discoveries made in the Bahamas platform and the east c oast of Venezuela. However, there may be an explanation for this apparent contradic tion, because rereading the Platonic narrative with due attention, there is the f ollowing passage: \"... In view of the mouth that you used to call the Pil lars of Hercules there was an island, whose extent was greater than that of Asia an d Libya combined, and from there, it was then possible to cross to the other islands, a nd those islands, for the whole continent, in front and around that sea, which the fai r way, takes its name. \" In view of this, is not out of the question the suppositi on that Atlantis, although a large island, not a single island, but throughout a large archipel ago, forming a bridge to the Americas. According to Berlitz, this huge empire, I would have done the island today's also the islands of Grand Bahamas and the Atlantic are as that today are of greater depth, more like the language of the Ocean (Tongue ofOceari ) and the Straits of Florida. \"They formed an internal bay and a barrier in front o f the coast of Florida who, at the time, was much greater extent, entering the ocean ... A glance at the current scale of depths in the Atlantic west clearly shows that if the sea level was lowered by 200 to 250 m, small islands in the Atlantic today would be much hi gher. And the fascinating idea of relating the rise of water, occurred 11,000 years ago , with the narrative of Plato. \" Recently took rejuvenate the debates around the theory t hat the Aegean is the right place to engage the search for Atlantis. Jacques-Ives Co usteau, the famous underwater explorer, focused their attention on the island of Sant orim, Is the island of antiquity, to the north of Crete, within the cities. For years, t he archaeological research converge on the region, where in 1967 a group formed by American scienti sts and Greeks, Santorim excavated, a city minóica, meanwhile identified as a c enter of civilization, dating from 1500 BC and clearly guided by Crete. Then also the question re appeared on Atlantis. At the time the issue was raised, still open, whether perhaps the enigmatic civilization minóica carriers, whose mysteries are still waiting for clarification, to the legendary inhabitants of Atlantis. Millennia before the creat ion of Greek temples, they have decorated their palaces with frescoes, now regarded as th e impressionist style and dotavam us of ceramics of high artistic value. The narrative of Plato, Atlantis located in front of the \"Pillars of Hercules\", or anywhere in the Atlantic Ocean, absolutely contradict s this thesis. Moreover, the signs do not give time of Plato with those pertaining to the destinations of Santorim, it was"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" found that some 3,500 years ago the eruption violentíssima o f a powerful volcano in Santorim destroyed much of the island, which then was l iterally designed to air . This event marked the end of the tragic and sudden flourishing civ ilization minóica. Therefore, there is marked discrepancy between the dates of Atlantis and fatal Santorim, for which some researchers have tried a no convincing explanation. They said: Probably Solon, who brought the story of Atlanti s in Egypt, would have confused the Egyptian word for \"100\" with \"1000\" and, thus, with the diff erence to less than zero for both the fateful years, and for the calculati ng the area of the island, in fact, would approximate values, defensible minóica for culture an d the island empire of Atlantis (900 years before Solon, instead of 9,000 years, 200, 000 km2, instead of 2 million km2 of surface). Thus, Plato, the great philosophe r and statesman, and Solon, the great public men, are accused of an unspeakable negligenc e. Moreover, that has not been adequately explained the loc ation of the island. But for both there is also a possibility, trying to find a com mon denominator for both assumptions. \"Perhaps Crete has been one of the eastern provinces of the empire and its civilization enigmatic Atlantis was only a legacy of the great cultur e of Atlantis?\" It is in the book \"ATLANTIS\" - Atlantis, researcher of the American A. Braghin, who dedicated all his life in search of the legendary submerge d continent. After exhaustive studies of all the authentic sources and field searches, conducted by the author on the premises, Braghin concluded that, around 9550 BC, a cosmic cat aclysm of global proportions, precisely this culture destroyed Atlantis and then deducted that: \"Probably the Cretan and Phoenician were part of the second migratory wave, from Atlantis ... For Homer says that Minos, the king of C rete, was a descendant of Deucalião (the hero of the deluge) and the beautiful old Eur ope ... According to sources \"Europe\" means \"Daughter of the Country of Men of Red Skin\" and this interpretation is the synonym of Greek Cretan - \"Phoi nix\" - indicating the origin of an Atlantic country, or American. \" As already mentioned, in recent time, other researche rs doubled their efforts to find tangible traces of the Atlantic submerged island empire o f Atlantis. Moreover, it discovered an interesting quote here, discussed by some new spapers in order to make it competitor of Atlantis. A group of internationally renowned oceanographers at the University of Miami, Florida, think he had discovered another continent submer ged, based on tests of soil samples from the Atlantic bed in the range of 600 to 1000 m de pth. His theory is based on the assumption, there are about 70 million years ago, an unknown continent in length have been inserted between the tectonic plates, then separated, Africa and America. At the time of emergence of the new contine nt, the Atlantic Ocean, led to the reciprocal removal of the plates of Africa and America , would not past the current size of the Red Sea. According to theory, millions of years later, this intermediary continent sank, swallowed by a bending in the ocean, going into the east-west, between Central Africa and Northern South America When in the opinion of geologists, the massive land, newly discovered, would have disappeared long before th e mysterious continent of Atlan-taken have been populated.
