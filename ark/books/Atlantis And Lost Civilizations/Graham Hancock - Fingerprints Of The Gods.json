Acknowledgements Fingerprints of the Gods could not have been written without the generous, warm-hearted and sustaining love of my partner Santha Faiia— who always gives more than she ta kes and who enriches the lives of everyone around her with creativity , kindness and imagination. All the photographs in the book are her work. I am also grateful for the support and encouragement of our six children—Gabrielle, Leila, Luke, Ravi, Sean and Shanti—each one of whom I feel privileged to know. My parents, Donald and Muriel Hancoc k, have been incredibly helpful, active and involved through this and many other difficult times and projects. Together with my uncle James Macaulay they have also patiently read the drafts of the evolving manuscript, offering a wealth of positive suggestions. Thanks, too, to my oldest and closest friend, Peter Marshall, with whom I have weathered many st orms, and to Rob Gardner, Joseph and Sherry Jahoda, Roel Oostra, Jose ph and Laura Schor, Niven Sinclair, Colin Skinner and Clem Vallance, all of whom gave me good advice. In 1992 I suddenly found that I had a friend in Lansing, Michigan. His name is Ed Ponist and he got in touch with me soon after the publication of my previous book, The Sign and the Seal . Like a guardian angel he volunteered to devote a hefty chunk of his spare time to helping me out in the US with research, contacts and the collection of documentary resources of relevance to Fingerprints of the Gods . He did a brilliant job, always sending me the right books ju st when I needed them and finding references that I didn’t even know existed. He was also an accurate weather-vane on the quality of my work, whose judgement I quickly learned to trust and respect. Last bu t not least, when Santha and I went to Arizona, to the Hopi Nation, it was Ed who came with us and who opened the way. Ed’s initial letter was part of an overwhelming deluge of mail that I received from around the world after writing The Sign and the Seal. For a while I tried to answer all the letter s individually. Eventually, however, I got swamped with the new work on Fingerprints and had to stop replying. I feel bad about this, and woul d like to take this opportunity to thank everybody who wrote to me and to whom I did not write back. I’m intending to be more systematic in the future because I enormously value this correspondence and appreciate th e high-quality information that it frequently turns out to contain ...

Hapgood, Keene College, Keene, New Hampshire. Dear Professor Hapgood, Your request for evaluation of certain unusual features of the Piri Reis World Map of 1513 by this organization has been reviewed. The claim that the lower part of the map portrays the Princess Martha Coast of Queen Maud Land Antarctica, and the Palmer Peninsula, is reasonable. We find this is the most logical and in all probability the co rrect interpretation of the map. The geographical detail shown in the lower part of the map agrees very remarkably with the results of the seismic profile made across the top of the ice-cap by the Swedish- British Antarctic Expedition of 1949. This indicates the coastline had been mapped before it was covered by the ice-cap. The ice-cap in this region is now about a mile thick. We have no idea how the data on this map can be reconciled with the supposed state of geographical knowledge in 1513. HAROLD Z. OHLMEYER Lt Colonel, USAF Commander Despite the deadpan language, Ohlmeyer’s letter 1 is a bombshell. If Queen Maud Land was mapped before it was covered by ice, the original cartography must have been done an extraordinarily long time ago. How long ago exactly? Conventional wisdom has it that the Antarctic ice-cap, in its present extent and form, is millions of years old. On closer examination, this notion turns out to be seriously flawed—so seriously that we need not assume the map drawn by Admiral Piri Reis depicts Queen Maud Land as  1 Letter reproduced in Charles H. Hapgood FRGS, Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings, Chilton Books, Philadelphia and Ne w York, 1966, p. 243."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 14 it looked millions of years in the pa st. The best recent evidence suggests that Queen Maud Land, and the neighb ouring regions shown on the map, passed through a long ice-free period which may not have come completely to an end until about six thousand years ago. 2 This evidence, which we shall touch upon again in the next chapter, liberates us from the burdensome task of explaining who (or what) had the technology to undertake an accurate geographical survey of Antarctica in, say, two million BC , long before our own species came into existence. By the same token, since map-making is a complex and civilized activity, it compels us to explain how such a task could have been accomplished even six thousand years ago, well before the development of the first true civilizations recognized by historians. Ancient sources In attempting that explanation it is worth reminding ourselves of the basic historical and geological facts: 1 The Piri Reis Map, which is a ge nuine document, not a hoax of any kind, was made at Constantinople in AD 1513. 3 2 It focuses on the western coast of Africa, the eastern coast of South America and the northern coast of Antarctica. 3 Piri Reis could not have acquired hi s information on this latter region from contemporary explorers because Antarctica remained undiscovered until AD 1818, 4 more than 300 years after he drew the map. 4 The ice-free coast of Queen Maud Land shown in the map is a colossal puzzle because the geological evidence confirms that the latest date it could have been surveyed and charted in an ice-free condition is 4000 BC . 5 5 It is not possible to pinpoint the earliest date that such a task could have been accomplished, but it seems that the Queen Maud Land littoral may have remained in a st able, unglaciated condition for at least 9000 years before the spreading ice-cap swallowed it entirely. 6  2 Ibid., pp. 93-98, 235. The period lasted from about 13000 BC to 4000 BC according, for example, to the findings of Dr Jack Hough of Illinois University, supported by experts at the Carnegie Institution, Washington DC. John G. Weiphaupt, a University of Colorado specialist in seismology and gravity and planetary geology, is another who supports the view of a relatively late ice-free period in at least parts of Antarctica. Together with a number of other geologists, he places that period in a narrower band than Hough et al.—from 7000 BC to 4000 BC . 3 Ibid., preface, pp. 1, 209-211. 4 Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1991, I:440. 5 Maps of The Ancient Sea Kings, p. 235. 6 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 15 6 There is no civilization known to history that had the capacity or need to survey that coastline in th e relevant period: between 13,000 BC and 4000 BC . 7 In other words, the true enigma of this 1513 map is not so much its inclusion of a continent not discovered until 1818 but its portrayal of part of the coastline of that continent under ice-free conditions which came to an end 6000 years ago and ha ve not since recurred. How can this be explained? Piri Reis obligingly gives us the answer in a series of notes written in his own hand on the map itself. He tells us that he was not responsible for the original surveying and cartography. On the contrary, he admits that his role wa s merely that of compiler and copyist and that the map was derived from a large number of source maps. 8 Some of these had been drawn by contemporary or near-contemporary explorers (including Christopher Columbus), who had by then reached South America and the Caribbean, bu t others were documents dating back to the fourth century BC or earlier. 9 Piri Reis did not venture any suggestion as to the identity of the cartographers who had produced the earlier maps. In 1963, however, Professor Hapgood proposed a novel and thought-provoking solution to the problem. He argued that some of the source maps the admiral had made use of, in particular those said to date back to the fourth century BC , had themselves been based on even older sources, which in turn had been based on sources originating in th e furthest antiquity. There was, he asserted, irrefutable evidence that the earth had been comprehensively mapped before 4000 BC by a hitherto unknown and undiscovered civilization which had achieved a high level of technological advancement: 10 It appears [he concluded] that accurate information has been passed down from people to people. It appears that the charts must have originated with a people unknown and they were passed on, perhaps by the Minoans and the Phoenicians, who were, for a thousand years and more, the greatest sailors of the ancient world. We have evidence that they were collected and studied in the great library of Alexandria [Egypt] and that compilations of them were made by the geographers who worked there. 11   7 Historians recognize no ‘civiliz ations’ as such prior to 4000 BC . 8 Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings, pp. 220-4. 9 Ibid., p. 222. 10 Ibid., p. 193 11 Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings (revised edition), Turnstone Books, London, 1979, preface."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 16 Piri Reis map (original) "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 17 Redrawing to show detail "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 18 The US Airforce map shows the probable projection that governed the layout of the ancient Piri Reis map. From Alexandria, according to Hapgood’s reconstruction, copies of these compilations and of some of the origin al source maps were transferred to other centres of learning—notably Constantinople. Finally, when Constantinople was seized by the Venetians during the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the maps began to find their way into the hands of European sailors and adventurers: Most of these maps were of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. But maps of other areas survived. These included maps of the Americas and maps of the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. It becomes clear that the ancient voyagers travelled from pole to pole. Unbelievable as it may appear, the evidence nevertheless indicates that some ancient people explored Antarctica when its coasts were free of ice. It is clear, too, that they had an instrument of navigation for accurately determining longitudes that was far superior to anything possessed by the peoples of ancient, medieval or modern times until the second half of the eighteenth century. This evidence of a lost technology will support and give credence to many of the other hypotheses that have been brought forward of a lost civilization in remote times. Scholars have been able to dismiss most of that evidence as mere myth, but here we have evidence that cannot be dismissed. The evidence requires that all the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 19 other evidence that has been brought forward in the past should be re-examined with an open mind. 12 Despite a ringing endorsement from Albert Einstein (see below), and despite the later admission of John Wright, president of the American Geographical Society, that Hapgood ha d ‘posed hypotheses that cry aloud for further testing’, no further sc ientific research has ever been undertaken into these anomalous ea rly maps. Moreover, far from being applauded for making a serious new co ntribution to the debate about the antiquity of human civilization, Hapgood until his death was cold- shouldered by the majority of his pr ofessional peers, who couched their discussion of his work in what has accurately been described as ‘thick and unwarranted sarcasm, selecting trivia and factors not subject to verification as the bases for condemnation, seeking in this way to avoid the basic issues’. 13 A man ahead of his time The late Charles Hapgood taught the history of science at Keene College, New Hampshire, USA. He wasn’t a geologist, or an ancient historian. It is possible, however, that future genera tions will remember him as the man whose work undermined the foundatio ns of world history—and a large chunk of world geology as well. Albert Einstein was among the first to realize this when he took the unprecedented step of contributing the foreword to a book Hapgood wrote in 1953, some years before he began his investigation of the Piri Reis Map: I frequently receive communications from people who wish to consult me concerning their unpublished ideas [Einstein observed]. It goes without saying that these ideas are very seldom possessed of scientific validity. The very first communication, however, that I received from Mr. Hapgood electrified me. His idea is original, of great simplicity, and— if it continues to prove itself—of great importance to everything that is related to the history of the earth’s surface. 14 The ‘idea’ expressed in Hapgood’s 1953 book is a global geological theory which elegantly explains how and why large parts of Antarctica could have remained ice-free until 4000 BC , together with many other anomalies of earth science. In brief the argument is: 1 Antarctica was not always covered with ice and was at one time much warmer than it is today.  12 Ibid. 13 Ibid., foreword. See also F. N. Ea rll, foreword to C. H.

Instead it was approximately 2000 miles farther north. This ‘would have put it outside the Antarctic Circle in a temperate or cold temperate climate’. 15 3 The continent moved to its present position inside the Antarctic Circle as a result of a mechanism known as ‘earth-crust displacement’. This mechanism, in no sense to be confused with plate-tectonics or ‘continental drift’, is one whereby the lithosphere, the whole outer crust of the earth, ‘may be displace d at times, moving over the soft inner body, much as the skin of an or ange, if it were loose, might shift over the inner part of the orange all in one piece’. 16 4 During the envisaged southwards movement of Antarctica brought about by earth-crust displacement, the continent would gradually have grown colder, an ice-cap forming and remorselessly expanding over several thousands of years until it attained its present dimensions.’ 17 Further details of the evidence su pporting these radical proposals are set out in Part VIII of this book. Orthodox geologists, however, remain reluctant to accept Hapgood’s theory (although none has succeeded in proving it incorrect). It raises many questions. Of these by far the most importan t is: what conceivable mechanism would be able to exert sufficient thrust on the lithosphere to precipitate a phenomenon of such magnitude as a crustal displacement? We have no better guide than Einstein to summarize Hapgood’s findings: In a polar region there is continual deposition of ice, which is not symmetrically distributed about the pole. The earth’s ro tation acts on these unsymmetrically deposited masses, and produces centrifugal momentum that is transmitted to the rigid crust of the earth. The constantly increasing centrifugal momentum produced in this way will, when it has reached a certain point, produce a movement of the earth’s crust over the rest of the earth’s body ...” 18 The Piri Reis Map seems to contain surprising collateral evidence in support of the thesis of a geologically recent glaciation of parts of Antarctica following a sudden sout hward displacement of the earth’s crust. Moreover since such a ma p could only have been drawn prior to 4000 BC , its implications for the hist ory of human civilization are staggering. Prior to 4000 BC there are supposed to have been no civilizations at all. At some risk of over-simplification, the academic consensus is broadly: • Civilization first developed in the Fe rtile Crescent of the Middle East.  15 Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings, 1966 ed., p. 189. 16 Ibid., p. 187. 17 Ibid., p. 189. 18 Einstein's foreword to Earth's Shifting Crust , p. 1"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 21 • This development began after 4000 BC , and culminated in the emergence of the earliest true civilizations (Sumer and Egypt) around 3000 BC , soon followed by the Indus Valley and China. • About 1500 years later, civilizat ion took off spontaneously and independently in the Americas. • Since 3000 BC in the Old World (and about 1500 BC in the New) civilization has steadily ‘evolved’ in the direction of ever more refined, complex and productive forms. • In consequence, and particularly by comparison with ourselves, all ancient civilizations (and all their works) are to be understood as essentially primitive (the Sumerian astronomers regarded the heavens with unscientific awe, and even th e pyramids of Egypt were built by ‘technological primitives’). The evidence of the Piri Reis Ma p appears to contradict all this. Piri Reis and his sources In his day, Piri Reis was a well-known figure; his historical identity is firmly established. An admiral in th e navy of the Ottoman Turks, he was involved, often on the winning side, in numerous sea ba ttles around the mid-sixteenth century. He was, in a ddition, considered an expert on the lands of the Mediterranean, and was the author of a famous sailing book, the Kitabi Bahriye, which provided a comprehensive description of the coasts, harbours, currents, shallows, landing places, bays and straits of the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas. Despite this illustrious career he fell foul of his masters and was beheaded in AD 1554 or 1555. 19 The source maps Piri Reis used to draw up his 1513 map were in all probability lodged originally in the Im perial Library at Constantinople, to which the admiral is known to have enjoyed privileged access. Those sources (which may have been transferred or copied from even more ancient centres of learning) no longer exist, or, at any rate, have not been found. It was, however, in the library of the old Imperial Palace at Constantinople that the Piri Reis Map was rediscovered, painted on a gazelle skin and rolled up on a dusty shelf, as recently as 1929. 20 Legacy of a lost civilization? As the baffled Ohlmeyer admitted in his letter to Hapgood in 1960, the Piri Reis Map depicts the subglacial topography, the true profile of Queen Maud Land Antarctica beneath the ice.

At the most one might say, ‘Perhaps it is significant but, then again, perhaps it is just a coincide nce.’ However, the Turkish admiral was by no means alone in the posse ssion of seemingly impossible and inexplicable geographical knowledge. It would be futile to speculate further than Hapgood has already done as to what ‘underground stream’ could have carried and preserved such knowledge through the ages, transmitting fragments of it from culture to culture and from epoch to epoch. Whatever the mechanism, the fact is that a number of other cartographers seem to have been privy to the same curious secrets.

For several consecutive weeks he worked there, lost in the search, surrounded by literally hundreds of medieval maps and charts. I found [he reported] many fascinating th ings I had not expected to find, and a number of charts showing the southern continent. Then, one day, I turned a page and sat transfixed. As my eyes fell upon the southern hemisphere of a world map drawn by Oronteus Finaeus in 1531, I had the instant conviction that I had found here a truly authentic map of the real Antarctica. The general shape of the continent was startlingly like the outline of the continent on our modern maps. The position of the South Pole, nearly in the center of the continent, seemed about right. The mountain ranges that skirted the coasts suggested the numerous ranges that have been discovered in Antarctica in recent years. It was obvious, too, that this was no slapdash creation of somebody’s imagination. The mountain ranges were individualized, some definitely coastal and some not. From most of them rivers were shown flowing into the sea, following in every case what looked like very natural and very convincing drainage patterns. This suggested, of course, that the coasts may have been ice-free when the original map was drawn. The deep interi or, however, was free entirely of rivers and mountains, suggesting that the ice might have been present there. 1 Closer investigation of the Oronteus Finaeus Map by Hapgood, and by Dr Richard Strachan of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, confirmed the following: 1 It had been copied and compiled from several earlier source maps drawn up according to a number of different projections. 2 2 It did indeed show non-glacial co nditions in coastal regions of Antarctica, notably Queen Maud Land, Enderby Land, Wilkes Land, Victoria Land (the east coast of the Ross Sea), and Marie Byrd Land. 3 3 As in the case of the Piri Reis Map, the general profile of the terrain, and the visible physical features, matched closely seismic survey maps of the subglacial land surfaces of Antarctica. 4 The Oronteus Finaeus Map, Hapgood concluded, appeared to document ‘the surprising proposition that Antarctica was visited and perhaps  1 Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings (henceforth Maps), p. 79. 2 Ibid., p. 233. 3 Ibid., p. 89. 4 Ibid., p. 90.

Ross Sea Further evidence in support of this view arises from the manner in which the Ross Sea was shown by Oronteus Fi naeus. Where today great glaciers like the Beardmore and the Scott disg orge themselves into the sea, the 1531 map shows estuaries, broad inle ts and indications of rivers. The unmistakable implication of these features is that there was no ice on the Ross Sea or its coasts when the source maps used by Oronteus Finaeus were made: ‘There also had to be a co nsiderable hinterland free of ice to feed the rivers. At the present time all these coasts and their hinterlands are deeply buried in the mile-thick ice-cap, while on the Ross Sea itself there is a floating ice-shelf hundreds of feet thick.’ 6 The Ross Sea evidence provides strong corroboration for the notion that Antarctica must have been mapped by some unknown civilization during the extensively ice-free period which ended around 4000 BC .

The most surprisi ng discovery, however, ‘was that a number of the layers were formed of fine-grained, well-assorted sediments, such as are brought down to the sea by rivers flowing from temperate (that is, ice-free) lands ...’ 7 Using the ionium-dating method deve loped by Dr W.

Is it safe, or reasonable, for example, for us to continue to ignore the historical implications of some of the maps made by the sixteenth- century’s most famous cartographer: Gerard Kremer, otherwise known as Mercator? Best remembered for the Mercator projection, still used on most world maps today, this enig matic individual (who paid an unexplained visit to the Great Pyramid of Egypt in 1563 10 ) was reportedly ‘indefatigable in searching out ... th e learning of long ago’, and spent many years diligently accumulating a vast and eclectic reference library of ancient source maps. 11 Significantly, Mercator included the Oronteus Finaeus map in his Atlas of 1569 and also depicted the Antarctic on several he himself drew in the same year. Identifiable parts of the then undiscovered southern continent on these maps are Cape Dart and Cape Herlacher in Marie Byrd Land, the Amundsen Sea, Thurston Island in Ellsworth Land, the Fletcher Islands in the Bellinghausen Sea, Alexander I Island, the Antarctic (Palmer) Peninsula, the Weddell Sea, Cape No rvegia, the Regula Range in Queen Maud Land (as islands), the Muhlig-H offman Mountains (as islands), the Prince Harald Coast, the Shirase Glac ier as an estuary on Prince Harald Coast, Padda Island in Lutzow-Holm Bay, and the Prince Olaf Coast in Enderby Land. ‘In some cases these features are more distinctly recognisable than on the Oronteus Finaeus Map,’ observed Hapgood, ‘and it seems clear, in general, that Mercator had at his disposal source  10 He left his graffito there.

Philippe Buache, the eighteenth-century French geographer, was also able to publish a map of Antarctica long before the southern continent was officially ‘discovered’. And the ex traordinary feature of Buache’s map is that it seems to have been based on source maps made earlier, perhaps thousands of years earlier, than those used by Oronteus Finaeus and Mercator. What Buache gives us is an eerily precise representation of Antarctica as it must have looked when there was no ice on it at all . 13 His map reveals the subglacial topography of the entire continent, which even we did not have full knowledge of until 1958, International Geophysical Year, when a comprehensive seismic survey was carried out. That survey only confirmed what Buache had already proclaimed when he published his map of Antarctica in 1737. Basing his cartography on ancient sources now lost, the French academician depicted a clear waterway across the southern continent dividing it into two principal landmasses lying east and west of the line now marked by the Trans- Antarctic Mountains. Such a waterway, connecting the Ross, Weddell and Bellinghausen Seas, would indeed exist if Antarctica were free of ice. As the 1958 IGY Survey shows, the continent (which appears on modern maps as one continuous landmass) consists of an archipelago of large islands with mile-thick ice packed between them and rising above sea level. The epoch of the map-makers As we have seen, many orthodox geologists believe that the last time any waterway existed in these ice-filled basins was millions of years ago. From the scholarly point of view, howeve r, it is equally orthodox to affirm that no human beings had evolved in those remote times, let alone human beings capable of accurately mapping the landmasses of the Antarctic. The big problem raised by the Buache/IGY evidence is that those landmasses do seem to have been mapped when they were free of ice.

South America Were other parts of the world surveyed and accurately charted at widely separated intervals during this same epoch; roughly from 13,000 BC to 4000 BC ? The answer may lie once again in the Piri Reis Map, which contains more mysteries than just Antarctica: • Drawn in 1513, the map demonstrates an uncanny knowledge of South America—and not only of its easter n coast but of the Andes mountains on the western side of the continent, which were of course unknown at that time. The map correctly shows the Amazon River rising in these unexplored mountains and thence flowing eastwards. 15 • Itself compiled from more than twenty different source documents of varying antiquity, 16 the Piri Reis Map depicts the Amazon not once but twice (most probably as a result of the unintentional overlapping of two of the source documents used by the Turkish admiral 17 ). In the first of these the Amazon’s course is sh own down to its Para River mouth, but the important island of Marajo does not appear. According to Hapgood, this suggests that the rele vant source map must have dated from a time, perhaps as much as 15,000 years ago, when the Para River was the main or only mouth of the Amazon and when Marajo Island was part of the mainland on the northern side of the river. 18 The second depiction of the Amazon, on the other hand, does show Marajo (and in fantastically accurate detail) despite the fact that this island was not discovered until 1543. 19 Again, the possibility is raised of an unknown civilization which undert ook continuous surveying and mapping operations of the changing face of the earth over a period of many thousands of years, with Piri Reis making use of earlier and later source maps left behind by this civilization. • Neither the Orinoco River nor its present delta is represented on the Piri Reis Map. Instead, as Hapgood proved, ‘two estuaries extending far inland (for a distance of about 100 miles) are shown close to the site of the present river. The longitude on the grid would be correct for the  15 Maps, p. 68. 16 Ibid., p. 222. 17 Ibid., pp. 64-5. 18 Ibid., p. 64. 19 Ibid., p. 65."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 32 Orinoco, and the latitude is also quit e accurate. Is it possible that these estuaries have been filled in, and the delta extended this much, since the source maps were made?’ 20 • Although they remained undiscovered until 1592, the Falkland Islands appear on the 1513 map at their correct latitude. 21 • The library of ancient sources incorp orated in the Piri Reis Map may also account for the fact that it conv incingly portrays a large island in the Atlantic Ocean to the east of the South American coast where no such island now exists. Is it pure coincidence that this ‘imaginary’ island turns out to be located right over the sub-oceanic Mid-Atlantic Ridge just north of the equator an d 700 miles east of the coast of Brazil, where the tiny Rocks of Sts. Peter and Paul now jut above the waves? 22 Or was the relevant source ma p drawn deep in the last Ice Age, when sea levels were far lower than they are today and a large island could indeed have been exposed at this spot? Sea levels and ice ages Other sixteenth-century maps also look as though they could have been based on accurate world surveys cond ucted during the last Ice Age. One was compiled by the Turk Hadji Ah med in 1559, a cartographer, as Hapgood puts it, who must have had access to some ‘most extraordinary’ source maps. 23 The strangest and most immediately striking feature of Hadji Ahmed’s compilation is that it shows quite plainly a strip of territory, almost 1000 miles wide, connecting Alaska and Siberia. Such a ‘land-bridge’, as geologists refer to it, did once exist (where the Bering St rait is now) but was submerged beneath the waves by ri sing sea levels at the end of the last Ice Age. 24 The rising sea levels were caused by the tumultuous melting of the ice- cap which was rapidly retreating ever ywhere in the northern hemisphere by around 10,000 BC . 25 It is therefore interestin g that at least one ancient map appears to show southern Sweden covered with remnant glaciers of the kind that must indeed have been prevalent then in these latitudes. The remnant glaciers are on Claudius Ptolemy’s famous Map of the North. Originally compiled in the second century AD , this remarkable work from the last great geographer of classica l antiquity was lost for hundreds of  20 Ibid., p. 69. 21 Ibid., p. 72. 22 Ibid., p. 65. 23 Ibid., p. 99. 24 Ibid. 25 Ibid., p. 164."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 33 years and rediscovered in the fifteenth century. 26 Ptolemy was custodian of the library at Alexandria, which contained the greatest manuscript collection of ancient times, 27 and it was there that he consulted the archaic source document s that enabled him to compile his own map. 28 Acceptance of the possibility that the original version of at least one of the charts he referred to could have been made around 10,000 BC helps us to explain why he shows glaciers, characteristic of that exact epoch, togeth er with ‘lakes ... sugg esting the shapes of present-day lakes, and streams very much suggesting glacial streams ... flowing from the glaciers into the lakes.’ 29 It is probably unnecessary to add th at no one on earth in Roman times, when Ptolemy drew his map, had the slightest suspicion that ice ages could once have existed in northe rn Europe. Nor did anyone in the fifteenth century (when the map was rediscovered) possess such knowledge. Indeed, it is impossible to see how the remnant glaciers and other features shown on Ptolemy’ s map could have been surveyed, imagined or invented by any know n civilization prior to our own. The implications of this are obvious. So, too, are the implications of another map, the ‘Portolano’ of Iehu di Ibn Ben Zara, drawn in the year 1487. 30 This chart of Europe and North Africa may have been based on a source even earlier than Ptolemy’s, for it seems to sh ow glaciers much farther south than Sweden (roughly on the same latitude as England in fact) 31 and to depict the Mediterranean, Adriatic and Aegean Seas as they might have looked before the melting of the European ice-cap. 32 Sea level would, of course, have been significantly lower than it is today. It is therefore interesting, in the case for instance of the Aegean section of the map, to note that a great many more islands are shown than currently exist. 33 At first sight this seems odd.

Interestingly enough, this same map is considerably less accurate in its portrayal of another region, the west coast of South America, than an earlier (1538) map also drawn by Mercator. 1 The reason for this appears to be that the sixteenth-century geographer based the earlier map on the ancient sources which we know he had at his disposal, whereas for the later ma p he relied upon the observations and measurements of the first Spanish explorers of western South America. Since those explorers ha d supposedly brought the latest information back to Europe, Mercator can hardly be blamed for following them. In so doing the accuracy of his work declined: instruments capable of finding longitude did not exist in 1569, but appear to have been used to prepare the ancient source documents Mercator consulted to produce his 1538 map. 2 The mysteries of longitude Let us consider the problem of long itude, defined as the distance in degrees east or west of the prime meridian. The current internationally accepted prime meridian is an imaginary curve drawn from the North Pole to the South Pole passing through th e Royal Observatory at Greenwich, London.

What we are concer ned with here, howe ver, is not so much technical detail as the accepted historical facts about humanity’s growing knowledge of the mysteries of longitude. Among these facts, this is the most important: until a breakthrough invention in the eighteenth century, cartographers and navigators were unable to fix longitude with any kind of precision. They could only make guesses which were usually inaccurate by many hundreds of mi les, because the technology had not yet been developed to allow them to do the job properly. Latitude north or south of the equator did not pose such a problem: it could be worked out by means of angular measurements of the sun and stars taken with relatively simple instruments. But to find longitude equipment of an altogether different and superior calibre was needed, which could combine position measurements with time measurements. Throughout the span of known histor y the invention of such equipment had remained beyond the capacities of scientists, but by the beginning of the eighteenth century, with rapidly increasing sea traffic, a mood of impatience and urgency had set in. In the words of an authority on the period, ‘The search for longitude ov ershadowed the life of every man afloat, and the safety of every ship and cargo. Accurate measurement seemed an impossible dream and “discovering the longitude” had become a stock phrase in the press like “pigs might fly”.’ 3  3 Simon Bethon and Andrew Robinson, The Shape of the World: The Mapping and Discovery of the Earth, Guild Publishing, London, 1991, p. 117."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 37 What was needed, above all else, was an instrument that would keep the time (at the place of departure) with perfect accuracy during long sea journeys despite the motion of the ship and despite the adverse conditions of alternating heat and co ld, wet and dry. ‘Such a Watch’, as Isaac Newton told the members of the British government’s official Board of Longitude in 1714, ‘hath not yet been made’. 4 Indeed not. The timepieces of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries were crude devices which typi cally lost or gained as much as a quarter of an hour per day. By contrast, an effective marine chronometer could afford to lose or gain th at much only over several years. 5 It was not until the 1720s that the talented English clockmaker John Harrison began work on the first of a series of designs which resulted in the manufacture of such a chronometer. His objective was to win the prize of £20,000 offered by the Board of Longitude ‘for the inventor of any means of determining a ship’s long itude within 30 nautical miles at the end of a six weeks’ voyage’. 6 A chronometer capable of fulfilling this condition would have to keep time to within three seconds per day. It took almost forty years, during whic h several prototypes were completed and tested, before Harrison was able to meet these standards. Finally, in 1761, his elegant Chronometer No . 4 left Britain on board HMS Deptford bound for Jamaica, accompanied by Harrison’s son Will iam. Nine days into the voyage, on the basis of long itude calculations made possible by the chronometer, William advised the captain that they would sight the Madeira Islands the following morning. The captain offered five to one that he was wrong but agreed to hold the course. William won the bet. Two months later, at Jamaica, the instrument was found to have lost just five seconds. 7 Harrison had surpassed the conditions set by the Board of Longitude. Thanks to the British government’s bu reaucratic dithering, however, he was not awarded the £20,000 prize money until three years before his death in 1776. Understandably, it was only when he had the funds in his hands that he divulged the secrets of his design. As a result of this delay, Captain James Cook did not have the benefit of a chronometer when he made his first voyage of discovery in 1768. 8 By the time of his third voyage, however (1778-9), he was able to map the Pacific with impressive accuracy, fixing not only the correct latitude but the correct longitude of every island and coastline. 9 Henceforward, ‘thanks to Cook’s care and Harrison’s chronometer ... no navigator could have an excuse for failing to find a Pacific island ... or for be ing wrecked on a co astline appearing  4 Ibid., p. 121. 5 Ibid., p. 120. 6 Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1991, 3:289. 7 Shape of the World, pp. 123-4. 8 Ibid., p. 125. 9 Ibid., p. 131."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 38 from nowhere.’ 10 Indeed, with their accurate longitud es, Cook’s Pacific maps must be ranked among the very first examples of the precise cartography of our modern era. They remind us, moreover, that the making of really good maps requires at least three key ingred ients: great journeys of discovery; first-class mathematical and cartographic skills; sophisticated chronometers. It was not until Harrison’s chronome ter became generally available in the 1770s that the third of these preconditions was fulfilled. This brilliant invention made it possible for cartog raphers to fix longitude precisely, something that the Sumerians, the Ancient Egyptians, the Greeks and the Romans, and indeed all other known ci vilizations before the eighteenth century were supposedly unable to do. It is therefore surprising and unsettling to come across vastly older maps which give latitudes and longitudes with modern precision. Precision instruments These inexplicably precise latitudes an d longitudes are found in the same general category of documents that contain the advanced geographical knowledge I have outlined. The Piri Reis Map of 1513, for example, places South America and Africa in the correct relative longitudes , 11 theoretically an impossible feat for the science of the time. But Piri Reis was candid in admitting that his map was based on far earlier sources. Could it have b een from one of these sources that he derive d his accurate longitudes? Also of great interest is the so-called ‘Dulcert Portulano’ of AD 1339 which focuses on Europe and North Afri ca. Here latitude is perfect across huge distances and the total longitude of the Mediterranean and Black Seas is correct to within half a degree. 12 Professor Hapgood comments that the maker of the original source from which the Dulcert Portulano was copied had ‘achieved highly scientific accuracy in finding the ratio of latitude to longitude. He could only have done this if he had precise information on the relative longitudes of a great many places sc attered all the way from Galway in Ireland to the eastern bend of the Don in Russia.’ 13 The Zeno Map 14 of AD 1380 is another enigma. Co vering a vast area of the north as far as Greenland, it locates a great many widely scattered places at latitudes and longitudes which are ‘amazingly correct’. 15 It is  10 Ibid. 11 Maps, pp. 1, 41. 12 Ibid., p. 116. 13 Ibid. 14 Ibid., pp. 149-58. 15 Ibid, p. 152."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 39 ‘unbelievable’, asserts Hapgood, ‘that anyone in the fourteenth century could have found accurate latitudes for these places, to say nothing of accurate longitudes’. 16 The Oronteus Finaeus World Map also commands attention: it successfully places the coasts of Antarctica in correct latitudes and relative longitudes and finds a remark ably accurate area for the continent as a whole. This reflects a level of geographical knowledge not available until the twentieth century. 17 The Portolano of lehudi Ibn Ben Za ra is another map notable for its accuracy where relative latitudes and longitudes are concerned. 18 Total longitude between Gibraltar and the Se a of Azov is accurate to half a degree, while across the map as a whole average errors of longitude are less than a degree. 19 These examples represent only a small fraction of the large and challenging dossier of evidence presen ted by Hapgood. Layer upon layer, the cumulative effect of his painst aking and detailed analysis is to suggest that we are deluding oursel ves when we suppose that accurate instruments for measuring longitud e were not invented until the eighteenth century. On the contrary, the Piri Reis and other maps appear to indicate very strongly that such instruments were re-discovered then, that they had existed long ages befo re and had been used by a civilized people, now lost to history, who ha d explored and charted the entire earth. Furthermore, it seems that these people were capable not only of designing and manufacturing prec ise and technically advanced mechanical instruments but were masters of a precocious mathematical science. The lost mathematicians To understand why, we should first remind ourselves of the obvious: the earth is a sphere. When it comes to mapping it, therefore, only a globe can represent it in correct proportion. Transferring cartographic data from a globe to flat sheets of paper inevitably involves distortions and can be accomplished only by mean s of an artificial and complex mechanical and mathematical device known as map projection. There are many different kinds of projection. Mercator’s, still used in atlases today, is perhaps the most familiar. Others are dauntingly referred to as Azimuthal, Ster eographic, Gnomonic, Azimuthal Equidistant, Cordiform, and so on, but it is unnecessary to go into this any further here.

Charles Hapgood submitted his coll ection of ancient maps to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for evaluation by Professor Richard Strachan. The general conclusion was obvious, but he wanted to know precisely what level of mathematics would have been required to draw up the original source documents. On 18 April 1965 Strachan replied that a very high level of mathematics indeed would have been necessary. Some of the maps, for example, seemed to express ‘a Mercator type projection’ long before the time of Mercator himself. The relative complexity of this projection (involving latitude expansion) meant that a trigonometric coordinate transformation method must have been used. Other reasons for deducing that the ancient map-makers must have been skilled mathematicians were as follows: 1 The determination of place locations on a continent requires at least geometric triangulation methods. Over large distance s (of the order of 1000 miles) corrections must be made for the curvature of the earth, which requires some understanding of spherical trigonometry. 2 The location of continents with respect to one another requires an understanding of the earth’s sphericity, and the use of spherical trigonometry. 3 Cultures with this knowledge, plus the pr ecision instruments to make the required measurements to determine location, would most certainly use their mathematical technology in creating maps and charts.’ 21 Strachan’s impression that the maps, through generations of copyists, revealed the handiwork of an ancien t, mysterious and technologically advanced civilization, was shared by reconnaissance experts from the US Airforce to whom Hapgood submitte d the evidence. Lorenzo Burroughs, chief of the 8th Reconnaissance Te chnical Squadron’s Cartographic Section at Westover Air Base, made a particularly close study of the Oronteus Finaeus Map. He concluded that some of the sources upon which it was based must have been drawn up by means of a projection similar to the modern Cordiform Projection. This, said Burroughs: suggests the use of advanced mathematics. Further, the shape given to the Antarctic Continent suggests the possibility, if not the probability, that the original source maps were compiled on a stereographic or gnomonic type of projection involving the use of spherical trigonometry.

It has a similar grid and was drawn up with the benefit of spherical trigonometry. Ind eed, on close examination, it shares so many features with the European and Middle Eastern maps that only one explanation seems adequate: it and they must have stemmed from a common source . 24 We seem to be confronted once ag ain by a surviving fragment of the scientific knowledge of a lost civilization. More than that, it appears that this civilization must have been at least in some respects as advanced as our own and that its cartographers ha d ‘mapped virtually the entire globe with a uniform general level of tec hnology, with similar methods, equal knowledge of mathematics, and probably the same sorts of instruments’. 25 The Chinese map also indi cates something else: a global legacy must have been handed down—a legacy of inestimable value, in all probability incorporating much more than soph isticated geographical knowledge. Could it have been some portion of this legacy that was distributed in prehistoric Peru by the so-called ‘Viracochas’, mysterious bearded strangers said to have come from across the seas, in a ‘time of darkness’, to restore civilization after a great upheaval of the earth?

It’s true that high winds do blow here, but by a happy accident of physics they are robbed of their sting at ground level: the pebbles that litter the pampa absorb and retain the sun’s heat, throwing up a protective force-field of warm air. In addition, the soil contains enough gypsum to glue small stones to the subsurface, an adhesive regularly renewed by the moistening effect of early morning dews. Once things are drawn here, therefore, they tend to stay drawn. There’s hardly any rain; indeed, with less than half an hour of miserly drizzle every decade, Nazca is among the driest places on earth. If you are an artist, therefore, if you have something grand and important to express, and if you want it to be visible for ever, these strange and lonely flatlands could look like the answer to your prayers. Experts have pronounced upon the antiquity of Nazca, basing their opinions on fragments of pottery found embedded in the lines and on radiocarbon results from various organic remains unearthed here. The dates conjectured range between 350 BC and AD 600. 2 Realistically, they tell us nothing about the age of the lines themselves, which are inherently as undatable as the stones cleared to make them. All we can say for sure is that the most recent are at least 1400 years old, but it is theoretically possible that they could be far more ancient than that—for the simple reason that the artefact s from which such dates are derived could have been brought to Nazca by later peoples.  2 Pathways to the Gods, p. 21."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 45 The principal figures of the Nazca plateau. The majority of the designs are spread out across a clearly defined area of southern Peru bounded by the Ri o Ingenio to the north and the Rio Nazca to the south, a roughly square canvas of dun-coloured desert with forty-six kilometres of the Pan-Am erican highway running obliquely through it from top-centre to bottom right. Here, scattered apparently at random, are literally hundreds of different figures. Some depict animals and birds (a total of eighteen different birds). But far more take the form of geometrical devices in the form of trapezoids, rectangles, triangles and straight lines. Viewed from above, these latter resemble to the modern eye a jumble of runways, as though some megalomaniac civil engineer had been licensed to act out his most flamboyant fantasies of airfield design. It therefore comes as no surprise , since humans are not supposed to have been able to fly until the beginning of the twentieth century, that the Nazca lines have been identified by a number of observers as landing strips for alien spaceships. This is a seductive notion, but Nazca is perhaps not the best place to seek evidence for it. For example, it is difficult to understand why extra-terrestrials advanced enough to have crossed hundreds of light years of in terstellar space should have needed"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 46 landing strips at all. Surely such beings would have mastered the technology of setting their flying saucers down vertically? Besides, there is really no question of the Nazca lines ever having been used as runways—by flying saucers or anything else—although some of them look like that from above. Viewed at ground-level they are little more than grazes on the surface made by scraping away thousands of tons of black volcanic pebbles to expo se the desert’s paler base of yellow sand and clay. None of the cleared ar eas is more than a few inches deep and all are much too soft to have pe rmitted the landing of wheeled flying vehicles. The German mathematician Maria Reiche, who devoted half a century to the study of the lines, was only being logical when she dismissed the extraterrestrial theory with a single pithy sentence a few years ago: ‘I’m afraid the spac emen would have gotten stuck.’ If not runways for the chariots of alien ‘gods’, therefore, what else might the Nazca lines be? The truth is that no one knows their purpose, just as no one really knows their age; they are a genuine mystery of the past. And the closer you look at them the more baffling they become. It’s clear, for example, that the animals and birds antedate the geometry of the ‘runways’, because many of the trapezoids, rectangles and straight lines bisect (and thus partly obliterate) the more complex figures. The obvious deduction is that the final artwork of the desert as we view it today must have been produced in two phases. Moreover, though it seems contrary to the normal laws of technical progress, we must concede that the earlier of the two phases was the more advanced. The execution of the zoomorphic figures called for far higher levels of skill and technology than the etching of the straight lines. But how widely separated in time were the earlier and later artists? Scholars do not address themselves to this question. Instead they lump both cultures together as ‘the Nazcans’ and depict them as primitive tribesmen who unaccountably developed sophisticated techniques of artistic self-expression, and then vani shed from the Peruvian scene, many hundreds of years before the appearance of their better-known successors, the Incas. How sophisticated were these Nazcan ‘primitives’? What kind of knowledge must they have possessed to inscribe their gigantic signatures on the plateau? It seems, for a start, that they were pretty good observational astronomers—at least according to Dr Phillis Pitluga, an astronomer with the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. After making an intensive computer-aided study of st ellar alignments at Nazca, she has concluded that the famous spider figure was devised as a terrestrial diagram of the giant constellation of Orion, and that the arrow-straight lines linked to the figure appear to have been set out to track through the ages the changing declinations of the three stars of Orion’s Belt. 3 The real significance of Dr Pitluga’s discovery will become apparent in  3 Personal communications with Dr Pitluga."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 47 due course. Meanwhile, let us note that the Nazca spider also accurately depicts a member of a known spider genus— Ricinulei . 4 This, as it happens, is one of the rarest spider genera in the world, so rare indeed that it has only been found in re mote and inaccessible parts of the Amazon rainforest. 5 How did the supposedly primitive Nazcan artists travel so far from their homeland, crossing the formidable barrier of the Andes, to obtain a specimen? More to the point, why should they have wanted to do such a thing and how were they able to duplicate minute details of Ricinulei’s anatomy normally visible only under a microscope, 6 notably the reproductive organ positi oned on the end of its extended right leg? Such mysteries multiply at Nazca and none of the designs, except perhaps the condor, really seems quite at home here. The whale and the monkey are, after all, as out of plac e in this desert environment as the Amazonian spider. A curious figure of a man, his right arm raised as though in greeting, heavy boots on his feet and round eyes staring owlishly forward, cannot be said to belong to any known era or culture. And other drawings depicting the human form are equally peculiar: their heads enclosed in halos of radiance, they do indeed look like visitors from another planet. Their sheer size is equally noteworthy and bizarre. The hummingbird is 165 feet long, th e spider 150 feet long, the condor stretches nearly 400 feet from beak to tail-feathers (as does the pelican), and a lizard, whose tail is now divide d by the Pan-American highway, is 617 feet in length. Almost every de sign is executed on the same cyclopean scale and in the same difficult manner, by the careful contouring of a single continuous line. Similar attention to detail is to be found in the geometrical devices. Some of these take the form of straight lines more than five miles long, marching like Roman roads across th e desert, dropping into dried-out river beds, surmounting rocky outcrops, and never once deviating from true. This kind of precision is hard, but not impossible, to explain in conventional commonsense terms. More puzzling by far are the zoomorphic figures. How could they have been so perfectly made when, without aircraft, their creators could not have checked the progress of their work by viewing it in its proper perspective? None of the designs is small enough to be seen from ground level, where they appear merely as a series of shapeless ruts in the desert. They show their true form only when seen from an altitude of several hundred feet. There is no elevation nearby that provides such a vantage point.  4 Firm identification of the Nazca spider with Ricinulei was first made by Professor Gerald S. Hawkins. See Gerald S.

Now we’re experimenting with the view from different altitudes. At a couple of hundred feet above the plain Ricinulei, the Amazonian spider , looks like he’s going to rear up and snatch us in his jaws. At 500 feet we can see several of the figures at once: a dog, a tree, a weird pair of hands, the condor, and some of the triangles and trapezoids. When we ascend to 1500 feet, the zoomorphs, hitherto predominant, are revealed merely as small scattered units surrounded by an astonishing scribble of vast geometric forms. These forms now look less like runways an d more like pathways made by giants—pathways that crisscross the plateau in what seems at first a bewildering variety of shapes, angles and sizes. As the ground continues to recede , however, and as the widening perspective on the lines permits more of an eagle’s-eye view, I begin to wonder whether there might not after all be some method to the cuneiform slashes and scratches spread out below me. I am reminded of an observation made by Maria Reiche , the mathematician who has lived at Nazca and studied the lines since 1946. In her view The geometric drawings give the impression of a cipher-script in which the same words are sometimes written in huge letters, at another time in minute characters. There are line arrangements which appear in a great variety of size categories together with very similar shapes. All the drawings are composed of a certain number of basic elements ... 7 As the Cessna bumps and heaves across the heavens, I also remember it is no accident that the Nazca lines we re only properly identified in the twentieth century, after the era of flight had begun. In the late sixteenth century a magistrate named Luis de Monzon was the first Spanish traveller to bring back eyewitness reports concerning these mysterious ‘marks on the desert’ and to collect the strange local traditions that linked them to the Viracochas. 8 However, until commercial airlines began to operate regularly between Lima and Arequipa in the 1930s no one seems to have grasped that the largest piece of graphic art in the world lay here in southern Peru.

Whether expressed in the Pyramid Texts of Ancient Egypt, or the Hebrew Bible, or the Vedas, such traditions are among the most imperishable of all human creations: they are vehicl es of knowledge voyaging through time. The last custodians of the ancient re ligious heritage of Peru were the Incas, whose beliefs and ‘idolatry’ we re ‘extirpated’ and whose treasures were ransacked during the thirty terrible years that followed the Spanish conquest in AD 1532. 1 Providentially, however, a number of early Spanish travellers made sincere efforts to document Inca traditions before they were entirely forgotten. Though little attention was paid at the time, some of these traditions speak strikingly of a great civilization that was believed to have existed in Peru many thousands of years earlier. 2 Powerful memories were preserved of this civilization, said to have been founded by the Viracochas, the same mysterious beings credited with the making of the Nazca lines. ‘Foam of the Sea’ When the Spanish conquistadores arrived, the Inca empire extended along the Pacific coast and Andean high lands of South America from the northern border of modern Ecuador, through the whole of Peru, and as far south as the Maule River in central Chile. Connecting the far-flung corners of this empire was a vast and sophisticated road system: two parallel north-south highways, for example, one running for 3600 kilometres along the coast and the ot her for a similar distance through the Andes. Both these great thoroughfares were paved and connected by frequent links. In addition, they exhi bited an interesting range of design and engineering features such as suspension bridges and tunnels cut through solid rock. They were clearly the work of an evolved, disciplined and ambitious society.

Here, though the Incas worshippe d the sun god, whom they knew as Inti, quite another deity was venerated as the Most Holy of all. This was Viracocha, whose namesakes were said to “have made the Nazca lines and whose own name meant ‘Foam of the Sea.’ 5 No doubt it is just a coincidence th at the Greek goddess Aphrodite, who was born of the sea, received her name because of ‘the foam [ aphros ] out of which she was formed’. 6 Besides, Viracocha was always depicted uncompromisingly as a male by the peoples of the Andes. That much about him is known for cert ain. No historian, however, is able to say how ancient was the cult of this deity before the Spanish arrived to put a stop to it. This is because the cult se emed always to have been around; indeed, long before the Incas incorp orated him into their cosmogony and built a magnificent temple for him at Cuzco, the evidence suggests that the high god Viracocha had been worshipped by all the civilizations that had ever existed in the long history of Peru. Citadel of Viracocha A few days after leaving Nazca, Santha and I arrived in Cuzco and made our way to the site of the Coricancha, the great temple dedicated to Viracocha in the pre-Colombian era. The Coricancha was of course long gone. Or, to be more exact, it was not so much gone as buried beneath layers of later architecture. The Spanish had kept its superb Inca foundations, and the lower parts of it s fabulously strong walls, and had erected their own grandiose colonial cathedral on top. Walking towards the front entrance of this cathedral, I remembered that the Inca temple that had once stood here had been covered with more than 700 sheets of pure gold (each weighing around two kilograms) and that its spacious courtyard had been planted with ‘fields’ of replica corn also fashioned out of gold. 7 I could not help but be reminded of Solomon’s temple in far-off Jerusalem, also reputed to have been adorned  3 Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1991, 6:276-7. 4 Paul Devereux, Secrets of Ancient and Sacred Places, Blandford Books, London, 1992, p. 76.

Its Inca foundations and lower walls survived these natural disasters intact, thanks to their char acteristic design which made use of an elegant system of in terlocking polygonal bloc ks. These blocks, and the general layout of the place, were al most all that was now left of the original structure, apart from an octagonal grey stone platform at the centre of the vast rectangular cour tyard which had once been covered with 55 kilograms of solid gold. 9 On either side of the courtyard were ante-chambers, also from the Inca temple, with refined architectural features such as walls that tapered upwards and beautifully-carved niches hewn out of single pieces of granite. We took a walk through the narrow, cobbled streets of Cuzco. Looking around, I realized it was not just the cathedral that reflected Spanish imposition on top of an earlier cu lture: the whole town was slightly schizophrenic. Spacious, balconied, pastel-shaded colonial homes and palaces towered above me but almost all of them stood on Inca foundations or incorporated comple te Inca structures of the same beautiful polygonal architecture used in the Coricancha. In one alleyway, known as Hatunrumiyoc, I paused to examine an intricate jigsaw puzzle of a wall made of countless drystone blocks all perfectly fitted together, all of different sizes and shapes, inte rlocking in a bewildering array of angles. The carving of the individual blocks, and their arrangement into so complicated a structure could only have been achieved by master craftsmen possessed of very high levels of skill, with untold centuries of architectural experimentation behi nd them.

As we shall see, the records confirmed this was exactly the appearance ascribed to Viracocha by those who worshipped him. Whoever he was, therefore, he could not have been an American Indian: they are relatively dark-skinned people with sparse facial hair. 12 Viracocha’s bushy beard and pale complexion made him sound like a Caucasian. Back in the sixteenth century the Incas had thought so too. Indeed their legends and religious beliefs made them so certain of his physical type that they initially mistook the whit e and bearded Spaniards who arrived on their shores for the returning Viracocha and his demigods, 13 an event long prophesied and whic h Viracocha was said in all the legends to have promised.

And though he was known by many different names in many different places he was always recognizably the same figure: Viracocha, Foam of the Sea, a master of science and magic who wiel ded terrible weapons and who came in a time of chaos to set the world to rights. The same basic story was shared in ma ny variants by all the peoples of the Andean region. It began with a vivid description of a terrifying period when the earth had been inundated by a great flood and plunged into darkness by the disappearance of the sun. Society had fallen into disorder, and the people suffered much hardship. Then there suddenly appeared, coming from the south, a white man of large stature and authoritative demeanour. This man had such great power that he changed the hills into valleys and from the valleys made great hills, causing streams to flow from the living stone ... 1 The early Spanish chronicler who record ed this tradition explained that it had been told to him by the Indi ans he had travelled among on his journeys in the Andes: And they heard it from their fathers, who in their turn had it from the old songs which were handed down from very ancient times ... They say that this man travelled along the highland route to the north, working marvels as he went and that they never saw him again. They say that in many places he gave men instructions how they should live, speaking to them with great love and kindness and admonishing them to be good and to do no damage or injury one to another, but to love one another and show charity to all. In most places they name him Ticci Viracocha ... 2 Other names applied to the same figu re included Huaracocha, Con, Con Ticci or Kon Tiki, Thunupa, Taapac, Tupaca and Illa. 3 He was a scientist, an architect of surpassing skills, a sculptor and an engineer: ‘He caused terraces and fields to be formed on the steep sides of ravines, and sustaining walls to rise up and suppo rt them. He also made irrigating channels to flow ... and he went in various directions, arranging many things.’ 4  1 South American Mythology, p. 74. 2 Ibid. 3 Arthur Cotterell, The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Myths and Legends, Guild Publishing, London, 1989, p. 174.

It was said that ‘wherever he passed, he healed all that were sick and restored sight to the blind.’ 5 This gentle, civilizing, ‘superhuman’ , Samaritan had another side to his nature, however. If his lif e were threatened, as it seems to have been on several occasions, he had the weapon of heavenly fire at his disposal: Working great miracles by his words, he came to the district of the Canas and there, near a village called Cacha ... the people rose up against him and threatened to stone him. They saw him si nk to his knees and raise his hands to heaven as if beseeching aid in the peril which beset him. The Indians declare that thereupon they saw fire in the sky which seemed all around them. Full of fear, they approached him whom they had intended to kill and besought him to forgive them ... Presently they saw that the fire was extinguished at his command, though stones were consumed by fire in such wise that large blocks could be lifted by hand as if they were cork. They narrate further that, leaving the place where this occurred, he came to the coast and there, holding his mantle, he went forth amidst the waves and was seen no more. And as he went they gave him the name Viracocha, which mean s ‘Foam of the Sea’.’ 6 The legends were unanimous in their ph ysical description of Viracocha. In his Suma y Narracion de los Incas, for example, Juan de Betanzos, a sixteenth-century Spanish chronicler, st ated that according to the Indians, he had been ‘a bearded man of tall stature clothed in a white robe which came down to his feet and which he wore belted at the waist’. 7 Other descriptions, collected from ma ny different and widely separated Andean peoples, all seemed to identify the same enigmatic individual. According to one he was: A bearded man of medium height dressed in a rather long cloak ... He was past his prime, with grey hair, and lean. He walked with a staff and addressed the natives with love, calling them his sons and daughters. As he traversed all the land he worked miracles. He healed the sick by touch. He spoke every tongue even better than the natives. They called him Thunupa or Tarpaca, Viracocha-rapacha or Pachaccan ... 8 In one legend Thunupa-Viracocha was said to have been a ‘white man of large stature, whose air and person aroused great respect and veneration’. 9 In another he was described as ‘a white man of august appearance, blue-eyed, bearded, without headgear and wearing a cusma, a jerkin or sleeveless shirt reaching to the knees’. In yet another, which seemed to refer to a later phase of his life, he was revered as ‘a wise counsellor in matters of state’ and depicted as ‘an old man with a beard and long hair wearing a long tunic’. 10      Markhem), Hakluyt Society, London, 1873, vol.

Before his coming, it was said, ‘men lived in a condition of disorder, many went naked like savages; they had no houses or other dwellings than caves, and from these they went forth to gather whatever they could find to eat in the countryside.’ 11 Viracocha was credited with changing all this and with initiating the long-lost golden age which later ge nerations looked back on with nostalgia. All the legends agreed, furt hermore, that he had carried out his civilizing mission with great kindness and as far as possible had abjured the use of force: careful instruction and personal example had been the main methods used to equip the people with the techniques and knowledge necessary for a cultured and productive life. In particular, he was remembered for bringing to Peru such varied skills as medicine, metallurgy, farming, animal husbandry, the art of writing (said by the Incas to have been introduced by Viracocha but later forgotten), and a sophisticated understanding of the principles of engineering and architecture. I had already been impressed by the qu ality of Inca stonework in Cuzco. As my research in the old town continued, however, I was surprised to discover that by no means all th e so-called Inca masonry could be attributed with any degree of archaeological certainty to the Incas. It was true that they had been masters in the manipulation of stone, and many monuments in the Cuzco area were indisputably their work. It seemed, however, that some of the more remarkable structures routinely attributed to them could have been erected by earlier civilizations; the evidence suggested that the Incas ha d often functioned as the restorers of these structures rather than their original builders. The same appeared to be true of the highly developed system of roads connecting the far-flung parts of the Inca empire. The reader will recall that these roads took the form of parallel highways running north to south, one along the coast and the other through the Andes. All in all more than 15,000 miles of surfaced tracks had been in regular and efficient use before the time of the Spanish conquest, and I had assumed that the Incas had been responsible for all of them. I now learned that it was much more likely that they had inherited the system. Their role had been to restore, maintain and unify a pre-existing network. Indeed, though it was not often admitted, no expert could safely estimate how old these incredible highways were or who had built them. 12 The mystery was deepened by local traditions which stated not only that the road system and the sophisti cated architecture had been ‘ancient in the time of the Incas’, but that both ‘were the work of white, auburn-  11 Ibid., p. 72. 12 Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1991, 26:42."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 57 haired men’ who had lived thousands of years earlier. 13 One legend described Viracocha as being accompanied by ‘messengers’ of two kinds, ‘faithful soldiers’ ( huaminca ) and ‘shining ones’ ( hayhuay- panti ). Their role was to carry their lord’s message ‘to every part of the world’. 14 Elsewhere there were phrases such as: ‘Con Ticci returned ... with a number of attendants’; ‘Con Ticci then summoned his followers, who were called viracocha’; ‘Con Ticci co mmanded all but two of the viracocha to go east ...’ 15 ; ‘There came forth from a lake a Lord named Con Ticci Viracocha bringing with him a certain number of people ...’ 16 ; ‘Thus those viracochas went off to the various districts which Viracocha had indicated for them ...’. 17 The work of demons? The ancient citadel of Sacsayhuaman lie s just north of Cuzco. We reached it late one afternoon under a sky al most occluded by heavy clouds of tarnished silver. A cold grey breeze was blowing across the high-altitude tundra as I clambered up stairways, through lintelled stone gates built for giants, and walked along the mammoth rows of zig-zag walls. I craned my neck and looked up at a big granite boulder that my route now passed under. Twelve feet high, seven feet across, and weighing considerably more than 100 tons, it was a work of man, not nature. It had been cut and shaped into a symphonic harmony of angles, manipulated with apparent ease (as though it we re made of wax or putty) and stood on its end in a wall of other huge and problematic polygonal blocks, some of them positioned above it, so me below it, some to each side, and all in perfectly balanced and well-ordered juxtaposition. Since one of these astonishing pieces of carefully hewn stone had a height of twenty-eight feet an d was calculated to weigh 361 tons 18 (roughly the equivalent of five hundred family-sized automobiles), it seemed to me that a number of fund amental questions were crying out for answers. How had the Incas, or their predecessors, been able to work stone on such a gargantuan scale? How had th ey cut and shaped these Cyclopean boulders so precisely? How had they transported them tens of miles from  13 Ignatius Donnelly, Atlantis: The Antediluvian World, Harper & Brothers, New York, 1882, p. 394. 14 From the 'Relacion anonyma de los costumbres antiguos de los naturales del Piru', reported in The Facts on File Encyclopaedia .. ., p. 657. 15 Pears Encyclopaedia of Myths and Legends: Oceania, Australia and the Americas, (ed.

By what means had they made walls of them, shuffling the individual blocks around and ra ising them high above the ground with such apparent ease? These people weren’t even supposed to have had the wheel, let alone machinery capable of lifting and manipulating dozens of irregularly shaped 100-ton blocks, and sorting them into three- dimensional jigsaw puzzles. I knew that the chroniclers of the early colonial period had been as perplexed as I was by what they had seen. The respected Garcilaso de la Vega, for example, who came here in the sixteenth century, had spoken with awe about the fortress of Sacsayhuaman: Its proportions are inconceivable when one has not actually seen it; and when one has looked at it closely and examined it attentively, they appear to be so extraordinary that it seems as though some magic had presided over its construction; that it must be the work of demons instead of human beings. It is made of such great stones, and in such great number, that one wonders simultaneously how the Indians were able to quarry them, how they transported them ... and how they hewed them and set th em one on top of the other with such precision. For they disposed of neither ir on nor steel with which to penetrate the rock and cut and polish the stones; they had neither wagon nor oxen to transport them, and, in fact, there exist neither wagons nor oxen throughout the world that would have sufficed for this task, so enormous are these stones and so rude the mountain paths over which they were conveyed ... 19 Garcilaso also reported someth ing else interesting. In his Royal Commentaries of the Incas he gave an account of ho w, in historical times, an Inca king had tried to emulate the achievements of his predecessors who had built Sacsayhuaman. The attempt had involved bringing just one immense boulder from several miles away to add to the existing fortifications: ‘This boulder was hauled across the mountain by more than 20,000 Indians, going up and down very steep hills ... At a certain spot, it fell from their hands over a prec ipice crushing more than 3000 men.’ 20 In all the histories I surveyed, this was the only report which described the Incas actually building, or trying to build, with huge blocks like those employed at Sacsayhuaman. The report suggested that they possessed no experience of the techniques involved and that their attempt had ended in disaster. This, of course, proved nothing in itself. But Garcilaso’s story did intensify my doubts about the great fortifications which towered above me. As I looked at them I felt that they could, indeed, have been erected before the age of the Incas and by some infinitely older and more technically advanced race. Not for the first time I was reminded of how difficult archaeologists found it to provide accurate dates for engineering works like roads and drystone walls which co ntained no organic comp ounds.

Pending further advances in the latter field, therefore, ‘expert’ chronology was still largely the re sult of guesswork and subjective assumptions. Since it was known that the Incas had made intensive use of Sacsayhuaman I could easily understa nd why it had been assumed that they had built it. But there was no obvious or necessary connection between these two propositions. The Incas could just as well have found the structures already in place and moved into them. If so, who had the original builders been? The Viracochas, said the ancient myths, the bearded, white-skinned strangers, the ‘shining ones ’, the ‘faithful soldiers.’ As we travelled I continued to study the accounts of the Spanish adventurers and ethnographers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries who had faithfully recorded the ancient, pre-contact traditions of the Peruvian Indians. What was particularly noticeable about these traditions was the repeated emphasis that the coming of the Viracochas had been associated with a terrible deluge which had overwhelmed the earth and destroyed the gr eater part of humanity."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 60 Chapter 7 Were There Giants Then? Just after six in the morning the littl e train jerked into motion and began its slow climb up the st eep sides of the valley of Cuzco. The narrow- gauge tracks were laid out in a series of Z shapes. We chugged along the lower horizontal of the first Z, then shunted and went backwards up the oblique, shunted again and went fo rward along the upper horizontal— and so on, with numerous stops an d starts, following a route that eventually took us high above the ancient city. The Inca walls and colonial palaces, the narrow streets, the cathedral of Santo Domingo squatting atop the ruins of Viracocha’s temple, all looked spectral and surreal in the pearl-grey light of a dawn sky. A fairy pattern of electric lamps still decorated the streets, a thin mist seeped across the ground, and the smoke of domestic fires rose from th e chimneys over the tiled roofs of countless small houses. Eventually the train turned its back on Cuzco and we proceeded for a while in a straight north-westerly direction towards our destination: Machu Picchu, the lost city of th e Incas, some three hours and 130 kilometres away.

The foreground, brightly sunlit, consisted of flat green mead ows sprinkled with little patches of thawing frost, distributed on either side of a stream across a long, wide valley. In the middle of my view, dotted wi th bushes, was a large field on which a handful of black and white dairy cows grazed. Nearby was a scattered settlement of houses outside which stood small, dark-skinned Quechua Indians dressed in ponchos, balaclav as and colourful woollen hats. More distant were slopes canopied in fir trees and exotic eucalyptus. My eye followed the rising contours of a pair of high green mountains, which then parted to reveal folded and even more lofty uplands. Beyond these soared a far horizon surmounted by a jagged range of radiant and snowy peaks. Casting down the giants It was with understandable reluctance that I turned at last to my reading.

Jose de Acosta’s Natural and Moral History of the Indies, in which the learned priest set out ‘what the Indians themselves report of their beginning’: They make great mention of a deluge, which happened in their country ... The Indians say that all men were drowned in the deluge, and they report that out of Lake Titicaca came one Viracocha, who stayed in Tiahuanaco, where at this day there are to be seen the ruins of anci ent and very strange buildings, and from thence came to Cuzco, and so began mankind to multiply ... 1 Making a mental note to find out more about Lake Titicaca, and the mysterious Tiahuanaco, I read th e following passage summarizing a legend from the Cuzco area: For some crime unstated the people who lived in the most ancient times were destroyed by the creator ... in a deluge. Af ter the deluge the cr eator appeared in human form from Lake Titicaca. He then created the sun and moon and stars. After that he renewed the human population of the earth ... 2 In another myth The great Creator God, Viracocha, decided to make a world for men to live in. First he made the earth and sky. Then he began to make people to live in it, carving great stone figures of giants which he brought to life. At first all went well but after a time the giants began to fight among themselves and refused to work. Viracocha decided that he must destroy them. Some he turned back into stone ... the rest he overwhelmed with a great flood. 3 Very similar notions were, of course , found in other, quite unconnected, sources, such as the Jewish Old Testament. In Chapter six of the Book of Genesis, for example, which describes the Hebrew God’s displeasure with his creation and his decisi on to destroy it, I had long been intrigued by one of the few descriptive statements made about the forgotten era before the Flood. According to the enig matic language of that statement, ‘There were giants in th e earth in those days ...’. 4 Could the ‘giants’ buried in the biblical sands of th e Middle East be connected in some unseen way to the ‘giants’ woven into the fabric of pre-Colombian native American legends? Adding considerably to the mystery was the fact that the Jewish and Peruvian sources both went on, with many further details in common, to depict an angry deity unleashing a catastrophic flood upon a wicked and disobedient world. On the next page of the sheaf of documents I had assembled was this Inca account of the deluge handed do wn by a certain Father Molina in his Relacion de las fabulas y ritos de los Yngas: In the life of Manco Capac, who was the first Inca, and from whom they began to  1 José de Acosta, The Natural and Moral History of the Indies, Book I, Chapter four, in South American Mythology, p. 61. 2 Ibid., p. 82. 3 D.

No living thing survived except a man and a woman who remained in a box and, when the waters subsided, the wind carried them ... to Tiahuana co [where] the creator began to raise up the people and the nations that are in that region ... 5 Garcilaso de la Vega, the son of a Spanish nobleman and an Inca royal woman, was already familiar to me from his Royal Commentaries of the Incas. He was regarded as one of the most reliable chroniclers of the traditions of his mother’s people an d had done his work in the sixteenth century, soon after the conquest, when those traditions had not yet been contaminated by foreign influenc es. He, too, confirmed what had obviously been a universal and deeply impressed belief: ‘After the waters of the deluge had subsided, a certain man appeared in the country of Tiahuanaco ...’ 6 That man had been Viracocha.

He worked miracles of healing and could call down fire from heaven. To the Indians it must have seemed that he had materialized from nowhere.

Huge bl ack mountains, upon which not a trace of snow remained to reflect the sunlight, towered darkly above us and we seemed to be running through a rocky defile at the end of a narrow valley filled with sombre shadows. The ai r was cold and so were my feet. I shivered and resumed reading. One thing was obvious amid the confused web of legends I had reviewed, legends which supplemente d one another but also at times conflicted. All the scholars agreed that the Incas had borrowed, absorbed and passed on the traditions of many of the different civilized peoples over whom they had extended their control during the centuries of expansion of their vast empire. In this sense, whatever the outcome of the historical debate over the antiquity of the Incas themselves, nobody could seriously dispute their role as transmitters of the ancient belief systems of all the great archaic cu ltures—coastal and highland, known and unknown—that had preced ed them in this land. And who could say just what civilizations might have existed in Peru in the unexplored regions of the past? Every year archaeologists come up  5 Fr..

So why shouldn’t they one day discover evidence of the penetration into the Andes, in remote antiquity, of a race of civilizers who had come from overseas and gone away again after completing their work? That was what the legends seemed to me to be suggesting, legends that most of all, and most clearly, had immortalized the memory of the man/god Viracocha striding the high windswept byways of the Andes working miracles wherever he went: Viracocha himself, with his two assistants, journeyed north ... He travelled up the cordillera, one assistant went along the co ast, and the other up the edge of the eastern forests ... The Crea tor proceeded to Urcos, near Cuzco, where he commanded the future population to emerge from a mountain. He visited Cuzco, and then continued north to Ecuador. There, in the coastal province of Manta, he took leave of his people and, walking on the waves, disappeared across the ocean. 7 There was always this poignant moment of goodbye at the end of every folk memory featuring the remarkable stranger whose name meant ‘Foam of the Sea’: Viracocha went on his way, calling forth the races of men ... When he came to the district of Puerto Viejo he was joined by his followers whom he had sent on before, and when they had joined him he put to sea in their company and they say that he and his people went by water as easily as they had traversed the land. 8 Always this poignant goodbye ... and often a hint of science or magic.

The air temperature had warmed- up noticeably: we had descended into a relatively low-lying valley with its own tropical micro-climate. The mountain slopes rising on either side of the tracks were densely covered in gr een forests and I was reminded that this was truly a region of vast an d virtually insuperable obstacles. Whoever had ventured all this way into the middle of nowhere to build Machu Picchu must have had a ve ry strong motive for doing so. Whatever the reason had been, the choice of such a remote location had at least one beneficial side-effect: Machu Picchu was never found by the conquistadores and friars during their days of destructive zeal. Indeed, it was not until 1911, when the fabulous heritage of older races was beginning to be treated with greater respect, that a young American explorer, Hiram Bingham, revealed Machu Picchu to the world.

Having passed through a one-hors e town named Agua Caliente (Hot Water), where a few broken-down rest aurants and cheap bars leered at travellers from beside the tracks , we reached Machu Picchu Puentas Ruinas station at ten minutes past nine in the morning. From here a half- hour bus ride on a winding dirt road up the side of a steep and forbidding mountain brought us to Ma chu Picchu itself, to the ruins, and to a bad hotel which charged us a no nsensical amount of money for a not very clean room. We were the only guests. Though it had been years since the local guerrilla movement had last bombed the Machu Picchu train, not many foreigners were keen to come here any more. Machu Picchu dreaming It was two in the afternoon. I stood on a high point at the southern end of the site. The ruins stretched out northwards in lichen-enshrouded terraces before me. Thick clouds were wrapped in a ring around the mountain tops but the sunlight still occasionally burst through here and there. Way down on the valley floor I could see the sacred river curled in a hairpin loop right around the centra l formation on which Machu Picchu was based, like a moat surrounding a giant castle. The river showed deep green from this vantage point, refl ecting the greenness of the steep jungle slopes. And there were patches of white water and wonderful sparkling gleams of light. I gazed across the ruins towards the dominant peak. Its name is Huana Picchu and it used to feature in all the classic travel agency posters of this site. To my astonishment I now observ ed that for a hundred metres or so below its summit it had been neatly terraced and sculpted: somebody had been up there and had carefully raked the near-vertical cliffs into a graceful hanging garden which ha d perhaps in ancient times been planted with bright flowers. It seemed to me that the entire site, together with its setting, was a monumental work of sculpture composed in part of mountains, in part of rock, in part of trees, in part of stones—and also in part of water. It was a heartachingly beautiful place, certainly one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen. Despite its luminous brilliance, howeve r, I felt that I was gazing down on to a city of ghosts. It was like the wreck of the Marie Celeste, deserted and restless. The houses were arranged in long terraces.

And there were st range and unusual devices such as the Intihuatana, the ‘hitching post of the sun’. This remarkable artefact consisted of an elemental chunk of be drock, grey and crystalline, carved into a complex geometrical form of cu rves and angles, incised niches and external buttresses, surmounted at the centre by a stubby vertical prong. Jigsaw puzzle How old is Machu Picchu? The academic consensus is that the city could not have been built much earlier than the fifteenth century AD . 9 Dissenting opinions, however, have from time to time been expressed by a number of more daring but respectable scholars. In the 1930s, for example, Rolf Muller, professor of Astronomy at the University of Potsdam, found convincing evidence to suggest that the most important features of Machu Picchu possessed significant astronomical alignments. From these, through the use of detailed mathematical computations concerning star positions in the sky in previous millennia (which gradually alter down the epochs as the result of a phenomenon known as precession of the equinoxes), Muller concluded that the original layout of the site could only have been accomplished during ‘the era of 4000 BC to 2000 BC ’. 10 In terms of orthodox history, this was a heresy of audacious proportions. If Muller was right, Machu Picchu was not a mere 500 but could be as much as 6000 years old. This would make it significantly older than the Great Pyramid of Egypt (assuming, of course, that one accepted the Great Pyramid’s own orthodox dating of around 2500 BC ). There were other dissenting voices concerning the antiquity of Machu Picchu, and most, like Muller, were conv inced that parts of the site were thousands of years older than the date favoured by orthodox historians. 11 Like the big polygonal blocks that ma de up the walls, this was a notion  9 The Ancient Civilizations of Peru, p. 163. 10 Cited in Zecharia Sitchin, The Lost Realms, Avon Books, New York, 1990, p. 164. 11 Another scholar, Maria Schulten de D'Ebneth, also worked with mathematical methods (as opposed to historical methods which are heavily speculative and interpretive). Her objective was to rediscover the ancient grid used to determine Machu Picchu's layout in relation to the cardinal points. She did this after first establishing the existence of a central 45° line. In the process she stumbl ed across something else: ‘The sub-angles that she calculated between the central 45° line and sites located away from it ... indicated to her that the earth's tilt (\"obliquity\") at the time this grid was laid out was close to 24° o’. This means that the grid was planned (according to her) 5125 years before her measurements were done in 1953; in other words in 3172 BC .’ The Last Realms, pp. 204-5."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 67 that looked as though it might fit with other pieces of a jigsaw puzzle—in this case the jigsaw puzzle of a pa st that didn’t quite make sense any more.

To reach it we had to cross a neck of water by improvised car ferry at the fishing town of Tiquine. Then, with dusk descending, we followed the main highwa y, now little more than a narrow and uneven track, up a series of steep hairpin bends and on to the shoulder of a mountain spur. From this point a contrasting panorama unfolded: the dark, dark waters of the lake below appeared to lie at the edge of a limitless ocean drowned in sombre shadows, and yet the jagged peaks of the snowcapped moun tains in the distance were still drenched in dazzling sunlight. From the very beginning Lake Titicaca seemed to me a special place. I knew that it lay some 12,500 feet above sea level, that the frontier between Peru and Bolivia passed through it, that it covered an area of 3200 square miles and was 138 miles lo ng by about 70 miles wide. I also knew it was deep, reaching almost 1000 feet in places, and had a puzzling geological history. Here are the mysteries, and some of the solutions that have been proposed: 1 Though now more than two miles ab ove sea level, the area around Lake Titicaca is littered with milli ons upon millions of fossilized sea shells. This suggests that at some stage the whole of the Altiplano was forced upwards from the sea-bed, perhaps as part of the general terrestrial rising that formed South America as a whole. In the process great quantities of ocean water, together with countless myriads of living marine creatures, were sc ooped up and suspended among the Andean ranges. 1 This is thought to have happened not more recently than about 100 million years ago. 2 2 Paradoxically, despite the mighty antiquity of this event, Lake Titicaca has retained, until the present day, ‘a marine icthyofauna’ 3 , in other words, though now located hundreds of miles from any ocean, its fish and crustacea feature many oceanic (rather than freshwater) types. Surprising creatures brought to the surface in fishermen’s nets have  1 Professor Arthur Posnansky, Tiahuanacu: The Cradle of American Man, Ministry of Education, La Paz, Bolivia, 1957, volume III p. 192.

Since its formation this great ‘interior sea’, and the Altiplano itself, has undergone se veral other drastic and dramatic changes. Of these by far the most notable is that the lake’s extent appears to have fluctuated enormously, indicated by the existence of an ancient strandline visible on much of the surrounding terrain. Puzzlingly, this strandline is not level but slopes markedly from north to south over a considerable horizo ntal distance. At the northernmost point surveyed it is as much as 29 5 feet higher than Titicaca; some 400 miles farther south, it is 274 fe et lower than the present level of the lake. 6 From this, and much other evidence, geologists have deduced that the Altiplano is st ill gradually risi ng, but in an unbalanced manner with greater altitudes being attained in the northern part and lesser in the sout hern. The process involved here is thought to have less to do with changes in the level of Titicaca’s waters themselves (although such changes have certainly occurred) than with changes in the level of the whole terrain in which the lake is situated. 7 4 Much harder to explain in such te rms, however, given the very long time periods major geological transformations are supposed to require, is irrefutable evidence that the city of Tiahuanaco was once a port, complete with extensive docks, positioned right on the shore of Lake Titicaca . 8 The problem is that Ti ahuanaco’s ruins are now marooned about twelve miles south of the lake and more than 100 feet higher than the present shoreline. 9 In the period since the city was built, it therefore foll ows that one of two things must have happened: either the level of lake has fall en greatly or the land on which Tiahuanaco stands has risen comparably. 5 Either way it is obvious that there have been massive and traumatic  4 Tiahuanacu, J.

Some of these, such as the rise of the Altiplano from the floor of the ocean, certainly took place in remote geological ages, before the advent of human civilization. Others are not nearly so ancient and must have occurre d after the construction of Tiahuanaco. 10 The question, therefore, is this: when was Tiahuanaco built? The orthodox historical view is that the ruins cannot possibly be dated much earlier than AD 500. 11 An alternative chronology also exists, however, which, although not accepted by the majority of scholars, seems more in tune with the scale of the geological upheavals that have occurred in this region. Based on the mathematical/astronomical calculations of Professor Arthur Posnansky of the University of La Paz, and of Professor Rolf Muller (who also challenged the official dating of Machu Picchu), it pushes the main phase of construction at Tiahuanaco back to 15,000 BC . This chronology also indicates that the city later suffered immense destruction in a phenomenal natural catastrophe around the eleventh millennium BC , and thereafter rapidly became separated from the lakeshore. 12 We shall be reviewing Posnansky’s and Muller’s findings in Chapter Eleven, findings which suggest that th e great Andean city of Tiahuanaco flourished during the last Ice Age in the deep, dark, moonless midnight of prehistory.  10 Earth In Upheaval, p. 76: ‘The conservative view among evolutionists and geologists is that mountain-making is a slow process, observable in minute changes, and that because it is a continuous process there never could have been spontaneous upliftings on a large scale.

In this variant, which was from the area around Lake Titi caca known as the Collao, the deity civilizing-hero had been named Thunupa: Thunupa appeared on the Altiplano in anci ent times, coming from the north with five disciples. A white man of august presence, blue-eyed, and bearded, he was sober, puritanical and preached against drunkenness, polygamy and war. 1 After travelling great distances through the Andes, where he created a peaceful kingdom and taught men all the arts of civilization, 2 Thunupa was struck down and grievously wounded by a group of jealous conspirators: They put his blessed body in a boat of totora rush and set it adrift on Lake Titicaca. There ... he sailed away with such speed that those who had tried so cruelly to kill him were left behind in te rror and astonishment—for this lake has no current ... The boat came to the shore at Cochamarca, where today is the river Desguardero.

And on the water so released the holy body was carried many leagues away to the sea coast at Africa ... 3 Boats, water and salvation There are curious parallels here to the story of Osiris, the ancient Egyptian high god of death and resurrection. The fullest account of the original myth defining this myster ious figure is given by Plutarch 4 and says that, after bringing the gifts of civilization to his people, teaching them all manner of useful skills , abolishing cannibalism and human sacrifice, and providing them with thei r first legal code, Osiris left Egypt and travelled about the world to spread the benefits of civilization to other nations as well.

While he was gone, however, he wa s plotted against by seventy-two members of his court, led by his brot her-in-law Set. On his return the conspirators invited him to a banque t where a splendid coffer of wood and gold was offered as a prize to any guest who could fit into it exactly. Osiris did not know that the coffer had been constructed precisely to his body measurements. As a result, when the assembled guests tried one by one to get into it they failed. Osiris lay down comfortably inside. Before he had time to get out the conspirators rushed forward, nailed the lid tightly closed and sealed even the cracks with molten lead so that there would be no air. The coffer was then thrown into the Nile. It had been intended that it should sink, but it floated rapidly away, drifting for a considerable distance until it reached the sea coast. At this point the goddess Isis, wife of Osiris, intervened. Using all the great magic for which she was renowned, she found the coffer and concealed it in a secret place. However, her evil brother Set, out hunting in the marshes, discovered the coffer, opened it and, in a mad fury, cut the royal corpse into fourteen pieces which he scattered throughout the land. Once more Isis set off to save her husband. She made a small boat of papyrus reeds, coated with pitch, and embarked on the Nile in search of the remains. When she had found them she worked powerful spells to reunite the dismembered parts of the body so that it resumed its old form. Thereafter, in an intact and pe rfect state, Osiris went through a process of stellar rebirth to become god of the dead and king of the underworld—from which place, legend had it, he occasionally returned to earth in the guise of a mortal man. 5 Although there are huge differences be tween the traditions it is bizarre that Osiris in Egypt and Thunupa-Viracocha in South America should have had all of the following points in common: • both were great civilizers; • both were conspired against; • both were struck down; • both were sealed inside a cont ainer or vessel of some kind; • both were then cast into water; • both drifted away on a river; • both eventually reached the sea.

The sky above was clear blue, reflecting aqua marine and turquois e tints inshore, and the vast body of the lake, glinting in copper and silver tones, seemed to stretch away for ever ... The passages in the legends that spoke of vessels made of reeds needed to be followed up because I knew that ‘boats of totora rush’ were a traditional form of transport on th is lake. However, the ancient skills required to build craft of this type had atrophied in recent years and we were now headed towards Suriqui, the one place where they were still properly made. On Suriqui Island, in a small village close to the lakeshore, I found two elderly Indians making a boat from bundled totora rushes. The elegant craft, which appeared to be nearly complete, was approximately fifteen feet long. It was wide amidships, but narrow at either end with a high curving prow and stern. I sat down for a while to watch. The more senior of the two builders, who wore a brown felt hat over a curious peaked woollen cap, repeatedly braced his bare left foot against the side of the vessel to give additional leverage as he pulled and tightened the cords that held the bundles of reeds in place. From time to time I noticed that he rubbed a length of cord against his own pers piring brow—thus moisteni ng it to increase its adhesion. The boat, surrounded by chickens an d occasionally investigated by a shy, browsing alpaca, stood amid a litter of discarded rushes in the backyard of a ramshackle farmhouse. It was one of several I was able to study over the next few hours and, though the setting was unmistakably Andean, I found myself repeated ly overtaken by a sense of déjà vu from another place and another time. The reason was that the totora vessels of Suriqui were virtually identical, both in the method of construction and in finished appearance, to the beautiful craft fashioned from papyrus reeds in which the Pharaohs had sailed the Nile thousands of years previously. In my travels in Egypt I had examined the images of many such vessels painted on the walls of ancient tombs. It sent a tingle down my spine to see them now so colourfully brought to life on an obscure island on Lake Titicaca—even though my research ha d partially prepared me for this coincidence. I knew that no satisfac tory explanation had ever been given for how such close and richly detailed similarities of boat design could occur in two such widely separated pl aces.

Both, for example, were equipped with sails mounted on peculiar two-legged straddled masts. 8 Both had also been used for the long-distance transport of exceptionally heavy building materi als: obelisks and gargantuan blocks of stone bound for the temples at Gi za and Luxor and Abydos on the one hand and for the mysterious edifices of Tiahuanaco on the other.

That was in the sixteenth century. More than 400 years later, at the end of the twentieth century, I shared Garcilaso’s puzzlement. Scattered around Tiahuanaco, in defiance of th e looters who had ro bbed the site of so much in recent years, were mono liths so big and cumbersome yet so well cut that they almost seemed to be the work of super-beings. Sunken temple Like a disciple at the feet of his ma ster, I sat on the floor of the sunken temple and looked up at the enigma tic face which all the scholars of Tiahuanaco believed was intended to represent Viracocha. Untold centuries ago, unknown hands had carved this likeness into a tall pillar of red rock. Though now much eroded, it was the likeness of a man at peace with himself. It was the likeness of a man of power ... He had a high forehead, and large, round eyes. His nose was straight, narrow at the bridge but flaring towa rds the nostrils. His lips were full. His distinguishing feature, however, was his stylish and imposing beard, which had the effect of making his fa ce broader at the jaws than at the temples. Looking more closely, I could see that the sculptor had portrayed a man whose skin was shaved all around his lips with the result that his moustache began high on his cheeks, roughly parallel with the end of his nose. From there it curved extravagantly down beside the corners of his mouth, forming an exaggerated goatee at the chin, and then followed his jawline back to his ears. Above and below the ears, on the si de of the head, were carved odd"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 79 representations of animals. Or perh aps it would be better to describe these carvings as representations of odd animals, because they looked like big, clumsy, prehistoric mammals with fat tails and club feet. There were other points of interest. For example, the stone figure of Viracocha had been sculpted with the hands and arms folded, one below the other, over the front of a long, flow ing robe. On each side of this robe appeared the sinuous form of a snake coiling upwards from ground to shoulder level. And as I looked at th is beautiful design (the original of which had perhaps been embroidered on rich cloth) the picture that came into my mind was of Viracocha as a wizard or a sorcerer, a bearded, Merlin-like figure dressed in weird and wonderful clothes, calling down fire from heaven. The ‘temple’ in which the Viracocha pillar stood was open to the sky and consisted of a large, rectangular pit, like a swimming pool, dug out six feet below ground level. Its floor , about 40 feet long by 30 feet wide, was composed of hard, flat gravel. It s strong vertical walls were formed from precisely dressed ashlar blocks of varying sizes laid closely against one another without mortar in the joints and interspersed with taller, rough-hewn stelae. A set of steps was let into the southern wall and it was down these I had come when I had entered the structure. I walked several times around the figure of Viracocha, resting my fingers on the sun-warmed stone pillar, trying to guess its purpose. It was perhaps seven feet tall and it faced south, with its back to the old shoreline of Lake Titicaca (origina lly less than six hundred feet away). 4 Ranged out behind this central obelisk, furthermore, there were two others, of smaller stature, possibly intended to represent Viracocha’s legendary companions. All three figu res, being severely, functionally vertical, cast clean-edged shadows as I gazed at them, for the sun was past its zenith. I sat down on the ground again and looked slowly all around the temple. Viracocha dominated it, like the conductor of an orchestra, and yet its most striking feature undoub tedly lay elsewhere: lining the walls, at various points and heights, were dozens and dozens of human heads sculpted in stone. These were complete heads, protruding three dimensionally out of the walls. Th ere were several different (and contradictory) scholarly opin ions as to their function. Pyramid From the floor of the sunken temple, looking west, I could see an immense wall into which was set an impressive geometrical gateway made of large stone slabs. Silhouette d in this gateway by the afternoon sun was the figure of a giant. The wall, I knew, enclosed a parade-ground-  4 Bolivia, p. 156 (map)."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 80 sized area called the Kalasasaya (a word in the local Aymara language meaning simply ‘Place of the Upright Standing Stones’ 5 ). And the giant was one of the huge time-worn pieces of sculpture referred to by Garcilaso de la Vega. I was eager to take a l ook at it, but for the moment my attention was diverted southwards towards an arti ficial hill, 50 feet high, which lay almost directly ahead of me as I climbed the steps out of the sunken temple. The hill, which had also been mentioned by Garcilaso, was known as the Akapana Pyramid. Like the pyramids at Giza in Egypt, it was oriented with surprising precision towards the cardinal points. Unlike those pyramids its ground-plan was somewhat irregular. Nonetheless, it measured roughly 690 feet on each side which meant that it was a hulking piece of architecture and the dominant edifice of Tiahuanaco. I walked towards it now, and spent some time strolling around it and clambering over it. Originally it had been a clean-sided step-pyramid of earth faced with large andesite blocks. In the centuries since the conquest, however, it had been used as a quarry by builders from as far away as La Paz, with the result that only about ten per cent of its superb facing blocks now remained. What clues, what evidence, had those nameless thieves carried off with them? As I climbed up the broken sides and around the deep grassy troughs in the top of the Akapana, I realized that the true function of the pyramid was probably never going to be understood. All that was certain was that it had not been merely decorative or ceremonial. On the contrary, it seemed almost as though it might have functioned as some kind of arcane ‘device’ or machine. Deep within its bowels, archaeologists had discovered a complex network of zig-zagging stone channels, lined with fine ashlars. These had been me ticulously angled and jointed (to a tolerance of one-fiftieth of an inch), and had served to sluice water down from a large reservoir at the top of the structure, through a series of descending levels, to a moat that encircled the entire site, washing against the pyramid’s base on its southern side. 6 So much care and attent ion had been lavished on all this plumbing, so many man-hours of highly skilled and patient labour, that the Akapana made no sense unless it had been en dowed with a significant purpose. A number of archaeologists, I knew, had speculated that this purpose might have been connected with a rain or river cult involving a primitive veneration of the powers and attr ibutes of fast-flowing water. One sinister suggestion, which impl ied that the unknown ‘technology’ of the pyramid might have had a lethal purpose, was derived from the meaning of the words Hake and Apana in the ancient Aymara language  5 H. S. Bellamy and P. Allan, The Calendar of Tiahuanaco: The Measuring System of the Oldest Civilization, Faber & Faber, London, 1956, p. 16. 6 For a detailed discussion of the hydraulic system of the Akapana see Tiahuanacu: II, pp. 69-79."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 81 still spoken hereabouts: ‘Hake means “people” or “men”; Apana means “to perish” (probably by water). Thus Akapana is a place where people perish ...’ 7 Another commentator, however, afte r making a careful assessment of all the characteristics of the hydraulic system, proposed a different solution, namely that the sluices ha d most probably been part of ‘a processing technique— the use of flowing water for washing ores, perhaps?’ 8 Gateway of the Sun Leaving the western side of the enigmatic pyramid, I made my way towards the south-west corner of the enclosure known as the Kalassaya. I could now see why it had been called the Place of the Upright Standing Stones for this was precisely what it was. At regular intervals in a wall composed of bulky trapezoidal blocks , huge dagger-like monoliths more than twelve feet high had been sunk hilt-first into the red earth of the Altiplano. The effect was of a gian t stockade, almost 500 feet square, rising about twice as far above the ground as the sunken temple had been interred beneath it. Had the Kalasasaya been a fortress then? Apparently not. Scholars now generally accept that it function ed as a sophisticated celestial observatory. Rather than keeping enemies at bay, its purpose had been to fix the equinoxes and the solstices and to predict, with mathematical precision, the various seasons of the year. Certain structures within its walls, (and, indeed, the walls themselv es), appeared to have been lined up to particular star groups and designed to facilitate measurement of the amplitude of the sun in summer, winter, autumn and spring. 9 In addition, the famous ‘Gateway of the Sun’, which stood in the north-west corner of the enclosure, was not only a world-class work of art but was thought by those who had studied it to be a complex and accurate calendar carved in stone: The more one gets acquainted with the sculpture the greater becomes one’s conviction that the peculiar lay-out and pictorialism of this Calendar cannot possibly have been the result merely of the ultimately unfathomable whim of an artist, but that its glyphs, deeply senseful, constitute the eloquent record of the observations and calculations of a scientist ... The Calendar could not have been drawn up and laid out in any other way than this. 10 My background research had made me especially curious about the Gateway of the Sun and, indeed, about the Kalasasaya as a whole.

These, he says, were based ‘solely and exclusively on the difference in the obliquity of the ec liptic of the period in which the Kalasasaya was built and that which it is today’. 1 What exactly is ‘the obliquity of the ecliptic’, and why does it make Tiahuanaco 17,000 years old? According to the dictionary definition it is ‘the angle between the plane of the earth’s orbit and that of the celestial equator, equal to approximately 23° 27’ at present’. 2 To clarify this obscure astronomical notion, it helps to picture the earth as a ship, sailing on the vast ocean of the heavens. Like all such vessels (be they planets or schooners), it rolls slightly with the swell that flows beneath it. Picture yourself on board that ship as it rolls, standing on the deck, gazing out to sea. You rise up on the crest of a wave and your visible horizon increases; you fall ba ck into a trough and it decreases. The process is regular, mathematical, like the tick-tock of a great metronome: a constant, almost imperceptible, nodding, perpetually changing the angle between yourself and the horizon. Now picture the earth agai n. Floating in space, as every schoolchild knows, the axis of daily rotation of our beautiful blue planet lies slightly tilted away from the vertical in its orbit around the sun. From this it follows that the terrestrial equator, and hence the ‘celestial equator’ (which is merely an imaginary extens ion of the earth’s equator into the celestial sphere) must also lie at an angle to the orbital plane. That angle, at any one time, is the obliquity of the ecliptic. But because the earth is a ship that rolls, its obliquity changes in a cyclical manner over very long periods. During each cycle of 41,000 years the obliquity varies, with the precision and predictability of a Sw iss chronograph, between 22.1° and  1 Tiahuanacu, II, p. 89. 2 Collins English Dictionary, London, 1982, p. 1015. In addition, Dr John Mason of the British Astronomical Association defined obliquity of the ecliptic in a telephone interview on 7 October 1993: ‘The earth spins about an axis which goes through its centre and its north and south poles. This axis is inclined to the plane of the earth's orbit around the sun. This tilt is called the obliquity of the ecliptic. The current value for the obliquity of the ecliptic is 23.44 degrees.’"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 84 24.5°. 3 The sequence in which one angle will follow another, as well as the sequence of all previous angles (at any period of history) can be calculated by means of a few straightforward equations. These have been expressed as a curve on a graph (origi nally plotted out in Paris in 1911 by the International Conference of Ephe merids) and from this graph it is possible to match angles and precise historical dates with confidence and accuracy. Posnansky was able to date the Kalasasaya because the obliquity cycle gradually alters the azimuth position of sunrise and sunset from century to century. 4 By establishing the solar alignm ents of certain key structures that now looked ‘out of true’, he convincingly demonstrated that the obliquity of the ecliptic at the time of the building of the Kalasasaya had been 23° 8’ 48”. When that angle was plotted on the graph drawn up by the International Conference of Epheme rids it was found to correspond to a date of 15,000 BC . 5 Of course, not a single orthodox historian or archaeologist was prepared to accept such an early origin for Tiahuanaco preferring, as noted in Chapter Eight, to agree on the safe estimate of AD 500. During the years 1927-30, however, several scientists from other disciplines checked carefully Posnansky’s ‘astronomic-archaeological investigations’. These scientists, members of a high-powered team which also studied many other archaeological sites in th e Andes, were Dr Hans Ludendorff (then director of the Astronomical Ob servatory of Potsdam), Dr Friedrich Becker of the Specula Vaticanica, and two other astronomers: Professor Dr Arnold Kohlschutter of the Universi ty of Bonn and Dr Rolf Muller of the Astrophysical Institute of Potsdam. 6 At the end of their three years of work the scientists concluded that Posnansky was basically right. They didn’t concern themselves with the implications of their findings for the prevailing paradigm of history; they simply stated the observable facts ab out the astronomical alignments of various structures at Tiahuanaco. Of these, the most important by far was that the Kalasasaya had been laid out to conform with observations of the heavens made a very long time ag o—much, much further back than AD 500. Posnansky’s figure of 15,000 BC was pronounced to be well within the bounds of possibility. 7 If Tiahuanaco had indeed flourished so long before the dawn of history, what sort of people had built it, and for what purpose?  3 J.

One, a figure nicknamed El Fraile (The Friar) stood in the south-west corner; the other, towards the centre of the eastern end of the enclosure, was the giant that I had observed from the sunken temple. Carved in red sandstone, worn and an cient beyond reckoning, El Fraile stood about six feet high, and portrayed a humanoid, androgenous being with massive eyes and lips. In its right hand it clutched something resembling a knife with a wavy blade like an Indonesian kris. In its left hand was an object like a hinged an d case-bound book. From the top of this ‘book’, however, protruded a devi ce which had been inserted into it as though into a sheath. From the waist down the figure appeared to be clad in a garment of fish scales, and, as though to confirm this perception, the sculptor had formed the individual scales out of rows and rows of small, highly- stylized fish-heads. This sign had been persuasively interpreted by Posnansky as meaning fish in general. 8 It seemed, therefore, that El Fraile was a portrayal of an imaginary or symbolic ‘fish man’. The figure was also equipped with a belt sculpted with the images of several large crustaceans, so this notion seemed all the more probable. What had been intended? I had learned of one local tradition I thought might shed light on the matter. It was very ancient and spoke of ‘gods of the lake, with fish tails, called Chullua and Umantua’. 9 In this, and in the fish-garbed figures, it seemed that there was a curious out-of-place echo of Mesopotamian myths, which spoke strangely, and at length, about amphibious beings, ‘endowed with reason’ who had visited the land of Sumer in remote prehistory. The leader of these beings was named Oannes (or Uan ). 10 According to the Chaldean scribe, Berosus: The whole body of [Oannes] was like that of a fish; and had under a fish’s head another head, and also feet below, similar to those of a man, subjoined to the fish’s tail. His voice too, and language, was articulate and human; and a representation of him is pres erved even to this day ... When the sun set, it was the custom of this Being to plunge again into the sea, and abide all night in the deep; for he was amphibious. 11 According to the traditions reported by Berosus, Oannes was, above all, a civilizer: In the day-time he used to converse with men; but took no food at that season;  8 Ibid., I, p. 119. 9 Ibid., II, p. 183. 10 Myths from Mesopotamia, (trans, and ed.

From that time, so universal were his instructions, nothing has been added materially by way of improvement ... 12 Surviving images of the Oannes crea tures I had seen on Babylonian and Assyrian reliefs clearly portrayed fish-garbed men. Fish-scales formed the dominant motif on their garments, just as they did on those worn by El Fraile. Another similarity was that the Babylonian figures held unidentified objects in both their hands. If my memory served me right (and I later confirmed that it did) these objects were by no means identical to those carried by El Fraile. They were, however, similar enough to be worthy of note. 13 The other great ‘idol’ of the Kalasasaya was positioned towards the eastern end of the platform, facing the main gateway, and was an imposing monolith of grey andesite , hugely thick and standing about nine feet tall. Its broad head rose st raight up out of its hulking shoulders and its slab-like face stared expre ssionlessly into the distance. It was wearing a crown, or head-band of some kind, and its hair was braided into orderly rows of long vertical ringlets which were most clearly visible at the back. The figure was also intricately carv ed and decorated ac ross much of its surface almost as though it were tattooed. Like El Fraile, it was clad below the waist in a garment composed offi sh-scales and fish symbols. And, also like El Fraile, it held two unidentifiable objects in its hands. This time the left-hand object looked more lik e a sheath than a case-bound book, and from it protruded a forked handle. The right-hand object was roughly cylindrical, narrow in the centre where it was held, wider at the shoulders and at the base, and then narrowing again towards the top. It appeared to have several different sections, or part s, fitted over and into one another, but it was impossible to gues s what it might represent.  12 Ibid. 13 Jeremy Black and Anthony Green, Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia, British Museum Press, 1992, pp. 46, 82-3."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 87 Assyrian relief of fish-garbed figure.

The stonework was of exceptionally high qu ality and authorities agreed that it was ‘one of the archaeological wonders of the Americas’. 15 Its most enigmatic feature was the so-called ‘calendar frieze’ carved into its eastern façade along the top of the portal. At its centre, in an elevated position , this frieze was dominated by what scholars took to be another representation of Viracocha, 16 but this time in his more terrifying aspect as the god- king who could call down fire from heaven. His gentle, fatherly side was still expressed: tears of compassion were running down his cheeks. But hi s face was set stern and hard, his tiara was regal and imposing, and in either hand he grasped a thunderbolt. 17 In the interpretation given by Joseph Campbell, one of the twentieth century’s best-known studen ts of myth, ‘The meaning is that the grace that pours into the universe through the sun door is the same as the energy of the bolt that annihi lates and is itself indestructible ...’ 18 I turned my head to right and left, slowly studying the remainder of the frieze. It was a beautifully balanced pi ece of sculpture with three rows of eight figures, twenty-four in all, lined up on either side of the elevated central image. Many attempts, none of them particularly convincing, have been made to explain the assumed ca lendrical function of these figures. 19 All that could really be said for sure was that they had a peculiar, bloodless, cartoon-like quality, and that there was something coldly mathematical, almost machinelike, about the way they seemed to march in regimented lines towards Viracocha. Some apparently wore bird masks, others had sharply pointed noses, and each had in his hand an implement of the type the high god was himself carrying. The base of the frieze was filled with a design known as the ‘Meander’—a geometrical series of step-pyramid forms set in a continuous line, and arranged alternately upside down and right side up, which was also thought to have had a calendrical function. On the third column from the right-hand side (and, more faintly, on the third column from the left-hand side too) I could make out a clear carving of an elephant’s head, ears, tusks and trunk. This was unexpected since there are no elephants anywhere in the Ne w World. There had been, however, in prehistoric times, as I was able to confirm much later. Particularly numerous in the southern Andes, until their sudden extinction around 10,000 BC , 20 had been the members of a species called Cuvieronius, an  15 Ibid. 16 Ibid. 17 See Joseph Campbell, The Hero with a Thousand Faces, Paladin Books, London, 1988, p. 145. 18 Ibid., p. 146. 19 The calendrical function of the Gateway of the Sun is fully described and analysed by Posnansky in Tiahuanacu: The Cradle of American Man, volumes I-IV. 20 Quaternary Extinctions: A Prehistoric Revolution, Paul S.

Each turned out to be composed of the heads of two crested condors, placed throat to throat (the crests constituting the ‘ears’ and the upper part of the necks the ‘tusks’). The creatures thus formed still looked like elephants to me, perhaps because a characteristic visual trick the sculptors of Tiahuanaco had employed again and again in their subtle and otherworldly art had been to use one thing to depict another. Thus an apparently human ear on an appare ntly human face might turn out to be a bird’s wing. Likewise an or nate crown might be composed of alternate fishes’ and condors’ heads, an eyebrow a bird’s neck and head, the toe of a slipper an animal’s head, and so on. Members of the elephant family formed out of condors’ heads, therefore, need not necessarily be optical illusions; on the contrary, such inventive composites would be perfectly in keeping with the overall artistic character of the frieze. Among the riot of stylized animal figures carved into the Gateway of the Sun were a number of other extinct species as well. I knew from my research that one of these had been convincingly identified by several observers as Toxodon 22 —a three-toed amphibious mammal about nine feet long and five feet high at the shoulder, resembling a short, stubby cross between a rhino and a hippo. 23 Like Cuvieronius, Toxodon had flourished in South America in the la te Pliocene (1.6 million years ago) and had died out at the end of the Pleistocene, about 12,000 years ago. 24   21 Ibid. 22 See The Calendar of Tiahuanaco, p. 47.

Vast harbour constructions, piers and dykes (and even dumped cargoes of quarried stone at points beneath the old waterline), leave no doubt that this must have been the case. 1 Indeed, according to the unorthodox estimates of Professor Posnansky, Tiahuanaco had been in active use as a port as early as 15,000 BC , the date he proposed for the construction of the Kalasasaya, and had continued to serve as such for approximately another five thousand years, during which great expanse of time its position in relation to the shore of Lake Titicaca hardly changed. 2 Throughout this epoch the principa l harbour of the port city was located several hundred metres south-west of the Kalasasaya at a site now known as Puma Punku (literally, the Puma Gate). Here Posnansky’s excavations revealed two artificially dredged docks on either side of: ‘a true and magnificent pier or wharf .. . where hundreds of ships could at the same time take on and unload their heavy burdens’. 3 One of the construction blocks from which the pier had been fashioned still lay on site and weighed an estimated 440 tons . 4 Numerous others weighed between 100 and 150 tons. 5 Furthermore, many of the biggest monoliths had clearly been joined to each other by I-shaped metal clamps.

Even according to orthodox historical chronology these crosses were not less than 1500 years old. In other words, they had been carved here, by a people with absolutely no knowledge of Christianity, a full millennium before the arrival of the first Spanish missionaries on the Altiplano. Where, come to that, had the Christians obtained their crosses? Not only from the shape of the structure to which Jesus Christ was nailed, I thought, but from some much older source as well. Hadn’t the Ancient Egyptians, for example, used a hieroglyph very like a cross (the ankh, or crux ansata ) to symbolize life ... the breath of life ... eternal life itself? 8 Had that symbol originated in Egypt, or had it perhaps occurred elsewhere, earlier still?

Dozens and dozens of hulking blocks lay scattered in all directions, tossed like matchsticks, Posnansky argued, in the terrible natural disaster that had overtaken Tiahuanaco during the eleventh millennium BC : This catastrophe was caused by seismic movements which resulted in an overflow of the waters of Lake Titicaca and in volcan ic eruptions ...

Thereafter, though the flood waters subsided, ‘the culture of the Altiplano did not again attain a high point of development but fell rather into a total and definitive decadence’. 12 Struggle and abandonment This process was hastened by the fa ct that the earthquakes which had caused Lake Titicaca to engulf Tiah uanaco were only the first of many upheavals in the area. These initially resulted in the lake swelling and overflowing its banks but they soon began to have the opposite effect, slowly reducing Titicaca’s depth and surface area. As the years passed, the lake continued to drain inch by inch, marooning the great city, remorselessly separating it from the waters which had previously played such a vital role in its economic life.

Finally there ensued mass emigrations of the Andean peoples towards locations where the struggle for life would not be so arduous.’ 16 It seems that the highly civiliz ed inhabitants of Tiahuanaco, remembered in local trad itions as ‘the Viracocha people’, had not gone without a struggle. There was puzzling evidence from all over the Altiplano that agricultural experiments of an advanced and scientific nature had been carried out, with great ingenuity and dedication, to try to compensate for the deterioration of the climate. For example, recent research has demonstrated that astonishingly sophisticated analyses of the chemical compositions of many poisonous high-altitude plants and tubers had been undertaken by somebody in this region in the furthest antiquity. Such analyses, furthermore, had been coupled with the invention of detoxification tec hniques which had rendered these otherwise nutritious vegetables harmless and edible. 17 There was as yet ‘no satisfactory explanation for the development of these detoxification processes’, admitted David Brow-man, associate professor of Anthropology at Washington University. 18  14 Quoted in Earth in Upheaval, citing Sir Clemens Markham, pp. 75-6. 15 Tiahuanacu, III, p. 147. 16 Ibid. 17 David L. Browman, ‘New Light on Andean Tiahuanaco’, in American Scientist, volume 69, 1981, pp. 410-12. 18 Ibid., p. 410. According to Browman: ‘Plant domestication in the Altiplano required the simultaneous development of detoxifying techniques. The majority of the plants [which were in regular use in ancient Tiahuanaco] contain significant levels of toxins in an untreated state. For example, the potato species that are most resistant to frost and that grow best at high altitudes also contain the highest levels of glycoalkaloid solanine. In addition, the potato contains an inhibitor for a wide range of digestive enzymes necessary for breaking down proteins—a particularly unfortunate trait at high altitudes where differential partial oxygen pressure already impairs the chemistry of protein breakdown ...’ The detoxification technique developed at Tiahuanaco to make these potatoes edible also had a preservative effect. Indeed, each of these two important qualities was a by- product of the other. ‘Altiplano farmers’, ex plains Browman, ‘have, for several thousand years produced the freeze-dried potato, or ch’uno, by a process of freezing, leaching, and sun drying. The initial explanation for this process was that it produced a food product that could be stored fo r long periods of time ... six years or more ... But we can now suggest another rationale. Leaching and sun-drying are necessary to remove the majority of the solanine and to lower excessive nitrate levels, and the subsequent cooking of freeze-dried products destroys th e inhibitors of digestive enzymes. Rather than arguing that freeze-drying was motivated only by a desire to produce a secure food base, one could hold that this technology was mandatory to make the potato available"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 96 Likewise, in the same ancient period, somebody as yet unidentified by scholarship went to great lengths to build raised fields on the newly exposed lands that had so recently been under the waters of the lake—a procedure which created characteristic corrugated strips of alternately high and low ground. It was not until the 1960s that the original function of these undulating patterns of earthen platforms and shallow canals was correctly worked out. Still visible today, and known as waru waaru by the local Indians, they proved to be pa rt of a complex agricultural design, perfected in prehistoric times, wh ich had the ability ‘to out-perform modern farming techniques’. 19 In recent years some of the rais ed fields were reconstructed by archaeologists and agronomists. These experimental plots consistently yielded three times more potatoes than even the most productive conventional plots. Likewise, during on e particularly cold spell, a severe frost ‘did little damage to the experimental fields’. The following year the crops on the elevated platforms surv ived an equally ruinous drought: ‘then later rode high and dry thro ugh a flood that swamped surrounding farmlands’. Indeed this simple but effective agricultural technique, invented by a culture so ancient that no one today could even remember its name, had proved such a success in rural Bolivia that it had attracted     as a usable nutritive source.

It also appears to have created a climate that both extended the high-altitude growing season and helped crops survive hard times. During the area’s frequent periods of drought, for example, the canals provided vital moisture, while the higher level of the platforms raised plants above the worst effects of the region’s frequent floods. Moreover the canal water may have acted as a kind of thermal storage battery absorbing the sun’s heat during the day and radiating it back into the freezing night, to create a blanket of relatively warm air over the growing plants.’ Feats and Wisdom of the Ancients, pp. 56-7."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 97 the attention of governmental and international development agencies and was now under test in several other parts of the world as well. 20 An artificial language Another possible legacy of Tiahua naco, and of the Viracochas, lay embedded in the language spoken by the local Aymara Indians—a language regarded by some specialists as the oldest in the world. 21 In the 1980s Ivan Guzman de Rojas, a Bolivian computer scientist, accidentally demonstrated that Aymara might be not only very ancient but, significantly, that it might be a ‘made-up’ language—something deliberately and skillfully designed. Of particular note was the seemingly artificial character of its syntax, which was rigidly structured and unambiguous to an extent thought inconceivable in normal ‘organic’ speech. 22 This synthetic and highly or ganized structure meant that Aymara could easily be transformed into a computer algorithm to be used to translate one language into another: ‘The Aymara Algorithm is used as a bridge language. The language of an original document is translated into Aymara and then into any number of other languages.’ 23 Was it just coincidence that an apparently artificial language governed by a computer-friendly syntax should be spoken today in the environs of Tiahuanaco? Or could Aymara be a legacy of the high learning that legend attributed to the Viracochas? If so, what other legacies might there be? What other incomplete fragments of an old and forgotten wisdom might be lying scattered around—fragments which had perhaps contributed to the richness and diversity of many of th e cultures that had evolved in this region during the 10,000 years before the conquest?

Had it done so, I calculated, it would have stood about eight feet tall. Even reclining, coiled and tightly sprung, it seemed to overflow with a fierce and pitiless energy.

Four of them took hold of his arms and legs, spreading them out.

The Olmecs are the earliest recognized high civilization of Ancient Mexico, and human sacrifice was well established with them. Two and a half thousand years later, at the time of the Spanish conquest, the Aztecs were the last (but by no means the least) of the peoples of this region to continue an extremely old and deeply ingrained tradition. They did so with fanatical zeal. It is recorded, for example, that Ahuitzotl, the eighth and most powerful emperor of the Aztec royal dynasty, ‘celebrated the dedication of the temple of Huitzilopochtli in Tenochitlan by marshalling four lines of prisoners past teams of priests who worked four days to dispatch them. On this occasion as many as 80,000 were slain during a single ceremonial rite.’ 4 The Aztecs liked to dress up in the flayed skins of sacrificial victims. Bernardino de Sahagun, a Spanis h missionary, attended one such ceremony soon after the conquest: The celebrants flayed and dismembered the captives; they then lubricated their own naked bodies with grease and slipped into the skin ... Trailing blood and grease, the gruesomely clad men ran through the city, thus terrifying those they followed ... The second-day’s rite also incl uded a cannibal feast for each warrior’s family. 5 Another mass sacrifice was witnessed by the Spanish chronicler Diego de Duran. In this instance the victims were so numerous that when the streams of blood running down the temple steps ‘reached bottom and cooled they formed fat clots, enough to terrify anyone’. 6 All in all, it has been estimated that the number of sacrificial victims in the Aztec empire as a whole had risen to around 250,0 00 a year by the beginning of the sixteenth century. 7 What was this manic destruction of human life for? According to the Aztecs themselves, it was done to delay the coming of the end of the world. 8  4 Joyce Milton, Robert A.

And it is within that same Fifth Sun, or epoch, that humank ind still lives today.

The mountains disappeared and men were transformed into fish.’ 10 The symbol of the Fifth Sun, our current epoch, is the face of Tonatiuh, the sun god himself. His tongue, fittin gly depicted as an obsidian knife, juts out hungrily, signalling his need for the nourishment of human blood and hearts. His features are wrinkled to indicate his advanced age and he appears within the symbol Ollin which signifies Movement. 11 Why is the Fifth Sun known as ‘The Sun of Movement’? Because, ‘the elders say: in it there will be a movement of the earth and from this we shall all perish.’ 12 And when will this catastrophe st rike? Soon, according to the Aztec priests. They believed that the Fifth Sun was already very old and approaching the end of its cycle (hence the wrinkles on the face of Tonatiuh). Ancient meso-American traditions dated the birth of this epoch to a remote period corresponding to the fourth millennium BC of the Christian calendar. 13 The method of calculating its end, however, had been forgotten by the time of Aztecs. 14 In the absence of this essential information, human sacrifices were apparently carried out in the hope that the impending catastrophe might be postponed. Indeed, the Aztecs came to regard themselves as a chos en people; they were convinced that they had been charged with a divine mission to wage war and offer the blood of their captives to feed Tonati uh, thereby preserving the life of the Fifth Sun. 15 Stuart Fiedel, an authority on the prehistory of the Americas, summed up the whole issue in these words: ‘The Aztecs believed that to prevent the destruction of the universe, which had already occurred four times in the past, the gods must be supplied wi th a steady diet of human hearts and blood.’ 16 This same belief, with remarkably few variations, was shared by all the great civilizations of Central America. Unlike the Aztecs, however, some of the ear lier peoples had calculated exactly when a great movement of the earth could be expe cted to bring the Fifth Sun to an end.  10 Eric S.

But the Mayas, justifiably regarded as the greatest ancient civilization to have arisen in the New World, left behind a wealth of calendrical records. Expressed in terms of the modern dating system, these enigmatic inscriptions convey a rather curious message: the Fifth Sun, it seems, is going to co me to an end on 23 December, AD 2012. 17 In the rational intellectual climate of the late twentieth century it is unfashionable to take doomsday prophecies seriously. The general consensus is that they are the products of superstitious minds and can safely be ignored. As I travelled arou nd Mexico, however, I was from time to time bothered by a nagging intuition that the voices of the ancient sages might deserve a hearing after all. I mean, suppose by some crazy offchance they weren’t the superstitious savages we’d always believed them to be. Suppose they knew something we didn’t? Most pertinent of all, suppose that their projected date for the end of the Fifth Sun turned out to be correct? Suppose, in other words, that some truly awful geological catastrophe is already unfo lding, deep in the bowels of the earth, as the wise men of the Maya predicted? In Peru and Bolivia I had become aw are of the obsessive concern with the calculation of time shown by the Incas and their predecessors. Now, in Mexico, I discovered that the Maya, who believed that they had worked out the date of the end of the worl d, had been possessed by the same compulsion. Indeed, for these people, just about everything boiled down to numbers, the passage of the years and the manifestations of events. The belief was that if the numbers which lay beneath the manifestations could be properly underst ood, it would be possible to predict successfully the timing of the events themselves. 18 I felt disinclined to ignore the obvious implications of the recurrent destructions of humanity depicted so vividly in the Central American traditions. Coming complete with giants and floods, these traditions were eerily similar to those of the far- off Andean region. Meanwhile, however, I was keen to pursue another, related line of inquiry. This concerned the bearded white-skinned deity named Quetzalcoatl, who was believed to have sailed to Mexico from across the seas in remote antiquity. Quetzalcoatl was credited with the invention of the advanced mathematical and calend rical formulae that the Maya were later to use to calculate the date of doomsday. 19 He also bore a striking  17 Professor Michael D.

For example, one pre-Colombian myth collected in Mexico by the sixteenth-century Spanish chronicler Juan de Torquemada asserted that Quetzalcoatl was ‘a fair and ruddy co mplexioned man with a long beard’. Another spoke of him as, ‘ era Hombre blanco; a large man, broad browed, with huge eyes, long hair, and a great, rounded beard— la barba grande y redonda .’ 1 Another still described him as a mysterious person ... a white man with strong formation of body, broad forehead, large eyes, and a flowing beard. He was dressed in a long, white robe reaching to his feet. He condemned sacrif ices, except of fruits and flowers, and was known as the god of peace ... When ad dressed on the subject of war he is reported to have stopped up his ears with his fingers. 2 According to a particularly striking Ce ntral American tradition, this ‘wise instructor ...’ came from across the sea in a boat that moved by itself without paddles. He was a tall, bearded white man who taught people to use fire for cooking. He also built houses and showed couples that they could live together as husband and wife; and since people often quarreled in those days, he taught them to live in peace. 3 Viracocha’s Mexican twin The reader will recall that Viracocha, in his journeys through the Andes, went by several different aliases. Quet zalcoatl did this too. In some parts of Central America (notably among the Quiche Maya) he was called Gucumatz. Elsewhere, at Chichen Itza for example, he was known as Kukulkan. When both these words were translated into English, they turned out to mean exactly the same thing: Plumed (or Feathered) Serpent. This, also, was the meaning of Quetzalcoatl. 4 There were other deities, among the Maya in particular, whose  1 Juan de Torquemada, Monarchichia indiana, volume I, cited in Fair Gods and Stone Faces, pp. 37-8. 2 North America of Antiquity, p. 268, cited in Atlantis: The Antediluvian World, p. 165. 3 The Mythology of Mexico and Central America, p. 161. 4 See Nigel Davis, The Ancient Kingdoms of Mexico, Penguin Books, London, 1990, p. 152; The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya, pp. 141-2."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 108 identities seemed to merge closely with those of Quetzalcoatl. One was Votan, a great civilizer, who was also described as pale-skinned, bearded and wearing a long robe. Scholars could offer no translation for his name but his principal symbol, like that of Quetzalcoatl, was a serpent. 5 Another closely related figure was Itzamana, the Mayan god of healing, who was a robed and bearded individual; his symbol, too, was the rattlesnake. 6 What emerged from all this, as the leading authorities agreed, was that the Mexican legends collected and pa ssed on by Spanish chroniclers at the time of the conquest were often the confused and conflated products of extremely long oral traditions. Be hind them all, however, it seemed that there must lie some solid historical reality. In the judgement of Sylvanus Griswold Morley, th e doyen of Maya studies: The great god Kukulkan, or Feathered Serpent, was the Mayan counterpart of the Aztec Quetzalcoatl, the Mexican god of light, learning and culture. In the Maya pantheon he was regarded as having been the great organizer, the founder of cities, the former of laws and the teacher of the calendar. Indeed his attributes and life history are so human that it is not improbable that he may have been an actual historical character, some great lawgiver and organizer, the memory of whose benefactions lingered long after death, and whose personality was eventually deified. 7 All the legends stated unambiguously that Quetzalcoatl/Kukulkan/Gucumatz/Votan/Itzamana had arrived in Central America from somewhere very far away (across the ‘Eastern Sea’) and that amid great sadness he had eventually sailed off again in the direction whence he had come. 8 The legends added that he had promised solemnly that he would return one day 9 —a clear echo of Viracocha it would be almost perverse to ascribe to coincidence. In addition, it will be recalled that Viracocha’s departure across th e waves of the Pacific Ocean had been portrayed in the Andean trad itions as a miraculous event. Quetzalcoatl’s departure from Mexico also had a strange feel about it: he was said to have sailed aw ay ‘on a raft of serpents’. 10 All in all, I felt Morley was right in looking for a factual historical background behind the Mayan and Me xican myths. What the traditions seemed to indicate was that the bearded pale-skinned foreigner called Quetzalcoatl (or Kukulkan or whatever ) had been not just one person but probably several people who had co me from the same place and had belonged to the same distinctively non-Indian ethnic type (bearded, white-skinned, etc.).

Quetzalcoatl/Kukulkan/Itzamana was quite explicitly portrayed in many of the Mexican and Mayan accounts as having been accompanied by ‘attendants’ or ‘assistants’. Certain myths set out in the Ancient Mayan religious texts known as the Books of Chilam Balam, for instance, reported that ‘the first inhabitants of Yucatan were the “People of the Serpent”. They came from the east in boats across the water with their leader Itzamana, “Serpent of the East”, a healer who could cure by laying on hands, and who revived the dead.’ 12 ‘Kukulkan,’ stated another tradition, ‘came with nineteen companions, two of whom were gods offish, two ot hers gods of agriculture, and a god of thunder ...

Kukulkan instructed the people in the arts of peace, and caused various important edifices to be built ...’ 14 Meanwhile Juan de Torquemada recorded this very specific pre- conquest tradition concerning the imposing strangers who had entered Mexico with Quetzalcoatl: They were men of good carriage, well-dressed, in long robes of black linen, open in front, and without capes, cut low at the neck, with short sleeves that did not come to the elbow ... These followers of Quetzalcoatl were men of great knowledge and cunning artists in all kinds of fine work. 15 Like some long-lost twin of Viracocha, the white and bearded Andean deity, Quetzalcoatl was depicted as having brought to Mexico all the skills and sciences necessary to create a civilized life, thus ushering in a golden age. 16 He was believed, for example, to have introduced the knowledge of writing to Central America, to have invented the calendar, and to have been a master builder who taught the people the secrets of  11 Not only obviously related but specifically related.

He was the father of mathematics, metallurgy, and astronomy and was said to have ‘measured the earth’. He also founded productive agriculture, and was reported to have discovered and introduced corn—literally the staff of life in these ancient lands. A great doctor and master of medicines, he was the patron of healers and diviners ‘and disclosed to the people the mysteries of the properties of plants’. In addition, he was revered as a lawgiver, as a protector of craftsmen, and as a patron of all the arts. As might be expected of such a re fined and cultured individual he forbade the grisly practice of human sacrifice during the period of his ascendancy in Mexico. After his departure the blood-spattered rituals were reintroduced with a vengeance. Nevertheless, even the Aztecs, the most vehement sacrificers ever to have existed in the long history of Central America, remembered ‘the time of Quetzalcoatl’ with a kind of nostalgia. ‘He was a teacher,’ recalled one legend, ‘who taught that no living thing was to be harmed and that sacrifices were to be made not of human beings but of birds and butterflies. 17 Cosmic struggle Why did Quetzalcoatl go away? What went wrong? Mexican legends provided answers to these questions. They said that the enlightened and benevolent rule of the Plumed Serpent had been brought to an end by Tezcatilpoca, a malevolent god whose name meant ‘Smoking Mirror’ and whose cult demanded human sacrifice. It seemed that a near-cosmic struggle between th e forces of light and darkness had taken place in Ancient Mexico, and that the forces of darkness had triumphed ... The supposed stage for these events, now known as Tula, was not believed to be particularly old—not much more than 1000 years anyway— but the legends surrounding it linked it to an infinitely more distant epoch.

Ahead and, to my left lay the partially unexcavated Pyramid C, a cactus-covered mound about 40 feet high, and farther away were more mounds not yet investigated by archaeologists. To my right was a ball court. In that long, I-shaped arena, terrible gladitorial games had been staged in ancient times. Teams, or sometimes just two individuals pitted against each other, would compete for possession of a rubber ball; the losers were decapitated. The idols on the platform behind me had a solemn and intimidating aura. I stood up to look at them mo re closely. Their sculptor had given them hard, implacable faces, hooked noses and hollow eyes and they seemed without sympathy or emotion. What interested me most, however, was not so much their feroci ous appearance as the objects that they clutched in their hands.

Santha Faiia’s photographs will help the reader to form his or her own impression of these peculiar objects. As I studied the objects themselves I had the distinct sense that they were meant to represent devices which had originally been made out of me tal. The right-hand device, which seemed to emerge from a sheath or hand-guard, was lozenge-shaped with a curved lower edge. The left-hand device could have been an instrument or weapon of some kind. I remembered legends which related that the gods of ancient Mexico had armed themselves with xiuhcoatl, ‘fire serpents’. 19 These apparently emitted burning rays capable of piercing and dismembering human bodies. 20 Was it ‘fire serpents’ that the Tu la idols were holding? What, for that matter, were fire serpents? Whatever they were, both devices looked like pieces of technology. And both in certain ways resembled the equally mysterious objects in the hands of the idols in the Kalasasaya at Tiahuanaco. Serpent Sanctuary Santha and I had come to Tula/Tollan because it had been closely associated both with Quetzalcoatl and with his arch-enemy Tezcatilpoca, the Smoking Mirror. 21 Ever-young, omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient, Tezcatilpoca was associated in the legends with night, darkness and the sacred jaguar. 22 He was ‘invisible and implacable, appearing to men sometimes as a flying shadow, sometimes as a dreadful monster’. 23 Often depicted as a glaring skull, he was said to have been the owner of a mysterious object, the Smoking Mirror after which he was named, which he made use of to observe from afar the activities of men and gods. Scholars quite reasonably suppose that it must have been a primitive obsidian scrying stone: ‘O bsidian had an especial sanctity for the Mexicans, as it provided the sacrificial knives employed by the priests ... Bernal Diaz [Spanish chronicler] st ates that they called this stone “Tezcat”. From it mirrors were also manufactured as divinatory media to be used by wizards.’ 24 Representing the forces of darkness and rapacious evil, Tezcatilpoca was said in the legends to have been locked in a conflict with  18 Mexico, pp. 194-5. 19 The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya, pp. 185, 188-9. 20 Ibid. 21 New Larousse Encyclopaedia of Mythology, p. 437. 22 The Feathered Serpent and the Cross, pp. 52-3. 23 New Larousse Encyclopaedia of Mythology, p. 436. 24 The Magic and Mysteries of Mexico, p. 51."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 113 Quetzalcoatl that had continued over an immense span of years. 25 At certain times one seemed to be gaining the upper hand, at certain times the other.

As we have seen, Quetzalcoatl was believed to have fled to the coast and to have been carried away on a raft of serpents. One legend says, ‘He burned his houses, built of silver an d shells, buried his treasure, and set sail on the Eastern Sea preceded by his attendants who had been changed into bright birds.’ 27 This poignant moment of departure was supposedly staged at a place called Coatzecoalcos, meaning ‘Serpent Sanctuary’. 28 There, before taking his leave, Quetzalcoatl promised his followers he would return one day to overthrow the cult of Tezcatilpoca and to inaugurate an era when the gods would again ‘accept sacrifices of flowers’ and cease their clamour for human blood. 29  25 World Mythology, p. 237. 26 New Larousse Encyclopaedia of Mythology, p. 437. 27 Ibid. 28 Fair Gods and Stone Faces, pp. 139-40. 29 The Feathered Serpent and the Cross, pp. 35, 66."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 114 Chapter 15 Mexican Babel We drove south-east from Tula, by-pa ssing Mexico City on an anarchic series of fast freeways that dragged us through the creeping edge of the capital’s eye-watering, lung-searing pollution. Our route then took us up over pine-covered mountains, past the snowy peak of Popocatepetl and thence along tree-lined lanes amid fields and farmsteads. In the late afternoon we arrived at Cholula, a sleepy town with 11,000 inhabitants and a spacious main squa re. After turning east through the narrow streets, we crossed a railway line and pulled to a halt in the shadow of tlahchiualtepetl, the ‘man-made mountain’ we had come here to see. Once sacred to the peaceful cult of Quetzalcoatl, but now surmounted by an ornate Catholic church, this immense edifice was ranked among the most extensive and ambitious engineering projects ever undertaken anywhere in the ancient world. Indeed, with a base area of 45 acres and a height of 210 feet, it was three times more massive than the Great Pyramid of Egypt. 1 Though its contours were now blurred by age and its sides overgrown with grass, it was st ill possible to recognize that it had once been an imposing ziggurat wh ich had risen up towards the heavens in four clean-angled ‘steps’. Measurin g almost half a kilometre along each side at its base, it had also succe eded in preserving a dignified but violated beauty. The past, though often dry and dusty, is rarely dumb. Sometimes it can speak with passion. It seemed to me that it did so here, bearing witness to the physical and psychological degradation visited upon the native peoples of Mexico when the Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortez almost casually ‘beheaded a culture as a passer-by might sweep off the head of a sunflower’. 2 In Cholula, a great centre of pilgrimage with a population of around 100,000 at the time of the conquest, this decapitation of ancient traditions and ways of life required that something particularly humiliating be done to the man-made mountain of Quetzalcoatl. The solution was to smash and desecrate the temple which had once stood on the summit of the ziggurat and replace it with a church. Cortez and his men were few, the Cholulans were many. When they marched into town, however, the Spaniards had one major advantage: bearded and pale-skinned, dressed in shining armour, they looked like the fulfillment of a prophecy—had it not always been promised that  1 Figures from Fair Gods and Stone Faces, p. 56. 2 Ibid., p. 12."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 115 Quetzalcoatl, the Plumed Serpent, would return ‘from across the Eastern Sea’ with his band of followers? 3 Because of this expectation, the na ive and trusting Cholulans permitted the conquistadores to climb the steps of the ziggurat and enter the great courtyard of the temple. There troupes of gaily bedecked dancing girls greeted them, singing and playing on instruments, while stewards moved back and forth with heaped platters of bread and delicate cooked meats. One of the Spanish chroniclers, an eyewitness to the events that followed, reported that adoring town sfolk of all ranks ‘unarmed, with eager and happy faces, crowded in to hear what the white men would say’. Realizing from this incredible reception that their intentions were not suspected, the Spaniards closed and guarded all the entrances, drew their weapons of steel and murdered their hosts. 4 Six thousand died in this horrible massacre 5 which matched, in its savagery, the most bloodstained rituals of the Aztecs: ‘Those of Cholula were caught unawares. With neither arrows nor shields did they meet the Spaniards. Just so they were slain without warning. They were killed by pure treachery.’ 6 It was ironic, I thought, that the conquistadores in both Peru and Mexico should have benefited in th e same way from local legends that prophesied the return of a pale, bear ded god. If that god was indeed a deified human, as seemed likely, he must have been a person of high civilization and exemplary character—or more probably two different people from the same background, on e working in Mexico and providing the model for Quetzalcoatl, the ot her in Peru being the model for Viracocha.

The stone was so transparent that it shone from its interior with the brightness of a candle flame. It was a very old jewel, and there is no tradition extant concerning the origin of its veneration and worship. 7 What might we learn if we could examine this ‘very old’ jewel today? And how old was it really? We shall never find out because Fr. Benito, the first missionary of Achiotlan, seized the stone from the Indians: ‘He had it ground up, although a Spaniard offered three thousand ducats for it, stirred the powder in water, poured it upon the earth and trod upon it ...’ 8 Equally typical of the profligate sq uandering of the intellectual riches concealed in the Mexican past was the shared fate of two gifts given to Cortez by the Aztec emperor Montezuma. These were circular calendars, as big as cartwheels, one of solid silver, and the other of solid gold. Both were elaborately engraved with beautiful hieroglyphs which may have contained material of great interest. Cortez had them melted down for ingots on the spot. 9 More systematically, all over Central America, vast repositories of knowledge accumulated since ancient times were painstakingly gathered, heaped up and burned by zealous friars . In July 1562, for example, in the main square of Mani (just south of modern Merida in Yucatan Province) Fr. Diego de Landa burned thousands of Maya codices, story paintings and hieroglyphs inscribed on rolled-up deer skins. He also destroyed countless ‘idols’ and ‘altars’, all of which he described as ‘works of the devil, designed by the evil one to de lude the Indians and to prevent them from accepting Christianity ...’ 10 Elsewhere he elaborated on the same theme: We found great numbers of books [written in the characters of the Indians] but as they contained nothing but superstitions and falsehoods of the devil we burned them all, which the natives took most grievously, and which gave them great pain. 11 Not only the ‘natives’ should have felt this pain but anyone and everyone—then and now—who would li ke to know the truth about the past.

Notable among these was Juan de Zumarraga, Bishop of Mexico, who boasted of having destroyed 20,000 idols and 500 Indian temples. In November 1530 he burned a Christianized Aztec aristocrat at the st ake for having allegedly reverted to worship of the ‘rain-god’ and later, in the market-place at Texcoco, built a vast bonfire of astronomical docu ments, paintings, manuscripts and hieroglyphic texts which the conquistadores had forcibly extracted from the Aztecs during the previous eleven years. 12 As this irreplaceable storehouse of knowledge and history went up in flames, a chance to shake off at least some of the co llective amnesia th at clouds our understanding was lost to mankind for ever. What remains to us of the written records of the ancient peoples of Central America? The answer, thanks to the Spanish, is less than twenty original codices and scrolls. 13 We know from hearsay that many of the documents which the friars reduced to ashes contained ‘records of ages past’. 14 What did those lost records say? what secrets did they hold? Gigantic men of deformed stature Even while the orgy of book-burning was still going on, some Spaniards began to realize that ‘a truly great ci vilization had once existed in Mexico prior to the Aztecs’. 15 Oddly enough, one of th e first to act on this realization was Diego de Landa. He appears to have undergone ‘Damascus-road experience’ after staging his auto-da-fé at Mani. In later years, determined to save what he could of the ancient wisdom he had once played such a large part in destroying, he became an assiduous gatherer of the traditions and oral hi stories of the native peoples of the Yucatan. 16 Bernardino de Sahagun, a Franciscan friar, was a chronicler to whom we owe much. A great linguist, he is reported to have ‘sought out the most learned and often the oldest natives, and asked each to paint in his Aztec picture writing as much as he could clearly remember of Aztec history, religion and legend’. 17 In this way Sahagun was able to accumulate detailed information on the anthropo logy, mythology and social history of ancient Mexico, which he later se t down in a learned twelve-volume work.

He visited Cholula in AD 1585, a time of rapid and catastrophic change. There he interviewed a venerated elder of the town, said to have been more than one hundred years old, who told him this story about the making of the great ziggurat: In the beginning, before the light of the sun had been created, this place, Cholula, was in obscurity and darkness; all was a plain, without hill or elevation, encircled in every part by water, without tree or created thing. Immediately after the light and the sun arose in the east there appeared gigantic men of deformed stature who possessed the land. Enamoured of the light and beauty of the sun they determined to build a tower so high that its summit should reach the sky. Having collected materials for the purpose they found a very adhesive clay and bitumen with which they speedily commenced to build the tower ... And having reared it to the greatest possible altitude, so that it reached the sky, the Lord of the Heavens, enraged, said to the inhabitants of the sky, ‘Have you observed how they of the earth have built a high and haughty tower to mount hither, being enamoured of the light of the sun and his beauty? Come and confound them, because it is not right that they of the earth, living in the flesh, should mingle with us.’ Immediately the inhabitants of the sky sallied forth like flashes of lightning; they destroyed the edifice and divided and scattered its builders to all parts of the earth. 18 It was this story, almost but not quite the biblical account of the Tower of Babel (which was itself a rework ing of a far older Mesopotamian tradition), that had brought me to Cholula. The Central American and Middle Eastern tales were obviously closely related. Indeed, the similarities were unmissable, but there were also differences far too significant to be ignored. Of course, the similarities could be due to unrecorded pre-Colombian contacts between the cultures of the Middle East and the New World, but there was one way to explain the similarities and the differences in a single theory. Suppose that the two versions of the legend had evol ved separately for several thousands of years, but prior to that both had descended from the same remotely ancient ancestor? Remnants Here’s what the Book of Genesis says about the ‘tower that reached to heaven’: Throughout the earth men spoke the same language, with the same vocabulary. Now as they moved eastwards they found a plain in the land of Shinar, where they settled. There they said to one another, ‘Come, let us make bricks and bake them in the fire.’ For stone they Used bricks and for mortar they used bitumen. ‘Come,’ they said, ‘let us build ourselves a town and a tower with its top reaching heaven. Let us make a name for ourselves, so that we may not be scattered about the  18 Diego de Duran, ‘Historia antiqua de la Nueve Espana’, (1585), in Ignatius Donelly, Atlantis: The Antediluvian World, p. 200."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 119 entire earth.’ Now Yahewh [the Hebrew God] came down to see the town and the tower that the sons of man had built. ‘So they are all a single people with a single language!’ said Yahweh. ‘This is but the start of their undertakings! There will be nothing too hard for them to do. Come, let us go down and confuse their language on the spot so that they can no longer understand one another.’ Yahweh scattered them thence over the whole face of the earth, and they stopped building the tower. It was named Babel, therefore, because there Yahweh confused the language of the whole earth. It was from there that Yahweh scattered them over the whole face of the earth. 19 The verse which most interested me suggested very clearly that the ancient builders of the Tower of Babel had set out to create a lasting monument to themselves so that their name would not be forgotten— even if their civilization and language were. Was it possible that the same considerations could have applied at Cholula? Only a handful of monuments in Mexi co were thought by archaeologists to be more than 2000 years old. Ch olula was definitely one of them. Indeed no one could say for sure in what distant age its ramparts had first begun to be heaped up. For thousands of years before development and extension of the site began in earnest around 300 BC , it looked as though some other, older structure might have been positioned at the spot over which the great ziggurat of Quetzalcoatl now rose. There was a precedent for this which further strengthened the intriguing possibility that the remn ants of a truly ancient civilization might still be lying around in Centra l America waiting to be recognized. For example, just south of the university campus of Mexico City, off the main road connecting the capital to Cuernavaca, stands a circular step pyramid of great complexity (with four galleries and a central staircase). It was partially excavated in the 1920s from beneath a mantle of lava. Geologists were called to the site to help date the lava, and carried out a detailed examination. To everyone’s surprise, they concluded that the volcanic eruption which had completely buried three sides of this pyramid (and had then gone on to cover about sixty square miles of the surrounding territory) mu st have taken place at least seven thousand years ago . 20 This geological evidence seems to have been ignored by historians and archaeologists, who do not believe that any civilization capable of building a pyramid could ha ve existed in Mexico at such an early date. It is worth noting, however, that Byron Cummings, the American archaeologist who originally excavated the site for the National Geographical Society, was convinced by clearly demarcated stratification  19 Genesis 11:1-9. 20 Reported in Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings, p. 199.

He went further than the geologists and stated categorically that this temple ‘fell into ruins some 8500 years ago’. 21 Pyramids upon pyramids Going inside the Cholula pyramid really did feel like entering a man-made mountain. The tunnels (and there were more than six miles of them) were not old: they had been left behind by the teams of archaeologists who had burrowed here diligently from 1931 until funds ran out in 1966. Somehow, these narrow, low-ceilinged corridors had borrowed an atmosphere of antiquity from the va st structure all around them. Moist and cool, they offered an inviting and secretive darkness. Following a ribbon of torchlight we walked deeper inside the pyramid. The archaeological excavations had revealed that it was not the product of one dynasty (as was thought to have been the case with the pyramids at Giza in Egypt), but that it had been built up over a very long period of time—two thousand years or so, at a conservative estimate. In other words it was a collective project, crea ted by an inter-generational labour force drawn from the many different cultures, Olmec, Teotihuacan, Toltec, Zapotec, Mixtec, Cholulan and Aztec, that had passed through Cholula since the dawn of civilization in Mexico. 22 Though it was not known who had been the first builders here, as far as it had been possible to establish the earliest major edifice on the site consisted of a tall conical pyramid, shaped like an upturned bucket, flattened at the summit where a temple had stood. Much later a second, similar structure was imposed on top of this primordial mound, i.e. a second inverted bucket of clay, and compacted stone was placed directly over the first, raising the temple platform to more than 200 feet above the surrounding plain. Thereafter, du ring the next fifteen hundred years or so, an estimated four or five other cultures contributed to the final appearance of the monument. This th ey did by extending its base in several stages, but never again by incr easing its maximum height. In this way, almost as though a master plan were being implemented, the man- made mountain of Cholul a gradually attained its characteristic, four-tier ziggurat shape. Today, its sides at the base are each almost 1500 feet long—about twice the length of the sides of the Great Pyramid at Giza— and its total volume has been estima ted at a staggeri ng three million  21 Byron S.

Walking through the network of corri dors and passageways, inhaling the cool, loamy air, I was uncomfortably conscious of the great weight and mass of the pyramid pressing down upon me. It was the largest building in the world and it had been placed here in honour of a Central American deity of whom almost nothing was known. We had the conquistadores and the Catholic Church to thank for leaving us so deeply in the dark about the true story of Quetzalcoatl and his followers. The smashing and desecratio n of his ancient temple at Cholula, the destruction of idols, altars and calendars, and the great bonfires made out of codices, paintings and hieroglyphic scrolls, had succeeded almost completely in silencing the vo ices of the past.

We were heading into the heartlands of Mexico’s olde st and most mysterious civilization: that of the so-called Olmecs, whose name meant ‘rubber people’. Dating back to the second millennium BC , the Olmecs had ceased to exist fifteen hundred years before the rise of the Aztec empire. The Aztecs, however, had preserved haunti ng traditions concerning them and were even responsible for naming th em after the rubber-producing area of Mexico’s gulf coast where they were believed to have lived. 1 This area lies between modern Veracruz in the west and Ciudad del Carmen in the east. In it the Aztecs found a number of ancient ritual objects produced by the Olmecs and for reasons unknown they collected these objects and placed them in positions of importance in their own temples. 2 Looking at my map, I co uld see the blue line of the Coatzecoalcos River running into the Gulf of Mexico more or less at the midpoint of the legendary Olmec homeland. The oil industry proliferates here now, where rubber trees once flourished, transforming a tropical paradise into something resembling the lowest circle of Dante’s Inferno.

It lay close to the black heart of an industrial wastel and in which virtually everything of archaeological interest that had escaped the depredations of the Spanish at the time of the conquest had been destroyed by the voracious expansion of the oil business. It was therefore no longer possible, on the basis of hard evidence, to confirm or deny the intriguing suggestion that the legends seemed to make: that something of great importance must once have occurred here.  1 The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya, p. 126. 2 Aztecs: Reign of Blood and Splendour, p. 50."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 123 The Olmec sites of Tres Zapotes, San Lorenzo and La Venta along the Gulf of Mexico, with other Central American archaeological sites.

First at Tres Zapotes, west of Coatzecoalcos, and then at San Lorenzo and La Venta, south and east of it, numerous pieces of characteristically Olmec sculpture had been unearthed.

The road we were following wound in and out of fertile hills and valleys, giving us occasional views of the Gulf of Mexico before turning inland. We passed green meadows filled with flame trees, and little villages nestled in grassy hollows. Here and there we saw private gardens where hulking pigs grubbed amongst piles of domestic refuse. Then we crested the brow of a hill and looked out across a giant vista of fields and forests bound only by the morning haze and the faint outlines of distant mountains. Some miles farther on we dropped in to a hollow; at its bottom lay the old colonial town of Santiago Tuxt la. The place was a riot of colour: garish shop-fronts, red-tile roofs, yellow straw hats, coconut palms, banana trees, kids in bright clothes. Several of the shops and cafés were playing music from loudspeakers. In the Zocalo, the main square, the air was thick with humidity and the flutte ring wings and songs of bright-eyed tropical birds. A leafy little park occupied the centre of this square, and in the centre of the park, like some magic talisman, stood an enormous grey boulder, almost ten feet tall, carved in the shape of a helmeted African head. Full-lipped and strong-nosed, its eyes serenely closed and its lower jaw resting squarely on the ground, this head had a sombre and patient gravity.

Historical dogmatists of that period, I remembered, had held tenaciously to the view that the civilization of the Mayas was the oldest in Central America. One could be precise about this, they argued, because the Mayan dot-and-bar calendrical system (which had recently been decoded) made possible accurate dating of huge numbers of ceremonial inscriptions. The earliest date ever found on a Mayan site corresponded to AD 228 of the Christian calendar. 5 It therefore came as quite a jolt to the academic status quo when Stirling unearthed a stela at Tres Zapotes which bore an earlier date . Written in the familiar bar-and-dot calendrical code used by the Maya, it corresponded to 3 September 32 BC . 6 What was shocking about this was that Tres Zapotes was not a Maya site—not in any way at all. It was entirely, exclusively, unambiguously Olmec. This suggested that the Olmecs, not the Maya, must have been the inventors of the calendar, and that the Olmecs, not the Maya, ought to be recognized as ‘the mother culture’ of Central America. Despite determined opposition from gangs of furious Mayanists the truth which Stirling’s spade had unearthed at Tres Zapotes gradually came out. The Olmecs were much, much older than the Maya. They’d been a smart, civilized, technologically advanced people and they did, indeed, appear to have invented the bar-and-dot system of calendrical notation, with the enigmatic starting date of 13 August 3114 BC , which predicted the end of the world in AD 2012. Lying close to the calendar stela at Tres Zapotes, Stirling also unearthed a giant head. I sat in front of that head now. Dated to around 100 BC , 7 it was approximately six feet high, 18 feet in circumference and weighed over 10 tons. Like its counterpart in Santiago Tuxtla, it was unmistakably the head of an African man wearing a close-fitting helmet with long chin- straps. The lobes of the ears were pierced by plugs; the pronounced negroid features were furrowed by deep frown lines on ei ther side of the nose, and the entire face was concen trated forwards above thick, down- curving lips. The eyes were open an d watchful, almond-shaped and cold. Beneath the curious helmet, the heavy brows appeared beetling and. angry. Stirling was amazed by th is discovery and reported, The head was a head only, carved from a single massive block of basalt, and it rested on a prepared foundation of un worked slabs of stone ... Cleared of the surrounding earth it presented an awe-insp iring spectacle. Despite its great size the workmanship is delicate and sure, the proportions perfect. Unique in character among aboriginal American sculptures, it is remarkable for its realistic treatment. The features are bold and amazingly negroid in character ... 8  5 Mexico, p. 637.

The ‘dogmobiles’ proved, at the very least, that the principle of the wheel had been known to the Olmecs, Central Amer ica’s earliest civilization. And if a people as resourceful as the Olmecs had worked out the principle of the wheel, it seemed highly unlikely that they would have used it just for children’s toys.

It was at San Lorenzo that the earliest carbon-dates for an Olmec site (around 1500 BC ) had been recorded by archaeologists. 1 However, Olmec culture appeared to have been fully evolved by that epoch and there was no evidence that the evolution had taken place in the vicinity of San Lorenzo. 2 In this there lay a mystery. The Olmecs, after all, had built a significant civilization which had carried out prodigious engineering wo rks and had developed the capacity to carve and manipulate vast blocks of stone (several of the huge monolithic heads, weighing twenty to ns or more, had been moved as far as 60 miles overland after being qu arried in the Tuxtla mountains). 3 So where, if not at ancient San Lorenzo, had their technological expertise and sophisticated organization been experimented with, evolved and refined? Strangely, despite the best effort s of archaeologists, not a single, solitary sign of anything that could be described as the ‘developmental phase’ of Olmec society had been unea rthed anywhere in Mexico (or, for that matter, anywhere in the New World). These people, whose characteristic form of artistic expre ssion was the carving of huge negroid heads, appeared to have come from nowhere. 4 San Lorenzo We reached San Lorenzo late in the afternoon. Here, at the dawn of history in Central America, the Olmecs had heaped up an artificial mound more than 100 feet high as part of an immense structure some 4000 feet  1 The Prehistory of the Americas, pp. 268-71.

We climbed the dominant mound, now heavily overgrown with thick tropical vegetation, and from the summit we could see for miles across the surro unding countryside. A great many lesser mounds were also visible an d around about were several of the deep trenches the archaeologist Michael Coe had dug when he had excavated the site in 1966. Coe’s team made a number of finds here, which included more than twenty artificial reservoirs, linked by a highly sophisticated network of basalt-lined troughs. Part of this sy stem was built into a ridge; when it was rediscovered water still gushed forth from it during heavy rains, as it had done for more than 3000 years. The main line of the drainage ran from east to west. Into it, linked by joints made to an advanced design, three subsidiary lines were channelled. 5 After surveying the site thoroughly, the archaeologists admitted that they could not understand the purpose of this elaborate system of sluices and water-works. 6 Nor were they able to come up with an explanation for another enigma. This was the deliberate burial, along specific alignments, of five of the massive pieces of sculpture, show ing negroid features, now widely identified as ‘Olmec heads’. These peculiar and apparently ritualistic graves also yielded more than sixt y precious objects and artefacts, including beautiful instruments made of jade and exquisitely carved statuettes. Some of the statuettes had been systematically mutilated before burial. The way the San Lorenzo sculptures had been interred made it extremely difficult to fix their true age, even though fragments of charcoal were found in the same strata as some of the buried objects. Unlike the sculptures, these charcoal pieces could be carbon-dated. They were, and produced readin gs in the range of 1200 BC . 7 This did not mean, however, that the sculptures had been carved in 1200 BC . They could have been. But they could have origin ated in a period hundreds or even thousands of years earlier than that. It was by no means impossible that these great works of art, with their intrinsic beauty and an indefinable numinous power, could have been preserved and venerated by many different cultures before being buried at San Lorenzo. The charcoal associated with them proved only that the sculptures were at least as old as 1200 BC ; it did not set any upper limit on their antiquity. La Venta We left San Lorenzo as the sun was going down, heading for the city of Villahermosa, more than 150 kilometres to the east in the province of  5 The Ancient Kingdoms of Mexico, p. 36. 6 The Prehistory of the Americas, p. 268. 7 Ibid., pp. 267-8.

To get there we rejoined the main road running from Acayucan to Villahermosa and by-passed the port of Coatzecoalcos in a zone of oil refineries, towering pylons and ultr a-modern suspension bridges. The change of pace between the sleepy rural backwater where San Lorenzo was located and the pockmarked industrial landscape around Coatzecoalcos was almost shocking. Mo reover, the only reason that the timeworn outlines of the Olmec site could still be seen at San Lorenzo was that oil had not yet been found there. It had, however, been found at La Venta—to the eternal loss of archaeology ... We were now passing La Venta. Due north, off a slip-road from the freeway, this sodium-lit petroleum city glowed in the dark like a vision of nuclear disaster. Since the 1940s it had been extensively ‘developed’ by the oil industry: an airstrip now bisected the site where a most un usual pyramid had once stood, and flaring smokestacks darkened the sky which Olmec star-gazers must once have searched for the rising of the planets. Lamentably, the bulldozers of the developers had flattened virtually everything of interest before proper excavations could be conducted, with the result that many of the ancient structures had not been explored at all. 8 We will never know what they could have said about the people who built and used them. Matthew Stirling, who excavated Tres Zapotes, carried out the bulk of the archaeological work done at La Venta before progress and oil money erased it. Carbon-dating suggested that the Olmecs had established themselves here between 1500 and 1100 BC and had continued to occupy the site—which consisted of an island lying in marshes to the east of the Tonala river—until about 400 BC . 9 Then construction was suddenly abandoned, all existing buildings were ceremonially defaced or demolished, and several huge stone heads and other smaller pieces of sculpture were ritually buried in peculiar graves, just as had happened at San Lorenzo. The La Venta graves were elaborate and carefully prepared, lined with thousands of tiny blue tiles and filled up with layers of multicoloured clay. 10 At one spot some 15,000 cubic feet of earth had been dug out of the ground to make a deep pit; its floor had been carefully covered with serpentine blocks, and all the earth put back. Three mosaic pavements were also fo und, intentionally buried beneath several alternating layers of clay and adobe. 11 La Venta’s principal pyramid stood at the southern end of the site. Roughly circular at ground level, it took the form of a fluted cone, the rounded sides consisting of ten vertic al ridges with gullies between. The pyramid was 100 feet tall, almost 200 feet in diameter and had an overall  8 The Ancient Kingdoms of Mexico, p. 30. 9 Ibid., p. 31. 10 The Prehistory of the Americas, pp. 268-9. 11 Ibid., p. 269."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 130 mass in the region of 300,000 cubi c feet—an impressive monument by any standards. The remainder of the site stretched for almost half a kilometre along an axis that pointed precisely 8° west of north. Centred on this axis, with every structure in flawless alignment, were several smaller pyramids and plazas, platforms and mounds, covering a total area of more than three square miles. There was something detached and odd about La Venta, a sense that its original function had not been pr operly understood. Archaeologists referred to it as a ‘ceremonial centre’, and very probably that is what it was. If one were honest, however, one would admit that it could also have been several other things. The truth is that nothing is known about the social organization, ceremonies and belief systems of the Olmecs. We do not know what language they spoke, or what traditions they passed to their children. We don’t even know what ethnic group they belonged to. The exceptionally humid conditions of the Gulf of Mexico mean that not a single Olmec skeleton has survived. 12 In reality, despite the names we have given them and the views we’v e formed about them, these people are completely obscure to us. It is even possible that the enigmatic sculptures ‘they’ left behind, which we presume depicted them, were not ‘their’ work at all, but the work of a far earlier and forgotten people. Not for the first time I found myself wondering whether some of the great heads other remarkable artefacts attributed to the Olmecs might not have been handed down like heirlooms, perhaps over ma ny millennia, to the cu ltures which eventually began to build the mounds and pyrami ds at San Lorenzo and La Venta.

The religions of both regions share many other common images and ideas. Also noteworthy is the fact that p’achi, the Central American word for ‘human sacrifice’, means, literally ‘to open the mouth’— which calls to mind a strange Ancient Egyptian funerary ritual known as ‘the opening of the mouth’. Likewise it was believed in both regions that the souls of dead kings were reborn as stars. Deus ex machina Villahermosa, Tabasco province I was looking at an elaborate relief that had been dubbed ‘Man in Serpent’ by the archaeologists who found it at La Venta. According to expert opinion it showed ‘an Olmec, wearing a head-dress and holding an incense bag, enveloped by a feathered serpent’. 13 The relief was carved into a slab of solid granite measuring about four feet wide by five feet high and showed a man sitting with his legs stretched out in front of him as though he were reaching for pedals with his feet. He held a small, bucket-shape d object in his right hand. With his left he appeared to be raising or lo wering a lever. The ‘head-dress’ he wore was an odd and complicated garment. To my eye it seemed more functional than ceremonial, although I could not imagine what its function might have been. On it, or perhaps on a console above it, were two x-shaped crosses. I turned my attention to the other principal element of the sculpture,  13 The Cities of Ancient Mexico, p. 37."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 134 the ‘feathered serpent’. On one level it did, indeed, depict exactly that: a plumed or feathered serpent, the age-old symbol of Quetzalcoatl, whom the Olmecs, therefore, must have worshipped (or at the very least recognized). Scholars do not dispute this interpretation. 14 It is generally accepted that Quetzalcoatl’s cult wa s immensely ancient, originating in prehistoric times in Central America an d thereafter receiving the devotion of many cultures during the historic period. The feathered serpent in this particul ar sculpture, however, had certain characteristics that set it apart. It seemed to be more than just a religious symbol; indeed, there was something rigid and structured about it that made it look almost like a piece of machinery. Whispers of ancient secrets Later that day I took shelter in the gi ant shadow cast by one of the Olmec heads Carlos Pellicer Camara had resc ued from La Venta. It was the head of an old man with a broad flat nose and thick lips. The lips were slightly parted, exposing strong, square te eth. The expression on the face suggested an ancient, patient wisd om, and the eyes seemed to gaze unafraid into eternity, like those of the Great Sphinx at Giza in lower Egypt. It would probably be impossible , I thought, for a sculptor to invent all the different combined characteristics of an authentic racial type. The portrayal of an authentic combination of racial characteristics therefore implied strongly that a human model had been used. I walked around the great head a co uple of times. It was 22 feet in circumference, weighed 19.8 tons, st ood almost 8 feet high, had been carved out of solid basalt, and displayed clearly ‘an authentic combination of racial characteristics’. Indeed, like the other pieces I had seen at Santiago Tuxtla and at Tres Zapotes, it unmistakably and unambiguously showed a negro. The reader can form his or her own opinion after examining the relevant photographs in this book. My own view is that the Olmec heads present us with physiologically accurate images of real individuals of negroid stock—charismatic and powerf ul African men whose presence in Central America 3000 years ago has no t yet been explained by scholars. Nor is there any certainty that the heads were actually carved in that epoch. Carbon-dating of fragments of charcoal found in the same pits tells us only the age of the charcoal. Calculating the true antiquity of the heads themselves is a much more complex matter. It was with such thoughts that I continued my slow walk among the strange and wonderful monuments of La Venta. They whispered of ancient secrets—the secret of the man in the machine ... the secret of the  14 The Prehistory of the Americas, p. 270."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 135 negro heads ... and, last but not least, the secret of a legend brought to life. For it seemed that flesh might indeed have been put on the mythical bones of Quetzalcoatl when I found that several of the La Venta sculptures contained realistic likenesses not only of negroes but of tall, thin-featured, long-nosed, apparently Caucasian men with straight hair and full beards, wearing flowing robes ..."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 136 Chapter 18 Conspicuous Strangers Matthew Stirling, the American archaeologist who excavated La Venta in the 1940s, made a number of spectacu lar discoveries there. The most spectacular of all was the Stele of the Bearded Man. The plan of the ancient Olmec site, as I have said, lay along an axis pointing 8° west of north. At the sout hern end of this axis, 100 feet tall, loomed the fluted cone of the great pyramid. Next to it, at ground level, was what looked like a curb abou t a foot high en closing a spacious rectangular area one-quarter the size of an average city block. When the archaeologists began to uncover this curb they found, to their surprise, that it consisted of the upper parts of a wall of columns. Further excavation through the undisturbed layers of stratification that had accumulated revealed that the columns were ten feet tall. There were more than 600 of them and they had been set together so closely that they formed a near-impregnable stoc kade. Hewn out of solid basalt and transported to La Venta from quarries more than sixty miles distant, the columns weighed approximately two tons each. Why all this trouble? What had the stockade been built to contain? Even before excavation began, the tip of a massive chunk of rock had been visible jutting out of the ground in the centre of the enclosed area, about four feet higher than the illusory ‘curb’ and leaning steeply forward. It was covered with carvings. These extended down, out of sight, beneath the layers of soil that filled the ancient stockade to a height of about nine feet. Stirling and his team worked for two days to free the great rock. When exposed it proved to be an imposing stele fourteen feet high, seven feet wide and almost three feet thick. The carvings showed an encounter between two tall men, both dressed in elaborate robes and wearing elegant shoes with turned-up toes. Either erosion or deliberate mutilation (quite commonly practised on Olmec monuments) had resulted in the complete defacement of one of the fi gures. The other was intact. It so obviously depicted a Caucasian male with a high-bridged nose and a long, flowing beard that the bemused archaeologists promptly christened it ‘Uncle Sam’. 1 I walked slowly around the twenty-ton stele, remembering as I did so that it had lain buried in the earth for more than 3000 years. Only in the brief half century or so since Stirling’s excavations had it seen the light of day again. What would its fate be no w?

Or, in such a great expanse of time, was it possible that circumstance s might change so much that it would once again be buried and concealed? Perhaps neither would happen. I re membered the ancient calendrical system of Central America, which the Olmecs had initiated. According to them, and to their more famous successors the Mayas, there just weren’t any great expanses of time left, let alone three millennia. The Fifth Sun was all used up and a tremendous earthquake was building to destroy humanity two days before Christmas in AD 2012. I turned my attention back to the stele. Two things seemed to be clear: the encounter scene it portrayed must, for some reason, have been of immense importance to the Olmecs, hence the grandeur of the stele itself, and the construction of the re markable stockade of columns built to contain it. And, as was the case with the negro heads, it was obvious that the face of the bearded Caucasian man could only have been sculpted from a human model. The raci al verisimilitude was too good for an artist to have invented it. The same went for two other Caucasian figures I was able to identify among the surviving monuments from La Venta. One was carved in low relief on a heavy and roughly circular slab of stone about three feet in diameter. Dressed in what looked like tight-fitting leggings, his features were those of an Anglo-Saxon. He had a full pointed beard and wore a curious floppy cap on his head. In his left hand he extended a flag, or perhaps a weapon of some kind. His ri ght hand, which he held across the middle of his chest, appeared to be empty. Around his slim waist was tied a flamboyant sash. The other Caucasian figure, this time carved on the side of a narrow pillar, was si milarly bearded and attired. Who were these conspicuous strangers? What were they doing in Central America? When did they come? And what relationship did they have with those other strangers who had settled in this steamy rubber jungle—the ones who had provided the models for the great negro heads? Some radical researchers, who re jected the dogma concerning the isolation of the New World prior to 1492, had proposed what looked like a viable solution to the problem: the bearded, thin-featured individuals could have been Phoenicians from the Mediterranean who had sailed through the Pillars of Hercules and across the Atlantic Ocean as early as the second millennium BC . Advocates of this theory went on to suggest that the negroes shown at the same sites were the ‘slaves’ of the Phoenicians, picked up on the coast of West Africa prior to the trans- Atlantic run. 2 The more consideration I gave to the strange character of the La Venta sculptures, the more dissatisfied I became with these ideas. Probably the  2 Ibid., p. 141-42."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 138 Phoenicians and other Old World peoples had crossed the Atlantic ages before Columbus. There was compelling evidence for that, although it is outside the scope of this book. 3 The problem was that the Phoenicians, who had left unmistakable examples of their distinctive handiwork in many parts of the ancient world, 4 had not done so at the Olmec sites in Central America. Neither the negro heads, nor the reliefs portraying bearded Caucasian men showed any signs of anything remotely Phoenician in their style, handiwork or character. 5 Indeed, from a stylistic point of view, these powerful works of art seemed to belong to no known culture, tradition or genre. They seemed to be without antecedents either in the New World or in the Old. They seemed rootless ... and that, of course, was impossible, because all forms of artistic expre ssion have roots somewhere. Hypothetical third party It occurred to me that one plausible explanation might lie in a variant of the ‘hypothetical third party’ theory originally put forward by a number of leading Egyptologists to explain one of the great puzzles of Egyptian history and chronology. The archaeological evidence suggested that rather than developing slowly and painfully, as is normal with human societies, the civilization of Ancient Egypt, like that of the Olmecs, emerged all at once and fully formed. Indeed, the period of transition from primitive to advanced society appears to have been so short that it makes no kind of historical sense. Technological skills that sh ould have taken hu ndreds or even thousands of years to evolve were brought into use almost overnight— and with no apparent antecedents whatever. For example, remains from the pre-dynastic period around 3500 BC show no trace of writing. Soon after that date, quite suddenly and inexplicably, the hieroglyphs familiar from so many of the ruins of Ancient Egypt begin to appear in a co mplete and perfect state. Far from being mere pictures of objects or actions, this written language was complex and structured at the outset, with signs that represented sounds only and a detailed system of numerica l symbols. Even the very earliest hieroglyphs were stylized and conventi onalized; and it is clear that an advanced cursive script was it common usage by the dawn of the First Dynasty. 6  3 Fair Gods and Store Faces, passim.

These imp lications are startling, according to a number of more daring thinkers. Jo hn Anthony West, an expert on the early dynastic period, asks: How does a complex civilization spring fu ll-blown into being? Look at a 1905 automobile and compare it to a modern one. There is no mistaking the process of ‘development’. But in Egypt there are no parallels. Everything is right there at the start. The answer to the mystery is of course obvious but, because it is repellent to the prevailing cast of modern thinking, it is seldom considered. Egyptian civilization was not a ‘development’, it was a legacy . 8 West has been a thorn in the flesh of the Egyptological establishment for many years. But other more main stream figures have also confessed puzzlement at the suddenness with which Egyptian civilization appeared. Walter Emery, late Edwards Professor of Egyptology at the University of London, summed up the problem: At a period approximately 3400 years before Christ, a great change took place in Egypt, and the country passed rapidly fr om a state of neolithic culture with a complex tribal charac ter to one of well-organized monarchy ... At the same time the art of writing appears, monumental architecture and the arts and crafts develop to an astonishing degr ee, and all the evidence points to the existence of a luxurious civilization. All this was achieved within a comparatively short period of time, for there appears to be little or no background to these fundamental developments in writing and architecture . 9 One explanation could simply be th at Egypt received its sudden and decisive cultural boost from some ot her known civilization of the ancient world. Sumer, on the Lower Euphrates in Mesopotamia, is the most likely contender. Despite many basic differences, a variety of shared building techniques and architectural styles 10 does suggest a link between the two regions. But none of these similarities is strong enough to infer that the connection could have been in any wa y causal, with one society directly influencing the other. On the contrary, as Professor Emery writes: The impression we get is of an indirect connection, and perhaps the existence of a third party, whose influence spread to both the Euphrates and the Nile ...

[However] a third party whose cultural achievements were passed on independently to Egypt and Mesopotamia would best explain the common features and fundamental differences between the two civilizations. 11 Among other things, this theory sheds light on the mysterious fact that the Egyptians and Sumerian people of Mesopotamia appear to have worshipped virtually identical lunar deities who were among the oldest in their respective pantheons ( Thoth in the case of the Egyptians, Sin in the case of the Sumerians). 12 According to the eminent Egyptologist Sir E.A. Wallis Budge, ‘The similarity between the two gods is too close to be accidental ... It would be wrong to say that the Egyptians borrowed from the Sumerians or the Sumerians from the Egyptians, but it may be submitted that the literati of both peoples borrowed their theological systems from some common but exceedingly ancient source.’ 13 The question, therefore, is this: what was that ‘common but exceedingly ancient source’, that ‘h ypothetical and as yet undiscovered area’, that advanced ‘third party’ to which both Budge and Emery refer? And if it left a legacy of high cult ure in Egypt and in Mesopotamia, why shouldn’t it have done so in Central America? It’s not good enough to argue that civilization ‘took off’ much later in Mexico than it had in the Middle Ea st. It is possible that the initial impulse could have been felt at the same time in both places but that the subsequent outcome could have been completely different. On this scenario, the civilizers woul d have succeeded brilliantly in Egypt and in Sumer, creating lasting and re markable cultures there. In Mexico, on the other hand (as also seems to have been the case in Peru), they suffered some serious setback—perhaps getting off to a good start, when the gigantic stone heads and reliefs of bearded men were made, but going rapidly downhill. The light of civilization would never quite have been lost, but perhaps things didn’t pick up again until around 1500 BC , the so-called ‘Olmec horizon’. By then the great sculptures would have been hoary with age, ancient relics of immense spiritual power, their all- but-forgotten origins wrapped in myths of giants and bearded civilizers. If so, we may be gazing at faces from a much more remote past than we imagine when we stare into the almond eyes of one of the negro heads or into the angular, chiselled Caucasian features of ‘Uncle Sam’. It is by no means impossible that these great works preserve the images of peoples from a vanished civilization which embraced several different ethnic groups.

Villahermosa to Oaxaca Before leaving Villahermosa I visited CICOM, the Centre for Investigation of the Cultures of the Olmecs and Ma ya. I wanted to find out from the scholars there whether there were any other significant Olmec sites in the region. To my surprise, they suggeste d that I should look farther afield. At Monte Alban, in Oaxaca province hundreds of kilometres to the southwest, archaeologists had apparently unearthed ‘Olmecoid’ artefacts and a number of reliefs thought to represent the Olmecs themselves. Santha and I had intended to drive straight on from Villahermosa into the Yucatan Peninsula, which lay nort h-east. The journey to Monte Alban would involve a huge detour, but we decided to make it, in the hope that it might shed further light on the Ol mecs. Besides, it promised to be a spectacular drive over immense mountains and into the heart of the hidden valley where the city of Oaxaca lies. We drove almost due west past th e lost site of La Venta, past Coatzecoalcos once again, and on pa st Sayula and Loma Bonita to the road-junction town of Tuxtepec. In so doing, by degrees we left behind countryside scarred and blackened by the oil industry, crossed long gentle hillsides carpeted in lush green grass, and ran between fields ripe with crops. At Tuxtepec, where the sierras really began, we turned sharply south following Highway 175 to Oaxaca. On the map it looked barely half the distance that we had driven from Villahermosa. The road, however, proved to be a complicated, nerve-ra cking, muscle-wrenching, apparently endless zig-zag of hairpin bends— narrow, winding and precipitous— which went up into the clouds like a stairway to heaven. It took us through many different layers of al pine vegetation, each occupying a specialized climatological niche, unti l it brought us out above the clouds in a place where familiar plants flourished in giant forms, like John Wyndham’s triffids, creating a surreal and alien landscape. It took twelve hours to drive the 700 kilometres from Villahermosa to Oaxaca. By the time the journey was over, my hands were blistered from gripping the steering-wheel too tight for too long around too many hairpin bends. My eyes were blurred and I kept having mental retrospectives of the vertiginous chasms we had skirted on Highway 175, in the mountains, where the triffids grew.

No serious suggestions have been made as to where that ancestral civilization might have been located, its nature, or when it flourished. Like a black hole in space, it cannot be seen. Yet its presence can be deduced from its effects on things that can be seen—in this case the civilizations of Sumer and Egypt. Is it possible that the same myst erious ancestor, the same invisible source of influence, could also have left its mark in Mexico? If so, we would expect to find certain cultur al similarities between Mexico’s ancient civilizations and those of Sumer and Egypt. We would also expect to be confronted by immense differen ces resulting from the long period of divergent evolution which separated all these areas in historical times. We would, however, expect the differences to be less between Sumer and Egypt, which were in regular contact wi th each other duri ng the historical period, than between the two Middle Ea stern cultures and the cultures of far-off Central America, which enjoyed at most only haphazard, slight and intermittent contacts prior to the ‘discovery’ of the New World by Columbus in AD 1492. Eaters of the dead, earth monsters, star kings, dwarves and other relatives For some curious reason that has not been explained, the Ancient Egyptians had a special liking and reverence for dwarves. 1 So, too, did the civilized peoples of ancient Central America, right back to Olmec times. 2 In both cases it was believed that dw arves were directly connected to the gods. 3 And in both cases dwarves were favoured as dancers and were shown as such in works of art. 4 In Egypt’s early dynastic period, mo re than 4500 years ago, an ‘Ennead’ of nine omnipotent deities was particularly adored by the priesthood at Heliopolis. 5 Likewise, in Central America, both the Aztecs and the Mayas  1 See, for example, The Encyclopaedia of Ancient Egypt, pp. 69-70; also Jean-Pierre Hallet, Pygmy Kitabu, BCA, London, 1974, pp. 84-106. 2 The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya, p. 82. 3 Ibid., The Encyclopaedia of Ancient Egypt, pp. 69-70, and Pygmy Kitabu, pp. 84-106. 4 Ibid. 5 The Encyclopaedia of Ancient Egypt, p. 85."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 144 believed in an all-powerful system of nine deities. 6 The Popol Vuh, the sacred book of the ancient Quiche Maya of Mexico and Guatemala, contains several passages which clearly indicate a belief in ‘stellar rebirth’—the reincarnation of the dead as stars. After they had been killed, for example, the Hero Twins named Hunahpu and Xbalanque ‘rose up in the midst of the light, and instantly they were lifted into the sky ... Then the arch of heaven and the face of the earth were lighted. And they dwelt in heaven.’ 7 At the same time ascended the Twins’ 400 companions who had also been killed, ‘and so they again became the companions of Hunahpu and Xbalanque and were changed into stars in the sky.’ 8 The majority of the traditions of th e God-King Quetzalcoatl, as we have seen, focus on his deeds and teaching s as a civilizer. His followers in ancient Mexico, however, also believe d that his human manifestation had experienced death and that afterwards he was reborn as a star . 9 It is therefore curious, at the very least, to discover that in Egypt, in the Pyramid Age, more than 4000 years ago, the state religion revolved around the belief that the deceas ed pharaoh was reborn as a star. 10 Ritual incantantations were chanted, the purpose of which was to facilitate the dead monarch’s rapid rebirth in the he avens: ‘Oh king, you are this Great Star, the Companion of Orion, who tr averses the sky with Orion ... you ascend from the east of the sky, being renewed in your due season, and rejuvenated in your due time ...’ 11 We have encountered the Orion constellation before, on the plains of Nazca, and we shall encounter it again ... Meanwhile, let us consider the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead. Parts of its contents are as old as the civiliza tion of Egypt itself and it serves as a sort of Baedeker for the transmigration of the soul. It instructs the deceased on how to overcome the dang ers of the afterlife, enables him to assume the form of several mythical creatures, and equips him with the passwords necessary for admission to th e various stages, or levels, of the underworld. 12 Is it a coincidence that the peoples of Ancient Central America preserved a parallel vision of the perils of the afterlife?

In both Ancient Central America and Ancient Egypt, it was believed that the deceased’s voyage through the underworld was made in a boat, accompanied by ‘paddler gods’ who ferried him from stage to stage. 14 The tomb of ‘Double Comb’, an eighth- century ruler of the Mayan city of Tikal, was found to contain a representation of this scene. 15 Similar images appear throughout the Valley of the Kings in Upper Egypt, no tably in the tomb of Thutmosis III, an Eighteenth Dynasty pharaoh. 16 Is it a coincidence that the passengers in the barque of the dead pharaoh, and in the canoe in which Double Comb makes his final journey, incl ude (in both cases) a dog or dog- headed deity, a bird or bird-headed deity, and an ape or ape-headed deity? 17 The seventh stratum of the Ancient Mexican underworld was called Teocoyolcualloya: ‘place where beasts devour hearts’. 18 Is it a coincidence that one of the stages of the Ancient Egyptian underworld, ‘the Hall of Judgement’, involved an almost identical series of symbols? At this crucial juncture the deceased’s heart was weighed against a feather. If the heart was heav y with sin it would tip the balance. The god Thoth would note the judgem ent on his palette and the heart would immediately be devoured by a fearsome beast, part crocodile, part hippopotamus, part lion, that wa s called ‘the Eater of the Dead’. 19 Finally, let us turn again to Egypt of the Pyramid Age and the privileged status of the pharaoh, which enabled him to circumvent the trials of the underworld and to be reborn as a star. Ritual incantations were part of the process. Equally important was a mysterious ceremony known as ‘the opening of the mouth’, always conducted after the death of the pharaoh  13 Pre-Hispanic Gods of Mexico, p. 37. 14 The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya, pp. 128-9. 15 Reproduced in National Geographic Magazine, volume 176, Number 4, Washington DC, October 1989, p. 468: ‘Double Comb is being taken to the underworld in a canoe guided by the “paddler twins”, gods who appear prominently in Maya mythology.

This was used ‘to open the mouth’ of the deceased God-King, an action thought necessary to ensure his resurrection in the heavens. Surviving reliefs and vignettes showing this ceremony leave no doubt that the mu mmified corpse was struck a hard physical blow with the peshenkhef . 21 In addition, evidence has recently emerged which indicates that one of the chambers within the Great Pyramid at Giza may have served as the location for the ceremony. 22 All this finds a strange, distorted twin in Mexico. We have seen the prevalence of human sacrifice there in pre-conquest times. Is it coincidental that the sacrificial venue was a pyramid, that the ceremony was conducted by a high priest and four assistants, that a cutting instrument, the sacrificial knife, was us ed to strike a hard physical blow to the body of the victim, and that the victim’s soul was believed to ascend directly to the heavens, sidestepping the perils of the underworld? 23 As such ‘coincidences’ continue to mu ltiply, it is reasonable to wonder whether there may not be some underl ying connection. This is certainly the case when we learn that the gene ral term for ‘sacrifice’ throughout Ancient Central America was p’achi, meaning ‘to open the mouth’. 24 Could it be, therefore, that what co nfronts us here, in widely separated geographical areas, and at different periods of history, is not just a series of startling coincidences but some faint and garbled common memory originating in the most distant antiquity? It doesn’t seem that the Egyptian ceremony of the opening of the mouth influenced directly the Mexican ceremony of the same name (or vice versa, for that matter). The fundamental differences between the two cases rule that out. What does seem possible, however, is that their similarities may be the remnants of a shared legacy received from a common ancestor. The peoples of Central America did one thing with that legacy and the Egyptians another, but some common symbolism and nomenclature was retained by both. This is not the place to expand on the sense of an ancient and elusive connectedness that emerges from the Egyptian and Central American evidence. Before moving on, however, it is worth noting that a similar ‘connectedness’ links the belief syst ems of pre-Colombian Mexico with those of Sumer in Mesopotamia. Again the evidence is more suggestive of an ancient common ancestor than of any direct influence.  20 See, for example, R. T.

In Mesopotamian tradition, Tiamat turned against the other deities and unleashed a holocaust of destruction before she was eventually destroyed by the celestial hero Marduk: She opened her mouth, Tiamat, to swallow him. He drove in the evil wind so that she could not close her lips. The terrible winds filled her belly. Her heart was seized, She held her mouth wide open, He let fly an arrow, it pierced her belly, Her inner parts he clove, he split her heart, He rendered her powerless and destroyed her life, He felled her body and stood upright on it. 28 How do you follow an act like that? Marduk could. Contemplating his adversary’s monstrous corpse, ‘he conceived works of art’, 29 and a great plan of world creation began to take shape in his mind. His first move was to split Tiamat’s skull and cut her arteries. Then he broke her into two parts ‘like a dried fish’, using one half to roof the heavens and the other to surface the earth. From her breasts he made mountains, from her spittle, clouds, an d he directed the rivers Tigris and Euphrate s to flow from her eyes. 30 A strange and violent legend, and a very old one. The ancient civilizations of Centra l America had their own version of this story.

If so, the faces of the heroes of that ancestral culture may indeed have been carved in stone and passed down as heirlooms through thousands of years, sometimes in full view, sometimes buried, until they were dug up for the last time by archaeologists in our era and given labels like ‘Olmec Head’ and ‘Uncle Sam’. The faces of those heroes also appear at Monte Alban, where they seem to tell a sad story. Monte Alban. Monte Alban: the downfall of masterful men A site thought to be about 3000 years old, 32 Monte Alban stands on a vast artificially flattened hilltop overlook ing Oaxaca. It consists of a huge rectangular area, the Grand Plaza, which is enclosed by groups of pyramids and other buildings laid out in precise geometrical relationships to one another.

If a great civilization had indeed been lost to history, and if these sculptures told part of its story, th e message conveyed was one of racial equality. No one who has seen the pride, or felt the charisma, of the great negro heads from La Venta could se riously imagine that the original subjects of these magisterial sculptures could have been slaves. Neither did the lean-faced, bearded men look as if they would have bent their knees to anyone. They, too, had an aristocratic demeanour. At Monte Alban, however, there seemed to be carved in stone a record of the downfall of these masterful men. It did not look as if this could have been the work of the same people who made the La Venta sculptures. The standard of craftsmanship was far too low for that. But what was certain—whoever they were, and however inferior their work— was that these artists had attempted to portray the same negroid subjects and the same goatee-bearded Caucasians as I had seen at La Venta. There the sculptures had refl ected strength, power and vitality. Here at Monte Alban the remarkable strangers were corpses. All were naked, most were castrate d, some were curled up in foetal positions as though to avoid showers of blows, others lay sprawled slackly. Archaeologists said the sculptures showed ‘the corpses of prisoners captured in battle’. 33 What prisoners? From where? The location, after all, was Central America, the New World, thousands of years before Columbus, so wasn’t it odd that these images of battlefield casualties showed not a single native American but only and exclusively Old World racial types? For some reason, orthodox academics did not find this puzzling, even though, by their reckoning, the carvings were extremely old (dating to somewhere between 1000 and 600 BC 34 ). As at other sites, this time-frame had been derived from tests on associated organic matter, not on the carvings themselves, which were incised on granite stele and therefore hard to date objectively. Legacy An as yet undeciphered but fully elab orated hieroglyphic script had been found at Monte Alban, 35 much of it carved on to the same stele as the crude Caucasian and negro figures.

An obse rvatory, consisting of a strange arrowhead-shaped structure, lay at an angle of 45° to the main axis (which was deliberately tilted several degrees from north-south). 37 Crawling into this observatory, I found it to be a warren of tiny, narrow tunnels and steep internal stairways, gi ving sightlines to different regions of the sky. 38 The people of Monte Alban, like the pe ople of Tres Zapotes, left definite evidence of their knowledge of mathem atics, in the form of bar-and-dot computations. 39 They had also used th e remarkable calendar, 40 introduced by the Olmecs and much associated with the later Maya, 41 which predicted the end of the world on 23 December AD 2012. If the calendar, and the preoccupation with time, had been part of the legacy of an ancient and forgotten civilization, the Maya must be ranked as the most faithful and inspired inhe ritors of that legacy. ‘Time’ as the archaeologist Eric Thompson put it in 1950, ‘was the supreme mystery of Maya religion, a subject which pervaded Maya thought to an extent without parallel in the history of mankind.’ 42 As I continued my journey through Ce ntral America I felt myself drawn ever more deeply into the labyrinths of that strange and awesome riddle.  36 The Ancient Kingdoms of Mexico, pp. 54. 37 Mexico, pp. 669-71. 38 For further details, see The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya, p. 17: ‘These buildings probably confirm knowledge of a large body of star lore.’ 39 The Ancient Kingdoms of Mexico, p. 53. 40 Mysteries of the Mexican Pyramids, p. 350. 41 The Ancient Kingdoms of Mexico, pp. 44-5. 42 J.

I sat just be neath the north-east corner of the Mayan Temple of the Inscriptions and gazed north over the darkening jungle where the land dropped away towards the flood plain of the Usumacinta. The Temple consisted of three chambers and rested on top of a nine- stage pyramid almost 100 feet tall. The clean and harmonious lines of this structure gave it a sense of de licacy, but not of weakness. It felt strong, rooted into the earth, enduri ng—a creature of pure geometry and imagination. Looking to my right I could see the Palace, a spacious rectangular complex on a pyramidal base, dominate d by a narrow, four-storied tower, thought to have been used as an observatory by Maya priests. Around about me, where bright-feath ered parrots and macaws skimmed the treetops, a number of other spectacular buildings lay half swallowed by the encroaching forest.

Set into the rear wall were two great grey slabs, and inscribed on them, in regimented rows like pieces on a chequerboard, were 620 separate Mayan glyphs.

No one knew for sure because the inscriptions, a mixture of word pictures and phonetic symbols, had not yet been fully decoded.

This led to a room buried deep in the bowels of the pyramid, where the tomb of Lord Pacal lay. The stairs, of highly polished limestone blocks, were narrow and surprisingly slippery and moist. Adopting a crabbe d, sideways stance, I switched on my torch and stepped gingerly down into the gloom, steadying myself against the southern wall as I did so. This damp stairway had been a secret place from the date when it was originally sealed, in AD 683, until June 1952 when the Mexican archaeologist Alberto Ruz lifted the flagstones in the temple floor. Although a second such tomb wa s found at Palenque in 1994, 2 Ruz had the honour of being the first man to discover such a feature inside a New World pyramid. The stairw ay had been intentionall y filled with rubble by its builders, and it took four more ye ars before the archaeologists cleared it out completely and reached the bottom.  1 The Atlas of Mysterious Places (ed.

Spread out on the floor in front of them were the mouldering skeletons of five or possibly six young victims of sacrifice. A huge triangular slab of stone was visible at the far end of the chamber. When it was removed, Ruz was confronted by a remarkable tomb. He described it as ‘an enormous room that appeared to be gr aven in ice, a kind of grotto whose walls and roof seemed to have been planed in perfect surfaces, or an abandoned chapel whose cupola was draped with curtains of stalactites, and from whose floor arose thick st alagmites like the dripping of a candle.’ 3 The room, also roofed wi th a corbel vault, was 30 feet long and 23 feet high. Around the walls, in stucco relief, could be seen the striding figures of the Lords of the Night—the ‘Ennead’ of nine deities who ruled over the hours of darkness. Centre-stage, and overlooked by these figures, was a huge monolithic sarcophagu s lidded with a five-ton slab of richly carved stone. Inside the sarcop hagus was a tall skeleton draped with a treasure trove of jade ornaments. A mosaic death mask of 200 fragments of jade was affixed to the front of the skull. These, supposedly, were the remains of Pacal, a ruler of Palenq ue in the seventh century AD . The inscriptions stated that this monarch had been ei ghty years old at the time of his death, but the jade-draped skeleton the archaeologists found in the sarcophagus appeared to belong to a man half that age. 4 Having reached the bottom of the stai rway, some eighty-five feet below the floor of the temple, I crossed the chamber where the sacrificial victims had lain and gazed directly into Pacal’s tomb. The air was dank, full of mildew and damp-rot, and surp risingly cold. The sarcophagus, set into the floor of the tomb, had a curious shape, flared strikingly at the feet like an Ancient Egyptian mummy case. These were made of wood and were equipped with wide bases since they were frequently stood upright. But Pacal’s coffin was made of solid stone and was uncompromisingly horizontal. Why, then, had the Mayan artificers gone to so much trouble to widen its base when they must have known that it served no useful purpose? Could they have been slavishly copying a design-feature from some ancient model long after the raison d’être for the design had been forgotten? 5 Like the beliefs concerning the perils of the afterlife, might Pacal’s sarcophagus not be an expression of a common legacy linking Ancient Egypt wi th the ancient cultures of Central America? Rectangular in shape, the heavy stone lid of the sarcophagus was ten inches thick, three feet wide and twelve and a half feet long. It, too, seemed to have been modelled on th e same original as the magnificent engraved blocks the Ancient Egyptians had used for this exact purpose.  3 Quoted in The Atlas of Mysterious Places, pp. 68-9. 4 Ibid.

But there was one major difference. The scene carved on top of the sarcophagus lid was unlike anything that ever came out of Egypt. Lit in my torch beam, it showed a clean-shaven man dressed in what looked like a tight-fitting body-suit, the sleeves and leggings of which were gathered into elaborate cuffs at the wrists and ankles. The man lay semi- reclined in a bucket seat which supported his lower back and thighs, the nape of his neck resting comfortably against some kind of headrest, and he was peering forward intently. His hands seemed to be in motion, as though they were operating levers an d controls, and his feet were bare, tucked up loosely in front of him. Was this supposed to be Pacal, the Maya king? If so, why was he shown operating some kind of machine? The Maya weren’t supposed to have had machin es. They weren’t even supposed to have discovered the wheel. Yet with its side panels, rivets, tubes and other gadgets, the structure Pacal re clined in resembled a technological device much more strongly than it did ‘the transition of one man’s living soul to the realms of the dead’, 6 as one authority claimed, or the king ‘falling back into the fleshless jaws of the earth monster’, 7 as another argued. I remembered ‘Man in Snake’, the Olmec relief described in Chapter Seventeen. It, too, had looked like a naïve depiction of a piece of technology. Furthermore, ‘Man in Snake’ had come from La Venta, where it had been associated with seve ral bearded figures, apparently Caucasians. Pacal’s tomb was at leas t a thousand years younger than any of the La Venta treasures. Neverthele ss, a tiny jade statuette was found lying close to the skeleton inside the sarcophagus, and it appeared to be much older than the other grave-goods also placed there.

Since time out of mind this edifice, which did look like the castle of a necromancer, had been known as the ‘Pyramid of the Magician’ and also as the ‘House of the Dwarf’. These names were derived from a Maya legend which asserted that a dwarf with supernatural powers had raised  6 The Atlas of Mysterious Places, p. 70. 7 Time Among the Maya, p. 298. 8 Fair Gods and Stone Faces, pp. 95-6."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 155 the entire building in just one night. 9 The steps, as I climbed them, se emed more and more perversely narrow. My instinct was to lean forward, flatten myself against the side of the pyramid, and cling on for dear life . Instead I looked up at the angry, overcast sky above me. Flocks of bi rds circled, screeching wildly as though seeking refuge from some impending disaster, and the thick mass of low-lying cloud that had blot ted out the sun a few hours earlier was now so agitated by high wi nds that it seemed to boil. The Pyramid of the Magician was by no means unique in being associated with the supernatural powers of dwarves, whose architectural and masonry skills were widely renowned in Central America. ‘Construction work was easy for them,’ asserted one typical Maya legend, ‘all they had to do was whistle and heavy rocks would move into place.’ 10 A very similar tradition, as the re ader may recall, claimed that the gigantic stone blocks of the mysterio us Andean city of Tiahuanaco had been ‘carried through the air to the sound of a trumpet’. 11 In both Central America and in the far-off regions of the Andes, therefore, strange sounds had been associated with the miraculous levitation of massive rocks. What was I to make of this? Maybe, through some fluke, two almost identical ‘fantasies’ could have been independently invented in both these geographically remote areas. But that didn’t seem very likely. Equally worthy of consideration was the possibility that common recollections of an ancient build ing technology could have been preserved in stories such as these, a technology capable of lifting huge blocks of stone off the ground with ‘miraculous’ ea se. Could it be relevant that memories of almost identical miracles were preserved in Ancient Egypt? There, in one typical tr adition, a magician was said to have raised into the air ‘a huge vault of stone 200 cubits long and 50 cubits broad’? 12   9 Mexico: Rough Guide, Harrap-Columbus, London, 1989, p. 354. 10 The Mythology of Mexico and Central America, p. 8.

The sides of the stairway I was climbi ng were richly decorated with what the nineteenth-century American explorer John Lloyd Stephens described as ‘a species of sculptured mosaic’. 13 Oddly, although the Pyramid of the Magician had been built long centuries before the Conquest, the symbol most frequently featured in these mosaics was a close approximation of the Christian cross. Indeed there were two distinct kinds of ‘Christian’ crosses: one the wide-pawed croix-patte favoured by the Knights Templar and other crusading orders in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries; the other the x-shaped Saint Andrew’s cross. After climbing a further shorter flight of steps I reached the temple at the very top of the Magician’s pyramid. It consisted of a single corbel- vaulted chamber from the ceiling of which large numbers of bats hung suspended. Like the birds and the clou ds, they were visibly distressed by the sense of a huge storm brewing. In a furry mass they shuffled restlessly upside down, folding and un folding their small leathery wings. I took a rest on the high platform that surrounded the chamber. From here, looking down, I could see ma ny more crosses. They were everywhere, literally all over this bizarre and ancient structure. I remembered the Andean city of Tiahuanaco and the crosses that had been carved there, in distant pre-Colombian times, on some of the great blocks of stone lying scattered around the building known as Puma Punku. 14 ‘Man in Snake’, the Olmec sculpture from La Venta, had also been engraved with two Saint Andrew’s crosses long before the birth of Christ.

Crosses ... How likely was it to be an accident that symbols as distinctive as these should repeat themselves in widely separated cultures and at different periods of history? Why were they so often built into the fabric of sophisticated works of art and architecture? A science of prophecy Not for the first time I suspected that I might be looking at signs and icons left behind by some cult or se cret society which had sought to keep the light of civilization burning in Central America (and perhaps elsewhere) through long ages of darkness. I thought it notable that the motifs of the bearded man, the Plumed Serpent, and the cross all tended to crop up whenever and wherever th ere were hints that a technologically advanced and as yet unidentified ci vilization might once have been in contact with the native cultures. And there was a sense of great age about this contact, as though it took place at such an early date that it had been almost forgotten. I thou ght again about the sudden way the Olmecs had emerged, around the middle of the second millennium BC , out of the swirling mists of opaque prehistory. All the archaeological evidence indicated that from the beginning they had venerated huge stone heads and stele showing bearded men. I found myself increasingly drawn to the possibility that some of those remarkable pieces of sculpture could have been part of a va st inheritance of civilization handed down to the peoples of Central America many thousands of years before the second millennium BC , and thereafter entrusted to the safekeeping of a secret wisdom cult, perhap s the cult of Quetzalcoatl. Much had been lost. Nevertheless the tribes of this region—in particular the Maya, the builders of Palenque and Uxmal—had preserved something even more mysterious and wonderfu l than the enigmatic monoliths, something which declared itself even more persistently to be the legacy of an older and a higher civilization. We see in the next chapter that it was the mystical science of an ancient star-gazing folk, a science of time and measurement and prediction—a science of prophecy even—that the Maya had preserved most perfectly from the past. With it they inherited memories of a terrible, earth-destroyi ng flood and an idiosyncratic legacy of empirical knowledge, knowledge of a high order which they shouldn’t really have possessed, knowledge that we have only reacquired very recently ..."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 158 Chapter 21 A Computer for Calculating the End of the World The Maya knew where their advanced learning originated. It was handed down to them, they said, from the First Men, the creatures of Quetzalcoatl, whose names had been Balam-Quitze (Jaguar with the Sweet Smile), Balam-Acab (Jaguar of the Night), Mahucutah (The Distinguished Name) and Iqui-Balam (Jaguar of the Moon). 1 According to the Popol Vuh, these forefathers: were endowed with intelligence; they saw and instantly they could see far; they succeeded in seeing; they succeeded in knowing all that there is in the world. The things hidden in the distance they saw without first having to move ... Great was their wisdom; their sight reached to the fore sts, the rocks, the lakes, the seas, the mountains, and the valleys. In truth, they were admirable men ... They were able to know all, and they examined the four corners, the four points of the arch of the sky, and the round face of the earth. 2 The achievements of this race aroused the envy of several of the most powerful deities. ‘It is not well that our creatures should know all,’ opined these gods, ‘Must they perchance be the equals of ourselves, their Makers, who can see afar, who know all and see all? ... Must they also be gods?’ 3 Obviously such a state of affairs coul d not be allowed to continue. After some deliberation an order was give n and appropriate action taken: Let their sight reach only to that which is near; let them see only a little of the face of the earth ... Then the Heart of Heaven blew mist into thei r eyes which clouded their sight as when a mirror is breathed upon. Their eyes were covered and they could only see what was close, only that was clear to them ... In this way the wisdom and all the knowledge of the First Men were destroyed. 4 Anyone familiar with the Old Testament will remember that the reason for the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden had to do with similar divine concerns. After the Firs t Man had eaten of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, The Lord God said, ‘Behold, the man has become as one of us, to know good and evil. Now, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever, [let us] send him fo rth from the Garden of Eden ...’ 5 The Popol Vuh is accepted by scholars as a great reservoir of  1 Popol Vuh, p. 167. 2 Ibid., pp. 168-9. 3 Ibid., p. 169. 4 Ibid. 5 Genesis, 4:22-4"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 159 uncontaminated, pre-Colombian tradition. 6 It is therefore puzzling to find such similarities between these traditions and those recorded in the Genesis story. Moreover, like so many of the other Old World/New World links we have identified, the character of the similarities is not suggestive of any kind of direct influence of one region on the other but of two different interpretations of the same set of events. Thus, for example: • The biblical Garden of Eden looks like a metaphor for the state of blissful, almost ‘godlike’, knowledge that the ‘First Men’ of the Popol Vuh enjoyed. • The essence of this knowledge was the ability to ‘see all’ and to ‘know all’. Was this not precisely the ab ility Adam and Eve acquired after eating the forbidden fruit, which grew on the branches of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil’? • Finally, just as Adam and Eve were driven out of the Garden, so were the four First Men of the Popol Vuh deprived of their ability to ‘see far’. Thereafter ‘their eyes were covere d and they could only see what was close ...’ Both the Popol Vuh and Genesis therefore tell the story of mankind’s fall from grace. In both cases, this state of grace was closely associated with knowledge, and the reader is left in no doubt that the knowledge in question was so remarkable that it conferred godlike powers on those who possessed it. The Bible, adopting a dark and muttering tone of voice, calls it ‘the knowledge of good and evil’ and has nothing further to add. The Popol Vuh is much more informativ e. It tells us that the knowledge of the First Men consisted of the ability to see ‘t hings hidden in the distance’, that they were astronomers who ‘examined the four corners, the four points of the arch of the sky’, and that they were geographers who succeeded in measuring ‘the round face of the earth’. 7 Geography is about maps. In Part I we saw evidence suggesting that the cartographers of an as yet unidentified civilization might have mapped the planet with great thoroughness at an early date. Could the Popol Vuh be transmitting some garbled memory of that same civilization when it speaks nostalgically of the First Men and of the miraculous geographical knowledge they possessed? Geography is about maps, and astronomy is about stars. Very often the two disciplines go hand in hand because stars are essential for navigation on long sea-going voyages of discov ery (and long sea-going voyages of discovery are essential for the production of accurate maps). Is it accidental that the First Men of the Popol Vuh were remembered not only for studying ‘the round face of the earth’ but for their contemplation of ‘the arch of heaven’? 8 And is it a coincidence that the  6 Popol Vuh, Introduction, p. 16.

Knowledge out of place In 1954 J. Eric Thompson, a leading authority on the archaeology of Central America, confessed to a deep sense of puzzlement at a number of glaring disparities he had identified between the generally unremarkable achievements of the Mayas, as a whole and the advanced state of their astro-calendrical knowledge, ‘What mental quirks,’ he asked, ‘led the Maya intelligentsia to chart the heavens, yet fail to grasp the principle of the wheel; to visualiz e eternity, as no other semi-civilized people has ever done, yet ignore the short step from corbelled to true arch; to count in millio ns, yet never to learn to weigh a sack of corn?’ 9 Perhaps the answer to these questions is much simpler than Thompson realized. Perhaps the astronomy, the deep understanding of time, and the long-term mathematical calculations, were not ‘quirks’ at all. Perhaps they were the constituent parts of a coherent but very specific body of knowledge that the Maya had inherited, more or less intact, from an older and wiser civilization. Such an inheritance wo uld explain the contradictions observed by Thompson, and there is no need for any dispute on the point. We already know that the Maya received their calendar as a legacy from the Olme cs (a thousand years earlier, the Olmecs were using exactly the same system). The real question, should be, where did the Olmecs get it? What kind of level of technological and scientific development was required fo r a civilization to devise a calendar as good as this? Take the case of the solar year. In modern Western society we still make use of a solar calendar which was introduced in Europe in 1582 and is based on the best scientific knowledge then available: the famous Gregorian calendar. The Julian calend ar, which it replaced, computed the period of the earth’s or bit around the sun at 365. 25 days. Pope Gregory XIII’s reform substituted a finer and more accurate calculation: 365.2425 days. Thanks to scientific advances since 1582 we now know that the exact length of the solar year is 365.2 422 days. The Gregorian calendar therefore incorporates a very small plus error, just 0.0003 of a day— pretty impressive accuracy for the sixteenth century. Strangely enough, though its origins are wrapped in the mists of antiquity far deeper than the sixteenth century, the Mayan calendar achieved even greater accuracy. It ca lculated the solar year at 365.2420  9 J.

Their estimate of this period was 29.528395 days—extremely close to the true figure of 29.530588 days comput ed by the finest modern methods. 11 The Mayan priests also had in their po ssession very accurate tables for the prediction of solar and lunar eclipses and were aware that these could occur only within plus or minus eighteen days of the node (when the moon’s path crosses the apparent path of the sun). 12 Finally, the Maya were remarkably accomplished mathematicians. They possessed an advanced technique of metrical calc ulation by means of a chequerboard device we ourselves have only discov ered (or rediscovered?) in the last century. 13 They also understood perfectl y and used the abstract concept of zero 14 and were acquainted with place numerations. These are esoteric fields. As Thompson observed, The cipher (nought) and place numerations are so much parts of our cultural heritage and seem such obvious conveniences that it is difficult to comprehend how their invention could have been long delayed. Yet neither ancient Greece with its great mathematicians, nor ancient Rome, had any inkling of either nought or place numeration. To write 1848 in Roman numerals requires eleven letters: MDCCCXLVIII. Yet the Maya had a system of place-value notation very much like our own at a time when the Romans were still using their clumsy method. 15 Isn’t it a bit odd that this otherwis e unremarkable Central American tribe should, at such an early date, have stumbled upon an innovation which Otto Neugebauer, the historian of science, has described as ‘one of the most fertile inventions of humanity’. 16 Someone else’s science? Let us now consider the question of Venus, a planet that was of immense symbolic importance to all the anci ent peoples of Central America, who identified it strongly with Quetzalcoatl (or Gucumatz or Kukulkan, as the Plumed Serpent was known in the Maya dialects). 17 Unlike the Ancient Greeks, but like the Ancient Egyptians, the Maya understood that Venus was both ‘the morning star’ and ‘the evening  10 William Gates’s notes (p. 81) to Diego de Landa’s Yucatan before and after the Conquest. 11 This is evident from the Dresden Codex.

The ‘synodical revolution’ of a planet is the period of time it takes to return to any given point in the sky—as viewed from ea rth. Venus revolves around the sun every 224.7 days, while the earth follow s its own slightly wider orbit. The composite result of these two motions is that Venus rises in exactly the same place in the earth’s sky approximately every 584 days. Whoever invented the sophisticated ca lendrical system inherited by the Maya had been aware of this and had found ingenious ways to integrate it with other interlocking cycles. Moreov er, it is clear from the mathematics which brought these cycles together that the ancient calendar masters had understood that 584 days was only an approximation and that the movements of Venus are by no me ans regular. They had therefore worked out the exact figure estab lished by today’s science for the average synodical revolution of Venus ov er very long periods of time. 19 That figure is 583.92 days and it was knitted into the fabric of the Mayan calendar in numerous intricate and complex ways. 20 For example, to reconcile it with the so-called ‘sacred year’ (the tzolkin of 260 days, which was divided into 13 months of 20 days each) the calendar called for a correction of four days to be made every 61 Venus years. In addition, during every fifth cycle, a correction of eight days was made at the end of the 57th revolution. Once these steps were taken, the tzolkin and the synodical revolution of Venus were in termeshed so tightly that the degree of error to which the equation was subject was staggeringly small—one day in 6000 years. 21 And what made this all the more remarkable was that a further series of precisely calculated adjustments kept the Venus cycle and the tzolkin not only in harmony with each other but in exact relationship with the solar year. Again this was achieved in a manner which ensured that the calendar was capable of doing its job, virtually error-free, over vast expanses of time. 22 Why did the ‘semi-civilized’ Maya need this kind of high-tech precision? Or did they inherit, in good working order, a calendar engineered to fit the needs of a much earlier and far more advanced civilization? Consider the crowning jewel of Ma ya calendrics, the so-called ‘Long Count’. This system of calculating da tes also expressed beliefs about the past—notably, the widely held belief that time operated in Great Cycles which witnessed recurrent creations and destructions of the world. According to the Maya, the current Gr eat Cycle began in darkness on 4 Ahau 8 Cumku, a date corresponding to 13 August 3114 BC in our own calendar. 23 As we have seen, it was also believed that the cycle will come  18 The Maya, p. 176. 19 The Rise and Fall of Maya Civilization, p. 170; Mysteries of the Mexican Pyramids, p. 290. 20 The Rise and Fall of Maya Civilization, p. 170. 21 Ibid., 170-1. 22 Ibid., 169. 23 Breaking The Maya Code, p. 275."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 163 to an end, amid global destruction, on 4 Ahau 3 Kankin: 23 December AD 2012 in our calendar. The function of the Long Count was to record the elapse of time since the beginning of the current Great Cycle, literally to count off, one by one, the 5125 years allotted to our present creation. 24 The Long Count is perhaps best envisa ged as a sort of celestial adding machine, constantly calculating an d recalculating the scale of our growing debt to the universe. Every last penny of that debt is going to be called in when the figure on the meter reads 5125. So, at any rate, thought the Maya. Calculations on the Long Count comput er were not, of course, done in our numbers. The Maya used their ow n notation, which they had derived from the Olmecs, who had derived it from ... nobody knows. This notation was a combination of dots (s ignifying ones or units or multiples of twenty), bars (signifying fives or multiples of five times twenty), and a shell glyph signifying zero. Spans of time were counted by days ( kin ), periods of twenty days ( uinat ), ‘computing years’ of 360 days ( tun ), periods of 20 tuns (known as katun ), and periods of 20 katuns (known as bactun ). There were also 8000- tun periods ( pictun ) and 160,000- tun periods ( calabtun ) to mop up even la rger calculations. 25 All this should make clear that al though the Maya believed themselves to be living in one Great Cycle that would surely come to a violent end they also knew that time was infinite and that it proceeded with its mysterious revolutions regardless of individual lives or civilizations. As Thompson summed up in his great study on the subject: In the Maya scheme the road over which time had marched stretched into a past so distant that the mind of man cannot comprehend its remoteness. Yet the Maya undauntedly retrod that road seeking its starting point. A fresh view, leading further backward, unfolded at every stage; the mellowed centuries blended into millennia, and they into tens of thousand s of years, as those tireless inquirers explored deeper and still deeper into the et ernity of the past. On a stela at Quiriga in Guatemala a date over 90 million years ago is computed; on another a date over 300 million years before that is given. These are actual computations, stating correctly day and month positions, and are comparable to calculations in our calendar giving the month positions on which Easter would have fallen at equivalent distances in the past. The brain reels at such astronomical figures ... 26 Isn’t all this a bit avant-garde for a civilization that didn’t otherwise distinguish itself in many ways? It’s true that Mayan architecture was good within its limits.

Only the sacred fire [the material representation of Huehueteotl, the god who gave life its beginning] could be seen in the darkness, still quaking following th e recent chaos. ‘Someone will have to sacrifice himself, throw himself into the fire,’ they cried, ‘only then will there be a Sun.’ 1 A drama ensued in which two deities (Nanahuatzin and Tecciztecatl) immolated themselves for the common good.

Set amid grey-green scrub country, and ringed by distant mountains, these two great monuments played their parts in a symphony of ruins strung out along the axis of the so-called ‘Street of the Dead’. The Citadel lay at the approximate mid point of this wide avenue which ran perfectly straight for more than four kilometres.

His complete thesis was that Teotihuacan had been designed as a kind of ‘map of heaven’: ‘It reproduc ed on earth a supposed celestial plan of the sky-world where dwelt the deities and spirits of the dead.’ 7 During the 1960s and 1970s Hagar’s intu itions were tested in the field by Hugh Harleston Jr., an American engineer resident in Mexico, who carried out a comprehensive mathematical survey at Teotihuacan. Harleston reported his findings in October 1974 at the International Congress of Americanists. 8 His paper, which was full of daring and innovative ideas, contained some pa rticularly curious information about the Citadel and about the Temple of Quetzalcoatl located at the eastern extreme of this great square compound. The Temple was regarded by scholars as one of the best-preserved archaeological monuments in Central America. 9 This was because the original, prehistoric structure had been partially buried beneath another much later mound immediately in front of it to the west. Excavation of that mound had revealed the elegant six-stage pyramid that now confronted me. It stood 72 feet high and its base cove red an area of 82,000 square feet. Still bearing traces of the original multicoloured paints which had coated it in antiquity, the exposed Temple was a beautiful and strange sight. The predominant sculptural mo tif was a series of huge serpent heads protruding three-dimensionally out of the facing blocks and lining the sides of the massive central stai rway. The elongated jaws of these oddly humanoid reptiles were heavily endowed with fangs, and the upper lips with a sort of handlebar moustache. Each serpent’s thick neck was ringed by an elaborate plume of feathers—the unmistakable symbol of Quetzalcoatl. 10 What Harleston’s investigations had shown was that a complex mathematical relationship appear ed to exist among the principal structures lined up along the Street of the Dead (and indeed beyond it).

Even the most conservative estimate of Teotihuacan’ s antiquity, by contrast, suggested that the principal ingredients of the site-plan (including the Citadel, the Street of the Dead and the Pyramids of the Sun and the Moon) must date back at least to the time of Christ. 12 No known civilization of that epoch, either in the Old World or in the New, is supposed to have had any knowledge at all of the outer planets—let alone to have possessed accurate information concerning thei r orbital distances from each other and from the sun. Egypt and Mexico—more coincidences? After completing his studies of the py ramids and avenues of Teotihuacan, Stansbury Hagar concluded: ‘We have not yet realized either the importance or the refinement, or the widespread distribution throughout ancient America, of the astronomical cu lt of which the celestial plan was a feature, and of which Teotihuacan was one of the principal centres.’ 13 But was this just an astronomic al ‘cult’? Or was it something approximating more closely to what we might call a science? And whether cult or science, was it realistic to suppose that it had enjoyed ‘widespread distribution’ only in the Americas when there was so much evidence linking it to other parts of the ancient world? For example, archaeo-astronomers making use of the latest star- mapping computer programmes had recently demonstrated that the three world-famous pyramids on Egyp t’s Giza plateau formed an exact terrestrial diagram of the three belt stars in the constellation of Orion. 14 Nor was this the limit of the celestial map the Ancient Egyptian priests had created in the sands on the west bank of the Nile. Included in their overall vision, as we shall see in Pa rts VI and VII, there was a natural  11 Ibid., pp. 266-9. 12 The Ancient Kingdoms of Mexico, p. 67. 13 Mysteries of the Mexican Pyramids, p. 221. 14 The Orion Mystery."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 169 feature—the river Nile—which was exactl y where it should be had it been designed to represent the Milky Way. 15 The incorporation of a ‘celestial plan’ into key sites in Egypt and Mexico did not by any means exclude religi ous functions. On the contrary, whatever else they may have been intended for it is certain that the monuments of Teotihuacan, like th ose of the Giza plateau, played important religious roles in the lives of the communities they served. Thus Central American traditions co llected in the sixteenth century by Father Bernardino de Sahagun gave el oquent expression to a widespread belief that Teotihuacan had fulfilled at least one specific and important religious function in ancient times. A ccording to these legends the City of the Gods was so known because ‘the Lords therein buried, after their deaths, did not perish but turned into gods ...’ 16 In other words, it was ‘the place where men became gods’. 17 It was additionally known as ‘the place of those who had the road of the gods’, 18 and ‘the place where gods were made’. 19 Was it a coincidence, I wondered, that this seemed to have been the religious purpose of the three pyramids at Giza? The archaic hieroglyphs of the Pyramid Texts, the oldest coherent body of writing in the world, left little room for doubt that the ultimate objective of the rituals carried out within those colossal structures was to bring about the deceased pharaoh’s transfiguration—to ‘throw open the doors of the firmament and to make a road’ so that he might ‘ascend into the company of the gods’. 20 The notion of pyramids as device s designed (presumably in some metaphysical sense) ‘to turn men into gods’ was, it seemed to me, too idiosyncratic and peculiar to have b een arrived at independently in both Ancient Egypt and Mexico. So, too, was the idea of using the layout of sacred sites to incorporate a celestial plan. Moreover, there were other strange similarities that deserved to be considered. Just as at Giza, three pr incipal pyramids had been built at Teotihuacan: the Pyramid/Temple of Quetzalcoatl, the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon. Just as at Giza , the site plan was not symmetrical, as one might have expected, but involved two structures in direct alignment with each other while the third appeared to have been deliberately offset to one side. Finally, at Giza, the summits of the Great Pyramid and the Pyramid of Khafre were level, even though the former was a taller building than the latter. Likewise, at Teotihuacan, the  15 Ibid. 16 Bernardino de Sahagun, cited in Mysteries of the Mexican Pyramids, p. 23. 17 Mexico: Rough Guide, p. 216. 18 The Atlas of Mysterious Places, p. 158. 19 Pre-Hispanic Gods of Mexico, p. 24. 20 The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts, Utt. 667A, p. 281."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 170 summits of the Pyramids of the Sun and the Moon were level even though the former was taller. The reason was the same in both cases: the Great Pyramid was built on lower ground th an the Pyramid of Cephren, and the Pyramid of the Sun on lower ground than the Pyramid of the Moon. 21 Could all this be coincidence? Was it not more logical to conclude that there was an ancient connection between Mexico and Egypt? For reasons I have outlined in Chapters Eighteen and Nineteen I doubted whether any direct, causal li nk was involved—at any rate within historic times. Once again, however, as with the Mayan calendar, and as with the early maps of Antarctica, wa s it not worth keeping an open mind to the possibility that we might be dealing with a legacy: that the pyramids of Egypt and the ruins of Teotihuacan might express the technology, the geographical knowle dge, the observational astronomy (and perhaps also the religion) of a forgotten civilization of the past which had once, as the Popul Vuh claimed, ‘examined the four corners, the four points of the arch of the sky, and the round face of the earth’? There was widespread agreement among academics concerning the antiquity of the Giza pyramids, thought to be about 4500 years old. 22 No such unanimity existed with regard to Teotihuacan. Neither the Street of the Dead, nor the Temple of Quetzalcoatl, nor the Pyramids of the Sun and the Moon had ever b een definitively dated. 23 The majority of scholars believed that the city had flourished between 100 BC and AD 600, but others argued strongly that it mu st have risen to prominence much earlier, between 1500 and 1000 BC . There were others still who sought, largely on geological grounds, to pu sh the foundation date back to 4000 BC before the eruption of the nearby volcano Xitli. 24 Amid all this uncertainty about the age of Teotihuacan, I had not been surprised to discover that no one had the faintest idea of the identity of those who had actually built the largest and most remarkable metropolis ever to have existed in the pre-Colombian New World. 25 All that could be said for sure was this: when the Aztecs , on their march to imperial power, first stumbled upon the mysterious city in the twelfth century AD , its colossal edifices and avenues were al ready old beyond imagining and so densely overgrown that they seemed more like natural features than works of man. 26 Attached to them, however, was a thread of local legend, passed down from generation to generation, which asserted that they had been built by giants 27 and that their purpose ha d been to transform men into gods.  21 The Ancient Kingdoms Of Mexico, p. 74; The Traveller’s Key To Ancient Egypt, pp. 110- 35. 22 See, for example, Ahmed Fakhry, The Pyramids, University of Chicago Press, 1969. 23 Mysteries of the Mexican Pyramids, pp. 230-3. 24 Ibid. 25 The Prehistory of the Americas, p. 282. 26 Mysteries of ‘the Mexican Pyramids, pp. 11-12. 27 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 171 Hints of forgotten wisdom Leaving the Temple of Quetzalcoatl be hind me, I recrossed the Citadel in a westerly direction. There was no archaeological evidence that this enormous enclosure had ever served as a citadel—or, for that matter, that it had any kind of military or defensive function at all. Like so much else about Teotihuacan it had clearly been planned with pa instaking care, and executed with enormous effort, but its true purpose remained unidentified by modern scholarship. 28 Even the Aztecs, who had been responsible for naming the Pyramids of the Sun and the Moon (a n attribution which had stuck though no one had any idea what the original builders had called them) had failed to invent a name for the Citadel. It had been left to the Spaniards to label it as they did—an understandable conceit since the 30-acre central patio of La Ciudadela was surrounde d by massively thick embankments more than 23 feet high and some 1500 feet long on each side. 29 My walk had now brought me to th e western extreme of the patio. I climbed a steep set of stairs that le d to the top of the embankment and turned north on to the Street of the Dead. Once again I had to remind myself that this was almost certainly not what the Teotihuacanos (whoever they were) had called the immense and impressive avenue. The Spanish name Calle de los Muertos was of Aztec origin, apparently based on speculation that the numerous mounds on either side of the Street were graves (which, as it happened, they were not). 30 We have already considered the possibility that the Way of the Dead may have served as a terrestrial counte rpart of the Milky Way. Of interest in this regard is the work of anot her American, Alfred E. Schlemmer, who—like Hugh Harleston Jr.—was an engineer. Schlemmer’s field was technological forecasting, with specif ic reference to the prediction of earthquakes, 31 on which he presented a pape r at the Eleventh National Convention of Chemical Engineers (in Mexico City in October 1971). Schlemmer’s argument was that the Street of the Dead might never have been a street at all. Instead, it might originally have been laid out as a row of linked reflecting pools, f illed with water which had descended through a series of locks from the Py ramid of the Moon, at the northern extreme, to the Citadel in the south. As I walked steadily northward towards the still-distant Moon Pyramid, it seemed to me that this theory ha d several points in its favour. For a start the ‘Street’ was blocked at regular intervals by high partition walls, at the foot of which the remains of well-made sluices could clearly be seen. Moreover, the lie of the land would have facilitated a north-south  28 Ibid., p. 213. 29 Ibid. 30 The Ancient Kingdoms of Mexico, p. 72. 31 Mysteries of the Mexican Pyramids, pp. 271-2."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 172 hydraulic flow since the base of the Moon Pyramid stood on ground that was approximately 100 feet higher than the area in front of the Citadel. The partitioned sections could easily have been filled with water and might indeed have served as reflecti ng pools, creating a spectacle far more dramatic than those offered by the Taj Mahal or the fabled Shalimar Gardens. Finally, the Teotihuacan Mapping Project (financed by the National Science Foundation in Washin gton DC and led by Professor Rene Millon of the University of Rochester) had demonstrated conclusively that the ancient city had possessed ‘many carefully laid-out canals and systems of branching waterways, artificially dredged into straightened portions of a river, which formed a network within Teotihuacan and ran all the way to [Lake Texcoco], now ten miles distant but perhaps closer in antiquity’. 32 There was much argument about what this vast hydraulic system had been designed to do. Schlemmer’s contention was that the particular waterway he had identified had been built to serve a pragmatic purpose as ‘a long-range seismic monitor’—par t of ‘an ancient science, no longer understood’. 33 He pointed out that remote earthquakes ‘can cause standing waves to form on a liquid surface right across the planet’ and suggested that the carefully graded and spaced reflecting pools of the Street of the Dead might have been designed ‘to enable Teotihuacanos to read from the standing waves formed there the location and strength of earthquakes around the globe, thus allowing them to predict such an occurrence in their own area’. 34   32 Ibid., p. 232. 33 Ibid., p. 272. 34 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 173 Reconstruction of Teotihuacan, looking down the Way of the Dead from behind the Pyramid of the Moon.

There was, of course, no proof of Schlemmer’s theory. However, when I remembered the fixation with earthquakes and floods apparent everywhere in Mexican mythology, and the equally obsessive concern with forecasting future events eviden t in the Maya calendar, I felt less inclined to dismiss the apparently far-fetched conclusions of the American engineer. If Schlemmer were right, if the ancient Teotihuacanos had indeed understood the principles of resonant vibration and had put them into practice in seismic foreca sting, the implication was that they were the possessors of an advanced sc ience. And if people like Hagar and Harleston were right—if, for example, a scale-model of the solar system had also been built into the basic geometry of Teotihuacan—this too suggested that the city was founded by a scientifically evolved civilization not yet identified.

Among this latter category must be included the thick and extensive layer of sheet mica found sandwiched between two of the upper levels of the Teotihuacan Pyramid of the Sun when it was being probed for restoration in 1906. The lack of interest which greeted this discovery, and the ab sence of any follow-up studies to determine its possible function is qu ite understandable because the mica, which had a considerable commercial value, was removed and sold as soon as it had been excavated. Th e culprit was apparently Leopoldo Bartres, who had been commissioned to restore the time-worn pyramid by the Mexican government. 1 There has also been a much more recent discovery of mica at Teotihuacan (in the ‘Mica Temple’) and this too has passed almost without notice. Here the reason is harder to explain because there has been no looting and the mica remains on site. 2 One of a group of buildings, the Mica Temple is situated around a patio about 1000 feet south of the west face of the Pyramid of the Sun. Directly under a floor paved with heavy rock sl abs, archaeologists financed by the Viking Foundation excavated two massi ve sheets of mica which had been carefully and purposively installed at some extremely remote date by a people who must have been skilled in cutting and handlin g this material. The sheets are ninety feet square and form two layers, one laid directly on top of the other. 3 Mica is not a uniform substance but contains trace elements of different metals depending on the kind of rock formation in which it is found. Typically these metals include pota ssium and aluminum and also, in varying quantities, ferrous and fe rric iron, magnesium, lithium, manganese and titanium. The trace elements in Teotihuacan’s Mica Temple indicate that the underfloor sheets belong to a type which occurs only in Brazil, some 2000 miles away. 4 Clearly, therefore, the builders of the Temple must have had a specific need for this particular kind of mica and were prepared to go to consider able lengths to obtain it, otherwise they could have used the locally available variety more cheaply and simply. Mica does not leap to mind as an obvious general-purpose flooring  1 Mysteries of the Mexican Pyramids, p. 202. 2 Ibid.

Its use to form layers underneath a floor, and thus completely out of sight, seems especially bizarre when we remember that no other ancient structure in the Americas, or anywhere else in the world, has been found to contain a feature like this. 5 It is frustrating that we will never be able to establish the exact position, let alone the purpose, of th e large sheet that Bartres excavated and removed from the Pyramid of the Sun in 1906. The two intact layers in the Mica Temple, on the other hand, resting as they do in a place where they had no decorative function, look as though they were designed to do a particular job. Let us note in passing that mica possesses characteristics which suit it especially well for a range of technological applications. In mode rn industry, it is used in the construction of capacitors and is valued as a thermal and electric insulator. It is also opaque to fast neutrons and can act as a moderator in nuclear reactions. Erasing messages from the past Pyramid of the Sun, Teotihuacan Having climbed more than 200 feet up a series of flights of stone stairs I reached the summit and looked towa rds the zenith. It was midday 19 May, and the sun was directly overhead , as it would be again on 25 July. On these two dates, and not by accident, the west face of the pyramid was oriented precisely to the position of the setting sun. 6 A more curious but equally deliberate effect could be observed on the equinoxes, 20 March and 22 September. Then the passage of the sun’s rays from south to north resulted at noon in the progressive obliteration of a perfectly straight shadow that ran along one of the lower stages of the western façade. The whole process, from complete shadow to complete illumination, took exactly 66. 6 seconds. It had done so without fail, year-in year-out, ever since the pyramid had been built and would continue to do so until the giant edifice crumbled into dust. 7 What this meant, of course, was that at least one of the many functions of the pyramid had been to serve as a ‘perennial clock’, precisely signalling the equinoxes and thus facilitating calendar corrections as and when necessary for a people apparently obsessed, like the Maya, with the elapse and measuring of time. Another implication was that the master- builders of Teotihuacan must have possessed an enormous body of astronomic and geodetic data and refe rred to this data to set the Sun Pyramid at the precise orientation necessary to achieve the desired equinoctial effects.  5 The Pyramids of Teotihuacan, p. 16. 6 Mexico: Rough Guide, p. 217. 7 Mysteries of the Mexican Pyramids, p. 252."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 176 This was planning and architecture of a high order. It had survived the passage of the millennia and it had su rvived the wholesale remodelling of much of the pyramid’s outer shell co nducted in the first decade of the twentieth century by the self-styled rest orer, Leopoldo Bart res. In addition to plundering precious evidence that might have helped us towards a better understanding of the purposes for which the enigmatic structure had been built, this repulsive lackey of Mexico’s corrupt dictator Porfirio Diaz had removed the outer layer of stone, mortar and plaster to a depth of more than twenty feet from the entire northern, eastern and southern faces. The result was catastrophic: th e underlying adobe surface began to dissolve in heavy rains and to exhibi t plastic flow which threatened to destroy the whole edifice. Although the slippage was halted with hasty remedial measures, nothing could chan ge the fact that the Sun Pyramid had been deprived of almost all its original surface features. By modern archaeological standards this was, of course, an unforgivable act of desecration. Because of it, we will never learn the significance of the many sculptures, inscriptions, reliefs and artefacts that had almost certainly been removed with those twenty feet of the outer shell. Nor was this the only or even the most regrettable consequence of Bartres’s grotesque vandalism. Th ere was startling evidence which suggested that the unknown architects of the Pyramid of the Sun might have intentionally incorporated scie ntific data into many of the key dimensions of the great structure. Th is evidence had been gathered and extrapolated from the intact west face (which, not accidentally, was also the face where the intended equinoctial effects could still be seen), but thanks to Bartres, no similar inform ation was likely to be forthcoming from the other three faces because of the arbitrary alterations imposed upon them. Indeed, by drastically distor ting the original shape and size of so much of the pyramid, the Mexican ‘restorer’ had possibly deprived posterity of some of the most important lessons Teotihuacan had to teach. Eternal numbers The transcendental number known as pi is fundamental to advanced mathematics. With a value slightly in excess of 3.14 it is the ratio of the diameter of a circle to its circumferenc e. In other words if the diameter of a circle is 12 inches, the circumferenc e of that circle will be 12 inches x 3.14 = 37.68 inches. Likewise, since the diameter of a circle is exactly double the radius, we can use pi to calculate the circumference of any circle from its radius. In this case, however, the formula is the length of the radius multiplied by 2pi. As an illustration let us take again a circle of 12 inches diameter. Its radius will be 6 inches and its circumference can be obtained as follows: 6 inches x 2 x 3.14 = 37.68 inches. Similarly a circle with a radius of 10 inches will have a circumfere nce of 67.8 inches"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 177 (10 inches x 2 x 3.14) and a circle with a radius of 7 inches will have a circumference of 43.96 inches (7 inches x 2 x 3.14). These formulae using the value of pi for calculating circumference from either diameter or radius apply to all circles, no matter how large or how small, and also, of course, to all spheres and hemispheres. They seem relatively simple—with hindsight. Yet their discovery, which represented a revolutionary breakthrough in mathematics, is thought to have been made late in human history. The orthodox view is that Archimedes in the third century BC was the first man to calculate pi correctly at 3.14. 8 Scholars do not accept that any of the mathematicians of the New World ever got anywhere near pi before the arrival of the Europeans in the sixteenth century. It is therefore disorienting to discover that the Great Pyramid at Giza (built more than 2000 years before the birth of Archimedes) and the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan, which vastly predates the conquest, both incorporate the value of pi. They do so, moreover, in much the same way, an d in a manner which leaves no doubt that the ancient builders on both sides of the Atlantic were thoroughly conversant with this transcendental number. The principal factors involved in th e geometry of any pyramid are (1) the height of the summit above the ground, and (2) the perimeter of the monument at ground level. Where th e Great Pyramid is concerned, the ratio between the original height (481.3949 feet 9 ) and the perimeter (3023.16 feet 10 ) turns out to be the same as the ratio between the radius and the circumference of a circle, i.e. 2pi . 11 Thus, if we take the pyramid’s height and multiply it by 2pi (as we would with a circle’s radius to calculate its circumference) we ge t an accurate read-out of the monument’s perimeter (481.3949 feet 2 x 3.14 = 3023.16 feet). Alternatively, if we turn the eq uation around and start with the circumference at ground level, we get an equally accurate read-out of the height of the summit (3023.16 feet divided by 2 divided by 3.14 = 481.3949 feet). Since it is almost inconceivable that such a precise mathematical correlation could have come about by chance, we are obliged to conclude that the builders of the Great Pyramid were indeed conversant with pi and that they deliberately incorporated it s value into the dimensions of their monument. Now let us consider the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan. The angle of its sides is 43.5° 12 (as opposed to 52° in the case of the Great Pyramid 13 ). The Mexican monument has the gentler slope because the perimeter of  8 Encyclopaedia Britannica, 9:415. 9 I. E. S. Edwards, The Pyramids of Egypt, Penguin, London, 1949, p. 87. 10 Ibid. 11 Ibid., p. 219. 12 Mysteries of the Mexican Pyramids, p. 55. 13 The Pyramids of Egypt, pp. 87, 219."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 178 its base, at 2932.8 feet, 14 is not much smaller than that of its Egyptian counterpart while its summit is cons iderably lower (approximately 233.5 feet prior to Bartres’s, ‘restoration’ 15 ). The 2pi formula that worked at the Great Pyramid does not work with these measurements. A 4pi formula does. Thus if we take the height of the Pyramid of the Sun (233.5 feet) and multiply it by 4pi we once again obtain a very accurate read-out of th e perimeter: 233.5 feet x 4 x 3.14 = 2932.76 feet (a discrepancy of less than half an inch from the true figure of 2932.8 feet). This, surely, can no more be a coincidence than the pi relationship extrapolated from the dimensions of the Egyptian monument. Moreover, the very fact that both structures incorporate pi relationships (when none of the other pyramids on either si de of the Atlantic does) strongly suggests not only the existence of ad vanced mathematical knowledge in antiquity but some sort of underlying common purpose. The height of the Pyramid of the Sun x 4pi = the perimeter of its base. The height of the Great Pyramid at Giza x 2 pi = the perimeter of its base. As we have seen the desired height/perimeter ratio of the Great  14 The Ancient Kingdoms of Mexico, p. 74. 15 Mexico, p. 201; The Atlas of Mysterious Places, p. 156."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 179 Pyramid ( 2pi ) called for the specification of a tricky and idiosyncratic angle of slope for its sides: 52°. Likewise, the desired height/perimeter ratio of the Pyramid of the Sun ( 4pi ) called for the specification of an equally eccentric angle of slope: 43.5°. If there had been no ulterior motive, it would surely have been simpler for the Ancient Egyptian and Mexican architects to have opted for 45° (which they could easily have obtained and checked by bisecting a right angle). What could have been the commo n purpose that led the pyramid builders on both sides of the Atlantic to such lengths to structure the value of pi so precisely into these two remarkable monuments? Since there seems to have been no direct contact between the civilizations of Mexico and Egypt in the periods when the pyramids were built, is it not reasonable to deduce that both, at some remote date, inherited certain ideas from a common source? Is it possible that the shared idea expressed in the Great Pyramid and the Pyramid of the Sun could have to do with spheres, since these, like the pyramids, are three-dimensional objects (while circles, for example, have only two dimensions)? The desi re to symbolize spheres in three- dimensional monuments with flat surfaces would explain why so much trouble was taken to ensure that both incorporated unmistakable pi relationships. Furthermore it seems likely that the intention of the builders of both of these monuments was not to symbolize spheres in general but to focus attention on one sphere in particular: the planet earth. It will be a long while before orth odox archaeologists are prepared to accept that some peoples of the anci ent world were advanced enough in science to have possessed good information about the shape and size of the earth. However, according to the calculations of Livio Catullo Stecchini, an American professor of the History of Science and an acknowledged expert on ancient measurement, the evidence for the existence of such anomalous knowle dge in antiquity is irrefutable. 16 Stecchini’s conclusions, which relate mainly to Egypt, are particularly impressive because they are drawn from mathematical and astronomical data which, by common consent, are beyond serious dispute. 17 A fuller examination of these conclusions, and of the nature of the data on which they rest, is presented in Part VII. At this point, however, a few words from Stecchini may shed further light on the mystery that confronts us: The basic idea of the Great Pyramid was that it should be a representation of the northern hemisphere of the earth, a hemisphere projected on flat-surfaces as is done in map-making ... The Great Pyramid was a projection on four triangular surfaces. The apex represented the pole and the perimeter represented the equator. This is the reason why the perimeter is in relation 2pi to the height. The  16 The most accessible presentation of Stecch ini’s work is in the appendix he wrote for Peter Tompkins, Secrets of the Great Pyramid, pp. 287-382. 17 See The Traveller’s Key to Ancient Egypt, p. 95."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 180 Great Pyramid represents the northern hemisphere in a scale of 1:43,200. 18 In Part VII we shall see why this scale was chosen. Mathematical city Rising up ahead of me as I walked to wards the northern end of the Street of the Dead, the Pyramid of the Moon, mercifully undamaged by restorers, had kept its original form as a four-stage ziggurat. The Pyramid of the Sun, too, had consisted of fo ur stages but Bartres had whimsically sculpted in a fifth stage between the original third and fourth levels. There was, however, one original feature of the Pyramid of the Sun that Bartres had been unable to despoil: a subterranean passageway leading from a natural cave under the west fa ce. After its accidental discovery in 1971 this passageway was thoroughly explored. Seven feet high, it was found to run eastwards for more than 300 feet until it reached a point close to the pyramid’s geometrical centre. 19 Here it debouched into a second cave, of spacious dimensions, which had been artificially enlarged into a shape very similar to that of a four-leaf clover. The ‘leaves’ were chambers, each about sixty feet in ci rcumference, containing a variety of artefacts such as beautifully engrav ed slate discs an d highly polished mirrors. There was also a complex dr ainage system of interlocking segments of carved rock pipes. 20 This last feature was particularly puzzling because there was no known source of water within the pyramid. 21 The sluices, however, left little doubt that water must have been present in antiquity, most probably in large quantities. This brought to mind the evidence for water having once run in the Street of the Dead, the sl uices and partition walls I had seen earlier to the north of the Citadel, and Schlemmer’s theory of reflecting pools and seismic forecasting. Indeed, the more I thought about it the more it seemed that water had been the dominant motif at Teotihuaca n. Though I had hardly registered it that morning, the Temple of Quet zalcoatl had been decorated not only with effigies of the Plumed Serpent but with unmistakable aquatic symbolism, notably an undulating design suggestive of waves and large numbers of beautiful carvings of se ashells. With these images in my mind, I reached the wide plaza at th e base of the Pyramid of the Moon and imagined it filled with water, as it might have been, to a depth of about ten feet. It would have looked magnificent: majestic, powerful and  18 Stecchini, in appendix to Secrets of the Great Pyramid, p. 378.

The Akapana Pyramid in far-off Tiahuanaco had also been surrounded by water, which had been the domina nt motif there—just as I now found it to be at Teotihuacan. I began to climb the Pyramid of th e Moon. It was smaller than the Pyramid of the Sun, indeed less than half the size, and was estimated to be made up of about one million tons of stone and earth, as against two and a half million tons in the case of the Pyramid of the Sun. The two monuments, in other words, had a co mbined weight of three and a half million tons. It was thought unlikely th at this quantity of material could have been manipulated by fewer than 15,000 men and it was calculated that such a workforce would have take n at least thirty years to complete such an enormous task. 22 Sufficient labourers would certainly have been available in the vicinity: the Teotihuacan Mapping Project had demonstrated that the population of the city in its heyday could have been as large as 200,000, making it a bigger metropolis than Imperial Rome of the Caesars. The Project had also established that the main monu ments visible today covered just a small part of the overall area of anci ent Teotihuacan. At its peak the city had extended across more than twelve square miles and had incorporated some 50,000 individual dwellings in 2000 apartment compounds, 600 subsidiary pyramids and temples, and 500 ‘factory’ areas specializing in ceramic, figurine, lapidary, shell, basalt, slate and ground-stone work. 23 At the top level of the Pyramid of th e Moon I paused and turned slowly around. Across the valley floor, which sloped gently downhill to the south, the whole of Teotihuacan now stretched before me—a geometrical city, designed and built by unknown architects in the time before history began. In the east, overlooking the arrow-straight Street of the Dead, loomed the Pyramid of the Sun, eternally ‘printing out’ the mathematical message it had been programmed with long ages ago, a message which seemed to direct our attention to the shape of the earth. It almost looked as though the civilization that had built Teotihuacan had made a deliberate choice to encode complex information in enduring monuments and to do it using a mathematical language. Why a mathematical language? Perhaps because, no matter what extreme changes and transformations human civilization might go through, the radius of a circle multiplied by 2pi (or half the radius multiplied by 4pi ) would always give the correct figure for that circle’s circumferenc e. In other words, a mathematical language could have been chosen for practical reasons: unlike any verbal tongue, such a code could always be deciphered, even by people from  22 The Riddle of the Pyramids, pp. 188-93. 23 The Prehistory of the Americas, p. 281.

Not for the first time I felt myself confronted by the dizzying possibility that an entire episode in the story of mankind might have been forgotten. Indeed it seemed to me then, as I overlooked the mathematical city of the gods from the summit of the Pyramid of the Moon, that our species could have been afflicted with some terribl e amnesia and that the dark period so blithely and dismissively referred to as ‘prehistory’ might turn out to conceal unimagined truths about our own past.

Where do these myths come from? Why, though they derive from unrelated cultures, are their storylines so similar? why are they laden with common symbolism? and why do they so often share the same stock characters and plots? If they are indeed memories, why are there no historical records of the planetary disaster they seem to refer to? Could it be that the myths themselves are historical records? Could it be that these cunning and immortal stories, composed by anonymous geniuses, were the medium used to record such information and pass it on in the time before history began? And the ark went upon th e face of the waters There was a king, in ancient Sumer, who sought eternal life. His name was Gilgamesh. We know of his exploits because the myths and traditions of Mesopotamia, inscribed in cuneifor m script upon tablets of baked clay, have survived. Many thousands of thes e tablets, some dating back to the beginning of the third millennium BC , have been excavated from the sands of modern Iraq. They transmit a unique picture of a vanished culture and remind us that even in those days of lofty antiquity human beings preserved memories of times still more remote—times from which they were separated by the interv al of a great and terrible deluge: I will proclaim to the world the deeds of Gilgamesh. This was the man to whom all things were known; this was the king who knew the countries of the world. He was wise, he saw mysteries and knew secret things, he brought us a tale of the days before the flood. He went on a long journey, was weary, worn-out with labour, returning he rested, he engraved on a stone the whole story. 1 The story that Gilgamesh brought back had been told to him by a certain Utnapishtim, a king who had ruled th ousands of years earlier, who had survived the great flood, and who had been rewarded with the gift of immortality because he had preserved the seeds of humanity and of all living things. It was long, long ago, said Utnapish tim, when the gods dwelt on earth: Anu, lord of the firmament, Enlil, the enforcer of divine decisions, Ishtar,  1 The Epic of Gilgamesh, Penguin Classics, London, 1988, p. 61."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 185 goddess of war and sexual love and Ea , lord of the waters, man’s natural friend and protector. In those days the world teemed, the peop le multiplied, the world bellowed like a wild bull, and the great god was aroused by the clamour. Enlil heard the clamour and he said to the gods in council, ‘The uproar of mankind is intolerable and sleep is no longer possible by reason of the ba bel.’ So the gods agreed to exterminate mankind.’ 2 Ea, however, took pity on Utnapishtim. Speaking through the reed wall of the king’s house he told him of the imminent catastrophe and instructed him to build a boat in which he and his family could survive: Tear down your house and build a boat, abandon possessions and look for life, despise wordly goods and save your soul ... Tear down your house, I say, and build a boat with her dimensions in prop ortion—her width and length in harmony. Put aboard the seed of all living things, into the boat. 3 In the nick of time Utnapishtim built the boat as ordered. ‘I loaded into her all that I had,’ he sa id, ‘loaded her with the seed of all living things’: I put on board all my kith and kin, put on board cattle, wild beasts from open country, all kinds of craftsmen ... The time was fulfilled. When the first light of dawn appeared a black cloud came up from the base of the sky; it thundered within where Adad, lord of the storm was riding ... A stupor of despair went up to heaven when the god of the storm turned daylight to darkness, when he smashed the land like a cup ... On the first day the tempest blew swiftly and brought the flood ... No man could see his fellow. Nor could the people be di stinguished from the sky. Even the gods were afraid of the flood. They withdrew; they went up to the heaven of Anu and crouched in the outskirts. The gods cowere d like curs while Ishtar cried, shrieking aloud, ‘Have I given birth unto these mine own people only to glut with their bodies the sea as though they were fish?’ 4 Meanwhile, continued Utnapishtim: For six days and nights the wind blew, torrent and tempest and flood overwhelmed the world, tempest and flood raged together like warring hosts. When the seventh day dawned the storm from the south subsided, the sea grew calm, the flood was stilled. I looked at the face of the world and there was silence. The surface of the sea stretched as flat as a roof-top. All mankind had returned to clay ... I opened a hatch and light fell on my face. Then I bowed low, I sat down and I wept, the tears streamed down my face, for on every side was the waste of water ... Fourteen leagues distant there appeared a mountain, and there the boat grounded; on the mountain of Nisir the boat held fast, she held fast and did not budge ... When the seventh day dawned I loosed a dove and let her go. She flew away, but finding no resting place she returned. Then I loosed a swallow, and she flew away but finding no resting place she returned. I loosed a raven, she saw that the waters had retreated, she ate, she flew around, she cawed, and she did not  2 Ibid., p. 108. 3 Ibid., and Myths from Mesopotamia, p. 110. 4 Myths from Mesopotamia, pp. 112-13; Gilgamesh, pp. 109-11; Edmund Sollberger, The Babylonian Legend of the Flood, British Museum Publications, 1984, p. 26."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 186 come back. 5 Utnapishtim knew that it was now safe to disembark: I poured out a libation on the mountain top ...

In other tablets—some almost 5000 years old, others less than 3000 years old—the ‘Noah figure’ of Utnapishtim is known variously as Zisudra, Xisuthros or Atrahasis. Even so, he is always instantly recognizable as the same pa triarchal character, forewarned by the same merciful god, who rides out the same universal flood in the same storm-tossed ark and whose de scendants repopulate the world. There are many obvious resembla nces between the Mesopotamian flood myth and the famous biblic al story of Noah and the deluge 7 (see  5 Gilgamesh, p. 111. 6 Ibid. 7 Extracts from the Book of Genesis, Chapters Six, Seven and Eight: God saw that the wickedness of man was grea t in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil co ntinually. And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved hi m at his heart ... And God said, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is f illed with violence ... And behold I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under heaven; and everything that is in the earth shall die. Saving only Noah and his family (whom he instructed to build a great survival ship 450 feet long x 75 feet wide x 45 feet high), an d ordering the Hebrew patriarch to gather together breeding pairs of every living creature so that they too might be saved, the Lord then sent the flood: In the selfsame day entered Noah and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the wives of his sons with them, into the Ark—they and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his ki nd, every bird of every sort. And they went in unto Noah into the Ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life. And they that went in, went in male and female of a ll flesh, as God had commanded, and the Lord shut them in. And the flood was upon the earth; and the waters increased and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth. And the wate rs prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the fa ce of the waters. And the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered ... And every man was destroyed, all in whose nostrils was the breath of life, and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark. In due course, ‘in the seventh month in the seventeenth day of the month, the Ark came to rest upon the mountains of Ararat. And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month’: And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth. Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth. And he stayed yet another seven days; and ag ain he sent forth the dove out of the ark."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 187 note). Scholars argue endlessly about the nature of these resemblances. What really matters, however, is that in each sphere of influence the same solemn tradition has been preserved for posterity—a tradition which tells, in graphic language, of a global catastrophe and of the near-total annihilation of mankind. Central America The identical message was preserved in the Valley of Mexico, far away across the world from Mounts Ararat and Nisir. There, culturally and geographically isolated from Judaeo -Christian influences, long ages before the arrival of the Spaniards, st ories were told of a great deluge. As the reader will recall from Part III, it was believed that this deluge had swept over the entire earth at the en d of the Fourth Sun: ‘Destruction came in the form of torrential rain and floods. The mountains disappeared and men were tr ansformed into fish ...’ 8 According to Aztec mythology only two human beings survived: a man, Coxcoxtli, and his wife, Xochiquetzal , who had been forewarned of the cataclysm by a god. They escape d in a huge boat they had been instructed to build and came to ground on the peak of a tall mountain. There they descended and afterwards had many children who were dumb until the time when a dove on top of a tree gave them the gift of languages. These languages differed so much that the children could not understand one another. 9 A related Central American tradition, that of the Mechoacanesecs, is in even more striking conformity with the story as we have it in Genesis and in the Mesopotamian sources. According to this tradition, the god Tezcatlipoca determined to destroy all mankind with a flood, saving only a certain Tezpi who embarked in a spacious vessel with his wife, his children and large numbers of animals and birds, as well as supplies of grains and seeds, the preservation of which were essential to the future subsistence of the human race. The vessel came to rest on an exposed mountain top after Tezcatilpoca had decreed that the waters of the flood should retire. Wishing to find out whether it was now safe for him to disembark, Tezpi sent out a vulture wh ich, feeding on the carcasses with which the earth was now strewn, did not return. The man then sent out other birds, of which only the hu mmingbird came back, with a leafy branch in its beak. With this sign that the land had begun to renew itself,     And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off; so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth ... And Noah went forth ... and builded an altar unto th e Lord, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. And the Lord smel led the sweet savour ... 8 Maya History and Religion, p. 332. 9 Sir J. G.

According to this arch aic text, the Great God decided to create humanity soon afte r the beginning of time. It was an experiment and he began it with ‘figures made of wood that looked like men and talked like men’. These crea tures fell out of favour because ‘they did not remember their Creator’: And so a flood was brought about by th e Heart of Heaven; a great flood was formed which fell on the heads of the wood en creatures ... A heavy resin fell from the sky ... the face of the earth was darken ed and a black rain began to fall by day and by night ... The wooden figures were annihilated, destroyed, broken up and killed.’ 11 Not everyone perished, however. Like the Aztecs and the Mechoacanesecs, the Maya of the Yucatan and Guatemala believed that a Noah figure and his wife, ‘the Grea t Father and the Great Mother’, had survived the flood to populate th e land anew, thus becoming the ancestors of all subsequent generations of humanity. 12 South America Moving to South America, we encoun ter the Chibcas of central Colombia. According to their myths, they had or iginally lived as savages, without laws, agriculture or religion. Then one day there appeared among them an old man of a different race. He wo re a thick long beard and his name was Bochica. He taught th e Chibcas how to build huts and live together in society. His wife, who was very beautiful and named Chia, appeared after him, but she was wicked and enjoyed th warting her husband’s altruistic efforts. Since she could not overco me his power directly, she used magical means to cause a great flood in which the majority of the population died. Bochica was very angr y and exiled Chia from the earth to the sky, where she became the moon given the task of lighting the nights. He also caused the waters of the flood to dissipate and brought down the few survivors from the mountains where they had taken refuge. Thereafter he gave them laws, taught them to cultivate the land and instituted the worship of the sun with periodic festivals, sacrifices and pilgrimages. He then divided the po wer to govern among two chiefs and spent the remainder of his days on ea rth living in quiet contemplation as  10 Lenormant, writing in Contemporary Review, cited in Atlantis: The Antediluvian World, p. 99. 11 Popol Vuh, p. 90. 12 Ibid., p. 93."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 189 an ascetic. When he ascended to heaven he became a god. 13 Farther south still, the Canarians, an Indian tribe of Ecuador, relate an ancient story of a flood from which tw o brothers escaped by going to the top of a high mountain. As the water rose the mountain grew higher, so that the two brothers survived the disaster. 14 When they were discovered, the Tupi namba Indians of Brazil venerated a series of civilizing or creator heroes. The first of these heroes was Monan (ancient, old) who was said to have been the creator of mankind but who then destroyed the wo rld with flood and fire ... 15 Peru, as we saw in Part II, is particul arly rich in flood legends. A typical story tells of an Indian who was warned by a llama of a deluge. Together man and llama fled to a high mountain called Vilca-Coto: When they reached the top of the mountain they saw that all kinds of birds and animals had already taken refuge there. The sea began to rise, and covered all the plains and mountains except the top of Vilca-Coto; and even there the waves dashed up so high that the animals were forced to crowd into a narrow area ... Five days later the water ebbed, and the sea returned to its bed. But all human beings except one were drowned, and from him are descended all the nations on earth. 16 The Araucnaians of pre-Colombian Chile preserved a tradition that there was once a flood which very few In dians escaped. The survivors took refuge on a high mountain called Thegtheg (‘the thundering’ or ‘the glittering’) which had three peaks and the ability to float on water. 17 In the far south of the continent a Ya mana legend from Tierra del Fuego states: ‘The moon woman caused the flood. This was at the time of the great upheaval ... Moon was filled wi th hatred towards human beings ... At that time everybody drowned with the exception of those few who were able to escape to the five mo untain peaks that the water did not cover.’ 18 Another Tierra del Fuegan tribe, the Pehuenche, associate the flood with a prolonged period of darkness: ‘The sun and the moon fell from the sky and the world stayed that way, without light, until finally two giant condors carried both the sun and the moon back up to the sky.’ 19  13 New Larousse Encyclopaedia of Mythology, p. 440; Atlantis: the Antediluvian World, p. 105. 14 Folklore in the Old Testament, p. 104. 15 New Larousse Encyclopaedia of Mythology, p. 445. 16 Folklore in the Old Testament, p. 105. 17 Ibid., p. 101. 18 John Bierhorst, The Mythology of South America, William Morrow & Co., New York, 1988, p. 165. 19 Ibid., pp. 165-6."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 190 North America Meanwhile, at the other end of the Americas, among the Inuit of Alaska, there existed the tradition of a te rrible flood, accompanied by an earthquake, which swept so rapidly over the face of the earth that only a few people managed to escape in their canoes or take refuge on the tops of the highest mountains, petrified with terror. 20 The Luiseno of lower California had a legend that a flood covered the mountains and destroyed most of mankind. Only a few were saved because they fled to the highest peaks which were spared when all the rest of the world was inundated. The survivors remained there until the flood ended. 21 Farther north similar flood myths were recorded amongst the Hurons. 22 And a legend of the Montagnais, belonging to the Algonquin family, related how Michabo, or the Great Hare, re-established the world after the flood with the help of a raven, an otter and a muskrat. 23 Lynd’s History of the Dakotas, an authoritative work of the nineteenth century which preserved many indigeno us traditions that would otherwise have been lost, reports an Iroquois my th that ‘the sea and waters had at one time infringed upon the land, so that all hum an life was destroyed’.

The Sioux also spoke of a time when there was no dry land and when all men disappeared from existence. 24 Water water everywhere How far and how widely across the my th memories of mankind do the ripples of the gr eat flood spread? Very widely indeed. More than 500 deluge legends are known around the world and, in a survey of 86 of these (20 Asiatic, 3 European, 7 African, 46 American and 10 from Australia and the Pacific), the specialist researcher Dr Richard Andree co ncluded that 62 were entirely independent of the Mesopotamian and Hebrew accounts. 25  20 New Larousse Encyclopaedia of Mythology, p. 426. 21 Folklore in the Old Testament, pp. 111-12. 22 New Larousse Encyclopaedia of Mythology, p. 431. 23 Ibid., pp. 428-9; Folklore in the Old Testament, p. 115.

This great book included a number of traditions which told of the consequences that followed ‘when mankind rebelled against the high gods and the system of the universe fell into disorder’: ‘The planets alte red their courses. The sky sank lower towards the north. The sun, moon an d stars changed their motions. The earth fell to pieces and the waters in its bosom rushed upwards with violence and overflowed the earth.’ 26 In the Malaysian tropical forest th e Chewong people believe that every so often their own world, which they call Earth Seven, turns upside down so that everything is flooded and destroyed. However, through the agency of the Creator God Tohan, the flat new surface of what had previously been the underside of Eart h Seven is moulded into mountains, valleys and plains. New trees are planted, and new humans born. 27 A flood myth of Laos and northern Thailand has it that beings called the Thens lived in the upper kingdom long ages ago, while the masters of the lower world were three great men, Pu Leng Seung, Khun K’an and Khun K’et. One day the Thens announced that before eating any meal people should give them a part of their food as a sign of respect. The people refused and in a rage the Thens cr eated a flood which devastated the whole earth. The three great men built a raft, on top of which they made a small house, and embarked with a number of women and children. In this way they and their descendants survived the deluge. 28 In similar fashion the Karens of Bu rma have traditions of a global deluge from which two brothe rs were saved on a raft. 29 Such a deluge is also part of the mythology of Viet Nam, where a brother and a sister are said to have survived in a great wooden chest which also contained two of every kind of animal. 30 Several aboriginal Australian peoples, especially those whose traditional homelands are along the tropical northern coast, ascribe their origins to a great flood which swept away the previous landscape and society. Meanwhile, in the origin myths of a number of other tribes, the cosmic serpent Yurlunggur (associated with th e rainbow) is held responsible for the deluge. 31 There are Japanese traditions accord ing to which the Pacific islands of Oceania were formed after the waters of a great deluge had receded. 32 In Oceania itself a myth of the native inhabitants of Hawaii tells how the  26 Reported in Charles Berlitz, The Lost Ship of Noah, W.

The Samoans believe that there was once an inundation that wiped out almost all mankind. It was survived only by two human beings who put to sea in a boat which eventually came to rest in the Samoan archipelago. 33 Greece, India and Egypt On the other side of the world, Greek mythology too is haunted by memories of a deluge. Here, howe ver (as in Central America) the inundation is not viewed as an isolated event but as one of a series of destructions and remakings of the world. The Aztecs and the Maya spoke in terms of successive ‘Suns’ or epochs (of which our own was thought to be the Fifth and last). In similar fa shion the oral traditions of Ancient Greece, collected and set down in writ ing by Hesiod in the eighth century BC , related that prior to the present creation there had been four earlier races of men on earth. Each of th ese was thought more advanced than the one that followed it. And each , at the appointed hour, had been ‘swallowed up’ in a geological cataclysm. The first and most ancient creation had been mankind’s ‘golden race’ who had ‘lived like the gods, free from care, without trouble or woe ... With ageless limbs they revelled at their banquets ... When they died it was as men overcome by sleep.’ With the passing of time, and at the command of Zeus, this golden race eventually ‘sank into the depths of the earth’. It was succeeded by the ‘s ilver race’ which was supplanted by the ‘bronze race’, which was replaced by the race of ‘heroes’, which was followed by the ‘iron’ race—our own— the fifth and most recent creation. 34 It is the fate of the bronze race that is of particular interest to us here. Described in the myths as having ‘the strength of giants, and mighty hands on their mighty limbs’, 35 these formidable men were exterminated by Zeus, king of the gods, as a punishment for the misdeeds of Prometheus, the rebellious Titan wh o had presented humanity with the gift of fire. 36 The mechanism the vengeful deity used to sweep the earth clean was an overwhelming flood. In the most widespread version of the story Prometheus impregnated a human female. She bore him a son na med Deucalion, who ruled over the country of Phthia, in Thessaly, and took to wife Pyrrha, ‘the red-blonde’, daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora. When Zeus reached his fateful decision to destroy the bronze race, Deucalion, forewarned by Prometheus, made a wooden box, stor ed in it ‘all that was necessary’,  33 New Larousse Encyclopaedia of Mythology, pp. 460, 466. 34 C.

The king of the gods caused mighty rains to pour from heaven, flooding the grea ter part of the earth. All mankind perished in this deluge, save a few who had fled to the highest mountains. ‘It also happened at this time that the mountains of Thessaly were split asunder, and the whole country as far as the Isthmus and the Peloponnese became a single sheet of water.’ Deucalion and Pyrrha floated over this sea in their box for nine days and nights, finally landing on Mount Pa rnassus. There, after the rains had ceased, they disembarked and sacrificed to the gods. In response Zeus sent Hermes to Deucalion with permis sion to ask for whatever he wished. He wished for human beings. Zeus then bade him take stones and throw them over his shoulder. The stones Deucalion threw became men, and those that Pyrrha threw became women. 37 As the Hebrews looked back on Noah, so the Greeks of ancient historical times looked back upon Deucalion—as the ancestor of their nation and as the founder of numerous towns and temples. 38 A similar figure was revered in Ve dic India more than 3000 years ago. One day (the story goes) when a certain wise man named Manu was making his ablutions, he found in the hollow of his hand a tiny little fish which be gged him to allow it to live. Taking pity on it he put it in a jar. The next day, however, it had grown so much bigger that he had to carry it to a lake. Soon the lake was too small. ‘Throw me into the sea,’ said the fish [which was in reality a manifestation of the god Vishnu] ‘and I shall be more comfortable.’ Then he warned Manu of a coming deluge. He sent him a large ship, with orders to load it with two of every living species and the seeds of every plant, and then to go on board himself.’ 39 Manu had only just carried out thes e orders when the ocean rose and submerged everything, and nothing was to be seen but Vishnu in his fish form—now a huge, one-horned creature with golden scales. Manu moored his ark to the horn of the fi sh and Vishnu towed it across the brimming waters until it came to rest on the exposed peak of ‘the Mountain of the North’: 40 The fish said, ‘I have saved thee; fasten the vessel to a tree, that the water may not sweep it away while thou art on the mountain; and in proportion as the waters decrease thou shalt descend.’ Manu descended with the waters. The Deluge had carried away all creatures and Manu remained alone. 41 With him, and with the animals and plants he had saved from destruction, began a new age of the world.

A funerary text discovered in the tomb of Pharaoh Seti I, for example, tells of the destruction of sinful humanity by a deluge. 43 The reasons for this catastrophe are set out in Chapter CLXXV of the Book of the Dead, which attributes the following speech to the Moon God Thoth: They have fought fights, they have upheld strifes, they have done evil, they have created hostilities, they have made slaughter, they have caused trouble and oppression ... [Therefore] I am going to blot out everything which I have made. This earth shall enter into the watery abyss by means of a raging flood, and will become even as it was in primeval time. 44 On the trail of a mystery With the words of Thoth we have come full circle to the Sumerian and biblical floods. ‘The earth was filled with violence’, says Genesis: And God looked upon the earth, and, be hold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, ‘The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and behold I will destroy them with the earth.’ 45 Like the flood of Deucalion, the flood of Manu, and the flood that destroyed the Aztecs’ ‘Fourth Sun’, the biblical deluge was the end of a world age. A new age succeeded it: our own, populated by the descendants of Noah. From the ve ry beginning, however, it was understood that this age too would in due course come to a catastrophic end. As the old song puts it, ‘God gave Noah the rainbow sign; no more water, the fire next time.’ The Scriptural source for this prophecy of world destruction is to be found in 2 Peter 3: We must be careful to remember that during the last days there are bound to be people who will be scornful and [who will say], ‘Everything goes on as it has since it began at the creation’. They are choosing to forget that there were heavens at the beginning, and that the earth was formed by the word of God out of water and between the waters, so that the world of that time was destroyed by being flooded by water. But by the same word, the present sky and earth are destined for fire, and are only being reserved until Judgement Day so that all sinners may be destroyed ... The Day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, and then with a roar the sky will vanish, the elements will catch fire and fall apart, and the earth  42 Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1991, 7:798.

Elsewhere, in ot her cultures, different numbers of creations and destructions are reco rded. In China, for instance, the perished ages are called kis, ten of which are said to have elapsed from the beginning of time until Confucius. At the end of each kis, ‘in a general convulsion of nature, the sea is carried out of its bed, mountains spring up out of the ground, rivers change their course, human beings and everything are ruined, and the ancient traces effaced ...’ 47 Buddhist scriptures speak of ‘Seven Suns’, each brought to an end by water, fire or wind. 48 At the end of the Seventh Sun, the current ‘world cycle’, it is expected that the ‘earth will break into flames’. 49 Aboriginal traditions of Sarawak and Sabah recall that the sky was once ‘low’ and tell us that ‘six Suns perished ... at pr esent the world is illuminated by the seventh Sun’. 50 Similarly, the Siby lline Books speak of nine Suns that are nine ages’ and prophesy two ages yet to come—tho se of the eighth and the ninth Sun.’ 51 On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, the Hopi Indians of Arizona (who are distant relatives of the Aztecs 52 ) record three previous Suns, each culminating in a great annihila tion followed by the gradual re- emergence of mankind. In Aztec cosm ology, of course, there were four Suns prior to our own. Such minor differences concerning the precise number of destructions and creations en visaged in this or that mythology should not distract us from the remarkable convergence of ancient traditions evident here. All over the world these traditions appear to commemorate a widespread series of catastrophes. In many cases the character of each successive cataclysm is obscured by the use of poetic language and the piling up of metaphor and symbols. Quite frequently, also, at least two different kinds of disaster may be portrayed as having occurred simultaneously (most freque ntly floods and earthquakes, but sometimes fire and a terrifying darkness). All this contributes to the creation of a confused and jumbled picture. The myths of the Hopi, however, stand out for their straightforwardness and simplicity. What they tell us is this: The first world was destroyed, as a punishment for human misdemeanours, by an all-consuming fire that came from above and below. The second world ended when the terrestrial globe toppled from its axis and everything was covered with  46 2 Peter 3:3-10. 47 See H. Murray, J.

In the first epoch men were pure and sinless, tall and long lived, but at its close the Evil One declared war against Ahura Mazda, the holy god, and a tumultuous cataclysm ensued. During the second epoch the Evil One was unsuccessful. In the third good and evil were exactly balanced. In the fourth epoch (the present age of the world), evil triumphed at the outset and has maintained its supremacy ever since. 1 The end of the fourth epoch is predicted soon, but it is the cataclysm at the end of the first epoch that interest s us here. It is not a flood, and yet it converges in so many ways with so many global flood traditions that some connection is strongly suggested. The Avestic scriptures take us back to a time of paradise on earth, when the remote ancestors of the ancient Iranian people lived in the fabled Airyana Vaejo, the first good and happy creation of Ahura Mazda that flourished in the first age of the world: the mythical birthplace and original home of the Aryan race. In those days Airyana Vaejo enjoyed a mild and productive climate with seven months of summer and five of winter. Rich in wildlife and in crops, its meadows flowing with streams, th is garden of delights was converted into an uninhabitable wasteland of ten months’ winter and only two months summer as a result of the onslaught of Angra Mainyu, the Evil One: The first of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura Mazda, created was the Airyana Vaejo ... Then Angra Mainyu, who is full of death, created an opposition to the same, a mighty serpent and snow. Ten months of winter are there now, two months of summer, and these are cold as to the water, cold as to the earth, cold as to the trees ... There all around falls de ep snow; that is the direst of plagues ...’ 2 The reader will agree that a sudden and drastic change in the climate of Airyana Vaejo is indicated. The Avestic scriptures leave us in no doubt about this. Earlier they describe a m eeting of the celestial gods called by Ahura Mazda, and tell us that ‘the fair Yima, the good shepherd of high renown in the Airyana Vaejo’, attended this meeting with all his excellent mortals.  1 The Bundahish Chapters I, XXXI, XXXIV, cited in William F.

Upon the material world a fatal winter is about to descend, that shall bring a vehement, destroying frost. Upon the corporeal world will the evil of winter come, wherefore snow will fall in great abundance. ... ‘And all three sorts of beasts shall perish, those that live in the wilderness, and those that live on the tops of the mountains, and those that live in the depths of the valleys under the shelter of stables. ‘Therefore make thee a var [a hypogeum or underground enclosure] the length of a riding ground to all four corners. Thither bring thou the representatives of every kind of beast, great and small, of the cattle, of the beasts of burden, and of men, of dogs, of birds, and of the red burning fires. 3 ‘There shalt thou make water flow. Thou shall put birds in the trees along the water’s edge, in verdure which is everlasting. There put specimens of all plants, the loveliest and most fragrant, and of all fruits the most succulent. All these kinds of things and creatures shall not perish as long as they are in the var. But put there no deformed creature, nor impotent, nor mad, neither wicked, nor deceitful, nor rancorous, nor jealous; nor a man with irregular teeth, nor a leper ...’ 4 Apart from the scale of the enterprise there is only one real difference between Yima’s divinely inspired var and Noah’s divinely inspired ark: the ark is a means of surviving a terri ble and devastating flood which will destroy every living creature by drowning the world in water; the var is a means of surviving a terrible and deva stating ‘winter’ which will destroy every living creature by covering the earth with a freezi ng blanket of ice and snow. In the Bundahish, another of the Zoroastrian scriptures (believed to incorporate ancient material from a lost part of the original Avesta ), more information is provided on the cataclysm of glaciation that overwhelmed Airyana Vaejo. When Angra Mainyu se nt the ‘vehement destroying frost’, he also ‘assaulted and deranged the sky’. 5 The Bundahish tells us that this assault enabled the Evil One to master ‘one third of the sky and overspread it with darkness’ as the encroaching ice sheets tightened their grip. 6  3 Vendidad, Fargard II, cited in The Arctic Home in the Vedas, pp. 300, 353-4. 4 New Larousse Encyclopaedia of Mythology, p. 320. 5 West, Pahlavi Texts Part I, p. 17, London, 1880. 6 Ibid.; Justi, Der Bundahish, Leipzig, 1868, p. 5."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 199 Indescribable cold, fire, earthquakes and derangement of the skies The Avestic Aryans of Iran, who are known to have migrated to western Asia from some other, distant homeland, 7 are not the only possessors of archaic traditions which echo the basic setting of the great flood in ways unlikely to be coincidental. Indeed, though these are most commonly associated with the deluge, the familiar themes of the divine warning, and of the salvation of a remnant of mankind from a universal disaster, are also found in many different parts of the world in connection with the sudden onset of glacial conditions. In South America, for example, Toba Indians of the Gran Chaco region that sprawls across the modern borders of Paraguay, Argentina and Chile, still repeat an ancient myth concerning the advent of what they call ‘the Great Cold’. Forewarning comes from a semi-divine hero figure named Asin: Asin told a man to gather as much wood as he could and to cover his hut with a thick layer of thatch, because a time of great cold was coming. As soon as the hut had been prepared Asin and the man shut themselves inside and waited. When the great cold set in, shivering people arrived to beg a firebrand from them. Asin was hard and gave embers only to those who had been his friends. The people were freezing, and they cried the whole night. At midnight they were all dead, young and old, men and women ... this period of ice and sleet lasted for a long time and all the fires were put out. Frost was as thick as leather. 8 As in the Avestic traditions it seems that the great cold was accompanied by great darkness. In the words of on e Toba elder, these afflictions were sent ‘because when the earth is full of people it has to change. The population has to be thinned out to save the world ... In the case of the long darkness the sun simply disapp eared and the people starved. As they ran out of food, they began eating their children. Eventually they all died ... 9 The Mayan Popol Vuh associates the flood, with ‘much hail, black rain and mist, and indescribable cold’. 10 It also says that this was a period when ‘it was cloudy and twilight all ov er the world ... the faces of the sun and the moon were covered.’ 11 Other Maya sources confirm that these strange and terrible phenomena were experienced by mankind, ‘in the time of the ancients.

In Tierra del Fuego, for instance, it was said that the sun and the moon ‘fell from the sky’ 14 and in China that ‘the planets altered their courses. The sun, moon and stars changed their motions.’ 15 The Incas believed that ‘in ancient times the Andes were split apart when the sky made war on the earth.’ 16 The Tarahumara of northern Mexico have preserved world destruct ion legends based on a change in the sun’s path. 17 An African myth from the lo wer Congo states that ‘long ago the sun met the moon and threw mud at it, which made it less bright. When this meeting happened there was a great flood ...’ 18 The Cahto Indians of California say simply that ‘the sky fell’. 19 And ancient Graeco- Roman myths tell that the flood of Deucalion was immediately preceded by awesome celestial events. 20 These events are grap hically symbolized in the story of how Phaeton, child of the sun, harnessed his father’s chariot but was unable to guide it along his father’s course: Soon the fiery horses felt how their reins were in an unpractised hand. Rearing and swerving aside, they left their wonted way; then all the earth was amazed to see that the glorious Sun, instead of holding his stately, beneficent course across the sky, seemed to speed crookedly overhead and to rush down in wrath like a meteor.’ 21 This is not the place to speculate on what may have caused the alarming disturbances in the patterns of the heavens that are linked with cataclysm legends from all over the world. For our purposes at present, it is sufficient to note that such traditions seem to refer to the same ‘derangement of the sky’ that accompanied the fatal winter and spreading ice sheets described in the Iranian Avesta . 22 Other linkages occur. Fire, for example, often follows or precedes the flood. In the case of Phaeton’s adventure with the Sun, ‘the grass withered; the crops were scorched; the woods went up in fire and smoke; then beneath them the bare earth cracked and crumbled an d the blackened rocks burst asunder under the heat.’ 23 Volcanism and earthquakes are also mentioned frequently in association with the flood, particularly in the Americas.

Lightning struck and thunder was heard. Yet the drops that fell were not like rain. They were like fire ...’ 26 A monster chased the sun There is one ancient culture that perhaps preserves more vivid memories in its myths than any other; that of the so-called Teutonic tribes of Germany and Scandinavia, a culture best remembered through the songs of the Norse scalds and sages. The stories those songs retell have their roots in a past which may be much older than scholars imagine and which combine familiar images wi th strange symbolic devices and allegorical language to recall a cataclysm of awesome magnitude: In a distant forest in the east an aged giantess brought into the world a whole brood of young wolves whose father was Fenrir. One of these monsters chased the sun to take possession of it. The chase was for long in vain, but each season the wolf grew in strength, and at last he reac hed the sun. Its bright rays were one by one extinguished. It took on a blood red hue, then entirely disappeared. Thereafter the world was enveloped in hideous winter. Snow-storms descended from all points of the horizon. War broke out all over the earth. Brother slew brother, children no longer respected the ties of blood. It was a time when men were no better than wolves, eager to destroy each other. Soon the world was going to sink into the ab yss of nothingness. Meanwhile the wolf Fenrir, whom the gods had long ago so carefully chained up, broke his bonds at last and escaped. He shook himself and the world trembled. The ash tree Yggdrasil [envisaged as the axis of the earth] was shaken from its roots to its topmost branches. Mountains crumbled or split from top to bottom, and the dwarfs who had their subterranean dwellings in them sought desperately and in vain for entrances so long familiar but now disappeared. Abandoned by the gods, men were driven from their hearths and the human race was swept from the surface of the earth. The earth itself was beginning to lose its shape. Already the stars were coming adrift from the sky and falling into the gaping void. They were like swallows, weary from too long a voyage, who drop and sink into the waves. The giant Surt set the entire earth on fire; the universe was no longer more than  24 Folklore in the Old Testament, p. 101. 25 Maya History and Religion, p. 336. 26 The Mythology of South America, pp. 140-2."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 202 an immense furnace. Flames spurted from fissures in the rocks; everywhere there was the hissing of steam. All living things, all plant life, were blotted out. Only the naked soil remained, but like the sky itself the earth was no more than cracks and crevasses. And now all the rivers, all the seas, rose and overflowed. From every side waves lashed against waves. They swelled and boiled slowly over all things. The earth sank beneath the sea ... Yet not all men perished in the great catastrophe. Enclosed in the wood itself of the ash tree Yggdrasil—which the devouring flames of the universal conflagration had been unable to consume—the ancestors of a future race of men had escaped death. In this asylum they had found that their only nourishment had been the morning dew. Thus it was that from the wreckage of the ancient world a new world was born. Slowly the earth emerged from the waves. Mountains rose again and from them streamed cataracts of singing waters. 27 The new world this Teutonic myth anno unces is our own. Needless to say, like the Fifth Sun of the Aztecs and the Maya, it was created long ago and is new no longer. Can it be a coincidence that one of the many Central American flood myths about the fourth epoch, 4 Atl (‘water’), does not install the Noah couple in an ark but places them instead in a great tree just like Yggdrasil? ‘ 4 Atl was ended by floods. The mountains disappeared ... Two persons survived because they were ordered by one of the gods to bore a hole in the tr unk of a very large tree and to crawl inside when the skies fell. The pair entered and survived. Their offspring repopulated the world.’ 28 Isn’t it odd that the same symbolic language keeps cropping up in ancient traditions from so many wide ly scattered regions of the world? How can this be explained? Are we ta lking about some vast, subconscious wave of intercultural telepathy, or could elements of these remarkable universal myths have been engineered , long ages ago, by clever and purposeful people? Which of these improbable propositions is the more likely to be true? Or are there other possible explanations for the enigma of the myths? We shall return to these questions in due course. Meanwhile, what are we to conclude about the apocalypti c visions of fire and ice, floods, volcanism and earthquakes, which th e myths contain? They have about them a haunting and familiar realism.

In various regions at va rious times there have been terrible natural disasters. But there has not b een a single occasion in the past 5000 years when mankind as a whol e can be said to have faced extinction. Has this always been so? Or is it possible, if we go back far enough, that we might discover an epoch wh en our ancestors were nearly wiped out? It is just such an epoch that seems to be the focus of the great myths of cataclysm. Scholars normally attribute these myths to the fantasies of ancient poets. But what if the scholars are wrong? What if some terrible series of natural catastrophes did reduce our prehistoric ancestors to a handful of individual s scattered here and there across the face of the earth, far apart, and out of touch with one another? We are looking for an epoch that will fit the myths as snugly as the slipper on Cinderella’s foot. In this search, however, there is obviously no point in investigating any period prior to the emergence on the planet of recognizably modern human beings . We’re not interested here in Homo habilis or Homo erectus or even Homo sapiens neanderthalensis. We’re interested only in Homo sapiens sapiens, our own species, and we haven’t been around very long. Students of early Man disagree to some extent over how long we have been around. Some researchers, as we shall see, claim that partial human remains in excess of 100,000 years old may be ‘fully modern’. Others argue for a reduced antiquity in the range of 35-40,000 years, and yet others propose a compromise of 50,000 years. But no one knows for sure. ‘The origin of fully modern humans denoted by the subspecies name Homo sapiens sapiens remains one of the great puzzles of palaeoanthropology,’ admits one authority. 1 About three and a half million years of more or less relevant evolution are indicated in the fossil record. Fo r all practical purposes, that record starts with a small, bipedal hominid (nicknamed Lucy) whose remains were discovered in 1974 in the Ethiopian section of East Africa’s Great Rift Valley. With a brain capacity of 400cc (less than a third of the modern average) Lucy definitely wasn’t human . But she wasn’t an ape either and she had some remarkably ‘human-like’ features, notably her upright gait, and the shape of her pelvis and back teeth.

As time went by this species showed clear signs of evolut ion towards an ever more ‘gracile’ and refined form, and towards a larger and more versatile brain. Homo erectus, who overlapped with and then succeeded Homo habilis, appeared about 1.6 million years ago wi th a brain capacity in the region of 900cc (as against 70 0cc in the case of habilis ). 3 The million or so years after that, down to about 400,000 years ago, saw no significant evolutionary changes—or none attest ed to by surviving fossils. Then Homo erectus passed through the gates of extinction into hominid heaven and slowly—very, very slowly—what the palaeoanthropologists call ‘the sapient grad e’ began to appear: Exactly when the transition to a more sapi ent form began is difficult to establish. Some believe the transition, which involv ed an increase in brain size and a decrease in the robustness of the skull bones, began as early as 400,000 years ago. Unfortunately, there are simply not en ough fossils from this important period to be sure about what was happening.’ 4 What was definitely not happening 400,000 years ago was the emergence of anything identifiable as our own story-telling, myth -making subspecies Homo sapiens sapiens. The consensus is that ‘s apient humans must have evolved from Homo erectus’ , 5 and it is true that a number of ‘archaic sapient’ populations did come into existence between 400,000 and 100,000 years ago. Unfortunately, the re lationship of these transitional species to ourselves is far from clear. As noted, the first contenders for membership of the exclusive club of Homo sapiens sapiens have been dated by some researchers to the latter part of this period. But these remains are all partial and their identi fication is by no means universally accepted. The oldest, part of a skullcap, is a putative modern human specimen from about 113,000 BC . 6 Around this date, too, Homo sapiens neanderthalensis first appears, a quite distinct subspecies which most of us know as ‘Neanderthal Man’. Tall, heavily muscled, with promin ent brow ridges and a protruding face, Neanderthal Man had a bigger average brain size than modern humans (1400cc as against our 1360cc). 7 The possession of such a big brain was no doubt an asset to these ‘intelligent, spiritually sensitive,  2 Donald C.

At some point during this lengthy and poorly understood period, Homo sapiens sapiens established itself, leaving behind fossil remains from about 40,0 00 years ago that are undisputably those of modern humans, and suppla nting the Neanderthals completely by about 35,000 years ago. 9 In summary, human beings like ourselves, whom we could pass in the street without blinking an eyelid if they were shaved and dressed in modern clothes, are crea tures of the last 115,0 00 years at the very most—and more probably of only the la st 50,000 years. It follows that if the myths of cataclysm we have reviewed do reflect an epoch of geological upheaval experienced by humanity, these upheavals took place within the last 115,000 years, and more probably within the last 50,000 years. Cinderella’s slipper It is a curious coincidence of geol ogy and palaeoanthropology that the onset and progress of the last Ice Age, and the emergence and proliferation of modern Man, more or less shadow each other. Curious too is the fact that so little is known about either. In North America the last Ice Age is called the Wisconsin Glaciation (named for rock deposits studied in the state of Wiscon sin) and its early phase has been dated by geol ogists to 115,000 years ago. 10 There were various advances and retreats of the ice-cap after that, with the fastest rate of accumulation taking plac e between 60,000 years ago and 17,000 years ago—a process culminating in the Tazewell Advance, which saw the glaciation reach its maxi mum extent around 15,000 BC . 11 By 13,000 BC , however, millions of square miles of ice had melted, for reasons that have never properly been ex plained, and by 8000 BC the Wisconsin had withdrawn completely. 12 The Ice Age was a global phenomenon, affecting both the northern and the southern hemispheres; similar cl imatic and geological conditions therefore prevailed in many other parts of the world as well (notably in eastern Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and South America). There was massive glaciation in Europe, where the ice reached outward from Scandinavia and Scotland to cover most of Great Britain, Denmark, Poland, Russia, large parts of Germany, all of Switzerland, and big chunks  8 Ibid., p. 73. 9 Ibid., p. 73, 77. 10 Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1991, 12:712. 11 Path of the Pole, p. 146. 12 Ibid., p. 152; Encyclopaedia Britannica, 12:712."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 206 of Austria, Italy and France. 13 (Known technically as the Wurm Glaciation, this European Ice Age started about 70 ,000 years ago, a little later than its American counterpart, but attained its maximum extent at the same time, 17,000 years ago, and then expe rienced the same rapid withdrawal, and shared the same terminal date). 14 The crucial stages of Ice Age chronology thus appear to be: 1 around 60,000 years ago, when the Wurm, the Wisconsin and other glaciations were well under way; 2 around 17,000 years ago, when the ice sheets had reached their maximum extent in both the Old World and the New; 3 the 7000 years of deglaciation that followed. The emergence of Homo sapiens sapiens thus coincided with a lengthy period of geological and climatic turbulence, a period marked, above all else, by ferocious freezing and fl ooding. The many millennia during which the ice was remorselessly expanding must have been terrifying and awful for our ancestors. But those final 7000 years of deglaciation, particularly the episodes of very rapid and extensive melting, must have been worse. Let us not jump to conclusions about the state of social, or religious, or scientific, or intellectual developm ent of the human beings who lived through the sustained collapse of th at tumultuous epoch. The popular stereotype may be wrong in assuming that they were all primitive cave dwellers. In reality little is known about them and almost the only thing that can be said is that they were men and women exactly like ourselves physiologically and psychologically. It is possible that they came close to total extinction on several occasions during the upheavals they experienced; it is also possible that the great myths of cataclysm, to whic h scholars attribute no historical value, may contain accurate record s and eyewitness accounts of real events. As we see in the next chapter, if we are looking for an epoch that fits those myths as snugly as the s lipper on Cinderella’s foot, it would seem that the last Ice Age is it.  13 John Imbrie and Katherine Palmer Imbrie, Ice Ages: Solving the Mystery, Enslow Publishers, New Jersey, 1979, p. 11. 14 Ibid., p. 120; Encyclopaedia Britannica, 12:783; Human Evolution, p. 73."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 207 Chapter 27 The Face of the Earth was Darkened and a Black Rain Began to Fall Terrible forces were unleashed on all living creatures during the last Ice Age. We may deduce how these afflic ted humanity from the firm evidence of their consequences for other large species. Often this evidence looks puzzling. As Charles Darwin observed after visiting South America: No one I think can have marvelled more at the extinction of species than I have done. When I found in La Plata [Argentina] the tooth of a horse embedded with the remains of Mastodon, Megatherium, Toxodon, and other extinct monsters, which all co-existed at a very late geological period, I was filled with astonishment; for seeing that the horse, since its introduction by the Spaniards in South America, has run wild over the whole country and has increased its numbers at an unparalleled rate, I asked myself what could have so recently exterminated the former horse under conditions of life apparently so favourable? 1 The answer, of course, was the Ice Ag e. That was what exterminated the former horses of the Americas, and a number of other previously successful mammals. Nor were extinctions limited to the New World. On the contrary, in different parts of the earth (for different reasons and at different times) the long epoch of glaciation witnessed several quite distinct episodes of extinction. In all areas, th e vast majority of the many destroyed species were lo st in the final seven thousand years from about 15,000 BC down to 8000 BC . 2 At this stage of our investigation is it not necessary to establish the specific nature of the climatic, seismi c and geological events linked to the various advances and retreats of the ice sheets which killed off the animals. We might reasonably guess that tidal waves, earthquakes, gigantic windstorms and the sudden onset and remission of glacial conditions played their parts. But more important—whatever the actual agencies involved—is the stark empirical reality that mass extinctions of animals did take place as a result of the turmoil of the last Ice Age. This turmoil, as Darwin concluded in his Journal, must have shaken ‘the entire framework of the globe’. 3 In the New World, for example, more than seventy genera of large mammals became extinct between 15,000 BC and 8000 BC , including all North American members of seven families, and one complete order, the Proboscidea. 4 These staggering losses,  1 Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species, Penguin, London, 1985, p. 322. 2 Quaternary Extinctions, pp. 360-1, 394. 3 Charles Darwin, Journal of Researches into the Natural History and Geology of Countries Visited during the Voyage of HMS Beagle Round the World; entry for 9 January 1834. 4 Quaternary Extinctions, pp. 360-1, 394."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 208 involving the violent obliteration of mo re than forty million animals, were not spread out evenly over the whol e period; on the contrary, the vast majority of the extinctions occurred in just two thousand years, between 11,000 BC and 9000 BC . 5 To put this in perspect ive, during the previous 300,000 years only about twen ty genera had disappeared. 6 The same pattern of late and massive extinctions was repeated across Europe and Asia. Even far-off Austra lia was not exempt, losing perhaps nineteen genera of large vertebrates, not all of them mammals, in a relatively short period of time. 7 Alaska and Siberia: the sudden freeze The northern regions of Alaska and Si beria appear to have been the worst hit by the murderous upheavals be tween 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. In a great swathe of death around the edge of the Arctic Circle the remains of uncountable numbers of large animals have been found— including many carcasses with the flesh still intact, and astonishing quantities of perfectly preserved mammoth tusks. Indeed, in both regions, mammoth carcasses have been thawed to feed to sled dogs and mammoth steaks have featured on restaurant menus in Fairbanks. 8 One authority has commented, ‘Hundreds of thousands of individuals must have been frozen immediately after death and remained frozen, otherwise the meat and ivory woul d have spoiled ... Some powerful general force was certainly at work to bring this catastrophe about.’ 9 Dr Dale Guthrie of the Institute of Arctic Biology has made an interesting point about the sheer variety of animals that flourished in Alaska before the eleventh millennium BC : When learning of this exotic mixture of sabre-tooth cats, camels, horses, rhinos, asses, deer with gigantic antlers, lions, ferrets, and saiga, one cannot help wondering about the world in which they liv ed. This great diversity of species, so different from that encountered today, raises the most obvious question: is it not likely that the rest of the environment was also different? 10 The Alaskan muck in which the remains are embedded is like a fine, dark- grey sand. Frozen solid within this mass, in the words of Professor Hibben of the University of New Mexico: lie the twisted parts of animals and trees intermingled with lenses of ice and layers of peat and mosses ...

Such piles of bodies of animals or men simply do not occur by any ordinary natural means ...’ 11 At various levels stone artefacts have been found ‘frozen in situ at great depths, and in association with Ice Age fauna, which confirms that men were contemporary with extinct animals in Alaska’. 12 Throughout the Alaskan mucks, also there is: evidence of atmospheric disturbances of unparalleled violence. Mammoth and bison alike were torn and twisted as though by a cosmic hand in Godly rage. In one place we can find the foreleg and shoulder of a mammoth with portions of the flesh and toenails and hair still clinging to the blackened bones. Close by is the neck and skull of a bison with the vertebrae clinging together with tendons and ligaments and the chitinous covering of the horns intact. There is no mark of knife or cutting instrument [as there would be if human hunters, for example, had been involved]. The animals were simply torn apart and scattered over the landscape like things of straw and string, even though some of them weighed several tons. Mixed with piles of bones are trees, also twisted and torn and piled in tangled groups; and the whole is covered with a fine sifting muck, then frozen solid. 13 Much the same picture emerges in Siberia where catastrophic climatic changes and geological upheavals occurred at around the same time. Here the frozen mammoth graveyards, ‘mined’ for their ivory since the Roman era, were still yielding an estimated 20,000 pairs of tusks every decade at the beginning of the twentieth century. 14 Once again, some mysterious factor appears to have been at work in bringing about these mass extinctions. With their woolly coats and thick skins, mammoths are generally consider ed adapted to cold weather, and we are not surprised to come across their remains in Siberia. Harder to explain is the fact that human beings perished alongside them, 15 as well as many other animals that in no se nse can be described as cold-adapted species: The northern Siberian plains supported vast numbers of rhinoceroses, antelope, horses, bison, and other herbivorous creatures, while a variety of carnivores, including the sabertooth cat, preyed upon them ... Like the mammoths, these other animals ranged to the extreme north of Siberia, to the shores of the Arctic Ocean, and yet further north to the Lyakhov and New Siberian Islands, only a very short distance from the North Pole. 16 Researchers have confirmed that of the thirty-four animal species living in Siberia prior to the catastrophes of the eleventh millennium BC —including Ossip’s mammoth, giant deer, cave hyena and cave lions—no less than  11 Professor Frank C.

The same instant that these creatures were bereft of life, the country which they inhabited became frozen.’ 20 There is a great deal of other evidence which suggests that a sudden freeze took place in Siberia during the eleventh millennium BC . In his survey of the New Siberian Islands, the Arctic explorer Baron Eduard von Toll found the remains ‘of a sabre-tooth tiger, and a fruit tree that had been 90 feet tall when it was standi ng. The tree was well preserved in the permafrost, with its roots and seeds. Green leaves and ripe fruit still clung to its branches ... At the presen t time the only representative of tree vegetation on the islands is a willow that grows one inch high’. 21 Equally indicative of the cataclysmic change that took place at the onset of the great cold in Siberia is the food the extinct animals were eating when they perished: ‘The mammoths died suddenly, in intense cold, and in great numbers. Death came so quickl y that the swallowed vegetation is yet undigested ... Grasses, bluebells, buttercups, tender sedges, and wild beans have been found, yet identifiable and undeteriorated, in their mouths and stomachs.’ 22 Needless to say, such flora does not grow anywhere in Siberia today. Its presence there in the eleventh millennium BC compels us to accept that the region had a pleasant and pr oductive climate—one that was temperate or even warm. 23 Why the end of the last Ice Age in other parts of the world should have been the beginning of fatal winter in this former paradise is a question we shall postpone until Part VIII.

For centuries it must have been like that all the way acro ss the arc of death incorporating immense tracts of Siberia, the Yukon and Alaska. Here, ‘Interspersed in the muck depths, and sometimes through the very piles of bones and tusks themselves, are layers of volcanic ash. There is no doubt that coincidental with the [extinctions] there were volcanic eruptions of tremendous proportions.’ 25 There is a remarkable amount of evidence of excessive volcanism during the decline of the Wisconsin ice cap. 26 Far to the south of the frozen Alaskan mucks, thousands of prehistoric animals and plants were mired, all at once, in the famous La Brea tar pits of Los Angeles. Among the creatures unearthed were bison, horses, camels, sloths, mammoths, mastodons and at least seven hundred sabre-toothed tigers. 27 A disarticulated human skeleton was also found, completely enveloped in bitumen, mingled with the bones of an extinct species of vulture. In general, the La Brea remains (‘broken, mashed, contorted, and mixed in a most heterogeneous mass’ 28 ) speak eloquently of a sudden and dreadful volcanic cataclysm. 29 Similar finds of typical late Ice Age birds and mammals have been unearthed from asphalt at two other locations in California (Carpinteria and McKittrick). In the San Pedro Valley, mastodon skeletons were discovered still standing upright, ungu lfed in great heaps of volcanic ash and sand. Fossils from the glacial La ke Floristan in Colorado, and from Oregon’s John Day Basin, were also excavated from tombs of volcanic ash. 30 Although the tremendous eruptions that created such mass graves may have been at their most intense during the last days of the Wisconsin, they appear to have been recurrent throughout much of the Ice Age, not  24 Ibid., p. 256.

But those who recall the cauliflower-shaped clouds of dust, smoke and ash ejected into the upper atmosphere by the eruption of Mount Saint Helens in 1980 will appreciate that a large number of such explosions (occurring sequentially over a sustained period at different points around the globe) would not only have had devastating local effe cts but would have caused a severe deterioration in the world’s climate. Mount Saint Helens spat out an estimated one cubic kilometre of rock and was small-scale by comparison wi th the typical volcanism of the Ice Age. 32 A more representative impression would be the Indonesian volcano Krakatoa, which erupted in 1883 with such violence that more than 36,000 people were killed and the explosion was heard 3000 miles away. From the epicentre in the Sunda Strait, tsunamis 100 feet high roared across the Java Sea and the Indian Ocean, carrying steamships miles inland and causing flooding as far aw ay as East Africa and the western coasts of the Americas. Eighteen cu bic kilometres of rock and vast quantities of ash and dust were pumped into the upper atmosphere; skies all over the world were noticeab ly darker for more than two years and sunsets notably redder. Average gl obal temperatures fell measurably during this period because volcanic dust-particles reflect the sun’s rays back into space. 33 During the episodes of intense vo lcanism which characterized the Ice Age, we must envisage not one but many Krakatoas. The combined effect would at first have been a great inte nsification of glacial conditions, as the light of the sun was cut by the boiling dust clouds, and as already low temperatures plummeted even further. Volcanoes also inject enormous volumes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and carbon dioxide is a ‘greenhouse gas’, so it is reasonable to suppose, as the dust began to settle during periods of relative calm, that a degree of global warming would have occurred. A number of authorities attribute the repeated advances and retreats of the great ice sheets to precisely this see-saw interaction between volcanism and climate. 34 Global flooding Geologists agree that by 8000 BC the great Wisconsin and Wurm ice-caps had retreated.

Lurching from cataclysm to disaster and from misfortune to calamity, the few scattered tribes of surviving humans must have led lives of constant terror and confusion: there would have been periods of quiescence, when they might have hoped that the worst was over. While the melting of the giant glaciers continued, however, these episodes of tranquillity would have been punctuated again and again by violent floods. More over, sections of the earth’s crust hitherto pressed down into the asthen osphere by billions of tons of ice would have been liberated by the thaw and begun to rise again, sometimes rapidly, causing devastat ing earthquakes and filling the air with terrible noise. Some times were much worse than others. The bulk of the animal extinctions took place between 11,000 BC and 9000 BC when there were violent and unexplained fl uctuations of climate. 35 (In the words of geologist John Imbrie, ‘a climatic re volution took place around 11,000 years ago.’ 36 ) There were also greatly incr eased rates of sedimentation 37 and an abrupt temperature increase of 6-10 degrees Centigrade in the surface waters of the Atlantic Ocean. 38 Another turbulent episode, again accompanied by mass extinctions, took place between 15,000 BC and 13,000 BC . We saw in the previous chapter that the Tazewell Advance brought the ice sheets to their maximum extent around 17,000 years ago and that a dramatic and prolonged thaw then ensued, complete ly deglaciating millions of square miles of North America and Europe in less than two thousand years. There were some anomalies: all of western Alaska, the Yukon territory in Canada, and most of Siberia including the New Siberian Islands (now among the coldest parts of the world), remained unglaciated until the Ice Age was near its end. They acquired their present climate only about  35 Ibid., p. 137. A major change from glacial to post-glacial conditions occurred about 11,000 years ago. This temperature change was ‘sharp and abrupt’ (Polar Wandering and Continental Drift, Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists, Special Publication No. 10, Tulsa, 1953, p. 159).

Most of Europe was buried under ice two miles thick. 40 So too was most of North America where the ice-cap had spread from centres near Hudson Bay to enshroud all of eastern Canada, New England and much of the Midwest down to the 37th parallel—well to the south of Cincinnati in the Mississippi Valley and more than halfway to the equator. 41 At its peak 17,000 years ago, it is calculated that the total ice volume covering the northern hemisphere was in the region of six million cubic miles, and of course there were ex tensive glaciations in the southern hemisphere too as we noted. The su rplus water flow from which these numerous ice-caps were formed had been provided by the world’s seas and oceans which were then about 400 feet lower than they are today. 42 It was at this moment that the pend ulum of climate swung violently in the opposite direction. The great me ltdown began so suddenly and over such vast areas that it has been described ‘as a sort of miracle’. 43 Geologists refer to it as the Bolling phase of warm climate in Europe and as the Brady interstadial in No rth America. In both regions: An ice-cap that may have taken 40,000 years to develop disappeared for the most part, in 2000. It must be obvious that this could not have been the result of gradually acting climatic factors usually called upon to explain ice ages ... The rapidity of the deglaciation suggests that some extraordinary factor was affecting the climate. The dates suggest that this factor first made itself felt about 16,500 years ago, that it had destroyed most, perhaps three-quarters of the glaciers by 2000 years later, and that [the vast bu lk of these dramatic developments took place] in a millennium or less.’ 44  39 The reader may recall that inexplicably warm conditions prevailed in the New Siberian Islands until this time, and it is worth noting that many other islands in the Arctic Ocean were also unaffected for a long while by the widespread glaciations elsewhere (e.g. on Baffin Island the remains of alder and birch trees preserved in peat indicate a relatively warm climate extending at least from 30,000 to 17,000 years ago. It is also certain that large parts of Greenland remained enigmatically ice-free during the Ice Age.

From time to time great tidal waves rose up to engulf higher land as well. They ebbed away, but in the process left unmistakable traces of their presence. In the United States, ‘Ice Age marine features are present along the Gulf coast east of the Mississippi River, in some places at altitudes that may exceed 200 feet.’ 46 In bogs covering glacial deposits in Michigan, skeletons of two whales were discov ered. In Georgia marine deposits occur at altitudes of 160 feet, and in northern Florida at altitudes of at least 240 feet. In Texas, well to the south of the farthest extent of the Wisconsin Glaciation, the remains of Ice Age land mammals are found in marine deposits. Another marine deposi t, containing walr us, seals and at least five genera of whales, overlies the seaboard of the north-eastern states and the Arctic coast of Canada. In many areas along the Pacific coast of North America Ice Age marine deposits extend ‘more than 200 miles inland.’ 47 The bones of a whale have been found north of Lake Ontario, about 440 feet above sea level, a skeleton of another whale in Vermont, more than 500 feet abov e sea level, and another in the Montreal-Quebec area about 600 feet above sea level. 48 Flood myths from all over the world characteristically and recurrently describe scenes when humans and anim als flee the rising tides and take refuge on mountain tops. The fossil re cord confirms that this did indeed happen during the melting of the ice sheets and that the mountains were not always high enough to save the refugees from disaster. For example, fissures in the rocks on the tops of isolated hills in central France are filled with what is known as ‘osseous breccia’, consisting of the splintered bones of mammoths, woolly rhinoceroses and other animals. The 1430 feet peak of Mount Genay in Burgundy ‘is capped by a breccia containing remains of mammoth, re indeer, horse and other animals’. 49 Much farther south, so too is the Ro ck of Gibraltar where ‘a human molar and some flints worked by Paleolithic man were discovered among the animal bones.’ 50 Hippo remains, together with mammoth, rhinoceros, horse, bear, bison,     postglacial life fully established by 14,500 years ago.

They thronged together in vast multitudes, crushing into the more accessible caves, until overtaken by the waters and destroyed ... Rocky debris and large blocks from the sides of the hills were hurled down by the currents of water, crushi ng and smashing the bones ... Certain communities of early man must have suffered in this general catastrophe. 53 It is probable that similar flood disasters occurred in China at much the same time. In caves near Peking, bo nes of mammoths and buffaloes have been found in association with human skeletal remains. 54 A number of authorities attribute the violent inte rmingling of mammot h carcasses with splintered and broken trees in Siberia ‘to a great ti dal wave that uprooted forests and buried the tangled carnage in a flood of mud. In the polar region this froze solid and has preserved the evidence in permafrost to the present.’ 55 All over South America, too, Ice-Age fossils have been unearthed, ‘in which incongruous animal types (car nivores and herbivores) are mixed promiscuously with human bones. No less significant is the association, over truly widespread areas, of foss ilized land and sea creatures mingled in no order and yet entombed in the same geological horizon.’ 56 North America was also badly affected by flooding. As the great Wisconsin ice sheets melted they crea ted huge but temporary lakes which filled up with incredible speed, drow ning everything in their paths, then drained away in a few hundred years. Lake Agassiz, for example, the largest glacial lake in the New World, once occupied an area of 110,000 square miles, covering large parts of what are now Manitoba, Ontario and Saskatchewan in Canada, and North Da kota and Minnesota in the United States. 57 Remarkably, it endured for less than a millennium, indicating a catastrophically sudden episode of melting and flooding followed by a period of quiescence. 58  51 Ibid., p. 25-6. 52 Ibid., p. 50. 53 Ibid., p. 51-2. 54 J.

Let us start with some basics. The wild celestial dance The earth makes a complete circuit around its own axis once every twenty-four hours and has an equato rial circumference of 24,902.45 miles. It follows, therefore, that a ma n standing still on the equator is in fact in motion, revolving with the planet at just over 1000 miles per hour. 2 Viewed from outer space, looking down on the North Pole, the direction of rotation is anti-clockwise. While spinning daily on its own axis, the earth also orbits the sun (again in an anti-clockwise direction) on a pa th which is slightly elliptical rather than completely circular. It pursues this orbit at truly breakneck speed, travelling as far along it in an hour—66,600 miles—as the average motorist will drive in six years. To bring the calculations down in scale, this means that we are hurtling through space much faster than any  1 Hamlet’s Mill, pp. 57-8. 2 Figures from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1991, 27:530."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 223 bullet, at the rate of 18.5 miles every second. In the time that it has taken you to read this paragraph, we have voyaged about 550 miles farther along earth’s path around the sun. 3 With a year required to complete a full circuit, the only evidence we have of the tremendous orbital race we are participating in is the slow march of the seasons. And in the operations of the seasons themselves it is possible to see a wondrous and impartial mechanism at work distributing spring, summer, autumn and winter fairly around the globe, across the northern and southern hemispheres, year in and year out, with absolute regularity. The earth’s axis of rotation is tilted in relation to the plane of its orbit (at about 23.5° to the vertical). Th is tilt, which causes the seasons, ‘points’ the North Pole, and the enti re northern hemisphere away from the sun for six months a year (while the southern hemisphere enjoys its summer) and points the South Pole and the southern hemisphere away from the sun for the remaining si x months (while the northern hemisphere enjoys its summer). Th e seasons result from the annual variation in the angle at which the sun’s rays reach any particular point on the earth’s surface and from the annual variation in the number of hours of sunlight received there at different times of the year. The earth’s tilt is referred to in tec hnical language as its ‘obliquity’, and the plane of its orbit, extended outwards to form a great circle in the celestial sphere, is known as the ‘ecl iptic’. Astronomers also speak of the ‘celestial equator’, which is an exte nsion of the earth’s equator into the celestial sphere. The celestial equator is today inclined at about 23.5° to the ecliptic, because the earth’s axis is inclined at 23.5° to the vertical. This angle, termed the ‘obliquity of the ecliptic’, is not fixed and immutable for all time. On the contrary (as we saw in Chapter Eleven in relation to the dating of the Andean city of Tiahuanaco) it is subject to constant, though very slow, oscillat ions. These occur across a range of slightly less than 3°, rising closest to the vertical at 22.1° and falling farthest away at 24.5°. A full cycle, from 24.5° to 22.1°, and back again to 24.5°, takes approximately 41,000 years to complete. 4 So our fragile planet nods and spins while soaring along its orbital path. The orbit takes a year and the spin takes a day and the nod has a cycle of 41,000 years. A wild celestial dance se ems to be going on as we skip and skim and dive through eternity, and we feel the tug of contradictory urges: to fall into the sun on the one hand; to make a break for the outer darkness on the other.  3 Ibid. 4 J.

Also affecting us is the gravity of the other planets with which we share the solar system. Each of these exerts an attraction which tends to draw the earth out of its regular orbit around the sun. The planets are of different sizes, however, and revolve around the sun at different speeds. The combined gravitational influence they are able to exert thus changes over time in co mplex but predictable ways, and the orbit changes its shape constantly in response. Since the orbit is an ellipse these changes affect its degree of elongation, known technically as its ‘eccentricity’. This varies from a low value close to zero (when the orbit approaches the form of a perfect circle) to a high value of about six per cent when it is at its most elongated and elliptical. 6 There are other forms of planetary influence too. Thus, though no explanation has yet been forthcoming, it is known that shortwave radio frequencies are disturbed when Ju piter, Saturn and Mars line up. 7 And in this connection evidence has also emerged of a strange and unexpected correlation be tween the positions of Jupiter, Saturn and Mars, in their orbits around the sun, and violent electrical disturbances in the earth’s upper atmosphere.

Its writers are probably unaware of just how much they sound like Berosus, the Chaldean historian, astronomer and seer of the third century BC , who made a deep study of the omens he believed would presage the final destru ction of the world. He concluded, ‘I Berosus, interpreter of Bellus, affirm that all the earth inherits will be consigned to flame when the five planets assemble in Cancer, so arranged in one row that a straight line may pass through their spheres.’ 9 A conjunction of five planets that can be expected to have profound gravitational effects will take place on 5 May in the year 2000 when Neptune, Uranus, Venus, Mercury and Mars will align with earth on the other side of the sun, setting up a sort of cosmic tug-of-war. 10 Let us also note that modern astrologers who ha ve charted the Mayan date for the end of the Fifth Sun calculate that there will be a most peculiar arrangement of planets at that time, indeed an arrangement so peculiar that ‘it can only occur once in 45, 200 years ... From this extraordinary pattern we might well expect an extraordinary effect.’ 11 No one in his or her right mind would rush to accept such a proposition. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that multiple influences, many of which we do not fully unders tand, appear to be at work within our solar system. Among these influences, that of our own satellite, the moon, is particularly strong. Earthqua kes, for example, occur more often when the moon is full or when the earth is between the sun and the moon; when the moon is new or between the sun and the earth; when the moon crosses the meridian of the affected locality; and when the moon is closest to the earth on its orbit. 12 Indeed, when the moon reaches this latter point (technically referred to as its ‘perigree’), its gravitational attraction increases by about six per cent. This happens once every twenty-seven and one-third days. The ti dal pull that it exerts on these occasions affects not only the great movements of our oceans but those of the reservoirs of hot magma penned within the earth’s thin crust (which has been described as resemb ling ‘a paper bag filled with honey or molasses swinging along at a rate of more than 1000 miles an hour in equatorial rotation, and more than 66,000 miles an hour in orbit’ 13 ).

The corollary is a flattening at the poles. In consequence, our planet deviates slightly from the form of a perfec t sphere and is more accurately described as an ‘oblate spheroid’. Its radius at the equator (3963.374 miles) is about fourteen miles long er than its polar radius (3949.921 miles). 14 For billions of years the flattened poles and the bulging equator have been engaged in a covert mathematical interaction with the recondite influence of gravity. ‘Because the Earth is flattened,’ explains one authority, ‘the Moon’s gravity tends to tilt the Earth’s axis so that it becomes perpendicular to the Moon’s orbit, and to a lesser extent the same is true for the Sun.’ 15 At the same time the equatorial bulge—the extra mass distributed around the equator—acts like the rim of a gyroscope to keep the earth steady on its axis. 16 Year in, year out, on a planetary scale, it is this gyroscopic effect that prevents the tug of the sun and the moon from radically altering the earth’s axis of rotation. The pull these two bodies jointly exert is, however, sufficiently strong to forc e the axis to ‘precess’, which means that it wobbles slowly in a clockwis e direction opposite to that of the earth’s spin. This important motion is our planet’s characteristic signature within the solar system. Anyone who has ever set a top spinning should be able to understand it without much difficulty; a top, after all, is simply another type of gyroscope. In fu ll uninterrupted spin it stands upright. But the moment its axis is deflected from th e vertical it begins to exhibit a second behaviour: a slow and obst inate reverse wobble around a great circle. This wobble, which is precession, changes the direction in which the axis points while keeping constant its newly tilted angle. A second analogy, somewhat different in approach, may help to clarify matters a little further: 1 Envisage the earth, floating in spac e, inclined at approximately 23.5° to the vertical and spinning around on its axis once every 24 hours. 2 Envisage this axis as a massively strong pivot, or axle, passing through the centre of the earth, ex iting via the North and South Poles and extending outwards from there in both directions. 3 Imagine that you are a giant, stridi ng through the solar system, with orders to carry out a specific task. 4 Imagine approaching the tilted eart h (which, because of your great size, now looks no bigger to you than a millwheel). 5 Imagine reaching out and grasping the two ends of the extended axis. 6 And imagine yourself slowly beginni ng to inter-rotate them, pushing  14 Figures from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1991, 27:530. 15 Ibid. 16 Path of the Pole, p. 3."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 228 one end, pulling the other. 7 The earth was already spin ning when you arrived. 8 Your orders, therefore, are not to ge t involved in its axial rotation, but rather to impart to it its other motion: that slow clockwise wobble called precession. 9 To fulfill this commission you will have to push the northern tip of the extended axis up and around a grea t circle in the northern celestial hemisphere while at the same time pulling the southern tip around an equally large circle in the southern celestial hemisphere. This will involve a slow swivelling pedallin g motion with your hands and shoulders. 10 Be warned, however. The ‘millwheel’ of the earth is heavier than it looks, so much heavier, in fact, th at it’s going to take you 25,776 years 17 to turn the two tips of its axis through one full precessional cycle (at the end of which they will be aiming at the same points in the celestial sphere as when you arrived). 11 Oh, and by the way, now that you’ve started the job we may as well tell you that you’re never going to be allowed to leave.

These moments (or cardinal points), which were of immense importance to the ancients, are the winter and the summer solstices and the spring and autumn equinoxes. In the northern hemisphere the winter solstice, the shortest day, falls on 21 December, and the summer solstice, the longest day, on 21 June. In the southern hemisphere, on the other hand,  19 Precise figure from The Death of Gods in Ancient Egypt, p. 205."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 231 everything is literally upside down: there winter begins on 21 June and summer on 21 December.

Once again, however, as with the solstices, the date that marks the onset of spring in the northern hemisphere (20 March) marks that of autumn in the southern hemisphere, and the date for the onset of autumn in the northern hemisphere (22 September) marks the onset of spring in the southern hemisphere. Like the subtler variations of the seasons, all this is brought about by the benevolent obliquity of the planet. The northern hemisphere’s summer solstice falls at that point in the orbit when the North Pole is aimed most directly towards the sun; six months late r the winter solstice marks that point when the North Pole is aimed most directly away from the sun. And, logically enough, the reason that day and night are of exactly equal length all over the planet on the spring and autumn equinoxes is that these mark the tw o points when the earth’s axis of rotation lies broadside-on to the sun. Let us now take a look at a stra nge and beautiful phenomenon of celestial mechanics. This phenomenon is known as ‘the precession of the equinoxes’. It has rigid and repetitive mathematical qualities that can be analysed and predicted precisely.

Ringed around the ecliptic, in a starry belt that exte nds approximately 7° north and south, are the twelve constellations of the zodiac: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpi us, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius and Pisces. These constellations are irregular in size, shape and distribution. Nevertheless (and one assumes by chan ce!) their spacing around the rim of the ecliptic is sufficiently even to bestow a sense of cosmic order upon the diurnal risings and settings of the sun. To picture what is involved here, do the following: (1) mark a dot in the centre of a blank sheet of paper; (2) draw a circle around the dot, about half an inch away from it; (3) enclose that circle in a second, larger, circle. The dot represents the sun. The sma ller of the two concentric circles represents the earth’s orbit. The larger circle represents the rim of the ecliptic. Around the perimeter of this larger circle, therefore, you should now draw twelve boxes, spacing them evenly, to represent the constellations of the zodiac. Since there are 360° in a circle, each constellation can be considered to occupy a space of 30° along the ecliptic. The dot is the sun. The inner of the two concentric circles is the earth’s orbit. We know that the eart h travels on this orbit in an anti- clockwise direction, from the west towards the east, and that every twenty-four hours it also makes one complete rotation around its own axis (again from the west towards the east). From these two movements two illusions result: 1 Each day as the planet turns from we st to east, the sun (which is of course a fixed point) appears to ‘m ove’ across the sky from east to west. 2 Roughly every thirty days, as the spinning earth jo urneys along its orbital path around the sun, the sun itself slowly appears to ‘pass’ through one after another of the twelve zodiacal constellations (which are also fixed points), and again it appears to be ‘moving’ in an east- west direction. On any particular day of the year, in other words, (corresponding on our diagram to any point we care to choose around the inner concentric circle marking the earth’s orbi t), it is obvious that the sun will lie between an observer on the earth and one of the twelve zodiacal constellations. On that day what the observer will see, so long as he or she is up and about well before dawn, is the sun rising in the east in the portion of the sky occupied by that particular constellation."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 233 Beneath the clear and unpolluted heavens of the ancient world, it is easy to understand how human beings might have felt reassured by regular celestial motions such as these. It is equally easy to understand why the four cardinal points of the year—the spring and autumn equinoxes, the winter and summer solstices—should everywhere have been accorded immense significance. Even greater significance was accorded to the conjunction of these cardinal points with the zodiacal constellations. But most significant of all was the constellation in which the sun was observed to rise on th e morning of the spring (or vernal) equinox. Because of the earth’s axial precession, the ancients discovered that this constellation was not fixed or permanent for all time but that the honour of ‘housing’ or ‘carrying’ the sun on the day of the vernal equinox circulated— very, very slowly— among all the constellations of the zodiac. In the words of Giorgio de Santilla na: ‘The sun’s position amongst the constellations at the vernal equinox was the pointer that indicated the “hours” of the precessional cycle—very long hours indeed, the equinoctial sun occupying each zodiacal constellation for almost 2200 years. 1 The direction of the earth’s slow axial prece ssion is clockwise (i.e., east to west) and thus in opposition to the direction of the planet’s annual path around the sun. In relation to the constellations of the zodiac, lying fixed in space, this causes the poin t at which the spri ng equinox occurs ‘to move stubbornly along the eclipti c in the opposite direction to the yearly course Direction in which the vernal point shifts as a result of precession of the sun, that is, against the “right” sequence of the zodiacal signs (Taurus Æ Aries Æ Pisces Æ Aquarius, instead of Aquarius Æ Pisces Æ Aries Æ Taurus).’ 2   1 Hamlet ‘s Mill, p. 59. 2 Ibid., p. 58."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 234 During the course of each year the earth’s movement along its orbit causes the stellar background against which the sun is seen to rise to change from month to month: Aquarius Æ Pisces Æ Aries Æ Taurus Æ Gemini Æ Cancer Æ Leo, etc, etc. At present, on the vernal equinox, the sun rises due east between Pisces and Aquarius. The effect of precession is to cause the ‘vernal point’ to be reached fractionally earlier in the orbit each year with the result that it very gradually shifts through all 12 houses of the zodiac, spending 2160 years ‘in’ each sign and making a complete circuit in 25,920 years. The direction of this ‘processional drift’, in opposition to the annual ‘path of the sun’, is: Leo Æ Cancer Æ Gemini Æ Taurus Æ Aries Æ Pisces Æ Aquarius. To give one example, the ‘Age of Leo’, i.e. the 2160 years during which the sun on the vernal equinox rose against the stellar background of the constellation of Leo, lasted from 10,970 until 8810 BC . We live today in the astrological no man’s land at the end of the ‘Age of Pisces’, on the threshold of the ‘New Age’ of Aquarius. Traditionally these times of transition between one age and the next have been regarded as ill-omened. That, in a nutshell, is the meaning of ‘precession of the equinoxes’. And that is exactly what is involved in th e notion of the ‘daw ning of the Age of Aquarius’. The famous line from the musical Hair refers to the fact that every year, for the last 2000 years or so, the sun has risen in Pisces on the vernal equinox.

But the details of exactly how precession moves the equinoctial points from Pisces into Aquarius—and thence onwards around the zodiac—are also worth knowing. Remember that the equinoxes occur on the only two occasions in the year when the earth’s tilted axis lies broadside-on to the sun. These are when the sun rises due east all over the world and day and night are of equal length. Because the earth’s axis is slowly but surely precessing in a direction opposite to that of its own orbit, the points at which it lies broadside-on to the sun must occur fr actionally earlier in the orbit each year. These annual changes are so small as to be almost imperceptible (a one degree shift along the ecliptic—equivalent to the width of your little finger held up to the horizon—requ ires approximately seventy-two years to complete). However, as de Santilla na points out, such minute changes add up in just under 2200 years to a 30° passage th rough a complete house of the zodiac, and in just under 26,000 years to a 360° passage through a complete cycle of precession. When did the ancients first work out precession? In the answer to this question lies a great secret, and mystery, of the past. Before we try to penetrate the mystery and to learn the secret, we should acquaint ourselves with the ‘official’ line. The Encyclopaedia Britannica is as good a repository as any of conventional historical wisdom, and this is what it tells us about a scholar named Hipparchus, the supposed discoverer of precession: Hipparchus , also spelled HIPPARCHOS (b. Nicaea, Bithynia; d. after 127 BC , Rhodes), Greek astronomer and mathematician who discovered the precession of the equinoxes ... This notable discovery was the result of painstaking observations, worked upon by an acute mind. Hipparchus observed the positions of the stars, and then compared his result s with those of Timocharis of Alexandria about 150 years earlier and with even earlier observations made in Babylonia. He discovered that the celestial longitudes were different and that this difference was of a magnitude exceeding that attributable to errors of observation. He therefore proposed precession to account for the si ze of the difference and he gave a value of 45’ or 46’ (seconds of arc) for annual changes. This is very close to the figure of 50.274 seconds of ar c accepted today ...’ 3 First, a point of terminology. Second s of arc are the smallest subdivisions of a degree of arc. There are 60 of these arc seconds in one arc minute, 60 minutes in one degree, and 360 degrees in the full circle of earth’s path around the sun.

It is because of the observational difficulties entailed in de tecting this snails’ pace rate of change that the value worked out by Hipparchus in the second century BC is hailed in the Britannica as a ‘notable discovery’. Would this discovery seem so notable if it turned out to be a rediscovery? Would the mathematical and astronomical achievements of the Greeks shine so brightly if we could prove that the difficult challenge of measuring precession had been taken up thousands of years before Hipparchus? What if this heavenly cycle, almost 26,000 years long, had been made the object of precise scie ntific investigations long epochs before the supposed dawn of scientific thought? In seeking answers to such questi ons there is much that may be relevant which would never be accepted by any court of law as concrete proof. Let us not accept it either. We have seen that Hipparchus proposed a value of 45 or 46 seconds of arc for one year of precessional motion. Let us therefore not attempt to dislodge the Greek astronomer from his pedestal as the discoverer of precessi on unless we can find a significantly more accurate value recorded in a significantly more ancient source. Of course, there are many potential so urces. At this point, however, in the interests of succinctness, we shall limit our inquiry to universal myths. We have already examined one group of myths in detail (the traditions of flood and cataclysm set ou t in Part IV) and we have seen that they possess a range of intriguing characteristics: 1 There is no doubt that they are immensely old. Take the Mesopotamian flood story, versio ns of which have been found inscribed on tablets from the earlie st strata of Sumerian history, around 3000 BC . These tablets, handed do wn from the dawn of the recorded past, leave no room for do ubt that the tradition of a world- destroying flood was ancient even then, and therefore originated long before the dawn. We cannot say how long. The fact remains that no scholar has ever been able to estab lish a date for the creation of any myth, let alone for these venerable and widespread traditions. In a very real sense they seem always to have been around—part of the permanent baggage of human culture. 2 The possibility cannot be ruled out that this aura of vast antiquity is not an illusion. On the contrary, we have seen that many of the great myths of cataclysm seem to contain accurate eye-witness accounts of real conditions experienced by human ity during the last Ice Age. In theory, therefore, these stories could have been constructed at almost the same time as the emergence of our subspecies Homo sapiens sapiens, perhaps as long as 50,000 years ago. The geological evidence, however, suggests a more recent provenance, and we have identified the epoch 15,000-8000 BC as the most likely. Only then, in the whole of human experience, were there rapid climatic changes on"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 237 the convulsive scale the myths so eloquently describe. 3 The Ice Age and its tumultuous demise were global phenomena. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that the cataclysm traditions of many different cultures, widely scattered around the globe, should be characterized by a high degree of uniformity and convergence. 4 What is surprising, however, is that the myths not only describe shared experiences but that they do so in what appears to be a shared symbolic language. The same ‘literar y motifs’ keep cropping up again and again, the same stylistic ‘props’, the same recognizable characters, and the same plots. According to Professor de Santillana, this type of uniformity suggests a guiding hand at work. In Hamlet’s Mill, a seminal and original thesis on ancient myth written in collaboration with Hertha von Dechend (professor of the History of Science at Frankfurt University) he argues that: universality is in itself a test when coupled with a firm design. When something found, say, in China, turns up also in Baby lonian astrological texts, then it must be assumed to be relevant if it reveals a complex of uncommon images which nobody could claim had risen independently by spontaneous generation. Take the origin of music. Orpheus and his harrowing death may be a poetic creation born in more than one instance in diverse places. But wh en characters who do not play the lyre but blow pipes get themselves flayed aliv e for various absurd reasons, and their identical end is rehearsed on several contin ents, then we feel we have got hold of something, for such stories cannot be lin ked by internal sequence. And when the Pied Piper turns up both in the German myth of Hamelin and in Mexico long before Columbus, and is linked in both plac es to certain attributes like the colour red, it can hardly be a coincidence ... Likewise, when one finds numbers like 108, or 9 x 13 reappearing under several multiples in the Vedas, in the temples of Angkor, in Babylon, in Heraclitus’ dark u tterances, and also in the Norse Valhalla, it is not accident ... 4 Connecting the great universal myths of cataclysm, is it possible that such coincidences that cannot be co incidences, and accidents that cannot be accidents, could denote the global influence of an ancient, though as yet unidentified, guiding hand? If so, could it be that same hand, during and after the last Ice Age, which drew the series of highly accurate and technically advanced world maps review ed in Part I? And might not that same hand have left its ghostly fingerprints on another body of universal myths? those concerning the death and resurrection of gods, and great trees around which the earth and heavens turn, and whirlpools, and churns, and drills, and other similar revolving, grinding contrivances? According to Santillana and von De chend, all such images refer to celestial events 5 and do so, furthermore, in the refined technical language of an archaic but ‘immensely sophisticated’ astronomical and mathematical science: 6 ‘This language ignores local beliefs and cults. It  4 Hamlet’s Mill, p. 7. 5 Ibid.; Death of Gods in Ancient Egypt. 6 Hamlet’s Mill, p. 65."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 238 concentrates on numbers, motions, measures, overall frames, schemas— on the structure of numbers, on geometry.’ 7 Where could such a language have come from? Hamlet’s Mill is a labyrinth of brilliant but deliberately ev asive scholarship, and offers us no straightforward answer to this questi on. Here and there, however, almost with embarrassment, inconclusive hints are dropped. For example, at one point the authors say that the scientific language or ‘code’ they believe they have identified is of ‘awe-inspiring antiquity’. 8 On another occasion they pin down the depth of this anti quity more precisely to a period at least ‘6000 years before Virgil’ 9 —in other words 8000 years ago or more. What civilization known to history could have developed and made use of a sophisticated technical langua ge more than 80 00 years ago? The honest answer to this question is ‘none’, followed by a frank admission that what is being conjectured is nothing less than a forgotten episode of high technological culture in prehisto ric times. Once again, Santillana and von Dechend are elusive when it comes to the crunch, speaking only of the legacy we all owe to ‘some almost unbelievable ancestor civilization’ that ‘first dared to understand the world as created according to number, measure and weight.’ 10 The legacy, it is clear, has to do with scientific thinking and complex information of a mathematical nature . Because it is so extremely old, however, the passage of time has dissipated it: When the Greeks came upon the scene the dust of centuries had already settled upon the remains of this great world-wide archaic construction. Yet something of it survived in traditional rites, in myths and fairy-tales no longer understood ... These are tantalising fragments of a lost whole. They make one think of those ‘mist landscapes’ of which Chinese painters are masters, which show here a rock, here a gable, there the tip of a tree, and leave the rest to imagination. Even when the code shall have yielded, when the techniques shall be known, we cannot expect to gauge the thought of these remote ancestors of ours, wrapped as it is in its symbols, since the creating, ordering minds that devised the symbols have vanished forever.’ 11 What we have here, therefore, are two distinguished professors of the History of Science, from esteemed universities on both sides of the Atlantic, claiming to have discovered the remnants of a coded scientific language many thousands of years older than the oldest human civilizations identified by schola rship. Moreover, though generally cautious, Santillana and von Dechend also claim to have ‘broken part of that code’. 12 This is an extraordinary statement for two serious academics to have  7 Ibid., p. 345. 8 Ibid., p. 418. 9 Ibid., p. 245. 10 Ibid., p. 132. 11 Ibid., pp. 4-5,348. 12 Ibid., p. 5."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 239 made."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 240 Chapter 30 The Cosmic Tree and the Mill of the Gods In their brilliant an d far-reaching study Hamlet’s Mill, Professors de Santillana and von Dechend present a formidable array of mythical and iconographic evidence to demons trate the existence of a curious phenomenon. For some inexplicable reason, and at some unknown date, it seems that certain archaic myths from all over the world were ‘co- opted’ (no other word will really do) to serve as vehicles for a body of complex technical data concerning th e precession of the equinoxes. The importance of this astonishing thesis, as one leading authority on ancient measurement has pointed out, is that it has fired the first salvo in what may prove to be ‘a Copernican revolu tion in current conceptions of the development of human culture.’ 1 Hamlet’s Mill was published in 1969, more than a quarter of a century ago, so the revolution has been a lo ng time coming. During this period, however, the book has been neither widely distributed among the general public nor widely understood by scholars of the remote past. This state of affairs has not come about because of any inherent problems or weaknesses in the work. Instead, in the words of Martin Bernal, professor of Government Studies at Cornell University, it has happened because ‘few archaeologists, Egyptologists and ancient historians have the combination of time, effort and skill necessary to take on the very technical arguments of de Santillana.’ 2 What those arguments predominantly concern is the recurrent and persistent transmission of a ‘precessi onal message’ in a wide range of ancient myths. And, strangely enough, many of the key images and symbols that crop up in these myths—notably those that concern a ‘derangement of the heavens’—are al so to be found embedded in the ancient traditions of worldwide cataclysm reviewed in Chapters Twenty- four and Twenty-five. In Norse mythology for example, we saw how the wolf Fenrir, whom the gods had so carefully chained up, br oke his bonds at last and escaped: ‘He shook himself and the world trembled. The ash-tree Yggdrasil was shaken from its roots to its topmost branches. Mountains crumbled or split from top to bottom ... The earth began to lose its shape. Already the stars were coming adrift in the sky.’ In the opinion of de Santillana an d von Dechend, this myth mixes the  1 Livio Catullo Stecchini, ‘Notes on the Re lation of Ancient Measures to the Great Pyramid’, in Secrets of the Great Pyramid, pp. 381-2. 2 Martin Bernal, Black Athena: The Afro-asiatic Roots of Classical Civilization, Vintage Books, London, 1991, p. 276."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 241 familiar theme of catastrophe with the quite separate theme of precession. On the one hand we have an earthly disaster on a scale that seems to dwarf even the flood of Noah. On the other we hear that ominous changes are taking place in the heavens and that the stars, which have come adrift in the sk y, are ‘dropping into the void.’ 3 Such celestial imagery, repeated ag ain and again with only relatively minor variations in myths from many different parts of the world, belongs to a category earmarked in Hamlet’s Mill as ‘not mere storytelling of the kind that comes naturally’. 4 Moreover the Norse traditions that speak of the monstrous wolf Fenrir, and of the shaking of Yggdrasil, go on to report the final apocalypse in which th e forces of Valha lla issue forth on the side of ‘order’ to participate in the terrible last battle of the gods—a battle that will end in apocalyptic destruction: 500 doors and 40 there are I ween, in Valhalla’s walls; 800 fighters through each door fare, When to war with the Wolf they go. 5 With a lightness of touch that is almost subliminal, this verse has encouraged us to count Valhalla’s fighters, thus momentarily obliging us to focus our attention on their to tal number (540 x 80 0 = 432,000). This total, as we shall see in Chapter Thirty -one is mathematically linked to the phenomenon of precession. It is, unlikely to have found its way into Norse mythology by accident, especially in a context that has previously specified a ‘derangement of the heavens’ severe enough to have caused the stars to come adrift from their stations in the sky. To understand what is going on here it is essential to grasp the basic imagery of the ancient ‘message’ that Santillana and von Dechend claim to have stumbled upon. This imagery transforms the luminous dome of the celestial sphere into a vast and in tricate piece of machinery. And, like a millwheel, like a churn, like a whirlpool, like a qu ern, this machine turns and turns and turns endlessly (its motions being calibrated all the time by the sun, which rises first in one constellation of the zodiac, then in another, and so on all the year round). The four key points of the year are the spring and summer equinoxes and the winter and summer solstices. At each point, naturally, the sun is  3 The reader will recall from Chapter Twenty-five how Yggdrasil, the world tree itself, was not destroyed and how the progenitors of future humanity managed to shelter within its trunk until a new earth emerged from the ruins of the old. How likely is it to be pure coincidence that exactly the same strategy was adopted by survivors of the universal deluge as described in certain Central American myths? Such links and crossovers in myth between the themes of precession and global catastrophe are extremely common. 4 Hamlet’s Mill, p. 7. 5 Grimnismol 23, the Poetic Edda, p. 93, cited in Death of Gods in Ancient Egypt, p. 199; Hamlet’s Mill, p. 162; Elsa Brita Titchenell, The Masks of Odin, Theosophical University Press, Pasadena, 1988, p. 168."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 242 seen to rise in a different constellation (thus if the sun ri ses in Pisces at the spring equinox, as it does at present, it must rise in Virgo at the autumn equinox, in Gemini at the winter solstice and in Sagittarius at the summer solstice). On each of these four occasions for the last 2000 years or so, this is exactly what the sun has been doing. As we have seen, however, precession of the equinoxe s means that the vernal point will change in the not so distant future from Pisces to Aquarius. When that happens, the three other constellation s marking the three key points will change as well (from Virgo, Gemini and Sagittarius to Leo, Taurus and Scorpius)—almost as though the giant mechanism of heaven has ponderously switched gears ... Like the axle of a mill, Santillana and von Dechend explain, Yggdrasil ‘represents the world axis’ in the arch aic scientific language they have identified: an axis which extends outwards (for a viewer in the northern hemisphere) to the North Pole of the celestial sphere: This instinctively suggests a straight, upright post ... but that would be an oversimplification. In the mythical context it is best not to think of the axis in analytical terms, one line at a time, but to consider it, and the frame to which it is connected, as a whole:... As radius automa tically calls circle to mind so axis should invoke the two determining great ci rcles on the surface of the sphere, the equinoctial and solstitial colures. 6 These colures are the imaginary hoops, intersecting at the celestial North Pole, which connect the two equinoctial points on the earth’s path around the sun (i.e. where it stands on 20 March and 22 September) and the two solstitial points (where it stands on 21 June and 21 December). The implication, is that: ‘The rotation of the polar axis must not be disjointed from the great circles that shift along with it in heaven. The framework is thought of as all one with the axis.’ 7 Santillana and von Dechend are certain that what confronts us here is not a belief but an allegory. They insist that the notion of a spherical frame composed of two intersecting hoops suspended from an axis is not under any circumstances to be unders tood as the way in which ancient science envisaged the cosmos. Instead it is to be seen as a ‘thought tool’ designed to focus the minds of people bright enough to crack the code upon the hard-to-detect astronomical fact of precession of the equinoxes. It is a thought tool that keeps on cropping up, in num erous disguises, all over the myths of the ancient world. At the mill with slaves One example, from Central America (which also provides a further illustration of the curious symbolic ‘cross-overs’ between myths of  6 Hamlet’s Mill, p. 232-3. 7 Ibid., p. 231."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 243 precession and myths of catastroph e), was summarized by Diego De Landa in the sixteenth century: Among the multitude of gods worshipped by these people [the Maya] were four whom they called by the name Bacab. These were, they say, four brothers placed by God when he created the world at its four corners to sustain the heavens lest they fall. They also say that these Bacabs escaped when the world was destroyed by a deluge. 8 It is the opinion of Santillana and von Dechend that the Mayan astronomer-priests did not subscribe for a moment to the simple-minded notion that the earth was flat with fo ur corners. Instead, they say, the image of the four Bacabs is used as a technical allegory intended to shed light on the phenomenon of precession of the equinoxes. The Bacabs stand, in short, for the system of coor dinates of an astrological age. They represent the equinoctial and solstitial colures, binding together the four constellations in which the sun continues to rise at the spring and autumn equinoxes and at the winter and summer solstices for epochs of just under 2200 years. Of course it is understood that when the gears of heaven change, the old age comes crashing down and a new age is born. All this, so far, is routine precessional imagery. What stands out, however, is the explicit linkage to an earthly di saster—in this case a flood—which the Bacabs survive. It may also be relevant th at relief carvings at Chichen Itza unmistakably represent the Bacabs as being bearded and of European appearance. 9 Be that as it may, the Bacab im age (linked to a number of badly misunderstood references to ‘the four corners of heaven’, ‘the quadrangular earth’, and so on) is only one among many that seem to have been designed to serve as thought tools for precession. Archetypal among these is, of course, the ‘Mill’ of Santillana’s title—Hamlet’s Mill. It turns out that the Shakespearean character, ‘whom the poet made one of us, the first unhappy intellectua l’, conceals a past as a legendary being, his features predetermined, preshaped by longstanding myth. 10 In all his many incarnations, this Haml et remains strangely himself. The original Amlodhi (or sometimes Amleth) as his name was in Icelandic legend, ‘shows the same ch aracteristics of melancholy and high intellect. He, too, is a son dedicated to avenge his father, a spea ker of cryptic but inescapable truths, an elusive carrier of Fate who must yield once his mission is accomplished ...’ 11 In the crude and vivid imagery of the Norse, Amlodhi was identified  8 Yucatan before and after the Conquest, p. 82. 9 See, for example, The God-Kings and the Titans, p. 64.

In many of the traditions, two giant maidens (Fenja and Menja) were indentured to turn this great contraption, which could not be budged by any human strength. Something went wrong, and the two giantesses were forced to work day and night with no rest: Forth to the mill bench they were brought, To set the grey stone in motion; He gave them no rest nor peace, Attentive to the creak of the mill. Their song was a howl, Shattering silence; ‘Lower the bin and lighten the stones!’ Yet he would have them grind more. 12 Rebellious and angry, Fenja and Menja waited until everyone was asleep and then began to turn the mill in a mad whirl until its great props, though cased in iron, burst asunder. 13 Immediately afterwards, in a confusing episode, the mill was stolen by a sea king named Mysinger and loaded aboard his ship together wi th the giantesses. Mysinger ordered the pair to grind again, but this time they ground out salt. At midnight they asked him whether he was not we ary of salt; he bade them grind longer. They had ground but a little longer when down sank the ship: The huge props flew off the bin, The iron rivets burst, The shaft tree shivered, The bin shot down. 14 When it reached the bottom of the sea, the mill continued to turn, but it ground out rock and sand, creating a vast whirlpool, the Maelstrom. 15 Such images, Santillana and von Dech end assert, signify precession of the equinoxes. 16 The axis and ‘iron props’ of the mill stand for: a system of coordinates in the celestial sphere and represent the frame of a world age. Actually the frame defines a world age. Because the polar axis and the colures form an invisible whole, the entire frame is thrown out of kilter if one part is moved. When that happens a new Pole star with appropriate colures of its own must replace the obsolete apparatus. 17 Furthermore, the engulfing whirlpool:  12 Grottasongr, ‘The Song of the Mill’, in The Masks of Odin, p. 198. 13 Ibid., p. 201. 14 Grottasongr, cited in Hamlet’s Mill, p. 89-90. 15 Ibid., p. 2. 16 Ibid. 17 Ibid., p. 232."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 245 belongs to the stock-in-trade of ancient fable.

The persistence of detail rules out free invention. Such stories have belonged to the cosmographical literature since antiquity. 18 The appearance of the whirlpool in Homer’s Odyssey (which is a compilation of Greek myths more than 3000 years old), should not surprise us, because the great Mill of Icelandic legend appears there also (and does so, moreover, in familiar circumstances). It is the last night before the decisive confrontation. Od ysseus, bent on revenge, has landed in Ithaca and is hiding under the magic spell of the goddess Athena, which protects him from recognition. Odysseus prays to Zeus to send him an encouraging sign before the great ordeal: Straightaway Zeus thundered from shin ing Olympus ... and goodly Odysseus was glad. Moreover, a woman, a grinder at the mill, uttered a voice of omen from within the house hard by, where stood the mills of the shepherd of the people. At these handmills twelve women in all plied their task, making meal of barley and of wheat the marrow of men. Now all the others were asleep, for they had ground out their task of grain, but this one alone rested not yet, being the weakest of all. She now stayed her quern and spake the word ... ‘May the [enemies of Odysseus] on this day, for the last time make their sweet feasting in his halls. They that have loosened my knees with cruel toil to grind their barley meal, may they now sup their last!’ 19 Santillana and von Dechend argue that it is no accident that the allegory of the ‘orb of heaven that turns around like a millstone and ever does something bad’ 20 also makes an appearance in the biblical tradition of Samson, ‘eyeless in Gaza at the mill with slaves’. 21 His merciless captors unbind him so that he can ‘make sport’ for them in their temple; instead, with his last strength, he takes hold of the middle pillars of that great structure and brings the whole edific e crashing down, killing everybody. 22 Like Fenja and Menja, he gets his revenge.

There the Hamlet/Samson figure is known as Kullervo and the mill has a peculiar name: the Sampo. Like Fenja and Menja’s mill it is ultimately stolen and loaded on board a ship. And like their mill, it en ds up being broken in pieces. 26 It turns out that the word ‘Sampo’ has its origins in the Sanskrit skambha, meaning ‘pillar or pole’. 27 And in the Atharvaveda, one of the most ancient pieces of north Indian literature, we find an entire hymn dedicated to the Skambha: In whom earth, atmosphere, in whom sky is set, where fire, moon, sun, wind stand fixed ... The Skambha sustains both heaven and earth; the Skambha sustains the wide atmosphere; the Skambha sustains the six wide directions; into the Skambha entered all existence. Whitney, the translator ( Atharvaveda 10:7) comments in some perplexity: ‘Skambha, lit, prop, support, pillar, stra ngely used in this hymn as frame of the universe’. 28 Yet with an awareness of the complex of ideas linking cosmic mills, and whirlpools and worl d trees and so on, the archaic Vedic usage should not seem so strange. What is being signalled here, as in all the other allegories, is the frame of a world age— that same heavenly mechanism that turns for more than 2000 years with the sun rising always in the same four cardinal points and then slowly shifts those celestial coordinates to four new co nstellations for the next couple of thousand years. This is why the mill always breaks, why the huge props always fly off the bin in one way or another, why th e iron rivets burst, why the shaft- tree shivers. Precession of the equino xes merits such imagery because, at widely separated intervals of time it does indeed change, or break, the stabilizing coordinates of the entire celestial sphere. Openers of the way What is remarkable about all this is the way that the mill (which continues to serve as an allegory for cosmic processes) stubbornly keeps on resurfacing, all over the world, even where the context has been jumbled or lost. Indeed, in Santillana and von Dechend’s argument, it doesn’t really matter if the context is lost . ‘The particular merit of mythical terminology,’ they say, ‘is that it can be used as a vehicle for handing down solid knowledge independently from the degree of insight of the people who do the actual telling of stories, fables, etc.’ 29 What matters, in  25 In Maori traditions the Samson character is known as Whakatu.

An example of such drift (coupled with the retention of essential imagery and information) is found among the Cherokees, whose name for the Milky Way (our own galaxy) is ‘Whe re the Dog Ran’. In ancient times, according to Cherokee tradition, the ‘p eople in the South had a corn mill’, from which meal was stolen again an d again. In due course the owners discovered the thief, a dog, who ‘ran off howling to his home in the North, with the meal dropping from his mouth as he ran, and leaving behind a white trail where now we s ee the Milky Way, which the Cherokee call to this day ... “W here the Dog Ran”.’ 30 In Central America, one of the ma ny myths concerning Quetzalcoatl depicts him playing a key role in the regeneration of mankind after the all-destroying flood that ended the Fourth Sun. Together with his dog- headed companion Xolotl, he descends into the underworld to retrieve the skeletons of the people killed by the deluge. This he succeeds in doing, after tricking Miclantechuhtli, the god of death, and the bones are brought to a place called Tamoanchan. There, like corn, they are milled into a fine meal on a grindstone. Upon this ground meal the gods then release blood, thus creating the flesh of the current age of men. 31 Santillana and von Dechend do not th ink that the presence of a canine character in both the above variants of the myth of the cosmic mill is likely to be accidental. They point out that Kullervo, the Finnish Hamlet, is also accompanied by ‘the black dog Musti’. 32 Likewise, after his return to his estates in Ithaca, Od ysseus is first recognized by his faithful dog, 33 and as anyone who has been to Sunday school will remember, Samson is associated with foxes (300 of them to be precise 34 ), which are members of the dog family. In the Danish version of the Amleth/Hamlet saga, ‘Amleth went on and a wolf crossed his path amid the thicket.’ 35 Last but not least an alternative recension of the Kullervo story from Finland has the hero (rather weirdly) being ‘sent to Esthonia to bark under the fence; he barked one year ...’ 36 Santillana and von Dechend are confid ent that all this ‘doggishness’ is purposive: another piece of the ancient code, as yet unbroken, persistently tapping out its message fr om place to place.

Orion was transported to the skies where he became the constellation that bears his name today; his dog was transformed into Sirius, the Dog Star. 38 Precisely the same identification of Sirius was made by the ancient Egyptians, 39 who linked the Orion constellat ion specifically to their god Osiris. 40 It is in Ancient Egypt too that the character of the faithful celestial dog achieves its fullest and mo st explicit mythical elaboration in the form of Upuaut, a jackal-headed deity whose name means ‘Opener of the Ways’. 41 If we follow this way opener to Egypt, turn our eyes to the constellation of Orion, and enter th e potent myth of Osiris, we find ourselves enveloped in a net of familiar symbols. The reader will recall that the myth presents Osiris as the victim of a plot. The conspirators initially dispos e of him by sealing him in a box and casting him adrift on the waters of the Nile. In this respect does he not resemble Utnapishtim, and Noah and Coxcoxtli and all the other deluge heroes in their arks (or boxes, or chests) riding out the waters of the flood? Another familiar element is the classic precessional image of the world- tree and/or roof-pillar (i n this case combined). The myth tells us how Osiris, still sealed inside his coffer, is carried out into the sea and washed up at Byblos. The waves lay him to rest among the branches of a tamarisk tree, which rapidly grows to a magnificent size, enclosing the coffer within its trunk. 42 The king of the country, who much admires the tamarisk tree, cuts it down and fash ions the part which contains Osiris into a roof pillar for his palace. Later Isis, the wife of Osiris, removes her  37 Ibid., pp. 7, 31. 38 World Mythology, p. 139.

For astronomers precession is a well -established fact; those working in the field of ancient man have a respon sibility to attain an understanding of it.’ 3 It is Sellers’s contention, eloquently expressed in her recent book, The Death of Gods in Ancient Egypt, that the Osiris myth may have been deliberately encoded with a group of key numbers that are ‘excess baggage’ as far as the narrative is concerned but that offer an eternal calculus by which surp risingly exact values can be derived for the following: 1 The time required for the earth’s slow precessional wobble to cause the position of sunrise on the vern al equinox to complete a shift of one degree along the ecliptic (in relation to the stellar background); 2 The time required for the sun to pass through one full zodiacal segment of thirty degrees ; 3 The time required for the sun to pass through two full zodiacal segments (totalling sixty degrees ); 4 The time required to bring about the ‘Great Return’ 4 , i.e., for the sun to shift three hundred and sixty degrees along the ecliptic, thus fulfilling one complete precessional cycle or ‘Great Year’.  1 The Death of Gods in Ancient Egypt, author biography. 2 For example by Robert Bauval in The Orion Mystery, pp. 144-5. 3 The Death of Gods in Ancient Egypt, p. 174. 4 This phrase was coined by Jane Sellers, whom also detected the precessional calculations embedded in the Osiris myth."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 251 Computing the Great Return The precessional numbers highlighted by Sellers in the Osiris myth are 360, 72, 30 and 12. Most of them ar e found in a section of the myth which provides us with biographical details of the various characters. These have been conveniently summariz ed by E. A. Wallis Budge, formerly keeper of Egyptian Antiquities at the British Museum: The goddess Nut, wife of the sun god Ra, was beloved by the god Geb. When Ra discovered the intrigue he cursed his wife and declared that she should not be delivered of a child in any month of any year. Then the god Thoth, who also loved Nut, played at tables with the moon and won from her five whole days. These he joined to the 360 days of which the year then consisted [emphasis added]. On the first of these five days Osiris was brought forth; and at the moment of his birth a voice was heard to proclaim that the lord of creation was born. 5 Elsewhere the myth informs us that the 300-day year consists of ‘12 months of 30 days each’. 6 And in general, as Sellers observes, ‘phrases are used which prompt simple mental calculations and an attention to numbers’. 7 Thus far we have been provided with three of Sellers’s precessional numbers: 360, 12 and 30. The fourth nu mber, which occurs later in the text, is by far the most important. As we saw in Chapter Nine, the evil deity known as Set led a group of conspi rators in a plot to kill Osiris. The number of these conspirators was 72. With this last number in hand, su ggests Sellers, we are now in a position to boot-up and set running an ancient computer programme: 12 = the number of constellations in the zodiac; 30 = the number of degrees alloca ted along the ecliptic to each zodiacal constellation; 72 = the number of years required for the equinoctial sun to complete a precessional shift of one degree along the ecliptic; 360 = the total number of degrees in the ecliptic; 72 x 30 = 2160 (the number of years re quired for the sun to complete a passage of 30 degrees along the ecliptic, i.e., to pass entirely through any one of the 12 zodiacal constellations); 2160 x 12 (or 360 x 72) = 25,920 (the number of years in one complete precessional cycle or ‘Great Year’, and thus the total number of years required to bring abou t the ‘Great Return’).  5 The Egyptian Book of the Dead, Introduction, page XLIX. 6 Cited in The Death of Gods in Ancient Egypt, p. 204. 7 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 252 Other figures and combinations of figures also emerge, for example: 36, the number of years required for the equinoctial sun to complete a precessional shift of half a degree along the ecliptic; 4320, the number of years required fo r the equinoctial sun to complete a precessional shift of 60 degrees (i .e., two zodiacal constellations). These, Sellers believes, constitute the basic ingredients of a precessional code which appears again and again, with eerie persistence, in ancient myths and sacred architecture. In common with much esoteric numerology, it is a code in which it is permissible to shift decimal points to left or right at will and to make use of almost any conceivable combinations, permutations, multiplica tions, divisions and fractions of the essential numbers (all of which relate precisely to the rate of precession of the equinoxes). The pre-eminent number in the code is 72. To this is frequently added 36, making 108, and it is permissible to multiply 108 by 100 to get 10,800 or to divide it by 2 to get 54, which may then be multiplied by 10 and expressed as 540 (or as 54,000. or as 540,000, or as 5,400,000, and so on). Also highly significant is 21 60 (the number of years required for the equinoctial point to transit one zodiacal constellation), which is sometimes multiplied by 10 and by factors often (to give 216,000, 2,160,000, and so on) and sometime s by 2 to give 4320, or 43,200, or 432,000, or 4,320,000, ad infinition. Better than Hipparchus If Sellers is correct in her hypothesis that the calculus needed to produce these numbers was deliberately encoded into the Osiris myth to convey precessional information to initiates, we are confronted by an intriguing anomaly. If they are indeed about precession, the numbers are out of place in time. The science they contain is too advanced for them to have been calculated by any known civilization of antiquity. Let us not forget that they occur in a myth which is present at the very dawn of writing in Egypt (indeed elem ents of the Osiris story are to be found in the Pyramid Texts dating back to around 2450 BC , in a context which suggests that they were exceedingly old even then 8 ). Hipparchus, the so-called discoverer of prece ssion lived in the second century BC . He proposed a value of 45 or 46 seconds of arc for one year of precessional motion. These figures yield a one-degree shift along the ecliptic in 80 years (at 45 arc seconds per annum), and in 78.26 years (at 46 arc  8 Ibid., pp. 125-6ff; see also The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 253 seconds per annum). The true figure, as calculated by twentieth century science, is 71.6 years. 9 If Sellers’s theory is correct, therefore, the ‘Osiris numbers’, which give a value of 72 years, are significantly more accurate than those of Hipparchus. Indeed, wi thin the obvious confines imposed by narrative structure, it is diffic ult to see how the number 72 could have been improved upon, even if the more precise figure had been known to the ancient myth-makers. One can hardly insert 71.6 conspirators into a story, but 72 will fit comfortably. Working from this rounded-up figure , the Osiris myth is capable of yielding a value of 2160 years for a precessional shift through one complete house of the zodiac. The correct figure, according to today’s calculations, is 2148 years. 10 The Hipparchus figures are 2400 years and 2347.8 years respectively. Finally, Osir is enables us to calculate 25,920 as the number of years required for the fulfillment of a complete precessional cycle through 12 houses of the zodiac. Hipparchus gives us either 28,800 or 28,173.6 years. The correct figure, by today’s estimates, is 25,776 years. 11 The Hipparchus calculations for the Great Return are therefore around 3000 years out of kilt er. The Osiris calculations miss the true figure by only 144 years, and may well do so because the narrative context forced a rounding -up of the base number from the correct value of 71.6 to a mo re workable figure of 72. All this, however, assumes that Sellers is right to suppose that the numbers 360, 72, 30 and 12 did not find their way into the Osiris myth by chance but were placed there de liberately by people who understood— and had accurately measured—precession. Is Sellers right? Times of decay The Osiris myth is not the only one to incorporate the calculus for precession. The relevant numbers k eep surfacing in various forms, multiples and combinations, all over the ancient world. An example was given in Chapter Th irty-three—the Norse myth of the 432,000 fighters who sallied forth from Valhalla to do battle with ‘the Wolf’. A glance back at that myth shows that it contains several permutations of ‘precessional numbers’. Likewise, as we saw in Chapter Twenty-four, ancient Chinese traditions referring to a universal cataclysm were said to have been written down in a great text consisting of precisely 4320 volumes. Thousands of miles away, is it a coincidence that the Babylonian historian Berossus (third century BC ) ascribed a total reign of 432,000  9 Death of Gods in Ancient Egypt, p. 205. 10 Ibid. 11 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 254 years to the mythical kings who ruled the land of Sumer before the flood? And is it likewise a coincidence that this same Berossus ascribed 2,160,000 years to the period ‘between creation and universal catastrophe’? 12 Do the myths of ancient Amerindian peoples like the Maya also contain or enable us to compute numbers such as 72, 2160, 4320, etc. We shall probably never know, thanks to the conquistadores and zealous friars who destroyed the traditional heritage of Central America and left us so little to work with. What we can say, however, is that the relevant numbers do turn up, in relative pr ofusion, in the Mayan Long Count calendar. Details of that calendar were given in Chapter Twenty-one. The numerals necessary for calculating precession are found there in these formulae: 1 Katun = 7200 days; 1 Tun = 360 days; 2 Tuns = 720 days; 5 Baktuns = 720,000 days; 5 Katuns = 36,000 days; 6 Katuns = 43,200 days; 6 Tuns = 2160 days; 15 Katuns = 2,160,000 days. 13 Nor does it seem that Sellers’s ‘code’ is confined to mythology. In the jungles of Kampuchea the temple comp lex of Angkor looks as though it could have been purpose-built as a precessional metaphor. It has, for example, five gates to each of which leads a road bridging the crocodile- infested moat that surrounds the whole site. Each of these roads is bordered by a row of gigantic stone figures, 108 per avenue, 54 on each side (540 statues in all) and each row carries a huge Naga serpent. Furthermore, as Santillana and von Dechend point out in Hamlet’s Mill, the figures do not ‘carry’ the serpent but are shown to ‘pull’ it, which indicates that these 540 statues ar e ‘churning the Milky Ocean’. The whole of Angkor ‘thus turns out to be a colossal model set up with true Hindu fantasy and incongruousness’ to express the idea of precession. 14  12 Ibid., p. 196. 13 Skywatchers of Ancient Mexico, p. 143. 14 Hamlet’s Mill, pp. 162-3; see also Atlas of Mysterious Places, pp. 168-70."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 255 Churning the Milky Ocean, one of the several ‘thought tools’ for precession encountered in ancient myths.

There ar e, for instance, 10 ,800 bricks in the Agnicayana, the Indian fire altar. There are 10,800 stanzas in the Rigveda, the most ancient of the Vedic texts and a rich repository of Indian mythology. Each stanza is made up of 40 syllables with the result that the entire composition consists of 432,000 syllables ... no more, and no less. 17 And in Rigveda 1:164 (a typical stanza) we read of ‘the 12- spoked wheel in which 720 sons of Agni are established’. 18 In the Hebrew Cabala there are 72 angels through whom the Sephiroth (divine powers) may be approached, or invoked, by those who know their names and numbers. 19 Rosicrucian tradition speaks of cycles of 108 years (72 plus 36) according to which the secret brotherhood makes its influence felt. 20 Similarly the number 72 and its permutations and subdivisions are of great significan ce to the Chinese secret societies known as Triads. An ancient ritual requires that each candidate for initiation pay a fee including ‘360 ca sh for “making clothes”, 108 cash “for the purse”, 72 cash for instruction, and 36 cash for decapitating the “traitorous subject”.’ 21 The ‘cash’ (the old universal brass coin of China with a square hole in the centre) is of course no longer in circulation but the numbers passed down in the ritual since times immemorial have survived. Thus in modern Singapore, candidates for Triad membership pay an entrance fee which is calcul ated according to their financial circumstances but which must always consist of multiples of $1.80, $3.60, $7.20, $10.80 (and thus, $18, $36, $72, $108.00, or $360, $720, $1,080, and so on. 22 Of all the secret societies, the most mysterious and archaic by far is undoubtedly the Hung League, whic h scholars believe to be ‘the depository of the old religion of the Chinese’. 23 In one Hung initiation ritual the neophyte is put through a question and answer session that goes: Q.

Finally, returning to India, let us note the content of the sacred scriptures known as the Puranas. These speak of four ‘ages of the earth’, called Yugas, which together are said to extend to 12,000 ‘divine years’. The respective durations of these epoc hs, in ‘divine year s’, are Krita Yuga = 4800; Treta Yuga = 3600; Davpara Yuga = 2400; Kali Yuga = 1200. 25 The Puranas also tell us that ‘one year of the mortals is equal to one day of the gods’. 26 Furthermore, and exactly as in the Osiris myth, we discover that the number of days in the years of both gods and mortals has been artificially set at 360, so one year of the gods is equivalent to 360 mortal years. 27 The Kali Yuga, therefore, at 1200 year s of the gods, turns out to have a duration of 432,000 mortal years. 28 One Mahayuga, or Great Age (made up of the 12,000 divine years cont ained in the four lesser Yugas) is equivalent to 4,320,000 years of mortals.

Separately there are Manv antaras (periods of Manu) of which we are told in the scriptures that ‘a bout 71 systems of four Yugas elapse during each Manvantara.’ 30 The reader will recall that one degree of precessional motion along the ecliptic requires 71.6 years to complete, a number that can be rounded down to ‘abo ut 71’ in India just as easily as it was rounded up to 72 in Ancient Egypt. The Kali Yuga, with a duration of 432, 000 mortal years, is, by the way, our own. ‘In the Kali Age,’ the script ures say, ‘shall decay flourish, until the human race approaches annihilation.’ 31 Dogs, uncles and revenge It was a dog that brought us to these decaying times. We came here by way of Sirius, the Dog Star, who stands at the heel of the giant constellation of Orion where it towers in the sky above Egypt. In that land, as we have seen, Orio n is Osiris, the god of death and resurrection, whose numbers—perhaps by chance—are 12, 30, 72, and 360. But can chance account for the fact that these and other prime integers of precession keep cro pping up in supposedly unrelated mythologies from all over the world, and in such stolid but enduring vehicles as calendar system s and works of architecture? Santillana and von Dechend, Jane Se llers and a growing body of other scholars rule out chance, arguing that the persistence of detail is indicative of a guiding hand. If they are wrong, we need to find some other explanation for how such specific and inter-related numbers (the only obvious func tion of which is to calculate precession) could by acci dent have got themselves so widely imprinted on human culture. But suppose they are not wrong? Suppose that a guiding hand really was at work behind the scenes? Sometimes, when you slip into Santillana’s and von Dechend’s world of myth and mystery, you can almost feel the influence of that hand ... Take the business of the dog ... or jackal, or wolf, or fox. The subtle way this shadowy canine slinks from myth to myth is peculiar—stimulating, then baffling you, always luring you onwards. Indeed, it was this lure we followed from the Mill of Amlodhi to the myth of Osiris in Egypt. Along the way, according to the design of the ancient sages (if Sellers, Santillana and von Dechend are right) we were first encouraged to build a clear mental picture of the celestial sphere. Second, we were provided with a me chanistic model so that we could  29 Ibid., pp. 353-4. 30 Ibid., p. 354. 31 Ibid., p. 247."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 259 visualize the great changes precession of the equinoxes periodically effects in all the coordinates of the sphere. Finally, after allowing the dog Sirius to open the way for us, we were given the figures to calculate precession more or less exactly. Nor is Sirius, in his eternal statio n at Orion’s heel, the only doggish character around Osiris. We saw in Ch apter Eleven how Isis (who was both the wife and sister of Osiris 32 ) searched for her dead husband’s body after he had been murdered by Set (who, incidentally, was also her brother, and the brother of Osiris). In this se arch, according to ancient tradition, she was assisted by dogs (jackals in some versions). 33 Likewise, mythological and religious texts from all periods of Egyptian history assert that the jackal-god Anubis mini stered to the spirit of Osiris after his death and acted as his gu ide through the underworld. 34 (Surviving vignettes depict Anubis as virtually identical in appearance to Upuaut, the Opener of the Ways.) Last but not least, Osiris himself was believed to have taken the form of a wolf when he returned from the underworld to assist his son Horus in the final battle against Set. 35 Investigating this kind of material, one sometimes has the spooky sense of being manipulated by an ancient intelligence which has found a way to reach out to us across vast epochs of time, and for some reason has set us a puzzle to solve in the language of myth. If it were just dogs that kept cro pping up again and again, it would be easy to brush off such weird intu itions. The dog phenomenon seems more likely to be coincidence than an ything else. But it isn’t just dogs. The ways between the two very different myths of Osiris and Amlodhi’s Mill (which nonetheless both seem to contain accurate scientific data about precession of the equinoxes) are kept open by another strange common factor. Family relationships are involved. Amlodhi/Amleth/Hamlet is always a so n who revenges the murder of his father by entrapping and killing the murderer. The murderer, furthermore, is always the father’s own brother, i.e., Hamlet’s uncle. 36 This is precisely the scenario of th e Osiris myth. Osiris and Seth are brothers. 37 Seth murders Osiris. Horus, the son of Osiris, then takes revenge upon his uncle. 38 Another twist is that the Hamlet character often has some sort of incestuous relationship with his sister. 39 In the case of Kullervo, the  32 For details of these complicated family relationships, see Egyptian Book of the Dead, Introduction, p.

Out of their union is born Horus the avenger. So once again it seems reasonable to ask: what is going on? Why are there all these apparent links and connections? Why do we have these ‘strings’ of myths, ostensibly about different subjects, all of which prove capable in their own ways of shedding light on the phenomenon of precession of the equinoxes? And why do all these myths have dogs running through them, and characters who seem unusually inclined to incest, fratricide and revenge?

The final retreat of the ice sheets, and the consequent 300-400 foot rise in global sea levels, took place only a few thousand years befo re the beginning of the historical period. It is therefore not surprising that all our early civilizations should have retained vivid memories of the vast cataclysms that had terrified their forefathers. Much harder to explain is the peculiar but distinctive way the myths of cataclysm seem to bear the intell igent imprint of a guiding hand. 1 Indeed the degree of convergence between such ancient stories is frequently remarkable enough to raise the suspicion that they must all have been ‘written’ by the same ‘author’. Could that author have had anything to do with the wondrous deity, or superhuman, spoken of in so many of the myths we have reviewed, who appears immediately after the world has been shattered by a horrifying geological catastrophe and brings comfort and the gifts of civilization to the shocked and demoralized survivors? White and bearded, Osiris is the Egyp tian manifestation of this universal figure, and it may not be an accident that one of the first acts he is remembered for in myth is the abolition of cannibalism among the primitive inhabitants of the Nile Valley. 2 Viracocha, in South America, was said to have begun his civilizing mission immedi ately after a great flood; Quetzalcoatl, the discoverer of maize, brought the benefits of crops, mathematics, astronomy and a refined culture to Mexico after the Fourth Sun had been overwhelmed by a destroying deluge. Could these strange myths contain a record of encounters between scattered palaeolithic tribes which survived the last Ice Age and an as yet  1 See Chapter Twenty-four for details of fl ood myths. The same kind of convergence among supposedly unconnected myths also occurs with regard to precession of the equinoxes. The mills, the characters who work and own and eventually break them, the brothers and nephews and uncles, the theme of revenge, the theme of incest, the dogs that flit silently from story to story, and the exact numbers needed to calculate precessional motion—all crop up everywhere, from culture to culture and from age to age, propagating themselves effortlessly along the jet-stream of time. 2 Diodorus Siculus, Book I, 14:1-15, translated by C.

And could the myths be at tempts to communicate? A message in the bottle of time ‘Of all the other stupendous inve ntions,’ Galileo once remarked, what sublimity of mind must have been his who conceived how to communicate his most secret thoughts to any other person, though very distant either in time or place, speaking with those who are in th e Indies, speaking to those who are not yet born, nor shall be this thousand or ten thousand years? And with no greater difficulty than the various arrangements of two dozen little signs on paper? Let this be the seal of all the admirable inventions of men. 3 If the ‘precessional message’ identified by scholars like Santillana, von Dechend and Jane Sellers is indeed a deliberate attempt at communication by some lost civilization of antiquity, how come it wasn’t just written down and left for us to find? Wouldn’t that have been easier than encoding it in myths? Perhaps. Nevertheless, suppose that whatever the message was written on got destroyed or worn away after many th ousands of years? Or suppose that the language in which it was inscribed was later forgotten utterly (like the enigmatic Indus Valley script, which has been studied closely for more than half a century but has so far resi sted all attempts at decoding)? It must be obvious that in such circumstances a written legacy to the future would be of no value at all, because nobody would be able to make sense of it. What one would look for, therefore, would be a universal language, the kind of language that would be co mprehensible to any technologically advanced society in any epoch, even a thousand or ten thousand years into the future. Such languages are few and far between, but mathematics is one of them—and the city of Teot ihuacan may be the calling-card of a lost civilization written in the et ernal language of mathematics. Geodetic data, related to the exact positioning of fixed geographical points and to the shape and size of the earth, would also remain valid and recognizable for tens of thousands of years, and might be most conveniently expressed by means of cartography (or in the construction of giant geodetic monuments like the Great Pyramid of Egypt, as we shall see). Another ‘constant’ in our solar system is the language of time: the great but regular intervals of time calibrated by the inch-worm creep of precessional motion. Now, or ten thou sand years in the future, a message that prints out numbers like 72 or 2160 or 4320 or 25,920 should be instantly intelligible to any civilizat ion that has evolved a modest talent for mathematics and the ability to detect and measure the almost  3 Galileo, cited in Hamlet’s Mill, p. 10."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 264 imperceptible reverse motion that the sun appears to make along the ecliptic against the background of the fixed stars (one degree in 71.6 years, 30 degrees in 21 48 years, and so on). The sense that a correlation exists is strengthened by something else. It is neither as firm nor as definite as the number of syllables in the Rigveda; nevertheless, it feels releva nt. Through powerful stylistic links and shared symbolism, myths to do with global cataclysms and with precession of the equinoxes quite frequently intermesh. A detailed interconnectedness exists between these two categories of tradition, both of which additionally bear what appear to be the recognizable fingerprints of a conscious design. Quite naturally, therefore, one is prompted to discover whether there might not be an important connection between precession of the equinoxes and global catastrophes. Mill of pain Although several different mechanisms of an astronomical and geological nature seem to be involved, and although not all of these are fully understood, the fact is that the cycle of precession does correlate very strongly with the onset and demise of ice ages. Several trigger factors must coincide , which is why not every shift from one astronomical age to another is implicated. Nevertheless, it is accepted that precession does have an impact on both glaciation and deglaciation, at widely separated intervals. The knowledge that it does so has only been established by our own science since the late 1970s. 4 Yet the evidence of the myths suggests that the same level of knowledge might have been possessed by an as yet unidentified civilization in the depths of the last Ice Age. The clear suggestion we may be meant to grasp is that the terrible cataclysms of flood and fire and ice which the myths describe were in some way causally connected to the ponderous movements of the celestial coordina tes through the great cycle of the zodiac. In the words of Santillana and von Dechend, ‘It was not a foreign idea to the ancients that the mills of the gods grind slowly and that the result is usually pain.’ 5 Three principal factors, all of whic h we have met before, are now known to be deeply implicated in the onset and the retreat of ice ages (together, of course, with the diverse cataclys ms that ensue from sudden freezes and thaws). These factors all have to do with variations in the earth’s orbital geometry. They are: 1 The obliquity of the ecliptic (i.e., the an gle of tilt of the planet’s axis of  4 Ice Ages; John Imbrie et al., ‘Variations in the Earth’s Orbit: Pacemaker of the Ice Ages’ in Science, volume 194, No. 4270, 10 December 1976. 5 Hamlet’s Mill, pp. 138-9."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 265 rotation, which is also the angle between the celestial equator and the ecliptic). This, as we have seen, varies over immensely long periods of time between 22.1 degrees (the closest point that the axis reaches to vertical) and 24.5 degrees (the furthest it falls away from the vertical); 2 The eccentricity of the orbit (i.e., whether the earth’s elliptical path around the sun is more or less elongated in any given epoch); 3 Axial precession, which causes the fo ur cardinal points on the earth’s orbit (the two equinoxes and the winter and summer solstices) to creep backwards very, very slowly around the orbital path. We are dipping our toes into the wa ters of a technical and specialized scientific discipline here—one largel y outside the scope of this book. Readers seeking detailed information ar e referred to the multidisciplinary work of the US National Science Foun dation’s CLIMAP Project, and to a keynote paper by Professors J. D. Hays and John Imbrie entitled ‘Variations in the Earth’s Orbit: Pace maker of the Ice Ages’ (see Note 4). Briefly, what Hays, Imbrie and others have proved is that the onset of ice ages can be predicted when th e following evil and inauspicious conjunctions of celest ial cycles occur: (a) maximum eccentricity , which takes the earth millions of miles furt her away from the sun at ‘aphelion’ (the extremity of its orbit) than is normal; (b) minimum obliquity , which means that the earth’s axis, and consequently the North and South poles, stand much closer to the vertical than is normal; and (c) precession of the equinoxes which, as the great cycle continues, eventually causes winter in one hemisphere or the other to set in when the earth is at ‘perihelion’ (its closest point to the sun); this in turn means that summer occurs at aphelion and is thus relative ly cold, so that ice laid down in winter fails to melt during the follo wing summer and a remorseless build- up of glacial conditions occurs. 6 Levered by the changing geometry of the orbit, ‘global insolation’—the differing amounts and intensity of sunl ight received at various latitudes in any given epoch—can thus be an im portant trigger factor for ice ages. Is it possible that the ancient myth-makers were trying to warn us of great danger when they so intricately linked the pain of global cataclysms to the slow grinding of the mill of heaven? This is a question we will return to in due course, but meanwhile it is enough to observe that by identifying the significant effects of orbital geometry on the planet’s climate an d wellbeing, and by combining this information with precise measurements of the rate of precessional motion, the unknown scientists of an unrecognized civilization seem to have found a way to catch our attention, to bridge the chasm of the ages, and to communicate with us directly.  6 ‘Variations in the Earth’s Orbit: Pacemaker of the Ice Ages’."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 266 Whether or not we listen to what they have to say is, of course, entirely up to us."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 267 Part VI The Giza Invitation Egypt 1 "},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 268 Chapter 33 Cardinal Points Giza, Egypt, 16 March 1993, 3:30 a.m. We walked through the deserted lobby of our hotel and stepped into the white Fiat waiting for us in the drivew ay outside. It was driven by a lean, nervous Egyptian named Ali whose job it was to get us past the guards at the Great Pyramid and away again before sunrise. He was nervous because if things went wrong Santha and I would be deported from Egypt and he would go to jail for six months. Of course, things were not supposed to go wrong. That was why Ali was with us. The day before we’d paid him 150 US dolla rs which he had changed into Egyptian pounds and sp read among the guards concerned. They, in return, had agreed to turn a blind eye to our presence during the next couple of hours. We drove to within half a mile of th e Pyramid, then walked the rest of the way—around the side of the steep embankment that looms above the village of Nazlet-el-Samaan and le ads to the monument’s north face. None of us said very much as we trudged through the soft sand just out of range of the security lights. We felt excited and apprehensive at the same time. Ali was by no means cert ain that his bribes were going to work. For a while we stood still in the shad ows, gazing at the monstrous bulk of the Pyramid reaching into the darkness above us and blotting out the southern stars. Then a patrol of three men armed with shotguns and wrapped in blankets against the night chill came into view at the northeastern corner, about fifty yards away, where they stopped to share a cigarette. Indicating that we should stay put, Ali stepped forward into the light and walked over to the guards. He talked to them for several minutes, apparently arguing heatedly. Finally he beckoned to us, indicating that we should join him. ‘There’s a problem,’ he explained. ‘One of them, the captain here, [he indicated a short, unshaven, disgruntle d looking fellow] is insisting that we pay an extra thirty dollars otherwis e the deal is off. What do you want to do?’ I fished around in my wa llet, counted out thirty dollars and handed the bills to Ali. He folded them and passed them to the captain.

I had long ago fallen into the habit of orienting myself according to the monument’s sides. The northern face was aligned, almost perfectly, to true north, the eastern face almost pe rfectly to true east, the southern to true south, and the western face to true west. The average error was only around three minutes of arc (down to less than two minutes on the southern face) 1 —incredible accuracy for any building in any epoch, and an inexplicable, almost supernatural feat here in Egypt 4500 years ago when the Great Pyramid was supposed to have been built. An error of three arc minutes represents an infinitesimal deviation from true of less than 0.015 per cent. In the opinion of structural engineers, with whom I had discussed the Great Pyramid, the need for such precision was impossible to understa nd. From their point of view as practical builders, the expense, diffi culty and time spent achieving it would not have been justified by the apparent results: even if the base of the monument had been as much as tw o or three degrees out of true (an error of say 1 per cent) the difference to the naked eye would still have been too small to be noticeable. On the other hand the difference in the magnitude of the tasks required (to achieve accuracy within three minutes as opposed to three degrees) would have been immense.  1 The Pyramids of Egypt, p. 208."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 270 Overview of Giza from the north looking south, with the Great Pyramid in the foreground. Obviously, therefore, the ancient master-builders who had raised the Pyramid at the very dawn of human civilization must have had powerful motives for wanting to get the alignments with the cardinal directions just right. Moreover, since they had achieved their objective with uncanny exactness they must have been highly skilled, knowledgeable and competent people with access to excellent surveying and setting-out equipment. This impression was conf irmed by many of the monument’s other characteristics. For example, it s sides at the base were all almost exactly the same length, demonstrating a margin of error far smaller than modern architects would be required to achieve today in the construction of, say, an average-size office block. This was no office block, however. It was the Great Pyramid of Egypt, one of the largest structures ever built by man and one of the oldest. Its north side was 755 feet 4.9818 inches in length; its west side was 755 feet 9.15 51 inches in length; its east side was 755 feet 10.4937 inches; its so uth side 756 feet 0.9739 inches. 2 This meant that there was a difference of less than 8 inches between its shortest and longest sides: an error am ounting to a tiny fraction of 1 per cent on an average side length of over 9063 inches. Once again, I knew from an engi neering perspective that the bare  2 J. H.

I knew, too, that scholars had not yet come up with a convincing explanation of exactly ho w the Pyramid builders had adhered consistently to such high standards of precision. 3 What really interested me, however, was the even bigger question-mark over another issue: why had they imposed such exacting standards on themselves? If they had permitted a margin of error of 1-2 per cent— instead of less than one-tenth of 1 per cent—they could have simplified their tasks with no apparent loss of quality. Why hadn’t they done so? Why had they insisted on making everyt hing so difficult? Why, in short, in a supposedly ‘primitive’ stone monume nt built more than 4500 years ago were we seeing this strange, ob sessional adherence to machine-age standards of precision? Black hole in history Our plan was to climb the Great Pyramid—something that had been strictly illegal since 1983 when the messy falls of several foolhardy tourists had forced the government of Egypt to impose a ban. I realized that we were being foolhardy too (particularly in attempting the climb at night) and I didn’t feel good about br eaking what was basically a sensible law. By this stage, however, my inte nse interest in the Pyramid, and my desire to learn everythi ng I could about it, had over-ridden my common sense. Now, after parting company with the guard patrol at the north-eastern corner of the monument, we continue d to make our way surreptitiously along the eastern face towards the south-eastern corner. There were dense shadows among the twisted and broken paving stones that separated the Great Pyramid from the three much smaller ‘subsidiary’ pyramids lying immediatel y to its east. Ther e were also three deep and narrow rock-cut pits whic h resembled giant graves. These had been found empty by the archaeolog ists who had excavated them, but were shaped as though they had been intended to enclose the hulls of high-prowed, streamlined boats. Roughly halfway along the Pyramid’ s eastern face we encountered another patrol. This time it consiste d of two guards, one of whom must have been eighty years old. His companion, a teenager with pustulant acne, informed us that the money A li had paid was insufficient and that fifty more Egyptian pounds would be required if we were to proceed. I already had the notes in my hand and gave them to the lad without delay. I was past caring how much this was costing; I just wanted to make the climb and get down and away before dawn without being arrested.  3 The conventional explanations, as given in The Pyramids of Egypt, for example, are entirely unsatisfactory, as Edwards himself admits; see pp. 85-7, 206-41."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 272 We walked on, reaching the south-ea stern corner at a little after 4:15 a.m. Very few modern buildings, even the houses we live in, have corners that consist of perfect ninety degree right angles; it is common for them to be a degree or more out of true . It doesn’t make any difference structurally and nobody notices such minute errors. In the case of the Great Pyramid, however, I knew th at the ancient master-builders had found a way to narrow the margin of error to almost nothing. Thus, while falling short of the perfect ninety degrees, the south-eastern corner achieved an impressive 89° 56’ 27”. The north-eastern corner measured 90° 3’ 2”; the southwestern 90° 0’ 33” , and the north-western was just two seconds of a degree out of true at 89° 59’ 58”. 4 This was, of course, extraordinary. And like almost everything else about the Great Pyramid it was also extremely difficult to explain. Such accurate building techniques—as accu rate as the best we have today— could have evolved only after thou sands of years of development and experimentation. Yet there was no evidence that any process of this kind had ever taken place in Egypt. The Great Pyramid and its neighbours at Giza had emerged out of a black hole in architectural history so deep and so wide that neither its bottom nor it s far side had ever been identified. Ships in the desert Guided by the increasingly perspiring Ali, who had not yet explained why it was necessary for us to circumnavigate the Pyramid before climbing it, we now began to make our way in a westerly direction along the monument’s southern side. Here ther e were two further boat-shaped pits, one of which, although still sealed, had been investigated with fibre-optic cameras and was known to contain a high-prowed sea-going vessel more than 100 feet long. The other pit ha d been excavated in the 1950s. Its contents—an even larger seagoing vessel, a full 141 feet in length 5 —had been placed in the so-called Boat Mu seum, an ugly modern structure that gangled on stilts beneath the south face of the Pyramid. Made of cedarwood, the beautiful ship in the museum was still in perfect condition 4500 years after it had been built. With a displacement of around 40 tons, its design was particularly thought-provoking, incorporating, in the words of one expert, ‘all the sea-going ship’s characteristic properties, with prow and stern soaring upward, higher than in a Viking ship, to ride out the breakers and high seas, not to contend with the little ripples of the Nile.’ 6  4 Ibid., p. 87. 5 See Lionel Casson, Ships and Seafaring in Ancient Times, University of Texas Press, 1994, p. 17; The Ra Expeditions, p. 15. 6 The Ra Expeditions, p. 17."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 273 Another authority felt that the careful and clever design of this strange pyramid boat could potentially have ma de it ‘a far more seaworthy craft than anything available to Columbus’. 7 Moreover, the experts agreed that it had been built to a pattern that could only have been ‘created by shipbuilders from a people with a long , solid tradition of sailing on the open sea.’ 8 Present at the very beginning of Egypt’s 3000-year history, who had those as yet unidentified shipbuilders been? They had not accumulated their ‘long, solid tradition of sailing on the open sea’ while ploughing the fields of the landlocked Nile Valley. So where and when had they developed their maritime skills? There was yet another puzzle. I knew that the Ancient Egyptians had been very good at making scale models and representations of all manner of things for symbolic purposes. 9 I therefore found it hard to understand why they would have gone to the trouble of manufacturing and then burying a boat as big and sophisticated as this if its only function, as the Egyptologists clai med, had been as a token of the spiritual vessel that would carry th e soul of the deceased king to heaven. 10 That could have been achieved as effectively with a much smaller craft, and only one would have been needed, not several. Logic therefore suggested that these gigantic vessels might have been intended for some other purpose altogether, or had some quite different and still unsuspected symbolic significance ... We had reached the rough midpoint of the southern face of the Great Pyramid when we at last realized why we were being taken on this long walkabout. The objective was for us to be relieved of moderate sums of money at each of the four cardinal points. The tally thus far was 30 US dollars at the northern face and 50 Eg yptian pounds at the eastern face. Now I shelled out a further 50 Egyptian pounds to yet another patrol Ali was supposed to have paid off the day before. ‘Ali,’ I hissed, ‘when are we going to climb the Pyramid?’ ‘Right away, Mr. Graham,’ our guid e replied.

It’s a surprisingly difficult thing to do, especially where the Great Pyramid is concerned. Even though its top 31 feet are no longer intact, its presently exposed summit platform st ill stands more than 450 feet above ground level. 1 It consists, moreover, of 203 separate courses of masonry, with the average course height be ing about two and a quarter feet. 2 Averages do not tell you everything , as I discovered soon after we began the climb. The courses turned out to be of unequal depth, some barely reaching knee level while others came up almost to my chest and created formidable obstacles. At the same time the horizontal ledges between each of the steps were very narrow, often only a little wider than my foot, and many of the big limestone blocks, which had looked so solid from below, proved to be crumbling and broken. Somewhere around 30 courses up Sa ntha and I began to appreciate what we had let ourselves in for. Our muscles were aching and our knees and fingers stiff and bruised—yet we were barely one-seventh of the way to the summit and there were still more than 170 courses to climb. Another worry was the vertiginous dr op steadily opening beneath us. Looking down along the ruptured contours that marked the line of the southwestern corner, I was taken aback to see how far we had already climbed and experienced a momentar y, giddying presentiment of how easy it would be for us to fall, head over heels like Jack and Jill, bouncing and jolting over the huge layers of stone, breaking our crowns at the bottom. Ali had permitted a pause of a few moments for us to catch our breaths, but now he signalled that we should press on and began to climb again. Still using the corner as a guideline, he rapidly disappeared into the darkness above. Somewhat less confidently, Santha and I followed. Time and motion The 35th course of masonry was a hard one to clamber over, being made of particularly massive blocks, much la rger than any of the others we had  1 The Pyramids of Egypt, p. 8. 2 Peter Lemesurier, The Great Pyramid: Your Personal Guide, Element Books, Shaftesbury, 1987, p. 225."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 275 so far encountered (except those at the very base) and estimated to weigh between 10 and 15 tons apiece. 3 This contradicted engineering logic and commonsense, both of whic h called for a progressive decrease in the size and weight of the blocks that had to be transported to the summit as the pyramid rose ever high er. Courses 1-18, which diminished from a height of about 55.5 inches at ground level to just over 23 inches at course 17, did obey this rule. Th en suddenly, at course 19, the block height rose again to almost 36 in ches. At the same time the other dimensions of the blocks also increased and their weight grew from the relatively manoeuvrable range of 2- 6 tons that was common in the first 18 courses to the more ponderous and cumbersome range of 10-15 tons. 4 These, therefore, were really big monoliths that had been carved out of solid limestone and raised more than 100 feet into the air before being placed faultlessly in position. To have worked effectively the pyramid builders must have had nerves of steel, the agility of mountain go ats, the strength of lions and the confidence of trained steeplejacks. Wi th the cold morning wind whipping around my ears and threatening to launch me into flight, I tried to imagine what it must have been like for them, poised dangerously at this (and much higher) altitudes, lifting , manoeuvring and positioning exactly an endless production line of chun ky limestone monoliths—the smallest of which weighed as much as two modern family cars. How long had the pyramid taken to complete? How many men had worked on it? The consensus among Egyptologists was two decades and 100,000 men. 5 It was also generally agreed that the construction project had not been a year-round affair but had been confined (through labour force availability) to the annual thre e-month agricultural lay-off season imposed by the flooding of the Nile. 6 As I continued to climb, I reminded myself of the implications of all this. It wasn’t just the tens of thou sands of blocks weighing 15 tons or more that the builders would have had to worry about. Year in, year out, the real crises would have been caused by the millions of ‘average-sized’ blocks, weighing say 2.5 tons, that al so had to be brought to the working plane. The Pyramid has been reliably es timated to consist of a total of 2.3 million blocks. 7 Assuming that the masons worked ten hours a day, 365 days a year, the mathematics indicate that they would have needed to place 31 blocks in position every hour (about one block every two minutes) to complete the Pyramid in twenty years. Assuming that construction work had been confined to the annual three-month lay-off,  3 Dr. Joseph Davidovits and Margie Morris, The Pyramids: An Enigma Solved, Dorset Press, New York, 1988, pp. 39-40. 4 Ibid., p. 37. 5 John Baines and Jaromir Malek, Atlas of Ancient Egypt, Time-Life Books, Virginia, 1990, p. 160; The Pyramids of Egypt, pp. 229-30. 6 The Pyramids of Egypt, p. 229. 7 Ibid., p. 85."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 276 the problems multiplied: four blocks a minute would have had to be delivered, about 240 every hour. Such scenarios are, of course, the stuff construction managers’ nightmares are made of. Imagine, for example, the daunting degree of coordination that must have been maintained between the masons and the quarries to ensure the requisit e rate of block flow across the production site. Imagine also the havo c if even a single 2.5 ton block had been dropped from, sa y, the 175th course. The physical and managerial obstacles seemed staggering on their own, but beyond these was the geometrical challenge represented by the pyramid itself, which had to end up wi th its apex positioned exactly over the centre of its base. Even the minute st error in the angle of incline of any one of the sides at the base would have led to a substantial misalignment of the edges at the apex. Incredible accuracy, therefore, had to be maintained throughout, at every course, hundreds of feet above the ground, with great st one blocks of killing weight. Rampant stupidity How had the job been done? At the last count there were more than thirty competing and conflicting theories attempting to answer that question. The majority of academic Egyptologists have argued that ramps of one kind or another must have been used. This was the opinion, for example, of Professor I.E.S Edwards, a former keeper of Egyptian Anti quities at the British Museum who asserted categorically: ‘Only one me thod of lifting heavy weights was open to the ancient Egyptians, namely by means of ramps composed of brick and earth which sloped upwards from the level of the ground to whatever height was desired.’ 8 John Baines, professor of Egyptology at Oxford University, agreed with Edwards’s analysis and took it further: ‘As the pyramid grew in height, the length of the ramp and the width of its base were increased in order to maintain a constant gradient (abo ut 1 in 10) and to prevent the ramp from collapsing. Several ramps appr oaching the pyramid from different sides were probably used.’ 9 To carry an inclined plane to the top of the Great Pyramid at a gradient of 1:10 would have required a ramp 4800 feet long and more than three times as massive as the Great Pyramid itself (with an estimated volume of 8 million cubic metres as against the Pyrami d’s 2.6 million cubic metres). 10 Heavy weights could not have been dragged up any gradient  8 Ibid., p. 220. 9 Atlas of Ancient Egypt, p. 139. 10 Peter Hodges and Julian Keable, How the Pyramids Were Built, Element Books, Shaftesbury, 1989, p. 123."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 277 steeper than this by any normal means. 11 If a lesser gradient had been chosen, the ramp would have had to be even more absurdly and disproportionately massive. The problem was that mile-long ramps reaching a height of 480 feet could not have been made out of ‘bricks and earth’ as Edwards and other Egyptologists supposed. On the contrary, modern builders and architects had proved that such ramps would have caved in under their own weight if they had consisted of any material less costly and less stable than the limestone ashlars of the Pyramid itself. 12 Since this obviously made no sens e (besides, where had the 8 million cubic metres of surplus blocks been taken after completion of the work?), other Egyptologists had proposed the use of spiral ramps made of mud brick and attached to the sides of the Pyramid. These would certainly have required less material to build, but they would also have failed to reach the top. 13 They would have presented deadly and perhaps insurmountable problems to the teams of men attempting to drag the big blocks of stone around their hair pin corners. And they would have crumbled under constant use. Most pr oblematic of all, such ramps would have cloaked the whole pyramid, th us making it impossible for the architects to check the accuracy of the setting-out during building. 14 But the pyramid builders had checked the accuracy of the setting out, and they had got it right, because the apex of the pyramid was poised exactly over the centre of the base, its angles and its corners were true, each block was in the correct place, and each course had been laid down level—in near-perfect symmetry and with near-perfect alignment to the cardinal points. Then, as though to demonstrate that such tours-de-force of technique were mere trifles, the ancient master-builders had gone on to play some clever mathematical games with the monument’s dimensions, presenting us, for example, as we saw in Chapter Twenty- three, with an accurate use of the transcendental number pi in the ratio of its height to its base perimeter. 15 For some reason, too, it had taken their fancy to place the Great Pyramid almost exactly on the 30th parallel at latitude 29° 58’ 51”. This, as a former astronomer royal of Scotland once observed, was ‘a sensible defalc ation from 30°’, but not necessarily in error: For if the original designer had wished th at men should see with their body, rather than their mental eyes, the pole of the sky from the foot of the Great Pyramid, at an altitude before them of 30°, he would have had to take account of the refraction of the atmosphere; and that would have necessitated the building standing not at  11 Ibid., p. 11. 12 Ibid., p. 13. 13 Ibid., p. 125-6. Failure to reach the top would be because spiral ramps and linked scaffolds overlap and exceed the space ava ilable long before arrival at the summit. 14 Ibid., p. 126. 15 See Chapter Twenty-three; The Pyramids of Egypt, p. 219; Atlas of Ancient Egypt, p. 139."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 278 30° but at 29° 58’ 22”. 16 Compared to the true position of 29° 58’ 51”, this was an error of less than half an arc minute, suggesting once again that the surveying and geodetic skills brought to bear here must have been of the highest order. Feeling somewhat overawed, we cl imbed on, past the 44th and 45th courses of the hulking and enigmatic structure. At the 40th course an angry voice hailed us in Arabic from the plaza below and we looked down to see a tiny, turbaned man dressed in a billowing kaftan. Despite the range, he had unslung his shotgun an d was preparing to take aim at us. The guardian and the vision He was, of course, the guardian of the Pyramid’s western face, the patrolman of the fourth cardinal point, and he had not received the extra funds dispensed to his colleagues of the north, east and south faces. I could tell from Ali’s perspiration th at we were in a potentially tricky situation. The guard was ordering us to come down at once so that he could place us under arre st. ‘This, however, coul d probably be avoided with a further payment,’ Ali explained. I groaned. ‘Offer him 100 Egyptian pounds.’ ‘Too much,’ Ali cautioned, ‘it will make the others resentful. I shall offer him 50.’ More words were exchanged in Ar abic. Indeed, over the next few minutes, Ali and the guard mana ged to have quite a sustained conversation up and down the south-western corner of the Pyramid at 4:40 in the morning. At one point a whistle was blown. Then the guards of the southern face put in a brief appearance and stood in conference with the guard of the western face, who had now also been joined by the two other members of his patrol. Just when it seemed that Ali had lo st whatever argument he was having on our behalf, he smiled and heaved a sigh of relief. ‘You will pay the extra 50 pounds when we have returned to the ground,’ he explained. ‘They’re letting us continue but they say that if any senior officer comes along and sees us they will not be able to help us.’ We struggled upwards in silence for th e next ten minutes or so until we had reached the tooth course—roughly the halfway mark and already well over 250 feet above the ground. We gazed over our shoulders to the southwest, where a once-in-a-lifetime vision of staggering beauty and power confronted us. The crescent m oon, which hung low in the sky to the south-east, had emerged from be hind a scudding cloud bank and projected its ghostly radiance directly at the northern and eastern faces of the neighbouring Second Pyrami d, supposedly buil t by the Fourth  16 Piazzi Smyth, The Great Pyramid: Its Secre ts and Mysteries Revealed, Bell Publishing Company, New York, 1990, p. 80."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 279 Dynasty Pharaoh Khafre (Chephren). This stunning monument, second only in size and majesty to the Great Pyramid itself (being just a few feet shorter and 48 feet narrower at th e base) appeared lit up, as though energized from within, by a pale an d unearthly fire. Be hind it in the distance, slightly offset among the da rk desert shadows, was the smaller Pyramid of Menkaure (Mycerinus), me asuring 356 feet along each side and some 215 feet in height. 17 For a moment, against the glittering backdrop of the inky sky, I experienced the illusion of being in motion, of standing at the stern of some great ship of the heavens and looking back at two other vessels which seemed to follow in my wake, strung out in battle order behind me. So where was this convoy going, th is squadron of pyramids? And were the prodigious structures all the work of megalomaniac pharaohs, as the Egyptologists believed? Or had they been designed by mysterious hands to voyage eternally through time and space towards some as yet unidentified objective? From this altitude, though the southern sky was partially occluded by the vast bulk of the Pyramid of Khafre , I could see all the western sky as it arched down from the celestial north pole towards the distant rim of the revolving planet. Polaris, the Pole Star, was far to my right, in the constellation of the Little Bear. Low on the horizon, about ten degrees north of west, Regulus, the paw-star of the imperial constellation of Leo, was about to set. Under Egyptian skies Just above the 150th course, Ali hissed at us to keep our heads down. A police car had come into view arou nd the north-western corner of the Great Pyramid and was now proceeding along the western flank of the monument with its blue light slowly flashing. We stayed motionless in the shadows until the car had passed. Then we began to climb again, with a renewed sense of urgency, heading as fast as we could towards the summit, which we now imagined we could see jutting out above the misty predawn haze. For what seemed like five minutes we climbed without stopping. When I looked up, however, the top of the Pyramid still seemed as far away as ever. We climbed again, panting and sweating, and once again the summit drew back before us like so me legendary Welsh peak. Then, just when we’d resigned ourselves to an endless succession of such disappointments, we found ourselves at the top, under a breathtaking canopy of stars, more than 450 feet above the surrounding plateau on the most extraordinary viewing platform in the world. To our north and east, sprawled out across the wide, slop ing valley of the River Nile, lay the  17 The Pyramids of Egypt, p. 125."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 280 city of Cairo, a jumble of skyscraper s and flat traditional roofs separated by the dark defiles of narrow street s and interspersed with the needle- point minarets of a thousand and one mosques. A film of reflected street- lighting shimmered over the whole scene, closing the eyes of modern Cairenes to the wonder of the stars but at the same time creating the hallucination of a fairyland illuminate d in greens and reds and blues and sulphurous yellows. I felt privileged to witness this strange, electronic mirage from such an incredible vantage point, perched on the summit platform of the last surviving wonder of the ancient world, hovering in the sky over Cairo like Aladdin on his magic carpet. Not that the 203rd course of the Great Pyramid of Egypt could be described as a carpet! Measuring just under 30 feet on each side (as against the monument’s side length of around 755 feet at the base) it consisted of several hundred waist-high limestone blocks, each of which weighed about five tons. The course was not completely level: a few blocks were missing or broken, an d rising towards the southern end there were the substantial remains of about half an additional step of masonry. Moreover, at the very centre of the platform, someone had arranged for a triangular wooden scaffold to be erected, through the middle of which rose a thick pole, ju st over 31 feet long, which marked the monument’s original true height of 481.3949 feet. 18 Beneath this a scrawl of graffiti had been carved into the limestone by generations of tourists. 19 The complete ascent of the Pyramid had taken us about half an hour and it was now just after 5 a.m., the time of morning worship. Almost in unison, the voices of a thousand an d one muezzins rang out from the balconies of the minarets of Cairo, calling the faithful to prayer and reaffirming the greatness, the indivisibility, the mercy and the compassion of God. Behind me, to the south-west, the top 22 courses of Khafre’s Pyramid, still clad with their original facing stones, seemed to float like an iceberg on the ocean of moonlight. Knowing that we could not stay long in this bewitching place, I sat down and gazed around at the heavens. Over to the west, across limitless desert sands, Regulus had now set be neath the horizon, and the rest of the lion’s body was poised to foll ow. The constellations of Virgo and Libra were also dropping lower in the sky and, much farther to the north, I could see the Great and Little Bears sl owly pacing out their eternal cycle around the celestial pole. I looked south-east across the Nile Valley and there was the crescent moon still spreading its spectral radian ce from the bank of the Milky Way.  18 Ibid., p. 87. 19 ‘One is irritated by the number of imbeciles’ names written everywhere,’ Gustave Flaubert commented in his Letters From Egypt. ‘On the top of the Great Pyramid there is a certain Buffard, 79 rue St Martin, wallpaper manufacturer, in black letters.’"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 281 Following the course of the celestial river, I looked due south: there, crossing the meridian, was the resp lendent constellation of Scorpius dominated by the first-magnitude st ar Antares—a red supergiant 300 times the diameter of the sun. North- east, above Cairo, sailed Cygnus the swan, his tail feathers marked by Dene b, a blue-white supergiant visible to us across more than 1800 light years of interstellar space. Last but not least, in the northern sky, the dragon Draco coiled sinuously among the circumpolar stars. Indeed, 4500 year s ago, when the Great Pyramid was supposedly being built for the Fourth Dynasty Pharaoh Khufu (Cheops), one of the stars of Draco had stood cl ose to the celestial north pole and had served as the Pole Star. This had been alpha Draconis, also known as Thuban. With the passing of the millenni a, however, it had gradually been displaced from its position by the remo rseless celestial mill of the earth’s axial precession so that the Pole Star today is Polaris in the Little Bear. 20 I lay back, cushioned my head in my hands and gazed directly up towards the zenith of heaven. Through the smooth cold stones I rested on, I thought I could sense beneath me, like a living force, the stupendous gravity and mass of the pyramid. Thinking like giants Covering a full 13.1 acres at the base , it weighed about six million tons— more than all the buildings in the Square Mile of the City of London added together, 21 and consisted, as we have seen, of roughl y 2.3 million individual blocks of limestone and granite. To these had once been added a 22-acre, mirror-like cladding consis ting of an estimated 115,000 highly polished casing stones, each weighi ng 10 tons, which had originally covered all four of its faces. 22 After being shaken loose by a massive earthquake in AD 1301, the majority of the facing blocks had subsequently been removed for the construction of Cairo. 23 Here and there around the base, however, I knew that enough had remained in positi on to permit the great nineteenth century archaeologist, W.M. Flinders Petrie, to carry out a detailed study of them. He had been stunned to encounter tolerances of less than one- hundredth of an inch and cemented joints so precise and so carefully aligned that it was impossible to slip even the fine blade of a pocket knife between them. ‘Merely to place such stones in exact contact would be careful work’, he admitted, ‘but to do so with cement in the joint seems almost impossible; it is to be compared to the finest opticians’ work on a  20 Skyglobe 3.6. 21 How the Pyramids Were Built, p. 4-5. 22 Secrets of the Great Pyramid, pp. 232, 244. 23 Ibid., p. 17."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 282 scale of acres.’ 24 Of course, the jointing of the casing stones was by no means the only ‘almost impossible’ featur e of the Great Pyramid. The alignments to true north, south, east and west were ‘almost impossible’, so too were the near- perfect ninety-degree corners, and the incredible symmetry of the four enormous sides. And so were the engineering logistics of raising millions of huge stones hundreds of feet in the air ... Whoever they had been, therefore, the architects, engineers and stonemasons who had designed and successfully built this stupendous monument must indeed have ‘thought like men 100 feet tall’, as Jean- François Champollion, the founder of modern Egyptology, had once observed. He had seen clearly what ge nerations of his successors were to close their eyes to: that the pyramid builders could only have been men of giant intellectual stature. Beside the Egyptians of old, he had added, ‘we in Europe are but Lilliputians.’ 25  24 Cited in Traveller’s Key to Ancient Egypt, p. 90. 25 Ibid., p. 40.

Climbing down the Great Pyramid was more nerve wracking than climbing up. We were no longer struggling ag ainst the force of gravity, so the physical effort was less. But the possibi lities of a fatal fall seemed greatly magnified now that our attention was directed exclusively towards the ground rather than the heavens. We picked our way with exaggerated care towards the base of the enormous mountain of stone, sliding and slithering among the treacherous maso nry blocks, feeling as though we had been reduced to ants. By the time we had completed the descent the night was over and the first wash of pale sunlight was filt ering into the sky. We paid the 50 Egyptian pounds promised to the gu ard of the pyramid’s western face and then, with a tremendous sense of release and exultation, we walked jauntily away from the monument in the direction of the Pyramid of Khafre, a few hundred metres to the south-west. Khufu, Khafre, Menkaure ... Cheops, Chephren, Mycerinus. Whether they were referred to by their Egyptian or their Greek names, the fact remained that these three pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty (2575-2467 BC ) were universally acclaimed as the buil ders of the Giza pyramids. This had been the case at least since Ancient Egyptian tour guides had told the Greek historian Herodotus that the Great Pyramid had been built by Khufu. Herodotus had incorporated this information into the oldest surviving written description of the monuments, which continued: Cheops, they said, reigned for fifty years, and on his death the kingship was taken over by his brother Chephren. He also made a pyramid ... it is forty feet lower than his brother’s pyramid, but otherwise of the same greatness ... Chephren reigned for fifty-six years ... then there succeeded Mycerinus, the son of Cheops ...

All other commentators, up to the present, continued uncritically to follow in the Greek historian’s footsteps. And down the ages—although it had originally be en little more than hearsay—the attribution of the Great Pyramid to Khufu, the Second Pyramid to Khafre and the Third Pyramid to Menkaure had assumed the stature of unassailable fact.

Skirting the immense south-western corner of the Second Pyramid, our eyes were drawn toward s its summit. There we noted again the intact facing stones that still covered its top 22 courses. We also noticed that the first few courses above its base, each of which had a ‘footprint’ of about a dozen acres, were composed of truly massive blocks of limestone, almost too high to clamber over, which were about 20 feet long and 6 feet thick.

Walking due south, parallel to the monument’s scarred western flank, we picked our way along the edge of this trench towards the much smaller Third Pyramid, which lay some 400 metres ahead of us in the desert. Khufu ... Khafre ... Menkau re ... According to all orthodox Egyptologists the pyramids had been built as to mbs—and only as tombs—for these three pharaohs. Yet there were some obvious difficulties with such assertions. For example, the spacious burial chamber of the Khafre Pyramid was empty when it was opened in 1818 by the European explorer Giovanni Belzoni. Indeed, more than empty, the chamber was starkly, austerely bare. The polished granite sarcophagus which lay embedded in its floor had also been found empty, with its lid broken into two pieces nearby. 2 How was this to be explained? To Egyptologists the answer seemed obvious. At some early date, probably not many hundre ds of years after Khafre’s death, tomb robbers must have penetrated the chamber an d cleared all its contents including the mummified body of the pharaoh. Much the same thing seemed to have happened at the smaller Third Pyramid, towards which Sa ntha and I were now wa lking—that attributed to Menkaure. Here the first European to break in had been a British colonel, Howard Vyse, who had entere d the burial cham ber in 1837. He found an empty basalt sarcophagus, an anthropoid coffin lid made of wood, and some bones. The natural assumption was that these were the remains of Menkaure. Modern science had subsequently proved, however, that the bones and coffin lid dated from the early Christian era, that is, from 2500 years after the Pyramid Age, and thus represented the ‘intrusive burial’ of a much later individual (quite a common practice throughout Ancient Egyptian history). As to the basalt sarcophagus—well, it could have belonged to Menkaure. Unfortunately, however, nobody had the opportunity to examine it because it had been lost at sea when the ship on which Vyse sent it to Engl and had sunk off the coast of Spain. 3 Since it was a matter of record that the sarcophagus had been found empty by Vyse, it was once again a ssumed that the body of the pharaoh must have been removed by tomb robbers. A similar assumption had been made about the body of Khufu, which was also missing. Here the scholarly consensus, expressed as well as anyone by George Hart of the Britis h Museum, was that ‘no later than 500 years after Khufu’s funeral’ robbers had forced their way into the Great Pyramid ‘to steal th e burial treasure’. 4 The implication is that this incursion must have occu rred by or before 2000 BC —since Khufu is  2 The Riddle of the Pyramids, p. 54. 3 Ibid., p. 55. 4 George Hart, Pharaohs and Pyramids, Guild Publishing, London, 1991, p. 91."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 286 believed to have died in 2528 BC . 5 Moreover it was assumed by Professor I.E.S Edwards, a leading authority on these matters, that the burial treasure had been removed from the famous inner sanctum now known as the King’s Chamber and that the empty ‘granite sarcophagus’ which stood at the western end of that sa nctum had ‘once cont ained the King’s body, probably enclosed within an inner coffin made of wood’. 6 All this is orthodox, mainstream , modern scholarship, which is unquestioningly accepted as historic al fact and taught as such at universities everywhere. 7 But suppose it isn’t fact. The cupboard was bare The mystery of the missing mummy of Khufu begins with the records of Caliph Al-Ma’mun, a Muslim governor of Cairo in the ninth century AD . He had engaged a team of quarriers to tunnel their way into the pyramid’s northern face, urging them on with promises that they would discover treasure. Through a series of lu cky accidents ‘Ma’mun’s Hole’, as archaeologists now refer to it, had joined up with one of the monument’s several internal passageways, th e ‘descending corridor’ leading downwards from the original concealed doorway in the northern face (the location of which, though known in cl assical times, had been forgotten by Ma’mun’s day). By a further lucky acci dent the vibrations that the Arabs had caused with their battering rams and drills disl odged a block of limestone from the ceiling of the descending corridor. When the socket from which it had fallen was examined it was found to conceal the opening to another corridor, this time ascending into the heart of the pyramid. There was a problem, however. The opening was blocked by a series of enormous plugs of solid granite, clearly contemporaneous with the construction of the monument, which were held in place by a narrowing of the lower end of the corridor. 8 The quarriers were unable either to break or to cut through the plugs. They therefore tunnelled into the slightly softer limestone surrounding them and, after several weeks of backbreaking toil, rejoined the ascending corridor higher up— having bypassed a formidable obstacle never before breached. The implications were obvious. Sinc e no previous treasure-seekers had penetrated this far, the interior of the pyramid must still be virgin territory. The diggers must have licked their lips with anticipation at the  5 Atlas of Ancient Egypt, p. 36. 6 The Pyramids of Egypt, pp. 94-5. 7 The Pyramids of Egypt by Professor I. E. S.

Similarly—though perhaps for differen t reasons, Ma’mun must have been impatient to be the first into any chambers that lay ahead. It was reported that his primary motive in initiating this investigation had not been an ambition to increase his vast personal wealth but a desire to gain access to a storehouse of ancient wisdom and technology which he believed to lie buried within the monument. In this repository, according to age-old tradition, the pyramid builders had plac ed ‘instruments of iron and arms which rust not, and glasse which mi ght be bended and yet not broken, and strange spells ...’ 9   9 John Greaves, Pyramidographia, cited in Serpent in the Sky, p. 230."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 288 The Great Pyramid: entrance and plugging blocks in the ascending corridor."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 289 The Great Pyramid: detail of corridors, shafts and chambers. But Ma’mun and his men found noth ing, not even any down-to-earth treasure—and certainly not any high-tech, anachronistic plastic or instruments of iron or rustproof we apons ... or strange spells either. The erroneously named ‘Queen’s Chamber’ (which lay at the end a long horizontal passageway that branched off from the ascending corridor) turned out to be completely empt y—just a severe, geometrical room. 10 More disappointing still, the King’s Chamber (which the Arabs reached after climbing the imposing Grand Gall ery) also offered little of interest. Its only furniture was a granite coffer just big enough to contain the body of a man. Later identified, on no very good grounds, as a ‘sarcophagus’, this undecorated stone bo x was approached with trepidation by Ma’mun and his team, who found it to be lidle ss and as empty as everything else in the pyramid. 11 Why, how and when exactly had the Great Pyramid been emptied of its contents? Had it been 500 years after Khufu’s death, as the Egyptologists suggested? Or was it not more likely, as the evidence was beginning to suggest, that the inner chambers of the pyramid had been empty all along, from the very beginning, that is, from the day that the monument had originally been sealed? Nobody, af ter all, had reached the upper part of the ascending corridor before Ma’mun and his men. And it was certain, too, that nobody had cut through the granite plugs blocking the entrance to that corridor.

Farther down the descending corridor, more than 200 feet beyond the point where the plugged end of the ascending corridor had been found, lies the concealed entrance to anot her secret passageway, deep within the subterranean bedrock of the Giza plateau. If Ma’mun had discovered this passageway, he could have save d himself a great deal of trouble, since it provided a readymade route around the plugs blocking the ascending corridor. His attention, ho wever, had been distracted by the challenge of tunnelling past those plugs, and he made no effort to investigate the lower reaches of the descending corridor (which he ended up using as a dump for the tons of stone his diggers removed from the core of the pyramid). 12 The full extent of the descending corridor was, however, well-known and explored in classical times. The Graeco-Roman geographer Strabo left quite a clear description of the large subterranean chamber it debouched into (at a depth of almo st 600 feet below the apex of the pyramid). 13 Graffiti from the period of th e Roman occupation of Egypt was also found inside this underground ch amber, confirming that it had once been regularly visited. Yet, because it had been so cunningly hidden in the beginning, the secret doorway leading off to one side about two- thirds of the way down the western wall of the descending corridor, remained sealed and undiscovered until the nineteenth century. 14 What the doorway led to was a na rrow well-shaft, about 160 feet in extent, which rose almost vertica lly through the bedrock and then through more than twenty complete courses of the Great Pyramid’s limestone core blocks, until it joined up with the main internal corridor system at the base of the Grand Gallery. There is no evidence to indicate what the purpose of this strange ar chitectural feature might have been (although several scholars have hazarded guesses). 15 Indeed the only thing that is clear is that it was engi neered at the time of the construction of the pyramid and was not the result of an intrusion by tunnelling tomb- robbers. 16 The question remains open, however, as to whether tomb- robbers might have discovered the hidden entrance to the shaft, and made use of it to siphon off the tr easures from the King’s and Queen’s Chambers. Such a possibility cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, a review of the  12 Secrets of the Great Pyramid, p. 58. 13 The Geography of Strabo, (trans. H. L. Jones), Wm.

This could not have been achieved by accident."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 291 historical record indicates little in its favour. For example, the upper end of the well-shaft was entered off the Grand Gallery by the Oxford astronomer John Greaves in 1638. He managed to descend to a depth of about sixty feet . In 1765 another Briton, Nathaniel Davison, penetrated to a depth of about 150 feet but found his way blocked by an impenetrable mass of sa nd and stones. Later, in the 1830s, Captain G.B. Caviglia, an Italian adventurer, reached the same depth and encountered the same obstacle. More enterprising than his predecessors, he hired Arab workers to start excavating the rubble in the hope that there might be something of interest beneath it. Several days of digging in claustrophobic conditions follow ed before the connection with the descending corridor was discovered. 17 Is it likely that such a cramped, blocked-up shaft could have been a viable conduit for the treasures of Khufu, supposedly the greatest pharaoh of the magnificent Fourth Dynasty? Even if it hadn’t been choked with de bris and sealed at the lower end, it could not have been used to bring out more than a tiny fraction of the treasures of a typical royal tomb. This is because the well-shaft is only three feet in diameter an d incorporates several tricky vertical sections. At the very least, therefore, when Ma’mun and his men battered their way into the King’s Chamber around the year AD 820, one would have expected some of the bigger and heavier pieces from the original burial to be still in place—like the statues and shrines that bulked so large in Tutankhamen’s much later and presumably inferior tomb. 18 But nothing was found inside Khufu’s Pyramid, maki ng this and the alleged looting of Khafre’s monument the only tomb robberies in the history of Egypt which achieved a clean sweep, leaving not a single trace behind—not a torn cloth, not a shard of broken pottery, not an unwanted figurine, not an overlooked piece of jewellery—just the bare floors and walls and the gaping mouths of empty sarcophagi. Not like other tombs It was now after six in the morning and the rising sun had bathed the summits of Khufu’s and Khafre’s Pyrami ds with a fleeting blush of pastel- pink light. Menkaure’s Pyramid, bein g some 200 feet lower than the other two, was still in shadow as Santha and I skirted its north-western corner and continued our walk into the roll ing sand dunes of the surrounding desert.

It was not just a matter of the narrowness and unsuitability of the well-shaft as an escape route for bulky treasures. The other remarkable feature of Khufu’s Pyramid was the absence of inscriptio ns or decorations anywhere within its immense network of galleries, corridors, passageways and chambers, and the same was true of Khafre’s and Menkaure’s Pyramids. In none of these amazing monuments had a single word been written in praise of the pharaohs whose bodies they were supposed to house. This was exceptional. No other prov en burial place of any Egyptian monarch had ever been found undec orated. The fashion throughout Egyptian history had been for the tombs of the pharaohs to be extensively decorated, beautifully painted from top to bottom (as in the Valley of the Kings at Luxor, for example) and dens ely inscribed with the ritual spells and invocations required to assist the deceased on his journey towards eternal life (as in the Fifth Dynasty pyramids at Saqqara, just twenty miles to the south of Giza.) 19 Why had Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure done things so differently? Had they not built their monuments to serve as tombs at all, but for another and more subtle purpose? Or was it po ssible, as certain Arab and esoteric traditions maintained, that the Giza pyramids had been erected long before the Fourth Dynasty by the ar chitects of some earlier and more advanced civilization? Neither hypothesis was popular with Egyptologists for reasons that were easy to understand. Moreover, while conceding that the Second and Third Pyramids were completely devoid of internal inscriptions, lacking even the names of Khafre and Menkaure, the scholars were able to cite certain hieroglyphic ‘quarry marks’ (graffiti daubed on stone blocks before they left the quarry) found inside the Great Pyramid, which did seem to bear the name of Khufu. A certain smell ... The discoverer of the quarry marks was Colonel Howard Vyse, during the destructive excavations he undertook at Giza in 1837. Extending an existing crawlway, he cut a tunnel into the series of narrow cavities, called ‘relieving chambers’, which lay directly above the King’s Chamber. The quarry marks were found on the walls and ceilings of the top four of these cavities and said things like this: THE CRAFTSMEN-GANG, HOW POWERFUL IS THE WHITE CROWN OF KHNUM—  19 See Valley of the Kings; for Saqqara (Fifth and Sixth Dynasties) see Traveller’s Key to Ancient Egypt, pp. 163-7."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 293 KHUFU KHUFU KHNUM-KHUFU YEAR SEVENTEEN 20 It was all very convenient. Right at the end of a costly and otherwise fruitless digging season, just when a major archaeological discovery was needed to legitimize the expenses he had run up, Vyse had stumbled upon the find of the decade—the first incontrovertible proof that Khufu had indeed been the builder of the hitherto anonymous Great Pyramid. One would have thought that a discovery of this nature would have settled conclusively any lingering do ubts over the ownership and purpose of that enigmatic monument. But the doubts remained, largely because, from the beginning, ‘a certain smell’ hung over Vyse’s evidence: 1 It was odd that the marks were the only signs of the name Khufu ever found anywhere inside the Great Pyramid. 21 2 It was odd that they had been foun d in such an obscure, out-of-the- way corner of that immense building. 3 It was odd that they had been found at all in a monument otherwise devoid of inscriptions of any kind. 4 And it was extremely odd that they had been found only in the top four of the five relieving chambers .

I know of one plausible case made to suggest he was exactly that, 24 and although final proof will probably al ways be lacking, it seemed to me incautious of academic Egyptology to have accepted the authenticity of the quarry marks without question. Besides, there was alternative hieroglyphic evidence, arguably of purer provenance, which appeared to indicate that Khufu could not have bu ilt the Great Pyramid. Strangely, the same Egyptologists who readily ascribed immense importance to Vyse’s  20 The Pyramids of Egypt, p. 211-12; The Great Pyramid: Your Personal Guide, p. 71. 21 Pyramids of Egypt, pp. 96. 22 Secrets of the Great Pyramid, p. 35-6. 23 Zecharia Sitchin, The Stairway To Heaven, Avon Books, New York, 1983, pp. 253-82. 24 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 294 quarry marks were quick to downplay the significance of these other, contradictory, hieroglyphs, which ap peared on a rectangular limestone stela which now stood in the Cairo Museum. 25 The Inventory Stela, as it was called, had been discovered at Giza in the nineteenth century by the French ar chaeologist Auguste Mariette. It was something of a bombshell because its text clearly indicated that both the Great Sphinx and the Great Pyramid (as well as several other structures on the plateau) were already in existence long before Khufu came to the throne. The inscription also referred to Isis as the ‘Mistress of the Pyramid’, implying that the monu ment had been dedicated to the goddess of magic and not to Khufu at all. Finally, there was a strong suggestion that Khufu’s pyramid might have been one of the three subsidiary structures alongside the Great Pyramid’s eastern flank. 26 All this looked like damaging eviden ce against the orthodox chronology of Ancient Egypt. It also challenged the consensus view that the Giza pyramids had been built as tombs and only as only. However, rather than investigating the anachronistic stat ements in the Inventory Stela, Egyptologists chose to devalue them. In the words of the influential American scholar James He nry Breasted, ‘These re ferences would be of the highest importance if the stela were contemporaneous with Khufu; but the orthographic evidences of its late date are entirely conclusive ...’ 27 Breasted meant that the nature of the hieroglyphic writing system used in he inscription was not consistent with that used in the Fourth Dynasty but belonged to a more recent epoc h: All Egyptologists concurred with this analysis and the final judgement, still accepted today, was that the stela had been carved in the Twenty-F irst Dynasty, about 1500 years after Khufu’s reign, and was therefore to be regarded as a work of historical fiction. 28 Thus, citing orthographic evidence, an entire academic discipline found reason to ignore the boat-rocking implications of the Inventory Stela and at no time gave proper consideration to the possibility that it could have been based upon a genuine Fourth Dy nasty inscription (just as the New English Bible, for example, is based on a much older original). Exactly the same scholars, however, had accepted the authenticity of a set of dubious ‘quarry marks’ without demur, turning a blind eye to their orthographic and other peculiarities. Why the double standard? Could it have been because the information contained in the ‘quarry marks’ conformed strictly to orthodox opinion that the Great Pyramid had been built as a tomb for Khufu? whereas the  25 James Henry Breasted, Ancient Records of Egypt: Historical Documents from the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest, reprinted by Histories and Mysteries of Man Ltd., London, 1988, pp. 83-5. 26 Ibid., p. 85. 27 Ibid., p. 84. 28 Ibid., and Travellers Key to Ancient Egypt, p. 139."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 295 information in the Inventory Stela contradicted that opinion? Overview By seven in the morning Santha and I had walked far out into the desert to the south-west of the Giza pyramids and had made ourselves comfortable in the lee of a huge dune that offered an unobstructed panorama over the entire site. The date, 16 March, was just a few da ys away from the Spring Equinox, one of the two occasions in the year when the sun rose precisely due east of wherever you stood in the world. Ticking out the days like the pointer of a giant metronome, it had bisected the horizon this morning at a point a hair’s breadth south of due east and had already climbed high enough to shrug off the Nile mists which clung like a shroud to much of the city of Cairo. Khufu, Khafre, Menkaure ... Cheops, Chephren, Mycerinus. Whether you called them by their Egyptian or their Greek names, there was no doubt that the three famous pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty had been commemorated by the most splendid , the most honourable, the most beautiful and the most enormous monuments ever seen anywhere in the world. Moreover, it was clear that th ese pharaohs must indeed have been closely associated with the monuments, not only because of the folklore passed on by Herodotus (which surely had some basis in fact) but because inscriptions and references to Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure had been found in moderate quantities, outside the three major pyramids, at several different parts of the Giza ne cropolis. Such finds had been made consistently in and around the six su bsidiary pyramids, three of which lay to the east of the Great Pyramid and the other three to the south of the Menkaure Pyramid. Since much of this external evidence was ambiguous and uncertain, I found it difficult to understand why the Egyptologists were happy to go on citing it as confirmation of the ‘tombs and tombs only’ theory. The problem was that this same evidence was capable of supporting— as equally valid—a number of diff erent and mutually contradictory interpretations. To give just one example, the ‘close association’ observed between the three great pyra mids and the three Fourth Dynasty pharaohs could indeed have come about because these pharaohs had built the pyramids as their tombs. Bu t it could also have come about if the gigantic monuments of the Giza plateau had been standing long before the dawn of the historical civilization known as Dynastic Egypt. In that case, it was only necessary to assume that in due course Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure had come along and built a number of the subsidiary structures around the th ree older pyramids—something that they would have had every reason to do because in this way they could have appropriated the high pres tige of the original anonymous"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 296 monuments (and would, almost certainl y, be viewed by posterity as their builders). There were other possibilities too. The point was, however, that the evidence for exactly who had built which great pyramid, when and for what purpose was far too thin on the ground to justify the dogmatism of the orthodox ‘tombs and tombs only ’ theory. In all honesty, it was not clear who built the pyramids. It was not clear in what epoch they had been built. And it was not at all clear what their function had been. For all these reasons they were surrounded by a wonderful, impenetrable air of mystery and as I gazed down at them out of the desert they seemed to march towards me across the dunes ..."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 297 Chapter 36 Anomalies Viewed from our vantage point in the desert south west of the Giza necropolis, the site plan of the three great pyramids seemed majestic but bizarre. Menkaure’s pyramid was closest to us, with Khafre’s and Khufu’s monuments behind it to the north-ea st. These two were situated along a near perfect diagonal—a straight line connecting the south-western and north-eastern corners of the pyramid of Khafre would, if extended to the north-east, also pass through the south-western and north-eastern corners of the Great Pyramid. This, presumably, was not an accident. From where we sat, however, it was easy to see that if the same imaginary straight line was extend ed to the south-west it would completely miss the Third Pyramid, the entire body of which was offset to the east of the principal diagonal. Egyptologists refused to recognize any anomaly in this. Why should they? As far as they were concerned there was no site plan at Giza. The pyramids were tombs and tombs only, built for three different pharaohs over a period of about seventy-five years. 1 It made sense to assume that each ruler would have sought to express his own personality and idiosyncrasies through his monument, and this was probably why Menkaure had ‘stepped out of line’. The Egyptologists were wrong. Though I was unaware of it that March morning in 1993, a breakthrough ha d been made prov ing beyond doubt that the necropolis did have an overa ll site plan, which dictated the exact positioning of the three py ramids not only in rela tion to one another but in relation to the River Nile a few kilo metres east of the Giza plateau. With eerie fidelity, this immense an d ambitious layout modelled a celestial phenomenon 2 —which was perhaps why Eg yptologists (who pride themselves on looking exclusively at the ground beneath their feet) had failed to spot it. On a truly giant scale, as we see in later chapters, it also reflected the same obsessive concern with orientations and dimensions demonstrated in each of the monuments. A singular oppression ... Giza, Egypt, 16 March 1993, 8 a.m. At a little over 200 feet tall (and with a side length at the base of 356  1 Atlas of Ancient Egypt, p. 36. 2 The Orion Mystery."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 298 feet) the Third Pyramid was less than half the height and well under half the mass of the Great Pyramid. Nevert heless, it possessed a stunning and imposing majesty of its own. As we stepped out of the desert sunlight and into its huge geometrical shadow, I remembered what the Iraqi writer Abdul Latif had said about it when he had visited it in the twelfth century: ‘It appears small compared with the other two; but viewed at a short distance and to the exclusion of these, it excites in the imagination a singular oppression and cannot be contemplated without painfully affecting the sight ...’ 3 The lower sixteen courses of the monu ment were still cased, as they had been since the beginni ng, with facing blocks quarried out of red granite (‘so extremely hard’, in Abdul Latif s words, ‘that iron takes a long time, with difficulty, to make an impression on it’). 4 Some of the blocks were very large; they were also closely and cunningly fitted together in a complex interlocking jigsaw-puzzle pattern strongly reminiscent of the cyclopean masonry at Cuzco, Machu Picchu and other locations in far-off Peru. As was normal, the entrance to the Third Pyramid was situated in its northern face well above the ground. Fr om here, at an angle of 26° 2’, a descending corridor lanced arrow-straight down into the darkness. 5 Oriented exactly north to south, this corridor was rectangular in section and so cramped that we had to bend al most double to fit into it. Where it passed through the masonry of th e monument its ceiling and walls consisted of well-fitted granite blocks . More surprisingly , these continued for some distance below ground level. At about seventy feet from the entrance, the corridor levelled off and opened out into a passageway where we could stand up. This led into a small ante-chamber with carved pane lling and grooves cut into its walls, apparently to take portcullis slabs. Reaching the end of the chamber, we had to crouch again to enter another corridor. Bent double, we proceeded south for about forty feet before re aching the first of the three main burial chambers—if burial chambers they were. These sombre, soundless rooms were all hewn out of solid bedrock. The one that we stood in was rectangu lar in plan and oriented east to west. Measuring about 30 feet long x 15 wide x 15 high , it had a flat ceiling and a complex internal structure with a large, irregular hole in its western wall leading into a dark, cave -like space beyond. There was also an opening near the centre of the floor which gave access to a ramp, sloping westwards, leading down to even deeper levels. We descended the ramp. It terminated in a short, horizontal passage to the right of which, entered through a narrow d oorway, lay a small empty chamber, Six cells, like the sleeping quarters of medieval monks, had been hewn  3 Abdul Latif, The Eastern Key, cited in Traveller’s Key to Ancient Egypt, p. 126. 4 Ibid. 5 Blue Guide: Egypt, A & C Black, London, 1988, p. 433."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 299 out of its walls: four on the eastern si de and two to the north. These were presumed by Egyptologists to have functioned as ‘magazines ... for storing objects which the dead king wished to have close to his body.’ 6 Coming out of this chamber, we turned right again, back into the horizontal passage. At its end lay another empty chamber, 7 the design of which is unique among the pyramids of Egypt. Some twelve feet long by eight wide, and oriented north to south, its walls and extensively broken and damaged floor were fashioned out of a peculiarly dense, chocolate- coloured granite which seemed to absorb light and sound waves. Its ceiling consisted of eighteen huge sl abs of the same material, nine on each side, laid in facing gables. Because they had had been hollowed from below to form a markedly concave surface, the effect of these great monoliths was of a perfect barrel vault, much as one might expect to find in the crypt of a Romanesque cathedral. Retracing our steps, we left the lowe r chambers and walked back up the ramp to the large, flat-roofed, rock-hewn room above. Passing through the ragged aperture in its wester n wall, we found ourselves looking directly at the upper si des of the eighteen slabs which formed the ceiling of the chamber below. From this pers pective their true form as a pointed gable was immediately apparent. What was less clear was how they had been brought in here in the first pl ace, let alone laid so perfectly in position. Each one must have weighe d many tons, heavy enough to have made them extremely difficult to handle under any circumstances. And these were no ordinary circumstances. As though they had set out deliberately to make things more co mplicated for themselves (or perhaps because they found such tasks simple?) the pyramid builders had disdained to provide an adequate wo rking area between the slabs and the bedrock above them. By crawling into the cavity, I was able to establish that the clearance varied from approx imately two feet at the southern end to just a few inches at the northern end. In such a rest ricted space there was no possibility that the monoliths could have been lowered into position. Logically, therefore, they must have been raised from the chamber floor, but how had that been done? The chamber was so small that only a few men could have worked inside it at any one time—too few to have had the muscle-power to lift the slabs by brute force. Pulleys were not supposed to have existed in the Pyramid Age 8 (even if they had, there would have been insufficient room to set up block-and-tackle). Had some unknown system of levers been used? Or might there be more substance than scholars realized to the Ancient Egyptian legends that spoke of huge  6 The Pyramids of Egypt, p. 127. 7 It was in this chamber that Vyse found the intrusive burial (of bones and a wooden coffin lid) referred to in Chapter Thirty-Five.

Moreover, if Egyptolo gists were to be believed, the construction work had supposedly been undertaken at the dawn of human civilization by a people who had not accumulated any experience of massive construction projects. This was, of course, a startling cultural paradox, and one for to which no adequate explanation had ever been offered by an orthodox academic. The moving finger writes and having writ it moves on Leaving the underground chambers, which seemed to vibrate at the core of the Third Pyramid like the convoluted, multi-valved heart of some slumbering Leviathan, we made our way along the narrow entrance corridor and into the open air. Our objective now was the Second Pyramid. We walked along its western flank (just under 708 feet in length), turned right and eventually came to the point on its north side, about 40 feet east of the main north- south axis, where the principal entran ces were located. One of these was carved directly into the bedrock at gr ound level about 30 feet in front of the monument; the other was cut into the northern face at a height of just under 50 feet. From the latter a corridor sloped downwards at an angle of 25° 55’. 10 From the former, by which we now entered the pyramid, another descending corri dor led deeply underground then levelled off for a short distance, givi ng access to a subterranean chamber, then ascended steeply and finally levell ed off again into a long horizontal passageway, heading due south (into which also fed the upper corridor that sloped down from the entrance in the north face). High enough to stand up in, and lined at first with granite and then with smoothly polished limestone, the hori zontal passageway was almost at ground level, that is, it lay directly beneath the pyramid’s lowest course of masonry. It was also extremely long, running dead straight for a further 200 feet until it debouched in the single ‘burial chamber’ at the heart of the monument. As we have already noted, no mummy had ever been found in this latter chamber, nor any inscriptions, with th e result that the so-called Pyramid of Khafre was wholly anonymous. La tter-day adventurers had, however, carved their names on to its walls—notably the former circus strongman Giovanni Battista Belzoni (1778-1823 ) who had forced his way into the  9 See, for example, Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection, volume II, p. 180. 10 The Pyramids of Egypt, p. 117."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 301 monument in 1818.

I found myself wondering yet again why Egyptologists were so unwilling to consider the possibility that the funerary complex might have been Khafre’s work and the pyramid someone else’s?

Khufu’s father Sneferu, the first king of the Fourth Dynasty, was believed to have built the so-cal led ‘Bent’ and ‘Red’ Pyramids at Dahshur, about thirty miles south of Giza—an attribution that was itself mysterious (if pyramids were indeed tombs) since it seemed strange that one pharaoh required two pyramids to be buried in. Sneferu was also credited by some Egyptologists with the construction of the ‘Collapsed’ Pyramid at Meidum (although a number of authorities insisted that this was the tomb of Huni, the last king of the Third Dynasty). 12 The only other  12 The Riddle of the Pyramids, p. 49."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 303 builders in the Archaic Period had b een Zoser, the second pharaoh of the Third Dynasty, to whom was attributed the construction of the ‘Step Pyramid’ at Saqqara, 13 and Zoser’s successor, Sekhemkhet, whose pyramid also stood at Saqqara. Therefore, despite the lack of inscriptions, it was now assumed as obvious that the three pyramids at Giza must have been built by Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure and must have been intended to serve as their tombs. We need not reiterate here the many shortcomings of the ‘tombs and tombs only’ theory. However, these sh ortcomings were not limited to the Giza pyramids but applied to all the other Third and Fourth Dynasty Pyramids listed above. Not a single one of these monuments had ever been found to contain the body of a pharaoh, or any signs whatsoever of a royal burial. 14 Some of them were not even equipped with sarcophagi, for example the Collapsed Pyramid at Meidum. The Pyramid of Sekhemkhet at Saqqara (first entered in 1954 by the Egyptian Antiquities Organization) did contain a sarcop hagus—one, which had certainly remained sealed and undisturbed since its installation in the ‘tomb’. 15 Grave robbers had never succeeded in fi nding their way to it, but when it was opened, it was empty. 16 So what was going on? How come more than twenty-five million tons of stone had been piled up to form pyra mids at Giza, Dahshur, Meidum and Saqqara if the only point of the exercise had been to install empty sarcophagi in empty chambers?

On the contrary, standing at its base on the north side, I felt fly-sized and puny— an impermanent creature of flesh and blood confronted with the awe- inspiring splendour of eternity. I had the impression that it might have been here for ever, ‘made by some god and set down bodily in the surrounding sand’, as the Greek hist orian Diodorus Siculus commented in the first century BC . 1 But which god had made it, if not the God-King Khufu whose name generations of Egyptians had associated with it? For the second time in twelve hours, I began to climb the monument. Up close in this light, indifferent to human chronologies and subject only to the slow erosive forces of geological time, it reared above me like a frowning, terrifying crag. Fortunately, I only had six courses to clamber over, assisted in places by modern steps, before reaching Ma’mun’s Hole, which now served as the pyramid’s principal entrance. The original entrance, still well-hidden in the ninth century when Ma’mun began tunnelling, was some ten courses higher, 55 feet above ground level and 24 feet east of the main north-south axis. Protected by giant limestone gables, it contained the mouth of the descending corridor, which led downwards at an angle of 26° 31’ 23”. Strangely, although itself measuring only some 3 feet 5 inches x 3 feet 11 inches, this corridor was sandwiched betwee n roofing blocks 8 feet 6 inches thick and 12 feet wide and a flooring slab (known as the ‘Basement Sheet’) 2 feet 6 inches thick and 33 feet wide. 2 Hidden structural features like these abounded in the Great Pyramid, manifesting both incredible comple xity and apparent pointlessness. Nobody knew how blocks of this si ze had been successfully installed, neither did anybody know how they had been set so carefully in alignment with other blocks, or at such precise angles (because, as the reader may have realized, the 26° slope of the descending corridor was part of a deliberate and regular pattern). Nobody knew either why these things had been done. The Beacon Entering the pyramid through Ma’mun’s Ho le did not feel ri ght.

On the one hand, such vandalism se emed gross and irresponsible. On the other, a startling possibility had to be considered: was there not a sense in which the pyramid seemed to have been designed to invite human beings of intelligence and cu riosity to penetrate its mysteries? After all, if you were a pharaoh who wanted to ensure that his deceased body remained inviolate for eternity, would it make better sense (a) to advertise to your own and all subsequent generations the whereabouts of your burial place, or (b) to choose some secret and unknown location, of which you would never speak and wh ere you might never be found? The answer was obvious: you would go for secrecy and seclusion, as the vast majority of the pharaohs of Ancient Egypt had done. 3 Why, then, if it was indeed a ro yal tomb, was the Great Pyramid so conspicuous? Why did it occupy a ground area of more than thirteen acres? Why was it almost 500 feet high?

They must, in short, have wanted this remarkable structure to exert a perennial fascination: to be violated by intruders, to be measured with increasing degrees of exactitude, and to haunt the collective imagination of mankind like a persistent ghost summoning intimations of a profound and long-forgotten secret.  3 In the isolated Valley of the Kings in Luxor in upper Egypt, for example."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 307 Mind games of the pyramid builders The point where Ma’mun’s Hole intersected with the 26° descending corridor was closed off by a modern steel door.

To the south, as we have seen, the corridor sloped down for almost another 350 feet in to the bedrock, before opening out into a huge subterranean chamber 60 0 feet beneath th e apex of the pyramid. The accuracy of this corri dor was astonishing. From top to bottom the average deviation from st raight amounted to less than 1/4- inch in the sides and 3/10-inch on the roof. 4 Passing the steel door, I continued through Ma’mun’s tunnel, breathing in its ancient air and adjusting my ey es to the gloom of the low-wattage bulbs that lit it. Then ducking my head I began to climb through the steep and narrow section hacked upwa rds by the Arab diggers in their feverish thrust to by-pass the series of granite plugs blocking the lower part of the ascending corridor. At the top of the tunnel two of the original plugs could be seen, still in situ but partially exposed by quarrying. Egyptologists assumed that they had been slid into their present position from above 5 —all the way down the lag-foot length of the ascending corridor from the foot of the Grand Gallery. 6 Builders and engineers, however, whose trend of thought was perhaps more practical, had pointed out that it was physically im possible for the plugs to have been installed in this way. Because of the leaf-thin clearance that separated them from the walls, floor and ceiling of the corridor, friction would have foiled any ‘sliding’ operation in a matter of inches, let alone 100 feet. 7 The puzzling implication was therefore that the ascending corridor must have been plugged while the py ramid was still being built. But why would anyone have wished to block the main entrance to the monument at such an early stage in its cons truction (even while continuing to enlarge and elaborate its inner chambe rs)? Moreover, if the objective had been to deny intruders admission, wouldn’t it have been much easier and more efficient to have plugged the descending corridor from its entrance in the north face to a point below its junction with the ascending corridor? That would have been the mo st logical way to seal the pyramid and would have made plugs unnecessary in the ascending corridor. There was only one certainty: since th e beginning of history, the single known effect of the granite plugs ha d not been to prevent an intruder from gaining access ; instead, like Bluebeard’s locked door, the barrier had magnetized Ma’mun’s attention and inflamed his curiosity so that he had felt compelled to tunnel hi s way past them, convinced that  4 The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh, p. 19. 5 Discussed in Secrets of the Great Pyramid, p. 230ff. 6 Dimension from The Traveller’s Key to Ancient Egypt, p. 114. 7 Secrets of the Great Pyramid, p. 230ff."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 308 something of inestimable value must lie beyond them. Might this not have been what the pyramid builders had intended the first intruder who reached this far to feel? It would be premature to rule out such a strange and unsettling possibility. At any rate, thanks to Ma’mun (and to the predictable co nstants of human nature) I was now able to insert myself into the unbl ocked upper section of the original ascending corridor. A smoothly cut aperture measuring 3 feet 5 inches wide x 3 feet 11 inches high (exactly the same dimensions as the descending corridor), it sloped up into the darkness at an angle of 26° 2’ 30” 8 (as against 26° 31’ 23” in the descending corridor). 9 What was this meticulous interest in the angle of 26°, and was it a coincidence that it amounted to half of the angle of inclination of the pyramid’s sides—52°. 10 The reader may recall the significance of this angle. It was a key ingredient of the sophisticated an d advanced formula by which the design of the Great Pyramid had been made to correspond precisely to the dynamics of spherical geometry. Thus the original height of the monument (481.3949 feet), and the pe rimeter of its base (3023.16 feet), stood in the same ratio to each other as did the radius of a sphere to its circumference. This ratio was 2pi (2 x 3.14) and to express it the builders had been obliged to specify the tricky and idiosyncratic angle of 52° for the pyramid’s sides (since any greater or lesser slope would have meant a different height-to-perimeter ratio). In Chapter Twenty-three we saw that the so-called Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan in Mexico also expresse d a knowledge and deliberate use of the transcendental number pi; in its case the height (233.5 feet) stood in a relationship of 4pi to the perimeter of its base (2932.76 feet). 11 The crux, therefore, was that the most remarkable monument of Ancient Egypt and the most remarkable monument of Ancient Mexico both incorporated pi relationships long before and far away from the official ‘discovery’ of this transcendental number by the Greeks. 12 Moreover, the evidence invited the conclusion that something was being signalled by the use of pi— almost certainly the same thing in both cases. Not for the first time, and not for the last, I was overwhelmed by a sense of contact with an ancient inte lligence, not necessarily Egyptian or Mexican, which had found a way to reach out across the ages and draw people towards it like a beacon. So me might look for treasure; others, captivated by the deceptively simple manner in which the builders had used pi to demonstrate their mastery of the secrets of transcendental numbers, might be inspired to search for further mathematical  8 The Pyramids of Egypt, p. 91. 9 Ibid., p. 88. 10 Or 51° 50’ 35” to be exact, Ibid., page 87; Traveller’s Key to Ancient Egypt, p. 112. 11 See Chapter Twenty-three. 12 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 309 epiphanies. Bent almost double, my back brus hing against the polished limestone ceiling, it was with such thoughts in my mind that I began to scramble up the 26° slope of the ascending corridor, which seemed to penetrate the vast bulk of the six million ton bu ilding like a trigonometrical device. After I had banged my head on its ce iling a couple of times, however, I began to wonder why th e ingenious people who’d designed it hadn’t made it two or three feet higher. If they could erect a monument like this in the first place (which they obviousl y could) and equip it with corridors, surely it would not have been beyond their capabilities to make those corridors roomy enough to stand up in? Once again I was tempted to conclude that it was the result of a deliberate decision by the pyramid builders: they had made the ascending corridor this way because they had wanted it this way (rather than because such a design had been forced upon them.) Was there motive in the apparent madness of these archaic mind games? Unknown dark distance At the top of the ascending corridor I emerged into yet another inexplicable feature of the pyramid, ‘the most celebrated architectural work to have survived from the Old Kingdom’ 13 —the Grand Gallery. Soaring upwards at the continuing majestic angle of 26°, and almost entirely vanishing into the airy gloom above, its spacious corbelled vault made a stunning impression. It was not my intention to climb the Grand Gallery yet. Branching off due south at its base was a long horizontal passageway, 3 feet 9 inches high and 127 feet in length, that led to the Queen’s Chamber. 14 I wanted to revisit this room, which I had admired for its stark beauty since becoming acquainted with the Great Pyramid several years previously. Today, however, to my considerable irritation, the passageway was barred within a few feet of its entrance.  13 The Pyramids of Egypt, p. 93. 14 Dimensions from Traveller’s Key to Ancient Egypt, p. 121, and The Pyramids of Egypt, p. 93."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 310 The Grand Gallery and the King’s and Queen’s Chambers with their northern and southern shafts. The reason, though I was unaware of it at the time, was that a German robotics engineer named Rudolf Gant enbrink was at work within, slowly and painstakingly manoeuvring a $250, 000 robot up the narrow southern shaft of the Queen’s Chamber. Hired by the Egyptian Antiquities Organization to improve the ventilation of the Great Pyramid, he had already used his high-tech equipment to clear debris from the King’s Chamber’s narrow ‘southern shaft’ (believed by Egyptologists to have been designed as a ventilation shaft in the first place) and had installed an electric fan at its mouth. At the beginning of March 1993 he transferred his attentions to the Queen’s Chamber, deploying Upuaut, a miniaturized remote-controlled robot camera to explore its southern shaft. On 22 March, some 200 feet al ong the steeply slop ing shaft (which rose at an angle of 39.5° and was only about 8 inches high x 9 inches wide), 15 the floor and walls suddenly became very smooth as Upuaut crawled into a section made of fine Tura limestone, the type normally used for lining sacred areas such as ch apels or tombs.

Why? To make sure they would never be found? Or to make sure that they would be found, some day, under the right circumstances? After all, there had from the beginni ng been two conspicuous shafts in the King’s Chamber, penetrating the north and south walls. It should not have been beyond the mental powers of the pyramid builders to predict that sooner or later some inquiring person would be tempted to look for shafts in the Queen’s Chamber as well. In the event nobo dy did look for more than a thousand years af ter Caliph Ma’mun had opened the monument to the world in AD 820. Then in 1872 an English engineer named Waynman Dixon, a Freemason wh o ‘had been led to suspect the existence of the shafts by their presence in the King’s Chamber above’, 16 went tapping around the Queen’s Ch amber’s walls and located them. He opened the southern shaft first, se tting his ‘carpenter and man-of-all- work, Bill Grundy, to jump a hole with a hammer and steel chisel at that place. So to work the faithful fell ow went, and with a will which soon began to make a way into the soft stone [limestone] at this point, when lo! after a comparatively very few st rokes, flop went the chisel right through into something or other.’ 17 The ‘something or other’ Bill Grundy’s chisel had reached turned out to be ‘a rectangular, horizontal, tubular channel, about 9 inches by 8 inches in transverse breadth and height, go ing back 7 feet into the wall, and then rising at an angle into an unknown, dark distance ...’ 18 It was up that angle, and into that ‘unknown dark distance’, 121 years later, that Rudolf Gantenbrink sent his robot—the technology of our species having finally caug ht up with our powerful instincts to pry. Those instincts were clearly no weaker in 1872 than in 1993; among the many interesting things the remote-control led camera succeeded in filming in the Queen’s Chamber shafts was the far end of a long, sectioned metal rod of nineteenth century design which Waynman Dixon and the faithful Bill Grundy had secretly stuffed up the intriguing channel. 19 Predictably, they had assumed that if the pyramid builders had gone to the trouble of constructing and then concealing the shafts, then they must have hidden something worth looking for inside them. The notion that there might have been an intention from the outset to stimulate such investigations would seem quite implausible if the final upshot of the discovery and exploration of the shafts had been a dead- end. Instead, as we have seen, a door was found—a sliding, portcullis door with curious metal fittings and an enticing gap at its base beneath which the laser-spot projected by Gantenbrink’s robot was seen to  16 The Pyramids of Egypt, p. 92. 17 The Great Pyramid: Its Secrets and Mysteries Revealed, p. 428. 18 Ibid. 19 Presentation at the British Museum, 22 November 1993, by Rudolf Gantenbrink, of footage shot in the shafts by the robot camera Upuaut."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 312 disappear entirely ... Once again there seemed to be a clea r invitation to proceed further, the latest in a long line of invitation s which had encouraged Caliph Ma’mun and his diggers to break into the ce ntral passageways and chambers of the monument, which had waited for Waynman Dixon to test the hypothesis that the walls of the Queen’s Chamber might contain concealed shafts, and which had then waited again until arousing the curiosity of Rudolf Gantenbrink, whose high-tech robot revealed the existence of the hidden door and brought within reach whatever secrets— or disappointments, or further invitations—might lie behind it. The Queen’s Chamber We shall hear more of Rudolf Gantenbrink and Upuaut in later chapters. 16 March 1993, however, knowing noth ing of this, I was frustrated to find the Queen’s Chamber closed, an d glared resentfully through the metal grille that barred its entrance corridor. I remembered that the height of that corridor, 3 feet 9 inches, was not constant. Approximately 110 feet due south from where I stood, and only about 15 feet from the entrance to the Chamber, a sudden downward step in the floor increased the st anding-room to 5 feet 8 inches. 20 Nobody had come up with a convincing expl anation for this peculiar feature. The Queen’s Chamber itself—apparently empty since the day it was built—measured 17 feet 2 inches from north to south and 18 feet 10 inches from east to west. It was equipped with an elegant gabled ceiling, 20 feet 5 inches in height, which lay exactly along the east-west axis of the pyramid. 21 Its floor, however, was the opposite of elegant and looked unfinished. There was a constant salty emanation through its pale, rough- hewn limestone walls, giving rise to much fruitless speculation. In the north and south walls, still bearing the incised legend OPENED 1872, were the rectangular apertures discovered by Waynman Dixon which led into the dark distance of the mysterious shafts. The western wall was quite bare. Offset a little over two feet to the south of its centre line, the eastern wall was dominated by a niche in the form of a corbel vault 15 feet 4 inches high and 5 feet 2 inches wide at the base. Originally 3 feet 5 inches deep, a further cavity had been cut in the back of this niche in medieval times by Arab treasure-seekers looking for hidden chambers. 22 They had found nothing. Egyptologists had also been unab le to come to any persuasive conclusions about the original function of the niche, or, for that matter, of the Queen’s Cham ber as a whole.  20 The Pyramids of Egypt, pp. 92-3. 21 Ibid., p. 92; The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh, p. 23. 22 The Pyramids of Egypt, p. 92."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 313 All was confusion. All was paradox. All was mystery. Instrument The Grand Gallery had its mysteries t oo. Indeed it was among the most mysterious of all the internal featur es of the Great Pyramid. Measuring 6 feet 9 inches wide at the floor, its walls rose vertically to a height of 7 feet 6 inches; above that level seven further courses of masonry (each one projecting inwards some 3 inches beyond the course immediately below it) carried the vault to its full height of 28 feet and its culminating width of 3 feet 5 inches. 23 Remember that structurally the Gallery was required to support, for ever, the multi-million ton weight of the upper three-quarters of the largest and heaviest stone monument ev er built on planet earth. Was it not quite remarkable that a group of supposed ‘technological primitives’ had not only envisaged and designed such a feature but had completed it successfully, more than 4500 years before our time? Even if they had made the Gallery only 20 feet long, and had sought to erect it on a level plane, the task would have been difficult enough— indeed extraordinarily difficult. Bu t they had opted to erect this astonishing corbel vault at a slope of 26°, and to extend its length to a staggering 153 feet. 24 Moreover, they had made it with perfectly dressed limestone megaliths throughout—huge, smoothly polished blocks carved into sloping parallelograms and laid together so closely and with such rigorous precision that the joints were almost invisible to the naked eye. The pyramid builders had also includ ed some interestin g symmetries in their work. For example, the culminating width of the Gallery at its apex was 3 feet 5 inches while its width at the floor was 6 feet 9 inches. At the exact centre of the floor, running the entire length of the Gallery—and sandwiched between flat-topped maso nry ramps each 1 foot 8 inches wide—there was a sunken channel 2 feet deep and 3 feet 5 inches wide. What could have been the purpose of this slot? And why had it been necessary for it to mirror so precisely the width and form of the ceiling, which also looked like a ‘slot’ sand wiched between the two upper courses of masonry? I knew that I was not the first person to have stood at the foot of the Grand Gallery and to have been over taken by the disorienting sense of being ‘in the inside of some enormous instrument of some sort.’ 25 Who was to say that such intuitions we re completely wrong? Or, for that matter, that they were right? No record as to function remained, other than in mystical and symbolic references in certain ancient Egyptian  23 Ibid., p. 93; Traveller’s Key to Ancient Egypt, p. 115. 24 The Pyramids of Egypt, p. 93. 25 Traveller’s Key to Ancient Egypt , p. 115."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 314 liturgical texts. These appeared to indicate that the pyramids had been seen as devices designed to turn dead men into immortal beings: to ‘throw open the doors of the firmament and make a road’, so that the deceased pharaoh might ‘ascend into the company of the gods’. 26 I had no difficulty accepting that such a belief system might have been at work here, and obviously it could have provided a motive for the whole enterprise. Nevertheless, I was still puzzled why more than six million tons of physical apparatus, intricately interlaced with channels and tubes, corridors and chambers, had been deemed necessary to achieve a mystical, spiritual and symbolic objective. Being inside the Grand Gallery did feel like being inside an enormous instrument. It had an undeniable aest hetic impact upon me (admittedly a heavy and domineering one), but it was also completely devoid of decorative features and of anything (fig ures of deities, reliefs of liturgical texts, and so on) which might be su ggestive of worship or religion. The primary impression it conveyed wa s one of strict functionalism and purposefulness—as though it had been built to do a job. At the same time I was aware of its focused solemn ity of style and gravity of manner, which seemed to demand nothing less than serious and complete attention. By now I had climbed st eadily through about half the length of the Gallery. Ahead of me, and behind, shadows and light played tricks amid the looming stone walls. Pausing, I turned my head, looking upwards through the gloom towards the va ulted ceiling which supported the crushing weight of the Great Pyramid of Egypt. It suddenly hit me how da untingly and disturbingly old it was, and how completely my life at this moment depended on the skills of the ancient builders. The hefty blocks that spanned the distant ceiling were examples of those skills—every one of them laid at a slightly steeper gradient than that of the Gallery. As the great archae ologist and surveyor Flinders Petrie had observed, this had been done in order that the lower edge of each stone should hitch like a pawl into a ratchet cut into the top of the walls; hence no stone can press on the one below it, so as to cause a cumulative pressure all down the roof; and each stone is separately upheld by the side walls which it lies across. 27 And this was the work of a people whose civilization had only recently emerged from neolithic hunter-gathering? I began to walk up the Gallery again, using the 2-foot-deep central flooring slot. A modern wooden covering fitted with helpfu l slats and side railings made the ascent relatively ea sy. In antiquity, however, the floor had been smoothly polished limestone, which, at a gradient of 26°, must have been almost impossible to climb. How had it been done? Had it been done at all?  26 The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts, p. 281, Utt. 667A. 27 The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh, p. 25."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 315 Looming ahead at the end of the Grand Gallery was the dark opening to the King’s Chamber beckoning each an d every inquiring pilgrim into the heart of the enigma."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 316 Chapter 38 Interactive Three-Dimensional Game Reaching the top of the Grand Gallery , I clambered over a chunky granite step about three feet high. I remembered that it lay, like the roof of the Queen’s Chamber, exactly along the ea st-west axis of the Great Pyramid, And therefore marked the point of transition between the northern and southern halves of the monument. 1 Somewhat like an altar in appearance, the step also provided a solid horizont al platform immediately in front of the low square tunnel that served as the entrance to the King’s Chamber. Pausing for a moment, I looked back down the Gallery, taking in once again its lack of decoration, its lack of religious iconography, and its absolute lack of any of the recognizable symbolism normally associated with the archaic belief system of the Ancient Egyptians. All that registered upon the eye, along the entire 153 -foot length of this magnificent geometrical cavity, was its disinteres ted regularity and its stark machine- like simplicity. Looking up, I could just make out the opening of a dark aperture, chiselled into the top of the eastern wall above my head. Nobody knew when or by whom this foreboding hole had been cut, or how deep it had originally penetrated. It led to the first of the five relieving chambers above the King’s Chamber and had been extended in 1837 when Howard Vyse had used it to break through to the remaining fo ur. Looking down again, I could just make out the point at the bottom of the Gallery’s western wall where the near-vertical well-shaft began its precipitous 160 foot descent through the core of the pyramid to join the descending corridor far below ground-level. Why would such a complicated appa ratus of pipes and passageways have been required? At first sight it didn’t make sense. But then nothing about the Great Pyramid did make much sense, unless you were prepared to devote a great deal of attention to it. In unpredictable ways, when you did that, it would from time to time reward you. If you were sufficiently numerate, for example, as we have seen, it would respond to your basic inquiries into its height and base perimeter by ‘printing out’ the value of pi. And if you were prepared to investigate further, as we shall see, it would download other useful mathematical tidbits, each a little more complex an d abstruse that its predecessor. There was a programmed feel about th is whole process, as though it had been carefully prearranged.

About four feet farther on, however, I reached the ‘Antecha mber’, where the roof level rose suddenly to 12 feet above the floor. The east and west walls of the Antechamber were composed of red gr anite, into which were cut four opposing pairs of wide parallel slots, assumed by Egyptologists to have held thick portcullis slabs. 2 Three of these pairs of slots extended all the way to the floor, and were empty. The fourth (the northernmost) had been cut down only as far as the roof level of the entry passage (that is, 3 feet 6 inches above floor level) and still contained a hulking sheet of granite, perhaps nine inches thick and six feet high. There was a horizontal space of only 21 inches between this suspended stone portcullis and the northern end of the entry passage from which I had just emerged. There was also a gap of a little over 4 feet deep between the top of the portcullis and the ceiling. Whatever function it was designed to serve it was hard to agree with the Egyptologists that this peculiar structure could have been intended to deny access to tomb robbers.  2 The Pyramids of Egypt, p. 94."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 318 The antechamber. Genuinely puzzled, I ducked under it and then stood up again in the southern portion of the Antechamber, which was some 10 feet long and maintained the same roof height of 12 feet. Though much worn, the grooves for the three further ‘portcul lis’ slabs were sti ll visible in the eastern and western walls. There was no sign of the slabs themselves and, indeed, it was difficult to see how such cumbersome pieces of stone could have been installed in so severely constricted a working space. I remembered that Flinders Petrie, who had systematically surveyed the entire Giza necropolis in the late nineteenth century, had commented on a similar puzzle in the Second Pyra mid: ‘The granite portcullis in the lower passage shows great skill in movi ng masses, as it would need 40 or 60 men to lift it; yet it ha s been moved, and raised into place, in a narrow passage, where only a few men could possibly reach it.’ 3 Exactly the same observations applied to the portcullis slabs of the Great Pyramid. If they were portcullis slabs—gateways capa ble of being raised and lowered. The problem was that the physics of raising and lowering them required they be shorter than the full height of the Antechamber, so that they could be drawn into the roof space to allow the entry and exit of legitimate individuals prior to the closure of the tomb. This meant, of course, that when the bottom edges of the slabs were lowered to the floor to block the Antechamber at that level, an equal and opposite space would have opened up between the top edges of the slabs and the ceiling, through which any enterprising tomb-robber would certainly have been able to climb.  3 The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh, p. 36."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 319 The Antechamber clearly qualified as another of the pyramid’s many thought-provoking paradoxes, in wh ich complexity of structure was combined with apparent pointlessness of function. An exit tunnel, the same height an d width as the en trance tunnel and lined with solid red granite, led off from the Antechamber’s southern wall (also made of granite but incorporatin g a 12-inch thick limestone layer at its very top). After about a further 9 feet the tunnel debouched into the King’s Chamber, a massive sombre re d room made entirely of granite, which radiated an atmosphere of prodigious energy and power.

With a floor consisting of 15 massive granite paving stones, and walls composed of 100 gigantic granite blocks, each weighing 70 tons or more and laid in five courses, and with a ceiling spanned by nine fu rther granite blocks each weighing approximately 50 tons, 4 the effect was of intense and overwhelming compression.

It seemed, more over, as Flinders Petrie admitted with some puzzlement after completi ng his painstaking survey of the Great Pyramid, that these craftsmen had access to tools ‘such as we ourselves have only now reinvented ...’ 9 Petrie examined the sarcophagus particularly closely and reported that it must have been cut out of its surrounding granite block with straight saws ‘8 feet or more in length’. Since the granite was extremely hard, he could only assume that these saws must have had bronze blades (the hardest metal then supposedly available) inset with ‘cutting points’ made of even harder jewels: ‘The character of the work would certainly seem to point to diamond as being the cutting jewel; and only the considerations of its rarity in general, and its abse nce from Egypt, interfere with this conclusion ...’ 10 An even bigger mystery surrounded the hollowing out of the sarcophagus, obviously a far more diffi cult enterprise than separating it from a block of bedrock. Here Petrie concluded that the Egyptians must have: adapted their sawing principle into a circular instead of a rectilinear form, curving the blade round into a tube, which drilled out a circular groove by its rotation; thus by breaking away the cores left in su ch grooves, they were able to hollow out large holes with a minimum of labour. These tubular drills varied from 1/4 inch to 5 inches diameter, and from 1/30 to 1/5 inch thick ... 11 Of course, as Petrie admitted, no actu al jewelled drills or saws had ever been found by Egyptologists. 12 The visible evidence of the kinds of drilling and sawing that had been done, however, compelled him to infer that such instruments must have existed. He became especially interested in this and extended his study to include not only the King’s Chamber sarcophagus but many other granite artefacts and granite ‘drill cores’ which he collecte d at Giza. The deeper his research, however, the more puzzling the stone-cutting technology of the Ancient Egyptians became: The amount of pressure, shown by the rapidity with which the drills and saws pierced through the hard stones, is very surprising; probably a load of at least a ton or two was placed on the 4-inch drills cutting in granite.

Nor was he able to explain the kind of instru ment used to cut hieroglyphs into a number of diorite bowls with Fourth Dynasty inscriptions which he found at Giza: ‘The hieroglyphs are incised wi th a very free-cutting point; they are not scraped or ground out, but are ploughed through the diorite, with rough edges to the line ...’ 14 This bothered the logical Petrie because he knew that diorite was one of the hardest stones on earth, far harder even than iron. 15 Yet here it was in Ancient Egypt being cut with incredib le power and precision by some as yet unidentified graving tool: As the lines are only 1/150 inch wide it is evident that the cutting point must have been much harder than quartz; and tough enough not to splinter when so fine an edge was being employed, probably only 1/ 200 inch wide. Parallel lines are graved only 1/30 inch apart from centre to centre. 16 In other words, he was envisaging an instrument with a needle-sharp point of exceptional, unprecedented hardness capable of penetrating and furrowing diorite with ease, and ca pable also of withstanding the enormous pressures required throughout the operation. What sort of instrument was that? By what mean s would the pressure have been applied? How could sufficient accuracy have been maintained to scour parallel lines at intervals of just 1/30-inch? At least it was possible to conjure a mental picture of the circular drills with jewelled teeth which Petrie suppo sed must have been used to hollow out the lung’s Chamber sarcophagus. I found, however, that it was not so easy to do the same for the unknown instrument capable of incising hieroglyphs into diorite at 2500 BC , at any rate not without assuming the existence of a far higher level of technology than Egyptologists were prepared to consider. Nor was it just a few hieroglyphs or a few diorite bowls. During my travels in Egypt I had examined many stone vessels—dating back in some cases to pre-dynastic times—that had been mysteriously hollowed out of a range of materials such as diorite, basalt, quartz crystal and metamorphic schist. 17 For example, more than 30,000 such vessels had been found in the chambers beneath the Third Dynasty Step Pyramid of Zoser at Saqqara. 18 That meant that they were at least as old as Zoser himself (i.e. around 2650 BC 19 ). Theoretically, they could have been even older than that,  14 Ibid., pp. 74-5. 15 The Pyramids: An Enigma Solved, p. 8. 16 The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh, p. 75. 17 The Pyramids: An Enigma Solved, p. 118. 18 Egypt: Land of the Pharaohs, Time-Life Books, 1992, p. 51. 19 Atlas of Ancient Egypt, p. 36."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 322 because identical vessels had been foun d in pre-dynastic strata dated to 4000 BC and earlier, 20 and because the practice of handing down treasured heirlooms from generation to generation had been deeply ingrained in Egypt si nce time immemorial. Whether they were made in 2500 BC or in 4000 BC or even earlier, the stone vessels from the Step Pyramid were remarkable for their workmanship, which once again seemed to have been accomplished by some as yet unimagined (and, indeed, almost unimaginable) tool. Why unimaginable? Because many of the vessels were tall vases with long, thin, elegant necks and widely fl ared interiors, often incorporating fully hollowed-out shoulders. No instrument yet invented was capable of carving vases into shapes like these, because such an instrument would have had to have been narrow enough to have passed through the necks and strong enough (and of the right shape) to have scoured out the shoulders and the rounded interiors. And how could sufficient upward and outward pressure have been gene rated and applied within the vases to achieve these effects? The tall vases were by no means th e only enigmatic vessels unearthed from the Pyramid of Zoser, and from a number of other archaic sites. There were monolithic urns with delicate ornamental handles left attached to their exteriors by the carvers. There were bowls, again with extremely narrow necks like the vases, and with widely flared, pot-bellied interiors. There were also open bowls, and almost microscopic vials, and occasional strange wheel-shaped objects cut out of metamorphic schist with inwardly curled edges planed down so fine that they were almost translucent. 21 In all cases what was really perplexing was the precision with which the interiors and exteriors of these vessels had been made to correspond—curve matching curve— over absolutely smooth, polished surfaces with no tool marks visible. There was no technology known to have been available to the Ancient Egyptians capable of achieving such re sults. Nor, for that matter, would any stone-carver today be able to match them, even if he were working with the best tungsten-carbide tools. The implication, therefore, is that an unknown or secret technology had been put to use in Ancient Egypt. Ceremony of the sarcophagus Standing in the King’s Chamber, facing west—the direction of death amongst both the Ancient Egyptians and the Maya—I rested my hands lightly on the gnarled granite edge of the sarcophagus which Egyptologists insist had been built to house the body of Khufu.

It was just a trick of light and shadow, of course, but the King’s Chamber was full of such illusions. I remembered that Napoleon Bonaparte had paused to spend a night alone here during his conquest of Egypt in the late eighteenth centur y. The next morning he had emerged pale and shaken, having experience d something which had profoundly disturbed him but about which he never afterwards spoke. 22 Had he tried to sleep in the sarcophagus? Acting on impulse, I climbed into the granite coffer and lay down, face upwards, my feet pointed towards th e south and my head to the north. Napoleon was a little guy, so he mu st have fitted comfortably. There was plenty of room for me too. But had Khufu been here as well? I relaxed and tried not to worry ab out the possibility of one of the pyramid guards coming in and find ing me in this embarrassing and probably illegal position . Hoping that I would remain undisturbed for a few minutes, I folded my hands across my chest and gave voice to a sustained low-pitched tone—something I had tried out several times before at other points in the King’s Chamber. On those occasions, in the centre of the floor, I had noticed th at the walls and ceiling seemed to collect the sound, to gather and to amplify it and project it back at me so that I could sense the returning vibrations through my feet and scalp and skin. Now in the sarcophagus I was aware of very much the same effect, although seemingly amplified and concentrated many times over. It was like being in the sound-box of some giant, resonant musical instrument designed to emit for ever just one reverberating note. The sound was intense and quite disturbing. I imagined it rising out of the coffer and bouncing off the red granite walls and ceiling of the King’s Chamber, shooting up through the northern and southern ‘ventilation’ shafts and spreading across the Giza plateau like a sonic mushroom cloud. With this ambitious vision in my mind, and with the sound of my low- pitched note echoing in my ears an d causing the sarcophagus to vibrate around me, I closed my eyes. When I opened them a few minutes later it was to behold a distressing sight: si x Japanese tourists of mixed ages and sexes had congregated around the sarcophagus—two of them standing to the east, two to the we st and one each to the north and south. They all looked ... amazed. And I wa s amazed to see them. Because of recent attacks by armed Islamic extr emists there were now almost no tourists at Giza and I had expected to have the King’s Chamber to myself. What does one do in a situation like this?  22 Reported in P. W.

The Japanese stepped back and I climbed out of the sarcophagus. Cultivating a busi nesslike manner, as though I did things like this all the time, I strolled to the point two-thirds of the way along the northern wall of the King’s Chamber where the entrance to what Egyptologists refer to as the ‘northern ventilation shaft’ is located, and began to examine it minutely. Some 8 inches wide by 9 inches high , it was, I knew, more than 200 feet in length and emerged into open ai r at the pyramid’s 103rd course of masonry. Presumably by design rather than by accident, it pointed to the circumpolar regions of the northern he avens at an angle of 32° 30’. This, in the Pyramid Age around 2500 BC , would have meant that it was directed on the upper culmination of Alpha Draconis, a prominent star in the constellation of Draco. 23 Much to my relief the Japanese ra pidly completed their tour of the King’s Chamber and left, stooping, without a backward glance. As soon as they had gone I crossed over to th e other side of the room to take a look at the southern shaft. Since I had last been here some months before, its appearance had changed horribly. Its mouth now contained a massive electrical air-conditioning unit installed by Rudolf Gantenbrink, who even now was turning his attentio ns to the neglected shafts of the Queen’s Chamber. Since Egyptologists were satisfied that the King’s Chamber shafts had been built for ventilation purposes, they saw nothing untoward in using modern technology to improve the efficiency of this task. Yet wouldn’t horizontal shafts have been more effectiv e than sloping ones if their primary purpose had been vent ilation, and easier to build? 24 It was therefore unlikely to be an accident that the southern shaft of the King’s Chamber targeted the southern heaven s at 45°. During the Pyramid Age this was the location for the meridian transit of Zeta Orionis, the lowest of the three stars of Orion’s Belt 25 —an alignment, I was to discover in due course, that would turn out to be of the utmost significance for future pyramid research.

The huge room had an endless cap acity to generate indications of mathematical game-playing.

Known as phi, the golden section was another irrational number like pi that could not be worked out arithmetically. Its value was the square root of 5 plus 1 divided by 2, equivalent to 1.61803. 27 This proved to be the ‘limiting value of the ratio between successive numbers in the Fibonacci series—the series of numbers beginning 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13—in which each term is the sum of the two previous terms.’ 28 Phi could also be obtained schematically by dividing a line A-B at a point C in such a way that the whole line A-B was longer than the first part, A-C, in the same proportion as the first part, A-C, was longer than the remainder, C-B. 29 This proportion, which had been proven particularly harmonious and agreeable to the eye, had supposedly been first discovered by the Pyth agorean Greeks, who incorporated it into the Parthenon at Athens.

Expressed in these ancient measures, the floor dimensions of the King’s Chamber (34 ft. 4” x 17 ft. 2”) work out at exactly 20 x 10 royal cubits’, while the height of the side walls to the ce iling is exactly 11.18 royal cubits. The semi-diagonal of the floor (A-B) is also exactly 11.18 royal cubits and can be ‘swung up’ to C to confirm the height of the chamber. Phi is defined mathematically as the square root of 5 + 1 + 2, i.e. 1.618. Is it a coincidence that the distance C-D (i.e. the wall height of the King’s Chamber plus half the width of its floor) equals 16.18 royal cubits, thus incorporating the essential digits of phi? To understand how it is necessary to envisage the rectangular floor of the chamber as being divided into two imaginary squares of equal size, with the side length of each square being given a value of 1. If either of these two squares were then split in half, thus forming two new rectangles, and if the diagonal of the rectangle nearest to the centreline of the King’s Chamber were swung down to the base, the point where its tip touched the base would be phi, or 1.618, in relation to the side length (i.e., 1) of the original square. 30 (An alternative way of obtaining phi, also built into the King’s Chamber’s dimens ions, is illustrated on the previous page.)

As I left the King’s Chamber, however, I could no t forget that it was located in line with the 50th course of the Great Pyramid’s masonry at a height of almost 150 feet above the ground. 31 This meant, as Flinders Petrie pointed out with some astonishment, that the builders had managed to place it ‘at the level where the vertical section of the Pyramid was halved, where the area of the horizontal section was half that of the base, where the diagonal from corner to corner was equal to the length of the base, and where the width of the face was equal to half the diagonal of the base’. 32 Confidently and efficiently fooling ar ound with more than six million tons of stone, creating galleries and chambers and shafts and corridors more or less at will, achieving near-perfect symmetry, near-perfect right angles, and near-perfect alignments to the cardinal points, the mysterious builders of the Great Pyramid had found the time to play a great many other tricks as well with the dimensions of the vast monument. Why did their minds work this way? What had they been trying to say or do? And why, so many thousands of years after it was built, did the monument still exert a magnetic influe nce upon so many people, from so many different walks of life, who came into contact with it?

Retracing the route that Santha and I had followed the night before when we had climbed the monument, I walked ea stwards along the northern face, southwards along the flank of the eastern face, clambered over mounds of rubble and ancient tombs that clustered closely in this part of the necropolis, and came out on to the sand-covered limestone bedrock of the Giza plateau, which sloped down towards the south and east. At the bottom of this long gentle slope, about half a kilometre from the south-eastern corner of the Great Pyramid, the Sphinx crouched in his rock-hewn pit. Sixty-six feet high and more than 240 feet long, with a head measuring 13 feet 8 inches wide, 1 he was, by a considerable margin, the largest single piece of scul pture in the world—and the most renowned: A shape with lion body and the head of a man A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun. 2 Approaching the monument from the north-west I crossed the ancient causeway that connected the Second Pyramid with the so-called Valley Temple of Khafre, a most unusual stru cture located just 50 feet south of the Sphinx itself on the eastern edge of the Giza necropolis. This Temple had long been believed to be far older than the time of Khafre. Indeed throughout much of the nineteenth century the consensus among scholars was that it had been built in remote prehistory, and had nothing to do with the architecture of dynastic Egypt. 3 What changed all that was the discovery, buried within the Temple precincts, of a number of inscribed statues of Khafre. Most were pretty badly smashed, but one, found upside down in a deep pit in an antechamber, was almost intact. Life-sized, and exquisitely carved out of black, jewel-ha rd diorite, it showed the Fourth Dynasty pharaoh seat ed on his throne and gazing with serene indifference towards infinity. At this point the razor-sharp reasoning of Egyptology was brought to bear, and a solution of almost awe-inspiring brilliance was worked out: statues of Khafre had been found in the Valley Temple therefore the Valley Temple had been built by Khaf re.

Throughout the history of Dynastic Egypt many pharaohs appropriated the buildings of their predecessors, sometimes deliberately striking out the cartouches of the original builders and replacing them with their own. 5 There was no good reason to assu me that Khafre would have been deterred from linking hims elf to the Valley Temple, particularly if it had not been associated in hi s mind with any previous historical ruler but with the great ‘gods’ said by the Ancient Egyptians to have brought civilization to the Nile Valley in the distant and mythical epoch they spoke of as the First Time. 6 In such a place of archaic and mysterious power, which he does not appear to have interf ered with in any other way, Khafre might have thought that the setting up of beautiful and lifelike statues of himself could bring eternal benefits. And if, among the gods, the Valley Temple had been associated with Os iris (whom it was every pharaoh’s objective to join in the afterlife), 7 Khafre’s use of statues to forge a strong symbolic link would be even more understandable. Temple of the giants After crossing the causeway, the route I had chosen to reach the Valley Temple took me through the rubble of a ‘mastaba’ field, where lesser notables of the Fourth Dynasty had been buried in subterranean tombs under bench-shaped platforms of stone ( mastaba is a modern Arabic word meaning bench, hence the name given to these tombs). I walked along the southern wall of the Temple itself, recalling that this ancient building was almost as perfectly orie nted north to south as was the Great Pyramid (with an error of just 12 arc minutes). 8 The Temple was square in plan, 147 feet along each side. It was built in to the slope of the plateau, which was higher in the west than in the east. In consequence, while its western wall stood only a little over 20 feet tall, its eastern wall exceeded 40 feet. 9 Viewed from the south, the impression was of a wedge-shaped structure, squat and powerful, resting firmly on bedrock.

For a start, there was the stark absence, both inside and out, of inscriptions and other identifying marks. In this respect, as the reader will appreciate, the Valley Temple could be compared with a few of the other anonymous and frankly undatable monuments on the Giza plateau, including the great pyramids (and also with a mysterious structure at Abydos known as the Osireion, which we consider in deta il in a later chapter) but otherwise bore no resemblance to the typical and well-known products of Ancient Egyptian art and architecture—all copiously decorated, embellished and inscribed. 10 Another important and unusual feature of the Valley Temple was that its core structure was built entirely, entirely, of gigantic limestone megaliths. The majority of these meas ured about 18 feet long x 10 feet wide x 8 feet high and some were as large as 30 feet long x 12 feet wide x 10 feet high. 11 Routinely exceeding 200 to ns in weight, each was heavier than a modern diesel locomo tive—and there were hundreds of blocks. 12 Was this in any way mysterious? Egyptologists did not seem to think so; indeed few of them had bothered to comment, except in the most superficial manner—either on the staggering size of these blocks or the mind-bending logistics of how they might have been put in place. As we have seen, monoliths of up to 70 tons, each about as heavy as 100 fam ily-sized cars, had been lifted to the level of the King’s Chamber in the Great Pyramid—again without provoking much comment from the Egyptological fraternity—so the lack of curiosity about the Valley Te mple was perhaps no surprise. Nevertheless, the block size was trul y extraordinary, seeming to belong not just to another epoch but to another ethic altogether—one that reflected incomprehensible aesthetic and structural concerns and suggested a scale of priorities utterl y different from our own. Why, for example, insist on using these cumbersome 200-ton monoliths when you could simply slice each of them up into 10 or 20 or 40 or 80 smaller and more manoeuvrable blocks? Why make things so difficult for yourself when you could achieve much the same visual effect with much less effort? And how had the builders of the Valley Temple lifted these colossal megaliths to heights of more than 40 feet?  10 In addition to the three Giza pyramids, the Mortuary Temples of Khafre and Menkaure can be compared with the Valley Temple in terms of their absence of adornment and use of megaliths weighing 200 tons or more. 11 Serpent in the Sky, p. 211; also Mystery of the Sphinx, NBC-TV, 1993. 12 For block weights see The Pyramids of Egypt, p. 215; Serpent in the Sky, p. 242; The Traveller’s Key to Ancient Egypt, p. 144; The Pyramids: An Enigma Solved, p. 51; Mystery of the Sphinx, NBC-TV, 1993."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 331 At present there are only two land-based cranes in the world that could lift weights of this magnitude. At the very frontiers of construction technology, these are both vast, in dustrialized machines, with booms reaching more than 220 feet into the air, which require on-board counterweights of 160 tons to prev ent them from tipping over. The preparation-time for a single lift is around six weeks and calls for the skills of specialized teams of up to 20 men. 13 In other words, modern builders wi th all the advantages of high-tech engineering at their disposal, can barely hoist weights of 200 tons. Was it not, therefore, somewhat surprising that the builders at Giza had hoisted such weights on an almost routine basis? Moving closer to the Temple’s looming southern wall I observed something else about the huge limestone blocks: not only were they ridiculously large but, as though to complicate still further an almost impossible task, they had been cut and fitted into multi-angled jigsaw- puzzle patterns similar to those employed in the cyclopean stone structures at Sacsayhuaman and Ma chu Picchu in Peru (see Part II). Another point I noticed was that the Temple walls appeared to have been constructed in two stages. The first stage, most of which was intact (though deeply eroded), consisted of the strong and heavy core of 200- ton limestone blocks. On to both sides of these had been grafted a façade of dressed granite which (as we shall see) was largely intact in the interior of the building but had ma inly fallen away on the outside. A closer look at some of the remainin g exterior facing blocks where they had become detached from the core revealed a curious fact. When they had been placed here in antiquity th e backs of these blocks had been cut to fit into and around the deep coves and scallops of existing weathering patterns on the limestone core.

A row of six furthe r columns, also supporting beams, ran along the north-south axis of the T; the overall effect was of massive but refined simplicity. What was this building for? According to the Egyptologists who attributed it to Khafre its purpose was obvious. It had been designed, they said, as a venue for certain of the purification and rebirth rituals required for the funeral of the pharaoh. The Ancient Egyptians themselves, however, had left no in scriptions confirming this. On the contrary, the only written evidence th at has come down to us indicated that the Valley Temple could not (originally at any rate ) have had anything to do with Khafre, for the simple reason that it was built before his reign. This written evidence is the Inventory Stela, (referred to in Chapter Thirty- five), which also indicated a much greater age for the Great Pyramid and the Sphinx. What the Inventory Stela had to say ab out the Valley Temple was that it had been standing during the reign of Khafre’s predecessor Khufu, when it had been regarded not as a recent but as a remotely ancient building. Moreover, it was clear from the context that it was not thought to have been the work of any earlier pharaoh. Instead, it was believed to have come down from the ‘First Time’ and to have been built by the ‘gods’ who had settled in the Nile Valley in that remote epoch. It was referred to quite explicitly as the ‘House of Osiris, Lord of Rostau 14 (Rostau being an archaic name for the Giza necropolis). 15 As we shall see in Part VII, Osiris was in many respects the Egyptian counterpart of Viracocha and Quetzalc oatl, the civilizing deities of the Andes and of Central America. With them he shared not only a common mission but a vast he ritage of common symbolism. It seemed appropriate, therefore, that the ‘House’ (or sanctuary, or temple) of such a wise teacher and lawgiver should ha ve been established at Giza within sight of the Great Pyramid and in th e immediate vicinity of the Great Sphinx. Vastly, remotely, fabulously ancient Following the directions given in th e Inventory Stela—which stated that the Sphinx lay ‘on th e north-west of the House of Osiris’ 16 —I made my way to the north end of the western wall that enclosed the Valley Temple’s T-shaped hall.

From the edge of the causeway I had an unimpeded view of the Sphinx immediately to my north. As long as a city block, as high as a six-storey building it was perfectly oriented due east and thus faced the rising sun on the two equinoctial days of th e year. Man-headed, lion-bodied, crouched as though ready at last to move its slow thighs after millennia of stony sleep, it had been carved in one piece out of a single ridge of limestone on a site that must have been meticulously preselected. The exceptional characteristic of this site , as well as overlooking the Valley of the Nile, was that its geological ma ke-up incorporated a knoll of hard rock jutting at least 30 feet above the general level of the limestone ridge. From this knoll the head and neck of the Sphinx had been carved, while beneath it the vast rectangle of limestone that would be shaped into the body had been isolated from the surrounding bedrock. The builders had done this by excavati ng an 18-foot wide, 25-foot deep trench all around it, creati ng a free-standing monolith. The first and lasting impression of the Sphinx, and of its enclosure, is that it is very, very old—not a mere handful of thousands of years, like the Fourth Dynasty of Egyptian pharaohs, but vastly, remotely, fabulously old. This was how the Ancient Egyptians in all periods of their history regarded the monument, which they believed guarded the ‘Splendid Place of The Beginning of all Time’ and whic h they revered as the focus of ‘a great magical power extending over the whole region’. 17 This, as we have already seen, is the general message of the Inventory Stela. More specifically, it is also the message of the ‘Sphinx Stela’ erected here in around 1400 BC by Thutmosis IV, an Eighteenth Dynasty pharaoh. Still standing between the paws of the Sphinx, this granite tablet records that prior to Thutmosis’s rule the monument had been covered up to its neck in sand. Thutmosis liberated it by clearing all the sand, and erected the stela to commemorate his work. 18 There have been no significant changes in the climate of the Giza plateau over the last 5000 years. 19 It therefore follows that throughout this entire period the Sphinx enclosure must have been as susceptible to sand encroachment as when Thutmosis cleared it—and, indeed, as it still is today. Recent history proves that the enclosure can fill up rapidly if left unattended. In 1818 Captain Caviglia had it cleared of sand for the purposes of his excavations, and in 1886, when Gaston Maspero came to re-excavate the site, he was obliged to have it cleared of sand once again. Thirty-nine years later, in 1925, the sands had returned in full force and the Sphinx was buried to its neck when the Egyptian Service des  17 A History of Egypt, 1902, volume 4, p. 80ff, ‘Stela of the Sphinx’. 18 Ibid. 19 Karl W.

What would have been the sense of creating this immense statue if its destiny were merely to be engulfed by the shifting sands of the eastern Sahara? However, since the Sahara is a young desert, and since the Giza area in particular was wet and relatively fertile 11,000-15,000 ye ars ago, is it not worth considering another scenario altogether? Is it not possible that the Sphinx enclosure was carved out during those distant green millennia when topsoil was still anchored to the surface of the platea u by the roots of grasses and shrubs and when what is now a desert of wind-blown sand more closely resembled the rolling savannahs of modern Kenya and Tanzania? Under such congenial climatic conditions, the creation of a semi- subterranean monument like the Sphinx would not have outraged common sense. The builders would have had no reason to anticipate the slow desiccation and desertification of the plateau that would ultimately follow. Yet, is it feasible to imagine that the Sphinx could have been built when Giza was still green—long, long ago? As we shall see, such ideas are anat hema to modern Egyptologists, who are nevertheless obliged to admit (to quote Dr Mark Lehner, director of the Giza Mapping Project) that ‘there is no direct way to date the Sphinx itself, because the Sphinx is carved right out of natural rock.’ 21 In the absence of more objective tests, Lehner went on to point out, archaeologists had ‘to date things by context’. And the context of the Sphinx, that is, the Giza necropolis —a well-known Fourth Dynasty site— made it obvious that the Sphinx belonged to the Fourth Dynasty as well. 22 Such reasoning was not regarded as axiomatic by Lehner’s distinguished predecessors in the nineteenth century, who were at one time convinced that the Sphinx long predated the Fourth Dynasty. Whose Sphinx is it anyway? In his Passing of Empires, published in 1900, the distinguished French Egyptologist Gaston Maspero, who made a special study of the content of the Sphinx Stela erected by Thutmosis IV, wrote: The stela of the Sphinx bears, on line 13, the cartouche of Khafre in the middle of a gap ... There, I believe, is an indication of [a renovation and clearance] of the Sphinx carried out under this prince, and consequently the more or less certain proof that the Sphinx was already covered with sand during the time of Khufu and  20 The Pyramids of Egypt, pp. 106-7. 21 Mark Lehner, 1992 AAAS Annual Meeting, Debate: How Old is the Sphinx? 22 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 336 his predecessors ... 23 The equally distinguished Auguste Mariette agreed—naturally enough since he had been the finder of the Inventory Stela (which, as we have seen, asserted matter-of-factly that the Sphinx was stan ding on the Giza plateau long before the time of Khufu). 24 Also generally concurring were Brugsch ( Egypt under the Pharaohs, London, 1891), Petrie, Sayce and many other eminent scholars of the period. 25 Travel writers such as John Ward affirmed that ‘the Great Sphinx must be numberless years older even than the Pyramids’. And as late as 1904 Wallis Budge, the respected keeper of Egyptian Antiquities at the British Museum, had no hesitation in making this unequivocal assertion: The oldest and finest human-headed lion statue is the famous ‘Sphinx’ at Giza. This marvellous object was in existence in the days of Khafre, the builder of the Second Pyramid, and was, most probably, very old even at that early period ... The Sphinx was thought to be connected in some way with foreigners or with a foreign religion which dated from predynastic times. 26 Between the beginning and the end of the twentieth century, however, Egyptologists’ views about the antiquity of the Sphinx changed dramatically. Today there is not a single orthodox Egyptologist who would even discuss, let alone consider seriously, the wild and irresponsible suggestion, once a co mmonplace, that the Sphinx might have been built thousands of years before Khafre’s reign. According to Dr Zahi Hawass, for example, director of Giza and Saqqara for the Egyptian Antiquities Organization, many such theories have been put forward but have ‘gone with the wind’ because ‘we Egyptologists have solid evidence to state that the Sphinx is dated to the time of Khafre.’ 27 Likewise, Carol Redmont, an arch aeologist at the University of California’s Berkeley campus, was in credulous when it was suggested to her that the Sphinx might be thousands of years older than Khafre: ‘There’s just no way that could be true. The people of that region would not have had the technology, the gove rning institutions or even the will to build such a structure thousands of years before Khafre’s reign.’ 28 When I first started to research this issue, I had assumed, as Hawass appeared to claim, that some incontrovertible new evidence must have been found which had settled the iden tity of the monument’s builder. This was not the case. Indeed there are only three ‘contextual’ reasons why the construction of the anon ymous, uninscribed and enigmatic  23 Gaston Maspero, The Passing of Empires, New York, 1900. 24 See Chapter Thirty-five. 25 For a general summary of these views see John Ward, Pyramids and Progress, London, 1900, pp. 38-42. 26 The Gods of the Egyptians, volume I, pp. 471-2 an d volume II, p. 361. 27 Interview in Mystery of the Sphinx, NBC-TV, 1993. 28 Cited in Serpent In The Sky, p. 230."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 337 Sphinx is now so confidently attributed to Khafre: 1 Because of the cartouche of Khafre on line 13 of the Sphinx Stela erected by Thutmosis IV: Maspero gave a perfectly reasonable explanation for the presence of this cartouche: Thutmosis had been a restorer of the Sphinx and had paid due tribute to an earlier restoration of the monument—one undertaken during the Fourth Dynasty by Khafre. This explanation, which bears the obvious implication that the Sphinx must already have been old in Khafre’s time, is rejected by modern Egyptologists. With their usual telepathic like-mindedness they now agree that Thutmosis put the cartouche on to the stela to recognize that Khafra had been the original builder (and not a mere restorer). Since there had only ever been this single cartouche—and since the texts on either side of it were missing when the stela was excavated, is it not a little premature to come to such hard-and-fast conclusions? What sort of ‘science’ is it that allows the mere presence of the cartouche of a Fourth Dynasty ph araoh (on a stele erected by an Eighteenth Dynasty pharaoh) to determine the entire identification of an otherwise anonymous monument? Besides, even that cartouche has now flaked off and cannot be examined ... 2 Because the Valley Temple next door is also attributed to Khafre: That attribution (based on statues which may well have been intrusive) is shaky to say the least. It has nevertheless received the wholehearted endorsement of the Egyptologists, who in the process decided to attribute the Sphinx to Khafre too (since the Sphinx and the Valley Temple are so obviously connected). 3 Because the face of the Sphinx is thought to resemble the intact statue of Khafre found in th e pit in the Valley Temple: This, of course, is a matter of opinion. I have never seen the slightest resemblance between the two faces. Nor for that matter had forensic artists from the New York Police Department who had recently been brought in to do an Identikit comparison between the Sphinx and the statue 29 (as we shall see in Part VII). All in all, therefore, as I stood overlooking the Sphinx in the late afternoon of 16 March 1993, I considered that the jury was still very much out on the correct attribution of this monument—either to Khafre on the one hand or to the architects of an as yet unidentified high civilization of prehistoric antiquity on the other. 30 No matter what the  29 Ibid., pp. 230-2; Mystery of the Sphinx, NBC-TV. 30 At least one orthodox Egyptologist, Selim Hassan, has admitted that the jury is still out on this issue.

During the early evening of 26 Nove mber 1922 the British archaeologist Howard Carter, together with his sponsor Lord Carnarvon, entered the tomb of a youthful pharaoh of th e Eighteenth Dynasty who had ruled Egypt from 1352-43 BC . The name of that ph araoh, which has since resounded around the world, was Tutankhamun. Two nights later, on 28 November, the tomb’s ‘Treasury’ was breached. It was filled with a huge golden sh rine and gave access to another chamber beyond. Rather unusually, this chamber, although heaped with a dazzling array of precious and beau tiful artefacts, had no door: its entrance was watched over by an extraordinarily lifelike effigy of the jackal-headed mortuary god Anubis. Wi th ears erect, the god crouched doglike, forepaws stretched out, on the lid of a gilded wooden casket perhaps four feet long, three feet high and two feet wide. The Egyptian Museum, Cairo, December 1993 Still perched astride his casket, but now locked away in a dusty glass display case, Anubis held my atte ntion for a long, quiet moment. His effigy had been carved out of stuccoed wood, entirely covered with black resin, then painstakingly inlaid with gold, alabaster, calcite, obsidian and silver—materials used to particular effect in the eyes, which glittered watchfully with an unsettling sense of fierce and focused intelligence. At the same time his finely etched ribs and lithe musculat ure gave off an aura of understated strength, energy and grace. Captured by the force field of this occult and powerful presence, I was vividly reminded of the universal myths of precession I had been studying during the past year. Canine figures moved back and forth among these myths in a manner which at times had seemed almost plotted in the literary sense. I had be gun to wonder whether the symbolism of dogs, wolves, jackals, and so on, might have been deliberately employed by the long-dead myth-makers to guide init iates through a maze of clues to secret reservoirs of lost scientific knowledge. Among these reservoirs, I suspected, was the myth of Osiris. Much more than a myth, it had been dramatized and performed each year in Ancient Egypt in the form of a mystery play—a ‘plotted’ literary artefact, passed down as a treasured tradition since prehistoric times. 1 This tradition, as we saw in Part V, contained values for the rate of  1 See, for example, Rosalie David, A Guide to Religious Ritual at Abydos, Aris and Phillips, Warminster, 1981, in particular p. 121."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 341 precessional motion that were so accurate and so consistent it was extremely difficult to attribute them to chance. Nor did it seem likely to be an accident that the jackal god had been assigned a role centre-stage in the drama, serving as the spirit gu ide of Osiris on his journey through the underworld. 2 It was tempting, too, to wonder whether there was any significance in the fact that in ancient times Anubis had been referred to by Egyptian priests as the ‘guardian of the secret and sacred writings’. 3 ) Under the grooved edge of the gilded casket on which his effigy now crouched was found an inscription: ‘initiated into the secrets’. 4 Alternative translations of the same hieroglyphic text rendered it variously as ‘he who is upon the secrets’, and as ‘guardian of the secrets’. 5 But were there any secrets left in Egypt? After more than a century of intens ive archaeological investigations, could the sands of this antique land yield any further surprises? Bauval’s Stars and West’s Stones In 1993 there was an astonishing ne w discovery which suggested that there was much still to learn about Ancient Egypt. The discoverer, moreover, was not some astigmatic archaeologist sieving his way through the dust of ages but an outsider to the field: Robert Bauval, a Belgian construction engineer with a flair for astronomy who observed a correlation in the sky that the expert s had missed in their fixation with the ground at their feet. What Bauval saw was this: as the three belt stars of the Orion constellation crossed the merdian at Gi za they lay in a not quite straight line high in the southern heavens. The lower two stars, Al Nitak and Al Nilam, formed a perfect diagonal but the third star, Mintaka, appeared to be offset to the observer’s le ft, that is, towards the east.  2 The Gods of the Egyptians, volume II, pp. 262-6. 3 Lucy Lamy, Egyptian Mysteries, Thames & Hudson, London, 1986, p. 93. 4 Jean-Pierre Corteggiani, The Egypt of the Pharaohs at the Cairo Museum, Scala Publications, London, 1987, p. 118. 5 Ibid.; see also R.

Curiously enough (as we saw in Chapter Thirty-six), this was exactly the site-plan of the three enigmatic pyra mids of the Giza plateau. Bauval realized that an aerial view of the Giza necropolis would show the Great Pyramid of Khufu occupying the position of Al Nitak, and the Second Pyramid of Khafre occupying the position of Al Nilam, while the Third Pyramid of Menkaure was offset to the east of the diagonal formed by the other two—thus completing what seemed at first to be a vast diagram of the stars. Was this indeed what the Giza py ramids represented? I knew that Bauval’s later work, which had been wholeheartedly endorsed by"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 343 mathematicians and astronomers, had borne out his insp ired hunch. His evidence (reviewed fully in Chapter Forty-nine) showed that the three pyramids were an unbelievably precis e terrestrial map of the three stars of Orion’s belt, accurately reflecting the angles between each of them and even (by means of their respective si zes) providing some indication of their individual magnitudes. 6 Moreover, this map extended outwards to the north and south to encompass seve ral other structures on the Giza plateau—once again with faultless precision. 7 However, the real surprise revealed by Bauval’s astronomical calculations was this: despite the fact that some aspects of the Great Pyrami d did relate astronomically to the Pyramid Age, the Giza monuments as a whole were so arranged as to provide a picture of the skies (which alter their appearance down the ages as a result of precession of the equinoxes) not as they had looked in the Fourth Dynasty around 2500 BC , but as they had looked—and only as they had looked—around the year 10,450 BC . 8 I had come to Egypt to go over the Gi za site with Robert Bauval and to question him about his star-correlation theory. In addition I wanted to canvass his views on what sort of hu man society, if any, could have had the technological know-how, such a very long while ago, to measure accurately the altitudes of the stars an d to devise a plan as mathematical and ambitious as that of the Giza necropolis. I had also come to meet another researcher who had challenged the orthodox chronology of Ancient Egypt with a well-founded claim to have found hard evidence of a high civili zation in the Nile Valley in 10,000 BC or earlier. Like Bauval’s astronomical data, the evidence had always been available but had failed to attract the attention of established Egyptologists. The man re sponsible for bringing it before the public now was the American scholar, John Anthony West, who argued that the specialists had missed it—not because they had failed to find it, but because they had found it and had failed to interpret it properly. 9 West’s evidence focused on certai n key structures, notably the Great Sphinx and the Valley Temple at Giza and, much farther south, the mysterious Osireion at Abydos. He argued that these desert monuments showed many scientifically unmistakab le signs of having been weathered by water, an erosive agent they could on ly have been exposed to in sufficient quantities during the damp ‘pluvial’ period that accompanied the end of the last Ice Age around the eleventh millennium BC . 10 The implication of this peculiar and extremely distinctive pattern of ‘precipitation induced’ weathering, was that the Osireion, the Sphinx, and  6 The Orion Mystery. 7 Ibid. 8 Ibid. 9 Serpent in the Sky, pp. 184-242. 10 Ibid., 186-7."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 344 other associated structures were built before 10,000 BC . 11 A British investigative journa list summed up the effect: West is really an academic’s worst nightmare, because here comes somebody way out of left-field with a thoroughly well thought out, well presented, coherently described theory, full of data they can’t refute, and it pulls the rug out from beneath their feet. So how do they deal with it? They ignore it. They hope it’ll go away ... and it won’t go away. 12 The reason the new theory would not, under any circumstances, go away, despite its rejection by droves of ‘competent Egyptologists’, was that it had won widespread support from another scientific branch of scholarship—geology. Dr Robert Sc hoch, a professor of Geology at Boston University, had played a prom inent role in validating West’s estimates concerning the true age of the Sphinx, and his views had been endorsed by almost 300 of his peer s at the 1992 annual convention of the Geological Society of America. 13 Since then, most often out of the public eye, an acrimonious dispute had begun to smoulder between the geologists and the Egyptologists. 14 And though very few people other th an John West were prepared to say as much, what was at stake in this dispute was a complete upheaval in accepted views about the evolution of human civilization. According to West: We are told that the evolution of human civilization is a linear process—that it goes from stupid cavemen to smart old us with our hydrogen bombs and striped toothpaste. But the proof that the Sphinx is many, many thousands of years older than the archaeologists think it is, that it preceded by many thousands of years even dynastic Egypt, means that there must have been, at some distant point in history, a high and sophisticated civilization—just as all the legends affirm. 15 My own travels and research during the preceding four years had opened my eyes to the electrifying possibility that those legends could be true, and this was why I had come back to Egypt to meet West and Bauval. I was struck by the way in which their hitherto disparate lines of enquiry 16 had converged so convincingly on what appeared to be the astronomical and geological fingerprints of a lost civilization, one that might or might not have originated in the Nile Va lley but that seemed to have had a presence here as far back as the eleventh millennium BC .  11 Ibid. 12 Mystery of the Sphinx, NBC-TV, 1993. 13 Conde Nast Traveller, February 1993, p. 176. 14 E.g, American Association for the Advancement of Science, Chicago, 1992, Debate: How Old is the Sphinx? 15 Mystery of the Sphinx. 16 John West and Robert Bauval worked in isolation, unaware of each other’s findings, until I introduced them."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 345 The way of the jackal Anubis, guardian of the secrets, god of the funerary chamber, jackal- headed opener of the ways of the de ad, guide and companion of Osiris ...

Down below us guards were whistling and clapping their hands as they sought to herd the last few sightseers out of the halls, but up on the second floor of the hundred-year-old building, where ancient Anubis crouched in hi s millennial watchfulness, all was quiet, all was still. We left the sombre museum and walk ed down into the sunlight still bathing Cairo’s bustling Tahrir Square. Anubis, I reflected, had shared his du ties as spirit guide and guardian of the secret writings with another god whose type and symbol had also been the jackal and whose name, Upuaut, literally meant Opener of the Ways. 17 Both these canine deities had been linked since time immemorial with the ancient town of Abydos in upper Egypt, the original god of which, Khenti-Amentiu (the st rangely named ‘Foremost of the Westerners’) had also been represented as a member of the dog family, usually lying recumbent on a black standard. 18 Was there any significance in the repeated recurrence at Abydos of all this mythical and symbolic doggishnes s, with its promise of high secrets waiting to unfold?

I had asked Mohamed to take us through Maydan al-Massallah Square, which was dominated by one of the world’s oldest intact Egyptian obelisks. 1 Weighing an estimated 350 to ns, this was a pink granite monolith, 107 feet high, erected by Pharaoh Senuseret I (1971-1928 BC ). It had originally been one of a pair at the gateway of the great Heliopolitan Temple of the Sun. In the 4000 years since then the temple itself had entirely vanished, as had the second obelisk. Indeed, almost all of ancient Heliopolis had now been obliterated, cannibalized for its handsome dressed stones and ready-made building materials by countless generations of the citizens of Cairo. 2 Heliopolis (City of the Sun) was refe rred to in the Bible as On but was originally known in the Egyptian la nguage as Innu, or Innu Mehret— meaning ‘the pillar’ or ‘the northern pillar’. 3 It was a district of immense sanctity, associated with a strange grou p of nine solar and stellar deities, and was old beyond reckoning when Senu seret chose it as the site for his obelisk. Indeed, together with Giza (and the distant southern city of Abydos) Innu/Heliopolis was believed to have been part of the first land that emerged from the primeval waters at the moment of creation, the land of the ‘First Time’, where the gods had commenced their rule on earth. 4 Heliopolitan theology rested on a creation-myth distinguished by a number of unique and curious features . It taught that in the beginning the universe had been filled with a dark, watery nothingness, called the Nun. Out of this inert co smic ocean (described as ‘shapeless, black with the blackness of the blackest night’) rose a mound of dry land on which Ra, the Sun God, materialized in his self-created form as Atum (sometimes depicted as an old bearded man leaning on a staff): 5  1 ‘Saqqara, Egypt: Archaeologists have discovered a green limestone obelisk, the world’s oldest-known complete obelisk, dedicated to Inty, a wife of Pharaoh Pepi I, Egypt’s ruler almost 4300 years ago, who was regarded as a goddess after her death.’ Times, London, 9 May 1992; see also Daily Telegraph, London, 9 May 1992. 2 Atlas of Ancient Egypt, pp. 173-4; Rosalie and Anthony E.

I made my seed to enter my hand. I poured it into my own mouth. I evacuated under the form of Shu, I passed water under the form of Tefnut.’ 7 Despite such apparently inauspicious beginnings, Shu and Tefnut (who were always described as ‘Twins’ and frequently depicted as lions) grew to maturity, copulated and produced offspring of their own: Geb the god of the earth and Nut, the goddess of the sky. These two also mated, creating Osiris and Isis, Set and Ne pthys, and so completed the Ennead, the full company of the Nine Gods of Heliopolis. Of the nine, Ra, Shu, Geb and Osiris were said to have ruled in Egypt as kings, followed by Horus, and lastly—for 3226 years—by the Ibis-headed wisdom god Thoth. 8 Who were these people—or creatures, or beings, or gods? Were they figments of the priestly imagination, or symbols, or ciphers? Were the stories told about them vivid myth memories of real events which had taken place thousands of years previous ly? Or were they, perhaps, part of a coded message from the ancients that had been transmitting itself over and over again down the epochs—a message only now beginning to be unravelled and understood?

They were also famous for their possession of a powerful and sacred object known as the Benben. 9 The Egyptians called Heliopolis Innu, th e pillar, because tradition had it that the Benben had been kept here in remote pre-dynastic times, when it had balanced on top of a pillar of rough-hewn stone.

In that period (the Twelfth Dynasty) all that was clearly recalled was that the Benben had been pyramidal in form, thus providing (together with the pillar on which it stood) a prototype for the shape of all future obelisks. The name Benben was likewise applied to the pyramidion, or apex stone, usually placed on top of pyramids. 10 In a symbolic sense, it was also associated closely and directly with Ra-Atum, of whom the ancient texts said, ‘You became high on the height; you rose up as the Benben stone in the Mansion of the Phoenix ...’ 11 Mansion of the Phoenix described th e original temple at Heliopolis where the Benben had been housed.

It was tempting to see a connection between this imagery and the Andean traditions that spoke of the emergence of the civilizer god Viracocha from the waters of Lake Titicaca after an earth- destroying flood. Moreover there was the figure of Osiris to consider—a conspicuously bearded figure, like Viracocha, and like Quetzalcoatl as well—remembered for having abolished cannibalism among the Egyptians, for having taught them agriculture and animal husbandry, and for introducing them to such arts as writing, architecture, and music. 14 The similarities between the Old and New World traditions were hard to miss but even harder to interpret.

The priests of Heliopolis, after all, had taught of the creation, but who had taught them? Had they sprung out of nowhere, or was it more likely that their doctrine, with all its complex symbolism, was the product of a long refinement of religious ideas? If so, when and where had these ideas developed? I looked up to discover that we had left Heliopolis behind and were winding our way through the noisy and crowded streets of down-town Cairo. We crossed over to the west bank of the Nile by way of the 6 October Bridge and soon afterwards entered Giza. Fifteen minutes later, passing the massive bulk of the Great Pyramid on our right, we turned south on the road to upper Egypt, a road which followed the meridional course of the world’s longest rive r through a landscape of palms and green fields fringed by the encroachin g red wastes of pitiless deserts. The ideas of the Heliopolitan priesth ood had influenced every aspect of secular and religious life in Ancient Egypt, but had those ideas developed locally, or had they been introduced to the Nile Valley from elsewhere? The traditions of the Egyptians provided an unambiguous answer to questions such as these. All the wisd om of Heliopolis was a legacy, they said, and this legacy had been pa ssed to humankind by the gods. Gift of the Gods? About ten miles south of the Great Pyramid we pulled off the main road to visit the necropolis of Saqqara.

We shall have more to say about th e step-pyramid and its builder in a later chapter, but on this occasion I had not come to Saqqara to see it. My sole objective was to spend a few moments in the burial chamber of the nearby pyramid of Unas, a Fifth Dynasty pharaoh who had reigned from 2356 to 2323 BC . 17 The walls of this chamber, which I had visited several times before, were inscribed from floor to ceiling with the most ancient of the Pyramid Texts, an extravaganza of hieroglyphic inscriptions giving voice to a range of remarkable ideas— in acute contrast to the mute and unadorned interiors of the Fourth Dynasty pyramids at Giza. A phenomenon exclusively of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties (2465-2152 BC ), the Pyramid Texts were sacred wr itings, parts of which were thought to have been composed by the Heliopo litan priesthood in the late third millennium BC , and parts of which had been received and handed down by them from pre-dynastic times. 18 It was the latter parts of these Texts, dating to a remote and impenetrable antiquity, which had particularly aroused my curiosity when I had begu n to research them a few months previously. I had also been amused—and a little intrigued—by the strange way that nineteenth century French archaeologists appeared almost to have been directed to the hidden chamber of the Pyramid Texts by a mythological ‘opener of the ways.’ According to reasonably well- documented reports, an Egyptian foreman of the excavations at Saqqara had been up and about at dawn on e morning and had found himself by the side of a ruined pyramid looking in to the bright amber eyes of a lone desert jackal: It was as if the animal were taunting his human observer ... and inviting the puzzled man to chase him.

The bemused Arab decided to follow his lead. After slipping through the narrow hole, he found himself crawling into the dark bowels of the pyramid. Soon he emerged into a chamber and, lifting his light, saw that the walls were covered from top to bottom with hieroglyphic inscriptions. These were carved with exquisite craftsmanship into the solid limestone and painted over with turquoise and gold.’ 19 Today the hieroglyph-lined chamber beneath the ruined pyramid of Unas is still reached through the north fa ce by the long descending passage the French archaeological team excavated soon after the foreman’s astonishing discovery. The chamber consists of two rectangular rooms separated by a partition wall, into wh ich is let a low doorway. Both rooms are covered by a gabled ceiling painted with myriads of stars. Emerging stooped from the cramped passage, Santha and I entered the first of the two rooms and passed through the connecting doorway into the second. This was the tomb chamber proper, with the massive black granite sarcophagus of Unas at its western end and the strange utterances of the Pyramid Texts proclaiming themselves from every wall. Speaking to us directly (rather than through riddles and mathematical legerdemain like the unadorned walls of the Great Pyramid), what were the hieroglyphs saying? I knew that the answer depended to some extent on which translation you were using, largely because the language of the Pyramid Texts contained so many archaic forms and so many unfamiliar mythological allusions that scholars we re obliged to fill in the gaps in their knowledge with guesswork. 20 Nevertheless it was generally agreed that the late R. O. Faulkner, a professor of the Ancient Egyptian Language at University College London, had produced the most authoritative version. 21 Faulkner, whose translation I had st udied line by line, described the Texts as constituting ‘the oldest corpus of Egyptian religious and funerary literature now extant’ and added, ‘they are the least corrupt of all such collections and are of fundam ental importance to the student of Egyptian religion ...’ 22 The reason why the Texts were so important (as many scholars agreed), was that they were the last completely open channel connecting the relatively short period of the past that humanity remembers to the far longer period that has been forgotten: ‘They vaguely disclose to us a vanished worl d of thought and speech, the last of the unnumbered aeons through which prehistoric man has passed, till finally he ... enters the historic age.’ 23  19 The Orion Mystery, pp. 57-8. 20 Traveller’s Key to Ancient Egypt, pp. 166; The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts, p.

But what intrigued me most about this world was the possibility that it might have been inhabited not only by primitive savages (as one would have expected in remote prehistory) but, paradoxically, by men and women whos e minds had been enlightened by a scientific understanding of the cosmos. The overall picture was equivocal: there were genuinely primitive elements locked into the Pyramid Texts alongside the loftier sequences of ideas. Nevertheless, every time I immersed myself in wh at Egyptologists call ‘these ancient spells’, I was impressed by the strange glimpses they seemed to afford of a high intelligence at work, da rting from behind layers of incomprehension, reporting on experien ces that ‘prehistoric man’ should never have had and expre ssing notions he should never have been able to formulate. In short, the effect the Texts achieved through the medium of hieroglyphs was akin to the effect the Great Pyramid achieved through the medium of architecture.

They were written in a dead language. Neve rtheless, the constant affirmation, repeated over and over again in these ancient compositions, was that of life— eternal life—which was to be achi eved through the pharaoh’s rebirth as a star in the constellation of Or ion. As the reader will recall from Chapter Nineteen, (where we compared Egyptian beliefs with those of Ancient Mexico), there were several utterances which voiced this aspiration explicitly: Oh King, you are this Great Star, the Companion of Orion, who traverses the sky with Orion ... you ascend from the east of the sky being renewed in your due season, and rejuvenated in your due time ...’ 1 Though undeniably beautiful there was nothing inherently extraordinary about these sentiments, and it was by no means impossible to attribute them to a people assessed by the French archaeologist Gaston Maspero as having ‘always remained half savage’. 2 Furthermore, since Maspero had been the first Egyptologist to enter the pyramid of Unas, 3 and was considered a great authorit y on the Texts, it was hardly surprising that his opinions should have shaped all academic responses to this literature since he began to publish transl ations from it in the 1880s. 4 Maspero (with a little help from a jackal) had brought the Pyramid Texts to the world. Thereafter, the dominance of his particular prejudices about the past had functioned as a filter on knowledge, inhibiting variant interpretations of the more opaque or puzzling utterances. This seemed to me to be unfortunate to say the least. What it meant was that, despite the technical and scientific puzzles raised by monuments like the Great Pyramid at Giza, scholars had ignored the implications of some striking passages in the Texts. These passages sounded suspiciously like attempts to express complex technical and scientific imagery in an entirely inappropriate idiom.

Take for example some of the peculiar equipment and accessories designated for the pharaoh’s use as he journeyed to his eternal resting place among the stars: The gods who are in the sky are brought to you, the gods who are on earth assemble for you, they place their hands under you, they make a ladder for you that you may ascend on it into the sky, the doors of the sky are thrown open to you, the doors of the starry firmament are thrown open for you. 5 The ascending pharaoh was identified with, and frequently referred to, as ‘an Osiris’. Osiris himself, as we ha ve seen, was frequently linked to and associated with the constellation of Orion. Osiris-Orion was said to have been the first to have climbed the great ladder the gods had made. And several utterances left no doubt that this ladder had not extended upwards from earth to heaven but downwards from heaven to earth. It was described as a rope-ladder 6 and the belief was that it had hung from an ‘iron plate’ suspended in the sky. 7 Were we dealing here, I wondered, simply with the bizarre imaginings of half-savage priests?

Iron, I knew, had been a rare metal in Ancient Egypt, particularly in the Pyramid Age when it had supposedly on ly been available in meteoritic form. 17 Yet here, in the Pyramid Texts, there seemed to be an embarrassment of iron riches: iron plates in the sky, iron thrones, and elsewhere an iron sceptre (Utterance 665C) and even iron bones for the King (Utterances 325, 684 and 723). 18 In the Ancient Egyptian language the name for iron had been bja, a word that meant literally ‘metal of heaven’ or ‘divine metal’. 19 The knowledge of iron was thus regarded as yet another gift from the gods ...

These metaphors stood out from the surrounding material because they were expressed in what had become a clear and familiar terminology to me: that of the archaic scientific language identified by Santillana and von Dechend in Hamlet’s Mill . 21 The reader may recall that a cosmic ‘diagram’ of the four props of the sky was one of the standard though t tools employed in that ancient language. Its purpose was to assist visualisation of the four imaginary bands conceived as framing, support ing and defining a precessional world age. These were what astronomers call the ‘equinoctial and solstitial colures’ and were seen as hooping down from the celestial north pole and marking the four constellations against the background of which, for periods of 2160 years at a time, the sun would consistently rise on the spring and autumn equi noxes and on the winter and summer solstices. 22 The Pyramid Texts appear to contain several versions of this diagram. Moreover, as is so often the case wi th prehistoric myths which transmit hard astronomical data, the precessional symbolism is interwoven tightly with violent images of terrestrial destruction—as though to suggest that the ‘breaking of the mill of heaven’, that is the transition every 2160 years from one zodiacal age to another, could under ill-omened circumstances bring catastrophic influe nces to bear on terrestrial events. Thus it was said that Ra-Atum, the god who created himself, was originally king over gods and men together but mankind schemed against his sovereignty, for he began to grow old, his bones became silver, his flesh gold and his hair [as] lapis lazuli. 23 When he realized what was happening, the ageing Sun God (so reminiscent of Tonatiuh, the bloodthirsty Fifth Sun of the Aztecs) determined that he would punish this insurrection by killing off most of the human race. The instrument of the havoc he unleashed was symbolized at times as a raging lioness wading in blood and at times as the fearsome lion-headed goddess Sekhmet who ‘poured fire out of herself and savaged mankind in an ecstasy of slaughter. 24 The terrible destruction continued un abated for a long period. Then at last Ra intervened to save the lives of a ‘remnant’, the ancestors of present humanity. This intervention took the form of a flood which the      288-9, Utt. 675.)

When she awoke, she was no longer interested in pursuing the destruction, and peace descended upon the devastated world. 25 Meanwhile Ra had resolved to ‘draw away’ from what was left of his creation: ‘As I live my heart is weary of staying with Mankind. I have gone on killing them [almost] to the very last one, so the [insignificant] remnant is not my affair ...’ 26 The Sun God then rose into the sky on the back of the sky-goddess Nut who (for the purposes of the prec essional metaphor about to be delivered) had transformed herself in to a cow. Before very long—in a close analogy to the ‘shaft-tree’ that ‘shivered’ on Amlodhi’s wildly gyrating mill—the cow gr ew ‘dizzy and began to shake and to tremble because she was so high above the earth.’ 27 When she complained to Ra about this precarious state of affairs he commanded, ‘Let my son Shu be put beneath Nut to keep guard for me over the heavenly supports—which exist in the twilight. Put her above your head and keep her there.’ 28 As soon as Shu had taken his place bene ath the cow and had stabilized her body, ‘the heavens above and the eart h beneath came into being’. At the same moment, ‘the four legs of the cow’, as Egyptologist Wallis Budge commented in his classic study The Gods of the Egyptians, ‘became the four props of heaven at the four cardinal points’. 29 Like most scholars, Budge understandably assumed that the ‘cardinal points’ referred to in this Ancient Egyptian tradition had strictly terrestrial connotations and that ‘heaven’ represented nothing more than the sky above our heads. He took it for granted that the point of the metaphor was for us to envisage the cow’s four le gs as positioned at the four points of the compass—north, south, east and west. He also thought—and even today few Egyptologists would disagree with him—that the simple- minded priests of He liopolis had actually believed that the sky had four corners which were supported on four legs and that Shu, ‘the skybearer par excellence’, had stood immobile like a pillar at the centre of the whole edifice. 30 Reinterpreted in the light of Santil lana’s and von Dechend’s findings, however, Shu and the four legs of th e celestial cow look much more like the components of an archaic scientific symbol depicting the frame of a precessional world age—the polar axis (Shu) and the colures (the four legs or ‘props’ marking the equinoctia l and solstitial cardinal points in the annual roun d of the sun).

With a cow involved it could have be en the Age of Taurus, although the Egyptians knew the difference between bulls and cows as well as anyone. But a much more likely contender—at any rate on purely symbolic grounds—is the age of Leo, fr om approximately 10,970 to 8810 BC . 31 The reason is that Sekhmet, the agent of the destruction of Mankind referred to in the myth, was leonine in form. What better way to symbolize the troubled birth of the new world age of Leo than to depict its harbinger as a rampaging lion, particularly since the Age of Leo coincided with the final ferocious meltdown of the last Ice Age, during which huge numbers of animal species all over the earth were suddenly and violently rendered extinct.’ 32 Mankind survived the immens e floods and earthquakes and rapid changes of climate that took place, but very probably in much reduced numbers and much reduced circumstances. The train of the Sun and the dweller in Sirius Of course the ability to recognize and define precessional world ages in myth implies that the Ancient Egyptians possessed better observational astronomy and a more sophisticated understanding of the mechanics of the solar system than any ancient people have hitherto been credited with. 33 There is no doubt that knowledge of this calibre, if it existed at all, would have been highly regarded by the Ancient Egyptians, who would have transmitted it from generation to generation in a secretive manner. Indeed, it would have ranked among the highest arcana entrusted to the keeping of the priestly elite at Helio polis and would have been passed on, in the main, through an oral and initiatory tradition. 34 If, by chance it had found its way into the Pyramid Texts, is it not likely that its form would have been veiled by metaphors and allegories? I walked slowly across the dusty floor of the tomb chamber of Unas, noting the heavy stillness in the air, casting my eyes over the faded blue and gold inscriptions. Expressed in coded language several millennia before Copernicus and Galileo, some of the passages inscribed on these walls seemed to offer clues to the true heliocentric nature of the solar system.  31 Skyglobe 3.6. 32 See Part IV. 33 For a detailed discussion see Sacred Science: The King of Pharaonic Theocracy. 34 The issue of priestly secrecy and the oral tradition is discussed at length in From Fetish to God in Ancient Egypt, e.g. p. 43: ‘It is impossible to think that the highest order of the priests did not possess esoteric knowledge which they guarded with the greatest care. Each priesthood ... possessed a “Gnosis”, a “superiority of knowledge”, which they never put into writing ...

They must have known that the earth and the planets revolved around the sun rather than vice versa. 37 The problem this raises is th at neither the Ancient Egyptians at any stage in their history, nor ev en their successors the Greeks, or for that matter the Europeans until the Renaissance, are supposed to have possessed cosmological data of anythi ng approaching this quality. How, therefore, can its presence be explained in compositions which date back to the dawn of Egyptian civilization? Another (and perhaps related) mystery concerns the star Sirius, which the Egyptians identified with Isis, the sister and consort of Osiris and the mother of Horus. In a passage addressed to Osiris himself, the Pyramid Texts state: Thy sister Isis cometh unto thee rejoicing in her love for thee. Thou settest her upon thee, thy issue entereth into her, and she becometh great with child like the star Sept [Sirius, the Dog Star]. Horus-Se pt cometh forth from thee in the form of Horus, dweller in Sept. 38 Many interpretations of this passag e are, of course, possible. What intrigued me, however, was the clear implication that Sirius was to be regarded as a dual entity in some way comparable to a woman ‘great with child’. Moreover, after the birth (or co ming forth) of that child, the text makes a special point of reminding us that Horus remained a ‘dweller in Sept’, presumably suggesting that he stayed close to his mother. Sirius is an unusual star. A spar kling point of light particularly prominent in the winter months in the night skies of the northern hemisphere, it consists of a binary star system, i.e. it is in fact, as the Pyramid Texts suggest, a ‘dual entity’. The major component, Sirius-A, is what we see. Sirius-B, on the other hand—the dwarf-star which revolves around Sirius A—is absolutely invisibl e to the naked eye. Its existence did not become known to Western scienc e until 1862, when US astronomer Alvin Clark spotted it through one of the largest and most advanced telescopes of the day. 39 How could the scribes who wrote the Pyramid  35 Pyramid Texts cited in The Gods of the Egyptians, volume I, p. 158. 36 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection, volume I, p. 146. 37 Sacred Science, pp. 22-5, 29. 38 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection, volume I, p. 93. 39 Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1991, 10:845."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 361 Texts possibly have obtained the inform ation that Sirius was two stars in one? In The Sirius Mystery, an important book published in 1976, I knew that the American author Robert Temple had offered some extraordinary answers to this question. 40 His study focused on the traditional beliefs of the Dogon tribe of West Africa—beliefs in which the binary character of Sirius was explicitly described and in which the correct figure of fifty years was given for the period of the orbit of Sirius-B around Sirius-A. 41 Temple argued cogently that this hi gh quality technical information had been passed down to the Dogon from the Ancient Egyptians through a process of cultural diffusion, and that it was to the Ancient Egyptians that we should look for an answer to th e Sirius mystery. He also concluded that the Ancient Egyptians must have received the information from intelligent beings from the region of Sirius’. 42 Like Temple, I had begun to suspect that the more advanced and sophisticated elements of Egyptian science made sense only if they were understood as parts of an inherita nce. Unlike Temple, I saw no urgent reason to attribute that inheritance to extra-terrestrials. To my mind the anomalous star knowledge the Heli opolitan priests had apparently possessed was more plausibly explained as the legacy of a lost human civilization which, against the current of history, ha d achieved a high level of technological advancement in remote antiquity. It seemed to me that the building of an instrument capable of detecting Sirius-B might not have been beyond the ingenuity of the unknown explorers and scientists who originated the remarkable maps of th e prehistoric world discussed in Part I. Nor would it have daunted the unknown astronomers and measurers of time who bequeathed to the Ancient Maya a calendar of amazing complexity, a data-base about the movements of the heavenly bodies which could only have been the product of thousands of years of accurately recorded observations, and a facility with very large numbers that seemed more appropriate to the needs of a complex technological society than to those of a ‘primitive’ Central American kingdom. 43 Millions of years and th e movements of the stars Very large numbers also appeared in the Pyramid Texts, in the symbolic ‘boat of millions of years’, for exampl e, in which the Sun God was said to navigate the dark and airless wastes of interstellar space. 44 Thoth, the god of wisdom (‘he who reckons in heaven, the counter of the stars, the  40 The Sirius Mystery. 41 Ibid., p. 3. 42 Ibid., p. 1. 43 See Part III. 44 The Egyptian Book of the Dead, p. cxi."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 362 measurer of the earth’) was specifically empowered to grant a life of millions of years to the deceased pharaoh. 45 Osiris, ‘king of eternity, lord of everlasting’, was described as trav ersing millions of years in his life.’ 46 And figures like ‘tens of millions of years’ (as well as the more mind- boggling ‘one million of millions of years’) 47 occurred often enough to suggest that some elements at least of Ancient Egyptian culture must have evolved for the convenience of scientifically minded people with more than passing insight into the immensity of time. Such a people would, of course, ha ve required an excellent calendar— one that would have faci litated complex and accurate calculations. It was therefore not surprising to learn that the Ancient Egyptians, like the Maya, had possessed such a calendar and that their understanding of its workings seemed to have declined, rather than improved, as the ages went by. 48 It was tempting to see this as the gradual erosion of a corpus of knowledge inherited an extremely long time ago, an impression supported by the Ancient Egyptians themselves, who made no secret of their belief that their calendar was a legacy which they had received ‘from the gods’. We consider the possible identity of these gods in more detail in the following chapters. Whoever they were, they must have spent a great deal of their time observing the stars, and they had accumulated a fund of advanced and specialized knowledge concerning the star Sirius in particular. Further evidence for this ca me in the form of the most useful calendrical gift which the gods suppo sedly gave to the Egyptians: the Sothic (or Sirian) cycle. 49 The Sothic cycle was based on what is referred to in technical jargon as ‘the periodic return of the heliacal rising of Sirius’, which is the first appearance of this star after a seasonal absence, rising at dawn just ahead of the sun in the eastern portion of the sky. 50 In the case of Sirius the interval between one such rising and the next amounts to exactly 365.25 days—a mathematically harm onious figure, uncomplicated by further decimal points, which is just twelve minutes longer than the duration of the solar year. 51 The curious thing about Sirius is that out of an estimated 2000 stars in the heavens visible to the naked eye it is the only one to rise heliacally at this precise and nicely rounded inte rval of 365 and a quarter days—a unique product of its ‘proper motion’ (the speed of its own movement through space) combined with the effects of precession of the  45 Ibid., p. cxviii.

The great enigma, th erefore, is this: in such an early period, who could have possessed th e necessary know-how to observe and take note of the coincidence of the period of 365.25 days with the heliacal rising of Sirius—a coincidence described by the French mathematician R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz as ‘an entirely exceptional celestial phenomenon’? 57 We cannot but admire the greatness of a science capable of discovering such a coincidence. The double star of Sirius was chosen because it was the only star that moves the needed distance and in the right direction against the background of the other stars. This fact, known four thousand years before our time and forgotten until our day, obviously de mands an extraordinary and prolonged observation of the sky. 58 It was such a legacy—built out of lo ng centuries of precise observational astronomy and scientific record-kee ping—that Egypt seems to have I benefited from at the beginning of the historical period and that was expressed in the Pyramid Texts. In this, too, there lies a mystery ... Copies, or translations?

The exact meanings of a large number of words found in them are unknown ... The co nstruction of the sentence often baffles all attempts to translate it, and when it contains wholly unknown words it becomes an unsolved riddle. It is only reasonable to suppose that these texts were often used for funerary purposes, but it is quite clear that their period of use in Egypt was little more than one hundred years. Why they were suddenly brought into use at the end of the Fifth Dynasty and ceased to be used at the end of the Sixth Dynasty is inexplicable.’ 60 Could the answer be that they were copies of an earlier literature which Unas, the last pharaoh of the Fifth Dy nasty, together with several of his successors in the Sixth Dynasty, had at tempted to fix for ever in stone in the tomb chambers of their own pyramids? Budge thought so, and felt the evidence suggested that some at le ast of the source documents must have been exceedingly old: Several passages bear evidence that the scribes who drafted the copies from which the cutters of the inscriptions worked did not understand what they were writing ... The general impression is that the prie sts who drafted the copies made extracts from several compositions of different ages and having di fferent contents ...’ 61 All this assumed that the source documents, whatever they were, must have been written in an archaic form of the An cient Egyptian language. There was, however, an alternativ e possibility which Budge failed to consider. Suppose that the task of the priests had been not only to copy material but to translate into hieroglyphs texts originally composed in another language altogether? If that language had included a technical terminology and references to artefact s and ideas for which no equivalent terms existed in Ancient Egyptian, th is would provide an explanation for the strange impression given by certain of the utterances. Moreover, if the copying and translating of the or iginal source documents had been completed by the end of the Sixth Dyna sty, it was easy to understand why no more ‘Pyramid Texts’ had ever been carved: the project would have come to a halt when it had fulfilled its objective—which would have been to create a permanent hieroglyphic record of a sacred literature that had already been tottering with age when Unas had taken the throne of Egypt in 2356 BC .

Because we wanted to cover as much of the distance to Abydos as was possible before nightfall, Santha and I reluctantly decided that it was time to get back on the road. Although we had originally intended to spend only a few minutes, the sombre gloom and ancient voices of the Unas tomb chamber had lulled our senses and almost two hours had passed since our arrival.

As we did so, I took the opportunity to look over the pyramid itself, which had fallen into such a crumbling and thoroughly dilapidated state that its original form was barely recognizable. The core masonry, reduced to little more than a nondescript heap of rubble, was eviden tly of poor quality, and even the facing blocks—some of which were still intact—lacked the finesse and careful workmanship demonstrated by the older pyramids at Giza. This was hard to explain in conventional historical terms. If the normal evolutionary processes that govern th e development of architectural skills and ideas had been at work in Egypt, one would have expected to find the opposite to be true: the design, engineering and masonry of the Unas Pyramid should have been superior to these of the Giza group, which, according to orthodox chronology, had been built about two centuries previously. 62 The uncomfortable fact that this was not the case (i.e., Giza was ‘better’ than Unas and not vice versa) create d knotty challenges for Egyptologists and raised questions to which no satisfactory answers had been supplied. To reiterate the central problem: everything about the three stunning and superb pyramids of Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure proclaimed that they were the end products of hundreds, perhaps even thousands of years of accumulated architectural and engi neering experience. This was not supported by the archaeological evidence which left no doubt that they were among the earliest pyramids ever built in Egypt—in other words, they were not the products of the mature phase of that country’s pyramid-building experiment but, anom alously, were the creations of its infancy. A further mystery also cried out fo r a solution. In the three great pyramids at Giza, Egypt’s Fourth Dy nasty had reared up mansions of eternity—unprecedented and unsurpassed masterpieces of stone, hundreds of feet high, weighing millions of tons apiece, which incorporated many extremely advanced features. No pyramids of comparable quality were ever built again. But only a little later, beneath the smaller, shabbier superstructures of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasty pyramids, a sort of Hall of Records seemed to have been deliberately created: a permanent exhibition of copies or translations of archaic documents which was, at the same time, an unprecedented and unsurpassed masterpiece of sc ribal and hieroglyphic art. In short, like the pyramids at Giza, it seemed that the Pyramid Texts had burst upon the scene with no apparent antecedents, and had occupied centre-stage for approximately a hundred years before ‘ceasing operations’, never to be bettered. Presumably the ancient kings and sages who had arranged these things had known what they were doing?

I suspected, too, that at least part of the answer to the problem might lie in the pyramid-field of Dahshur, which we passed fi fteen minutes after leaving Saqqara. It was here that the so-called ‘Bent’ and ‘Red’ Pyramids were located.

As we continued our journey south, through the bright colours of that December day, I was overtaken by a compelling sense that the Nile Valley had been the scene of momentous ev ents for humanity long before the recorded history of mankind began.

Some of these Neteru were male and some female but all posses sed a range of supernatural powers which included the ability to appear, at will, as men or women, or as animals, birds, reptiles, trees or plants. Paradoxically, their words and deeds seem to have reflected hum an passions and preoccupations. Likewise, although they were portrayed as stronger and more intelligent than humans, it was believed that they could grow sick—or even die, or be killed—under certain circumstances. 4 Records of prehistory Archaeologists are adamant that the epoch of the gods, which the Ancient Egyptians, called the First Ti me, is nothing more than a myth. The Ancient Egyptians, however, wh o may have been better informed about their past than we are, did not share this view. The historical records they kept in their most venerable temples included comprehensive lists of all the kings of Egypt: lists naming every pharaoh of every dynasty recognized by scholars today. 5 Some of these lists went even further, reaching back beyond the historical horizon of the First Dynasty into the uncharted depths of a remote and profound antiquity.

We shall consider these lis ts in more detail later in this chapter. They are known respectively as the Palermo Stone (dating from the Fifth Dynasty—around the twenty-fifth century BC ), and the Turin Papyrus, a nineteenth Dynasty temple document inscribed in a cursive form of hieroglyphs known as hieratic and dated to the thirteenth century BC . 6 In addition, we have the testimon y of a Heliopolitan priest named Manetho. In the third century BC he compiled a comprehensive and widely respected history of Egypt which prov ided extensive king lists for the entire dynastic period. Like the Tu rin Papyrus and the Palermo Stone, Manetho’s history also reached much further back into the past to speak of a distant epoch when gods had ruled in the Nile Valley. Manetho’s complete text has not come down to us, although copies of it seem to have been in circulat ion as late as the ninth century AD . 7 Fortuitously, however, fragments of it were preserved in the writings of the Jewish chronicler Josephus ( AD 60) and of Christian writers such as Africanus ( AD 300), Eusebius ( AD 340) and George Syncellus ( AD 800). 8 These fragments, in the words of th e late Professor Michael Hoffman of the University of South Carolina, provide the ‘framework for modern approaches to the study of Egypt’s past’. 9 This is quite true. 10 Nevertheless, Egyptologi sts are prepar ed to use Manetho only as a source for the historical (dynastic) period and repudiate the strange insights he provides into prehistory when he speaks of the remote golden age of the First Time. Why should we be so selective in our reliance on Manetho? What is the logic of accepting thirty ‘historical’ dynasties from him and re jecting all that he has to say about earlier epochs? Moreover, since we know that his chronology for the historical period has been vindicated by archaeology, 11 isn’t it a bit premature for us to assume that hi s pre-dynastic chronology is wrong because excavations have not yet tu rned up evidence confirming it? 12  6 Egypt before the Pharaohs, pp. 12-13; The Encyclopaedia of Ancient Egypt, pp. 200, 268. 7 Egypt before the Pharaohs, p. 12. 8 Archaic Egypt, p. 23; Manetho, (trans.

Besides, vast numbers of Ancient Egyptian sites have not been investig ated at all, and many more may lie out of our reach beneath the millennial silt of the Nile Delta (or beneath the suburbs of Cairo for that matter), and even at well-studied locations such as the Giza necropolis there are huge areas—the bedrock beneath the Sphinx for example—which still await the attentions of the excavator."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 369 Gods, Demigods and Spirits of the Dead If we are to allow Manetho to speak fo r himself, we have no choice but to turn to the texts in which the fragment s of his work are preserved. One of the most important of these is the Armenian version of the Chronica of Eusebius. It begins by informing us that it is extracted ‘from the Egyptian History of Manetho, who composed his account in three books. These deal with the Gods, the Demigods, the Spirits of the Dead and the mortal kings who ruled Egypt ...’ 13 Citing Manetho directly , Eusebius begins by reeling off a list of the gods which co nsists, essentially, of the familiar Ennead of Heliopolis—Ra, Osiris, Isis, Horus, Set, and so on: 14 These were the first to hold sway in Egypt. Thereafter, the kingship passed from one to another in unbroken succession ... through 13,900 years— ... After the Gods, Demigods reigned for 1255 years; and again another line of kings held sway for 1817 years; then came thirty more kings, reigning for 1790 years; and then again ten kings ruling for 350 years. There followed the rule of the Spirits of the Dead ... for 5813 years ...’ 15 The total of all these periods adds up to 24,925 years and takes us far beyond the biblical date for the creation of the world (some time in the fifth millennium BC 16 ). Because it suggested that biblical chronology was wrong, this created difficulties fo r Eusebius, a staunchly Christian commentator. But, after a moment’s thought, he overcame the problem in an inspired way: ‘The year I take to be a lunar one, consisting, that is, of 30 days: what we now call a mont h the Egyptians used formerly to style a year ...’ 17 Of course they did no such thing. 18 By means of this sleight of hand, however, Eusebius and others succeeded in boiling down Manetho’s grand pre-dynastic span of almost 25 ,000 years into a sanitized dollop a bit over 2000 years which fits comf ortably into the 2242 years orthodox biblical chronology allows between Adam and the Flood. 19 A different technique for downplaying the disturbing chronological implications of Manetho’s evidence is employed by the monk George Syncellus ( c. AD 800). This commentator, who relies entirely on invective, writes, ‘Manetho, chief priest of the accursed temples of Egypt [tells us] of gods who never existed. These, he says, reigned for 11,895 years ...’ 20 Several other curious and contradi ctory numbers crop up in the fragments.

More likely by design than by accident, it also represents 25 cycles of 1460 Sothic years, and 25 cycles of 1461 calendar years (since the ancient Egyptian civil calendar was constructed around a ‘v ague year’ of 365 days exactly). 22 What, if anything, does all this mean ? It’s hard to be sure. Out of the welter of numbers and interpretations, however, there is one aspect of Manetho’s original message that comes through loud and clear. Irrespective of everything we have been taught about the orderly progress of history, what he seems to be telling us is that civilized beings (either gods or men) were present in Egypt for an immensely long period before the advent of the First Dynasty around 3100 BC . Diodorus Siculus and Herodotus In this assertion, Mane tho finds much support among classical writers. In the first century BC , for example, the Gree k historian Diodorus Siculus visited Egypt. He is rightly de scribed by C.H. Ol dfather, his most recent translator, as ‘an uncritical compiler who used good sources and reproduced them faithfully’. 23 In plain English, what this means is that Diodorus did not try to impose his pr ejudices and preconceptions on the material he collected. He is therefore particularly valuable to us because his informants included Egyptian priests whom he questioned about the mysterious past of their country. This is what they told him: ‘At first gods and heroes ruled Egypt for a little less than 18,000 years, the last of the gods to rule being Horus, the son of Isis ... Mortals have been kings of their country, they say, for a little less than 5000 years ... 24 Let us review these figures ‘uncritically’ and see what they add up to. Diodorus was writing in the first century BC . If we journey back from there for the 5000 years during which the ‘m ortal kings’ supposedly ruled, we get to around 5100 BC . If we go even further back to the beginning of the age of ‘gods and heroes’, we find that we have arrived at 23,100 BC , when the world was still firmly in the grip of the last Ice Age.  21 Ibid., p. 231; see also The Splendour that was Egypt, p. 12. 22 Like the Maya, (see Part III), the Ancient Egyptians made use for administrative purposes of a civil calendar year (or vague year) of 365 days exactly. See Skywatchers of Ancient Mexico, p. 151, for further details on the Ma ya vague year. The Ancient Egyptian civil calendar year was geared to the Sothic year so that both would coincide on the same day/month position once every 1461 calendar years. 23 Diodorus Siculus, translated by C.H.

He too, it seems, consorted with priests and he too managed to tune in to traditions that spoke of the presence of a high civilization in the Nile Valley at some unspecified date in remote antiquity. Herodotus outlines these traditions of an immense prehistoric period of Egyptian civilization in Book II of his History. In the same document he also hands on to us, without comment, a peculi ar nugget of information which had originated with the priests of Heliopolis: During this time, they said, there were four occasions when the sun rose out of his wonted place—twice rising where he now sets, and twice setting where he now rises. 25 What is this all about? According to the French mathematician Schwaller de Lubicz, what Herodotus is transmitting to us (p erhaps unwittingly) is a veiled and garbled reference to a period of time— that is, to the time that it takes for sunrise on the vernal equinox to precess against the stellar background through one and a half complete cycles of the zodiac. 26 As we have seen, the equinoctial sun spends roughly 2160 years in each of the twelve zodiacal constellations. A full cycle of precession of the equinoxes therefore takes almost 26,000 years to complete (12 x 2160 years). It follows that one and a half cycles takes nearly 39,000 years (18 x 2160 years). In the time of Herodotus the sun on the vernal equinox rose due east at dawn against the stellar background of Aries—at which moment the constellation of Libra was ‘in opposi tion’, lying due we st where the sun would set twelve hours later. If we wind the clock of precession back half a cycle, however—six houses of the zodiac or approximately 13,000 years—we find that the reverse config uration prevails: the vernal sun now rises due east in Libra while Aries lie s due west in opposition. A further 13,000 years back, the situation reverses itself once more, with the vernal sun rising again in Aries an d with Libra in opposition. This takes us to 26,000 years before Herodotus. If we then step back another 13,0 00 years, another half precessional cycle, to 39,000 years before Herodo tus, the vernal sunrise returns to Libra, and Aries is again in opposition. The point is this: with 39,000 years we have an expans e of time during which the sun can be descri bed as ‘twice rising where he now sets’, i.e. in  25 The History, pp. 193-4. In the first century AD a similar tradition was recorded by the Roman scholar Pomponious Mela: ‘The Egypti ans pride themselves on being the most ancient people in the world. In their authentic annals one may read that since they have been in existence, the course of the stars has changed direction four times, and that the sun has set twice in the part of the sky where it rises today.’ (Pomponious Mela, De Situ Orbis .) 26 Sacred Science, p. 87"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 372 Libra in the time of Herodotus (and again at 13,000 and at 39,000 years earlier), and as ‘twice setting where he now rises’, i.e. in Aries in the time of Herodotus (and again at 13,000 and 39,000 years earlier). 27 If Schwaller’s interpretation is correct—and there is every reason to suppose it is—it suggests that the Gr eek historian’s priestly informants must have had access to accurate reco rds of the precessional motion of the sun going back at least 39,000 years before their own era. The Turin Papyrus an d the Palermo Stone The figure of 39,000 years accord s surprisingly closely with the testimony of the Turin Papyrus (one of the two surviving Ancient Egyptian king lists that extends back into prehistoric times before the First Dynasty). Originally in the collection of the king of Sardinia, the brittle and crumbling 3000-year-old papyrus was sent in a box, without packing, to its present home in the Museum of Tu rin. As any schoolchild could have predicted, it arrived broken into countless fragments. Scholars were obliged to work for years to piece together and make sense of what remained, and they did a superb job. 28 Nevertheless, more than half the contents of this precious record proved impossible to reconstruct. 29 What might we have learned about the First Time if the Turin Papyrus had remained intact? The surviving fragments are tantalizin g. In one register, for example, we read the names often Neteru with each name inscribed in a cartouche (oblong enclosure) in much the same style adopted in later periods for the historical kings of Egypt. The number of years that each Neter was believed to have reigned was also given, but most of these numbers are missing from the damaged document. 30 In another column there appears a list of the mortal kings who ruled in upper and lower Egypt after the gods but prior to the supposed unification of the kingdom under Mene s, the first pharaoh of the First Dynasty, in 3100 BC .

The final two lines of the column, which seem to represent a summing up or inventory, are particularly provocative. They read ; ‘... Venerables Shemsu-Hor, 13,420 years; Reigns before the Shemsu-Hor, 23,200 years; Total 36,620 years’. 31 The other king list that deals with prehistoric times is the Palermo Stone, which does not take us as fa r back into the past as the Turin Papyrus. The earliest of its survivin g registers record the reigns of 120 kings who ruled in upper and lower Egypt in the late pre-dynastic period: the centuries immediately prior to the country’s unification in 3100 BC . 32 Once again, however, we rea lly have no idea how much other information, perhaps relating to far earlier peri ods, might originally have been inscribed on this enigmatic slab of black basalt, because it, too, has not come down to us intact.

In addition, other companies of gods were recognized, notably at Memphi s and Hermopolis, where there were important and very ancient cults dedicated to Ptah and to Thoth. 1 These First Time deities were all in one se nse or another gods of creation who had given shape to chaos through their divine will.

The Heliopolitan priests who spoke to the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus in the first century BC put forward the thought-provoking suggestion that ‘chaos’ was a flood—i dentified by Diodorus with the earth-destroying flood of Deuc alion, the Greek Noah figure: 4 In general, they say that if in the flood which occurred in the time of Deucalion most living things were destroyed, it is probable that the inhabitants of southern Egypt survived rather than any others ... Or if, as some maintain, the destruction of living things was complete and the eart h then brought forth again new forms of animals, nevertheless, even on such a supposition, the first genesis of living things fittingly attaches to this country ... 5 Why should Egypt have been so blessed? Diodorus was told that it had something to do with its geographical situation, with the great exposure of its southern regions to the heat of the sun, and with the vastly increased rainfall which the myths said the world had experienced in the aftermath of the universal deluge: ‘For when the moisture from the abundant rains which fell among other peoples was mingled with the intense heat which prevails in Egyp t itself ... the air became very well tempered for the first generation of all living things ...’ 6 Curiously enough, Egypt does enjoy a special geographical situation: as  1 Kingship and the Gods, pp. 181-2; The Encyclopaedia of Ancient Egypt, pp. 209, 264; Egyptian Myths, pp. 18-22.

The question therefore has to be asked: whose information about the past are we receiving from Diodorus , and is the apparently accurate description of Egypt’s lush climate at the end of the last Ice Age a coincidence, or is an extremely anci ent tradition being transmitted to us here—a memory, perhaps, of the First Time? Breath of the divine serpent Ra was believed to have been the firs t king of the First Time and ancient myths say that as long as he remained young and vigorous he reigned peacefully. The passing years took thei r toll on him, however, and he is depicted at the end of his rule as an old, wrinkled, stumbling man with a trembling mouth from which saliva ceaselessly dribbles. 9 Shu followed Ra as king on earth, but his reign was troubled by plots and conflicts. Although he vanquished his enemies he was in the end so ravaged by disease that even his most faithful followers revolted against him: ‘Weary of reigning, Shu abdicate d in favour of hi s son Geb and took refuge in the skies after a terrifying tempest which lasted nine days ...’ 10 Geb, the third divine pharaoh, duly succeeded Shu to the throne. His reign was also troubled and some of the myths describing what took place reflect the odd idiom of the Py ramid Texts in which a non-technical vocabulary seems to wrestle with complex technical and scientific imagery. For example, one particularly striking tradition speaks of a ‘golden box’ in which Ra had deposited a number of objects—described, respectively, as his ‘rod’ (or cane ), a lock of his hair, and his uraeus (a rearing cobra with its hood extended , fashioned out of gold, which was worn on the royal head-dress). 11 A powerful and dangerous talisman, this box, together with its bizarre  7 Mystic Places, Time-Life Books, 1987, p. 62. 8 Early Hydraulic Civilization in Egypt, p. 13; Egypt before the Pharaohs, pp. 27, 261. 9 New Larousse Encyclopaedia of Mythology, p. 11. 10 Ibid., p. 13. 11 Ibid., pp. 14-15."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 377 contents, remained enclosed in a fortress on the ‘eastern frontier’ of Egypt until a great many years after Ra’s ascent to heaven. When Geb came to power he ordered that it should be brought to him and unsealed in his presence. In the instant that the box was opened a bolt of fire (described as the ‘breath of the divine serpent’) ushered from it, struck dead all Geb’s companions and gravely burned the god-king himself. 12 It is tempting to wonder whether wh at we are confronted by here might not be a garbled account of a malfunctioning man-made device: a confused, awe-stricken recollection of a monstrous instrument devised by the scientists of a lost civilization. Weight is added to such extreme speculations when we remember that th is is by no means the only golden box in the ancient world that functioned like a deadly and unpredictable machine. It has a number of quite unmissable similarities to the Hebrews’ enigmatic Ark of the Covenant (which also struck innocent people dead with bolts of fiery energy, which al so was ‘overlaid round about with gold’, and which was said to have co ntained not only the two tablets of the Ten Commandments but ‘the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod.’) 13 A proper look at the implications of all these weird and wonderful boxes (and of other ‘technological’ artefacts referred to in ancient traditions) is beyond the scope of this book. For our purposes here it is sufficient to note that a peculiar atmosphere of dangerous and quasi- technological wizardry seems to surround many of the gods of the Heliopolitan Ennead. Isis, for example (wife and sister of Osiris and mother of Horus) carries a strong whiff of the science lab. A ccording to the Chester Beatty Papyrus in the British Museum she was ‘a cl ever woman ... more intelligent than countless gods ... She was ignorant of nothing in heaven and earth.’ 14 Renowned for her skilful us e of witchcraft and magic, Isis was particularly remembered by the Ancient Egyptians as ‘strong of tongue’, that is being in command of words of power ‘which she knew with correct pronunciation, and halted not in he r speech, and was perfect both in giving the command and in saying the word’. 15 In short, she was believed, by means of her voice alone, to be capable of bending reality and overriding the laws of physics. These same powers, though perhaps in greater degree, were attributed to the wisdom god Thoth who although not a member of the Heliopolitan Ennead is recognized in the Turin Papyrus and other ancient records as the sixth (or sometimes as the seventh) divine pharaoh of Egypt. 16  12 Ibid. 13 Hebrews 9:4.

He was particularly associated with astronomy, mathematics, surveying and geometry, and was described as ‘he who reckons in heaven, the counter of the stars and the me asurer of the earth’. 17 He was also regarded as a deity who understood the mysteries of ‘all that is hidden under the heavenly vault’, and who had the ability to bestow wisdom on selected individuals. It was said that he had inscribed his knowledge in secret books and hidden these about the earth, intending that they should be sought for by future generations but found ‘only by the worthy’—who were to use their discoveries for the benefit of mankind. 18 What stands out most clearly about Th oth, therefore, in addition to his credentials as an ancient scientist, is his role as a benefactor and civilizer. 19 In this respect he closely resembles his predecessor Osiris, the high god of the Pyramid Texts and th e fourth divine pharaoh of Egypt, ‘whose name becometh Sah [Orion], whose leg is long, and his stride extended, the President of the Land of the South ...’ 20 Osiris and the Lords of Eternity Occasionally referred to in the texts as a neb tem, or ‘universal master’, 21 Osiris is depicted as human but al so superhuman, suffering but at the same time commanding.

It is therefore hard to avoid a sense of déjà vu when we read in the Egyptian Book of the Dead that the abode of Osiris also ‘rested on water’ and had walls made of ‘living serpents’. 24 At the very least, the convergence of symbolism linking these two gods and two far-flung regions is striking. There are other obvious parallels as well. The central details of the story of Os iris have been re counted in earlier chapters and we need not go over them again. The reader will not have forgotten that this god—once again like Quetzalcoatl and Viracocha—was remembered principally as a benefact or of mankind, as a bringer of enlightenment and as a gr eat civilizing leader. 25 He was credited, for example, with having abolished cannibalism and was said to have introduced the Egyptians to agriculture—in particular to the cultivation of wheat and barley—and to have taught them the art of fashioning agricultural implements. Since he had an especial liking for fine wines (the myths do not say where he acquir ed this taste), he made a point of ‘teaching mankind the culture of the vi ne, as well as the way to harvest the grape and to store the wine ...’ 26 In addition to the gifts of good living he brought to his subjects, Osiris helped to wean them ‘from their miserable and barbarous manners’ by pr oviding them with a code of laws and inaugurating the cult of the gods in Egypt. 27 When he had set everything in order, he handed over the control of the kingdom to Isis, quit Egypt for many years, and roamed about the world with the sole intention, Diodorus Siculus was told, of visiting all the inhabited earth and teac hing the race of men how to cultivate the vine and sow wheat and barley; for he supposed that if he made men give up their savagery and adopt a gentle manner of life he would receive immortal honours because of the magnitude of his benefactions ... 28 Osiris travelled first to Ethiopia, where he taught tillage and husbandry to the primitive hunter-gatherers he encountered. He also undertook a number of large-scale engineering and hydraulics works: ‘He built canals, with flood gates and regulators ... he raised the river banks and took precautions to prevent the Nile from overflowing ...’ 29 Later he made his      Ancient Egypt, p. 190; Myth and Symbol in Ancient Egypt, p. 230. 23 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection, volume I, p. 2. 24 Chapter CXXV, cited in ibid., volume II, p. 81. 25 See Parts II and III for Quetzalcoatl and Viracocha.

Moving on to Thrace he killed a barb arian king for refusing to adopt his system of government. This was out of character; in general, Osiris was remembered by the Egyptians for having forced no man to carry out his instructions, but by means of gentle persuasion and an appeal to their reason he succeeded in inducing them to practise what he preached. Many of his wise counsels were imparted to his listeners in hymns and songs, which were sung to the acco mpaniment of instruments of music.’ 30 Once again the parallels with Quetzalcoatl and Viracocha are hard to avoid. During a time of darkness an d chaos—quite possibly linked to a flood—a bearded god, or man, mate rializes in Egypt (or Bolivia, or Mexico). He is equipped with a wealth of practical and scientific skills, of the kind associated with mature and highly developed civilizations, which he uses unselfishly for the benefit of humanity. He is instinctively gentle but capable of great firmness when necessary. He is motivated by a strong sense of purpose and, after establishing his headquarters at Heliopolis (or Tiahuanaco, or Teotihua can), he sets forth with a select band of companions to impose order and to reinstate the lost balance of the world. 31 Leaving aside for the present the issue of whether we are dealing here with gods or men, with figments of the primitive imagination or with flesh-and-blood beings, the fact remains that the myths always speak of a company of civilizers: Viracocha has hi s ‘companions’, as have both Quetzalcoatl and Osiris. Sometimes th ere are fierce internal conflicts within these groups, and perhaps struggles for power: the battles between Seth and Horus, and between Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl are obvious examples. Moreover, whether the mythical events unfold in Central America, or in the Andes, or in Egypt, the upshot is also always pretty much the same: the civilizer is eventually plotted against and either driven out or killed. The myths say that Quetzalcoatl and Viracocha never came back (although, as we have seen, their return to the Americas was expected at the time of the Spanish conquest). Osiris, on the other hand, did come back. Although he was murdered by Se t soon after the completion of his worldwide mission to make men ‘give up their savagery’, he won eternal life through his resurrection in the constellation of Orion as the all- powerful god of the dead. Thereaft er, judging souls and providing an immortal example of responsible and benevolent kingship, he dominated the religion (and the culture) of Ancient Egypt for the entire span of its known history.  30 Ibid., p. 2. 31 Ibid., 2-11.

In this respect, however, Egypt is unique. Indeed, although the Pyramid Texts and other archaic source s recognize a period of disruption and attempted usurpation by Set (and his seventy-two ‘precessional’ conspirators), they also depict the transition to the reigns of Horus, Thoth and the later divine pharaohs as being relatively smooth and inevitable. This transition was mimicked, through thousands of years, by the mortal kings of Egypt. From the beginning to the end, they saw themselves as the lineal descendants and living representatives of Horus, son of Osiris. As generation succeed ed generation, it was supposed that each deceased pharaoh was reborn in the sky as ‘an Osiris’ and that each successor to the throne became a ‘Horus’. 32 This simple, refined, and stable scheme was already fully evolved and in place at the beginning of the First Dynasty— around 3100 BC . 33 Scholars accept this; the majority also accept that what we are dealing with here is a highly developed and sophisticated religion. 34 Strangely, very few Egyptologists or archaeologists have questioned where and when this religion took shape. Is it not to defy logic to suppose that well-rounded social and metaphysical ideas like those of the Osir is cult sprung up fully formed in 3100 BC , or that they could have taken such perfect shape in the 300 years which Egyptologists sometimes grudgingly allow for them to have done so? 35 There must have been a far longer period of development than that, spread over several thousands rather than several hundreds of years. Moreover, as we have seen, every surviving record in which the Ancient Egyptians speak directly about their past asserts that their civilization was a legacy of ‘the gods’ who were ‘the first to hold sway in Egypt’. 36 The records are not intern ally consistent: some attribute much greater antiquity to the civilization of Egypt th an others. All, however, clearly and firmly direct our attentio n to an epoch far, far in the past—anything from 8000 to almost 40,000 years before the foundation of the First Dynasty.

In these scenes Osiris wore a variety of different and elaborate crowns which I studied closely as I walked from relief to relief. Crowns similar to these in many respects had been impo rtant parts of the wardrobe of all the pharaohs of Ancient Egypt, at least on the evidence of reliefs depicting them. Strangely, however, in all the years of intensive excavations, archaeologists had not found a single example of a royal crown, or a small part of one, let alone a specimen of the convoluted ceremonial headdresses associated with the gods of the First Time. 6 Of particular interest was the Atef crown. Incorporating the uraeus, the royal serpent symbol (which in Mexico was a rattlesnake but in Egypt was a hooded cobra poised to strike), the central core of this strange contraption was recognizable as an example of the hedjet, the white skittle-shaped war helmet of upper Eg ypt (again known only from reliefs). Rearing up on either side of this core were what seemed to be two thin leaves of metal, and at the front was an attached device, consisting of two wavy blades, which scholars norm ally describe as a pair of rams’ horns. 7 In several reliefs of the Seti I Temp le Osiris was depicted wearing the Atef crown, which seemed to stand ab out two feet high.

Then Ra proceeded to let out the pus and the blood.’ 8 All this was stated in a matter-of-fact way, but—when you stopped to think about it—what kind of crown was it that radiated heat and caused the skin to haemorrhage and break out in pustulant sores?  6 Traveller’s Key to Ancient Egypt, p. 386. 7 The Encyclopaedia of Ancient Egypt, p. 59. 8 Chapter 175 of the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead, cited in Myth and Symbol in Ancient Egypt, p. 137."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 385 Abydos.

There is a canal leading to th e place from the great river ...’ 10 A few hundred years after Strabo’s vi sit, when the religion of Ancient Egypt had been supplanted by the new cult of Christianity, the silt of the river and the sands of the desert began to drift into the Os irieon, filling it foot by foot, century by century, until its upright monoliths and huge lintels were buried and forgotten. An d so it remained, out of sight and out of mind, until the beginning of the twentieth century, when the archaeologists Flinders Petrie and Ma rgaret Murray began excavations. In their 1903 season of digging they uncovered parts of a hall and passageway, lying in the desert about 200 feet south-west of the Seti I Temple and built in the recognizable architectural style of the Nineteenth Dynasty. However, sandwiched between these remains and the rear of the Temple, they also found unmistakable signs that ‘a large underground building’ lay concealed. 11 ‘This hypogeum’, wr ote Margaret Murray, ‘appears to Professor Petrie to be the place that Strabo mentions, usually called Strabo’s Well.’ 12 This was good guesswork on the part of Petrie and Murray. Shortage of cash, however, me ant that their theory of a buried building was not tested until the digging season of 1912-13.

Measuring about 80 feet in length by 40 in width, this plinth was composed of enormous paving blocks and was entirely surrounded by water. Two pools, one rectangular and the other square, had been cut into the plinth along the centre of its long axis and at either end stairways led down to a depth of about 12 feet below the water level. The plinth also supported the two massive colonnades Naville mentioned in his report, each of which consisted of five chunky rose-coloured granite monoliths about eight feet square by 12 feet high and weighing, on average, around 100 tons. 16 The tops of these huge columns were spanned by granite lintels and there was evidence that the whole building had once been roofed over with a seri es of even larger monolithic slabs. 17   14 Ibid. 15 Ibid. 16 Traveller’s Key to Ancient Egypt, p. 391. 17 The Cenotaph of Seti I at Abydos, p. 18."},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 388 Plan of the Osireion.

Also helpful was the fact that water had now seeped up to fill all of the building’s pools, cells and channels to a depth of a few inches below the lip of the central plinth, as the origin al designers had apparently intended"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 389 it should. 18 Looking down in this manner, it was immediately apparent that the plinth formed a rectangular island, surrounded on all four sides by a water-filled moat about 10 feet wide. The moat was contained by an immense, rectangular enclosure wall, no less than 20 feet thick , 19 made of very large blocks of red sandstone disposed in polygonal jigsaw-puzzle patterns. Into the huge thickness of this wall were set the 17 cells mentioned in Naville’s report. Six lay to the east, six to the west, two to the south and three to the north. O ff the central of the three northern cells lay a long transverse chambe r, roofed with and composed of limestone. A similar transverse chamber, also of limestone but no longer with an intact roof, lay immediately south of the great gateway. Finally, the whole structure was enclosed within an outer wall of limestone, thus completing a sequence of inter-nested rectangles, i.e., from the outside in, wall, wall, moat, plinth. Another notable and outstandingly unusual feature of the Osireion was that it was not even approximately aligned to the cardinal points. Instead, like the Way of the Dead at Teotihuaca n in Mexico, it was oriented to the east of due north. Since Ancient Egyp t had been a civilization that could and normally did achieve precise alignments for its buildings, it seemed to me improbable that this apparent ly skewed orientation was accidental. Moreover, although 50 feet higher, th e Seti I Temple was oriented along exactly the same axis—and again not by accident. The question was: which was the older building? Had the axis of the Osireion been predetermined by the axis of the Temp le or vice versa? This, it turned out, was an issue over which considerable controversy, now long forgotten, had once raged. In a deba te which had many connections with that surrounding the Sphinx and the Valley Temple at Giza, eminent archaeologists had initially argued that the Osireion was a building of truly immense antiquity, a view expr essed by Professor Naville in the London Times of 17 March 1914: This monument raises several important questions. As to its date, its great similarity with the Temple of the Sphinx [as the Valley Temple was then known] shows it to be of the same epoch when building was made with enormous stones without any ornament. This is characteristic of the oldest architecture in Egypt. I should even say that we may call it the most ancient stone building in Egypt. 20  18 Ibid., p. 28-9. 19 E.

Describing himself as overawed by the ‘grandeur and stern simplicity’ of the monument’s central hall, with it s remarkable granite monoliths, and by ‘the power of those ancients wh o could bring from a distance and move such gigantic blocks’, Naville made a suggestion concerning the function the Osireion might originally have been intended to serve: ‘Evidently this huge construction was a large reservoir where water was stored during the high Nile ... It is curious that what we may consider as a beginning in architecture is neither a temple nor a tomb, but a gigantic pool, a waterwork ... 21 Curious indeed, and well worth investigating further; something Naville hoped to do the following season. Unfortunately, the First World War intervened and no archaeology could be undertaken in Egypt for several years. As a result, it was not until 1925 that the Egypt Exploration Fund was able to send out another mission, which was led not by Naville but by a young Egyptologist named Henry Frankfort.  21 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 391 Frankfort’s facts Later to enjoy great prestige and influence as professor of Pre-Classical Antiquity at the University of London, Frankfort spent several consecutive digging seasons re-clearing and thoroughly excavating the Osireion between 1925 and 1930. During the course of this work he made discoveries which, so far as he was concerned, ‘settled the date of the building’: 1 A granite dovetail in position at the top of the southern side of the main entrance to the central hall, which was inscribed with the cartouche of Seti I. 2 A similar dovetail in position inside the eastern wall of the central hall. 3 Astronomical scenes and inscriptions by Seti I carved in relief on the ceiling of the northern transverse chamber. 4 The remains of similar scenes in the southern transverse chamber. 5 An ostracon (piece of broken pots herd) found in the entrance passage and bearing the legend ‘Seti is serviceable to Osiris’. 22 The reader will recall the lemming behaviour which led to a dramatic change of scholarly opinion about th e antiquity of the Sphinx and the Valley Temple (due to the discovery of a few statues and a single cartouche which seemed to imply some sort of connection with Khafre). Frankfort’s finds at Abydos caused a similar volte-face over the antiquity of the Osireion. In 1914 it was ‘the mo st ancient stone building in Egypt’. By 1933, it had been beamed forward in time to the reign of Seti I— around 1300 BC —whose cenotaph it was now believed to be. 23 Within a decade, the standard Egyptological texts began to print the attribution to Seti I as though it were a fact, verifiable by experience or observation. It is not a fact, however, merely Frankfort’s interpretation of the evidence he had found. The only facts are that certain inscriptions and decorations left by Seti appear in an otherwise completely anonymous structure. One plausible explanation is that the structure must have been built by Seti, as Frankfort proposed. The other possibili ty is that the half-hearted and scanty decorations, cartouches and in scriptions found by Frankfort could have been placed in the Osireion as part of a renovation and repair operation undertaken in Seti’s time (implying that the structure was by then ancient, as Naville and others had proposed). What are the merits of these mutua lly contradictory propositions which  22 The Cenotaph of Seti I at Abydos, pp. 4, 25, 68-80. 23 Ibid., in general."},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 392 identify the Osireion as (a) the ol dest building in Egypt, and (b) a relatively late New Kingdom structure? Proposition (b)—that it is the cenotaph of Seti I—is the only attribution accepted by Egyptologists. On close inspection, however, it rests on the circumstantial evidence of the cartouches and inscriptions which prove nothing. Indeed part of this evidence appears to contradict Frankfort’s case. The ostracon bearing the legend ‘Seti is serviceable to Osiris’ sounds less like praise for the works of an original builder than praise for a restorer who had renovated, and pe rhaps added to, an ancient structure identified with the First Time god Osiris. And another awkward little matter has also been overlooked. The south and north ‘transverse chambers’, which contain Seti I’s detailed decorations and inscriptions, lie outside the twenty-foot-thick enclosure wall which so adamantly defines the huge, undecorated megalithic core of the building. This had raised the reasonable suspicion in Naville’s mind (though Frankfort chose to ignore it) that the two chambers co ncerned were ‘not contemporaneous with the rest of the building’ but ha d been added much later during the reign of Seti I, ‘probably when he built his own temple’. 24 To cut a long story short, therefore, everything about proposition (b) is based in one way or another on Fr ankfort’s not necessarily infallible interpretation of various bits and pieces of possibly intrusive evidence. Proposition (a)—that the core edifice of the Osireion had been built millennia before Seti’s time—rests on the nature of the architecture itself. As Naville observed, the Osireion’s sim ilarity to the Valley Temple at Giza ‘showed it to be of the same ep och when building was made with enormous stones’. Likewise, until the end of her life, Margaret Murray remained convinced that the Osireion was not a cenotaph at all (least of all Seti’s). She said, It was made for the celebration of the mysteries of Osiris, and so far is unique among all the surviving buildings of Egypt. It is clearly early, for the great blocks of which it is built are of the style of the Old Kingdom; the simplicity of the actual building also points to it being of that early date. The decoration was added by Seti I, who in that way laid claim to the building, but seeing how often a Pharaoh claimed the work of his predecessors by putting his name on it, this fact does not carry much weight. It is the style of the building, the type of the masonry, the tooling of the stone, and not the name of a king, which date a building in Egypt. 25 This was an admonition Frankfort migh t well have paid more attention to, for as he bemusedly observed of his ‘cenotaph’, ‘It has to be admitted that no similar building is know n from the Nineteenth Dynasty.’ 26 Indeed it is not just a matter of the Nineteenth Dynasty. Apart from the Valley Temple and other Cyclopean edific es on the Giza plateau, no other building remotely resembling the Osireion is known from any other  24 ‘Excavations at Abydos’, pp. 164-5. 25 The Splendour that was Egypt, pp. 160-1. 26 The Cenotaph of Seti I at Abydos, p. 23."},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 393 epoch of Egypt’s long history. This handful of supposedly Old Kingdom structures, built out of giant megalit hs, seems to belong in a unique category. They resemble one another much more than they resemble any other known style of architecture and in all cases there are question- marks over their identity. Isn’t this precisely what one would expect of buildings not erected by any historical pharaoh but dating back to prehistoric times? Doesn’t it make sense of the mysterious way in which the Sphinx and the Valley Temple, and now the Osireion as well, seem to have become vaguely connected with the names of particul ar pharaohs (Khafre and Seti I), without ever yielding a single piece of evidence that clearly and unequivocally proves those pharaohs built the structures concerned? Aren’t the tenuous links much more indicative of the work of restorers seeking to attach themselves to ancient and venerable monuments than of the original architects of those monuments—whoever they might have been and in whatever epoch they might have lived? Setting sail across seas of sand and time Before leaving Abydos, there was one other puzzle that I wanted to remind myself of. It lay buried in the desert, about a kilometre north-west of the Osireion, across sands littered with the rolling, cluttered tumuli of ancient graveyards. Out among these cemeteries, many of which dated back to early dynastic and pre-dynastic times, the jackal gods Anubis and Upuaut had traditionally reigned supreme. Openers of the way, guardians of the spirits of the dead, I knew that they had played a central role in the mysteries of Osiris that had been enacted each year at Abydos— apparently throughout the span of Ancient Egyptian history. It seemed to me that there was a sense in which they guarded the mysteries still. For what was the Osireion if was not a huge, unsolved mystery that deserved closer scrutiny than it has received from the scholars whose job it is to look into these matters? And what was the burial in the desert of twelve high-prowed, seagoing ships if not also a mystery that cried out, loudly, for solution? It was the burial place of those ship s I was now crossing the cemeteries of the jackal gods to see: The Guardian, London, 21 December 1991: A fleet of 5000-year-old royal ships has been found buried eight miles from the Nile. American and Egyptian archaeologists discovered the 12 large wooden boats at Abydos ... Experts said the boats—which are 50 to 60 feet long—a re about 5000 years old, making them Egypt’s earliest royal ships and among the earliest boats found anywhere ... The experts say the ships, discovered in September, were probably meant for burial so the souls of the pharaohs could be transported on them. ‘We never expected to find such a fleet, especially so far from the Nile,’ said David O’Connor, the expedition leader and curator of the Egyptian Section of the University Museum of"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 394 the University of Pennsylvania ... 27 The boats were buried in the shadow of a gigantic mud-brick enclosure, thought to have been the mortuary temple of a Second Dynasty pharaoh named Khasekhemwy, who had ruled Egypt in the twenty-seventh century BC . 28 O’Connor, however, was certain that they were not associated directly with Khasekhemwy but rather with the nearby (and largely ruined) ‘funerary-cult enclosure built for Pharaoh Djer early in Dynasty I. The boat graves are not likely to be earlier th an this and may in fact have been built for Djer, but this remains to be proven.’ 29 A sudden strong gust of wind blew across the desert, scattering sheets of sand. I took refuge for a while in the lee of the looming walls of the Khasekhemwy enclosure, close to th e point where the University of Pennsylvania archaeologists had, for legitimate secu rity reasons, reburied the twelve mysterious boats they had stumbled on in 1991. They had hoped to return in 1992 to continue the excavations, but there had been various hitches and, in 1993, the dig was still being postponed. In the course of my research O’Conno r had sent me the official report of the 1991 season, 30 mentioning in passing that some of the boats might have been as much as 72 feet in length. 31 He also noted that the boat- shaped brick graves in which they were enclosed, which would have risen well above the level of the surrounding desert in early dynastic times, must have produced quite an extraordinary effect when they were new: Each grave had originally been thickly co ated with mud plaster and whitewash so the impression would have been of twelve (or more) huge ‘boats’ moored out in the desert, gleaming brilliantly in the Egyptian sun. The notion of their being moored was taken so seriously that an irregularly shaped small boulder was found placed near the ‘prow’ or ‘stern’ of several boat grav es. These boulders could not have been there naturally or by accident; their placement seems deliberate, not random. We can think of them as ‘anchors’ intended to help ‘moor’ the boats. 32 Like the 140-foot ocean-going vessel found buried beside the Great Pyramid at Giza (see Chapter Thirty-three), one thing was immediately clear about the Abydos boats—they were of an advanced design capable of riding out the most powerful waves and the worst weather of the open seas. According to Cheryl Haldane, a nautical archaeologist at Texas A- and-M University, they showed ‘a high degree of technology combined with grace’. 33 Exactly as was the case with the Pyramid boat, therefore (but at least 500 years earlier) the Abyd os fleet seemed to indicate that a people able to draw upon the accumu lated experiences of a long tradition  27 Guardian, London, 21 December 1991. 28 David O’Connor, ‘Boat Graves and Pyramid Origins’, in Expedition, volume 33, No. 3, 1991, p. 7ff. 29 Ibid., pp. 9-10. 30 Sent to me by fax 27 January 1993. 31 David O’Connor, ‘Boat Graves and Pyramid Origins’, p. 12. 32 Ibid., p. 11-12 . 33 Guardian, 21 December 1991."},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 395 of seafaring had been present in Eg ypt from the very beginning of its 3000 year history. Moreover I knew th at the earliest wall paintings found in the Nile Valley, dating back perh aps as much as 1500 years before the burial of the Abydos fleet (to around 4500 BC ) showed the same long, sleek, high-prowed vessels in action. 34 Could an experienced race of ancient seafarers have become involved with the indigenous inhabitants of the Nile Valley at some indeterminate period before the official begi nning of history at around 3000 BC ? Wouldn’t this explain Egypt’s curious and paradoxical—but nonetheless enduring—obsession with ships in the desert (and references to what sounded like sophisticated ships in th e Pyramid Texts, including one said to have been more than 2000 feet long)? 35 In raising these conjectures, I did not doubt that religious symbolism had existed in Ancient Egypt in which, as scholars endlessly pointed out, ships had been designated as vessels for the pharaoh’s soul. Nevertheless that symbolism did not so lve the problem posed by the high level of technological achievement of the buried ships; such evolved and sophisticated designs called for a long period of development. Wasn’t it worth looking into the possibility—even if only to rule it out—that the Giza and Abydos vessels could have been parts of a cultural legacy, not of a land-loving, riverside-dwelling, agricultural people like the indigenous Ancient Egyptians but of an advanced seafaring nation? Such seafarers could have been expected to be navigators who would have known how to set a course by the stars and who would perhaps also have developed the skills necessary to draw up accurate maps and charts of the oceans they had traversed. Might they also have been architects and stonemasons whose characteristic medium had been poly gonal, megalithic blocks like those of the Valley Temple and the Osireion? And might they have been associated in some way with the legendary gods of the First Time, said to have brought to Egypt not only civilization and astronomy and architecture, and the knowledge of mathematics and writing, but a host of other useful skills and gifts, by far the most notable and the most significant of which had been the gift of agriculture?

All these chronologies nevertheless agree on a very ancient date for the First Time of Osiris: the golden age when the gods were believed to have ruled in Egypt. In addition, the sources demonstrate a striking convergence ov er the importance they accord to the eleventh millennium BC in particular, 2 the precessional Age of Leo when the great ice sheets of the northern hemisphere were undergoing their final, ferocious meltdown. Perhaps coincidentally, evidence unearthed since the 1970s by geologists, archaeologists and prehis torians like Michael Hoffman, Fekri Hassan and Professor Fred Wendorff has confirmed that the eleventh millennium BC was indeed an important peri od in Egyptian prehistory, during which immense and devastatin g floods swept repeatedly down the Nile Valley. 3 Fekri Hassan has speculated that this prolonged series of natural disasters, which reached a cres cendo around or just after 10,500 BC (and continued to recur pe riodically until about 9000 BC ) might have been responsible for snuffing out the early agricultural experiment. 4 At any rate, that experiment did come to an end (for whatever reason), and appears not to have been attemp ted again for at least another 5000 years. 5  1 Egypt before the Pharaohs., pp. 29, 88. 2 To give yet another example, here is Diodorus Siculus (first century BC ) passing on what he was told by Egyptian priests: ‘The number of years from Osiris and Isis, they say, to the reign of Alexander, who founded the city which bears his name in Egypt [fourth century BC ], is over ten thousand ...’ Diodorus Siculus, volume I, p. 73. 3 Egypt before The Pharaohs, p. 85. 4 Ibid., p. 90. 5 A History of Ancient Egypt, p. 21."},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 398 Kick-start There is something mysterious about Egypt’s so-called ‘palaeolithic agricultural revolution’. Here, quoted from the standard texts (Hoffman’s Egypt before The Pharaohs and Wendorff and Schild’s Prehistory of the Nile Valley ) are some key facts from the little that is known about this great leap forward that occurred so inexplicably towards the end of the last Ice Age: 1 ‘Shortly after 13,000 BC , grinding stones and sickle blades with a glossy sheen on their bits (the result of silica from cut stems adhering to a sickle’s cutting edge) appear in late Palaeo lithic tool kits ... It is clear that the grinding stones we re used in preparing plant food.’ 6 2 At many riverside sites, at exactly this time, fish stopped being a significant food source and became a negligible one, as evidenced by the absence of fish remains: ‘The dec line in fishing as a source of food is related to the appearance of a new food resource represented by ground grain. The associated pollen strongly suggests that this grain was barley, and significantly, this large grass-pollen, tentatively identified as barley, makes a sudden appearance in the pollen profile just before the time when the first settlements were established in this area ...’ 7 3 ‘As apparently spectacular as the rise of protoagriculture in the late Palaeolithic Nile Valley was its precipitous decline. No one knows exactly why, but after about 10,500 BC the early sickle blades and grinding disappear to be replaced throughout Egypt by Epipalaeolithic hunting, fishing and gathering peoples who use stone tools.’ 8 Scanty though the evidence may be, it is clear in its general implications: Egypt enjoyed a golden age of agricultural plenty which began around 13,000 BC and was brought to an abrupt halt around the middle of the eleventh millennium BC . A kick-start to the process appears to have been given by the introduction of already domesticated barley into the Nile Valley, immediately fo llowed by the establishment of a number of farming settlements whic h exploited the new resource. The settlements were equipped with simple but extremely effective agricultural tools and accessories. After the eleventh millennium BC , however, there was a prolonged relapse to more primitive ways of life. The imagination is inclined to roam freely over such data in search of an explanation—and all such explanations can only be guesswork. What  6 Egypt before The Pharaohs, p. 88. 7 Fred Wendorff and Romuald Schild, Prehistory of the Nile Valley, Academic Press, New York, 1976, p. 291. 8 Egypt before the Pharaohs, pp. 89-90."},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 399 is certain is that the none of th e evidence suggests that palaeolithic Egypt’s ‘agricultural revolution’ could have been a local initiative. On the contrary it feels in every way like a transplant. A transplant appears suddenly, after all, and can be rejected equally fast if conditions change, just as settled agriculture seems to have been rejected in ancient Egypt after the great Nile floods of the eleventh millennium BC . Climate Change What was the weather like then? We’ve noted in earlier chapters that the Sahara, a relatively young desert, was green savannah until about the tenth millennium BC ; this savannah, brightened by lakes, boil ing with game, extended across much of upper Egypt. Farther north, the De lta area was marshy but dotted with many large and fertile islands. Overall the climate was significantly cooler, cloudier and rainier than it is today. 9 Indeed, for two or three thousand years before and about a thousand years after 10,500 BC it rained and rained and rained. Then, as though marking an ecological turning-point, the floods came. When they were over, increasingly arid conditions set in. 10 This period of desiccatio n lasted until approximately 7000 BC when the ‘Neolithic Subpluvial’ began with a thousand years of heavy rains, followed by 3000 years of moderate rainfall which once again proved ideal for agriculture: ‘For a time the deserts bloomed and human societies colonized areas that have been unable to support such dense populations since.’ 11 By the birth of dynast ic Egypt around 3000 BC , however, the climate had turned around again and a new peri od of desiccation had begun—one that has continued until the present day. This, then, in broad outline, is the environmental stage upon which the mysteries of Egyptian civilization have been played out: rain and floods between 13,000 BC and 9500 BC ; a dry period until 7000 BC ; rain again (though increasingly less frequent) until about 3000 BC ; thereafter a renewed and enduring dry period. The expanse of years is great, but if one is looking for a First Time within it which might accord with the golden age of the gods, one’s thoughts turn naturally to the mysterious epoch of early agricultural experimentation that shadowed th e great rains and floods between 13,000 BC and 10,500 BC .  9 Ibid., p. 86. 10 Ibid., pp. 97-8. 11 Ibid., p. 161."},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 400 Unseen connections? This epoch was crucial not only for the Ancient Egyptians but for many peoples in other areas. Indeed, as we saw in Part IV, it was the epoch of dramatic climate shifts, rapidly rising sea levels, earth movements, floods, volcanic eruption s, bituminous rains and darkened skies that was the most probable source of many of the great worldwide myths of universal cataclysm. Could it also have been an epoch in which ‘gods’ really did walk among men, as the legends said? On the Bolivian Altiplano those gods were known as the Viracochas and were linked to the astonishing megalit hic city of Tiahuanaco, which may have pre-existed the immense floods in the Andes in the eleventh millennium BC . Thereafter, according to Professor Arthur Posnansky, though the flood-waters subsided, ‘the culture of the Altiplano did not again attain a high point of developm ent but rather fell into a total and definitive decadence.’ 12 Of course, Posnansky’s conclusion s are controversial and must be evaluated on their own merits. Nevertheless, it is interesting that both the Bolivian Altiplano and Egypt should have been scoured by immense floods in the eleventh millennium BC . In both areas too, there are signs that extraordinarily early agricultural experiments—apparently based on introduced techniques—were attempted and then abandoned. 13 And in both areas important question-marks have been raised over the dating of monuments: the Puma Punku and th e Kalasasaya in Tiahuanaco, for example, which Posnansky argued might have been built as early as 15,000 BC , 14 and, in Egypt, megalithic st ructures like the Osireion, the Great Sphinx and the Valley Temple of Khafre at Giza, which John West and the Boston University geologis t Robert Schoch have dated on geological grounds to earlier than 10,000 BC . Could there be an unseen connect ion linking all these beautiful, enigmatic monuments, the anomalous agricultural experiments of 13,000-10,000 BC , and the legends of civiliz er gods like Osiris and Viracocha? ‘Where is the rest of this civilization?’ As we set out on the road from Abydos to Luxor, where we were to meet John West, I realized that there was a sense in which all the connections would look after themselves if the ce ntral issue of the antiquity of the monuments could be settled. In othe r words, if West’s geological  12 See Chapter Twelve. 13 Ibid. 14 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 401 evidence proved that the Sphinx was more than 12,000 years old, the history of human civilization was going to have to be rewritten.

When West’s evidence was presente d in 1992 at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science it had been taken seriously enough to be publicly debated by the Chicago University Egyptologist Mark Lehner, director of the Giza Mapping Project, who—to the astonishment of almost everybod y present—had been unable to come up with a convincing refutation. ‘When you say something as complex as the Sphinx dates to 9000 or 10,000 BC ,’ Lehner had concluded: it implies, of course, that there was a very high civilization that was capable of producing the Sphinx at that period. The question an archaeologist has to ask, therefore, is this: if the Sphinx was made at that time then where is the rest of this civilization, where is the rest of this culture? 15 Lehner, however, was missing the point. If the Sphinx did date to 9000 or 10,000 BC , the onus was not on West to produce other evidence for the existence of the civilization which produced it, but on Egyptologists and archaeologists to explain how they had got things so wrong, so consis tently, for so long .

The one West was referring to at that moment, howeve r, was the anomaly of the Fourth Dynasty pyramids: an anomaly because of what had happened during the Third, Fifth and Sixth Dynasties. Zose r’s Step Pyramid at Saqqara (Third Dynasty) was an imposing edifice, but it was built with relatively small, manageable blocks that five or six men working together could carry, and its internal chambers were structurally unsound. The pyramids of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties (although adorned inside with the beautiful Pyramid Texts) were so poorly built and had collapsed so completely that today most of them amount to little more than mounds of rubble. The Fourth Dynasty pyramids at Giza, ho wever, were wonderfully well made and had endured the passage of thousands of years more or less intact. It was this sequence of events, or rather its implications, that West felt Egyptologists should have paid more attention to: ‘There’s a discrepancy in the scenario that reads “building kind of rubbishy pyramids that are structurally unsound, suddenly buildi ng absolutely unbelievable pyramids that are structurally the most incredible things ever conceived of, and then immediately afterwards going back to structurally unsound pyramids.” It doesn’t make sense ...

To our east lay the battered but noble ruins of the Luxor and Karnak temples. Beneath us, transmitted through the hull of the boat, we could feel the lap and flow of the wate r as it rolled by on its meridional course towards the far-off Delta. West had first presented his th esis for an older Sphinx in Serpent in the Sky, a comprehensive exposition of the work of the French mathematician R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz . Schwaller’s research at the Luxor Temple between 1937 and 1952 had un earthed mathematical evidence which suggested that Egyptian science and culture had been far more advanced and sophisticated than modern scholars had appreciated. However, as West put it, this evidence had been set out in ‘abstruse, complex and uncompromising language ... Few readers seem comfortable with raw Schwaller. It’s a bit like trying to wade directly into high energy physics without extensive prior training.’ Schwaller’s principal publications, bo th originally in French, were the massive three-volume Temple de l’Homme, which focused on Luxor, and the more general Roi de la théocratie Pharaonique. In this latter work, subsequently translated into English as Sacred Science, Schwaller made a passing reference to the tremendous floods and rains which devastated Egypt in the eleventh millennium BC . Almost as an afterthought, he added: A great civilization must have preceded the vast movements of water that passed over Egypt, which leads us to assume that the Sphinx already existed, sculptured in the rock of the west cliff at Giza—that Sphinx whose leonine body, except for the head, shows indisputable signs of water erosion.’ 2  1 Traveller’s Key to Ancient Egypt; Serpent in the Sky, p. 20. 2 Sacred Science, p. 96."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 404 While working on Serpent, West was struck by the possible significance of this remark and decided to follow it up: ‘I realized that if I could prove Schwaller’s offhand observation empi rically, this would be ironclad evidence for the existence of a previously unidentified high civilization of distant antiquity.’ ‘Why?’ ‘Once you’ve established that water was the agent that eroded the Sphinx the answer is almost childishly simple. It can be explained to anybody who reads the National Enquirer or the News of the World. It’s almost moronically simple ... The Sphinx is supposed to have been built by Khafre around 2500 BC , but since the beginning of dynastic times—say 3000 BC onwards—there just hasn’t been enough rain on the Giza plateau to have caused the very extensive erosion that we see all over the Sphinx’s body. You really have to go back to before 10,000 BC to find a wet enough climate in Egypt to accoun t for weathering of this type and on this scale. It therefore follows th at the Sphinx must have been built before 10,000 BC and since it’s a massive, sophis ticated work of art it also follows that it must have been built by a high civilization.’ ‘But John,’ Santha asked, ‘how can you be so sure that the weathering was caused by rain water? Couldn’t th e desert winds have done the job just as well? After all even orthodox Egyptologists admit that the Sphinx has existed for nearly 5000 years. Isn’t that long enough for these effects to have been caused by wind erosion?’ ‘Naturally that was one of the first possibilities that I had to exclude. Only if I could show that wind-borne abrasive sand couldn’t possibly have brought the Sphinx to its present condition would there be any point in looking further into the impl ications of water erosion.’ Robert Schoch’s geology: Unriddling the Sphinx A key issue turned out to be the deep trench that the monument was surrounded by on all sides: ‘Because th e Sphinx is set in a hollow,’ West explained, ‘sand piles up to its neck within a few decades if it’s left untended ... It has been left untended often during historical times. In fact through a combination of te xtual references and historical extrapolations it’s possible to prove that during the 4500 years that have elapsed since it was ostensibly built by Khafre it’s been buried to its neck for as much as 3300 years. 3 That means that in all this time there has  3 West’s detailed evidence is set out in Serpent in the Sky, pp. 184-20.

The point is that if the Sphinx was really built by Khafre in the Old Kingdom, and if wind erosion was capable of inflicting such damage on it in so short a time-span, then other Old Kingdom structures in the area, built out of the same limestone, ought to show similar weathering. But none do—you know, absolutely unmistak able Old Kingdom tombs, full of hieroglyphs and inscriptions—none of them show the same type of weathering as the Sphinx.’ Indeed, none did. Professor Robe rt Schoch, a Boston University geologist and specialist in rock erosion who had played a key role in validating West’s evidence, was satisf ied as to the reason for this. The weathering of the Sphinx—and of the walls of its surrounding rock-hewn enclosure—had not been caused by wind-scouring at all but by thousands of years of heavy rainfall long ages before the Old Kingdom came into being. Having won over his professional p eers at the 1992 Convention of the Geological Society of America, 4 Schoch went on to explain his findings to a much wider and more eclectic audience (including Egyptologists) at the 1992 Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). He began by pointi ng out to delegates that ‘the body of the Sphinx and the walls of the Sphinx ditch are deeply weathered and eroded ... This erosion is a couple of metres thick in places, at least on the walls. It’s very deep, it’s very old in my opinion, and it gives a rolling and undulating profile ...’ 5 Such undulations are easily recognizable to stratigraphers and palaeontologists as having been caused by ‘precipitation-induced weathering’. As Santha Faiia’s photographs of the Sphinx and the Sphinx enclosure indicate, this weathering takes the distinctive form of a combination of deep vertical fissur es and undulating, horizontal coves— ‘a classic textbook example,’ in Scho ch’s words, ‘of what happens to a limestone structure when you have rain beating down on it for thousands of years ... It’s clearly rain precip itation that produced these erosional      Chephren-present day, c. 4700 years 3300 years 4 ‘An abstract of our team’s work was submitted to the Geological Society of America, and we were invited to present our findings at a poster session of at the GSA convention in San Diego—the geological Superbowl. Geologists from all over the world thronged to our booth, much intrigued. Dozens of experts in fields relevant to our research offered help and advice. Shown the evidence, some geologists just laughed, astounded [as Schoch had been initially] that in two centuries of research, no one, geologist or Egyptologist, had noticed that the Sphinx had been weathered by water.’ Serpent in the Sky, p. 229; Mystery of the Sphinx. NBC-TV, 1993. 275 geologists endorsed Schoch’s findings. 5 AAAS, Annual Meeting 1992, Debate: How Old is the Sphinx?"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 406 features.’ 6 Wind/sand erosion presents a very different profile of sharp-edged horizontal channels selectively scoure d out from the softer layers of the affected rock. Under no circumstances can it cause the vertical fissures particularly visible in the wall of the Sphinx enclosure. These could only have been ‘formed by wate r running down the wall’, 7 the result of rain falling in enormous quantities, cascading over the slope of the Giza plateau and down into the Sphinx enclosure below. ‘It picked out the weak spots in the rock,’ Schoch elaborated, ‘and opened them up into these fissures—clear evidence to me as a geologist that this erosional feature was caused by rainfall.’ 8 Although in some places obscured by repair blocks put in place by numerous restorers over the passing millennia, the same observation holds true for the scooped-out, undulating, scalloped coves that run the entire length of the Sphinx’s body. Again, these are characteristic of precipitation-induced weathering because only long periods of heavy rainfall beating down on the upper parts of the immense structure (and cascading over its sides) could have produced such effects. Confirmation of this comes from the fact that th e limestone out of which the Sphinx was carved is not uniform in its composition, but co nsists of a series of hard and soft layers in which some of the more durable rocks recede farther than some of the less durable rocks. 9 Such a profile simply could not have been produced by wind er osion (which would have selectively chiselled out the softer layers of rock) but ‘is entirely ‘consistent with precipitation-induced weathering where you have water, rain water beating down from above. The rocks hi gher up are the more durable ones but they recede back farther than some of the less durable rocks lower in the section which are more protected.’ 10 In his summing up at the AAAS meeting, Schoch concluded: It’s well known that the Sphinx enclosure fills with sand very quickly, in just a matter of decades, under the desert conditions of the Sahara. And it has to be dug out periodically. And this has been the case since ancient times. Yet you still get this dramatic rolling, erosional profile in the Sphinx enclosure ... Simply put, therefore, what I’m suggesting is that this rolling profile, these features seen on the body and in the Sphinx ditch, hark back to a much earlier period when there was more precipitation in the area, and more moisture, more rain on the Giza plateau.’ 11 As Schoch admitted, he was not the first geologist to have noticed the ‘anomalous precipitation-induced weat hering features on the core body  6 Mystery of the Sphinx. 7 Ibid. 8 Ibid. 9 Ibid. 10 Ibid. 11 AAAS Annual Meeting 1992."},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 407 of the Sphinx’. 12 He was, however, the first to have become involved in public debates over the immense historical implications of this weathering. His attitude was that he preferred to stick to his geology: I’ve been told over and over again that the peoples of Egypt, as far as we know, did not have either the technology or the social organization to cut out the core body of the Sphinx in pre-dynastic time s ... However, I don’t see it as being my problem as a geologist. I’m not seeking to shift the burden, but its really up to the Egyptologists and archaeologists to figure out who carved it. If my findings are in conflict with their theory about the rise of civilization then maybe its time for them to re-evaluate that theory. I’m not saying that the Sphinx was built by Atlanteans, or people from Mars, or extra-terrestrials . I’m just following the science where it leads me, and it leads me to conclude that the Sphinx was built much earlier than previously thought ...’ 13 Legendary civilizations How much earlier? John West told us that he and Scho ch had ‘a friendly debate going’ about the age of the Sphinx: ‘Schoch puts the date somewhere between 5000 BC and 7000 BC minimum [the epoch of the Neolithic Subpluvial] mainly by taking the most cautious view allowed by the data to hand. As a professor of Geology at a big university, he’s almost constrained to take a conservative view—and it’s true that there were rains between 7000 BC and 5000 BC . However, for a variety of both intuitive and scholarly reasons, I think that the date is much, much older and that most of the weathering of the Sphinx took place in the earlier rainy period before 10,000 BC ... Frankly, if it was as re latively recent as 5000 to 7000 BC , I think we’d probably have found othe r evidence of the civilization that carved it. A lot of evidence from that period has been found in Egypt. There are some strange anomalies within it, I’ll admit, 14 but most of it— the vast bulk—is really quite rudimentary.’ ‘So who built the Sphinx if it wasn’t the pre-dynastic Egyptians?’ ‘My conjecture is that the whole riddle is linked in some way to those legendary civilizations spoken of in all the mythologies of the world. You know—that there were great catastroph es, that a few people survived and went wandering around the earth and that a bit of knowledge was preserved here, a bit there ... My hunch is that the Sphinx is linked to all that. If I were asked to place a bet I’d say that it predates the break-up of the last Ice Age and is probably older than 10000 BC , perhaps even older than 15,000 BC . My conviction—actually it’s more than a conviction—is that it’s vastly old?  12 Ibid. The relevant geologists include Farouk El Baz, and Roth and Raffai. 13 Extracts from Mystery of the Sphinx and AAAS meeting. 14 Under the category of anomalies, West made specific reference to the bowls carved out of diorite and other hard stones described in Part VI."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 408 This was a conviction I increasingly shared—and, I reminded myself, that most nineteenth-century Egyptologists had shared it too. Nevertheless the Sphinx’s appearance argued against such intuitions since there was no doubt that its head looked conventionally pharaonic. ‘If it’s as old as you think it is ,’ I now asked John, ‘then how do you explain that the sculptors depict ed it wearing the characteristic nemes head-dress and uraeus of dynastic times?’ ‘I’m not bothered about that. In fact, as you know, Egyptologists contend that the face of the Sphinx resembles the face of Khafre—its one of the reasons why they claim it must have been built by him. Schoch and I have looked into this very carefull y. We think, from the proportions of the head relative to the rest of the body, that it’s been recarved during dynastic times—and that’s why it look s very dynastic. But we don’t think it was ever meant to represent Khafre . As part of our ongoing research into these issues we had Lieutenant Frank Domingo, a forensic artist with the New York Police Department, co me over and do point by point comparisons between the face of the Sphinx and the face of Cephren’s statue in the Cairo Museum. His conclusion was that in no way was the Sphinx ever intended to represent Khafre. It’s not just a matter of it being a different face—it’s probably a different race. 15 So this is a very ancient monument that was recarved at a much later date. Originally it may not even have had a human face. Mayb e it started out with a lion’s face as well as a lion’s body.’ Magellan and the first dinosaur bone After my own explorations at Giza I was interested to know whether West’s research had cast doubt on the orthodox dating of any of the other monuments on the plateau—particularly the so-called Valley Temple of Khafre. ‘We think there’s quite a lot of stuff that may be older,’ he told me. ‘Not just the Valley Temple but also the Mortuary Temple up the hill, probably something to do with the Menkaure complex, maybe even the Pyramid of Khafre ...’ ‘What in the Menkaure complex?’ ‘Well, the Mortuary Temple. An d actually I’m only using the conventional attribution of the Pyramids for convenience here ...’  15 'After reviewing my various drawings, schematics and measurements, my final conclusion concurs with my initial reacti on: the two works represent two separate individuals. The proportions in the frontal view and especially the angles and facial protrusion in the lateral views, convinced me that the Sphinx is not Khafre. If the ancient Egyptians were skilled technicians and capable of duplicating images, then these two works cannot represent the same individual.' Frank Domingo, cited in Serpent in the Sky, p. 232.

So do you think it’s possible th at the pyramids are as old as the Sphinx too?’ ‘It’s hard to say. I think somethin g was there where those pyramids now are—because of the geometry. The Sphinx was part of a master-plan. And the Khafre Pyramid is maybe the most interesting in that respect because it was definitely built in two stages . If you look at it—maybe you’ve noticed—you’ll see that its base consists of several courses of gigantic blocks similar in style to the blocks of the core masonry of the Valley Temple. Superimposed above the base, the rest of the pyramid is composed of smaller, less precisely engineered stuff. But when you look at it, knowing what you’re looking for, you see instantly that it’s built in two separate bits. I mean I can’t help but feel that the vast blocks on the bottom date from the earlier period—from the time the Sphinx was built—and that the second part was added later—but even then not necessarily by Khafre. As you go into this you begin to realize that the more you learn the more complex everything becomes. For example, there may even have been an interm ediate civilization, which actually would correspond to the Egyptian texts. They talk themselves about two long prior periods. In the first of these Egypt was supposedly ruled by the gods—the Neteru—and in the second it was ruled by the Shemsu Hor, the “Companions of Horus”. So, as I say, the problems just get more and more complicated. Fortunately, however, the bottom line stays simple. The bottom line is the Sphinx wasn’t built by Khafre. The geology proves that it’s a hell of a lot older ...’ ‘Nevertheless the Egyptologists won’t accept that it is. One of the arguments they’ve used against you—Mark Lehner did so—goes something like this: “If the Sp hinx was made before 10,000 BC then why can’t you show us the rest of the civili zation that built it?” In other words, why don’t you have any other evidence to put forward for the presence of your legendary lost civilization apart from a few structures on the Giza plateau? What do you say to that?’ ‘First off, there are structures outside Giza—for example the Osireion in Abydos, where you’ve just come from . We think that amazing edifice may relate to our work on the Sphinx. Even if the Osireion didn’t exist, however, the absence of other eviden ce wouldn’t worry me. I mean, to make a big deal out of the fact that further confirmatory evidence hasn’t been found yet and to use this to try to scu ttle the arguments for an older Sphinx is completely illogical. Analog ously it’s like saying to Magellan ... “Where are the other guys who’ve sailed round the world? Of course it’s still flat.” Or in 1838 when the first dinosaur bone was found they would have said, “Of course there’s no su ch thing as a giant extinct animal. Where’s the rest of the skeletons? They’ve only found one bone.” But once a few people began to realize that this bone could only be from an extinct animal, within twenty years the museums of the world were filled up with complete dinosaur skeletons.

I’m absolutely certain that other evidence will be found once a few people start looking in the right places—along the banks of the ancien t Nile, for example, which is miles from the present Nile, or even at the bottom of the Mediterranean, which was dry during the last Ice Age.’ The problem of transmission I asked John West why he thought that Egyptologists and archaeologists were so unwilling to consider that the Sphinx might be a clue to the existence of a forgotten episode in human history. ‘The reason, I think, is that they’re quite fixed in their ideas about the linear evolution of civilization. They fi nd it hard to come to terms with the notion that there might have been people, more than 12,000 years ago, who were more sophisticated than we are today ... The Sphinx, and the geology which proves its antiquity, and the fact that the technology that was involved in making it is in many ways almost beyond our own capacities, contradicts the belief that civilization and technology have evolved in a straightforward, linear way ... Because even with the best modern technology we almost couldn’t carry out the various tasks that were involved in the project. The Sphinx itself, that’s not such a staggering feat. I mean if you get en ough sculptors to cut the stone away they could carve a statue a mile long. The technology was involved in taking the stones, quarrying the stones, to free the Sphinx from its bedrock and then in moving those st ones and using them to build the Valley Temple a couple of hundred feet away ...’ This was news to me: ‘You mean that the 200-ton blocks in the Valley Temple walls were quarried right out of the Sphinx enclosure?’ ‘Yes, no doubt about it. Geologically they’re from the identical member of rock. They were quarried out, moved over to the site of the Temple— God knows how—and erected into forty-foot-high walls—again God knows how. I’m talking about the huge limestone core blocks, not the granite facing. I think that the granite was added much later, quite possibly by Khafre. But if you look at the limestone core blocks you’ll see that they bear the marks of exactly the same kind of precipitation- induced weathering that are found on the Sphinx. So the Sphinx and the core structure of the Valley Temple were made at the same time by the same people—whoever they may have been.’ ‘And do you think that those people and the later dynastic Egyptians were connected to each other in some way? In Serpent in the Sky you suggested that a legacy mu st have been passed on.’ ‘It’s still just a suggestion. All that I know for sure on the basis of our work on the Sphinx is that a very, very high, sophisticated civilization capable of undertaking construction projects on a grand scale was present in Egypt in the very distant past. Then there was a lot of rain."},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 411 Then, thousands of years later, in th e same place, pharaonic civilization popped up already fully formed, appare ntly out of nowhere, with all its knowledge complete. That much we ca n be certain of. But whether or not the knowledge that Ancient Egypt possessed was the same as the knowledge that produced the Sphinx I really can’t say.’ ‘How about this,’ I speculated: ‘The civilization that produced the Sphinx wasn’t based here, at least not originally ... It wasn’t in Egypt. It put the Sphinx here as some sort of a marker or outpost ...’ ‘Perfectly possible. Could be that th e Sphinx for that civilization was like, let’s say, what Abu Simbel [i n Nubia] was for dynastic Egypt.’ ‘Then that civilization came to an end, was extinguished by some sort of massive catastrophe, and that’s when the legacy of high knowledge was handed on ... Because they had the Sphinx here they knew about Egypt, they knew this place, they knew this country, they had a connection here. Maybe people survived the ending of that civilization. Maybe they came here. ... Does that work for you?’ ‘Well, it’s a possibility. Again, go ing back into the mythologies and legends of the world, many of them te ll of such a catastrophe and of the few people—the Noah story that’s prevalent through endless civilizations—who somehow or other re tained and passed on knowledge. The big problem with all th is, from my point of vi ew, is the transmission process: how exactly the knowledge does get handed on during the thousands and thousands of years between the construction of the Sphinx and the flowering of dynastic Egypt. Theoretically you’re sort of stuck—aren’t you?—with this vast pe riod in which the knowledge has to be transmitted. This is not easy to slough off. On the other hand we do know that those legends we’re referring to were passed on word for word over countless generations. And in fact oral transmission is a much surer means of transmission than written transmission, because the language may change but as long as whoever’s telling the story tells it true in whatever the language of the time is ... it surfaces some 5000 years later in its original form. So maybe there are ways—in secret societies and religious cults, or through mytholog y, for example—that the knowledge could have been preserved and passed on before flowering again.

This realization first dawned in the late eighteenth century when the armies of revolutionary France, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, invaded Egypt. Bonaparte, who had cultivated a deep interest in the enigmas of the pyramids, br ought with him a large number of scholars, 175 in all, including several ‘greybeards’ gather ed from various universities who were reputed to have acquired ‘a profound knowledge of Egyptian antiquities’, and, more usefully, a group of mathematicians, cartographers and surveyors. 2 One of the tasks the savants were set, after the conquest was completed, was to draw up detailed maps of Egypt. In the process of doing this they discovered that the Great Pyramid was perfectly aligned to true north—and of course to the south, east and west as well, as we saw in Part VI. This meant that the mysterious structure made an excellent reference and triangulation point, an d a decision was therefore taken to use the meridian passing through its apex as the base-line for all other measurements and orientations. The te am then proceeded to produce the first accurate maps of Egypt drawn up in the modern age. When they had finished, they were intrigued to note that the Great Pyramid’s meridian sliced the Nile Delta region into two equal halves. They also found that if the diagonals running from the pyrami d’s apex to its north-eastern and north-western corners were extended (forming lines on the map running north-east and northwest until they reached the Mediterranean), the triangle thus formed would neatly encapsulate the entire Delta area. 3 Let us now return to our map, which also incorporates a triangle representing the Delta. Its other main components are the three parallel meridians. The eastern meridian is at longitude 32° 38’ east—the official eastern border of Ancient Egypt from the beginning of dynastic times. The western meridian is at longitud e 29° 50’ east, the official western border of ancient Egypt. The central me ridian is at longitude 31° 14’ east, exactly midway between the other two (1° 24’ away from each). 4 What we now have is a representation of a strip on the surface of planet earth that is exactly 2° 48’ wide.

Within this construct, the Great Pyramid appears to have been carefully sited as a geodetic marker for the apex of the Delta. The latter, which we have indicated on our map, is locate d at 30° 06’ N 31° 14’ E—a point in the middle of the Nile at the northern edge of modern Cairo.

This ‘error’, however, does not appear to have resulted from sloppiness or inaccuracy on the part of the pyramid builders. On the contrary, a cl ose look at the topography of the area suggests that the explanation should be sought in the need to find a site suitable for all the astronomical observations that had to be taken for accurate setting-out, and with a suffici ently stable geological structure on which to park, for ever, a six-million -ton monument almost 500 feet high with a footprint of over thirteen acres.

This was Egypt, the real organic Egypt of today and yesterday, which overlapped (but spread out far beyond) the strange ‘official’ Egypt of the map described, a rectangular fiction exactly seven terrestrial degrees in length. In the nineteenth century the renowned Egyptologist Ludwig Borchardt expressed what is still the conventional wisdom of his colleagues when he remarked, ‘One must absolutely exclude the possibility that the ancients may have measured by degrees.’ 7 This was a judgement that seemed increasingly unlikely to be tenable. Whoever they may have been, it was obvious that the original pl anners and architects of the Giza necropolis had belonged to a civiliz ation which knew the earth to be a sphere, knew its dimensions almost as well as we do ourselves, and had divided it into 360 degrees, just as we do today. The proof of this lay in the creation of a symbolic o fficial ‘country’ exactly seven terrestrial degrees in length, and in the admirably geodetic location and orientation to the card inal points of the Great Pyramid. Equally persuasive was the fact, already touched on in Chapter Twenty- three, that the perimeter of the pyramid’s base stood in the relationship 2 pi to its height and that the entire monument seemed to have been designed to serve as a map-projection— on a scale of 1:43,200—of the northern hemisphere of our planet: The Great Pyramid was a projection on four triangular surfaces. The apex represented the pole and the perimeter represented the equator. This is the reason why the perimeter is in relation 2 pi to the height. 8 The Pyramid/Earth ratio We have demonstrated the use of pi in the Pyramid 9 and need not go into this matter again; beside s, the existence of the pi relationship, though interpreted as accidental by orthodox scholars, is not contested by them. 10 But are we seriously supposed to accept that the monument could also be a representation of the northern hemisphere of the earth projected on flat surfaces at a scale of 1:43,200? Let us remind ourselves of the figures. According to the best modern estimates, based on satellite observations, the equatorial circum ference of the earth is 24,902.45 miles and its polar radi us is 3949 .921 miles. 11 The perimeter of the Great Pyramid’s base is 3023.16 feet an d its height is 481.3949 feet. 12 The  7 Cited in Ibid., p. 333. 8 See Chapter Twenty-three, and Stecchini in Secrets of the Great Pyramid, p. 378. 9 See Chapter Twenty-three. 10 Accepted, for example, by Edwards, Petrie, Baines and Malek, and so on. 11 Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1991, 27:530. 12 The Pyramids of Egypt, p. 87."},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 418 scaling-down, as it turns out, is not absolutely exact, but it is very near. Moreover, when we remember the bu lge at the earth’s equator (our planet being an oblate spheroid rather than a perfect sphere), the results achieved by the pyramid builders seem even closer to 1:43,200. How close? If we take the earth’s equatorial circumference, 24,902.45 miles, and scale it down (divide it) by 43,200 we get a result of 0.5764 of a mile. There are 5280 feet in a mile. The next step, therefore, is to multiply 0.5764 by 5280, which produces a fi gure of 3043.39 feet. The earth’s equatorial circumference scaled down 43,200 times is therefore 3,043.39 feet. By comparison, as we have seen, the perimeter of the Great Pyramid’s base is 3,023.16 feet. This represents an ‘error’ of only 20 feet—or about three-quarters of 1 per cent. Given the razor-sharp accuracy of the pyramid builders, however (who normally worked to even finer tolerances), the error is less likel y to have resulted from mistakes in the construction of the giant monument than in an underestimation of our planet’s true circumference by just 163 miles, probably caused in part by failure to take account of the equatorial bulge. Let us now consider the earth’s pola r radius of 3949.921 miles. If we scale it down 43,200 times we get 0.0914 of a mile: 482.59 feet. The earth’s polar radius scaled down 43 ,200 times is therefore 482.59 feet. By comparison the Great Pyramid’s height is 481.3949 feet—just a foot less than the ideal figure, an error of barely one-fifth of one per cent. As near as makes no difference, therefore, the perimeter of the Great Pyramid’s base is indeed 1:43,200 of the equatorial circumference of the earth. And as near as makes no difference, the height of the Great Pyramid above that base is indeed 1:43,200 of the pola r radius of the earth. In other words, during all the centuries of darkness experienced by Western civilization when knowledge of our planet’s dimensions was lost to us, all we ever needed to do to rediscover that knowledge was to measure the height and base perimete r of the Great Pyramid and multiply by 43,200! How likely is this to be an ‘accident’? The commonsense answer is ‘not very likely at all,’ since it should be obvious to any reasonable person that what we are looking at could only be the result of a deliberate and care fully calculated planning decision. Commonsense, however, ha s never been a faculty held in high esteem by Egyptologists, and it is therefore necessary to ask whether there is anything else in the data which might confirm that the ratio of 143,200 is a purposeful expression of intelligence and knowledge, rather than some numerical fluke. The ratio itself seems to provide that confirmation, for the simple reason that 43,200 is not a random number (like, say, 45,000 or 47,000, or 50,500, or 38,800). On the contrary it is one of a series of numbers, and multiples of those numbers, which relate to the phenomenon of"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 419 precession of the equinoxes, and which have become embedded in archaic myths all around the world. As the reader can confirm by glancing back at Part V the basic numerals of the Pyramid/Earth ratio crop up again and again in those myths, sometimes directly as 43,200 sometimes as 432, as 4320, as 432,000, as 4,320,000, and so on. What we appear to be confronted by are two remarkable propositions, back-to-back, as though designed to reinforce one another. It is surely remarkable enough that the Great Pyramid should be able to function as an accurate scale-model of the northern hemisphere of planet earth. But it is even more remarkable that the scale involved should incorporate numbers relating precisely to one of the key planetary mechanisms of the earth. This is the fixed and apparently eternal precession of its axis of rotation around the pole of the ecliptic, a phenomenon which causes the vernal point to migrate around the band of the zodiac at the rate of one degree every 72 years, and 30 degr ees (one complete zodiacal constellation) every 2160 years. Pr ecession through two zodiacal constellations, or 60 degrees al ong the ecliptic, takes 4320 years. 13 The constant repetition of these precessional numbers in ancient myths could, perhaps, be a coincidence. View ed in isolation, the appearance of the precessional number 43,200 in the pyramid/earth ratio might also be a coincidence (although the odds agains t this must be astronomical). But when we find precessional numbers in both these very different media— the ancient myths and the ancient monument—it really does strain credulity to suppose that coincidenc e is all that is involved here. Moreover, just as the Teutonic myth of Valhalla’s walls leads us to the precessional number 432,000 by inviting us to calculate the warriors who ‘go to war with the Wolf (500 plus 40 multiplied by 800, as saw in Chapter Thirty-three), so the Great Pyramid leads us to the precessional number 43,200 by demonstrating through the pi relationship that it might be a scale-model part of the earth and then by inviting us to calculate that scale.

Those maps, which made us e of spherical trigonometry and a range of sophisticated projections, had been claimed by Professor Charles Hapgood to provide tangible , documentary evidence that an advanced civilization with a comprehe nsive knowledge of the globe must have flourished during the last Ice Age. Now here was the Great Pyramid proving to have a ca rtographic function vis-à-vis the northern hemisphere and also incorporating a sophisti cated projection. As one expert explained: Each flat face of the Pyramid was designed to represent one curved quarter of the northern hemisphere, or spherical quadrant of 90 degrees. To project a spherical quadrant on to a flat triangle correctly, the arc, or base, of the quadrant must be the same length as the base of the triangle, and both must have the same height. This happens to be the case only with a cross-section or meridian bisection of the Great Pyramid, whose slope angle gives the pi relation between height and base ... 14 Was it possible that surviving copies and compilations of ancient maps— like the Piri Reis Map, for example—might in some cases go back to source documents produced by the same culture that skillfully incorporated its knowledge of the glob e into the dimensions of the Great Pyramid (and indeed into the carefully geometrized dimensions of Ancient Egypt itself)? I could hardly forget that Charle s Hapgood and his team had spent months trying to work out where the original projection of the Piri Reis Map had been centred. The answer they finally obtained was Egypt and specifically Seyne (Aswan) in upper Egypt 15 —where, as we have seen, an important astronomical observatory was situated at latitude 24° 06’ N, the official southern border. Needless to say, precise astronomic al observations would have been essential for calculations of the circum ference of the earth and of latitude positions. 16 But for how long before the historical period had the Ancient Egyptians and their ancestors been making such observations? And had they indeed learned this skill, as they stated forthrightly in their traditions, from the gods who had once walked among them? Navigators in the Boat of Millions of Years The god believed by the Ancient Egyptians to have taught the principles of astronomy to their ancestors was Thoth: ‘He who reckons in heaven,  14 Secrets of the Great Pyramid, p. 189. 15 Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings, p. 17ff. 16 See, for example, The Shape of the World, p. 23."},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 421 the counter of the stars, the enumer ator of the earth and of what is therein, and the measurer of the earth.’ 17 Normally depicted as a man wearing an ibis mask, Thoth was a leading member of the elite company of First Time deities who dominated religious life in Ancien t Egypt from the beginning to the end of its civilization. These were the great go ds, the Neteru. Although they were believed in one sense to be self-creat ed, it was also openly acknowledged and understood that they had a spec ial connection of some kind with another land—a fabulous and far-off country referred to in the ancient texts as Ta-Neteru, the ‘land of the gods’. 18 Ta-Neteru was thought to have had a definite earthly location a very long way south of Ancient Egypt—se as and oceans away—farther even than the spice country of Punt (which probably lay along East Africa’s Somali coast). 19 To confuse matters, however, Punt was also spoken of sometimes as the ‘Divine Land’, or ‘God’s Land’, and was the source of the sweet-smelling frankincense and myrrh especially favoured by the gods. 20 Another mythical paradise was also linked to the Neteru—an ‘abode of the blessed’, where the best of humans were sometimes taken—which was believed to be ‘situated away be yond a large expanse of water’. As Wallis Budge observed in his important study, Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection, ‘the Egyptians believed that this land could only be reached by means of a boat, or by the pers onal help of the gods who were thought to transport their favourites thither ...’ 21 Those lucky enough to gain entry would find themselves in a magical garden consisting of ‘islands, interconnected by canals f illed with running water which caused them to be always green and fertile’. 22 On the islands in this garden, ‘the wheat grew to a height of five cubits , the ears being two cubits long and the stalks three, and the barley grew to a height of seven cubits, the ears being three cubits long and the stalks four.’ 23 Was it from a land such as this,, superbly irrigated and scientifically farmed, that the agriculture bringer Os iris, whose title was ‘President of the Land of the South’, 24 had voyaged to Egypt at the dawn of the First  17 The Gods of the Egyptians, volume I, p. 400. 18 Ibid., volume I, p. 443; volume II, pp. 7, 287. 19 Ibid., volume II, p. 7, where the deity Amen -Ra is addressed in a hymn: ‘The gods love the smell of thee when thou comest from Punt, thou eldest-born of the dew, who comest from the Divine Land (Ta-Neteru).’ See also volume II, p. 287.

And was it from a land such as this, accessible only by boat, that ibis-masked Thoth had also made his way, crossing seas and oceans to deliver the priceless gifts of astronomy and earth-measurement to the primitive inhabitants of the prehistoric Nile Valley? Whatever the truth behind the trad ition, Thoth was remembered and revered by the Ancient Egyptians as the inventor of mathematics, astronomy and engineering. 25 ‘It was his will and power’, according to Wallis Budge, ‘that were believed to keep the forces of heaven and earth in equilibrium. It was his great skil l in celestial mathematics which made proper use of the laws upon which the foundation and maintenance of the universe rested.’ 26 Thoth was also credited wi th teaching the ancestral Egyptians the skills of geometry and land-surveying, medicine and botany. He was believed to have been the inventor ‘of figures, of the letters of the alphabet, and of the arts of reading and writing’. 27 He was the Great Lord of Magic’ 28 who could move objects with the power of his voice, ‘the author of every work on every branch of knowledge, both human and divine’. 29 It was to the teachings of Thoth—wh ich they guarded jealously in their temples and claimed to have been handed down from generation to generation in the form of forty-two books of instruction 30 —that the Ancient Egyptians ascribed their world-renowned wisdom and knowledge of the skies. This knowledge was sp oken of almost in awe, by the classical commentators who visite d Egypt from the fifth century BC onwards. Herodotus, the earliest of these travellers, noted: The Egyptians were the first to discover the solar year, and to portion out its course into twelve parts ... It was observat ion of the course of the stars which led them to adopt this division ... 31 Plato (fourth century BC ) reported that the Egyptians had observed the stars ‘for ten thousand years’. 32 And later, in the first century BC , Diodorus Siculus left this more detailed account: The positions and arrangements of the stars as well as their motions have always been the subject of careful observatio n among the Egyptians ... From ancient times to this day they have preserved th e records concerning each of these stars over an incredible number of years ... 33  25 Veronica Ions, Egyptian Mythology, Newnes Books, London, 1986, p. 84. 26 The Gods of the Egyptians, volume I, pp. 407-8. 27 Ibid., volume I, p. 414. 28 Egyptian Mythology, p. 85. 29 The Gods of the Egyptians, volume I, p. 414. 30 Ibid., pp 414-15. 31 The History, 2:4. 32 Reported in E.

Such detailed ob servations would not have been necessary if their only interest, as a number of scholars have seriously suggested, had been agricultural (the need to predict the seasons, which any country-born person can do). There must have been some other purpose. Moreover, how did the Ancient Egypti ans get started on astronomy in the first place? It is not an obvious hobby for a valley-d welling landlocked people to develop on their own initia tive. Perhaps we should take more seriously the explanation they themselves offer: that their ancestors were taught the study of the stars by a god. We might also pa y closer attention to the many unmistakably maritime references in the Pyramid Texts. 34 And there could be important new inferences to draw from ancient Egyptian religious art in which the go ds are shown travelling in beautiful, high-prowed, streamlined boats, buil t to the same advanced ocean-going specifications as the pyramid boats at Giza and the mysterious fleet moored in the desert sands at Abydos. Landlocked people do not as rule become astronomers; seafaring people do. Is it not possible that th e maritime iconography of the Ancient Egyptians, the design of their ships, and also their splendid obsession with observing the stars, could have been part of an inheritance passed on to their ancestors by an unidentified seafaring, navigating race, in remote prehistory? It is really only such an archaic race, such a forgotten maritime civilization, that could have left its fingerprints behind in the form of maps which accurately depict the world as it looked before the end of the last Ice Age. It is really only such a civilization, steering its course by the stars ‘for ten thousand years’ that could have observed and accurately timed the phenomenon of equinoctial precession with the exactitude attested in the ancient myth s. And, although hypothetical, it is only such a civilization that could ha ve measured the earth with sufficient precision to have arrived at the di mensions scaled down in the Great Pyramid. The signature of a distant date It was almost midnight by the time th at we reached Giza. We checked into the Siag, a hotel with an excellent pyramid view, and sat out on our balcony as the three stars of Orion’ s belt tracked slowly across the southern heavens. It was the disposition of these th ree stars, as archaeo-astronomer Robert Bauval had recently demonstrated, that served as the celestial  34 The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts, for example pp. 78, 170, 171, 290."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 424 template for the site-plan of the three Giza pyramids. This, in itself, was a remarkable discovery, suggesting a far higher level of observational astronomy, and of surveying and setting-out skills, than scholars had attributed to the Ancient Egyptians. Even more remarkable, however—and the reason that I had arranged to meet him at Giza the next morning— was Bauval’s contention that the pa ttern traced out on the ground (in almost fifteen million tons of perfec tly dressed stone) matched exactly the pattern in the sky during the epoch of 10,450 BC .

What absolutely excludes the possibility that this coul d be a coincidence is the fact that the scale involved is keyed in numerically to the rate of precession of the equinoxes—one of earth’s most characte ristic planetary mechanisms. It is therefore clear that we are confronted here by the manifestation of a deliberate planning decision: one intend ed to be recognizable as such by any culture which had acquired (a ) an accurate knowledge of the dimensions of the earth and (b) an accurate knowledge of the rate of precessional motion. Thanks to the work of Robert Bauval, we can now be certain that another deliberate planning decision was implemented in the Great Pyramid (which—it is increasingly apparent—must be understood as a device designed to fulfill many differ ent functions). In this case the plan was a truly ambitious one involving the Second and Third Pyramids as well, but it bears the fingerprints of the same ancient architects and builders who conceived of the Grea t Pyramid as a scale model of the earth. Their hallmark seems to have been precession—perhaps because they liked its mathematical regularity and predictability—and they used precession to devise a plan which coul d be understood properly only by a scientifically advanced culture. Ours is such a culture, and Robert Bauval is the first to have worked out the basic parameters of the plan—a discovery for which he has received public acclaim and will in due course , get the scientific recognition he deserves. 1 Belgian by nationality, born and brought up in Alexandria, he is tall, lean, clean-shaven, forty-someth ing, and going a little thin on top.

He has a first-class mind and is always restlessly accumulating and analysing new data relevant to his interests, finding new ways to look at old problems. In the process, entirely by accident, he ha s succeeded in transforming himself into a kind of magician of esoteric knowledge.  1 Robert Bauval’s The Orion Mystery (Heinemann, London; Crown, New York; Doubleday, Canada; List, Germany; Planeta, Spain; Pygmalion, France, etc.) was an international bestseller when it was published in 1994. Egyptologists closed ranks against its implications, which they refused to discuss, but many distinguished astronomers hailed Bauval’s findings as a breakthrough."},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 426 The Orion Mystery The roots of Bauval’s discoveries at Giza go back to the 1960s when the Egyptologist and architect Dr. Alexander Badawy and the American astronomer Virginia Trimble demonstrat ed that the southern shaft of the King’s Chamber in the Great Pyramid was targeted like a gun-barrel on the Belt of Orion during the Py ramid Age—around 2600 to 2400 BC . 2 Bauval decided to test the southern shaft of the Queen’s Chamber, which Badawy and Trimble had not investigated, an d established that it had been sighted on the star Sirius during the Pyramid Age. The evidence that proved this was provided by the German engineer Rudolf Gantenbrink as a result of measurements taken by his robot Upuaut in March 1993. This was the robot that had made the startling discovery of a closed portcullis door blocking the shaft at a distance of about 200 feet from the Queen’s Chamber. Equipp ed with a high-tech on-board clinometer, the little machine had also provided the first-ever completely accurate reading of the shaft’s angle of inclination: 39° 30’. 3 As Bauval explains: I did the calculations and these established that the shaft had been targeted on the meridian transit of Sirius around the epoch 2400 BC . There couldn’t be any doubt about it at all. I also recalculated the Orion’s Belt alignment worked out by Badawy and Trimble with new data that Gantenbrink gave me on the inclination of the southern shaft of the King’s Chamber. He’d measured that at 45 degrees exactly, whereas Badawy and Trimble had worked with Flinders Petrie’s slightly less accurate measurement of 44° 30’. The new data enabled me to refine Badawy’s and Trimble’s date for the alignment. What I found was that the shaft had been precisely targeted on Al Nitak, the lowest of the three belt stars, which crossed the meridian at altitude 45 degrees around the year 2475 BC . 4 Up to this point Bauval’s conclusions had been well within the chronological bounds set by orthodox Egyptologists, who normally dated the construction of the Great Pyramid to around 2520 BC . 5 If anything, the alignments the archaeo-astronomer had come up with suggested that the shafts had been built a little later, rather than earlier, than conventional wisdom allowed. As the reader is aware, however, Bauval had also made another discovery of an altogether more unsettling nature. Once again it involved the stars of Orion’s Belt: They’re slanted along a diagonal in a south-westerly direction relative to the axis of the Milky Way and the pyramids are slanted along a diagonal in a southwesterly direction relative to the axis of the Nile. If you look carefully on a clear night you’ll also see that the smallest of the three stars, the one at the top which the Arabs call Mintaka, is slightly offset to the east of the principal diagonal formed by the  2 Virginia Trimble, cited in The Orion Mystery, p. 241. 3 Ibid., p. 172. 4 Personal communications/interviews, 1993-4. 5 Atlas of Ancient Egypt, p. 36."},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 427 other two. This pattern is mimicked on the ground where we see that the Pyramid of Menkaure is offset by exactly the right amount to the east of the principal diagonal formed by the Pyramid of Khafre (which represents the middle star, Al Nilam) and the Great Pyramid, which represen ts Al Nitak. It’s really quite obvious that all these monuments were laid out ac cording to a unified site plan that was modelled with extraordinary precision on those three stars. ... What they did at Giza was to build Orion’s Belt on the ground.’ 6 There was more to come. Using a sophisticated computer programme 7 capable of plotting the precessionally induced changes in the declinations of all the stars visible in the sky over any part of the world in any epoch, Bauval found that the Pyramids/Orion ’s Belt correlation was general and obvious in all epochs, but specific and exact in only one: At 10,450 BC —and at that date only—we find that the pattern of the pyramids on the ground provides a perfect reflection of the pattern of the stars in the sky. I mean it’s a perfect match—faultless—and it cannot be an accident because the entire arrangement correctly depicts two very unusual celestial events that occurred only at that time. First, and pu rely by chance, the Milky Way, as visible from Giza in 10,450 BC , exactly duplicated the meridional course of the Nile Valley; secondly, to the west of the Milky Way, the three stars of Orion’s Belt were at the lowest altitude in their precessional cycle, with Al Nitak, the star represented by the Great Pyramid, crossing the meridian at 11° 08’. 8 Precession and the stars of Orion’s belt. The reader is already familiar with the way the earth’s axial precession causes sunrise on the vernal equinox to migrate along the band of the zodiac over a cycle of about 26,000 years.

As another 13,000 years pass, the belt stars very slowly rise again until Al Nitak is back at 58° 11’; then during the next 13,000 years they gradually fall once more to 11° 08’. This cycle is et ernal: 13,000 years up, 13,000 years down, 13,000 year s up, 13,000 years down, for ever. 9 It’s the precise configuration for 10,450 BC that we see on the Giza plateau—as though a master-architect came here in that epoch and decided to lay out a huge map on the ground using a mixture of natural and artificial features. He used the meridional course of the Nile Valley to depi ct the Milky Way, as it looked then. He built the three pyramids to represent the three stars, exactly as they looked then. And he put the three pyramids in exactly the same relationship to the Nile Valley as the three stars then had to the Milky Way. It was a very clever, very ambitious, very exact way to mark an epoch—to freeze a particular date into architecture if you like ... 10 The First Time I found the implications of the Orio n correlation complicated and eerie. On the one hand, the Great Pyramid’ s southern shafts ‘precessionally anchored’ the monument to Al Nitak and Sirius in 2475-2400 BC , dates which coincided comfortably with the epoch when Egyptologists said the monument had been built. On the other hand the disposition of all three of the pyramids in relation to the Nile Valley eloquently signalled the much earlier date of 10,450 BC . This coincided with the controversial geological findings John West and Robert Schoch had made at Giza, which suggested the presence of a high civilization in Egypt in the eleventh millennium BC . Moreover, the disposition of the pyramids had no t been arrived at by any random or accidental process but seemed to have been deliberately chosen because it marked a precessionally significant event: the lowest point, the beginning, the First Time in Or ion’s 13,000-year ‘up’ cycle. I knew that Bauval believed this as tronomical event to have been linked symbolically to the mythical First Ti me of Osiris—the time of the gods, when civilization had supposedly been brought into the Nile Valley—and that his reasoning for this derived from the mythology of Ancient Egypt which directly associated Osiris with the Orion constellation (and Isis with Sirius). 11 Had the historical archetypes for Osir is and Isis actually come here in  9 Skyglobe 3.6 10 Personal communications/interviews. 11 See Chapters Forty-two to Forty-four."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 429 the First Time, twelve and a half thousand years ago? 12 My research into Ice Age mythologies had persuaded me that certain ideas and memories could linger in the human psyche fo r many millennia, transmitted from generation to generation by oral tradition. I could therefore see no prima facie reasons why the Osirian mytholog y, with its strange and anomalous characteristics, should not have originated as far back as 10,450 BC . However, it was the civilization of dynastic Egypt that had elevated Osiris to the status of the high god of resurrection.

These were among the questions I planned to put to Robert Bauval in the shadow of the pyramids. Santha and I had arranged to meet him at dawn, at the Mortuary Temple of Khafre, so that the three of us could watch the sun come up over the Sphinx.  12 ‘The Egyptians ... believed that they were a divine nation, and that they were ruled by kings who were themselves gods incarnate; their earliest kings, they asserted, were actually gods, who did not disdain to live on earth, and to go about up and down through it, and to mingle with men.’ The Gods of the Egyptians, volume I, p. 3."},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 430 The pyramids and the belt stars of Orion at 10,450 BC , meridian view.

Here, at any rate, were the same enormous blocks, weighing 200 tons or more each. 13 And here too was the same in tangible atmosphere of vast antiquity and awakening intelligence, as though some epiphany might be at hand. Even in its present, much despoiled state, this anonymous structure, which Egyptologists had ca lled a Mortuary Temple, was still a place of power that seemed to draw its energy from an epoch far in the past. I looked up at the huge mass of the Second Pyramid’s eastern face just behind us in the pearl-grey dawn lig ht. Again, as John West had pointed out, there was much to suggest that it might have been built in two different stages. The lower courses, up to a height of perhaps thirty feet, consisted largely of cyclopean limestone megaliths like those in the temples. Above this height, howeve r, the remainder of the pyramid’s gigantic core had been formed out of much smaller blocks weighing around two to three tons each (like th e majority of the blocks in the Great Pyramid). Had there been a time when a twelve-acre, thirty-foot-high megalithic platform had stood here on the ‘hill of Giza’, west of the Sphinx, surrounded only by nameless square an d rectangular structures such as the Valley and Mortuary Temples? In ot her words, was it possible that the Second Pyramid’s lower courses might have been built first, before the other pyramids—perhaps long be fore, in a much earlier age? The cult That question was still on my mind when Robert Bauval arrived. After exchanging a few chilly pleasantries about the weather—a cold desert wind was blowing across the plateau— I asked him, ‘How do you account for the 8000-year gap in your correlations?’ ‘Gap?’ ‘Yes; shafts that seem to have been aligned in 2450 BC and a site-plan that maps star po sitions in 10,450 BC .’ ‘Actually, I see two explanations that both make some kind of sense,’ said Bauval, ‘and I think the answer has to be one or the other of these ... Either the pyramids were designed as a sort of “star-clock” to mark two particular epochs, 2450 and 10,450 BC , in which case we actually can’t say when they were built. Or they were built up over ...’ ‘Hang on with that first point,’ I interrupted. ‘How do you mean “star- clock”? How do you mean we can’t say when they were built?’ ‘Well, let’s assume for a moment that the pyramid builders knew  13 The Mortuary Temple was excavated by von Sieglin in 1910 and was found to consist of blocks of varying sizes weighing ‘between 100 and 300 tons’.

Let’s assume they were ab le to calculate the declination of particular star-groups backwards and forwards in time, just as we can today with computers ... Assuming they could do that then, no matter which epoch they lived in, they’d have been able to make a model of what the skies over Giza looked like in 10,450 BC or 2450 BC as required, just as we could. In other words, if they’d built the pyramids in 10,450 BC they would have had no difficulty in ca lculating the correct angles of inclination for the southern shafts so that they would be sighted on Al Nitak and Sirius around 2450 BC . Likewise, if they’d lived in 2450 BC they’d have had no difficulty in calculating the correct site-plan to reflect the position of Orion’s Belt in 10,450 BC . Agreed?’ ‘Agreed.’ ‘OK. That’s one explanation. But the second explanation, which I personally favour—and which I thin k the geological evidence also supports—is that the whole Giza necr opolis was develo ped and built up over an enormously long period of time. I think it’s more than possible that the site was originally pla nned and laid out at around 10,450 BC , so that its geometry would reflect the skies as they looked then, but that the work was completed, and the shafts of the Great Pyramid aligned, around 2450 BC .’ ‘So you’re saying that the ground-plan of the Pyramids could date back to 10,450 BC ? ‘I think it does. And I think that the geometrical centre of that plan was located more or less where we’re standing now, right in front of the Second Pyramid ...’ I pointed out the large blocks in the lower courses of the huge edifice: ‘It even looks like it was built in two stages, by two completely different cultures ...’ Bauval shrugged. ‘Let’s speculate ... Maybe it wasn’t two different cultures, Maybe it was one culture, or cult— the cult of Osiris, perhaps. Maybe it was a very long-lived, very an cient cult dedicated to Osiris that was here in 10,450 BC and was still here in 2450 BC . Maybe what happened was that some of the ways that this cult did things changed over time. Maybe they used huge blocks in 10,450 BC and smaller blocks in 2450 BC ... It seems to me there’s a lot here that supports this notion, a lot that says “very ancient cult”, a lot of evidence that has just never been investigated ...’ ‘For example?’ ‘Well, obviously the astronomical alignments of the site. I’ve been among the first to start looking into those properly. And the geology: the work that John West and Robert Scho ch have been involved in at the Sphinx. Here are two sciences—both hard, empirical, evidence-driven sciences—that have never been applied to these problems before. But now that we have started to apply them, we’re beginning to get a whole new reading on the antiquity of the ne cropolis. And I honestly think we’ve"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 433 just scratched the surface and that much more will emerge from the geology and the astronomy in the futu re. In addition, nobody’s yet made a really detailed study of the Pyramid Texts from anything other than the so-called “anthropological” perspective, which means a preconceived notion that the priests of Heliopolis were a bunch of ha lf-civilized witch- doctors who wanted to live for ever ... Actually they did want to live for ever but they certainly weren’t witch-do ctors ... They were highly civilized, highly initiated men and they were, in their ow n fashion, scientists, as we can judge from their works. Therefore I suggest that it’s as scientific or at least quasi-scientific documents that the Pyramid Texts need to be read, not as mumbo-jumbo. I’m already satisfied that they respond to precessional astronomy. There may be other keys too: mathematics, geometry—particularly geometry ... Sy mbolism ... What’s needed is a multi-disciplinary approach to unde rstanding the Pyramid Texts ... and to understanding the pyramids themselves. Astronomers, mathematicians, geologists, engineers, architects, ev en philosophers to deal with the symbolism—everybody who can bring a fr esh eye and fresh skills to bear on these very important problems should be encouraged to do so.’ ‘Why do you feel the problems are so important?’ ‘Because they have a colossal bearing on our understanding of the past of our own species. The very careful, very precise site-planning and setting-out that appears to have been done here in 10,450 BC could only have been the work of a highly-evolved, probably technological civilization. ...’ ‘Whereas no such civilization is su pposed to have existed anywhere on earth in that epoch ...’ ‘Exactly. It was the Stone Age. Hu man society was supposed to have been at a very primitive level, with our ancestors wearing skins, sheltering in caves, fo llowing a hunting-gathering way of life and so on and so forth. So its rather unsettling to discover that civilized people seem to have been present in Giza in 10,450 BC , who understood the obscure science of precession extremely well, who had the technical capacity to work out that they were witnessing the lowest point in Orion’s precessional cycle—and thus the beginning of the constellation’s 13,000 year upwards journey—and who set out to create a permanent memorial of that moment here on the plateau. By putting Orion’s Belt on the ground in the way they did they knew that they were freezing a very specific moment in time.’ A perverse thought occurred to me: ‘H ow can we be so sure that the moment that they were freezing was 10,450 BC ? After all, Orion’s Belt takes up that same configuration in the southern sky, west of the Milky Way at 11-plus degrees above the ho rizon, once every 26,000 years. So why shouldn’t they have been immortalizing 36,450 BC or even the precessional cycle that began 26,000 years before that?’ Robert was clearly ready for this question. ‘Some ancient records do"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 434 suggest that Egyptian civilization had roots going back almost 40,000 years,’ he mused, ‘like that strange report in Herodotus that talks about the sun rising where it once set and setting where it once rose ...’ ‘Which is also a precessional metaphor ...’ ‘Yes. Precession again. Most peculia r the way it always keeps cropping up ... At any rate, you’re right, they could have been marking the beginning of the previous precessional cycle ...’ ‘But do you think they were?’ ‘No. I think 10,450 BC is the more likely date. It ’s more within the range of what we know ab out the evolution of homo sapiens. And although it still leaves a lot of years to accoun t for before the sudden emergence of dynastic Egypt around 3000 BC , it isn’t too long a period ...’ ‘Too long a period for what?’ ‘It’s the answer to your question about the 8000-year gap between the alignment of the site and the alignment of the shafts. Eight thousand years is a very long time but it is n’t too long for a dedicated highly motivated cult to have preserved and nurtured and faithfully passed on the high-knowledge of the people who invented this place in 10,450 BC .’ 14 The machine How high was the knowledge of those prehistoric inventors? ‘They knew their epochs,’ said Bauval, ‘and the clock that they used was the natural clock of the stars. Thei r working language was precessional astronomy and these monuments express that language in a very clear, unambiguous, scientific manner. They were also highly skilled surveyors—I mean the people who orig inally prepared the site and laid  14 Just as any great Christian cathedral, however modern (for example the twentieth- century gothic cathedral on Nob Hill in San Francisco), expresses the thinking, symbolism and iconography of the Judaeo-Chris tian ‘cult’ which has roots at least 4000 years old, it should not be impossible to imagine a cult enduring for 8000 years in Ancient Egypt and thus linking the epoch of 10450 BC to 2,450 BC . The completion of the pyramids at that time, like the completion of a cathedral today, would therefore have resulted in structures that expressed extremely old ideas. Plentiful evidence exists within Ancient Egyptian tradition which seems to attest to the existence and preservation of such ancient ideas. For example, ‘King Nefer-hetep [XIIIth Dynasty] was a loyal worshipper of Osiris and hearing that his Temple [at Abydos] was in ruins, and that a new statue of the god was required, he went to the temple of Ra-Atum at Heliopolis, and consulted the books in the library there, so that he might learn how to make a statue of Osiris which should be like that which had existed in the beginning of the world ...’ (Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection, volume II, p. 14). Also Sacred Science; pp. 103-4, explains that the construction of temples in the Ptolemaic and late periods of Egyptian history continued to obey very ancient specifications: ‘All the plans always refer to a divine book; thus the temple of Edfu was rebuilt under the Ptolemies according to the book of foundation composed by Imhotep, a book descended from heaven to the north of Memphis. The temple of Dendera followed a plan recorded in ancient writings dating from the Companions of Horus .’"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 435 out the orientations for the pyramids—because they worked to an exacting geometry and because they knew how to align the base- platforms, or whatever it was they bu ilt, perfectly to the cardinal points.’ ‘Do you think they also knew that they were marking out the site of the Great Pyramid on latitude 30° North?’ Bauval laughed: I’m certain they kn ew. I think they knew everything about the shape of the earth. They knew their astronomy. They had a good understanding of the solar system and of celestial mechanics. They were also incredibly accurate and in credibly precise in everything they did. So, all in all, I don’t think anything really happened here by chance— at least not between 10,450 and 2450 BC . I get the feeling that everything was planned, intended, carefully work ed out ... Indeed I get the feeling that they were fulfilling a lo ng-term objective—some kind of purpose, if you like, and that they brought this to fruition in the third millennium BC ... ‘In the form of the fully built pyramids which they then precessionally anchored to Al Nitak and to Sirius at the time of completion?’ ‘Yes. And also, I think, in the form of the Pyramid Texts. My guess is that the Pyramid Texts are part of the puzzle.’ ‘The software to the Pyramids’ hardware?’ ‘Quite possibly. Why not? At any rate it’s certain that there’s a connection. I think what it means is that if we’re going to decode the pyramids properly then we’re go ing to have to use the Texts ...’ ‘What’s your guess?’ I asked Bauval. ‘What do you think the purpose of the pyramid builders really might have been?’ ‘They didn’t do it because they wanted an eternal tomb,’ he replied firmly. ‘In my view, they had no doubts at all that they would eternally live. They did it—whoever did it—they have transmitted the power of their ideas through something that is to a ll intents and purposes eternal. They succeeded in creating a force that is functional in itself, provided you understand it, and that force is the questions it challenges you to ask. My guess is that they knew the human mind to perfection. They knew the game of ritual ... Right? I’m serious. They knew what they were doing. They knew that they could initiate people far ahead in the future into their way of thinking even though they couldn’t be there themselves. They knew that they could do this by creating an eternal machine, the function of which was to generate questions.’ I suppose that I must have looked puzzled. ‘The machine is the pyramids!’ Bauval exclaimed, ‘the whole of the Giza necropolis really. And look at us. What are we doing? We’re asking questions. We’re standing out here, shivering, at an ungodly hour, watching the sun come up, and we’re asking questions, lots and lots of questions just as we’ve been programmed to do.

They were sowing the seed. Be lieve me, they were magicians, and they knew the power of ideas ... They knew how to set ideas growing and developing in people’s minds. And if you start with such ideas, and follow the process of reasoning like I did, yo u arrive at things like Orion, and 10,450 BC . In short, this is a process th at works on its own.

It involves you whether you like it or not ... It forces you into a process of thinking ... forces you to learn. The minute you ask a question about it you’ve asked a question about engineering, you’ve asked a question about geometry, you’ve asked a question about astronomy. So it forces you to learn about engineering and geometry and astronomy, and gradually you begin to realize how sophisticated it is, how incredibly clever and skilful an d knowledgeable its builders must have been, which forces you to ask questions about mankind, about human history, eventually about yourself too.

This is the power of the thing.’ The second signature As Robert, Santha and I sat out on th e Giza plateau that cold December morning at the end of 1993, we watc hed the winter sun, now very close to solstice, rising over the right shoulder of the Sphinx, almost as far south of east as it would travel on its yearly journey before turning north again. The Sphinx was an equinoctial marker , with its gaze directed precisely at the point of sunrise on the vernal eq uinox. Was it, too, part of the Giza ‘grand plan’? I reminded myself that in any epoch, and at any period of history or prehistory, the Sphinx’s due east gaze would always have been sighted on the equinoctial rising of the sun, at both the vernal and the autumnal"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 437 equinoxes. As the reader will recall from Part V, however, it was the vernal equinox that was considered by ancient man to be the marker of the astronomical age. In the words of Santillana and von Dechend: The constellation that rose in the east, just before the sun, marked the ‘place’ where the sun rested ... It was known as the sun’s ‘carrier’ and the vernal equinox was recognised as the fiducial point of the ‘system’ determining the first degree of the sun’s yearly cycle ...’ 15 Why should an equinoctial marker have been made in the shape of a giant lion? In our own lifetimes, the epoch of AD 2000, a more suitable shape for such a marker—should anyone wi sh to build one—would be a representation of a fish. This is because the sun on the vernal equinox rises against the stellar background of Pisces, as it has done for approximately the last 2000 years. Th e astronomical Age of Pisces began around the time of Christ. 16 Readers must judge for themselves whether it is a coincidence that the principal sy mbol used for Christ by the very early Christians was not the cross but the fish. 17 During the preceding age, which broadly-speaking encompassed the first and second millennia BC , it was the constellation of Aries—the Ram— which had the honour of carrying the sun on the vernal equinox. Again, readers must judge whether it is a coincidence that the religious iconography of that epoch was predominantly ram-oriented. 18 Is it a coincidence, for example, that Yahweh, God of Old Testament Israel, provided a ram as a substitute for Ab raham’s offered sacrifice of his son Isaac? 19 (Abraham and Isaac are assume d by biblical scholars and archaeologists to have lived duri ng the early seco nd millennium BC 20 ). Is it likewise coincidental that rams, in on e context or another, are referred to in almost every book of the Old Test ament (entirely composed during the Age of Aries) but in not a sing le book of the New Testament? 21 And is it an accident that the advent of the Age of Aries, shortly before the beginning of the second millennium BC , was accompanied in Ancient Egypt by an upsurge in the worship of the god Amon wh ose symbol was a ram with curled horns? 22 Work on the principal sanctuary of Amon—the Temple of Karnak at Luxor in u pper Egypt—was begun at around 2000 BC 23 and, as those who have visited th at temple will reca ll, its principal icons are rams, long rows of which guard its entrances. The immediate predecessor to the Age of Aries was the Age of Taurus—  15 Hamlet’s Mill, p. 59. 16 Ibid.; Sacred Science, p. 179. 17 Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, Oxford University Press, 1988, p. 514. 18 Sacred Science, p. 177. 19 Genesis: 22:13 20 Jerusalem Bible, chronological table, p. 343. 21 King James Bible, Franklin, Computerized First Edition. 22 The Encyclopaedia of Ancient Egypt, p. 20. 23 Ibid., p. 133."},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 438 the Bull—which spanned the period between 4380 and 2200 BC . 24 It was during this precessional epoch, when the sun on the vernal equinox rose in the constellation of Taurus, that the Bull-cult of Minoan Crete flourished. 25 And during this epoch, too, the civilization of dynastic Egypt burst upon the historical scene, fully formed, apparently without antecedents. Readers must judge wh ether it is a coincidence that Egyptians at the very beginning of the dynastic period were already venerating the Apis and Mnevis Bulls—the former being considered a theophany of the god Osiris and the latter, the sacred animal of Heliopolis, a theophany of the god Ra. 26 Why should an equinoctial marker ha ve been made in the form of a lion? I looked down the slope of the Giza plateau towards the great leonine body of the Sphinx. Khafre, the Fourth Dynasty pharaoh believed by Egyptologists to have carved the monument ou t of bedrock around 2500 BC , had been a monarch of the Age of Taurus. For al most 1800 years before his reign, and more than 300 years after it, th e sun on the vern al equinox rose unfailingly in the constellation of the Bull. It follows that if a monarch at such a time had set out to create an equinoctial marker at Giza, he would have had every reason to have it carved in the form of a bull, and none whatsoever to have it carved in the form of a lion. Indeed, and it was obvious, there was only one epoch when the celestial symbolism of a leonine equinoctial marker would have been appropriate. That epoch was, of course, the Age of Le o, from 10,970 to 8810 BC . 27 Why, therefore, should an equinoctial marker have been made in the shape of a lion? Because it was made during the Age of Leo when the sun on the vernal equinox rose against the stellar background of the constellation of the Lion, thus markin g the coordinates of a precessional epoch that would not experience its ‘Great Return’ for another 26,000 years. Around 10,450 BC the three stars of Orion’s Belt reached the lowest point in their precessional cycle: west of the Milky Way, 11° 08’ above the southern horizon at meridian transit. On the ground west of the Nile, this event was frozen into architecture in the shape of the three pyramids of Giza. Their layout formed the signature of an unmistakable epoch of precessional time. Around 10,450 BC , the sun on the vernal equinox rose in the constellation of Leo. On the ground at Giza, this event was frozen into architecture in the shape of the Sphinx, a gigantic, leonine, equinoctial marker which, like the second signature on an official document, could  24 Sacred Science , p. 177. 25 As early as 3000 BC .

At that stage I hadn’t yet be gun to put the pieces of the puzzle together and I was working more on hunches than on hard evidence. I was captivated by all the mysteries, anomalies, anachronisms and puzzles, and wanted to learn as much about them as I could. My researcher, meanwhile, had been lookin g into the long, slow processes by which some known civilizations had come into global history. It transpired that, in his opinion, certain significant economic, climatic, topographical and geographical prec onditions had to be met before a civilization could evolve: So if you are looking for a hitherto undi scovered civilization of great originators who made it on their own, separate from any of the ones we already know, you are not looking for a needle in a haystack. You are looking for something more like a city in its hinterland. What you are looking for is a vast region which occupied a land area at least a couple of thousand miles across. This is a landmass as big as the Gulf of Mexico, or twice the size of Madagascar. It would have had major mountain ranges, huge river systems and a Mediterranean to sub-tropical climate which was buffered by its latitude from the adverse effects of short-term climatic cooling. It would have needed this relatively undisturbed climate to last for around ten thousand years ... Then the population of several hundred thousand sophisticated people, we are to believe, suddenly vanished, together with their homeland, leaving very little physical trac e, with only a few surviving individuals who were shrewd enough to see the end coming, wealthy enough and in the right place, with the resources they needed to be able to do something about escaping the cataclysm. So there I was without a researcher. My proposition was a priori impossible. There could be no lost advanced civilization because a landmass big enough to support such a civilization was too big to lose. Geophysical impossibilities The problem was a serious one and it co ntinued to nag at the back of my mind all the way through my own research and travels. It was, indeed, this exact problem, more than any other, which had scuppered Plato’s Atlantis as a serious proposition for scholars. As one critic of the lost continent theory put it: There never was an Atlantic landbridge since the arrival of man in the world; there is no sunken landmass in the Atlantic: the Atlantic Ocean must have existed in its present form for at least a million years. In fact it is a geophysical impossibility for"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 443 an Atlantis of Plato’s dimensions to have existed in the Atlantic ... 1 The adamant and assertive tone, I ha d long ago learnt, was entirely justified. Modern oceanographers ha d thoroughly mapped the floor of the Atlantic Ocean and there was defi nitely no lost continent lurking there. But if the evidence that I was gather ing did represent the fingerprints of a vanished civilization, a continent had to have got lost somewhere, So where? For a while I used the obvious working hypothesis that it might be under some other ocean. The Pacific was very big but the Indian Ocean looked more promising because it was located relatively close to the Middle East’s Fertile Crescent, where several of the earliest known historical civilizations had emerge d with extreme suddenness at around 3000 BC . I had plans to go chasing rumours of ancient pyramids in the Maldive Islands and along the Somali coas t of East Africa to see if I could pick up any clues of a lost paradise of antiquity. I thought I might even work in a trip to the Seychelles. The problem was the oceanographers again. The floor of the Indian Ocean, too, had been mapped and it didn’t conceal any lost continents. Ditto every other ocean and every other sea. There seemed to be nowhere now under water into which a landmass big enough to have nurtured a high civilization could have vanished. Yet, as my research continued, the evidence kept mounting that precisely such a civilization had once existed. I began to suspect that it must have been a maritime civilization: a nation of navigators. In support of this hypothesis, among other anom alies, were the remarkable ancient maps of the world, the ‘Pyramid Boats’ of Egypt, the traces of advanced astronomical knowledge in the astonishing calendar system of the Maya, and the legends of seafaring gods like Quetzalcoatl and Viracocha. A nation of navigators, then. And a na tion of builders, too: Tiahuanaco builders, Teotihuacan builders, py ramid builders, Sp hinx builders, builders who could lift and position 200-ton blocks of limestone with apparent ease, builders who could alig n vast monuments to the cardinal points with uncanny accuracy. Whoever they were, these builders appeared to have left their characteristic fingerprints all over the world in the form of cyclopean polygonal masonry, site layouts involving astronomical alignments, mathematical and geodetic puzzles, and myths about gods in human form. But a civi lization advanced enough to build like that—rich enough, sufficiently well organized and mature to have explored and mapped the wo rld from pole to pole, a civilization smart enough to have calculated the dime nsions of the earth—simply could not have evolved on an insignifican t landmass. Its homeland, as my researcher had rightly pointed out, must have been blessed with major mountain ranges, huge river systems and a congenial climate, and with  1 Galanopoulos and Bacon, Lost Atlantis, p. 75."},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 444 many other obvious environmental prerequisites for the development of an advanced and prosperous economy: good agricultural lands, mineral resources, forests, and so on. So where could such a landmass have been located, if not under any of the world’s oceans? Library angels Where could it have been located and when might it have disappeared? And if it had disappeared (and no other explanation would do) then how, why, and under what circumstances? Seriously, how do you lose a continent? Commonsense suggested that the answ er had to lie in a cataclysm of some kind, a planetary disaster capable of wiping out almost all physical traces of a large civilization. But if so, why were there no records of such a cataclysm? Or perhaps there were. As my research progressed I studied many of the great myths of flood, fire, earthquakes and ice handed down from generation to generation around the world. We saw in Part IV that it was difficult to resist the conclusion that the myths were describing real geological and climatic events, quite possibly the different local effects of the same events in all cases. During the short history of mankind’ s presence on this planet, I found that there was only one known and documented catastrophe that fitted the bill: the dramatic and deadly me ltdown of the last Ice Age between 15000 and 8000 BC . Moreover, as was more obviously the case with architectural relics like Teotihuacan and the Egyptian pyramids, many of the relevant myths appeared to have been designed to serve as vehicles for encrypted scientific information, again an indication of what I was coming to think of as ‘the fingerprints of the gods’. What I had become sensitized to, although I did not properly realize its implications at the time, was the possibility that a strong connection might exist between the collapsing chaos of the Ice Age and the disappearance of an archaic civilization which had been the stuff of legend for millennia. It was at this moment exactly that the library angels intervened ... The missing piece of the puzzle The novelist Arthur Koestler, who had a great interest in synchronicity, coined the term ‘library angel’ to describe the unknown agency responsible for the lucky breaks rese archers sometimes get which lead to exactly the right information being placed in their hands at exactly the"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 445 right moment. 2 At exactly the right moment, one of those lucky breaks came my way. The moment was the summer of 1993. I was at a low ebb physically and spiritually after months of hard trav el, and the geophysical impossibility of actually losing a continent-sized landmass was beginning to undermine my confidence in the strength of my fi ndings. It was then that I received a letter from the town of Nanaimo in British Columbia, Canada. The letter referred to my previous book The Sign and the Seal, in which I had made passing mention of the Atlantis theo ry and of traditions of civilizing heroes who had been ‘saved from water’: 19 July 1993 Dear Mr. Hancock, After 17 years of research into the fate of Atlantis, my wife and I have finished a manuscript entitled When the Sky Fell. Our frustration is that despite positive feedback about the book’s approach from the few publishers who have seen it, the mere mention of Atlantis closes minds. 3 In The Sign and the Seal you write of ‘a tradition of secret wisdom started by the survivors of a flood ...’ Our work explores sites where some survivors might have relocated. High altitude, fresh-water lakes made ideal post-deluge bases for the survivors of Atlantis. Lake Titicaca and Lake Tana [in Ethiopia, where much of The Sign and the Seal was set] fit the climatic criteria. Their stable environment provided the raw materials for restarting agriculture. We have taken the liberty of enclosing an outline of When the Sky Fell. If you are interested we will be pleased to send you a copy of the manuscript. Sincerely, Rand Flem-Ath I turned to the enclosure and there, in the first few paragraphs, found the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle I had been looking for. It meshed perfectly with the ancient global maps I had studied—maps which accurately depicted the subglacial topography of the continent of Antarctica (see Part I). It made perf ect sense of all th e great worldwide myths of cataclysm and planetary disa ster, with their differing climatic effects. It explained the enigma of the huge numbers of apparently ‘flash- frozen’ mammoths in northern Siberia and Alaska, and the 90-foot tall fruit trees locked in the permafrost deep inside the Arctic Circle at a latitude where nothing now grows. It provided a solution to the problem of the extreme suddenness with which the last Ice Age in the northern hemisphere melted down after 15,000 BC . It also solved the mystery of the exceptional worldwide volcanic activity that accompanied the meltdown. It answered the question, ‘How do you lose a continent?’ And it was solidly based in Charles Hapgood’s theory of ‘earth-crust displacement’—a radical geological hy pothesis with which I was already familiar:  2 See, for example, Brian Inglis, Coincidence, Hutchinson, London, 1990, p. 48ff. 3 When the Sky Fell, with an Introduction by Colin Wilson and Afterword by John Anthony West, is published by Stoddart, Canada, 1995."},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 446 Antarctica is our least understood continent [wrote the Flem-Aths in their outline]. Most of us assume that this immense island has been ice-bound for millions of years. But new discoveries prove that pa rts of Antarctica were free of ice thousands of years ago, recent history by the geological clock. The theory of ‘earth-crust displacement’ explains the mysterious surge and ebb of Antarctica’s vast ice sheet. What the Canadian researchers were referring to was Hapgood’s suggestion that until the end of th e last Ice Age—say the eleventh millennium BC —the landmass of Antarctica had been positioned some 2000 miles further north (at a congenia l and temperate latitude) and that it had been moved to its present positi on inside the Antarctic Circle as a result of a massive displacement of the earth’s crust. 4 This displacement, the Flem-Aths continued, had also left other evidence of its deadly visi t in a ring of death around the globe. All the continents that experienced rapid and massive extinctions of animal species (notably the Americas and Siberia) underwent a massive change in their latitudes ... The consequences of a displacement are monumental. The earth’s crust ripples over its interior and the world is shaken by incredible quakes and floods. The sky appears to fall as continents groan and shift position. Deep in the ocean, earthquakes generate massive tidal waves which crash against coastlines, flooding them. Some lands shift to warmer climes, while others, propelled into polar zones, suffer the direst of winters. Melting ice caps raise the ocean’s level higher and higher. All living things must adapt, migrate or die ... If the horror of an earth-crust displacement were to be visited upon today’s interdependent world the progress of thousands of years of civilization would be torn away from our planet like a fine cobweb. Those who live near high mountains might escape the global tidal waves, but they would be forced to leave behind, in the lowlands, the slowly constructed fr uits of civilization. Only among the merchant marine and navies of the world might some evidence of civilization remain. The rusting hulls of ships and submarines would eventually perish but the valuable maps that are housed in them would be saved by survivors, perhaps for hundreds, even thousands of years. Until once again mankind could use them to sail the World Ocean in search of lost lands ... As I read these words I remembered Charles Hapgood’s account of how the layer of the earth that geologis ts call the lithosphere—the thin but rigid outer crust of the planet—could at times be displaced, moving in one piece ‘over the soft inner body, much as the skin of an orange, if it were loose, might shift over the inner part of the orange all in one piece.’ 5 Thus far, I felt I was on familiar ground. But then the Canadian researchers made two vital co nnections which I had missed.  4 See Part I. 5 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 447 Section through the earth. The crustal displacement theory envisages the possibility of periodic displacements of the entire crust in one piece. Often less than 30 miles thi ck, the crust rests on a lubricating layer known as the asthenosphere. Gravitational influences The first of these was the possibility that gravitational influences (as well as the variations in the earth’s orbital geometry discussed in Part V) might, through the mechanism of earth- crust displacement, play a role in the onset and decline of Ice Ages: When the naturalist and geologist Louis Agassiz presented the idea of ice ages to the scientific community in 1837 he was met with great skepticism. However, as evidence slowly gathered in his favour, the skeptics were forced to accept that the earth had indeed been gripped by deadly winters. But the trigger of these paralysing ice ages remained a puzzle. It was not until 1976 that solid evidence existed to establish the timing of ice ages. The explanation was found in various astronomical features of the earth’s orbit and the tilt of the axis. Astronomical factors have clearly played a role in the timing of glacial epochs. But this is only part of the problem. Of equal importance is the geography of glaciation. It is here that the theory of earth-crust displace ment plays its role in unravelling the"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 448 mystery. Albert Einstein investigated the possibilit y that the weight of the ice-caps, which are not symmetrically distributed about the pole, might cause such a displacement. Einstein wrote: ‘The earth’ s rotation acts on these unsymmetrically deposited masses, and produces centrifugal momentum that is transmitted to the rigid crust of the earth. The constantly increasing centrifugal momentum produced this way will, when it reaches a certain point, produce a movement of the earth’s crust over the earth’s body, and this will displace the polar regions towards the equator. When Einstein wrote these words [1953] th e astronomical causes of ice ages were not fully appreciated. When the shape of the earth’s orbit deviates from a perfect circle by more than one per cent, the gravitational influence of the sun increases, exercising more pull on the planet and its massive ice sheets. Their ponderous weight pushes against the crust and this immense pressure, combined with the greater incline in the earth’s tilt [another changing factor of the orbital geometry] forces the crust to shift ... The connection with the onse t and decline of ice ages? Very straightforward. In a displacement, those parts of the earth’s crust which are situated at the North and South Poles (and wh ich are therefore as completely glaciated as Antarctica is today) shif t suddenly into warmer latitudes and begin to melt with extraordinary rapidity. Conversely, land that has hitherto been located at warmer latitudes is shifted equally suddenly into the polar zones, suffers a devastating climate change, and begins to vanish under a rapidly expanding ice-cap. In other words, when huge parts of northern Europe and north America were heavily glaciated in what we think of as the last Ice Age, it was not because of some mysterious slow-a cting climatic factor, but rather because those areas of land were then situated much closer to the North Pole than they are today. Simila rly, when the Wi sconsin and Wurm glaciations described in Part IV began to go into their meltdown at around 15,000 BC the trigger was not global climate change but a shift of the ice-caps into warmer latitudes ... In other words: there is an Ice Age going on right now—inside the Arctic Circle and in Antarctica. The lost continent The second connection the Flem-Aths made followed logically from the first: if there was such a recurrent, cyclical geological phenomenon as earth-crust displacement, and if the last displacement had shifted the enormous landmass we call Antarctica out of temperate latitudes and into the Antarctic Circle, it was possible th at the substantial remains of a lost civilization of remote antiquity might today be lying under two miles of ice at the South Pole."},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 449 It was suddenly clear to me how a continent-sized landmass, which had been the home of a large and prospero us society for thousands of years, could indeed get lost almost without trace. As the Flem-Aths concluded: ‘It is to icy Antarctica that we look to find answers to the very roots of civilization—answers which may yet be preserved in the frozen depths of the forgotten island continent.’ I hauled out my researcher’s resi gnation letter from the files and started to check off his preconditions for the emergence of an advanced civilization. He wanted ‘major mountain ranges’. He wanted ‘huge river systems’. He wanted ‘a va st region which occupied a land area at least a couple of thousand miles across’. He also wanted a stable, congenial climate for ten thousand years, to allow time for a developed culture to evolve. Antarctica is by no means a needle in a haystack. It’s a huge landmass, much, much bigger than the Gulf of Mexico, about seven times larger than Madagascar—indeed roughly the size of the continental USA. Moreover, as seismic surveys have demonstrated, there are major mountain ranges in Antarctica. And as several of the ancient maps seem to prove, unknown prehistoric cartographers, who possessed a scientific understanding of latitude and longitud e, depicted these mountain ranges before they disappeared beneath the ice-cap that covers them today. These same ancient maps also show ‘huge river system s’ flowing down from the mountains, watering the ex tensive valleys and plains below and running into the surrounding ocean. And these rivers, as I already knew from the Ross Sea cores, 6 had left physical evidence of their presence in the composition of ocean bottom sediments. Last but not least, I noted that the earth-crust displacement theory did not conflict with the requirement for 10 ,000 years of stable climate. Prior to the supposed sudden shift of the crust, at around the end of the last Ice Age in the northern hemisphere, the climate of Antarctica would have been stable, perhaps for a great deal longer than 10,000 years. And if the theory was right in suggesting that Antarctica’s latitude in that epoch had been about 2000 miles (30 degrees of ar c) further north than it is today, the northernmost parts of it would have been situated in the vicinity of latitude 30° South and would, indeed , have enjoyed a Mediterranean to sub-tropical climate. Had the earth’s crust really shifted? And could the ruins of a lost civilization really lie beneath the ice of the southern continent? As we see in the following chapters , it might have ... and they could.  6 Ibid.

As noted, this geological theory was formulated by Professor Charles Hapgood and supported by Al bert Einstein. In brief, what it suggests is a complete slippage of our planet’s th irty-mile-thick lithosphere over its nearly 8000-mile-thick central core, forcing large parts of the western hemisphere southward towards the equator and thence towards the Antarctic Circle. This movement is no t seen as taking place along a due north-south meridian but on a swivelling course—pivoting, as it were, around the central plains of what is now the United States. The result is that the north-eastern segment of North America (in which the North Pole was formerly located in Hudson’s Bay) is dragged southwards out of the Arctic Circle and into more temperate latitudes while at the same time the north-western segment (Alaska and th e Yukon) swivels northwards into the Arctic Circle along with la rge parts of northern Siberia. In the southern hemisphere, Hapgood’s model shows the landmass that we now call Antarctica, much of whic h was previously at temperate or even warm latitudes, being shifted in its entirety inside the Antarctic Circle. The overall movement is seen as having been in the region of 30 degrees (approximately 2000 miles) and as having been concentrated, in the main, between the years 14,500 BC and 12,500 BC —but with massive aftershocks on a planetary scale continuing at widely-separated intervals down to about 9500 BC . "},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 451 According to the earth-crust displacement theory, large parts of Antarctica were positioned outside the Antarctic circle prior to 15,000 BC and thus could have been inhabited, with a climate and resources suitable for the development of civ ilization. A cataclysmic slippage of the crust then shifted the continent to the position it occupies today—dead centre within the Antarctic circle. Suppose that, before the displacement of the earth’s crust, a great civilization had grown up in Antarctica , when much of it was located at green and pleasant latitudes? If so, that civilization might easily have been destroyed by the effects of the displacement: the tidal waves, the hurricane-force winds and electric storms, the volcanic eruptions as seismic faults split open all around the planet, the darkened skies, and the remorselessly expanding ice-cap. Moreover, as the millennia passed, the ruins left behind—the cities, the monuments, the great libraries, and the engineering works of the destroyed civilization—would have been ever more deeply buried beneath the mantle of ice. Little wonder, if the earth-crust displacement theory is correct, that all that can be found today, scattered around the world, are the tantalizing fingerprints of the gods.

Here and there around the globe, in other words, the fingerprints of a lost civilization remain faintly visible. The body is out of sight, buried under two miles of Antarctic ice and almost as inaccessible to archaeologists as if it were located on the dark side of the moon. Fact? Or fiction? Possibility? Or impossibility? Is it a geophysical possibility or a geophysical impossibility that Antarctica, the world’s fifth-largest continent (with a surface area of almost six million square miles) could (a) previously have been located in a more temperate zone and (b) have been shifted out of that zone and into the Antarctic Circle within the last 20,000 years? Is Antarctica movable? A lifeless polar desert ‘Continental drift’ and/or ‘plate-tectonics’ are key terms used to describe an important geological theory that has become increasingly well understood by the general public sinc e the 1950s. It is unnecessary to go into the basic mechanisms here. Bu t most of us are aware that the continents in some way ‘float around ’, relocate and change position on the earth’s surface. Common sense conf irms this: if you take a look at a map of the west coast of Africa and the east coast of South America it’s pretty obvious that these two landmasses were once joined. The time- scale according to which continental drift operates is, however, immense: continents can typically be expected to float apart (or together) at a rate of no more than 2000 miles every 200 m illion years or so: in other words, very, very slowly. 1 Plate-tectonics and Charles Hapgood’s earth-crust displacement theory are by no means mutually contradict ory. Hapgood envisaged that both could occur: that the earth’s crust di d indeed exhibit continental drift as the geologists claimed—almost impercep tibly, over hundreds of millions of years—but that it also occasiona lly experienced very rapid one-piece displacements which had no effect on the relationships between individual landmasses but which thrust entire continents (or parts of them) into and out of the planet’s two fixed polar zones (the perennially cold and icy regions surrounding the North and South Poles of the axis of  1 Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1991, 3:584."},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 453 spin). Continental drift? Earth-crust displacement? Both? Some other cause? I honestly don’t know. Nevertheless, the simple facts about Antarctica are really strange and difficult to expl ain without invoking some notion of sudden, catastrophic and geologically recent change. Before reviewing a few of these facts, let us remind ourselves that we are referring to a landma ss today oriented by the curvature of the earth so that the sun never rises on it du ring the six winter months and never sets during the six summer months (but rather, as viewed from the Pole, remains low above the horizon, appearing to transcribe a circular path around the sky during each tw enty-four hours of daylight). Antarctica is also by far the world’s coldest continent, where temperatures on the polar plain can fall as low as minus 89.2 degrees centigrade. Although the coastal areas are slightly warmer (minus 60 degrees centigrade) and shelter huge numbers of seabird rookeries, there are no native land mammals and there is only a small community of cold- tolerant plants capable of surviving lengthy winter periods of total or near-total darkness. The Encyclopaedia Britannica lists these plants laconically: ‘Lichens, mosses and liverworts, moulds, yeasts, other fungi, algae and bacteria ...’ 2 In other words, although magnificent to behold in the long-drawn-out antipodean dawn, Antarctica is a freez ing, unforgiving, almost lifeless polar desert, as it has been thro ughout mankind’s entire 5000-year ‘historical’ period. Was it always so? Exhibit 1 Discover The World Of Science Magazine, February 1993, page 17: ‘Some 260 million years ago, during the Permian period, deciduous trees adapted to a warm climate grew in Antarctica. This is the conclusion palaeobotanists are drawing from a stand of fossilized tree stumps discovered at an altitude of 70 00 feet on Mount Achernar in the Transantarctic mountains. The site is at 84° 22’ sout h, some 500 miles north of the South Pole. ‘ “The interesting thing about this find is that it’s really the only forest, living or fossil, that’s been found at 80 or 85 degrees latitude,” says Ohio State University palaeobotanist Edit h Taylor, who has studied the fossil trees. “The first thing we palaeobotanists do is look for something in the modern records that is comparable, and there are no forests growing at  2 Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1991, 1:440."},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 454 that latitude today.

Thus Sir Ernest Shackleton found coal beds within 200 miles of the South Pole, and later, during the Byrd expedition of 1935, geologists made a rich discovery of fossils on the lofty sides of Mount Weaver, in latitude 86° 58’ S., about the same distance from the Pole and about two miles above sea level. These included leaf and stem impression s and fossilized wood. In 1952 Dr Lyman H. Dougherty, of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, completing a study of these fossils, identified two species of a tree fern called Glossopteris, once common to the other southern continents (Africa, South America, Australia) and a giant fern tree of another species ...’ 5  3 Discover The World Of Science, February 1993, p. 17. The fifteen mineralized tree stumps, presumably the remnant of a much larger forest, range from three and a half to seven inches in diameter. They were saplings of a well-known genus of seed fern, Glossopteris [found in much of the southern hemisphere’s coal]. Unlike true ferns, seed ferns had seeds instead of spores, were often treelike, and are now extinct ... All around the Mount Achernar tree stumps, Taylor’s colleagues found the tongue-shaped imprints of fallen Glossopteris leaves. Deciduous trees are an indicator of a warm climate, and so is the absence of ‘frost rings’. When Taylor analysed the growth rings in samples from the stumps she found none of the ice-swollen cells and gaps between cells that arise when the growth of a tree is disrupted by frost. That means there wasn’t any frost in the Antarctic at that time. ‘In our memory Antarctica has always been cold,’ says Taylor. ‘It’s only by looking at fossil floras that we can see what potential there is for plant communities. This fossil forest, growing at 85 degrees latitude, give s us some idea of what is possible with catastrophic climate change.’ N . B .

Exhibit 10 The reverse side of the coin. If the lands presently inside the Antarctic Circle were once temperate or tropical, what about lands inside the Arctic Circle? Were they affected by the same dramatic climate changes, suggesting that some common fact or might have been at work? • ‘On the island of Spitzbergen (Svalbard), palm leaves ten and twelve feet long have been fossilized, along with fossilized marine crustaceans of a type that could on ly inhabit tropical waters. This suggests that at one time the temperatures of the Arctic Ocean were similar to the contemporary temperatures of the Bay of Bengal or the Caribbean Sea. Spitzbergen is half way between the northern tip of Norway and the North Pole, at a latitude of 80 degrees N. Today, ships can reach Spitzbergen through the ic e only about two or at the most three months during the year.’ 14 • There is firm fossil evidence that stands of swamp cypress flourished within 500 miles of the North Pole in the Miocene [between 20 million and 6 million years ago], and that wa ter-lillies flourished in Spitzbergen in the same period: ‘The Miocene floras of Grinnell Land and Greenland, and Spitzbergen, all required temperate climatic conditions with plentiful moisture.

In connection with the flora of Spitzbergen it should be realized that the island is in polar darkness for half the year. It lie s on the Arctic Circle, as far north of Labrador as Labrador is north of Bermuda. 15 • Some of the islands in the Arctic Ocean were never covered by ice during the last Ice Age. On Baffin Island, for example, 900 miles from the North Pole, alder and birch rema ins found in peat suggest a much warmer climate than today less than 30,000 years ago.

The bulk of this destruction appears to have taken place during the eleventh millennium BC , although there was an earlier episode of large- scale extinctions around 13,500 BC . 18 • We also saw (Chapter Twenty-seven) that the last Ice Age came to an end between 15,000 and 8000 BC , but principally between 14500 and 12,500 BC , with a further outburst of extraordinarily intense activity in the eleventh millennium BC . During this geologically brief period of time, glaciation up to two miles deep covering millions of square miles which had taken more th an 40,000 years to build-up suddenly and inexplicably melted: ‘It must be obvious that this could not have been the result of the gradually acting clim atic factors usually called upon to explain ice ages ... The rapidity of the deglaciation suggests that some extraordinary factor was affecting climate ...’ 19 The icy executioner Some extraordinary factor was affecting climate ... Was it a 30° one-piece shift of the lit hosphere that abruptly terminated the Ice Age in the northern hemisphere (by pushing the most heavily glaciated areas southwards from the nort hern pole of the spin axis)? If so, why shouldn’t the same 30° one-piece shift of the lithosphere have swivelled a largely deglacia ted six-million-square-mile southern hemisphere continent from temperate latitudes to a position directly over the southern pole of the spin axis? On the issue of the movability of Antarctica, we now know that it is movable and, more to the point, that it has moved, because trees have grown there and trees simply cannot gr ow at latitudes which suffer six months of continual darkness. What we do not know (and may never know for certain) is whether this movement was a consequence of ea rth-crust displacement, or of continental drift, or of some other unguessed-at factor.

The ice-cap is the creeping peril, the deadly menace and the executioner of our civilization. 22 Did this ‘executioner’ cause the end of the last Ice Age in the northern hemisphere by setting in motion a 7000-year shift of the crust between 15,000 BC and 8000 BC —a shift that was perhaps at its most rapid, and would have had its most devast ating effects, between 14,500 BC and 10,000 BC ? 23 Or were the sudden and dramatic climate changes experienced in the northern hemisphere during this period the result of some other catastrophic agency si multaneously capable of melting millions of cubic miles of ice and of sparking off the worldwide increase in volcanism that accompanied the melt-down? 24 Modern geologists are opposed to catastrophes, or rather to catastrophism, preferring to follow the ‘uniformitarian’ doctrine: ‘that existing processes, acting as at present, are sufficient to account for all geological changes’. Catastrophism, on the other hand, holds that ‘changes in the earth’s crust have generally been effected suddenly by physical forces.’ 25 Is it possible, however, that the mechanism responsible for the traumatic earth changes which t ook place at the end of the last Ice Age could have been a geological ev ent both catastrophic and uniform? The great biologist Sir Thomas Huxley remarked in the nineteenth century: To my mind there appears to be no sort of theoretical antagonism between Catastrophism and Uniformitarianism; on th e contrary, it is very conceivable that catastrophes may be part and parcel of uniformity. Let me illustrate my case by analogy. The working of a clock is a model of uniform action. Good timekeeping means uniformity of action. But the striking of a clock is essentially a catastrophe.  20 Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1991, 1:440; John White, Pole Shift, A.R.E.

Nevertheless, all these irregular and apparently lawless catastrophes would be the result of an absolutely uniformitarian action, and we might have two schools of clock theorists, one studying the hammer and the other the pendulum. 26 Could continental drift be the pendulum? Could earth-crust displacement be the hammer? Mars and earth Crustal displacements are thought to have taken place on other planets. In the December 1985 issue of Scientific American, Peter H. Schultz drew attention to meteorite impact craters visible on the Martian surface. Craters in polar areas have a distinctive ‘signature’ because the meteorites land amid the thick deposi ts of dust and ice that accumulate there. Outside the present polar circles of Mars, Schultz found two other such areas: ‘These zones are antipodal; they are on opposite faces of the planet. The deposits show many of the processes and characteristics of today’s poles, but they lie near the present-day equator ...’ What could have caused this effect? Judging from the evidence, Shultz put forward the theory that the mechanism appeared to have been ‘the movement of the entire lithosphere, the solid outer portion of the planet as one plate ... [This mo vement seems to have taken place] in rapid spurts followed by long pauses.’ 27 If crustal displacements can happen on Mars, why not on earth? And if they don’t happen on earth, how do we account for the otherwise awkward fact that not a single one of the ice-caps built up around the world during previous Ice Ages se ems to have occurred at—or even near—either of the present poles. 28 On the contrary, land areas bearing the marks of former glaciation are very widely distributed. If we cannot assume crustal shifts, we must find some other way to explain why the ice-caps appear to have reached sea level within the tropics on three continents: Asia, Africa and Australia. 29 Charles Hapgood’s solution to this problem is simple, extremely elegant and does not affront commonsense: The only ice age that is adequately explained is the present ice age in Antarctica. This is excellently explained. It exists, quite obviously, because Antarctica is at the pole, and for no other reason. No variation of the sun’s heat, no galactic dust, no volcanism, no subcrustal currents, and no arrangements of land elevations or sea  26 Thomas Huxley cited in Path of the Pole, p. 294. 27 Scientific American, December 1985. 28 Path of the Pole, pp. 47-9. 29 Ibid., p. 49."},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 461 currents account for the fact. We may conclude that the best theory to account for an ice age is that the area concerned wa s at the pole. We thus account for the Indian and African ice sheets, though the areas once occupied by them are now in the tropics. We account for all ice sheets of continental size in the same way. 30 The logic is close to inescapable. Either we accept that the Antarctic ice cap is the first continent-sized ice sheet ever to have been situated at a pole—which seems improbable—or we are obliged to suppose that earth- crust displacement, or a similar mech anism, must have been at work. Memories of the polar dawn? Our ancestors may have preserved in their most ancient traditions memories of a displacement. We saw some of these memories in Part IV: cataclysm myths that appear to be ey ewitness accounts of the series of geological disasters which accompanied the end of the last Ice-Age in the northern hemisphere. 31 There are other myths too, which may have come down to us from that epoc h between 15,000 and 10,000 BC . Among these are several which speak of lands of th e gods and of former paradises, all of which are described as being in the south (for example, the Ta-Neteru of the Egyptians) and many of which seem to have experienced polar conditions. The great Indian epic, Mahabaratha, speaks of Mount Meru, the land of the gods: At Meru the sun and moon go round from left to right every day, and so do all the stars ... The mountain by its lusture, so overcomes the darkness of night, that the night can hardly be distinguished from th e day. ... The day and night are together equal to a year to the residents of the place ... 32 Similarly, as the reader will reca ll from Chapter Twenty-five, Airyana Vaejo, the mythical paradise and former homeland of the Avestic Aryans of Iran, seems to have been render ed uninhabitable by the sudden onset of glaciation. In later years it was spoken of as a place in which: ‘the stars, the moon and the sun are only once a year seen to rise and set, and a year seems only as a day.’ 33 In the Surya Siddhanta, an ancient Indian text, we read, ‘The gods behold the sun, after it has once arisen, for half a year.’ 34 The seventh Mandala of the Rigveda contains a number of ‘Dawn’ hymns. One of these (VII, 76) says that the dawn has raised its banner on the horizon with its usual splendour and report s in Verse 3 that a period of several days elapsed between the first appearance of the dawn and the rising of  30 Ibid., p. 58. 31 See Part IV. 32 The Mahabaratha, cited in The Arctic Home in the Vedas, pp. 64-5. 33 Ibid., pp. 66-7. 34 Cited in Paradise Found: The Cradle of the Human Race at the North Pole, p. 199."},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 462 the sun that followed it. 35 Another passage states, ‘many were the days between the first beams of the dawn and actual sunrise’. 36 Are these eyewitness accounts of polar conditions? Although we can never be sure, it may be relevant that in Indian tradition the Vedas are believed to be revealed texts, passed down from the time of the gods. 37 It may also be relevant that in describing the processes of transmission, all the traditions refer to the pralayas (cataclysms) which occasionally overtake the world and claim that in each of these the written scriptures are physically destroyed. After each destruction, however, certain Rishis or ‘wise men’ survive who repromulgate, at the beginning of the new age, the knowledge inherited by them as a sacred trust from their forefathers in the preceding age ... Each manvantara or age thus has a Veda of its own which differs only in expression and not in sense from the antediluvian Veda. 38 An epoch of turmoil and darkness As every schoolboy geographer unders tands, true north (the North Pole) is not quite the same thing as magn etic north (the direction compass needles point). Indeed the magnetic no rth pole is presently situated in northern Canada, about 11 degrees from the true North Pole. 39 Recent advances in the study of palaeomagn etism have proved that the earth’s magnetic polarity has reversed itself more than 170 times during the past 80 million years ... 40 What causes these field reversals? While he was teaching at the Universi ty of Cambridge the geologist S. K. Runcorn published an article in Scientific American which made a pertinent point: There seems no doubt that the earth’s magnetic field is tied up in some way to the rotation of the planet. And this leads to a remarkable finding about the earth’s rotation itself ... [The unavoidable conclusi on is that] the earth’s axis of rotation has changed also. In other words, the planet has rolled about, changing the location of the geographical poles. 41 Runcorn appears to be envisaging a complete 180-degree flip of the poles, with the earth literally tumb ling—although similar palaeomagnetic readings would result from a slippage of the crust over the geographical poles. Either way, the consequences for civilization, and indeed for all life, would be unimaginably dreadful.  35 Arctic Home in the Vedas, p. 81. 36 Ibid., p. 85. 37 Ibid., pp. 414, 417. 38 Ibid., p. 420. 39 Pole Shift, p. 9. 40 Ibid. 41 Ibid., p. 61."},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 463 Of course, Runcorn may be wrong; perhaps field reversals can occur in the absence of any other upheavals. But he may also be right. According to reports published in Nature and New Scientist, the last geomagnetic reversal was complete d just 12,400 years ago—during the eleventh millennium BC . 42 This is of course the very millenni um in which the ancient Tiahuanacan civilization in the Andes seems to have been destroyed. The same millennium is signalled by the a lignments and design of the great astronomical monuments on the Gi za plateau, and by the erosion patterns on the Sphinx. And it was in the eleventh millennium BC that Egypt’s ‘precocious agricultural experi ment’ suddenly failed. Likewise it was in the eleventh millennium BC that huge numbers of large mammal species all around the world vanish ed into extinction. The list could continue: abrupt rises in sea level, hurricane-force winds, electrical storms, volcanic disturbances, and so on. Scientists expect the next reversal of the earth’s magnetic poles to occur around AD 2030. 43 Is this an intimation of planetary disaster? After 12,500 years of the pendulum, is the hammer about to strike?

I am beginning to suspect that the human race may have placed itself in grave jeopardy by failing to consider [the implications of these mysteries. We have the ability, unique in the animal kingdom, to learn from the experiences of our predecessors. After Hiroshima and Nagasaki, for example, two generations have grown to adulthood in awareness of the horrific destruction that nuclear weapons unleash. Our children will be aware of this too, without experiencing it directly, and they will pass it on to their children. Theoretically, therefore, the knowledge of what atom bombs do has become part of the permanent historical legacy of mankind, whether we choose to benefit from that legacy or not is up to us. Nevertheless the knowledge is there, should we wish to use it, because it has been preserved and transmitted in written records, in film archives, in allegorical paintings, in war memorials, and so on. Not all testimony from the past is accorded the same stature as the records of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. On the contrary, like the Canonical Bible, the body of knowledge that we call ‘History’ is an edited cultural artefact from which much has been left out. In particular, references to human experiences prior to the inve ntion of writing around 5000 years ago have been omitted in their entirety and myth has become a synonym for delusion. Suppose it is not delusion? Suppose that a tremendous cataclysm were to overtake the earth today, obliterating the achievements of our civilization and wiping out almost all of us. Suppose, to paraphrase Plato, that we were forced by this cataclysm ‘to begin again like children, in complete ignorance of what had happened in early times’. 1 Under such circumstances, ten or twelve thousand years from now (with all wri tten records and film archives long since destroyed) what testimony mi ght our descendants still preserve concerning the events at the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 of the Christian era? It is easy to imagine how they might speak in mystical terms of explosions that gave off a ‘terrible glare of light’ and ‘immense heat’. 2 Nor would we be too surprised to find that they might have formulated a ‘mythical’ account something like this:  1 Plato, Timaeus and Critias, Penguin Classics, 1977, p. 36. 2 The Bhagavata Purana, Motilal Banardass, Delhi, 1986, Part I, pp. 59, 95."},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 467 The flames of the Brahmastra-charged missiles mingled with each other and surrounded by fiery arrows they covered the earth, heaven and space between and increased the conflagration like the fire an d the Sun at the end of the world ...

How might our descendants remember that strange aircraft and the squadrons of others like it that swarmed through the skies of planet earth during the twentieth century of the Christian era? Isn’t it possible, probable even, that they might preserve traditions of ‘celestial cars’ and ‘heavenly chariots’ and ‘spacious flying machines’, and even of ‘aerial cities’. 4 If they did, would they pe rhaps speak of such wonders in mythical terms a little like these: • ‘Oh you, Uparicara Vasu, the spacious aerial flying machine will come to you—and you alone, of all the mortals, seated on that vehicle will look like a deity.’ 5 • ‘Visvakarma, the architect among the Gods, built aerial vehicles for the Gods.’ 6 • ‘Oh you descendant of the Kurus, that wicked fellow came on that all- traversing automatic flying vehicl e known as Saubhapura and pierced me with weapons.’ 7 • ‘He entered into the favourite divine palace of Indra and saw thousands of flying vehicles intended for the Gods lying at rest.’ 8 • ‘The Gods came in their respective flying vehicles to witness the battle between Kripacarya and Arjuna. Even Indra, the Lord of Heaven, came with a special type of flying ve hicle which could accommodate 33 divine beings.’ 9 All these quotations have been taken from the Bhagavata Purana and from the Mahabaratha, two drops in the ocean of the ancient wisdom literature of the Indian subcontinent.

For the benefit of future generations of mankind Here is a scenario: Suppose that we had calculated, on the basis of sound evidence and beyond any shadow of a doubt, that our civilization was soon to be obliterated by a titanic geological cataclysm—a 30° displacement of the earth’s crust, for example, or a he ad-on collision with a ten-mile-wide nickel-iron asteroid travelling towards us at cosmic speed. Of course there would at firs t be much panic and despair. Nevertheless—if there were sufficien t advance warning—steps would be taken to ensure that there would be some survivors and that some of what was most valuable in our high scientific knowledge would be preserved for the benefit of future generations. Strangely enough, the Jewish historian Josephus (who wrote during the first century AD ) attributes precisely this behaviour to the clever and prosperous inhabitants of the anted iluvian world who lived before the Flood ‘in a happy condition without any misfortunes falling upon them’: 11 They also were the inventors of that peculiar sort of wisdom which is concerned with the heavenly bodies, and their order. And that their inventions might not be lost—upon Adam’s prediction that the worl d was to be destroyed at one time by the force of fire, and at another time by the violence and quantity of water—they made two pillars, one of brick, the other of stone: they inscribed their discoveries upon them both, that in case the pillar of brick should be destroyed by the Flood, the pillar of stone might remain and exhibit these discoveries to mankind; and also inform them that there was anot her pillar of brick erected by them ... 12 Likewise, when the Oxford astronomer John Greaves visited Egypt in the seventeenth century he collected ancient local traditions which attributed the construction of the three Giza py ramids to a mythical antediluvian king:  10 The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts, p. 70, Utt. 261. 11 The Complete Works Of Josephus, Kregel Publications, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 1991, p. 27. 12 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 469 The occasion of this was because he saw in his sleep that the whole earth was turned over, with the inhabitants of it lying upon their faces and the stars falling down and striking one another with a terrible noise ...

They answered yes, and will destroy it. And there remained a certain number of years to come, and he commanded in the mean space to build the Pyramids ... And he engraved in these Pyramids all things that were told by wise men, as also all profound sciences—the sc ience of Astrology, and of Arithmeticke, and of Geometry, and of Physicke. All this may be interpreted by him that knowes their characters and language ... 13 Taken at face value, the message of both of these myths seems crystal clear: certain mysterious structures scattered around the world were built to preserve and transmit the knowle dge of an advanced civilization of remote antiquity which was dest royed by a terrifying upheaval. Could this be so? And what are we to make of other strange traditions that have come to us from the dark vault of prehistory? What are we to make, for example, of the Popol Vuh, which speaks in veiled language about a great secret of the human past: a long-forgotten golden age when everything was possible—a magical time of scientific progress and enlightenment when the ‘First Men’ (who were ‘endowed with intelligence’) not only ‘measured the round face of the earth’ but ‘examined the four points of the arch of the sky’. As the reader will recall, the gods became jealous at the rapid progress made by these upstart humans who had ‘succeeded in seeing, succeeded in knowing, all that there is in the world.’ 14 Divine retribution quickly followed: ‘The Heart of Heaven blew mi st into their eyes ... In this way all the wisdom and all the knowledge of the First Men [together with their memory of their] origin and their beginning, were destroyed.’ 15 The secret of what happened was never entirely forgotten because a record of those distant First Times wa s preserved, until the coming of the Spaniards, in the sacred texts of the original Popol Vuh. The abuses of the conquest made it necessary for that primordial document to be concealed from all but the most highly-initiated sages and replaced with a watered-down substitute written ‘under the law of Christianity’: 16 ‘No longer can be seen the book of Popol Vuh which the kings had in olden times ... The original book, written long ago, existed—but now its sight is hidden to the searcher and to the thinker ...’ 17 On the other side of the world, among the myths and traditions of the Indian subcontinent, there are furthe r tantalizing suggestions of hidden secrets.

At the least we would want to say to them: K ILROY WAS HERE ! and to be sure they got the message no matter what language they spoke or what ethical, religious, ideologi cal, metaphysical or philosophical leanings th eir society might exhibit. I’m sure we’d want to say more than just ‘Kilroy was here’. We’d want, for example, to tell them—those distant grandchildren of ours— when we had lived in relation to their time. How would we do that? How would we express, say, AD 2012 of the Christian era in a language univer sal enough to be worked out and understood twelve thousand years hence by a civilization that would know nothing of the Christian or of any of the other eras by which we express chronology? One obvious solution would be to make use of the beautiful predictability of the earth’s axial precession, which has the effect of slowly and regularly altering the declination of the entire star-field in relation to a viewer at a fixed point, and which equally slowly and regularly revolves the equinoctial point in relation to the twelve zodiacal constellations. From the predictability of this motion it fo llows that if we could find a way to declare: WE LIVED WHEN THE VERNAL EQUINOX WAS IN THE CONSTELLATION OF P ISCES we would provide a means of specifying our epoch to within a single 2160-year period in every grand precessional cycle of 25,920 years. The only drawback to this scheme would become evident if a civilization equivalent to our own fail ed to arise within 12,000 or even 20,000 years of the cataclysm, but took much longer—perhaps as much as 30,000 years. In that case, a monu ment or calendrical device declaring ‘we lived when the vernal equinox wa s in the constellation of Pisces’ would no longer be unambiguous. If discovered by a high culture flourishing at the very beginning of a future Age of Sagittarius for example it could be read as meaning ‘we lived 4320 years before your time’—that is, two full precessional ‘months’ prior to the Sagittarian Age (the 2160-year ‘months’ of Aquarius and Capricorn). But it could also mean ‘We lived 30,240 years before your time’, that is those two ‘months’ plus the full previous precessional cycle of 25,920 years. The Sagittarian archaeologists would not only have to use their wits to work out the meaning of the message (i.e. WE LIVED WHEN THE VERNAL EQUINOX WAS IN P ISCES ), but would need to decide from other clues which Age of Pisces we had lived in: the most recent, or the one in the previous precessional cycle, or perhaps even the cycle before that.

There would be several other options and combinations of options open to us, depending on our circumstan ces, on the level of technology available to us, on the extent of the early warning we were given, and on which chronological facts we wanted to transmit. Suppose, for example, that there was not time to make proper preparations prior to the catastrophe. Suppose that the disaster, like ‘the Day of the Lord’ in 2 Peter 3, crept up on us unseen ‘as a thief in the night?’ 21 What prospects might humanity be faced with? Whether as the result of an aste roid strike or an earth-crust displacement or some other cosmic or geological cause, let us assume: 1 massive devastation all around the world; 2 the survival of only relatively small numbers of people, the majority of whom rapidly revert to barbarism; 3 the presence, among this remnant, of a minority of well-organized visionaries—including master-builders, scientists, engineers, cartographers, mathematicians, medical doctors and the like—who dedicate themselves to salvaging what they can and finding ways to transmit the knowledge to the futu re for the benefit of those who might eventually understand it. Let us call these hypothetical visionaries ‘the civilisers’. As they banded together—at first to survive, later to teach and to share ideas—they might take on something of the manner and belief systems of a religious cult, developing a clear sense of mission an d of shared identity. No doubt they would make use of powerful and easily recognizable symbols to strengthen and express this sense of common purpose: the men might wear distinctive beards, for example, or shave their heads, and certain archetypal imagery like the cross and the serpent and the dog might be used to link the members of the cult together as they set out on their civilizing missions to relight the lamps of knowledge around the world.  21 2 Peter 3:10."},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 473 I suspect, if the situation were ba d enough after the cataclysm, that many of the civilizers woul d fail, or meet with only limited success. But let us suppose that one small group had the skill and dedication sufficient to create a lasting and stable beach-he ad, perhaps in a region which had suffered relatively little damage in the disaster. Then let us suppose that some other unexpected disaster were to occur—an aftershock or series of aftershocks from the original catastrophe perhaps—and the beach-head was almost totally annihilated. What might happen next? What might be salvaged from this wreckage of a wisdom cult which had itself be en salvaged from a greater wreck? Transmitting the essence If the circumstances were right it seems possible that the essence of the cult might survive, carried forward by a nucleus of determined men and women. I suspect, too, with the proper motivation and indoctrination techniques, plus a means of recruiting new members from among the half-savage local inhabitants, that such a cult might perpetuate itself almost indefinitely. This could happen, however, only if its members (like the Jews awaiting the Messiah) were prepared to bide their time, for thousands and thousands of years, until they felt confident that the moment had come to declare themselves. If they did that, and if their sacred objective were indeed to preserve and transmit knowledge to some evolved future civilization, it is easy to imagine how the cult members might be described in terms similar to those used for the Egyptian wisdom god Thoth who was said to have succeeded in understanding the mysteries of the heavens [and to have] revealed them by inscribing them in sacred books which he then hid here on earth, intending that they should be searched for by future generations but found only by the fully worthy ... 22 What might the mysterious ‘books of Th oth’ have been? Is it necessary to suppose that all the information they were purported to contain should have been transmitted in book form? Is it not worth wondering, for example, whether Professors de Santillana and von Dechend might have earned their place among the ‘fully worthy’ when they decoded the advanced scientific language embedded in the great universal myths of precession? In so doing, is it not possible that they might have stumbled upon one of the metaphorical ‘books’ of Thoth and read the ancient science inscribed upon its pages? Likewise, what about Posnansky’s discoveries at Tiahuanaco, and Hapgood’s maps? What about the ne w understanding that is dawning concerning the geological antiquity of the Sphinx at Giza? What about the questions raised by the gigantic blocks used in the construction of the  22 The Egyptian Hermes, p. 33."},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 474 Valley and Mortuary Temples? What about the secrets now being teased, one by one, from the astronomical alignments and dimensions and concealed chambers of the pyramids? If these, too, are readings from the metaphorical books of Thoth, it would seem that the numbers of the ‘fully worthy’ are increasing, and that new and even more startling re velations may soon be at hand ... To return briefly and for the last time to our evolving scenario: 1 at the beginning of the twenty-first century of the Christian era, near the cusp of the Age of Pisces and th e Age of Aquarius, civilization as we know it is destroyed; 2 among the devastated survivors a few hundred or a few thousand individuals band together to preserve and transmit the fruits of their culture’s scientific knowledge into a distant and uncertain future; 3 these civilizers split into small groups and spread across the globe; 4 by and large they fail, and perish; ne vertheless, in certain areas, some do succeed in making a lasting cultural impression; 5 after thousands of years—and perhaps several false starts—a branch of the original wisdom cult influences the emergence of a fully fledged civilization ... Of course the parallel for this last ca tegory is once again to be found in Egypt. I would seriously pr opose as a hypothesis for further testing that a scientific wisdom cult, made up of the survivors of a great, lost, maritime civilization, could perhaps have establ ished itself in the Nile Valley as early as the fourteenth millennium BC . The cult would ha ve been based at Heliopolis, Giza and Abydos, and perh aps at other centres as well, and would have initiated Egypt’s early agri cultural revolution . Later, however, beaten down by the huge floods an d other disturbances of the earth which took place in the eleventh millennium BC , the cult would have been obliged to cut its losses and withdraw until the turmoil of the Ice Age was over—never knowing whether its message would survive the subsequent dark epochs. Under such circumstances, the hypo thesis suggests that a huge and ambitious building project would have been on e way cult members could preserve and transmit scientific information into the future independently of their physical survival. In other words, if the buildings were large enough, capable of enduring through immense spans of time and encoded through and through with the cult’s message, there would be hope that the message would be decoded at some future date even if the cult had by then long since ceased to exist. The hypothesis proposes that this is what the enigmatic structures on the Giza plateau are all about:"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 475 1 that the Great Sphinx is indeed, as we have argued in previous chapters, an equinoctial marker for th e Age of Leo, indicating a date in our own chronology of between 10,970 BC and 8810 BC ; 2 that the three principal pyramids are indeed laid out in relation to the Nile Valley to mimic the precise dispositions of the three stars of Orion’s Belt in relation to the co urse of the Milky Way in 10,450 BC . This is a pretty effective means of ‘s pecifying’ the epoch of the eleventh millennium BC by using the phenomenon of precession, which has been rightly described as the ‘onl y true clock of our planet’. 23 Confusingly, however, we also know that the Great Pyramid incorporates star shafts ‘locked in’ to Orion’s Belt and Sirius at around 2450 BC . 24 The hypothesis resolves the anomaly of the missing years by supposing the star shafts to be merely the later work of the same long-lived cult that originally laid out the Giza ground-plan in 10,450 BC . Naturally, the hypothesis also suggests that it was this same cu lt, towards the end of those 8000 missing years, that provided the initia ting spark for the sudden and ‘fully formed’ emergence of the literate historical civilization of dynastic Egypt. What remains to be guessed at are the motives of the pyramid builders, who were presumably the same people as the mysterious cartographers who mapped the globe at the end of the last Ice Age in the northern hemisphere. If so, we might also ask why these highly civilized and technically accomplished architects and navigators were obsessed with charting the gradual glaciation of the enigmatic southern continent of Antarctica from the fourteenth millennium BC —when Hapgood calculates that the source map referred to by Phillipe Buache was drawn up—down to about the end of the fifth millennium BC ? Could they have been making a perm anent cartographical record of the slow obliteration of their homeland? And could their overwhelming desire to transmit a message to the future through a variety of differ ent media—myths, maps, buildings, calendar systems, mathematical harmonies—have been connected to the cataclysms and earth changes that caused this loss? An urgent mission The possession of a conscious, articu lated history is one of the faculties that distinguishes human beings from animals. Unlike rats, say, or sheep, or cows, or pheasants, we have a past which is separate from ourselves. We therefore have the opportunity, as I have said, to learn from the experiences of our predecessors. Is it because we are perverse, or misguided, or simply stupid that we  23 By Robert Bauval, personal communication. 24 See Part VII."},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 476 refuse to recognize those experiences unless they have come down to us in the form of bona fide ‘historical records’? And is it arrogance or ignorance which leads us to draw an arbitrary line separating ‘history’ from ‘prehistory’ at about 5000 years before the present—defining the records of ‘history’ as valid testimon y and the records of ‘prehistory’ as primitive delusions? At this stage in a continuing investig ation, my instinct is that we may have put ourselves in danger by closing our ears for so long to the disturbing ancestral voices which reach us in the form of myths. This is more an intuitive than a rational feeling, but it is by no means unreasonable. My research has filled me with respect for the logical thinking, high science, deep psychological insights, and vast cosmographical knowledge of the an cient geniuses who composed those myths, and who, I am now fully persua ded, descended from the same lost civilization that produced the map-ma kers, pyramid builders, navigators, astronomers and earth-measurers whose fingerprints we have been following across the continents and oceans of the earth. Since I have learned to respect those long-forgotten and still only hazily identified Newtons and Shakespeares and Einsteins of the last Ice Age, I think it would be foolish to disregar d what they seem to be saying. And what they seem to be saying to us is this: that cyclical, recurrent and near-total destructions of mankind ar e part and parcel of life on this planet, that such destructions have occurred many times before and that they will certainly occur again. What, after all, is the remarkable calendrical system of the Mayas if it is not a medium for transmitting exactly this message? What, if not vehicles for the same sort of bad news are the traditions of the four previous ‘Suns’ (or sometimes of the three prev ious ‘Worlds’) passed down in the Americas since time immemorial? By the same token, what might be the function of the great myths of pr ecession which speak not just of previous cataclysms but of cataclysm s to come and which (through the metaphor of the cosmic m ill) link these earthly disasters to ‘disturbances in the heavens’? Last but by no means least, what burning motive impelled the pyramid builders to erect, with such care, the powerful and mysterious edifices on the Giza plateau? Yes, they were saying , ‘Kilroy was here’. And, yes, they found an ingenious wa y to tell us when they were here. Of these things I have no doubt. I am also impressed by the enormous lengths they went to to provide us with convincing proof that theirs was a serious and scientifically advanced civilization. And I am even more impressed by the sense of urgency—of a vitally important mission—that seems to have enlightened all their works and deeds. I go on intuition agai n, not on evidence. It’s my guess that their underlyi ng objective could have been to"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"Graham Hancock – FINGER PRINTS OF THE GODS 477 transmit a warning to the future, and that this warning could be to do with a global cataclysm, perhaps even a recurrence of the same cataclysm that so clearly devastated mankind at the end of the last Ice Age when ‘Noah saw that the earth had tilted, and that its destruction was near, and cried out in a bitter voice: “Tell me what is being done on the earth that the earth is so afflicted and shaken ...” ’ 25 These words are from the Hebrew Book of Enoch, but similar afflictions and shakings have been foretold in all the Central American traditions that speak of the demise of the present epoch of the world—an epoc h, as the reader will recall, in which ‘the elders say [that] there will be a movement of the earth and from this we shall all perish.’ 26 The reader will also not have forg otten the date calculated by the Ancient Maya calendar for the end of the world: The day will be 4 Ahau 3 Kankin [corresponding to 23 December AD 2012], and it will be ruled by the Sun God, the ninth Lord of the Night. The moon will be eight days old, and it will be the third lunation in a series of six ... 27 In the Mayan scheme of things we are already living in the last days of the earth. In the Christian scheme of things too, the last days are understood to be upon us. According to the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania: ‘This world w ill perish just as surely as did the world before the Flood ... Many things were foretold to occur during the last days, and all of these are being fulfilled. This means that the end of the world is near ...’ 28 Similarly the Christian psychic Edgar Cayce prophesied in 1934 that around the year 2000: ‘There will be a shifting of the poles. There will be upheavals in the Arctic and the Antarctic that will make for the eruption of volcanoes in the Torrid areas ... Th e upper portion of Europe will be changed in the twinkling of an eye. The earth will be broken up in the western portion of America. The grea ter portion of Japan must go into the sea.’ 29 Curiously the epoch of the year 2000 , which figures in these Christian prophecies, also coincides with the Last Time (or highest point) in the great upwards cycle of the belt stars of the Orion constellation, just as the epoch of the eleventh millennium BC coincided with the First Time (or lowest point) of that cycle.

We may never know, one way or another—unless it happens. Meanwhile, I do not think the Egyptian scribe Manetho was being less than literal when he spoke of a harsh and deadly cosmic power at work in the universe: Just as iron is likely to be attracted and led after the loadstone, but often turns away and is repelled in the opposite direction, so the salutary, good and rational movement of the world at one time attracts, conciliates and mollifies that harsh power; then again, when the latter has recovered itself, it overthrows the other and reduces it to helplessness ... 31 In short, through metaphors and alle gories, I suspect the ancients may have tried to find many ways to tell us exactly when—and why—the hammer of global destruction is going to strike again. I therefore think, after 12,500 years of the pendulum, that it would only be wise for us to devote more of our resources to st udying the signs and messages that have come down to us from that da rk and terrifying period of amnesia which our species calls prehistory. A speeding up of physical research at the Giza plateau would also be highly desirable—not only by Egypto logists determined to resist any threats to the scholarly status quo but by eclectic teams of investigators who could bring some of the newer scie nces to bear on the challenges of this most enigmatic and impenetrable of sites. The Chlorine-36 rock- exposure dating technique mentioned in Chapter Six, for example, looks like a particularly promising means of resolving the impasse over the antiquity of the Pyramids and the Sphinx. 32 Likewise, if the will is there, then a way can be found to get through to whatever lies beyond the little door concealed in the Great Pyramid 200 feet up the southern shaft of  30 See Part V. 31 Manetho, pp. 191-3. 32 The Chlorine-36 rock-exposure dating technique has been developed by Professor David Bowen of the Department of Earth Sc iences at the University of Wales. In The Times of London, 1 December 1994, Brown observed: ‘One way of resolving the controversy of the ages of the Sphinx and the Pyramids may be through the application of Chlorine-36 rock-exposure dating. This provides an estimate of the time that has elapsed since a rock was first exposed to the atmosphere. In the case of the Sphinx and the Pyramids this would be when the rocks were first exposed by quarrying activity ...’ In 1994 Bowen ran preliminary tests on th e famous ‘bluestones’ of Stonehenge in England, hitherto believed to date to 2250 BC . What the tests showed was that these 123 four-ton monoliths could have been quarried during the last Ice Age—perhaps as early as 12000 BC .

At the same ti me serious efforts should be made to investigate the contents of the large, square-edged and apparently man-made cavity in the bedrock, d eep beneath the paws of the Sphinx, that was discovered when a seismic survey was carried out at the site in 1993. 33 Last but not least, far away from Giza, I suspect that our efforts might also be repaid if we were to undertake a proper investigation of the sub- glacial landscapes of Antarctica—much the most likely continent to hide the complete remains of a lost civiliz ation. If we could establish what destroyed that civilization, then we might be in a better position to save ourselves from a similar cataclysmic fate. In making these latter suggestions I am, of course, fully aware that there are many who will be scornful and will assert the uniformitarian view that ‘all things will continue as they have done since the beginning of creation.’ 34 But I am also aware that such ‘scoffers in the last days’ 35 are those who for one reason or another are deaf to the testimony of our forgotten ancestors. As we have seen, this testimony appears to be trying to tell us that a hideous calamity has indeed descended upon mankind from time to time, that on each o ccasion it has afflicted us suddenly, without warning and withou t mercy, like a thief in the night, and that it will certainly recur at some point in the future, obliging us—unless we are well prepared—to begin again like orphaned children in complete ignorance of our true heritage.

Melza put my question to him and a moment later translated her grandfather’s reply: ‘He says, “why do you want to know”?’ I explained that there were many reasons. The most important was that I felt a sense of urgency: ‘My resear ch has convinced me that there was an advanced civilization—long, long ago—that was destroyed in a terrible cataclysm.
